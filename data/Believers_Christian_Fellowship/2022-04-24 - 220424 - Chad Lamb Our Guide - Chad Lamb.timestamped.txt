[10:02] amen amen also uh i don't want to forget
[10:06] to mention this and brother yatzik's
[10:08] church they
[10:10] sent us some things they sent
[10:12] a big stack of small coloring books for
[10:15] the children somebody in their church
[10:17] had drawn a bunch of coloring book pages
[10:20] from some of the stories brother benham
[10:21] tells in the sermons and so
[10:24] that is back out here in the four year
[10:27] by the welcome desk there's a table the
[10:28] deacons have set up and they have all
[10:30] those coloring books out there so if all
[10:31] the little kids if each of you i guess
[10:33] an older kid too if you like coloring
[10:35] can grab a coloring book they wanted to
[10:37] share that with the church also they
[10:39] sent a big pack of stickers and the
[10:41] stickers are really nicely done they had
[10:43] a sister in their church put them
[10:44] together and there's some scriptures and
[10:46] some quotes from the message on those
[10:48] stickers so they'll be all out there as
[10:50] well so if any of you want to go by and
[10:52] grab a couple of those stickers they're
[10:54] really nice i thought they were going to
[10:55] be for the kids but i looked at them
[10:56] they're really nice stickers
[10:58] so
[10:59] so just grab a couple and they they
[11:01] really want you to enjoy that that's
[11:02] something they sent it was really nice
[11:04] they also sent some little pocket cards
[11:06] uh it has the statue of a perfect man
[11:08] pyramid on one side and the cloud
[11:10] and the pillar fire on the other they're
[11:12] really nice if you want to keep those in
[11:14] your wallet so that'll be all out in the
[11:16] foyer so i'll try to remember at the end
[11:17] of service to remind you of that as well
[11:19] but they really wanted you to have that
[11:21] and it was really quite quite nice for
[11:23] them to share that with us
[11:25] i'd like to start by giving a little bit
[11:27] of a quick trip report
[11:29] and share uh what the lord did for us
[11:32] there it was really wonderful we
[11:34] appreciate your prayers we needed your
[11:35] prayers but before i get too deep into
[11:37] it i've asked brother ilie if he'll come
[11:39] but if you'd like to come on up and just
[11:41] greet you and say god bless you and
[11:43] maybe share a thought so
[11:46] nobody likes to do this part
[11:48] but
[11:49] i told him i said we all love you
[11:50] brother
[11:52] you're amongst friends
[12:00] complacent brothers and sisters
[12:02] i'm
[12:03] very nervous
[12:05] uh
[12:07] damn brother chad asked me if i could
[12:09] give a little bit of a report i asked is
[12:13] there any way to avoid it he said well
[12:14] you can try but i've already made the
[12:16] decision so
[12:18] like okay well i guess i have no choice
[12:22] and then coming in here uh i was
[12:25] actually i was feeling okay
[12:27] we were talking with my wife along the
[12:29] way and then when i started coming in
[12:30] everyone started telling me we're
[12:32] looking forward for the test for the
[12:34] report
[12:35] so that made me very nervous
[12:38] so and then brother chad told me that
[12:40] it's
[12:41] it's normal
[12:42] to be nervous and to be shaky
[12:45] but it might be normal but it's still
[12:47] not helping though
[12:50] but if i could share a little bit of
[12:53] maybe my personal side and maybe not to
[12:56] take away from the
[12:57] report that brother chad is going to be
[12:59] giving
[13:01] of course
[13:02] when brother chad asked me
[13:05] i was very shocked and surprised
[13:09] and
[13:11] it was
[13:13] it was very unusual for me because i
[13:15] really wasn't expecting it so brother
[13:17] chad gave me a few days to think and
[13:19] then when i when i when i finally gave
[13:22] the gave the answer i said yes and then
[13:26] god really worked things out and it made
[13:28] me feel better so okay god is in it so
[13:31] i'm feeling good and better now and then
[13:33] before
[13:34] probably the day before we left
[13:37] we had a little bit of accident in our
[13:39] at our house to where
[13:40] uh really we were supposed to have a big
[13:43] fire in our shed
[13:45] but god really stopped it from anything
[13:48] from anything to happening so that
[13:49] really gave gave me a little bit more
[13:51] peace to where i feel more confident
[13:53] okay now now it's okay now we could keep
[13:55] going and then the next day when we show
[13:58] up at the airport
[14:00] we had problems and usually it was
[14:03] because of me
[14:05] and then when we when we when we finally
[14:07] made it to detroit over there there was
[14:09] u.s marshals that
[14:11] uh had questions and they called me by
[14:14] the microphone and i guess it's
[14:17] brother chad pointed out very clear that
[14:20] it's probably very unusual that there's
[14:22] a ukrainian living in america and he's
[14:25] russian ethnicity so it's probably not a
[14:28] really good combination going to poland
[14:31] especially during this time right now so
[14:34] yeah it was
[14:36] by the time we got to poland i i was
[14:38] feeling uh
[14:39] quite
[14:40] not not very confident that i should be
[14:42] there because i was causing more
[14:45] troubles at that point
[14:47] but by god's grace when we got there we
[14:49] drove for two hours we got to the first
[14:52] church
[14:53] and the pastor over there they didn't
[14:54] have anyone who would be able to
[14:56] translate to russian
[14:59] so i was very
[15:01] nervous of course it still gave me made
[15:03] me nervous but at the same time i was
[15:05] glad that i was able to help in some way
[15:08] so the for in the the pastor over there
[15:11] he he knows russian but very very little
[15:14] russian
[15:15] and plus he didn't speak russian for
[15:17] over 20 or 30 years so he didn't uh he
[15:20] wasn't very confident and
[15:22] by god's grace i was able to translate
[15:24] both those services
[15:26] and it was a great a tremendous blessing
[15:29] for me
[15:30] and one thing that i know
[15:32] that i really learned during the
[15:34] translation was that
[15:36] don't put your mind into it just let god
[15:39] god's word flow through you
[15:41] because there was a few times where i
[15:42] tried to put my mind to it try to figure
[15:45] things out and yeah i started stumbling
[15:48] really fast
[15:50] so by god's grace i was able to help
[15:52] help over there and during brother
[15:54] yatzik when we went to the other church
[15:58] to brother yatzik it was
[16:00] it was there was wonderful fellowship
[16:02] over there it was really nice for me
[16:04] personally to
[16:05] especially
[16:06] being
[16:07] over here having a stable job having a
[16:10] good house having a family a wonderful
[16:12] church you really get in the routine to
[16:14] where it's just
[16:16] church
[16:17] family and work but i'm really grateful
[16:20] for this trip because it really helped
[16:21] me get out of that routine and realize
[16:23] that there's people there's lies there's
[16:26] and god is working
[16:28] not just over here but worldwide so i'm
[16:30] really grateful for that
[16:32] and during the fellowship there were
[16:34] many wonderful testimonies that we heard
[16:37] and and then again we went when we went
[16:39] to lithuania i got to visit my sister so
[16:42] that was really nice i haven't seen her
[16:44] for
[16:45] i don't know probably over seven or
[16:47] eight years i'm not quite sure but it's
[16:49] been a while i got to meet all my nieces
[16:52] and nephews
[16:54] and then during the fellowship over
[16:55] there and the brothers and sisters in
[16:58] lithuania very like
[17:00] they love fellowship so there are two
[17:02] times both the nights that we spent over
[17:05] there we stayed up until 2 or 3 a.m so
[17:08] yeah they really love fellowship
[17:11] and during the fellowships
[17:13] again by god's grace i was able to help
[17:15] a little bit with translations and
[17:18] again meet the people
[17:20] and
[17:21] have a wonderful time around the word
[17:23] because the preaching was amazing just
[17:26] wonderful i even told brother chad how
[17:29] why didn't you preach like this at home
[17:31] like brother chad
[17:34] but then again i understand that he
[17:35] takes a lot from what we have over here
[17:39] and brothers and sisters i do want to
[17:41] say that the word that we have over here
[17:43] is so precious and it's so wonderful
[17:46] that i'm very very grateful and
[17:50] i thank god for it because it's god it's
[17:53] god using his gifts if it wasn't for god
[17:55] then there was wouldn't be anything to
[17:57] breach it would be just information
[18:00] and just bible verses that everyone
[18:03] reads every sunday worldwide
[18:06] so i'm really grateful for the word
[18:08] and especially during
[18:10] during the fellowships that we had it
[18:13] was a very wonderful time because
[18:15] especially during the fellowships you
[18:16] could you could ask personal questions
[18:18] or you could ask questions that you
[18:20] didn't quite understand
[18:21] and uh and my sister over there she she
[18:25] gave a wonderful testimony she said she
[18:27] was just really rejoicing from the word
[18:29] that was being preached
[18:31] and
[18:32] she had she had a few things that she
[18:35] she was a little it was hard to accept
[18:37] but she knows that it's true but i think
[18:39] every every one of us is usually that
[18:42] way that some things are just
[18:44] hard to get away from and but sometimes
[18:46] we just need to surrender
[18:48] and let god's
[18:49] work in our lives and correct us by the
[18:52] word
[18:53] so i i thank everyone for praying
[18:56] because i we needed it a lot especially
[18:59] me being a russian with the
[19:01] american passport and traveling all
[19:04] along the border and we we didn't i
[19:06] didn't even realize that we're going to
[19:08] be so close to the ukrainian border i
[19:10] think we were only like 15 or 20 miles
[19:12] away so that kind of made me nervous
[19:14] there for a bit but by god's grace are
[19:17] all as well
[19:18] and we thank god for bringing us home
[19:21] and it's wonderful to be home
[19:23] and
[19:24] may god bless you brothers and sisters
[19:27] [Applause]
[19:36] and
[19:37] we had a wonderful time
[19:38] and brother italy was really good to
[19:40] travel with despite causing us a little
[19:43] bit of problems getting
[19:44] out of the airport
[19:45] but he was a treat to have all the way
[19:47] around and you know we had documentation
[19:50] problems and dating flying out and but i
[19:53] knew everything was okay you know it's
[19:55] one of those things you just know it's
[19:56] okay you've seen god work and it was
[19:58] funny on the way down i was talking to
[20:00] brother elia about how you know
[20:02] i tend to get nervous and want all my
[20:04] ducks in a row and i want all details
[20:06] taken care of and if anything goes wrong
[20:08] i kind of get nervous and i i jump too
[20:11] quick and react but when i'm in missions
[20:13] i'm never like that
[20:15] when i'm traveling overseas because i
[20:17] know god called me there i'm always
[20:18] relaxed cool everything works out and so
[20:22] we're there at the first ticketing
[20:24] station in dayton and documentation's
[20:26] not working out and there's a problem
[20:27] with the system and i know it's like i
[20:30] know it's okay
[20:31] and i'm like why can't i be like this
[20:33] every day of my life this is perfect
[20:35] this is the way i think we're supposed
[20:36] to be as christians you know when you're
[20:39] home things are familiar you have this
[20:42] false sense of control
[20:44] like i've been controlling i can fix
[20:45] this i can call somebody i can work it
[20:47] out when you go to some place you hardly
[20:49] speak the language you're traveling in
[20:50] different countries through different
[20:52] borders you know you have no control and
[20:54] you can't help yourself but i really
[20:56] think that's the way god wants us
[20:57] because everything worked out we got on
[21:00] the flight in dayton uh by the time
[21:02] everything was settled out we were good
[21:04] friends with the guy behind the counter
[21:05] his name's david and we were having a
[21:07] good time laughing together and then we
[21:10] got the detroit and all of a sudden they
[21:11] call ilia's name over the speaker and so
[21:13] we go up there i'm traveling with him
[21:15] they pulled us aside and these two large
[21:17] intimidating officers start asking us
[21:19] really hard questions
[21:21] and i was like what's happening they
[21:23] want to know why are you going to poland
[21:25] and i told them we're visiting friends
[21:26] we're doing church services and what's
[21:29] your occupation and they want to know
[21:30] ilia and how much money you're carrying
[21:33] are you going to ukraine i said no we're
[21:34] not going to ukraine like i'm not even
[21:36] thinking that i have a russian spy with
[21:38] me
[21:39] like
[21:41] a double agent he's got a ukrainian
[21:43] passport and a u.s passport and this
[21:46] never entered my mind and i'm so glad
[21:48] because i'd have been nervous but i'm
[21:49] just standing there like as ignorant as
[21:51] you possibly could be that there's
[21:53] anything suspicious going on here
[21:56] and so i just answered all their
[21:57] questions how much money and why this
[21:59] and why that and where are you going and
[22:01] then they want to know where are you
[22:02] going i don't know
[22:04] what's the address i don't know
[22:07] i can't even pronounce the last name of
[22:08] the host pastor
[22:11] it went from bad to worse but but god
[22:13] was good to us and
[22:15] i don't know i guess they figured these
[22:17] poor guys are too ignorant to be up to
[22:19] anything
[22:20] then they they asked us they said when
[22:22] they asked one question just
[22:24] befuddled me they said are you taking
[22:26] any personal protection in the equipment
[22:29] like um what'd they say body armor
[22:32] i looked at the guy
[22:34] i know he probably laughed later i'm
[22:36] like body armor
[22:39] and then like later when we got through
[22:40] it dawned on me what was happening
[22:43] i'm traveling with a russian
[22:45] who grew up in donetsk
[22:47] and he has a us passport and we're going
[22:49] right next to a war zone
[22:52] and i didn't even put two and two
[22:53] together i think sometimes god just puts
[22:55] his hand over your eyes
[22:57] just so you can go and be free and so we
[23:00] we answered all their questions they
[23:01] were nice and they were scolding us
[23:03] about something and i started saying
[23:05] well thank you for telling me that you
[23:07] know now i know for next time
[23:09] it was like
[23:11] gee that was good you know
[23:14] i took my scolding and was nice but then
[23:16] they were nice back to us and then they
[23:18] let us go so we got on the plane and
[23:20] that was a little bit of a rattle you
[23:21] know you get on the plane in detroit to
[23:23] fly away but i saw how god worked it all
[23:25] out like everything worked out when
[23:27] you're innocent everything works out
[23:30] you're not guilty of anything you've not
[23:31] done anything wrong no matter how many
[23:34] questions are asked or what it looks
[23:35] like or how much information you don't
[23:37] have
[23:38] you're innocent
[23:40] your conscience is free you can answer
[23:42] the questions and i said that that's the
[23:44] way i want to live
[23:46] i want to live with a clear conscience
[23:47] where i can always answer the question
[23:49] no matter what it looks like no matter
[23:50] what and somebody misunderstands that i
[23:52] know that i'm free from guilt the lord
[23:55] has set me free and i'm living for him
[23:57] the best i know how so it was good so we
[23:59] got on the plane and
[24:01] traveled over and so we had trouble at
[24:04] every turn
[24:06] we landed in poland and my luggage
[24:08] didn't make it
[24:09] and so we traveled two days to get there
[24:11] and and um
[24:14] and
[24:15] travel we left here on tuesday traveled
[24:17] down dayton flew to detroit out of
[24:18] detroit over to amsterdam amsterdam over
[24:21] to krakow poland
[24:23] but frank oh he's already pulled it up
[24:25] and i said
[24:27] uh so when i got there all of a sudden
[24:29] you know you're standing there at the
[24:30] little conveyor belt and your stuff's
[24:32] going around and it doesn't take long to
[24:34] dawn on you that my luggage has not
[24:35] arrived you know everybody's gone
[24:37] carousel's empty so i went over there
[24:40] and we filed a report and they knew it
[24:41] was in amsterdam they're going to fly it
[24:43] over and drive it but we're driving
[24:45] over two hours away
[24:47] from the airport so so you know whatever
[24:50] it's fine let's go you know we go out
[24:52] and we we see the brothers and brother
[24:55] samuel was there to pick us up with his
[24:56] wife and his little boy brother samuel
[24:59] valwak who was here a little over a
[25:01] month ago by the yautzik sun so it was
[25:03] good to see a familiar face he picked us
[25:05] up and he drove us
[25:07] over
[25:08] we went
[25:09] i'll show you this map of europe really
[25:10] quick so you can get an idea of where we
[25:12] were going
[25:13] you can see this is poland here
[25:15] and this is lithuania just to the north
[25:18] and ukraine just to the east
[25:20] and then surrounded by russia there so
[25:22] you can get an idea of where we were
[25:24] going and when we got to poland we uh
[25:27] warsaw is the capital of poland but we
[25:29] flew into krakow and then we drove over
[25:32] here right next to the ukrainian border
[25:35] in uh volapee
[25:37] pre piatrova i think you have to ask
[25:39] illy how to pronounce it he he doesn't
[25:42] speak polish but he could say their
[25:45] words sometimes so you have to ask him
[25:47] how to pronounce that so we drove over
[25:49] here to the service that we had service
[25:51] there so i had i just went to the pulpit
[25:54] and whatever i wore from tuesday all
[25:56] night in the plane wednesday and and i
[25:59] didn't look like much of a preacher but
[26:01] we thank god that he helped us with the
[26:03] service there and then the next day the
[26:05] luggage did show up
[26:07] then after that we drove back to krakow
[26:09] over to this other uh village here where
[26:12] where the attic's church is and then um
[26:14] eventually we made our way up to vilnius
[26:16] up here in lithuania so you can see
[26:18] where we travel
[26:19] the first church we stopped at
[26:21] a pastor's name is brother bogdan and
[26:24] this is a fellowship that's that's come
[26:26] together here in just the last i think
[26:28] just a little over a year ago and
[26:30] they've got a nice place they've been
[26:31] renovating their church and we had
[26:33] really nice services there
[26:36] we landed wednesday had service
[26:37] wednesday and then had service thursday
[26:39] evening and there's a group of ukrainian
[26:42] refugees that have made their way over
[26:45] to this church out of ukraine and it's
[26:47] the brother here and these sisters with
[26:49] ilia there was 12 of them all together
[26:52] that are in the fellowship there at the
[26:53] church
[26:54] and like ilya said when we got there
[26:57] they had nobody to do the russian uh
[26:59] interpretation russian translation of
[27:01] the services so immediately they asked
[27:03] ilya right off the bat like we got off
[27:05] the plane we just drove to the brother's
[27:07] house we had a brief fellowship before
[27:09] going to the church and they asked him
[27:11] so he got thrown in the deep end but
[27:14] praise god
[27:15] about a month i think it was or a few
[27:17] weeks before we left we had brother
[27:18] anatoly from uzbekistan come
[27:21] and elia had to go to the booth and do
[27:23] the translation of that service so god
[27:25] had already prepared the way
[27:27] and so he got thrown into the deep end
[27:29] he stood in the back of the church
[27:30] behind the several rows that they were
[27:32] in and and translated for them he had an
[27:35] earpiece where he could hear the the
[27:37] preaching and then he translated and
[27:39] they sat close enough to him they could
[27:40] hear him and they all said it was
[27:42] excellent excellent translation they
[27:44] understood everything and he did a very
[27:46] amazing job so god really blessed our
[27:50] brother and really confirmed that he's
[27:52] an interpreter
[27:54] he can do it amen it was confirmed and
[27:56] we were really thankful for that and
[27:58] they were the believers were blessed
[28:00] just to meet him and blessed be able to
[28:01] communicate and be able to hear the
[28:03] services so we had a really nice time
[28:06] here's one of the fellowships afterwards
[28:08] the brother in the middle there is
[28:09] brother bogdan he's the pastor there and
[28:11] you see brother samuel and elia and all
[28:13] the way to the other side is peter he's
[28:15] one of the ministers there and was a
[28:17] song leader as well in that local
[28:19] assembly
[28:20] here we had on the way back to brother
[28:22] bogdan's house we stopped off at the
[28:23] city center
[28:24] everything in europe is older than
[28:26] america every building in the city
[28:28] center is older than america they're
[28:30] four or five hundred years old so he
[28:32] took me down to the city center and
[28:34] that's brother bogdan and his son there
[28:35] and his wife so he wanted to show us the
[28:38] center of the square
[28:39] this is one of the fellowships that we
[28:41] had after the second service uh it's
[28:44] amazing that you go to minister the word
[28:47] and and like ilia says it's better than
[28:49] at home apparently so you all have to
[28:51] come with me
[28:53] but i he asked me that question you know
[28:55] why don't you preach like that at home i
[28:57] said all these sermons are birthed at
[28:59] home you know that's where they're
[29:01] birthed amen but but all of a sudden god
[29:03] will put like four or five together for
[29:05] one so it's like condensed amen and so
[29:09] and and the atmosphere is really rich
[29:11] everybody was excited and it was a nice
[29:14] time and we we really had good services
[29:16] all through there i think we were there
[29:19] with the believers there for uh
[29:22] about eight days
[29:24] and we had about three days of travel we
[29:25] were there with him eight days and
[29:27] preached seven services so we had
[29:29] services all the time
[29:30] here you can see i'm looking at brother
[29:32] ilya he's i think he's either sharing a
[29:34] testimony here he might be translating
[29:35] for brother bogdan so brother bogdan
[29:38] didn't speak very much english but he
[29:40] could speak a little bit of russian so
[29:42] he would speak russian and italy would
[29:43] uh interpret back and forth so he was
[29:46] busy all the time he helped out with a
[29:47] lot of conversations in fact it was just
[29:50] god who ordained that he would go on
[29:52] this trip because brother elmer was
[29:53] going to try to go with me and it just
[29:55] didn't work out for brother um he
[29:56] couldn't make it work and he felt bad
[29:59] but then all of a sudden in the last
[30:01] moment god dropped ilya in my heart and
[30:03] without thinking i just asked him and he
[30:05] had a couple days to think about it and
[30:07] he said yes and the day he said yes he
[30:09] had 24 hours to make all his
[30:10] arrangements
[30:12] and they all came together they all came
[30:14] together perfect and throughout the trip
[30:16] i could see that that was god's ordained
[30:18] way that it was needful we needed him on
[30:20] the trip he needed to be there for the
[30:22] believers he needed to be there to help
[30:23] me and it was excellent and it's amazing
[30:27] so you go to preach services but you
[30:28] don't realize how much is accomplished
[30:30] during the fellowship
[30:32] it's fellowships like this with
[30:34] ministers and pastors where
[30:37] we're all growing do you gain so much
[30:40] and i gain things for me personally and
[30:42] i gain things for us as an assembly
[30:44] sometimes in these fellowships because
[30:45] you see things from another angle you
[30:47] hear things from another point of view
[30:49] and it really broadens your
[30:51] understanding many times or even opens a
[30:53] door that had never been opened to you
[30:55] before out of the word and so the these
[30:58] fellowships sometimes are just just as
[31:02] important for me as the preaching of the
[31:04] word and so they're really a blessing
[31:06] for the believers over there as well
[31:09] on the way back we stopped by krakow
[31:11] krakow is a uh it's a neat town it's a
[31:14] big city and it survived world war ii
[31:16] most of the buildings did so it's it's
[31:19] one of those european cities that are
[31:20] still intact so where they took us
[31:22] through a trip through there and it was
[31:23] really nice to see then that was friday
[31:26] we traveled the rest of the way from
[31:27] krakow down to brother
[31:29] miatak's place and this is brother
[31:31] yossik's church during the worship
[31:33] service they they used the opportunity
[31:36] at kova they went through some coveted
[31:37] restrictions and had to reduce the
[31:39] number of people gathering so they took
[31:41] advantage of that opportunity to remodel
[31:43] their church so their church is just
[31:44] recently remodeled and they did a
[31:46] beautiful job
[31:47] we had some fellowship after the service
[31:50] with brother nathan remember when
[31:51] brother yatsek was here he brought
[31:52] brother nathan and he sang two specials
[31:54] here and if you look there at the end of
[31:56] the table it's him and his wife there
[31:57] brother yatzik and his wife one of the
[31:59] deacons and his children there and we
[32:01] had a really nice fellowship it was good
[32:03] to see nathan and nathan wanted me to be
[32:05] sure to tell you all he said hello
[32:07] and it's the same thing with everybody
[32:08] we met there
[32:10] so this is the service there by the odd
[32:12] sex brother samuel he interpreted for me
[32:15] he actually picked us up and drove us
[32:17] over to brother bogdan's church and uh
[32:20] they have an interpreter there but the
[32:22] interpreter was going to lead songs that
[32:23] night so they just had better samuel do
[32:25] it so so brother samuel was pulling
[32:27] double duty so he interpreted two
[32:29] services there three services with
[32:31] brother yatzik we had a saturday evening
[32:34] and two
[32:35] and two on sunday with him here's a view
[32:38] of the rest of the church they just did
[32:40] a real fantastic job this church used to
[32:43] be a nightclub way back
[32:45] and so people now hear the word on the
[32:47] dance floor
[32:49] that's the proper repurposing of the
[32:51] devil's building to god's purposes so
[32:54] they made it really beautiful they've
[32:55] done a good job
[32:57] there's uh several ukrainian families
[32:59] that have you relocated to brother
[33:01] yahtzek's church and they're getting
[33:03] established some housing and things set
[33:05] up for them there and this is a brother
[33:07] arthur this is a brother that ilia and
[33:09] his family knew from back in his days in
[33:12] donetsk and this brother was
[33:14] in bulgaria
[33:17] with his work for many years but last
[33:19] year a year ago
[33:21] he felt the move work asked him to move
[33:22] i believe and he and he's in poland and
[33:25] he's been brother yatzik's church for a
[33:27] year before the war broke out and the
[33:29] war broke out and many uh ukrainians
[33:32] fled and and several families were there
[33:34] with brother yatzik and this brother
[33:35] does all the interpreting for them he
[33:37] understands english well he's learned
[33:39] polish and russian and so before those
[33:42] believers ever got there they had the
[33:44] interpreter there a year ahead of time
[33:46] so he could get good with the polish
[33:48] language
[33:49] it's amazing how god provides everything
[33:52] all the time
[33:55] monday we had a day of rest um brother
[33:57] yatzik took us to the
[33:59] city center the town square there in the
[34:01] little village where they're at and
[34:03] we're up on this little platform that's
[34:05] in the city square
[34:07] and he's showing me you can see his
[34:08] hands in the air he's demonstrating that
[34:11] every year before kovad they would they
[34:13] would rent this place out and they would
[34:15] have outreach meetings they would sing
[34:17] and give testimonies and short sermons
[34:20] and have different brothers sing and
[34:21] different people speak and share
[34:23] testimonies and there would be a crowd
[34:25] gathered up there because this is a
[34:26] tourist area in the summer there's
[34:28] always people there
[34:29] and he said one year
[34:31] they have a security camera that you can
[34:34] get online and you can look at the
[34:36] city center square camera and see what's
[34:38] going on in the city center the
[34:40] government has us
[34:41] set up and there were some believers
[34:43] that were watching these meetings as
[34:44] they took place and they saw a cloud
[34:47] come over and descend right over this
[34:48] platform
[34:49] on the camera and then the cloud moved
[34:51] out and went down into the people and
[34:53] there was uh i guess uh that was
[34:55] witnessed by them and maybe others i
[34:57] don't remember so he's explaining that
[34:58] to me there it was really a supernatural
[35:01] event during that outreach meeting
[35:03] so it was a nice day that was monday
[35:05] then tuesday we traveled
[35:08] back up to
[35:10] vilnius so you can see we went from
[35:13] volopia trova over here and then we flew
[35:17] from krakow to warsaw warsaw to vin
[35:19] vilnius got there on tuesday
[35:22] i
[35:23] threw all of my uh
[35:25] communication back and forth with
[35:26] brother vitale brother pavel was
[35:28] communicating through brother vitale
[35:30] he told me that they have a wednesday
[35:32] night service and that they asked me to
[35:33] come preach the wednesday night service
[35:35] so i'm prepared to preach the wednesday
[35:37] night service
[35:39] so monday night before we leave brother
[35:41] ilia he's been talking to a sister his
[35:42] sister lives there and he says brother
[35:45] chad i'm afraid to tell you this
[35:48] he said i think they scheduled a service
[35:50] for tuesday night
[35:52] i said oh lord help me
[35:54] so sure enough when we landed they said
[35:56] you got about an hour and a half before
[35:58] church starts
[35:59] so
[36:00] and of course our flight was delayed and
[36:02] and they were short staffed and uh
[36:05] whatever could happen happen so we get
[36:07] there late and we pretty much just run
[36:09] to get a bite to eat and run to the
[36:11] church and change clothes and go
[36:13] straight to the pulpit
[36:14] but god blessed us it was a real treat
[36:16] for brother ilya he got to see a sister
[36:19] hadn't seen her for a long time and he's
[36:21] got two nephews there and a niece that
[36:22] he's never met before so it was neat to
[36:25] see his sister his sister her name
[36:27] sister rima she was so excited ilya was
[36:30] there she was just beaming and so i had
[36:32] a good time watching how excited she was
[36:34] and how much these children enjoyed
[36:37] italy every time we were near them they
[36:38] were coming over to him and talking to
[36:40] him and getting in his lap so it was a
[36:42] really nice time and so he got to spend
[36:44] a couple days there with his sister
[36:47] this is the church there in vilnius
[36:49] where brother pablo steppenie goes to
[36:51] pastor
[36:52] you can see from the back there and up
[36:54] closer a bit of a tally he translated
[36:57] both of the services we had there we had
[36:58] a tuesday evening and a wednesday
[37:00] evening service
[37:02] and and it was really nice we had a
[37:04] really nice meetings there really nice
[37:05] times a fellowship there as well
[37:08] and then there's a picture of brother
[37:09] paulville and i
[37:11] brother pavel says he's got many friends
[37:12] over here and he wants me to send
[37:14] greetings to you all brother yatzik
[37:16] wanted me to send greetings to you all
[37:18] and brother samuel wanted me to bring
[37:20] greetings to you all brother vitale
[37:22] wanted me to bring greetings to y'all
[37:23] brother dima and then so many others but
[37:27] it'll be it was really a wonderful time
[37:30] the fellowship was wonderful
[37:32] the
[37:33] the times we spent together around
[37:35] tables eating and fellowshipping the
[37:37] times and services we really had a good
[37:39] time and we really benefited by the trip
[37:42] and i'm really thankful that brother
[37:44] italy was able to go because it was so
[37:46] good
[37:47] to see god pick him up carry him over
[37:50] use him for his kingdom and and
[37:53] you know two weeks before we left a
[37:55] little over two weeks before we left he
[37:57] had no idea he was going so god can do
[37:59] things quickly in our lives that we
[38:01] never expected and from the routine of
[38:04] life like he said through getting
[38:06] plucked up carried over to the other
[38:08] side of the globe and used for the
[38:09] kingdom of god can be a matter of what
[38:12] 15 days
[38:14] so for 15 days so no matter what's going
[38:16] on in life god has a way of turning keys
[38:19] that you never expected to turn opening
[38:21] doors we never expected to open and and
[38:24] it's just been a tremendous blessing to
[38:26] have him along and the fellowship him
[38:28] and i shared along the way was really
[38:30] comforting it's just nice to have
[38:31] somebody from home somebody familiar
[38:34] somebody you can just fellowship with so
[38:36] we had a really good time so thank you
[38:38] brother ilia thank you for going along i
[38:40] appreciate sister natasha for being
[38:42] brave
[38:43] and the children for doing without their
[38:45] daddy for a while but we really enjoyed
[38:48] having him there also we appreciate all
[38:50] of you all for praying for us we needed
[38:52] it
[38:53] we really needed it we saw so many
[38:55] obstacles but we saw god open every door
[38:58] one after the other after the other and
[39:00] we could just relax and know that we
[39:02] were in his hand
[39:04] so it was good
[39:05] we met several of the um ukrainian
[39:08] refugees
[39:09] especially brother bogdan's place
[39:11] brother got to spend some time talking
[39:13] with them
[39:14] and
[39:15] also we saw several in um brother
[39:18] yatzik's place and then we went to
[39:19] villeneuster helping out with a lot of
[39:22] the ukrainian churches there so
[39:24] the brothers and sisters here from this
[39:26] church have been donating to the
[39:28] missions fund for ukraine so ilya and i
[39:30] were able to take all that cash with us
[39:32] almost all of it and we were able to
[39:34] distribute it through those three
[39:35] churches to help the ukrainian believers
[39:37] that are there and all the efforts that
[39:40] those churches are doing so god bless
[39:42] you for the contribution and and i know
[39:44] it was a help for them it was a blessing
[39:46] it took some of the burden off the local
[39:48] churches that are trying to find housing
[39:50] and accommodations and and care for
[39:51] these families so it was just it was a
[39:54] real blessing to be on this trip all the
[39:56] way around every part of it every facet
[39:59] was just a tremendous blessing so we
[40:03] came back from vilnius thursday night
[40:05] stayed in the hotel at the airport
[40:06] thursday got up early flew all day
[40:08] friday got home friday evening and boy
[40:11] we were tired
[40:13] and i'm still just a little tired amen
[40:17] jet lag is uh is real
[40:20] it's not a myth it's real
[40:22] but god's been good to us and i'm happy
[40:24] to be here
[40:25] i mean if we all stand i'd like to read
[40:27] a scripture and just look into the word
[40:29] not for a very long time i've just got a
[40:31] short thought some golden nuggets that
[40:33] god's been dropping into my heart that i
[40:34] just want to share with you
[40:37] let's turn to john chapter 16.
[40:43] verse 12.
[40:44] john chapter 16 verse 12.
[40:52] i'm going to read from verse 12
[40:54] to verse 15.
[40:57] jesus speaking says i have yet many
[40:59] things to say unto you but you cannot
[41:01] bear them now
[41:02] how be it when he the spirit of truth
[41:04] has come he will guide you into all
[41:06] truth for you shall not speak of himself
[41:08] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[41:10] he speak and he will show you things to
[41:12] come
[41:13] you shall glorify me for he shall
[41:15] receive a mind and shall show it unto
[41:17] you
[41:18] all things that the father hath are mine
[41:20] therefore said i that he shall take of
[41:22] mine and shall show it
[41:24] unto you
[41:26] let's bow our heads
[41:27] lord jesus as we
[41:29] look into your word i pray god that you
[41:31] would come
[41:32] and anoint this vessel lord take these
[41:35] lips of clay and speak eternal words
[41:38] god we've heard of how good you've been
[41:40] in our trip and how much you've taken
[41:42] care of us and taking care of the church
[41:44] in our absence lord as we come together
[41:46] to feast upon your word i pray god that
[41:48] you would make yourself manifest among
[41:51] us by the breaking of bread
[41:52] god may we receive a portion for today
[41:55] and may we go home joyful lord that
[41:57] you're on the throne lord and that
[41:59] you're giving to us the bread of life i
[42:02] pray god you would take preeminence and
[42:04] speak your word in jesus christ's name
[42:06] we pray
[42:07] amen
[42:08] and you can all be seated
[42:11] thank you
[42:15] when we look at this uh john 16 brother
[42:18] branham uses this scripture when he
[42:20] opens the subject when he's preaching at
[42:22] night he's preaching october 1962 on the
[42:25] subject a guide
[42:26] so
[42:27] uh that that uh
[42:30] i just read that that um service i read
[42:33] the book
[42:34] and really really enjoyed it and what
[42:36] triggered my mind thinking down this is
[42:38] something brother samuel valwalk and i
[42:41] were talking about he just made a couple
[42:42] statements from the message a guide and
[42:45] it just really i was meditating on it
[42:47] really one of those things you know you
[42:48] hear somebody say something and it just
[42:50] clicks inside of you and i've been
[42:52] meditating on it for days and just knew
[42:55] i knew after the first day i was
[42:57] meditating on i knew i'd come home and
[42:58] preach it and so i've just enjoyed going
[43:01] through that message so most every quote
[43:03] that i'm going to use this morning is
[43:04] from that message a guide and i think
[43:06] it'd be a good one to listen to or read
[43:08] this week it's from october
[43:10] 1962. and it really has been a blessing
[43:13] to me
[43:15] but brother branham in this message he
[43:16] opens with this scripture
[43:18] showing that the spirit of truth the
[43:20] holy spirit that will come he's also the
[43:22] comforter he will guide you into all
[43:25] truth and brother graham starts talking
[43:26] about our guide is this holy spirit the
[43:29] spirit of truth is our guide through
[43:31] life and so
[43:34] he starts breaking down the what a guide
[43:37] is and he starts talking about a guide
[43:39] in the wilderness on a hunting trip and
[43:41] and how if you go into unfamiliar
[43:42] territory you take a hunting guide and
[43:45] he'll help you find the game and help
[43:46] you be successful and take care of you
[43:48] and help you get home safe and and so he
[43:50] starts to go into all of that and i just
[43:53] want to read some quotes and and share
[43:55] some thoughts from this
[43:56] the first quote in the guide he says now
[43:59] here we are a guide and he is god's
[44:02] provided guide and we're going through a
[44:04] wilderness and we're on our road
[44:06] somewhere and we can't get along without
[44:08] this guide
[44:09] and dare anybody try to substitute any
[44:12] other guide
[44:13] that's an amazing statement because we
[44:15] know as we walk through this journey we
[44:17] need a guide
[44:18] and god's provided a guide but so many
[44:20] people allow other things to guide them
[44:22] in this wilderness of life
[44:24] and brother branham said how dare we
[44:26] substitute any other guide for the guide
[44:29] that god gave us
[44:31] and it's amazing how quickly and easily
[44:33] we'll let something guide us we'll let
[44:34] education guide us we'll let media guide
[44:37] us we'll let friends guide us we'll let
[44:39] family relationships guide us but god
[44:42] says there's only one guide for this
[44:43] journey and that guide is the holy ghost
[44:48] he said if you do if you if you get
[44:50] another guide if you do he'll take you
[44:53] off the line meaning the other guy
[44:55] this guy knows the way he knows every
[44:57] inch of the way he knows every thought
[44:59] that's in your heart he knows everybody
[45:01] that's here he knows who you are and
[45:03] what you've done and all about you he's
[45:05] god's guide the holy spirit and will
[45:07] reveal things to you and will tell you
[45:09] things that he's heard can repeat your
[45:11] words right back and say what you said
[45:13] amen
[45:14] tell you what you've been
[45:16] what you've been in what you've got and
[45:18] where you're going a guide the correct
[45:20] guide and he will guide you to all truth
[45:23] and his word is truth
[45:26] it was interesting in one of the
[45:28] fellowships that we had with the
[45:29] brothers from lithuania we were talking
[45:32] to uh
[45:33] brother um
[45:35] vitale and he shared a really
[45:37] interesting perspective that i didn't
[45:39] think about but he said in their
[45:41] churches they have fellowship with a lot
[45:42] of churches and a lot of that area of
[45:44] the world they have fellowship with
[45:46] churches in poland fellowship with
[45:48] churches in latvia fellowship with
[45:49] churches in russia and belarus and
[45:52] ukraine and other parts of europe
[45:55] and as they're fellowshipping he says
[45:58] all of a sudden you can begin to see
[46:00] when the war broke out you can you can
[46:03] begin to see everybody's perspective on
[46:06] the war depended on what media they were
[46:09] listening to
[46:11] in belarus
[46:12] in russia ukraine
[46:14] poland latvia lithuania wherever they
[46:17] were their view about the war war was
[46:20] shaped by the news media they were
[46:22] listening to
[46:23] and they would have sometimes polar
[46:25] opposite ideas
[46:27] about the conflict
[46:29] and so they spent some time sharing with
[46:32] the brethren there and sharing in the
[46:34] fellowship
[46:35] that that media is not our source for
[46:37] truth
[46:39] media is not where we gain truth and
[46:41] perspective amen because you can begin
[46:44] to see you have believers who believe
[46:45] the same message they love one another
[46:48] they have the the same spiritual goals
[46:50] they have the spay spiritual diet but
[46:53] because they have a diet of worldly
[46:55] media
[46:56] now i would just like to share this with
[46:58] you the american media is not correct
[47:02] and everybody else is wrong
[47:04] right because in russia they think their
[47:06] media is correct and the american media
[47:08] is wrong
[47:09] they are all wrong
[47:12] i would love to i'd like to stress that
[47:14] they are all wrong
[47:17] media is a form of entertainment
[47:20] all right it's the entertainment
[47:22] industry that's why they sell
[47:23] advertising
[47:25] and they want to tell you what you want
[47:28] to hear so you keep listening
[47:30] that's why the story line in fox is a
[47:32] little different than storyline and cnn
[47:34] because they have different
[47:37] bases they have different people they're
[47:38] appealing to
[47:40] so they present the news attractive to a
[47:42] certain demographic who will listen to
[47:44] the news and then it becomes popular and
[47:47] they sell advertising time it's a form
[47:49] of media it's a form of entertainment
[47:52] so it's not the place to get truth
[47:55] this is the place to get truth
[47:57] the message is true amen
[48:00] and we need to make sure that we have
[48:02] the right guide in life that we don't
[48:03] let media we don't let news we don't let
[48:06] co-workers we don't let conspiracy
[48:08] theories we don't let all of these
[48:10] things shape our thinking amen our mind
[48:13] is so fragile
[48:15] do you believe that the human mind is
[48:17] fragile
[48:18] our mind is so fragile and we are so
[48:21] easily influenced that we have to be
[48:23] very careful with what we listen to what
[48:25] we read and what we watch
[48:27] and we have to make sure that the
[48:29] leadership that we're getting in every
[48:32] thought process through life
[48:34] comes from the word of god
[48:36] how we feel about our families how we
[48:38] feel about our work how we feel about
[48:40] the country we live in how we feel about
[48:42] everything that's going on must come
[48:44] from the word of god if not we will get
[48:46] the wrong perspective and anti-word
[48:49] perspective and we'll open ourselves to
[48:51] that and it will begin to shape our
[48:52] thinking in a way that's anti-word
[48:56] so we have to be very careful that we
[48:57] keep the right guide
[48:59] that we don't let media become our guide
[49:01] that our cell phones don't become our
[49:02] guide that the expert at work doesn't
[49:04] become our guide
[49:06] it's amazing that you know you can be a
[49:08] tradesman you can be a fabricator and
[49:10] and you know right brother brian you can
[49:13] be a fabricator and the guy next to you
[49:14] who has the same level of education
[49:16] who's doing the same kind of welding
[49:18] work he's all of a sudden the political
[49:21] expert
[49:22] and he knows everything about the world
[49:24] and how the world works and nobody else
[49:25] knows it
[49:27] don't let him be your guide
[49:29] don't let
[49:30] don't let any of these things don't let
[49:32] the government don't let anything become
[49:34] our guide but let's let the holy ghost
[49:37] guide us in the word and that's our
[49:38] guide amen
[49:40] brother ben said you better stay behind
[49:42] the word
[49:43] the word will lead you across because
[49:45] the word is christ and christ is god and
[49:48] god is the holy ghost
[49:50] i'm going to read that again
[49:52] because that will break up some wrong
[49:53] thinking
[49:56] the word will lead you across because
[49:57] the word is christ
[49:59] okay say the word is christ
[50:02] christ is god
[50:04] christ is god
[50:05] god is the holy ghost
[50:08] so which is which
[50:10] praise be to god
[50:13] stay behind the word oh yes sir stay
[50:15] with that guide stay right behind it
[50:18] don't get in front of it you stay behind
[50:20] it let it lead you don't you lead it you
[50:23] let it go
[50:24] so the holy ghost is our guide and the
[50:26] holy ghost is god the holy ghost is the
[50:28] word the holy ghost is christ these are
[50:30] all the same thing and the holy ghost is
[50:32] the spirit of the word the spirit of
[50:34] christ amen here to guide us in the word
[50:37] and it said let the word go first and
[50:39] you follow the word amen let the word
[50:41] and the spirit of the word be the guide
[50:43] amen not anything else be our god
[50:46] we have to we have to come back to being
[50:49] like brother brandon brother ben said we
[50:51] are not americans we are christians
[50:55] we're not russians or belarusians or
[50:57] ukrainians or or americans or canadians
[51:00] we are christians amen and christians
[51:03] live by the word amen we live in a
[51:05] heavenly kingdom and that heaven in
[51:07] heaven is consistent of the word so
[51:09] everything is the word amen we don't
[51:11] want anything else so we we sometimes
[51:14] pick up ideas we pick up concepts and we
[51:16] don't mean to amen
[51:18] we pick them up through just living in
[51:20] the world just walking in the world
[51:22] conversing with people hearing things
[51:24] that those ideas come in but we have to
[51:26] make sure that every one of those ideas
[51:28] are subject to the truth and the truth
[51:31] is the word
[51:33] brother madam starts telling a story
[51:36] and he
[51:37] talks about an unfaithful father this is
[51:40] in the message the guide
[51:41] and he starts to tell about this and
[51:43] i'll read this brief quote here he said
[51:44] an unfaithful father two years ago in
[51:46] colorado oh he was going up into the
[51:50] mountains he had a little boy about six
[51:51] seven years old he was going to take him
[51:54] on his first deer hunt
[51:56] and brother brandon starts to talk about
[51:58] the unthoughtful father how
[52:00] he he wants to go up into the rocks he's
[52:02] got this little boy he's taking this
[52:04] little boy on his first hunt and they
[52:06] get up there and he wants to go higher
[52:08] and higher and and the little boy's
[52:10] getting tired but his dad's pushing him
[52:11] because you know we want the we want to
[52:13] get to the big deer up at the at the top
[52:16] of the mountain and brother branham said
[52:17] the man didn't know what he was doing
[52:18] because the deer aren't up there amen
[52:20] and so
[52:22] they get up there and it begins to get
[52:23] late
[52:24] and a quick rain sweeps in and the rain
[52:27] comes in and they get soaking wet and
[52:29] then a wind starts to blow across the
[52:31] mountain then darkness sets in and the
[52:32] father can't find his way back down the
[52:35] mountain and finally they're lost and
[52:37] they're cold and the wind's blowing
[52:39] they're wet and they finally sit down
[52:41] and he hugs this little boy to his chest
[52:43] as a little six seven-year-old boy and
[52:44] they're sitting there freezing to death
[52:46] and he said the unthoughtful father
[52:48] holds the little boy as he feels life
[52:50] leave his body and his body goes cold
[52:53] and the boy dies in his father's arms
[52:56] and brother ben said if the man would
[52:58] have hired a guide somebody who knew the
[53:01] terrain knew the mountain knew the signs
[53:03] new safety new security knew how to some
[53:06] survival skills he said his son would
[53:09] have lived
[53:10] but the death of his son
[53:12] was a father who thought he could do it
[53:14] himself
[53:16] the death of the son was a father who
[53:18] thought he could find his own way make
[53:19] his own way that he was sufficient that
[53:22] he was intelligent that he was capable
[53:25] and the son died because he had a father
[53:27] who was self-sufficient
[53:29] the son died because he had a father who
[53:31] was self-confident
[53:33] the son died because he had a father who
[53:35] could take care of things
[53:37] and this son no doubt had absolute
[53:39] confidence in his daddy
[53:41] but his daddy was a foolish man
[53:44] he went into unfamiliar territory he was
[53:46] not an expert he was too self-sufficient
[53:48] too self-secure he was too bold he was
[53:51] too brash he was too self-confident and
[53:54] it caused the death of his little boy
[53:56] but if he would have put his hands his
[53:59] life into the hands of a guide someone
[54:01] who knew
[54:02] who knew how to survive on that mountain
[54:04] knew his way around knew the routes up
[54:06] knew the rounds down knew where the deer
[54:07] was amen that man would have got the
[54:10] game he went after and him and his boy
[54:12] would have survived and come down with a
[54:14] wonderful story to tell of how wonderful
[54:16] god was amen but instead it brought
[54:18] death
[54:20] and
[54:21] and we as fathers and we as mothers and
[54:24] we as leaders in the church we have to
[54:26] follow the guide amen
[54:28] because if we think that we can do it
[54:30] amen we will bring death not life
[54:32] as a mommy and a daddy you better have
[54:35] the guide amen you better not be going
[54:37] through this life amen because we're
[54:38] going down roads we've never went down
[54:40] before we're walking past we've never
[54:42] went to before amen we know we're at the
[54:45] end time and the end time is a very
[54:47] tricky time a very slippery time amen
[54:50] and we see things degrading all around
[54:52] us amen and we need a guide
[54:55] we must have a guide and don't be a
[54:57] daddy with no guide for your family
[54:59] don't be a mommy with no guide for your
[55:01] family because you may think
[55:03] everything's okay everything was fine
[55:06] until the rain came
[55:08] everything was fine until darkness set
[55:10] in and the can when the conditions
[55:13] changed it exposed the inability of the
[55:16] father
[55:18] and as long as everything's fine in our
[55:20] family that daddy's got a job and then
[55:23] mommy's taking care of the kids there's
[55:24] no sickness there's no want there's
[55:26] there's no trial amen everybody feels
[55:29] like we're okay we're doing this we're
[55:31] hunting we're gonna get a deer
[55:32] everything's fine but when the
[55:34] conditions change amen when sickness
[55:36] sets in and when troubles come amen
[55:39] you're going to see your children die
[55:43] too many men thought they didn't need a
[55:45] guide
[55:46] they don't need a guide in my spiritual
[55:48] walk i i don't need a prophet to tell me
[55:50] what to do i don't need a fightful
[55:52] ministry i i don't need anything i can
[55:55] go and find my own way and i have no
[55:57] realize that they're going to have
[55:58] little boys and girls die
[56:00] in their arms spiritually die because
[56:03] they refute god-given guide
[56:06] there's an unfo thoughtful father
[56:09] an unthoughtful mother who will try to
[56:12] lead little children with no holy ghost
[56:14] themselves
[56:16] no spiritual leadership not following
[56:18] the word
[56:19] it'll bring death
[56:22] so
[56:22] brother bram starts to show
[56:24] how much we need a guide
[56:27] how that we're just sheep and men sheep
[56:29] can't find their own way they need a
[56:31] shepherd and what is a shepherd a
[56:33] shepherd as a guide
[56:35] amen
[56:36] and and there's no point in in in
[56:38] pretending pretending won't get
[56:40] get anybody anywhere i mean the world's
[56:43] full of pretenders
[56:45] everybody's pretending they're capable
[56:46] of pretending they're smart pretending
[56:48] they're experts and i mean because you
[56:50] can google every subject and have an
[56:52] answer it doesn't make you intelligent
[56:54] it doesn't make you an expert amen and
[56:56] and so we've we've we're growing into
[56:58] this self-sufficiency because all the
[57:00] tools we have
[57:02] available credit information all of
[57:05] these things that we have we're growing
[57:07] into a level of self-sufficiency that's
[57:09] not healthy
[57:12] the best thing god can do for us is just
[57:13] to break some of our support systems
[57:17] and you realize i need a guide
[57:20] i need somebody to show me the way
[57:23] i need somebody to tell me where to take
[57:25] my next step because i don't know
[57:30] and the and the guy brother bam starts
[57:31] to talk about a story a hunting trip
[57:33] that he went on for his honeymoon
[57:36] and he says
[57:37] i got one time where i thought that i
[57:39] was kind of a good once woodsman
[57:41] you know hunted so much i thought i'm
[57:44] just fool proof
[57:45] nobody's gonna you can't lose me
[57:50] oh i love how honest the prophet of god
[57:53] is
[57:55] he says my mom was half indian and i
[57:57] love that oh my you can't lose me in the
[57:59] woods i know where i'm at
[58:02] and off my honeymoon i i kind of cheated
[58:04] a little bit on the wife i told her you
[58:06] know honey i'd be going
[58:09] it'd be a good thing for us to get
[58:10] married on october 23rd because of
[58:12] course that's when the lord told me to

[58:18] over by niagara falls and go over on the
[58:20] adirondack and do a little hunting so
[58:22] see i so i took her and billy and
[58:25] and he was just a little bitty thing and
[58:26] so i had to take her on a honeymoon and
[58:28] it was on a hunting trip too you know so
[58:30] i thought that'd be a good thing to do
[58:34] praise the lord mita was a wonderful
[58:36] woman
[58:37] that is all i can say she was special
[58:39] built woman
[58:41] he decided to combine his honeymoon in a
[58:43] hunting trip because he didn't have
[58:44] money for both and so i say god built
[58:47] that woman very special and i hope she
[58:49] has tons of rewards in heaven amen
[58:52] but
[58:53] but
[58:54] brother ben you know and he starts
[58:55] convincing her i love how honesty is he
[58:57] starts saying i started telling her
[58:59] wouldn't it be good to have some meat
[59:00] you know it'd save us a lot of money we
[59:01] need some wheat for this winter and of
[59:03] course she's like sure fine you know go
[59:05] get some meat and really he wanted to go
[59:07] hunting
[59:09] so
[59:09] he goes up and he starts talking about
[59:11] this place that he had hunted the year
[59:13] before and he was going to go back and
[59:14] there was a cabin
[59:16] at the top of the mountain and there was
[59:17] a little lean to they were going to meet
[59:19] the man there who had the key to it but
[59:21] they got there a day early and so they
[59:23] weren't able to get into the cabin but
[59:24] he left mita and billy and he was just a
[59:26] tiny toddler then left him up there and
[59:29] the little lean to on the side of the
[59:31] cabin he was going to go out do a quick
[59:33] hunt and come back that evening
[59:35] and he got on the hunt and here he's
[59:38] he's establishing his mindset before he
[59:40] goes on the hunt
[59:41] his mindset is he's a good woodsman
[59:44] he can't get lost in the woods his
[59:45] mother's half indian and you can't lose
[59:47] me in the woods and when he leaves his
[59:49] wife and his baby in that lean to and he
[59:52] heads off on out down the mountain
[59:54] that's what he's thinking in his mind
[59:56] i'm a good woodsman i'll go out here and
[59:58] get us a bear get us a deer get
[1:00:00] something and come back and won't that
[1:00:02] be fine everything's working out just
[1:00:04] according to my plan amen everything's
[1:00:06] perfect
[1:00:08] but then
[1:00:10] he he goes and he
[1:00:11] he's chasing the the scent of a bear and
[1:00:14] he's moving first he starts chasing a
[1:00:16] panther amen and he starts following a
[1:00:18] panther then he gets a whiff of a bear
[1:00:19] and he moves over the mountain trying to
[1:00:20] locate the bear then he sees a deer a
[1:00:22] big buck and he shoots that deer and he
[1:00:24] goes over and dresses it and he hangs it
[1:00:26] in a tree and he decides that now he's
[1:00:28] going to go back and go up to his wife
[1:00:30] you know it's starting to get a little
[1:00:31] foggy night's coming in so he's going to
[1:00:33] go check on them
[1:00:35] so he takes off and this is what he says
[1:00:37] he says praise god thank you lord jesus
[1:00:39] you've given me my winner's meat praise
[1:00:41] be to god and got my gun and i thought
[1:00:43] i'll go right back up the canyon here
[1:00:45] now and said look here look at here boy
[1:00:48] storm's coming i better get out of here
[1:00:50] and get back over to meet in them i said
[1:00:52] i have to hurry
[1:00:54] up the canyon i went unbuttoned my big
[1:00:55] red coat and i was running up the canyon
[1:00:57] like this around and first thing you
[1:00:59] know i thought my where did i turn off
[1:01:02] wind was already down the trees lapping
[1:01:04] together i thought where did i turn off
[1:01:06] i went around i know i was going right
[1:01:08] straight to hurricane mountain but i
[1:01:10] happened to stop and i was sweating i
[1:01:12] thought what's the matter here i've been
[1:01:14] gone half an hour three quarters and i
[1:01:17] can't find the place i turned off i
[1:01:19] looked up and there hung my deer
[1:01:21] i was right at the same place i thought
[1:01:24] well what did i do
[1:01:27] well i took off again i thought i'll
[1:01:29] make it this time i just wasn't noticing
[1:01:32] he goes off again and says i'll just be
[1:01:34] more careful this time
[1:01:36] i watched every little move everywhere
[1:01:38] watching i kept searching searching
[1:01:39] searching now he's starting to use his
[1:01:42] woodsman ability
[1:01:43] now he's went into a different mode now
[1:01:45] it's not a leisurely walk now he's
[1:01:47] searching he's paying attention he's
[1:01:49] using his craft as a woodsman
[1:01:52] searching searching them clouds coming i
[1:01:54] know a snowstorm was on the road fog
[1:01:56] hanging low and then i began to notice i
[1:01:59] thought i'll go a little further went on
[1:02:01] and on and on and on and i thought well
[1:02:03] this is a strange looked like i've seen
[1:02:05] this place before and i looked and there
[1:02:08] hung my deer
[1:02:11] he said you know what i was on the
[1:02:13] indians call it the death walk
[1:02:15] see you're walking in a circle round and
[1:02:17] around well i thought i was too good a
[1:02:20] guide to ever be lost
[1:02:22] see nothing had to tell me in the woods
[1:02:24] i knowed my way around
[1:02:26] brother branham when he set out on that
[1:02:28] trip
[1:02:30] a little short hunting trip to get
[1:02:31] winter's meat
[1:02:33] he just thought he would go hunt and
[1:02:34] come right back to his wife and his baby
[1:02:37] and he thought he was too good to
[1:02:38] woodsman to ever get lost and he found
[1:02:40] himself he said on what the indians
[1:02:42] called the death walk
[1:02:43] where you go in a big circle and you
[1:02:45] don't know you think you're walking in a
[1:02:47] straight line
[1:02:48] and and you wind up right back in the
[1:02:50] spot where you left
[1:02:52] and that happened to me one time in the
[1:02:54] woods in a small woodlot i wasn't in a
[1:02:56] big woodline i wasn't paying attention
[1:02:58] and i walked in a complete circle i
[1:02:59] didn't even know it was possible till it
[1:03:01] happened to me
[1:03:03] and it was no big deal because all i had
[1:03:04] to do was punch out into the cornfield
[1:03:05] and go home i couldn't get lost because
[1:03:07] there was not enough woods to get lost
[1:03:08] in that's why i was surprised i walked
[1:03:10] in a circle
[1:03:13] brother bam thought he was a woodsman i
[1:03:14] knew i wasn't but that was a big
[1:03:16] confirmation for me
[1:03:19] but he's on a death walk going in a
[1:03:21] circle
[1:03:23] and the death walk
[1:03:25] is that you the death walk is you think
[1:03:28] that you're going places
[1:03:30] you think you're going somewhere and
[1:03:32] you're only going in a circle
[1:03:35] and he says you keep walking and get
[1:03:37] more exhausted walking and get more
[1:03:38] exhausted and you walk in circles until
[1:03:40] finally you're exhausted you're
[1:03:42] dehydrated and you die you expire or you
[1:03:44] go crazy he said many people lose their
[1:03:46] minds and go crazy that way
[1:03:49] and he's on a death walk
[1:03:51] and if you look at this brother ben
[1:03:52] didn't have a guide he thought he was
[1:03:54] the guide
[1:03:56] he thought he was the guide and with no
[1:03:58] guide amen now he's guiding himself but
[1:04:01] he's got himself into a death march
[1:04:04] and to a death walk where he keeps
[1:04:06] walking and he's being more careful he's
[1:04:07] using his skill as a woodsman he's
[1:04:09] watching more carefully i'll go a little
[1:04:11] further and then turn this time and he
[1:04:12] goes a little further and makes his turn
[1:04:14] and he's watching for every place using
[1:04:17] all the skill he has and mother half
[1:04:19] indian him and woodsman amen and what he
[1:04:21] does is he comes right back to that deer
[1:04:23] hanging again
[1:04:25] he does it three times comes right back
[1:04:27] to the deer hanging in and the third
[1:04:29] time he begins to panic he begins to get
[1:04:31] nervous he tries to calm himself down he
[1:04:33] tries to tell himself everything's okay
[1:04:35] he said but there's no bluffing it you
[1:04:36] know inside it's not okay
[1:04:39] and listen churches and denominations
[1:04:41] and individuals can get on death walks
[1:04:43] amen where we think we're going
[1:04:45] somewhere in the gospel we think we're
[1:04:46] really progressing and all we're doing
[1:04:48] is coming right back to the same spot
[1:04:50] right back to the same spot talking
[1:04:52] about the same things going through the
[1:04:53] same issues amen what are we on a
[1:04:56] spiritual death march because we don't
[1:04:58] have a guide to get us somewhere we
[1:05:00] think we're the guide spiritually and
[1:05:03] don't realize that we keep coming back
[1:05:05] to the same doctrine to the same point
[1:05:07] and we're not getting anywhere amen the
[1:05:09] lutherans have been on a death walk the
[1:05:11] wesleyans have been on a death walk the
[1:05:12] pentecostals have been on a death walk
[1:05:14] amen they all started into a death walk
[1:05:17] when they quit following the guide
[1:05:21] but don't think it stops with
[1:05:22] pentecostals we can get ourselves on a
[1:05:25] death walk if we ever leave the
[1:05:26] leadership of the guide amen if we ever
[1:05:29] get self-confident self-sufficient if we
[1:05:31] ever believe that i know the word and i
[1:05:33] know the message and you can't stop me
[1:05:36] and i don't need a guide and then you're
[1:05:38] gonna wand wind up right back on the
[1:05:40] death march and come right back to the
[1:05:41] same thing
[1:05:43] and the whole time then you start off
[1:05:45] again and say it will be different this
[1:05:46] time
[1:05:48] i'll pay i'll pay closer attention this
[1:05:51] time i'll use all my spiritual skills as
[1:05:54] a believer and you come right back to
[1:05:56] the same same issue same problem same
[1:05:58] thing
[1:06:01] we don't want to get on a death walk
[1:06:04] how do you prevent a guest walk
[1:06:06] stay with the guide
[1:06:08] there's only one guy that's the holy
[1:06:10] ghost
[1:06:11] and brother benham even began to talk
[1:06:13] amen he began to explain that god always
[1:06:15] has a guide for his people
[1:06:19] and he said he sends a prophet many
[1:06:20] times as a guy god always has a guide
[1:06:22] but he says it's the guide in the person
[1:06:24] he said there was a guide in moses moses
[1:06:27] wasn't the guide the guide was working
[1:06:28] through moses brother branham wasn't the
[1:06:30] guide it was the holy ghost it was the
[1:06:32] son of man working through a son of man
[1:06:34] was the guide amen but you still have to
[1:06:37] recognize where the guide's working amen
[1:06:40] you have to be attentive and say the guy
[1:06:42] the guide the holy ghost is working
[1:06:45] through this ministry amen through this
[1:06:47] prophet in the end time i'm going to
[1:06:49] follow that message i'm going to follow
[1:06:51] that prophet because that's the guide
[1:06:54] amen the god also works through his
[1:06:56] fivefold ministry he works through gifts
[1:06:58] amen and he guides us church it's not
[1:07:00] the ministry it's the guide we have to
[1:07:03] be able to recognize the guide so so
[1:07:05] many people have wanted to go their own
[1:07:07] way they don't want a prophet
[1:07:10] because it's too restricting they don't
[1:07:11] want a fightful ministry because the
[1:07:12] fifo ministry has failed hey hey listen
[1:07:15] the fifo ministries failed and they're
[1:07:17] going to fail again but it's still god's
[1:07:19] provided way
[1:07:20] it doesn't mean that i can now make my
[1:07:23] own spiritual journey without any kind
[1:07:25] of guidance with no shepherd at all god
[1:07:28] is the great shepherd and he works
[1:07:29] through shepherds god's the great guide
[1:07:31] and he works through men to be guides
[1:07:33] and he guides us individually as the
[1:07:35] spirit that speaks to us and gives us
[1:07:36] individual leadership
[1:07:38] and he has to be that kind of guide all
[1:07:41] the way around for us
[1:07:44] if not we're going to we're going to
[1:07:46] cast aside the fivefold ministry because
[1:07:48] they make mistakes and and now i'm going
[1:07:51] to guide myself and you don't realize
[1:07:52] you're on a great big death march
[1:07:55] coming right back never progressing in
[1:07:57] the word never going anywhere but
[1:07:59] malachi 4 never leaving amen the circle
[1:08:02] of god senate prophet malachi 4. look at
[1:08:04] the signs and wonders look at all that
[1:08:06] was given to us we have 1200 tapes amen
[1:08:08] but never actually following the guide
[1:08:11] and going to where the prophet was
[1:08:12] pointing to
[1:08:14] he was pointing in a direction but the
[1:08:16] guide will take you in that direction
[1:08:18] amen but if you don't allow the guide to
[1:08:21] take you in that direction you keep
[1:08:22] circling back around the signpost and
[1:08:24] saying there's a signpost there's a
[1:08:25] signpost look at that
[1:08:27] look at that god sent a sign god sent a
[1:08:29] gift god god sent a message
[1:08:33] but we need the bad we we need to have
[1:08:35] confidence in the guide that god gave us
[1:08:37] that the holy ghost will lead us through
[1:08:39] according to his provided way
[1:08:42] that we don't have to change the
[1:08:43] scriptures because things have gone
[1:08:45] wrong in the past
[1:08:48] because then we start to take our own
[1:08:50] ideas about things
[1:08:53] and so brother branham here thought he
[1:08:55] was the guide
[1:08:57] didn't take a guide he was too good a
[1:08:59] woodsman to ever need a guide
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] sometimes i think it's
[1:09:05] more dangerous
[1:09:07] to be a good woodsman
[1:09:09] than to be a bad one
[1:09:11] because a bad one would have waited for
[1:09:12] the friend or hired a guide
[1:09:15] right
[1:09:16] and sometimes it's dangerous to be too
[1:09:18] spiritual
[1:09:21] to be too spiritual
[1:09:23] amen because you can become so spiritual
[1:09:25] that you don't realize you still need a
[1:09:27] guide
[1:09:29] we can become so spiritual that we
[1:09:30] become self-sufficient the minute our
[1:09:33] spirituality makes us self-sufficient we
[1:09:35] are going to find ourselves in a death
[1:09:37] march
[1:09:38] amen there's no self-sufficiency in the
[1:09:40] body of christ amen we're dependent on
[1:09:42] the head for everything absolutely
[1:09:44] everything we don't have any thought of
[1:09:46] our own we can't make up our own way we
[1:09:49] can't do anything right on our own we
[1:09:51] must have the headship of christ in
[1:09:53] every part of our life we must have
[1:09:55] confidence that god has sent us a guide
[1:09:56] and the guide has a way of operating and
[1:09:58] i've got to have confidence in that
[1:10:00] sometimes it's too dangerous to be too
[1:10:02] spiritual
[1:10:05] this is where brother branham found
[1:10:06] himself in the natural time
[1:10:08] he was too gifted he was too good he was
[1:10:11] too experienced
[1:10:17] brother bram now does this three times
[1:10:20] he comes back to the same deer hanging
[1:10:22] in the tree
[1:10:25] and he says
[1:10:27] he gets nervous
[1:10:29] but he's trying to calm himself down
[1:10:31] he said i was saying it's okay you're
[1:10:33] not lost he said but there's no bluffing
[1:10:35] it inside you know
[1:10:37] inside you know
[1:10:39] and i'd like to say there's no reason
[1:10:41] for bluffing it here tonight this
[1:10:43] morning
[1:10:44] if you're not sure that you haven't got
[1:10:46] the guide on the inside don't bluff it
[1:10:48] don't act like it's all right don't
[1:10:50] think that i'm surrounded by good
[1:10:51] brothers they've got the guide amen god
[1:10:53] can pluck you off be by yourself in a
[1:10:55] matter of weeks and have no idea what
[1:10:57] happened to you amen you can't depend on
[1:10:59] somebody else to be your guide you must
[1:11:01] have the guide
[1:11:03] there's no bluffing it amen if you if
[1:11:06] you all of a sudden have every once
[1:11:07] about that panic go off in your heart
[1:11:09] that you don't have the guide amen don't
[1:11:11] bluff it don't say it's okay get on your
[1:11:13] face and say god i need a guide amen i
[1:11:15] must have the holy ghost to guide me in
[1:11:17] life i can't pretend i don't want to
[1:11:19] fake i don't depend on others amen i
[1:11:21] want to know i have a guide amen
[1:11:24] we saw how quickly the world can change
[1:11:26] with the pandemic what if the next one's
[1:11:28] worse than this one amen and there's
[1:11:30] absolutely zero fellowship
[1:11:34] you better have a guide
[1:11:36] you better have a guide or you're going
[1:11:39] to find your children or yourself grow
[1:11:41] cold and dead in your arms amen there
[1:11:44] has to be a guide it has to be the holy
[1:11:46] ghost giving us individual personal
[1:11:48] leadership from god himself
[1:11:52] so don't panic but don't bluff
[1:11:56] get on your face and say god i must have
[1:11:58] a guide
[1:12:01] he goes on to say
[1:12:02] he heard something this is the third
[1:12:04] time he hears it
[1:12:06] and he hears
[1:12:07] i'm a very present help in a time of
[1:12:09] trouble
[1:12:10] a very present help this is the third
[1:12:12] time he heard it
[1:12:14] he said i thought is that god talking to
[1:12:16] me
[1:12:17] i took off my hat
[1:12:19] i had my patrol hat red handkerchief
[1:12:20] wrapped around it i laid it down took
[1:12:23] off my coat it was moist i laid my coat
[1:12:25] down i set my gun up against the side of
[1:12:26] a tree i said heavenly father now i'm
[1:12:28] getting beyond myself
[1:12:30] i'm hearing a voice speak to me is that
[1:12:32] you
[1:12:33] i said lord i'm going to admit to you
[1:12:36] that
[1:12:37] you that i ain't no hunter
[1:12:40] i can't find my way around
[1:12:43] you have to help me
[1:12:46] oh praise god that's where we need to be
[1:12:49] friends
[1:12:50] that's the spot we need to be in and
[1:12:53] stay in amen don't because god has done
[1:12:56] wonderful things for us he's done
[1:12:57] wonderful things for us because we have
[1:12:59] testimonies in our personal life and
[1:13:01] god's taken us so far don't ever get to
[1:13:04] that thought i can make it always stay
[1:13:06] here and say god i ain't no hunter
[1:13:09] i can't find my way around you gotta
[1:13:11] help me
[1:13:13] so he goes on to say i'm not fit to live
[1:13:16] and doing the things that i've done come
[1:13:18] in here and thinking i know too much
[1:13:20] about it to ever get lost
[1:13:22] i need you lord my wife is a good woman
[1:13:25] my baby my little boy his mother's gone
[1:13:27] on and she's trying to be a mother to
[1:13:29] him and i've just married her and here
[1:13:31] she is a kid there in the woods they'll
[1:13:33] both die tonight that wind it'll turn
[1:13:35] down about 10 below zero and they won't
[1:13:38] know how to live they'll die tonight
[1:13:40] don't let them die god take me to them
[1:13:42] so that i can see that they don't die
[1:13:45] i'm lost i'm lost god i can't find my
[1:13:48] way around
[1:13:49] won't you please help me and forgive me
[1:13:52] for my own self-centered way
[1:13:55] i can't do nothing without you you're my
[1:13:58] guide you help me lord
[1:14:01] oh what a prayer amen if you want a
[1:14:03] guide that's the model prayer if you
[1:14:05] want the holy ghost to be your guide
[1:14:07] that's the prayer you need amen you need
[1:14:09] to say god i'm finally at my wit's end
[1:14:12] i'm finally done i'm finished i can't i
[1:14:14] can't put two steps together in the
[1:14:16] right direction i can't get a right
[1:14:18] straight thought amen my emotions are
[1:14:20] leading me astray my thoughts are all
[1:14:21] tangled up i mean every time i try to
[1:14:23] start out right i do something wrong god
[1:14:26] i need a guide i can't do it i'm not
[1:14:28] capable i'm lost without you lord
[1:14:31] amen and then he started saying god that
[1:14:34] wife he starts thinking about his own
[1:14:36] self-confidence and his own arrogance
[1:14:39] being the death of his wife and his baby
[1:14:41] i say as a father it'd be good to get
[1:14:43] down on our knees and say god i've got
[1:14:45] children that are watching me i don't i
[1:14:47] can't be a good father by myself i can't
[1:14:50] lead them in the way that's right god i
[1:14:52] need you to be my guide
[1:14:54] because they'll spiritually die
[1:14:56] if you don't have the right leadership
[1:14:58] as you as a mom or a dad amen don't have
[1:15:01] the right kind of leadership those
[1:15:03] children can spiritually die amen this
[1:15:05] is serious we got to get down on our
[1:15:07] knees and say god i must have a guide
[1:15:10] you must be my guide i don't know where
[1:15:12] i'm going i can't be a good mom i can't
[1:15:15] be a good dad i can't be a good husband
[1:15:17] i can't be a good wife i can't do these
[1:15:20] things without you lori
[1:15:22] i need a guide
[1:15:26] the prophet of god got up from that
[1:15:28] prayer and he says i started walking
[1:15:31] this away
[1:15:32] i said this is it so he picks a
[1:15:34] direction he said i have to make myself
[1:15:37] believe it i'm going this way i'm going
[1:15:39] straight this way i'm not going to vary
[1:15:42] i'm going this way i know i'm right i'm
[1:15:44] going this way
[1:15:47] see the brother of and just got up from
[1:15:48] that prayer
[1:15:50] and said i need a guide god i don't know
[1:15:52] where i'm going
[1:15:53] and he gets up from that prayer and he
[1:15:56] decides i'm going to go in this
[1:15:57] direction
[1:15:58] this has got to be the right direction i
[1:16:01] know what i'm doing i'm going but
[1:16:02] remember he just asked god to be his
[1:16:04] guide so what's he doing he's doing the
[1:16:07] same thing you and i do he's doing the
[1:16:09] very best he knows how to do in the
[1:16:10] situation
[1:16:12] and that's all we can do friends
[1:16:14] really when it comes down to it
[1:16:17] if you're not off the word and you know
[1:16:18] you're not off the word all you can do
[1:16:20] is the very best you know how to do
[1:16:24] but if you've asked god to be your guide
[1:16:26] you can rest assured that if you're ever
[1:16:28] going the wrong way he'll let you know
[1:16:29] because you're not your own guide
[1:16:31] anymore he's your guy all you're doing
[1:16:33] is just going the way you know best
[1:16:36] because being in no motion is not going
[1:16:38] to get you anywhere you got to get in
[1:16:40] some motion and let god steer the ship
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] so he said
[1:16:45] he goes on to say
[1:16:47] i know i'm right i'm going this away
[1:16:49] he said if i'd have went that way i'd
[1:16:52] have headed off over in canada
[1:16:54] he was going exactly the wrong way
[1:16:57] listen to what he says
[1:17:00] just then i felt something touched me on
[1:17:02] my shoulder
[1:17:03] a hand it felt like a man's hand so
[1:17:06] quick that i turned around to look there
[1:17:08] was nobody standing there i thought what
[1:17:10] was that here's the bible laying before
[1:17:12] me god my guide and my judge is standing
[1:17:14] here i just looked up and right back
[1:17:17] this way that fog just cleared back till
[1:17:20] i could see the tower at the top of
[1:17:22] hurricane mountain going right straight
[1:17:24] away from it the best of my hunting
[1:17:26] ability i was going away from it so he
[1:17:30] gets up from his prayer i'm going to go
[1:17:31] this way amen doing the best he knows
[1:17:34] how to do as a human being
[1:17:37] but he had asked god to be his guide
[1:17:39] and all of a sudden he felt a hand on
[1:17:41] his shoulder so sudden a man's hand that
[1:17:44] he turned quick and he didn't see
[1:17:45] anything but just then the fog cleared
[1:17:48] and he could see right up the mountain
[1:17:49] and see the tower at the top and
[1:17:51] recognize he was going exactly the wrong
[1:17:53] way
[1:17:55] if we ask god to be our guide we have to
[1:17:57] be confident that he's going to show us
[1:17:58] the way
[1:18:00] and we've got to be willing to adjust
[1:18:01] our course to his
[1:18:03] every time
[1:18:06] so he goes then he says
[1:18:08] he realized the best of my hunting
[1:18:10] ability
[1:18:11] led me the wrong way
[1:18:13] getting real late in the evening then i
[1:18:15] turned real quick directing myself like
[1:18:17] this i took hold of my hat and raised up
[1:18:19] my hands i said guide me over god you're
[1:18:22] my guide
[1:18:24] and he begins to realize that there's a
[1:18:26] wire going up the trail there somewhere
[1:18:28] a telephone wire that he had helped the
[1:18:30] ranger tack on amen to the trees so he's
[1:18:33] holding up his hands asking god to help
[1:18:35] him listen it's amazing how god begins
[1:18:39] to intervene for the prophet but he
[1:18:41] doesn't intervene in a way that it
[1:18:42] doesn't require the prophet ever to do
[1:18:45] anything or have faith or move
[1:18:47] he's got to move he's got to have faith
[1:18:50] he's got to try to get to his wife and
[1:18:52] god will help him along the way but god
[1:18:54] won't do everything for him god will be
[1:18:57] his guide amen if you hire a guy to take
[1:18:59] you into the woods the guy doesn't shoot
[1:19:01] the game for you you shoot your own game
[1:19:03] the guy doesn't carry you on his back
[1:19:05] you do your own walking amen and so in
[1:19:07] this life we do our own walking we do
[1:19:09] our own caring we do our own trying we
[1:19:11] do the best we know how and trust the
[1:19:13] guide to steer us whenever we get in the
[1:19:15] wrong direction
[1:19:19] he said
[1:19:21] he's been looking for the wire he would
[1:19:22] hold his hand up until he'll get too
[1:19:24] tired to hold up and then he put it down
[1:19:26] and shift his gun to the other hand and
[1:19:28] put his hand up but he would take two
[1:19:29] steps backwards to make sure he didn't
[1:19:30] miss anything and now he's walking and
[1:19:32] he's walking this way for a while arm
[1:19:34] getting tired you would think you know
[1:19:37] god is the guide why didn't he leave the
[1:19:39] fog separated so he could just walk up
[1:19:42] but god never does it that way friends
[1:19:45] god will always give you a picture god
[1:19:47] always give you a touch something in a
[1:19:49] sermon something you heard on a tape
[1:19:51] something a friend said he'll give you
[1:19:53] some inkling that you're going the wrong
[1:19:54] way turn around and when you turn around
[1:19:57] you're still saying okay god i i still
[1:19:59] need that wire i need i need something
[1:20:01] else to guide me and brother branham's
[1:20:03] walking through the dark the storm the
[1:20:05] thick fog and he's looking for a wire
[1:20:07] that'll lead him to his wife and his
[1:20:09] baby so they don't die and god doesn't
[1:20:12] make it simple amen he has to have faith
[1:20:15] that the guide is going to guide him all
[1:20:17] the way there
[1:20:20] it says after a while when i was just
[1:20:22] about ready to give up
[1:20:24] my hand hit something
[1:20:26] oh my i had been found when i was lost i
[1:20:29] held to that wire
[1:20:31] i dropped the rifle right down took my
[1:20:33] hat off my head and i stood there i said
[1:20:34] oh god what a feeling it is to be found
[1:20:37] when you're lost
[1:20:38] i said right down to the end of this
[1:20:40] wire i'll never turn it loose
[1:20:43] i'll hold on to this wire it'll guide me
[1:20:45] right straight to where all on this
[1:20:47] earth that's dear to me is laying
[1:20:49] right down there my wife and baby
[1:20:51] frantically not knowing where i am not
[1:20:53] knowing how to make a fire not knowing
[1:20:55] what to do and the winds blowing and the
[1:20:57] limbs popping and falling off trees
[1:20:59] i was darison to let go of that wire i
[1:21:01] held that wire until it guided me right
[1:21:03] into where all that was dear on earth
[1:21:05] was to me
[1:21:08] see friends
[1:21:10] it wasn't just his life
[1:21:12] that he was holding that wire for
[1:21:14] it was for the life of his wife and his
[1:21:16] child
[1:21:18] and we're holding the lifeline amen the
[1:21:20] line of the word of god and we're
[1:21:22] holding on don't ever let go of that
[1:21:23] line
[1:21:24] don't never turn loose of it for
[1:21:26] anything not a job not a relationship
[1:21:29] not any don't ever turn loose of this
[1:21:31] lifeline of the word of god because it's
[1:21:33] guiding us right straight home amen and
[1:21:35] it's going to mean salvation for many
[1:21:37] that are around us amen don't turn loose
[1:21:40] of that don't if you get lost how will
[1:21:43] anybody survive
[1:21:46] we can never turn loose with the word
[1:21:48] friends
[1:21:51] brother branham said in the message god
[1:21:52] hiding himself in simplicity says so it
[1:21:55] please god to reveal himself and then
[1:21:57] hide himself then hide himself and
[1:21:59] reveal himself in simple little things
[1:22:01] it's put over the top of the head of man
[1:22:03] because if you'd say why would a just
[1:22:05] god do that it's because that man was
[1:22:07] made up in the beginning not to try to
[1:22:09] shift for himself
[1:22:11] a man was made to rely completely upon
[1:22:14] god
[1:22:16] oh i want that to soak down deep
[1:22:20] a man was made to rely completely upon
[1:22:22] god living in america and laodicea has
[1:22:26] been a handicap for us
[1:22:29] it seems like a blessing and when it
[1:22:31] comes to air conditioning and good food
[1:22:33] and comfortable seats and it is a
[1:22:35] blessing
[1:22:36] but when it comes to spiritual maturity
[1:22:38] and growth i think it's detrimental
[1:22:41] living in laodicea with all the comforts
[1:22:43] that are available in america and
[1:22:45] laodicea amen it's taught us to shift
[1:22:48] for ourselves
[1:22:50] but man was never meant to shift for
[1:22:52] himself he was meant to completely rely
[1:22:54] upon god
[1:22:55] and god's great plan had a threefold
[1:22:58] purpose and the first part of that was
[1:22:59] to have preeminence absolute full
[1:23:01] control and a man
[1:23:04] he did that in christ jesus but now to
[1:23:05] have preeminence in the body of
[1:23:06] believers how he's going to have
[1:23:08] preeminence in a people that don't need
[1:23:10] him
[1:23:12] how is he going to have preeminence and
[1:23:14] a body of believers that aren't looking
[1:23:16] for him for everything in life for all
[1:23:18] their leadership all their decisions and
[1:23:20] everything how is he going to have
[1:23:21] preeminence to people that are their own
[1:23:23] guide
[1:23:26] we have to lose all of that we have to
[1:23:28] lose everything and let the word amen
[1:23:30] become our mind let our mind match the
[1:23:32] word and the word cleans our mind until
[1:23:34] we think like a christian talk like a
[1:23:37] christian amen until we begin to dream
[1:23:39] like a christian
[1:23:41] let our mind be washed in this word we
[1:23:43] need this word more than we need news
[1:23:47] i'm not saying it's wrong to know what's
[1:23:49] going on in the world we keep up with
[1:23:50] the news but we need the word more than
[1:23:52] we need the news
[1:23:54] we need the more the word more than we
[1:23:56] need friendships and all of these things
[1:23:58] that are outside the word we need the
[1:24:00] word most more than anything without it
[1:24:03] we're going to get lost and lose our way
[1:24:08] in the world we live in we're bombarded
[1:24:10] by media messages constantly
[1:24:13] constantly
[1:24:15] without wanting it without even meaning
[1:24:17] for it you can't hardly get away from it
[1:24:20] so that means we should be more diligent
[1:24:22] about staying in the word than ever
[1:24:23] before
[1:24:25] because we have to have something to
[1:24:26] counteract all the wrong information
[1:24:28] we're receiving all day long
[1:24:30] all day long wrong information wrong
[1:24:32] news wrong opinions anti-word anti-word
[1:24:36] anti-word anti-word you walk through
[1:24:38] walmart tell me what word message you've
[1:24:41] got in walmart last
[1:24:42] week every message you picked up was an
[1:24:45] anti-word message
[1:24:48] at work with the co-workers and social
[1:24:50] settings and all of these things what
[1:24:52] word message did you get to bring you
[1:24:55] into the mind of christ from any of that
[1:24:57] you've probably got nothing amen nothing
[1:24:59] but worldly ideas nothing but carnal
[1:25:01] knowledge and carnal understanding and
[1:25:03] all of these things i we should be more
[1:25:05] diligent than ever to make sure that i'm
[1:25:07] purifying my mind with the word of god
[1:25:09] amen that the word is forming my
[1:25:11] thinking the word is shaping my emotions
[1:25:13] the word is purifying my mind so that i
[1:25:16] can even think right
[1:25:19] let the word be my guide
[1:25:22] a man was made to rely completely upon
[1:25:24] god that's the reason we're likened and
[1:25:26] the lambs are sheep a sheep cannot lead
[1:25:28] himself he has to have a leader and the
[1:25:30] holy spirit's supposed to lead us
[1:25:35] see
[1:25:36] when you think about the church ages
[1:25:41] you don't need a guide
[1:25:44] when you're in the broad way
[1:25:47] well marked and well lit with everybody
[1:25:50] traveling that way
[1:25:52] going down the religious way
[1:25:55] the the nominal christian way you don't
[1:25:57] need a guide
[1:26:00] everybody knows that way
[1:26:02] it's the broad way well lit well posted
[1:26:04] with placards signs all the way down
[1:26:06] amen you can go that way
[1:26:09] but if you're ever going to join him
[1:26:11] outside the city
[1:26:13] if you're going to ever go outside the
[1:26:15] camp if you're ever going to leave
[1:26:16] jerusalem and the broad streets behind
[1:26:19] and go into the wilderness where he's
[1:26:21] been sent
[1:26:22] he's been put out of laodicea amen the
[1:26:25] door's been closed to him he's on the
[1:26:27] outside amen if you're ever going to go
[1:26:29] to the outside to where he is in the
[1:26:31] wilderness you better have a guide amen
[1:26:34] you better have a guide or you'll never
[1:26:35] find christ because he's not on the
[1:26:37] broad way amen he's been put out amen
[1:26:40] outside the camp and now we must go to
[1:26:43] him outside the camp
[1:26:45] no street signs no paved ways not masses
[1:26:48] of people going that way you may be
[1:26:50] walking towards him all by yourself on
[1:26:52] an unmarked path you better have a guide
[1:26:56] we're not going to find him in this day
[1:26:58] he's not on the broadway he's not in the
[1:27:01] walled city
[1:27:02] he's outside
[1:27:07] brother bam said in the message things
[1:27:08] that are to be
[1:27:10] said you were all pre-planned by god
[1:27:13] nothing happens by chance with god he
[1:27:16] knows all about it it's all pre-planned
[1:27:18] planned for many generations back so
[1:27:20] that you could be here tonight
[1:27:23] so it's all
[1:27:25] pre-planned your life is pre-planned
[1:27:28] god foresaw it he knew the works that
[1:27:30] you would do you were ordained in the
[1:27:32] good works
[1:27:33] god knew what he would use you for he
[1:27:35] knew the purpose that he created you for
[1:27:37] he knew how he was going to accomplish
[1:27:39] that purpose in this life
[1:27:41] amen in galatians chapter one let's look
[1:27:43] at this galatians together
[1:27:48] galatians chapter 1 verse 13
[1:27:55] the apostle paul is now speaking for you
[1:27:57] have heard of my conversion in time past
[1:27:59] in the jew's religion how that beyond
[1:28:01] measure i persecuted the church of god
[1:28:03] and wasted it and profited in the jewish
[1:28:05] religion above many mine equals in my
[1:28:07] own nation being more exceedingly
[1:28:09] zealous of the traditions of my fathers
[1:28:12] but when it pleased god
[1:28:14] who did it please
[1:28:16] whose plan was this
[1:28:18] whose desire whose idea
[1:28:21] when it pleased god who separated me
[1:28:23] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:28:25] his grace to reveal his son in me that i
[1:28:28] might preach him among the heathen
[1:28:30] immediately i conferred not with flesh
[1:28:32] and blood neither went i up to jerusalem
[1:28:34] to them which were apostles before me
[1:28:36] but i went to arabia and returned again
[1:28:39] unto damascus
[1:28:41] so the apostle paul says
[1:28:43] that he was walking along
[1:28:45] the apostle paul didn't have the guide
[1:28:48] the apostle paul thought he was this
[1:28:50] guide
[1:28:51] he was looking to the old traditions of
[1:28:53] the fathers as a guide he was looking to
[1:28:55] the sanhedrin he was looking to the
[1:28:57] elders as a guide he didn't have the
[1:28:59] guide he didn't know he needed a guide
[1:29:02] he thought he was on the right path he
[1:29:04] had letters from the elders and high
[1:29:06] priest to go and take care of this
[1:29:08] little
[1:29:09] group this sect of the nazarenes that's
[1:29:11] causing such a disruption he's going in
[1:29:14] all his religious duty and all his
[1:29:15] confidence and all his self-sufficiency
[1:29:18] and his pride and his self-confidence
[1:29:20] he's got the right connections with the
[1:29:22] right people and the right authority
[1:29:24] he's got everything and he doesn't know
[1:29:26] that he's lost
[1:29:28] he doesn't know that he's going the
[1:29:30] wrong direction he doesn't know that
[1:29:31] he's fighting the very thing that'll be
[1:29:33] a salvation
[1:29:36] but along the way when it pleased god
[1:29:40] god knew when he would meet paul
[1:29:43] god already ordained his meeting with
[1:29:45] the apostle paul he already knew who
[1:29:47] paul was he already knew the work that
[1:29:49] paul would do he already knew he was the
[1:29:51] fulfillment of isaiah you'll be a light
[1:29:53] to the gentiles he already knew that he
[1:29:55] would pull him out of the traditions he
[1:29:57] already knew all of this amen but it had
[1:30:00] to wait for god's timing
[1:30:03] and when it pleased god
[1:30:06] he came to him
[1:30:08] and he said you need a guide
[1:30:12] now go into the city
[1:30:15] i'm going to blind you temporarily so
[1:30:16] you'll realize you can't find your way
[1:30:19] so you'll know you're lost
[1:30:22] and you're helpless
[1:30:23] and one led him by the hand
[1:30:26] and he went to the very house the voice
[1:30:28] and the pillar of fire told him to go
[1:30:31] now he's got leadership
[1:30:34] now for the first time he's got a guide
[1:30:39] and god made it so evident by smiting
[1:30:42] him lying blind and telling him where to
[1:30:44] go and then he had to be led by the hand
[1:30:47] paul now needed a guide
[1:30:50] the one who was so proud the one who was
[1:30:52] so zealous the one who was so confident
[1:30:55] that he was doing god's work he now
[1:30:57] realized that he was fighting against
[1:30:59] jesus christ his lord the pillar of fire
[1:31:01] the same one that led him out of the
[1:31:03] wilderness and the exodus was the very
[1:31:05] one he was fighting against
[1:31:07] and that voice became his guide and
[1:31:09] guided him to a house and and he told
[1:31:11] him it will be told you there what you
[1:31:13] must do
[1:31:15] and so now god speaks to ananias and
[1:31:17] ananias comes to the house now ananias
[1:31:20] has the guide in him and ananias tells
[1:31:22] paul the instructions that paul needs to
[1:31:24] hear and paul must recognize the same
[1:31:27] voice that spoke to me in the pillar of
[1:31:28] fire speaking through ananias
[1:31:31] and he had to trust the leadership of
[1:31:33] the holy ghost leadership of the pillar
[1:31:35] of fire and he rose up and he was
[1:31:37] baptized and filled with the holy ghost
[1:31:39] and then he went into arabia and had
[1:31:41] jesus christ himself teach him the
[1:31:43] scriptures
[1:31:46] paul could not have figured out his own
[1:31:47] path in life
[1:31:49] what he figured out was leading him the
[1:31:51] wrong way
[1:31:52] he was a scholar among scholars
[1:31:55] he was a graduate of the school of
[1:31:57] gamalia one of the best finest teachers
[1:31:59] of the day he was a pharisee of the
[1:32:01] pharisees he was the the bright and
[1:32:03] shining pupil he was the up-and-coming
[1:32:06] and the ranks of the elders he was uh
[1:32:09] favored by the elders and there was he
[1:32:11] had it all
[1:32:13] but the truth
[1:32:15] he had everything but the right
[1:32:17] direction
[1:32:19] and in all his ability he was lost
[1:32:23] but god
[1:32:24] came in due season
[1:32:26] and began to say
[1:32:28] you need a guide
[1:32:30] from that day forward paul
[1:32:32] always followed that voice
[1:32:35] always followed that pillar of fire
[1:32:40] brother branham he begins to tell the
[1:32:42] story but i want to back up and read one
[1:32:44] more quote out of the guide then i'm
[1:32:45] going to go to a another quote in 1963.
[1:32:48] but in the guide he said i would like to
[1:32:50] take the next few minutes to call your
[1:32:51] attention upon the word guide a guide
[1:32:54] you know i've had some quite experiences
[1:32:56] in the woods a guide someone to show you
[1:32:58] around you have to have a guide when you
[1:33:00] don't know where you're going and being
[1:33:02] acquainted with hunting in all of the
[1:33:03] world around i've had the opportunity to
[1:33:05] meet guides
[1:33:06] and i'm a guide myself this is what
[1:33:09] brother bam says
[1:33:10] in colorado i'm a guide myself in
[1:33:12] colorado because knowing the country
[1:33:14] ranching so forth i can guide in
[1:33:16] colorado
[1:33:18] so when brother brother said i'm a guide
[1:33:20] myself in colorado
[1:33:22] so we know that there's a great thing
[1:33:24] that happened in the mountain in
[1:33:25] colorado in 1963 after the opening of
[1:33:28] the seals and i want to pick up that
[1:33:29] story but i wanted to go back to the
[1:33:31] message of a guide and show you brother
[1:33:33] branham claimed to be a guide in
[1:33:35] colorado he's a guy
[1:33:38] and now in the message testimony from
[1:33:40] the end of 1963
[1:33:42] he says and i started down the mountain
[1:33:44] thinking about that and about 10 o'clock
[1:33:46] in the morning and all of a sudden just
[1:33:48] as plain as you hear my voice the voice
[1:33:49] said stop and turn around and go back
[1:33:53] and to set the scene of what was taking
[1:33:55] place they had gotten news for days that
[1:33:58] a great blizzard was coming into the
[1:33:59] area a great storm was coming and they
[1:34:02] were warned to get out or you may not
[1:34:03] get out and brother bam sat down with
[1:34:05] all the brothers at camp and he began to
[1:34:07] explain the situation he said we can get
[1:34:09] snowed in here for a week or two and
[1:34:12] and we can keep going or we can leave
[1:34:14] and they said let's stay so they went
[1:34:15] down and got more groceries in case they
[1:34:17] got snowed in and brother brandon begins
[1:34:19] to give him instructions that day and
[1:34:20] says the first little bit of sleet or
[1:34:22] rain or snowflake you get back to quick
[1:34:25] camp as quick as you can because it'll
[1:34:27] be so bad that you won't be able to find
[1:34:29] your way
[1:34:30] you'll get lost in the blizzard and so
[1:34:33] brother man was a guide for all of these
[1:34:34] men
[1:34:35] and he was giving them instructions on
[1:34:37] what to do when the first little bit of
[1:34:39] precipitation began to fall in this
[1:34:41] great storm that's coming
[1:34:43] so he goes up himself on top of the
[1:34:44] mountain and he thought that he could
[1:34:46] roll some rocks or do something to chase
[1:34:48] the deer down to the brothers in the
[1:34:49] valley and he gets up there and all of a
[1:34:51] sudden the sleep comes and the snow
[1:34:53] starts falling and he starts to take his
[1:34:55] own advice
[1:34:56] he's going to go down to camp just as
[1:34:58] fast as he can but he hears another
[1:35:01] voice
[1:35:02] the voice of the great guide
[1:35:05] he was a guide
[1:35:06] in colorado his advice was good advice
[1:35:09] because not to follow his advice would
[1:35:11] mean death on the mountain
[1:35:13] but now brother branham going down the
[1:35:15] mountain following good advice as an
[1:35:17] experienced guide the voice said turn
[1:35:20] around and go back
[1:35:22] and brother branham didn't immediately
[1:35:24] turn around and go back he stopped and
[1:35:25] ate a sandwich
[1:35:27] because he knew to go back was death he
[1:35:29] would die back there
[1:35:32] so he stopped and he ate a soggy
[1:35:34] sandwich
[1:35:35] thinking that maybe that was just me
[1:35:38] and the voice began again and told him
[1:35:40] to go back and brother branham by this
[1:35:42] stage of his life he had learned who the
[1:35:44] real guide was
[1:35:47] and the guide
[1:35:49] listen to this friends
[1:35:51] the true guide
[1:35:52] looked like he was leading him to death
[1:35:58] the true guide the genuine guide the
[1:36:01] supernatural guide the holy ghost christ
[1:36:04] himself
[1:36:05] told him to go to your
[1:36:07] absolute
[1:36:08] death but he had learned through
[1:36:11] experiences to follow that voice
[1:36:15] and when that guy told him to go back he
[1:36:17] started walking back up the hill to
[1:36:19] where he was back into the storm further
[1:36:21] away from camp into greater danger
[1:36:23] because the only place of safety is to
[1:36:25] follow the guide
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:28] it doesn't matter how contrary it is to
[1:36:30] your intellect it doesn't matter how
[1:36:33] opposite it is to your feelings
[1:36:36] listen brother branham taught us so many
[1:36:38] things out of the scriptures how to
[1:36:40] conduct ourselves how to live amen how
[1:36:43] to live as husbands and wives i mean
[1:36:45] who's eligible to preach who's not
[1:36:46] eligible to preach who can be married
[1:36:48] and not married and and who can preach
[1:36:50] and who can be a pastor and who can he
[1:36:52] taught all of these things out of the
[1:36:54] word to us and it doesn't matter how we
[1:36:56] feel about it or what we think about it
[1:36:58] or what our emotions are how sad we are
[1:37:01] for people or or how much it looks like
[1:37:03] he would be such a good pastor amen if
[1:37:05] he's not qualified by the word he's not
[1:37:07] qualified by the word
[1:37:09] if the guide said don't then don't if
[1:37:12] you go it will bring death
[1:37:16] and so the prophet taught us how to
[1:37:18] conduct our lives how to treat one
[1:37:20] another
[1:37:21] how to live in our families how to treat
[1:37:23] one another amen those aren't just
[1:37:25] suggestions he brought the word to life
[1:37:27] in our day and applied it to us right
[1:37:29] here where we live
[1:37:31] and he's here to guide us it was the
[1:37:32] guide in that prophet
[1:37:36] and sometimes what the guide tells us is
[1:37:40] contrary to our intellect
[1:37:44] sometimes it's it's it goes against our
[1:37:47] emotions
[1:37:50] emotionally we we're we're pulled
[1:37:52] towards family members we're tugged
[1:37:54] towards situations and and all these
[1:37:56] affections begin to lead us the wrong
[1:37:59] way from the guide
[1:38:01] and brother branham on that mountain
[1:38:03] amen no matter what experience he had as
[1:38:06] a guide and how much he knew the weather
[1:38:08] patterns and the danger how to get down
[1:38:10] the mountain all of that was absolutely
[1:38:12] true none of it was wrong amen but when
[1:38:14] the guide said different he dropped all
[1:38:17] of his understanding all of his
[1:38:18] experience all of his knowledge and he
[1:38:21] listened to that voice
[1:38:25] and when he listened to that voice
[1:38:29] he went to another realm
[1:38:31] all together
[1:38:35] he's still sitting there eating the
[1:38:36] sandwich when he says and while i was
[1:38:38] standing there i thought that wasn't
[1:38:40] nothing i just imagined
[1:38:43] it was wind probably was blowing
[1:38:44] twisting through the trees and i started
[1:38:46] to walk on i just could not walk and i
[1:38:48] thought well i believe i'll go back and
[1:38:50] i heard it again go back where you come
[1:38:52] from it said that i started up the
[1:38:54] mountain stopped and i thought maybe i
[1:38:55] was getting scared to go back to where i
[1:38:57] was at because the winds were so
[1:38:59] terrific
[1:39:00] sometimes god makes us do things that
[1:39:02] seems very dangerous and out of line
[1:39:06] how about moses with the stick going
[1:39:07] down to take over egypt
[1:39:09] and everything we find like that that
[1:39:11] god asks the impossible see so that he
[1:39:13] does the impossibles that man will know
[1:39:16] that it's him it's god that's doing it
[1:39:21] god can ask you to give up a good paying
[1:39:23] job
[1:39:27] god can ask you to move to another
[1:39:29] location
[1:39:31] god can ask you to break a relationship
[1:39:34] god can ask you the guide can tell you
[1:39:37] to do these things according to the word
[1:39:39] and they may go contrary to your
[1:39:40] understanding it may be fearful to your
[1:39:43] human psyche your human mental emotions
[1:39:46] you can be afraid to actually do what
[1:39:48] god's telling you to do
[1:39:50] afraid to give up that job afraid to
[1:39:52] turn down that promotion afraid to break
[1:39:54] that relationship
[1:39:55] so the fear is real it's not something
[1:39:58] you say well he told me to do it and
[1:40:00] praise god no you can have actual
[1:40:02] turmoil inside brother bannon was afraid
[1:40:04] to go back where the voice was telling
[1:40:06] him to go and god can ask us to do
[1:40:09] things that are fearful to us amen but
[1:40:12] we've been taught we've been trained
[1:40:14] amen we've got the word we've got
[1:40:15] example after example where we can look
[1:40:17] at that and say it doesn't matter how
[1:40:19] fearful how much anxiety amen how wrong
[1:40:22] it feels emotionally if the word says
[1:40:25] that i'm going with the word
[1:40:28] amen because when we go with the word
[1:40:30] what god was doing was breathing back to
[1:40:32] the place of danger back to everything
[1:40:35] he understood as a human being being
[1:40:37] wrong amen but as a son of god he
[1:40:40] followed the voice back into danger and
[1:40:42] that danger turned into one of the
[1:40:44] greatest blessings for the church of god
[1:40:46] to hear a prophet amen be given the
[1:40:48] right to speak to nature and say storm
[1:40:51] cease sun come out and shine
[1:40:54] clouds roll back to where you were and
[1:40:56] the very heavens began to respond to the
[1:40:59] voice of a man
[1:41:02] and in that experience amen the lord
[1:41:04] says won't you walk with me
[1:41:07] and he says i would love to
[1:41:09] and the lord comes down to walk with him
[1:41:12] and the whole atmosphere changes the sun
[1:41:14] comes out brother branham said i looked
[1:41:16] in my hands i was young in every way i
[1:41:18] was young again i thought like a young
[1:41:20] man i was a young man and then very
[1:41:23] shortly he begins to see his wife and
[1:41:24] she was young amen and the vision then
[1:41:27] the deer would come up and the animals
[1:41:29] wouldn't leave him he come all the way
[1:41:30] back into an eden condition amen to show
[1:41:33] us that we've this word brings us back
[1:41:35] to the full redemption amen back to
[1:41:38] young bodies back to eden back to nature
[1:41:40] back to everything god
[1:41:42] had for us
[1:41:44] but it took a man who had the courage to
[1:41:46] follow the guide
[1:41:50] he didn't do that just for himself he
[1:41:52] did it for you and i
[1:41:54] and now we have to have the courage to
[1:41:55] follow the voice of the word
[1:41:58] everywhere it points us in every
[1:41:59] direction
[1:42:02] there's a great blessing
[1:42:04] that god has for us
[1:42:06] but we must follow his voice
[1:42:10] and proverbs 3 verse 5 i'll just read it
[1:42:12] to you it says trust in the lord with
[1:42:14] all your heart
[1:42:15] and lean not to thine own understanding
[1:42:18] and all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[1:42:21] shall direct thy paths
[1:42:24] this this isn't what we need for this
[1:42:26] life this will lead us astray
[1:42:30] all of our experiences can still put us
[1:42:32] in the wrong direction
[1:42:34] all of our life experiences can still
[1:42:36] cause us to make a wrong choice
[1:42:38] years of experience years of study
[1:42:41] intellectual prowess it'll all fail
[1:42:45] every bit of it will fail
[1:42:47] but this word is eternal it'll never
[1:42:50] fail
[1:42:52] he said in all thy ways in every way in
[1:42:55] life
[1:42:56] see
[1:42:57] god is not just our guide
[1:42:59] in church matters
[1:43:02] he's our guide in every matter
[1:43:06] in all my ways acknowledge him and he
[1:43:08] shall direct thy paths
[1:43:13] in in psalms 37 23 it says the steps of
[1:43:16] a good man are ordered by the lord and
[1:43:18] he delighteth in his way
[1:43:21] god knows the path that he's ordained
[1:43:23] for each one of us
[1:43:25] he knows like he knew for the apostle
[1:43:27] paul he knew when he would get him he
[1:43:29] knew what job he had to do he knew who
[1:43:30] what scriptures he was to fulfill he
[1:43:32] already knew it and he even told him
[1:43:34] amen we told ananias he goes i must tell
[1:43:37] him what great things he must suffer for
[1:43:38] my name's sake god even knew what paul
[1:43:40] would suffer from ahead of time
[1:43:44] god knows what's in store for each one
[1:43:46] of us
[1:43:47] he knows the path that he's ordained for
[1:43:48] his walk he knows the pitfalls the
[1:43:50] trappings he knows the hurts the dangers
[1:43:52] the blessings he knows it all amen we
[1:43:54] don't know amen we don't have a map we
[1:43:57] weren't given a map at birth and says at
[1:43:58] 10 years old do this at 15 do this all
[1:44:01] we can do is follow the voice of the
[1:44:03] guide because the guide is looking at
[1:44:05] the map
[1:44:07] the guide has the compass and map and
[1:44:09] the guide is the one telling us every
[1:44:11] interchange in life hey if you haven't
[1:44:13] faced major interchanges in your life
[1:44:15] you will
[1:44:17] as you grow up amen and as you come of
[1:44:19] age you have major things in your life
[1:44:21] that major intersections and changes i
[1:44:24] mean marriage and jobs and careers and
[1:44:26] movements and you have major things that
[1:44:29] change and shift and turn in life amen
[1:44:32] and if you're going to go with your own
[1:44:33] intellect you're going to find yourself
[1:44:35] at the end of a dead-end road one day
[1:44:37] and you're going to have to back up and
[1:44:38] try to start over but but these inner
[1:44:41] changes in life these intersections in
[1:44:43] life amen we have to have a guide who's
[1:44:46] looking at the map of our life and it's
[1:44:47] the very one who made the map the very
[1:44:49] one who knows amen what path we had we
[1:44:52] need him to give us leadership and
[1:44:54] sometimes that leadership is opposite to
[1:44:56] our thinking
[1:44:58] and feeling
[1:45:01] but i just encourage you
[1:45:03] do like brother branham did
[1:45:06] say god i don't know
[1:45:08] i don't i don't know how to live i don't
[1:45:10] know how to live in this life
[1:45:13] i mean can we come down to it and say
[1:45:15] god
[1:45:16] i don't know how to be a christian here
[1:45:20] i don't know what to do today i don't
[1:45:22] know what to do tomorrow i don't know
[1:45:23] what the next do i have no way to solve
[1:45:26] my problems
[1:45:27] i have no way to answer my questions i
[1:45:30] have no solutions i'm absolutely out of
[1:45:32] solutions god would you be my guide
[1:45:35] and then do like brother bannon did get
[1:45:37] up and do the very best thing you know
[1:45:40] how to do
[1:45:41] because what else can you do in life
[1:45:43] look at the word look at the examples
[1:45:45] you have but then do the very best thing
[1:45:46] you know how to do in life and trust
[1:45:48] that if you've asked him to be his guide
[1:45:50] amen that
[1:45:51] he will be your guide and if you're
[1:45:53] going the wrong way somehow he'll let
[1:45:56] you know you're going the wrong way so
[1:45:57] that you can correct and turn and go the
[1:45:59] right way because you have to have
[1:46:01] confidence that if you ask him to be a
[1:46:03] guide he's promised to be a guide you
[1:46:05] can receive the guide and the guide will
[1:46:07] take the leadership
[1:46:10] but sometimes what we have to do
[1:46:12] is watch for the guide to lead us
[1:46:16] so many times we ask for leadership
[1:46:20] god i can't do it i don't know what to
[1:46:22] do
[1:46:23] i want you to be my guide
[1:46:25] and then we spiritually sit on the patio
[1:46:30] on a lawn chair drinking lemonade
[1:46:31] waiting for god to do something
[1:46:35] that's not what it means to be a guide
[1:46:37] what it means is god all i know to do is
[1:46:40] the very best i know to do if i'm wrong
[1:46:42] please change me correct me i want to go
[1:46:44] your way but i can't find it on my own
[1:46:47] all i know to do is this next step would
[1:46:49] you please if i'm wrong correct me
[1:46:51] the scripture says thyroid and thy staff
[1:46:53] they comfort me they comfort me i'm
[1:46:56] comforted in the fact that i've got a
[1:46:58] guide and i've given my life to a great
[1:47:00] shepherd and if i get off the path i
[1:47:02] have asked him before to rebuke and
[1:47:04] chasten me quickly lord because what i
[1:47:06] want to be is on the path
[1:47:09] and we have confidence that we have a
[1:47:10] good shepherd
[1:47:13] and he's got a rod
[1:47:15] and that rod is our comfort
[1:47:18] his rod my staff
[1:47:20] they comfort me
[1:47:22] let's look at psalms 23 together
[1:47:31] psalms 23.
[1:47:43] and verse 1.
[1:47:45] we're going to read the whole psalm
[1:47:47] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:47:51] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:47:52] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[1:47:54] waters
[1:47:56] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:47:58] the paths of righteousness for his
[1:48:00] name's sake
[1:48:01] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:48:04] the shadow of death
[1:48:06] how did you get into the valley of the
[1:48:07] shadow of death
[1:48:09] by following the shepherd
[1:48:12] sometimes the shepherd will lead you to
[1:48:14] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:48:17] but if the shepherd led you there then
[1:48:19] you can read the rest of the scripture
[1:48:22] see yea though i walk through the valley
[1:48:23] of the shadow of death i will fear no
[1:48:26] evil
[1:48:27] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:48:29] staff they comfort me
[1:48:32] thou preparest the table before me in
[1:48:34] the presence of mine enemies thou
[1:48:36] anointes my head with oil my cup runneth
[1:48:38] over
[1:48:39] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:48:41] me all the days of my life
[1:48:44] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:48:45] lord
[1:48:46] forever
[1:48:48] do you have a shepherd
[1:48:50] does he lead you beside still waters
[1:48:53] does he restore your soul
[1:48:56] does he sometimes lead you in the valley
[1:48:57] of the shadow of death
[1:48:59] yes
[1:49:00] but take courage you have a shepherd
[1:49:04] you've given your life to the shepherd
[1:49:06] and the great guide is with you you're
[1:49:07] never alone
[1:49:09] you never have to figure out life by
[1:49:11] yourself
[1:49:12] you know i have i have struggled and
[1:49:14] struggled and struggled as a human being
[1:49:17] because uh my parents divorced when i
[1:49:19] was just a young child five years old my
[1:49:21] parents divorced and
[1:49:22] and i was just with my mom and i spent
[1:49:24] very little time with my dad just every
[1:49:26] other weekend and then my dad passed
[1:49:28] away when i was 18 years old and
[1:49:30] and i've struggled with the fact that i
[1:49:32] really never had a father daily in my
[1:49:34] life and my dad died when i was 18 and i
[1:49:37] had nobody to go to nobody to turn to
[1:49:39] by the time that i i come to be a pastor
[1:49:42] brother lonnie was already passed away i
[1:49:44] couldn't go to him there was nobody to
[1:49:45] talk to and i felt like all my life i've
[1:49:48] never had a father
[1:49:50] but then i realized all my life i've
[1:49:52] always had a father
[1:49:54] all my life the devil will try to give
[1:49:57] me a pity party you know feel sorry for
[1:49:58] yourself kind of you've never had a dad
[1:50:01] and the truth is so many things i had to
[1:50:02] figure out all by myself
[1:50:04] so many things i had to figure out on my
[1:50:07] own nobody to lead me nobody to tell me
[1:50:09] nobody to help me amen but i found in
[1:50:12] every turn there was a guide there amen
[1:50:14] god led me god preserved me even when i
[1:50:17] wasn't serving him i see where the turn
[1:50:18] in the road came at the right time
[1:50:21] there's been a shepherd watching over me
[1:50:23] there's been a guide in my life before i
[1:50:25] even recognized that he was watching
[1:50:26] over me
[1:50:28] and it doesn't matter what happens i
[1:50:30] have a father
[1:50:32] god is my father he's my guide when i
[1:50:34] don't know what to do there's one right
[1:50:36] here with me that knows exactly what to
[1:50:38] do when i don't know how to make the
[1:50:40] decision when i don't know how to make
[1:50:41] the turn when i don't know how to figure
[1:50:44] out this complicated situation one thing
[1:50:46] i know for sure that there's a guide
[1:50:48] here amen and whenever he wants he can
[1:50:50] put his hand on my shoulder and open up
[1:50:51] the fog
[1:50:53] until he does i'm going to keep walking
[1:50:55] the best way i know to walk and trust
[1:50:57] that there's one walking with me that
[1:50:59] knows how to guide my footsteps
[1:51:01] listen i don't care what you came
[1:51:03] through i mean i do care i don't mean it
[1:51:05] that way
[1:51:06] that was really bad
[1:51:09] but no matter what you've come through
[1:51:12] if you've been abandoned lived single
[1:51:14] not had an earthly parent or not had a
[1:51:15] father amen
[1:51:17] none of that
[1:51:19] would have helped you make it to glory
[1:51:20] anyways
[1:51:22] none of that would have brought you into
[1:51:24] an eternal heritage
[1:51:26] only the guide would do
[1:51:29] if these earthly things have failed us
[1:51:31] and many of us have had failures in the
[1:51:33] earthly realms
[1:51:35] if the earthly has failed you the
[1:51:37] heavenly will not
[1:51:39] never has and never will if you find
[1:51:41] yourself alone and you find yourself
[1:51:43] confused and you find yourself amen not
[1:51:45] knowing which way to turn and then
[1:51:47] realize that i've given my life over to
[1:51:50] a guide there is a guide there's a man
[1:51:52] here who can turn on the light there's
[1:51:54] somebody who can touch my shoulder
[1:51:55] there's somebody who can part the fog
[1:51:57] there's somebody can help me get to the
[1:51:58] lifeline there is a way there is a
[1:52:01] intelligence there is a shepherd i am
[1:52:04] not on my own
[1:52:06] the devil plays with our minds and
[1:52:08] twists us up so bad where we feel sorry
[1:52:10] for ourselves we feel alone we feel
[1:52:12] abandoned we feel rejected amen we've
[1:52:14] never been abandoned we've never been
[1:52:16] rejected we've never been alone we only
[1:52:18] felt that way
[1:52:20] but if we'll let the water of the word
[1:52:22] wash our minds we'll get over a victim
[1:52:24] mentality and realize there's never been
[1:52:26] a day in my life i was alone there's
[1:52:28] never been a time when i was abandoned
[1:52:30] god was my father from before the
[1:52:31] foundation of the world and it'll be my
[1:52:33] father all the way through he's watched
[1:52:35] over me i had a guardian angel before i
[1:52:37] knew i had a guardian angel
[1:52:42] amen we got the we got to stop the
[1:52:44] helplessness stop the the hopelessness
[1:52:47] and say you know what i have no idea
[1:52:49] what to do next but there's one with me
[1:52:51] who knows what to do there's one in me
[1:52:53] that already knows the path and he
[1:52:55] hasn't told me yet but he'll tell me at
[1:52:57] the right time
[1:53:01] brother branham was walking
[1:53:03] trying to find that wire holding his
[1:53:05] hand up getting tired oh if god would
[1:53:08] have just parted the fog and showed him
[1:53:10] the wire was right there
[1:53:12] the thoughts that was going through his
[1:53:13] mind the anxieties that was creeping up
[1:53:16] needing to find this wire
[1:53:19] but sometimes god lets us sweat it out
[1:53:24] it's not easy it wasn't meant to be easy
[1:53:28] this life is education not comfort
[1:53:31] this isn't a cruise we're not on a
[1:53:32] cruise
[1:53:34] we're here for our education about the
[1:53:36] things of god
[1:53:38] he's walking along and his arm's tired
[1:53:41] he puts it down and holds the other one
[1:53:42] up and backs up doesn't want to miss
[1:53:44] this wire and so many thoughts are going
[1:53:46] through his mind he needs to get to his
[1:53:47] wife and child there's a desperate
[1:53:49] situation but you know what god's not
[1:53:51] telling him anything god's not showing
[1:53:54] him anything but god knows that he's
[1:53:56] heading right for the wire
[1:54:00] god knows that his hands up
[1:54:02] look when he drops it he takes three
[1:54:03] steps back he's going to be all right
[1:54:06] he's going to hit the wire while the
[1:54:08] brother is going through the things he's
[1:54:09] feeling where is it at i don't know
[1:54:11] where it's at i don't know how to find
[1:54:13] oh if i could get to the wire but the
[1:54:15] guy is standing there saying that boy's
[1:54:16] heading right forward he's going to hit
[1:54:18] it in no time amen there was never a
[1:54:20] problem there wasn't a problem he was
[1:54:22] headed right forward his hand was in the
[1:54:24] air he was being careful not to miss it
[1:54:26] god knew he would get it and everything
[1:54:28] was going to be all right god's not here
[1:54:30] to always take us by the hand and baby
[1:54:33] us god's here to build sons and
[1:54:34] daughters of god into mature believers
[1:54:37] that will take him at his word that will
[1:54:38] believe him that will have faith that'll
[1:54:40] have confidence in the guide
[1:54:43] amen we want training wheels all through
[1:54:46] life
[1:54:48] god can i have the trading wheels back
[1:54:51] or better yet can i climb back in the
[1:54:53] stroller that was the best
[1:54:57] we had little kids you take them to the
[1:54:58] park you they get tired they're fighting
[1:55:00] sleep you put them in the stroller they
[1:55:01] arch their back so you can't buckle the
[1:55:03] thing they want out i'm like what is
[1:55:05] wrong with you if somebody would put me
[1:55:07] in a stroller and push me around here
[1:55:08] i'd be the happiest person on the planet
[1:55:13] but that's the way it always is friends
[1:55:16] we want to go back to the stroller
[1:55:18] we want god to do everything but god
[1:55:20] knows it's going to be all right there's
[1:55:22] some things we have to overcome there's
[1:55:23] some things we have to learn there has
[1:55:25] to be a challenge to life there must be
[1:55:27] an overcoming there must be a growing in
[1:55:30] faith a building in faith there must
[1:55:31] come an understanding to us because god
[1:55:33] wants to be understood
[1:55:36] and all of these things work together
[1:55:38] and if you know you've got a guide
[1:55:40] then your heart can rest
[1:55:42] and though you walk through the valley
[1:55:44] of the shadow of death you'll not be
[1:55:46] afraid
[1:55:48] for thou
[1:55:49] art with me
[1:55:51] jesus looked at his disciples one day
[1:55:53] and says
[1:55:54] let not your heart be troubled
[1:55:58] listen
[1:55:59] he said let not your heart be troubling
[1:56:02] in other words
[1:56:03] don't let your heart be troubled
[1:56:06] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:56:10] and i'll say today friends don't let
[1:56:11] your heart be troubled
[1:56:13] don't let the emotion realm get away
[1:56:15] from you don't let the emotion spiral
[1:56:18] out of control don't let your heart be
[1:56:20] troubled recognize everything is fine
[1:56:24] no matter what's going on no matter
[1:56:26] who's in the hospital no matter who's
[1:56:27] sick or who's lost a job no matter what
[1:56:29] financial situation no matter who said
[1:56:32] what everything is fine there's a man
[1:56:35] here that can turn on the light there's
[1:56:37] a guide that's walking with us there's a
[1:56:38] shepherd that we're following the word
[1:56:40] is going before it the word has been
[1:56:42] restored the life of the word has come
[1:56:44] with it amen the great person of the
[1:56:46] word is here leading his bride along
[1:56:48] everything is fine don't be afraid
[1:56:53] god is here to change the situation
[1:56:56] but we have to trust him
[1:56:59] i want to read one more quote as we
[1:57:00] finish musicians if you want to go ahead
[1:57:02] and make your way up and brother john
[1:57:04] this last quote i want to read is out of
[1:57:06] the guide
[1:57:08] in the end brother is praying he says
[1:57:09] heavenly father
[1:57:11] i'm so thankful for the guide
[1:57:13] the one who leads me oh sometimes father
[1:57:16] i can't hear him around me i get scared
[1:57:19] i love the way brother branham is honest
[1:57:22] he didn't brother branham never tried to
[1:57:24] have a super duper faith
[1:57:27] and he never tried to play it off like
[1:57:28] everything worked out perfect in his
[1:57:30] life but he tells us he was scared he
[1:57:32] was afraid he thought wrong he made
[1:57:33] wrong decisions because that's the life
[1:57:35] that we live
[1:57:39] he said sometimes i can't hear him
[1:57:40] around me i get scared
[1:57:42] i want him close to me because i don't
[1:57:44] know what i'm what time i'm going to run
[1:57:46] up on the river i want him near
[1:57:49] me don't never leave me lord lord i
[1:57:52] can't talk i can't preach i can't hunt
[1:57:55] in the woods i can't fish on the bank i
[1:57:57] can't drive my car there's nothing i can
[1:58:00] do without you you're my guide
[1:58:03] oh let that be our prayer this morning
[1:58:05] let's all stand as we stand let that be
[1:58:07] our prayer this morning i can't drive my
[1:58:10] car i can't go to work i can't be the
[1:58:13] right father the right mother i can't i
[1:58:15] can't be anything i can't do anything i
[1:58:18] can't even fish on the bank i can't do
[1:58:20] anything without you god you're my god
[1:58:23] and if we'll start every day with that
[1:58:26] mentality if we'll live life that way
[1:58:28] and give our lives and to the guide day
[1:58:30] by day then we'll recognize there was
[1:58:32] nothing we could ever do anyway so when
[1:58:35] we come to the end of our ability praise
[1:58:37] god we never really had any anyways
[1:58:40] our abilities were a deception
[1:58:43] our abilities were just masking how
[1:58:45] vulnerable we really were so when we
[1:58:47] come to the end of our abilities we
[1:58:49] actually come into the right condition
[1:58:52] to recognize who we really are
[1:58:54] as human beings we're unable
[1:58:57] we're incapable
[1:59:00] but praise god
[1:59:01] there's a guide here
[1:59:03] and i have confidence in him
[1:59:06] he's the one
[1:59:08] god's ordained
[1:59:09] god sent in this hour the holy ghost
[1:59:11] back in the church back in the people to
[1:59:14] lead us through whatever tricky waters
[1:59:17] there may be
[1:59:18] from now to the translation
[1:59:21] whatever confusion might come whatever
[1:59:24] fears and scares and transitions and
[1:59:27] whatever it might be
[1:59:29] there's a guide here
[1:59:30] to guide us through it all and he will
[1:59:32] always guide us and step with the
[1:59:34] lifeline of the word
[1:59:36] because the word will take us there
[1:59:39] god bless you let's bow our heads and
[1:59:40] pray
[1:59:43] lord jesus i thank you father
[1:59:45] for your tender mercies almighty god
[1:59:49] you're so worthy of our praise you're so
[1:59:51] precious to us
[1:59:53] god that we as frail weak fallen human
[1:59:57] beings
[1:59:58] with the wrong mind and wrong motives
[2:00:01] and wrong emotions and wrong everything
[2:00:03] we come into this life with
[2:00:06] god you were so good that you provided
[2:00:08] for us a guide
[2:00:10] knowing that we couldn't make it on our
[2:00:11] own knowing that we're just but dumb
[2:00:13] sheep that would get lost
[2:00:15] you came as a shepherd to us lord
[2:00:18] you came to be our guide lord and that
[2:00:20] guide has come with the fullness of the
[2:00:21] word in this day
[2:00:23] with the full illumination the man is
[2:00:25] here christ jesus to turn on the light
[2:00:27] god we're so thankful for turning on the
[2:00:29] light for us
[2:00:31] situation by situation we're asking for
[2:00:33] you to turn on the light
[2:00:35] let us see your word in each situation
[2:00:38] it needs transition let us hold the
[2:00:40] lifeline all the way home
[2:00:42] god if there's any here he's not
[2:00:43] confident they have the guide i pray
[2:00:46] that we'd be as simple as brother
[2:00:47] branham was that they would get down and
[2:00:49] say god i can't do it on my own i can't
[2:00:51] make it i can't live i can't think right
[2:00:54] talk right live right i can't do
[2:00:55] anything without you would you come and
[2:00:57] be my guide
[2:00:59] and god i believe if they can receive
[2:01:00] you lord with that simplicity receive
[2:01:02] the baptism of the holy ghost that
[2:01:04] you'll come and quicken that seed and
[2:01:06] that you'll guide them in life
[2:01:08] for it's a promise in your word lord
[2:01:11] god i pray that you would help each one
[2:01:13] of us to have greater confidence in the
[2:01:15] guide that you provided
[2:01:17] god that we would quit doing our own
[2:01:19] thinking and and we would quit trying to
[2:01:21] find our own way but we would just walk
[2:01:23] and trust you to steer us
[2:01:25] if we step to the left and it's wrong i
[2:01:28] trust you just to open a way for me to
[2:01:29] step back to the right
[2:01:31] help me just to go the best i know and
[2:01:33] trust you to lead me every step of the
[2:01:35] way for god we're here for your purpose
[2:01:38] it's your great pleasure that brought us
[2:01:40] here you separated us from our mother's
