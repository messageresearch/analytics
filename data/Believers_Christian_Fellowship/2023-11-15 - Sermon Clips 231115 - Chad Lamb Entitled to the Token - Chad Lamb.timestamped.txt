[0:00] and that's why so many times our works
[0:04] actually declare our level of
[0:08] repentance it's a it's a ratio and
[0:11] that's what he's saying bring forth
[0:12] Works meat are in same value or
[0:16] corresponding to repentance the change
[0:18] of mind and this explains so many things
[0:22] that we see all around us sometimes
[0:24] because you see sometimes people living
[0:26] in a in a in a compromised life and
[0:28] they're and they're in disobedient ience
[0:30] and continual Disobedience and you
[0:32] wonder why and you realize their mind
[0:34] really hasn't been made up for the
[0:36] message amen they might be going along
[0:38] they might be sympathetic but there's
[0:39] not a real true absolute knowing that
[0:42] this is absolutely nothing but the
[0:44] truth and you find works that are meat
[0:49] for that level of repentance yeah and
[0:51] sometimes you scratch your head and you
[0:52] wonder how can they continue to to
[0:55] choose this and how can they continue to
[0:56] go that and then you realize there's not
[0:59] been an ABS absolute change and
[1:01] understanding they're not really
[1:02] understanding what the message is the
[1:04] message is not a better
[1:07] teaching the message is not a clearer
[1:10] understanding all of those are included
[1:12] in the message but amen this message is
[1:14] none other than Jesus Christ completely
[1:16] unveiled
[1:18] amen I mean if we take it if we take the
[1:21] prophet of God as as as another church
[1:24] age messenger who just brought a reform
[1:26] and he's another preacher who's a little
[1:28] bit better than the other preacher and
[1:29] amen we got to realize this isn't just a
[1:32] good preacher these aren't just good
[1:33] sermons amen th this is the seventh
[1:36] angel amen this is the one in Revelation
[1:38] 10:7 this is the Elijah of Malachi 4
[1:41] amen when when when when Jesus says of
[1:44] the Apostle uh uh of John or not not the
[1:46] Apostle when he says to John the Baptist
[1:48] he was more than a prophet you can take
[1:50] the same thing right to the prophet in
[1:52] our day he was more than a prophet amen
[1:54] he was a prophet to bring the Covenant
[1:56] amen he was the Fulfillment of
[1:57] Revelation 10:7 it was more more than
[2:00] just a prophet it was more than just a
[2:02] church age messenger yeah amen but you
[2:05] can see the level of works sometimes
[2:08] matches the level of
[2:11] repentance when we see brother brandom
[2:13] as a good man and and and he's a
[2:15] messenger and and but but you
[2:19] know he thought this and he did this and
[2:22] you know the Bible says this and he said
[2:25] that oh my goodness we're playing in
[2:27] dangerous games right now because we're
[2:29] belittling the the very voice that God
[2:31] used in this day amen the voice of God
[2:33] came through that man's vocal cords to
[2:35] give us the true interpretation of the
[2:37] word with Divine Vindication and when we
[2:40] start playing around with that it starts
[2:42] to show exactly where our repentance was
[2:44] we're not so sure we understand what
[2:47] this message is or who this messenger
[2:52] is and the works are meat to the
[2:58] repentance
