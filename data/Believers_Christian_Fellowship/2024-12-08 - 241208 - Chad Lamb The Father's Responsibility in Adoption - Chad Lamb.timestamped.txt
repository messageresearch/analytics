[21:56] standing together if you want to take
[21:57] your Bibles we'll begin reading the
[22:00] scripture and I want to start by just
[22:02] giving a special thank you for all of
[22:04] those who were able to attend sister Jan
[22:06] Golden's funeral it was nice to have
[22:08] everybody gathered around the family and
[22:10] also those who were able to help uh help
[22:13] the family and help out with the funeral
[22:15] dinner especially we always appreciate
[22:17] sister Mana ball she always does a great
[22:19] job and organize that and and sister
[22:21] Elizabeth Brooks and Irina bom Gunner
[22:22] helped her a lot to prepare and we're
[22:25] also very thankful for all those who

[22:29] to clean up it means a lot to the family
[22:31] and I really appreciate all your efforts
[22:34] and all that you did there may God bless
[22:36] you also I just want to say I
[22:38] appreciated the song special from
[22:40] Brother William Brother William and his
[22:42] SI his his wife Sally and their children
[22:44] have moved from Uganda and relocated
[22:46] here they're staying with the shares
[22:48] right now but they intend to make this
[22:50] their home not just their physical home
[22:52] but their home church as well so we want
[22:53] to welcome them officially God bless you
[22:55] both it's good to have you with us amen
[22:58] we appreciate you also wanted to let you
[23:01] know that um sister uh Carolyn Kai's
[23:04] grandmother passed away she'd been quite
[23:07] sick for a long time and uh they
[23:09] expected this to happen but still it's a
[23:12] great loss for sister Carolyn she was
[23:14] very very close to this grandmother so
[23:16] brother Ben and sister Carolyn will be
[23:18] heading up there this week for the
[23:20] funeral up in Canada uh they'll be going
[23:22] up there for the Wednesday funeral so
[23:24] just remember to keep them in prayer and
[23:26] for sister Carolyn's family that that
[23:28] her mother and her father and her
[23:30] brothers and sisters and all those uh
[23:32] that God will just bless them all and so
[23:34] we just want at times like this
[23:36] especially it's it's really hard to lose
[23:38] a loved one but it's always especially
[23:40] hard it seems at holiday times and so
[23:43] because they're such family oriented
[23:44] times so let's just remember those
[23:46] who've lost loved ones and and those who
[23:48] have funerals or will have funerals
[23:50] let's just remember them in prayer all
[23:52] right will you do that amen God bless
[23:55] you let's uh look here at Galatians
[23:59] chapter
[24:02] 4 Galatians chapter 4 and I'm going to
[24:05] begin right at verse
[24:11] one Galatians
[24:13] 4:1 now I say that the heir as long as
[24:17] he is a child differeth nothing from a
[24:19] servant though he be Lord of all but is
[24:22] under tutors and governors until the
[24:23] time appointed of the father even so we
[24:26] when we were children were in bondage of
[24:28] the elements of the world but when the
[24:30] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[24:32] his son made of a woman made under the
[24:35] law to redeem them that were under the
[24:38] law that we might receive the adoption
[24:40] of sons and because you are Sons God has
[24:43] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[24:45] your hearts crying Abba Father therefore
[24:48] Thou Art no more a servant but a son and
[24:51] if a son then an heir of God through
[24:54] Christ amen God be praised you may take
[24:56] your seats amen
[24:59] may God bless us as we look into his
[25:00] word I want to take for a subject today
[25:05] the father's responsibility and adoption
[25:07] so we want to talk about adoption but we
[25:09] want to look at the father's
[25:10] responsibility and adoption and so
[25:12] brother bandam had a lot to say about
[25:15] adoption and one thing that is so
[25:17] beautiful in the message that we have is
[25:19] we've had a prophet who would come in
[25:21] this day who had the mind of God and he
[25:23] would take the scriptures and begin to
[25:24] expound them in a way that would that
[25:27] would it's it's it's
[25:28] uh if I could say I don't ever want to
[25:30] say anything wrong I just say what's on
[25:32] my heart it's not just that we
[25:33] understand what happened and what the
[25:34] scriptures mean but really in the
[25:36] expounding of the scriptures and the
[25:38] opening of the word in our day he's
[25:40] trying to show us who we are he's trying
[25:43] to get over to us who we are amen and
[25:47] and take the scales off of our eyes CU
[25:49] we were born into a world in a hybrid
[25:51] condition being alienated from the
[25:53] things of God coming forth with a flesh
[25:55] that was at enmity with God hating the
[25:57] things of God Amen and we were born into
[26:00] the world this way amen but it takes the
[26:02] word of God to begin to take the scales
[26:04] off of our eyes so we can recognize who
[26:07] we actually
[26:08] are and so I I appreciate this message
[26:11] and one of the things brother benam
[26:12] taught we're going to focus on today is
[26:14] adoption and he used adoption to begin
[26:16] to show us our purpose in this life and
[26:18] what God's goal is and where he's
[26:20] bringing us to and so it's it becomes
[26:23] really really important and so uh I want
[26:26] to look at the word adopt op option
[26:29] brother Brown tells us the definition
[26:31] but I go to the Greek concordance and it
[26:33] and it it tells us the word adoption and
[26:36] it says from a presumed compound of two
[26:39] words 5207 and 5087 those are just
[26:42] references and the strong concordance
[26:44] but when you go look at those two words
[26:46] which which this word adoption uh is a
[26:50] compound of these two Greek words the
[26:52] first one just means son just means an
[26:55] heir or a prodigy a progyny a son an
[26:58] offspring amen and you sisters when he
[27:01] says adoption of sons you're included so
[27:04] it sounds masculine but it really means
[27:06] Offspring yeah and then the second
[27:10] word I I can't pronounce but it means
[27:14] the definition of it is to set to put to
[27:18] place to set to fix establish to
[27:23] establish or to ordain so this word
[27:26] adoption isn't like the way we
[27:28] understand adoption where you take a
[27:30] child who has no parents and you bring
[27:32] him into the family it's not that kind
[27:34] of adoption this kind of adoption is
[27:36] where you take a son and you put them in
[27:38] position positional placing of a son to
[27:42] establish to set to fix uh uh to ordain
[27:45] to put or to place uh a
[27:48] son and so when we go back here to the
[27:51] scriptures if we go back to chapter 4:1
[27:54] here in Galatians again says now I say
[27:57] that the air as long as he is a child
[27:59] differ nothing from a servant though he
[28:02] be Lord of all so brother M's going to
[28:04] show us that he's already a child and
[28:06] he's already an heir but he differs
[28:09] nothing from a servant because he's not
[28:10] been brought into adoption yet he's not
[28:12] been placed in his position in the
[28:15] family he's just a child he's born into
[28:18] the family and being born into the
[28:20] family he's an heir he's part of the
[28:22] family but yet he's no different than a
[28:24] servant because he hasn't he hasn't been
[28:26] positionally placed yet yeah but he's
[28:29] under tutors and governors until the
[28:31] time appointed of the father and this is
[28:33] one thing that I think is amazing when I
[28:35] look at the father's responsibility and
[28:37] adoption it says here until the time
[28:40] appointed of the Father the father is
[28:42] the one who's in control of the
[28:45] adoption it's his responsibility to
[28:47] bring a son to adoption amen and and
[28:50] he's the one who decided he want a son
[28:52] to begin with he got married amen he
[28:55] brought forth a son amen none of us came
[28:57] here because we decided to come here we
[28:59] we came here because somebody decided to
[29:01] be a
[29:02] father amen and because somebody decided
[29:05] to be a father then they had to take the
[29:07] responsibility as a father and and
[29:10] fulfill the role of a father for a son
[29:12] amen and we didn't come to this Earth
[29:14] because we decided to God decided to
[29:16] bring us forth and we are his sons and
[29:18] he he appointed us a time and a place to
[29:21] come forth on this Earth and now he has
[29:24] the responsibility of bringing us into
[29:26] adoption
[29:28] amen now that doesn't mean we don't have
[29:29] any responsibility we'll get that to
[29:31] another time but this time we're just
[29:33] looking at the responsibility of the
[29:35] father so he's under tutors and
[29:37] governors that means he's being trained
[29:39] up or taught until the time appointed of
[29:41] the father and so I'm going to just
[29:44] going to read the whole thing again even
[29:46] so we when we were children were in
[29:47] bondage under the elements of the world
[29:50] but when the fullness of time was come
[29:51] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[29:53] made under the law to redeem them that
[29:56] were under the law that we might receive
[29:58] the adoption of sons and because you are
[30:02] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[30:04] his son so the spirit of his son is the
[30:07] Holy Ghost it's the spirit of Christ why
[30:10] did he send it to us that our hearts
[30:11] will cry Abba Father because we were
[30:15] Sons that's who the spirit comes to
[30:17] because you are Sons God has sent forth
[30:19] the spirit of his son into your heart
[30:21] crying out but father wherefore Thou Art
[30:23] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[30:26] then an heir of God through Christ
[30:29] praise God this is God's plan for us now
[30:33] brother bandam he says in the message a
[30:35] hidden life from 55 he starts to talk
[30:38] about this uh uh
[30:40] adoption and he says now the same son
[30:43] that was born into a family could be
[30:44] adopted into the same family or placed
[30:47] in the same family so I want you to
[30:48] catch that the same son that was born
[30:50] into a family so the son was already
[30:52] Born Into the family but he was going to
[30:54] be adopted into the family could be
[30:57] adopted into the the same family or
[30:58] placed in the same family or listen this
[31:01] or give a position in the family that he
[31:04] was born into so this is what we're
[31:07] really looking at through this kind of
[31:09] adoption that's what we're really
[31:10] focusing on this morning is given a
[31:13] position in the family that he was born
[31:16] into amen amen so he's already born into
[31:19] it but there's another purpose for him
[31:21] being born into the family not to just
[31:23] say hey I've got a son but I've got a
[31:25] purpose for this son this son is going
[31:27] to find a position in the family
[31:31] amen and I do believe that that is the
[31:33] work of the Holy Spirit today among the
[31:35] church is trying to place in the church
[31:38] positionally Apostles teachers prophets
[31:40] and so forth and we've seen many false
[31:42] alarms and so forth moving amongst the
[31:44] people which only indicated that the
[31:47] real genuine adoption was at hand I
[31:50] believe it God has to place into the
[31:52] church that's the business of God not of
[31:55] man cuz that's the father's business he
[31:58] decides where he wants to place the Sun
[32:00] how much responsibility he wants to give
[32:02] to the Sun and when he's going to place
[32:04] the sun there it's the responsibility of
[32:07] the
[32:08] father I was looking uh uh I was looking
[32:11] up biblical and Roman uh adoption
[32:14] practices and principles just looking up
[32:15] on the Internet trying to understand
[32:17] what the ancient adoption principle was
[32:19] like and it was it was interesting how
[32:22] it was uh very much what brother bam
[32:23] taught us but the one statement that I
[32:25] pulled out from there I thought was
[32:27] interesting is Roman adoption was almost
[32:30] always something that happened to an
[32:31] adult not a
[32:34] child and that makes sense with what we
[32:36] understand it's positional placing
[32:37] somebody's grown into a place where they
[32:39] can be positioned with a position of
[32:41] responsibility amen so you don't do that
[32:43] for children you do that for adults
[32:46] which means when you're born into the
[32:47] kingdom of God by the New Birth by the
[32:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a
[32:51] certain growing up that needs to take
[32:53] place so God can position you because
[32:55] this is almost always for adults not
[32:58] children amen that's what makes that
[33:00] adoption process uh quite
[33:03] different uh with them than what we
[33:05] understand he brother M says in the
[33:07] message hear ye him he says but now when
[33:11] this son they dressed this son and put
[33:13] him on a nice robe and they set him up
[33:16] in a public place where everybody could
[33:17] see him and the father had a ceremony of
[33:20] adoption and he placed the son or
[33:22] adopted him into his family then that
[33:25] son he was a full-fledged son his name
[33:28] was just as good on the check as his
[33:29] father's was woo that's interesting he
[33:34] finally come to a place where he could
[33:35] be trusted amen finally come to a place
[33:38] where the father could give him a
[33:39] certain realm of responsibility and
[33:41] trusted that he would act right in that
[33:44] responsibility and in giving him
[33:45] responsibility he also gave him
[33:48] Authority because responsibility without
[33:51] Authority will never
[33:52] work right right that's why when we
[33:55] strip Authority away from those who have
[33:58] responsibility amen the whole system
[34:00] begins to collapse so you you have
[34:02] school teachers who no longer have
[34:03] authority they only have responsibility
[34:05] it collapses you have police officers
[34:07] who have responsibility but no Authority
[34:10] because it's been stripped from them it
[34:12] collapses so that when God adopts a son
[34:15] amen and brings them into a position of
[34:17] responsibility he also gives them a
[34:19] certain amount of
[34:22] authority and so they can operate under
[34:25] that Authority amen they can operate
[34:27] operate as if God was operating in that
[34:30] position as if the father was operating
[34:33] in that position amen so they have a
[34:34] certain amount of authority now I I like
[34:39] what brother B said or they can be uh uh
[34:43] oh I forgot exactly how he worded I'm
[34:44] going to skip back to the quote he said
[34:47] or give a position in the family that he
[34:50] was born into so the we know there's
[34:54] levels to adoption if I could say it
[34:56] that way in different ways brother
[34:58] brandham used the principle of adoption
[35:00] Amen to describe several things one he
[35:03] describes adoption for us personally
[35:06] that we're born into the kingdom of God
[35:09] that God Amen raises us up and then
[35:12] places us and gives us a work to do and
[35:14] a certain responsibility and and uh
[35:17] authority to work in that realm amen for
[35:19] that's for us personally but we also
[35:22] know that we're growing to the ultimate
[35:24] of adoption and the ultimate of adoption
[35:27] will be the change of the
[35:28] body that'll be the great that'll be the
[35:31] great procedure when the father takes us
[35:34] and sets us on high and changes our
[35:36] garment and gives us a royal garment
[35:38] what's that Royal garment a glorified
[35:40] body amen and then he will position us
[35:43] position us into the kingdom as joint
[35:45] air with Jesus Christ in the Kingdom of
[35:47] David on this Earth in the Millennium so
[35:49] we know there's an Al there's another
[35:51] level of adoption that's coming and
[35:53] we're growing to that level of adoption
[35:55] so don't get confused when we start
[35:57] talking about this amen if God has
[35:59] raised you up matured you in Christ
[36:01] given you some responsibility a work to
[36:04] do here on Earth you've come to a
[36:05] certain level of adoption you've got a
[36:07] position in the family and that position
[36:10] may have parameters it may have you
[36:12] you're you you have been given this
[36:14] position in the family and that position
[36:17] could be limited so the father in
[36:20] ancient times he could he could give the
[36:22] son a position to rule over a certain
[36:24] estate but maybe not take the whole
[36:26] estate yeah that makes sense so that's a
[36:29] position and if he operates in that
[36:31] level of responsibility he has Authority
[36:34] he can make decisions he can do what he
[36:36] needs to in this realm but he can't rule
[36:39] the whole thing yeah amen that's right
[36:43] so now that's us as individuals God's
[36:46] placing Us in certain places and and and
[36:48] we can operate because it's God it's
[36:50] Christ operating through US Amen in this
[36:53] position but that doesn't change the
[36:55] fact that we're still growing to another
[36:58] adoption so don't think that all of our
[37:00] lessons are over just because we have a
[37:03] work to do we're still growing to to
[37:05] what I would say the fullness of
[37:06] adoption for us as individuals and when
[37:08] we come to a perfect Triune being amen
[37:11] when we drop the robe of Flesh and it's
[37:12] glorified and changed Amen to a perfect
[37:16] body but then also the church is growing
[37:20] into
[37:21] adoption not just now we're not talking
[37:23] about individuals now we're talking
[37:25] collectively the church is growing into
[37:27] adop op option and it's been growing
[37:29] amen through seven Church ages it's been
[37:32] growing as he's been building character
[37:34] and as he's been had her under tutors
[37:36] and and under Governors until the time
[37:38] appointed and bring so he's bringing the
[37:41] whole body of Believers to an
[37:44] adoption so we understand amen see the
[37:47] problem when we when brother man starts
[37:49] to uh uh grab types and he starts to
[37:51] parallel something with something else
[37:54] amen if we if we if we get too
[37:55] narrow-minded on that Parable we miss
[37:57] that it fits here and it fits here and
[38:00] it fits there the same principles hold
[38:02] true in many different areas so the
[38:05] principles of adoption hold true for me
[38:07] personally Amen in a work that he wants
[38:10] me to do while in this body while in the
[38:12] church while in this life but he's also
[38:15] grooming me under the tutor of the Holy
[38:17] Ghost to full adoption which is a change
[38:20] of a body where now I don't just have uh
[38:23] uh Authority in this one little area
[38:25] he's going to give the entire creation
[38:27] to Christ and his
[38:29] bride and she's going to sit on the
[38:31] throne with him ruling and reigning for
[38:33] a thousand years so that's that's not
[38:37] just one
[38:38] estate that's the whole
[38:41] thing and along with that God is growing
[38:45] the entire church into adoption all
[38:48] right so we're all on the same page amen
[38:51] amen because some things fit into one
[38:53] analogy better than the other or we say
[38:55] I've already got a position I already
[38:57] come to a adoption Oh no you're not done
[38:58] growing yet don't don't think because
[39:02] God's giv you a position giving you a
[39:03] work to do amen don't you dare think
[39:05] you're not done yet you're not done till
[39:08] till either you go to the sixth
[39:10] Dimension to your resting place or your
[39:12] atoms change until then amen he until he
[39:16] takes this up and changes our
[39:19] garment this
[39:21] flesh then we're still
[39:23] learning
[39:25] amen so now he
[39:29] says in uh a hidden life back to this
[39:32] message a hidden life in
[39:33] 1955 if you'll notice in a perfect type
[39:37] God did his own son the same way he
[39:39] taken three as a witness where the mouth
[39:42] of two or three Witnesses every word to
[39:43] be established Peter James and John love
[39:46] Faith and Hope and he taken them up into
[39:48] a mountain apart from the rest of the
[39:49] world and there before official
[39:51] Witnesses God adopted his own son he was
[39:55] transfigured before them and his
[39:56] reignment did shine as the sun god
[39:59] lifted him up and robed him in a
[40:00] glorified condition so that they could
[40:02] see he put a special garment on him of
[40:05] glory amen and they saw this was God
[40:07] this was God's adoption ceremony for
[40:10] Christ
[40:12] amen he was transfigured before them and
[40:15] his reignment did shine as the sun and a
[40:16] voice out of the cloud said this is my
[40:18] beloved Son hear ye him set him upon a
[40:22] mountain put the witness there to see it
[40:24] clothed them in a robe as bright as the
[40:26] sun shining and this then Even Shine
[40:29] Like the Sun and its strength and God
[40:30] spoke out this is my beloved Son hear ye
[40:33] him God adopted his own child into the
[40:36] family hear me no longer this is now
[40:39] this is in quotation so brother brandham
[40:41] is
[40:42] paraphrasing what brother what what God
[40:44] had spoke there when he says this is my
[40:46] beloved Son we know that at Jordan when
[40:50] when John the Baptist was baptizing
[40:51] Jesus came to Jordan and he was baptized
[40:53] and when he came up amen there was a
[40:55] voice out of Heaven said this is my
[40:57] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased so
[41:00] God had already declared this is my son
[41:02] and I'm pleased in him I'm working in
[41:05] him I'm dwelling in him but now when we
[41:07] come to this ceremony he adds a
[41:10] statement at the end of the statement so
[41:13] he repeats the first part this is my
[41:15] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[41:17] then he adds hear ye him and when he
[41:20] adds hear ye him there's a change now he
[41:24] added that phrase and that phrase means
[41:26] now he's the one with full Authority
[41:29] he's been given the kingdom everything I
[41:32] have is poured into him hear him amen
[41:34] he's the only voice he's the only source
[41:37] he's the only
[41:39] Authority and this is what brother bam
[41:41] says God adopted his own child into the
[41:43] family then he puts quotes here hear me
[41:46] no
[41:51] longer that doesn't mean we don't listen
[41:53] to God we don't that's not what he's
[41:55] saying hear me no longer but this is is
[41:57] my son who takes over from here on amen
[42:01] God is saying he fulfilled he's come to
[42:03] the place he's been proved he's been
[42:05] tested he's been tried he's been
[42:07] faithful to the word and never left one
[42:09] I owe to the word hear ye him I've
[42:12] poured everything I have is poured into
[42:15] him all authority all power everything
[42:18] is now subject to
[42:21] him amen then listen what brother B
[42:25] says he says amen
[42:28] that
[42:29] adoption is near the time and parable of
[42:33] the church it's time for that remember
[42:36] saying now that kind of adoption that
[42:40] Jesus Christ had it's coming close to
[42:42] that time for the
[42:44] church amen why because she's a joint
[42:47] Heir with Christ she's to rule and reign
[42:49] with him to sit on his very throne with
[42:51] him in marriage as a part of him United
[42:53] with him so she must come to the same
[42:56] position
[42:58] of adoption amen amen I want to look at
[43:01] Jesus's adoption if you will with me
[43:03] let's go to Matthew chapter 3 we just
[43:07] referred to it but I want to go back and
[43:08] and grab the scriptures and read
[43:20] it Matthew chapter 3
[43:27] Matthew
[43:30] 3:16 and Jesus when he was baptized went
[43:32] up straightway out of the water and loow
[43:34] the heavens were open unto him and he
[43:36] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[43:38] dove and lighting upon him and L a voice
[43:41] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[43:43] Son in whom I am well pleased so now God
[43:48] is showing and brother man uses this as
[43:51] a type and he begins to show us this is
[43:53] this is the fullness of the god coming
[43:55] into a body Jesus Jesus Christ and he
[43:57] say this is my son and I'm pleased to
[44:00] dwell in him this is where I'm at now
[44:03] amen and this is a type of our new birth
[44:05] because our new birth are you're born
[44:07] again when you're baptized with the Holy
[44:09] Ghost that's our new birth and our new
[44:11] birth brings Christ brings God dwelling
[44:14] within us declaring that we're a son
[44:16] this is our birth we're he's declaring
[44:18] we're a son we're born into the family
[44:21] and he's pleased to dwell in US amen by
[44:25] the by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:28] and so then I want to look now at the
[44:29] next verse chapter
[44:31] 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[44:35] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[44:37] devil so after he declares this is my
[44:41] son and I'm pleased to dwell in him the
[44:43] very next things that happen is the
[44:45] tutor remember the Holy Ghost is our
[44:48] tutor brother benam says our governor
[44:50] he's he's training us the he's led by
[44:52] the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[44:55] tempted tested proved amen verified this
[44:58] what all those words mean by the devil
[45:01] amen so God when he when he birthed his
[45:04] child now he starts the training
[45:06] process so Jesus is typing all of this
[45:09] out for us and showing us amen the the
[45:11] pattern that will
[45:13] follow so we know that that through
[45:16] Jesus's entire life uh he's being tested
[45:20] he's being buffeted he's being battled
[45:22] he's being rejected he's being he's
[45:24] being chased he's being all kinds of
[45:26] things are happening there's constantly
[45:28] tests and trials there's constantly
[45:31] manifestations and glor glorified things
[45:33] that are happening in his life is all
[45:35] these things that are happening for him
[45:38] and through him but then in Matthew 17
[45:41] let's turn
[45:44] there this is Mount Transfiguration this
[45:47] is when he
[45:49] comes to the end of
[45:52] it Matthew chapter 17 and verse 1
[45:57] and after 6 days Jesus taken Peter James
[46:00] and John his brother and bringeth them
[46:01] up into a high mountain apart and was
[46:03] transfigured before them and his face
[46:05] did shine as the sun and his reignment
[46:07] was white as the light and behold there
[46:09] appeared unto him Moses and Elias
[46:11] talking with them then answered Peter
[46:13] and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for
[46:15] us to be here if thou Wilt let us make
[46:18] here three Tabernacles one for thee one
[46:20] for Moses one for Eli Elias and while he
[46:23] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[46:25] overshadowed them and behold a a voice
[46:27] out of the cloud which said this is my
[46:29] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[46:32] hear ye him don't build any other
[46:36] Tabernacles don't look anywhere else
[46:38] only look to
[46:39] him he's come to adoption everything is
[46:43] poured in to
[46:44] him and God if we could say it this way
[46:48] in a type in a shadow God tested him God
[46:51] proved him and he was proved over and
[46:54] over and over to be a perfectly faithful
[46:56] son
[46:57] am to be he became the last Adam by by
[47:01] by doing what nobody else could do
[47:03] nobody else could fully obey God and
[47:05] keep the word of God but he could he
[47:08] could become a perfect son he could be a
[47:11] perfect son and demonstrate a perfect
[47:12] son Amen to become the last Adam and
[47:15] becoming the last Adam gave him the
[47:18] right now because he had no sin no flaw
[47:21] no Disobedience now he could come and
[47:23] shed his own blood as a substitute for
[47:25] all the seed Amen to buy back all that
[47:28] Adam
[47:29] lost and that's what Jesus Christ did
[47:32] but now God brings him to adoption and
[47:34] when does he bring him to adoption he
[47:36] brings to adoption and he says I've
[47:38] poured everything now to him you hear
[47:41] him and he did it when he was going to
[47:43] give him the greatest responsibility of
[47:46] all now he was going to lay upon him the
[47:49] responsibility to reverse all that had
[47:52] been done in the fall in Eden and he was
[47:55] going to do it by requiring iring that
[47:57] he bear the sins of the entire world and
[47:59] become the sin offering and become sin
[48:03] and become rejected of the father and
[48:05] become chastised and beaten and and
[48:07] mocked and scored and and take the sins
[48:10] of the world and carry them and separate
[48:12] them from the children of God and God
[48:15] was giving him the greatest
[48:16] responsibility of all but before he
[48:18] would give him this responsibility he
[48:20] tried him he tested him he proved him
[48:22] and he proved to be faithful he would
[48:24] never leave that word and now in the
[48:27] face of the greatest opposition ever in
[48:29] his life amen the greatest struggle
[48:32] until he struggled within himself amen
[48:35] the Bible says when he was at the Last
[48:36] Supper with his disciples he knew it was
[48:38] coming it said he was sorely
[48:42] vexed and
[48:44] grieved this wasn't you know Jesus
[48:47] wasn't he was a human being brother said
[48:49] he was completely God and completely
[48:51] man now when you've got that completely
[48:54] sorted out you come and talk to me but
[48:57] it's nonetheless the
[48:58] truth and as completely man he felt what
[49:02] men feel he felt what rejection was he
[49:06] felt what separation was he knew what
[49:08] loneliness was he knew he knew he knew
[49:11] what it was to be
[49:14] betrayed and he felt pain he knew what
[49:17] it was Amen to have the sting of a whip
[49:20] hit his back he wasn't it wasn't like he
[49:23] was immune from all of that because he
[49:24] was God in flesh no he was made a
[49:26] complete human being a man that when the
[49:29] whip come across his back he probably
[49:31] screamed out in pain like any man would
[49:33] scream out in pain and he felt the
[49:35] intensity the bite the sharp bite the
[49:38] pain the blood he could feel the warm
[49:40] blood flowing down his back and down the
[49:42] back of his legs he was a
[49:45] man and this man was in agony of spirit
[49:49] because he knew it was
[49:50] coming then he goes to Gethsemane and in
[49:53] Gethsemane amen uh he's he's agonizing
[49:57] so intently that his sweat was falling
[50:00] as great drops of blood listen this
[50:02] wasn't trivial this wasn't tiny this was
[50:06] Major and none of us may have ever felt
[50:09] that kind of Agony before in our lives I
[50:11] certainly know the blood is not
[50:13] separated from the water in my
[50:15] body and begin to come out like sweat I
[50:18] I know that for sure so I've never felt
[50:21] the intensity of the
[50:23] agony when all the resp responsibility
[50:27] was placed on his shoulders for the
[50:30] entire world am
[50:34] amen but before God brought him to
[50:37] adoption he tested him and he knew
[50:40] there's one thing I know he'll never
[50:44] leave the
[50:48] word and God could trust him with this
[50:51] level of
[50:53] responsibility when he comes to
[50:55] Gethsemane and he he struggling as a man
[50:57] he's saying father is there any way this
[51:00] cup can
[51:01] pass that's completely
[51:06] man but then he would say but not my
[51:09] will thine
[51:11] will that was the perfect
[51:13] son that was the one who who could be
[51:17] entrusted that's the one who could be
[51:19] given this level of
[51:20] responsibility
[51:22] amen amen so so we see in in Jesus's
[51:27] adoption what God had done bringing him
[51:29] to adoption but he brought him to
[51:31] adoption at the time he was going to
[51:33] give him the greatest responsibility and
[51:35] make him responsible for the whole
[51:38] family and the whole world but he had to
[51:42] know before now we say this in a type
[51:45] like God doesn't know and like he wasn't
[51:47] perfect sin sinless flesh we know that
[51:50] but God was demonstrating and showing
[51:53] that he already tested and proved this
[51:55] son amen and he could give him this
[51:58] level of responsibility and he wouldn't
[52:02] fail amen so brother bam goes on in the
[52:05] message hear ye him he says then how the
[52:08] father says sure proud of that son you
[52:11] know what happens when he gets his
[52:14] schooling his training yet he might not
[52:16] be able to exercise all authority he
[52:19] hasn't got it yet he's still a son but
[52:21] he hasn't been placed now you ministers
[52:23] know what I'm getting to a placing of a
[52:26] son
[52:27] now if that son proven to be a right
[52:30] kind of son and then he's got something
[52:33] in parenthesis here so he's going to
[52:34] give us the definition of what it means
[52:36] to be the right kind of son if that son
[52:39] proven to be the right kind of son so
[52:41] what's the right kind of son love the
[52:43] father's business stayed right with his
[52:46] instructions so what does it mean to be
[52:49] the right kind of son what does it mean
[52:50] to be the right kind of son today do you
[52:52] want to know what it
[52:53] means to love the father's business amen
[52:57] not our own business we have to love the
[53:00] father's
[53:01] business to love the father's business
[53:04] and stay right with his
[53:07] instructions see the the na in the
[53:09] natural the father's not going to bring
[53:11] a son to adoption and give him authority
[53:13] over part of his of his inheritance or
[53:15] part of his estate or all of it he's not
[53:18] going to do that until he knows that the
[53:21] son loves his
[53:23] business because if the son continues to
[53:26] have his own agenda and his own desires
[53:28] and he wants to go a different direction
[53:30] and he's got all these grandiose ideas
[53:32] and he's got these things he wants to do
[53:34] amen the father's not going to risk the
[53:37] estate what he's worked for all of his
[53:38] life and what what he has for the future
[53:41] uh uh of his progeny he's not going to
[53:43] risk it to a son who's taking his own
[53:45] idea and doesn't love the father's
[53:47] business but loves all kinds of other
[53:48] things and is not interested in what the
[53:50] father's interested in but he's looking
[53:52] for a son that loves the father's
[53:55] business
[53:58] amen it's why Jesus when he was 12 years
[54:01] old disput disputing with the the
[54:03] Pharisees in the temple amen and Mary
[54:05] comes to him and says amen my my father
[54:07] your father and I were looking for you
[54:08] he says don't you know I must be about
[54:10] my father's business why because that's
[54:12] what he was here for that was his whole
[54:14] purpose he was being tested and tried to
[54:16] see if he would be only about the
[54:18] father's
[54:20] business
[54:21] amen and stay right with his
[54:25] instructions God
[54:27] so for us to stay with the father's
[54:30] business amen and to O fully obey the
[54:35] word the father then on a certain day
[54:37] took that son out before the public set
[54:39] him up on a high place clothed him in a
[54:41] beautiful garment and and he had they
[54:44] called the adoption of a son or placing
[54:46] a son positionally what he was they had
[54:50] a ceremony and then the father said this
[54:52] my son I adopt him or I place him
[54:55] positionally and they had checks in
[54:57] those days that son's name on the check
[54:59] would be just as good as his father's
[55:00] name was cuz he was placed and the son
[55:03] could fire who he wanted to he could
[55:04] hire who he wanted to he was in full
[55:07] possession of all the father
[55:10] had let's go to the book of Ephesians
[55:13] together
[55:17] now and we're going to go to Ephesians
[55:19] chapter 1
[55:32] all right Ephesians chapter 1
[55:37] verse4 Ephesians 1:4 according as he ha
[55:39] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[55:42] of the world that we should be holy and
[55:44] without him without blame before him in
[55:46] love having predestinated us unto the
[55:49] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[55:51] himself according to the good pleasure
[55:53] of his will to the praise of the glory
[55:56] of his Grace wherein he hath made us
[55:58] accepted in the Beloved so why are we
[56:02] coming to
[56:04] adoption because he predestinated us
[56:07] unto
[56:09] adoption we're not coming to adoption
[56:11] because we want to come to adoption now
[56:14] I I don't disagree with that statement I
[56:16] want to come to adoption I don't know
[56:18] about you but I want to please my father
[56:20] I want to be about my father's business
[56:22] I I want to follow his instructions I
[56:24] want him to be able to trust me and to
[56:26] do something for his kingdom I want to
[56:28] come to the fullness of adoption where
[56:30] he can change my atoms and I can move
[56:32] into another position I want those
[56:34] things I do want them but me wanting
[56:36] them will never produce it it had to be
[56:39] God Desiring it before the foundation of
[56:41] the world and God birthing me into his
[56:43] kingdom God bringing forth a son with a
[56:46] purpose for that son and that purpose
[56:48] was to bring the son to
[56:50] adoption amen so he's predestinated us
[56:54] unto an adoption of children by Jesus
[56:56] Christ himself according to the good
[56:59] pleasure of his will so it's not my will
[57:02] it's his will it wasn't my idea it was
[57:04] his idea so the father now God himself
[57:07] is responsible for our adoption that's
[57:10] doesn't mean we have no responsibility
[57:12] like I said we'll get into that some
[57:14] other time but God is the one who
[57:16] predetermined that he is going to birth
[57:18] us into his kingdom and bring us into
[57:20] adoption amen so now he has to see fit
[57:23] that he does everything necessary for
[57:26] the son so the son can be brought into a
[57:28] position of
[57:29] adoption why because that's the good
[57:32] pleasure of his will that what that
[57:34] means is God wants me to come to
[57:36] adoption God wants me to give a position
[57:38] in his kingdom he wants to give me
[57:40] Authority and responsibility he wants me
[57:42] to be a partaker of all that he is and
[57:44] all that he has that's according to his
[57:46] good pleasure so no matter how much I
[57:49] want to do something for the kingdom my
[57:51] want is only a reflection of his want
[57:53] that came first amen it was according to
[57:55] the good pleasure of his will and this
[57:57] scripture is the very thing that gives
[57:59] us courage to keep pressing forward
[58:01] because it wasn't me who wanted to do
[58:02] something for God it's God who wanted me
[58:05] to do something in his kingdom and he
[58:07] foresaw it he knew it ahead of time I
[58:09] was a thought in his mind and he saw
[58:11] what works I would do and he wanted me
[58:13] to do
[58:15] them amen it's and and it's not like God
[58:18] says well I want this son to take this
[58:20] part and I want this son to be in this
[58:22] position ah they're not working out I'll
[58:24] just get somebody else to take that
[58:25] position
[58:31] if that's the way it is then he's not
[58:34] perfect in his thoughts before the
[58:36] foundation of the world he's having to
[58:37] change them so that means friends he
[58:40] wants you and I to come to adoption he
[58:43] wants you and I to be partakers of the
[58:45] Kingdom that's his desire he wants us to
[58:49] have a part he wants us to mature he
[58:52] wants us to grow he wants to give us a
[58:54] position he wants us to come to a body
[58:56] change he wants us to rule and reign
[58:58] with Christ for a thousand years that's
[59:00] what he
[59:03] wants amen now you can have a rebellious
[59:06] son who doesn't want what the father
[59:09] wants and boy that makes the process of
[59:11] adoption really difficult he wants to do
[59:14] his own thing and have some fun and he
[59:15] wants to experience this and he doesn't
[59:17] want to have to do all of this learning
[59:19] all of this stuff I don't why am I
[59:21] learning Latin why am I learning math
[59:23] why am I going through this why am I
[59:25] having to obey this why do I keep having
[59:28] to come back to class over and over and
[59:30] over again the Father Knows
[59:32] Why the father knows the position you're
[59:35] going to hold and everything that you
[59:36] have to learn along the way to take that
[59:38] position he knows you're going to need
[59:40] trigonometry and you're looking at
[59:41] trigonometry say why do I have to do
[59:43] trigonometry the father knows you're
[59:45] going to need it down the road that's
[59:47] why so many of us say why did I have to
[59:49] go through this as a child and why do I
[59:51] have to be like this and why couldn't it
[59:53] be like why could my uh past as a child
[59:56] not be like this other brother's past as
[59:58] a child because God knows the position
[1:00:00] from before the foundation of the world
[1:00:02] he's got a position for you to hold and
[1:00:04] you must come through tutors and
[1:00:05] governors Amen to be trained up to take
[1:00:08] that spot and your training won't be
[1:00:11] like somebody else's training because
[1:00:13] your spot is unique to
[1:00:17] you now if the son's rebellious and
[1:00:19] always resisting with the father it's
[1:00:21] going to be
[1:00:22] harder it's going to be harder and in
[1:00:24] the natural in the natural some Sons
[1:00:28] never come to adoption they're Sons but
[1:00:31] they never got with the
[1:00:32] program the difference between that and
[1:00:35] this and the types is God
[1:00:39] predestinated us to the adoption of sons
[1:00:42] by the good pleasure of his will amen so
[1:00:44] that means if we're like the rebellious
[1:00:46] son and we're not we're not we don't
[1:00:47] want to follow the instructions and
[1:00:49] follow the tutor and we got our own
[1:00:51] ideas about things not so much
[1:00:52] interested in the father's business or
[1:00:54] all of his instructions don't worry he's
[1:00:56] predestinated us to
[1:00:58] adoption so he knows how to change the
[1:01:01] circumstances to get us to change our
[1:01:04] mind God can't force us into anything
[1:01:07] that's not the way he works he works off
[1:01:08] free moral agency and he hasn't taken
[1:01:10] that away but his predestination trumps
[1:01:13] are free moral
[1:01:16] agents now he never takes away our
[1:01:19] choice but he absolutely knows how to
[1:01:21] change the circumstances till we want to
[1:01:24] choose what he wants us to choose
[1:01:27] and I say thank God I'm so thankful God
[1:01:30] didn't let me go the way I wanted to go
[1:01:32] but he changed the circumstances and
[1:01:33] brought hard things in my life until
[1:01:35] finally I recognized there's only one
[1:01:37] way that I want to live when I want to
[1:01:39] live according to the word and that's my
[1:01:41] desire that's not because I'm afraid of
[1:01:43] being Cast Away or lost now I've come
[1:01:45] through so many battles and so many
[1:01:47] difficulties there's only one thing I
[1:01:49] want I want to be about the father's
[1:01:50] business I want to follow his
[1:01:53] instructions amen so God has
[1:01:56] predestinated us unto adoption now
[1:01:59] remember we understand adoption
[1:02:02] now it's it's not just saying God's
[1:02:04] predestinated me to be part of the
[1:02:06] family for that's true also but he
[1:02:09] predestinated me to be positionally
[1:02:14] placed and that you know what friends
[1:02:16] that's 100% true for
[1:02:18] everyone there's nobody who doesn't have
[1:02:21] a position in the
[1:02:23] body so don't let the devil lie there's
[1:02:25] so many times I see people struggle so
[1:02:28] many times with what's my position what
[1:02:29] am I called to do what should I do my my
[1:02:32] my my word to you is
[1:02:34] relax he predestinated it right you're
[1:02:37] going to fit in yeah reality really is
[1:02:40] you're probably already doing it and you
[1:02:43] just don't recognize it as your
[1:02:46] position amen we'll get into that in a
[1:02:48] few minutes in the adoption message
[1:02:51] adoption part two he preaches a series
[1:02:53] on adoption in 1960 and adoption part
[1:02:55] two he says your adoption is not your
[1:02:57] birth your adoption is your placing when
[1:03:00] you were born again uh John 1:7 I
[1:03:04] believe when we are born of the spirit
[1:03:06] of God we are sons of God but we were
[1:03:08] predestinated now there's what I'm
[1:03:10] trying to get to you for the sons of the
[1:03:12] last day you see we we were
[1:03:15] predestinated unto
[1:03:17] adoption now here we are now this is
[1:03:20] what hurts Pentecostal a little they say
[1:03:22] I got born again praise the Lord got the
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God
[1:03:26] that's right but yet that ain't what I'm
[1:03:29] talking about see you were predestinated
[1:03:31] unto adoption adoption is placing a
[1:03:35] son so it's not it's it's it's exciting
[1:03:39] to be part of the family and say I've
[1:03:40] been born again I'm part of the family
[1:03:42] that's a thrill it's a thrill to know
[1:03:44] who your father is it's a thrill to know
[1:03:46] what family you're part of it's a thrill
[1:03:48] to know what your last name is and where
[1:03:50] you belong that's a thrill but that
[1:03:52] wasn't the purpose of your birth the
[1:03:54] purpose of your birth was to come to
[1:03:55] adoption
[1:04:00] amen and adoption part two again he says
[1:04:02] but now to place how are you you're
[1:04:06] first born into the kingdom by the Holy
[1:04:08] Ghost how many knows that all right the
[1:04:10] next you are predestinated unto the what
[1:04:13] adoption what is that you are
[1:04:15] predestinated unto the
[1:04:17] placing so that's God's will let's turn
[1:04:21] to John uh 15 together
[1:04:33] John chapter
[1:04:36] 15 we're going to go to verse
[1:04:42] 16 he
[1:04:44] says ye have not chosen me but I have
[1:04:47] chosen you oh I love that friends amen
[1:04:51] you have not chosen me but I've chosen
[1:04:53] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:04:55] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:04:57] fruit should remain that whatsoever you
[1:05:00] shall ask of the father in my name he
[1:05:02] will give it you so Jesus is saying
[1:05:06] you've not chosen me but I've chosen you
[1:05:08] and ordained
[1:05:10] you this word ordained is different than
[1:05:13] other words translated ordained in the
[1:05:14] Bible do you remember when I told you
[1:05:17] that the word adoption comes from two
[1:05:18] Greek words one meaning a son and the
[1:05:20] other meaning to place or
[1:05:22] position this ordained is that second
[1:05:26] word I placed you put you in place I
[1:05:30] positioned you and this is what Jesus is
[1:05:32] telling his disciples says you've not
[1:05:34] chosen me but I've chosen you and
[1:05:36] ordained you placed you that you should
[1:05:39] go and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:05:41] fruit should remain God determined where
[1:05:45] their place would be and 1 Corinthians
[1:05:48] chapter 12 let's turn
[1:05:52] there 1
[1:05:54] Corinthians 12
[1:05:59] 12 and verse 17 1 Corinthians 12:
[1:06:04] 17 in this uh uh portion of the book of
[1:06:07] Corinthians Paul is writing about the
[1:06:09] body and he's typing the natural body
[1:06:11] with the spiritual body with the church
[1:06:13] with the body of Christ and and he's
[1:06:15] running parallels all through there but
[1:06:17] I just want to pull out uh two verses
[1:06:19] verse 17 and 18 he said if the whole
[1:06:22] body were an eye where were the hearing
[1:06:24] if the whole were hearing where the
[1:06:26] smelling but now hath God set the
[1:06:29] members every one of them in the body as
[1:06:32] it hath pleased him amen that is key
[1:06:37] friends that is a key phrase amen it to
[1:06:41] me it doesn't really matter what we
[1:06:44] think amen I I I don't want to say that
[1:06:47] in a derogatory way it matters what we
[1:06:49] think it's important what we think but
[1:06:51] but God has set in the body every member
[1:06:53] as it pleased him amen so whatever he
[1:06:56] determined us to be in whatever position
[1:06:58] he told us to hold or ordained for us to
[1:07:00] hold in the body is according to his
[1:07:03] pleasure according to the uh Good Will
[1:07:05] of his pleasure and it's going to be
[1:07:07] that way so we might desire something
[1:07:10] else for ourselves but Desiring
[1:07:12] something else for ourselves means we're
[1:07:14] no longer about the father's business or
[1:07:16] his
[1:07:17] instructions it means we're not a fit
[1:07:19] son yet for adoption because we want
[1:07:22] something other than what God ordained
[1:07:24] for us right we can say well this is my
[1:07:27] position but I would like to have that
[1:07:28] position well you can't have that
[1:07:31] position because God as it pleased him
[1:07:34] set you in this
[1:07:37] position and listen I tell
[1:07:39] you every other position looks better to
[1:07:42] the one who's in a
[1:07:45] position cuz when you're in a position
[1:07:47] you get the full experience of it and
[1:07:50] The Full Experience is not always
[1:07:51] positive there's self-sacrifice there's
[1:07:54] some negatives there's some things go
[1:07:55] along with it and then when you're in
[1:07:57] this position serving in the capacity
[1:07:59] God's told you to serve you say oh it
[1:08:00] would be great if I was
[1:08:02] this but just as soon as you got over
[1:08:05] there and you started working in that
[1:08:06] position you'd be like oh it'd be great
[1:08:08] if I was over
[1:08:10] here because everything we requires a
[1:08:14] selflessness a sacrifice everything we
[1:08:16] do for the body is something that we
[1:08:18] give of ourselves for the body it's not
[1:08:20] for us it's for the body to benefit the
[1:08:22] body as a whole which means it comes
[1:08:25] with self
[1:08:26] sacrifice amen amen amen and so whatever
[1:08:31] we think and however we think about oh
[1:08:34] you know I just wish I could be a nose I
[1:08:37] wish I could be a finger the thumb is so
[1:08:42] important until you're a thumb and
[1:08:43] you're like why am I always so
[1:08:46] odd why am I always different than
[1:08:48] everybody else around me how come I
[1:08:50] don't fit
[1:08:53] in amen that's the way it is friends
[1:08:57] that's exactly the way it is for us but
[1:08:59] God set us as it pleased him and God
[1:09:04] wants to positionally place us because
[1:09:06] that's the reason we were born into the
[1:09:08] kingdom and in that position there's a
[1:09:11] certain amount of authority and
[1:09:13] responsibility that go
[1:09:16] together let's go to Ephesians chapter 2
[1:09:25] Ephesians chapter
[1:09:31] 2 verse
[1:09:34] 10 for we are his workmanship created in
[1:09:38] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[1:09:41] ha before ordained that we should walk
[1:09:43] in them so we just keep reinforcing the
[1:09:45] same idea that God has done it according
[1:09:48] to his good pleasure amen he's ordained
[1:09:52] it he even knows the very works that
[1:09:53] we're going to do and he's ordained us
[1:09:55] to do those
[1:09:57] Works back in the message of adoption
[1:09:59] this is adoption part one now
[1:10:02] now now who could doubt that that's what
[1:10:05] Paul said that's Paul's scripture that's
[1:10:07] Paul's writing that's what he taught his
[1:10:09] church the church positioning before the
[1:10:11] foundation of the world when God in his
[1:10:13] labor pain was bringing forth bringing
[1:10:15] forth you knowing what you would do he
[1:10:18] positionally placed you into his own
[1:10:21] body then listen what he says next he
[1:10:23] positionally placed you into his own
[1:10:25] body to be a housewife to be a farmer to
[1:10:28] be a preacher to be a prophet to be this
[1:10:31] or to be that he placed you
[1:10:33] position amen and and I go through that
[1:10:37] because it's a little bit stunning when
[1:10:39] you think about it because when we start
[1:10:40] thinking about being positioned in the
[1:10:42] body of Christ we think of only
[1:10:44] spiritual things and we think when we
[1:10:46] say what's my position in the church so
[1:10:48] many people have asked what's my
[1:10:50] position in the church what's my
[1:10:51] position in the body and the
[1:10:52] misconception is is what is the role I
[1:10:56] play during our church
[1:10:58] services well there's only a few people
[1:11:00] that's going to play a role during the
[1:11:02] church services what's everybody else on
[1:11:04] Earth to
[1:11:06] do so what's my position the church is
[1:11:08] not the building and the church is just
[1:11:10] not what happens on Sunday and Wednesday
[1:11:12] the church is the body of Christ and the
[1:11:14] body of Christ has many members and
[1:11:16] every member is there to function in the
[1:11:18] body to the benefit of somebody else in
[1:11:21] the body amen so there's a lot more
[1:11:23] positions than just the position we see
[1:11:26] active when we come together on Sunday
[1:11:27] and
[1:11:28] Wednesday and so he says he positionally
[1:11:31] placed you into his own body to be a
[1:11:34] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:11:38] preacher to be a pro well I understand
[1:11:39] preacher I understand Prophet but how am
[1:11:41] I positionally placed in the body to be
[1:11:43] a
[1:11:45] housewife because God God wants to
[1:11:49] demonstrate his kingdom in a
[1:11:52] housewife and a farmer and whatever the
[1:11:54] occupation or the position amen and the
[1:11:57] reality is we believe that the footsteps
[1:11:59] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:12:01] do we believe that we believe so the
[1:12:03] footsteps of the righteous are order of
[1:12:04] the Lord absolutely that's the truth if
[1:12:07] that's the truth then the position I'm
[1:12:09] in is the position he wants me to be in
[1:12:12] and the problem that I find so many
[1:12:14] times in myself and others is we're
[1:12:16] always looking for another position but
[1:12:19] we're not operating the kingdom in the
[1:12:21] position we have
[1:12:24] now cuz we're always saying what can I
[1:12:26] do for the body what can I do for the
[1:12:28] kingdom what should I be what should I
[1:12:31] do
[1:12:32] relax the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:12:34] order of the Lord he's got you in a
[1:12:37] position live in that position when he
[1:12:40] moves you to another position live in
[1:12:41] that
[1:12:43] position
[1:12:47] amen let's go to some examples let's go
[1:12:51] to Acts chapter n
[1:12:55] there's several scriptures are going to
[1:12:56] read and
[1:12:58] um several weeks ago I was invited to a
[1:13:02] a a lunch and fellowship with the the
[1:13:06] single sisters in the church and I
[1:13:07] really enjoyed that and I I was thinking
[1:13:10] of something to share with them and I
[1:13:11] shared this thought with them I'm not
[1:13:13] going to share the whole thought that I
[1:13:14] shared with them but there was certain
[1:13:16] part of it that really I don't know when
[1:13:18] I started reading it just things started
[1:13:19] clicking for me I really enjoyed I
[1:13:22] really enjoyed it so I'm going to share
[1:13:23] just the point of that and what I was
[1:13:25] doing with them is showing them examples
[1:13:27] of people who are ministering to the
[1:13:29] body but it was in ways that uh you
[1:13:31] wouldn't normally think and I Ed three
[1:13:33] examples of three different women or
[1:13:35] groups of women because I was talking to
[1:13:37] all sisters at that time so you Brothers
[1:13:39] this is all sisters but you're going to
[1:13:41] have to include yourself just like when
[1:13:43] we say Sons the sisters have to include
[1:13:45] themselves so now when I talk about
[1:13:46] these these women these sisters you men
[1:13:48] going to have to include yourself it's
[1:13:50] their turn now Acts chapter 9: 36
[1:13:57] acts
[1:14:00] 9:36 now there was at japa a certain
[1:14:02] disciple named Tabitha which by
[1:14:04] interpretation is called Dorcas this
[1:14:07] woman was full of of good works and arms
[1:14:10] Deeds which she did and it came to pass
[1:14:12] in those days that she was sick and died
[1:14:15] whom when they had washed they laid her
[1:14:16] in an upper chamber and for as much as
[1:14:18] Lydia L Lita was nigh to japa and the
[1:14:23] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:14:25] they sent unto him two men Desiring him
[1:14:27] that he would not delay to come to them
[1:14:30] then Peter arose and went with them when
[1:14:33] he was come they brought him into the
[1:14:35] upper chamber and all the widows stood
[1:14:37] by him weeping and showing the coats and
[1:14:39] garments which Dorcas made while she was
[1:14:41] with them but Peter put them all forth
[1:14:45] and kneeled down and prayed and turned
[1:14:47] him to the body saying Tabatha arise and
[1:14:50] she opened her eyes when she saw Peter
[1:14:52] when she saw when she saw Peter she said
[1:14:55] sat up and he gave her his hand and
[1:14:56] lifted her up and when he had called the
[1:14:58] Saints and widows presented her alive
[1:15:02] praise God so now we have this sister
[1:15:04] named Tabitha which is Dorcas by
[1:15:06] interpretation and she had passed away
[1:15:08] and they went and got Peter when Peter
[1:15:10] comes in the first thing they do is
[1:15:13] start to show her they they start to
[1:15:16] show him the value she is to the
[1:15:22] body what was she doing she was making
[1:15:25] garments and coats and the widows were
[1:15:27] showing she probably made them for more
[1:15:28] than widows but the widows were there
[1:15:29] showing the garments and coats that
[1:15:31] Dorcas had made and and it's amazing to
[1:15:33] me they're presenting to Peter
[1:15:37] tokens of This Woman's
[1:15:39] position and showing the value she has
[1:15:42] to the body and the way she served the
[1:15:45] body oh know I love that now let's go to
[1:15:49] Luke Chapter 2
[1:15:57] Luke Chapter
[1:16:03] 2 Luke
[1:16:08] 2:36 and there was one Anna a propheus
[1:16:12] the daughter of uh fuel the of the tribe
[1:16:15] of Asser she was of great age and had
[1:16:17] lived with a husband 7 years from her
[1:16:19] virginity and she was a widow of about 4
[1:16:22] score and four years which uh departed
[1:16:24] not from the temple but served god with
[1:16:26] fastings and prayers night and day and
[1:16:29] she came in that instance gave thanks
[1:16:31] likewise unto the Lord and spake of him
[1:16:33] to all them that looked for redemption
[1:16:36] in
[1:16:37] Jerusalem so here you have Anna a
[1:16:40] prophetess who never leaves the temple
[1:16:43] and she's in fasting and prayer
[1:16:45] constantly and she recognizes Christ
[1:16:47] also and she goes in declares of him to
[1:16:50] everyone that was looking for Redemption
[1:16:52] now let's go from there to uh Mark
[1:16:56] 15 Mark chapter
[1:17:09] 15 Mark 15:
[1:17:16] 40 and it says in Mark
[1:17:20] 15:40 and there was also women looking
[1:17:22] AAR off this is at the crucifixion among
[1:17:25] whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[1:17:27] mother of James and the Les the less and
[1:17:29] of Joseph and of solom who also when he
[1:17:33] was in Galilee followed him and
[1:17:35] ministered unto him and many other women
[1:17:37] which came up with him unto Jerusalem so
[1:17:41] this word here it says they followed him
[1:17:43] and ministered unto him this word
[1:17:45] Minister means to serve these sisters
[1:17:47] were following Jesus and Jesus's
[1:17:49] Ministry in his travels and they were
[1:17:51] actually cooking food for him and
[1:17:53] serving him
[1:17:55] and so here we've pulled three examples
[1:17:57] and in the three examples the first was
[1:17:59] a sister named Dorcas and she had made
[1:18:02] garments and coats amen for those who
[1:18:04] were in need and they were showing the
[1:18:05] garments and coats the second was Anna a
[1:18:08] prophetess who spent all her time in
[1:18:09] fasting and prayer and third was a group
[1:18:11] of women who followed Jesus around they
[1:18:14] were cooking for him and serving him and
[1:18:16] make sure he had a meal and had rest and
[1:18:17] had the things that he
[1:18:19] needed three completely different works
[1:18:23] in the body and listen the in order to
[1:18:25] to make it like well the best was to do
[1:18:28] what Anna
[1:18:29] did or the best was to do what dor no
[1:18:32] these women did what came natural for
[1:18:35] them because God had ordained a position
[1:18:37] for them when Jesus was on Earth he need
[1:18:39] somebody that was going to cook for him
[1:18:41] and maybe take care of his cleaning who
[1:18:43] knows what else they took care of for
[1:18:44] him but they ministered unto him
[1:18:46] following him about in his ministry amen
[1:18:48] God needed somebody to fulfill that role
[1:18:51] God needed somebody to take care of
[1:18:53] garments and coats for the widows but
[1:18:54] God needed somebody that was given to
[1:18:56] fasting and prayer in the temple day and
[1:18:59] night and these people weren't trying to
[1:19:02] do the best works these people weren't
[1:19:04] trying to find out what's the best thing
[1:19:06] I can do they were actually doing what
[1:19:08] came natural to them amen this message
[1:19:12] doesn't come to bring us into bondage
[1:19:13] the gospel never come to bring us into
[1:19:15] bondage it come to free us from bondage
[1:19:18] to where I don't have to follow somebody
[1:19:20] I don't have to become what I'm not amen
[1:19:23] what God wants me to be is what he
[1:19:25] ordained me to be what he purposed for
[1:19:27] me to be and he wants me to fit into the
[1:19:30] position in the body that he ordained me
[1:19:32] to fit so in order to fit in that
[1:19:34] position it should be a fit like a hand
[1:19:36] in a
[1:19:37] glove amen amen because why this is his
[1:19:42] good pleasure he ordained it he's done
[1:19:45] it as it pleased him God and brother B
[1:19:48] teaches us that God watched over us as
[1:19:51] we came down
[1:19:53] genetically as we came down from
[1:19:55] grandfather grandmother and he and
[1:19:57] brother B said he would breed this one
[1:19:59] to that
[1:20:00] one to get a certain characteristic amen
[1:20:04] he he talked about a man making Chimes
[1:20:05] he would put in so many different metals
[1:20:07] to make a certain alloy to get a certain
[1:20:09] thing he need so much tin and so much
[1:20:11] copper and so much lead and so much of
[1:20:13] these things and to get a certain sound
[1:20:15] because he needed that certain note to
[1:20:17] play so that there could be a piece of
[1:20:19] music that was played and without that
[1:20:21] note it couldn't be played so God God is
[1:20:23] showing amen that down through time he
[1:20:26] has watched over even your physical body
[1:20:29] to get certain characteristics and
[1:20:31] attributes into you because he had
[1:20:33] designed a purpose for you before the
[1:20:35] foundation of the world and he had to
[1:20:37] get the ingredients just right so you
[1:20:39] could express what was in his mind
[1:20:41] before the foundation of the
[1:20:43] world the problem we run into is because
[1:20:46] of the Fall we got a few extra
[1:20:49] ingredients but that's why it takes the
[1:20:51] sword of the word to cut some of those
[1:20:53] off
[1:20:54] that's why we keep coming back under the
[1:20:56] preaching of the word because brother B
[1:20:57] said the end time evangelism is shaping
[1:20:59] the stones to fit into the
[1:21:01] temple and there's got to be a man that
[1:21:04] can take the sword of the word amen and
[1:21:06] begin to shape Stones amen and that
[1:21:08] that's Christ working through his
[1:21:09] fivefold ministry in the end time
[1:21:11] evangelism to shape us because we got a
[1:21:13] few extra ingredients along the way
[1:21:16] because of the Fall we may have got a
[1:21:17] temper we may have got jealousy and we
[1:21:19] may have got a a propensity to lie we
[1:21:21] may have got an extra dose of Pride but
[1:21:23] by the grace of God he's got a sword of
[1:21:25] the word amen and Ministry of the word
[1:21:26] that's going to start cutting that away
[1:21:28] so everything else he put inside of us
[1:21:31] can begin to shine
[1:21:33] forth so when we look at positional
[1:21:40] placing our position is what we've been
[1:21:43] made for amen we've been made for we've
[1:21:48] been shaped for even the shaping of the
[1:21:50] trials and troubles and struggles and
[1:21:52] the good and the bad and everything
[1:21:54] through life
[1:21:55] is all working together for God to place
[1:21:58] Us in the
[1:21:59] body according to his good
[1:22:03] pleasure and don't forget that pleasing
[1:22:05] could be a
[1:22:06] housewife or a farmer or a preacher or a
[1:22:12] prophet and you can fill in all the
[1:22:14] blanks with wherever you are in
[1:22:16] life that could be a positional placing
[1:22:20] in the
[1:22:22] body and that means if God's put put us
[1:22:24] in that position there's a certain
[1:22:27] amount of responsibility he wants to
[1:22:28] give
[1:22:29] us and if that's what's in us to do then
[1:22:34] we have the responsibility to do it
[1:22:36] because it was in Anna to fast and pray
[1:22:39] Anna was responsible to fast and pray am
[1:22:43] that was her position in the body if she
[1:22:45] let it down it was let down because who
[1:22:48] else was going to do
[1:22:50] it right if it was that these group of
[1:22:54] sisters job to minister to Jesus Christ
[1:22:56] along the way in physical Ministry if
[1:22:59] they let down the bar amen who's going
[1:23:01] to M they were ordained for that
[1:23:05] work and so
[1:23:08] we I think we should stop uh this is
[1:23:11] just me we should stop fussing and
[1:23:13] worrying so much about what our position
[1:23:15] is in the church and just do what comes
[1:23:17] natural and trust God to lead and do it
[1:23:20] with all of your heart and do it
[1:23:21] according to his word and do it
[1:23:23] according to his kingom and keep focused
[1:23:26] on the father's business and his
[1:23:29] instructions and just keep focused no
[1:23:31] matter what it is in your heart to do
[1:23:33] keep focused on one thing the father's
[1:23:36] business and his instructions and God
[1:23:38] will use whatever is in your desire for
[1:23:40] his kingdom yeah and if he wants to
[1:23:43] correct you he can correct you if he
[1:23:44] wants to change you he can change you if
[1:23:46] he wants to move you he can move you but
[1:23:48] it's not about us wandering around like
[1:23:50] lost souls trying to find something God
[1:23:52] has made us to do it he is fashioned us
[1:23:55] to do it he's put ingredients in us to
[1:23:57] do it and he pre he predestinated us to
[1:23:59] do it the biggest thing we need to do is
[1:24:01] relax and be about the father's business
[1:24:04] and whatever is in our hand to do do it
[1:24:06] with our
[1:24:07] might whatever God has given us to do
[1:24:10] fully embrace it and do it is if he's
[1:24:12] given you a position in the body fully
[1:24:14] embrace it if he's given you a position
[1:24:16] as a housewife do it as unto the Lord if
[1:24:20] you're a mother amen be the Fifth Gospel
[1:24:23] amen be the preacher to those kids do it
[1:24:25] as part of your kingdom work if you're a
[1:24:27] father lead your family into the ways of
[1:24:29] righteousness because that's the kingdom
[1:24:32] work don't say what's my position are
[1:24:34] you have a family are you married
[1:24:36] there's a position work that according
[1:24:39] to the will of God amen amen
[1:24:43] amen amen and whatever else he has God
[1:24:47] will God's not going to ordain us for
[1:24:50] something and leave the position vacant
[1:24:54] he's going to move us into that position
[1:24:57] because it's his predestinated will it's
[1:25:00] his predestinated
[1:25:02] plan
[1:25:05] Amen brother B says in adoption part two
[1:25:08] he says yep sure
[1:25:11] do uh said the Holy Spirit I've given
[1:25:13] him test this is the holy spirit
[1:25:15] reporting back to the father so this is
[1:25:17] the tutor reporting back to the father
[1:25:19] now brother B's using this in a way of
[1:25:21] dramatizing because who is the Holy
[1:25:23] Spirit it's the spirit of God Amen so
[1:25:27] he's reporting back to the father like
[1:25:29] he's got to go back and report to the
[1:25:30] father we don't have three persons in a
[1:25:33] godhead but he's dramatizing it the holy
[1:25:36] spirit said I give him test boy I tried
[1:25:39] him this way and I tried him that way I
[1:25:42] throwed him down Sick I put him under I
[1:25:45] stomped him I let the devil do
[1:25:47] everything to him he could do he came
[1:25:49] right back up
[1:25:52] again listen
[1:25:54] okay remember what adoption is the
[1:25:57] father wants this son to inherit either
[1:26:00] all the kingdom or a portion of the of
[1:26:03] the estate and so he gives him to the
[1:26:05] best tutor he can to bring the child
[1:26:08] into position to take the position he
[1:26:10] has for him so what does this best tutor
[1:26:12] do here's what he does I've throw him
[1:26:16] down sick I've put him under I stomped
[1:26:19] on him I let the devil do everything to
[1:26:22] him I could do he came right back up
[1:26:25] again oh praise God you mean this
[1:26:28] Troublesome life that I've been living
[1:26:30] it isn't outside the desire of God it
[1:26:32] means it's part of God shaping me for
[1:26:34] the work he wants me to do it means this
[1:26:36] isn't a pointless series of a bunch of
[1:26:38] bad things happening in my life
[1:26:40] absolutely not friends it is ordained of
[1:26:44] God under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] and he's bringing us just as Jesus
[1:26:48] Christ was led to the Wilderness to be
[1:26:50] tempted of the devil God has a plan for
[1:26:52] us and a position we must fit into and
[1:26:55] we've got to learn how to follow the
[1:26:58] father's business and keep his
[1:26:59] instructions despite whatever happens to
[1:27:04] us you know what's so discouraging what
[1:27:07] becomes so discouraging is trial after
[1:27:09] trial after trial with no
[1:27:11] purpose it's just an endless cycle of
[1:27:13] pain and confusion and
[1:27:19] disappointments but when the isav comes
[1:27:22] on when the word of God comes to clear
[1:27:24] away the crust off our eyes we don't see
[1:27:26] it as an endless cycle of pain and
[1:27:28] confusion and suffering we see it as a
[1:27:30] Godly plan to bring us into a great
[1:27:32] position he had for before the
[1:27:34] foundation of the world because if God's
[1:27:36] got to shape me and mold me to bring me
[1:27:38] to a body change to sit with him on his
[1:27:40] throne then I say God shape me God mold
[1:27:43] me if you got to stomp me down if you
[1:27:45] got to put me under if you got to cause
[1:27:47] rejection to come whatever Christ went
[1:27:49] through do you think we're not going to
[1:27:51] go through Jesus Christ and his pilgrim
[1:27:54] he come down the the the the spirit
[1:27:56] descended like a dove claimed this
[1:27:58] vessel dwelt in the vessel what a
[1:28:01] glorious thing from then on it was
[1:28:03] nothing but
[1:28:05] trouble we don't even hear much about
[1:28:08] Jesus's life previous to his baptism and
[1:28:11] previous to his baptism we only have one
[1:28:13] little interjection and that's when he
[1:28:15] was 12 amen uh disputing with them in
[1:28:17] the temple amen but we we don't have any
[1:28:20] reason to believe that for 30 years it
[1:28:22] was like it was after after he was
[1:28:25] claimed as a son after amen he was
[1:28:28] infilled with the fullness of God after
[1:28:30] he was declared to be the son whom I'm
[1:28:32] well pleased we do have record of that
[1:28:34] life from then on and go read the record
[1:28:36] and tell me when did he have A Moment's
[1:28:41] Peace why he was being shaped molded
[1:28:45] tested proved because God had something
[1:28:48] wonderful and glorious for him to do he
[1:28:51] had ordained it so now our Liv shouldn't
[1:28:54] be such a
[1:28:56] mystery we shouldn't be crying out all
[1:28:59] the time God where are you why are you
[1:29:02] letting this happen to me and
[1:29:04] why it doesn't mean that in the times of
[1:29:07] trouble we shouldn't have
[1:29:08] self-reflection we should have
[1:29:10] self-reflection say God is there any way
[1:29:12] I'm not pleasing to you is there
[1:29:13] anything that you want me to do
[1:29:14] different amen are you trying to get my
[1:29:17] attention those things are important
[1:29:19] friends but I've said to many many
[1:29:21] people when I've talked to them about
[1:29:23] this I say this once you've reflected
[1:29:26] and once you've asked God don't start
[1:29:28] making up
[1:29:30] stuff right because that's what we tend
[1:29:33] to
[1:29:34] do we tend to think this has to be
[1:29:37] happening for a reason Maybe I'm Wrong
[1:29:40] somewhere and we start overanalyzing
[1:29:42] things and we start making things a
[1:29:44] problem that weren't a
[1:29:46] problem I believe if God is correcting
[1:29:49] us and chastising us it's in his best
[1:29:51] interest to tell us what he's chastising
[1:29:53] us for amen he doesn't keep it a secret
[1:29:55] I'm just going to Chas but I'm not going
[1:29:57] to tell him why because the whole point
[1:29:58] of chastising is correction so we won't
[1:30:00] do it again so why would he keep it a
[1:30:02] secret why would it be a mystery what we
[1:30:04] did wrong if the whole point of
[1:30:06] chastisement is correction to change our
[1:30:08] Behavior I believe if we've done
[1:30:10] something wrong God would show us so
[1:30:11] after a time of self-reflection then
[1:30:13] just settle in and say God's working
[1:30:15] something in my life he's molding my
[1:30:17] character he's proving me he's
[1:30:18] demonstrating something he's living his
[1:30:20] word through me he's shaping me for
[1:30:21] something else Glory to
[1:30:25] God Amen it's that attitude that takes
[1:30:30] hopelessness away it's that attitude
[1:30:34] that we we as sons of God we know the
[1:30:36] Revelation in our hearts and we know
[1:30:38] what God has told us through this
[1:30:39] messenger and this end time what he
[1:30:40] showed us in his word and we know that
[1:30:43] God is not purposeless in the things he
[1:30:45] he's
[1:30:46] purposeful and my life is not a vain
[1:30:50] empty
[1:30:52] treasury my life is to to serve a I'm on
[1:30:55] this Earth for the years I'm here to
[1:30:56] serve uh on this Earth to serve a
[1:30:58] purpose in the kingdom of God that God
[1:31:01] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:31:03] world and he wants to do something it
[1:31:04] may still yet be a mystery me to me and
[1:31:07] I may not have a full picture of what it
[1:31:09] is but I believe it's there and I
[1:31:11] believe he's working and all I need to
[1:31:12] do is trust that the father is
[1:31:15] responsible to bring me to adoption and
[1:31:17] everything he has the tutor do in my
[1:31:19] life is for the end purpose
[1:31:24] that's
[1:31:25] right so I'm going to read this again
[1:31:28] I've throw him down sick I've put him
[1:31:31] under I stomped him I let the devil do
[1:31:33] everything to him he could do he come
[1:31:35] right back up
[1:31:36] again he come the same come up again I
[1:31:39] made him sick I done this I throwed him
[1:31:41] in the hospital I took him out there and
[1:31:43] I done this I done that I turned his
[1:31:45] wife against him I turned his neighbor
[1:31:47] against him I turned
[1:31:49] everything that didn't make a bit of
[1:31:51] difference said though he slay me yet
[1:31:54] will I trust him I killed his
[1:31:57] family I took this I did this I done
[1:32:01] this I did this that the other still he
[1:32:04] stood right up though he slay me yet
[1:32:07] I'll serve him he's mine what was this
[1:32:09] son showing that he was in love with the
[1:32:12] father's business and the father's
[1:32:14] instructions right if God purposed for
[1:32:17] me to walk this path then glory be to
[1:32:19] God let me walk it according to his word
[1:32:22] so that he gets the glory and whatever
[1:32:24] he wants to do in my
[1:32:27] life he said he goes on in the message
[1:32:30] oh well I believe we ought to call him
[1:32:32] out somewhere to a little special place
[1:32:34] and have an
[1:32:35] adoption now when the father in the Old
[1:32:37] Testament understood that his son was
[1:32:39] come of age and he had been seasoned out
[1:32:41] into adoption they've borned a child but
[1:32:44] they're they're a son right then but
[1:32:47] then they never they'll never be no more
[1:32:49] than just a child just an ordinary son
[1:32:51] until they mature and show what they are
[1:32:54] then he calls him out then now here we
[1:32:57] are church are you ready now it's a
[1:32:59] little bit late everybody bite your
[1:33:00] finger pinch your soul pluck your heart
[1:33:02] just for a minute now we're going to to
[1:33:05] place the church now when the church
[1:33:07] gets to that place he says manasse You
[1:33:10] Belong over here Ephraim you over here
[1:33:14] then he takes them out to a certain
[1:33:15] place the father does and he sets him up
[1:33:17] on a high place like this and he has a
[1:33:20] ceremony and they all come around and he
[1:33:22] said I want everyone to know that this
[1:33:24] is my child and I adopt my son and I
[1:33:27] want everyone to know from hence forth
[1:33:30] that I dress him up a special dress on
[1:33:32] him and I want you to know that that his
[1:33:35] name is just as good on any check as my
[1:33:37] name is he's my child I adopt him into
[1:33:40] my family although he's been my son
[1:33:42] since he was born since he received the
[1:33:45] Holy Ghost he's been my son but now I'm
[1:33:47] going to place him positionally in
[1:33:49] Authority what he fires is fired what he
[1:33:52] hires is hired amen amen amen
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:59] amen you know we look at great big
[1:34:02] things but brother M taught us stop
[1:34:04] looking at great big
[1:34:06] things start looking at where you
[1:34:08] are if you're a father in your home and
[1:34:11] a spirit starts getting a comes against
[1:34:14] your home whoever you fire is
[1:34:19] fired you've been given Authority in
[1:34:22] your position to take Dominion over your
[1:34:24] own
[1:34:25] hous why cuz you're the father you're
[1:34:28] the gatekeeper God gave those that wife
[1:34:30] to you gave those children to you you're
[1:34:32] the
[1:34:33] father don't be afraid to exercise your
[1:34:35] rights as a father sir don't move
[1:34:38] outside your boundary but within your
[1:34:40] boundary in the estate that he's given
[1:34:41] you okay son I'm giving you I trust you
[1:34:44] to raise these these
[1:34:46] Souls you know if God put you in a
[1:34:48] position he trust you to operate in that
[1:34:52] position see we're plagued because of
[1:34:55] humanity we're plagued with self-doubt
[1:34:57] and self-
[1:34:58] reses we're we we we understand what it
[1:35:01] means to be fearful to be reserved to to
[1:35:04] to have uh uh restraint and self-doubt
[1:35:06] and we we all know what that feels like
[1:35:11] but if God's put you in that position
[1:35:12] don't be afraid of that position if
[1:35:15] God's called you to be a mother amen
[1:35:17] then you you take authority as a mother
[1:35:20] you have a right over that jurisdiction
[1:35:22] of those Souls of your child Amen to be
[1:35:25] a preacher a pastor to them to be the
[1:35:27] Fifth Gospel to them and to keep your
[1:35:29] home in a certain way and you've got
[1:35:31] Authority and anything that comes
[1:35:33] against that you've got the right
[1:35:34] spiritually to resist
[1:35:36] it amen God trusted you yeah if you have
[1:35:40] a position in the church God trusted you
[1:35:41] to have that position don't be afraid to
[1:35:45] take the position God's put you
[1:35:47] in why because it's all part of his
[1:35:52] program when we when we go to the
[1:35:54] workplace don't be afraid if God's
[1:35:56] called you to be a farmer don't be
[1:35:57] afraid to be a farmer or whatever trade
[1:35:59] don't be afraid of the position you're
[1:36:01] in amen if you've got a coworker who
[1:36:03] trust in you and they ask you for prayer
[1:36:04] don't be afraid to take authority in the
[1:36:06] position God put you in don't be afraid
[1:36:10] to be a son wherever he's placed you
[1:36:13] don't be afraid and if we keep looking
[1:36:16] to something else will happen in my life
[1:36:17] and I'll be somewhere else and God will
[1:36:18] move me somewhere else we're missing
[1:36:20] exactly where he wants us to take
[1:36:21] dominion and take authority
[1:36:24] we're missing the
[1:36:25] responsibility and the authority that
[1:36:27] he's given us in our
[1:36:30] position so
[1:36:34] God God is showing brother B is showing
[1:36:37] us
[1:36:38] here that when we come to adoption under
[1:36:41] the tutelage now remember I want you to
[1:36:43] remember we're talking about personal
[1:36:45] adoption of placing in the body of
[1:36:46] Christ but we're talking about ultimate
[1:36:48] adoption too so we're still in the path
[1:36:51] is the Holy Ghost still your tutor amen
[1:36:55] amen so we go back
[1:36:58] to the Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost put the boy under all kinds of
[1:37:03] tests throwed him down Sick put him
[1:37:06] under stomped him let the devil do
[1:37:09] anything he could he turned his wife
[1:37:12] against him turned his neighbor against
[1:37:13] him killed his family did this that and
[1:37:16] the
[1:37:18] other but all those things were
[1:37:20] necessary in the training of the boy
[1:37:24] and all those things are necessary in
[1:37:26] our
[1:37:27] training because to come to the fullness
[1:37:31] of adoption for us we we we're going to
[1:37:34] have to grow all the way to the body
[1:37:38] change and this church has got to grow
[1:37:40] to Perfection to full maturity to
[1:37:42] completion and I believe this is the
[1:37:44] generation that it has to happen in amen
[1:37:46] according to the prophecy according to
[1:37:48] the word it has to happen in this
[1:37:50] generation and God is going to have to
[1:37:52] train us and teach us and what is he
[1:37:54] trying to teach us he's trying to teach
[1:37:56] us to love the father's business and to
[1:38:00] keep his
[1:38:02] instructions to me I believe that's the
[1:38:04] lesson that he's trying to get over to
[1:38:06] us what Jesus learned the bride of
[1:38:09] Christ is
[1:38:12] learning brother bam said in the
[1:38:14] Philadelphian Church age out of the
[1:38:16] church age book he makes a statement
[1:38:18] that I I really enjoyed he says you see
[1:38:21] the spirit is speaking about the word of
[1:38:22] God which is given to us to wait for the
[1:38:25] Fulfillment of that word required
[1:38:27] patience even as it did in the case of
[1:38:29] Abraham he endured a seeing him who is
[1:38:32] invisible he was patient and then the
[1:38:34] word finally was fulfilled this is the
[1:38:37] way God teaches his people patience
[1:38:39] remember we're still learning we're not
[1:38:44] done if he fulfilled his word in
[1:38:46] physical manifestation the very instant
[1:38:48] you prayed you would never learn
[1:38:50] patience but would become even more
[1:38:52] impatient with love
[1:38:54] life so what are these trials doing what
[1:38:58] is this I've got this God I've come to
[1:39:01] you with this problem and I know your
[1:39:03] word says and I know you've promised and
[1:39:05] I believe your word God I'm trusting in
[1:39:08] you I don't understand why it hasn't
[1:39:10] gone
[1:39:12] away this is how he teaches his
[1:39:16] children because if every time as the
[1:39:19] children of God if every time we had
[1:39:21] prayed it'd come into instant
[1:39:22] manifestation
[1:39:24] we would actually become more impatient
[1:39:27] with life not more patience and the
[1:39:30] greater impatience would create a
[1:39:33] character flaw that would actually
[1:39:34] hinder us when we come into needing to
[1:39:36] have greater manifestation in times of
[1:39:39] trouble so God in his goodness I I I I I
[1:39:45] don't know I just don't know for sure
[1:39:47] I'm just going to share something with
[1:39:48] you I don't know for sure this is just
[1:39:50] brother Chad completely but if God is
[1:39:53] moving us amen into this position of of
[1:39:56] full adoption the change in the body if
[1:39:58] he's adopting the church and he's going
[1:39:59] to display the church under its full
[1:40:01] maturity at the very end of the end time
[1:40:04] we know the things the prophet said that
[1:40:06] there's going to be difficulties coming
[1:40:07] to that time exactly the way they were
[1:40:09] for Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ
[1:40:12] came to those difficulties it got more
[1:40:14] and more and more difficult and the and
[1:40:16] the level of the supernatural became
[1:40:19] more and more and more diminished until
[1:40:21] at the end the very spirit of God leaves
[1:40:23] him and he feels like he's abandoned and
[1:40:25] all by
[1:40:27] himself by the time he gets to that
[1:40:29] position he's going to have to know how
[1:40:31] to move in the word know his position
[1:40:33] and know how to hold steady and trust in
[1:40:36] God because he's not feeling much at
[1:40:39] that time he's not seeing everything
[1:40:41] around him is absolutely negative at
[1:40:43] that time he's been betrayed all his
[1:40:45] disciples run away from him he's under
[1:40:47] trial the government is conspiring or
[1:40:49] the the the priesthood is conspiring
[1:40:51] with the government there's a coalition
[1:40:52] coming together everything everything
[1:40:55] around him is coming to take him out and
[1:40:58] he has to stand with patience and trust
[1:41:01] God now if there's any semblance of that
[1:41:04] even a fraction of that that's coming
[1:41:05] for the bride in the end time then I
[1:41:07] think as we near that God's going to
[1:41:09] have to train us to stand in that day
[1:41:11] and how will he train us to stand in
[1:41:13] that day maybe he needs to teach us more
[1:41:15] patience than we have to have now and
[1:41:17] how does he teach us Patience by not
[1:41:19] allowing it to happen the moment we pray
[1:41:21] it doesn't come to instant manifestation
[1:41:23] he's teaching us to trust him he's
[1:41:26] teaching us to love the kingdom and stay
[1:41:28] within the instructions and watch God
[1:41:35] work amen now I say that's just me just
[1:41:38] seeing what Jesus went through the
[1:41:39] things that brother Benham said it could
[1:41:41] be completely different than my
[1:41:43] understanding but I believe that the
[1:41:44] responsibility of the father bringing us
[1:41:46] to adoption he will he will have us
[1:41:49] prepped he will have us trained he will
[1:41:52] have us taught how to to handle that
[1:41:56] hour and what do you think's happening
[1:41:58] right now in our lives as we constantly
[1:42:00] have one trial after another trial one
[1:42:03] circumstance after another I believe the
[1:42:06] father has the tutor preparing us for
[1:42:08] that
[1:42:09] hour amen what is it that I need more
[1:42:12] than anything else to focus on what
[1:42:14] should I be doing God where should I be
[1:42:16] going what work should I be doing amen I
[1:42:19] after reading these quotes the one thing
[1:42:21] that's come alive to me is there's two
[1:42:23] things that I need to focus on more than
[1:42:25] anything that's the father's
[1:42:27] business it's got to become priority
[1:42:30] focus in my life that I love his
[1:42:32] business not my own right because the
[1:42:35] problem with us is we still love our own
[1:42:36] business we still have our own agenda
[1:42:38] and our own things that we want to
[1:42:39] accomplish and not all of that is evil
[1:42:41] some of that goes right along with the
[1:42:43] business of the father but my priority
[1:42:45] has to be the business of the father my
[1:42:47] love has to be his kingdom
[1:42:51] work and two
[1:42:53] I have to follow his
[1:42:57] instructions and now I may not
[1:42:59] understand everything that's happening
[1:43:00] or how it plays in or or or why it's
[1:43:03] happening or what God's trying to do I
[1:43:04] don't know if he's trying to teach me
[1:43:06] character I don't know trying if he's
[1:43:07] trying to display an attribute through
[1:43:09] me to so I don't know I have no idea but
[1:43:12] one thing I know is what he wants from
[1:43:14] me is for me to love his business and to
[1:43:16] keep his
[1:43:17] Commandments to stay with his word
[1:43:20] regardless
[1:43:24] so I want to be
[1:43:26] able I want to be able to fulfill that
[1:43:30] above everything
[1:43:33] else brother bam goes on in this same
[1:43:37] quote he says he quotes Hebrews 11:17 by
[1:43:41] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[1:43:43] up Isaac and he that had received the
[1:43:45] promise the word of God offered up his
[1:43:46] only begotten son there it is there is
[1:43:50] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:43:52] promise of the word
[1:43:54] most think that as soon as we pray in
[1:43:55] jesus' name over the good Promises of
[1:43:58] God that there could there could not be
[1:44:00] a trial but here it says that Abra
[1:44:03] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:44:06] promise that is exactly correct
[1:44:09] according to the psalmist referring to
[1:44:10] Joseph 1059 uh that's is Psalms 10519
[1:44:14] until the time that his word came the
[1:44:16] word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us
[1:44:19] exceeding great and precious promises he
[1:44:21] has promised to fulfill them he will but
[1:44:24] from the time we pray until the time we
[1:44:26] get the answer we must learn to receive
[1:44:29] patience into our souls for only in
[1:44:31] patience do we possess
[1:44:36] life do you believe that we're coming to
[1:44:38] the fullness of adoption to the change
[1:44:40] of the body do you believe the church is
[1:44:42] coming to adoption to full
[1:44:46] maturity amen then he's training
[1:44:51] us he's training us in this
[1:44:54] work why because it's the father who
[1:44:57] wants to bring us to adoption it's not
[1:45:01] us I don't say that as if we don't also
[1:45:03] want it but it's the good pleasure of
[1:45:06] his will it's what he's ordained and
[1:45:10] what he's purposed and he and he wants
[1:45:12] it and he's going to have it and in his
[1:45:15] goodness he's watching over the whole
[1:45:17] adoption
[1:45:18] process and he's making sure that we
[1:45:22] have every everything we need to make it
[1:45:26] to adoption we have the tutor we have
[1:45:29] the word we have instruction now we're
[1:45:31] going to have patience we're going to
[1:45:34] have self-sacrifice we're going to have
[1:45:35] denial we're going to have faith we're
[1:45:37] going to have courage we're going to
[1:45:38] have everything that we need and he's
[1:45:41] looking after it to make sure that under
[1:45:43] the tutelage of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:45:45] himself his spirit in us he's bringing
[1:45:47] us to everything we need to take that
[1:45:50] final position
[1:45:58] in James chapter 1 I'm just going to
[1:46:01] read it to James chapter 1 says my
[1:46:03] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[1:46:05] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[1:46:07] that the trying of your faith work is
[1:46:09] patience but let patience have her
[1:46:11] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:46:14] entire wanting nothing so this thing we
[1:46:18] talk about patience it's not a little
[1:46:21] thing it's not just a side
[1:46:22] characteristic but but when patience has
[1:46:26] her perfect work it'll make you perfect
[1:46:28] that's fully mature and entire that's
[1:46:32] complete and wanting nothing so this
[1:46:35] work of patience that he's working in
[1:46:37] our lives I mean what is it you're going
[1:46:39] through what is it you need an answer
[1:46:40] for what is it that's come about again
[1:46:42] and again and again and you don't see
[1:46:44] the light at the end of the tunnel what
[1:46:45] is that maybe that's the father working
[1:46:48] patience in your life because patience
[1:46:50] when it's done her perfect work will
[1:46:52] make you perfect entire wanting nothing
[1:46:55] maybe that's the very love of the father
[1:46:57] bringing you to the position he wants
[1:46:59] you to be in praise be to
[1:47:03] God this word patience means
[1:47:06] enduring
[1:47:08] steadfastness constancy
[1:47:10] endurance praise God it it gives this
[1:47:14] description said in the New Testament
[1:47:15] the characteristic of a man who is not
[1:47:18] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[1:47:20] his loyalty to Faith and piety by even
[1:47:22] the greatest trials and sufferings
[1:47:24] patiently and
[1:47:26] steadfastly oh I want to read that again
[1:47:30] I'm going to read that again this is
[1:47:32] this is when James says the trying of
[1:47:35] your faith worketh patience and patience
[1:47:38] when she's done a per this is the
[1:47:39] patience this is what patience
[1:47:41] is steadfastness constancy endurance in
[1:47:45] the New Testament the characteristic of
[1:47:47] a man who is not swered from his
[1:47:49] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[1:47:52] Fai faith and piety by even the greatest
[1:47:54] trials and sufferings patiently and
[1:47:57] steadfastly he his sufferings are
[1:47:59] patiently and steadfast amen what can I
[1:48:02] do to please God Amen brother B told us
[1:48:04] in the message I know he said Sunny
[1:48:07] bright skies and cloudless days they no
[1:48:09] sign of God's approval neither are
[1:48:10] cloudy skies and rain and all these
[1:48:12] things signs of his disapproval his his
[1:48:15] love is proved to us in the Beloved that
[1:48:17] we were chosen in the Beloved election
[1:48:19] is his love for
[1:48:20] us so we don't we can't doubt God's love
[1:48:24] in the midst of a trial because we're
[1:48:25] elected how do we know we're elected
[1:48:27] because he revealed it to us amen he
[1:48:29] brought us into the revelation of the
[1:48:31] hour showing us who we really
[1:48:34] are so I can't doubt that now he's
[1:48:37] revealed
[1:48:38] it and he loves me oh yes he loves me
[1:48:42] even when the cloudy skies are bursting
[1:48:44] forth and the rain is coming amen he
[1:48:46] still loves
[1:48:48] me but but listen to what he says next
[1:48:51] but how can I prove my love to him by
[1:48:53] conducting myself with joy in the midst
[1:48:56] of the trials that he sees fit to let
[1:48:58] come my
[1:49:00] way
[1:49:02] amen I pray that God brings us into a
[1:49:05] revelation of
[1:49:07] adoption to where to where when things
[1:49:11] are going sideways and backwards are
[1:49:13] upside down and mean that we don't lose
[1:49:15] our minds that's what that's what I've
[1:49:16] wanted all my life and all of especially
[1:49:18] my Christian Life I just want to be
[1:49:20] stable and steadfast and trust God I I
[1:49:23] can't control my emotions always the
[1:49:25] emotions go everywhere but I want an
[1:49:26] anchor deeper that'll pull the emotions
[1:49:28] down and say wait a minute wait a minute
[1:49:31] God never changed his mind about me he
[1:49:33] can't change his word it's still the
[1:49:35] promise is still true regardless of what
[1:49:37] these eyes see or this mind thinks or
[1:49:40] these emotions feel the word is true and
[1:49:42] I'm putting all my faith in
[1:49:45] him amen I tell you friends I'm not
[1:49:48] there yet but that's where I want to be
[1:49:50] I want to be a son that he can trust I
[1:49:52] want to be a son that shows my love for
[1:49:54] him how do I prove my love for him by
[1:49:57] conducting myself with joy in the midst
[1:49:58] of the trial you know how hard that is
[1:50:01] it's the hardest thing in the
[1:50:04] world how are we going to do that beat
[1:50:06] down knocked down made sick wife turned
[1:50:08] against neighbor turned against us
[1:50:10] everything turned against us how are we
[1:50:11] going to still prove our love to him by
[1:50:13] saying God I thank you for everything I
[1:50:16] know this has a purpose amen how do we
[1:50:18] get to this position it's the revelation
[1:50:20] of the message it's the only isap that
[1:50:22] can take the scales away so where life
[1:50:25] circumstances doesn't keep tripping us
[1:50:27] up remember when we go into the holy of
[1:50:30] holies in the temple and the journey to
[1:50:32] the holiest of holies where it's just
[1:50:34] you and God Alone that Journey has to go
[1:50:37] through stages and the first stage is
[1:50:39] the is from outside of the camp of God
[1:50:42] outside of God totally ignorant to the
[1:50:44] things of God now you come through the
[1:50:46] gate Amen to the sacrificial altar to
[1:50:48] recognize Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:50:51] and as you move in there you're now
[1:50:52] walled off from the world Amen but
[1:50:55] there's no covering for you so if it's
[1:50:57] sunny it's outside it's sunny on you if
[1:50:59] it's rainy outside is rainy on you your
[1:51:03] emotions are up and down and whatever is
[1:51:05] happening to the world is having an
[1:51:06] effect on you but that's not the end of
[1:51:08] our journey we got to get to God where
[1:51:11] it's just me and God as one unit and to
[1:51:14] do that I've got to go from the outer
[1:51:16] Court into the inner court amen where
[1:51:18] now I have the light of the messengers
[1:51:20] of the light of the word the showbread
[1:51:21] of Fellowship the table of incense when
[1:51:23] my prayers are before God and when I
[1:51:25] move in there now the curtain falls
[1:51:27] behind me now if it's sunny outside I'm
[1:51:29] not aware I've got another light if it's
[1:51:32] dark outside I'm not aware if it's
[1:51:34] raining I'm unaware amen I'm not
[1:51:36] affected by those things anymore I'm
[1:51:38] still here I'm here I'm approaching to
[1:51:41] God I'm moving
[1:51:43] closer but that's not the destination
[1:51:46] because brother brandom said that bread
[1:51:48] grows old it had to be eaten every week
[1:51:50] and replenished amen and these this this
[1:51:53] lamp stand it carboned up the Wicks had
[1:51:55] to be trimmed and the oil had to be put
[1:51:56] back in he said that's not enough that's
[1:51:58] just a stage on the journey but we've
[1:52:00] got to go beyond that last Veil into the
[1:52:03] holy of holies now brother said there's
[1:52:06] a lot of people outside the gate then
[1:52:09] there's still a lot of people in the
[1:52:11] outer court but fewer people in the
[1:52:13] inner court amen in the Holy place but
[1:52:15] when you get to the holy of holies
[1:52:17] there's only two you and God and you're
[1:52:19] becoming one and in there there's the
[1:52:22] light that won't fade won't carbon up
[1:52:24] doesn't need anything doesn't need
[1:52:26] maintenance doesn't need attention
[1:52:28] that's a fire of God burning in your
[1:52:30] soul where's the holy place in
[1:52:33] you we got to get out of this outer
[1:52:35] Court out of the inner court and down
[1:52:37] into the place where that light never
[1:52:39] Fades no matter what happens to the
[1:52:41] place where there's a bread down in
[1:52:43] there and that's the that's the holy
[1:52:45] Mana of God that in the presence of God
[1:52:47] that word never grows old never grows
[1:52:49] stale but is as fresh as the day it fell
[1:52:53] amen and God's there
[1:52:56] himself amen that's our journey that's
[1:53:00] where we're going that's where I want to
[1:53:02] be if there's war outside doesn't
[1:53:07] matter if there's a Tumo it doesn't
[1:53:10] matter times are good doesn't matter
[1:53:12] times are bad it doesn't matter if the
[1:53:14] economy is good the econom is bad
[1:53:16] nothing matters cuz here I have light
[1:53:18] here I have life here I have bread here
[1:53:20] I have everything that I need is applied
[1:53:22] to me right here and this holy of
[1:53:26] holies that's where I believe God's
[1:53:29] growing us to that's where I want to be
[1:53:32] that's why when brother brenon preached
[1:53:34] the the Rapture amen he goes to the
[1:53:36] psalm and he says thou has hidden me in
[1:53:39] thy Tabernacle in the privacy of thy
[1:53:41] Pavilion where where was David amen when
[1:53:43] all my enemies were gathered about me
[1:53:46] when they desired to eat up my flesh
[1:53:48] what's he preaching he's preaching the
[1:53:49] Rapture message he's preaching the end
[1:53:51] time events that lead lead up to the
[1:53:52] change of the body and where do we find
[1:53:55] God's chosen we find him in a tabernacle
[1:53:58] up on a rock with his head above his
[1:54:00] enemies what's that rock that's the
[1:54:02] revelation of Jesus Christ the
[1:54:03] Revelation that's contained in this
[1:54:05] message set him up on the safety of a
[1:54:07] rock head above all the heads of the
[1:54:09] enemies greater understanding greater
[1:54:11] Revelation and in there
[1:54:14] amen he's
[1:54:17] communing with God trouble all around
[1:54:20] him but there's no trouble in this
[1:54:24] Pavilion I want to get to the place
[1:54:26] where there's trouble all around me and
[1:54:29] that trouble can affect this flesh and
[1:54:32] that trouble can affect this mind yeah
[1:54:35] but I want to go deeper than my flesh
[1:54:37] and my mind cuz the answer is in the
[1:54:41] soul it's the holy
[1:54:44] Place praise be to
[1:54:47] God Amen when we come back to adoption
[1:54:54] he
[1:54:59] says I'm going to read just a couple
[1:55:01] quotes out of adoption and then we're
[1:55:02] going to come to a close said did you
[1:55:05] notice Moses that great miracle
[1:55:06] performer that brought down Israel down
[1:55:08] through the land and brought them up to
[1:55:10] the promised land but did not Place
[1:55:12] their inheritance to them he did not
[1:55:14] give them their inheritance he led them
[1:55:16] up to the land but Joshua divided the
[1:55:17] land to the people is that right and
[1:55:19] Christ brought the church up to the
[1:55:21] place where their possession was made to
[1:55:23] them was given to them just the Jordan
[1:55:26] to cross but the holy spirit is the one
[1:55:29] who sets the church in order the Joshua
[1:55:32] of today puts the church in its order
[1:55:34] giving to each one gifts places position
[1:55:37] and he's the voice of God speaking to
[1:55:39] the inner man that Christ has saved the
[1:55:42] holy
[1:55:43] spirit so this Joshua of today is the
[1:55:47] Holy Spirit and he's the one putting you
[1:55:49] into place and giving gifts and
[1:55:50] operations
[1:55:52] but he's also the voice of God speaking
[1:55:54] in the Inner Man
[1:55:59] Amen brother man makes this statement an
[1:56:02] adoption and he's typing our adoption
[1:56:05] with Crossing Jordan and going into the
[1:56:07] promised land which was their land
[1:56:09] flowing with milk and honey all the
[1:56:10] promises were
[1:56:12] there and he says this he says in this
[1:56:14] Promised Land everything belongs to us
[1:56:16] in the promised land see it brother
[1:56:18] Colin see everything in the promised
[1:56:19] land when Israel crossed over the Jordan
[1:56:21] into the Promised Land fought down
[1:56:23] everything now remember in this promised
[1:56:26] land that don't mean that you're immune
[1:56:28] from sickness that don't mean that
[1:56:30] you're immune from troubles but it does
[1:56:32] spell this oh let this sink deep it says
[1:56:35] this that it's yours just rise and take
[1:56:39] it it doesn't mean that you're you're
[1:56:42] immune from sickness you're immune from
[1:56:43] trou what it means is everything God
[1:56:45] promised you is yours in this promised
[1:56:47] land under the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:49] you're a son you're coming to adoption
[1:56:51] amen it's yours just fight for it just
[1:56:54] take the authority they gave you and
[1:56:55] take the word and go fight for what's
[1:56:57] yours doesn't mean there's not trouble
[1:57:00] doesn't mean there's not sickness under
[1:57:02] adoption amen but what it does mean is
[1:57:04] you have been given the promised word
[1:57:07] for this hour amen and it can be on your
[1:57:09] lips it can be in your heart and be on
[1:57:11] your
[1:57:12] lips we can fight
[1:57:16] back and in in the adoption story when
[1:57:20] brother R's typing it with the natural
[1:57:21] now he shows now the tutors giving back
[1:57:24] a report to the
[1:57:26] father says after a while the years
[1:57:28] passed by father asked how's he getting
[1:57:31] along oh my he's even growing in
[1:57:36] Grace I'm telling you he's really why he
[1:57:39] takes them sheep can handle them just
[1:57:41] like you
[1:57:43] do I think to me this highlighted
[1:57:46] something for me that began to stand out
[1:57:49] the whole purpose of adoption was to get
[1:57:52] the son to be just like the
[1:57:56] father because the father it took the
[1:57:59] father to bring the estate to where it
[1:58:01] was yeah it took the thinking of the
[1:58:04] Father the the rules of the Father the
[1:58:07] temperament of the Father the character
[1:58:08] of the father it took the father to get
[1:58:10] to the state where it was the only way
[1:58:13] that he could turn that estate over to
[1:58:14] someone else is if they could come in
[1:58:16] the same thinking that he had it's the
[1:58:19] only way to EXC secure the State amen
[1:58:22] and now the the the Holy Ghost is saying
[1:58:25] he handles the she he's doing it just
[1:58:27] like you oh you should have seen him
[1:58:29] down there when he was selling that
[1:58:30] bunch of hay amen and how he barred he
[1:58:32] did it just the way you did it amen he
[1:58:34] handles the Sheep just the way you
[1:58:35] handle the Sheep
[1:58:38] he what's the goal what is our goal in
[1:58:41] adoption friends our goal is to come
[1:58:43] into the very image of Jesus Christ to
[1:58:45] be just like what he was on this Earth
[1:58:47] what was he he was somebody that was
[1:58:49] always about the father's business and
[1:58:51] kept all the
[1:58:54] word amen that's why for us we've been
[1:58:57] given a treasure Trove of the scriptures
[1:58:59] which is the mind of God the the the
[1:59:01] examples where God overcome and how he
[1:59:03] overcome and what character it took to
[1:59:05] overcome and so now when we're looking
[1:59:06] to overcome let's look to the scriptures
[1:59:09] amen and not use reasoning and find
[1:59:11] where did God overcome I want to
[1:59:13] overcome the way my father overcame I
[1:59:15] want to overcome by faith I want to
[1:59:17] overcome by the word I want to overcome
[1:59:18] by the promise I want to stand fast I
[1:59:21] want to believe and in spite of all the
[1:59:23] obstacles I want to stand flat-footed
[1:59:25] and believe the word of God cuz that's
[1:59:27] the example that I saw that's how we
[1:59:29] overcome and every other Overcomer he
[1:59:31] overcame that way that's what I want to
[1:59:35] be amen let's look to the word and let's
[1:59:38] be just like
[1:59:40] him I'm going to finish with this
[1:59:42] thought I just want to wrap up with this
[1:59:45] thought and I want to look at the
[1:59:47] prophet of God because I believe the
[1:59:49] prophet came to adoption
[1:59:52] amen I believe he's a wave sheath he's
[1:59:54] an example to us come to
[1:59:57] adoption and remember there's a
[1:59:59] positional placing you can be placed in
[2:00:02] a position in the
[2:00:04] family and then he can place you in
[2:00:07] another position in the family but the
[2:00:09] ultimate positioning is going to be the
[2:00:12] change of the
[2:00:14] body brother says then one day in Sabino
[2:00:17] Canyon while God called me early in the
[2:00:18] morning up there I was up with my hands
[2:00:20] in the air praying in a sword come into
[2:00:22] my hands you know I stood there and
[2:00:24] looked at it just natural as my hand is
[2:00:26] now not knowing what it meant and it was
[2:00:28] left me with a voice that said this is
[2:00:30] the sword of the king and then later
[2:00:32] when the angel of the Lord revealed it
[2:00:34] it was the word in the hand immediately
[2:00:37] after that the angel of the Lord
[2:00:39] appeared and told about the seven TR or
[2:00:40] the Seven Seals that I was to return
[2:00:43] back to Jeffersonville and preach the
[2:00:45] Sev
[2:00:47] seals what was taking place when that
[2:00:49] sword came into the prophet's hands
[2:00:53] it was brother Bram said it was the word
[2:00:55] in the hand so that sword there's only
[2:00:58] one sword it's the sword of the spirit
[2:01:00] which is the word of the
[2:01:01] Lord and he says it fit my hand listen
[2:01:05] how he said he he just fit my hand that
[2:01:09] means his hand was a perfect match to
[2:01:11] the sword amen
[2:01:14] amen do you remember how when Elijah
[2:01:17] threw his mantle over Elisha brother B
[2:01:20] said it didn't fit
[2:01:22] threw his mantle over Elisha but it
[2:01:24] didn't fit Elisha had some growing up to
[2:01:26] do and in following Elijah he would grow
[2:01:30] up until the place where when God took
[2:01:32] Elijah he would leave the mantle behind
[2:01:34] because now it was time for Elisha to
[2:01:36] wear this mantle and the years that he
[2:01:39] followed Elijah and the the time period
[2:01:42] there where he watched him and he
[2:01:43] learned and he grew he grew into the
[2:01:46] prophet's
[2:01:47] mantle brother brandham he went through
[2:01:50] a lot of things in life
[2:01:52] he was molded and he was shaped and he
[2:01:54] was tried and he was tested but when he
[2:01:57] gets down to the end of his ministry and
[2:01:58] the end of his life he comes to a place
[2:02:01] where when that sword is placed in his
[2:02:02] hand it's a perfect
[2:02:04] fit and that sword is the word that
[2:02:07] sword is the word of the Lord and the
[2:02:08] word of the Lord was given to the hand
[2:02:11] of a prophet and he says immediately
[2:02:14] after that them Angels appeared and said
[2:02:15] go back for the preaching of the Seven
[2:02:17] Seals what was placed in his hand it was
[2:02:19] the revelation of the Seven Seals
[2:02:22] God was going to place in that person's
[2:02:26] hands the great mystery of the seven
[2:02:29] Thunders that was sealed up
[2:02:32] amen and God had to work on him for how
[2:02:35] long to get him to this position where
[2:02:37] he could put him in the position of the
[2:02:40] seventh angel for Revelations
[2:02:44] 10:7 that was also the Fulfillment of
[2:02:46] the position of Malachi
[2:02:48] 4 because Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7
[2:02:51] are going to going to do two things
[2:02:53] they're going to reveal the mystery
[2:02:54] contained in the Seven Seals which
[2:02:55] literally turned the hearts of the
[2:02:57] children back to the
[2:02:59] fathers what was it going to take it was
[2:03:01] going to take that revelation of the
[2:03:02] seven Thunders when did it come not in
[2:03:04] the beginning of his ministry but after
[2:03:06] he'd been beat down he had been rejected
[2:03:08] they had walked away from him he had
[2:03:09] been all kinds of things that happened
[2:03:11] to him he had been betrayed he had been
[2:03:13] lied against he had had all kinds of he
[2:03:15] even had a government case against him
[2:03:18] right a tax
[2:03:20] case but now when he comes to this when
[2:03:23] God up in Sabino Canyon takes him up on
[2:03:25] a high
[2:03:27] place he drops a sword in his hand that
[2:03:30] was now a perfect fit he could trust
[2:03:33] this
[2:03:34] Prophet look at what he trusted him with
[2:03:38] friends he would go into a little room
[2:03:40] every
[2:03:41] day and every day an angel would appear
[2:03:45] and give him a vision a revelation of
[2:03:47] one of the seals and then he would write
[2:03:49] it down quickly and go chasing Through
[2:03:51] the Bible and all together and he would
[2:03:53] come out and he would say what was
[2:03:56] revealed to him in the little room now
[2:03:58] listen look what God entrusted him with
[2:04:01] God put in his hands the very word that
[2:04:04] was the Vindication of the end time and
[2:04:07] the Seven seal and the coming of the
[2:04:08] Lord and all of that the very the very
[2:04:11] Revelation that indicated all of this
[2:04:13] was true was placed in his hands and he
[2:04:16] trusted him that whatever he saw and
[2:04:19] heard in that room he would come out and
[2:04:21] say it just that way amen not add
[2:04:24] himself in not promote himself not try
[2:04:27] to become that he had he had to trust a
[2:04:29] man to take what was not written in the
[2:04:32] Bible amen the revelation of the seven
[2:04:34] Thunders which was sealed up to the end
[2:04:36] time and he had to trust a human being
[2:04:38] that he wouldn't inject himself and
[2:04:40] meddle with it and change it he had to
[2:04:42] come out and he had to put the word in
[2:04:44] his hand but he had molded that man's
[2:04:46] character with the word for decades to
[2:04:49] get him to this place
[2:04:51] Amen to where he would love the father's
[2:04:54] business and stay with the father's
[2:04:59] instructions God confirmed that he was
[2:05:01] the seventh angel by giving him the
[2:05:04] mystery of
[2:05:08] God my
[2:05:10] goodness brought him to an
[2:05:13] adoption positionally placed him as the
[2:05:16] seventh angel in Malachi
[2:05:19] 4 placed him in Revelation 10 placed him
[2:05:22] in Malachi
[2:05:23] 4 and he gave him such a responsibility
[2:05:27] but with responsibility came
[2:05:33] Authority
[2:05:34] so that was a demonstration to us
[2:05:37] because we know God is going to bring
[2:05:39] the church to
[2:05:41] adoption that's all of us friends all of
[2:05:45] us who remain alive all the way to the
[2:05:46] end they're we're coming to adoption the
[2:05:50] adoption of the church
[2:05:54] brother benam says this in the uh Church
[2:05:57] age book in the the laty in church age
[2:06:00] so when the Methodist failed God raised
[2:06:02] up others and so it has gone on through
[2:06:03] the years until in the last day there is
[2:06:06] there is again another people in the
[2:06:07] land who under their Messenger will be
[2:06:09] the final voice to the final age yes
[2:06:13] sure the church is no longer the
[2:06:14] mouthpiece of God it is his own
[2:06:15] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[2:06:18] will confound her through the prophet
[2:06:19] and the bride for the voice of God will
[2:06:21] be in
[2:06:22] her amen amen
[2:06:26] amen do you remember when Jesus was
[2:06:29] taken up on Mount Transfiguration and he
[2:06:30] was gloriously changed and he said this
[2:06:33] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[2:06:34] pleased hear ye
[2:06:38] him brother brandham showed us back then
[2:06:40] that that's coming to the
[2:06:42] [Applause]
[2:06:44] church she will
[2:06:46] be the final voice to the final age
[2:06:51] how under the prophet messenger shall be
[2:06:53] in subjection to the
[2:06:56] word he will confound her the the false
[2:06:59] Church through the prophet and the bride
[2:07:00] for the voice of God will be in
[2:07:05] her yes it is for it says in the last
[2:07:07] chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[2:07:09] spirit and the bride say
[2:07:13] come God has got to get a
[2:07:17] bride he's got to bring her to
[2:07:20] adoption question is whose
[2:07:22] responsibility is it it's
[2:07:24] his why because he predestinated it it
[2:07:28] was his plan from the beginning he's
[2:07:30] going to do it and all that he's doing
[2:07:32] now is working for that same purpose
[2:07:34] friends all that's happening in our
[2:07:36] lives all that he's revealing and all
[2:07:38] that he's working in and out of us
[2:07:40] through the circumstances of life is all
[2:07:42] for one goal to bring us to that
[2:07:48] adoption in order to have a bride that's
[2:07:52] that has the voice of God in her she has
[2:07:55] to be under a prophet Messengers meaning
[2:07:56] she's a bride who's subject to
[2:07:59] Authority what does she have to be she
[2:08:03] has to finally come to the place and I'm
[2:08:04] talking the global bride at the end time
[2:08:07] she has to finally come to the place
[2:08:09] where she loves the father's business
[2:08:11] amen more than anything else her
[2:08:14] greatest love is the father's
[2:08:16] business and she keeps his instructions
[2:08:22] if there's any goal for us if we leave
[2:08:25] with any goal let that be our goal that
[2:08:27] I love the father's business and I keep
[2:08:29] his
[2:08:30] instructions in Hebrews 11:39 he says
[2:08:33] this is at the end of the chapter of
[2:08:35] Faith Of The Heroes of Faith Hebrews 11
[2:08:38] at the very end the last two verses he
[2:08:39] said and these all having obtained a
[2:08:41] good report through faith receive not
[2:08:43] the promise God having provided some
[2:08:45] better thing for us that they without us
[2:08:48] should not be made perfect they can't
[2:08:51] complete they can't be complete until we
[2:08:53] become
[2:08:55] complete brother Brenham says in the
[2:08:57] Statue of a perfect man he says you get
[2:08:59] it those people who died in here are
[2:09:01] depending and waiting on
[2:09:03] us so this church has got to come to
[2:09:06] perfection in order to bring the
[2:09:09] resurrection that's right why do we got
[2:09:12] to come to Perfection to bring the
[2:09:13] resurrection because he can't bring the
[2:09:15] resurrection till he's brought the
[2:09:17] Capstone bride to adoption and then he
[2:09:19] can adopt the whole family
[2:09:21] amen this church has got to come to
[2:09:24] perfection in order to bring the
[2:09:25] resurrection and they're under Souls
[2:09:27] under the altar waiting for this church
[2:09:29] to come to its Perfection that when
[2:09:31] Christ does
[2:09:33] come now he comes down here to Christ is
[2:09:37] the mystery of God revealed and he makes
[2:09:39] this statement and I'm going to I'm
[2:09:40] going to give you a declaration right
[2:09:42] now I don't completely understand the
[2:09:44] statement I'm just going to read it
[2:09:46] Christ is the mystery of guard reveal he
[2:09:48] says Satan said uh said oh no but she
[2:09:52] turned around and listened to him he's
[2:09:54] speaking of Eve in the Garden of Eden
[2:09:56] but the Eve in the last day is not going
[2:09:58] to do it because she's predestinated not
[2:10:00] to do
[2:10:01] it she's been predestinated unto
[2:10:04] adoption yes sir God's going to do it he
[2:10:08] knows he'll have it he said his church
[2:10:11] would be there without spot or wrinkle
[2:10:14] she's going to stand there in the
[2:10:15] Splendor of him his word made manifest
[2:10:18] she'll be a token to the worldj how do
[2:10:21] we know that's absolutely nothing but
[2:10:23] the truth because he said that's the way
[2:10:25] it would be because he predestinated to
[2:10:27] be that way and he's going to work every
[2:10:29] circumstance around if he's got to
[2:10:31] squeeze us he'll squeeze us if he's got
[2:10:32] to train us he'll train us but he has
[2:10:35] promised that he will have he will
[2:10:36] present to himself a bride without spot
[2:10:38] or wrinkle or any blemish he will
[2:10:41] absolutely present to himself a Perfect
[2:10:43] Bride because he said he would in the
[2:10:45] book of Ephesians because the prophet of
[2:10:47] God came and confirmed it he is going to
[2:10:49] because he predestinated there's going
[2:10:51] to be an eve in the end time that will
[2:10:53] not fall just like he promised that
[2:10:56] there'd be a son who would not fail the
[2:10:58] way Adam failed and bought back the
[2:11:00] rights of redemption there's going to be
[2:11:01] a daughter amen there's going to be a
[2:11:03] bride of Christ who will not fall
[2:11:06] because she's been predestinated unto
[2:11:08] the time of
[2:11:11] adoption so I say
[2:11:14] God have your perfect work in
[2:11:17] me here's the statement that I don't
[2:11:20] fully understand now
[2:11:21] same
[2:11:22] message he said he's talking about James
[2:11:25] and jambre they withstood Moses they
[2:11:27] could do Miracles he could do Miracles
[2:11:28] they had a Ministry they could have a
[2:11:29] group but he says but their Folly will
[2:11:32] be made
[2:11:33] manifest when Jesus takes his bride and
[2:11:36] sets her up here and said this is her
[2:11:40] and the way he goes with her that's
[2:11:42] right and their Folly will be made man
[2:11:44] made known that looks like an adoption
[2:11:46] to me but I don't know how that will
[2:11:49] transpire I'm just confess you I don't
[2:11:51] know what that looks like to set her up
[2:11:53] here and say this was her and then away
[2:11:55] he goes with her it's a two-step process
[2:11:58] I don't know how it will work I don't
[2:12:00] know what it will look like but God's
[2:12:02] going to have that
[2:12:04] bride that he somehow will lift up hold
[2:12:07] up and say this is her amen he's going
[2:12:11] to I want to read one last scripture as
[2:12:13] we close let's read together to Romans
[2:12:16] chapter 8 musicians if you'll please
[2:12:18] come
[2:12:21] brother Ben if you can make your way up
[2:12:23] as
[2:12:25] well Romans chapter
[2:12:35] 8 verse
[2:12:38] 14 Romans chapter 8 verse1
[2:12:41] 14 for as many as are led by the spirit
[2:12:44] of God they are the sons of God for you
[2:12:47] have not received the spirit of bondage
[2:12:49] again to fear but you have received the
[2:12:50] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[2:12:54] Father the spirit itself beareth witness
[2:12:56] with our spirit that we are the children
[2:12:58] of God and if children then heirs Heirs
[2:13:02] of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be
[2:13:04] that we suffer with him that we may be
[2:13:07] also glorified together for I reckon
[2:13:10] that the sufferings of this present time
[2:13:11] are not worthy to be compared with the
[2:13:13] glory which shall be revealed in us you
[2:13:16] know it said it didn't say to us the
[2:13:19] glory that should be revealed in US us
[2:13:22] for the earnest expectation of the
[2:13:24] creature that's all creation waiteth for
[2:13:27] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[2:13:30] it's not just us who are craving it all
[2:13:33] of creation is waiting for the
[2:13:36] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[2:13:39] creature this creation was made subject
[2:13:41] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[2:13:43] him who has subjected to same in Hope
[2:13:46] because the creature itself also shall
[2:13:47] be delivered from the bondage of
[2:13:49] corruption and to the Glorious Liberty
[2:13:51] of the children of godone for we know
[2:13:53] that the whole creation granth and
[2:13:55] travaileth in pain together until now
[2:13:58] and not only they but ourselves also
[2:14:00] which have the first fruits of the
[2:14:01] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[2:14:03] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[2:14:05] wit the Redemption of our body for we
[2:14:08] are saved by hope but hope that is seen
[2:14:10] is not hope for what a man seeth why do
[2:14:13] he yet hope but if we hope for that we
[2:14:15] see not then do we with patience wait
[2:14:18] for
[2:14:19] it praise God all of creation is waiting
[2:14:24] for this
[2:14:26] adoption for the manifestation of the
[2:14:28] sons of God for the change of their
[2:14:29] bodies and then it will set forth a
[2:14:31] cycle that'll bring a purging and
[2:14:33] restore back Christ and his kingdom on
[2:14:36] this Earth all of creation gr not only
[2:14:38] creation groan but we within ourselves
[2:14:39] are groaning for the adoption to wit the
[2:14:42] Redemption of our bodies we're still
[2:14:45] growing in adoption I say God help us
[2:14:48] let's all Stand Together
[2:14:53] amen I say God rub that iav in my eyes
[2:14:59] so I'm not confused by life
[2:15:02] circumstances but I understand it's all
[2:15:04] working together for your great
[2:15:06] purpose friends let's let's strive to go
[2:15:10] into the holy of
[2:15:11] holies where rain wind
[2:15:14] circumstances don't
[2:15:16] disrupt but where in the secret of his
[2:15:20] Pavilion
[2:15:21] he hides us amen upon a rock and though
[2:15:24] troubles all around there's a place of
[2:15:27] communion with Christ that brings such a
[2:15:29] satisfaction that I know everything's
[2:15:31] going to be
[2:15:33] okay and can we come to maturity and let
[2:15:36] the circumstances in our life not push
[2:15:38] us down but let the circumstances in our
[2:15:40] life push us up to bring us into this
[2:15:43] position of adoption he wants us to be
[2:15:45] in say God bless you all I'm so thankful
[2:15:48] for the word of God amen amen all lives
[2:15:51] would be such a confusion how can it be
[2:15:53] I've served God this long and it seems
[2:15:55] to be getting
[2:15:56] harder how can it be we've come so close
[2:15:58] to the end but it seems to be more
[2:16:01] difficult than because you're coming
[2:16:02] close to the end he's got to train us
[2:16:03] for
[2:16:05] patience everything is working together
[2:16:07] for that one purpose say praise be to
[2:16:11] God let's bow our heads and pray Lord
[2:16:14] Jesus I'm so thankful for your
[2:16:16] word God I'm so thankful you sent a
[2:16:18] prophet in our day who could peel back
[2:16:21] to mystery Lord we we'd be so confused
[2:16:24] if it wasn't for these truths Lord we'd
[2:16:26] be so distraught and discouraged by by
[2:16:29] life's trials we would miss the very
[2:16:31] blessing that's veiled in every trial we
[2:16:34] would miss Lord the very purpose that's
[2:16:36] behind every negative seemingly negative
[2:16:38] thing in our life Lord It's Your word
[2:16:40] that shows us it's positive not negative
[2:16:44] you're working un expected end you're
[2:16:46] bringing us Lord to to your desired
[2:16:48] position you have predestinated us to
[2:16:50] adoption according to the good pleasure
[2:16:52] of your will now Lord as you work your
[2:16:55] work in us and bring us to the
[2:16:58] Perfection that you've predestinated for
[2:17:00] this hour God help us to be focused on
