[10:13] brother man while we're standing let's
[10:16] turn to Proverbs chapter
[10:22] 3 and we'll go and start in verse 13
[10:27] Proverbs 3: 13
[10:31] 13 happy is the man that findeth wisdom
[10:34] and the man that GTH understanding for
[10:37] the merchandise of it is better than the
[10:39] merchandise of silver and the gain
[10:40] thereof than fine gold she is more
[10:43] precious than rubies and all the things
[10:45] that can't desire are not to be compared
[10:48] under her Length of days are in her
[10:51] right hand and in her left hand riches
[10:53] and honor her ways are ways of
[10:55] pleasantness and all her paths are peace
[10:58] she is a tree of life to them that lay
[11:00] hold upon her and happy is everyone that
[11:02] retaineth her the Lord by wisdom hath
[11:05] founded the Earth by understanding ha he
[11:07] established the heavens by his knowledge
[11:09] The Depths were broken up and the clouds
[11:12] dropped down the Dew amen God bless you
[11:15] as you have your seats keep your Bibles
[11:17] handy we're going to read several more
[11:19] scriptures here in the Book of
[11:21] Proverbs but this morning I like to
[11:24] preach on the subject of wisdom and I
[11:26] couldn't think of a clever title other
[11:29] than than wisdom amen but how do you get
[11:31] more clever than wisdom praise the Lord
[11:34] um but it's a subject that I've been
[11:36] thinking on for quite a while I've been
[11:38] uh there's some things as we go on I'll
[11:40] share with you some things that have
[11:41] been hitting me with impact and I've
[11:42] been looking at it and and God's been
[11:44] dealing with me and uh so as I started
[11:47] looking at it and started looking at the
[11:49] things that God was dealing with me it
[11:51] began to open and open and open and open
[11:53] so I just wanted to share those things
[11:55] with you this morning I mean these are
[11:57] simple things but they're simple and
[11:58] profound at the the same time there are
[12:00] things that are common but they're deep
[12:02] and they're they're necessary although
[12:05] we we know about some of these things
[12:06] but we find here in the book of uh uh
[12:09] Proverbs it says happy is the man that
[12:11] findeth wisdom and the man that GTH
[12:14] understanding and then it becomes it
[12:16] begins to explain to us that it's more
[12:18] valuable than rubies the merchandise of
[12:19] it is better than silver and gold all
[12:22] that you can desire cannot even be
[12:24] cannot even hold a candle to this wisdom
[12:26] and understanding so it's the thing that
[12:29] we should desire more than silver more
[12:31] than gold more than rubies more than
[12:33] anything else that we can desire amen
[12:36] should be wisdom let's go to Proverbs
[12:38] chapter 4 and read more about
[12:44] wisdom Proverbs 4:
[12:49] 5 it says get wisdom get understanding
[12:53] forget it not neither decline from the
[12:55] words of my mouth forsake her not and
[12:57] she shall preserve thee love her and she
[13:00] shall keep thee wisdom is the principal
[13:02] thing therefore get wisdom and with all
[13:05] thy getting get understanding exalt her
[13:08] and she shall promote thee she shall
[13:10] bring thee to honor when thou Dost
[13:13] Embrace her she shall give to thee thine
[13:16] head an ornament of Grace a Crown of
[13:18] Glory shall she deliver to thee hear oh
[13:21] my son and receive my sayings excuse me
[13:23] and the years of thy life shall be many
[13:26] I have taught thee in the way of wisdom
[13:28] I have led thee in right path when thou
[13:30] goest thy steps shall not be straighten
[13:32] and when thou
[13:45] runstrom wisdom is is and and when we
[13:48] look here especially at verse
[13:51] 5 to 7 get
[13:55] wisdom get that's an instruction get
[13:58] wisdom
[14:00] uh he says verse 7 wisdom is the
[14:03] principal thing therefore get wisdom and
[14:05] with all thy getting get understanding
[14:08] this is something I've been thinking
[14:09] about it says get wisdom and it's like
[14:12] you can't just go to the store and just
[14:14] get wisdom like how do I get wisdom how
[14:17] do I wisdom is the principal thing so in
[14:20] all things get wisdom and it's the most
[14:22] valuable more than anything you can
[14:23] desire so get
[14:25] it well okay where do I go you know
[14:28] where do I go get it and on what shelf
[14:30] do I get it from and what do I pay for
[14:32] it amen this is these are things that
[14:34] I've been thinking about and so we're
[14:35] going to look at that for a little bit
[14:37] but when it says get it it it shows that
[14:40] there's some aspect of attaining
[14:42] involved there's some aspect of the the
[14:45] so it it in this instructions so far
[14:47] it's telling you that it should be
[14:49] desired more than Ruby so that you
[14:51] should have a longing and a desire and a
[14:53] want above every other want for this
[14:55] wisdom and that you should get it that
[14:57] means that there's something about
[15:00] getting it that you don't just sit
[15:01] around and wait for it to hit you in the
[15:03] head that you get
[15:06] it the question is how that's a good
[15:10] question amen let's go to Proverbs
[15:12] chapter
[15:16] 8 now this is going to be a long reading
[15:18] but just stick with me it's all about
[15:21] wisdom Proverbs chapter 8
[15:24] verse1 does not wisdom cry and
[15:27] understanding put forth her voice she
[15:29] standeth in the top of the high places
[15:30] by the way in the places of the path she
[15:34] crith at the gates at the entry of the
[15:36] city at the coming in at the doors unto
[15:39] you oh men I call and my voice is to the
[15:41] sons of man oh you simple understand
[15:43] wisdom and ye fools be of an
[15:46] understanding
[15:47] heart here for I will speak of excellent
[15:50] things and the opening of my lips shall
[15:51] be right things for my mouth shall speak
[15:54] truth and wickedness is an Abomination
[15:56] to my lips all the words in my mouth are
[15:59] in righteousness there is nothing
[16:01] forward or perverse in them so now we're
[16:03] seeing characteristics of wisdom it's
[16:05] truth with no lie no evil no wickedness
[16:09] we're seeing these characteristics verse
[16:11] n they are all plain to him that
[16:13] understandeth and right to them that
[16:14] find knowledge receive my instruction
[16:17] and not silver and knowledge rather than
[16:19] Choice gold for wisdom is better than
[16:21] rubies and all things that may be
[16:24] desired are not to be compared to it so
[16:27] what is the What is the greatest thing
[16:29] that we can
[16:31] have uh wisdom greater than rubies
[16:35] greater than gold greater than silver is
[16:38] wisdom amen verse 12 I wisdom dwell with
[16:42] prudence and and find out knowledge of
[16:44] witty inventions the fear of the Lord is
[16:46] to hate evil pride and arrogancy in the
[16:49] evil way and the forward mouth do I hate
[16:52] counsel his mind and sound wisdom I am
[16:55] understanding I have strength by me
[16:59] Kings reign and Prince's decree Justice
[17:01] by me princes Rule and Nobles even all
[17:03] the judges of the earth I love them that
[17:06] love me and those that seek me early
[17:09] shall find me remember you have to get
[17:11] wisdom and get understanding and here
[17:14] we're admonished to seek and those that
[17:17] seek me early shall find me I love this
[17:20] seek me early kind of the the the the
[17:23] language in the Bible is sometimes we
[17:25] have to understand that the language in
[17:27] many ways is very symbolic and very
[17:29] poetic and so seek me early doesn't mean
[17:32] that you have to get up early although
[17:34] we know that's a good principle is seek
[17:36] the Lord early but it seek me early it
[17:39] seek me
[17:40] first this is the first thing to seek
[17:43] this is seek me early before you seek
[17:45] anything else seek me early they shall
[17:48] find me riches and honor are with me
[17:50] yeay durable riches and righteousness my
[17:53] fruit is better than gold yay than fine
[17:56] gold and my Revenue than Choice silver I
[17:59] lead in the way of righteousness in the
[18:00] midst of the paths of judgment that I
[18:03] may cause those that love me to inherit
[18:05] substance and I will fill their
[18:07] Treasures the Lord possessed me in the
[18:10] beginning of his way before his works of
[18:12] old so now we're start this this wisdom
[18:15] that we're talking about is amazing
[18:17] because it was with God in the very
[18:19] beginning before any of his Works were
[18:22] established or come into
[18:24] manifestation so the Lord possessed me
[18:26] in the beginning of his way before his
[18:28] works of old
[18:29] I was set up from Everlasting from the
[18:31] beginning orever the Earth was when
[18:33] there were no depths I was brought forth
[18:35] when there were no fountain abounding
[18:37] with water before the mountains were
[18:39] settled before the hills was I brought
[18:41] forth while as yet he had not made the
[18:43] Earth nor the fields nor the highest
[18:45] part of the Dust of the world when he
[18:48] prepared the heavens I was there when he
[18:50] set a compass upon the face of the deep
[18:52] when he established the clouds above
[18:54] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[18:55] the deep when he gave to the Sea his
[18:58] decree that the wat should not pass his
[19:00] commandment when he appointed the
[19:01] foundations of the earth then I was by
[19:04] him as one brought up with him and I was
[19:06] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[19:09] before him this is where uh this is the
[19:11] place in the scripture I see where
[19:12] brother Benham gets that uh uh that
[19:15] place in the message where he starts
[19:16] talking about amen the pillar of fire
[19:19] the Son of God is a pillar of fire he
[19:21] said playing at the feet of the father
[19:23] brother man and and that's referring to
[19:25] this scripture
[19:27] here let's read this again uh verse
[19:31] 30 then I was by him as one brought up
[19:34] with him and I was daily his Delight
[19:37] rejoicing always before him rejoicing in
[19:39] the habitable part of his Earth and my
[19:41] Delights were with the sons of men now
[19:43] therefore hearken unto me oh ye children
[19:46] for blessed are they that keep my ways
[19:49] hear instruction and be wise and refuse
[19:51] a not blessed is the man that heareth me
[19:53] watching daily at my Gates waiting at
[19:56] the post of my doors for though for who
[19:59] so findeth me findeth life and shall
[20:01] obtain favor of the Lord and He that
[20:03] sinth against me wrongth his own soul
[20:06] all they that hate me love
[20:09] death well I would say wisdom is
[20:12] important when we go to read what the
[20:14] Bible has told us about wisdom amen it
[20:17] and we find that wisdom here is
[20:19] personified amen it's given attributes
[20:22] is of a of a person and we know that
[20:24] wisdom amen is wisdom is part of God
[20:28] it's part of God character it's part of
[20:29] God's attributes it is expression of God
[20:32] and wisdom was he said when when he was
[20:34] forming everything I was there with him
[20:36] I was brought forth why because God in
[20:38] his wisdom made everything but he made
[20:41] everything according to his word of
[20:43] course his word and his wisdom go hand
[20:44] in hand they're one and the same and so
[20:48] this is an attribute of his word from
[20:50] the beginning but it's his wisdom that
[20:52] is on
[20:53] display and so I was looking at a
[20:57] definition of wisdom
[20:59] and I I looked in several places and I
[21:01] found this definition which I really
[21:02] likeed uh on some online Bible
[21:06] dictionary and and the reason I liked it
[21:08] is it tied into with what I've been
[21:10] looking at in wisdom all the definitions
[21:12] are good and true but I just like the
[21:13] way this is worded and it says wisdom
[21:16] and it's taking the word in the Old
[21:17] Testament for wisdom that we've been
[21:19] reading said is the ability to judge
[21:22] correctly and to follow the best course
[21:25] of action based on knowledge and
[21:27] understanding I'm going to read that
[21:30] again wisdom is the ability to judge
[21:33] correctly and to follow the best course
[21:36] of action based on knowledge and
[21:39] understanding that's why God created
[21:41] everything by his wisdom yeah because he
[21:44] had perfect knowledge and understanding
[21:45] and he did everything correctly
[21:46] according to knowledge and understanding
[21:49] that's right and then they went on to to
[21:51] give some examples says wisdom is the
[21:53] ability to see something from God's
[21:56] Viewpoint wisdom is God's character in
[21:59] many practical Affairs of life so wisdom
[22:03] we know is an attribute of God it's an
[22:05] attribute of the word uh in many ways
[22:07] and here it's used synonymously with the
[22:09] word so so wisdom is actually the
[22:13] character of God and relation to many
[22:17] things uh that we come across in life so
[22:19] the wisdom would be the wisdom would be
[22:21] the character of God in this
[22:24] situation so we could say it that way in
[22:26] this situation what what do we what what
[22:28] do we need sometimes we come into a
[22:30] place where we need to make a decision
[22:32] and we want to know the right way to do
[22:34] things and what God would have us do
[22:36] what we need is
[22:38] wisdom because we can make actions and
[22:40] we can we can get advices and we can we
[22:43] could read scriptures and we could read
[22:45] quotes we can come up with multiple ways
[22:47] Amen to to to uh maybe uh move forward
[22:50] in a certain direction but what we need
[22:52] is wisdom amen what we need is God's
[22:55] character in this situation and if we
[22:57] have God's Chara character in this
[22:59] situation and make our decision based
[23:01] off God's character in this situation
[23:03] then we will be operating in
[23:06] wisdom amen so you can see how that this
[23:10] kind of wisdom is so different than the
[23:11] wisdom of the
[23:13] world let's look at this in 1
[23:15] Corinthians chapter
[23:16] 1 I've got quite a few scriptures to
[23:19] read uh early on here so just keep your
[23:22] Bibles handy we're going to flip
[23:24] and this may wind up like a Bible study
[23:27] but praise God I like Bible
[23:31] studies 1 Corinthians chapter
[23:37] 1 and verse
[23:39] 17 1 Corinthians 1:1 17 for Christ sent
[23:43] me not to baptized but to preach the
[23:45] gospel not with wisdom of words lest the
[23:48] Cross of Christ should be made of none
[23:49] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[23:52] to them that perish foolishness
[23:53] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[23:56] it is the power of God for it is written
[23:58] I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[24:00] and will bring to nothing the
[24:02] understanding of The
[24:03] Prudent where is the wise where is the
[24:06] Scribe where is the disputer of this
[24:08] world hath not God made foolish the
[24:10] wisdom of this world for after that in
[24:12] the wisdom of God the World by wisdom
[24:14] knew not God it pleased God by the
[24:17] foolishness of preaching to save them
[24:18] that believe for the Jews require a sign
[24:21] in the Greek seek after wisdom but we
[24:24] preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[24:26] stumbling block and unto the Greeks full
[24:28] foolishness but unto them which are
[24:30] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[24:33] power of God and the wisdom of God
[24:36] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[24:38] than men and the weakness of God is
[24:41] stronger than men for you see your
[24:43] calling Brethren how that not many wise
[24:47] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[24:49] many noble are called but God has chosen
[24:52] the foolish things of the world to
[24:54] confound the wise and God has chosen the
[24:56] weak things of the world to confound the
[24:58] things which are Mighty in base things
[25:00] of the world and things which are
[25:02] despised hath God chosen yay in things
[25:04] which are not to bring to not things
[25:06] that are that no flesh should glory in
[25:09] his presence but of him are you in
[25:11] Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us
[25:14] wisdom and righteousness and
[25:16] sanctification and Redemption that
[25:18] according as it is written he that
[25:20] glorieth let him glory in the Lord so we
[25:23] find that the wisdom of God is
[25:25] foolishness to man and the wisdom of man
[25:28] man is foolishness to God so this wisdom
[25:31] we're talking about is so contrary to
[25:34] the wisdom of the world it's so opposite
[25:37] and what he's speaking of here he starts
[25:38] talking about Calvary and it's a
[25:40] stumbling block to the Jews and its
[25:42] foolishness to the Greeks because no no
[25:45] man would no man amen would administer
[25:48] his plan this way no human being amen
[25:51] would become a king this way and
[25:53] purchase back his Redemption and destroy
[25:55] the Enemy by coming in humility and
[25:58] being subject to the elements of the
[25:59] world Amen and and being mocked and
[26:02] scored and persecuted and hung on a
[26:04] cross and killed by the very people he
[26:06] created amen that's foolishness to man
[26:10] but that's God's
[26:11] wisdom that's God's character that's
[26:14] God's wisdom that's the nature of the
[26:16] word and so the nature of God the wisdom
[26:18] of God is so different than the wisdom
[26:21] of man amen they runs absolutely
[26:23] contrary to one another that's why the
[26:25] Greeks with all their wisdom and and
[26:27] their hierarchy of Greek gods and and
[26:29] the gods who are punishing man and gods
[26:32] who are selfish and God Gods who want to
[26:34] uh rule over men for their own pleasure
[26:36] for their own desire and for their own
[26:38] they couldn't understand the true wisdom
[26:41] of God Amen who would give himself for a
[26:44] subjects not not sacrific his subjects
[26:46] for
[26:47] himself so the to the to the Greeks it
[26:50] was foolishness to the Jews it was a
[26:51] stumbling block how could their their
[26:53] God Amen how could he come on and take
[26:55] on flesh and be spit on and on I mean to
[26:57] them it was an absolute stumbling block
[26:59] but to God it was the wisdom of God
[27:01] Christ the wisdom of God the power and
[27:04] wisdom of God so this kind of wisdom is
[27:07] so different than the world that the
[27:09] world looks at it many times as
[27:12] foolishness but God looks at the wisest
[27:15] of
[27:15] men as
[27:18] foolishness that's why God has chosen
[27:20] that's why Paul says here he hasn't
[27:22] chose many mighty many noble many of the
[27:26] elite God has chose the base things of
[27:28] this world to confound the things that
[27:29] are
[27:30] wise why because his wisdom is contrary
[27:33] to man's Wisdom amen God's wisdom goes
[27:36] low man's Wisdom puffs up makes him high
[27:40] so God will take the
[27:42] low those of us who don't
[27:46] know don't have great understanding
[27:49] aren't tremendously uh uh established or
[27:52] well respected or well known or or we
[27:54] don't have good understanding we don't
[27:56] have great education we don't have all
[27:57] these things and God will take no bodies
[28:00] from nowhere like he took Mary and he
[28:02] would confound the wisdom of the wise
[28:04] amen and he would show his wisdom in
[28:08] humility so we we cannot
[28:13] be wise the way the world is
[28:17] wise but we have to be wise the way God
[28:20] is
[28:21] wise and God's wisdom many times looks
[28:25] like foolishness to man so when we say I
[28:28] desire to have the wisdom of God that
[28:30] you realize if that wisdom of God comes
[28:33] into your life and begins to affect your
[28:35] life that you're going to look like a
[28:37] fool to most of the
[28:40] world so when we when when we want this
[28:43] wisdom when we get this wisdom remember
[28:45] get wisdom it's the principal thing get
[28:48] wisdom and with all you're getting get
[28:50] understanding amen get these things but
[28:52] you have to realize that the things that
[28:54] you're obtaining for the things that
[28:55] you're getting amen the things that
[28:57] you're seeking early the wisdom that
[28:59] you're Desiring more than rubies and
[29:01] more than Cho choice that thing that you
[29:03] desire is not going to promote you one
[29:06] drop in this world we're not seeking
[29:09] wisdom so that we know more than the
[29:11] people around us amen that's not that
[29:13] kind of wisdom you may know more than
[29:15] the people around you but that knowledge
[29:17] that God gives you that wisdom amen will
[29:19] cause you to be the lowest of everybody
[29:21] around
[29:22] you because that's what that's the way
[29:25] Jesus Christ
[29:26] came so we we have to understand what
[29:29] we're striving for what we're getting
[29:31] what we're
[29:33] getting is not going to help our
[29:38] Humanity look good in the eyes of other
[29:41] Humanity so if you want this kind of
[29:43] wisdom if you seek it early and you
[29:45] desire you you just have to understand
[29:48] you're not going to you're not going to
[29:49] walk down the road and get the title of
[29:52] wisdom that attached you this guy is
[29:54] wise no you may get the title of
[29:57] fool amen yes right amen so there this
[30:02] is why the seek this kind of wisdom amen
[30:05] this kind of wisdom cannot bring
[30:08] arrogance and a puffed up attitude amen
[30:10] because it has nothing to do with your
[30:12] flesh it will actually abase your flesh
[30:14] and cause you to look like a fool in the
[30:16] eyes of the
[30:19] world
[30:21] Amen but it's it's it's the best
[30:24] kind amen
[30:30] you know Jesus Christ had this kind of
[30:33] wisdom he was so wise to the ways of the
[30:38] world and not not in the ways of the
[30:40] world contrary to the ways of the world
[30:42] that in the eyes of the world he was
[30:45] brother bam said he he walked in a world
[30:47] that was all his own yes
[30:50] amen he was despised and
[30:54] rejected he didn't have enough sign
[30:58] scientific
[30:59] knowledge to know that certain things
[31:04] were off limits to
[31:07] him because that's what the wisdom of
[31:09] the world does right the wisdom of the
[31:12] world will tell you that you cannot walk
[31:15] on
[31:16] water
[31:18] right but before the world was fashion
[31:22] wisdom was there and brought forth from
[31:24] God and wisdom knows more about this
[31:26] creation than scientists
[31:29] amen right the wisdom of God has greater
[31:33] understanding of how this world were
[31:34] formed how the laws operate what gravity
[31:37] really is and how molecules work and
[31:40] what atoms are and what the nucleus of a
[31:42] cell looks like and what is the life
[31:43] that drives it all amen listen this
[31:46] wisdom that was there from the beginning
[31:48] that was brought forth in gone and was
[31:50] with him when he decreed everything and
[31:51] he put boundaries and he said it all
[31:53] that wisdom knows more than any
[31:55] scientist on this planet because the
[31:57] scientist doesn't believe you can walk
[31:59] on water but wisdom knows you
[32:01] can amen amen it was the wisdom of the
[32:04] world would have never told Jesus that
[32:06] he could take five loaves of bread and a
[32:09] couple fishes and break them and
[32:10] multiply to feed 5,000 but the wisdom of
[32:13] God Amen who created all things knew
[32:17] amen knew more than the scientists
[32:20] knew that's right amen so I'd rather be
[32:23] a fool in the eyes of Science and have
[32:25] this wisdom amen because this is the
[32:27] wisdom that's going to change my atom
[32:29] someday this is the wisdom that's going
[32:30] to overcome every obstacle that's placed
[32:32] before us it doesn't matter where listen
[32:35] we have to understand that this wisdom
[32:37] of God Amen was before the the physical
[32:41] creation of the earth amen so it
[32:43] supersedes it rises above it has greater
[32:46] knowledge than the physical creation of
[32:48] the world so therefore this wisdom is
[32:50] not limited or Bound by what we call
[32:54] Natural laws
[32:56] am amen
[32:58] so by this
[32:59] wisdom listen this is the kind of wisdom
[33:02] that came to brother
[33:04] banham and said you have need of
[33:06] squirrels yeah
[33:09] amen listen that was not worldly wisdom
[33:12] right that looks foolish in the eyes
[33:15] amen that looks foolish in the eyes of
[33:17] the world they look at that kind of
[33:18] wisdom and say you're you're crazy
[33:20] you're off your head you don't know what
[33:22] you're talking about that's not
[33:24] possible that's the the worldly wisdom
[33:27] was the one that was resisting and
[33:28] fighting Noah and Noah looked like a
[33:30] fool in the eyes of the world cuz Noah
[33:33] said it's going to rain there's going to
[33:34] be a huge flood and the only way of
[33:36] Salvation is to get on this boat God
[33:37] told me to build it and building it the
[33:39] way he told me this is the place of
[33:41] Salvation amen and brother bam said they
[33:43] had they had science that that exceeded
[33:46] our science amen they had devices that
[33:48] they could shoot the Moon that they had
[33:50] all kinds of worldly understanding as
[33:53] far as how the world operates and they
[33:55] knew there was no moisture up there to
[33:57] fall had never reigned before they could
[33:59] prove all of those things but that was
[34:01] no limiting factor to the wisdom of God
[34:04] the wisdom of God knew how to get rain
[34:07] to fall out of the sky yeah
[34:11] amen just because man in his Collective
[34:13] wisdom over the last 6,000 years has
[34:15] come to Scientific achievements is no
[34:17] barrier over on
[34:20] God praise be to
[34:23] God so this kind of wisdom looks like
[34:28] foolishness to the world while we're in
[34:32] 1 Corinthians let's turn to chapter
[34:45] 3 1 Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse
[34:53] 18 says let no man deceive himself if
[34:56] any man among you seeth to be wise in
[34:58] this world let him become a fool that he
[35:01] may be
[35:02] wise praise be to God you know the
[35:06] problem is we don't want to look like a
[35:07] fool we want to look wise yes yes that's
[35:12] that's our problem friend we want to
[35:15] look like we know what we're talking
[35:16] about we want to look like we have our
[35:18] act together we want to look respectable
[35:21] in the eyes of others around us but in
[35:23] order to obtain this kind of wisdom
[35:25] we're going to have to just give that up
[35:28] yeah and become a fool that we may be
[35:32] wise for the wisdom of this world is
[35:34] foolishness with God for it is written
[35:36] he taketh the wise in their own
[35:39] craftiness and again the Lord knoweth
[35:41] the thoughts of of the wise that they
[35:43] are vain praise be to God that's not the
[35:47] wisdom I
[35:49] want the Book of Proverbs makes this
[35:52] statement I'll just read it to you
[35:53] Proverbs 26:12 seest thou a man wise in
[35:56] his own conceit
[35:58] there is more hope of a fool than of
[36:01] him you know most of the time we're wise
[36:04] in our own conceit that's worldly wisdom
[36:07] and the problem with worldly wisdom is
[36:09] we've come to
[36:11] conclusions with partial
[36:14] information yes that's right right all
[36:18] of science all of science has come to
[36:21] conclusions with partial information
[36:23] that's right amen so they're wise in
[36:26] their own conceit because they don't
[36:28] realize there's a whole lot they don't
[36:30] know amen and because they assume that
[36:33] they know a whole lot they they are
[36:36] wiser in their own conceit and there's
[36:37] more hope of a fool for somebody like
[36:38] that y they don't they because they will
[36:44] only study and they will only gain
[36:47] knowledge off the physical world that
[36:50] they can measure and test and and shape
[36:52] and and and and run experiments on and
[36:55] because they leave out the supernatural
[36:57] world Amen they they're automatically
[37:00] going to come to wrong
[37:02] conclusions because they only have
[37:04] partial information right praise God I
[37:09] would rather go to the source of
[37:11] information and not worry about how much
[37:13] information I can collect just go back
[37:15] to the source amen because he knows it
[37:18] all amen and be led by the spirit of
[37:21] God
[37:23] so all of
[37:25] humanity is wise and it's own
[37:28] conceit because they think they
[37:31] know that's one of the biggest problems
[37:34] that you and I have even serving God is
[37:38] we think we
[37:39] know it's one of our biggest problems is
[37:42] we think we know and I I pray that God
[37:45] will help me to get beyond that idea of
[37:48] I think I
[37:49] know because just that statement shows
[37:52] that you don't know because you think
[37:53] you
[37:55] know which means you don't know
[38:00] oh I would rather have amen I'd rather
[38:03] be in contact with the one who knows and
[38:05] I'd rather get wisdom from wisdom who
[38:07] does know amen so remember we're still
[38:10] looking at getting
[38:11] wisdom wisdom is the principle thing and
[38:14] all thy getting get understanding it is
[38:17] life to thee all that love me love life
[38:21] and though that hate me love death so
[38:24] we're getting down to life and death
[38:26] amen with this
[38:29] wisdom let's go to Proverbs 23 if you
[38:31] could go back to Proverbs with
[38:47] me Proverbs 23:
[38:52] 23 another interesting
[38:55] scripture proverbs 2323 says but the TR
[38:59] buy the truth and sell it not also
[39:02] wisdom and instruction and
[39:06] understanding so I was told to get
[39:08] wisdom and to get understanding I was
[39:10] told to seek wisdom early I was told it
[39:13] was the principal thing now I'm told to
[39:15] buy
[39:17] buy the truth and sell it not and wisdom
[39:23] and instruction and
[39:25] understanding so the this reminds me of
[39:29] uh Revelation in the leodan church age
[39:32] buy of me gold tried in the
[39:35] fire and you know I've looked at that
[39:37] scripture for a long time too and I'm
[39:38] thinking bu you know like what can I pay
[39:41] amen because we understand buy you know
[39:44] we go to the store and I want something
[39:46] I I give some money and I get in
[39:47] exchange for the money I get what I want
[39:49] I went and I bought I buy it I buy
[39:52] whatever it is I need I buy bread I buy
[39:54] milk I buy whatever and he's saying now
[39:57] Buy the truth and bu understanding by
[39:59] wisdom by instruction bu these get it
[40:02] attain it and this word bu amen it
[40:05] really means to attain or to
[40:08] acquire and and when you go so so it's
[40:13] interesting that the Bible doesn't just
[40:15] say
[40:17] receive but it says buy and it says
[40:21] get I find that interesting do you find
[40:23] that interesting cuz I always like buy
[40:26] of me gold trying to fire okay Lord you
[40:30] know where's it at and how much does it
[40:33] cost and you know if it was that way and
[40:37] we could physically do it we couldn't
[40:39] afford it for one but if we could we
[40:42] would sell everything we had I'd take
[40:43] out loans I'd sell
[40:45] plasma as often as they would let me go
[40:48] and sell my blood I would do it to
[40:50] acquire this because it's the principal
[40:53] thing but it's the terminology of buy
[40:56] and of get that I find interesting and
[40:58] it says buy and sell
[41:01] not buy and sell not that means that we
[41:07] are instructed to acquire and in order
[41:10] the way we buy things is there's an
[41:12] exchange rate for something that I go
[41:15] and I give something in order to get
[41:18] something and then it says and sell
[41:21] not which means to sell means another
[41:25] exchange on the other end that I I I
[41:28] have something but I will take something
[41:31] in replacement of this right amen so if
[41:34] you give me something I mean it could be
[41:37] a trade it could be money it could be
[41:39] whatever but if you give me something
[41:40] then I'll give you what I have that's
[41:42] selling buying is I'll give you
[41:44] something and you give me selling is you
[41:46] give me something and I'll give you what
[41:48] I have yeah and it tells us to buy the
[41:51] truth buy wisdom buy instruction buy
[41:53] understanding and sell it not and this
[41:55] is to me what it's saying is everything
[41:58] you have is worth giving up for this and
[42:02] nothing you can get is worth getting rid
[42:05] of
[42:07] this buy it and sell it not he's not
[42:11] talking about money he's not talking
[42:12] about a store he's talking about our
[42:14] whole life friends everything that we
[42:16] have should be in exchange for this I
[42:19] should give up all my thinking all my
[42:21] understanding all my associations I
[42:23] should give up everything to have
[42:25] this and there's nothing that I will
[42:28] take in this world in exchange for truth
[42:31] and wisdom and understanding and
[42:34] instruction are you with
[42:36] me that's why Jesus said buy of me gold
[42:39] trying to fire I thought that was awful
[42:41] interesting buy of me gold because
[42:43] wouldn't I use gold to buy gold
[42:47] yeah I mean gold is money it's a
[42:49] currency right he said buy of me gold
[42:52] how am I going to what gold am I going
[42:54] to have in exchange for gold yeah but
[42:57] this isn't any gold this is gold tried
[42:59] in the fire yes this is deity amen this
[43:02] is the deities that's been purged from
[43:04] all the world all the dross has been
[43:06] knocked out of it all the world this is
[43:08] pure Godly understanding he said come
[43:11] buy it of me what do I have to do to buy
[43:13] it amen what price does it take amen we
[43:15] know the things of God are freely given
[43:17] to us amen but me in my own
[43:19] understanding in my own life I have to
[43:22] give up everything else in exchange for
[43:25] this go amen
[43:27] he tells us to buy it acquire it attain
[43:30] it get it amen this isn't a passive
[43:35] statement this isn't a passive statement
[43:37] that requires no no effort and We Know
[43:40] listen if I if I could just say it this
[43:42] way we can never work our way into
[43:44] wisdom work our way it's not a Works
[43:46] things friends it's an understanding of
[43:48] there's value here and everything else
[43:51] is less valuable than this so it's not
[43:55] an attaining in the fact that I can work
[43:57] my way up and do good deeds and finally
[43:59] now it's not that kind of getting it's
[44:01] an understanding that this is the
[44:03] principal thing this is above rubies
[44:05] this is above gold this is above silver
[44:08] this is what he told me to get and sell
[44:10] it not amen this means this is the most
[44:13] valuable thing in my life and everything
[44:16] else is surrendered for
[44:19] this and I Will Never Surrender this for
[44:22] anything
[44:24] else get it and sell
[44:29] not oh I just love
[44:32] this I love it because it's been on my
[44:34] mind for a long time I hope by the time
[44:36] we get done you love it too amen as we
[44:39] share more let's go to Matthew
[44:48] 25 The Book of Matthew chapter 25
[45:05] Matthew chap 25 verse
[45:08] 1 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:11] be likened unto the ver to 10 virgins
[45:14] which took their lamps and went forth to
[45:15] meet the
[45:16] bridegroom five of them were wise and
[45:18] five were
[45:19] foolish they that were foolish took
[45:21] their lamps and took no oil with them
[45:24] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[45:26] with their lamps
[45:27] s while the bridegroom carried they all
[45:30] slumbered and slept and at midnight
[45:32] there was a cry made behold the
[45:34] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[45:36] then all these virgins arose and trimmed
[45:39] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[45:41] the wise give us of your oil for our
[45:42] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[45:45] saying not so lest there be not enough
[45:47] for us and you but go ye rather to them
[45:50] that sell and buy for yourselves a't
[45:53] that interesting we're buying and
[45:55] selling again yeah
[45:58] and while they went to buy the
[45:59] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[46:01] went in with him in the marriage and the
[46:03] door was shut afterward came also the
[46:05] other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us
[46:08] but he answered and said verily I say
[46:09] unto you I know you not so here we have
[46:13] the parable of the 10 virgins which is
[46:15] very meaningful to us because of the
[46:17] message but we find out that five of
[46:19] these virgins were
[46:20] wise and five were
[46:23] foolish and so the separating fact
[46:25] between these these
[46:27] uh virgins is one was wise and one was
[46:30] foolish now they all had
[46:33] lamps and they all went out to meet the
[46:36] bridegroom and brother Brenham starts to
[46:38] show that these are these are churches
[46:40] these are these are types of churches
[46:42] through the denominational system and
[46:43] through the through the church ages so
[46:45] he he types this in many ways he says a
[46:47] lot of things about this but he goes to
[46:49] show that they were all virgins so that
[46:51] they were all clean living uh
[46:53] individuals they all had lamps and they
[46:56] all went on to meet the
[46:57] bridegroom but in the midnight call it
[47:00] was only the wise that had
[47:04] oil and because they had oil they could
[47:08] find their way to the
[47:09] call and then they could go into the
[47:13] supper the ones without oil couldn't and
[47:16] they were desperate they Cried unto them
[47:18] give us of thy oil and and and the wise
[47:22] virgins listen the wise virgins were
[47:25] told to buy and sell not
[47:27] yeah right amen I'm not giving up my oil
[47:32] for anything
[47:34] yeah for anything not even human
[47:37] sympathy or I'm giving up my oil for
[47:40] nothing right but what did they say go
[47:44] to them that
[47:46] sell and
[47:48] buy another question I've had for a long
[47:51] time is where do would they go who's
[47:54] selling and who's buying right yeah
[47:57] these are good questions but we have to
[47:59] understand that these Parables like I
[48:01] said the language of the Bible is poetic
[48:02] it's metaphorical you have to see the
[48:04] meaning behind things amen that there
[48:07] that means that you got to go to The
[48:09] Exchange the place of exchange where you
[48:11] can exchange all that you have and all
[48:14] that you thought and all that you were
[48:15] taught and receive this
[48:18] oil and we know that the the Holy Ghost
[48:21] comes to us without expense I should say
[48:24] without charge we don't pay a certain
[48:26] amount of money to receive this oil
[48:27] because this oil is the type of the Holy
[48:29] Ghost amen but the Bible says repent and
[48:32] be baptized everyone in the name of the
[48:34] Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of
[48:35] sins and you shall receive of the Holy
[48:37] Ghost amen what is the price that I'm
[48:40] paying to receive the oil then I'm
[48:41] repenting meaning I'm changing my whole
[48:44] mind all my understanding and my whole
[48:46] way of thinking I'm recognizing I'm
[48:48] wrong and I've been wrong and I'm always
[48:49] wrong and everything about me is wrong
[48:51] and all my understanding is wrong but
[48:53] this word that I'm hearing now is truth
[48:56] and life and wisdom and everything and
[48:58] so now what am I doing I am buying I am
[49:02] selling my understanding I am selling my
[49:05] rights I am selling my traditions I am
[49:08] selling everything I had I'm selling it
[49:11] and giving it away because it's worth
[49:13] more to have this word than everything I
[49:17] had before that's why the wise virgin
[49:20] says Hey listen you got to get it the
[49:22] way we got it go to them that sell and
[49:24] buy
[49:27] repent and be baptized and you shall
[49:29] receive the
[49:32] gift so this isn't about paying this
[49:35] isn't about works yeah amen this is
[49:38] about a revelation of what's the most
[49:40] valuable thing what is the principal
[49:43] thing what what are we selling out
[49:48] for so the the wise virgins aren't
[49:50] giving up their oil because they were
[49:52] told to buy and sell not yeah I've been
[49:55] given what I need for this journey I
[49:58] can't give you any I have to keep it
[50:01] all but you can go back to them that
[50:04] sell and buy and you'll get enough for
[50:06] your
[50:09] journey brother B makes some statements
[50:12] along this line but first uh Psalm says
[50:15] the word is a lamp un my feet and a
[50:17] light into my path all of these virgins
[50:20] had a lamp they had a light and we know
[50:22] that the word is a lamp and we know that
[50:24] these these represent churches amen they
[50:27] had a portion of the word they had some
[50:30] gospel understanding and they went out
[50:32] to meet the bridegroom they were looking
[50:33] for the coming of the Lord Brother Bram
[50:35] says amen but but some took oil with
[50:38] them because they realized amen that
[50:40] it's going to take the oil Amen to
[50:43] manifest or to burn to give power and
[50:46] life to the
[50:48] light amen amen some just took their
[50:52] lamp amen and went with no oil amen
[50:55] representative of the Holy Ghost meaning
[50:57] they that everybody everybody took a
[51:00] Bible
[51:02] amen right everybody went forth to meet
[51:04] him with the Bible with an understanding
[51:05] of the gospel and they had all kinds of
[51:07] understandings a Baptist understanding
[51:09] and a presbyterian understanding and a
[51:11] Baptist understanding there was all
[51:12] kinds of understanding amen but but
[51:15] listen friends there was many people who
[51:17] thought having the lamp was enough right
[51:21] amen and they went with traditional
[51:23] understanding they went with mean the
[51:25] doctrines and teaching of the elders and
[51:27] of the fathers and they went with the
[51:29] lamp thinking this lamp amen will take
[51:31] me all the way to my bridegroom and they
[51:33] didn't understand that this lamp has to
[51:36] have oil and the oil is the Holy Ghost
[51:39] which is a lifegiver to the
[51:41] word they had to have a power behind it
[51:44] to illuminate it and make it
[51:47] live and they thought I've got the truth
[51:50] I've got the word I've got Bible verses
[51:53] but listen friends it takes more than
[51:55] that and in this message it's the same
[51:57] thing it takes more listen we've got
[51:59] search programs and ways that you can
[52:01] type things in and find quotes you need
[52:03] more than a search program you need the
[52:07] lifegiver to the word to illuminate it
[52:09] and make it
[52:10] live it's a good lamp there's nothing
[52:13] wrong with the lamp but it needs the
[52:15] oil to bring
[52:19] life
[52:22] amen but the wise
[52:24] realized I need more than my
[52:27] understanding I need more than a quote
[52:29] list I need more than my search program
[52:31] and I need more than just being able to
[52:33] read a Bible amen I need more than the
[52:37] teachings of my fathers I need more and
[52:39] it doesn't listen it doesn't matter how
[52:41] correct the teaching of the fathers are
[52:43] you need more than just the teaching of
[52:45] the fathers you've got to have the oil
[52:48] Amen to make the light
[52:51] shine to bring manifestation to bring
[52:54] life into that lamp
[52:57] and only the oil will bring that
[53:01] life at the right time at the bridegroom
[53:05] call and will illuminate The Gospel
[53:09] Light from the word with the life and
[53:13] power behind it to make it shine so that
[53:15] this word will lead you all the way to
[53:17] your bridegroom
[53:19] amen so in the Midnight Hour when
[53:22] everything is pitched black what is it
[53:24] that's going to lead you your lamp
[53:28] but it takes the power of the Holy Ghost
[53:31] Amen to make it shine in your life amen
[53:35] to make it Shine for you it can Shine
[53:39] for your
[53:40] neighbor listen these were 10 virgins
[53:42] they were all I guess in close proximity
[53:44] to one
[53:45] another but each one only had enough oil
[53:49] for themselves
[53:51] yeah my oil won't shine your lamp amen
[53:57] that's right and you can't use my oil to
[54:00] make it to the
[54:01] bridegroom in the Midnight Hour amen
[54:04] amen you've got to have oil In Your
[54:07] Vessel
[54:08] amen so brother man would tell explain
[54:11] this to us in many ways and in many
[54:13] types of scenarios he would use to
[54:15] explain this and he would tell us that
[54:18] you know the they they didn't take oil
[54:20] the Revival died they had truth Luther
[54:22] had truth Wesley had truth the
[54:24] Pentecostal had truth amen but they
[54:26] didn't they didn't stay with the present
[54:28] tense truth the life amen and they'd had
[54:30] no oil with them in the midnight
[54:33] crime but the
[54:36] wise what made them
[54:38] wise was that they knew they needed
[54:43] oil they were all virgins they all went
[54:47] to wait for the bridegroom they all knew
[54:49] they had to have
[54:50] lamps what made them wise is that they
[54:53] knew they knew they needed something
[54:55] more
[54:56] yes and they wouldn't go without
[54:59] it I pray what would make us wise today
[55:03] is realizing that I can do nothing
[55:05] without him that I need the holy ghost
[55:07] in my life if I'm ever going to make it
[55:09] to the bridegroom and into the marriage
[55:11] supper it's got to be his life his power
[55:14] in me cuz brother R said the Holy Ghost
[55:17] is the lifegiver to the
[55:19] word and we need it
[55:22] friends in the message the conflict
[55:24] between God and Satan he said says yes
[55:27] yes sir yes they don't have these big
[55:29] things they don't claim to have anything
[55:30] they just claim to believe something
[55:33] Jesus sent the Holy Ghost which is
[55:34] himself he said a little while in the
[55:36] world seeth me no more yet ye shall see
[55:38] me for I will be in you be with you even
[55:41] in you to the end of the world now now
[55:44] watch listen uh Jesus knew it so he sent
[55:47] the Holy Ghost to confirm the word said
[55:50] did you get it to confirm to those who
[55:53] have taken their Refuge behind the word
[55:55] that that he is the word see let them
[55:59] out there they'll laugh at the system
[56:01] they'll say they're crazy but Jesus sent
[56:04] the Holy Spirit which is himself to get
[56:06] it to those that's behind the word like
[56:09] Abraham's group to confirm the word
[56:12] before them to show that he still the
[56:14] word see you have taken the right place
[56:17] all right fire is the confirmation of
[56:19] the light coming from the word the smart
[56:22] virgins the wise virgins had oil in
[56:24] their lamb and she trimmed her lamp and
[56:26] lit it now what is it God is the word
[56:29] the oil is the spirit and the fire is
[56:32] the gospel so you got that amen God is
[56:36] the word the oil is the spirit and the
[56:38] fire is the Gospel Light on the oil God
[56:41] said so that's the vessel all right the
[56:44] oil is in the vessel and the fire
[56:46] burning it shows that it's reflecting
[56:48] the light of what the word said that's
[56:51] the reflection now that wise virgin
[56:54] could do that but the other foolish
[56:56] virgin was on the outside had no oil
[56:59] they couldn't reflect nothing but just
[57:01] their church and their
[57:02] denomination now you say the word you
[57:04] said the word was was Spirit yes sir God
[57:07] said my word is spirit that's right the
[57:10] true bride must be unified by the word
[57:12] now remember if she's a part of Christ
[57:14] she has to be the word of Christ so I
[57:17] read this beginning part because I liked
[57:19] what brother bham said he said he sent
[57:22] his holy ghost to confirm the word he to
[57:25] confirm to those who had taken their
[57:27] Refuge behind the word that that he's in
[57:30] the word see and he he goes again he
[57:33] says now Jesus sent the Holy Spirit
[57:34] which is himself to get it to those
[57:36] that's behind the word like Abraham's
[57:38] group to confirm the word before them to
[57:40] show that he's still the word so I need
[57:44] the Holy Ghost I need wisdom but what
[57:46] must I do remember repent yes and be
[57:50] baptized every one of you in the name of
[57:52] the Lord Jesus Christ what is repentance
[57:54] repentance is seeing the word and taking
[57:56] Refuge behind the word amen and then he
[57:58] gives the Holy Ghost to everybody who's
[58:00] taking Refuge behind the word amen what
[58:03] have I done I've sold everything and
[58:05] bought yeah amen sold and I've bought
[58:08] and those are the ones those who take
[58:10] refuge in their Church tradition not in
[58:12] the word for their day amen they don't
[58:14] get the oil
[58:16] amen so the the the the wise virgin
[58:21] tells the foolish virgin go to them that
[58:24] sell and buy
[58:28] where did we
[58:29] go it was this message friends where did
[58:33] we go to buy amen where what other what
[58:37] what other retailer has yeah what we
[58:40] need
[58:42] amen what other store which other
[58:44] storefront would you go to to get this
[58:47] promise for this hour to get this holy
[58:49] ghost that we need to illuminate our
[58:52] light where did we go to buy we came to
[58:55] the present tense Truth for our
[58:57] day and when we repented meaning
[59:00] everything else we thought we died to
[59:03] and me we accepted this and we were
[59:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:06] Christ then what did he do he promised
[59:08] us that we would receive the gift of the
[59:09] Holy Ghost why is because we sold and we
[59:12] bought because we went to the right
[59:14] place amen right so what we can we tell
[59:18] what can we tell people amen who have no
[59:20] light and they realize I need what you
[59:22] have I can't live what you live I can't
[59:24] shine that I can't reflect that word
[59:26] amen I wish I had what you had you say
[59:28] it's available to you it's here there's
[59:31] a retail shop open the doors are not
[59:33] closed 24 hours a day 7 days a week you
[59:36] can go and buy just like I went and buy
[59:39] where is it it's this word that God has
[59:41] delivered through a prophetic Ministry
[59:43] in this day and those who take refuge
[59:45] behind the word he gives them the
[59:49] oil amen because we realize I can't just
[59:53] go amen because my mom and dad believe
[59:55] the message I can't just go because I've
[59:56] had good teaching I've got to sell
[59:59] everything out and I've got to have the
[1:00:01] oil so I can make it all the way in
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:07] am God is the word the oil is the spirit
[1:00:11] and the fire is the Gospel Light on the
[1:00:13] oil until that lamp you're carrying
[1:00:15] becomes the reflection of the word the
[1:00:18] gospel for our day living in
[1:00:23] you praise God
[1:00:26] I'm so glad as far as we know the door
[1:00:28] is still
[1:00:31] open I listen I can't give you my
[1:00:36] oil right amen because I refuse to part
[1:00:41] with
[1:00:42] it it's not because I don't love you
[1:00:44] it's because I was told to buy and not
[1:00:46] sell I I can't give it to you because I
[1:00:49] only have enough for me amen right but I
[1:00:54] can tell you the same thing the wise
[1:00:56] virgins told the foolish virgin in this
[1:00:57] Parable go to them that sell and buy
[1:01:01] amen it's still on the Shelf it's not
[1:01:04] outdated amen you can still partake amen
[1:01:08] you can still go and find the supply
[1:01:10] chain is still good co didn't shut it
[1:01:13] down they didn't quit manufacturing it
[1:01:15] God still has it in this day and it's
[1:01:17] available
[1:01:19] friends going by and the
[1:01:23] wise the wise aren't wise because they
[1:01:26] learned a lot the wise aren't wise
[1:01:28] because they know more than the foolish
[1:01:29] virgin that's not what the wisdom is the
[1:01:31] wise are wise because they realize I
[1:01:33] need something more than
[1:01:35] me I need another Power another life I
[1:01:38] need something to make this light
[1:01:41] shine amen let's turn to Matthew Chapter
[1:01:45] 11
[1:02:05] Matthew 11:
[1:02:11] 16 Jesus is speaking here and he says in
[1:02:15] verse 16 but where unto shall I liken
[1:02:17] this generation it is like unto children
[1:02:20] sitting in the markets and calling unto
[1:02:22] their fellows and saying we have piped
[1:02:24] unto you and you have not danced we have
[1:02:27] mourned unto you and you have not
[1:02:31] lamented I just want to focus on that
[1:02:33] for a minute I went through this
[1:02:34] scripture a little while back with the
[1:02:36] youth and it was really profound to me
[1:02:39] that this Jesus saying how how will I
[1:02:42] like in this generation I'm going to
[1:02:44] show you a type as I observe you this is
[1:02:46] what you're
[1:02:48] like he says it's like un children
[1:02:51] sitting in the markets and calling unto
[1:02:53] their fellows and saying we have piped
[1:02:55] unto you and you have not danced and we
[1:02:57] have mourned unto you and you have not
[1:03:00] lamented what he's saying is this is the
[1:03:02] hour of visitation this is when the word
[1:03:04] and fullness has been made manifest
[1:03:06] there in Israel and he says I'll tell
[1:03:09] you what this generation is like it's
[1:03:11] like this a bunch of children in the
[1:03:13] market amen and one a group of
[1:03:16] children's here and there's children
[1:03:17] going by and he's piping and playing a
[1:03:19] happy song and the children go by like
[1:03:21] they didn't hear
[1:03:23] anything dead to it no reaction
[1:03:26] whatsoever right then he says it's like
[1:03:29] those who says I mourned i i i lamented
[1:03:32] to I mourned to you and you did not lay
[1:03:35] it so when we didn't try the Happy song
[1:03:37] Amen then we tried a sad
[1:03:40] song and same thing no
[1:03:44] reaction how what is this generation
[1:03:46] like listen I I'll tell you it's the
[1:03:48] same thing in this generation CU we've
[1:03:50] had another visitation of the word the
[1:03:53] full word has come back in this
[1:03:55] generation and what's happened I I'll
[1:03:57] tell you what this how I'll liken this
[1:03:59] generation I'll liken it to
[1:04:01] this there was children in the market
[1:04:04] and they say we piped to you but you
[1:04:05] didn't
[1:04:07] dance we played you the happiest song of
[1:04:10] all amen that the fullness of redemption
[1:04:12] has come the time that the fullness is
[1:04:14] coming to the Gentiles and you it's like
[1:04:16] you heard nothing yes yeah amen and then
[1:04:19] we lamented to you we mourn to you that
[1:04:22] this this is going to be a terrible day
[1:04:23] for those who don't have Christ amen we
[1:04:25] sung the sad song cuz it's the great and
[1:04:27] terrible day of the Lord amen and you
[1:04:29] didn't mourn you didn't you weren't sad
[1:04:32] you weren't happy you weren't sad you
[1:04:34] were numb to the message and you walked
[1:04:36] on by as if you heard anything that's
[1:04:38] what this generation is like the same
[1:04:40] thing that Jesus
[1:04:43] found and look at what he types it to
[1:04:45] now look what he says for John came
[1:04:48] neither eating or drinking and they say
[1:04:51] he is a
[1:04:53] devil the son of man came eating and
[1:04:55] drinking
[1:04:56] and they say Behold a man
[1:04:58] gluttonous and a wine Biber a friend of
[1:05:02] publicans and
[1:05:03] sinners but wisdom is Justified of her
[1:05:08] children remember what are we learning
[1:05:10] about today wisdom he starts off saying
[1:05:15] we piped you didn't dance we mourned you
[1:05:18] didn't lay man you had no reaction John
[1:05:21] came with his ministry and you passed it
[1:05:25] off as a devil yeah the son of man came
[1:05:28] in his time in his ministry and you
[1:05:30] called him a wine bibber and a friend of
[1:05:33] publicans he says but don't worry there
[1:05:37] are
[1:05:40] children yeah yeah amen he says but
[1:05:43] wisdom is Justified of her children I
[1:05:47] looked up this word Justified because
[1:05:49] sometimes we hear the word Justified and
[1:05:50] we're like what what does exactly that
[1:05:52] mean and and one of the definitions and
[1:05:55] the concordance is to render righteous
[1:05:58] are such as he ought to be so what did
[1:06:01] the children of wisdom say that's John
[1:06:04] that's the scripture that's the son of
[1:06:05] man that's the scripture wisdom is
[1:06:08] Justified of her children what was on
[1:06:10] display before them it was the wisdom of
[1:06:13] God and the Forerunner because it was
[1:06:14] the word made manifest the very thoughts
[1:06:16] of God on display and it was wisdom that
[1:06:19] came to them in that day what was it in
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ it was God's wisdom we read
[1:06:24] that in in first Corinthians it was
[1:06:26] God's wisdom on display and they had no
[1:06:29] reaction to it in fact they had an
[1:06:30] adverse reaction to it but don't worry
[1:06:33] wisdom has children meaning the word has
[1:06:36] children the father has children God has
[1:06:39] children and
[1:06:41] wisdom is Justified of her
[1:06:45] children God is Not Looking Through the
[1:06:48] world to accept him he's not looking
[1:06:50] amen for unbelievers to accept him
[1:06:52] what's justifying wisdom her children
[1:06:55] yeah and her children are saying that
[1:06:57] ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:06:59] BR that's exactly the word that's
[1:07:02] exactly the prophecy for our day that's
[1:07:04] exactly right now messenger that's
[1:07:06] Malachi 4 that's Revelation 10:7 that's
[1:07:09] the opening of the seals that's the
[1:07:11] coming of the son of man that's Luke
[1:07:13] 17:30 what is it this great wisdom is
[1:07:15] Justified of her children because her
[1:07:17] children are on earth who come from the
[1:07:19] same Source children of who children of
[1:07:21] this great wisdom that we're talking
[1:07:23] about and what kind of wisdom does do it
[1:07:25] give them it gives them the
[1:07:27] understanding that this is the word for
[1:07:29] this
[1:07:32] day not many mighty not many noble not
[1:07:35] many wise of the
[1:07:37] world but children of
[1:07:42] wisdom we've been through this exercise
[1:07:44] so many times you already know the
[1:07:47] answer but a child of a dog
[1:07:52] is The Offspring or child of a cat is
[1:07:55] yeah and the children of wisdom would
[1:08:00] be they have the wisdom of
[1:08:04] God it's the word it's the mind it's
[1:08:08] it's the
[1:08:09] Revelation wisdom has children God has
[1:08:13] children am the word has
[1:08:15] children and those children they may not
[1:08:19] be able to do
[1:08:23] algebra listen
[1:08:26] when my son was in high school he took a
[1:08:27] physics
[1:08:29] class his mom couldn't help him anymore
[1:08:32] so every night I went to his room for a
[1:08:34] couple of hours to work on physics it
[1:08:36] was the worst time of my
[1:08:40] life I hated school more than he hated
[1:08:46] school we may not have wisdom that
[1:08:49] competes with this world we may not be
[1:08:51] able to figure a lot of things out there
[1:08:53] might be a lot of confusing things
[1:08:54] around us us and we might be considered
[1:08:56] a little bit on the foolish
[1:09:01] side but wisdom has
[1:09:05] children and wisdom is Justified of her
[1:09:08] children not of the world or worldly
[1:09:10] wisdom yeah but of those who when he
[1:09:13] pipes they
[1:09:15] dance and when he Mourns they lament
[1:09:19] because they can respond to the word for
[1:09:21] their day and then they can respond to
[1:09:24] their day of visit ation they can
[1:09:26] respond when the words made manifest
[1:09:28] that children of wisdom can
[1:09:30] respond because that's what wisdom is
[1:09:33] it's the
[1:09:35] word let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:09:47] 12 First Corinthians chapter 12
[1:09:55] to me that's what proved the wise virgin
[1:09:59] wise amen because they heard the
[1:10:01] bridegroom call yeah and they knew what
[1:10:03] to do to trim their lamp and go towards
[1:10:06] that voice because if I go towards the
[1:10:09] voice of the bridegroom call I will meet
[1:10:13] the bridegroom yeah
[1:10:16] amen yeah amen because remember he came
[1:10:20] outside the city and when he come
[1:10:21] outside the city it was the friend of
[1:10:23] the bridegroom that called into the city
[1:10:24] behold the bridegroom cometh come you
[1:10:26] out to meet him that means we had to
[1:10:28] leave denominations we had to leave
[1:10:29] traditions we had to leave everything
[1:10:31] else to come and be United with our
[1:10:33] bridegroom and we're United outside the
[1:10:35] city and then he takes us into the
[1:10:36] marriage supper amen that's what's going
[1:10:39] on now we've heard the Midnight Cry of
[1:10:41] the friend of the bridegroom but the
[1:10:43] wise virgin realized amen she had to
[1:10:46] have the oil so that she could trim the
[1:10:48] lamp which what is the word of God so
[1:10:50] that the word of God could illuminate
[1:10:53] her and bring her towards that voice
[1:10:57] amen not running from The Voice towards
[1:11:00] the voice because somewhere as she moves
[1:11:02] towards the voice outside the city she's
[1:11:04] going to come in contact with her
[1:11:06] bridegroom yeah
[1:11:09] amen praise be to God what made her wise
[1:11:12] is she had oil what made her wise is she
[1:11:14] knew she needed oil what made her wise
[1:11:15] is she knew what to do when she heard
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:20] call he
[1:11:22] says in 1 Corinthians did we read this
[1:11:25] yet that thank you 1 Corinthians
[1:11:30] 12:4
[1:11:31] says uh now there are diversities of
[1:11:34] gifts but the same
[1:11:37] spirit and there are differences of
[1:11:39] administration but the same lord and
[1:11:40] there are diversities of operation but
[1:11:42] it is the same God which worketh all in
[1:11:44] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[1:11:46] is given to every man to profit with all
[1:11:49] for to one is given by the spirit the
[1:11:50] word of wisdom to another the word of
[1:11:52] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:11:55] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[1:11:57] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[1:11:59] another the working of Miracles to
[1:12:01] another prophecy to another Discerning
[1:12:03] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[1:12:05] tongues to another the interpretation of
[1:12:08] tongues but all these worketh that one
[1:12:11] and the self-same spirit dividing to
[1:12:13] every man severly as he Wills so when we
[1:12:16] come to the list of gifts these are the
[1:12:18] gifts of the
[1:12:20] Spirit and we hear sometimes emphasis
[1:12:23] put on one gift over another or certain
[1:12:26] gifts over another but these are all
[1:12:27] gifts of the Spirit and the first one
[1:12:29] listed is the word of wisdom and brother
[1:12:32] B makes a statement about this when he
[1:12:33] says and why we are not a denomination
[1:12:36] he says now how many knows that wisdom
[1:12:38] is one of the gifts of the Spirit praise
[1:12:40] be to God Amen how many knows that
[1:12:43] wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit
[1:12:45] now what kind of groups he's talking to
[1:12:47] then he must be talking to a group of
[1:12:49] people that has the gifts of the Spirit
[1:12:50] operating in this
[1:12:52] church and he's referring back to the
[1:12:55] Book of Revelation when John says here
[1:12:58] is to the mind that hath wisdom I'll
[1:12:59] give you the number of the beast that's
[1:13:00] what he's talking about but brother B
[1:13:02] says who's John talking to he must be
[1:13:04] talking to people that have gifts
[1:13:05] operating in the
[1:13:06] church what gift the gift of wisdom yeah
[1:13:10] operating in the
[1:13:12] church he says now you stop find that
[1:13:16] all through these Church ages here
[1:13:18] pulling out the Holy Spirit speaking out
[1:13:20] how these gifts would be working in the
[1:13:22] last days now we've got Gifts of healing
[1:13:24] working it's going good well brother
[1:13:27] there's other gifts that's just one of
[1:13:29] them that's just a little minor thing
[1:13:31] why here's a far greater gift right here
[1:13:34] which would be the best the gift of the
[1:13:35] Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of
[1:13:38] God together and to show the church
[1:13:39] where we're standing than just to get
[1:13:41] somebody healed we all want to be well
[1:13:44] but I'd rather have my soul well than my
[1:13:46] body well anytime oh my hear the Holy
[1:13:49] Spirit speaking through John at patmas
[1:13:51] here's to the wisdom let him listen to
[1:13:54] this so I want to pull out of there this
[1:13:56] statement of the way brother bam
[1:13:58] describes the gift of wisdom so here's a
[1:14:01] little description and and listen don't
[1:14:04] make this all inclusive he just made a
[1:14:06] statement but it stands out to me he
[1:14:08] said the gift of the Holy Ghost of
[1:14:10] wisdom to put the word of God together
[1:14:13] to show the church where we're standing
[1:14:16] amen so there's a gift of God of wisdom
[1:14:19] and that wisdom is used Amen to take the
[1:14:23] word and put the the word of God
[1:14:25] together to show the church where we're
[1:14:28] standing because wisdom is Justified of
[1:14:31] our children amen amen so we know that
[1:14:35] there's a gift of the spirit called
[1:14:38] wisdom wisdom is part of the nature of
[1:14:40] god let's go to James chapter
[1:14:51] 3 James chter 3 and verse 13
[1:15:03] he said who is a wise man and endued
[1:15:06] with knowledge among you let him show
[1:15:09] out of a good conversation his works
[1:15:10] with meekness of wisdom conversation
[1:15:13] just means manner of
[1:15:14] life with works with meekness of wisdom
[1:15:18] but if you have bitter envying and
[1:15:19] strife in your hearts Glory not and lie
[1:15:22] not against the truth this wisdom
[1:15:25] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[1:15:28] sensual devilish for where envy and
[1:15:30] strife is there is confusion in every
[1:15:32] evil work but the wisdom that is from
[1:15:34] above is first pure then Peaceable
[1:15:38] gentle easy to be entreated full of
[1:15:41] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:15:44] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[1:15:46] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:15:48] that make peace so he begins to tell us
[1:15:50] there's two kinds of
[1:15:52] wisdom there's Earthly wisdom and
[1:15:54] heavenly
[1:15:55] wisdom there's
[1:15:58] wisdom
[1:16:00] uh there's wisdom that he says
[1:16:02] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[1:16:05] sensual devilish so there's more than
[1:16:08] one kind of
[1:16:09] wisdom even the devil is called
[1:16:13] wise he was full of wisdom but it's not
[1:16:16] God's wisdom right it's a different kind
[1:16:19] of wisdom so we want the wisdom that
[1:16:22] comes from
[1:16:23] above and so what are some of the
[1:16:25] attributes of the wisdom that comes from
[1:16:27] above some of the attributes are you
[1:16:29] know more than anybody else around you
[1:16:32] you've got it all figured out everybody
[1:16:34] needs to come to you for the correct
[1:16:37] answers no that's not what it
[1:16:40] says the wisdom that is from above is
[1:16:43] first
[1:16:44] pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to
[1:16:49] be in treated full of mercy and good
[1:16:52] fruits without partiality and without
[1:16:55] hypocrisy these are the attributes of
[1:16:57] the wisdom that comes from
[1:17:00] above this if we have wisdom his wisdom
[1:17:05] a gift of wisdom the wisdom of God and
[1:17:08] our children of
[1:17:09] wisdom then this is the manifestation
[1:17:12] that that wisdom should
[1:17:14] take because if it causes arrogancy or
[1:17:17] Strife or hotty attitudes or then maybe
[1:17:21] that's not the wisdom that comes from
[1:17:23] above amen even if we're using some of
[1:17:27] God's truth in our
[1:17:29] speech right do we understand there's a
[1:17:32] certain character to wisdom because
[1:17:36] wisdom is the word wisdom is God and God
[1:17:39] is wisdom and there's certain
[1:17:41] characteristics to this wisdom the other
[1:17:44] wisdom which the devil has did the Bible
[1:17:47] say he was full of wisdom yeah amen
[1:17:49] Bible said he was wiser than Daniel yeah
[1:17:52] right that's a lot of wisdom amen but
[1:17:54] but it won't display the same Godly
[1:17:57] characteristics amen
[1:18:00] amen so I think wisdom is more than
[1:18:02] knowing
[1:18:03] facts to me it's a lot more than just
[1:18:07] knowing
[1:18:09] facts he says uh brother brandham
[1:18:14] says and God's power to transform said
[1:18:19] it's all right to have wisdom but if the
[1:18:21] wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't
[1:18:23] correct wisdom from God wisdom and
[1:18:26] becomes natural wisdom I don't care how
[1:18:28] much science we have and what more
[1:18:30] education it's of the
[1:18:31] devil in the second seal he says why
[1:18:34] didn't Jesus choose such people he got
[1:18:36] fishermen and men that couldn't even
[1:18:38] sign their own names to put them head of
[1:18:40] his church that's right wisdom is
[1:18:42] nothing it's against Christ worldly
[1:18:45] wisdom is against Christ
[1:18:47] always so brother Bam's not brother
[1:18:50] Bam's saying wisdom is nothing he's
[1:18:53] talking about Earthly wisdom yeah man's
[1:18:55] Wisdom carnal wisdom wisdom of the of
[1:18:57] the world worldly wisdom is against
[1:18:59] Christ always so what did God get to be
[1:19:02] head of his church he said
[1:19:05] fishermen and men that couldn't even
[1:19:07] sign their own names to put them head of
[1:19:09] the church and what did he give them
[1:19:12] wisdom yeah what did they have wisdom
[1:19:15] but not the not what the world would
[1:19:17] label as wisdom yeah
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:23] when brother br gave a definition of
[1:19:25] wisdom earlier and he says the wisdom of
[1:19:28] God that can put the word of God
[1:19:30] together and show the people where they
[1:19:31] live amen it's that wisdom brings a
[1:19:33] correct understanding of the word of God
[1:19:35] but it brings it with the correct nature
[1:19:37] I believe too which is the nature of
[1:19:39] wisdom and they come together Amen to
[1:19:42] display the the very wisdom of God Amen
[1:19:47] but that that wisdom is contrary to
[1:19:51] worldly wisdom and worldly wisdom may
[1:19:54] take the same facts but it'll produce
[1:19:56] something much different amen so God has
[1:20:00] a gift to take the word and put it
[1:20:02] together to meet the challenge of the
[1:20:04] hour but he'll always do it in the right
[1:20:07] character of
[1:20:09] wisdom when Jesus was on Earth the the
[1:20:12] things that Jesus said to the to people
[1:20:15] was absolutely
[1:20:16] astonishing wisdom like we've never seen
[1:20:19] on on the earth displayed before amen
[1:20:22] Solomon had a gift of wisdom Jesus
[1:20:24] outshine Solomon he says there's a
[1:20:26] greater than Solomon here
[1:20:28] now amen and so now we see in that
[1:20:32] wisdom they would try to trap Jesus all
[1:20:35] the time with the word so they the
[1:20:37] Pharisees had the word but they didn't
[1:20:39] have wisdom Jesus was the word and had
[1:20:42] the very nature and character of the
[1:20:44] word amen so they were always trying to
[1:20:46] use the word to defeat the word I find
[1:20:51] that
[1:20:52] amusing and they come to Jesus one time
[1:20:55] and they said is it lawful for us to pay
[1:20:57] tribute to
[1:20:58] Caesar they're trying to trip him up
[1:21:01] because they're they're chose to take
[1:21:03] money and and this money's going to a
[1:21:04] foreign entity and they're and they're
[1:21:06] into idolatry and all kinds of horrible
[1:21:09] things and now the question comes is is
[1:21:11] it right to do this and and what they're
[1:21:13] doing is they're dealing in little
[1:21:14] details and and trying to make him look
[1:21:17] bad in one way or the other either they
[1:21:18] can accuse him amen of being tied into
[1:21:21] the Roman government and supportive of
[1:21:23] an idolatrous pagan
[1:21:25] uh uh uh form of worship and government
[1:21:27] or he won't pay and they can accuse the
[1:21:29] Roman government that he doesn't pay his
[1:21:30] tax either way they got him yeah there
[1:21:33] one of those I got you kind of questions
[1:21:36] don't you love it when somebody comes
[1:21:37] and ask you a question and you know in
[1:21:39] your heart it's an I got you question
[1:21:40] yeah you're just trying to trip me up on
[1:21:42] something you don't actually want to
[1:21:44] know anything yeah
[1:21:46] right I can't stand that and as a pastor
[1:21:50] you get quite a few of
[1:21:52] them so they come to Jesus with a
[1:21:54] question question like
[1:21:56] that and he says give me a coin and give
[1:22:00] him a penny he says whose picture is on
[1:22:02] this said Caesar so then it's easy give
[1:22:05] Caesar what's Caesar and give God what's
[1:22:07] God how did he do that yeah that wasn't
[1:22:11] worldly wisdom amen he understand the
[1:22:14] nature of the word they're trying to
[1:22:15] trip him up on the word and they don't
[1:22:16] even understand the nature of the word
[1:22:18] amen they've got everything so dialed in
[1:22:20] and so uh uh they had such a legalistic
[1:22:23] way that they could prove themselves and
[1:22:25] justify themselves by keeping so much of
[1:22:27] the word and they made it so hard that
[1:22:29] other people couldn't do it so only
[1:22:30] people with good self-control and
[1:22:32] self-will could be righteous people
[1:22:33] which were the Pharisees so they come to
[1:22:36] him when his disciples are walking
[1:22:37] through a field on a on a Saturday on a
[1:22:40] Sabbath day and they're plucking ears of
[1:22:42] corn and they're rubbing them together
[1:22:43] and blowing the chaff away and popping
[1:22:45] the Grain in their mouth and all of a
[1:22:46] sudden they've got problems they got
[1:22:48] problems because they didn't wash their
[1:22:49] hands and they got problems because
[1:22:51] they're working on the Sabbath y
[1:22:55] they come to Jesus with another I got
[1:22:58] you
[1:23:00] moment and Jesus
[1:23:02] says listen didn't you read in the
[1:23:06] Bible I love that
[1:23:09] answer because they're bringing quotes
[1:23:11] out of the
[1:23:12] Bible says did you not read where David
[1:23:16] went took the
[1:23:17] showbread yeah was not lawful for him to
[1:23:22] take Jesus is so far far
[1:23:25] beyond the pettiness of their Vision
[1:23:28] amen he's moved so far beyond these
[1:23:32] little things and he's moved into the
[1:23:33] very nature of the word he is he was the
[1:23:36] word the very nature of the word and
[1:23:38] understood what God wanted amen when
[1:23:42] they brought the woman to him that was
[1:23:43] caught in the very Act of adultery they
[1:23:45] had him nailed this time because she's
[1:23:47] caught in the very Act of
[1:23:50] adultery but somehow Jesus could discern
[1:23:53] and know that that whole thing was a
[1:23:55] setup yeah right and he unraveled the
[1:23:59] whole setup because listen this wasn't a
[1:24:03] debate between Jesus and the Pharisees
[1:24:06] on the word yeah he wasn't
[1:24:10] debating he went beyond the squabble he
[1:24:14] went beyond the tis fortat and he went
[1:24:17] to the very nature and he started to
[1:24:19] show that you who want to condemn have
[1:24:22] the wrong nature
[1:24:24] yeah amen you're claiming to be standing
[1:24:28] by the word but you're not actually
[1:24:30] standing by the word because you don't
[1:24:32] have the nature of the word and you're
[1:24:35] not applying the nature of the word in
[1:24:37] this
[1:24:39] circumstance listen they this was a
[1:24:42] total setup they found a woman caught in
[1:24:44] the very Act of adultery if she's caught
[1:24:46] in the very Act of adultery then they
[1:24:47] had a they knew exactly who the man was
[1:24:51] y right but the Bible tells us that
[1:24:54] they're both supposed to be condemned
[1:24:57] and they're both supposed to be stoned
[1:24:59] so right away amen they they're keeping
[1:25:02] the word but not keeping the word they
[1:25:04] don't have pure motives amen they're not
[1:25:07] pure they're not gentle they don't have
[1:25:08] the wisdom that come from above but this
[1:25:10] is devilish sensual wisdom trying to do
[1:25:14] trying to get rid of an enemy yeah right
[1:25:18] and to do so they'll take the word and
[1:25:20] manipulate it by their own wisdom Amen
[1:25:22] to serve their own purpose and it was
[1:25:24] never God's original intent to begin
[1:25:26] with so Jesus comes and flies higher
[1:25:28] than all of that and starts to expose
[1:25:30] the hypocrisy that's in their heart and
[1:25:32] he doesn't tell him you're wrong or you
[1:25:33] can't soner or you're off the word he
[1:25:36] just says which one of you is without
[1:25:38] sin Let Him cast the first stone and all
[1:25:40] the sudden starting from the oldest to
[1:25:41] the youngest they dropped their stones
[1:25:43] and they walked away I said oh God
[1:25:45] that's the wisdom I want in my life
[1:25:47] that's the wisdom from above amen that
[1:25:50] there's no listen Jesus in no way
[1:25:52] violated the word of God he kept it all
[1:25:55] in every point but he had a greater
[1:25:58] understanding than what the Pharisees
[1:25:59] were trying to bring him into they were
[1:26:01] trying to lower him into a tis fortat
[1:26:04] devilish wisdom on the Bible yeah amen
[1:26:09] right I want that wisdom in me the one
[1:26:13] that
[1:26:15] knows brother Brenham says this I may
[1:26:17] not know my Bible very well but I know
[1:26:19] the author very well that's what I'm
[1:26:21] after friends I think that's what this
[1:26:23] wisdom is it's it's the life of the
[1:26:25] author it's the mind of the author amen
[1:26:27] it's the wisdom of the
[1:26:29] author that's what I
[1:26:32] want amen when we go to apply the word
[1:26:36] if we don't apply with wisdom we can do
[1:26:38] more damage than
[1:26:40] good you think about even raising young
[1:26:43] children if you've if you've got a
[1:26:45] little toddler there you probably know
[1:26:47] that the Bible says you spare the rod
[1:26:49] and you spoil the
[1:26:52] child amen but if you if you apply that
[1:26:54] with no
[1:26:56] wisdom what's going to
[1:26:58] happen you realize that's not the only
[1:27:01] scripture that the Bible says about
[1:27:02] raising children you do know that right
[1:27:06] I mean that's the one that gets quoted a
[1:27:07] lot when you have a little toddler and
[1:27:08] they're that age where they need a lot
[1:27:09] of Correction but the Bible also says
[1:27:12] bring them up in the fear and admonition
[1:27:13] of the Lord It also says nurture them
[1:27:15] and it also says
[1:27:17] instruct amen your son so if we only get
[1:27:21] one part of the word but we don't get
[1:27:22] the full picture from the the wisdom of
[1:27:25] God and raising children then we go to
[1:27:27] apply the word with our narrow vision
[1:27:29] and our own human understanding amen for
[1:27:31] our own outcomes and we apply the word
[1:27:33] and we can do more damage than good and
[1:27:35] you say I don't know what's wrong with
[1:27:36] him I did what the word said you didn't
[1:27:39] do all that the word said because you
[1:27:40] didn't catch the whole nature of the
[1:27:42] word amen because the nature of the word
[1:27:44] says teach along the way instruct thy
[1:27:47] son and it tells you to nurture and
[1:27:50] admonish Amen to care for and to love
[1:27:53] and to take time to instruct and teach
[1:27:56] and then when you have to administer
[1:27:57] chastisement you must administer
[1:27:59] chastisement and also chastisement is
[1:28:01] administered for Rebellion amen right
[1:28:06] that's right not because you had them
[1:28:08] out running around all day and they're
[1:28:09] too tired and they can't control their
[1:28:11] own emotions that's your fault not their
[1:28:13] fault that's not Rebellion that's
[1:28:16] exhaustion so you understand that to
[1:28:18] apply the word correctly we must apply
[1:28:21] the word with wisdom amen
[1:28:25] and that's just one little
[1:28:28] example there's we could go through
[1:28:30] example after example after
[1:28:32] example that if we don't have the mind
[1:28:35] of Christ if we don't take the mind of
[1:28:37] the
[1:28:38] author we're going to do the same thing
[1:28:40] the Pharisees did yeah amen I said God
[1:28:45] what I want more than anything is I have
[1:28:48] to get this wisdom amen I have to buy it
[1:28:51] yeah and sell it not
[1:28:54] uh I want it it's more than
[1:28:58] rubies do we realize this now this
[1:29:00] wisdom that's from above it's far more
[1:29:03] than silver and
[1:29:04] gold we got to get
[1:29:07] it we got to get
[1:29:10] it 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:29:15] 8 I want to lay this scripture in as
[1:29:17] well
[1:29:25] 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse
[1:29:31] 1 now as touching things offered under
[1:29:34] Idols we know that we all have knowledge
[1:29:37] knowledge puff puffeth up but charity
[1:29:39] edth fth and if any man think that he
[1:29:42] knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet
[1:29:45] as he ought to
[1:29:47] know oh man I if I could paste this
[1:29:52] right in an ink on the back of my hand
[1:29:54] so that I won't forget
[1:29:58] it if any man think that he knoweth
[1:30:01] anything he knoweth nothing yet as he
[1:30:03] ought to
[1:30:05] know brother brenham's preaching on the
[1:30:07] revelation of the hour after the seals
[1:30:09] he's saying now I know you don't
[1:30:10] understand you don't see it like you
[1:30:11] should he said frankly I don't see it
[1:30:13] like I
[1:30:14] should oh friends that's the spirit of
[1:30:18] wisdom because Paul tolds us if you
[1:30:20] think you know anything you don't know
[1:30:25] it the way you should know
[1:30:27] it he's not saying you don't know
[1:30:29] something about it he's not saying you
[1:30:31] don't have some knowledge but if you
[1:30:33] think you know it and you got to figure
[1:30:35] it out you actually don't know it like
[1:30:37] you ought
[1:30:38] to because if you knew it like you ought
[1:30:40] to you would realize it's deeper it's
[1:30:42] wider it's broader it's higher amen
[1:30:45] every word of God is beyond my peanut
[1:30:47] brain every word every jot every tit is
[1:30:51] beyond even my comprehension it goes so
[1:30:53] farther so deeper so all-encompassing
[1:30:55] that I look at it and I think it means
[1:30:57] this amen 10 years later it expands 10
[1:30:59] years later it expands amen if we think
[1:31:02] we know something we don't know it as we
[1:31:04] ought
[1:31:06] yet oh God let this be a warning to all
[1:31:09] of us amen we think we know the message
[1:31:10] we barely know the message friends cuz
[1:31:13] the message is Christ and he'll be
[1:31:15] unfolding himself throughout
[1:31:19] eternity amen so let that be a warning
[1:31:22] to all of us amen
[1:31:24] uh this past Friday night the uh the
[1:31:27] deacons and I and our wives we all took
[1:31:29] brother Dave and sister Bessie out to
[1:31:31] dinner and we just wanted to thank him
[1:31:33] for his service and for what we learned
[1:31:35] from him in all the years that we've
[1:31:36] worked together with him and I asked him
[1:31:38] a question I said what's a piece of
[1:31:40] advice that you would give what's one
[1:31:42] lesson you learned after 47 years of
[1:31:44] being a deacon and his answer was so
[1:31:48] good he said I don't know anything at
[1:31:51] all
[1:31:54] God after 47 years of helping people
[1:31:57] through issues dealing with church
[1:31:58] issues and he realized he doesn't know
[1:32:02] anything and he can't do
[1:32:05] anything I think that's made him a good
[1:32:10] Deacon oh God help me to get the same
[1:32:13] lesson in reality if I think I know
[1:32:15] something I don't know anything as I
[1:32:17] ought
[1:32:19] yet as a pastor I don't have anything
[1:32:21] figured out friends I have no idea
[1:32:23] what's going to happen tomorrow tomorrow
[1:32:25] or what we should do or how to fix
[1:32:27] situations we're just going one step at
[1:32:30] a time trusting his word to give us
[1:32:33] answers as the light shines as we take a
[1:32:36] step the light shines we'll take the
[1:32:37] next step amen because we ain't got it
[1:32:39] figured out God helped me to be like
[1:32:42] what Dave said I don't know anything and
[1:32:44] I can't do nothing oh praise God that's
[1:32:47] what he that's why he got fishermen who
[1:32:49] are illiterate yeah that's why that's
[1:32:52] why the Apostle uh Peter when he thought
[1:32:54] he could defend the word and he took out
[1:32:56] a sword and tried to defend Jesus amen
[1:32:58] and he find out it all went to ruin and
[1:33:00] shame amen and he had to repent of that
[1:33:02] and he he flattened himself in humility
[1:33:04] and realized I can't defend the word I
[1:33:07] can't do anything I'm wrong yeah amen oh
[1:33:11] man it's good it's good for us to have a
[1:33:13] few Peter moves in our
[1:33:14] life how many's had a few Peter moves in
[1:33:17] your life I'll not forsake you I won't
[1:33:19] let this happen I'll defend the word
[1:33:21] I and how many of it ended in humility
[1:33:25] embarrassment maybe chest chastening and
[1:33:28] a little bit of
[1:33:29] scoring oh it was the best thing that
[1:33:31] ever happened to us it'd be better if it
[1:33:33] happened to us daily so that we realize
[1:33:35] we don't know anything as we ought to
[1:33:36] know
[1:33:38] yet praise God I want wisdom it's
[1:33:42] amazing how Jesus could answer like we
[1:33:45] talked about example after example he
[1:33:47] can answer you know brother Brandon did
[1:33:48] the same thing why because that Spirit
[1:33:51] of wisdom was working through that gift
[1:33:52] in his life people would ask question
[1:33:54] and he would he would just pop off
[1:33:55] answers and I'm thinking that's the
[1:33:58] smartest man in the world I would have
[1:33:59] never thought to say that listen it
[1:34:02] wasn't the smartest man in the world it
[1:34:03] was the spirit it was the life that was
[1:34:05] working through that kid it was the same
[1:34:08] life that was working in Jesus Christ
[1:34:09] that same life was working through that
[1:34:11] prophet and he'd give answers that
[1:34:14] astonish me make my jaw jop the way he
[1:34:16] handled situations but you know the
[1:34:18] Bible says that when you're called
[1:34:19] before Kings and magistrates don't think
[1:34:21] what you'll say
[1:34:24] for to be given you of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:26] and that hour what you should speak
[1:34:27] right now I got a I got a little quiz
[1:34:30] for you not a quiz but a uh uh let's
[1:34:33] just suppose for a minute let's play the
[1:34:35] world of
[1:34:37] imagination they say you're driving to
[1:34:39] work tomorrow you get pulled over you
[1:34:40] get arrested because they found out
[1:34:42] you're part of a cult and they go and
[1:34:43] they lock you in and you're going to
[1:34:44] have to give an answer for it to the
[1:34:46] magistrate or to the judge the next day
[1:34:48] do you know what you're going to do all
[1:34:51] night I got to remember that verse and I
[1:34:53] got remember how it's worded and because
[1:34:55] this I've got a good case here because
[1:34:57] they have no right and what did the
[1:34:58] Constitution say about freedom of
[1:35:01] religion That's The Human Side Oh but if
[1:35:04] we can just break away from The Human
[1:35:06] Side and trust the spirit of God as the
[1:35:09] spirit of wisdom to come and give us
[1:35:11] wisdom in the time of need and stop
[1:35:13] trying to figure it all out before
[1:35:16] that's what that's what we were told in
[1:35:18] the Bible to do don't figure it out
[1:35:20] before just go and if that Life of
[1:35:23] Christ is in you the same wisdom that
[1:35:25] was here answering Pharisees can be here
[1:35:28] to answer whatever and if he doesn't
[1:35:30] give you an answer that means he wants
[1:35:32] you locked
[1:35:35] up then praise God if that's what he
[1:35:37] wants that's what I want to give him
[1:35:39] that's what he wanted in Paul so Paul
[1:35:41] could wrote all those letters it didn't
[1:35:42] matter what Paul said Paul wasn't
[1:35:44] getting out of there because he had
[1:35:45] Epistles to
[1:35:48] write praise be to God help us Lord amen
[1:35:55] brother benam made this statement now I
[1:35:57] want to go back to
[1:35:59] buy get buy and don't sell wisdom and
[1:36:03] understanding and Truth in the message
[1:36:06] Shalom brother bam said listen friends
[1:36:09] as we close remember the Bible is the
[1:36:11] Fountain of all
[1:36:14] wisdom it doesn't come from dror PhD lld
[1:36:17] it comes from the word of
[1:36:19] God so how many wants to buy wisdom
[1:36:23] get wisdom acquire
[1:36:26] wisdom this is the Fountain of all
[1:36:29] wisdom that means it's flowing out of
[1:36:33] the word brother Brenham say also says
[1:36:35] in another message God is the Fountain
[1:36:38] of all Grace and power and of all Divine
[1:36:41] wisdom is in God so who's the fountain
[1:36:44] is it God or the
[1:36:46] word that's the right answer am
[1:36:50] amen because God is the word and the
[1:36:52] word is God
[1:36:54] amen where do I go to get this wisdom
[1:36:58] the word of God Amen where do I go to
[1:37:02] find it it's the word of Goden and this
[1:37:05] is the thought this me personally now
[1:37:07] I'm going to share with you the thought
[1:37:08] that I've been meditating on for weeks
[1:37:10] the thought that came and I began to
[1:37:12] realize I realized in myself that so
[1:37:15] many times I've read the Bible and I've
[1:37:18] read the message to gain
[1:37:22] knowledge and it wasn't bad I don't
[1:37:24] don't think evil if that's you too but I
[1:37:28] was reading it cuz I wanted to know how
[1:37:29] to be right I wanted to know what was
[1:37:31] right I wanted to know what Doctrine was
[1:37:33] right because I didn't want to be
[1:37:36] wrong and there was times especially
[1:37:40] early on in my walk that when I went to
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:44] Bible I was going to the Bible for
[1:37:47] knowledge so that I would know
[1:37:51] more than someone else
[1:37:54] y because I was coming out of a
[1:37:56] denominational system and I was having
[1:37:58] talks with people and I would go to the
[1:38:00] Bible for knowledge so I could take the
[1:38:01] knowledge and I could and I could share
[1:38:04] the knowledge or offset what they're
[1:38:05] saying with my knowledge and it was it
[1:38:07] was really more of
[1:38:10] debate and defending my faith and
[1:38:13] defending what I believed and I was
[1:38:14] going to the Bible for knowledge what's
[1:38:16] the truth on serpent SE what are the
[1:38:18] scriptures that support serpent SE what
[1:38:20] is the truth on the Oneness of the
[1:38:21] godhead what is the truth on water
[1:38:23] baptism and what are all the scriptures
[1:38:24] that support that so that I could have
[1:38:26] knowledge and I could have a case and I
[1:38:28] could sell my case
[1:38:31] yeah but I just over the last little
[1:38:35] while I don't know how long I mean it's
[1:38:38] been a while but I started
[1:38:40] thinking that's not why I go to the word
[1:38:43] anymore
[1:38:44] amen amen now I'm going to the word for
[1:38:49] wisdom
[1:38:50] amen because
[1:38:53] all my knowledge didn't really do
[1:38:57] much those who didn't believe still
[1:38:59] didn't believe I still believe they
[1:39:01] still didn't believe and all we did was
[1:39:04] throw a few barbs at each other and
[1:39:06] nothing
[1:39:08] changed
[1:39:10] yeah and I realized what I need from the
[1:39:13] word is not just knowledge although
[1:39:16] there is a Godly knowledge it's part of
[1:39:19] a statue of a perfect man it's the
[1:39:20] knowledge of
[1:39:22] God but what I needed was wisdom to
[1:39:26] apply that
[1:39:28] knowledge because I would be applying
[1:39:30] the knowledge incorrectly I would have
[1:39:32] the right knowledge I had the right
[1:39:34] Doctrine I had the right Revelation but
[1:39:36] my application was
[1:39:38] suffering we've seen that so many times
[1:39:41] in the truth we we've got the right
[1:39:42] Revelation we've got the right word
[1:39:44] we've got the right Doctrine we've got
[1:39:46] it all right but sometimes if our
[1:39:48] application is wrong we wind up with the
[1:39:51] wrong outcome and we say Well it's not
[1:39:53] my
[1:39:54] fault because I used the
[1:39:58] word but did we use the word with the
[1:40:01] spirit of
[1:40:03] wisdom
[1:40:05] gentleness Peaceable the list we got the
[1:40:08] wisdom that is from above is first
[1:40:11] gentle well I can tell you I was not
[1:40:14] always
[1:40:15] gentle I was not always
[1:40:18] peaceful and I was using knowledge
[1:40:21] without wisdom
[1:40:24] but oh if we could be like Christ if we
[1:40:27] could be like the prophet if we could
[1:40:28] use knowledge with wisdom what could God
[1:40:31] do
[1:40:32] friends I want to go back quickly to the
[1:40:36] definition that I read at the
[1:40:38] beginning just to refresh you on
[1:40:41] wisdom is the ability excuse me is the
[1:40:44] ability to judge correctly and to follow
[1:40:47] the best course of action based on
[1:40:50] knowledge and understanding
[1:40:53] wisdom is the ability to see something
[1:40:55] from God's
[1:40:56] Viewpoint wisdom is God's character in
[1:41:00] The Many practical Affairs of
[1:41:02] life oh we've gained some knowledge but
[1:41:05] you know what I need I need wisdom to
[1:41:07] use that knowledge in fact I'm kind of
[1:41:11] afraid to use the knowledge without
[1:41:14] wisdom come to the place where I'm
[1:41:16] looking at the message I'm not just
[1:41:18] looking at the message to find out
[1:41:19] what's correct Doctrine I'm looking at
[1:41:21] the message and learning from the way
[1:41:23] brother bham handles
[1:41:25] situations because what we're seeing is
[1:41:27] the wisdom of God did he have the
[1:41:29] revelation of the word did he had the
[1:41:30] full understanding the word absolutely
[1:41:33] but now I'm looking how did he apply
[1:41:35] that word how did he deal with other
[1:41:36] people how did he correct situations how
[1:41:39] did he do that because I need wisdom to
[1:41:41] apply this
[1:41:48] word the in in John 16 I'm going to read
[1:41:53] this scripture to you in John
[1:41:54] 16 Jesus says verse 13 how be it when he
[1:41:59] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:42:01] guide you into all truth amen for he
[1:42:04] shall not speak of himself but
[1:42:06] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:42:08] speak and he shall show you things that
[1:42:09] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:42:12] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:42:15] you all things that the father ha our
[1:42:17] mind therefore said I that he shall take
[1:42:19] a mine and shall show it unto you what
[1:42:22] is this oil that the wise virgin had it
[1:42:24] was the Holy Ghost what is the Holy
[1:42:26] Ghost the spirit of Truth amen do you
[1:42:28] know the spirit of Truth is also the
[1:42:31] spirit of wisdom amen because there is a
[1:42:33] spirit of wisdom but it's the same
[1:42:35] Spirit yeah so do I want the spirit of
[1:42:37] God or the spirit of Christ or the
[1:42:39] spirit of wisdom or the spirit of Truth
[1:42:42] or the comforter right it's all the same
[1:42:45] Spirit
[1:42:46] friends it's all part of that nature and
[1:42:50] we want that Spirit of Truth who will
[1:42:51] guide us into all truth listen I don't
[1:42:54] believe this guiding into all truth
[1:42:55] because God is
[1:42:58] truth so guiding me into all truth is
[1:43:01] not guiding me into all the facts
[1:43:04] because facts don't necessarily equal
[1:43:08] truth I can assemble a bunch of facts
[1:43:11] and give you facts and nothing but facts
[1:43:13] but the way I assemble those facts will
[1:43:15] cause you to believe something other
[1:43:17] than the truth yeah right so the the
[1:43:21] spirit of Truth did not come to give us
[1:43:23] all the facts the spirit of Truth came
[1:43:25] to make all those facts still true yeah
[1:43:30] that I present the
[1:43:31] truth truly yeah that I represent Christ
[1:43:36] in truth and the word that I speak I
[1:43:39] speak it in Truth in the spirit of truth
[1:43:42] because it's a representation of Truth
[1:43:45] and I didn't make the word a lie because
[1:43:48] I brought with it my temperament and my
[1:43:50] aggression and my self-serving agenda
[1:43:52] and my purpose behind it yeah cuz if I
[1:43:55] bring the word with my purpose and I
[1:43:57] want to shut you down and I want to
[1:43:59] correct you and I and I want to and I
[1:44:01] want I want to do something that I gain
[1:44:03] something out of it if I bring the word
[1:44:05] that way I have not brought the truth
[1:44:08] even if everything I said was
[1:44:11] true because there was no Spirit of
[1:44:14] Truth in
[1:44:15] it this is where the spirit of wisdom
[1:44:17] will help us so much to bring the truth
[1:44:21] in truth and so it's all truth yes
[1:44:25] praise God let's go to 1 Corinthians
[1:44:27] chapter
[1:44:44] 2 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:44:48] 2:2 now we have received not the spirit
[1:44:50] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:44:52] god which we might know the things that
[1:44:54] are freely given to us of God which
[1:44:56] things also we speak not in The Words
[1:44:58] which man's Wisdom teaches but which the
[1:44:59] Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:45:02] things with spiritual but the natural
[1:45:04] man receiveth not the things of the
[1:45:06] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[1:45:07] unto him neither can he know them
[1:45:09] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:45:11] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[1:45:13] things yet he himself is Judge of no man
[1:45:15] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[1:45:17] that he may instruct him but we have the
[1:45:20] mind of Christ how do we have the mind
[1:45:23] of Christ because of the spirit of
[1:45:26] Christ the spirit of Christ is the holy
[1:45:28] ghost that has the mind of
[1:45:31] Christ and brother Brenham uh uh in
[1:45:34] spoken words The Original Seed there's a
[1:45:36] section that we talk about all the time
[1:45:38] where where the angel told him to pick
[1:45:40] up his pen and write and he tells us
[1:45:42] it's a message from the angel to the
[1:45:45] people and in this he makes this
[1:45:47] statement he says now notice the harmony
[1:45:49] Jesus never did anything until seing of
[1:45:52] the father the father showed him first
[1:45:54] Harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:45:56] 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her
[1:45:59] his word of life he shows her and she
[1:46:01] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:46:03] can harm her not even death for if the
[1:46:05] seed be planted the water will rise it
[1:46:07] up again amen then then he said then I
[1:46:11] got a great big Hallelujah apparently he
[1:46:12] wrote Hallelujah on there here is the
[1:46:14] secret the word is in the bride and the
[1:46:18] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:46:21] done with the word
[1:46:24] word and she does it in his name she has
[1:46:27] thus sayeth the Lord then it's gerti so
[1:46:30] that the Holy Spirit Waters it until
[1:46:32] it's grown and serves its
[1:46:34] purpose this is one of those other
[1:46:36] statements I started thinking
[1:46:38] about that the word is in the
[1:46:41] bride and the mind of Christ which I
[1:46:46] would think is the spirit of wisdom Amen
[1:46:49] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:46:53] see we have the
[1:46:55] word but what we need is the spirit of
[1:46:59] wisdom we need the mind of Christ to
[1:47:01] know what he wants done with the word
[1:47:04] amen there's so many times we know we
[1:47:07] know this isn't exactly right or that's
[1:47:09] not exactly right or this situation the
[1:47:11] word says this and the Bible says that
[1:47:13] but the question is not what facts do I
[1:47:17] have the question is what does he want
[1:47:20] done with the word
[1:47:24] yeah when they brought when they brought
[1:47:27] the woman caught in the very Act of
[1:47:28] adultery to
[1:47:30] Jesus they had some word he had the word
[1:47:32] he knew the word he knew what Moses said
[1:47:34] but the question now was was not what
[1:47:37] does the word say just black and white
[1:47:40] the question now is what does he want
[1:47:41] done with the
[1:47:44] word oh God grant us your
[1:47:47] wisdom and the bride will have it amen
[1:47:50] because this is a promise for the end
[1:47:52] time amen she will be so much like him
[1:47:54] she will be him he is in this age God
[1:47:56] has uncapped himself amen whatever
[1:47:59] barrier there was through false teaching
[1:48:01] and Doctrine he's removed it and brought
[1:48:02] us the truth so that he could bring the
[1:48:04] fullness of his life when he brings us
[1:48:05] the fullness of his life he's bringing
[1:48:07] to the bride the spirit of
[1:48:09] wisdom and I say oh God give me that
[1:48:12] wisdom so that I know what you want done
[1:48:15] with your word amen I think if we can
[1:48:19] get to that place
[1:48:23] I think that's when he'll have
[1:48:24] preeminence that's what he's going for
[1:48:26] that's what he wants he doesn't want us
[1:48:28] to run off and do our own thing but he
[1:48:30] wants through the spirit of wisdom to to
[1:48:32] take the word and apply the word the way
[1:48:34] he wants the word so we know what he
[1:48:36] wants done with his word yeah we know
[1:48:39] what correct doctrines are many times
[1:48:41] we've been taught very well many things
[1:48:42] and we understand a lot amen but one
[1:48:45] thing I don't understand every situation
[1:48:47] I find I don't automatically know what
[1:48:49] he wants done in this word in this
[1:48:51] situation I'm going to have to the
[1:48:53] spirit of
[1:48:54] wisdom we don't have index cards we
[1:48:56] don't have a Rolodex we don't have a a
[1:48:59] database where you type in situation a
[1:49:02] situation B spit out your scriptural
[1:49:04] answer no amen we've got the word now we
[1:49:07] need his mind his Spirit the spirit of
[1:49:10] the the mind the author the spirit of
[1:49:11] the author with his word so that we do
[1:49:13] what he wants with his word amen I don't
[1:49:17] know about you but I'm tired of doing
[1:49:18] what I want with his word I want to do
[1:49:20] what he wants with his word
[1:49:25] brother bandam made makes this statement
[1:49:28] and just once more Lord I found it
[1:49:32] amazing he
[1:49:34] said if God come to me and said I want
[1:49:38] you to go to Earth and I was up there
[1:49:40] and he said go to Earth and I'm going to
[1:49:42] give you a 100-year space of knowledge
[1:49:44] but I want you to lot your your years
[1:49:46] what years you want to take the first 25
[1:49:48] the second 25 the 3D 25 or the last 25
[1:49:53] I would say well if I'm going to put my
[1:49:55] time here to be a football player an
[1:49:56] athlete or something I better take the
[1:49:58] first
[1:49:59] 25 if I'm going to be here to be a
[1:50:01] carpenter or some person like that well
[1:50:03] I better take the second
[1:50:05] 25 but if I want to take to serve the
[1:50:08] Lord I'll take the last 25 from 75 to
[1:50:13] 100 because I've had the accumulation of
[1:50:15] that much knowledge and I know more
[1:50:17] about
[1:50:19] it what time did he want if he could
[1:50:22] have had had any time allotment he
[1:50:24] wanted what time would he take he would
[1:50:26] have take the last 75 to 100 listen when
[1:50:29] he's the weakest yeah when he has the
[1:50:31] least capabilities when maybe even his
[1:50:34] mind isn't as sharp as it used to be and
[1:50:36] his body is not as Cooperative as it
[1:50:38] used to be if he doesn't have the energy
[1:50:40] and the stamina and the strength and all
[1:50:42] that he had amen but he said he he's
[1:50:45] going to take that time because he would
[1:50:46] have gained in those first 75 years
[1:50:49] something that will carry him through
[1:50:51] regardless of the condition of his body
[1:50:53] he wasn't looking at the weakness of his
[1:50:55] body because the weakness in weakness is
[1:50:57] strength made perfect amen what brother
[1:50:59] benam was looking at is I finally after
[1:51:02] all those years might finally know how
[1:51:04] to serve the
[1:51:05] Lord yeah amen oh praise God Amen we we
[1:51:10] we we want strength and we want vitality
[1:51:13] and we want this and that and all these
[1:51:15] other things but what God wants is God
[1:51:17] wants humility and surrender and
[1:51:19] somebody that'll just stay out of the
[1:51:21] way and let him have his way and oh God
[1:51:23] if you could give us 75 100 a th000
[1:51:27] 6,000 years with an understanding from
[1:51:29] your mind amen and put it inside of us
[1:51:31] so that we know what you've done done
[1:51:32] with your word yeah let us not rely on
[1:51:35] our strength our Vitality our mental
[1:51:37] prowess let's put all that aside and say
[1:51:40] I need the spirit of the
[1:51:42] author the spirit of wisdom to come into
[1:51:46] me found that astounding you know when I
[1:51:49] was young that wasn't such a big
[1:51:51] statement for me I was like yeah okay
[1:51:52] whatever brother man says as long as I
[1:51:54] can work walk what doesn't matter to me
[1:51:56] now that's the next thing he says as
[1:51:57] long as I can stand on my two feet and
[1:51:58] walk around what difference does it make
[1:52:00] how old I am I'm here to serve the Lord
[1:52:02] and that's it what he's saying is I
[1:52:03] wasn't here to accomplish anything for
[1:52:04] myself anyways as long as I got some
[1:52:06] Mobility I'll serve the
[1:52:08] Lord and before I used to think yeah
[1:52:10] that's whatever but listen anymore as
[1:52:13] I'm finishing my second 25 years and
[1:52:15] getting ready to go into the third I
[1:52:17] realize what a big deal that
[1:52:20] is that he would volunteer for those
[1:52:26] years oh if we could just have that
[1:52:28] mindset
[1:52:30] friends you know we've been many many
[1:52:33] decades now that the word of God's been
[1:52:35] delivered to
[1:52:37] us many decades since the message has
[1:52:40] come it's been over 60 years since the
[1:52:43] seals have been preached
[1:52:45] and but maybe God just needs for us to
[1:52:48] have enough
[1:52:50] time to finally know how to do
[1:52:54] something maybe we maybe we needed to
[1:52:57] fail in a lot of human efforts maybe we
[1:53:00] needed our churches to fail and our
[1:53:02] Ministries to fail and ourselves to fail
[1:53:04] and our families to fail maybe we needed
[1:53:06] to come to this place where that you
[1:53:09] come in human life after 75 years of
[1:53:11] trying and failing and getting it right
[1:53:13] getting it wrong and learning something
[1:53:14] where you finally come to the place
[1:53:16] where you says like brother brother Dave
[1:53:18] Wood says I don't know anything and I
[1:53:21] can't do anything praise God maybe
[1:53:24] that's what he wants us to achieve maybe
[1:53:26] the Pinnacle of our Revelation the
[1:53:28] highest we come in humanity at the end
[1:53:30] of all of this in adoption as we get to
[1:53:32] the place where it says I don't know
[1:53:34] anything and I can't do
[1:53:37] anything help us
[1:53:40] Lord Paul the Apostle he prays in
[1:53:44] Colossians 1:9 he says for this cause we
[1:53:46] also since the day we heard it do not
[1:53:47] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[1:53:51] you might be filled with the knowledge
[1:53:53] of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:53:56] understanding that you might walk worthy
[1:53:58] of the Lord into all pleasing being
[1:54:00] fruitful in every good work and
[1:54:01] increasing in the knowledge of God what
[1:54:04] was Paul's prayer for that early
[1:54:06] church that they would be filled with
[1:54:08] all knowledge of his will and all wisdom
[1:54:11] and understand spiritual understanding
[1:54:13] in Ephesians 1:15 he says wherefore I
[1:54:16] also after I heard of your faith in the
[1:54:18] Lord Jesus and love unto all Saints
[1:54:20] cease not to give thanks for you making
[1:54:22] mention of you in my prayers that the
[1:54:24] god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father
[1:54:26] of Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:54:28] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[1:54:31] of
[1:54:32] him Paul was
[1:54:34] praying for his disciples he was praying
[1:54:37] for the church that God would grant them
[1:54:40] this Spirit of knowledge Spirit of
[1:54:42] understanding Spirit of
[1:54:43] wisdom I'll take those prayers now amen
[1:54:48] I want to look at one more scripture if
[1:54:49] you can turn with me to James and we'll
[1:54:50] finish here if the musicians want to
[1:54:52] come brother Blake if you'd like to come
[1:54:54] on
[1:54:55] up let turn to the Book of James chapter
[1:55:05] 1 James chapter
[1:55:08] 1 I just want to read one
[1:55:11] scripture and that's verse
[1:55:13] five if any of you lack wisdom let them
[1:55:17] ask of God that giveth to all men
[1:55:19] liberally and unrath not in a shall be
[1:55:22] given
[1:55:24] him I'll take
[1:55:26] it I'm going to take this as my promise
[1:55:30] amen do you know what I realize I lack
[1:55:33] wisdom I need more wisdom I need the
[1:55:36] more of the mind of the author in me but
[1:55:39] he told us if you're in that position if
[1:55:42] any of you here feel like you lack
[1:55:44] wisdom I got good news for
[1:55:46] you CU James said let him ask of God
[1:55:50] that giveth to all men
[1:55:55] liberally I'm glad God's a
[1:56:02] liberal he give to all men liberally and
[1:56:05] unrath not and it shall be given
[1:56:09] himen you know what I'm going to do I'm
[1:56:12] going to go get some wisdom amen because
[1:56:15] the Bible told me to get it yeah the
[1:56:17] Bible told me to buy it and sell it not
[1:56:21] Bible told me it's worth more than
[1:56:23] rubies or riches it's the principal
[1:56:25] thing and it's the thing we're striving
[1:56:26] for and having so what am I going to do
[1:56:29] I'm going to go to the Fountain of
[1:56:30] wisdom and every time I open up the
[1:56:33] Fountain of wisdom whether it be this
[1:56:34] Bible or the message that God given us
[1:56:35] in a message book every time I open them
[1:56:37] up I'm going to say God would you give
[1:56:39] me wisdom because God gives liberally
[1:56:42] and abrath not and gives to him that
[1:56:44] ask and I'm not going to go to the word
[1:56:47] anymore looking for facts for debate or
[1:56:49] material to win an argument or for some
[1:56:52] reason reason to show that I know more
[1:56:53] than somebody else but now I'm going to
[1:56:55] the word because I need the Fountain of
[1:56:58] the word to flow out for me wisdom and
[1:57:02] understanding and knowledge and the Very
[1:57:04] nature of
[1:57:06] Christ and I just I just believe that
[1:57:09] the Bible's true that if any of us need
[1:57:12] wisdom and lack
[1:57:15] wisdom I can't imagine any of us being
[1:57:18] here today and saying well I don't need
[1:57:19] to pray that
[1:57:20] prayer that's only for people who lack
[1:57:23] wisdom I think we all find ourselves in
[1:57:26] the Book of James if we lack wisdom I
[1:57:29] know what to do now there's a fountain
[1:57:32] there's a source and there's a father
[1:57:34] who gives liberally if we ask amen
[1:57:37] saying God teach
[1:57:39] me teach me how to know more than
[1:57:42] somebody else teach me how to be better
[1:57:43] teach me how to be right when other
[1:57:45] no God give me your
[1:57:48] wisdom let me see how you can conduct
[1:57:52] yourself how you handle your word how
[1:57:54] you save your children how you share the
[1:57:57] gospel show me
[1:57:58] Lord what you want me to do with your
[1:58:04] word praise God let's all Stand
[1:58:10] Together may God grant you the spirit of
[1:58:12] wisdom and
[1:58:14] Revelation let's bow our heads together
[1:58:16] dear heavenly
[1:58:18] father Lord I'm so
[1:58:20] thankful that you wrote in your word you
[1:58:22] had your Apostle James to write it down
[1:58:25] so we wouldn't miss it that if we lack
[1:58:29] wisdom Lord that if we ask you that
[1:58:34] you'll give it to us
[1:58:36] liberally you unraid it not you'll give
[1:58:39] to him that
[1:58:41] ask God in your word you told us to seek
[1:58:45] after wisdom to get it to buy it not to
[1:58:51] sell it
[1:58:53] you told us it was the main thing the
[1:58:55] principal thing wisdom and
