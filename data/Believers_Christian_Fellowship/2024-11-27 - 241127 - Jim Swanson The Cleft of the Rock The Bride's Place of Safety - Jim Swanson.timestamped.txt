[17:38] since long before I was born amen he
[17:41] actually heard the message in
[17:43] 1964 and he was a Ministry student in
[17:47] the Seminary and gave all of that up
[17:49] when he heard the truth and so that part
[17:51] of the testimony just Thrills me I know
[17:53] he's been preaching this message for 60
[17:55] years and we just respect and honor
[17:57] those who have gone before us and
[17:58] appreciate so much the work that they've
[18:01] done and the constant seeing God's life
[18:03] and his dedication to the word so we're
[18:06] excited to have him come and we want him

[18:18] him to come at this time and just uh

[18:29] ful
[18:30] savior is
[18:33] Jesus my
[18:36] Lord a
[18:40] wonderful
[18:42] savior to
[18:45] [Music]
[18:47] me he
[18:50] hideth my soul in the
[18:56] glare of The Rock
[19:00] where
[19:02] rivers of
[19:05] pleasure I
[19:09] see
[19:10] oh he
[19:13] hideth my
[19:16] soul in the
[19:19] C of the
[19:22] rock that
[19:25] Shadows of dry
[19:29] [Music]
[19:33] thirsty oh
[19:36] he is my
[19:40] life in the
[19:42] depth of his
[19:50] love with
[19:56] his oh
[20:14] his good evening
[20:17] friends good to be in the house of the
[20:20] Lord tonight isn't
[20:21] it amen
[20:24] amen well I want to just say at the
[20:29] outset outset that I deem it a a
[20:33] wonderful great privilege to be standing
[20:35] here with the man that I have put such
[20:38] confidence and Trust in that he would
[20:40] open the pulpit for an old old Warrior
[20:44] and sometimes I think you know I guess
[20:48] I'm really young when you consider that
[20:50] Moses was 80 and Caleb and all of so I'm
[20:53] not too too old but I guess character is
[20:56] built on Victory not a gift anyway way
[20:58] and so that means I've been through some
[21:01] battles and uh I have to say this
[21:04] because the Lord has delivered me but
[21:06] yesterday I couldn't raise both of my
[21:08] arms like this don't know what it was
[21:11] pinched nerves or whatever I couldn't
[21:13] sleep I was like this all day this
[21:16] morning I got up and I said it's the day
[21:18] Lord so I'm just telling you tonight
[21:20] God's fixing to do something and that
[21:23] brother that's saying the Haven of Rest
[21:27] my message tonight is dealing with the
[21:30] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus through
[21:33] one
[21:34] thing and you know what that
[21:37] is the Clift of the rocken prise
[21:42] Lord God bless you as you take your
[21:45] Bibles
[21:55] tonight and this is a
[21:58] lead to the day what we call
[22:03] Thanksgiving am and I did some research
[22:06] before I came here tonight
[22:10] and brother Brandon preached in
[22:13] streetport Louisiana
[22:17] 1965
[22:19] 11:25 on the invisible
[22:23] Union and my friend's
[22:26] father Lyall Palmer was the song leader
[22:30] there at had passed just passed away
[22:33] when brother Brandon was there and I I
[22:35] think I put in a prayer request for his
[22:38] son which is brother Neil's wife had
[22:41] passed away sister kenlan so I have a
[22:45] real connection with him he happens to
[22:47] be a very very close friend of mine and
[22:50] uh brother Bram talked about brother
[22:52] Lyle his
[22:54] dad and so this is a special time for
[22:59] me and I'm thinking about Thanksgiving
[23:02] the word is give in the in that phrase
[23:07] Thanksgiving and it's really our duty
[23:09] and privilege to give thanks to the Lord
[23:12] for not just saving us and healing us
[23:16] but he's our sooncoming King and we are
[23:18] not we're not in a position probably
[23:22] naturally to understand everything but
[23:24] spiritually we know that we're the
[23:26] children and the invisible bride of
[23:28] Jesus Christ and we are expecting
[23:30] something miraculous to happen in our
[23:32] lives how many expect something we don't
[23:35] come to church for just an exercise and
[23:38] futility we come for one reason that's
[23:40] to hear from the Lord and if he can use
[23:43] me and use you together we're going to
[23:45] accomplish something for the
[23:46] kingdom wonderful
[23:49] wonderful so if you'll take your
[23:52] Bibles and turn to
[24:02] Hebrews Hebrews the first
[24:05] chapter and I have to say this to
[24:07] brother Chad
[24:09] that Sunday he took all my
[24:15] scriptures and I thought no he's not yep
[24:18] no he's not going to read yeah he did
[24:19] that one too four of
[24:22] them and it's not a humorous thing it's
[24:25] a very deep serious thing to me the
[24:28] reason I say deeply serious is God
[24:30] obviously wanted
[24:32] something to set us and and establish Us
[24:36] in the word so that we can receive a
[24:38] thought that he has wanted to give to
[24:42] us and then we'll have our
[24:45] seats Hebrews
[24:48] 1 God who at Sury times and in diverse
[24:51] manners spake in the time time pass
[24:54] under the fathers by the
[24:56] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[24:58] unto us by his son whom he hath
[25:02] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[25:06] also he made the worlds amen who being
[25:11] the brightness of his
[25:13] glory and the express image of his
[25:17] person and uphold All Things by the word
[25:21] of his power when he had by himself
[25:24] purged our sins sat down on the right
[25:28] hand of the Majesty on high amen let's
[25:35] pray Lord when we think this evening of
[25:39] the sacrifice you
[25:41] made sending
[25:43] your representative the very Son of God
[25:47] in the likeness of sinful flesh for
[25:50] brother Swanson
[25:51] tonight for everyone that's here we can
[25:55] claim that you died and you suffered for
[25:59] ourselves each one of us we thank you
[26:01] for that but Lord we want to go into
[26:04] your word and see the
[26:07] beautiful things that you have done in
[26:10] the prophet's lives and the Believers
[26:13] lives and how the Apostle Paul has in
[26:17] his writings has spoke so deeply to my
[26:19] heart because I know Lord It's Your word
[26:21] that is going forth help us tonight Lord
[26:25] to receive the revelation of what he is
[26:28] saying and may we understand by your
[26:33] grace and mercy that Faith cometh by
[26:35] hearing and hearing by the word Grant it
[26:38] Lord we pray in jesus' name
[26:41] amen God bless you you may take your
[26:49] seats it's a wonderful thing to be able
[26:54] to preach the gospel
[27:01] the gospel is the good news so there's
[27:04] nothing sad or depressing about the
[27:07] gospel and I remember years ago and dad
[27:11] would wait my stepfather would wait at
[27:14] the door for the morning paper that was
[27:17] back then probably better good news than
[27:20] it is
[27:21] today and he'd look at the things that
[27:25] had been going on in the world and he
[27:27] would take his cup of coffee and and
[27:30] read the the events and by doing that he
[27:33] kind of got a hand on the pulse of what
[27:36] was going on in the world but today is
[27:38] totally
[27:39] different very very few people get a
[27:42] newspaper very few people even
[27:45] understand what is actually happening in
[27:47] the world if you don't keep up with it
[27:49] you don't know really what's going
[27:52] on and because it's the good news and
[27:54] because God through his word has
[27:57] declared the news of the Gospel it's our
[28:02] privilege and Duty as Believers to
[28:05] declare the truth of the
[28:07] Gospel
[28:09] now I I'm going to go into something a
[28:12] little bit deep and I hope you're awake
[28:15] remember no work tomorrow it's
[28:18] Thanksgiving can I just say this when
[28:21] brother Chad would come back from
[28:22] overseas he he made the statement and I
[28:24] never forgot it he really went there for
[28:26] Fellowship you remember him saying that
[28:29] that's what we go when we my wife and I
[28:32] have gone overseas or the brothers have
[28:33] gone overseas it's it's not just to
[28:36] preach the gospel it's to Fellowship you
[28:37] want to know what the other believer is
[28:39] thinking and how they are responding and
[28:41] how they're living well I was thinking
[28:44] about that while I was still in sier
[28:47] Vista and
[28:49] uh the Electrical Company sent a little
[28:52] brochure out about what was happening in
[28:55] the in the area we're living in and you
[28:58] know that the elevation determines what
[29:00] kind of grapes should be grown whether
[29:02] it's in certain area of California or
[29:05] Idaho or Arizona or whatever and that
[29:07] elevation whatever it is 3,000 ft 4,000
[29:10] whatever it is they plant a particular
[29:14] grape and when Those Grapes
[29:16] mature remember every single grape has a
[29:19] seed in it and the seed is producing the
[29:23] very
[29:24] nature of what that grape is supposed to
[29:27] be and the vine is not getting much
[29:30] credit other than producing the grape
[29:32] they don't eat or drink the vine it is
[29:35] the grape that's produced well when I
[29:38] began to read that
[29:40] article I got pretty
[29:43] excited because the grapes when they are
[29:46] plucked off the
[29:47] vine years and years and years ago they
[29:50] were put in a
[29:51] vat and in the vat they would lay there
[29:55] until several men would come in and
[29:57] start stepping on
[29:59] them what was the purpose to get the
[30:02] flavor of the wine grape juice out of
[30:05] those
[30:05] grapes and so the article stated if you
[30:08] want to know what the the aroma the
[30:12] texture and the uh type of wine they
[30:17] have to go in with the skins on and rub
[30:20] shoulders in fellowship with one another
[30:22] and lose their identity so they can
[30:24] become the stimulated wine of Revelation
[30:27] so that's why we come together and we
[30:29] share one another's gospel together
[30:31] because we want to rub shoulders with it
[30:33] you see god with skin on it just like a
[30:36] grape it's got to have skin but that
[30:38] affects the flavor and the value and the
[30:40] aroma of that particular
[30:44] style of
[30:46] wine and that's true
[30:48] Fellowship so when we hear the word
[30:51] we're not josling with one another we're
[30:54] actually fellowshipping together and so
[30:57] we're thankful that there is a time of
[31:01] refreshing in the presence of the Lord
[31:03] aren't
[31:05] we I want to go into this just a little
[31:07] thought here that the Lord I'd like to
[31:10] entitle this
[31:11] message the Clift of The
[31:15] Rock and the subject the bride's place
[31:18] of
[31:19] safety I want you to turn if you would
[31:21] with me to the Song of
[31:23] Solomon Song of
[31:26] Solomon and uh see if we
[31:32] can get our basis here for what the lord
[31:36] has laid on my
[31:40] heart and you know you've got the
[31:43] bridegroom and the bride speaking but
[31:45] we're going to go in the first
[31:48] chapter verse
[31:51] 8 Song of
[31:53] Solomon chapter 2: 8 the voice of my
[31:57] beloved
[31:58] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[32:01] mountains skipping upon the
[32:04] hills my beloved is like a row or a
[32:07] young heart behold he standeth behind
[32:11] our wall he lookth forth at the windows
[32:15] showing himself through the
[32:17] lattice my beloved spake and said unto
[32:20] me rise up my love my fair one come away
[32:26] for Lo the winter is pass the rain is
[32:29] over and gone the flowers appear on the
[32:32] earth the time of the singing of birds
[32:34] is come and the voice of the turtle dove
[32:38] that's what turtle is there turtle dove
[32:40] is heard in our land the Fig Tree
[32:43] putteth forth her green figs and the
[32:46] vines with a tender grape give a good
[32:50] smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come
[32:55] away and here's our scripture oh my Dove
[33:00] Thou Art In The Cliffs of the
[33:04] rock why is a scripture talking about
[33:08] the Cliffs of the rock it's because when
[33:11] there's any large cataclysmic event the
[33:15] earthquakes or whatever and the Rocks
[33:18] split or get divided that makes a cliff
[33:22] there and if in the mountainous country
[33:24] that I'm from you can go up into the
[33:28] mountains where brother brandham talked
[33:30] and you can see the cleavage there at
[33:32] all the times something happened either
[33:34] an earthquake or a movement of the
[33:36] mountains and it opened up a
[33:39] cliff and that can be a a a result of a
[33:44] terrible blow or it can just be relaxing
[33:47] the Earth or it can be an earthquake and
[33:49] they'll split like that and that's what
[33:51] the scripture is talking about a Clift
[33:54] in the Rock I want you to notice
[33:57] something here in Hebrews the first
[33:59] chapter when I read Express image of his
[34:03] person now the exact meaning of that
[34:08] expressed image of his person it means
[34:12] exact expression of his
[34:15] substance so if there's a substance that
[34:17] God says
[34:19] faith faith is the substance there's
[34:22] something in that word substance that's
[34:25] connected to Faith and faith is is not
[34:28] something you can explain or Define
[34:30] faith is a
[34:32] revelation and so when faith in the
[34:34] scripture is being used it is being used
[34:36] for a reason to declare something that's
[34:40] in the Unseen World and because we
[34:43] believe that God comes by faith to the
[34:46] believer and you're saved by faith it
[34:48] says in the scripture for by grace are
[34:50] you saved through
[34:53] something through faith you can't go
[34:56] through those doors unless you to pass
[34:58] through them to get to the foyer you
[35:01] have to go through something in order to
[35:04] get saved you got to go through faith
[35:07] it's a real simple thing but it's a it's
[35:08] a part of of life it's part of the
[35:11] scriptures that's why the door is so in
[35:14] important in in in the scripture where
[35:18] Jesus said I am the door and so the door
[35:21] then becomes a
[35:22] passageway and because there is a
[35:25] through faith that not of yourself is a
[35:28] gift of God so faith is the gift of
[35:31] God not of
[35:33] works if it was works all the people in
[35:36] the denominations would be would be just
[35:38] full of faith and could believe or
[35:40] anything but it's not by works it's only
[35:42] by the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[35:44] personally that's how you're
[35:46] saved and it's the gift of faith and
[35:49] it's operating in this building right
[35:51] tonight if we can just latch on to it
[35:53] and with all of our hearts believe that
[35:55] what God has said will come to pass
[35:58] God is not willing that any should
[35:59] perish but it takes the faith of Jehovah
[36:02] to come on the scene through the
[36:04] preaching of the word to save them that
[36:06] believe and to heal those that have a
[36:09] need I want you to go with me if you
[36:11] would
[36:12] to Mark the 11th
[36:17] chapter we won't keep you long tonight
[36:20] as and I don't ever say that I I was
[36:22] telling I think brother Chad one time I
[36:23] was asked to give a testimony when I got
[36:26] got back from Africa and this brother in
[36:27] the church there out west said uh
[36:30] brother Jim you you I'll give you 10
[36:32] minutes and I thought what's 10 minutes
[36:35] what can you do in 10 minutes when you
[36:37] when youve traveled Halfway Around the
[36:38] World long ways around the world and so
[36:41] I got up and I honored it and I got down
[36:44] at 10 minutes and he come he said that's
[36:45] the first preacher that's ever kept his
[36:48] word I'm not going to do 10 minutes
[36:51] tonight but I might add a few tens on
[36:54] one 10 minute or whatever and not trying
[36:57] to be humorous I'm just saying when God
[36:59] has got something to deliver to the
[37:01] people you just might as well relax and
[37:04] say it's just old brother Jim but I've
[37:06] got a heart that's bursting inside I'm
[37:08] trying to hold down just a little bit
[37:11] here all right Mark 11th chapter we know
[37:15] the
[37:16] story
[37:18] and I want you to notice something that
[37:21] I never knew before and maybe maybe you
[37:24] have so just bear with me
[37:28] in Mark the 11th chapter after Jesus had
[37:30] cursed the fig tree verse 19 when even
[37:35] was come he went out of the city and in
[37:36] the morning as they passed by they saw
[37:40] the fig tree dried up from the
[37:42] roots and Peter calling to remembrance
[37:45] said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree
[37:49] which thou curs is withered away you
[37:53] think the Lord already knew that of
[37:55] course he did because he believed his
[37:56] own word amen and
[38:00] Jesus
[38:02] answering saith unto
[38:05] them now the King James version says
[38:09] have faith in God but the original Greek
[38:14] says have the faith which God gives it's
[38:18] a big difference the denominations can
[38:20] say we have faith in God but what about
[38:23] the faith that God gives there's your
[38:25] gift that's the gift of God it's not
[38:28] just a common state have faith in God
[38:31] have faith there's even songs wrote like
[38:33] that but if you have the faith that God
[38:36] gives it's
[38:39] Revelation now watch what our precious
[38:42] savior said for right after this
[38:46] statement have the faith that God gives
[38:48] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[38:52] shall say unto this
[38:54] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[38:57] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[38:59] heart but shall be believe that those
[39:02] things which he saith shall come to pass
[39:04] he shall have whatever he saith the word
[39:06] say is several times
[39:08] there brother Brandon you said you
[39:11] wanted three
[39:12] squirrels and you had to you said it I
[39:17] like what brother Ben said because God
[39:19] put it back on the man that said it if
[39:22] you want three squirrels it expect Three
[39:24] Squirrels if you want Divine Healing
[39:26] expect divine healing God's going to
[39:29] hold you to the word if you say you
[39:30] believe the
[39:33] word that's the cliff in the Rock
[39:35] folks that's your
[39:37] safety the word is your
[39:40] safety it doesn't matter what people say
[39:43] you know that you know that you know
[39:45] when God says something and you latch on
[39:46] to it and say by faith I believe what he
[39:49] said in his word doesn't have anything
[39:51] to do with somebody else believing or
[39:53] whatever it's you the Revelation has to
[39:56] come to you the prophet had it I don't
[39:58] care if the prophet had it the prophet
[40:00] can't save you or heal you God is the
[40:02] only one that could do it through the
[40:04] preaching of the Gospel the word of
[40:06] faith which we preach Paul said right
[40:09] isn't that a beautiful thing Paul
[40:11] actually called The Word of Faith which
[40:13] we preach did you know what the word of
[40:16] faith is it's Jesus
[40:18] Christ you can't be saved or healed by
[40:21] any other brother Brown said I didn't
[40:23] touch that sister she was in the in the
[40:26] congregation I never touched her Jesus
[40:28] touched her and she was healed and did
[40:31] you know there's also a power in the
[40:33] name amen and we'll read this in just a
[40:35] little bit if you have to go through the
[40:38] doors to get to another room that
[40:40] through is a passageway of Faith we'll
[40:44] read it in in in Acts the second and
[40:46] third chapter but here we've got
[40:48] something that Jesus is saying and
[40:50] brother Bram and I've got the quotes
[40:52] brother brandham said I puzzled about
[40:55] that for a long time I couldn't pre yet
[40:57] because the atonement hadn't been the
[40:59] calvary hadn't come yet and it's Jesus
[41:02] saying
[41:04] if which he saith shall come to pass he
[41:07] shall have whatsoever he saith in other
[41:10] words here is a little indication that
[41:13] the third poll is going to come in our
[41:16] day what is the third pole it's saying
[41:19] what you believe in your heart it's not
[41:22] something great that's only going to
[41:24] apply to the prophet it's every believer
[41:26] has got that ability when God reveals it
[41:28] to him you can say what you will you can
[41:31] believe what you must because God has
[41:33] ordained a Believer to receive the word
[41:35] and speak the word and it will come to
[41:38] pass why the word says it
[41:42] will the word says it will now verse 25
[41:48] and when you stand praying forgive if
[41:51] you have ought against any and that your
[41:53] father also which is in heaven May
[41:55] forgive you your your trespasses but if
[41:58] you do not forgive neither will your
[42:00] father which is in heaven forgive your
[42:02] trespasses and brother Bram said in the
[42:04] message perfect faith faith is based on
[42:09] forgiveness you cannot receive
[42:11] revelation of Faith until you have
[42:14] experienced
[42:16] forgiveness sometimes it's experience
[42:18] that you have to forgive yourself
[42:21] amen yeah we we have a hard time
[42:24] sometime forgiving ourselves we kick
[42:26] ourselves all around the block but we
[42:28] have to forgive you can't receive
[42:31] anything if there isn't forgiveness
[42:32] there you've got to forgive in order for
[42:35] God to come on the scene and Grant you
[42:37] perfect
[42:39] Faith
[42:41] Hallelujah now here we've
[42:44] got a word
[42:46] called image we read it in
[42:50] Hebrews exact
[42:53] image that word image is actually
[42:57] a Greek word that means
[43:00] character you look it up image one of
[43:04] the definitions for image is character
[43:07] but the character is speaking of there
[43:09] isn't the character that brother BR said
[43:11] is a
[43:12] victory this character the scripture is
[43:15] talking about is a tool of
[43:16] Engraving and it takes this is the
[43:19] definition of of image it takes this
[43:24] tool in the hands of an artisan to carve
[43:29] an image whether it's on a signate ring
[43:32] of a king so that he can plunge that
[43:34] into a wax seal there and they know
[43:37] there's only one Signet that has that
[43:39] image of the king and once it's sealed
[43:41] there they recognize that's
[43:43] Authority but this little tool called
[43:46] character is used to do an
[43:50] image so he is the expressed image of
[43:54] his person why did this scripture call
[43:58] Jesus the expressed image of his person
[44:01] because the image and the receiver the
[44:04] one that made the image and the one that
[44:06] received it are the same
[44:08] one when God stamps his faith in your
[44:12] soul you are God's you are God speaking
[44:17] it's not just a a figment of your
[44:19] imagination or maybe may maybe this
[44:21] maybe that it's actually life of Jesus
[44:24] Christ himself because God stamped his
[44:26] identity ification on your
[44:31] life and that
[44:33] image is called a character so I began
[44:37] to think about
[44:39] this character Hebrews 11:1 says faith
[44:43] is a
[44:45] substance so substance is something so
[44:51] real and it's actually another word for
[44:54] substance is confidence
[44:59] faith is the confidence do you think how
[45:03] God has faith in his
[45:06] word does God have faith in his own
[45:10] word to bring it to pass of course he
[45:13] does because he wrote the word he knows
[45:15] what it is he knows how to perform
[45:17] whatever is behind it if he says I am he
[45:20] that heals you then you can go to the
[45:22] bank on that he is the one to do
[45:25] it because he has faith in his own
[45:28] word he spake and it was done he
[45:31] commanded and it stood fast he wasn't
[45:34] like a lot of so-called Believers
[45:36] wishy-washy and well I don't know today
[45:38] if I'm going to be the one to heal
[45:40] anybody it's God himself is you can you
[45:45] can absolutely without a Shadow of Doubt
[45:47] believe what his word said because God
[45:49] said it and God is the author and
[45:51] finisher of our
[45:54] faith now
[45:59] if
[46:01] we're if we're
[46:04] expecting to have
[46:07] faith in Hebrews it says and and and I
[46:10] really appreciated what brother Chad had
[46:13] brought up and I'm going to make mention
[46:15] of this before
[46:17] but in the 11th chapter let me turn real
[46:20] quickly to that to Hebrews 11 again
[46:29] so here
[46:31] is here is the
[46:34] essence of the
[46:38] message I say that because in
[46:41] denomination
[46:42] we we did the best we could and I I
[46:46] brother Chad had mentioned that I was in
[46:47] the University there and studied and
[46:51] believed that I was going to be
[46:53] ministering in that denomination and it
[46:56] never worked out although I did for
[46:58] several years it never panned out
[47:00] because the message of this hour came my
[47:03] way now I'm going to get excited because
[47:06] what he said Sunday I Heard a
[47:10] Voice the voice was a
[47:12] tape now how in the world can a voice
[47:16] change a
[47:18] destiny of a of a brother that I was
[47:21] already in in the faith in
[47:24] denominational faith I never knew of a
[47:27] prophet all I knew was God was in his
[47:30] word and right now I want to give credit
[47:33] to my father-in-law which which uh I
[47:37] I've never done this publicly he uh he
[47:41] had some issues but I want to tell you
[47:43] one thing he was a Bible scholar and a
[47:45] Bible teacher in the denomination
[47:47] traveled all over the nation teaching
[47:49] the word the word of faith and it was my
[47:52] wife's father and and I in denomination
[47:55] i' never heard this before and so when
[47:58] when we'd have Bible studies in the
[47:59] basement of a little church there he
[48:01] kept teaching it and I I said my wife I
[48:04] said honey there's there's something
[48:05] about the word of faith what is that and
[48:08] being raised like she was and believing
[48:11] in what faith was she kept and we'd sit
[48:14] out now I got to confess something I had
[48:17] to sit out with her in front of the
[48:20] double doors of the university all night
[48:22] long talking the
[48:24] word and they take the flashlight and
[48:26] flash out there to see there they are
[48:28] sitting from each other in the front
[48:30] seat of this old 59 Chevy hard toop and
[48:34] all we could do is converse and I was
[48:36] getting so excited about what she was
[48:38] saying God Was preparing us no profit
[48:42] yet didn't know anything about William
[48:44] brandham and I was in my last year in '
[48:46] 64 last year to graduate and when the
[48:49] voice came it completely changed my life
[48:53] and I got a new understanding and a love
[48:55] for this right here that never had
[48:57] before brother Chad when you said you
[49:00] you have to smell I I go further than
[49:03] that I kiss my Bible all the time please
[49:05] don't misunderstand that but it's my
[49:07] life I can't even put anything on top of
[49:10] the Bible when it sits on the nightst or
[49:12] in my office it's real to me folks the
[49:15] word is
[49:17] real
[49:18] Hallelujah so if you thought that was
[49:21] that's a lot for a minister to say he
[49:22] has to smell but you know what that's
[49:24] really what a Believer does he gets so
[49:27] taken away with the beauty of the
[49:30] scriptures that he doesn't even hardly
[49:32] want to lay it
[49:35] down
[49:40] Hallelujah so I want you to go with me
[49:43] to the scriptures in the book of
[49:47] Acts after I'll come back to Hebrews
[49:50] here I want to try to hurry here and get
[49:53] some thoughts out good thing there's no
[49:55] clock I can't see it's in the dark
[50:02] here acts the second
[50:09] chapter first verse now Peter and John
[50:12] went up together into the temple at The
[50:15] Hour of Prayer being the ninth
[50:17] hour and a certain I love the when the
[50:19] scripture says a certain man a specific
[50:23] individual didn't even have to give him
[50:25] his name but he was a certain brother
[50:29] Brian preached M he be certain of God if
[50:31] you're certain you're special be certain
[50:35] of God and here a certain man laying
[50:38] from his mother's womb 40
[50:40] years was carried whom they laid daily
[50:44] at the Gate of the temple which is
[50:45] called Beautiful to ask arms of them
[50:47] that entered the temp
[50:49] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[50:51] to go into the Temple of course did what
[50:54] he did every day he asked for all
[50:57] s and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[51:01] with John said look on
[51:04] us
[51:06] and now ask I'm going to ask you
[51:08] something how did this happen how did
[51:11] Peter and John just came from the day of
[51:14] Pentecost in the upper room and he they
[51:15] come down and they they had to be
[51:17] charged with
[51:18] something is that right they were
[51:20] charged with something they they didn't
[51:22] go preach a long sermon they did I would
[51:25] they as far as We Know we don't even
[51:27] know if he said anything other than
[51:29] what's written right here what about the
[51:31] woman with the issue of blood she said
[51:33] in her heart if I can but touch the how
[51:35] did that come Faith came to her to do
[51:38] that might as well just say this faith
[51:41] is a
[51:42] revelation and the Centurion Jesus said
[51:45] I've not found so great a faith in all
[51:47] Israel when the son of man cometh will
[51:49] he find faith on the earth he found it
[51:51] right
[51:53] there is he finding it tonight in your
[51:55] soul in your heart do you know what real
[51:58] faith is to where you can lay everything
[52:00] aside and say I believe your word Lord
[52:03] Jesus reveal it more and more every day
[52:05] until there's nothing that'll stand in
[52:07] the way your your whole life will be
[52:10] cleansed you'll be a different person
[52:12] once you operate in the realm of Faith
[52:15] so here's Peter and
[52:17] John here they
[52:20] come and he said look on
[52:23] us then Peter said silver
[52:27] and Gold Have I None but such as I have
[52:30] I give unto thee here's the key in the
[52:35] name of
[52:37] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[52:41] walk 40 years this man had never had
[52:44] enough energy and strength in his legs
[52:47] or he wouldn't have been laying at the
[52:49] gate for 40 years now think of this now
[52:53] so just the words
[52:57] in the name of
[52:59] Jesus rise up and walk now there's a
[53:02] change coming amen there is a procedure
[53:06] that God uses through the mouth of a of
[53:09] a minister Little John and Peter the one
[53:12] that had failed Jesus so many times and
[53:14] the one that couldn't do this and
[53:15] couldn't do that now he's got the power
[53:17] to speak the word and a man he never
[53:19] even knew before who did he didn't have
[53:22] to preach a sermon to he takes him by
[53:24] the hand and lifts him up that is
[53:26] revelation from God alone man couldn't
[53:29] do that brother brah said I can't heal
[53:32] you Peter couldn't heal that man but he
[53:35] could believe the the the inward working
[53:38] of the Holy Ghost in his life had such
[53:40] power that whatever he touched in the
[53:43] name of Jesus motive and objective there
[53:45] you are whatever it is it would come to
[53:50] pass okay now let's look at this a
[53:54] minute
[53:56] and he leaping and he took him by the
[53:58] right hand and lifted him up and
[54:00] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[54:02] received
[54:04] strength now where did that come
[54:06] from God
[54:08] himself Peter didn't give him strength
[54:10] in his ankle bones Peter didn't have the
[54:13] power to do that but he had the power to
[54:15] believe that Jesus could do that so what
[54:18] he did is
[54:19] he he introduced the king of kings and
[54:23] Lord of lords the only one that could
[54:25] heal he introduced him and saying I in
[54:29] the name of Jesus rise up and walk and
[54:32] because there was so much Faith there he
[54:34] just left the day of Pentecost he he
[54:37] actually could take the man by the right
[54:40] hand and lift him up and what happens
[54:44] God honors the Act of
[54:46] Faith something happened to that man now
[54:49] I'm going to ask you if you were that
[54:50] man at the
[54:52] gate Callis and unable to move and
[54:56] atrophied muscles and couldn't even move
[54:58] your joints or whatever and somebody
[55:01] comes along a stranger and says I don't
[55:04] have any money to give you I guess maybe
[55:07] if you wait a little bit longer you'll
[55:08] get some more money but I don't even
[55:10] have any money I don't plan on getting
[55:12] any money but I do have something and
[55:14] you won't need any
[55:16] money you don't need any money because
[55:19] what I got will Ser Eed anything you
[55:21] could ever plan on well I need money for
[55:24] my bills what why don't you trust Jesus
[55:28] well I got I got to get another car
[55:30] trust the Lord I'm just thought now
[55:32] brother Franco his daddy was baptized by
[55:35] a friend of mine in Italy brother
[55:38] Franco's father was baptized by Brother
[55:41] Mariano how many know or heard ever
[55:44] heard of brother
[55:45] Mariano where's Sister Amy she's
[55:47] probably up there I don't know where she
[55:49] is yep she's all right I was in his home
[55:53] God don't tell me that God can't come on
[55:55] the scene for you
[55:57] especially in in a realm of Faith like
[56:00] we have tonight so I was talking to
[56:02] brother Mariano oh I said brother Jim
[56:04] with my children my family it's so hard
[56:06] to make against me and he said I just
[56:08] went before the Lord remember now when
[56:10] you pray in faith God hears any prayer
[56:13] you pray you don't have to keep going
[56:15] back to him and saying I'm going to come
[56:17] over again in front and have them pray
[56:19] for me you've done it once and you
[56:21] believe you don't keep coming brother BR
[56:22] said don't do that the only thing that
[56:25] brings you up the second or third time
[56:27] is unbelief God can't honor unbelief he
[56:30] can only honor faith and so brother
[56:32] Mario say I just bariano said I just
[56:36] prayed it wasn't very long he knew
[56:39] exactly what he
[56:41] needed there was a knock at the door and
[56:45] this this knock turned into to be a
[56:52] priest now he had left the Catholic
[56:54] church so now he opened the door to this
[56:57] priest I don't know how I could tell you
[56:59] this sir but he said I was in
[57:03] prayer and the Lord told me to come here
[57:06] and give you
[57:09] $1,200 that's from his lips to my ear
[57:13] $1,200 now what would you do if somebody
[57:16] walked up and said I'm going to give you
[57:18] 1,200 well think of this man at the gate
[57:20] beautiful somebody said I've got
[57:22] something for you you weren't even
[57:23] expecting especially from a Catholic
[57:26] priest how in the world could he be
[57:28] letter of the Lord let me tell you folks
[57:31] you got I ever out guess God you're
[57:33] going to try to say it's all impossible
[57:35] it's never
[57:36] impossible and that's why we have to be
[57:38] it's impossible to please him if we're
[57:41] not walking by faith there's a
[57:44] impossibility and so it was just a few
[57:46] months later he said brother Jim there
[57:49] we were the church is real small we
[57:51] couldn't make it and I got on my knees
[57:54] again I said Lord you know our need
[57:58] you know what's going to happen there
[57:59] was a knock at the door again and a
[58:02] little sister Catholic from the church
[58:03] said I don't even understand it or
[58:05] explain it but he needed $1,800 she said
[58:09] the Lord told me to come and give you
[58:13] this thank you Lord you better hold on
[58:16] cuz I'm fixing to tell you something
[58:17] better than that even it's about
[58:20] me I don't this is not a joking time
[58:24] this is reality folks amen I had a
[58:27] little I'm I'm looking at Brother David
[58:30] down there the diesel mechanic and so he
[58:32] he can smile if he wants but he knows
[58:34] what what Chevrolet Diesel with a
[58:38] Allison Transmission is you you know all
[58:40] that so and it had not a whole lot of
[58:43] miles on it and I was meetings up in
[58:46] Flagstaff and so to save a little money
[58:49] I had a little camp trailer and I hooked
[58:51] on and I'd go up the mountain it's about
[58:54] 6 hours from where we lived and
[58:57] I couldn't get up the mountain they just
[58:59] pull off P kept pulling off and you know
[59:02] whizzing all the traffic going there and
[59:05] finally a highway patrolman bless his
[59:07] heart he come by he saids sir can I help
[59:09] you and I said not really I said unless
[59:13] there's a tow truck somewhere he said oh
[59:15] you're way up in no man's land there's
[59:17] no truck here you take him an hour and a
[59:18] half or two hours to get here can I help
[59:21] you and I said well I just don't want to
[59:23] be hit by the traffic he said well I'll
[59:26] watch well watching can't provide any
[59:29] security or safety he all he could do is
[59:31] just see so he went way up I never did
[59:34] see him again but I thanked him and I
[59:37] limped along and i' sit at the side and
[59:39] i' limp and go another few miles some
[59:41] sometimes it only 200 ft and I thought
[59:44] oh my I finally got up there and I said
[59:47] the first thing I'm going to do is make
[59:48] sure that I have this checked out cuz it
[59:51] happened before so I found a General
[59:55] Motors diesel mechanic that knew
[59:58] those Motors inside out and so I took it
[1:00:02] in to him and he went through the whole
[1:00:04] thing he said I've never been stumped
[1:00:07] but he said I'm stumped I don't know
[1:00:09] what's wrong and of course I paid
[1:00:12] handsomely to get it to get that answer
[1:00:15] can't do anything and he lived about
[1:00:19] maybe a block from the
[1:00:21] highway so I said well Dave I said um
[1:00:26] I've got to get back to see our Vista so
[1:00:28] uh thank you he said I'm sorry I he had
[1:00:31] it for days and days he tried everything
[1:00:33] I was in the shop with him and because I
[1:00:35] did some mechanicing I was helping and
[1:00:38] we were trying to figure out now I'm
[1:00:39] laying a groundwork for something here
[1:00:42] how many remember what brother Chris
[1:00:44] Steak
[1:00:46] said is there anybody that disbelieves
[1:00:49] what he
[1:00:50] said it actually happened
[1:00:53] folks so I'm getting ready
[1:00:57] hope I don't cry but I'm getting ready
[1:00:59] to go
[1:01:00] home and being alone and not having my
[1:01:03] precious wife with me it gets kind of
[1:01:06] lonely you know when you're traveling
[1:01:08] yourself and I I get Melancholy it's all
[1:01:12] right that's the way we're we're made
[1:01:14] and so uh that's why I want to thank you
[1:01:16] all for being so lovely to my family and
[1:01:21] embracing us and we're here I can't I
[1:01:24] thought Thanksgiving I got to tell
[1:01:25] everybody I love him and I can't I've
[1:01:27] never been treated like this in my life
[1:01:29] never ever ever and Fa and deric will
[1:01:31] agree with that also back to the story
[1:01:34] so I leave his shop and I don't even get
[1:01:38] to the road a walk away and she dies it
[1:01:41] dies so I said well I called him on the
[1:01:45] phone he said how far did you get I said
[1:01:48] look out your
[1:01:49] window there I'm sitting on the side of
[1:01:51] the road again without the trailer
[1:01:53] hooked up just the pickup and I said I
[1:01:56] said Dave I I don't really know what to
[1:01:58] do I don't think I can get 6 hours
[1:02:00] through mountains and that getting home
[1:02:02] and he said I'm sorry there's not a
[1:02:04] thing I can do you could take it to a
[1:02:06] dealer and he he'll find the same thing
[1:02:09] because I was a a mechanic for the
[1:02:11] dealership so I limp back to the RV
[1:02:14] place where I had the trailer parked and
[1:02:16] I hooked
[1:02:18] on Services were over it was time to go
[1:02:22] home and you know sometimes you quiet
[1:02:24] yourself and you say Lord why do these
[1:02:26] things
[1:02:27] happen what what's the purpose of this I
[1:02:30] mean I I took care of everything it
[1:02:33] wasn't like I it was rough or anything
[1:02:36] and uh while I'm sitting
[1:02:38] there in the truck hooked up ready to go
[1:02:42] I said well if I fail to do it I'll
[1:02:45] probably just have to park it on the
[1:02:47] side and get some kind of a tow truck to
[1:02:49] pull all these miles up the mountain
[1:02:56] so I sat in the truck and I looked out
[1:03:00] the
[1:03:01] windshield I said you know every
[1:03:03] component that's in this truck every
[1:03:06] component that's in this tree this
[1:03:08] evergreen tree I see out here everything
[1:03:11] that's in this shed that's with wood it
[1:03:13] all came from the Creator there isn't
[1:03:16] one thing that man has created he might
[1:03:20] have brought the elements together but
[1:03:22] he didn't create it and I laid my hands
[1:03:25] on that steering wheel and I said Lord
[1:03:27] Jesus give me the faith cuz it's a gift
[1:03:31] to believe all things are possible to
[1:03:33] him that believeth and folks I'm going
[1:03:35] to tell you I laid my hands on it it
[1:03:39] started I never had a bobble all the way
[1:03:42] home and I pulled it in there and that
[1:03:44] was to me an answer to prayer but Faith
[1:03:47] does that to a
[1:03:48] Believer if you really want to know what
[1:03:51] faith does just ask somebody that's had
[1:03:53] it happened to them they know beyond
[1:03:55] shadow of a doubt that Faith answers
[1:03:57] questions that the devil throws at you
[1:03:59] all the time why why faith is a
[1:04:02] substance of things H for it's not that
[1:04:06] we hope hope is excitement that we're
[1:04:08] going to come into something that's what
[1:04:10] substance is things hope for we want we
[1:04:13] expect something now brother BR said
[1:04:15] hope can be the worst what enemy that
[1:04:18] face God but when it says faith is a
[1:04:21] substance of things hoped for that means
[1:04:22] the substance is putting you in a
[1:04:24] position to expect expect something that
[1:04:26] kind of Hope brother Chad is
[1:04:28] expectation and the word is expecting
[1:04:31] you to expect something in your
[1:04:34] life oh help us Lord see this to the
[1:04:39] Centurion I have not found so great a
[1:04:42] faith in all Israel what did he have
[1:04:44] that nobody else had he had the revealed
[1:04:48] word that he could say Lord just speak
[1:04:51] the word that's right just speak the
[1:04:55] word
[1:04:57] Amen Let me just try to I haven't even
[1:05:00] got in my message yet but I Lord
[1:05:03] impressed me to say this and I want to
[1:05:04] just finish this so you know what
[1:05:06] happened with all then he walked around
[1:05:08] praising the Lord and felt so wonderful
[1:05:10] getting his new legs you know the time
[1:05:13] the policeman saw this man running out
[1:05:15] and he chasing him and chasing him and
[1:05:17] chasing him and the man was just out
[1:05:19] running and finally he caught him he
[1:05:21] says sir what's the matter oh not a
[1:05:23] thing I'm just trying out my new legs
[1:05:26] because God had just healed him he
[1:05:28] didn't have to check with a with a
[1:05:30] constable and say is it all right if I
[1:05:32] run let me tell you when that woman
[1:05:33] brought her shoes up she knew that she
[1:05:36] was going to put those new shoes on
[1:05:37] because Jesus Christ made her
[1:05:39] well and how about the woman that had
[1:05:41] the bad knees Hallelujah brother B can I
[1:05:45] bow down and on my knees certainly
[1:05:47] sister you can she believed what the
[1:05:49] word said and she was healed right there
[1:05:52] am now
[1:05:56] it goes on just a little bit verse 16
[1:05:58] and his name this is Peter first he said
[1:06:02] Peter saw it he answer the people why
[1:06:04] you Israel Marvel at this verse 12 why
[1:06:07] you look so earnestly on us is it
[1:06:09] through our own prayer or Holiness we
[1:06:10] made this man walk it wasn't us and yet
[1:06:13] it was
[1:06:14] them they didn't have the power to do it
[1:06:17] without God giving them the power and
[1:06:19] but they recognize it wasn't them doing
[1:06:22] it because they didn't have any power to
[1:06:23] do it but God did it to of
[1:06:26] vessel when brother Chad preaches a word
[1:06:29] there ought to be something happened
[1:06:30] inside of every believer he said that
[1:06:32] ain't nothing but the truth and it'll
[1:06:34] change
[1:06:35] lives absolutely change
[1:06:40] lives and verse 16 and his name through
[1:06:44] faith in his name hath made this man
[1:06:46] strong whom you see and know yay the
[1:06:49] faith which is by him hath given him
[1:06:54] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:06:56] of you all perfect soundness he didn't
[1:06:58] have anything as far as a sound body at
[1:07:01] all so what happened creative Power by
[1:07:06] the very word of God changed that
[1:07:08] to a man had perfect
[1:07:11] soundness he didn't have to worry about
[1:07:14] going to the gate and asking for alms
[1:07:15] anymore he didn't have to worry what
[1:07:17] people said or looked at him he had
[1:07:19] something more real than any OLS could
[1:07:22] ever
[1:07:24] buy but we're not not done yet now we go
[1:07:27] over to chapter 4 verse
[1:07:31] 10 verse 8 I'm sorry then Peter filled
[1:07:34] with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:36] Hallelujah and said unto them ye rulers
[1:07:39] of the people and Elders of Israel if we
[1:07:41] this day be examined of the good deed
[1:07:43] done to the impotent Man by what means
[1:07:47] he is made
[1:07:48] whole be it known unto you all and to
[1:07:52] all the people of Israel that by and
[1:07:55] that also word means in by the name of
[1:07:59] Jesus of Nazareth whom you crucified
[1:08:02] whom God raised from the dead even by or
[1:08:05] in him does make this man stand here
[1:08:10] before you oh he was
[1:08:14] whole so there had to be
[1:08:17] something that
[1:08:20] happens oh help me Lord help
[1:08:23] me Hallelujah
[1:08:27] now there's a song I asked brother Ben
[1:08:30] to to sing before I came out and that
[1:08:34] was written by Fanny
[1:08:36] Crosby many many years
[1:08:41] ago a
[1:08:43] wonderful savior is Jesus my Lord he
[1:08:47] hideth my soul in the Clift of the
[1:08:52] rock now if you go with me
[1:08:56] we're going to
[1:08:57] see speaking the word does Peter did it
[1:09:01] now we're going to see it
[1:09:03] happen and and and fenny Crosby is doing
[1:09:06] it through her music and we're going to
[1:09:09] see that in Exodus the 30 so if you'll
[1:09:13] if you'll go to Exodus the 33rd chapter
[1:09:15] and also numbers 20
[1:09:17] let's let's get onto my message this
[1:09:22] evening numbers 20 and
[1:09:34] yes let's do numbers 21
[1:09:41] please verse one then came the children
[1:09:44] of Israel even the whole congregation
[1:09:46] into the desert of Zen in the first
[1:09:48] month and the people Abode in Kadesh and
[1:09:51] Miriam died there who was buried there
[1:09:58] and there was no water verse Two for the
[1:10:02] congregation and they gathered
[1:10:04] themselves together against Moses and
[1:10:05] against Aaron and the people chowed with
[1:10:08] Moses and spake saying would God that we
[1:10:10] had died when our Brethren died before
[1:10:12] the Lord and why have you brought us up
[1:10:15] the congregation of the Lord into this
[1:10:18] Wilderness that we and our cattle should
[1:10:20] die here murmurers unbelievers all right
[1:10:25] and wherefore have ye made us to come up
[1:10:28] out of Egypt to bring us into this evil
[1:10:31] place it is no place of seed or figs of
[1:10:35] vines or of pomegranates neither is
[1:10:37] there any water to
[1:10:44] drink and Moses and Aaron went from the
[1:10:48] presence of the assembly onto the door
[1:10:50] of the Tabernacle of the
[1:10:53] congregation and they fell upon their
[1:10:56] faces and the glory of the Lord appeared
[1:10:59] unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:11:02] saying take the
[1:11:04] rod now remember the rod was a rod rod
[1:11:08] of
[1:11:11] judgment and the Bible says spare the
[1:11:14] rod and spoil the
[1:11:16] child that means the Judgment must start
[1:11:20] in the
[1:11:22] home and God is going to hold the
[1:11:25] parents responsible if they don't do
[1:11:28] judgment in a right kind loving way but
[1:11:31] it still has to be
[1:11:33] done because brother brandom said that's
[1:11:35] the Judgment Rod of
[1:11:37] God all right I'm we
[1:11:42] finish and Moses went in and they fell
[1:11:45] upon their faces and the glory of the
[1:11:47] Lord appeared unto them and the Lord
[1:11:49] spake unto Moses and said take the rod
[1:11:52] gather thou the assembly together thou
[1:11:54] and Aaron th brother and
[1:11:56] speak ye unto the rock before their eyes
[1:12:02] and it shall give forth his water and
[1:12:05] thou shalt bring forth to
[1:12:09] them water out of the rock so Thou shalt
[1:12:13] give the
[1:12:14] congregation and their beasts drink and
[1:12:18] mo Moses took the rod from before the
[1:12:21] Lord and
[1:12:23] Moses gathered the
[1:12:26] congregation together before the Rock
[1:12:29] and he said unto them here now ye Rebels
[1:12:33] rebellious ones must we fetch you water
[1:12:36] out of this rock you notice he took it
[1:12:38] on
[1:12:40] himself God never said you're going to
[1:12:42] do it he said you just take the rod and
[1:12:46] speak to the Rock but he interpreted you
[1:12:50] see how influences affect a person he
[1:12:54] called him Reb re because they were
[1:12:56] Rebels rebellious but they actually
[1:12:59] affected his
[1:13:01] Revelation it they affected his faith
[1:13:03] because he was in a no way shape or form
[1:13:06] able to do that but look watch now what
[1:13:09] happened and the
[1:13:11] Lord and Moses lifted up his hand verse
[1:13:15] 11 and with his Rod he smokee The Rock
[1:13:19] twice brother Bram said he did it once
[1:13:22] and nothing happened so he did it again
[1:13:25] he should have realized when they did it
[1:13:27] the first time that nothing happened he
[1:13:30] was
[1:13:34] wrong and the water and he lifted up
[1:13:36] with his Rod smoked the rock twice and
[1:13:38] the water came out abundantly and the
[1:13:40] congregation drank and their beasts also
[1:13:42] and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:13:45] Aaron because ye believed me
[1:13:49] not look at this this unbelief what have
[1:13:53] caused Moses because thou believe me not
[1:13:57] to sanctify me not in your eyes but in
[1:14:01] the eyes of the children of Israel
[1:14:04] therefore ye shall not bring this
[1:14:05] congregation into the land which I have
[1:14:07] given them in other words he died before
[1:14:10] he went to the land just because he
[1:14:12] listened and was influenced by
[1:14:16] doubt he didn't obey the Lord he didn't
[1:14:18] speak to him he struck the rock what
[1:14:20] does it mean it means that he was
[1:14:22] crucifying the Lord again even though
[1:14:25] God had never even put Christ on the
[1:14:28] cross it was a type that the second time
[1:14:30] he did it he was crucifying the Lord of
[1:14:33] glory amen I want to show you something
[1:14:35] here it's very very
[1:14:39] beautiful now let's go
[1:14:42] to to Exodus 33
[1:14:59] and verse
[1:15:02] 20 and he said thou cast not see my face
[1:15:06] for there shall no man see me and
[1:15:12] live but Moses wanted to see
[1:15:15] him all right and the Lord said behold
[1:15:19] there is a
[1:15:20] place by me and thou shalt
[1:15:25] shall stand upon upon a rock and it
[1:15:30] shall come to pass while my glory passes
[1:15:33] by that I will put thee in the Cliff of
[1:15:38] The Rock and will cover thee with my
[1:15:42] hand while I pass
[1:15:45] by and I will take away mine hand and
[1:15:48] thou shalt see my back Parts but my face
[1:15:52] shall not be seen and brother Bram said
[1:15:55] he took on an image of Flesh just like
[1:15:59] MDC and that is what Moses saw because
[1:16:02] no man has seen God at any time the only
[1:16:05] begotten has declared him so I have to
[1:16:07] add that real quick because that's what
[1:16:11] what Thomas said I won't believe unless
[1:16:13] I put my hands in he said blessed are th
[1:16:16] but it's better to believe without
[1:16:17] seeing than seeing so if you see the
[1:16:21] word and nobody agrees with you that's
[1:16:23] better you see it anyway because that's
[1:16:24] what God is wanting you believe without
[1:16:28] seeing think of this now just for a
[1:16:30] moment you can believe the word by the
[1:16:33] Revelation that Jesus Christ is real
[1:16:35] just like Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[1:16:38] the son of the Living God and Jesus said
[1:16:40] upon the rock Revelation I'm going to
[1:16:42] build my church so this rock is
[1:16:44] important All Through the
[1:16:47] Bible and there's a Clift in the
[1:16:49] Rock there I just read it here the Clift
[1:16:52] in the Rock so now I want to read what
[1:16:54] the prophet said and we're going to try
[1:16:56] to get into a few thoughts here but
[1:16:59] before I do I want to say this remember
[1:17:03] in Book of Genesis it said God said let
[1:17:05] there be
[1:17:06] light how many know that let there be
[1:17:09] light in other words allow it to happen
[1:17:12] whatever it takes whatever is going on
[1:17:13] in that other realm of faith and God
[1:17:16] believing his own word and he said let
[1:17:19] there be allow it to happen take any
[1:17:21] restrictions away or whatever let there
[1:17:24] be light amen do you believe there was
[1:17:26] light yes sir watch what the prophet
[1:17:29] said God
[1:17:32] said they know okay they read it they
[1:17:35] can see the glory of God and things like
[1:17:37] that it's just a word to them but to us
[1:17:41] let there be light is a manifestation
[1:17:44] that's right see it is no more a
[1:17:48] word it's a reality oh get this tonight
[1:17:53] when he said let there be life it didn't
[1:17:55] matter if there's no way anybody could
[1:17:57] prove it but the manifestation was light
[1:18:01] and once he said let there be light
[1:18:03] there was light here's what he said this
[1:18:06] is the veiling of God he said God said
[1:18:08] let there be light that was the word but
[1:18:12] now there is light it ain't the word
[1:18:15] anymore it's light
[1:18:18] yes oh I got to say that again once he
[1:18:21] establish the fact that there's going to
[1:18:23] be light he doesn't have to keep saying
[1:18:24] saying
[1:18:25] it once he says you're healed in Jesus
[1:18:28] name he doesn't have to keep saying it
[1:18:30] you're going to accept the light or
[1:18:32] you're not going to accept it it doesn't
[1:18:34] matter if you accept it it's still true
[1:18:36] and he doesn't have to keep saying let
[1:18:37] there be let let there be let there be
[1:18:39] healing let there he already did it it's
[1:18:42] up to you to receive it if you can
[1:18:44] receive the word like you can the
[1:18:46] sunlight and the and the stars and
[1:18:47] whatever you can surely believe that
[1:18:50] when God said you are healed in Jesus
[1:18:52] name you are going to be healed
[1:18:56] Hallelujah I had to say that I was just
[1:18:59] waiting for
[1:19:01] that now he said but what if I would say
[1:19:05] it just in
[1:19:06] myself nothing will happen let there be
[1:19:09] this let be that he said if I was doing
[1:19:11] it myself nothing would happen but he
[1:19:15] said I would but what if I would say it
[1:19:18] like that but they say it's a you're a
[1:19:22] hypocrite but if I ever tell you to get
[1:19:24] up out of that wheelchair for you're
[1:19:27] going to get up there's one thing sure
[1:19:30] if you don't you wouldn't mind me you
[1:19:32] might never leave the spot where you're
[1:19:34] at but you can only do what God shows
[1:19:37] you to do but I can declare get up out
[1:19:40] of that
[1:19:42] wheelchair you know the you know the
[1:19:45] testimony of my wife when she's just a
[1:19:47] young girl and she worked in the fields
[1:19:49] with the Mexicans and picking potatoes
[1:19:52] and whatever and she got got real sick
[1:19:56] and she was a straight A student in
[1:19:58] school and she couldn't she had no
[1:20:00] strength to go to school and her dad my
[1:20:04] father-in-law an Assembly of God teacher
[1:20:07] believed the word and he said
[1:20:12] Jean I'm going to pray for you amen and
[1:20:15] I'm going to ask the Lord to heal you
[1:20:17] cuz he's already done it 2,000 years ago
[1:20:20] but I want you to receive it by faith
[1:20:23] sure Dad sure you know she's miserable
[1:20:25] sick so he went in and prayed for her
[1:20:28] left the room come back 5 minutes he
[1:20:30] says what are you doing and she said all
[1:20:32] snuggle up in her her Afghan or whatever
[1:20:35] it is she says I prayed for you what are
[1:20:38] you doing in
[1:20:40] bed and this this is way the way my wife
[1:20:43] was
[1:20:46] raised lying vanities can take away all
[1:20:49] the faith that God might have shown you
[1:20:51] because you're going to believe you're
[1:20:52] still
[1:20:53] sick but if you follow the word and act
[1:20:55] on the word faith is an action it's an
[1:20:58] active verb so she said well well I I I
[1:21:02] said you believe when Dad prayed for you
[1:21:04] you were going to be healed well yes but
[1:21:06] Dad I don't I don't care how you feel
[1:21:09] you're either going to stand in the word
[1:21:10] or stay
[1:21:13] sick that's my wife don't you see why we
[1:21:17] I was thinking about elaser he didn't
[1:21:20] know I know when I looked at my
[1:21:23] little Rebeca she wasn't Rebecca it was
[1:21:25] Jean but when I looked at her I had such
[1:21:27] love for her I said when you are ready
[1:21:30] I'm going to take you home elaser said
[1:21:32] the same thing to Rebecca and he took
[1:21:34] her home to
[1:21:35] Isaac that was my love for that little
[1:21:38] girl I had that love why because it was
[1:21:41] the word that was manifest in her I saw
[1:21:44] that and together we enjoyed the
[1:21:46] blessing of the Prophet hearing that
[1:21:48] little tape in our apartment in
[1:21:50] Minneapolis I said no I didn't know
[1:21:52] anything about William brandom I didn't
[1:21:54] know all the tapes but we got a hold of
[1:21:56] 1 7in re to reel and I just said there's
[1:21:59] nothing I've ever heard like the voice
[1:22:02] of that man and bald and sat there and
[1:22:04] cried you've heard it I know and cried
[1:22:06] and cried and cried and said Lord Jesus
[1:22:09] so this is what I've been asking for so
[1:22:11] this is the truth that's why
[1:22:13] denominations are
[1:22:18] wrong whatsoever things you desire When
[1:22:21] you pray believe you receive them and it
[1:22:24] shall be given you is that right verily
[1:22:27] verily I say unto you if you say now
[1:22:29] that's here's the spoken word now if you
[1:22:32] say to this mountain in your heart be
[1:22:36] cast plucked up and Cast Away and don't
[1:22:39] doubt it but believing that those things
[1:22:41] will come to pass you'll have whatsoever
[1:22:44] brother Braham
[1:22:46] said whatever I say oh it must be wrong
[1:22:49] it must be what Jesus said
[1:22:51] no Jesus said whatever you say amen God
[1:22:55] so brother Brandon you said you wanted
[1:22:57] Three
[1:22:58] Squirrels isn't God precious and and
[1:23:01] just so willing to to do whatever we
[1:23:04] want not to people that don't like
[1:23:06] squirrel meat or don't like shooting
[1:23:08] animals that's one thing but the prophet
[1:23:11] said i' let there be one over there and
[1:23:12] live and the farmers over there and then
[1:23:14] and we be there and then then he got two
[1:23:17] and that was good enough and he went how
[1:23:19] many appreciate what brother Bren said
[1:23:20] about that you know what it comes down
[1:23:22] to thus sayith the Lord
[1:23:25] he actually spoke those squirrels in
[1:23:29] existence because God gave him that
[1:23:31] ability to he didn't create the
[1:23:33] squirrels brother brand didn't create
[1:23:35] them God did but he used a human vessel
[1:23:39] called a
[1:23:40] voice it spoke the word and squirrels
[1:23:44] came into
[1:23:47] existence don't you think he can heal my
[1:23:50] body or your body if he could do that
[1:23:53] for a prophet he's one wanting to see
[1:23:55] there's the third pole speaking the word
[1:23:57] back you have to prove his word in your
[1:24:01] life oh help us
[1:24:05] Lord here a little
[1:24:08] story brother Bram talks about Smith
[1:24:10] Wigglesworth and I I love some of the
[1:24:12] things that he said but one thing
[1:24:14] there's a little story he read he had a
[1:24:16] little granddaughter named
[1:24:18] April and little April helped her
[1:24:21] Grandpa brother Wigglesworth in meetings
[1:24:24] and getting things ready and everything
[1:24:26] and he thought a lot about her and he
[1:24:28] thought well I've saved enough money now
[1:24:31] I want to give her a gift how many heard
[1:24:33] this story maybe maybe you have give her
[1:24:35] a little gift so he took her to a
[1:24:38] beautiful jewelry
[1:24:39] store and he he didn't want to choose it
[1:24:42] for her but he noticed that she didn't
[1:24:46] have a watch and she looked at these
[1:24:48] watches these gorgeous beautiful diamond
[1:24:51] encrusted watches and she he could he
[1:24:54] was standing at his side and he could
[1:24:55] just see that oh little girls like shiny
[1:24:59] things they like little things like that
[1:25:01] and here she's looking at that and then
[1:25:04] just kind of sagged a little bit and
[1:25:07] kept going down the line until she got
[1:25:08] to the cheapest ugliest little watch
[1:25:10] there in the jewelry
[1:25:12] store and brother Smith was looking at
[1:25:15] her and he thought
[1:25:18] oh and so
[1:25:20] she went up there and he paid for it and
[1:25:23] he said honey
[1:25:27] you really sadden me why
[1:25:31] Grandpa it's just like when God gives
[1:25:34] you a gift he gives you the best he's
[1:25:37] got amen and you took you thought well
[1:25:40] grandpa I thought because I said he said
[1:25:42] that's the problem God will bankrupt
[1:25:46] heaven for you so when you ask of God
[1:25:49] ask believing and he's going to give you
[1:25:51] the best that you've ever had before
[1:25:55] I was telling a brother the other day I
[1:25:57] said if you are invited to a house and
[1:26:00] you know behind that door is a million
[1:26:03] dollars in gold bullion sitting there
[1:26:06] and all you have to do is open the
[1:26:09] door I said the exite the excitement
[1:26:12] starts before you ever enter that
[1:26:14] room but you got to go through something
[1:26:17] to reach that gift and the gift of faith
[1:26:20] is like that it isn't up to you whether
[1:26:23] you're good bad or indiffer it's whether
[1:26:25] the preaching of the word of faith which
[1:26:27] we preached Paul said enables you to
[1:26:29] believe God and then God grants that
[1:26:32] gift and whatever you have I don't care
[1:26:34] if it's heart trouble or whatever God is
[1:26:37] able to deliver you even as you're
[1:26:39] sitting and brother Bosworth Would S
[1:26:41] just start preaching or just teaching
[1:26:43] the word sitting in a stool and the
[1:26:45] people were healed right there he said I
[1:26:47] never touched them but he built the word
[1:26:49] of faith in their hearts to where they
[1:26:50] could receive what they had need of
[1:26:55] Hallelujah
[1:26:58] now let me go into something
[1:27:03] that that I
[1:27:06] hope helps you should I look at the
[1:27:10] clock oh
[1:27:13] my I might have to just wait on the rest
[1:27:17] of it brother Chad it's getting late and
[1:27:18] I I've got something on my heart I want
[1:27:20] to say so I want to get in the the Clift
[1:27:23] of the rock so bad but you
[1:27:28] know the reason there was a cliff
[1:27:31] brother Bram said is
[1:27:33] because when Moses struck the
[1:27:37] rock it took a divot or a piece of that
[1:27:40] rock
[1:27:42] out and that is why there was a cliff of
[1:27:45] The Rock and the Cliff of the rock Fanny
[1:27:48] Crosby wrote this song There was Honey
[1:27:51] in the Rock that's where the bees would
[1:27:53] make their honey was in that cliff and
[1:27:55] that Cliff of the rock became more than
[1:27:58] just an impression or a depression in
[1:28:01] the rock it actually it actually
[1:28:04] occurred because of unbelief and when
[1:28:07] Jesus bore your sins and your sorrows
[1:28:10] and your wounds you were in him when he
[1:28:12] did that amen and the only way that you
[1:28:15] can get revelation of that listen to me
[1:28:17] tonight is that you are actually part of
[1:28:20] the wound that he suffered for your sake
[1:28:23] and and then I read out of this this uh
[1:28:26] song of salmon you actually have to
[1:28:28] crawl back up into that womb for for
[1:28:33] safety don't look at me like this now I
[1:28:35] want you to listen to what I'm saying
[1:28:37] the wound was your fault you caused the
[1:28:41] wound in the savior he didn't do it it
[1:28:45] was your sin that did it and you've got
[1:28:47] to crawl back up in there and that is
[1:28:49] your only place of safety is the wor of
[1:28:54] the word praise God and when the brother
[1:28:57] BR said when they forced that spear in
[1:29:00] his side the bride was released but she
[1:29:03] was already in
[1:29:05] him she was in him already when he was
[1:29:08] crucified on the cross you crucified him
[1:29:12] yes you made him go through the
[1:29:15] pain and so now the Cliff of the rock is
[1:29:21] your only safe place it's the only place
[1:29:24] you could be safe because you caused the
[1:29:27] pain I caused the pain we caused the
[1:29:30] pain he was he was wounded for our
[1:29:35] transgressions the chastisement of our
[1:29:38] pieces upon him and by his stripes we
[1:29:41] were healed so we were there weren't
[1:29:47] we amen no let me let me just I'm going
[1:29:52] to stop at 9:00 but I have to read
[1:29:55] something that the Lord showed
[1:30:00] me forgive me for not getting into my
[1:30:03] whole message but I this is the end of
[1:30:06] the message and I hope you could
[1:30:08] understand I've been devouring the book
[1:30:10] The
[1:30:11] Masterpiece and in the Masterpiece
[1:30:14] brother Brenham said it was not
[1:30:16] only Christ that
[1:30:18] was crucified and clefted but it was
[1:30:23] also the bride or the church the bride
[1:30:27] was
[1:30:28] also and so let me start this by
[1:30:34] saying in the
[1:30:36] message the Masterpiece brother
[1:30:40] Branham said something that really
[1:30:43] triggered a thought so I did some
[1:30:47] research and I began to see some things
[1:30:51] i' never seen when he brought that up
[1:30:53] you see I've been
[1:30:54] to Italy several
[1:30:56] times I've been to the Peter's Church of
[1:31:00] the chains and that's that's chains that
[1:31:04] are on display that they believe were on
[1:31:08] Peter when he was in
[1:31:10] prison and they made a big deal over and
[1:31:13] they've got the chains and they said
[1:31:16] miraculously they came and they joined
[1:31:18] together up there on this pedestal
[1:31:20] that's not why I went I wanted to see
[1:31:24] Michelangelo's
[1:31:27] Moses I've seen it
[1:31:30] twice about as close as this is for
[1:31:34] me brother Bram saw a copy at at Fort or
[1:31:39] whatever lawn there is in California but
[1:31:41] I was actually in front of the now they
[1:31:43] won't let you get close and they won't
[1:31:44] let you take pictures because they say
[1:31:46] the flash bulbs affect the marble I
[1:31:48] don't know if that's true or not but
[1:31:49] maybe the millions of people that have
[1:31:51] seen it but I want to just give you some
[1:31:53] back
[1:31:54] background Michelangelo means Michael
[1:31:57] the
[1:31:58] angel and if you'll notice in the book I
[1:32:01] believe it's Jude where where the devil
[1:32:03] was contending with Michael for the body
[1:32:06] of Moses you remember that okay maybe
[1:32:09] that is what caused
[1:32:11] Michelangelo because of that maybe
[1:32:15] that's what caused him to do what he
[1:32:18] did let me read some things
[1:32:21] here Michelangelo was given
[1:32:24] a
[1:32:25] damaged piece of
[1:32:28] marble and I'm going to say another
[1:32:30] preacher started on it to use it as
[1:32:33] a as a statue and he broke it wrong and
[1:32:37] he threw it out and I think of my
[1:32:41] savior the rock that was
[1:32:45] rejected and so Michael Angelo found
[1:32:48] this massive piece of marble that was
[1:32:52] damaged and he he took it to his shop
[1:32:56] there let me
[1:33:00] read they called him a
[1:33:03] Mystic because when he would look
[1:33:06] brother R called him the great
[1:33:09] sculpture he would look at that piece of
[1:33:12] marble and they called him a Mystic
[1:33:14] because he could
[1:33:16] actually in the vision of his mind see
[1:33:20] the subject that he was fixing to make
[1:33:23] out of that marble actually
[1:33:26] reposing sleeping in that marble now you
[1:33:30] think about the very God that we serve
[1:33:34] he knew you before you were ever
[1:33:36] born you were in him and here's a man
[1:33:40] called Michelangelo that saw this rock
[1:33:43] and knew exactly what he was going to
[1:33:45] make out of it so in the back part of
[1:33:48] his mind this is proven by the way back
[1:33:51] part of his mind he saw an image
[1:33:54] and so when he approached that marble he
[1:33:56] looked at the Fishers that's cracks and
[1:33:59] veins in it and he looked at it and he
[1:34:01] knew that that subject that he's fixing
[1:34:05] to make is is caught in a prison of
[1:34:13] rock I've got to release
[1:34:16] him that's the way we were we were in a
[1:34:19] prison of our own thinking and
[1:34:21] denomination and he said I have to
[1:34:22] release you
[1:34:24] he saw the potential in you right
[1:34:26] because he's the rock and you're the
[1:34:28] rock you're part of the
[1:34:30] rock you know how long it takes for a a
[1:34:33] three-pointed little chisel and a hammer
[1:34:35] for
[1:34:36] Michelangelo takes years years to do it
[1:34:40] let me
[1:34:45] read he believed the figures he formed
[1:34:48] were already in the blocks of stone
[1:34:51] needing to be released by The sculpt
[1:34:56] by studying the marble that's us its
[1:35:00] Fishers in veins he could determine
[1:35:03] where the subject slept inside that
[1:35:11] rock then layer by
[1:35:13] layer test and trial by test and
[1:35:17] trial Blow by
[1:35:20] blow he would
[1:35:22] liberate his is subject from its Rocky
[1:35:28] prison I just I think that's
[1:35:30] poetic the art was suffering
[1:35:34] Michelangelo suffered this whole time
[1:35:37] because his one of objective was to free
[1:35:42] the subject from The Rock and make it
[1:35:45] alive amen now do you see why after he
[1:35:48] polished and finished it and sat B and
[1:35:50] looked at it and took turned it around
[1:35:52] three-dimensional I've looked at it I've
[1:35:54] seen the the blow on his right knee I
[1:35:56] know what it looks like I'm not just
[1:35:59] talking about something I don't know I
[1:36:00] know cuz I sculpted when I was young I
[1:36:03] didn't have marble to do like him but I
[1:36:04] did in wood and different other pottery
[1:36:07] and that but I know when I had a vision
[1:36:09] of something I wanted I was never
[1:36:12] satisfied until it was done and here
[1:36:14] this man finally produced brother BR
[1:36:17] said all the years of suffering and in
[1:36:21] travail he wanted to make that image
[1:36:23] come to life so
[1:36:25] bad because he knew it was restricted
[1:36:28] inside that rock and he he had the
[1:36:31] authority by his own nature to release
[1:36:35] that from that rock and God did the same
[1:36:37] thing to you and me when he reached down
[1:36:40] with his power and released us from the
[1:36:43] denominational thinking or men's ideas
[1:36:46] do you realize you breathe better you
[1:36:48] got you got happier your whole system
[1:36:51] was changed because you were birthed by
[1:36:55] the Holy
[1:36:57] Ghost
[1:37:01] Hallelujah no
[1:37:04] wonder after seeing this
[1:37:06] imprisoned Moses one that interesting
[1:37:09] thing about this statue it has two bumps
[1:37:12] on its head well in case you're
[1:37:16] wondering it's because a sculpture
[1:37:20] can't sculpt or fashion Glory
[1:37:24] and because the glory was on
[1:37:28] Moses Michelangelo had to make two big
[1:37:32] it looked like horns of the devil but it
[1:37:34] wasn't it was actually the glory of God
[1:37:38] on that vessel it was so
[1:37:41] real it he it came into such perfect
[1:37:44] harmony with the vision with the image
[1:37:48] the character of that image was
[1:37:52] Michelangelo's Moses that he had to
[1:37:55] Smite it and say speak because he
[1:37:58] released it from the other way that the
[1:38:01] man was that that that U uh Vision was
[1:38:05] bringing him out of the other life that
[1:38:08] he had he had no freedom in that life so
[1:38:10] by doing that he was now released and he
[1:38:12] had to say
[1:38:15] speak until we understand what really
[1:38:20] means speak to that mountain speak to
[1:38:24] that rock Moses failed the Lord and
[1:38:27] didn't get to the promised land but we
[1:38:29] don't need to we've got the Cliff of the
[1:38:32] rock to hide in we can go in there and
[1:38:33] it isn't made by our own ideas God
[1:38:36] himself made that Clift by the
[1:38:39] crucifixion and that's where we crawl in
[1:38:41] that's where we're hidden that's where
[1:38:43] we're safe that's why Fanny Crosby had
[1:38:45] to write that song prise God Amen God
[1:38:49] bless you tonight
[1:38:52] amen and I guess I don't feel so bad but
[1:38:55] he died when he was 89 years old
[1:38:57] Michelangelo did but he produced a lot
[1:39:00] of great great works because he had a
[1:39:03] desire in his heart but it even goes
[1:39:06] deeper than that how many know that the
[1:39:09] main thrust of the news has been through
[1:39:12] several years what is your
[1:39:15] DNA what is your DNA that's the real you
[1:39:19] and they can find it and scrape it and
[1:39:21] do this or whatever from the saliva
[1:39:23] whatever and it proves who you were in
[1:39:25] your background you know that's
[1:39:27] true but God has his own DNA that's
[1:39:30] right are you ready yeah DNA
[1:39:35] deity now
[1:39:39] abides let's stand you are deity today
[1:39:43] you are deity you've been cut out of the
[1:39:46] Rock and you are living breathing
[1:39:50] absolute product of his resurrection
[1:39:53] and you aren't you don't have to worry
[1:39:56] anymore whether it's going to happen or
[1:39:58] not it already has happened you were
[1:40:00] already healed before you ever came on
