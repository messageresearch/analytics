this hour and god may we feed from your hand as you break the bread of life to us may you give us that portion we need in something that'll open our eyes to recognize the day and the hour we're living lord and what you're doing in and through us may we be more yielded than ever before and make a greater surrender than ever before that you might accomplish your work in this hour we love you we pray you would take preeminence as we yield ourselves to you that you would speak lord that we would have ears to hear in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you if we could while we're standing turn together to genesis chapter 1. amen genesis chapter 1 and verse 27. genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated amen we'll ask god to bless us as we look into this word and he would give us a spirit of revelation and then when we look at this commandment that's given to to god to god's creation he said to man he said and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and so we know there's a commandment and that commandment carries with it a prophecy amen and this is the word of god the word of god is is prophetic and brother benham says this and the spoken word is the original seed he said adam's bride could not wait god had told adam and eve multiply and replenish the earth it was an oncoming thing a promise and then he says again further down now adam's bride could not wait but she went forward first that's the way today the bride today she wants to manufacture something glory to god she's got to work it up on the platform she's got to have everything see see what is she doing manufacturing something and we know this you know we know the story so well in the book of genesis we've talked about it so much but i just want to take a look at it as we as we move forward because they were given a prophecy they were given the word to keep and part of that was to to multiply and replenish amen but but brother branham told us that eve could not wait amen she got ahead of the program she got ahead of god's program she could not wait and she was in thai she was led astray by the serpent and she took the serpent's words and and she fell and she brought the fall but it was because she was impatient with the word of god it was because she could not wait amen for god to bring the revelation of how bring the revelation of when or whatever revelation he would bring amen to mark the timing for this prophecy to be fulfilled she couldn't wait she got ahead she moved forward she went ahead and she went ahead of adam amen and so we find that it created a big problem and and tonight you know i want to minister on i've got this title unlocking the power of the prophecy by submission unlocking the power of the prophecy by submission when we think of power and we think of powerful things and powerful demonstrations we don't often think of submission because submission looks like something that's low or weak or humble and it doesn't always go together with power power submission they bring two different things to mind but i'm not talking about unlocking the power of the prophecy by submission and really i've been on this same subject for over a week now for about two weeks and i can't get off of it i wanted to go another direction and i just can't break away from it god keeps bringing me back to this so these are many of the things we've been talking about we're not talking about something brand new or we're not off on to a different subject this is very much in the theme of what we've been preaching but we noticed that that eve at adam the man was commissioned to bring forth and replenish and we know according to the word that he was given a bride to reproduce himself amen but before that god amen could could bring a further revelation she took the serpent's word she couldn't wait she got ahead of the program and instead of bringing forth life she produced death and we're all suffering from that decision so further down in spoken word the prophet of god says when god give a commission which cannot perish god's word is eternal it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the earth that was god's eternal purpose to carry that out you cannot die because it's his word you have to live if that child had been brought forth right there'd have been no death but she couldn't wait so now we see the problem is she could not wait she and brother brown says and when the scripture says she was beguiled she was deceived she thought she was doing right she knew what the prophecy was she had a desire amen but she she wasn't waiting and then she went ahead and that was the problem brother braham says in the other in this message there is only one way provided by god for anything in 1963 there has never been anything that ever beat god's way on anything i don't care what it is if people would just don't try to inject their own ideas but just take it the way god said it believing it see it seems to be so hard for man just to get out of his own ideas just he's got to have something to do into it himself he has always gummed up if you use if you excuse the expression he has always gummed up god's way for him by injecting his own way into it and that's exactly what eve did through the serpent's wisdom she took that wisdom and injected her own idea she injected her own way and ruined the plan of god amen and so if she would have just waited there was a prophecy there there was a word and she was the right woman she was the right one she had the right word if she would have just waited everything god said would have come to pass and remember she just couldn't wait she thought she was doing right she went ahead of the program of god and it brought death because it wasn't the word of god it was the word of god mixed with reasoning amen and it brought death amen and he said you never beat god's way on anything amen just take god's way you'll never beat god's way on anything let's turn over to genesis chapter 3 and read verse 14. and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so here comes another prophecy involving the woman the first prophecy was to replenish the multiply and replenish and the woman got ahead of the program and and and messed up that plan and brought death instead of life but now there's another prophecy that involves the seed of the woman amen and this is this is the mention of christ coming into the scene that there's going to be a seed of the woman that will bruise the head of the serpent and he'll bruise his heel and the seat of a woman is the prophecy of coming christ and so now there's another prophecy laying down that's attached to the woman amen and what we find is when we go back and look through the bible amen we start to recognize by the by the understanding that the message has given us we go to see that these prophecies this plan of god this program that god has had it is so intrically linked to the woman amen all the way down through the bible that you know that the woman is also the type of the bride and you can see where she's messed up all the way down through the line she's messed up by taking her own idea she's messed up by not waiting amen even sarah she she failed in the plan of god because she wouldn't wait so she took her own idea to bring about the promise and she and she messed up the whole works so this has always been the problem all the way down through so god lays down here a prophecy the seed of the woman and and no doubt there was all kinds of ideas floating around about the seed of the woman and and what that meant and and how it would come to pass and i'm sure there was a ton of speculation how many thinks anything's changed amen i'm sure there was a ton of speculation as they would read this and the seat of the woman it's coming out of the woman the nation it's coming from this one it's coming from that and there's all kinds of speculation but isaiah would come in chapter 7 and say a virgin shall conceive amen and that's a further prophecy amen right in line with this prophecy a virgin a virgin shall conceive amen and isaiah's picking up this prophecy and carrying it the next step further and now it broke out into all kinds of speculation amen was he speaking of uh who was he speaking of the high priest daughter brother branham tells us all this i was speaking of the the nation of israel bringing forth what's the what is it so there's speculation going on all over the place there's conversation going on all over the place amen and they're speculating maybe it's this and maybe it's that and has it already happened is it going to happen but they're come on the scene in angel visitation one day when it was time for the prophecy to go into full effect amen god did it in a way that man could not tamper with it he sent an angel messenger to a virgin amen in an outer way a place not in a temple not in a tabernacle amen but as she was going to fetch water in her hometown he did it and bypassed all the theology he bypassed every system amen he went around all the things that have always messed up his works and he comes straight to the little virgin himself praise be to god so he he he comes brother branham says this way and turning northward from 1961 but we always try to put our ideas in it and that when we inject our ideas when we inject our theology into god's spirit it takes god's spirit away that's the way it was in that day they were on the road but they wanted something they could do themselves and now we know he's speaking of the nation israel they had been brought out with a mighty hand they had been redeemed out of egypt they were on their way to fulfill the word of god the promise that was given to abraham and they're moving by the leadership of god everything is going fine amen everything's going perfect his angel is leading them all the way to the promised land amen but they refused the voice of god and now they wanted a law because brother brennan said they wanted something they could do into themselves and oh my goodness i don't want anything that i'm required to do myself because i will mess it up amen that we realize even when god was going to give the the commandment to them and and the ordinances through moses moses went up on the mountain he was up on mount sinai for 40 days and they couldn't wait 40 days in the absence of moses they begin to get scared amen maybe he won't come back maybe god's taken him amen and they already within 40 days by their own anxiety and nervousness they decide to push aaron into making a golden calf that they might worship the god that led them up out of israel they were lost amen with no headship with moses being gone and the woman decided that she needed to make her own god to represent the god that brought her out of egypt so she could worship because we don't know what's become of moses it's the same thing that's happened all the way down through they just couldn't wait they couldn't just trust god and wait they got nervous because nothing's happening they got nervous because it's been so long they got nervous because 40 days and now we're in this betwixt in between right who will lead us what will happen we've come out amen we know we're going to the promise amen but as of this moses we don't know what's become of him amen it wasn't it showed that they were in a state of immaturity because what they were doing was now going back to what they saw in egypt amen they were going right back to the denominational idea make a golden calf and worship the god that led us out of egypt they had seen that in egypt and they were turning back because they got impatient and couldn't wait for god to finish what god was going to do god's the one who brought them out with a mighty hand and god's the one who promised to take him into the promised land it wasn't a lack of faith in moses this was expressing a lack of faith in god who brought them out and they weren't sure that he would take them in they had to inject something of their own because they couldn't wait and then they they you know we we understand what happened moses now returns and there's a judgment that comes and and god you know they continue on the journey but they they asked for a law because they couldn't take the straight word of god right from the mouth of god they wanted something to go in between and they wanted something that they could do themselves and this has always been the problem with man he always wants to put his hand to the wheel but every time he puts his hand to the wheel he ruins the program of god every time but he always thinks it's amazing he always thinks god needs my help always thinks god needs me because that's not entirely untrue brother branham said god has so worked his plan he so worked his plan that his plan cannot move without you and i that god put himself in partnership with man is that right and we're his hands we're his feet we're his mouth so there's a truth but the truth with the wrong concept of that truth brings death not life because we think that that you know because my hands are his hands he has no hands but mine he has no feet but mine no mouth but mine amen then we start to think he needs my brain too he doesn't need your brain he just needs your body amen amen he's not after your thinking he's not after what you think about something he needs your hands he needs your feet he needs your mouth he needs your eyes he needs your ears but if you could just leave your thinking out of it amen we would be getting further down the road amen amen so so we can take the truth and get the wrong concept with the truth it's the truth god's on partnership with man he works through man he does nothing without man is that true it's true but so then we think now sometimes then i have to do something and that's what i want to talk about today and it's true there's things we need to do but the things we need to do is not come up with our own understanding and not figure out our own way in fact not to figure out anything i mean we need to we need to drop that idea right away so i want to look at this prophecy let's go to luke chapter one look to the fulfillment of the prophecy of the seed of the woman come to the new testament and pick it up in luke chapter 1. all right luke 1 and verse 26 and then the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man now let's just stop and look at this for a minute here comes the time for the fulfillment of the prophecy it's been laying now for thousands of years but it's come time it's god's appointed time and you could do nothing to move this into place faster than god's time there's been a prophecy laying there in genesis 3 they've been looking at it for thousands of years isaiah come later a thou more than a thousand years later and he lays down the furtherance of the prophecy a virgin shall conceive and it's been laying there for 700 years to this point approximately 700 years to this point and they've been watching it and surmising about it and and contemplating it and trying to understand when will it be fulfilled how will it be fulfilled has it already been filled been fulfilled will it be fulfilled in the future they're asking all of these questions but god knew exactly when exactly where and exactly how and in god's appointed time he didn't consult with anybody else he just came he sent an angel messenger from the presence of the lord and he stepped on the scene and he comes straight to the woman and not the high priest but the woman who the prophecy was referring to and said hail thou mary highly favored and she had no idea what her proper identification was but it was the angel from the lord who told her who she was amen she thought she was a little virgin girl from nazareth a spouse to a man named joseph that was only part of her story but the other part of her story was going to be revealed to her by this messenger that came from the presence of the lord was going to tell her you've got a place in prophecy you've got a place in the word it's more than what you think amen you're the one that was he was referring to in genesis 3 and in isaiah 7. and he begins to tell her that you're going to conceive of the lord you're going to have a child and mary goes right back to old thinking she goes right back to how am i going to do this how am i going to do this and that altogether is wrong thinking she says let's read it again in verse 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man she's asking how will i do this i'm not married i'm a virgin all her understanding all her ideas would not allow there's the calculation always came up to zero her ideas could not compute how will i do this and listen what he says and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her so she asked the question how to tell this thing be saying i know no man and he said well you've got to do this you've got to go to more services and you've got to pray a little bit harder and if you fast for a while if you if you just are a little more serious and if you just work a little harder what he tells her has nothing to do with any effort of hers at all the answer to her question did not involve her effort did not involve her works did not involve her good behavior it did not involve her whatsoever this was something god was going to do in her not something she was going to do herself and the angel answer verse 35 said the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and she she asked the question how those should wha how will this be what should i do how is this going to happen uh what are what are the steps that i should take amen and the angel said nothing the holy ghost is going to overshadow you the power of the highest is going to come upon you it's something god is going to do himself in you and she said be it unto me according to your word now you see god wasn't going to require mary to do anything there's no way there was no way that mary could bring this prophecy to pass on her own there was nothing she could do to conceive as a virgin there was nothing she could do to bring forth the seat of the woman it was an impossibility for her to produce this word amen but they had never the the whole concept the whole idea amen that the the jews were stuck in at that time is to serve god i must do amen and in serving god i take a sacrifice and serving god i go to the feast days and serving god i do this this and this so if anything's going to happen it's going to happen as i do the the works that are laid out for me to do but here comes a time when god's going to fulfill his own word she's the vessel that's preordained from before the foundation of the world to bring forth this seed she has no concept but god knows and he comes to her in the right time and the right season and says you're going to be the one and she goes to the most logical question how's this going to happen and he says it's not going to be anything that you do whatsoever this is going to be the holy ghost and the power of the highest but there is a critical part where she says be it unto me brother branham said that god never works outside a free moral agency and that god is a gentleman and he never forces his way upon anybody amen so the prophecy for 2 000 years was locked up that uh the the prophecy that the seed of the woman shall bruise her head it was locked up the prophecy for 700 years that that that uh virgin shall conceive it was locked up and in god's time he was coming to unlock that prophecy and he had chosen the vessel he had decided the method he had everything laid out all he needed was one thing he needed a willing vessel he needed the woman to say be it unto me according to thy word because the holy ghost would never violate her free moral agency and the holy ghost would never be an uh ungentlemanly he would never force himself upon her and so she had to be a willing vessel she had to be a surrendered vessel she had to say be it unto me so you if you think about this the prophecy that has been laying for years that that is the whole hope of mankind amen it's locked up amen in the submission of this woman think about think about moses moses was born a proper child he was born under a sign the prophet tells us he was born to be the deliverer of israel amen but but he had tried in his own efforts with his own idea and with his own works he had tried to start the deliverance and in starting the deliverance he had killed one egyptian and and he had gotten uh some condemnation over that and he ran to the wilderness to hide that was his effort he was the right man he was he he was coming on the scene and roughly the right time but with his own idea in his own effort it was a complete flop he utterly failed he ran into the wilderness and now he's the he is the chosen vessel he's the one born under the sign he was born to be the the redeemer amen he's the one and so now god in his appointed time has to come to him and when god comes to him now you know moses has gotten to the place where he didn't want to go he didn't think he could go he didn't think he was good enough he didn't think they would accept him i mean he had a whole list of reasons why he ought not to go and so if you begin to read in the scripture there is set up the most ridiculous dialogue in the world between moses and god god says you're going to be the one and he says i can't do it they won't listen to me they they won't believe me and he says okay stick your hand in your bosom pull it out it's leprosy put it back in all right now they'll listen to you he says what if they still don't listen to me he said take that rod throw it down okay they'll listen if they don't listen to the voice of the first sign they'll listen to the voice of the second sign and he says but i can't talk you know i i don't know and and he's arguing with god and you're thinking how can god tolerate this like moses is talking to god god says i'm sending you and he says i can't do it you go and he gives him a supernatural sign he says they still won't receive me he gives him a second supernatural sign and then he still doubts and he says but you know i can't speak and he says well i'll give you aaron your brother to be your prophet and you'll be you'll be a god and he'll be your prophet and he and he goes through all of this until the anger of the lord is kindled against moses and you think how could god tolerate this it's because god has no other choice this is the only man that can go and do it and god cannot violate his free moral agency go ahead and he says i can't do it he says i'll give you a sign i still can't do it i'll give you another sign i can't do this i'll give you air it looks like god is giving in to moses and giving in to moses and we know all of this plays into the program of god because each of these signs represent something amen they they they're symbolic and they're meaningful but if you look at the dialogue it's utterly ridiculous how many of us would get in that conversation with god i'd be scared to death right but god doesn't have a plan b it's moses moses is the one there's no plan b so when moses needs something else god gives it to him but most said i can't do this he solves this and this and this until the anger of the lord is kindled against mother he's getting angry with moses but he can't smite him dead if he smote him dead he'd have to resurrect him he's the only choice so god is working listen god is working with moses to get moses to yield to his will because god has no other plan it's moses he's the one and this is the time and so finally god convinces him to go i mean this dialogue is fascinating to me and he goes think about brother branham brother branham was told amen by the whirlwind in the tree don't ever smoke or drink or defile thy body in any way for when you're older there's a work for you to do and brother brenham's on the river and a boat with his dad and his dad's buddy and then his dad's friend offers him a drink and he says no because he's got a commission and he's been told by a whirlwind a voice out of a whirlwind and and he says i got so many boys on only one of them is a and brother branham determined that he was going to drink amen what was in that bottle before he put it to his lips amen god didn't smash the bottle he didn't fling it out of his hand but god caused the noise supernatural noise of the whirlwind the ring in his ears to remind him until brother branham dropped the bottle himself why because there's not a plan b he's the one amen praise be to god so what was it that god needed from moses did he did he meet his military understanding did he need his egyptian education he didn't even need apparently he stuttered so god wasn't even looking for an eloquent speaker what skill what ability what knowledge was god looking for in moses he wasn't looking for any he was just looking for a yielded vessel and he kept working with moses and working with moses what did he need from moses he needed a surrender that's all he needed from moses is was moses's submission what was locking up the prophecy moses's submission what unlocked the prophecy the power of the prophecy and put the prophecy in the motion when moses finally agreed to go mary could never have given herself a seed she could have never brought forth a baby in her condition god come to her she didn't go to god she wasn't asking for this to happen is that right god determined who god determined when god determined how and he came to her and when we come to her he only needed one thing from her and that was her surrender all he needed was her submission to him and when she submitted to him he did everything else let's look a little further in luke as soon as mary receives this from the angel it says in verse 39 and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leapt in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost here we have a supernatural event taking place mary is coming in and she's saluting or greeting her cousin elizabeth and what was that greeting well we know because brother branham tells us she tells elizabeth in the greeting what happened and that she was going to have a baby and his name was jesus and as soon as she spoke the name jesus john the baptist who was laying as dead within elizabeth sprung to life amen because now one woman carrying a promise speaks to another woman carrying a promise and the woman with the promise when she speaks the promise that's within her brings life to the promise that's in the other woman hallelujah an elizabeth filled with the holy ghost begins to prophesy amen at the same time her husband is mute and her husband has been deemed mute because he doubted the promise zacharias in the temple met the same angel amen that mary met and he doubted the promise and he was made dumb he was made a mute he come out of there could not speak amen because the old system of church doubted the timing of the promise amen so the old system of the church the ministry was their mouth was shut and now god is going to speak through the woman because it very much matches the day that we're in now god is speaking through his bride amen and because she she has received the promise and now mary at the time that her husband's a mute amen and because of his doubt she is now elizabeth now is prophesying over mary amen amen you think when we get together to fellowship we're just talking but if you're carrying a promise inside of you amen for this day and somebody else is a promise in them but it may be laying dormant it may be dead it may not they may not have felt it warm and kick and move around inside of them yet but if you've got a promise in you and you just go begin to speak what the angel has told you amen it may just bring to life the promise that's laying in another woman be to god i love when we get into the new testament it's so different matthew opens up with the genealogy of christ and instead of father begot son begot son begot son now has injected all these women now we have rahab and now where are all these women coming in to the bible in the new testament because the old testament is jesus christ the new testament what's the bride the new testament that's all he was the fulfillment of the old testament she's the fulfillment of the new testament so the new testament launches out in matthew with a genealogy that has five women included the fifth is lady grace mary we're talking about luke launches out amen in the beginning chapter one and you've got the angel coming to a woman you've got conception coming to a barren woman the angel coming and bringing conception to a virgin woman amen the virgin woman speaking to the barren woman both of them with a promised word inside of them the one speaks amen the other one has the promise come to life and begins to prophesy she goes on to say verse 41 we'll read that again and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leapt in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou are among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed blessed is she that believed for these these for for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord what did god need he needed her surrender her submission by faith he needed her surrender by faith because elizabeth says blessed is she believed for there will be a performance why would there be a performance because she surrendered because she believed see this cuts legalism completely out of the picture see god needs a surrender from you and i he needs us to forget our own thinking and just take what he gave us on the word just take the word as he gave it to us through this prophet he doesn't need us to figure it out he doesn't need us to inject our own thinking he just needs us to surrender to this word but not a surrender out of fear because that'll never produce what it produced in mary not a surrender because of church rules that'll never produce what it produced in mary but mary surrendered because she believed she believed what the angel told her she wasn't afraid she wasn't coerced she wasn't manipulated she just heard the word and she believed the word and she said be it unto me according to your word amen i believe and elizabeth confirm amen blessed is she that believed for there shall be amen a performance of those things that were told unto her she god could now work in her because she was surrendering not because somebody told her to not because she was afraid of what the church would think not because there was a rule or a system or god was beyond all of that he passed bypass the whole system it came to her and what is he looking for he's looking for somebody who could believe what he said and somebody that would yield themselves to him and that's still what he's looking for you know he told samuel told saul is god more delighted in burnt sacrifice or in obedience in obedience he desires more than sacrifice but what kind of obedience does he desire you understand god is not looking for another system he's not looking for another code of conducts or code of rules that now i'm doing this to be accepted by the lord and i'm going to do all of these things and now everything's going to work out fine that's not what god's looking for god is looking for somebody who'll say i believe exactly what you said that's nothing but the lord and let that be unto me according to what you said why because i believe and i'm going to surrender myself and yield myself to this message amen not because i think that if i keep everything every jot every iota every tittle then all of a sudden i'll be accepted i was accepted from the very beginning mary was accepted from the very beginning she yielded because she was accepted she yielded because she believed and so when we begin to talk about surrendering to the message believing the prophet that god sent us and obeying the word that was given to us it is never the concept of old testament old system just do what you're told if you just do everything if you just do everything the way that prophet said do it you'll be accepted that's not the idea friends that's not it at all because then you begin to surrender to a system you begin to surrender to a coat of rules and you begin to surrender because of fear or because of manipulation or for reward but really the surrender comes from love because jesus said if you love me keep my commandments he didn't say make sure you keep my commandments he wasn't looking for commandment keepers he was looking for people who loved him that would keep his commandments amen so i me personally this is me i am a staunch believer in doing what the prophet said i mean i believe it i believe that's the voice that god spoke through in this day it's the voice of god to us and if he said it i believe it i want to line to it as much as i possibly can i accept it as truth but i am not in any way here to promote or propagate a system and say if you do xyz then you'll be accepted by god you can do all of it and still not be accepted because you didn't do it out of love there was no revelation no faith you were surrendering to somebody telling you jump okay you jump walk here you walked here come to church every time the door is open you can do all of it and not be a child of god it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't guarantee anything amen brother branham said amen faith faith is what wins the day what is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith amen but he said works is my love to god it's a revelation i'll say it this way why do i believe me personally why am do i believe so much in heeding what the prophet taught because of my revelation of what god has done in this day of what the message is and what he brought and what he taught and why and because i believe that i believe this message is christ and so for me it's it's it's an act of love like i want to do what christ wants me to do like i'm so thankful i don't have to figure it out i'm so thankful as a father when a question comes up in my house that i don't have to sit and ponder and meditate and go search the internet and find out how do how do most christians handle this situation and how do people believe but i can say let's see what the prophet said about this my question comes up in doctrine a question comes up in conduct a question comes up in our family i don't have to say well i think and i think and i feel i can say children i'll get back to you let me find out what the prophet said about this and we're going to do what the prophet said not because i'm afraid that if i don't do what the prophet said god's going to strike me with lightning is because i know that what god sent me in this day was for me amen it was god's word he was sharing his mind he brought what god desired out of his church was brought through that vessel and if that's what god wants that's what i want [Applause] amen praise be to god if you love me keep my commandments not if you weren't accepted by me keep my commandments but if you love me keep my commandments and i say praise god i love him i want to keep reading just a little bit more i want to read some some of what mary said back so first elizabeth filled with the holy ghost begins to prophesy and then mary begins to prophesy and i just want to look at what mary says here in verse 46 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord for my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaid for he for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty have done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm he has scattered the brown and the imagination of their hearts he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things in the rich he hath sent away empty ascent empty away he hath hope and his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to a seed forever mary begins to speak and when she begins to speak amen she begins to speak as somebody who is free she says now my soul doth magnify the lord because she she mary never takes this attitude that god chose me because i'm special and she never takes this attitude of elizabeth i mean you should have known why are you so surprised that i'm the one no she says my soul doesn't magnify the lord amen and she begins to cry out and worship god my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the low estate amen she she knew she was nothing she knew she was incapable she knew there was nothing that she could do and god looked down on her and god took her and brought her in this position to fulfill the word she didn't do anything and she's not claiming to have done anything i think it's important as she begins to magnify the lord the only thing she can do is magnify the lord she can take absolutely no pride and whatsoever in being chosen amen she can take no pride amen in having uh yielded to god and received amen the visitation of the holy ghost and this impregnation she didn't do anything all she did was yielded to god and god did everything and so in her in her magnifying the lord and rejoicing she begins to explain how god looked down on her who was low how god remembered and how god brought up it wasn't any anything whatsoever she did or any merit of her own she begins to cry out what god had done for her and spoken word again the brotherhood said adam found his wife pregnant with the seed of death of satan's lie she had accepted see the power comes in surrender before death could set in eve had to surrender to the lie of the serpent and she had to yield herself to the serpent and when she yielded to the wrong thing it brought death and she accepted satan's line he said now joseph found his wife pregnated with the seed of god which the word the word she had accepted what was she pregnanted by the word that she had accepted be it unto me according to thy word in the message choosing of a bride prophet says the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning ma'am his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so what's what what's the requirement here she is so sold out to him she uses no mind of her own amen his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so she's lining she's surrendering to the word and the message serves we would see jesus he said the true servant always takes you to the word now he is the word he is the bible made living and when you die to yourself with christ like a corn of wheat then the word lives in you brings forth the same results as it did in the living corn of wheat that had to drop into the earth so it's it's as you die to yourself with christ then christ comes alive in you let's turn to the book of ruth i want to look at ruth i mentioned it right at the end of sunday's service but i want to go back and look at this again we'll just walk through ruth just a little bit and pick up a few verses ruth chapter 1 verse 15. ruth chapter 1 verse 15 and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back into her people and unto her god's return now after thy sister-in-law and ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go whether thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god brother when he gets to this he says this chapter 1 is ruth deciding and he takes us on a journey through the church ages and ruth he said this is ruth deciding this is her justification she's deciding to leave moab she's deciding to go back into israel with naomi and and live like naomi lives and live where naomi lives and her people be her people and naomi's god would be her god so this is ruth making her decision let's go to chapter two brother madam said chapter two is ruth serving or ruth working ruth chapter two verse two and ruth the moabite has said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him and whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on the part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech let's go to verse 17. so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ifa of barley and that ifa is about a bushel so she did a good job that was a good good day's labor she had gathered a lot and we know boaz took special interest in here and told the reapers not to chase her away and also to drop handfuls of purpose for her to pick up so he's trying to make it easy for her and she gathered quite a bit of grain she was out reaping behind she was gleaning behind the reapers gathering what was left over and she herself had to beat it out amen we talked about threshing amen and the threshing instruments and the threshing floor on sunday but she herself had to beat it out to separate the the barley from the shuck and she beat it out gathered it and brought it back to naomi and showed naomi how much she had gathered and she had about a bushel full so we have ruth deciding her justification now we have ruth in her legalism brother branham says and sanctification working working out her salvation this is the way brother brahm describes it but let's go to chapter three because we're going to come to ruth resting chapter 3 verse 1 then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and that was not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and that shall be when he lieth down that thou shall mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shall do and he said unto her all that thou sayeth unto me i will do and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law obeyed her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in thy lateran than at thy beginning and as much as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou require us for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman when ruth obeys naomi she says i will do all that they say all that you say and she goes into the threshing floor and and the symbology is terrific she goes into the place where the the separation takes place and she goes according to what naomi had told her and she's in obedience and she surrendered and she comes to where boaz lays himself down by the heap of corn and the threshing floor uncovers her feet and she lays herself down when she lays herself down at his feet she is giving herself away she is she is going to ask this man to take her as a wife and she is completely yielding her life she is giving herself away she is dying to herself on the threshing floor she uncovers his feet and lays down at his feet this is a place of servanthood the servants are at the feet and when he wakes up at midnight he's afraid and he asked and and and she says cover me with your skirt and that's symbolic for if you cover me with your skirt she's asking him to marry her for redemption and he recognizes it's not for self-gain it's not for lust it's not but it's for redemption that her motive is pure and he said blessed be thou verse 10 of the lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in thy ladder in than at the beginning and so much as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and he says i know that thou the whole village knows that you're a virtuous woman i will do what you ask then in verse 14 it says and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor and also he said bring thy veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city and when she had come to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave you me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day in the beginning of the story we have ruth who has to make a decision it's up to ruth she decides and when ruth decides this is her justification she begins to walk in the ways of israel in the ways of gone and as she comes into israel then she begins to work this is her serving the lord this is her laboring this is her phase of legalism and she begins to gather behind the reapers she begins to glean and she begins to beat it out herself amen she's now working for the word she's now she's now laboring she's now uh doing what she can to gather this food amen that they need to live off of amen and it's it's very much amen like we come out of our denomination we make our decision to move into the land but we come into the land and we start laboring in the word amen to understand serpent seed and to understand this and we find these nuggets we get excited about the word and begin we begin i don't know how many of you started doing bible studies first thing i did was bible studies piecing the word together and all of this but then all of a sudden you realize that all my effort is going to come up with nothing amen when the cleaning's over what she's going to do she's just picking up these bits but naomi tells her go surrender yourself to the lord of the harvest go lay at his feet and as soon as she laid at his feet she gave her life completely to him this was not an act of works this was not anything that she could do she was laying her life down at his feet saying i'm giving myself to you will you take me and he says i will take you and after he did amen in the morning she rose up and he dished out to her six measures of barley that she didn't gather herself that she didn't beat out that she didn't labor for amen she didn't have to do nothing to get these six measures of barley all she had to do was surrender to the lord of the harvest and we know he goes and he works the work of redemption he goes into the gate and now naomi says rest there's nothing more for you to do there's nothing he's going to do it all you've given yourself to him he's taken you amen he's given you amen what you had to work for he's given it to you amen my revelation he has poured it on to you amen and it's it's it's a free gift you don't work anymore he gave it to you she carried it back to show that she that she had a token of meeting boaz and naomi says rest your work is done his work it's his work now and listen when you've come to rest it's not you working it's now the lord of the harvest working it's not your work now it wasn't it wasn't any longer ruth's work she received the portion the six portions of barley she didn't work for she didn't earn she didn't labor for but she gave herself in submission to the lord of the harvest he gave it to her she carried it back she doesn't have to do anything else all the responsibility now is shifted on boaz now boaz is going to do it all hebrews 4 9 says there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his when we've entered into the rest with christ we cease from our own works it's not about what we can do to earn something it's about giving ourselves to him and he takes over from there in the message the masterpiece the prophet of god says notice hear the life that was in the husk in the stalk and the tassel in the house all gathers into the seed and the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself ruth had given herself away and she didn't have to work anymore boaz goes and pays the price of redemption and he takes ruth into himself let's look at chapter 4 verse 13. verse 13. so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son the lord gave her conception and she bear a son listen she went through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost but now it's he himself she's receiving life from boaz she's receiving a part of boaz she's receiving the seed from boaz and now she's impregnated by boaz this is the fourth stage amen this is where now she can't work for this she can't earn this all she can do is receive this what did she do to them for what did she do for this position she yielded herself she gave herself away and she yielded and she further yielded the boaz because she doesn't have her own seed she doesn't have any way to get the seed the only way to get it is from boaz and the only way to get it from boaz is to surrender to boaz it's up to boaz now and the only way to be impregnated by the word is to lay ourselves down at the feet of the lord of the harvest and say christ i'm laying myself down at your feet i'm tired of working there's nothing else i can do but will you cover me with your skirt amen amen ruth was excited when she went to naomi after she had gathered barley she gleaned she had beat it out she had worked she had something and then some little substance amen and she was happy about that but naomi knew that this is going to come to an end this isn't going to work you've got to go further than this amen you've got to go to the lord of the harvest who owns it all who will give you freely and willingly and then when you have need that you never run out she was excited about what she did but what she did would come to an end now naomi knew you've got to go another step child you've got to lay yourself down at his feet and give yourself away when you give yourself away now boaz will supply the word now boaz will give you a seed and now you'll be pregnanted with boaz's seed now it's up to boaz not ruth let's look at verse 18. now these are the generations of pharas fair as was begotten by tamar do you remember tamar she was a gentile who played the part of a harlot and receive seed from judah to propagate the line of judah now these are the generations of pharaohs pharas begat hezron hezron begot ram ram begat of bina dab a been a dead begotten nation nation begot salman solomon begotten boaz does anybody remember who salman's wife was rahab the harlot another gentile we got boaz and boaz we got obed who was obed's mother ruth the moabitess there's a whole line of gentiles and obed begot jesse and jesse begot david and jesus christ came as the son of david to take the throne this lineage is so important it's so critical but this lineage was locked in boaz because boaz didn't have anyone as an heir to his estate if boaz had had another wife and another firstborn that firstborn would be listed here the prof the promise of christ coming was locked in boaz the the naomi's inheritance of bemalex inheritance was locked up the inheritance the land was locked amen the lineage was locked how are we going to unlock the the how are we going to unlock the inheritance and how are we going to unlock the lineage the key is a woman this woman and how is she going to do it with what power with what strength with what works with what ability how is she going to unlock the inheritance and unlock the lineage of christ amen there's only one thing she can do and that is give herself away and surrender and lay down at the feet of boaz and when she submitted herself to boaz and boaz took her to himself he finished the work in an unlocked redemption and it unlocked the lineage of christ the prophecy the power of the prophecy was unlocked by what submission not some mighty work the woman did not some big powerful thing not some great but simple submission and in submission there's a redemption and in submission the lineage of christ moves on through boaz praise be to god let's look at romans 16. and we'll wrap up with this scripture romans chapter 16 in verse 20 romans 16 and 20. romans chapter 16 verse 20 and the god of peace shall prove satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen the god of peace shall bruise satan i've asked this question before but who is bruising whom god is bruising satan who's the bruiser god who's being bruised satan where where do i come into play he's just using you the god of priests shall bruise satan under your feet shortly but what do you have to do to it never says you brew satan is that what the scripture says no it's not about your strength your power your boldness your aggressiveness it's not about what you think or what you feel or how much you know it's not you bruising satan it's god bruising satan but how is god going to brew satan under the feet of his bride what does he need you to do nothing he just needs you to surrender he's the one who's going to do it amen this prophecy is laying in the bible amen it needs somebody who will unlock the prophecy the prophecy through submission not through trying to be the bruiser is i'm not the bruiser god is i'm not the strong man he is i'm not the wise one he is i'm not the one with power he has the power i'm not the one with the plan he's got the plan it's not me it's him he's going to use me but it's not me it's him he's going to bruce satan under your feet but it's got to be him doing the bruising he doesn't need your mind he does he doesn't need your intellect or your ability he doesn't need a whatever all he needs is another surrendered vessel in the end time who will take no mind of her own but will stand on thus saith the lord who will not add to the word who will not take away from the word but will take the word the way it's been given to us in this day and stay with the word and let god do the work that he's promised to do in this in this day what's locking the prophecy surrender what will unlock it all he needs is a bride who is submissive to him every other bride failed in submission so now submission this in submission doesn't become a word of weakness submission becomes a word that that moves the program of god along becomes a power there's a power in submission and the power is not in the one who's submissive they have no power of their own but the power and submission is allowing god to take the vessel he's ordained and the time he has chosen and to do the work that he's planned to do he did it in moses he did it in david he did it in jesus christ he did it in brother branham and now he wants to do it in you what does he need he needs somebody who will say no i i don't know i have no power no ability but whatever you said be it unto me that way i yield to you and i believe what you said amen the prophet of god says and why are people so tossed about yet men and women live a good life and love god by a mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with christ and when christ the holy spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament and he's living his own life through his own will through you hallelujah and i know it sounds awful but it's right so yielded you are that christ speaks the kind the word he speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting not yielded and working you're now in ruth's place yielded and resting and now he's coming to you as an individual amen to plant his seed within you and now you're carrying the word you've been impregnated by the word of god amen you're just like ruth there was no power you had to impregnate yourself you couldn't go and grab seed from a man all you could do is come to the lord of the harvest and say i'm yours will you take me and when he takes you now you yield yourself to him and he's the one who comes into you amen in the pergamian church age he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works who's bruising satan it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride he works in and through the bride not the bride works she surrenders he works she yields he overcomes she lays down her life he gives her life [Music] she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time did brother branham say the bride has a work to do no sorry brother ben he has a work to do the work that he left for this time it's not your work it's his work you didn't leave it he left it you didn't designate this time he designated this time he will now do he will now do the work that he left for this time through the bride what can possibly hold this back only one thing that i know of god won't violate free moral agency and god is a gentleman and he won't force himself the only thing i know that can hold this back is an unwillingness in the bride to fully surrender but i thankful that there's another promise that there'll be a bride at the end time who will not fail she's predestinated not to fall she will not fail because she's predestinated not to fail somewhere along the line there's going to be a bride that's going to say be it unto me according to all of your word i throw away all my ideas and i quit with all of my silly efforts i'm going to give myself to you and if anything's going to be accomplished in my life it's going to be something you do through me not something i do of myself he's looking for a surrender to unlock the power of this end time prophecy and i want to give a greater surrender than i ever have before i'm praying that god would just just lay me down and let me surrender and sacrifice and give up all and just surrender to him like i've never surrendered before because i see through the scriptures it's the only way for him to accomplish in this hour let's all stand together musicians if you can make your way up brother john if you make your way up let's just bow our heads how many of you want to lay yourself fresh down at the feet of the lord of the harvest tonight just all over again just go in and lay yourself down lord jesus we are laying ourselves down at your feet and god and we're recognizing through your scriptures that there's nothing we can do in of ourselves we are just in as incapable of mary was of bringing forth the promised seed we are just in as incapable of bringing about redemption as as ruth was by herself lord there's nothing we can do without you so we recognize lord that all of our working and all of our efforts lord and all of our trying will come to an end somewhere so now we want to come to you lord and lay ourselves down at your feet and surrender and say lord jesus cover me with your skirt take me as your own i'm giving myself away i'm giving myself to you take me now oh god i need you to do the work lord jesus we've come to the hour where the prophecy is laying there promising god that you will bruise satan under our feet but we can't do a thing lord it has to be you doing it through us help us to yield help us to surrender help us to give you your place be it unto us lord according to your word father i pray that you would strip away all self-will all are of our own strength and our own ideas that we've been relying on help us to lay it aside lord jesus let us give you your place now and father would you come and take your place would you come impregnate us with the seed of your word and reproduce yourself on this earth through these willing vessels god we just want to lay down our lives and believe that what your angel said is true and it's for us and it's for now and that you're going to do it we give ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name take us use us for your glory accomplish that which you left for this hour do it now in us we pray in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you brother man brother john [Music] hear the lord of harvest sweetly calling who will go and work for me today [Music] who will bring to me the lost and i who will point them to the narrow way speak my lord speak my lord speak and i'll be quick to answer thee speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will answer lord send me [Music] and when [Music] making him as pure as pure can be when the voice of god said who'll go for us then he answered send me [Music] speak my lord speak my lord speak and i'll be quick to answer thee speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will answer lord send me won't soon the time for reaping will be over and soon [Music] may we hear his blessed child well done speak my lord speak my lord speak and i'll be quick to answer thee speak my lord speak my lord speak and i will [Music] amen god bless you as you're dismissed you remain insane but old friends my heart is so burdened not to repeat the mistakes of the past not to say you know what do we need to do what should we be doing what there's only one thing we need to do and that's surrendered to this word that's feed on the message night and day eat the book feed on the message listen to the tapes read the books and say it's true it's true it's true and line up to the revelation that's laying there and just yield your life and give over and give over because it's not going to be anything that we do it's going to be what he does through us what does he need he needs a surrendered vessel every other bride has mixed her own ideas with the word every other bride has come up with something she needed to do to add into it everybody else has come up with some other program or some other idea or we need to work something up or we need to have this program or we need to do this thing or i say forget it all the quicker that we can die the better the quicker that we can surrender the better it's going to be and just stay out of his way and let him do what he's going to do in this hour i say god forgive me help me to stay submitted to you and through my surrendered life let that word that i receive come to life day by day and manifest itself because if anything's going to happen it's going to be you that does it through me not what i do man god bless you friends god bless you amen brother the word and with each light and praise he was drawn me to give a higher praise [Music] i know for sure that i'll reach the goal cause i feel the hope i feel [Music] and i know he speaks to me and i am lord please come [Music] i feel [Music] and i know me to give my own
