[0:00] We're together
[0:05] again just praising the
[0:08] [Music]
[0:10] Lord. We're together
[0:15] again. And in one
[0:22] accord something good is bound to
[0:27] happen.
[0:29] Something
[0:30] good is in store. We're together

[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] accord. Something good is bound to
[1:13] happen.
[1:15] Something
[1:16] good is in store. We're together
[1:24] again. Just praising the
[1:30] Lord. Oh, I want to see him as I journey
[1:35] through the land. Singing as I
[1:38] go, pointing souls to Calvary, to the
[1:43] crimson
[1:44] flow. Many arrows pierce my soul from
[1:50] without. But my Lord leads me on.
[1:54] Through him I must
[1:56] win. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon
[2:01] his face there to sing
[2:05] forever of his saving
[2:08] grace. On the streets of glory. Let me
[2:12] lift my
[2:14] voice. I'll pass home at last ever to
[2:20] rejoice. And when in service for my
[2:24] Lord, dark may be the
[2:27] night. But I'll cling more close to him,
[2:30] he will give me
[2:32] light. Satan snares may vex my soul.
[2:36] Turn my thoughts
[2:38] aside. But my Lord goes ahead. Please

[2:44] tide. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon
[2:49] his face. Dare to sing

[2:55] grace. On the streets of glory. Let me
[3:00] lift my voice. Cares all vast home at
[3:04] last ever to

[3:12] toward the mountain
[3:14] high. And behold my savior there leading
[3:18] in the fight.
[3:20] With a tender hand I'll stretch toward
[3:23] the valley

[3:42] grace on the streets of glory. Let me
[3:46] lift my voice. Cares all passed home at
[3:51] last ever to
[3:55] rejoice. When before me pillows rise
[3:58] from the mighty
[4:00] deep, then my Lord directs my bark. He
[4:04] does safely keep. And he leads me gently
[4:09] on through this world
[4:11] below. He's a real friend to me. Oh, I
[4:16] love him
[4:17] so. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[4:23] face. There to sing
[4:25] forever of his saving

[5:32] [Music]
[5:36] before my
[5:42] heart.
[5:43] Before even time
[5:48] began, my
[5:50] life was in his hand.
[5:57] And he knows my
[6:04] name. And he knows my every
[6:12] thought. And he
[6:14] sees each tear that
[6:18] falls and hears me
[6:22] when I
[6:26] [Music]
[6:28] I have a
[6:31] [Music]
[6:35] father. He calls me his
[6:42] own. He'll
[6:45] never leave
[6:48] me. No
[6:50] matter where I go.
[6:58] And he knows my
[7:04] name. And he knows my every
[7:12] thought. And he sees each tear that
[7:18] falls and hears me when I go. Oh, first
[7:26] skin. And he knows my
[7:34] name. And he knows my every thought.
[7:41] [Music]
[7:43] He sees me each year that falls and he
[7:50] hears me when I
[7:55] call. He gives
[7:58] me a
[8:03] great shine

[13:53] blessed
[13:57] [Music]
[13:59] Jesus. Amen. God bless you this evening.
[14:01] Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord
[14:04] Jesus, we come once again, Lord, to
[14:07] another service. God, we just want to
[14:10] express our gratefulness for your
[14:12] goodness to us to allow us this
[14:14] opportunity, Lord. And we pray, God, now
[14:17] as we turn to look into your word, God,
[14:19] you give us eyes to see and ears to hear
[14:21] all that you've written for us and spoke
[14:23] to us in this end time. And God, may you
[14:26] open our understanding as you open to us
[14:28] the scriptures. May you draw us into
[14:31] that deeper relationship we're craving
[14:33] with you. May you peel back the scales
[14:36] from our eyes that we might see the real
[14:38] reality all around us. Lord, we love
[14:40] you. I pray you take this vessel under
[14:42] your control and that you would speak
[14:44] your eternal words through these lips.
[14:46] And may we leave here, Lord, having
[14:48] grown and gained and been blessed, given
[14:51] you glory and honor for all that you
[14:52] are, Lord. And may your name be praised.
[14:55] We love you and ask your blessing in
[14:57] Jesus Christ's name.
[14:59] Amen. Amen. God bless you all this
[15:02] evening. It's certainly good to be here
[15:04] together again and we count it a great
[15:06] privilege. And before we turn to the
[15:08] scripture, I just want to let you know
[15:10] that today is a very special service
[15:11] that we will have two baptisms at the
[15:13] end of service this evening. The first
[15:16] will be uh uh brother Preston Rogers.
[15:18] Preston Rogers is back here with uh
[15:21] brotherh Joseph Scott. He's a friend of
[15:23] brother Joseph's from Barber College and
[15:25] they've been sharing some good
[15:26] fellowship together and he recognized
[15:28] his need to be baptized by immersion in
[15:30] water and in the name of Jesus Christ.
[15:32] So we had a good conversation on Monday
[15:35] and and it's exciting to see him
[15:37] baptized. And also brother Griffin
[15:40] Schwarz has asked to be baptized and he
[15:42] says he's felt the Lord calling him and
[15:44] drawing him and so we're super excited
[15:46] for that as well. So amen. It's a
[15:48] blessed day. Amen. To be in service. God
[15:51] is so good. Amen. Before we turn to the
[15:53] word too, I want to let you know that
[15:55] brother Marcus Becker will be here this
[15:56] Sunday. This coming Sunday he'll take
[15:58] the morning service and then we have a
[16:00] youth service in the afternoon. He'll be
[16:02] ministering that one as well. So be
[16:05] praying for that. And also to uh
[16:07] tomorrow I leave with all the young
[16:09] adults to go to the young adults weekend
[16:10] in Michigan. So pray for us. We'll be
[16:12] gone for a few nights. We'll be back uh
[16:15] Saturday evening. We'll be back here in
[16:16] service on Sunday. Amen. So if you can
[16:19] remember that in prayer as well, we
[16:20] appreciate it. Amen. While we're
[16:22] standing, let's take our Bibles and turn
[16:24] to the book of
[16:26] Jeremiah. I want to continue on with the
[16:29] thought from Sunday, God in partnership
[16:31] with man. So, this will be part two.
[16:33] It's a thought that I really don't want
[16:34] to leave too quickly. Amen. And we'll
[16:37] just see how the Lord leads, but uh I've
[16:39] got several things I'd like to share if
[16:42] God will permit. in Jeremiah chapter
[16:47] 1. We'll go all the way
[16:50] back and look at
[16:52] verse 4. Jeremiah chapter 1
[16:57] verse4. Then the word of the Lord came
[16:59] unto me, saying, Before I formed thee in
[17:01] the belly, I knew thee. And before thou
[17:04] camest forth out of the womb, I
[17:06] sanctified thee, and ordained thee a
[17:08] prophet unto the nations. Amen. God
[17:11] bless you as you have your seats.
[17:14] What a scripture. Amen. Remember, we're
[17:16] talking about God in partnership with
[17:19] man. And if you remember from Sunday, so
[17:22] many things that were were we were
[17:24] sharing and and how God chose to work
[17:26] through man. And if we read our Bible,
[17:28] the whole Bible is a story of God
[17:30] working through mankind. God selecting
[17:32] his people and working through his
[17:33] people to accomplish his purpose. Amen.
[17:37] And so we see here in Jeremiah, he tells
[17:39] Jeremiah, uh, before I formed thee in
[17:42] the belly, I knew thee. And before thou
[17:46] camest forth out of the womb, I
[17:47] sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[17:49] prophet into the nations. So Jeremiah
[17:52] doesn't really have an option. He's not
[17:54] he's not been asked what he thinks about
[17:56] this. God just told him, "Before you
[17:58] were formed in the belly, before I
[17:59] brought you forth from the womb, I
[18:01] already sanctified you. That means I set
[18:03] you apart for me and and I ordained you.
[18:07] That that means he predestinated he
[18:09] purposed. I ordained thee a prophet unto
[18:12] the nations. So God had made this choice
[18:14] before Jeremiah could do good or bad or
[18:17] right or wrong or whether he could make
[18:19] any decisions. God had already purposed
[18:22] what his life was going to be for. Amen.
[18:25] And I I think this is beautiful because
[18:27] I don't think it applies only to
[18:29] Jeremiah. Amen. I believe it applies to
[18:31] all the children of God. That the
[18:33] children of God are the seed of God. And
[18:35] God knew them before they were
[18:36] predestinated and elect and chosen in
[18:38] Christ Jesus before the foundation of
[18:40] the world. But God didn't just
[18:42] half-hazardly, Amen, just think, well,
[18:44] I'll have some children someday. But he
[18:46] knew exactly who were his children and
[18:48] exactly when they would come forth and
[18:50] exactly what their purpose would be on
[18:52] earth.
[18:54] So I don't look at this just to
[18:55] Jeremiah. I take this for myself. Amen.
[18:57] that God has has chosen me and ordained
[19:00] me. Before I was formed in the belly,
[19:02] before I came forth from the womb, he
[19:04] already had sanctified me unto himself.
[19:07] That means set me apart for a service
[19:10] and ordained me. Now, none of this takes
[19:12] away from free moral agency. I'm sure
[19:14] Jeremiah had choices to make. God was
[19:16] not going to override free choice, but
[19:18] God had already purposed and placed
[19:21] something in Jeremiah that would follow
[19:23] God's will. Amen. Amen. Amen. the same
[19:26] for us. Amen. So God needed, if I could
[19:31] say it this way, God needed Jeremiah.
[19:35] Amen. To fulfill his purpose upon the
[19:37] earth. He needed a prophet in that age.
[19:40] And he ordained Jeremiah to be that
[19:42] prophet. Amen. God had a a message to
[19:45] get to the people. He had a a work to
[19:47] do. And Jeremiah was part of that plan.
[19:50] And God had ordained it before. Amen. He
[19:53] says in the message leadership, you're
[19:55] here because your name was placed on the
[19:57] lamb's book of life before there was
[19:58] even a foundation of the world. That's
[20:00] exactly right. You're a gene, a
[20:02] spiritual gene out of your heavenly
[20:04] father, a part of God's word. Amen.
[20:08] So God is not hoping that he'll have
[20:12] children and hoping that his purpose
[20:15] will be accomplished and hope. He
[20:16] foresaw it. Amen. He already foresaw and
[20:19] he already ordained it and he knew when
[20:21] you would come forth and and he knew
[20:22] what part you would play. Amen. And
[20:26] things that are to be. He says, "And may
[20:28] that little germ of life, the gene of
[20:30] God that was just we just talked of that
[20:32] attribute that came down from God and
[20:34] has been manifested here to honor and
[20:36] glorify God, God moved the world from
[20:38] that." Amen. This is brother Brandham.
[20:40] He's praying and he's talking to God and
[20:42] he's recognizing that there's something
[20:44] in him and his soul that came from God.
[20:47] A little germ of life. Amen. A gene of
[20:49] God that come an attribute that come
[20:52] down from God. Something God placed in
[20:53] him to express. Amen. Part of the word
[20:56] of God. And here's what brother Beam
[20:57] said. God move the world from that. Just
[21:01] it's already there. Just move away
[21:03] anything that hinders. Move the world
[21:05] away so that it can express. And I think
[21:07] that's our prayer today. God, just move
[21:09] the world away from that. Amen. That
[21:11] portion of you that you ordained to be
[21:13] in us to manifest in this hour.
[21:17] In in Psalms 139 verse 13, David writes
[21:21] this, "For thou hast possessed my
[21:24] reigns. Thou has covered me in my
[21:26] mother's womb. I will praise thee, for I
[21:29] am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[21:31] Marvelous are thy works, and that my
[21:33] soul knoweth right well. My substance
[21:35] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[21:37] secret, and curiously rot in the lowest
[21:39] parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see
[21:41] my substance, yet being unperfect. And
[21:44] in thy book all my members were written,
[21:46] which in continuence were fashioned,
[21:48] when as yet there was none of them.
[21:51] Yeah.
[21:52] David's saying, you've already have a
[21:53] record of me, and you knew all my
[21:55] members. You knew all about me. You you
[21:56] you had me recorded in your book before
[21:59] I was even formed.
[22:01] I was not hid from you. You knew all
[22:03] about it and you understood it. Even
[22:05] what was going on in secret, you could
[22:07] see into the secret and understand how I
[22:09] was being formed because you had already
[22:11] recorded it in your book. Praise God.
[22:14] Amen. The Apostle Paul says this in
[22:17] Galatians 1:15. He says, "But when it
[22:20] pleased God, who separated me from my
[22:22] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[22:24] to reveal his son in me, that I might
[22:27] preach him among the heathen." So Paul
[22:30] Paul saying it was God who separated me
[22:33] from my mother's womb. It was God
[22:35] because God intended for me to be born
[22:38] in that in that age. Right? Paul was
[22:40] saying it was God who brought me forth
[22:42] in this day. God who separated me from
[22:45] my mother's womb. God who called me by
[22:47] his grace. Why? To reveal his son in me.
[22:50] That was God's purpose in the Apostle
[22:52] Paul. Amen. To reveal his son in me.
[22:54] That's why he separated from his
[22:56] mother's womb. That's why he called him
[22:57] by grace because there was something in
[22:59] him that was going to be expressed.
[23:02] Praise God. Remember we we were speaking
[23:05] on Sunday out of the book of Acts when
[23:07] Saul who was going to be named Paul. But
[23:09] when Saul came on down the road of
[23:12] Damascus, he was persecuting the church
[23:14] and he was hailing them into prison. And
[23:16] he had letters, you know, from the high
[23:18] priest and the chief priest. And he was
[23:20] going down and wreaking havoc on the
[23:21] church. Amen. And they were terrified.
[23:24] And he was going into Damascus to do
[23:26] great damage to the church of God. But
[23:28] he met he met Jesus Christ in the form
[23:30] of a pillar of fire. And his bright
[23:32] light smoteed him to the ground. And the
[23:34] voice spoke to him and told him, "Amen,
[23:36] why do you kick against the pricks?" And
[23:38] he says, "Who are you, Lord?" And he
[23:40] says, "I'm Jesus whom you persecute."
[23:42] And and Saul just got a revelation right
[23:44] then of the ones that he was handling,
[23:46] the ones that he was mishandling. That
[23:48] was Jesus Christ. Amen. In his church,
[23:52] in his in his form, in his body, in his
[23:54] many membered body. And he realized
[23:56] right then he got a revelation. But
[23:59] then, you know, his eyes were blinded
[24:00] and he went to a house and he was there
[24:03] and God called Ananas and told Ananas to
[24:05] go and lay hands on him and pray for
[24:07] him. And Ananas was uh uh he he was
[24:10] concerned because of Saul's reputation.
[24:13] And he he mentioned that to God. And in
[24:15] Acts 9:15, he says, "But the Lord said
[24:17] unto him, go thy way, for he is a chosen
[24:21] vessel unto me to bear my name before
[24:24] the Gentiles and kings and the children
[24:26] of Israel." Yes. The question is when
[24:29] did God decide
[24:31] that Paul would bear his name before the
[24:32] Gentiles and the kings and the children
[24:34] of Israel?
[24:36] When did he make that decision? When
[24:39] Paul was on the road to Damascus, he
[24:40] said, "Huh, I think he'll do."
[24:44] He knew before the foundation of the
[24:46] world. When the prophecy was there that
[24:48] you'll be a light unto the Gentiles, he
[24:50] knew that was going to be Saul who'd be
[24:52] converted and become Paul. He already
[24:54] knew when the prophecy was made in
[24:56] Isaiah. Amen. That you'll be a light to
[24:58] lighten the Gentiles. He knew exactly
[25:00] who would carry that part of the word
[25:02] out. And it was Paul.
[25:05] And he says, "Go thy way for he's a
[25:06] chosen vessel unto me." And it's
[25:08] beautiful because what was Saul doing?
[25:11] Amen. Saul was wreaking h havoc of the
[25:14] church. He was hauling away men and
[25:16] women to prison. He was separating
[25:18] families. He was breaking up
[25:19] fellowships. He was having people
[25:21] stoned. There was great trouble that was
[25:23] coming. So God did not choose him
[25:25] because of his conduct.
[25:27] God did not choose him because of his
[25:29] actions, because of his repentance,
[25:30] because of God didn't choose him because
[25:32] he was doing right. God choose chose him
[25:35] in the midst
[25:37] of doing horrible deeds. Amen.
[25:41] This blesses my soul. Amen. Because my
[25:44] God cho didn't choose me because I got
[25:46] my act right. He chose me before the
[25:48] foundation of the world and ordained me
[25:50] and and already determined what work I
[25:52] would do. And I'm so glad because when
[25:54] Paul was being rotten,
[25:58] right? Rotten. And Ananas was telling
[26:01] God what rotten deeds he was doing.
[26:04] And in the rotten report of rotten
[26:06] deeds, he says, "But he's a chosen
[26:08] vessel unto me to bear my name." What do
[26:10] you mean bear your name? What a
[26:12] position. Paul didn't get his position
[26:15] because of his conduct. Amen. Paul
[26:18] didn't get his position because of how
[26:20] well he behaved or how successful he
[26:23] was. He got his position by
[26:25] predestination.
[26:28] The same is true for all of us, friends.
[26:31] We don't come to a certain position in
[26:32] the body of Christ because we've been
[26:34] successful and we've done a good job and
[26:36] we got a promotion and God says, "You're
[26:38] a good boy. You've done a good job." I
[26:39] think whatever you have to do in the
[26:41] body of Christ and whatever position God
[26:43] wants to place you in, he decided that
[26:45] before the foundation of the world. It
[26:47] wasn't based on our conduct and what we
[26:48] get right and what we got wrong. That's
[26:50] why God can positionally place you to do
[26:52] a work in his body and you can get it
[26:54] wrong and fail, but it doesn't change
[26:55] God's choosing. Amen.
[26:59] Praise be to God. So, he decided those
[27:01] things ahead of time.
[27:06] Amen. In the message, Abraham and his
[27:08] seed after him, the prophet says, God
[27:10] said, I love Jacob and hate Esau. He
[27:14] says it in Malachi and he says it again
[27:15] in Romans 9 before either child had a
[27:19] way to even make a choice. But God knew
[27:22] from the beginning what Esau was. He
[27:24] knowed what Jacob was. And God knowed in
[27:26] the beginning what you were and what you
[27:28] are not.
[27:30] Amen. He's not waiting to find out.
[27:34] He knew before.
[27:36] So therefore we cannot be nothing. But
[27:39] what if we if we cannot be like somebody
[27:42] else? Let's just be what God made us.
[27:44] That's all we can do. Anything other
[27:47] than that would be hypocrisy. We'd be a
[27:49] hypocrite. So, we do not want to be
[27:52] that. It'd be better to be an infidel
[27:54] than to be a hypocrite. Let's be just
[27:57] what we are. And all these things has to
[28:00] operate together to make the great
[28:01] wheels of God go on. And not one thing
[28:04] is going wrong. I'll guarantee you that.
[28:06] Amen. I I wanted to start diving into
[28:10] this in this subject. God in uh uh
[28:13] partnership with man because God was
[28:17] going to use man to do deeds upon the
[28:21] earth to fulfill and manifest his word
[28:24] which is himself which is his thoughts
[28:26] coming into
[28:28] manifestation. And God was going to
[28:30] choose the men and he was going to
[28:32] choose the time and he was going to
[28:33] choose the place and he placed us where
[28:36] he wanted us.
[28:38] We're not born in the wrong location at
[28:41] the wrong time in the wrong spot. Amen.
[28:44] If we believe that, then we've got
[28:46] something con misconstrued about our
[28:48] understanding about God.
[28:52] So, we're exactly in the right place at
[28:55] the right time for God's purpose. Amen.
[28:59] Amen. And so, and from the beginning, he
[29:03] knew what you were and what you're not.
[29:06] He knew what Jacob and Esau was before
[29:08] they were born. Yeah. Before they could
[29:12] do good or evil, he knew which one would
[29:15] take him at his word and which one would
[29:17] reject the promise. Yeah. He already
[29:19] knew. He knew what they were. He knew
[29:22] what was in them before they were born.
[29:26] And I don't believe that's just for
[29:27] Jacob or Esau. Amen. Amen. So God knowed
[29:31] from the beginning what you were and
[29:33] what you were not. So if God orained us
[29:36] to a time and a place and a position, do
[29:40] we believe that? Then if God ordained
[29:43] that, then he had to ordain our makeup
[29:47] to fulfill that purpose. Amen. Amen. And
[29:51] the prophet of God spends a lot of time
[29:53] telling us this. He tells us that God
[29:55] had to look after your greatgrandparents
[29:57] and your grandparents and your parents
[29:59] and and bring this one to this. And
[30:00] brother Bam said, "And breed this one to
[30:02] that one." Yeah. That's right. I mean,
[30:04] this is like a farmer.
[30:06] You're making sure he gets the right
[30:08] attributes out of, you know, I want a
[30:10] racehorse, so I got to get a a good
[30:14] a good male and a good mayor and a good
[30:16] stud horse and I bring them together.
[30:17] This is how Brother Bam's talking
[30:20] because God wanted us to fulfill a
[30:22] purpose. So, he had to get certain
[30:24] ingredients together. And Brother Benham
[30:26] says it like this. He said, "It's like a
[30:29] a a a bell maker making chimes. He put
[30:32] so much tin and so much lead and so much
[30:35] brass and so much of this in to get a
[30:37] certain ting so it plays a certain note.
[30:39] And not everyone can be made the same or
[30:41] else you can't play a song. Yeah. If
[30:44] they're all identical. They all have to
[30:46] play a different note so that you can
[30:48] play music. Amen. And he ties that back
[30:50] to us and the great orchestra of God.
[30:53] And everybody's got a different part to
[30:54] play and everybody's got a different
[30:56] instrument to play. Amen. And and God
[30:59] ordained it so. And because he ordained
[31:01] it, he had to ordain your birth and he
[31:04] had to ordain your your parents and he
[31:06] had to even ordain part of your genetics
[31:12] to bring us to the package that he
[31:15] foresaw that he could use. Now, we know
[31:18] because of the fall in the Garden of
[31:19] Eden that many things were mixed in that
[31:22] were not originally intended.
[31:25] We all agree. So, we've got to deal with
[31:27] some extra ingredients that none of us
[31:30] like. But not everything in you is
[31:32] wrong.
[31:34] The way you're made is not wrong. The
[31:36] essence of who you are is not wrong. The
[31:38] hybridization is wrong. The extra parts
[31:40] are wrong. But the essence of who you
[31:42] are is not wrong because God saw to it
[31:45] that you were fashioned in such a way to
[31:47] fulfill his purpose for your life. Amen.
[31:50] And to be sure that you would fulfill it
[31:52] and overcome those parts that weren't
[31:54] right, he he made a way that he could
[31:56] fill you with his spirit and give you
[31:58] the power to overcome
[32:01] and to manifest his life inside of you.
[32:04] Amen. Isn't God good?
[32:08] So in the message influence, he says, we
[32:10] notice we got so many Billy Grahams
[32:13] today, but see God never made but one
[32:16] Billy Graham. And you're not just And
[32:19] you're just as important as Billy Graham
[32:21] or Roberts or any of those famous men.
[32:23] You're just as important until you get
[32:25] out of your place and then you're no
[32:27] good at all.
[32:29] I love that.
[32:31] You're a hindrance to these men and
[32:33] you're a hindrance to yourself and the
[32:35] kingdom of God. Stay in your position.
[32:37] See, stay what God made you see and then
[32:40] you'll operate. Right. This reminds me
[32:42] of brother brother Ron Garvin was
[32:44] preaching a few Wednesdays back. Amen.
[32:46] your position that as Paul it's not
[32:49] nothing new Paul taught the same thing
[32:51] said if the hand shall say to the eye
[32:53] because I'm not of the eye or the ear
[32:55] say to the nose I'll no more be an ear
[32:57] because I'm not a nose or something you
[32:59] you can't do that the quote goes on says
[33:02] see it all fitly sets together and moves
[33:04] as one great unit and we mustn't try to
[33:07] impersonate anyone
[33:09] just be what you are see and that's the
[33:12] way God made you never fashioned
[33:14] yourself Right.
[33:18] There's no self-made men. That's right.
[33:21] You didn't pick your parents.
[33:24] But guess what? God did. That's right.
[33:27] You never fashioned yourself. And
[33:29] remember, as much as we ministers would
[33:31] like to take Billy Graham's place, we
[33:33] cannot do it. Neither can Billy Graham
[33:35] take our place. See, we each one has
[33:37] something to do. the common little
[33:39] fellow here that may be a janitor, the
[33:41] little woman that may be a housewife,
[33:42] the greatest minister on the face of the
[33:44] earth today could not take your place.
[33:48] God had a purpose in making you what you
[33:50] are and you just serve God in the way
[33:52] that he made you. And I think if we
[33:55] would just do that, the wheels would
[33:57] roll a lot easier. Yes, it would. If we
[34:00] if we would do that and not get lifted
[34:02] up. Amen. Oh, that's so good. If you
[34:06] just be what God made you and then
[34:10] recognize that God made you and if you
[34:12] have any gifts, God placed them and if
[34:14] they operate, it's by his spirit. Amen.
[34:17] And so that you can't take credit for
[34:18] anything that even you get right because
[34:21] it's all God's doing because he
[34:23] fashioned you and set you up so you
[34:24] could do what he purposed you to do.
[34:27] Then he gave you of his gifts and he
[34:29] gave you of his spirit to operate those
[34:30] gifts to make sure you would go right.
[34:33] So you don't even go of your own power.
[34:34] It's the power of God. Amen. That brings
[34:36] things right. And then then if we would
[34:39] just do
[34:41] that, the wheels would roll a lot easier
[34:44] if we would if we would do that and not
[34:47] get lifted up.
[34:50] Amen. So, there's two sides we can't
[34:53] fall off of. We can't fall off the side
[34:56] of look how great I am. Look what I've
[34:58] done. Or I'm nothing. I'll never amount
[35:01] to anything. And there's no purpose for
[35:03] my life. Either one of these is wrong.
[35:05] Amen.
[35:07] Amen. Because both of those deny God.
[35:11] Yeah. Either way, if you get lifted up
[35:13] in pride or in pride, you overly abase
[35:17] yourself. You see, in pride, that's
[35:20] hidden pride. Overly abasing yourself is
[35:23] hidden pride.
[35:25] Because God didn't make you to be
[35:27] nothing.
[35:29] He made you and designed you and
[35:30] positionally placed you for a purpose.
[35:32] Amen. And that's God's purpose. And I
[35:35] wouldn't call that nothing.
[35:38] No matter what it is, I wouldn't call
[35:40] that nothing.
[35:43] Amen. There's a story that the prophet
[35:46] of God tells us, and I love the fact
[35:50] that God has set such an example in this
[35:52] generation so that we can glean so much
[35:56] wisdom and understanding from the life
[35:57] of a prophet. Amen. who came to that
[36:00] adoption maturity and we can look at
[36:02] that and we can learn and see how God
[36:04] dealt with the son and and learn and
[36:07] brother Ben Brandham comes to this place
[36:09] in his life he has a little 22 rifle
[36:13] that he loves and this little 22 rifle
[36:17] he's been shooting with it and he says
[36:19] he can he can shoot through the same
[36:22] hole nine shots through the same hole at
[36:24] 50 yards and he loves it and we all know
[36:27] that brother Ben was an expert expert
[36:29] marksman beyond expert. Amen. But he
[36:31] said something happened to the gun and
[36:33] it got off and he couldn't get it to
[36:35] shoot like that. So he tried to send it
[36:38] back I think to Winchester or wherever
[36:40] the company was and he talked to them
[36:42] there and and tried to talk to the ones
[36:43] who designed it and because something
[36:45] was wrong with his gun. He said he sent
[36:47] his scope away to have it miked and the
[36:48] scope was fine. And then the gun was
[36:50] shooting off and and then the people who
[36:53] made the gun, the rifle told him said
[36:55] that gun will only shoot a 1-in group at
[36:58] 25 yards. So 25 yards is not very far.
[37:01] And a 1-in group is a 1-in circle. So
[37:04] within a 1-in circle, you can shoot a
[37:06] group of however many shots it would
[37:08] hold. Nine shots presumably in a
[37:11] one-inch circle at 25 yards. Now, if I
[37:13] could do that, I'd be thrilled out of my
[37:16] mind. I would bring my target here. I
[37:19] would stick it on the bulletin board and
[37:20] write my name on it really
[37:23] big. But brother Random was so
[37:25] discouraged and disappointed because he
[37:27] knew that gun and he knew that he was
[37:30] driving tasks at 50 yards, nine shots
[37:32] through the same hole. And they said it
[37:34] can't be done. And and and I'm pulling
[37:36] from several times he tells this story
[37:38] so you can go back and read it into 1960
[37:40] and61. He talks about it many times, but
[37:44] his wife even tells him said, "Honey, if
[37:46] the man who's part of the company to
[37:48] design it said it won't do it, it won't
[37:49] do it." And Brother Benham said, "But I
[37:51] know it'll do it. I saw it do it
[37:52] myself." Yeah. So he's all upset. So
[37:56] then he's he's spending most of his
[37:58] hunting season, squinging season trying
[38:00] to get this gun dialed in because it's
[38:02] so important to him that it's exact.
[38:06] And he comes and he says this in one
[38:07] message. He says, "I sat down under a
[38:09] tree one morning and Brother Wood and
[38:11] Brother Charlie, that's Charlie Cox, who
[38:14] hunts with me and there was squirrels
[38:16] everywhere." Well, I shoot at one a
[38:18] couple days before that and I missed its
[38:21] eye. Hit way down on the cheek. Of
[38:24] course, it killed a squirrel as dead as
[38:26] it hit him in the eye, but the gun was
[38:28] out to me. It makes me nervous cuz it's
[38:30] the gun's not perfect and I don't do me
[38:32] no good to go hunting. He was just
[38:35] aiming. You know how big a squirrel's
[38:37] head is? You know it's like that big.
[38:38] I've done a lot of squirrel hunting. And
[38:40] the eyes right here and the cheek. He
[38:42] says way down here.
[38:45] Way down. Like less than half an inch.
[38:52] Oh my. Way down on the cheek and killed
[38:57] it. I mean, if I shot it anywhere in the
[39:00] head, I'm like, "Oh, it's a head shot."
[39:02] You know? So then he goes on and says,
[39:06] "I was sitting back there under the tree
[39:07] listening to Charlie over there just
[39:09] banging
[39:10] away." Then I I they I don't care what
[39:14] they don't care what end of the squirrel
[39:16] they
[39:17] shoot. Just so they shot squirrels. If
[39:20] their gun was grouping anyway, just so
[39:21] it hit the squirrel. If it was in the
[39:23] hips or in the mid center or anywhere it
[39:25] hit him, that was all right. I don't see
[39:28] anything wrong with that.
[39:30] I've shot probably hundreds of squirrels
[39:33] in the last several years and I will
[39:35] shoot them anywhere I can hit them.
[39:37] Trust me. We went hitting at We went
[39:40] hunting at brother Jean Petri's not too
[39:42] long ago, me and my boys and we come out
[39:45] of the woods at lunchtime and brother
[39:46] Jean Petri goes, "It sounded like there
[39:48] was an army in my
[39:50] woods. We take a lot of bullets when we
[39:54] go." Amen. So, I hunt like Charlie Cox
[39:59] and like brother Wood. But, Brother
[40:01] Benham couldn't do it. Here's what he
[40:04] said. I just couldn't stand that. I sat
[40:06] down there. I thought, just look at the
[40:08] fun them fellas are having. And they
[40:10] love to hunt just as well as I do. And
[40:12] they're both fine, good shots. They're
[40:13] dandy men. Both of them Christians,
[40:15] filled with the Holy Ghost, just fine
[40:17] men. Some of the highest caliber men.
[40:19] And them brothers up there was having
[40:20] the most fun shooting squirrels. And
[40:22] there was squirrels jumping through the
[40:24] trees right by me.
[40:26] sat there and and here I am sitting here
[40:29] crying, just tears running down my
[40:32] face. There they are. And here I I can't
[40:36] even hit the target. And I raised up and
[40:38] I said, "Heavenly Father, why did you
[40:39] make me like this?" A little nervous,
[40:42] upset person. And then your grace has
[40:44] given me literally millions of friends.
[40:46] See? And I said, "Why would you make me
[40:47] a person like this?" And I started
[40:49] weeping right out loud then sitting
[40:51] under a little leaning tree.
[40:54] See, he doesn't even understand
[40:58] himself. He He knows that them brothers
[41:01] of his are good men. They're Holy
[41:03] Ghostfilled Christian men, godly men
[41:05] having fun. And brother Ram even says in
[41:07] one place, "The only way I can get to
[41:09] relax my mind is come down here hunting
[41:11] and I can't even enjoy it." He's talking
[41:12] to God because I'm so nervous and so
[41:15] tore up and I'm so upset because my
[41:17] gun's not exact. And he knew in himself
[41:22] that it was I wouldn't say it would say
[41:24] ridiculous, but it was so
[41:27] uh so I don't even know what the word
[41:30] is. It was like overly accurate. Not
[41:34] necessary. But for him, he couldn't
[41:37] stand it. He couldn't take it. the
[41:39] thought of missing and wounding an
[41:41] animal and not not making a clean kill
[41:43] and the whole thing, the gun being out,
[41:45] knowing it shouldn't be, it it tore him
[41:47] up and he couldn't he couldn't deal with
[41:49] it. And he's weeping. Listen, this is a
[41:52] grown man sitting in the woods weeping
[41:55] because he doesn't know why he's like
[41:57] this. He wasn't weeping because he
[42:00] didn't shoot a squirrel. Yeah, he was
[42:02] weeping because he was so nervous and
[42:03] tore up and he didn't understand why it
[42:05] bothered him so bad and why he's like
[42:08] the way he is.
[42:10] So, and after sitting there a little bit
[42:13] kind of held my head over, I heard him
[42:15] speak to
[42:16] me. So, well then he was speaking to me
[42:19] and he said, "I made you that way for a
[42:22] purpose."
[42:24] Amen. And I said, "Why did you make me
[42:27] that way, Lord, for a purpose? To be
[42:29] nervous." And the only thing I have to
[42:32] relax me out of the meetings is come
[42:33] here and hunt. And God makes everything
[42:36] work right for them that love him. See,
[42:38] I wanted to tell He wanted to tell me
[42:41] something. That's how that gun had to go
[42:43] out to get this very thing to me.
[42:47] Brother B says God let his gun get out.
[42:49] Yeah. God had him weeping under a tree
[42:52] because God wanted to teach him a
[42:53] lesson. And he says, "God, why did you
[42:55] make me like this?" And then he said, "I
[42:56] heard God speak to me." He says, "I made
[42:59] you that way for a purpose." And then
[43:02] Brother Bam's telling us God let all of
[43:04] that happen. Yeah. So he could learn a
[43:07] lesson about himself. Yeah. Amen.
[43:12] He says, "That's the reason I made you
[43:14] that way. I made you that way for a
[43:17] purpose." Well, there's where he made
[43:20] known to me then. He made me that way on
[43:23] account of the commission that he's
[43:25] given me for these last days that I'm
[43:26] living in that I just can't go to a
[43:28] denominational church and join up with
[43:30] one when they'll just splatter. Well,
[43:32] the church says this and all right and
[43:34] they accept this. If Jesus Christ is the
[43:37] same yesterday, today, and forever. If
[43:39] it drove the bullet there, it'll drive
[43:41] it again. I don't care what they say.
[43:43] There's got to be some way that he is
[43:45] the same person. He's the same thing.
[43:48] His power is the same. Amen. Now, most
[43:51] people say, "Well, my church teaches be
[43:53] baptized in the name of Father, Son, and
[43:55] Holy Ghost. The seminary I came out of
[43:57] taught me that, so that's the way I'll
[43:58] do it." To me, that's not right. I'm
[44:02] hitting over here and hitting over
[44:04] there. I I'm making 40in group. That
[44:06] ain't making the scriptures right. It's
[44:08] got to zero. It's got to zero. Well,
[44:11] then how's it going to zero? When
[44:13] Matthew said, "Baptize in the name of
[44:15] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." And Peter
[44:16] said, "Baptize in the name of the Lord
[44:18] Jesus." Both of them disciples, one a
[44:20] scribe and the other one's an apostle.
[44:22] So, Brother Bams, now now he's
[44:23] understanding why God made him this way.
[44:26] Why he's sitting under a tree weeping
[44:28] cuz his guns out. Why he's working for
[44:30] weeks and weeks to try to get it dialed
[44:32] in. Why it matters so much to him and
[44:34] doesn't matter to his friends. Why they
[44:36] can have fun and he's nervous and upset.
[44:38] God said, "I made you that way for a
[44:40] purpose." And brother Bam said, "Then he
[44:42] showed me it's because of my commission.
[44:43] I have to have the word zeroed and
[44:46] through the bullseye every time. We
[44:48] can't take the word and hit it here and
[44:49] hit it here and maybe here. We can't do
[44:51] like the denominations. Well, it res
[44:53] really doesn't matter as long as as you
[44:55] accept God, you can have this and you
[44:57] can have this. He says, "No, if it's
[44:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[45:00] every word's got to line right up." And
[45:03] because God called him to be a prophet
[45:05] to the age, he designed him. Yeah.
[45:09] Listen, I I would just want you to share
[45:11] this with this is not a spiritual thing.
[45:13] This is a natural design.
[45:16] This is a natural makeup. This is the
[45:18] way God designed him and put the
[45:20] ingredients together to make him this
[45:22] way genetically and seasoned him and
[45:25] shaped him this way because God had to
[45:28] have a man who could not stand
[45:30] inaccuracy. Amen.
[45:33] But he said Charlie Cox and Brother
[45:35] Wood, he says they're Holy Ghost
[45:37] fililled men of God, real Christians,
[45:39] and they can just bang away and have
[45:41] fun. I'm so glad, Amen, that God didn't
[45:43] make me the way he had brother Ben
[45:44] Brandon because I would never go
[45:46] squirrel hunting.
[45:50] But God h this way. Amen. And he didn't
[45:54] even understand himself.
[45:57] And what I come to
[45:59] understand is maybe sometimes we don't
[46:01] understand ourselves. That's right.
[46:03] Amen. Maybe sometimes we've been maybe
[46:07] not leaning under a tree crying, but
[46:08] maybe we've been in our bedroom crying.
[46:11] Maybe we've been in our car crying.
[46:13] Maybe we felt so different than
[46:14] everybody around us. So wrong. So out of
[46:20] sequence, so whatever bothers us doesn't
[46:23] seem to bother others. And why am I like
[46:25] this? And why am I like that? And why am
[46:27] I not more like this brother? Why can't
[46:28] I be like this one? And and
[46:32] why? Maybe the answer is the same for
[46:35] us. That's right as it was for brother
[46:37] Brandon.
[46:39] Maybe he designed us this way for his
[46:42] purpose.
[46:43] Maybe the things that we've wept over is
[46:46] part of God's purpose for our life.
[46:49] Maybe the things we would have changed
[46:50] if we could, God didn't want changed.
[46:54] Right.
[46:56] Praise God. We were fearfully and
[46:58] wonderfully made.
[47:02] Amen. Maybe he didn't make a mistake
[47:05] when he chose us.
[47:08] Maybe he wasn't in error when he picked
[47:11] us for the job. Amen. That's right.
[47:13] Praise God. Maybe he knew what he was
[47:15] doing. Maybe he foresaw you and designed
[47:18] you and gave you a certain nature and
[47:20] certain parents and a certain
[47:22] upbringing, a certain way because he
[47:24] needs you to be a certain way. He needs
[47:26] your bell to have a certain ting.
[47:29] And you've always maybe ting just a
[47:32] little different than others around you
[47:33] and always was felt awkward at your
[47:35] ting.
[47:37] Everybody, their ting sounds beautiful
[47:40] to me. mine just sounds hollow and tingy
[47:43] and tiny and I don't like
[47:46] it. You don't realize to somebody else's
[47:48] ear, your ting sounds just right.
[47:53] This is the way we all view each other.
[47:54] This is the problem with humanity. Amen.
[47:57] We always look at somebody else and
[47:58] that's the way to be and that's the
[48:00] correct and this is that's a real
[48:02] Christian and that's that's the way you
[48:04] should be.
[48:07] There's nothing wrong with respecting
[48:08] one another and appreciating one
[48:09] another, but when it causes you to hate
[48:12] the way God made you, then maybe we're
[48:15] missing the point. Maybe we're not
[48:17] getting the right picture yet.
[48:20] Brother Ben said this. He says, "Yet men
[48:23] and women live a good life, love God by
[48:26] mental conception, but the real hiding
[48:28] place is in the heart hid with Christ.
[48:30] And when Christ the Holy Spirit comes
[48:31] into you, he is in you with your
[48:34] temperament. Yes, sir. And he's living
[48:36] his own life through his own will,
[48:37] through you. He didn't say he changes
[48:40] your temperament. He's with you with
[48:42] your temperament.
[48:44] Brother man was talking about being out
[48:46] in the woods and he he's talking about
[48:47] he heard an elk bugle after a storm and
[48:50] he heard I think it was a wolf howl and
[48:52] he says all of a sudden he said, "That
[48:53] just thrilled me. That does something to
[48:55] me." He said, "My conversion never took
[48:57] that out of me. That's right. His love
[49:00] for the wild and his love for the
[49:01] wilderness, his conversion never took it
[49:03] out of him. Amen. Because it didn't need
[49:06] to come out of him. Amen. There was
[49:08] anything wrong with it. It was part of
[49:10] his makeup.
[49:13] Amen. Oh, if God could just help us all
[49:17] to be happy the way he made us,
[49:21] if we could all just get to the place
[49:23] where we could say, "I'm fearfully and
[49:25] wonderfully made." Thank you, Lord. We
[49:27] know that there's negative things that
[49:29] come off of that tree. We understand
[49:31] that. But God has given us of his spirit
[49:33] and he gives us of his word to avoid
[49:34] those things. But not everything in our
[49:36] makeup is wrong. In fact, if everything
[49:38] in our makeup is wrong, then God somehow
[49:40] has failed. And I don't believe God's
[49:43] failed.
[49:44] So, we need to get to the place where we
[49:47] can just relax. Amen. And be what he
[49:50] made us. Amen.
[49:52] If we could all get to this place where
[49:53] we could relax and be what he made us
[49:56] and just be comfortable in our own skin
[49:58] and and settle into what God has done
[50:01] and the way he's designed it, way he's
[50:02] made us and not think it's all wrong,
[50:04] but think that maybe there's a purpose
[50:05] and behind it, maybe we could get some
[50:07] complexes to fall off. Maybe we could
[50:10] get some comparisons just to go to to
[50:12] rest. Amen. Because the Bible says Jesus
[50:15] says, "You do air comparing yourselves
[50:17] among yourselves." Amen. I'm not
[50:19] supposed to compare myself against you.
[50:21] I'm supposed to compare myself against
[50:22] the word. Amen.
[50:26] Sometimes I get discouraged comparing
[50:28] myself against another brother. Amen.
[50:31] Because God designed you to express a
[50:33] certain portion of his life, but not
[50:36] all. There was only one human being
[50:38] expressed it all, and that was Jesus
[50:39] Christ. Amen.
[50:41] But you're designed to express a facet,
[50:44] a part, a picture, a an aspect of God's
[50:47] nature. And God designed you that way.
[50:50] And the very designing for that means he
[50:52] could not make you uh able to accomplish
[50:55] everything and he could not make you
[50:56] good at everything. If there's something
[50:58] that he made you that you could
[50:59] accomplish for his kingdom and do for
[51:01] his glory, that means he had to leave
[51:03] something out. Yeah. And we all have
[51:07] areas that were no good. Yeah. That we
[51:10] can't do.
[51:12] Amen. And sometimes the devil tricks us
[51:16] into fixating on those
[51:18] things. I can't do anything. All these
[51:21] brothers at the church, they can build,
[51:22] they can work, they're craftsman. I
[51:24] can't I I I have two hands full of
[51:26] thumbs and I can't make
[51:28] anything. Well, so what? Maybe God
[51:31] doesn't want you to build anything.
[51:34] I can tell you this, and I have I'm not
[51:36] ashamed to say it. I cannot sing and I
[51:38] cannot play instruments.
[51:40] Is that a news flash?
[51:43] Are you guys
[51:46] surprised? I spent one year of my life
[51:48] when I turned 18. One year of my life
[51:50] and $400 and some
[51:52] dollars trying to learn to play the
[51:55] guitar. At the end of that year, I was
[51:58] 400 and some odd dollars poor and I
[52:00] couldn't play nothing.
[52:07] And I practiced. Don't tell me I didn't
[52:09] practice.
[52:11] So you who says you can do anything? No,
[52:13] you can't do anything. You can't do
[52:16] anything. I tried. I practiced. I
[52:18] committed myself. I went to all my
[52:20] lessons. I paid for them out of my own
[52:22] pocket.
[52:24] I tried and I couldn't play anything
[52:27] because that was never God's plan for
[52:29] me.
[52:30] So God never put that in me. Amen.
[52:35] What if I get discouraged today and say,
[52:36] "You know what? I'm so tired of
[52:38] everybody else being so talented. And
[52:41] I'm not. I'm done with studying the
[52:44] Bible and studying the message. I'm
[52:45] going to commit all my time to learning
[52:47] to play instruments and sing.
[52:52] I'm done preaching. I don't like it. I'm
[52:54] done with the reading. I'm done with the
[52:56] meditating. I'm done. I'm going to put
[52:58] all my time into learning an instrument
[53:00] because I want to be like these other
[53:02] brothers.
[53:03] Do you think the body would suffer? Yes.
[53:06] And do you think I'd learn to play an
[53:07] instrument? No. No. It would accomplish
[53:10] nothing.
[53:12] Because that's not what God built me
[53:13] for. I There's a lot of things I'm not
[53:15] good at, but there's something that I'm
[53:17] built for.
[53:18] And that's what we got to yield
[53:20] ourselves to and be comfortable with the
[53:21] things that we're not good at. And be
[53:24] okay saying, "I can't do that. Everybody
[53:27] else is better at that than me. I can't
[53:29] do it." What's wrong with that?
[53:33] Everybody has something that God's given
[53:35] you to make you a success in what he
[53:37] wants you to do. And there's something
[53:40] you can do as good or better than
[53:41] anybody else, but you can't do it all.
[53:44] And you never will. But if you're not
[53:46] doing that part, you're hindering all of
[53:49] us. So when we fixate on what we can't
[53:52] be, we stop becoming what we are.
[53:56] We fixate and we worry and we struggle
[53:58] and we compare and we grumble and we we
[54:01] dislike ourselves and we get
[54:03] discouraged. But listen, that's all
[54:05] that's just trapping of the devil.
[54:07] That's just to keep us from the real
[54:08] purpose. What we need to do is relax.
[54:11] Amen. Because what God placed in you to
[54:14] do, he placed in you to do. It comes
[54:16] natural. Amen. It just comes. You ever
[54:19] seen somebody Listen, I I I tell
[54:22] you, David Lamb over there, he kind of
[54:25] makes me a little bit
[54:27] sick. I can't play nothing. He can pick
[54:30] up an instrument he's never touched
[54:32] before. In 30 minutes, he can be
[54:33] squeaking out and playing a song. Amen.
[54:35] Somebody had a violin the other day. He
[54:37] never played a violin before. He doesn't
[54:38] know how to hold it. He's holding it
[54:40] wrong right here. And he's playing a
[54:46] song. But you know what? He didn't work
[54:48] for it.
[54:50] He didn't work. He didn't pay. He didn't
[54:53] labor. It just came.
[54:56] It just came. Amen. He can't help it.
[55:00] And it doesn't mean the things God gives
[55:02] us do, we don't work at them. Sometimes
[55:03] we do work at them. Sometimes we put
[55:05] forth effort. But the effort we put
[55:06] forth is somewhat enjoyable because
[55:08] we're designed to do it. It doesn't mean
[55:10] that there's no work, no effort, no
[55:12] learning, no growing, no getting better.
[55:14] But all of those things we're enjoying
[55:16] because that's the way we're made,
[55:17] right? Amen.
[55:20] So I can't do that. Give me 30 minutes
[55:24] and a violin and you don't want to be in
[55:26] the room 30 minutes later.
[55:30] But oh, if God could help us just relax
[55:34] and just to be what we are,
[55:37] stop trying to conform or stop trying to
[55:40] be what we imagine we're supposed to be.
[55:43] Because what we're supposed to be is
[55:44] what he ordained us to be. And what he
[55:46] ordained us to be, he's designed us to
[55:48] fit that mold. And we'll never fit into
[55:51] another one. We'll never fit in our
[55:52] brother's mold. We'll never fit in our
[55:53] sister's mold. We're only ever going to
[55:55] fit in ours.
[55:57] So, if we could just relax. Amen.
[56:00] I believe this message came to put us in
[56:03] position.
[56:05] I believe this message came for all of
[56:06] us to get in position. And I believe
[56:08] this message came to take away every
[56:10] barrier that's a barrier to us
[56:11] fulfilling our purpose. That's right.
[56:13] And if that barrier is in our mind, then
[56:15] this word will take that barrier out of
[56:17] our mind. If it's if it's somewhere else
[56:19] around us, a restriction. I believe this
[56:21] message came to take away the barriers
[56:23] of denomination, the barriers of
[56:24] misunderstanding, the barriers of false
[56:26] doctrine, and even the barriers of our
[56:28] own wrong understanding about ourselves.
[56:30] Amen. Yeah. To strip those barriers away
[56:34] so we could just be comfortable in our
[56:37] own skin.
[56:39] We know there's things that aren't
[56:40] right, but it's going to change. So,
[56:42] don't worry about it. There's a body
[56:43] change coming. Until then, he's given us
[56:45] a spirit to give us the power to
[56:46] overcome. Amen. And there will be a body
[56:49] change.
[56:51] So he's with you. He's in you with your
[56:55] temperament. Hebrews 13:5, "Let your
[56:58] conversation be without covetousness,
[57:00] and be content with such things as you
[57:01] have, for he hath said, I will never
[57:03] leave thee nor forsake thee." Amen. I
[57:07] love this. And then he tells his
[57:09] disciples in Matthew 28:19, "Go ye
[57:11] therefore and teach all nations,
[57:12] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[57:14] and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
[57:15] teaching them to observe all things
[57:17] whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I
[57:20] am with you always, even to the end of
[57:23] the world." So where is Christ? If
[57:27] you've been born again, where is he?
[57:28] He's in you. He's with you with your
[57:31] temperament. And he promised never to
[57:33] leave you, to be with you always. Yeah.
[57:36] Amen. Amen. So he must like you.
[57:44] If he wants to be with you, he must like
[57:46] you. So why would you hate what he
[57:49] likes?
[57:53] It's so
[57:54] good. Brother Beam says this in things
[57:56] that are to be said, in my father's
[58:00] house are many kinds of mansions. I
[58:03] don't believe when we get to heaven that
[58:04] we will be just everybody look just
[58:06] exactly alike. I don't believe that all
[58:08] will be blondes or brunettes or little
[58:10] or all big or all giants. I believe that
[58:12] God is a god of variety. The world
[58:14] proves that. He's got big mountains,
[58:16] little mountains. He's got plains. He's
[58:18] got deserts. He's got different things
[58:19] because he made it the way he wanted it.
[58:22] And he made the seasons. Summer, winter,
[58:24] spring, autumn. He made the seasons. It
[58:26] shows he's got a God of variety. He made
[58:28] you in a variety. Some men are real
[58:31] blusterous and some are real dogmatic
[58:33] and others are fine, others are kind.
[58:35] And you just find all different kinds of
[58:37] people in his kingdom. See, so God's not
[58:40] cookie cutter. Bang bang bang bang. We
[58:42] all have to be the certain way. Yeah.
[58:45] That's denominational thinking. Amen. We
[58:47] want to get rid of that. Yeah. Amen.
[58:49] Amen. He's got all kinds in his kingdom.
[58:52] Said look at St. Peter and judge him by
[58:54] Andrew. See, Andrew is the prayer
[58:56] warrior. Just stay on his knees all the
[58:58] time. And the Apostle Peter was one of
[58:59] those fire brands that preached and so
[59:01] forth. And Paul was more scholarly like
[59:03] like the prophet or something that set
[59:06] back. Praise God. I like that.
[59:11] Amen. I was looking for something
[59:13] here. Brother Beam
[59:16] said, "Yeah, I want to go to this next
[59:19] quote." He says, "Like many kinds of
[59:22] hills, like many kinds of rivers." No, I
[59:25] don't want to read that yet. I'm
[59:26] stopping.
[59:28] I love having the
[59:30] power so you can't read any
[59:34] farther.
[59:36] So when he talks about Peter, Peter was
[59:40] just a fire brand. Just got a thought
[59:42] and went with it.
[59:44] Didn't calculate, didn't analyze, he
[59:46] just got it and he went. Andrew was the
[59:49] prayer warrior. He sat back and prayed.
[59:51] Uh uh Paul was a little different. He
[59:52] was scholarly like like a prophet
[59:54] something. to set
[59:57] back and which one was better than the
[59:59] other, right? Which one was more
[1:00:02] important and more valuable to the
[1:00:03] kingdom of God? Which one was right and
[1:00:05] which one was wrong? Yeah.
[1:00:09] Oh, praise God. You know, when we all
[1:00:12] try to be like each other, we're going
[1:00:14] to just fall into a trap. And we're
[1:00:15] going to fall into a trap of
[1:00:16] discouragement
[1:00:18] because we can't do it. You know,
[1:00:20] there's some among us who who are gifted
[1:00:22] in intercessory prayer and they can pray
[1:00:26] for hours on end, but it's not because
[1:00:28] of effort. It's not because they said,
[1:00:31] "I'm going to pray for two hours and so
[1:00:33] I get that." No. When it falls on them,
[1:00:35] it just falls on them. They go into
[1:00:36] intercessory prayer. They pray for that
[1:00:38] period of time and they're surprised.
[1:00:41] Yes. Sister Lann's one of them. She
[1:00:44] texts me all the time. I God woke me up
[1:00:45] at 3:00 in the morning. I prayed till
[1:00:47] 5:30.
[1:00:49] didn't even lost track of time, lost
[1:00:50] track of everything. And God will bring
[1:00:51] a name to her. God will bring a face to
[1:00:53] her and she'll just pray for that.
[1:00:54] That's that's intercessory prayer for
[1:00:57] her. It's no work. And though she's
[1:00:59] tired at the end, though she's labored,
[1:01:00] though she's wore out, it just comes
[1:01:02] natural for her. Now, you decide you you
[1:01:05] listen to Sister Lan give you a
[1:01:06] testimony. Say, "God woke me up at 1:32
[1:01:09] in the morning and I prayed for two
[1:01:10] hours." And you think, "That's really
[1:01:11] good. I should do that."
[1:01:15] Set your alarm for 1:30 in the morning.
[1:01:17] get up and decide to pray for two hours,
[1:01:19] I promise you, you're going to be a
[1:01:21] failure
[1:01:22] because you're trying to fit somebody
[1:01:24] else's mold and you're trying to do
[1:01:26] something according to your own thinking
[1:01:28] that that's right. That's the way to
[1:01:30] intercessory repair. And we need more of
[1:01:31] that. Listen, if we need more of that,
[1:01:33] God will inspire more of that. And if
[1:01:35] God inspires you, you'll pray and you
[1:01:37] won't know how long it took. Or God will
[1:01:39] move on your heart. And even if you
[1:01:40] labor and pray, it's because God moved
[1:01:41] you to pray. Amen. Amen. You see,
[1:01:44] understand we got to quit trying to be
[1:01:46] like someone else or quit trying to do
[1:01:48] what we think is the best thing to do. I
[1:01:50] think Peter was the best. I'll model
[1:01:52] after Peter. I don't like Andrew. Andrew
[1:01:54] I come on. He had 12 disciples and they
[1:01:58] were all very different from one
[1:01:59] another. And in the Gospels, you can see
[1:02:01] the differences. John was so different.
[1:02:03] Amen. Than Andrew. John was so different
[1:02:05] than Philip. Philip was so different
[1:02:07] than Peter. Yeah. Which one was right
[1:02:09] and which one was wrong? God's the one
[1:02:11] who chose each one of them. He said,
[1:02:12] "You haven't chosen me. I've chosen
[1:02:14] you." So, he chose who he wanted to fill
[1:02:16] the position. He chose a Peter who was a
[1:02:19] little hotheaded and a little quick on
[1:02:20] the trigger. But he chose him. Amen.
[1:02:24] And under the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:26] Spirit, he could quench some of that and
[1:02:28] channel it in the right way. Yeah. But
[1:02:31] he never completely changed Peter. Peter
[1:02:33] was Peter till the day he died
[1:02:36] when they went to hang Peter on a cross.
[1:02:38] Amen. The same one who was always
[1:02:41] boisterous, the one who was always bold,
[1:02:43] he says, "I don't even want to die the
[1:02:45] same way. Hang me upside down."
[1:02:48] Yeah. I mean, if they were going to go
[1:02:49] hang me on cross, I'd just go like this
[1:02:51] and go get hung on the cross. I wouldn't
[1:02:52] even think to tell them and command them
[1:02:54] and make them, right? But it was Peter's
[1:02:57] nature. Amen.
[1:03:01] You can't copy anybody else. But neither
[1:03:04] can anybody copy you. That's right. Just
[1:03:07] be happy the way you are. Yeah.
[1:03:09] Sometimes I get so heartbroken when I
[1:03:11] see preachers apologizing all the time
[1:03:13] for the way they preach.
[1:03:16] I'm sorry for this. I'm sorry for that.
[1:03:17] Is it okay? Listen, we shouldn't have
[1:03:21] these complexes in our mind. Just relax
[1:03:23] and be what God called you to be.
[1:03:26] What we need is what you are. We don't
[1:03:29] need you to fit into some other mold. We
[1:03:31] just need you to be like you are. Amen.
[1:03:34] Amen.
[1:03:35] So don't apologize for being the way you
[1:03:38] are unless the way you are is like
[1:03:42] wrong. Repent. You know, you can't say
[1:03:45] everything you ever do is wonderful.
[1:03:47] Don't don't get that far down the road.
[1:03:49] You know, there's a balance to
[1:03:50] everything. Well, God made me this way.
[1:03:52] And if I Yeah. No, listen. We got to
[1:03:55] bring everything subject to the word,
[1:03:58] right? You can go overboard with
[1:04:00] anything. Amen.
[1:04:01] But don't
[1:04:03] apologize for being what you are because
[1:04:05] God made you that way.
[1:04:08] Only apologize when you've offended.
[1:04:10] Only apologize when you've left the
[1:04:11] word. Only apologize when you went too
[1:04:13] far. But don't apologize just for being
[1:04:16] you. Because that's what we need. We
[1:04:18] need you to be you. We want you to be
[1:04:20] you.
[1:04:22] And I want to be me and I want you to be
[1:04:23] you. And I don't want a complex. I don't
[1:04:25] want you to have a complex.
[1:04:28] I don't want I don't want anybody to be
[1:04:29] criticized for being what they are.
[1:04:32] Criticism is one of the deadliest
[1:04:34] things. Amen. In the world. Amen.
[1:04:37] Because undue criticism binds people and
[1:04:40] keeps them from fully expressing what
[1:04:42] they are because they become afraid to
[1:04:44] be criticized again.
[1:04:48] And let's not be critical of one
[1:04:50] another. Let's just love one another and
[1:04:52] appreciate one another. That's right.
[1:04:54] Amen. Brother Rem said, "If your
[1:04:55] brother, if you think he's a little
[1:04:56] wrong, then you just pray for him."
[1:04:58] That's right. Not criticize him. Just
[1:05:01] pray for him. And you might find out
[1:05:03] he's not a little wrong. He might be
[1:05:05] just right. We got to be careful how we
[1:05:08] treat each other because if God designed
[1:05:09] us a certain way and he placed a portion
[1:05:11] of his attribute in us to express a
[1:05:13] certain way, then we got to be careful
[1:05:15] the way we talk about each other.
[1:05:18] We got to be careful even way we talk
[1:05:20] about children
[1:05:22] and way we treat them. If God designed
[1:05:24] them and God called them and they're
[1:05:26] there to express God, we got to be
[1:05:28] careful. We got to appreciate, value
[1:05:32] each other, and even value differences
[1:05:36] because that makes us stronger. If we're
[1:05:38] all the same, we all think the same, we
[1:05:40] all do the same, we all go the same. At
[1:05:42] some point, we may all go the same way
[1:05:45] wrong. Right.
[1:05:48] Sometimes it takes somebody with a
[1:05:49] different perspective, point of view,
[1:05:50] history, makeup to say, "Are we are you
[1:05:53] sure?"
[1:05:55] That's what we want to do. Those things
[1:05:57] are healthy. And God makes sure that he
[1:06:00] puts all the ingredients together to
[1:06:01] keep the body healthy. Gives us the
[1:06:04] right hand and the left hand so we don't
[1:06:06] go in
[1:06:07] circles. Amen. God is good. So, we can't
[1:06:13] copy. We can't manufacture. If we try to
[1:06:16] do anything than be anything what we
[1:06:18] are, we're a hypocrite.
[1:06:21] Brother said, I'd rather it's it's I'd
[1:06:24] rather be an infidel than a hypocrite. I
[1:06:25] can't believe that he said that.
[1:06:29] But a hypocrite is a fake. Yeah. And we
[1:06:32] just want to be real. Amen. We want to
[1:06:35] be
[1:06:36] real. Brother Beam says this in things
[1:06:39] that are to be like many kinds of hills,
[1:06:41] like many kinds of rivers, lakes, they
[1:06:45] were here when you come here first
[1:06:46] because the kindness of your heavenly
[1:06:48] father placed them here. Because some
[1:06:50] men like mountains, some people like
[1:06:52] waters, some like deserts, some you see
[1:06:55] you're coming. You see you're coming. He
[1:06:58] knew your nature and what you would be.
[1:07:00] So he made it just the way that you
[1:07:02] could enjoy it. Oh, I think that's a
[1:07:05] wonderful father.
[1:07:07] know that he made it like this. I'm glad
[1:07:10] he made mountains. I like the mountains
[1:07:12] and I like that. Where the others, oh, I
[1:07:14] can't stand it. Oh, we just have He must
[1:07:17] have just emptied out his mortar box out
[1:07:18] there. Well, he emptied it out so I
[1:07:20] could enjoy it. You see? So then they
[1:07:22] say, I like the planes where I can see a
[1:07:24] long ways. Well, the two different
[1:07:26] natures, both of us Christians, but the
[1:07:28] father knew that you would be here and
[1:07:30] prepared everything for you before you
[1:07:32] got here. Amen. Your first coming here,
[1:07:34] he had it ready for you when you got
[1:07:35] here. Isn't that marvelous to think of
[1:07:38] what he'd done?
[1:07:40] God made a
[1:07:42] variety of topography. Yeah.
[1:07:46] To match the v variety of the natures he
[1:07:49] would place on the earth. Absolutely. I
[1:07:51] think that's amazing. Because God didn't
[1:07:54] expect us all to like mountains.
[1:07:57] He didn't expect us all to like plains.
[1:08:00] He didn't expect us all to like the
[1:08:01] ocean. He knew some of us would like the
[1:08:04] mountains better than the plains. the
[1:08:05] plains better than the ocean.
[1:08:08] And there's nothing wrong with that. You
[1:08:10] say it's all God's creation. You You
[1:08:12] love it equally.
[1:08:14] That's not what brother Brandon said.
[1:08:16] God made it this way to suit you.
[1:08:20] So that you could enjoy it. Amen. That's
[1:08:23] a loving father. He doesn't want us all
[1:08:26] the same.
[1:08:28] He doesn't even make his earth all the
[1:08:31] same so that each of us can enjoy a
[1:08:33] different part of his creation because
[1:08:36] of the way he made us. Oh, I just love
[1:08:39] that we can argue all day long. Uh God
[1:08:43] is like the mountains. His love is like
[1:08:45] the mountains. That's what the scripture
[1:08:46] says. You should like
[1:08:47] mountains. What does the Bible say about
[1:08:52] plains? But God made it that way for you
[1:08:54] and me.
[1:08:56] Hey, listen. Me and my wife don't agree
[1:08:59] on this. Brother Bam said he and his
[1:09:02] wife don't agree on everything. They
[1:09:03] don't agree on cherry pie and apple pie,
[1:09:05] right? And we don't agree on this. My
[1:09:06] wife loves to stand and see as far as
[1:09:08] you at the ocean side. She wants to see
[1:09:11] or a plane or a field as far as you can
[1:09:13] see. She loves it. I don't like it at
[1:09:16] all. I feel like I'm totally exposed.
[1:09:18] Too many people can see me. I want to be
[1:09:20] up on a holler in the woods somewhere
[1:09:22] hid away where nobody can see me. Where
[1:09:24] I'm 10t away and you can't find me. She
[1:09:26] doesn't like that at all. She wants full
[1:09:28] bright sunshine as far as you can see.
[1:09:31] So when we go on vacation, I always try
[1:09:32] to find a cabin in the woods by a
[1:09:35] lake. She can sit on the dock and I can
[1:09:37] sit up in the cabin and we're both
[1:09:40] happy. And I might walk down to the dock
[1:09:42] a little bit and she might come back to
[1:09:43] the
[1:09:44] cabin. But we can't help it. That's just
[1:09:47] the way we are. We compromise sometimes
[1:09:50] and go with each other,
[1:09:52] but through the ocean once and I didn't
[1:09:54] like it at all.
[1:09:58] But you can
[1:10:00] see that's the way God made us. So just
[1:10:04] be what you are
[1:10:06] and just like what you like and don't
[1:10:09] like what you don't like and it's okay.
[1:10:12] It's okay. Listen, you can have a
[1:10:15] favorite style of preaching.
[1:10:19] It's okay.
[1:10:21] You can like it fiery. You can like it
[1:10:23] teaching. You can like it slow. You can
[1:10:26] like it fast. You You can have a
[1:10:28] favorite style of preaching. That's
[1:10:30] okay. Amen. You can have a type of
[1:10:33] ministry you feed from better than
[1:10:35] others. It's not discounting another,
[1:10:36] but that's the way God made you. That's
[1:10:38] why God has a variety of preachers, a
[1:10:40] variety of churches, a variety of
[1:10:41] pastors, a five-fold ministry.
[1:10:45] Don't feel ashamed of that.
[1:10:47] Say, I I do better under this kind of
[1:10:50] ministry. It suits my nature. There's
[1:10:51] nothing wrong with that. It's not
[1:10:53] discounting another one. Right. Right.
[1:10:55] Amen. It's not saying the other's wrong.
[1:10:57] It's just saying this is the way God
[1:10:58] wired me and this is where God placed
[1:11:00] me.
[1:11:02] Listen, don't be ashamed of that. Don't
[1:11:04] say, "I love it when that brother comes
[1:11:05] through because I just connect with his
[1:11:07] preaching." You're not going to hurt my
[1:11:08] feelings any because that's that's why
[1:11:10] we ask brothers to come through because
[1:11:12] we're not all the same.
[1:11:14] So don't be ashamed of being you.
[1:11:18] Don't be embarrassed because that's the
[1:11:21] way you like it. Amen. There's nothing
[1:11:24] wrong with it.
[1:11:26] Here's something Brother Brandham says.
[1:11:27] He says in blind Barnameus, he goes, "I
[1:11:30] can be thankful that he's he's kept me
[1:11:32] true to mortal life and so forth. And
[1:11:34] there's only one thing that I do that I
[1:11:36] know of that's outside of religious
[1:11:37] work. And I do love to go fishing and
[1:11:39] hunting. I just love that. And I'm glad
[1:11:42] that he lets me have that because it's
[1:11:44] out in the outdoors and clean. and how I
[1:11:47] love to go out on the creek bank,
[1:11:48] especially a little later in the season
[1:11:50] when it's warm and fish and go up into
[1:11:52] the mountains and be alone up there.
[1:11:53] Maybe not to kill the animals, but just
[1:11:55] to get up in the mountains to be alone
[1:11:57] around horses and things. I've done
[1:11:59] quite a bit of riding in my days and I
[1:12:01] love horses and riding and fishing and
[1:12:03] hiking and those outdoor things.
[1:12:06] Well, that's brother Brenham. Guess
[1:12:08] what? For you to be spiritual, you don't
[1:12:09] have to like those things.
[1:12:12] You can say, "I hate bugs. I hate ticks.
[1:12:14] I hate the outside.
[1:12:16] And you're not less spiritual.
[1:12:19] You may have never rode a horse and
[1:12:20] never hunted a day in your life. That
[1:12:22] doesn't make you less spiritual. Amen.
[1:12:25] Brother is saying, "I love those things
[1:12:26] and I'm glad God gave it to me because
[1:12:28] it's clean." Yeah. So, Brother Bam had
[1:12:30] hobbies. Yeah.
[1:12:33] And he talks about hobbies. Hobbies
[1:12:35] aren't wrong.
[1:12:37] As long as they're clean, right? But the
[1:12:40] hobby he had was an expression of what
[1:12:42] was in him. And many people, some are
[1:12:45] craftsmen, some are artists, some are
[1:12:47] this and some are that. Amen. But
[1:12:49] listen, it it there's nothing wrong with
[1:12:51] expressing what you are.
[1:12:54] That's I'll ask you, is God an artist?
[1:12:59] Has anybody painted a more beautiful
[1:13:01] night sky than God? Amen. Has anybody
[1:13:04] ever captured it in paint the way God
[1:13:06] painted in the sky?
[1:13:08] The sunset striking across a mountain.
[1:13:11] Can anybody do it like God can do it?
[1:13:13] No. So us who who not us cuz I'm not one
[1:13:16] of them. Those who are gifted in art and
[1:13:18] art, all they're doing is manifesting
[1:13:21] part of God's nature.
[1:13:24] You who are craftsman, God is a
[1:13:26] craftsman. You are engineers. God is the
[1:13:28] one who engineered everything in the
[1:13:29] world. Amen. All you're doing is
[1:13:32] expressing that nature that's in you.
[1:13:34] Amen. God listen.
[1:13:38] Shock.
[1:13:39] Shocking. God likes to bake.
[1:13:44] Who made mana? Yeah, that's right. Who
[1:13:46] taught the angel to make the cakes that
[1:13:48] Elijah was served? Amen.
[1:13:51] Wasn't Jesus barbecuing fish on coals?
[1:14:02] I love it.
[1:14:04] I love it.
[1:14:09] God is a gardener. who planted the
[1:14:13] Garden of Eden. Amen. God is a farmer
[1:14:17] who swed seeds into the world and who's
[1:14:19] bringing a harvest at the end time.
[1:14:20] Amen. God is a shepherd. That's right.
[1:14:23] He's a doctor. Amen. Amen. He's a
[1:14:27] mechanic.
[1:14:29] Who fixes your life when you break it.
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:34] You realize we're not just expressing
[1:14:36] God when we're reading our Bible in a
[1:14:37] church.
[1:14:39] We're expressing God when we're living.
[1:14:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. God didn't call us
[1:14:44] just to sit in church 24 hours a day and
[1:14:47] just read our Bible non-stop. He called
[1:14:49] us to live and manifest him. Think about
[1:14:52] the amount of time you sit in church
[1:14:54] versus the amount of time you're out.
[1:14:55] Yeah. You think God only wants five
[1:14:59] hours a week to manifest him? No. every
[1:15:03] day, everything he wants you to manifest
[1:15:06] to be what you are and not be ashamed of
[1:15:09] what you are and do what you like.
[1:15:11] Amenise because doing what you like can
[1:15:14] be expressing his nature.
[1:15:18] That's what brother Brandham he would
[1:15:21] remember brother Brandham most of not
[1:15:25] most many of his most wonderful
[1:15:26] encounters with God took place
[1:15:29] where when he was out enjoying his
[1:15:31] hobby. Yeah. Yeah. Right. After a storm.
[1:15:36] Amen. And and the storm come through.
[1:15:38] And after the storm, he heard the he
[1:15:40] heard the coyote howling. He heard the
[1:15:42] elk. And brother Bam said he just ran
[1:15:43] and ran around the tree worshiping God.
[1:15:45] Yes, sir. Because he saw God in nature
[1:15:48] because that's the way he was wired.
[1:15:51] That's the way God made him.
[1:15:54] Amen. You may not see God in nature the
[1:15:56] way he does, but you might see God in
[1:15:59] whatever God's given you to
[1:16:01] do. Some doctors can see God through a
[1:16:03] microscope. And they can see God right
[1:16:06] there. Amen. They can see God in art.
[1:16:09] They can see God in music.
[1:16:13] God's a musician. Who taught the angels
[1:16:16] to sing and
[1:16:18] play? We can express God in more ways
[1:16:21] than we ever thought. We can just be
[1:16:23] what we are. We don't have to be
[1:16:26] anything different than what we are. not
[1:16:27] sinful, not worldly, but just be what we
[1:16:31] are and let God have us and do what he
[1:16:34] wants with
[1:16:35] us. You know, when God wanted to teach
[1:16:38] brother Brandham a
[1:16:40] lesson, he'd come to him in the
[1:16:43] woods
[1:16:45] and he didn't
[1:16:48] say, "William Brandon, when you get back
[1:16:51] to your study, I'll teach you something
[1:16:52] about the scriptures." Right? when you
[1:16:56] go back to your office and have your
[1:16:57] Bible open.
[1:17:00] No, he taught him right there.
[1:17:03] When he taught him Jesus of the New
[1:17:05] Testament is Jehovah the Old Testament.
[1:17:06] Where was he? He was out in the woods
[1:17:10] and he saw a rainbow from one hill to
[1:17:12] the other. And he said, "Jesus of the
[1:17:14] New Testament is Jehovah the Old." He
[1:17:16] got a tremendous revelation. Amen. when
[1:17:20] after the storm after the blowdown he
[1:17:22] saw that he heard that that little
[1:17:24] squirrel chattering chatter chatter
[1:17:25] chatter and he saw it was at an eagle
[1:17:26] and the eagle was there got blown down
[1:17:28] in the storm and then he talks to the
[1:17:30] eagle you know I could shoot you I've
[1:17:31] got my gun and the eagle just looks at
[1:17:32] him and he takes off flaps his wings
[1:17:35] twice sets his wings and goes off he
[1:17:36] said he wasn't afraid of me because he
[1:17:37] had those two great wings old and new
[1:17:39] testament that he knew he could get away
[1:17:42] Brandon learned a tremendous spiritual
[1:17:44] lesson
[1:17:46] out hunting Yeah.
[1:17:50] Can you learn spiritual lessons in your
[1:17:51] garden? Amen.
[1:17:58] You can be whatever you are
[1:18:02] and let God deal with you and use you
[1:18:04] the way you are. We don't have to fit
[1:18:07] each other's mold. We don't have to be
[1:18:08] ashamed of the way we are. We don't have
[1:18:10] to be embarrassed. Amen. If you love the
[1:18:12] garden, garden. If you love to paint,
[1:18:14] paint. If you love music, you're
[1:18:15] involved in music. If you like
[1:18:17] craftsmanship, do craftsmanship. Just do
[1:18:19] whatever you are. Be what you are. And
[1:18:22] don't try to be anything else. And let
[1:18:24] God be part of everything you do.
[1:18:28] Amen. What did God want in the
[1:18:29] beginning? He wanted fellowship. That's
[1:18:31] right. What kind of fellowship? He come
[1:18:33] down in the cool of the evening. Brother
[1:18:35] tells us in the cool of the evening at
[1:18:36] the end of the day and says, "Have my
[1:18:38] children enjoyed their day upon the
[1:18:40] earth?
[1:18:42] Did you like the apple? How was the fig?
[1:18:47] It was simple. It was life. It was He
[1:18:50] was part of their life. God wants to be
[1:18:53] part of our lives. How does he want to
[1:18:54] fellowship with us? Where does he want
[1:18:55] to teach us? Of course, we know that
[1:18:57] preaching is the highest form of
[1:18:58] communication with God and men. But
[1:19:00] that's not the only time God wants to
[1:19:01] talk to us. Amen. He wants to talk to us
[1:19:04] in whatever we're doing. And he's made
[1:19:05] us in a way that we can absorb lessons.
[1:19:07] We can gather things from the things
[1:19:09] that we're doing. Yes, we can learn from
[1:19:13] mistakes, success and failure in all
[1:19:15] parts of life. God can teach us. He
[1:19:18] wants to be part of our life intricately
[1:19:21] woven into the fabric of who we are. And
[1:19:24] he wants who we are to express part of
[1:19:27] who he is.
[1:19:29] We just got to be real, be genuine, be
[1:19:33] exactly what we
[1:19:34] are. Here's a quote. I want to finish
[1:19:37] up. This is a quote and then two
[1:19:39] scriptures. But look at this quote with
[1:19:41] me. He said, "And then from then on,"
[1:19:43] he's talking about being way up in
[1:19:45] northern British Columbia, 600 miles.
[1:19:46] The way the crow flies, there's not even
[1:19:48] a path or a trail. And when you hit the
[1:19:50] west coast, you go about 800 miles to
[1:19:52] Vancouver. There's not even a speck of
[1:19:54] civilization. And the next civilization
[1:19:56] going this way is Anchorage, about 7 or
[1:19:58] 800 miles. Go back this way, you run
[1:20:00] into a little city, Yellow Knife, where
[1:20:01] you get a ship in there once a year for
[1:20:03] the Eskimos. And next you hit Russia. So
[1:20:05] you're really to
[1:20:08] yourself. That's where God can take his
[1:20:10] rest up there from all the troubles and
[1:20:13] trials that we put him into. So I like
[1:20:15] to go up there and talk to him when he's
[1:20:18] resting. You see? So brother Brandham
[1:20:21] found a place on the earth hundreds of
[1:20:24] miles from Vancouver, hundreds of miles
[1:20:26] from Alaska, hundreds of miles from from
[1:20:29] Anchorage, hundreds of miles from
[1:20:31] Russia, way up there with no paths, no
[1:20:33] roads. He found a place where God likes
[1:20:36] to go and rest from the troubles we put
[1:20:39] him
[1:20:40] in. How did he find that
[1:20:43] place? How did he know? How did he pick
[1:20:45] it up of a map? And then he said this,
[1:20:50] "I like to go up there and talk to him
[1:20:52] when he's resting." The next question
[1:20:55] is, how did he know when he would be up
[1:20:57] there
[1:20:57] resting? How did he know when God would
[1:21:00] get tired from all the troubles we put
[1:21:01] him in and God would take a break?
[1:21:03] Because brother Brandham's hunting
[1:21:04] trips, he planned months in advance. So,
[1:21:07] how did Brother Brandham know four,
[1:21:09] five, six months ahead of time that God
[1:21:11] was going to be tired and he was going
[1:21:13] to go to this spot and rest so brother
[1:21:16] Benham could go up there because he
[1:21:17] likes to go up there when God's up there
[1:21:18] to talk to him?
[1:21:21] How did he know that?
[1:21:24] Unless brother Benham took him there for
[1:21:26] the rest.
[1:21:28] Right.
[1:21:31] Amen. I will never leave you
[1:21:34] or forsake you. I will be with you
[1:21:37] always.
[1:21:41] See, brother, there's no way Brother
[1:21:42] Bram knew what date on the calendar God
[1:21:45] would be up there resting or what spot
[1:21:47] on the globe was the spot he liked to go
[1:21:49] to. Brother Brandham went to the spot he
[1:21:52] liked to go when he was tired.
[1:21:55] Amen.
[1:21:57] Are you getting the picture? Yeah,
[1:22:00] God wants to share your life with you.
[1:22:04] If you can just be God conscious all the
[1:22:06] time.
[1:22:08] Just don't ever put him far away. He's
[1:22:12] never far away. If you've been born
[1:22:13] again by the spirit of God, don't put
[1:22:15] him far away. Don't put him miles away.
[1:22:18] Don't put him outside of your life.
[1:22:19] Don't put him outside of your trial.
[1:22:21] Yeah. Right.
[1:22:24] Just dwell in fellowship with him all
[1:22:26] the time and do what you like to do
[1:22:29] because that's what he likes to
[1:22:32] do. Every time brother Brandon went
[1:22:34] hunting, who went hunting with him?
[1:22:38] That's right.
[1:22:41] Are we thinking?
[1:22:43] How many times did brother M tells
[1:22:44] hunting stories when God spoke to him?
[1:22:47] How many times? I can't even number
[1:22:49] them. So many times he tells the stories
[1:22:52] where he encounters God and God speaks
[1:22:53] to him. He's on a hunting trip. That
[1:22:55] means when brother Brandham went
[1:22:57] hunting, he didn't go hunting by
[1:22:59] himself.
[1:23:02] God went hunting with him. Amen. So I'll
[1:23:05] tell you, don't bake alone.
[1:23:08] Don't paint alone. Don't play music
[1:23:11] alone. Don't garden alone. Don't do
[1:23:13] woodworking alone. Don't do your job
[1:23:15] alone. Don't read alone. Amen.
[1:23:18] Hallelujah. Don't do anything alone.
[1:23:22] God wants to dwell in you. Yes, sir.
[1:23:25] With you, sharing your life with you.
[1:23:27] Don't put him miles away. Let him be
[1:23:30] with you in you with your temperament.
[1:23:34] And let's learn to value everybody.
[1:23:38] Amen. And appreciate everyone. And stop
[1:23:41] thinking, well, they got to be like me
[1:23:44] or like this brother or like that one.
[1:23:47] And let's just all get comfortable in
[1:23:49] our own skin with the way God designed
[1:23:52] us. He says in John
[1:23:55] 14:18, "I will not leave you
[1:23:57] comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a
[1:23:59] little while and the world sees me no
[1:24:01] more, but ye see me. Because I live, ye
[1:24:04] shall live also. At that day you shall
[1:24:06] know that I am in the Father and ye in
[1:24:08] me and I in you." Amen. Where is he?
[1:24:13] He's in you. He's in you with your
[1:24:16] temperament.
[1:24:17] Don't run away from it. Embrace it.
[1:24:19] Don't try to change unless something's
[1:24:21] wrong. Unless something's off the word,
[1:24:24] seek God and ask God to change that. But
[1:24:27] if not, just express God the way that
[1:24:31] you
[1:24:33] are. Amen.
[1:24:35] If not, we're all going to have to find
[1:24:37] that spot in northern British Columbia
[1:24:40] that Brother Benham was talking about,
[1:24:42] and we're all going to have to figure
[1:24:43] out what time it is that God's tired of
[1:24:46] all the trouble. And if he's tired of
[1:24:47] the trouble that I put him through, it's
[1:24:49] pretty much all the
[1:24:53] time. I don't think we're going to have
[1:24:55] to guess of the location or the time.
[1:25:00] When you get away to rest, he's going to
[1:25:02] go away and rest with you.
[1:25:04] Amen.
[1:25:08] Amen.
[1:25:10] Ephesians 2 8-10. For by grace are you
[1:25:13] saved through faith, and that not of
[1:25:15] yourselves. It is the gift of God, not
[1:25:17] of works, lest any man should boast. For
[1:25:19] we are his workmanship, created in
[1:25:21] Christ Jesus unto good works, that God
[1:25:24] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:25:26] in them. How many believe we should do
[1:25:28] good works? I believe we should do good
[1:25:32] works. But God before ordained that we
[1:25:36] should walk in them. That means God
[1:25:38] already knows what he wants you to do.
[1:25:41] He's already ordained it. He already has
[1:25:43] a purpose for your life. He already has
[1:25:45] a design. He's already got something
[1:25:46] that he wants you to do.
[1:25:49] So, he fashioned you to do it. He placed
[1:25:53] an attribute of himself that could
[1:25:54] accomplish it. And he fashioned your
[1:25:56] very makeup to go with that attribute to
[1:25:58] accomplish the purpose he has for your
[1:26:00] life.
[1:26:02] I say if God could help us just to
[1:26:06] relax. What is the whole Christian
[1:26:09] experience based on? Rest.
[1:26:12] Rest. What does brother Bam say? The key
[1:26:14] to operating a gift to relax.
[1:26:17] If we could just say, God, I am
[1:26:20] fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:26:23] Sometimes I don't understand myself. And
[1:26:24] that's the truth. Brother Bam said, "My
[1:26:26] wife doesn't understand me." He said,
[1:26:27] "Frankly, I don't understand myself."
[1:26:29] And there's times that we don't even
[1:26:31] understand why we are the way we are.
[1:26:33] And if we could just reach inside of us
[1:26:35] and twist everything around and change
[1:26:36] it, we would have a long time ago.
[1:26:39] But I still believe we're fearfully and
[1:26:41] wonderfully made. And I believe God had
[1:26:44] a purpose in our design and our makeup
[1:26:45] and our parents and our lineage and the
[1:26:47] seed he put in us and the time he placed
[1:26:49] us and the position he placed us in and
[1:26:51] the time he called us and the work that
[1:26:53] he wants us to do in the end time. And
[1:26:56] you never made a mistake. And nobody's
[1:26:58] here by chance. And we're all here to
[1:27:00] serve God's purpose.
[1:27:02] Oh God, help us to rest.
[1:27:05] You know, you can really only enjoy life
[1:27:08] when you're being yourself. That's
[1:27:10] right.
[1:27:12] You can't ever you can't ever fit into
[1:27:14] somebody else's mold and wear somebody
[1:27:16] else's shoes and be completely
[1:27:17] comfortable. The only way that you and I
[1:27:19] can ever be comfortable is if we just
[1:27:20] relax and are just ourselves. Amen. So
[1:27:24] may God help all the pressure to fall
[1:27:26] away, the pressure to conform, the
[1:27:29] pressure to be like somebody else. May
[1:27:32] it just all fall off of us now. May we
[1:27:34] all have the freedom under this great
[1:27:36] message just to be what we are. And
[1:27:40] let's all stand together. Musicians, if
[1:27:42] you'll
[1:27:42] come. If those who are going to be
[1:27:44] baptized want to make their way around
[1:27:46] back and one of the deacons will be back
[1:27:47] there to help them. Amen. I'm so happy
[1:27:51] to see these two brothers baptized in
[1:27:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[1:27:55] glad to see God calling and drawing and
[1:27:58] working in lives. And may God bless
[1:28:00] them. Let's bow our heads together and
[1:28:03] pray. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so
[1:28:05] thankful, Father, for the privilege,
[1:28:08] Lord, of hearing your word. God, you are
[1:28:10] so tremendous. You're so kind. You're so
[1:28:14] loving. You're so mindful of us, Lord.
[1:28:17] May you just take and break every wrong
[1:28:20] thought in our minds, Lord. Every thing
[1:28:23] that someone else or we ourselves have
[1:28:25] placed there, every complex that's come
[1:28:27] because of
[1:28:29] comparisons. Lord, whether we did it to
[1:28:31] ourselves or somebody else did it to us.
[1:28:33] Would you break that off of us, Lord?
[1:28:36] Would you set us free, Lord, from the
[1:28:38] captivity of peer pressure, from the
[1:28:40] captivity of confirmation to someone's
[1:28:43] idea, even our own ideas? Amen. Would
[1:28:47] you set us free by your word to be what
[1:28:48] you've called us to be? For God, we
[1:28:51] believe you, Lord. We believe your word.
[1:28:53] You believe you've called us. You've
[1:28:55] filled us with your spirit. You've
[1:28:57] quickened the life inside of us for a
[1:28:59] purpose. And we want to fulfill that
[1:29:01] purpose. We want you to be glorified and
[1:29:04] honored in our lives. We want you to be
[1:29:06] pleased with all we
[1:29:08] do. And God, you want to share your life
[1:29:11] with us, but God, we want to share our
[1:29:12] life with you.
[1:29:14] We want to be with you every moment of
[1:29:16] every day in communion with you, Lord,
[1:29:19] in
[1:29:20] fellowship. God, your desire is our
[1:29:23] desire. Make our desire your desire,
[1:29:25] Lord, as we just come together in
[1:29:28] unity. God, may this word shape us and
[1:29:31] mold us into what you've always wanted
[1:29:33] us to be. You've always wanted an earth
[1:29:38] inhabited with sons and daughters.
[1:29:40] You've always wanted to dwell as a
[1:29:43] family upon the earth in flesh. And God,
[1:29:46] that's what you're doing now. That's
[1:29:47] what this message has come for, to strip
[1:29:50] away every barrier that would limit you
[1:29:52] expressing yourself this way. And God,
[1:29:55] may we allow those things to be stripped
[1:29:58] away from us that you might come and
[1:30:00] fill us and use us, anoint us, walk in
[1:30:04] us, walk with us. Lord, we yield
[1:30:08] ourselves to you and we ask that you
[1:30:09] would bless us and help us to go forward
[1:30:12] with confidence and joy with the freedom
[1:30:14] that you've given us. We love you. We
[1:30:17] ask your blessings over all these things
[1:30:19] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[1:30:25] bless you, brother Riley.
[1:30:28] And

[1:32:28] And
[1:32:30] all he
[1:32:33] wants is
[1:32:39] you. And
[1:32:42] no one
[1:32:45] else will do.
[1:32:53] Not just a
[1:32:57] heart. He wants all of your
[1:33:04] heart.

[1:33:09] wants is

[1:34:18] All he
[1:34:21] wants is
[1:34:25] me. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. You
[1:34:29] can be
[1:34:31] seated. This is brother Preston Rogers.
[1:34:34] He I got a chance to talk to him Monday
[1:34:36] and he was sharing with me how God
[1:34:38] started dealing with him last July and
[1:34:40] what he calls a renewal where God
[1:34:42] started drawing him to himself and and
[1:34:44] he spent some time with brother Joseph
[1:34:46] Scott. They've had he's had wonderful
[1:34:48] fellowship down at the Barber College.
[1:34:50] They're both attending and he knew that
[1:34:53] he wanted to be baptized and he knew he
[1:34:55] wanted to be baptized in immersion and
[1:34:57] then brother Joseph was sharing with him
[1:34:59] about baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:35:00] Christ and he saw it. God revealed it to
[1:35:02] him and he knows that's the right
[1:35:03] formula for baptism. So he desired to be
[1:35:06] baptized in Jesus' name to take his name
[1:35:09] in baptism and identify himself with
[1:35:11] Christ. So I told him it'd be an honor
[1:35:13] for us to help him fulfill the word and
[1:35:15] see him baptized. So Preston upon your
[1:35:18] confession of faith because you've
[1:35:19] accepted Calvary and what Christ has
[1:35:21] done for you in the atonement of his
[1:35:23] blood and you want to be baptized in his
[1:35:25] name to take his name to be fully
[1:35:27] identified with Jesus Christ. It is my
[1:35:30] privilege now to baptize you in the name
[1:35:32] of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:36] Christ. Dear Lord Jesus, I lay hands on
[1:35:38] my brother Preston. Lord, you have drawn
[1:35:41] him, Lord. His own testimony knows that
[1:35:43] you have drawn him. You've brought him
[1:35:45] this far, Lord, and he's been obedient
[1:35:46] to obey your word. I pray, God, as I lay
[1:35:49] hands on him as your apostles did of
[1:35:50] old, that you would fill him with the
[1:35:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, God, that you
[1:35:54] would regenerate him fully, Lord, and
[1:35:55] you would give him the promise that
[1:35:57] you've promised so long ago. It's still
[1:35:59] in effect because you're drawing and
[1:36:01] it's for him. I pray that you shield him
[1:36:03] and you would protect him and you'd use
[1:36:04] him as a bright light in this world. And
[1:36:06] may you fulfill the promise in my
[1:36:08] brother Preston. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:36:10] Amen. God bless you,
[1:36:15] brother.
[1:36:17] Amen. And now we have brother
[1:36:23] Griffin. Griffin sent me a text uh late
[1:36:27] last night. I didn't get it till this
[1:36:29] morning, but when I got it, I was so
[1:36:30] excited. It was such a good wakeup call.
[1:36:34] Amen. God bless you, brother. We just
[1:36:37] want to sit on the edge
[1:36:38] here. Griffin shared with me that the
[1:36:41] Lord had been drawing him. He'd felt the
[1:36:43] Lord tugging at him and he believed that
[1:36:45] he was ready to take this step to take
[1:36:48] Jesus Christ's name, take baptism
[1:36:51] publicly as a confession. So, Brother
[1:36:53] Griffin, God bless you. This is a happy
[1:36:56] day for all of us because you've
[1:36:58] accepted what Christ has done for you
[1:37:00] and you identify with it. You've
[1:37:02] received it and you want to identify
[1:37:04] publicly with Christ and take his name
[1:37:06] in baptism. Is a great privilege for me
[1:37:08] to baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:37:11] Jesus
[1:37:13] Christ. I'm going to baptize you one
[1:37:15] more time because your head didn't go
[1:37:16] all the way under. So just lean
[1:37:20] back. Amen.
[1:37:23] Dear heavenly father, I thank you God
[1:37:24] for my brother. Lord, I've watched as
[1:37:27] you've drawn him through life and he's
[1:37:29] grown up before our eyes. So excited to
[1:37:32] see you drawing him to yourself and him
[1:37:34] responding to that draw. Lord, we so
[1:37:37] appreciate what you're doing for all of
[1:37:38] us, Lord. And now I just pray, God, that
[1:37:41] you would confirm your promise upon my
[1:37:43] brother Griffin, that you would fill him
[1:37:44] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That
[1:37:46] you would regenerate him. That you would
[1:37:48] bring your seed to life inside of him.
[1:37:50] that you would take him all the way
[1:37:51] through to a body change. I pray that
[1:37:53] he'd be a bright and shining light
[1:37:55] wherever you take him, wherever you lead
[1:37:56] him, and you would use him for your
[1:37:57] glory. You'd watch over him, that you
[1:37:59] would protect him, and you would help
[1:38:00] him to grow into your very likeness,
[1:38:02] into the fullness of adoption. We ask it
[1:38:05] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[1:38:09] bless you all.
[1:38:12] I'm resting on the finished work of
[1:38:17] Jesus Christ
[1:38:21] today. All
[1:38:23] circumstances will be gone. The word of
[1:38:27] God will still remain. No sickness,
[1:38:32] fear, no guilt or sin can have control
[1:38:38] and worry me. The keys of faith are in
[1:38:44] my hand and I am bound for
[1:38:51] victory. I am
[1:38:55] free. My new day has come.
[1:39:02] Now I can be who I truly
[1:39:11] am. I am
[1:39:15] free. Covered by his blood.
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:22] All
[1:39:24] things are
[1:39:27] possible with
[1:39:31] God. All
[1:39:34] things are
[1:39:36] possible with God.
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:43] A great
[1:39:44] commission from my
[1:39:47] Lord I have now
[1:39:52] received. The prince of power of the air
[1:39:58] will never have a part in me. As amateur
[1:40:05] creator, I can change the
[1:40:10] atmosphere
[1:40:11] around. I use the chain of
[1:40:16] circumstance for any spirit to be
[1:40:23] bound. I am
[1:40:27] free. My new day has come.
[1:40:34] Now I can be who I truly
[1:40:43] am. I am
[1:40:47] free. Covered by his love.
[1:40:54] All
[1:40:56] things are
[1:40:58] possible with
[1:41:03] God. All
[1:41:06] things are
[1:41:08] possible with
[1:41:14] God. I know that
[1:41:17] Jesus the I
[1:41:19] am is the same today.
[1:41:25] The prophet came to show the light. The
[1:41:30] bride must have it on
[1:41:34] display. The hour has come for Christ in
[1:41:39] us to be
[1:41:41] completely glorified.
[1:41:45] I want the spirit to be free to do the
[1:41:51] gater works in
[1:41:55] me. I am
[1:41:59] free. My new day has
[1:42:06] come. Now I can be who I truly am.
[1:42:16] I am
[1:42:19] free covered by his
[1:42:25] blood. All
[1:42:29] things are
[1:42:31] possible with God.
[1:42:37] All
[1:42:39] things are
[1:42:41] possible with God once
[1:42:45] more. Oh, I am
[1:42:50] free. My new day has come.
[1:42:57] Now I can be who I truly
[1:43:06] am. I am
[1:43:10] free. Covered by his blood.
[1:43:17] All
[1:43:20] things are
[1:43:22] possible with
[1:43:26] God. All
[1:43:30] things are
[1:43:32] possible with God.
