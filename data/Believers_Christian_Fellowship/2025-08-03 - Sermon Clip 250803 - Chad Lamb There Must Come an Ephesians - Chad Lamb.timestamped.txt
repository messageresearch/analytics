[0:00] We each have to come to an Ephesians and
[0:02] be an Ephesians. We have to live exactly
[0:05] what Ephesians established in our own
[0:07] personal life because every Hebrew,
[0:09] every Israelite, every seed of Abraham
[0:12] that went into the promised land had to
[0:14] find their portion and had to possess
[0:16] it.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; And that means every member of this
[0:19] bride has to find their portion in the
[0:21] word and has to possess it. Amen.
[0:23] Possess all of this word that God's
[0:25] given to you. Don't wait for somebody
[0:27] else to do it. Amen. You can do it. You
[0:29] can live this word. You can manifest the
[0:31] word. You can pray for your children.
[0:33] You can pray for your neighbor. You can
[0:35] pray to God. You Amen.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; God and you can move mountains. God and
[0:40] you can speak squirrels into existence.
[0:42] God and you can do anything that's ever
[0:44] been done in this Bible. God can do it
[0:46] through each and every one of you
[0:48] because that's the purpose. That's the
[0:50] point.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; God in you. Christ in you, the hope of
[0:55] glory.
[0:57] That's where the church failed. The
[0:58] church failed by taking it from the
[1:00] people and putting it to a few gifted
[1:02] men, putting into the pullpit. Amen. And
[1:04] then then they begin to regulate it.
[1:06] Then everybody just come to church and
[1:07] was part of the right group. And part of
[1:09] the right group means that I'm
[1:10] automatically right. And they lost
[1:11] personal responsibility and personal
[1:13] manifestation. And that's why you can go
[1:15] into denominational churches and people
[1:17] live horrible lives. Amen. But they go
[1:19] to church and do their religious duty
[1:20] and they're somehow safe under a banner
[1:22] of the church. That's where the church
[1:24] fails. That's where Ephesus got off. But
[1:26] there's coming again in Ephesians in the
[1:28] end time where everybody takes their
[1:31] place in the word.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; And if the word says it, it's good
[1:34] enough for me. If the word says it, I'll
[1:36] live it. And if I'm having trouble live
[1:37] it, I'll go back to the word and say,
[1:39] "God, you've got to manifest this word
[1:41] through me by the power of your spirit
[1:42] because it's in the word. And I'm called
[1:44] to be an Ephesians in the end time,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; the full manifestation, part of the
[1:49] body, a joint that fully supplies,
[1:52] coming into perfection, growing into the
[1:54] head, into the stature of a perfect man.
[1:56] And if there's any limitation in me,
[1:59] there's got to be a power that removes
[2:01] that limitation because this is the hour
[2:03] of Ephesians.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; And we got to believe it. We got to act
[2:09] on it. We got to move forward with faith
[2:11] that God will remove the obstacles. Not
[2:13] bowing down because I tried to move the
[2:16] Canaanite before and they've got armored
[2:18] uh chariots of iron. I put them under.
[2:20] No. No tribute. Amen. We're taking all
[2:22] the land. We're all going to possess
[2:25] until we get a body change.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; Until our Adams change, we're going to
[2:31] keep pressing into this inheritance.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stop with an old habit,
[2:36] with an old complex. I'm going to say,
[2:38] "God, deliver me. Deliver me. Deliver
[2:40] me. God says, "I'll help you. I'll fight
[2:43] for you. I'll drive out the enemies."
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know when he stopped driving out
[2:47] the enemies? When they put them under
[2:49] tributes.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we put them under tribute
[2:54] and come to some kind of working terms
[2:56] with a complex, some kind of working
[2:58] terms with bitterness in our heart, some
[3:00] kind of working terms with an old habit.
[3:02] Amen. Then God will stop fighting for
[3:04] you. Don't come to working terms with
[3:06] your complex. Don't come to working
[3:08] terms with your besetting sin. Push
[3:11] against it again. But what if I fail?
[3:14] Then push against it again.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; This is the Ephesians age. This is
[3:19] Joshua again. This is fully possessing
[3:21] the word of God.
