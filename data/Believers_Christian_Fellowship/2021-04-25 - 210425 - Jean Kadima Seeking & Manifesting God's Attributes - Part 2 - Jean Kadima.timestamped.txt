[7:56] shall renew their strength
[7:58] they shall mount out with wings wings as
[8:01] an ego give us that mountain power this
[8:04] morning
[8:06] as we asking this in the name of the
[8:09] lord jesus christ
[8:11] amen all right we will take a
[8:14] a a small subject
[8:19] nothing new same thing but say it with
[8:22] my own words
[8:26] so uh pray that it will be a blessing to
[8:29] you
[8:31] uh very familiar scripture we're gonna
[8:34] read
[8:34] is mark 11.
[8:38] uh we will just read it from
[8:41] uh verse
[8:45] 20. you can read the whole thing
[8:48] at home
[8:55] mark 11 okay
[8:58] and in the morning as they passed by
[9:00] they saw that
[9:01] fig tree dried up from the roots
[9:05] and peter calling to remember and say
[9:07] unto him
[9:08] master behold the fig tree which thou
[9:11] cursed
[9:12] is withered away and jesus answered
[9:16] unto them have faith in god
[9:20] for very i say unto you that whosoever
[9:24] shall say unto this mountain be
[9:26] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[9:29] sea
[9:30] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[9:33] shall believe that those things which
[9:35] he saith shall come to pass he shall
[9:38] have whatsoever he saith
[9:44] amen may god bless the reading of the
[9:47] word
[9:48] you may take your seeds
[9:54] so um i would like to
[9:58] to take a part two of my
[10:01] message the last time which was
[10:05] seeking and manifesting god's attributes
[10:10] i want to just call it the part two
[10:13] and this time i want to say
[10:16] give it a subtitle last time we
[10:20] focus on the judge
[10:23] who has come in a cloud
[10:27] is among us we can go to him
[10:30] with any issue and
[10:34] is more than able to judge
[10:37] our enemy amen so
[10:41] um is the
[10:44] fair judge a judge with fairness
[10:49] and his attributes we need
[10:52] we need them so we can also
[10:55] have this the judgment that god has
[10:59] we can have the discernment
[11:04] and so but this morning
[11:07] i want to take a different angle
[11:12] with the same message this time i
[11:15] call the subtitle god's eyes
[11:20] god's faith now you see
[11:23] what i'm i mean by that um
[11:28] god sees think differently from us
[11:32] we see things because we are human
[11:37] we have a feeling of love we have
[11:40] care of life there are so many things
[11:43] that makes us
[11:44] see things the way we see them
[11:49] but as we maturing in god's
[11:52] knowledge then we start
[11:56] thinking things a little differently
[12:00] and we see things the way godzilla
[12:03] thinks
[12:05] and is very important
[12:08] so that's what we're trying to say to
[12:11] this morning
[12:12] so let uh i took this
[12:15] scripture for a reason
[12:19] because um i'm talking about
[12:23] god's eyes and god faith
[12:27] so when you go into the
[12:30] translation of the bible
[12:34] the place that we just read
[12:37] if you look when he say
[12:40] that jesus answer and say unto them
[12:44] have faith in god the true translations
[12:48] actually say have the faith of god
[12:53] seems to be the same thing but it's not
[12:54] the same thing
[12:57] have the faith of god
[13:00] when god says something he believes it
[13:04] if he say let there be light there gonna
[13:07] be
[13:08] light no matter how long it's going to
[13:11] take
[13:12] he say that he believes it amen
[13:17] now
[13:20] talks about a greek man or a greek
[13:24] priest
[13:25] who came to his meeting in the message
[13:28] all things
[13:28] he say i thought this morning that the
[13:30] little greek priest
[13:32] that was with us in the fellowship
[13:35] breakfast uh what a wonderful little
[13:37] character and kind of
[13:39] uh sick kind of seeking after
[13:42] deep experience i've got another lolo
[13:46] greek priest that was led to christ
[13:49] through the tapes
[13:51] his father is a greek orthodox teacher a
[13:54] highly estimated man in greece
[13:58] he came over here to finish his
[14:00] education
[14:01] got a hold of one of the tapes and at
[14:03] first he criticized it
[14:05] that's how we start you know until the
[14:08] hook
[14:10] you start by doing that so um and then
[14:14] he came and
[14:14] was baptized and received the holy ghost
[14:17] and he said
[14:18] brother branham i know that you don't
[14:21] know
[14:21] greek because i understand you don't
[14:23] know you don't know very good english
[14:28] welcome to my world
[14:31] but say if anybody who really knows
[14:34] greek and is a greek scholar say
[14:37] the continue to continuity of your
[14:40] talk with greece is absolutely perfect
[14:43] putting the scriptures together
[14:47] that's why he was battered oversee he
[14:50] said
[14:50] it's a phenomenal
[14:53] and just knowing you don't know it but
[14:56] the way you put your scriptures together
[14:59] the continuity of your scripture
[15:03] runs in the greek it's not the knowledge
[15:07] of the greek
[15:08] or the hebrews but is the the
[15:12] sword the king's sword
[15:15] in his hands make the world
[15:18] come out together amen
[15:21] amen praise god
[15:25] so even this scripture that i just read
[15:29] when i say god have
[15:32] faith in god actually the translation
[15:35] is have the faith of god or
[15:39] have god's faith brother pranam
[15:42] talks about it amen
[15:45] if you read the message you see uh that
[15:48] he talks about that
[15:50] he say god's fate he said there is only
[15:53] one faith is
[15:54] god's faith amen
[15:58] and it could put all these things
[16:00] together because
[16:01] a prophet is a revealer
[16:04] of this written word
[16:08] that's why we don't argue with him
[16:11] because that's his duty that's what
[16:15] god predestinated him to do
[16:18] so and you can see in other places
[16:22] like uh when you
[16:25] look at john chapter 8 18
[16:28] 4 jesus therefore knowing all things
[16:32] that
[16:33] should come upon him
[16:36] went forth and say unto them who seek ye
[16:41] they answer him jesus of nazareth
[16:44] jesus said unto them i am he
[16:47] and judas also which betray him stood
[16:50] with them
[16:51] as soon as they had he had say
[16:54] unto them i am he they went
[16:57] backward and fell to the ground
[17:02] but the true translation of this
[17:05] is not that he say i am he
[17:10] the true translation is i am
[17:14] so he is telling this
[17:18] uh judas that came to betray him this
[17:21] saudis this priest that
[17:24] came in presence of
[17:27] god who are you looking for
[17:31] they say jesus of nazareth is say ah
[17:35] yem the same who spoke to moses tell
[17:40] them
[17:40] i am send me is standing here
[17:44] and you come with all your arrogance
[17:47] in front of me when you say i am they
[17:49] went on the floor
[17:52] but john did not need to do that
[17:56] john when he saw him he went on a floor
[17:59] he went on the ground he went to his
[18:02] knees
[18:03] because the bride is humble the bride
[18:07] recognized him she's on
[18:10] an on she is
[18:14] in all of him when she sees him
[18:18] amen but these people god
[18:21] has to tell them go to your knees
[18:25] you are in the presence of god and he
[18:28] say
[18:28] to them i am and you can see brother
[18:31] branham later saying that
[18:34] the i am in the old testament jehovah
[18:38] is jesus in the new testament
[18:41] translation
[18:43] of the bible thank god for a prophet
[18:47] amen
[18:50] yes that's what he says he say actually
[18:54] i am and they go down
[18:58] so we go back to this message
[19:04] have faith in god look at
[19:08] god eyes and god
[19:11] faith you see when god says something
[19:16] he believes in what he says
[19:20] it will happen no matter what
[19:23] so he rests upon what he says he
[19:26] believes what he says
[19:29] and his prophet actually when they speak
[19:32] they speak in present tense
[19:36] because their god lives in eternity
[19:39] where everything is present and you can
[19:42] see in isaiah
[19:45] 9 you can see that for
[19:48] unto us a child is born
[19:52] right now like if you go into hospital
[19:56] you will
[19:56] find that child because they're living
[20:00] in the eternity they see the
[20:04] cup full before even he get
[20:07] there so they will announce
[20:11] that it is a done deal now
[20:14] before even he gets there because
[20:17] god sees the end before the beginning
[20:22] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[20:26] son
[20:27] is given and the government shall be
[20:30] upon his shoulder
[20:31] and his name shall be called wonderful
[20:34] counselor the mighty god
[20:36] the everlasting father the prince of
[20:39] peace
[20:40] let's read content for the faith
[20:44] 1955 brother by name says
[20:47] jesus said except a man be born again
[20:51] he cannot see the kingdom you can't
[20:54] understand it it's mystic
[20:58] and medical mythical think until you're
[21:01] born again
[21:02] there the very life of god comes in
[21:05] everlasting
[21:07] everlasting eternal life zoe
[21:10] god's own life comes in you and then you
[21:13] are part of god you are a son
[21:15] of god and or a daughter of god and then
[21:18] you see as god sees
[21:22] amen you believe how the god
[21:25] believes then you are a new
[21:29] creature in christ jesus the lord
[21:32] bless you now so you see
[21:35] and when he say sick
[21:39] it's not an effort
[21:43] a desire seek
[21:46] god's attribute and manifest those
[21:49] attributes one of them is to see things
[21:53] see means understanding but it's not
[21:56] intellectual understanding but because
[22:00] the things of
[22:00] god are spiritual amen we compare
[22:05] spiritual things with spiritual as we
[22:08] heard last sunday
[22:10] and therefore only spiritual will see
[22:13] it will understand them and god
[22:16] as we are maturing as we
[22:20] getting his word constantly constantly
[22:24] then we start seeing things like
[22:27] god because he has made us small
[22:30] gods anyway is that right
[22:34] yes you believe as
[22:37] god believed
[22:41] but we got to seek it was we
[22:44] seek it it did it doesn't mean we making
[22:47] an effort
[22:48] because all the potential is already in
[22:51] us is it just to show him a strong
[22:54] desire
[22:55] because we love him so much and he
[22:58] doesn't like things like a
[23:00] formality yeah if you give me it's okay
[23:04] if you don't give me it's all right
[23:06] but he want us to uh mean business and
[23:11] the work of preachers is to bring those
[23:14] things up
[23:15] and tell people sometime because
[23:17] sometimes we get a little
[23:19] lazy sometimes we kind of forgot
[23:23] and god sent the preacher to just remind
[23:27] us and seek god with all your strength
[23:31] amen and as you're doing it's all the
[23:34] green things
[23:36] start disappearing and when you look
[23:39] back
[23:39] because you know christian life is
[23:42] sometimes you
[23:43] look back you know i can say that
[23:46] because i'm old man
[23:48] i look back and say oh i made the right
[23:50] decision
[23:52] you look back yes he was good
[23:56] that i gave all my life to him i
[23:59] dedicate myself now i used to see
[24:03] things differently
[24:06] it exchanged i used to look at
[24:10] people differently i used to judge
[24:12] people differently
[24:14] i write off people like like left and
[24:17] right
[24:18] say this one that one
[24:23] but now when i look
[24:27] back he changed me
[24:30] now i see things differently
[24:34] meaning i discern things differently
[24:39] hallelujah and that's what we're talking
[24:42] about
[24:44] amen expectation
[24:49] 55. do you realize that
[24:52] the very earth that you are sitting over
[24:54] tonight is nothing more than the word of
[24:57] god
[24:58] did you know god made the world out of
[25:01] his own spoken word if you did
[25:04] where did he get the material he said
[25:07] let there be
[25:09] and it materialized and made
[25:12] a world let there be and there was light
[25:16] let there be and he believed his own
[25:19] word
[25:20] and his own word brought the earth into
[25:22] creation
[25:24] he made the world out of things which
[25:26] was not and does not
[25:28] appear yet he made the earth that you
[25:31] are sitting over
[25:32] tonight in a gra in a human
[25:36] mind everything that is of value
[25:40] is things that we can touch and feel
[25:44] but that is not a reality for god
[25:49] because out of nothing god created
[25:52] the material that we see and the
[25:56] kingdom of god is made of things that we
[25:58] cannot
[25:59] touch it's not tangible
[26:02] like love like a passion
[26:06] but i used to say uh give me uh some
[26:09] money
[26:10] i mean i want to go to let me say
[26:13] walmart and buy some love
[26:17] you can't
[26:20] because but that's the reality
[26:24] that's what made the world that
[26:27] things that we see was made with
[26:30] things that we don't see and therefore
[26:33] we're gonna give
[26:35] more up importance
[26:39] to things that are not tangible
[26:45] we cannot just do it by saying it
[26:48] but we will mean it because god
[26:52] in us will be seeing through our eyes
[26:56] brother burnham says that he thinks your
[26:59] thoughts
[27:00] he takes he use even your temperament
[27:04] hallelujah if you give it to him
[27:09] hallelujah
[27:12] 63 door in a door
[27:16] the fate you know the real genuine
[27:19] fate of god you see
[27:22] it translates in greek
[27:26] the real genuine faith of god will
[27:29] punctuate
[27:30] every promise of god with an amen
[27:34] a genuine holy ghost because why the
[27:37] holy ghost
[27:38] wrote the bible it says so
[27:42] man of old moved by the holy ghost wrote
[27:44] the bible see
[27:46] then how could the holy ghost be in you
[27:49] and deny it
[27:53] can do it amen
[27:58] all right i'll continue again um in the
[28:01] message
[28:03] in the message works it's a fake express
[28:07] he say this and he promised
[28:11] you the same thing that is if you could
[28:14] believe that that will happen
[28:17] if you can't believe it it won't happen
[28:20] now
[28:20] i can't make you believe neither can you
[28:23] make yourself
[28:24] believe god got to give it to you
[28:28] it's a gift of god to believe
[28:31] not your faith god's faith
[28:35] then god when he say there is an
[28:37] intellectual
[28:38] faith intellectual conception
[28:44] but god can give you
[28:47] his faith you start with the
[28:50] intellectual one
[28:52] it's like a faith but then god gives you
[28:56] his faith and but i'm saying keep
[28:59] going keep asking keep seeking
[29:02] then he give you is is but it's not
[29:06] like you made effort the
[29:09] thing is in you it makes you
[29:12] sick are you with me just
[29:16] like a chicken small chicken in a shell
[29:20] and when god said the time to go out is
[29:23] here
[29:23] demolition time and the chicken will
[29:27] just
[29:27] hit that shell here but i'm saying
[29:30] don't help it because if you help it
[29:34] you start removing some portion of the
[29:37] shell that chicken will die but
[29:41] god has put that in his mind to get
[29:44] out that's why he's seeking to go out
[29:49] amen and god says seek
[29:52] the seek me like you seek
[29:55] money for money oh we we do
[29:59] we do shame we do
[30:02] because there is material then we
[30:06] we put all our strength in it and
[30:09] with all our efforts in it and then when
[30:13] god says seek
[30:14] me that's not tangible
[30:19] well we don't do that we should not do
[30:21] that i should not do that
[30:23] god help me your intellectual faith my
[30:27] my uh believe it fine but unless the
[30:30] faith of god is down in your heart see
[30:32] your intellect your faith can accept it
[30:35] do that
[30:36] and just keep believing it with all your
[30:38] heart
[30:39] until god reveal it to you
[30:43] keep just believing keep just taking
[30:46] in the word that intellectual faith
[30:50] will become god's faith
[30:54] to believe all his words is so
[30:58] critical because when you believe god's
[31:01] word
[31:02] not in intellectual way but god's way
[31:06] no one can take it from you
[31:10] people will fall left and right
[31:13] situation will happen even if you hear
[31:17] that uh
[31:18] this great brother has
[31:22] done this something has happened to them
[31:25] yes you're gonna
[31:26] feel bad but
[31:29] yet you won't be moved
[31:34] no matter who comes or goes you will not
[31:38] be
[31:38] moved because you have god's faith
[31:41] in his word hallelujah
[31:46] is important we're living in a time
[31:49] that is very difficult we live in a time
[31:52] where
[31:53] demons are out
[31:56] 200 million of them
[32:00] really just ran many things
[32:03] can happen can happen to
[32:06] anybody but you
[32:09] need god's faith to stick to keep
[32:13] going
[32:17] you cannot young people you cannot say
[32:19] brothers
[32:20] this and that happened to him keep going
[32:25] if you have god's faith keep going
[32:29] amen he will make you to keep
[32:32] going amen
[32:39] oh my do you love him
[32:44] god's faith that's the only faith that
[32:47] actually exists
[32:50] it's uh it's uh it's called revelation
[32:56] that's what it's called what is the
[32:58] revelation i will give you my definition
[33:01] it is a glance into god's mind
[33:06] and god show you and say
[33:10] that's a revelation and everyone need it
[33:15] it's something it's god telling
[33:18] you in your heart this is the truth
[33:22] this word is the truth somewhere
[33:25] down there you cannot explain it
[33:29] but it tells you and that's why we are
[33:32] seeking
[33:33] for young people we say the religion of
[33:36] your father mother has to become your
[33:39] religion
[33:40] and for that to happen you got to have
[33:44] god's faith a revelation
[33:47] which is a glimpse into god's mind with
[33:52] a
[33:52] whip god allows you to peek
[33:55] inside his mind hallelujah
[34:00] amen it may not come with a sensation
[34:06] he may come with sensation
[34:10] body gotta be as
[34:13] strong faith in god you
[34:16] just know it no one can take it
[34:21] from you it's very important because
[34:25] the seven seals have revealed who christ
[34:29] is but they also have
[34:32] given us a look into the devil's work
[34:38] and none of his work
[34:43] is hidden now all his purpose
[34:47] as the pastor says it often here
[34:51] all the devil purpose when he
[34:54] is getting to you to give you
[34:57] sickness and depression and all this all
[35:00] he's trying to do is to get to your soul
[35:03] so that you can reject the word
[35:07] or you can become indifferent
[35:17] god give us that revelation that the
[35:20] peak
[35:20] in inside your mind
[35:24] oh my and then nothing that comes to me
[35:28] you know but every time we're very
[35:31] specific
[35:32] when you say no matter what
[35:35] it keeps saying no matter what stay with
[35:38] the world
[35:39] no matter what really there are so many
[35:41] things happening in life i'm telling you
[35:44] that to be an old man i can tell you
[35:48] that
[35:49] things happen in life but he said no
[35:52] matter what
[35:53] stay with the world stay with the world
[35:58] amen hallelujah you will never regret
[36:02] that decision
[36:04] there are many decisions that we made in
[36:06] life we will
[36:07] look back and regret not that one
[36:10] not with that one to recognize the
[36:13] message of your time
[36:15] and give all your heart
[36:19] you will never regret that hallelujah
[36:22] the devil
[36:23] he's oh my i'm gonna attack him now
[36:26] hallelujah hey man
[36:29] no matter what he attacks me i'm telling
[36:32] you sometime i punch him so
[36:34] hard so hard
[36:38] oh praise god
[36:42] amen the potential is here
[36:45] for you to have the eyes of god the
[36:47] potential is in you
[36:49] i'm just reminding you what you already
[36:52] have amen
[36:55] praise god amen
[36:59] amen
[37:02] oh my
[37:06] let's take a peek into other believers
[37:10] mind to see where they stand
[37:16] whether but i'm always preached with
[37:19] characters in the bible amen
[37:22] somebody criticized him he felt it
[37:26] but that's the way god made him
[37:30] you know let's look at peter's
[37:32] confession i wrote it this down
[37:39] john chapter 21
[37:42] you know that we read it last sunday
[37:45] here
[37:46] i guess
[37:49] john 21 15. so when
[37:53] they had dying jesus said to
[37:57] simon peter simon son of jonas
[38:01] lovers doubt me more than this
[38:05] you say unto him yeah lord thou knowest
[38:09] that i love thee he said unto him
[38:12] feed my lambs you say unto him
[38:16] again the second time simon's
[38:20] son of jonas loveth thou me he say unto
[38:23] him yeah lord
[38:24] thou knowest that i love thee you say
[38:27] unto him
[38:28] feed my sheep verse 7 17
[38:31] he said unto him the third time
[38:36] simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[38:39] peter was grieved because he said unto
[38:42] him
[38:43] the third time love has doubted me
[38:46] and he said unto him lord thou knowest
[38:49] all things thou knowest that i love thee
[38:53] jesus say unto him feed my sheep
[38:58] i want to take that character you know
[39:00] just a little bit of
[39:02] drama you know jesus look at peter
[39:06] everybody's there and he said to peter
[39:09] uh peter do you love me
[39:13] more than all these others peter said
[39:18] yep
[39:21] and then he say the second time
[39:25] peter loved that love that
[39:28] me more than others
[39:32] and peter said
[39:35] sure sure
[39:39] yeah i love you but when he say the
[39:42] third time
[39:44] peter now attention
[39:47] he he attracts his attention just like
[39:50] the prophet
[39:52] we constantly are distracted
[39:55] and the prophet will say before we start
[39:58] the line of prayer i take
[40:00] all spirits under my control in the name
[40:03] of the lord jesus christ
[40:05] amen now i need
[40:08] god to come down and speak to this man
[40:12] love thou may peter
[40:15] at that point he got into
[40:18] piercing because that's me
[40:22] speaking now it's like at the beginning
[40:25] it was just
[40:26] his body his flesh then he repeatedly
[40:30] again he goes into his mind
[40:33] yes you know i love you intellectual
[40:37] conception
[40:40] yeah i love you yeah
[40:43] then peter do you love me at that point
[40:47] peter is going to give an answer
[40:50] that says that lord
[40:54] you are the word amen
[40:58] and the word is like a double
[41:02] edged sword it discerned the thoughts
[41:06] and the intent of the heart
[41:10] even if i say it with my lips
[41:15] but you can go inside me
[41:18] and see that there's there is an eternal
[41:22] seed in me
[41:24] i love you you know it because you
[41:28] place that seed in me now this is not
[41:32] peter just answering in an
[41:35] intellectual way we just had a peek
[41:39] inside as a peer
[41:42] soul and this is
[41:45] peter pouring out his heart to the lord
[41:48] and say to him
[41:50] you know everything recognizing that
[41:54] god knows everything recognizing that
[41:58] the word jesus christ is a discerner of
[42:02] the thought
[42:03] and the intent of heart and nothing can
[42:06] be
[42:07] hidden from him is that right
[42:11] and that was the first message
[42:14] that the angel gave to brother branham
[42:18] he said god tell people that their
[42:20] thoughts
[42:21] are speaking louder they speak
[42:24] louder than the words
[42:30] this is the confession that
[42:33] peter had was the word is a discerner of
[42:37] the thoughts
[42:39] what can i hide from you lord
[42:42] amen
[42:47] are you with me amen
[42:50] oh hebrews 4 for the word
[42:53] of god is quick and powerful
[42:56] sharper than any two-aged sword
[42:59] preaching even to the dividing ascender
[43:02] of soul and spirit and the joints and
[43:05] marrow
[43:06] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[43:09] the
[43:09] intent of the heart we
[43:12] just look inside peter's
[43:15] heart deep inside him
[43:19] now he's speaking it's not just
[43:21] intellectual
[43:22] discourse this is
[43:26] speaking from the bottom of his heart
[43:30] the words discern the thoughts
[43:34] and the intent therefore i cannot hide
[43:38] from him anything therefore i will go
[43:41] myself to him i don't need god
[43:44] to twist my arm
[43:47] to force me
[43:51] but i will just go to him because i love
[43:53] him
[43:54] very much amen
[44:00] do you understand church does he make
[44:02] sense
[44:04] i will know only when i hear amen
[44:06] somewhere
[44:09] amen hallelujah
[44:15] and i used to preach constantly i knew
[44:18] monday will be a bad day for me
[44:23] because sunday i really beat him
[44:26] you know oh my praise god
[44:30] another confession the greek woman's
[44:34] confession matthew 15
[44:36] 22 and behold a woman of
[44:39] canon came out of the same course and
[44:42] cry unto him
[44:44] saying have mercy on me o lord
[44:47] thou son of david my daughter is
[44:49] grievously
[44:50] a vexed with a devil
[44:54] but he answered her not a word and his
[44:57] disciple came
[44:59] and besotted him saying send her
[45:02] away for she crieth after us
[45:05] but he answered and said unto and said
[45:09] i'm not sent
[45:10] unto the lost ship of the house of
[45:13] israel
[45:14] the first time the woman said to
[45:18] him we know the story we know how
[45:20] brother branham put it
[45:22] we know that the woman calls him
[45:25] son of david because she heard people
[45:28] saying son of david
[45:30] it was just what she heard other people
[45:33] saying
[45:34] and she just repeated son of david
[45:38] be merciful to me and then
[45:42] jesus did not answer her
[45:45] then when he said i'm not
[45:48] sent to uh
[45:52] i'm only sent to the house of israel
[45:57] then he learned she learned that her
[46:00] doctrine was
[46:01] wrong so she's
[46:05] she somebody said to her
[46:09] don't call him son of david call him
[46:12] the lord
[46:17] they came verse matthew 15
[46:21] 25 then came she and worshiped him
[46:23] saying lord
[46:24] help me but he answered and say it's not
[46:28] meat to take the children bread and to
[46:30] cast it to
[46:31] dogs so this is the third
[46:35] time that is happening this woman
[46:38] is persistent and she's changing the way
[46:43] the first time she says um
[46:49] son of david and somebody maybe have
[46:51] said
[46:52] oh call him lord because that's uh the
[46:56] doctrine she heard it and she repeated
[46:58] lord
[46:59] and jesus want to make sure she means
[47:02] business
[47:04] because all that was maybe something she
[47:08] heard other people saying and she
[47:11] and jesus said to her the last thing
[47:14] that will
[47:15] make her to be discouraged
[47:18] and say that it's not me to take the
[47:22] children bread and to cast it to dogs
[47:26] and this is her confession the greatest
[47:30] thing
[47:30] in this confession is when she
[47:33] say truth lord
[47:39] because the truth lord means that
[47:42] whatever you just said i don't
[47:46] understand it
[47:48] i don't know what it is but it is the
[47:51] truth
[47:52] so the confession of this woman is the
[47:55] word
[47:56] is always the truth
[48:00] no matter if i don't understand it
[48:03] no matter how if it doesn't make sense
[48:06] the word is always the truth
[48:11] that's a powerful church i don't
[48:14] understand it
[48:16] it doesn't make sense to me to because
[48:19] dog
[48:20] but it is it must be the truth
[48:24] i remember going to church with some
[48:27] friends
[48:29] bringing them to church when i found the
[48:31] message
[48:33] all the message found me
[48:37] i brought some friends to church they
[48:39] did not know where we were going
[48:42] and we got to church and they saw people
[48:45] they sit in a church the minister
[48:47] preached about
[48:49] the the throne of god in revelation
[48:53] after the service this my friends say
[48:56] i did not understand anything
[49:00] but it was the truth
[49:03] amen i didn't understand anything but it
[49:06] was the truth
[49:08] he said because the word
[49:11] is not an intellectual thing
[49:16] it's as it's a spiritual that you
[49:18] discern it
[49:23] so today we cannot be
[49:28] apologizing for brother branham say this
[49:31] but here he say that and here he say
[49:35] this
[49:36] we can't i don't understand why it
[49:39] placed things the way it plays but we
[49:42] cannot apologize
[49:43] for it because the truth is the truth
[49:47] even if we don't understand it
[49:56] amen
[50:00] root confession uh
[50:05] i think you get it now as you can see
[50:09] ruth is coming
[50:13] with her mother in law naomi
[50:17] the it's a movement that everybody is
[50:20] talking about
[50:21] going to palestine and it was like a
[50:24] movement
[50:25] but yet after a naomi speaks
[50:29] to her daughter in law about
[50:33] uh if you go
[50:37] to palestine i don't have children for
[50:40] you
[50:42] to marry i don't have anybody
[50:46] of age that can take you as wives
[50:49] she start laying in front of them
[50:54] all the obstacles
[50:57] that come in a christian's life
[51:02] and when they saw this then
[51:05] orpah decided that i can't
[51:09] keep going she was a
[51:12] borderline christian so she
[51:16] he could go with the word to a
[51:19] certain point but look
[51:23] ruth did not have anything
[51:27] that she could put her hands on
[51:30] she did not know where they're going
[51:34] what house they gonna have where they're
[51:37] gonna sit
[51:39] where they're gonna be living but
[51:42] she declared that thy people
[51:46] shall be my people look a root said
[51:50] in trade me not to leave thee
[51:53] and to return from following after thee
[51:56] for wither thou goes i will go
[51:59] whether thou lodges our lords
[52:02] thy people shall be my people and
[52:06] thy god my god
[52:11] hallelujah
[52:14] oops sorry
[52:19] now i just wanted to
[52:23] to take that subject and and
[52:27] again show a pattern of
[52:31] when you look at all these characters
[52:35] that we have in the bible it
[52:38] looks like at the end
[52:42] at the at the end at the third
[52:47] portion the portion of god because there
[52:50] is
[52:51] the body there is the spirit and the
[52:54] soul
[52:55] and at the third level we can
[52:59] see exactly what is
[53:02] inside these people what is
[53:05] actually move these people
[53:08] there is a confession of the life
[53:11] what they truly believe that's what we
[53:14] see
[53:15] and we see it at the third time
[53:18] we see the woman we see the greek woman
[53:23] she first says the son of david
[53:27] that was the first then she says the
[53:29] lord
[53:31] then she will make a confession that
[53:34] comes
[53:34] deep from her heart
[53:37] and that's what she really is because
[53:42] god is not really interested in the
[53:45] formality
[53:47] what we say because somebody else
[53:50] said but he want to read
[53:54] what is inside us
[53:57] amen the reality how we look
[54:00] how we look at god what what is our
[54:04] view about him are you with me
[54:13] discernment of the body of the lord
[54:16] 1959 and now our eternal destination
[54:21] is not all together determined by what
[54:25] we see
[54:26] and what we hear but is determined on
[54:30] what
[54:30] discernment we have of
[54:33] what we see and what we hear
[54:40] come in the church and
[54:44] hearing the word the way we hear it
[54:47] and just go back and say well it's okay
[54:51] i've been there they preach they preach
[54:54] just like us
[54:55] and it's the same thing
[55:02] but the prophet says that our eternal
[55:06] destination is not determined
[55:10] by what we see but
[55:13] but the discernment we
[55:16] have about what we see and what we hear
[55:21] it's about the discernment and
[55:24] see things the way god sees them
[55:28] hallelujah i want to
[55:33] turn a little bit a different
[55:36] gear the other day
[55:39] i was thinking to a message i want to
[55:43] give my message
[55:44] titled end of doctrines
[55:49] and i said okay end of doctrines
[55:52] then i uh
[55:56] i said this one i was thinking that this
[55:58] one will have a lot of disclaimers
[56:02] and of doctrines
[56:06] ah everything we do is doctrines
[56:09] but i'm talking about the fight for
[56:12] doctrines
[56:13] so it just came to me that i want to
[56:16] talk about the end of
[56:17] doctrines because doctrines are part of
[56:21] church ages they are part of
[56:25] cycles it's just me
[56:28] trying to express something
[56:32] and then i came to church on sunday
[56:35] and i heard a pastor saying the seventh
[56:38] seal is not a doctrine
[56:41] oh so i was not that far
[56:44] off
[56:48] end of doctrines
[56:51] you see
[56:57] ah luke chapter
[57:00] 18 says that when the
[57:04] son of man cometh shall he find
[57:07] faith on earth
[57:11] is not finding doctrines
[57:15] it's not finding good behavior
[57:19] but is to find faith what faith the
[57:23] faith of god
[57:25] and the faith of god recognized the
[57:28] message of your time
[57:30] and his hour
[57:37] it makes end to doctrines
[57:41] why why can i say that is because
[57:46] when you recognize him when he comes
[57:52] then he is the one who will adjust your
[57:55] doctrine
[57:57] therefore the problem is to recognize
[58:00] him
[58:00] first therefore the seventh
[58:04] seal is the seventh seal
[58:08] is not the doctrine he's a person
[58:11] he comes you recognize him
[58:15] and when you recognize him he starts
[58:18] adjusting your doctrines
[58:21] you recognize him receive his
[58:24] word manifest his word
[58:28] then there is no doctrine what that
[58:30] means
[58:31] we can't fight about doctrines
[58:35] because we recognize him
[58:40] and he say when the son of man cometh
[58:44] will he find faith
[58:48] that's what the most important what
[58:51] faith now we know
[58:52] is the fate of god
[58:56] and that's what matters because you will
[58:59] see as we reading
[59:01] that everyone had a doctrine
[59:06] and jesus when he came he was not he was
[59:09] not like
[59:09] what is your doctrine are you
[59:13] a what a pharisee yes
[59:17] he never asked that
[59:20] is the problem is to recognize him
[59:23] recognize when he comes so today
[59:27] let me just say if you recognize him
[59:31] in the formation of his bride
[59:34] and you start manifesting his attribute
[59:38] there will be no fight about doctrines
[59:43] amen there will be no fight
[59:47] because he's going to adjust that fight
[59:50] he's going to adjust that doctrine i
[59:51] mean
[59:53] yeah you will tell me oh no brother when
[59:56] the squeeze
[59:57] comes and then we will have the same
[1:00:00] doctrine
[1:00:01] because brethren say that yeah in some
[1:00:03] way
[1:00:04] but you can be squeezed only
[1:00:08] if you are squeezable
[1:00:11] you gotta be in that
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] fight you gotta be in the body to be
[1:00:18] squeezed out
[1:00:22] is that right yeah so therefore
[1:00:26] i this is the end of the dying world
[1:00:31] the end of the seals the end of the ages
[1:00:35] the end of everything a rocket has been
[1:00:39] blown out and a rocket open
[1:00:42] another rocket and another rocket and
[1:00:45] and there is the
[1:00:46] ushering of the millennium
[1:00:50] where are the doctrines it's the end
[1:00:54] we used to have we used to have we
[1:00:57] we used to but we come to the end
[1:01:01] now we gotta recognize him if you
[1:01:04] recognize him that he came
[1:01:07] and he is in the body
[1:01:10] that i have to manifest him i'm telling
[1:01:14] you there'll be no doctrines
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:19] thank god the uh the pastor had an
[1:01:22] opening for me i could not miss that one
[1:01:30] the woman of the uh the woman at the
[1:01:33] well
[1:01:34] had a doctrine
[1:01:38] do you know that let's read
[1:01:46] john 4 the woman say unto him sir
[1:01:49] i perceive that art a prophet
[1:01:53] and then she start her doctrine okay she
[1:01:56] has a
[1:01:57] fight with the jews about the doctrine
[1:02:01] but what she did first was i recognized
[1:02:05] you
[1:02:06] are a prophet recognizing the message
[1:02:10] of your uh of your time that's what
[1:02:14] the son of man is looking for
[1:02:18] then the doctrine will be adjusted
[1:02:23] our father's worship in this mountain
[1:02:29] and he say that that
[1:02:32] in jerusalem is the place where men
[1:02:34] ought to worship
[1:02:36] jesus say unto her woman well
[1:02:40] yeah this the question you asking is for
[1:02:42] the end time
[1:02:45] you know if we could update the answer
[1:02:50] but believe me we
[1:02:53] isha neither in the mountain nor yet in
[1:02:56] jerusalem
[1:02:58] worship the father he worship
[1:03:03] he worship he know not
[1:03:06] what we know what we worship for
[1:03:09] salvation is of
[1:03:11] the jews but the hour cometh and now
[1:03:14] is when the true worshipers will worship
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] father in this in spirit and the truth
[1:03:20] for the father
[1:03:21] seeketh such to worship him god is the
[1:03:25] spirit
[1:03:26] and they that worship him must worship
[1:03:29] him
[1:03:30] in spirit and in truth
[1:03:33] he just adjusted corrected
[1:03:38] her doctrine but you know
[1:03:41] first it was up she has to recognize
[1:03:46] him when it comes
[1:03:50] can you imagine people say we are
[1:03:52] waiting for the squeeze to come
[1:03:54] and they don't recognize him when he
[1:03:58] come in the formation of the bride
[1:04:01] and the waiting for his squeeze
[1:04:05] see he did not say that he said when the
[1:04:08] son of man comes
[1:04:10] will he find faith
[1:04:14] it was about faith the faith of god
[1:04:17] in his word
[1:04:22] is that correcting the woman i won't go
[1:04:26] into the details of it but he
[1:04:29] said well in terms of doctrine
[1:04:32] i am more close to the jews because
[1:04:36] you know they were god chosen people and
[1:04:39] god give
[1:04:40] them some things to do
[1:04:44] and he he give them
[1:04:47] the tabernacle he
[1:04:50] give them the sacrifice
[1:04:54] and all that so but
[1:04:57] all the things actually were just
[1:05:01] types and shadows
[1:05:04] but the reality will come at the end
[1:05:08] when christ comes in
[1:05:12] is the formation the formation of this
[1:05:14] bride
[1:05:15] all the shadows and types are over
[1:05:19] so where are the doctrines
[1:05:27] well you could say to her like
[1:05:31] in this message the dedication
[1:05:34] because she's talking about temples
[1:05:38] she talks about mountains should we go
[1:05:41] to jerusalem
[1:05:42] or should we go to the mountain and the
[1:05:45] night
[1:05:46] and that night the lord came to this
[1:05:49] seer
[1:05:50] and the prophet nathan and say go tell
[1:05:53] my servant david see
[1:05:55] i like that in other words i admire his
[1:05:59] courage and his
[1:06:00] thoughts of me to build me a place but
[1:06:03] he say
[1:06:04] i have not dwell in house i have not
[1:06:06] have a place to stay
[1:06:08] when i come down to earth to look my
[1:06:11] people over
[1:06:12] you see i never complain that i don't
[1:06:15] have
[1:06:16] a place to stay yeah david
[1:06:19] the idea of building something to for me
[1:06:23] is good i appreciate it but i never
[1:06:26] asked
[1:06:27] you know and you say this i have
[1:06:31] had a place to stay even since i brought
[1:06:34] up
[1:06:35] israel i have not commanded any of the
[1:06:38] judges
[1:06:38] to build me a house of cedar
[1:06:41] but i have went from 10 to tent
[1:06:46] that's what i like i like to go from
[1:06:50] tenth to tenth now i put your
[1:06:54] spiritual you know mask now
[1:06:57] you know put your spiritual mask
[1:07:01] oh that was good that is
[1:07:05] that is not just about the form of it
[1:07:07] today
[1:07:09] no this is important no this is
[1:07:11] important i have to repeat that
[1:07:14] he say i never asked for a house
[1:07:17] all right i went from
[1:07:21] 10th to 10th okay let me do it again
[1:07:25] i went from 10th to 10th to 10 to 10 to
[1:07:28] 10
[1:07:28] i'm happy with it i never asked for a
[1:07:31] temple
[1:07:33] are you with me i love and he said now
[1:07:36] brother bottom comment
[1:07:38] is that is not just about the form of it
[1:07:41] today
[1:07:43] it's not the form of it today
[1:07:46] is that what he's doing today god in
[1:07:48] formation of the bride
[1:07:50] going from 10th to 10th
[1:07:54] praise god amen
[1:07:57] i've went from 10 to 10
[1:08:00] and never asked for a house
[1:08:04] well if you make a house it's okay it's
[1:08:06] still me
[1:08:07] in the house me in a tent
[1:08:11] temple amen
[1:08:14] hallelujah praise god
[1:08:18] i've went from ten to ten you know
[1:08:21] what about them say that
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] in my father's domain
[1:08:31] there are many houses
[1:08:36] some houses have blue eyes
[1:08:39] green eyes
[1:08:44] brown eyes
[1:08:47] dark hair god house
[1:08:52] hallelujah you are the saint of god
[1:08:56] the house the woman had a doctrine about
[1:09:00] mountains temple
[1:09:04] christ say to her because she recognized
[1:09:07] him he said i'm going to correct
[1:09:10] your doctrine if we do
[1:09:13] believe in him in as he came in our
[1:09:17] time is going to correct all that the
[1:09:20] end of all doctrines
[1:09:25] that's what a chad's fault
[1:09:36] god has never in the way back 62
[1:09:40] but ibn says god has never left himself
[1:09:44] without a witness and god had a witness
[1:09:47] in that day
[1:09:48] but his father hated this uh
[1:09:51] witness and his name was elijah the
[1:09:54] prophet
[1:09:55] and his mother hated this witness but
[1:09:58] yet
[1:09:58] it was god witness stood
[1:10:02] just the same god's always got a people
[1:10:05] somewhere that he can point to and and
[1:10:08] say
[1:10:09] that's it and i want to be among that
[1:10:12] number
[1:10:13] i'm sure we all want to be there it's
[1:10:16] the desire of
[1:10:17] every heart amen
[1:10:20] that's what god's looking for when he
[1:10:23] comes
[1:10:24] somebody recognize him
[1:10:27] and some somebody lives
[1:10:30] his life and whatever i'm saying
[1:10:34] i want to be there it's the end of
[1:10:37] doctrines
[1:10:39] we want to be among that number
[1:10:43] that god can say this is my people
[1:10:47] look at them they are an example of what
[1:10:50] i am
[1:10:51] they are reflecting my life in theirs
[1:10:55] they have surrendered their life and i
[1:10:57] am reflecting
[1:10:59] my life through the earth
[1:11:04] if i reflect christ's life you reflect
[1:11:07] christ's life
[1:11:08] these are the persons who reflect this
[1:11:10] the church to reflect
[1:11:12] there will be no fight for doctrines
[1:11:16] because the reality is here he is not a
[1:11:20] doctrine
[1:11:21] he is a person and his name is the word
[1:11:26] amen amen
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:34] nicodemus doctrine
[1:11:37] i'm going with characters
[1:11:42] john 3 there was a man of the pharisees
[1:11:46] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[1:11:49] the same came to jesus by night brother
[1:11:51] branham defended nicodemus for coming
[1:11:54] that night so he came
[1:11:57] anyway and when you come to jesus
[1:12:00] you don't go back the same
[1:12:03] and say unto him rabbi we know that
[1:12:06] art a teacher come from god and no man
[1:12:10] can come
[1:12:11] do these miracles that thou do as except
[1:12:14] god be with him but accept it it will be
[1:12:19] a problem political problem we cannot
[1:12:22] accept it but
[1:12:23] i came to tell you this and
[1:12:26] jesus answered him very very i say unto
[1:12:30] thee
[1:12:30] except a man be born again you cannot
[1:12:33] see the kingdom of god
[1:12:35] once again it brings him back to the
[1:12:39] faith of god
[1:12:40] god faith the revelation nicodemus you
[1:12:44] have
[1:12:45] a false doctrine you think that
[1:12:48] god thinks is a group thing
[1:12:51] you say we in our group
[1:12:55] in up in our synhendren
[1:12:59] with the pharisees we we
[1:13:03] believe that you are
[1:13:06] a teacher from god
[1:13:10] nicodemus that's a problem
[1:13:13] but i'm glad that you came
[1:13:17] now i'm gonna talk to you
[1:13:21] so you cannot walk with too many people
[1:13:25] this is an individual walk with god
[1:13:29] you are starting wrong it's good to have
[1:13:33] fellowship
[1:13:33] with one another but this is an
[1:13:36] individual walk with god
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:39] nicodemus you need to be born again
[1:13:44] you need this message to become a
[1:13:47] personal revelation of god
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:51] and that's the problem you have
[1:13:54] of course they had a long conversation
[1:13:56] where nicodem did not understand
[1:13:58] anything
[1:13:59] and jesus had a sense of humor to tell
[1:14:02] him
[1:14:03] you were a doctor in what
[1:14:06] and you don't know these things he
[1:14:09] didn't say that
[1:14:11] sorry but
[1:14:14] yeah it did the right thing
[1:14:18] church i'm going back to say
[1:14:21] if we recognize the word that came in
[1:14:24] our time
[1:14:26] we reflect that word all the
[1:14:29] arguments and things will disappear
[1:14:41] nathaniel doctrines was a very simple
[1:14:44] one
[1:14:45] nothing can come up nothing can come
[1:14:49] out of another church like nazareth
[1:14:54] if anything good come it will be us
[1:14:59] therefore who is preaching the doctrine
[1:15:03] we always preaching the christ as come
[1:15:06] in the formation of the bride
[1:15:11] do we know where he comes from what
[1:15:12] school is he from
[1:15:15] anything good must come from us it's an
[1:15:18] arrogant spirit
[1:15:20] i kind of say it sarcastically but
[1:15:22] that's
[1:15:23] the only humor maybe i missed when
[1:15:26] people were
[1:15:27] you know receiving good humor
[1:15:31] and i came late and they gave me some
[1:15:35] and that's what you hear
[1:15:45] john chapter 1 verse 45 philip findeth
[1:15:49] nathanael
[1:15:50] and say unto him we found him whom
[1:15:53] moses in the law and the prophet did
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:57] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
[1:16:00] and nathanael said unto him can there
[1:16:04] any good thing come out of nazareth
[1:16:07] philip said unto him come and see
[1:16:12] so he has already the doctrine but the
[1:16:14] problem is
[1:16:15] he has to recognize whom god sent
[1:16:19] at that time no matter what is doctrine
[1:16:24] he has to recognize the message
[1:16:28] and his time when
[1:16:32] in the time not to recognize when is
[1:16:36] past
[1:16:36] but now present time
[1:16:41] everything starts by faith
[1:16:44] faith of god and that the foundation
[1:16:50] the foundation of the house is
[1:16:53] faith in the word of god that god sent
[1:16:56] for you in your time
[1:17:03] do we agree
[1:17:10] jesus saw nathanael coming to him and
[1:17:13] said
[1:17:15] of him behold an israelite indeed in
[1:17:18] whom
[1:17:19] is no guile nothing is say unto him
[1:17:22] whence taoists knowest doubt me jesus
[1:17:25] answered and said unto him
[1:17:27] before that philip called thee when thou
[1:17:30] was
[1:17:31] under the fig tree i saw thee
[1:17:35] nothing answered and said unto him rabbi
[1:17:39] thou are the son of god thou art the
[1:17:42] king of israel
[1:17:44] doctrines god
[1:17:48] something good can come from nazareth
[1:17:51] i heard the word even there her word has
[1:17:56] answered my question
[1:17:59] oh my
[1:18:02] amen do we agree
[1:18:07] amen maybe we will stop those
[1:18:11] things is the end of christianity
[1:18:18] i come from a pentecostal background
[1:18:21] when i left we we bought with us the
[1:18:24] pentecostal
[1:18:26] luggage in the message boom
[1:18:30] we start repeating the same thing and
[1:18:32] the cycle is still going
[1:18:34] until when
[1:18:37] we got to stop that it's over
[1:18:43] when he say that it's the end of the
[1:18:46] church ages
[1:18:47] the end of this the end of vows the end
[1:18:50] of this
[1:18:51] the end of that even the ushering into
[1:18:54] the millennium
[1:18:56] would you know what is ushering
[1:18:59] is well the wedding is starting the
[1:19:02] ashes are ushering
[1:19:04] he said waiting there or not
[1:19:08] the ushering so basically it's telling
[1:19:11] us that
[1:19:12] christ came in the name of sons
[1:19:15] son of man son of god
[1:19:18] right son of man before he comes
[1:19:22] as son of david but now the prophet said
[1:19:26] this is
[1:19:26] everything that was stopping him from
[1:19:29] going
[1:19:30] into son of david is over
[1:19:36] is it ushering into the millennium
[1:19:39] it's going to switch and go to israel
[1:19:44] and tell us is already being assured in
[1:19:50] hallelujah is later than we think
[1:19:55] amen i want to take another one
[1:19:58] oh my
[1:20:04] the mistake sometimes we make
[1:20:08] david instruction to solomon
[1:20:13] first king two one now the days of david
[1:20:17] drew night
[1:20:18] that he should die and he charged
[1:20:21] solomon his son
[1:20:22] saying i go the way of all the earth
[1:20:27] be thou strong therefore and
[1:20:30] show thyself a man and keep
[1:20:33] the charge of the lord thy god to walk
[1:20:36] in his ways
[1:20:37] to keep his statutes and his
[1:20:40] commandments
[1:20:41] judgment and testimonies as
[1:20:44] it's written in the law of moses
[1:20:48] that thou mayest prosper in all that
[1:20:52] thou doest and with wither with her
[1:20:56] so ever thou turn us
[1:20:59] thyself
[1:21:03] that the lord may continue his word with
[1:21:06] which he spake concerning me saying
[1:21:10] if thy children take yeed to the way
[1:21:14] to walk before me in truth
[1:21:17] with all their heart and with all their
[1:21:20] soul
[1:21:21] they shall not fail thee say he
[1:21:25] a man on the throne of israel moreover
[1:21:28] thou knowest also the what joe
[1:21:32] joab the son of zeroia
[1:21:35] uh did to me and
[1:21:38] what it did to the two captains of
[1:21:41] the host of israel unto abner
[1:21:44] the son of nir and unto hamas
[1:21:48] amassa the son of jeter
[1:21:51] whom he slew and shed the blood of
[1:21:55] war and peace and
[1:21:58] put the blood of war upon his girl
[1:22:02] that was about his loins and his
[1:22:05] shoes that were on his feet what he's
[1:22:08] doing now
[1:22:10] is telling his son solomon i'm leaving
[1:22:14] but you will have to deal with people
[1:22:17] that i did not
[1:22:18] avenge from you will avenge me
[1:22:21] you will do this we'll do that
[1:22:25] and let's continue do
[1:22:28] the therefore according to that wisdom
[1:22:30] and let not
[1:22:31] his uh head
[1:22:35] go down to the grave in peace but show
[1:22:38] kindness unto the sons of barzillai
[1:22:42] the gilead gilead died
[1:22:45] and let them be of those that eat
[1:22:49] at thy table for so they came to me
[1:22:52] when i fled because of absalom thy
[1:22:54] brother
[1:22:56] and behold that has with thee
[1:22:59] she may the son of gera
[1:23:02] a benjamite of ba huram
[1:23:05] which cursed me with grievous curse in
[1:23:08] the day when
[1:23:10] i went to mahanna him
[1:23:14] but he came down to meet me at jordan
[1:23:18] and i swear to him by the lord saying i
[1:23:20] will not put thee to death
[1:23:22] with the sword now therefore hold him
[1:23:26] not the guitarness
[1:23:29] giftless for thou
[1:23:32] art a wise man knoweth and knoweth
[1:23:36] what taoist to do unto him
[1:23:39] but his head will bring
[1:23:42] thou down to the grave with blood so
[1:23:45] david slept
[1:23:47] with his fathers and was buried in the
[1:23:50] city of david
[1:23:55] i want to just take a few moments here
[1:23:58] i'm
[1:23:59] winding down and i mean the subject is
[1:24:02] wrong but
[1:24:02] let's just say that but you see
[1:24:07] david was a war man
[1:24:11] he did his part what god called him to
[1:24:14] do
[1:24:16] and he turn and say solomon there is a
[1:24:19] second part
[1:24:22] okay and david what he did
[1:24:25] was uh secure
[1:24:29] israel get rid of the philistines
[1:24:34] and have the borders of israel
[1:24:38] well defined
[1:24:43] david place the word
[1:24:48] and separate the message with the
[1:24:51] denominations
[1:24:53] he made sure that we know the true
[1:24:57] baptism is in the name of the lord jesus
[1:25:00] christ
[1:25:01] that there is only one god
[1:25:04] his name is jesus christ he placed
[1:25:08] all the things the serpents seed and
[1:25:12] all the things that it clearly
[1:25:15] shows the difference between us and the
[1:25:18] denominations
[1:25:20] and you have no question if you come
[1:25:22] from a denomination
[1:25:24] you get there you know that there is a
[1:25:27] clear uh difference
[1:25:30] between where you come and where you
[1:25:34] ended up he did that then he turned to
[1:25:38] solomon
[1:25:39] and say solomon now go
[1:25:43] after the house of israel
[1:25:48] now we can establish good doctrine and
[1:25:52] good fences like that
[1:25:55] that is clear that we have the truth
[1:25:58] but we got to bring it home
[1:26:02] in the message community
[1:26:05] we cannot feel to tell the truth
[1:26:09] because love true love is corrective
[1:26:14] we gotta speak to ourself in
[1:26:17] a message community to tell each other
[1:26:20] the truth the world
[1:26:22] doesn't tell each other the truth you
[1:26:24] got to be
[1:26:25] correct this way that way but in
[1:26:30] in the message community we gotta tell
[1:26:33] the truth no matter
[1:26:34] what of course we tell it with
[1:26:38] love we tell us it for a good
[1:26:41] reason that no one is left
[1:26:44] behind like good marines that
[1:26:48] go into war you don't want anyone left
[1:26:51] behind
[1:26:54] we look inside ourself solomon
[1:26:57] i'm going but you turn to the house
[1:27:02] of israel and
[1:27:05] do a cleanup don't spare this
[1:27:10] don't spare that are you with me
[1:27:13] and that's the thing we do
[1:27:18] and when we do it is not arrogance
[1:27:21] it's not look at us we are this
[1:27:24] and that it is a true love of god
[1:27:28] no one is left behind
[1:27:33] you know maybe one day young people if
[1:27:37] the lord
[1:27:38] tarries when we say the lord terrorists
[1:27:40] that these bodies are not changed with
[1:27:43] it doesn't come now to take us home
[1:27:47] maybe one day you will look back
[1:27:51] and say because usually spiritual things
[1:27:56] usually you look back
[1:28:00] and see are you with me
[1:28:04] maybe you will look back and say one of
[1:28:07] the best things that happened
[1:28:09] to my church was the day
[1:28:12] we addressed the music issue
[1:28:17] it was a serious issue
[1:28:20] maybe some people get you know did not
[1:28:23] understand
[1:28:25] but that's the cleaning of the house of
[1:28:27] israel
[1:28:29] me i can say that because i can look
[1:28:32] back
[1:28:33] i can see people that we
[1:28:36] were baptized with where
[1:28:40] they are you know you
[1:28:43] two young people you may see that
[1:28:46] that something actually changed when
[1:28:50] the pastor spoke against the music
[1:28:54] of the world creeping in the message
[1:28:59] you know why because they it it has
[1:29:03] anointing yeah well
[1:29:06] some good songs get left off yeah yeah
[1:29:10] yeah i still need i still have my meat
[1:29:14] even if i chop something remove this
[1:29:17] i still have my meat you know you
[1:29:19] understand
[1:29:20] yeah something can go here and there
[1:29:23] that's not the point
[1:29:25] the point is to address that to address
[1:29:29] the music
[1:29:31] the world music then when you look back
[1:29:34] something happened because those things
[1:29:36] have anointing
[1:29:38] demon's power i heard
[1:29:41] a musician in a conductor
[1:29:45] of music classic music in boston
[1:29:48] saying that the music goes straight
[1:29:51] to the soul
[1:29:55] well i i never heard barbara i'm saying
[1:29:57] that but that
[1:29:58] seems to be right
[1:30:01] straight to the soul it give
[1:30:05] to you people this cold
[1:30:09] and different attitude
[1:30:12] it comes with an anointing it comes with
[1:30:15] a fashion
[1:30:17] and a way of singing a way of dressing
[1:30:20] the way of doing this it has anointing
[1:30:26] and when the world comes no matter how
[1:30:29] much the pastor has seek god
[1:30:33] faith and cry out and get some
[1:30:36] manna it doesn't do anything
[1:30:40] because what the anointing under which
[1:30:43] the children are
[1:30:47] therefore addressing that was critical
[1:30:53] amen i remember one time uh
[1:30:56] in a church where a a girl
[1:31:00] went to church when she thinks that i
[1:31:03] have to go to church because my parents
[1:31:05] would not let me stay home
[1:31:07] so she had her headset
[1:31:11] on her way to church
[1:31:17] i'm telling if she's listening to that
[1:31:18] music of the world
[1:31:20] is she comes with the anointing
[1:31:24] when the message is being preached okay
[1:31:28] she will go uh i'm not criticizing it
[1:31:32] go to the bathroom but staying
[1:31:35] long time you know
[1:31:39] and then come back and then when the
[1:31:42] church is
[1:31:43] over she puts back that's it
[1:31:46] what is it wiping out everything
[1:31:51] shared and
[1:31:54] inviting those demons
[1:31:58] have code and different demons
[1:32:02] to come again and you wonder
[1:32:06] why the message has no effect
[1:32:09] is the music somebody has to say it
[1:32:14] hallelujah somebody has to say it
[1:32:17] it's demon powers they're coming but
[1:32:20] they can't hide because the seals are
[1:32:22] open
[1:32:23] and i'm pointing that to the people
[1:32:27] and it's done in love no arrogance god
[1:32:30] has no arrogant spirit
[1:32:34] but he got to be saved
[1:32:45] praise god
[1:32:48] i heard the testimony but it's just a
[1:32:51] testimony
[1:32:52] i don't know but it could just be true
[1:32:56] because brother i'm talking about a
[1:32:58] demon spirit
[1:33:00] he knew it very well but he just talked
[1:33:03] about it in
[1:33:04] doctrinal way or teaching way
[1:33:08] but he's in you sometimes when he say
[1:33:11] don't do this young people don't do that
[1:33:14] don't wear those shoes like this
[1:33:19] he sees he could see the demons
[1:33:23] they followed him at home
[1:33:27] at the hotel where he slips they come
[1:33:30] sometimes they come like with chains
[1:33:34] sometimes they appear face to face with
[1:33:37] him
[1:33:38] you have no you have no power with god
[1:33:41] they tell him you have no power cold
[1:33:45] and different all that why are they
[1:33:48] telling him
[1:33:49] to discourage him yeah
[1:33:57] i heard the testimony let's say that one
[1:34:01] day
[1:34:01] brothers went to a hotel
[1:34:05] they spent the night at that hotel and
[1:34:07] they heard
[1:34:09] that it was in the time of brother
[1:34:11] branham
[1:34:13] that they heard this were in voices
[1:34:17] in that room but the pranam is my god
[1:34:23] they went to tell brother branham we
[1:34:25] were at the hotel room
[1:34:26] and we heard this but i'm saying the
[1:34:29] people that believes me to be
[1:34:32] jesus way in the room
[1:34:36] right well they create an atmosphere and
[1:34:39] the devil
[1:34:40] loves to live in those type of
[1:34:44] atmosphere
[1:34:46] that's why we cannot neglect the good
[1:34:49] atmosphere
[1:34:50] of what we say what we do it has
[1:34:54] spirits
[1:34:58] no it's not the legalism is the truth
[1:35:02] it's the opening of the word that tells
[1:35:04] us 200
[1:35:06] million the demons are after the bride
[1:35:13] the way we fight back is with the world
[1:35:21] church i want to just say that solomon
[1:35:25] did a great job to clean up the house of
[1:35:28] israel
[1:35:31] of course it was killing this
[1:35:35] kill this one spare this one but
[1:35:38] it was old testament killing
[1:35:42] in old testament was to destroy
[1:35:45] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:35:49] god
[1:35:53] but solomon forget the first instruction
[1:36:01] to walk in god's word
[1:36:05] so again the three things first of all
[1:36:09] david secured the borders of the message
[1:36:14] second thing he said solomon go
[1:36:18] after the message community
[1:36:22] all right and the third thing
[1:36:25] that solomon should do was to
[1:36:29] talk to come here amen
[1:36:33] he went after the house
[1:36:37] of israel but he has to come into this
[1:36:40] house
[1:36:41] his own house he forget that
[1:36:45] once we forget this is not
[1:36:48] outside there it is in us then
[1:36:52] you see where solomon ended up
[1:36:57] the women brought him back
[1:37:00] into idolatry
[1:37:07] i want to take a few minutes to talk
[1:37:10] about
[1:37:10] another cold and and different
[1:37:14] spirit
[1:37:18] the cleaning up that solomon did
[1:37:22] praise god it gave us courage to
[1:37:25] continue
[1:37:27] to speak the truth sometimes
[1:37:30] people can call it whatever they want to
[1:37:33] call it
[1:37:34] they can call it the legalism but
[1:37:37] somebody needs it somebody say
[1:37:41] god search me if there is anything
[1:37:44] in my life but taking those demon spirit
[1:37:48] this
[1:37:48] anointing from the young people maybe
[1:37:52] one day they will look back and say
[1:37:55] something changed since that time
[1:38:07] are you with me cold and indifferent to
[1:38:11] jezebel
[1:38:14] you know when we talk about
[1:38:18] jezebel we can see her
[1:38:22] need for power and domination we heard
[1:38:25] that
[1:38:26] and when we look at elijah we can see
[1:38:31] self-preservation all that
[1:38:35] when but we also know elijah as a spirit
[1:38:39] in a human being
[1:38:41] it was moody right
[1:38:45] so after it has
[1:38:48] destroyed all these 400
[1:38:51] prophets iran
[1:38:56] and what i want to just look at it is uh
[1:39:00] that code and different spirits
[1:39:03] because we can see here
[1:39:07] and first king 19
[1:39:11] and he have told jezebel all that elijah
[1:39:15] had done and
[1:39:16] with all uh all he had slain all the
[1:39:19] prophets with the sword
[1:39:21] then jezebel sent a a messenger unto
[1:39:25] elijah saying so let the gods
[1:39:28] do to me and more also if i
[1:39:32] make not thy life as the life of one of
[1:39:35] them by tomorrow about this time
[1:39:40] and when he saw that he rose and went
[1:39:43] for his life and came to bathsheba
[1:39:46] which belonged to judas and left
[1:39:49] his servant there so you can
[1:39:53] see that this moment words
[1:39:56] were powerful
[1:40:00] she was but i'm saying a woman is not
[1:40:04] made of
[1:40:04] iron it's a soft part
[1:40:09] but she did not care remember
[1:40:13] elijah has established the word
[1:40:17] by rebuilding the altar of god
[1:40:20] that was broken is that right
[1:40:25] then god vindicate the restoration of
[1:40:29] the word
[1:40:29] with a fire with wonders miracles and
[1:40:34] wonders
[1:40:36] and then it destroyed those prophets
[1:40:41] i'm telling you the cold spirit
[1:40:45] jezebel heard about that
[1:40:49] she was not moved
[1:40:53] she did not care
[1:40:57] well the fire came from heaven to
[1:41:00] vindicate the message
[1:41:03] she did not care cold
[1:41:06] and different spirit
[1:41:11] it's an anointing it can be
[1:41:14] in those music comes with fashion
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:19] it comes in some ways something
[1:41:22] in the world and the model brother
[1:41:25] brandon
[1:41:26] look at the movie stars and say
[1:41:30] huh is says behind this is a woman that
[1:41:33] has been
[1:41:34] uh married and divorced married universe
[1:41:37] many times
[1:41:38] you place it in front of kids they think
[1:41:41] that's good because it's an anointing
[1:41:44] it makes them be like well as long as
[1:41:48] you just go to church it must be okay
[1:41:52] and different cold spirit
[1:42:00] she did not even look at anything that
[1:42:03] elijah did she swear by her gods that
[1:42:08] i will be dead if i don't kill that
[1:42:12] elijah
[1:42:14] no wonder elijah was oh my
[1:42:17] he ran
[1:42:20] because nothing moved her the fire that
[1:42:24] came from heaven did not move her
[1:42:26] and today sometime in our message
[1:42:29] community
[1:42:30] people try to look for miracles
[1:42:34] miracles don't change anybody
[1:42:37] the word changes
[1:42:43] miracles don't change anybody
[1:42:46] ask about the billy paul he talked about
[1:42:49] it with tears
[1:42:51] he saw kinds of miracles
[1:42:55] he saw the angel of the lord
[1:42:59] in the hotel room and he went back
[1:43:02] to the pillar of fire he saw it he was
[1:43:05] scared
[1:43:07] he didn't stop him from going to work in
[1:43:10] the world
[1:43:14] only the word changes the word transform
[1:43:18] the word makes us a new creature
[1:43:23] start with the word the miracles will
[1:43:25] follow action
[1:43:26] actually the miracles happen every day
[1:43:28] right the strange thing sometimes those
[1:43:31] miracles we cannot talk about it
[1:43:35] it has strength when barbarians say he
[1:43:37] will be private and all that
[1:43:40] now i start thinking that it may be that
[1:43:43] god does something for you but you
[1:43:45] cannot even share with people
[1:43:47] because it's involved this wonderful
[1:43:52] and then people say there is nothing
[1:43:53] happening happening
[1:44:03] her words created an atmosphere
[1:44:08] that's scary atmosphere
[1:44:15] our words create an atmosphere like i
[1:44:19] just said
[1:44:20] they were in the hotel they were
[1:44:23] worshiping the prophet
[1:44:27] worshiping the messenger
[1:44:30] instead of the message giving the heart
[1:44:34] to the message
[1:44:35] the one to worship the messenger
[1:44:38] it creates atmosphere what we say
[1:44:42] to in our homes and places have an
[1:44:45] atmosphere
[1:44:46] has spirits god
[1:44:50] help us the more we mature the more
[1:44:54] we get aware of that they we see things
[1:44:56] as god sees them
[1:44:58] it will not be legalism anymore it will
[1:45:02] be something we are aware of knowing
[1:45:04] what we know
[1:45:06] knowing i am a sons of god i am
[1:45:09] a prince from where i come from
[1:45:13] i'm conducting myself just with that
[1:45:16] awareness
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:25] and now painted faced jezebel
[1:45:28] and now jezebel had threatened him and
[1:45:31] everything else well you say brother
[1:45:34] branham
[1:45:34] wait a minute before you leave jezebel
[1:45:37] that
[1:45:38] little woman may not have had a chance
[1:45:41] she was born a pagan
[1:45:42] she didn't have a chance yes
[1:45:46] she did too she had a pastor pastor
[1:45:49] elisha
[1:45:50] and elisha wasn't afraid to tell her
[1:45:53] about it don't think god always put the
[1:45:56] light
[1:45:57] there she just refused to walk in the
[1:45:59] light
[1:46:00] that was all right
[1:46:04] yes and she didn't want to
[1:46:07] call elijah her pastor certainly not
[1:46:10] she had one as a former dignified man
[1:46:14] for a pastor but god sent elijah
[1:46:18] to be her pastor
[1:46:21] no matter how much she hated him she
[1:46:24] hated him because
[1:46:26] the really religious jews was too
[1:46:28] straight for
[1:46:30] her that's why you hear today oh you are
[1:46:38] legalistic
[1:46:42] no you don't want the truth
[1:46:46] and that's why look very closely
[1:46:49] i'm going to talk to ministers now you
[1:46:52] know
[1:46:52] look when you see somebody rejecting the
[1:46:56] you usually
[1:47:00] they're rejecting you because you are an
[1:47:02] authority figure
[1:47:04] that showed them god
[1:47:07] all right so they start by attacking you
[1:47:12] then later on they will say i'm going
[1:47:15] to this church or whatever
[1:47:18] watch them after a few years they're
[1:47:21] back in the world
[1:47:23] what they actually reject was not the
[1:47:26] head
[1:47:28] the authority figure it was actually god
[1:47:31] it was his word i'm very tough
[1:47:35] today maybe i have a mentor of an
[1:47:38] evangelist today
[1:47:39] so
[1:47:43] well god has a diversity
[1:47:46] and he knows how to do things
[1:47:52] ah well
[1:47:56] i'm going to almost stop but i want to
[1:48:02] i want wanna oh god so much
[1:48:06] oh powerpoint presentation
[1:48:11] ah let me just talk about this one
[1:48:14] the lord
[1:48:18] solomon did everything right
[1:48:22] his father did his part he has to do his
[1:48:26] part
[1:48:27] but he forget to bring himself to the
[1:48:29] lord
[1:48:31] look out ourselves straight up at
[1:48:35] our self sometimes it can be a
[1:48:38] frightening
[1:48:39] experience because we will see things
[1:48:42] that
[1:48:43] we don't want to see right
[1:48:47] but the thing is you are not going there
[1:48:50] alone
[1:48:53] you go into the house
[1:48:57] you open the house for him
[1:49:00] you open the door for him
[1:49:04] so you are not alone
[1:49:08] when you open the door to him
[1:49:12] because because you love him and you
[1:49:14] want to reflect him
[1:49:17] you are not alone otherwise it will be a
[1:49:21] frightening
[1:49:22] experience
[1:49:25] but he is there but i'm going to preach
[1:49:28] this message many times door is in door
[1:49:31] in a
[1:49:32] different form i want to end with this
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:35] on the right hand side of the human
[1:49:37] heart when you walk
[1:49:38] into the door there is a little door on
[1:49:41] this
[1:49:42] right side and that's called in there
[1:49:46] the door of pride there may be different
[1:49:49] doors for everyone
[1:49:52] there is so many things there are doors
[1:49:55] for preachers
[1:49:56] preachers have to be careful with money
[1:50:00] women and popularity
[1:50:04] and is it they are traps when you're
[1:50:08] looking for
[1:50:09] it's hard to actually repent and say
[1:50:12] what i say was not right
[1:50:17] it's hard but god wants
[1:50:21] to not just have doctrines
[1:50:25] place the philistines are out
[1:50:29] this is the message this is what we
[1:50:31] preach
[1:50:32] that's good we clean up the house
[1:50:36] that's good now we bring it home to
[1:50:38] ourself
[1:50:41] and we go with him and
[1:50:45] we have to open that door
[1:50:50] he cannot do it for us
[1:50:54] are you with me lord just open the door
[1:50:58] and get in you're strong enough
[1:51:01] no because the prophet said the holy
[1:51:05] ghost
[1:51:06] is timid and he's a gentleman
[1:51:11] when he comes in your house even if you
[1:51:13] say
[1:51:14] make yourself a home you won't put his
[1:51:17] feet on your table is a gentleman
[1:51:22] so you got to guide him to the
[1:51:26] house the most frightening house the
[1:51:29] thing that you don't
[1:51:30] want to clean up the house
[1:51:33] you cannot say open east tells you will
[1:51:38] is timid
[1:51:42] you say you open but i am with you
[1:51:45] whatever we see there we're going to
[1:51:47] clean up
[1:51:57] oh my don't you go to enter that door
[1:52:04] they don't want the lord in there on
[1:52:07] that door that pride
[1:52:09] i'm a blue blood i take care
[1:52:13] oh yes now look i'll tell you see
[1:52:16] it's pride don't you mento in there
[1:52:19] now you can't feel welcome as long as
[1:52:23] you
[1:52:23] keep that bright door shut
[1:52:28] and this is is a is a demon
[1:52:31] of this age in this time
[1:52:36] god help me help help my brothers and
[1:52:39] sisters
[1:52:42] humble thyself and god will rest

[1:53:30] depending if you think it's an effort it

[2:04:49] oh praise god i appreciate
[2:04:53] god's word i appreciate the leadership
[2:04:56] that our brother was under this morning
[2:04:57] and
[2:04:58] there's many things i've been thinking
[2:04:59] on the last few days and he was touching
[2:05:01] on them and
[2:05:02] and some things that i'm still
[2:05:03] meditating on god was just unlocking
[2:05:05] them
[2:05:06] for me and i said i love that i love
[2:05:08] god's way
[2:05:10] when it comes down to it when it's all
[2:05:12] said and done
[2:05:13] the revelation come to do one thing
[2:05:17] become the revelation come to give you a
[2:05:19] correct understanding
[2:05:21] and that correct understanding was meant
[2:05:24] to produce a life that comes from the
[2:05:26] inside out
[2:05:29] you know there's a lot of details that
[2:05:31] go with that we can talk about all the
[2:05:32] details
[2:05:33] there's a lot of doctrine and
[2:05:35] understanding and tying together loose
[2:05:37] ends and there's a big picture that was
[2:05:39] painted with all kinds of details
[2:05:41] and we can talk about all those details
[2:05:43] but the end result still has to come
[2:05:45] down to the same thing
[2:05:46] that god opened the seals to open the
[2:05:49] seals around our life so that we would
[2:05:50] know god and who we are in god
[2:05:52] and in understanding that it would bring
[2:05:55] a change from the within
[2:05:56] and we would begin to match what we saw
[2:05:58] and begin to live it
[2:06:01] if we miss the living part we miss the
[2:06:03] point
[2:06:05] we can catch the doctrine part but if it
[2:06:07] doesn't transform us from the inside out
[2:06:10] and begin to reflect the life of jesus
[2:06:12] christ then we've still
[2:06:14] missed the point i love what he was
[2:06:18] saying solomon was able to obey his
[2:06:19] father
[2:06:20] and root out the things out of the
[2:06:22] church but but there was nothing rooted
[2:06:24] out of solomon
[2:06:27] say god root me out of all self and
[2:06:31] selfishness and self desire
[2:06:33] self root it all out of me god so that i
[2:06:36] that i can reflect
[2:06:37] your heart your nature your life
[2:06:41] amen may the revelation come not to
[2:06:43] create
[2:06:44] arrogance not to create contention i
[2:06:46] mean what point would god come to open
[2:06:48] the seals to bring us
[2:06:49] tie together all the loose ends and
[2:06:51] bring the greatest revelation on the
[2:06:52] scripture that has ever been on the face
[2:06:54] of the earth
[2:06:56] and god would do that for contention and
[2:06:58] strife and arrogancy
[2:07:02] for separation and division amongst
[2:07:04] brethren no
[2:07:06] he did it to call the eagles up higher
[2:07:09] so that they wouldn't act like chickens
[2:07:11] anymore
[2:07:13] it's pretty disgraceful when eagles who
[2:07:15] were meant to fly and given a scream to
[2:07:17] call them up higher
[2:07:18] jump off the post and get back in the
[2:07:20] chicken yard again
[2:07:22] i said god root us out of there and keep
[2:07:25] us flying high
[2:07:27] and higher and higher till all the
[2:07:30] atmosphere to the world
[2:07:31] begins to fall away and keeps falling
[2:07:34] away
[2:07:35] i love the word i love when the word
[2:07:38] challenges me
[2:07:40] and i love when there's a cry inside of
[2:07:42] me and say that's what i want
[2:07:44] oh there's nothing like the preaching of
[2:07:46] the word delay a challenge right in your
[2:07:48] lap amen
[2:07:49] no matter how long you've been a
[2:07:50] believer no matter how long you've
[2:07:51] served the lord and believe this message
[2:07:53] then when the challenge is laid in our
[2:07:55] lap i mean we have a decision
[2:07:58] we can say well that's his opinion that
[2:07:59] preacher doesn't know what he's talking
[2:08:00] about or we can take the challenge and
[2:08:02] say oh god change
[2:08:03] me more and make me more like you and i
[2:08:06] love when the word brings
[2:08:08] a challenge and there's something inside
[2:08:09] that says lord i want that to challenge
[2:08:12] me
[2:08:13] and i want to be changed amen god is
[2:08:16] sure good to us
[2:08:18] well we're going to ask emma pris nick
[2:08:20] and her folks to make their way around
