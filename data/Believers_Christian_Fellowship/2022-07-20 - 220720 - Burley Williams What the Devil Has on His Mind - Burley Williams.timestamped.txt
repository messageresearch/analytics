[12:59] praise the lord it certainly is good to
[13:01] be in the house of the lord and
[13:03] we appreciate by the chad giving us the
[13:05] opportunity
[13:06] to come to share the words of life with
[13:08] you thank you musicians
[13:10] amen uh
[13:12] so uh we just like to just go ahead and
[13:14] get into the scriptures
[13:16] and uh
[13:18] see what the lord will do for us this
[13:20] evening
[13:22] i was up in uh
[13:25] toledo working this week and
[13:27] i was just thinking yesterday as i was
[13:30] working
[13:32] at one of the paul's house at his house
[13:34] and uh
[13:36] a little thought come on my mind it
[13:37] sounds a little strange but
[13:40] it just won't leave
[13:42] so
[13:44] i guess i'll preach it uh my title
[13:47] is what the devil has in his mind
[13:51] what the devil has in his mind
[13:55] i was just it just come out of nowhere
[13:56] where i ain't going to say it come out
[13:58] of nowhere
[13:59] i don't believe god just give us stuff
[14:01] out of nowhere
[14:03] but i just uh i said well i just been
[14:05] studying on it and looking at some
[14:07] things
[14:08] that's what we're just ministering by
[14:10] god's grace
[14:12] what the devil has
[14:14] in his mind
[14:15] you know many times we talk about
[14:18] what god has in his mind
[14:21] and uh
[14:22] but sometimes i guess it's gonna do us
[14:25] good to look and see what the devil got
[14:27] in his mind
[14:28] i believe we already know what the devil
[14:30] has in his mind
[14:32] i do believe that
[14:34] so i don't think we'll be ministering
[14:35] nothing new
[14:37] uh that you haven't heard already
[14:40] but we'll just see what the lord will do
[14:42] amen let's go to isaiah chapter 14.
[14:55] isaiah chapter 14.
[15:05] this is a very familiar scripture let's
[15:07] go to verse 12.
[15:12] he said how are they falling from heaven
[15:15] oh lucifer
[15:16] son of the morning
[15:18] how are thou cut down to the ground
[15:20] which did
[15:22] weaken the nations
[15:24] for thou i said in thine heart i will
[15:26] ascend into heaven
[15:27] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[15:29] of god
[15:30] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[15:33] congregation
[15:35] in the sides of the north
[15:37] i will ascend above the heights of the
[15:39] clouds i will be like the most high
[15:42] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[15:45] to the sides
[15:46] of the pit
[15:48] amen
[15:49] you may be seated
[15:55] amen
[15:57] what the devil has in his mind
[16:01] you know um
[16:02] we thank god for his grace and mercy
[16:04] allowing us to be here this evening
[16:07] and we just want to share a few things
[16:09] with you
[16:10] because we surely is in a present time
[16:13] amen
[16:14] it's a lot of negative things you could
[16:16] talk about
[16:18] but you have asked yourself
[16:20] what does good doesn't does talking
[16:22] about negative right
[16:24] it's no faith in it there's no virtue in
[16:27] it there's no help in it amen
[16:29] so we want to talk about the positive
[16:31] things because i believe sometimes
[16:34] if you talk about negative stuff too
[16:35] much it's like giving the devil glory
[16:38] giving him some victory and we don't
[16:40] want to do that i remember um
[16:43] i can't i hope i got the story right i
[16:46] can't remember what war it was
[16:49] my pastor was telling me about it one
[16:51] time how many you ever heard i think
[16:52] this lady
[16:54] i think it's called tokyo rose anybody
[16:56] ever heard of that
[16:58] tokyo rose
[17:00] from understanding when the war was
[17:02] going on i think with the japanese and
[17:04] so forth
[17:06] tokyo tokyo rose was a woman on a radio
[17:10] announcer
[17:11] and on the radio broadcast
[17:14] whenever something goes bad a american
[17:17] die or something like that they just
[17:19] broadcast it on the radio another
[17:20] american down this what doesn't happen
[17:23] this way it don't happen
[17:24] but that was a design to keep for her to
[17:27] keep talking
[17:28] making statements like that so people
[17:30] could hear it to discourage them
[17:35] amen
[17:36] it just kind of reminded me just
[17:38] recently when uh this war was going on
[17:41] while still going on with ukraine
[17:44] you hear all kind of the stuff on the
[17:46] news and and and this and russia is
[17:49] doing this and it's a while it looks
[17:51] pretty bad for ukraine
[17:53] and then i got friends in ukraine
[17:55] and uh you know when you hear what the
[17:57] news saying you say you shake your head
[17:59] before you crane just just and that the
[18:01] other
[18:02] but i called one of my friends he said
[18:03] brother don't listen to that nonsense on
[18:05] y'all uh
[18:07] broadcast he said we're fighting
[18:10] amen he said
[18:12] we we're doing what we got to do i said
[18:14] well praise the lord so sometimes when
[18:17] you can hear certain things you really
[18:18] need to dig in and see what is truth and
[18:20] what is not truth because the things
[18:23] that you listen to it actually
[18:24] influences you
[18:26] can we say man so but we want to hear
[18:29] about positive things it also reminds me
[18:32] i remember uh i went to a museum one
[18:35] time and
[18:36] they had a display in the museum
[18:38] and it's called uh psyops
[18:41] and uh and it was kind of interesting to
[18:43] me and i began to read some of the uh
[18:47] the statements that they had upon there
[18:49] and it was kind of
[18:51] amazing
[18:52] and this is uh it's been many many years
[18:54] ago so i probably can't remember all of
[18:56] it but
[18:57] they had a plane that america has
[19:01] it is designed for psyops which psyops
[19:04] mean psychological it means
[19:06] psychological warfare
[19:08] and in this plane i was reading the
[19:10] listings
[19:11] they had everything in there that they
[19:13] could tap into
[19:15] wherever they whoever they're fighting
[19:17] they could tap into their radio
[19:19] communications and they can they're
[19:21] radio waves and it's just a plane just
[19:23] totally designed for psyops
[19:26] i said that's interesting and then uh so
[19:30] when they can break in somebody else's
[19:32] radio thing and start talking to the
[19:34] people and try to tell them you need to
[19:36] surrender you need to do this and we're
[19:38] going to kill you and then it can mess
[19:40] with people's mind
[19:42] and then they had a display on there
[19:45] where
[19:45] uh this plane would drop leaflets
[19:49] and uh when the soldiers that they was
[19:51] fighting against
[19:52] this plane would drop leaflets down
[19:54] there and tell them
[19:56] we're going to drop this bomb on you
[19:58] and the soldiers that's walking would
[20:00] pick it up and they would read it
[20:02] and then
[20:03] they keep on walking
[20:06] then they'll drop another flyer
[20:08] then after we drop this bomb we're going
[20:10] to drop this one
[20:12] and then they would pick it up and they
[20:13] would read it
[20:14] and then they would literally drop
[20:16] another flyer and said don't try to dig
[20:18] into the ground
[20:19] because the bomb that's going to come
[20:21] out of that is called the bunker buster
[20:23] and they begin to describe how far it
[20:25] could go down in the ground so if you go
[20:27] down in the ground we're going to drop
[20:29] this one on you and then all of a sudden
[20:31] they just start dropping their weapons
[20:32] and they start raising their hand
[20:35] just from leaflets
[20:38] they didn't even have to shoot a weapon
[20:40] they were defeated in their mind
[20:42] so it was over with
[20:44] that's why god sent us a message today
[20:46] to explain to us the greatest battles
[20:48] that is fought is in the mind
[20:51] because once you lose in the mind
[20:52] everything else falls right into place
[20:55] can we say man you see that was the
[20:58] tactic that the philistines
[21:00] used on the children of israel
[21:02] in the saul
[21:04] and
[21:05] saul was afraid
[21:07] soldiers was afraid but if you really
[21:09] look at that story
[21:11] uh god had all of that laid out
[21:14] perfectly
[21:15] because you remember when they wanted
[21:16] the king they wanted somebody to fight
[21:19] for them
[21:20] standing for them so god let a war come
[21:23] to let them show this is the man you
[21:25] choose to fight for you but he's just as
[21:27] scared as you
[21:28] are so god allowed that to happen so he
[21:32] could bring david on the scene
[21:34] can we say praise the lord but you
[21:36] remember goliath he defeated them
[21:38] not throwing the spirit
[21:41] amen not shooting the arrow
[21:43] nothing he defeated them with words
[21:47] he would say amen
[21:48] they lost the battle in their mind and
[21:50] they was totally defeated but when david
[21:53] came
[21:54] the words that goliath was speaking
[21:56] couldn't penetrate david's mind
[21:58] because david had an experience he just
[22:01] pushed it all out
[22:02] so when david looked at goliath he
[22:04] already seen goliath defeated
[22:07] so that's what we ought to do amen by
[22:09] god's grace because he said that we are
[22:11] more than conquerors
[22:12] our enemy been defeated a long time ago
[22:15] at calvary he done it all but we have to
[22:18] believe that
[22:20] can we say praise the lord but you know
[22:22] satan
[22:23] he is a bluffer
[22:26] and he's very good at
[22:28] extremely good at it so we have to
[22:30] understand what satan tactic is so now
[22:34] i'm going to talk about some things
[22:36] and uh just uh but then we'll flip it
[22:39] back around because sometimes i know you
[22:41] can preach
[22:42] sometimes about something on one side
[22:44] too much and you'll be like hmm come on
[22:47] bring it back branch it out so i believe
[22:49] in the balance amen
[22:51] and i remember years ago i used to hear
[22:53] people talk on prophecy
[22:55] brothers preach on prophecy about what's
[22:57] going to happen to america and all these
[22:59] things and they told me everything that
[23:01] was going to happen to the america and
[23:03] you can leave a service depressed
[23:08] you're telling me everything that's
[23:09] gonna happen
[23:10] but then but you gotta you gotta
[23:11] remember you gotta bring it in but the
[23:13] prophet said before one bomb could fall
[23:16] he's gonna take his bride away so that
[23:18] balances it out yeah she got it coming
[23:20] but let me know what's going to happen
[23:21] to me i'm going to get i'm coming up out
[23:23] of here amen so i don't want to be
[23:25] depressed
[23:26] say man that's the same as correcting
[23:28] your children
[23:30] you correct them not to depress them
[23:33] is that right when you correct them then
[23:35] you got to give them a ray of hope yeah
[23:37] you did wrong
[23:39] all right you got to acknowledge you did
[23:41] wrong you shouldn't have done this
[23:43] but then
[23:44] you know after you well sometimes you
[23:46] got to spank them
[23:48] after you do your business then
[23:50] encourage them
[23:52] just tell them you're better than that
[23:53] you know i expect more to you than that
[23:56] i'll listen to it brother i can't
[23:57] remember who you just told me recently
[23:59] he said man sometimes when his parents
[24:01] used to tell him
[24:02] i'm disappointed in you he said that was
[24:04] worse than the weapon
[24:07] say i'm disappointed in you those things
[24:09] cut and they hurt but yet leave
[24:11] encouragement so i believe god had left
[24:15] us with a message of encouragement this
[24:17] message come to encourage us not to
[24:19] depress us
[24:20] so when people around the message i'm
[24:22] not trying to be funny when they're
[24:24] living in a realm of depression
[24:25] something is wrong
[24:28] they need to check their revelation amen
[24:30] they need to check and see what they
[24:31] believe because god did not call us they
[24:33] haven't given us a spirit of fear
[24:36] can we say amen but power and love and
[24:38] the sound mind that's what god gives you
[24:40] so anything opposite of that is what the
[24:42] devil gives
[24:44] can we say praise the lord now
[24:46] what's interesting about this scripture
[24:48] here we're talking about what the devil
[24:50] has in his mind which we know uh we know
[24:54] the words of thoughts expressed before
[24:56] it become word is actually a thought but
[24:58] then when you speak it if it and it come
[25:00] word then it manifests whatever your
[25:03] thoughts was we understand that how the
[25:05] prophet went over this million times god
[25:07] said let there be light and there was
[25:09] light and it come to pass but you
[25:10] remember before earth and all this come
[25:13] to existence it was all in god's mind
[25:15] but now it's just being played out and
[25:17] it being manifested amen so satan had
[25:21] thoughts also in his mind
[25:23] what he wants to do amen satan thought
[25:26] did not start here on earth
[25:29] satan thought started when he was in
[25:31] heaven
[25:32] is that right and that's what we
[25:34] actually just read satan telling what
[25:37] i'm going to do but what's so
[25:39] interesting when when you look at the
[25:42] scripture and you go to the message
[25:43] satan's eden the prophet said god eaten
[25:46] was established in righteousness
[25:49] satan eden is established in sin because
[25:53] satan is sin god is righteous and god's
[25:58] kingdom was established in righteousness
[26:01] and peace and life and satan
[26:04] establishment is in sin and religious
[26:07] sin i like how he just added it in in
[26:10] sin religious sin he said now notice how
[26:14] he deceived
[26:16] his deception as he said he would then
[26:20] he said he promised
[26:23] to do this
[26:26] then he refers to isaiah
[26:28] so what satan was saying in isaiah i'm
[26:30] going to be like the mohawk satan was
[26:32] making a promise
[26:34] otherwise i promise you
[26:36] this is what i'm gonna do
[26:38] god got promises and the devil got
[26:40] promises but the only difference is god
[26:43] promises this to bless you
[26:45] satan promises to bless himself
[26:48] that's the only difference can we say
[26:50] amen even when you look in the scripture
[26:53] satan say i will be like the most high i
[26:56] will ascend it to heaven i will exalt my
[26:58] throne i will sit upon the mount all of
[27:01] those are satan's eyes
[27:03] but then when you go to the book of
[27:05] ezekiel god got eyes
[27:08] god said i will take away your stony
[27:10] heart i will give you a new spirit
[27:13] god said i will do this i will call you
[27:15] from the nation but the only difference
[27:17] satan eyes is for himself
[27:20] but god eyes is for you
[27:23] god said i'm gonna do this for you i'm
[27:25] gonna take care of you i'm gonna change
[27:27] you but satan said all of my eyes is for
[27:29] me
[27:32] so that's the difference
[27:33] then he says here he said now he said
[27:38] now
[27:39] now what i'm looking at here
[27:41] i listen to ask the prophet ministers
[27:43] and speak he's actually telling us
[27:47] what's in satan's mind
[27:49] he's telling us amen now now how many of
[27:52] you have got facebook
[27:56] oh come on i ain't gonna preach against
[27:57] you you got facebook
[27:59] raise your hand
[28:02] on your facebook when you hit the home
[28:05] button
[28:06] what comes up
[28:11] what's on your mind
[28:14] right
[28:17] yeah just well i promise you after
[28:19] service over you're gonna go
[28:22] before you post something on facebook
[28:24] that's what the title is on the top
[28:26] what's on your mind
[28:28] then you start posting stuff
[28:31] and everything you're posting is what's
[28:32] on your mind
[28:34] right
[28:35] praise the lord so when people put
[28:37] things on facebook they're just telling
[28:40] what's on their mind
[28:42] whether it's good or bad they're telling
[28:44] what's on their
[28:46] mind
[28:47] and it's so sad how bad facebook don't
[28:50] actually got people like to post their
[28:52] problems
[28:54] on facebook
[28:56] i'm going through this y'all pray for me
[28:58] and this and i'm going i'm going through
[29:00] this and then all of a sudden they might
[29:02] go to a meeting one day
[29:04] they don't kind of in a in a good mood
[29:06] then they go to a meeting somebody just
[29:08] walk up to him
[29:09] i'm praying for you
[29:11] they said
[29:12] ain't nothing wrong with me no that post
[29:13] that you put on them
[29:15] i'm praying for you are you okay then
[29:17] you get offended i'm a strong christian
[29:19] not me don't mean no you put it there
[29:23] they're just responding back what was on
[29:24] your mind what you posted
[29:26] that's the only thing they do people put
[29:28] so much of their information on facebook
[29:30] too it's really sad to people know you
[29:33] that don't actually know you
[29:38] praise the lord i guess i better leave
[29:40] facebook along cause there's some
[29:41] people's church
[29:45] and they get offended when you talk
[29:46] about it but let me tell you something
[29:48] friends different things could be used
[29:50] right those things could be used wrong
[29:52] it's just the bottom line of the whole
[29:54] matter but anyway back too much the
[29:56] scripture here now i want you to notice
[29:58] is this also the prophet says in satan's
[30:01] eden
[30:01] he said now he said he would exalt
[30:04] himself
[30:05] above the most high he would ascend
[30:08] above the clouds and the stars
[30:11] and he would sit there like god and be
[30:15] above the most high then he says
[30:18] and he has succeeded
[30:21] in carrying out his threats
[30:23] so what satan had in his heart and his
[30:25] mind when he was in heaven what he
[30:27] promised because the prophet said there
[30:29] he promised what he was going to do but
[30:31] now he has succeeded
[30:34] he said he has certainly had a marvelous
[30:37] success
[30:39] in carrying out his threats
[30:42] but now he's gonna explain how he did it
[30:45] he said by the people
[30:47] letting him explain away
[30:50] in every age the value of god's promised
[30:54] word to that age so for satan to fulfill
[30:58] his promise he has to attack god's
[31:01] promise
[31:03] and that's what he done notice what he
[31:04] said the value he said he had explained
[31:08] the way in every age the value of god
[31:11] promised were to that age so whatever
[31:14] god promises in the age that's what
[31:16] satan is going to attack to get the
[31:18] people to disbelieve what god has
[31:20] promised in that age
[31:22] can we say man satan they gonna attack
[31:24] you today and tell you and argue with
[31:27] you about noah built the heart
[31:30] what are you want to do that for
[31:32] can we say amen
[31:34] then he ain't interesting that because
[31:35] that doesn't pass
[31:37] so he ain't worrying about that but when
[31:39] satan is going to attack now he's going
[31:40] to try to show you that god is building
[31:42] the bride
[31:44] can we say man how many do you believe
[31:46] god is building the bride
[31:47] god has a bride god is creating his own
[31:50] bride how do god create his own bride by
[31:53] the word
[31:54] that's why when you go to the book of
[31:55] ephesians he said he gonna have a church
[31:57] without spider-rancher he questioned her
[32:00] by the washing of the water of the word
[32:02] but what is the purpose to present her
[32:04] to himself
[32:05] so the bride that god wants he's created
[32:08] her for himself to present her to
[32:10] himself
[32:12] can we say amen but satan want to
[32:14] explain away every promise that god has
[32:16] done in an age he want to try to explain
[32:19] it away from the people that's why he
[32:20] get people to say ain't no such thing
[32:22] god's going to send a gentile prophet
[32:24] that's not really true that god didn't
[32:26] really promise that but god did promise
[32:28] this it depends on where you're looking
[32:30] at so satan won't explain all present
[32:33] day promises that god has given us today
[32:35] he want to explain it away from the
[32:37] people like he said he won't explain the
[32:40] value of it can we say amen see people
[32:43] don't understand the value
[32:45] of the word of god the value why god
[32:48] sent a prophet it's a value in that
[32:52] command kim is that right it's wealth in
[32:54] there it's a pro it's a purpose for that
[32:57] so when we catch those revelations even
[32:59] like uh uh you know me myself you got
[33:02] all kind of different site attacks on
[33:04] the message and all these sort of things
[33:07] it don't bother me
[33:10] people get offended when people say
[33:11] things against the mess and stuff it
[33:13] don't bother me what people say
[33:16] because they can't take it from me
[33:18] there's not a devil out of hell can take
[33:20] this message from burly williams
[33:22] you can't explain it out of me because
[33:24] didn't nobody explain it in me
[33:26] can we say man i've been born again i
[33:29] don't care what i can't explain
[33:31] it don't matter to me i know what i
[33:33] believe
[33:34] so the devil can't shake me from none of
[33:36] those things and people say i just don't
[33:38] believe the message i say well you're an
[33:39] unbeliever
[33:41] then they get mad how can you tell me
[33:43] i'm a believer i said well god promised
[33:45] you to send a message in this day god
[33:47] promised that the bible you said you
[33:48] read and god promised it so if you don't
[33:50] believe that that makes you an
[33:52] unbeliever
[33:54] ain't gonna argue with them there ain't
[33:56] no need because if we're in a time
[33:58] rather of maturing
[34:01] this is maturing time but you got to
[34:04] remember we have to go through things in
[34:06] life to help us to mature
[34:08] now let me just keep reading this he
[34:10] said he succeeded he has success in
[34:13] carrying out his threats
[34:14] he has certainly had a marvelous success
[34:18] in carrying out his threat now let me go
[34:20] on down it says also in god power
[34:23] transformation he said satan's purpose
[34:26] from eden was to make his own self an
[34:30] eden
[34:31] exalt himself above the stars of god
[34:34] god would worship him sons would worship
[34:37] him he said and he has absolutely
[34:40] carried it out now and when he's done
[34:43] this brought it into the church he's
[34:46] which i won't go in details he's any of
[34:48] you listen to these tapes know about it
[34:50] that's exactly the hour we're living in
[34:53] and you remember in god in this evil age
[34:56] he said there's never been another age
[34:58] into this age where satan is called the
[35:00] god of this evil age
[35:04] reason why he's called to god because
[35:05] all the way from genesis he done
[35:07] succeeded to this age that he has
[35:09] actually become god of this evil age so
[35:13] he has fulfilled what was in his mind
[35:16] way back up there in the heavens he has
[35:18] successfully fulfilled it today but we
[35:21] see how the prophet going into details
[35:23] how he did it
[35:25] can we say man he said satan has done it
[35:28] through
[35:29] educational programs now normal
[35:32] preaching ain't nobody gonna say oh come
[35:34] on that's nonsense educational program
[35:37] yeah that's exactly what he has done
[35:39] through school through education amen
[35:41] through seminaries through preachers
[35:44] satan has actually have been able to do
[35:46] these things so the prophet is just
[35:48] really just breaking down what was in
[35:50] satan's mind and how he done these
[35:53] things
[35:54] then he says
[35:56] he said a better fit a better this a
[35:59] better day he said not knowing all the
[36:02] time they are walking straight unto
[36:04] death
[36:05] blinded leading the blind blind leaders
[36:08] of the nations blind leaders of science
[36:10] blind leaders of the church blind
[36:13] leading the blind jesus said let them
[36:15] alone they'll both fall in the ditch he
[36:18] began to break down everything how satan
[36:21] see you and i we just know and isaiah he
[36:24] said how i'm going to exalt myself above
[36:26] god how i'm going to do all these things
[36:28] but god's son is submerging this in time
[36:31] to break it down how he's able to
[36:33] succeed to get his desire fulfilled
[36:36] now you and i we never how many you
[36:39] don't find many places preaching against
[36:41] education like the bride does
[36:44] can we say man but we know there's a
[36:46] balance education is all right as long
[36:50] as it don't get in the way of god
[36:52] because you got some smart people and
[36:54] they don't let their intellect get in
[36:56] their way with god paul was a smart man
[36:59] extremely smart man then the disciples
[37:02] weren't smart man so god could use both
[37:05] smart people
[37:06] and not so smart people
[37:09] as long as they got the holy ghost amen
[37:11] he's their teacher to teach them and
[37:14] guide them what to say what to do so
[37:16] these things are okay now
[37:18] you know satan
[37:20] satan don't brag so much
[37:23] how he had succeeded because
[37:26] one one deceit that the world normal
[37:29] nominal don't look at that the biggest
[37:32] deceit actually today it is through
[37:35] religion
[37:37] see many talk about uh sin on the
[37:39] streets and seeing out hearing
[37:41] prostitution and all this stuff but they
[37:43] don't understand what religious sin is
[37:46] satan is hid behind that so deep that's
[37:49] what people don't catch i was talking to
[37:51] her in the well i was talking to my my
[37:54] niece and i made a statement to her i
[37:56] said you're looking for the devil in the
[37:57] wrong place i said you're always looking
[37:59] out on the streets and stuff you don't
[38:00] know he stands behind pulpits
[38:09] but let me read some something just
[38:11] dropped in my heart but i want to read
[38:12] this first
[38:15] you
[38:16] know satan done black so much he's so
[38:20] thankful of his eating
[38:23] in the world when they have their little
[38:25] gathering and somebody don't make some
[38:27] kind of achievement
[38:29] uh some accomplishment
[38:31] you know they give a toast
[38:34] you know what i'm talking about they say
[38:36] we would like to give a toast to our
[38:38] brother here accomplishment
[38:40] tip
[38:41] hit the glasses together
[38:44] what a great accomplishment
[38:46] when satan brought forth his great
[38:48] accomplishment he said i got to give a
[38:50] toast
[38:52] and he did
[38:53] the prophet says right here christ and
[38:55] mr god revealed
[38:57] he said the bible in revelation said
[38:59] this great city ring over all the kings
[39:01] of the earth
[39:03] said she was a
[39:05] what is that
[39:06] he said a woman that claims to be a lady
[39:08] and commits fornication
[39:10] she had a cup in her hand
[39:13] of toast
[39:16] to the world
[39:18] so that cuff in her hand
[39:20] come and drink of this cup of my great
[39:22] achievement that i have accomplished to
[39:25] deceive you
[39:30] a toast
[39:31] to the world when i read that i said
[39:32] that ain't nothing but the truth
[39:34] filled with the filthiness of the
[39:36] abominations of a fornication and she
[39:38] had daughters the protestant churches to
[39:41] everyone come out of her with her
[39:44] same false doctrines baptism he just
[39:47] began to break all these things down all
[39:49] of these things that was in satan's mind
[39:52] he's actually displaying it through
[39:54] false ministries through false religion
[39:56] all of it is coming out now
[39:59] and we see that right now let me just
[40:01] backtrack a minute because i'm not
[40:03] finished but i want to explain something
[40:04] that just fell in my heart
[40:09] and it's going to be to young people
[40:13] i had something to just recently happen
[40:17] and uh
[40:18] it's just very disturbing
[40:22] when you many take it lightly
[40:27] when the prophet talk about comic books
[40:31] many people take that very very
[40:34] lightly
[40:37] he said comic books
[40:39] is setting children's mind up for a
[40:41] blast
[40:43] that's what he said
[40:46] but you know
[40:47] everybody don't read comic books
[40:52] so the devil what the devil has done in
[40:54] this day
[40:55] they have taken the see now i come from
[40:58] them times i was a cartoonist
[41:01] i lived and breathed comic books
[41:05] i actually used to could draw out of the
[41:06] comic books better than the man that
[41:08] drawed it himself
[41:10] but being an artist
[41:12] this is what i know
[41:14] when you draw something you come under
[41:17] inspiration
[41:19] are you drawing it
[41:21] so i had to
[41:22] get real inspired to draw these gruesome
[41:25] looking pictures and stuff but i called
[41:28] it art and it was beautiful but i had
[41:30] after entering into a room of
[41:32] inspiration to be able to draw that so
[41:34] it's spirits behind it
[41:37] now everybody don't read comic books
[41:41] so what the devil has done
[41:43] i guess in the last couple of years he
[41:46] took what was in comic books and made
[41:48] him live people yeah
[41:52] spider-man movies superman adventures
[41:57] see satan ain't no fool
[41:59] he knows you know people ain't going to
[42:01] read comic books because it ain't no
[42:03] interest in many people
[42:04] but then he thought putting billboards
[42:06] up coming soon thor coming to let it get
[42:09] some people mine
[42:12] can we say amen now to some people it
[42:14] don't affect to some people that do
[42:17] but i'm here to tell you the spirits
[42:19] behind those things are actually
[42:22] real
[42:23] they
[42:24] are real
[42:26] now
[42:27] i know myself i preach a lot about what
[42:29] you watch what you see what you hear
[42:31] affects you i preach on things like that
[42:33] a lot and i know sometimes people get
[42:35] tired of me saying it but i'm not going
[42:36] to get tired of saying it because i know
[42:39] the importance of it amen because people
[42:42] just don't really understand how spirits
[42:43] work sometimes
[42:46] let me explain something friends
[42:50] it's very
[42:51] crucial
[42:52] to know
[42:54] without a shadow of a doubt
[42:57] born again
[43:01] you're full
[43:02] of the holy ghost
[43:05] because i'm going to show you
[43:07] a big deceit
[43:09] that the devil has done and i'm gonna
[43:11] read to you what the prophet said and
[43:13] he's expressing what's in his mind
[43:16] satan is
[43:17] so all of this music
[43:19] and all this garbage they got out here
[43:22] on the internet what you think
[43:23] commercials are for
[43:26] they just pop up out of nowhere
[43:28] and all of them got music behind them
[43:31] what you think that is for
[43:33] to get in your subconscious
[43:37] do you ever think it just is so amazing
[43:39] you can walk into a restaurant
[43:41] and they play the music you used to
[43:43] listen to
[43:46] satan ain't no fool he know exactly what
[43:49] he's doing
[43:51] i have been with brothers before just
[43:53] recently we went to a restaurant the
[43:55] music was playing he started going
[43:58] and then he caught himself
[44:02] yeah oh yeah
[44:06] you remember this science says
[44:09] music is the only thing can enter your
[44:11] subconscious without your permission
[44:14] science says that
[44:16] but look at the deceit satan is
[44:18] expressing everything
[44:20] wanting people to worship him i want to
[44:22] be like the most high he's doing it
[44:25] today
[44:26] let me read this to you
[44:29] i know i changed the service a little
[44:30] bit but that's okay because this just
[44:31] dropped in my heart
[44:33] tell your young people
[44:35] don't play with the wrong stuff
[44:38] if it's questionable leave it alone
[44:41] as soon as the question come up you say
[44:42] i just leave it wrong because who's
[44:44] throwing that question to you that's god
[44:46] wanting you right there just leave it
[44:47] alone
[44:48] walk away don't experiment don't explore
[44:51] just leave it alone
[44:57] this isn't questions and answers
[45:01] they asked a question about
[45:03] uh uh
[45:04] where did the spirits go that was in
[45:06] that man that the maniac or got her in
[45:11] now he said in that man
[45:13] well you know he's talking about
[45:16] how the man hung around tunes making
[45:17] script his clothes off he said them
[45:19] spirits are still here
[45:22] he said now and that man was some of
[45:24] these spirits
[45:26] that was cast out in the swine that got
[45:28] here now he's talking about the man
[45:31] that was uh gonna kill him he referring
[45:33] to him first and he now he's identifying
[45:36] some of them spirits was in that man
[45:38] because you remember he told but the man
[45:39] said he could have kept me just as real
[45:41] easy as he wanted to he's strong he
[45:43] could have killed me
[45:44] but the thing that i love about this so
[45:46] much when he came up to the prophet even
[45:48] god told him not to move then he said he
[45:50] said since you challenged uh challenged
[45:53] god you the one gonna bow down but you
[45:55] as a preacher before that he beat him up
[46:00] can we say man
[46:01] but you remember
[46:03] before
[46:04] this man in the bible before they got to
[46:07] it many tried to bind him many tried to
[46:09] change it but when he met jesus that's
[46:11] when he
[46:13] so now when that spirit that man came to
[46:16] vote around he knew there's a
[46:17] representative of jesus christ who's on
[46:19] the earth can we say amen so it's the
[46:22] same parallel
[46:24] but he says here
[46:27] is some of those poor people out here in
[46:29] these insane institutions
[46:31] beating their heads against paddle bar
[46:33] sales
[46:34] remember
[46:35] devils never die
[46:38] devils always live
[46:41] but there will be a time where devils
[46:43] will have to die
[46:45] they will become totally annihilated but
[46:48] now they are alive
[46:51] he said and they work
[46:54] from generation
[46:56] to generation
[46:57] upon human beings
[47:01] some of them in the form of cancer
[47:03] some is in the form of epilepsy
[47:06] some is in the form of tuberculosis they
[47:08] get into the flesh
[47:10] but seemingly they are powerfulness
[47:13] until they can get into a person
[47:15] they have to operate through a person
[47:17] which brings to another thought he said
[47:20] that the holy spirit covers the earth
[47:23] but it is almost helpless until it gets
[47:26] into you and to me
[47:30] and listen to what he said
[47:31] god
[47:32] is depending on you
[47:35] and i
[47:36] depending on what
[47:38] tabernacles
[47:40] he can get in
[47:42] so he can also display himself
[47:47] depending on us
[47:50] did he say says here
[47:56] the earth he said
[47:58] it cannot operate
[48:00] until it comes into us
[48:03] we human beings to operate now here's
[48:05] what i want to get to
[48:07] he said the devil
[48:08] wants to take us over
[48:11] to operate under him
[48:14] so when he
[48:16] gets the mild
[48:18] form
[48:19] he starts in sin
[48:21] he's going to talk about how satan
[48:23] maneuvers
[48:24] to try to do something small in
[48:27] somebody's life
[48:28] and keep them there
[48:30] he says this
[48:31] if he can hold them just in a righteous
[48:35] man he ain't talking about a righteous
[48:36] man
[48:38] if the devil could just put something in
[48:39] their life they could even be a
[48:41] righteous man
[48:43] he said a good man
[48:47] and just let him go ahead
[48:49] try to be a
[48:50] try to be good like that
[48:53] if he could hold him like that
[48:56] until he's dead
[48:58] that's just
[48:59] just what he wants to do
[49:02] he got it
[49:05] because no matter how righteous you are
[49:08] how good you are how moral you are how
[49:12] clean you are how honest you are
[49:18] you'll never get to heaven until you're
[49:20] born again
[49:22] [Music]
[49:25] so the devil can have somebody living
[49:27] righteous
[49:28] clean
[49:29] pure
[49:30] but it could be a sin that stuck there
[49:32] in their life where they couldn't go no
[49:34] further than that they get the baptism
[49:35] of the holy ghost and satan said i can
[49:37] just keep them there
[49:39] until they die
[49:40] they still come to me
[49:44] that's why i make the statement make
[49:46] sure
[49:48] you know
[49:49] you're born again
[49:51] because when god is sealed in the devil
[49:53] is sealed out but temptations still come
[49:57] but you got something inside of you to
[49:59] help you fight those temptations
[50:02] amen
[50:03] people want to say you don't know what
[50:05] i'm going through it's hard
[50:07] you can be born again full of the holy
[50:09] spirit still you go through things
[50:12] still you got trials still you got bowel
[50:14] but you've got something inside of you
[50:17] to take you through them
[50:19] can you say amen go back to the parable
[50:22] when they talk about two houses
[50:24] the rain descended the floods came
[50:27] can you say man and beat upon the house
[50:30] did it then that was built on sand then
[50:32] they talked about the other one built on
[50:34] a rock but they got the same problems
[50:36] rain descended floods came beat on both
[50:39] houses
[50:40] but the only difference one fell one did
[50:44] so christians we go through same
[50:47] problems
[50:48] in similar fashions that the world go
[50:50] through
[50:51] but it's just the only difference we
[50:53] stand
[50:54] they keep falling
[50:56] i don't say they fall they keep falling
[50:58] because we're already falling
[51:01] these things
[51:03] are important
[51:06] praise the lord the devil can just keep
[51:08] you there
[51:12] hold him like that
[51:14] until he's dead
[51:16] that's why so many people are so
[51:17] religious now the devil made them so
[51:20] religious
[51:21] he know they ain't got no holy ghost but
[51:23] he keeps them so religious and they'll
[51:24] say well i don't do this and i don't do
[51:26] that i don't do this i'm okay
[51:28] none of us don't care until you feel
[51:30] with the holy ghost
[51:31] then you're okay
[51:34] until then we're just religious
[51:38] i know that sounds a little blunt but
[51:39] it's time to be blunt
[51:42] because many get discouraged because
[51:44] they see people falling why are they
[51:45] falling
[51:46] because the house wasn't built right
[51:50] when god builds a house
[51:52] it won't fall
[51:54] it might need remodeling
[51:56] and some repairs on it
[51:58] but it won't fall
[52:00] can we say praise the lord
[52:04] amen
[52:06] got them dropped in my heart and share
[52:07] that with your friends
[52:11] satan
[52:13] is up to
[52:14] no good
[52:17] when i say no good
[52:20] no good
[52:21] how many you know what no good is
[52:24] it's no good
[52:26] his whole thinking his whole makeup his
[52:29] whole desire is no
[52:31] good
[52:32] and people are underestimated
[52:36] in john 10
[52:38] even though it talks about a thief but
[52:40] we know it refers to satan also
[52:43] it says
[52:44] jesus said i am the door by me if any
[52:46] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[52:48] go in and out and find pastor
[52:51] he said but the thief
[52:53] cometh not
[52:55] i just like the way jesus worded it
[52:57] in other words he's telling you the
[52:58] thief cometh not in other words he got
[53:01] nothing that's on his mind but this
[53:04] to steal
[53:05] to kill
[53:07] and destroy in other words he got no
[53:09] other motive and ejected but kill steal
[53:12] and destroy now you say how could you
[53:14] apply that to satan being the thief you
[53:16] know what the the what it says he come
[53:18] to do kill steal destroy all you got to
[53:21] do is compare that to peter when he said
[53:23] the devil going around like a
[53:26] rowing line seeking who he may devour
[53:29] that word devour means destroy
[53:31] so he's still talking about the same
[53:33] person that's the only thing the devil
[53:35] got in his mind kill steal destroy
[53:39] want to steal your joy
[53:40] destroy your life
[53:42] and kill you
[53:46] now i'ma say something friends
[53:51] when it comes to this message
[53:57] when a person been in this don't come in
[54:00] contact with the word of life the
[54:01] trueness of this message
[54:05] and the devil knows that
[54:08] the devil loves it
[54:11] when he can get somebody
[54:13] to fall
[54:15] in this message
[54:18] he loves it more for somebody to fall in
[54:20] the message than out there in the number
[54:22] of the churches
[54:25] he loves it more
[54:27] he said why you say that brother bernie
[54:29] i said it to say this
[54:32] the devil
[54:34] will get more glory
[54:36] for himself
[54:37] in a backslider
[54:40] than just killing somebody
[54:45] oh i know you're thinking
[54:49] out of all of the problems
[54:51] sampson caused those philistines
[54:54] why didn't they just immediately kill
[54:56] him
[54:58] so we got him now to just kill him
[55:01] no
[55:02] they want to kill him
[55:04] they want to make sport
[55:07] mockery
[55:09] to be able to display him
[55:12] where's your power now
[55:14] oh look at you weak you're nothing now
[55:17] that was more glory for the devil than
[55:19] having samson in that situation
[55:22] the same thing today if you can have
[55:24] somebody backslidden
[55:26] and the devil can get people to point
[55:28] and they went to church all those years
[55:30] look at him now
[55:32] i guess god ain't real i guess this
[55:34] message ain't real i guess the holy
[55:36] ghost can't keep you i might always go
[55:38] ahead and live any kind of way too they
[55:40] fail they feel satan like yes yes
[55:47] those are facts
[55:50] that's why
[55:51] i preach on now more than ever you must
[55:54] be born again
[55:56] which you don't become teachings people
[55:57] don't really want to hear no more
[56:01] come on give me some seals brother
[56:04] break some seals down to him all of that
[56:06] comes with it
[56:08] but where's your foundation
[56:11] when you can have all of this knowledge
[56:13] i know many don't have a clear
[56:15] revelation
[56:16] on the deep mysteries of god
[56:19] and then fall
[56:22] i've seen it friends
[56:24] that's why i got to be here first
[56:27] must be born again
[56:32] the devil
[56:34] what's in his mind
[56:36] jesus said
[56:37] when he speaks in luke 8 about the seeds
[56:40] he said those by the wayside are they
[56:42] that hear
[56:44] he said then cometh the devil
[56:47] it taketh away the word out of their
[56:50] hearts i like the way he put it they
[56:53] hear the word he said but then come the
[56:55] devil and take the word out of their
[56:57] hearts
[56:59] because the devil knows if he can get
[57:00] the word out of a person's heart he got
[57:03] him
[57:04] you could have the word in your heart
[57:06] not be born again but on your way
[57:09] can we say man and because you're
[57:11] keeping the word before you're loving
[57:13] the word you're on your way there to get
[57:14] the holy ghost but if the devil started
[57:17] getting you to doubt the word and snatch
[57:18] that out of your heart i got you
[57:24] can we say praise the lord
[57:27] and peter 5 8 be sober be villager
[57:29] because your adversary the devil
[57:32] as a roaring lion walketh about
[57:34] seeking
[57:36] whom he may devour to me that's some
[57:38] strong reading it tells you what's in
[57:41] his mind his very purpose he ain't
[57:43] looking for nobody to love
[57:46] satan ain't looking for nobody to love
[57:48] he looking for somebody to devour
[57:52] that's what's in his mind can we say
[57:54] amen then when it comes to job god went
[57:57] right to the point when satan came it
[57:59] says now there was a day when the sons
[58:01] of god came to present themselves before
[58:03] the lord satan came also among them
[58:08] it's and the lord said and to say
[58:11] once cometh down
[58:13] god already know where he come from god
[58:14] already knew what his purpose was i'm
[58:17] glad god acts and so satan can reply so
[58:19] you and i know what's in satan's mind
[58:24] then satan answered the lord he said
[58:26] from going to
[58:28] and fro
[58:29] in the earth
[58:30] walking from walking up
[58:32] and down in it
[58:35] but what is his purpose
[58:37] now god's gonna bring god exactly what's
[58:39] in his mind satan just told god oh i'm
[58:42] just
[58:42] minding the business
[58:44] going up and down to in front of her you
[58:46] know just enjoying the scenery that god
[58:48] will go right to what's in his mind
[58:50] listen what god said and god said and
[58:52] say how do i concerted my servant job
[58:55] he went right what was in satan
[58:58] [Music]
[58:59] look how satan put it just you know just
[59:02] just walking around
[59:04] ah god said no i know your naughtiness i
[59:07] know what's in your mind and i'm gonna
[59:09] call it out you considered a joke
[59:14] hello
[59:15] you remind me of some of these slick
[59:17] bars when you're acting what are you
[59:18] doing oh are you doing nothing
[59:21] ah i'm just you know standing over here
[59:23] no you're not you're scoping
[59:29] a lot of times god lets you just peek in
[59:30] their mind uh
[59:33] all you do look in their eyes
[59:37] they're looking for a girl
[59:40] looking at her conscience
[59:42] to see if she's going through something
[59:44] so they can spread their nice little
[59:46] words
[59:51] i call them predators
[59:55] he said brother birdie that is pretty
[59:57] cold nope that's what a predator does a
[59:59] lion might be the strongest they sell
[1:00:01] the jungle but he's smart too he look
[1:00:03] for a weak wilder beast
[1:00:06] you don't want a strong one he'll he'll
[1:00:09] just watch them get going and then you
[1:00:10] see a weakling yeah he'll jump on the
[1:00:12] wheaton
[1:00:14] and that's what prelaters do
[1:00:20] god went straight to satan's mind you
[1:00:22] consider
[1:00:24] my servant job
[1:00:26] there is nothing like him in the earth
[1:00:31] perfect
[1:00:32] and outright man
[1:00:34] one that feared god and the sewage evil
[1:00:36] i wish i could be building that
[1:00:38] congregation conversation god is telling
[1:00:40] satan that say i say wait i could just
[1:00:42] see satan with god telling him that god
[1:00:45] said hey no lock him in the earth satan
[1:00:48] yeah right
[1:00:50] i can change that god just bragging on
[1:00:52] job
[1:00:53] and like the prophet said could he do
[1:00:55] that about you
[1:00:56] i'll say yes god can't brag on his bride
[1:00:59] why can't god brag on his bride because
[1:01:01] the prophecy went forth
[1:01:03] she will not fall
[1:01:04] like eve have fallen
[1:01:06] so god can brag on his bride see she
[1:01:08] ain't going to fall do whatever you want
[1:01:10] to do to say she ain't going to fall
[1:01:14] i just love it
[1:01:18] satan says here
[1:01:21] satan answered the lord and said the job
[1:01:23] feared god for naught
[1:01:24] this is picture here friends
[1:01:27] job is minding his business enjoying his
[1:01:29] wife just just having a good time and he
[1:01:32] don't even know god and satan talking
[1:01:33] about it
[1:01:38] come on you and i don't understand what
[1:01:40] we going on in the other rooms
[1:01:42] the conversation still goes on
[1:01:44] they still go on saturday
[1:01:46] i can make nothing fall guards no you
[1:01:47] can't
[1:01:49] can't do it say you say all right move
[1:01:50] that head you got how to move it
[1:01:53] i'll move it go ahead
[1:01:56] i preached on his years ago and i
[1:01:57] remember preaching on removing the hedge
[1:01:59] that wasn't the title but i used that
[1:02:01] statement because you got to catch the
[1:02:03] impact of how much courage and faith god
[1:02:07] had in job he had so much faith in job
[1:02:10] till he was willing to move his
[1:02:11] protection from job and prove to the
[1:02:14] devil job can beat you without me
[1:02:16] helping you helping him
[1:02:21] that's why that's why everything's going
[1:02:23] wrong with pressure now god don't move
[1:02:25] the hedges
[1:02:26] from the bride and telling satan she
[1:02:29] ain't gonna fall
[1:02:31] she don't need me to help cause i'm in
[1:02:34] her
[1:02:35] she got what's inside of her that's
[1:02:37] gonna whip you say so i'm just gonna
[1:02:38] stand back i'm just gonna watch
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:44] that's the confidence god has in his
[1:02:45] bride friends
[1:02:49] have not made it he said has not thou
[1:02:51] made an hedge about him
[1:02:54] see how satan unstudied this brother
[1:02:57] he already know the boundaries what god
[1:03:00] done done he do the same thing to you
[1:03:02] and me he know he knew all about you
[1:03:06] and about his house
[1:03:08] and about all that he had on every side
[1:03:11] satan knew job family satan knew he even
[1:03:15] knew i can't even touch the children
[1:03:17] because of job
[1:03:19] i can't even touch his house because of
[1:03:21] job that's why it's so important for us
[1:03:23] parents that make sure we're in favor
[1:03:25] with god doing what we're supposed to do
[1:03:27] in our home god will take care of your
[1:03:29] children god will take care of your
[1:03:30] house you just stay right with god he
[1:03:33] does it
[1:03:34] that's your proof right there
[1:03:38] even when satan children went out and
[1:03:40] party i mean children wouldn't party job
[1:03:43] prayed for
[1:03:44] he said pray adventure they might sin
[1:03:46] and the prophet said that's what a good
[1:03:48] parent should do you never know what
[1:03:50] your children are going to be getting
[1:03:51] into involved but you can always pray
[1:03:53] and keep them before god say god i
[1:03:55] commit them to you
[1:03:59] i never seen a time
[1:04:01] like it is now
[1:04:03] where marriages is being destroyed
[1:04:09] never seen a time like
[1:04:10] this but it's happening
[1:04:13] because of pressure
[1:04:16] pressure
[1:04:17] let me tell you
[1:04:19] i don't understand why people think
[1:04:21] their marriage can survive
[1:04:23] without communication
[1:04:29] your relationship with god can't survive
[1:04:31] without communication
[1:04:35] he wants to fellowship with you he wants
[1:04:37] to talk to you he wants to communicate
[1:04:38] with you and if that be so with god that
[1:04:41] also is in the natural
[1:04:44] and i'm talking about communication not
[1:04:46] complaints communication
[1:04:49] about communicating
[1:04:50] talking to one
[1:04:52] another it makes your marriage healthy
[1:04:56] when you talking to one another
[1:05:00] a lot of times people don't understand
[1:05:03] why when i say something
[1:05:05] it hurts my wife feeling when i say
[1:05:07] something to hurt my husband feeling
[1:05:09] it just really tears him up
[1:05:11] and i said that's good hey
[1:05:14] what you mean that's good it's not
[1:05:15] actually good
[1:05:17] what's bad when there's no feelings
[1:05:22] then you'll become indifferent
[1:05:25] when she say something to you whatever
[1:05:28] you see something her whatever just
[1:05:30] rolls right off
[1:05:31] that's bad
[1:05:34] but when it can hurt
[1:05:36] at least know that there's feelings
[1:05:38] still there
[1:05:42] you see what you said hurt me and if you
[1:05:45] got physically i didn't mean to
[1:05:47] what was it now you can communicate
[1:05:49] about it
[1:05:56] gotta communicate
[1:06:00] but chad i'm gonna have to say i'm
[1:06:01] always close to note because it ain't
[1:06:02] working
[1:06:05] let me just give some stories
[1:06:08] i just give some stories
[1:06:16] how many you ever read this quote
[1:06:19] i probably don't preach to here but i
[1:06:21] say it again this is one of my favorites
[1:06:26] when that little girl
[1:06:28] boy left her
[1:06:30] and she kept screaming johnny i know
[1:06:32] johnny loves me ain't nobody ever read
[1:06:34] that quote
[1:06:36] i know johnny loves me i know johnny
[1:06:38] loves me
[1:06:42] you gotta remember what the prophet said
[1:06:45] he hurt her
[1:06:46] he broke her heart
[1:06:48] he said but then she formed herself
[1:06:51] in that world
[1:06:55] she made that work she was he was
[1:06:57] married to another girl but still she
[1:06:59] said i know johnny loves him i know
[1:07:01] johnny love she created that world
[1:07:05] i think present stage of my ministry or
[1:07:07] ever present from
[1:07:09] every present ever present water from
[1:07:11] the rock
[1:07:12] the prophet said there's enough power in
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:17] in me
[1:07:18] you can go create your own private world
[1:07:21] and live in it
[1:07:22] he said but there's if it wasn't a law
[1:07:24] to it you could do it
[1:07:27] your powers is in you now
[1:07:31] i'm here to tell you
[1:07:33] you also have the power in you
[1:07:36] to create the wrong world
[1:07:42] create the wrong world
[1:07:45] as a pastor
[1:07:47] i see time after time after time
[1:07:51] dealing with people
[1:07:53] i just begin to realize they created a
[1:07:57] wrong world
[1:07:58] that they live in it
[1:08:00] and as far as they are concerned
[1:08:02] everybody else is wrong because they are
[1:08:04] not in their world
[1:08:07] them things will get you keep you and
[1:08:09] grip you
[1:08:14] a man can do it a woman can do it you
[1:08:17] can create those wrong world
[1:08:20] but i like what he said when he was
[1:08:22] talking to this girl
[1:08:24] god showed him a vision
[1:08:26] he said some transaction happened
[1:08:28] between her and that boy
[1:08:29] and when he told her she snapped out of
[1:08:31] that world
[1:08:34] and then he said now that you're out of
[1:08:35] that world
[1:08:37] look towards calvary
[1:08:39] so it took a supernatural element of
[1:08:42] vision to make a snap out of that world
[1:08:45] and i find that the same thing it takes
[1:08:47] something to strike a person's heart to
[1:08:50] pull them out of the world that they
[1:08:52] don't form themselves in it because when
[1:08:54] you get yourself in worlds you actually
[1:08:57] become right in your own world
[1:08:59] and it's right to you
[1:09:01] [Music]

[1:17:41] you know we sat in the car i wrapped
[1:17:42] them around there can you see you know
[1:17:45] see my wife smart so when i started
[1:17:47] leaving out of the
[1:17:48] motel i knew what she was going to do
[1:17:51] she was going to calculate every turn
[1:17:54] and try to map out where we're going so
[1:17:56] i just circled around the motel
[1:18:00] that throws everything off i just
[1:18:01] circled around
[1:18:05] then we got the driver
[1:18:07] and she said
[1:18:08] how long it's going to be forget that i
[1:18:09] said it
[1:18:10] ain't that long it ain't that long
[1:18:14] and it was a lot of tension because
[1:18:16] everything
[1:18:17] kate was not doing right this didn't do
[1:18:19] what they potentially start going
[1:18:21] and then my daughter said dad
[1:18:24] you got to come a little
[1:18:25] come a little late
[1:18:28] she said mama remember beside you
[1:18:30] knowing my phone run
[1:18:34] i had kind of blanked out a little
[1:18:35] minute she was sitting there i said

[1:18:55] right so we went on another scenic route
[1:18:58] i just circled around the berlin where
[1:19:00] in the world we had
[1:19:02] then i got close to the church
[1:19:05] when i was getting close to the church i
[1:19:07] see my son pass go in the
[1:19:09] little direction what are you
[1:19:12] coming with
[1:19:14] attention
[1:19:16] then i pulled up to the church
[1:19:19] and then we got gravel in our parking
[1:19:22] lot
[1:19:23] she said
[1:19:25] see the bird
[1:19:26] i hear gravel that sounds like gravel i
[1:19:29] said yeah
[1:19:30] what restaurant got ground
[1:19:35] i said nishi i said we're going to get
[1:19:37] on some pavement it's just it's a lot of
[1:19:39] cars out here
[1:19:40] that was true there was a lot of car
[1:19:43] she said
[1:19:44] all right
[1:19:47] the people walking by knew that she just
[1:19:50] sitting there and then uh
[1:19:53] all right you know i had pulled back to
[1:19:54] the back with the fellowship hall
[1:19:56] i said you ready they restocked the door
[1:19:59] i can't so you stay right there i'm
[1:20:01] coming open the door open the door when
[1:20:03] she put her foot out she said this grass
[1:20:06] what kind of restaurant got crashed
[1:20:08] i said nation
[1:20:10] just hold on my hand
[1:20:13] just hold my hand i'ma i'm gonna walk
[1:20:14] you through it this is so it's okay it's
[1:20:16] okay
[1:20:20] then we got in the fellowship hall
[1:20:22] people all around then we got in
[1:20:26] she was just doing like this and when i
[1:20:28] took that
[1:20:30] regard surprise
[1:20:33] she was shocked
[1:20:36] and she just said
[1:20:38] all of these beautiful people
[1:20:41] people was everywhere
[1:20:44] she just started walking like a zombie
[1:20:47] we they had a table for us
[1:20:49] she was just doing right there
[1:20:52] they always sat down
[1:20:54] she said burn i feel so bad i said you
[1:20:56] ought to
[1:21:01] i said look at this world you created
[1:21:04] now look we done this for you
[1:21:08] i said but you let your mind go so many
[1:21:10] places
[1:21:12] doom and gloom because it's a world you
[1:21:15] created
[1:21:21] we do the same thing
[1:21:25] sister never let the devil come to you
[1:21:27] and say your husband don't appreciate
[1:21:28] you
[1:21:32] children don't appreciate you
[1:21:34] they don't appreciate what i do around
[1:21:35] this house
[1:21:37] don't let the devil do that to you
[1:21:38] because i'm gonna tell you what's gonna
[1:21:39] happen
[1:21:42] you're gonna start walking around your
[1:21:44] house
[1:21:45] i call it zombie mode
[1:21:47] and not saying it to be funny
[1:21:49] you will be in your house
[1:21:52] functioning
[1:21:53] without an anointing
[1:21:56] you just go through motions cook he
[1:21:58] likes this thing they like
[1:22:01] because you're in your own world nobody
[1:22:03] appreciates me now
[1:22:06] because when you feel appreciated you
[1:22:08] just
[1:22:10] cook
[1:22:11] then you excited
[1:22:14] because you you feel appreciated but
[1:22:16] when you get in that wrong world
[1:22:19] everything come down
[1:22:23] same as a man
[1:22:26] when you don't feel appreciated
[1:22:28] look at the children look at that they
[1:22:30] always want something buy me this and
[1:22:33] buy me that but they don't see where it
[1:22:35] comes from what i have to go through to
[1:22:36] get it and stuff
[1:22:38] man
[1:22:39] you creating the world
[1:22:41] and when you create the world it caused
[1:22:43] you to respond wrong
[1:22:47] you start being negative
[1:22:49] and bitter
[1:22:51] because it's your world you create it
[1:22:53] and you think everybody got to come in
[1:22:58] it ain't right
[1:22:59] that's not right
[1:23:01] we ought to live in a world of faith
[1:23:05] believe in the promises of god
[1:23:07] knowing who we are that we are the bride
[1:23:10] of jesus christ
[1:23:12] that's where we ought to be living
[1:23:14] not in the doom of gloom see it's all
[1:23:16] kind of worlds i can name all different
[1:23:18] ones i know it's getting a little late
[1:23:20] there's a different world we create
[1:23:22] and they'd be wrong
[1:23:25] a lot of people create worlds just by
[1:23:27] looking at services on the internet
[1:23:29] then they create a world against their
[1:23:31] own church
[1:23:35] why our church don't do that
[1:23:37] look what they do in their church
[1:23:39] we don't do that then they come in their
[1:23:41] church
[1:23:46] own little world
[1:23:48] only thing in church is their body
[1:23:52] not the spirit
[1:23:56] children do that stuff
[1:23:59] boys do that girls do that create worlds
[1:24:02] and they be the wrong ones
[1:24:04] everybody she got a girlfriend she don't
[1:24:06] got well she got a boyfriend well
[1:24:09] that's around the message
[1:24:14] too don't know who thought that
[1:24:17] that homosexual spirit won't come around
[1:24:19] message believers i don't know who
[1:24:21] thought it won't but
[1:24:22] that's the main place to try to come
[1:24:26] because we got to remember
[1:24:29] it was so bad they wanted angels
[1:24:33] as close as you gonna get around angels
[1:24:35] around the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:37] they wanted them
[1:24:38] that's how bad it's getting
[1:24:40] and people don't realize this stuff
[1:24:43] talk to your children
[1:24:45] talk to your daughters talk to your sons
[1:24:48] if you gotta talk about cushion they
[1:24:50] might get tired of hearing them but
[1:24:51] still keep planting them seeds and let
[1:24:54] them know the program of god
[1:24:56] your son your daughter god you can you
[1:24:58] can live a half to have a happy life
[1:25:00] happy healthy marriage you can have it
[1:25:02] just just put god before everything put
[1:25:05] it in
[1:25:08] and sometimes you might seem like it
[1:25:09] ain't doing it i promise you the
[1:25:11] scripture said train them the way they
[1:25:13] should go
[1:25:15] praise the lord
[1:25:17] worlds
[1:25:20] i'm a pastor
[1:25:22] i've been guilty of creating my own
[1:25:24] world
[1:25:26] oh yeah

[1:27:00] let it out don't try to handle it by
[1:27:02] yourself
[1:27:03] let it out
[1:27:05] praise the lord my son
[1:27:08] he tell me some things what he used to
[1:27:10] do when he was a child i just shake i
[1:27:12] couldn't believe you done stuff like
[1:27:13] that he didn't laugh about it wasn't bad
[1:27:15] stuff
[1:27:16] daddy he just some of this stuff in his
[1:27:19] imagination
[1:27:21] he's a daddy
[1:27:23] he's a man
[1:27:27] he said i know i got in trouble one day
[1:27:31] he said you came home that particular
[1:27:33] day
[1:27:35] he said he was eating your dinner see my
[1:27:37] son my youngest one
[1:27:39] i always knew when he was in trouble
[1:27:43] he won't eat
[1:27:45] and that boy loves to eat whenever he
[1:27:46] won't come to the dinner table and eat
[1:27:49] i know he don't got in trouble in school
[1:27:52] it never failed
[1:27:55] he just loses his appetite
[1:27:58] is it dead
[1:28:00] it's when i
[1:28:02] seen you eating your food when you put
[1:28:03] that spoon to your mouth he said you're
[1:28:05] seeing your muscles on your arm
[1:28:10] he's like oh this man gonna kill me
[1:28:14] that's the boy you crazy
[1:28:16] he's a but daddy
[1:28:18] he's the one that you just can ready to
[1:28:19] get me up with him
[1:28:21] and then one of your friends popped up
[1:28:24] and said hey you want to go fishing
[1:28:26] he said then you say
[1:28:29] yeah let's go
[1:28:30] he said then you looked at me and said
[1:28:33] i'm gonna get you when i come back
[1:28:37] he said that i went in my room and i
[1:28:38] prayed
[1:28:40] to god
[1:28:41] you will forget
[1:28:44] just pray
[1:28:47] he i guess god answered his prayer
[1:28:50] so god got ways to make children pray
[1:28:55] so god answered his prayer i think i
[1:28:56] forgot
[1:28:58] but he could tell me those things
[1:29:00] but i had to ask myself
[1:29:04] what did i project
[1:29:06] to make him feel that way though that
[1:29:08] i'm some kind of brute father
[1:29:12] what did i do
[1:29:13] so i don't want to project nothing like
[1:29:15] that i want to know yes from your father
[1:29:17] but when i have to correct you i will
[1:29:19] because that's my job that's my duty and
[1:29:21] the correction is not to kill you it's
[1:29:23] to help you
[1:29:25] because that's the parent's duty
[1:29:27] children be like ah yeah no the bible
[1:29:30] said let them jump it won't kill them
[1:29:33] they scream they care
[1:29:36] but it won't kill children and nothing
[1:29:39] but this day is a bunch of psychologists
[1:29:42] they can play with your emotions
[1:29:45] huh
[1:29:46] they can say some stuff that throw you
[1:29:48] off track
[1:29:49] they can do it i just never forget even
[1:29:52] my son one day he just messed up
[1:29:54] my son imma have to i'm not disciplined
[1:29:58] i have to discipline he really did
[1:30:00] something bad
[1:30:02] he pleaded so bad daddy no daddy dad
[1:30:05] please
[1:30:07] he starts saying mercy
[1:30:09] mercy
[1:30:11] he said that mercy with so much
[1:30:12] compassion till it start bothering my
[1:30:15] mind
[1:30:17] the scripture comes in my mind he that
[1:30:19] show no mercy receive no mercy
[1:30:22] that's not passion that he will it
[1:30:24] really messed me up
[1:30:26] but i had to push all that reason aside
[1:30:28] as a son you stepped over grace
[1:30:30] you stepped over grace i have to be a
[1:30:33] disciplined parent i have to i have to
[1:30:35] do it
[1:30:36] can we get the law of the hand
[1:30:37] i'm going to stop for the chad
[1:30:43] more coming up so i better stop
[1:30:45] may the lord bless you it's a little
[1:30:48] late but i got a lot in my heart but
[1:30:51] trust me
[1:30:52] god changed the service
[1:30:54] and i just prayed something was said to
[1:30:57] help you
[1:30:58] because that's my i'm telling you pastor
[1:31:00] that's my only interest if i can't help
[1:31:02] nobody i won't i won't do i'd rather not
[1:31:03] do nothing i can't help say something to
[1:31:06] help
[1:31:07] that's my whole motive energetic all it
[1:31:09] has been to try to help people
[1:31:12] see them watch them grow in the lord
[1:31:15] that's what have been my motive in the
[1:31:16] jedi since i've been in this message
[1:31:19] yeah you get misinterpreted sometimes
[1:31:21] that your legalists are hard i'm over
[1:31:24] all that kind of stuff because i know
[1:31:25] what's in my heart
[1:31:27] this is what i know you can't play with
[1:31:30] spirits
[1:31:32] don't play with the devil
[1:31:35] let's just borrow hearts musicians
[1:31:36] should come
[1:31:51] maybe we could uh
[1:31:53] pl you play that song draw me near
[1:31:57] you know that song brother
[1:31:59] drop me near i think that's a wonderful
[1:32:01] song
[1:32:03] for us that we want to be drawn nearer
[1:32:04] to him
[1:32:06] i know i do
[1:32:08] and he's the one that does the drawing
[1:32:11] he pulls on us
[1:32:13] and i'm so thankful that he does
[1:32:15] if i'm asked a question how do you know
[1:32:17] god loves you
[1:32:19] i said man the way he beats me
[1:32:21] the way he corrects me
[1:32:23] i know he loves me
[1:32:25] he's a
[1:32:26] true father let's pray father
[1:32:31] we so thank you for your word
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:34] things just changed lord
[1:32:36] but that's okay
[1:32:38] i think about what the prophet said that
[1:32:39] any minister knows
[1:32:41] when you want to change the direction
[1:32:43] they know to leave the notes alone
[1:32:46] and that's what we did lord because
[1:32:48] some things i just really felt
[1:32:50] need to be said
[1:32:52] and i know it's not going to return void
[1:32:54] it'll go exactly to where your purpose
[1:32:56] is to go
[1:32:58] the father i just poured out my heart
[1:32:59] this evening
[1:33:01] trying to show
[1:33:02] even what's in satan's mind
[1:33:04] is up to no good
[1:33:06] it's deceiving to get people to feel
[1:33:10] religious but not born again
[1:33:13] sanctified but not filled with the holy
[1:33:16] spirit
[1:33:17] satan is such a deceptive deceiver in
[1:33:19] these things
[1:33:20] but i'm so thankful oh god for
[1:33:22] predestination
[1:33:24] that everything is into your hands oh
[1:33:26] god it's not me choosing you you chose
[1:33:28] me
[1:33:29] and i'm also thankful for the scripture
[1:33:30] that whenever you start a good work lord
[1:33:33] you're also gonna finish it
[1:33:35] and we're going to be just like paul
[1:33:36] we're fully persuaded that we commit to
[1:33:39] you lord that you'll carry it through
[1:33:42] so father we thank you this evening and
[1:33:44] i pray that you just really dealt with
[1:33:46] the heart
[1:33:46] of a young person
[1:33:48] to let them just be careful of the
[1:33:50] things
[1:33:51] that's surrounding them because we got
[1:33:53] choices
[1:33:55] nobody can force us to do nothing we
[1:33:56] also can say no we have choices
[1:33:59] and maybe we just recognize hey i'm a
[1:34:01] son of god
[1:34:03] i might be in this blood to see an age
[1:34:05] but i'm not a layer of sin
[1:34:07] i am a son and daughter of the lord
[1:34:08] jesus christ so father i just commit
[1:34:10] everything to you
[1:34:12] and into your hands in the name of jesus
[1:34:14] christ we pray
[1:34:17] amen may the lord bless you
[1:34:19] oh
[1:34:20] chad god bless you my friend
[1:34:23] thank you god

[1:34:47] but i long to
[1:34:50] rise in the
[1:34:53] arms of
[1:34:55] faith and be closer
[1:35:00] drawn
[1:35:02] to thee
[1:35:05] drawing nearer
[1:35:11] near
[1:35:13] blessed lord
[1:35:15] to the cross
[1:35:18] where
[1:35:24] [Music]

[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:06] let my soul
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:10] up

[1:36:18] be
[1:36:20] lost in the
[1:36:25] draw me nearer
[1:36:31] mirror blessed lord
[1:36:35] to the cross
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:37:02] leading sounds
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:06] amen god bless you
[1:37:08] you know what we saw tonight was god
[1:37:10] take a man in his hand and turn him from
[1:37:13] where he thought he was going to go to
[1:37:14] where god needed him to go
[1:37:17] amen pay close attention to those things
[1:37:20] don't let that don't let the uniqueness
[1:37:22] of what god did here tonight
[1:37:24] be wasted
[1:37:26] grab the portion that god spoke to you
[1:37:28] and hold on to it god was trying to get
[1:37:29] our attention
[1:37:31] and and you know i know more than most
[1:37:34] people know
[1:37:36] and i know how needful that was
[1:37:39] and i can't even tell you why
[1:37:42] but i knew what god was doing
[1:37:44] and i know it was needful
[1:37:46] and i know that we need to pay attention
[1:37:49] that we don't allow our circumstances
[1:37:52] and our own mind to create our own
[1:37:54] perception of reality
[1:37:57] but we need the word to constantly wash
[1:37:59] that away and give us reality
[1:38:02] what is reality this message is reality
[1:38:04] the word of god is reality what god says
[1:38:07] about us is reality not what we're
[1:38:09] thinking other people are thinking about
[1:38:10] us that's not reality the reality is
[1:38:12] what god thinks of us
[1:38:15] amen and we need to stay true in the
[1:38:18] real realm the only reality is god's
[1:38:20] reality everything else is false
[1:38:23] amen when we find ourselves getting
[1:38:25] caught up into these things we need to
[1:38:26] come back to the word and say god wash
[1:38:29] my mind away i'm getting discouraged i'm
[1:38:31] getting angry i'm getting upset because
[1:38:34] of what i'm thinking about amen but god
[1:38:36] wash all that away and let me think on
[1:38:38] your word that will bring me joy bring
[1:38:40] me peace and erase all of these things
[1:38:43] the devil's playing with in my mind
[1:38:46] so i know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:38:48] what brother burley went into when god
[1:38:50] took him and turned him was important
[1:38:53] very important and i trust god will let
[1:38:56] the message hit home
[1:38:58] until we'll come back to the real
[1:39:00] reality
[1:39:02] and also what did the warning he gave to
[1:39:04] the young people
[1:39:06] let me tell you
[1:39:07] you're going to get out into the world
[1:39:09] as you go to college and school and into
[1:39:11] the workforce you're going to face more
[1:39:13] and more things and more and more
[1:39:14] opportunities to come in contact with
[1:39:16] stuff and i'll tell you don't play with
[1:39:17] any of it
[1:39:19] don't play with any of this world is so
[1:39:22] enticing it's so entertaining and
[1:39:24] they've learned how to capture amen the
[1:39:27] minds of human beings with with little
[1:39:29] snippets of entertainment and funny
[1:39:31] things and little video clips and all
[1:39:33] that stay away from all of that stuff
[1:39:35] it's trying to suck you into more deeper
[1:39:38] and further and it'll play with your
[1:39:40] mind
[1:39:41] but now's the time to consecrate
[1:39:43] yourself and separate from those things
[1:39:45] and say i want my mind preserved for the
[1:39:48] word of god i don't want my mind full of
[1:39:51] little funny clips and snippets and this
[1:39:53] that and the other thing
[1:39:55] but i want my mind focused and full of
[1:39:57] the word of god
[1:39:59] if you do that from the time you're
[1:40:00] young you won't be standing like me and
[1:40:02] like these others who wish that we could
[1:40:04] erase things that we saw wish we could
[1:40:06] erase things that we heard and we
[1:40:08] constantly have flashbacks from old
[1:40:10] things that we saw and things we
[1:40:11] experienced but you have an opportunity
[1:40:13] to not have to deal with that
[1:40:16] i say preserve your mind for god this is
[1:40:18] a special generation this is a special
[1:40:20] age this is the end of the end and
[1:40:22] you've been called to manifest at this
[1:40:24] time amen preserve your mind for the
[1:40:26] word of god because you're going to see
[1:40:29] the greatest thing that god has ever
[1:40:30] done is he doing now
[1:40:33] and the devil will try to get you off
[1:40:35] course and play with your mind
[1:40:38] amen
[1:40:39] tonight was unique
[1:40:40] it was needful
[1:40:42] i'm brother i'm so thankful brother
[1:40:44] burley was here and as a gift in such a
[1:40:46] way that he can be so sensitive when god
[1:40:48] turns him he can move and he can follow
[1:40:50] regardless of what anybody else thinks
[1:40:53] because i as a pastor know it was
[1:40:55] needful
[1:40:56] amen take it home take it personal amen
[1:41:00] don't waste what god did here tonight
[1:41:02] amen how many will be praying for
[1:41:04] brother burley

[1:41:07] been busy i know he's tired pray for him
[1:41:09] that god will bless amen god bless you
[1:41:12] brother bernie i love you i appreciate
[1:41:14] the way god made you amen
[1:41:17] praise the lord sometimes i marvel at
[1:41:19] how god uses gifts and i always think i
[1:41:21] wish i was more like that
[1:41:24] but we are what we are by the grace of
[1:41:26] god if we all stay on our channel and
[1:41:28] let god use us the way he's called us
[1:41:30] we'll get the work of god done all right
