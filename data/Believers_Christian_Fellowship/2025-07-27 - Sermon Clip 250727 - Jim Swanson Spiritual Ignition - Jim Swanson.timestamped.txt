[0:00] But you see combustion is a effect when
[0:02] you have the fuel
[0:05] and the spark
[0:07] and the atmosphere. Now when the
[0:10] gasoline for you I might lose some
[0:13] people here but the gasoline has to be
[0:15] vaporized.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; You could have gasoline in a big b
[0:20] bottle or can up here and I could throw
[0:21] a match right in it and put the match
[0:23] out. It wouldn't do anything. But you
[0:24] atomize that gasoline. Yeah.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to you atomize it. That's in
[0:30] the spirit realm.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; When you atomize a gasoline, it's
[0:34] getting ready for ignition.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; And when the ignition strikes it, it has
[0:38] one purpose. It wants to explode.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in you.
[0:44] When you hear the word, you know, the
[0:46] fuel is the word, but the word alone is
[0:49] dead.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; The letter kleth,
[0:53] &gt;&gt; but the spirit gives it life. I don't
[0:55] care how good I rebuilt an engine. If I
[0:58] didn't have it ready to experience the
[1:00] fire of the fuel and the gas that was in
[1:04] there and it atomized into another
[1:07] a vapor, it would never start. But even
[1:10] if I did all that and it started, it it
[1:14] isn't going to go anywhere.
[1:17] So I can go in and sit down in the flesh
[1:19] seats and go to sleep.
[1:21] What are we do engines for? What are we
[1:23] coming to the message for? To move on.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; There has to be a move. So that's called
[1:28] transmission.
[1:30] Did you know the scripture? Oh dear. I
[1:32] get going on the transfiguration. When
[1:35] Jesus was up on the top, did you know
[1:37] that means transformed?
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Same word,
[1:41] &gt;&gt; transfigured.
[1:43] So you're transformed by the renewing.
[1:45] But it isn't this mind. It's the mind of
[1:47] Christ.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; So, here I'm sitting in a an old Model A
[1:52] that I rebuilt and I'm I'm saying, "Dad,
[1:55] I I think I did right." Well, son, we'll
[1:57] find out. And so, I got in there and
[2:00] turned the key on and pushed the
[2:02] starters on the floor and pushing and
[2:04] roar roar roar roar. And I said, "Dad,
[2:07] what's wrong?" He said, "It's not
[2:08] getting any fire.
[2:11] It's not getting any ignition." Well,
[2:12] Dad, I've got the key in. I He said,
[2:14] "No, come out here and look." and some
[2:16] of the plug wires. Now remember the
[2:18] plugs, brother Brandon, I've got the
[2:20] quote. He said that's where the spark
[2:21] comes from.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; And how did they receive the spark from
[2:25] the coil or the magneto and it sends
[2:28] that message down to those sparks
[2:31] and the sparks are the Holy Ghost. But
[2:33] it takes a power of the Holy Ghost to to
[2:36] start them going so that they sent down
[2:39] through the spark plug to the combustion
[2:41] chamber so that little vaporized gas can
[2:45] be ignited.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in his
[2:48] service. So when our brother starts to
[2:50] preach something and you g praise God,
[2:53] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[2:54] There's an explosion going on.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; It's called combustion in the realm of
[2:58] the spirit. Yeah.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; You can't live in a church or in a in a
[3:02] age without having that happen in your
[3:04] life if you're a believer.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; So when you die and you you you're put
[3:09] in the grave, you're already alive in
[3:12] Jesus Christ while you're here because
[3:13] the rapture is a revelation.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; It's not some figment and something
[3:17] that's going to happen way down. It's
[3:19] right now.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that rapture is a
[3:21] revelation?
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe faith is a revelation? Do
[3:24] you believe that God can come on the
[3:26] scene in any aspect of your life and
[3:28] quicken the word to you?
