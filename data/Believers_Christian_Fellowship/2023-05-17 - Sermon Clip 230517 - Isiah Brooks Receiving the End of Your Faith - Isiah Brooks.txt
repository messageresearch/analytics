========================================

we've been going around saying I'm in the message I'm in the message I'm in the message and my question is where's the vindication where's the vindication where is the vindication and so let me move on to where I'm going because it's not all about walking no no no it's about life The Headstone is about life where those twin sisters Grace and love works on you and you can't have Grace when there is no love hello somebody and the love I'm talking about is not something like filial it is agape love it it so controls you you can't help yourself Hallelujah now you say what do you mean now what brother Branham gave us was a vision right habakkuk said when the vision division will speak and we know these things Hallelujah but it took a prophet to give us a vision and listen the vision we we didn't know where it was going to take us because the Bible said we haven't come this way before but now we can see the way we're going we can see the leadership of the Holy Spirit we can see that this this this uh position we call bride it's a it's a high calling in a wicked age like this in a terrible age where everything is perverted and going crazy God is calling for people to be a lamb is that right because when the sea is will open is that right John he heard a lion but when he turned he saw a bloody bleeding land it changed from the Lion to the lamb is that right that's why it is called the Lamb's Book of Life because only thing that's in this book are lambs and the Lamb's forfeits all of his rights Hallelujah I'm sorry you may be in the age of land is here which is called people's rights but when you come into this bodies you've got to strip yourself of every right you think you have Hallelujah
