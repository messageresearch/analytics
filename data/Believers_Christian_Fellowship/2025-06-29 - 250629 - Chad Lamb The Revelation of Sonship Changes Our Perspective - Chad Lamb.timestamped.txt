[12:16] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[12:19] Let's bow our heads together.
[12:22] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God. So
[12:25] thankful that you've given us a voice on
[12:27] this earth in this day to lift back to
[12:29] you and tell you we love you, that you
[12:31] are amazing, that you are the great I
[12:33] am. God, you were one day riding on a
[12:37] donkey coming into Jerusalem and people
[12:40] were lifting their voices and crying
[12:42] hosana to the king that cometh. And
[12:46] Lord, they tried to stop them. And you
[12:47] said if they stop, the rocks will cry
[12:49] out. And God, we can't stop because we
[12:52] can't leave the rocks what you've given
[12:54] to children to do. And we're your
[12:55] children. And we want to sing your
[12:56] praises. Lord, we count it a privilege.
[12:59] And we're so thankful, God, to be able
[13:01] to stand to our feet, raise our hands,
[13:03] and say, "We love you. You're wonderful.
[13:05] You're amazing. And you do all things
[13:07] well." And Lord, we're here to surrender
[13:09] ourselves to you, God. To give you our
[13:11] attention, our time, our ears, and our
[13:14] heart, Lord. That you might come and you
[13:16] might break the bread of life for us,
[13:18] Lord. that you might minister through a
[13:20] gift you placed in this body of mine.
[13:22] You might break to us your word in a way
[13:24] that we could feed on it and grow and
[13:26] become more like you and serve, Lord,
[13:28] your purpose in our lives on this earth.
[13:30] Lord, we want to give ourselves to you
[13:32] aresh this morning. May you have access
[13:35] to every heart, Lord, in every life. May
[13:37] you move, Lord, as you choose to move.
[13:39] May your spirit move with freedom in
[13:42] every heart and life. We commit
[13:44] ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[13:47] Amen.
[13:49] Amen. God bless you all. It's so good to
[13:51] be with you this morning. If you could
[13:53] take your Bibles and turn to the book of
[13:56] James as you turn there. We got quite a
[13:58] few visitors here this morning. And so
[14:00] we're happy to greet all the visitors
[14:02] who are here with us. I know brother
[14:04] Ben, brother Aaron Laau's sister Karen
[14:06] is here with her husband James and their
[14:08] boys. God bless you. They're here from
[14:10] Arizona. So we got to see them just a
[14:12] couple months ago when we were in
[14:13] Arizona. So it's good to have you again.
[14:15] and brother Ilia Luznoff's parents are
[14:17] here again, but also his sister Ulia and
[14:20] her husband Sergey from Idaho are here.
[14:22] God bless you with their kids. So, it's
[14:24] good to have the family visiting and
[14:26] coming in. And everybody else who's
[14:28] visiting, God bless you. You're very,
[14:29] very welcome. We're happy to have you
[14:31] here with us. Amen. Uh be before we uh
[14:35] read our scripture, I just want to let
[14:37] you know that next Sunday, this coming
[14:39] Sunday, a week from today, Brother Null
[14:41] Johnson will be here with us. So, he'll
[14:42] be taking the morning service. So, we're
[14:44] excited to have him back and he and his
[14:46] wife Shirley will be with us. Uh, also
[14:49] in the afternoon, we'll have our
[14:50] communion and feet washing. But I want
[14:52] to remind you that the uh trustees have
[14:54] presented a a new trustee to the
[14:56] congregation for a vote of confidence
[14:58] and that's brother Aaron Laauo. So, that
[15:00] vote will be at our communion service
[15:02] and the afternoon service next week. So,
[15:04] just keep that in mind and keep that in
[15:06] prayer. And if you haven't already
[15:07] considered it, make it a a consideration
[15:09] in prayer so that we can do that vote.
[15:12] Amen. Also, Sister Kristen Tech is here.
[15:14] God bless you. She's walking in right
[15:15] now. Amen. Uh, Brother Chris told me
[15:18] that she'd be here. Uh, he she drove him
[15:21] down to BYC. He's helping at Believer's
[15:23] Youth Camp as a counselor. And he just
[15:26] let me know that she would be here today
[15:28] with the children. And I said, "Oh,
[15:29] brother. So, you're letting me know
[15:30] there's no marital problems, you know,
[15:32] when she shows up without you?" And he
[15:34] said, "Exactly."
[15:37] So, he didn't want us to have any
[15:38] special counseling session after. So,
[15:40] God bless you, Sister Kristen. It's good
[15:42] to have you here with us, you and the
[15:43] children. Amen. Let's look together at
[15:46] James chapter 1.
[15:50] James chapter 1 2
[15:55] says, "My brethren, count it all joy
[15:58] when you fall into diverse temptations,
[16:00] knowing this that the tri of your faith
[16:03] workketh patience,
[16:05] and but let patience have her perfect
[16:07] work, that you may be perfect and
[16:09] entire, wanting nothing." Amen. God
[16:12] bless you all. As you have your seats,
[16:13] keep your place there in the Bibles.
[16:15] We're going to come back to that in just
[16:16] a moment. I just wanted to share a quick
[16:19] testimony with you. Most of you know
[16:21] yesterday there was a funeral for Sister
[16:24] Doris Bach. And I know not everybody had
[16:26] the chance to get to know her. Uh so she
[16:29] had visited here a few times with her
[16:31] family. And uh we had become friends, my
[16:34] wife and I had become friends with her
[16:35] and the Ritter family and Sister Megan
[16:37] and her boys uh just for a short time.
[16:41] But yesterday they had the uh the uh
[16:44] funeral service, the memorial service
[16:46] over at Bible Believers Church and
[16:48] Brother Cam Smith was her pastor. He
[16:50] officiated and and he preached it and I
[16:52] just had a small part and and there were
[16:54] so many testimonies, so many good things
[16:55] to hear. But what was so encouraging to
[16:57] me and what I want to share with you is
[16:59] the the life that Sister Doris lived was
[17:02] outside of church, outside of faith for
[17:05] 86 years for 86 years. But at the age of
[17:10] 86, God called her and there was
[17:12] something in her to respond and it did
[17:15] oh just sitting and listening to the
[17:17] testimonies and we had heard from her
[17:18] some but the family shared more and they
[17:21] had pictures of slideshow of her life
[17:22] and you see all her life she was going
[17:24] one way. Amen. But something happened.
[17:27] Amen. At the age of 86 and the word
[17:30] struck the seed and it came to life.
[17:32] Amen. And so uh when she be at the age
[17:36] of 86, she needed more help. She had had
[17:38] a heart issue and she needed some help.
[17:41] So she decided to move to to be with the
[17:43] Ritter family here in Ohio. She's from
[17:44] the Chicago area. She moved in and they
[17:47] had witnessed to her before. They had
[17:50] shared the message with her uh before,
[17:52] but she was resistant to it. She didn't
[17:53] want to hear anything, but she wanted to
[17:55] come and stay with them. They were so
[17:57] good to her. They they were going to
[17:58] take care of her. And as she lived with
[18:00] them, she saw the word living.
[18:05] Not just a testimony that comes by
[18:07] speech, but a testimony that comes from
[18:09] a life. And that's what brother Benham
[18:11] told us. Amen. He told us uh he says you
[18:14] got to live your sermon, not preach your
[18:16] sermon. Live your sermon. Amen. He said
[18:19] that's the voice of God thundering out
[18:21] against the devil. Amen. And that's what
[18:23] they did. And as as she saw their life
[18:26] and she saw that they were true and
[18:28] genuine and the love of God in their
[18:30] life and the word on display, she began
[18:33] to knock down the barriers and began to
[18:35] listen. And as she did, that word struck
[18:37] her heart and and she was converted. She
[18:39] was baptized at 86 years of age. Amen.
[18:43] We met her just shortly after that.
[18:46] Sister Karen Sanders got us connected.
[18:48] She was a friend of hers and we just
[18:50] instantly fell in love with her. had a
[18:52] wonderful time of fellowship. She had
[18:54] such an enthusiasm and such an
[18:56] excitement for the word and such a
[18:58] smile. And it just did me a world of
[19:01] good to be at the funeral yesterday and
[19:02] realize what God had done for her. He
[19:04] could not take her. So she was firmly
[19:06] established in the word. So in the last
[19:09] two years of her life, he drew her, he
[19:11] called her, he converted her, she was
[19:13] born again, she was established in the
[19:14] word, she made her stand in her
[19:16] testimony, and then he took her home. I
[19:19] say praise be to God. And I say that to
[19:22] encourage all of us. We have loved ones.
[19:23] We have people that we care for. People
[19:25] that we want to see the word strike
[19:27] their heart. And so so did Derek and
[19:30] Denise and and Megan and the boys. They
[19:32] wanted so much for grandma to hear it.
[19:35] But God has his own time. And God had
[19:36] his own way. And God worked it out
[19:39] perfectly. Amen. And so praise God. If
[19:42] we want something so bad, it's we can
[19:44] never want it more than God wants to
[19:46] draw his children. And if we want it, we
[19:48] just have to have faith that God knows
[19:50] how. and God knows when and we're just
[19:52] available for him to use. So, I just
[19:55] want to share that with you and also
[19:56] want to thank everybody who jumped in to
[19:58] help. Amen. It was uh the Ritter family,
[20:01] the whole family got sick immediately
[20:02] after she passed away. They couldn't do
[20:04] all the coordinating and planning.
[20:06] Sister Karen Sanders jumped in to help,
[20:08] but you know, she's very limited in what
[20:10] she can do. And she testified yesterday
[20:13] at the funeral of how everybody helped.
[20:14] And and I witnessed that I saw many of
[20:16] you come to help. Amen. Bring food, help
[20:19] serve. Amen. Uh, Sister Rachel
[20:21] Pittsenberger even got tapped last
[20:23] minute to play the piano. She wasn't
[20:25] planning on that. She walked in the door
[20:26] and they asked her to play. Praise God.
[20:29] Got to be instant in season and out of
[20:31] season. Amen. Many of you jumped in to
[20:33] help with coordinating and things and
[20:35] just want to say God bless you for it.
[20:37] The family was greatly blessed and we
[20:39] certainly appreciate it. Especially
[20:40] those who were able to make it
[20:41] yesterday. Thank you for that. Amen. So,
[20:44] it was a good day. It was encouraging
[20:47] and we got to see a a a child of God to
[20:51] her reward. Amen.
[20:53] Uh if you want to look at this scripture
[20:55] again in James chapter 1,
[20:58] I want to look at just one phrase out of
[21:00] this where it says, "My brethren, count
[21:04] it all joy when you fall into diverse
[21:06] temptations."
[21:08] Um, this is an interesting verse
[21:12] because um, just as a personal
[21:16] confession, I haven't mastered this
[21:18] scripture yet.
[21:20] So, I haven't come to the place where I
[21:22] can check that one off my checklist.
[21:24] I've got that one. I'm still pretty far
[21:27] behind. I I might have D's on my report
[21:29] card. I may have graduated past the Fs
[21:32] and got the D's, but hey, we've got to
[21:34] get a whole lot further than that. And
[21:36] so, uh, if brother Franco, if you could
[21:38] pull up that first slide, I want to take
[21:40] for a subject today, the revelation of
[21:43] sunship changes our perspective.
[21:46] And, and revelation changes everything
[21:48] in our lives, friends. Uh, we we're
[21:50] still the same human beings we were
[21:52] before. We we have the same
[21:54] fingerprints, the same color eyes, the
[21:57] same earthly name, the we live in the
[21:59] same houses, and but but at the
[22:01] revelation of who we really are when
[22:03] we're born again. Amen. Something inside
[22:06] of us changes so drastically, it changes
[22:09] everything about our life. And though we
[22:11] may go to the same job on Monday and we
[22:13] may live in the same home and we may
[22:15] still like the same food and we may
[22:17] still enjoy the same activities. Amen.
[22:20] Something drastic changes inside of us
[22:22] at the revelation of the word. And that
[22:24] change means everything to us. And when
[22:28] I say revelation of sunship changes our
[22:30] perspective, sisters, you're included,
[22:32] too. Because sunship is not just a
[22:34] masculine term. Sunship just means your
[22:37] position as a child of God. It means
[22:39] your progeny or offspring of God. So it
[22:42] works for both male and female.
[22:44] Daughtership just doesn't sound as good.
[22:47] So the revelation of sunship changes our
[22:50] perspective and so it it it means so
[22:53] much to us. Amen.
[22:56] If we look at this uh message, the
[22:58] Samaran church age out of the church age
[23:00] book, brother Ram said, "The cloudy
[23:01] skies and storms of life are no signs of
[23:04] God's disapproval. Neither are the
[23:06] bright skies and still waters signs of
[23:08] his love and approval. His approval of
[23:11] any of us is only in the beloved. His
[23:14] love is elective, which he had for us
[23:16] before the foundation of the world. Does
[23:18] he love us?" Uh yes. But how shall we
[23:21] know? We shall know because he said so.
[23:24] and manifested that he did love us. For
[23:26] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[23:28] his spirit placing us as sons. And how
[23:31] shall I prove my love to him? So how do
[23:34] we know he loves us? Because he drew us
[23:37] to himself he gave us of his spirit and
[23:40] placed us as sons. What greater love
[23:42] could be expressed? Amen. Than and he
[23:45] revealed to us our position and drew us
[23:47] to himself. Shared his spirit with us
[23:50] and positionally placed us as sons. But
[23:52] how shall I prove my love to him? By
[23:55] believing what he said and by conducting
[23:57] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[23:59] he and his wisdom allows to come to
[24:01] pass. So that last sentence is still
[24:04] something I have not mastered yet. And
[24:07] so uh when when we look at James, James
[24:10] says, "Count it all joy when you fall
[24:13] into diverse temptations." This word
[24:16] temptations,
[24:17] it means testings or provings
[24:20] to to test something in effect to prove
[24:23] it to test that it is what it says it is
[24:26] and and that that it can pass the test
[24:29] and prove that it is the substance
[24:30] whatever is being tested that it passes
[24:32] the test to prove of what substance it
[24:34] is. So when you go through your testings
[24:37] or your proving times, Amen. He says,
[24:39] "Count it all joy when you fall into
[24:43] temptation, knowing this that the trying
[24:45] of your faith workketh patience, but let
[24:47] patience have her perfect work that you
[24:49] may be perfect and entire, wanting
[24:50] nothing." We know that this testing and
[24:53] proving is going to work a result in our
[24:55] life. We know that by revelation. We
[24:58] know that because the word says so. We
[25:00] don't always feel it. We feel like
[25:02] sometimes the things are breaking us
[25:04] apart and destroying us. But the word
[25:06] never says that it's breaking us apart
[25:08] and destroying us. It the word tells us
[25:10] it's bringing us to perfection.
[25:13] So we have to we to me I have to get to
[25:16] the place where I say what the word says
[25:18] and stop saying what I feel because what
[25:20] I feel is so often opposite to what the
[25:23] word says. And this is what revelation
[25:25] of sunship will do to us. Once God
[25:27] reveals to us where we came from, who we
[25:30] are, why we're here, where we're going,
[25:32] and what his purpose is, it gives us the
[25:34] ability to look beyond the trial and
[25:36] look beyond to the things that God has
[25:38] laid in store for us. And say, "This is
[25:41] working for that goal. This is working
[25:43] for the purpose he has in my life."
[25:45] Because without revelation of sunship,
[25:47] we just become the victims of
[25:49] circumstances in life. And there are
[25:52] circumstances for everybody in life and
[25:55] not just Christians, not uncristians,
[25:57] not I mean if you're Muslim, if you're
[25:58] Jew, if you're Hindu, it doesn't matter
[26:00] who you are. Amen. He a man that is born
[26:02] of a woman is a few days and full of
[26:04] trouble.
[26:06] Amen. But but that's because of the
[26:08] fallen nature. That's because of the
[26:09] curse upon the earth. So everybody falls
[26:12] into trouble. Everybody has
[26:14] tribulations. Everybody has troubles on
[26:16] the earth. But a son and daughter of God
[26:19] was born into this situation with a
[26:21] sin-cursed body and a sin-cursed world
[26:24] because God wants us to get an education
[26:26] because he's bringing us to a perfection
[26:28] and he's using all of these
[26:29] circumstances that eat away and destroy
[26:32] the world. He's using the same
[26:33] circumstances to build us up and bring
[26:35] us into perfection, to bring us into
[26:38] maturity and bring us into our adoption
[26:40] where he can place as sons and daughters
[26:41] of God with authority that he places in
[26:43] us so that he can give us the signate
[26:45] ring so that he can give us the sword.
[26:47] Amen. Amen. So though our though our
[26:52] troubles are the same, we lose loved
[26:55] ones, we get sick, we lose jobs, we have
[26:57] financial crisis, we have things that go
[26:59] wrong, we have vehicle breaks down, we
[27:01] have family relations that goes south,
[27:03] we have everything that everybody else
[27:05] has, but they are victims of
[27:07] circumstances of a sin-cursed world. We
[27:10] are never victims of circumstances
[27:12] because we have a heavenly father who
[27:14] knows all things and has orchestrated
[27:16] everything for our good. Amen. Amen.
[27:19] See, this is why unless we have God
[27:22] revealed to us who we are to break the
[27:25] spiritual amnesia, this world will
[27:27] whittle us down into depression, into
[27:29] discouragement, into a place where we
[27:32] just can't feel like we can go on
[27:33] anymore and brings us into states of
[27:35] depression and despondency and
[27:38] hopelessness. Amen. Because there's
[27:39] nowhere else to go. If we're just born
[27:42] of whoever our earthly mother and father
[27:44] was, if the only truth in our lives is
[27:46] the truth that's on our birth
[27:48] certificate and the truth that we feel
[27:49] and see and hear, amen, then we're of
[27:52] all people most miserable. We're going
[27:53] to fail because this world is falling
[27:56] apart.
[27:57] There's no sure place to stand. There's
[27:59] no foundation. This thing is rumbling.
[28:02] Amen. And crumbling because it's going
[28:03] to be remade. Amen. It's going to bring
[28:05] forth. A it's going to be reformed for a
[28:08] new millennium. Everything is starting
[28:10] to crumble and fail. So God can bring a
[28:13] fresh everything, a fresh government, a
[28:15] fresh civilization, a fresh earth.
[28:20] So we we there's got to be something
[28:22] that happens in us. Amen. That lets us
[28:24] look beyond the circumstances. Or else,
[28:27] friends, we're just going to fall into
[28:28] the same despair that the rest of the
[28:31] world's falling into. Or or we'll move
[28:33] into some sort of coping mechanism to
[28:35] cover it up. Yeah. Which is where a
[28:37] majority of the world is
[28:40] and addictions and pleasure seeking and
[28:42] all of these other things. But when we
[28:45] have a revelation of sunship and we know
[28:46] that we have a heavenly father who has
[28:49] orchestrated our lives, he has written
[28:51] it in code. He has desired, amen, a
[28:54] definite purpose.
[28:57] Then we're going to see all the same
[28:59] trouble that everybody else in the world
[29:01] sees. I think there's one thing that
[29:04] that uh can be so um difficult to
[29:08] understand as a new Christian
[29:11] because we give our lives to Christ and
[29:13] we're born again by the spirit of God
[29:15] and we come into this wonderful
[29:17] relationship with the bridegroom and now
[29:18] we're called as bride. We feel like that
[29:21] that relationship should bring us out of
[29:24] suffering,
[29:26] out of troubles. But that is the
[29:29] opposite of what the Bible tells us.
[29:31] Amen. It's opposite.
[29:34] The Bible does not tell us that coming
[29:37] into this relationship with Christ will
[29:38] bring us out of earthly troubles.
[29:41] Not at all. And that's why there can be
[29:44] so much disappointment in Christianity.
[29:46] And even so much disappointment coming
[29:48] to the message because we feel like
[29:49] we've come to the absolute truth for our
[29:51] age. This is it. This is Christ. I'm now
[29:53] joined to Christ. Amen. There's no more
[29:55] deception. There's no more pretend.
[29:57] There's no more churchianity. There's no
[29:58] more halfway. This is everything. Amen.
[30:02] And it and it should take me beyond
[30:03] troubles and it doesn't.
[30:07] And it doesn't. It takes you through
[30:09] troubles.
[30:12] And that's what the revelation
[30:14] That's what the revelation does. So with
[30:18] revelation in our lives,
[30:21] we should be able to practice what James
[30:23] is telling us.
[30:25] Count it all joy when you fall into
[30:29] diverse temptations.
[30:32] And and I'm the first one to this
[30:34] morning going to say, "God, please help
[30:36] me." Please help me. This is what I
[30:38] want. This is what I want beyond a
[30:41] shadow of a doubt. This is what I want.
[30:43] Now, we're never going to stop being
[30:44] human beings, and you're never going to
[30:46] stop the emotional realm from reacting
[30:48] in an emotional way. So, don't feel
[30:50] discouraged if your your outer man
[30:52] reacts to situations. Your outer man
[30:54] will always react to situations. But
[30:56] just remember, there's a watchtowwer on
[30:58] the inside. There's a control tower.
[31:00] Amen. Is going to say, "Wait a minute.
[31:02] Ho ho ho ho, hold up." Amen. You're
[31:04] thinking disparaging thoughts. Amen.
[31:06] You're thinking hopeless thoughts. Amen.
[31:07] But nothing's hopeless. Amen. We're not
[31:09] in despair. Everything's right on time.
[31:12] Everything's got to be this way. And
[31:13] God's working something for his glory
[31:15] and for my good.
[31:18] Amen. So, you can't stop from being
[31:20] human. God didn't want you to stop from
[31:22] being human. And he wants you to be
[31:23] human. Amen. You realize Jesus Christ
[31:26] had to overcome his humanity. Amen.
[31:30] Remember Jesus when when he's full of
[31:33] the Holy Ghost, when he comes up out of
[31:35] Jordan, when he when he's got the
[31:37] declaration of the father, this is my
[31:39] this is my son in whom I'm well pleased.
[31:41] Amen. Immediately he goes by the
[31:43] leadership of the Holy Ghost into the
[31:45] wilderness to be tempted, to be tried,
[31:46] tested, proved by the devil. Amen. And
[31:49] those tests, Amen, were real tests. And
[31:52] those things really, amen, were
[31:53] something that were a temptation to him.
[31:55] Amen. And remember it said he had fasted
[31:58] 40 days.
[31:59] And he was afterward hunger. He was
[32:02] hungry after a 40-day fast. And the
[32:04] devil was offering him, Amen, if you'll
[32:06] just turn these stones into bread. That
[32:08] was a real temptation. And that was a
[32:10] real temptation because he was really in
[32:12] flesh and he was really hungry and his
[32:14] stomach was really turning and growling.
[32:18] You realize that Jesus Christ when he
[32:21] was on earth, if he didn't eat his meals
[32:22] and he skipped a meal, you know, he
[32:24] could start feeling faint.
[32:27] You know, he got tired from being
[32:28] overworked. He had to separate and rest,
[32:32] right? Cuz he had to learn how to
[32:34] overcome in a human body. And God
[32:37] doesn't want us to escape it. He wants
[32:39] us to come through it to learn all that
[32:41] we're supposed to learn. He wants us to
[32:42] overcome. He wants us to gain the things
[32:45] we're supposed to gain. Amen. so that so
[32:47] that he could bring us to the greater
[32:49] position that he has for us. So, we're
[32:51] going to look at this as we keep moving.
[32:54] You know, there's there's three parables
[32:58] that Brother Brandham gives and there's
[33:00] more than that, but three parables and
[33:02] and I love I I I just love the message.
[33:06] That's all I can say. I love the word of
[33:08] God. I love the way Jesus taught. I love
[33:11] the way God used the prophet in our day.
[33:13] And he makes things so simple. Amen. But
[33:15] the simple things are some of the most
[33:17] profound things in life. So he has three
[33:20] parables that I just want to bring to
[33:22] your attention. The one brother Brandham
[33:24] shares is the story of spiritual
[33:26] amnesia. And then he tells it in a way
[33:28] of of of true amnesia of soldiers coming
[33:31] back from the war who had gotten a shock
[33:33] in their system and and and something
[33:35] had happened to them and they forgot who
[33:37] they were and they could and brother Bam
[33:39] says amnesia makes it so you can't
[33:42] identify yourself. Right. Amen. That's
[33:45] important because he's going to type
[33:47] this natural amnesia with spiritual
[33:48] amnesia. Amen. This shock of being born
[33:51] in this condition. The shock of coming
[33:52] to the earth. Amen. In a hybridized
[33:55] body. Amen. It left us in a state of
[33:57] amnesia. Amen. But brother Bam tells the
[33:59] story how this man got into a familiar
[34:02] place. And it wasn't familiar to him in
[34:05] his state of amnesia, but it was
[34:07] familiar to him in his existence because
[34:09] he had been in this place before.
[34:14] Amen. And as it it got to this place, it
[34:17] was home. It was near home. And he kept
[34:19] getting closer to home. And when he got
[34:21] right to home, he saw his father. And
[34:23] when he saw his father, he knew who he
[34:25] was. Amen. The scales came off. He knew
[34:27] he was a son. He knew this was his home.
[34:29] He knew where he originated, where he
[34:31] came from, what his position, what his
[34:33] name. Amen. All about him. He knew it
[34:35] when he came in contact with the father.
[34:37] And that's why this message, this word
[34:39] has been brought back to this day. Amen.
[34:41] It's brought us back to the vicinity of
[34:44] home. Amen. Because where did we come
[34:45] from? The word.
[34:48] We came from the mind of God where the
[34:50] word originated. We're part of the word.
[34:52] Amen. And when this word was being
[34:54] restored and as we heard it preached, it
[34:56] brought us back to familiar ground. This
[34:58] is our hometown, friends. The word, this
[35:00] message is hometown. It's the water
[35:03] tower. It's the train station. It's the
[35:05] trees. It's the hills. Amen. It's where
[35:07] we originated from. And as he as he
[35:10] began to move closer and closer to his
[35:12] father, amen, he saw more and more for
[35:14] Mary. And this is what's been happening
[35:15] to us in the message, one revelation
[35:17] after another after another, as the word
[35:20] opens up, it gets more homelike and more
[35:22] homelike. And something in us begins to
[35:25] stir. And this man, even before he saw
[35:27] his father, can you imagine something
[35:30] was leading him on this journey. Amen.
[35:32] Something was going on inside of him.
[35:34] This wasn't a man taking a stroll. This
[35:36] was a man who was having an awakening on
[35:38] the inside, but he didn't yet know what
[35:40] the awakening was. He couldn't identify
[35:43] it yet. He just knew something was
[35:45] stirring. Something about this place.
[35:47] Something about what I'm seeing.
[35:48] Something about all of this is doing
[35:51] something to me.
[35:53] If you would have stopped him before he
[35:54] got all the way home, you would have
[35:56] said, "What is it? Why are you I don't
[35:57] know. I'm just compelled.
[36:01] I just I need to go over this hill. I
[36:03] know this is the path and I How do you
[36:05] know that's the path you need to take?
[36:07] How do you know why? What is compelling
[36:09] you? What is moving you? We've stopped
[36:11] at village after village after village
[36:13] and you just mosied around like
[36:14] everybody else. Yeah. And got back on
[36:17] the train and went further down. But why
[36:19] is it this time you can't get back on
[36:22] the train? Why is it this time you're
[36:24] compelled? Why is it this time you're
[36:26] moved? Listen friends, some of us grew
[36:28] up and we went church to church to
[36:30] church and we tried this, this, and
[36:31] this. Amen. But we got back on the train
[36:33] and went to the next one. But there was
[36:35] one stop on this trail.
[36:38] And when we heard the word being
[36:40] restored, something compelled us to keep
[36:42] walking, keep moving, keep going. And
[36:45] it's somewhere along the line for for mo
[36:48] for for most of us, maybe not all of us,
[36:50] we come over a hill, over a rise, and
[36:53] saw a little cabin and saw saw an old
[36:55] man sitting on the cabin and immediately
[36:57] all of a sudden he said, "That's my
[36:59] father." Oh yeah. I'm his son. This is
[37:03] where I came from. This is my home. This
[37:06] is who I am.
[37:09] Oh, praise God. It was only the father
[37:12] that could do that.
[37:16] So, that parable
[37:18] shows us the breaking of spiritual
[37:20] amnesia.
[37:22] And the breaking of spiritual amnesia
[37:25] doesn't tell us,
[37:28] let me rephrase this because I'm going
[37:30] to say it wrong. The breaking of
[37:32] spiritual amnesia is not to get the
[37:36] correct doctrine as Paul brought it
[37:43] because that's essential to bringing us
[37:46] back to our father. That's familiar
[37:49] territory. That's hometown, right?
[37:52] But the breaking am of amnesia is when
[37:55] all those scriptural truths bring you
[37:57] all the way to face your father.
[38:00] And when you face your father and
[38:02] recognize that's my father, then all of
[38:05] a sudden it breaks the amnesia in us and
[38:07] we know we're sons of God. We know we're
[38:10] daughters of God.
[38:13] That's that's the first parable I want
[38:15] to bring to your attention. See, see
[38:16] friends, it's a simple story.
[38:20] But for me, it's profound. Amen. For me,
[38:23] it's life. It's not a story. It's life.
[38:26] And it's not a story that happened in
[38:27] World War II with some soldiers or World
[38:30] War I or whatever it was from some
[38:31] soldiers at shell shock. This is my
[38:33] story. This is a reality to me. I've
[38:37] walked the path. I saw familiar sites. I
[38:39] come in contact face to face with my
[38:41] father.
[38:43] And then the next one is the eagle in
[38:45] the chickenard.
[38:47] I mean, brother tells a story in a way
[38:49] that a child would like the story and a
[38:52] child could understand the point.
[38:55] This is the way Jesus does it, too.
[38:57] Because the message isn't complicated.
[38:59] The message is simple.
[39:03] Message is super simple. What gets
[39:06] complicated is the abundance of material
[39:09] that was unlocked
[39:11] because you can go anywhere in the Bible
[39:13] and find the message, find the seven
[39:15] seal and you can preach, you can preach
[39:17] on a chapter in the Bible for who who
[39:19] knows how long. Amen. We could dive deep
[39:21] into it. We can analyze every rock.
[39:24] Yeah. And it'll show us God. It'll show
[39:27] us Christ. It'll show us the seven seal.
[39:29] It's the abundance of things that were
[39:31] opened up that can be overwhelming. But
[39:33] the message itself is simple. Amen.
[39:36] Amen. And brother Benham shows us
[39:38] through these parables how simple it is.
[39:42] Jesus showed us a simple one. A man went
[39:46] forth to sew seed
[39:49] and he swed seed, but an enemy came
[39:50] behind and swed tears. And then when the
[39:54] crop came up, they noticed there was a
[39:56] mixed there's something mixed in in in
[39:58] the crop. And and what shall we do? And
[40:01] he tells them, "Wait till the end time.
[40:02] And in the end time, there'll come a
[40:03] separation. And after the separation,
[40:05] I'll gather the wheat back into my
[40:07] garner. What did Jesus tell us in that
[40:09] parable? He told us the whole Bible.
[40:10] Yeah. Amen. That's the whole Bible in
[40:14] one story. Yeah. Right.
[40:17] Simple. But you can look at the whole
[40:19] Bible and look at the volume of the
[40:21] Bible. How much how much detail is there
[40:23] to tell us the details of that story?
[40:26] Amen. And then there's things written
[40:28] between the lines. So I mean you talk
[40:30] about a volume of information to expound
[40:32] on this simple parable. So Jesus told us
[40:36] the whole Bible story in a story.
[40:39] The eagle in the chicken yard. Brother
[40:42] tells us how you know this farmer wanted
[40:43] a sitting. So he needed so many eggs for
[40:46] a sitting of eggs for the hen to sit. So
[40:48] he went and found an eagle egg and he
[40:50] put it under there and it hatched out.
[40:52] And that eagle he said was the funniest
[40:54] looking chicken you ever seen. And it
[40:56] lived life like a chicken cuz that's all
[40:57] it ever knew. But there come a time,
[41:00] amen, where mama eagle come hunting for
[41:02] her baby because she knew she had
[41:03] another one. Amen. And and brother Bam
[41:06] types this with the word that come
[41:07] seeking us with God. Amen. This mama
[41:09] eagle comes over and screams and when it
[41:11] screams something inside of the eagle
[41:13] can re can can resonate with that
[41:15] scream. That scream hits something
[41:17] inside. And and although the chickens
[41:19] hate that scream, this eagle loves that
[41:21] scream.
[41:23] never heard it before, but when it heard
[41:24] it, it was so familiar. Yeah. That it
[41:28] was something that resonated on the
[41:29] inside. A scream, a mirroring scream on
[41:32] the inside, although the eagle had never
[41:34] screamed like that before.
[41:37] And then we know the story. Mama eagle
[41:39] gives instructions. Flap your wings and
[41:41] you can fly. And away they go into the
[41:43] the wild blue yonder. So that's another
[41:47] parable.
[41:49] But this other one that I want to I want
[41:51] to look at right now is brother Bam
[41:53] tells the parable or the story of the
[41:56] slave buyer who was in the south in the
[41:58] time of slavery. And the slave buyer was
[42:01] going through buying slaves and and that
[42:03] was his business. And he comes to a
[42:04] place and he's trying to negotiate with
[42:06] the owner of the plantation. And he sees
[42:09] one slave that's a standout amongst all
[42:11] the slaves. He holds himself with
[42:14] dignity. He carries himself with a
[42:16] certain air. He he he he he asks he
[42:19] begins to ask about the the the owner
[42:22] about this slave and he says you know
[42:23] he's the best of the bunch and you never
[42:26] have to correct him he never gets
[42:27] whipped and he says is he treated
[42:28] different not treated any different than
[42:30] any other slave he sleeps in the same
[42:32] place eats the same food has the same
[42:34] treatment but but yet he's a standout
[42:38] noticeably so and he conducts himself
[42:41] completely different than anybody else
[42:44] and and so then then I'm just going to
[42:47] read. Oh, no. I think I've got a slide
[42:49] on it. I'm going to pick this story up
[42:51] here. And he says, "What makes him so
[42:54] much different from the others?" He
[42:56] said, "I wondered a long time myself
[42:58] what made him different, but one day I
[42:59] found out over in the homeland where
[43:02] they come from, Africa, his father is
[43:04] the king of the tribe. And yet, being an
[43:06] alien, he knows he's a son of a king,
[43:09] and he acts like one. Oh, what ought
[43:12] that to do to us? Though we be
[43:14] alienated, though we are in a dark world
[43:16] of unbelief and sorrow and sickness and
[43:18] death, yet let's act like sons and
[43:20] daughters of God. We are the sons and
[43:23] daughters of the king. It ought to
[43:25] change our attitude.
[43:27] That key phrase, lock in on that. It
[43:29] ought to change our attitude.
[43:31] Everything, no matter what the rest of
[43:33] the world is, we must hold up the rights
[43:35] of God. We remember that this is not our
[43:38] home. We are not of this country. were
[43:40] not of this world, were born of the
[43:42] spirit of God which is above.
[43:45] So this this slave
[43:48] though he was robbed from his home,
[43:50] taken to another place, this is all
[43:53] against his will, everything that's
[43:54] happening to him is things that he does
[43:56] not want to happen to him.
[43:59] Uh and he and he did not volunteer for.
[44:04] So are we on the same page? the things
[44:07] that happen to you, you do not want to
[44:09] happen to you and you don't volunteer
[44:11] for most of the time. Sometimes we do.
[44:15] So here he is in this. But he had
[44:18] knowledge of who he was. He wasn't an
[44:21] amnesia. He had complete understanding
[44:23] of who he was. He knew that he was the
[44:26] son of a king. And he knew that in the
[44:28] lands of yonder, his father is the king
[44:31] of the tribe. And he is the son of his
[44:33] father. And here he is in a foreign land
[44:36] in a terrible situation. But he is not
[44:39] going to let the circumstances dictate
[44:41] his actions. He's going to live by the
[44:44] revelation of who he is.
[44:47] Simple story. Profound meaning. He says
[44:52] again in another place, what makes him
[44:54] so much different than the other slaves?
[44:55] He said, I wondered too till I found out
[44:57] over in the homeland in Africa where
[44:59] they come from, his father is the king
[45:01] of the tribe. And though he's an alien,
[45:04] yet he knows he's a king's son. That's
[45:06] his character. He wanted to act like his
[45:09] father.
[45:11] [Music]
[45:14] Oh, God help us. This is this is so good
[45:18] to me. This is so powerful to me. He He
[45:24] is not This is If you talk about the
[45:26] slave, he is not at home.
[45:30] his odds of making it back home or how
[45:33] high.
[45:35] The situation he's in is discouraging.
[45:39] The the things that are happening to him
[45:41] are not pleasant.
[45:44] But he wasn't going to let down his
[45:47] father because he knew who he was. He
[45:49] was his father's son and he wanted to
[45:51] act like his father.
[45:54] Listen, I I desperately want to act like
[45:58] my father.
[45:59] Not the one on my birth certificate, but
[46:01] the one on the birth certificate in
[46:03] heaven on the lamb's book of life. I
[46:05] want to I want to act like that father.
[46:07] Amen. If I And listen, none of us have
[46:10] found ourselves in a circumstance as bad
[46:12] as this man was. Amen. But he was able
[46:14] by the knowledge of who he was and who
[46:16] his father was and where he came from.
[46:18] By that knowledge alone, he was able to
[46:20] conduct himself in a way that made him
[46:23] stand out amongst the other slaves. And
[46:24] it was noticeably different. And it was
[46:26] based on 100% based on what he who he
[46:31] was, who his father was, and his desire
[46:34] to act like his father.
[46:37] He was a prince and he conducted himself
[46:39] like a prince.
[46:43] Praise God. So those are the three
[46:45] parables that I want us to to hold in
[46:48] our mind because they're so incredibly
[46:50] simple and we can remember them. They're
[46:53] stories that we can recall. But the time
[46:56] that we need to remember these parables
[46:58] is the next time the wheels come off the
[47:00] bus. The next time the world falls
[47:03] apart. The next time disaster strikes
[47:06] our home or strikes our health or
[47:08] strikes our life. The next time that
[47:10] happens, we need to go back to these
[47:12] parables
[47:14] and remember who our father is.
[47:17] In the message uniting time in signs, he
[47:19] says, 'I think one of the horriblest
[47:20] things is to see a man or woman that's
[47:23] constantly complaining.
[47:25] I've always thought, God, keep me from
[47:27] it. See, that weakens faith all the
[47:29] time.
[47:31] Okay, so um this is another quote I
[47:36] haven't mastered yet.
[47:39] If we're complaining, we don't realize
[47:41] that when we get into difficult
[47:43] circumstances and we start complaining,
[47:45] there's a there's a few things that are
[47:47] happening to us. Uh one is we're
[47:49] weakening faith.
[47:51] We're actually becoming weak weaker by
[47:54] the complaining. And the very fact that
[47:56] we're complaining, the complaining is
[47:59] actually uh if I could say it correctly.
[48:03] I'm always afraid that I'll say things
[48:05] incorrectly, but you guys know me. you
[48:07] love me. I can say what brother said,
[48:08] "Take me for what I mean, not for what I
[48:10] say." But if we're complaining at the
[48:13] circumstances that strike our life and
[48:15] then we begin to complain about what's
[48:17] happening. Amen. Complaining, well, all
[48:20] of the sudden it's an accusation against
[48:23] the goodness of our father
[48:26] because he allowed it to happen. Brother
[48:28] Brandham said, "Nothing happens in the
[48:29] life of a believer unless it first
[48:30] crosses his desk and he signs off on
[48:32] it." And so God knew that these things
[48:34] would be this way like he did in Job's
[48:36] life. And God was doing it to
[48:38] orchestrate something for Job. And he
[48:39] was also doing it to display something
[48:41] to the devil. And this this trial served
[48:43] a grand purpose. Amen. And in the
[48:46] economy of God and for Job personally.
[48:48] And because of that, Amen. when Job
[48:50] began to complain about the unfairness
[48:52] of it, he had to get a correction. Amen.
[48:54] And we need a correction, too. Because
[48:57] our our complaining actually when we we
[49:01] start complaining, we undermine faith.
[49:04] And you say, "What? How does it weaken
[49:06] our faith? If you think about uh uh if
[49:09] you think about it this way, it's not as
[49:11] though you say uh uh why is this
[49:13] happening to me? This is unfair.
[49:16] And it's not like you have a measure of
[49:18] faith inside and all of a sudden in
[49:20] retribution to what you said uh a little
[49:23] bit of piece of faith goes and it falls
[49:25] out.
[49:27] It's not like that. What weakens your
[49:30] faith is you're losing your identity.
[49:34] What weakens your faith is you're losing
[49:36] your identity because you're forgetting
[49:39] who you are and where you come from and
[49:40] who's orchestrated your life and why
[49:42] things are happening to you. So the
[49:45] minute you complain, it's a negative
[49:47] confession. It's contrary to the word in
[49:50] spirit and it begins to weaken our faith
[49:53] because what strengthens our faith is
[49:55] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[49:57] the word. And when our mouth matches the
[49:59] word, it strengthens our faith. When our
[50:01] mouth is contrary to the word, it
[50:02] weakens our faith. Amen.
[50:06] So, we have to be careful what what it
[50:08] is that we confess.
[50:12] Amen. Uh
[50:15] I don't want to complain
[50:18] and I sometimes do. I was talking to a
[50:21] brother yesterday at the funeral and I
[50:23] asked the brother, I said, "How are you
[50:25] doing?" He said, "Can't complain." I
[50:27] said, "That's wonderful." I said, 'I
[50:29] know a whole bunch of people who can.
[50:31] It's wonderful to finally meet somebody
[50:33] who can't.
[50:35] Amen. I wish I was one of those who
[50:36] can't complain. If God had put a bar on
[50:38] my mouth and I would stop it all
[50:40] together because it seems like it it's
[50:42] really easy to do. So, if you say you
[50:45] can't complain, I'm going to say,
[50:46] "Praise God. Don't don't ever start."
[50:51] So, I want to jump to another slide
[50:53] here. I want to look at at at something
[50:55] a little further down.
[50:59] if I can.
[51:01] And you guys know how much I love
[51:04] technology.
[51:06] So just jumping slides is like a
[51:08] monumental task for me. Brother Gabe
[51:10] makes it look super easy.
[51:13] 1 Corinthians 12:8, for this thing I
[51:15] besought the Lord thrice that it might
[51:17] depart from me. And he said to me, "My
[51:19] grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[51:22] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[51:24] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[51:26] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[51:27] of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[51:30] take pleasure in infirmities, in
[51:32] reproaches, in necessities, in
[51:34] persecutions, in distresses for Christ's
[51:36] sake. For when I am weak, then am I
[51:39] strong. Listen, there's there's a reason
[51:41] we we want to read this together because
[51:43] this is absolutely contrary to human
[51:46] thinking. The Bible is opposite to the
[51:49] brain you were born with. Completely
[51:52] polar opposite.
[51:54] Paul and when when when when James tells
[51:56] us count it all joy and fall into device
[51:59] div uh uh manifold temptations
[52:02] completely opposite to human thinking
[52:05] human emotions. Now Paul is coming to
[52:07] another place where he has got an
[52:09] affliction and this affliction is a
[52:10] thorn in the flesh. It's a messenger of
[52:12] Satan. It's buffeting him. It's
[52:13] something that is is harmful to him that
[52:15] is painful. Something he's not enjoying
[52:17] at all. And he seeks the Lord three
[52:19] times and the Lord says my grace is
[52:21] sufficient for thee. This word
[52:23] sufficient means enough.
[52:26] If I could just put it in a nutshell, my
[52:28] grace is enough for you. And praise God,
[52:32] if we could just look at that and say,
[52:34] what what is my my grace is sufficient
[52:36] for you. And you're saying, well, then I
[52:39] I I've got this reservoir of grace
[52:42] that's enough power to overcome that.
[52:43] That to me, that's not what he's saying
[52:45] either. What he's saying is the
[52:47] revelation of my grace in your life.
[52:49] That's enough. I've told you who you
[52:51] are. I've chose you before the
[52:52] foundation of the world. I called you to
[52:54] be my son and I positionally placed you
[52:56] here. Amen. He goes back and he and if
[52:59] you could go back in Paul's life, Amen.
[53:01] He tells Ananas when Paul is on the road
[53:02] to Damascus and he's he meets the pillar
[53:04] of fire. He's smitten and stricken down
[53:06] blind. And Ananas is told to go to him.
[53:09] He says, "Lord, I've heard of this man.
[53:11] He's doing all of these horrible things
[53:12] to the church." He said, "Go thy way,
[53:14] Ananas." Amen. For thou must tell him
[53:16] what things he must suffer for my name's
[53:19] sake. Amen.
[53:21] He called He called Paul by grace.
[53:28] By grace. Not by works. Paul was doing
[53:31] all kinds of wonderful religious works.
[53:34] Amen. What he thought Yeah. were
[53:36] wonderful. He was working for the
[53:38] church. He was serving God. He thought
[53:40] he was standing up for the truth. He
[53:42] thought, Amen. In a meeting with the
[53:44] pillar of fire, it unraveled everything
[53:45] that he thought that he was doing for
[53:47] God. Amen. And it crushed him. And then
[53:49] he realized he was saved by grace. That
[53:52] the grace of God had met him. The grace
[53:54] of God had called him to the ministry.
[53:56] The grace of God had told him, "Amen,
[53:58] you are going to be a light unto the
[54:00] Gentiles." And called him as a son,
[54:02] positionally placed him as an apostle
[54:04] and gave him his commission out of
[54:06] Isaiah that you're a light unto the
[54:08] Gentiles. That was all by grace. Not
[54:10] anything Paul earned, Paul did, Paul
[54:12] could have ever done to get that
[54:13] position. That was grace.
[54:16] So now when he comes into a trial in his
[54:18] flesh where he's being buffeted and
[54:19] afflicted by the devil, Amen. All of the
[54:22] sudden, Amen. when God says, "Listen,
[54:25] Paul, my grace is sufficient for thee,
[54:28] for my strength is made perfect in
[54:29] weakness." All the sudden Paul realizes,
[54:32] "Hey, I don't need anything else but the
[54:36] revelation of his grace in my life."
[54:39] Sometimes we think when when we read
[54:40] this scripture, at least I've thought in
[54:42] the past, my grace is sufficient for
[54:43] you. It's almost like God saying, "Okay,
[54:46] Paul, now I'm going to pour out to you
[54:48] extra strength." That's grace. Amen.
[54:50] Strength comes from revelation. Amen. It
[54:54] comes from being reconnected to who you
[54:56] are. Amen. When life gets difficult and
[54:59] things happen that you don't want to
[55:00] happen. Amen. And you go to prayer and
[55:02] you ask God for strength. Amen. I don't
[55:05] I I don't believe God's pouring into you
[55:07] a cup of something else. He's already
[55:08] given you of his spirit. Amen. You're
[55:10] already born again by the spirit of God.
[55:12] What I think God's doing for us is
[55:14] reconnecting us back to our revelation
[55:17] of who we are and who he is. And that
[55:19] his grace is enough.
[55:22] It's enough for every trial. It's enough
[55:24] for everything you'll face. It's enough
[55:26] for every circumstance in your life. You
[55:28] don't know what you're going to face
[55:29] tomorrow. You don't know what you're
[55:31] going to face next week. You don't know
[55:32] what's coming after that. But one thing
[55:34] you should be assured of is that you are
[55:36] a son or daughter of God. And God has
[55:38] orchestrated your life. And whatever you
[55:40] have need of, he'll give to you in the
[55:42] moment.
[55:44] His grace is sufficient for us. His
[55:46] grace in our lives is enough.
[55:50] And he doesn't have to prove it to me
[55:52] again by delivering me from this next
[55:55] affliction. He's already proved it to me
[55:57] by grace, by revelation.
[56:02] So then with this revelation
[56:05] that God is going to use weakness to
[56:07] show his power
[56:11] when
[56:12] when he says for my strength is made
[56:14] perfect in weakness
[56:17] that means
[56:19] he can't now make Paul strong
[56:24] because his strength is made perfect in
[56:27] weakness. Right.
[56:30] So, in order for him to show his
[56:31] strength, he can't take away Paul's
[56:33] weakness.
[56:36] So, this wasn't God giving him
[56:39] superhuman this or that. This was God
[56:42] reconnecting him with grace
[56:44] and saying, "Paul, don't worry. My
[56:47] strength is made perfect in weakness."
[56:50] So, God at this point couldn't have made
[56:53] him strong.
[56:55] He could only make him strong in faith.
[56:58] He couldn't have made him strong in body
[56:59] because he made him strong in body, then
[57:01] he wouldn't show his strength.
[57:04] Do we get it?
[57:07] So many times we want God to take away
[57:09] whatever it is afflicting us and
[57:11] whatever it is as our weakness and
[57:12] whatever is making us weak. Amen. But if
[57:14] he's going to show his strength through
[57:16] weakness, he can't give us strength. He
[57:18] has to give us the he has to reconnect
[57:20] us with grace. And we have to realize
[57:22] who we are and who he is and where we
[57:24] fall in his economy. And that grace,
[57:26] amen, gives us enough faith to carry us
[57:28] through in the weakness because he can't
[57:31] take the weakness away if he's going to
[57:33] show his strength in our weakness. Amen.
[57:36] We're on the same page. I think
[57:38] sometimes we keep pray, God, make me
[57:40] strong. Make me strong. Make me strong.
[57:43] But what Paul realized was, God, I need
[57:45] to stay weak. I need to stay weak
[57:47] because you're strong. and you show how
[57:49] strong you are by by working through my
[57:52] weakness and now you've connected me
[57:54] back to grace and I realize that that's
[57:56] enough. It's enough for me. Now look
[57:59] what he says next. Verse 10. Therefore I
[58:03] take pleasure
[58:05] in infirmities.
[58:07] God help us. Help us. I take pleasure in
[58:12] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[58:15] necessities, in persecutions, in
[58:18] distresses for Christ's sake. For when I
[58:20] am weak, then am I strong. Praise God.
[58:25] I want this Bible be I want this word to
[58:28] become more than a Bible verse. I want
[58:30] it to become a living reality in my
[58:32] life.
[58:34] Amen. In the message shalom, brother
[58:36] Brandham says, you say, "But brother
[58:38] Brandham, what about my mother, my dad?
[58:40] What about my people? What about my
[58:41] denomination? What will they do? They'll
[58:44] cast me out. If you can't look, if you
[58:47] can't look ahead, look up. Don't try to
[58:49] look ahead anyway. Put your hand in his.
[58:51] Let him lead you. Look up. Don't look
[58:53] ahead. You say, "Why? Why others make
[58:55] fun of me about my long hair, my taking
[58:57] off shorts, about my leaving the
[58:59] church." Suffering for his name's sake
[59:02] is growing pains of his grace.
[59:05] Amen. You're growing into grace. What is
[59:07] grace? Grace is his unmmerited favor.
[59:09] That's the revelation he gave you when
[59:11] he called you.
[59:14] Growing into that revelation of grace,
[59:16] suffering for his nameshake is growing
[59:18] pains of his grace. You're growing into
[59:20] the fullness of that grace. Suffering
[59:23] for his word, see, is growing pains of
[59:25] his grace. Yes, sir. Just remember, it's
[59:27] the grace of God has been given to you.
[59:30] Oh my. Like Paul said, hallelujah. He
[59:33] had an infirmity. Something was
[59:34] bothering him. The devil would buffet
[59:36] him blow after blow. And he consulted
[59:38] the Lord three times to take it away
[59:40] from him. Said, "I don't want this,
[59:42] Lord. Take it away from me." And then
[59:45] one night the Lord spoke to him and
[59:46] said, "Saul or Paul, my grace is
[59:49] sufficient." He said, "Then I'll glory
[59:51] in my infirmity. I'll glory in. I know
[59:53] you're the healer. I've seen you heal
[59:55] the sick, raise the dead, cast out
[59:57] devils, open the eyes of the blind. But
[59:59] if I've consulted you and tell me it's
[1:00:01] your grace is sufficient, then this
[1:00:03] devil that bothers me is the growing
[1:00:05] pains of your grace, then I'll glory in
[1:00:07] my infirmities.
[1:00:09] Amen. Sometimes what God is doing is
[1:00:12] growing us in his grace.
[1:00:14] Growing us to realize what grace is and
[1:00:17] how it's everything to us. Growing us
[1:00:20] into the fullness of adoption.
[1:00:22] Amen. I'm going to try to go back now.
[1:00:27] Praise God.
[1:00:29] I made a move. Now we're going to make a
[1:00:31] move back. Pray for me.
[1:00:36] Amen.
[1:00:40] Amen. I think I can find it.
[1:00:45] All right. This is where we were. We
[1:00:47] complaining weakens faith all the time.
[1:00:49] Now, I want to go to uh Acts chapter 5.
[1:00:53] But if it be of God, you cannot
[1:00:55] overthrow it, lest happily you be found
[1:00:56] even to fight against God. Amen. This is
[1:00:59] Galiel talking to the council when
[1:01:01] they've brought the the the Christians
[1:01:03] and brought Paul and uh John and Peter,
[1:01:06] it is brought them in because they
[1:01:08] healed the blind man or the lame man.
[1:01:10] And to him they agreed. And when they
[1:01:12] had called the apostles and beaten them,
[1:01:14] they commanded that they should not
[1:01:15] speak in the name of Jesus and let them
[1:01:17] go. And they departed from the presence
[1:01:19] of the council, rejoicing that they were
[1:01:21] counted worthy to suffer shame for his
[1:01:23] name.
[1:01:25] See, this is the language of the Bible.
[1:01:27] Count it all joy, rejoicing in
[1:01:30] persecution, glorying in affirmities and
[1:01:32] in weaknesses and necessities. And all
[1:01:35] of a sudden, we find the Bible is so
[1:01:37] different than human thinking that we're
[1:01:39] going to need we're going to need a
[1:01:40] different spirit. We're going to need
[1:01:41] different eyes. We're going to need a
[1:01:43] different understanding to move forward
[1:01:44] in God. Help us, God. Yes. Amen.
[1:01:50] Says, "For every son that cometh to God
[1:01:53] must be tried and proven and tested. He
[1:01:55] lets sickness strike you. He lets
[1:01:57] diseases come on you to test you and to
[1:02:00] prove you to show the world that you're
[1:02:02] truly the seed of Abraham. He permits it
[1:02:05] by his own will. He permits disasters.
[1:02:08] He permits the friends to turn against
[1:02:09] you. He permits all things and turns the
[1:02:12] devil loose to tempt you. And he'll do
[1:02:14] all but take your life. He could throw
[1:02:16] you on a bed of affliction. He could
[1:02:17] turn your neighbors against you. He
[1:02:19] could turn the church against you. He
[1:02:21] can do most anything. And it's God's
[1:02:23] will for him to do it. We are taught
[1:02:25] that it is more precious than gold to
[1:02:27] us. Listen what? Listen friends, it we
[1:02:31] we see at the top that that's 59 1108
[1:02:35] possessing it. So we know brother
[1:02:36] Brandham said it. So when we read it, we
[1:02:39] get to the end of it, we all
[1:02:40] automatically say amen because brother
[1:02:41] Brandham said it. And we know that that
[1:02:43] that was the mouthpiece of God in this
[1:02:45] generation. But listen, what did he say?
[1:02:48] Amen. What is he saying? What is more
[1:02:50] precious than gold to us? Disasters,
[1:02:53] friends turn against you, turns the
[1:02:56] devil loose to tempt you, but do all but
[1:02:59] take your life, throw you on a bed of
[1:03:01] affliction, turn your neighbors against
[1:03:02] you, turn the church against you, uh
[1:03:05] everything. And we're taught that that's
[1:03:08] more precious than gold to us.
[1:03:13] God, let me remember these three
[1:03:15] parables. I'm an eagle.
[1:03:19] I I'm a maybe a slave, slaved and
[1:03:21] trapped in this body of hybridization,
[1:03:23] trapped in this place far from home, but
[1:03:25] I've got a father over yonder, and he's
[1:03:27] a king of the tribe. And though I'm
[1:03:29] separated from him, I'm going to act
[1:03:31] just like him and conduct myself as a
[1:03:33] son of my father. I'm not going to bring
[1:03:35] shame to him or shame to the family
[1:03:37] name. I'm separated. May be no hope of
[1:03:39] going back, but I'm going to please my
[1:03:41] father
[1:03:42] and act just like him.
[1:03:45] Amen.
[1:03:47] Let's turn together to Acts 16. Like to
[1:03:50] read this one together.
[1:03:57] Amen. I love this kind of preaching
[1:04:00] because this is absolutely what we need
[1:04:02] every day of our lives because I will
[1:04:04] preach this today and probably by
[1:04:07] Thursday I'm going to have to go back
[1:04:09] and listen to it again because I
[1:04:10] probably will have said something I
[1:04:11] shouldn't say and probably taken an
[1:04:14] attitude I shouldn't have. Amen. We
[1:04:16] could probably preach this every other
[1:04:18] Sunday and still not have it enough
[1:04:21] because the body we live in and the
[1:04:22] world we live in, we've got to rise
[1:04:24] above it and we're going to rise above
[1:04:26] it. Amen. Not by magical fairy dust of
[1:04:29] some super super strength. It's going to
[1:04:31] be the revelation of who we are. And
[1:04:33] we're going to have to that's going to
[1:04:34] have to become reality. Listen, that was
[1:04:36] not a concept to the slave man. That
[1:04:40] slave down south who was conducting
[1:04:41] himself no matter what was going on. He
[1:04:44] conducted himself as a son of a king.
[1:04:46] That was not a theory. That was not a
[1:04:48] concept. That was not a good teaching.
[1:04:50] That was his life. That was his
[1:04:52] identification. That is who he was.
[1:04:55] Amen. And it wasn't who he was aspiring
[1:04:57] to be. It's who he was. It wasn't who he
[1:04:59] was hoping what he was. It was who he
[1:05:01] knew he was. And listen, we cannot come
[1:05:04] to this kind, this Bible kind of
[1:05:06] manifestation until we settle the
[1:05:08] question, who am I? And who is my
[1:05:11] father?
[1:05:12] It's got to be more than a theory. It's
[1:05:14] got to be more than an idea. It's got to
[1:05:16] be more than a concept. And it's got to
[1:05:18] be more than something we're aspiring
[1:05:19] to. It has to be the grace of God in our
[1:05:22] lives. And his grace is sufficient.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:26] It's got to be a revelation. It's got to
[1:05:29] be a knowing. Amen. Because life comes
[1:05:31] fast and life comes hard and it has ways
[1:05:34] of piling up. I say all the time that
[1:05:36] trials don't come in onesies. They come
[1:05:37] by threes
[1:05:39] and all a sudden they pile on top of
[1:05:41] you. Bang, bang, bang. Amen. And they
[1:05:43] completely overwhelm the human psyche
[1:05:45] and your emotional realm and all
[1:05:47] physical capabilities. We get completely
[1:05:49] overwhelmed. But when we get completely
[1:05:51] overwhelmed, we need to come back to the
[1:05:53] revelation of who we are. Amen. I am a
[1:05:56] child of God. Completely overwhelmed in
[1:05:58] the outer man. But there's something on
[1:06:00] the inner man that's different than the
[1:06:02] outer man.
[1:06:04] We need to remember who we are. And it's
[1:06:07] got to be a a reality to us.
[1:06:11] Acts
[1:06:13] 16 and 19
[1:06:17] says
[1:06:19] this is the this is uh when Paul and
[1:06:23] Silas were preaching and they cast out a
[1:06:27] spirit out of a soothsayer and everybody
[1:06:29] got upset of with them for it. And and
[1:06:32] it says in verse 19, "And when her
[1:06:34] master saw that the hope of their gains
[1:06:36] was gone, they caught Paul and Silas and
[1:06:38] drew them into the marketplace unto the
[1:06:40] rulers, and brought them to the
[1:06:42] magistrates, saying, These men, being
[1:06:44] Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
[1:06:47] and teach customs which are not lawful
[1:06:49] for us to receive, neither to observe,
[1:06:51] being Romans." And the multitude rose up
[1:06:54] together against them, and the
[1:06:55] magistrates ran off their clothes, and
[1:06:57] commanded to beat them. And when they
[1:06:59] had laid many stripes upon them, they
[1:07:01] cast them into the prison, charging the
[1:07:03] jailer to keep them safely, who having
[1:07:05] received such a charge, thrust them into
[1:07:08] the inner prison, and made their feet
[1:07:10] fast in stalks.
[1:07:12] And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed,
[1:07:15] and sang praises unto God. And the
[1:07:18] prisoners heard them. And suddenly there
[1:07:21] was a great earthquake so that the
[1:07:22] foundation of the prison were shaken and
[1:07:24] immediately the doors were open and
[1:07:26] everyone's bands were loosed.
[1:07:29] All right, we've we've we've preached on
[1:07:32] this. We've talked about it a lot. We
[1:07:33] all know it. But it is remarkable
[1:07:35] nonetheless.
[1:07:37] It's remarkable to me as a human being
[1:07:40] and it's encouraging to me as a son of
[1:07:42] God that when we see Paul and Silas so
[1:07:46] horribly treated for doing nothing
[1:07:48] wrong. I mean they cast an evil spirit
[1:07:52] out of a woman. Come on. They they
[1:07:55] delivered her from a tormenting devil.
[1:07:57] They cast an evil spirit. And but when
[1:07:59] they saw that they couldn't use her
[1:08:01] anymore, the poor woman being delivered,
[1:08:03] they would lose money. They they got
[1:08:05] angry with them. They took him for the
[1:08:07] magistrate, falsely accused them,
[1:08:09] stripped their clothes off, laid many
[1:08:11] stripes on them. Listen, this is a bad
[1:08:14] day. I've said this before. I don't
[1:08:17] think any of us have had a day this bad.
[1:08:20] Sometimes we come home from work and
[1:08:22] said, "A horrible day. Everything went
[1:08:25] wrong." Amen. I think your wife should
[1:08:27] just get this out and start reading
[1:08:29] through this. Next time you say that,
[1:08:31] this should be the dinner reading. Amen.
[1:08:32] At the dinner table, when you say,
[1:08:33] "Everything went wrong today." Why? What
[1:08:36] happened? Oh, I broke a drill bit and I
[1:08:39] couldn't find this tool and and so and
[1:08:41] so at work they whatever the servers
[1:08:43] went down and I lost a project I've been
[1:08:45] working on for a month and and I've had
[1:08:47] the worst day ever.
[1:08:51] Just say, "Honey, I'd like to read
[1:08:52] something to you."
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:08:59] These things are here for us.
[1:09:03] They laid many stripes on them,
[1:09:07] sent them to the prisoner and said, the
[1:09:09] guard and said, "Keep them safe." So he
[1:09:11] put them in the inner prison
[1:09:15] and he made their feet fast in stocks.
[1:09:21] You know, Brother Brham taught us
[1:09:22] something. He said Elijah was a a man of
[1:09:25] like passions as we uh Brother Brandham
[1:09:27] made the characters in the Bible real
[1:09:29] people with real problem. He showed us
[1:09:32] Elijah getting discouraged and running
[1:09:33] out to the juniper tree and running to
[1:09:35] the cave. He he showed us all of these
[1:09:37] things. But
[1:09:40] I don't know, this is just this is just
[1:09:42] me just thinking on human terms. I don't
[1:09:46] know that Paul and Silas when they first
[1:09:49] were thrown into the inner prison, backs
[1:09:51] bleeding, bruised, hurting, and they
[1:09:54] fastened their feet in stocks and they
[1:09:57] walked out.
[1:09:59] I don't believe they were giggling and
[1:10:01] telling jokes and all of a sudden super
[1:10:03] excited because I I I I love this
[1:10:06] terminology. It says at midnight Yeah.
[1:10:10] Paul and Silas pray. It It makes you
[1:10:12] think that there was a trans transpiring
[1:10:14] of some time.
[1:10:16] And maybe Paul and Silas had to get over
[1:10:19] the shock to the human system. Maybe. I
[1:10:22] don't I'm not saying it's that way. But
[1:10:25] if if they were of like passions as we
[1:10:27] are and we can put ourselves in that
[1:10:30] situation, I I can imagine they probably
[1:10:33] had to sort through some things in their
[1:10:34] mind. They probably had to come to terms
[1:10:37] with where they were and what was going
[1:10:39] on and and what had just happened to
[1:10:41] them and where they were now and what
[1:10:43] were the prospects for the future.
[1:10:46] What was going to happen next? How could
[1:10:48] you be a human being and not think about
[1:10:50] what was going to happen next and not
[1:10:52] reflect on what had just happened and
[1:10:53] not be hurting? Listen, they were
[1:10:55] hurting outside and inside because they
[1:10:57] were humanly offended. They were
[1:10:58] stripped naked, falsely accused and
[1:11:00] beaten. Listen, you can't go through
[1:11:02] that without being wounded in your
[1:11:03] spirit realm. And their body was
[1:11:06] wounded. But but something something
[1:11:08] happened with Paul and Silas. And the
[1:11:10] Bible doesn't give us the details, but
[1:11:12] I'll give you some details in my life.
[1:11:15] Amen. Sometimes you get shock and awe at
[1:11:17] circumstances in life and you get
[1:11:19] completely overwhelmed and smashed flat
[1:11:21] as a pancake and you don't know what's
[1:11:23] going to happen tomorrow, why this
[1:11:24] happened and where you're at and there's
[1:11:26] no feeling in your heart but despair and
[1:11:28] hopelessness and all is lost. Amen. But
[1:11:31] if you just meditate for a while and you
[1:11:33] just get quiet before God, all of a
[1:11:35] sudden a little flicker starts on the
[1:11:37] inside and something begins to happen
[1:11:39] and you have to remember, I'm still a
[1:11:41] son of God. Amen. I still have a father
[1:11:44] and my father watches over me. Every
[1:11:47] Bible in the every verse in the Bible is
[1:11:50] still the truth.
[1:11:52] I'm feeling miserable. I'm feeling
[1:11:54] horrible. I'm in despair. I'm I'm
[1:11:57] depressed or I'm upset or I'm offended
[1:12:00] or I'm agitated or I'm angry. It doesn't
[1:12:02] matter. You'll have all of those
[1:12:04] feelings. Amen. There's nothing wrong
[1:12:06] with having those feelings. What's wrong
[1:12:08] is speaking those feelings and making
[1:12:10] those your identification. We've got to
[1:12:12] go back to the revelation come by grace
[1:12:15] and say no matter what happens
[1:12:19] his grace is sufficient for me.
[1:12:22] No matter what happens I'm a son of God.
[1:12:26] I have a father. Spiritual amnesia is
[1:12:28] broken. See the the devil is trying
[1:12:30] through the circumstances to bring
[1:12:32] amnesia back. Because brother Ram said
[1:12:35] sometimes it comes from a shock or a
[1:12:36] blow. So he's trying to give you a shock
[1:12:38] or a blow to bring spiritual amnesia
[1:12:41] back. And you may suffer with temporary
[1:12:43] amnesia. Has anybody had temporary
[1:12:45] amnesia since you became a Christian?
[1:12:47] Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes it lasts a
[1:12:49] little longer than others. Amen. But but
[1:12:51] you get temporary amnesia and you start
[1:12:53] to say, "Everything's falling apart.
[1:12:55] Everything's lost. We're destroyed. Our
[1:12:57] life is over. Hey, we've lost
[1:13:01] then all of a sudden, if we could just
[1:13:04] get quiet
[1:13:06] and just reconnect with our father. And
[1:13:08] if we could just see our father again,
[1:13:12] we would realize everything's okay.
[1:13:16] Everything's okay.
[1:13:18] Brother Brandham tells a story. I just
[1:13:22] want to share this story with you
[1:13:23] because it really meant something to me.
[1:13:29] This is in the message the Messiah from
[1:13:31] 1961.
[1:13:33] He and he talks about it more than one
[1:13:35] place, but he talks about a family in
[1:13:37] Germany and the man was a chaplain in
[1:13:40] the in the army or the air force. I
[1:13:42] don't remember which one, but he was a
[1:13:43] chaplain over there in the military
[1:13:44] service and their baby got sick and was
[1:13:47] at the point of dying and they wanted
[1:13:49] brother Bham to come and pray for the
[1:13:51] baby and they were willing to fly him
[1:13:53] out and back in one day even getting a
[1:13:55] military plane. That's what he said. and
[1:13:58] and the baby died. But the mom and the
[1:14:03] dad refused to accept it. They even told
[1:14:05] the doctor. Brother Mam says the doctor
[1:14:06] had even they had even given the doctor
[1:14:08] a copy of of um Prophet Visit South
[1:14:12] Africa. And the doctor was willing to
[1:14:13] wait. The baby had died, but the doctor
[1:14:15] kept the oxygen on the baby because they
[1:14:18] said, "God's going to raise it up. God's
[1:14:20] going to raise up my baby. We believe
[1:14:21] and we're going to They're trying to get
[1:14:23] Brother Be." They called him multiple
[1:14:24] times. Brother said they called four or
[1:14:26] five times that day. And he said, "I
[1:14:28] went to pray that afternoon and that
[1:14:29] night." He said, "Finally, God says,"
[1:14:32] don't touch it. That's the hand of the
[1:14:34] Lord."
[1:14:36] So,
[1:14:38] you can imagine what these parents went
[1:14:40] through. Brother Beam called him back
[1:14:42] and said, "I can't come. He told me that
[1:14:45] this is his hand."
[1:14:47] And so, the baby was already dead. They
[1:14:50] had to turn the oxygen off. They had to
[1:14:52] bury the baby. They had to do all of
[1:14:54] those things. tell the doctor and they
[1:14:55] were so confident that God was going to
[1:14:57] raise their baby, that brother Random
[1:14:59] could come and God would raise their
[1:15:00] baby and it didn't happen according to
[1:15:03] their desire or what they thought.
[1:15:07] Then a little bit later, Brother Bam
[1:15:08] tells him the story. This woman comes to
[1:15:10] Brother Bam's house and they're
[1:15:11] fellowshipping and they're visiting
[1:15:13] later. This is sometime later after the
[1:15:15] baby dies after this whole set of
[1:15:17] circumstances
[1:15:18] and she said, the woman says, "What was
[1:15:20] it, Brother Brandham? my weakness of
[1:15:23] faith.
[1:15:25] She wants to know why when she was
[1:15:27] believing but the baby didn't die, was
[1:15:29] it my weakness of faith?
[1:15:31] And I tell you right now, every one of
[1:15:34] us would face that question if we went
[1:15:37] through the same circumstances. Every
[1:15:39] one of us would face that same question.
[1:15:42] Is this my fault? Is this because I
[1:15:44] didn't have enough faith? Is this
[1:15:46] because I didn't believe the word
[1:15:47] enough? And this is what brother Ben
[1:15:49] Brown says and this is what helped me so
[1:15:51] much. He said, I said, 'You have great
[1:15:54] faith.
[1:15:56] You prayed for your baby. You and your
[1:15:58] husband held on to it. God raised that
[1:16:01] baby and he refuse to do it because he
[1:16:04] knows what's best. And still you love
[1:16:07] him. That's real faith.
[1:16:12] I hope that helps you like it helped me
[1:16:15] because we've been through things like
[1:16:17] this in life. when you thought for sure
[1:16:19] God was going to answer, God was going
[1:16:21] to change. Amen. The the promise is
[1:16:23] true. The word says, "And by his stripes
[1:16:26] and we knew, we were holding on with
[1:16:28] faith. We were believing with everything
[1:16:29] in us. And then it doesn't happen the
[1:16:32] way we expect it to happen." Yes.
[1:16:35] And then this woman had a legitimate
[1:16:37] question for Brother Bam. Brother
[1:16:38] Brandham, was it the weakness of my
[1:16:40] faith? He said, "No, sister. You've got
[1:16:42] great faith. You and your husband have
[1:16:43] great faith because no matter what what
[1:16:46] you were claiming, what you were
[1:16:47] believing, what you were holding on to,
[1:16:50] God refused to do it because he had a
[1:16:52] better plan. But when God refused to do
[1:16:54] it and you buried that baby anyways, you
[1:16:56] kept loving God. That's real faith.
[1:17:01] Listen, all of us, I don't know. I don't
[1:17:04] know. I I personally don't know of any
[1:17:07] Christians
[1:17:09] who've come to the Lord and had every
[1:17:11] single prayer answered and can't say
[1:17:13] they can't say anywhere that they've
[1:17:15] ever been disappointed
[1:17:17] that it didn't go according I mean some
[1:17:19] people try to act like everything works
[1:17:22] out and I pray and God always but
[1:17:24] sometimes he says no
[1:17:27] sometimes he says no and he allows
[1:17:29] things to go in a way we never thought
[1:17:31] he would allow them to go and then we
[1:17:34] have to deal with those consequences es
[1:17:36] and that's when we realize that's when
[1:17:38] the test really comes. Do you love him
[1:17:40] or not?
[1:17:42] And this woman and her husband proved
[1:17:44] that they loved them. And this is what
[1:17:46] brother Am goes on to say. He said, "And
[1:17:49] still you love him." That's real faith.
[1:17:51] Anybody when mountains are moving and
[1:17:53] things can have faith, but let it go
[1:17:56] backwards one time and see how it works.
[1:17:59] That's when you prove whether you got
[1:18:01] faith or not. Right? That's when grace
[1:18:04] has to be sufficient for you. The grace
[1:18:08] of knowing who you are in God.
[1:18:13] Brother man, I'm going to go and read a
[1:18:15] section out of Simran Church Age from
[1:18:17] the Church Age book. And all of you know
[1:18:19] this really well because I've been
[1:18:21] through it several times. But it's the
[1:18:22] section in the in the SRAN church age
[1:18:24] where he says, "I know I know thy
[1:18:26] tribulation and I know thy suffering."
[1:18:28] And God knows his suffering. And I'm
[1:18:30] going to just highlight a few things. I
[1:18:32] won't read every word here, but just
[1:18:33] just hang with me and pay close
[1:18:35] attention. Uh, and I'm going to when
[1:18:38] brother Ram goes to a scripture, I'm
[1:18:39] going to go to that scripture. He says,
[1:18:41] "Now the Lord God always says, I know
[1:18:43] here he is walking in the midst of his
[1:18:45] people. There he is, the chief shepherd
[1:18:47] of the flock, but does he hold back the
[1:18:49] persecution? Does he stem the
[1:18:52] tribulation?" No, he does not. No, he
[1:18:56] simply says, "I know your tribulation.
[1:18:59] I'm not all at all unmindful of your
[1:19:02] suffering. What a stumbling block this
[1:19:04] is to so many people like Israel. They
[1:19:06] wonder if God really loves them. How can
[1:19:08] God be just and loving if he stands by
[1:19:11] and watches his people suffer? That's a
[1:19:14] good question.
[1:19:16] If you get the revelation that God is
[1:19:18] your father and you feel so secure that
[1:19:20] you have a father and you feel so safe
[1:19:22] and protected and secure that you have a
[1:19:24] father but then that father stands by
[1:19:27] and let you go through a trial or
[1:19:29] tribulation that feels like it's too
[1:19:30] much to handle. Amen. It's easy to
[1:19:33] question the love of a father.
[1:19:36] But it's his love that lets us go
[1:19:39] through it. It's his love that lets us.
[1:19:42] He knows what's in us and he knows what
[1:19:44] we're capable of and he knows the
[1:19:46] questions he has to answer in our heart
[1:19:47] and he knows the manifestation he wants
[1:19:49] to bring out of us and he knows what
[1:19:51] he's training us for. And his love
[1:19:54] doesn't prevent every trouble. His love
[1:19:56] will allow us to go through I say some,
[1:20:00] but maybe many trials and tribulations.
[1:20:04] He goes to Malachi and he shows that
[1:20:06] God's love is elective love by showing
[1:20:08] the difference between Jacob and Esau.
[1:20:10] That God's love is election. Then he
[1:20:13] goes on to say this. He may commit you
[1:20:16] to death as he did Paul. He may commit
[1:20:19] you to suffering as he did Job. It is
[1:20:22] his prerogative. He is sovereign. But it
[1:20:25] all it is all with a purpose. If he did
[1:20:27] not have a purpose, then he would be the
[1:20:29] author of frustration and not of peace.
[1:20:31] His purpose is that after we have
[1:20:33] suffered a while, we would be made
[1:20:35] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[1:20:37] and settled. As Job said, he put
[1:20:39] strength in us. You see, he himself
[1:20:42] suffered. He learned obedience by the
[1:20:44] things that he suffered. He was actually
[1:20:46] made perfect by the things that he
[1:20:48] suffered. And he's speaking of Jesus
[1:20:50] Christ here in flesh. He grew and
[1:20:52] increased in knowledge and stature with
[1:20:54] God and with man. That he did so through
[1:20:56] suffering. And this is the scripture
[1:20:58] that he goes to next. Though he were a
[1:21:00] son, yet learned the obedience by the
[1:21:02] things which he suffered. And being made
[1:21:04] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[1:21:06] salvation unto all them that obey him.
[1:21:11] Amen. I want to read it up here. I just
[1:21:14] read what brother said. I added a little
[1:21:15] more up here. He goes on and says, "And
[1:21:17] being made perfect, he became the author
[1:21:20] of eternal salvation to all that know."
[1:21:21] Okay, I had it on there. So, so Jesus
[1:21:25] set an example for us. Jesus Christ was
[1:21:28] God made in flesh and he couldn't bypass
[1:21:30] suffering.
[1:21:32] So we can't bypass suffering. So if we
[1:21:36] can't bypass suffering, I think we need
[1:21:38] to learn how to embrace suffering and
[1:21:40] get the maximum benefit out of it.
[1:21:43] Because I think that's what the Bible's
[1:21:44] teaching us.
[1:21:46] Brother says in plain language, the very
[1:21:49] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:21:51] suffering. I want to say that again. Who
[1:21:54] are we talking about? God gone in flesh.
[1:21:56] We're talking about Jesus Christ. And
[1:21:57] listen to what he said. The very
[1:21:59] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:22:01] suffering.
[1:22:04] I'm going to read it again because I
[1:22:07] don't think it really hits us who he's
[1:22:10] talking about. He's talking about Jesus
[1:22:11] Christ, sinless son of God. Amen. Virgin
[1:22:15] born. Amen. But he says in very in plain
[1:22:18] language, the character of Jesus was
[1:22:19] perfected by suffering.
[1:22:22] And according to Paul, he has left his
[1:22:24] church a measure of suffering and that
[1:22:26] they too by their faith in God while
[1:22:28] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:22:31] of perfection. Why did he want this?
[1:22:33] Then he goes to James 1. We read this in
[1:22:35] our opening scripture. My brethren,
[1:22:37] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:22:39] divers diverse temptations, knowing this
[1:22:41] that the trying of your faith workketh
[1:22:42] as patience. And let patience have her
[1:22:44] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:22:47] entire wanting nothing.
[1:22:50] What does he Why does he stand by? The
[1:22:53] reason is in Romans 8:17 to18. So I'm
[1:22:56] going to put that up. Oh no, I got one
[1:22:57] more scripture. In Hebrews 2, he says,
[1:22:59] "For it became him for whom are all
[1:23:01] things and by whom are all things and
[1:23:03] bringing many sons into glory to make
[1:23:05] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:23:07] through suffering." Who's the captain of
[1:23:09] your salvation? Jesus Christ. How is he
[1:23:11] made perfect through suffering?
[1:23:14] If he, sinless, virgin born had to be
[1:23:17] made perfect through suffering. What
[1:23:19] about us who came in a certain c cursed
[1:23:21] body? Amen. How what what's going to
[1:23:23] bring us to perfection? What is going to
[1:23:24] bring us to completion? What will bring
[1:23:25] us to adoption? It you there can be no
[1:23:28] other mechanism that will produce it
[1:23:31] than the same one that produced it in
[1:23:32] the sinless virgin-born son of God. All
[1:23:35] the sons of God are going to have to
[1:23:37] come through suffering.
[1:23:40] So that's why James says, "Count it all
[1:23:42] joy." Amen. Oh God, help us to count it
[1:23:45] all joy. Let us look beyond the trial to
[1:23:48] the goal. Let us look to the
[1:23:49] destination. Let us keep our eyes lifted
[1:23:52] above the circumstances in life because
[1:23:54] that's what the slave had to do. He had
[1:23:57] his eyes focused across the sea back to
[1:23:59] who his father was and where he came
[1:24:01] from. We've got to get our eyes focused
[1:24:03] outside of this dimension and outside of
[1:24:05] this realm into the realm, the reality.
[1:24:08] This is the vapor. This is the mist.
[1:24:10] This is the shadow. This is the
[1:24:12] negative. That's everything. That's the
[1:24:14] reality. And we've got to live for the
[1:24:16] reality, not for the shadow. Live for
[1:24:18] the perfection, not for this
[1:24:20] imperfection.
[1:24:22] And we could focus on that. Amen. Then
[1:24:25] maybe we can start counting it all joy.
[1:24:27] Maybe then our trials can be more
[1:24:29] precious than gold. Maybe then we could
[1:24:31] start to view circumstances the way the
[1:24:34] Bible teaches us to view circumstances.
[1:24:39] Amen.
[1:24:40] So then he comes and he says, "Why does
[1:24:43] he stand by?" That's the question. Why
[1:24:46] does he just listen? How many of you
[1:24:48] have ever prayed a prayer and said,
[1:24:50] "God, in a fraction of a second, you
[1:24:52] could change this whole thing. God, with
[1:24:55] the tip of your finger, with a nod, with
[1:24:57] a look, with a thought, you can change.
[1:25:00] Why aren't you doing it?"
[1:25:03] I I hope I'm not been the only one who's
[1:25:05] been there. totally desperate,
[1:25:08] agonizing, needing an answer immediately
[1:25:11] and getting nothing.
[1:25:14] And brother says, why does he stand by?
[1:25:17] The reason is in Romans 8.
[1:25:20] The spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:25:22] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:25:24] God. And if children, then hes of God
[1:25:28] and joints with Christ. If so be that we
[1:25:32] suffer with him,
[1:25:34] that we may be also glorified together.
[1:25:37] For I reckon the sufferings of this
[1:25:39] present time are not worthy to be
[1:25:40] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:25:42] revealed in us.
[1:25:45] Why does he stand by? Brother Bam said
[1:25:47] because of the scripture. Amen. Because
[1:25:50] we are joint hes with Christ. If so be
[1:25:54] we suffer with him. This is why we
[1:25:57] should embrace suffering. Amen. Because
[1:26:00] suffering has a destination and it
[1:26:04] brings us to a destination. Amen. With
[1:26:07] God, suffering is never pointless.
[1:26:10] Never aimless, never without a purpose.
[1:26:13] It's never It's never for torture, never
[1:26:16] for pain. It's always for a purpose.
[1:26:21] In 2 Timothy 2, he says, "It is a
[1:26:23] faithful saying for we for if we be dead
[1:26:27] with him, we shall also live with him.
[1:26:30] If we suffer, we shall also reign with
[1:26:32] him. If we deny him, he also will deny
[1:26:36] us." So, who wants to reign with him?
[1:26:39] Who wants to believe be in the
[1:26:40] millennial reign and share even his
[1:26:41] throne? Okay.
[1:26:45] Did you raise your hand? I hope I hope
[1:26:47] Franco got a still shot because next
[1:26:50] time you call complaining. I'm going to
[1:26:51] circle the still shot. Remind you the
[1:26:53] question. Send it back and said you
[1:26:55] wanted to reign with him. So if we
[1:26:58] suffer, we shall also reign. Amen. If we
[1:27:01] suffer, we shall also reign with him.
[1:27:04] What's the path to the throne? The path
[1:27:06] to the throne is through suffering.
[1:27:09] Trials, tribulations, testing. Amen.
[1:27:12] Because it brings growth to us. it
[1:27:14] manifest what's on the inside. Amen. It
[1:27:17] requires a revelation of who we are to
[1:27:19] pass through. And this is the path.
[1:27:21] Amen. This is God's goal for us. Brother
[1:27:23] Ram said, "Why does he stand by?" This
[1:27:25] is the reason he stands by. He stands by
[1:27:27] because if he doesn't allow you to
[1:27:29] suffer, you can't reign with him. Amen.
[1:27:37] He says, "If we suffer with him, back in
[1:27:39] Romans, we may also be glorified
[1:27:41] together with him." So when we're
[1:27:43] suffering through something in life and
[1:27:45] we feel it's unfair and we can't take it
[1:27:48] no more and it's more than we can bear
[1:27:49] and it and it's not just and it's not
[1:27:51] fair and all of these things that we
[1:27:53] feel because those are the things that
[1:27:55] we feel. I mean we don't want to become
[1:27:56] super pious and religious and say we
[1:27:58] don't feel that way. That's exactly how
[1:28:00] you feel. You feel you feel forsaken.
[1:28:04] You feel forgotten. You feel unfairly
[1:28:06] treated. You feel like everything's
[1:28:08] happening to you and nobody else. Amen.
[1:28:11] That's human. Amen. But we got to go
[1:28:13] beyond human. Amen. We got to go to the
[1:28:15] mind of Christ, which is his word. And
[1:28:17] we got to look at the word and say, "The
[1:28:18] word tells the truth. My brain is
[1:28:20] telling me a lie. Amen. My emotions are
[1:28:23] lying, but the word is true."
[1:28:26] So if we suffer, we shall also reign
[1:28:28] with him. I think this is why we should
[1:28:31] embrace suffering because suffering is
[1:28:33] the path to the throne.
[1:28:36] Brother goes on. I'm I'm going to finish
[1:28:38] what he says here.
[1:28:41] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:28:44] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:28:48] reign.
[1:28:50] Is that plain?
[1:28:52] Okay, that is pretty plain, friends. And
[1:28:56] you know what we spend all of our time
[1:28:58] doing? Trying to bypass suffering.
[1:29:02] Hey, hey, listen. I'm the guiltiest of
[1:29:04] the guilty. But if something looks like
[1:29:06] it's going to be painful, I find every
[1:29:08] way in the world to bypass it. Amen. If
[1:29:11] a circumstance will be painful of a
[1:29:12] situation, if I see something in the
[1:29:14] future, I will try any way to avoid it.
[1:29:18] Amen. To try to get away from the pain
[1:29:20] of suffering. Amen. And I've got a good
[1:29:23] father who won't let me dodge it
[1:29:25] forever. Amen. He's a good father. But
[1:29:28] he says, unless we suffer with him,
[1:29:30] we're still in the church ages book and
[1:29:32] the Smyrna church age. Unless we suffer
[1:29:34] with him, we cannot reign with him. You
[1:29:37] have to suffer to reign.
[1:29:40] So when God allows trials and
[1:29:42] temptations, tribulation, suffering,
[1:29:45] it's really one of the nicest things
[1:29:47] he's ever done for us.
[1:29:50] It doesn't feel that way, but that's why
[1:29:53] we can't rely on feelings. Amen. We've
[1:29:56] got to go back to Revelation.
[1:29:59] Then he goes on to say, "The reason for
[1:30:01] this is that character simply is never
[1:30:03] made without suffering. Character is a
[1:30:06] victory, not a gift. A man without
[1:30:08] character can't reign because power
[1:30:10] apart from character is satanic. So you
[1:30:13] cannot go to the millennial throne
[1:30:15] without character. You cannot get
[1:30:17] character by impartation of a gift. You
[1:30:20] can only get character by having victory
[1:30:22] over the circumstances in life." Amen.
[1:30:24] So God has to allow circumstances in
[1:30:27] life so that you can get victory, so
[1:30:29] that you can have character, so that you
[1:30:31] can rule and reign with Christ for a
[1:30:32] thousand years. It's your position. It's
[1:30:34] where you're predestinated to be. But in
[1:30:37] order to be there, the Father and his
[1:30:39] infinite knowledge knows that you're
[1:30:41] going to need something when you get
[1:30:42] there that you can get here. And he's
[1:30:44] not going to let you bypass. He's going
[1:30:46] to make sure you get here what you need
[1:30:47] there. And what you get here is the path
[1:30:50] to get there. Amen.
[1:30:52] And I got a feeling once we get there,
[1:30:54] we'll be thankful for everything that
[1:30:56] ever happened in our life. So let's
[1:30:58] start looking there and stop looking
[1:30:59] here. Amen. And start getting satisfied
[1:31:02] with what God is doing in our lives.
[1:31:05] Help us, God. Please help us.
[1:31:08] He says, "Now power apart from character
[1:31:11] is satanic, but power with character is
[1:31:13] fit to rule. And since he wants us to
[1:31:15] share even his throne on the same basis
[1:31:17] that he overcame and is sat down in the
[1:31:19] father's throne, then we have to
[1:31:21] overcome to sit with him. And the little
[1:31:24] temporary sufferings we go through now
[1:31:31] little temporary. You know what brother
[1:31:33] Bam's doing? He's putting life in
[1:31:35] perspective.
[1:31:37] Because when you're going through it, it
[1:31:39] does not feel like a little temporary
[1:31:41] suffering. And I I've thought too, why
[1:31:45] is every trial the worst?
[1:31:49] I mean, I've had trials in the past, but
[1:31:51] this is the worst. And there's sometimes
[1:31:53] I'd be like, I'll go back to the one
[1:31:55] that I thought was the worst 10 years
[1:31:57] ago. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Why is
[1:32:00] it the worst? Because we have to
[1:32:02] understand God is building character in
[1:32:04] us. So, he always has to test us to our
[1:32:08] new level of character to bring us to
[1:32:10] another level of character. He can't
[1:32:12] take us back where we were. Listen, you
[1:32:14] don't come to the 10th grade and start
[1:32:16] doing fifth grade math again just so you
[1:32:18] can feel good about yourself for passing
[1:32:19] tests. That's pointless. Amen. And and
[1:32:22] the same thing with God. It's pointless
[1:32:24] to do that. He's always taking us to our
[1:32:26] max because what is he doing? He's
[1:32:28] making us fit to rule with him for a
[1:32:30] thousand years. He's got a predestinated
[1:32:32] place for us at the throne of God, on
[1:32:35] the throne of God. We have to fill that
[1:32:37] position. And in order to fill the
[1:32:38] position, we've got to get the character
[1:32:40] now. And to get that character, we've
[1:32:42] got to be growing
[1:32:45] the same way Jesus grew in his earthly
[1:32:49] life according to the word.
[1:32:53] If he went to his throne through
[1:32:54] suffering, how are we going to go share
[1:32:56] his throne without the same mechanism?
[1:33:00] Now he says,
[1:33:02] and the little temporary sufferings,
[1:33:06] you know what? I I should just use that
[1:33:08] line in counseling
[1:33:11] when somebody's sitting across from me
[1:33:13] and weeping because life is falling
[1:33:16] apart and nothing's working out right
[1:33:17] and I should say now this little
[1:33:19] temporary suffering.
[1:33:22] I can just imagine the scowlling look
[1:33:24] like you don't understand.
[1:33:28] But maybe we do understand. Maybe
[1:33:31] somebody outside standing to the side
[1:33:32] can understand this is for the glory of
[1:33:35] God. This is for your good. God allowed
[1:33:37] it, so it's right. God's permitting it
[1:33:39] to continue, so it's beneficial.
[1:33:42] So this little suffering we go through
[1:33:44] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:33:46] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:33:48] in us when he comes. Oh, what treasures
[1:33:51] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:33:55] enter his kingdom through much
[1:33:56] tribulation.
[1:33:58] Are you willing? Amen. I'm willing. Why
[1:34:01] am I willing? Because by revelation, I
[1:34:03] believe that's my position.
[1:34:07] Oh, praise God.
[1:34:09] I don't even know where I'm going next.
[1:34:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:14] Amen. Here again in the Smyrnan church
[1:34:16] age book, he says, "Think it not strange
[1:34:18] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:34:20] try you." That is what Peter said. Is is
[1:34:24] it strange that God wants us to develop
[1:34:26] a Christlike character that comes
[1:34:28] through suffering? I love the way
[1:34:29] Brother B asked these questions. If you
[1:34:31] just stand them alone, they're
[1:34:32] hilarious.
[1:34:35] Is it strange that God wants us to
[1:34:38] develop Christlike character that comes
[1:34:39] through suffer? Well, obviously the
[1:34:41] answer is no. But when you're in the
[1:34:43] midst of it, the answer doesn't feel
[1:34:44] like no. That's right. Yeah. I mean,
[1:34:48] somebody's having the worst day of their
[1:34:49] life and you say, "Listen, this isn't
[1:34:51] strange. This is okay." Yeah. Is it
[1:34:55] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:34:58] Christlike character that comes through
[1:34:59] suffering? No sir. And we all have
[1:35:01] trials. We all are tried and chasened as
[1:35:04] sons. Not one that goes through that.
[1:35:06] Not one that goes that goes through
[1:35:08] that. The church that is not suffering
[1:35:11] and is not being tried hasn't got it.
[1:35:13] Isn't it of God? Hebrews 12:6. For whom
[1:35:16] the Lord loveth, he chastenneth and
[1:35:18] scorgth every son whom he receiveth. But
[1:35:21] if you be without chastisement whereof
[1:35:23] of all our partakers, then you are
[1:35:24] bastards and not sons. Look at the part
[1:35:26] that I made bold.
[1:35:29] The Lord whom he beloved chasteneth and
[1:35:31] scourgeeth every son whom he receiveth.
[1:35:34] So if God chastens and scourges you,
[1:35:37] you're a son. Amen. Praise God. I'm a
[1:35:40] son and I'm suffering because I've got a
[1:35:42] place on the throne. And I'm being I'm
[1:35:44] being tried and tested because God wants
[1:35:46] my outcome to be perfect because he's
[1:35:48] got a place for me to fulfill. And he's
[1:35:51] he's scoring me. He won't let me get
[1:35:53] away with anything. Why? Because he
[1:35:55] loves me. Amen. because I'm a son. How
[1:35:59] many times has the devil tried to
[1:36:00] convince us that trials, testings,
[1:36:03] scorgings are because we're not a son?
[1:36:05] But the Bible tells us that every son.
[1:36:09] These come because you are a son, not
[1:36:12] because you're not a son.
[1:36:15] But the devil gets in the circumstance
[1:36:16] and gets in your ear and says, "Listen,
[1:36:18] nothing's working out for you. And
[1:36:20] listen, everything's going wrong and all
[1:36:22] these things are happening to you. Maybe
[1:36:23] you're not a son of God. Maybe you just
[1:36:25] thought you were. Maybe you're just
[1:36:27] deceived. Blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:36:29] blah. And you can look back at him and
[1:36:30] say, "This is happening because I am a
[1:36:33] son. Because he knows who I am, and he
[1:36:36] knows where I'm going. I know where I
[1:36:38] came from. And all things work together
[1:36:40] for good to them who love God and are
[1:36:42] the called according to his purpose."
[1:36:44] We've got to defeat lies with the truth.
[1:36:46] We got to fight back, not with more
[1:36:47] thoughts. When that thought comes, don't
[1:36:49] go back and try to think of all the good
[1:36:51] things you've ever done to prove that
[1:36:52] you're a son of God. go right back to
[1:36:54] the word. Amen.
[1:36:57] That's right.
[1:36:59] Every son whom he receiveth.
[1:37:01] But if you be without chastisement,
[1:37:03] we're of all our partakers. Then you are
[1:37:04] bastards and not sons.
[1:37:07] We should like chastisement.
[1:37:10] Right? Like I mean I don't mean the
[1:37:12] outside man. He shouldn't like it. But
[1:37:15] the inside man. Amen. Now this special
[1:37:19] condition in Smyrna must be applied to
[1:37:22] every age. There is no age free from it.
[1:37:25] There is no true believer free from it.
[1:37:28] This is of God. This is the will of God.
[1:37:30] It is needful. We need the Lord to teach
[1:37:33] us the truth that we are to suffer and
[1:37:36] to be Christlike in doing it.
[1:37:39] We I agree with what brother Brandham
[1:37:41] said. We need the Lord to teach us.
[1:37:43] Yeah. Amen. We need the Lord to teach
[1:37:46] us. I want to go through a few
[1:37:48] scriptures
[1:37:50] along these lines. Hebrews 12, for whom
[1:37:53] the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and
[1:37:55] scorgth every son. Oh, this is the one
[1:37:56] we just read. Uh,
[1:38:01] Philippians 1, for unto you it is given
[1:38:04] to in the behalf of Christ, not only to
[1:38:07] believe on him, but also to suffer for
[1:38:09] his sake.
[1:38:11] So our job is not just to believe
[1:38:14] but to suffer. For unto you it is given
[1:38:17] in the behalf of Christ not only to
[1:38:19] believe on him but also to suffer for
[1:38:22] his sake. So we're we're here for more
[1:38:25] than just to believe on him. We're here
[1:38:27] to suffer for his sake as well.
[1:38:31] First Peter 4
[1:38:34] one. For as much then as Christ has
[1:38:36] suffered for us in the flesh, arm
[1:38:38] yourselves likewise with the same mind.
[1:38:40] For he that hath suffered in the flesh
[1:38:42] has ceased from sin, that he no longer
[1:38:44] should live the rest of his time in the
[1:38:46] flesh to the lust of men, but to the
[1:38:48] will of God.
[1:38:50] Amen. Some of our suffering I want I
[1:38:53] just want to as I wind down, I want to
[1:38:55] wrap up with another thought. Some of
[1:38:58] our suffering is not just negative
[1:39:01] circumstances in life. So, we've got
[1:39:03] levels of suffering for Christ's sake.
[1:39:06] You've got uh not levels, I shouldn't
[1:39:09] say, but different ways in which we
[1:39:10] suffer. Some of that is by persecution
[1:39:13] where you're actually persecuted for
[1:39:14] what you believe for standing with the
[1:39:16] word and somebody will mock you or
[1:39:18] reject you or say you're wrong or fight
[1:39:20] against you, kick you out of a church or
[1:39:22] whatever, dysfellowship you because of
[1:39:25] your standard of the word. That is one
[1:39:27] level of of suffering. Right? There's
[1:39:30] another level of suffering that comes
[1:39:32] through testings that God allows in our
[1:39:34] life. Sickness and trials and
[1:39:36] temptations and hardship and
[1:39:38] difficulties and all that's a whole
[1:39:40] another level of suffering. And all of
[1:39:43] these work the same end. Amen. They're
[1:39:45] all useful in in building our character,
[1:39:48] helping us to overcome and positionally
[1:39:51] placing us where we go, bringing us to
[1:39:52] adoption and positionally placing us on
[1:39:54] the throne of God. They're all good. But
[1:39:57] there's another level of suffering for
[1:39:59] his name's sake that I just want to
[1:40:01] share with you because I I've been
[1:40:03] meditating on it and it's a powerful
[1:40:04] level of suffering.
[1:40:08] And this level of suffering is
[1:40:10] self-denial for the sake of the word.
[1:40:14] It has nothing to do with outside
[1:40:16] forces, outside circumstances, outside
[1:40:19] people.
[1:40:21] But this has everything to do with you
[1:40:24] and your flesh choosing the word over
[1:40:27] the desires of the flesh. Amen. And you
[1:40:32] may say, "Well, well, that's not
[1:40:33] suffering." Listen, wrestling with
[1:40:36] yourself
[1:40:37] can be suffering.
[1:40:39] Telling your flesh, "No, just go do it
[1:40:42] sometime." Yeah. Decide you're going to
[1:40:44] fast for a day and tell me whether you
[1:40:48] suffer or not. Just say, "I'm going to
[1:40:50] fast. I'm going to need a prayer and
[1:40:51] fast." And tell me if your body doesn't
[1:40:53] rebel.
[1:40:54] And your body, your stomach will be
[1:40:56] there hammering on the inside. I'm
[1:40:58] hungry. I want food. Feed me. Feed me.
[1:41:00] Feed. And you're praying and all you can
[1:41:01] think is food. Food. Cheeseburgers.
[1:41:03] French fries.
[1:41:06] Sounds funny, but your flesh is
[1:41:07] rebellious.
[1:41:09] Rebellious to the word of God. Doesn't
[1:41:11] submit to the word. It's something on
[1:41:13] the inside that wants something more
[1:41:15] from God, something deeper, and want to
[1:41:17] go a deeper way. But your flesh wants
[1:41:19] the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
[1:41:20] eyes, the pride of life. It wants the
[1:41:22] things of the world. It wants to satisfy
[1:41:24] itself. And you go try to deny that. And
[1:41:26] when you go to deny that, it comes in
[1:41:28] rebellion. And there can be actual
[1:41:30] suffering in this war you have with
[1:41:32] yourself. Amen.
[1:41:38] You know, there's there's individuals we
[1:41:40] know there's there's people because of
[1:41:43] the word of God in their marriage
[1:41:45] situation, they've had to remain single
[1:41:47] all of their life. They got in a bad
[1:41:50] situation. They had something happen to
[1:41:51] them, something they didn't want, a bad
[1:41:53] choice that they made. And you you don't
[1:41:57] believe for a moment that that
[1:41:59] loneliness is not suffering. And don't
[1:42:02] believe for a moment that somebody who
[1:42:04] is stuck in a divorce condition or had
[1:42:06] an engagement that that ended or or a
[1:42:08] situation where they're they're not free
[1:42:10] to marry and they've had to live years
[1:42:12] and years alone. Don't think that
[1:42:13] loneliness is not suffering. And don't
[1:42:18] think that there's not a temptation to
[1:42:19] find a loophole or make an excuse or a
[1:42:22] reason that I can be married because the
[1:42:24] body's screaming and crying for
[1:42:25] affection, for companionship. The spirit
[1:42:28] wants the the human spirit wants
[1:42:31] companionship and love like anybody
[1:42:33] else. But those who choose to put the
[1:42:35] word first, they're suffering for his
[1:42:38] name's sake because that's his word.
[1:42:40] That's what he wants. That's his life.
[1:42:42] And I'm not going to bring a reproach
[1:42:43] against my father, but I'm here. Amen.
[1:42:45] I'm I'm a slave to this condition, but I
[1:42:48] want to act like my father.
[1:42:52] Christ wrestled with his own flesh.
[1:42:55] Is that right?
[1:42:57] He had to wrestle in the subjection.
[1:43:00] Brother Bham said that that the
[1:43:02] wrestling in Gethsemane, he was
[1:43:04] wrestling over a choice. Would he take
[1:43:06] the sins of the world or would he stay
[1:43:07] with his disciples? What he wanted to
[1:43:10] do? Yeah. The Bible also says Jesus in
[1:43:13] prayer, he says, "Father, I sanctified
[1:43:15] myself for their sakes." Brother Rem
[1:43:17] said he could have had a family. He
[1:43:19] could have done this or that. Amen. And
[1:43:21] not been not been wrong in it because he
[1:43:23] was a human being. He said, "But he he
[1:43:25] was able to sanctify himself for their
[1:43:27] sakes." And don't think that Jesus did
[1:43:29] not have to give up. Did not have to
[1:43:32] wrestle with his own flesh. He had to
[1:43:34] wrestle with his own flesh, with his own
[1:43:35] human desire. And if he had to, we have
[1:43:38] to. And there's a certain measure of
[1:43:40] suffering for his name's sake. It is
[1:43:42] suffering to stay with the word when
[1:43:44] everything in your body or emotions want
[1:43:45] you to go outside his word. It's not
[1:43:48] necessarily persecution from somebody.
[1:43:50] It's not necessarily sickness or
[1:43:51] financial strength. It's a war that's
[1:43:53] going on inside where you rise up and
[1:43:55] say, "I'm not going to give into the
[1:43:57] flesh. I'm going to stay with the word."
[1:43:59] Amen. Why? Because I know where I came
[1:44:02] from and I know where I'm going. And
[1:44:04] there's something far better than what
[1:44:06] this temporary
[1:44:08] suffering.
[1:44:11] These are all ways in which we suffer
[1:44:13] for his name's sake. We see in the
[1:44:16] apostles, they claim Jesus Christ. They
[1:44:18] claimed the resurrection. They were
[1:44:19] stoned to death. They suffered for his
[1:44:21] name's sake. When you take the word over
[1:44:23] culture, when you take the word over
[1:44:24] your flesh, when you stay with the word
[1:44:26] no matter what, you're also suffering
[1:44:28] for his name's sake.
[1:44:31] You're also putting him first.
[1:44:34] Hebrews 11 tells us by faith Moses when
[1:44:38] he was come to years refused to be
[1:44:39] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:44:41] choosing rather to suffer the
[1:44:42] afflictions with the people of God than
[1:44:45] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:44:47] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:44:50] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:44:52] Egypt for he had respect and the
[1:44:55] recompense of the reward.
[1:44:58] He left comfort. He left ease. He left
[1:45:02] it all to bear the reproach of Christ.
[1:45:06] In Hebrews 13 says to us, "Wherefore
[1:45:09] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[1:45:11] people with his own blood suffered
[1:45:12] without the gate. Let us go forth
[1:45:15] therefore unto him without the camp
[1:45:18] bearing his reproach."
[1:45:20] That's what the disciples were able to
[1:45:21] do. They were able to leave the old
[1:45:24] Jewish traditions of the fathers and
[1:45:26] bear his reproach outside the camp.
[1:45:28] That's what many of you were able to do
[1:45:30] when you left the denomination you were
[1:45:32] raised in and left the traditions that
[1:45:33] you had to come to the message. But oh,
[1:45:37] let's keep going outside the camp. Amen.
[1:45:40] Let's keep going outside the camp.
[1:45:43] Amen. In first Peter 4, this is the one
[1:45:46] that brother referred to several times.
[1:45:48] He said, "Beloved, think it not strange
[1:45:50] concerning the fire trial which is to
[1:45:52] try you as though some strange thing
[1:45:54] happened unto you. But rejoice in so
[1:45:57] much that you are partakers of Christ's
[1:45:59] sufferings, that when his glory shall be
[1:46:01] revealed, you may be glad also with
[1:46:03] exceeding joy. If you be reproached for
[1:46:06] the name of Christ, happy are ye. For
[1:46:09] the spirit of the glory, for the spirit
[1:46:11] of glory and of God resteth upon you. On
[1:46:14] your part he is evil spoken of, but on
[1:46:17] your part he is glorified. But let none
[1:46:19] of you suffer as a murderer, as a thief,
[1:46:21] or as an evildoer, as a busy body in
[1:46:23] other men's matters. Yet if any man
[1:46:25] suffers a Christian, let him not be
[1:46:27] ashamed, but let him glorify God on this
[1:46:30] behalf. Think it not strange concerning
[1:46:33] the trials. And if you are reproached
[1:46:36] for the name of Christ, happy are ye.
[1:46:39] Let that be true.
[1:46:42] And I want to conclude with this if the
[1:46:44] musicians want to come. John 16:33.
[1:46:48] These things I have spoken unto you that
[1:46:50] in me you might have peace. In the world
[1:46:53] you shall have tribulation, but be of
[1:46:56] good cheer. I have overcome the world.
[1:47:00] Let's all stand together.
[1:47:03] This is the victory that overcometh the
[1:47:06] world, even our faith. And how do we
[1:47:09] have faith? By grace. And his grace is
[1:47:13] sufficient for us. Amen. There's there's
[1:47:17] many things that come our way and
[1:47:19] difficulties,
[1:47:20] but the Bible is clear.
[1:47:23] Our response should be count it all joy,
[1:47:27] rejoice,
[1:47:29] be happy,
[1:47:32] and be of good cheer.
[1:47:35] I want to go over that again. Can we go
[1:47:37] over it again? It's fun. The reason it's
[1:47:40] fun is it's so contrary to the human
[1:47:43] nature we're born with. It's fun to put
[1:47:45] this flesh back in its place. It's fun
[1:47:47] to take dominion over the mind, to take
[1:47:49] dominion over the emotions, and say,
[1:47:51] "Listen, I'm not going to be controlled
[1:47:53] by this emotional realm anymore because
[1:47:54] I've been given the mind of Christ,
[1:47:56] which is the word of God." Amen. And so
[1:48:00] now, no matter what happens to me, God
[1:48:02] help me. Listen, if we get into the
[1:48:05] practical reality of exercising this, I
[1:48:07] think it's going to be a bit like Paul
[1:48:09] and Silas. You you you may get falsely
[1:48:12] accused, knocked down, beat, locked in
[1:48:14] stocks, and fastened in the inner
[1:48:16] prison. And it may not be the first five
[1:48:18] minutes you start singing, but oh, just
[1:48:20] let the revelation keep coming and let
[1:48:23] truth keep filtering in and keep
[1:48:25] dispelling the lie with the word. And
[1:48:27] maybe after a while, maybe after an
[1:48:29] hour, maybe after two hours, all of a
[1:48:31] sudden, you start saying, "God is good
[1:48:34] all the time."
[1:48:36] Amen. Amen. Locked in stocks in the
[1:48:40] inner prison being beaten and stripped
[1:48:41] naked. God is good. Amen. All the time.
[1:48:46] Put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:48:50] mine. Let's sing this. Do you know the
[1:48:52] song? Let's sing this together. Listen,
[1:48:54] we don't have to be dreary and beat
[1:48:56] down. Hey, we get down. Absolutely. We
[1:48:59] go. We're like passions as Elijah and
[1:49:01] Elijah this day. We saw brother Brandham
[1:49:03] get down. We saw him get discouraged. We
[1:49:05] saw all of that. But you saw him always
[1:49:08] bounce back and come to the truth. He
[1:49:10] always saw the truth prevail over his
[1:49:12] emotions. You always He got down. Yeah.
[1:49:14] You get down. Yeah. But let the truth
[1:49:16] bring you back. Let this grace be
[1:49:18] sufficient for you. Amen. Get to the
[1:49:20] place where we just start weighing out
[1:49:22] what's going on and saying, "Listen, I'm
[1:49:24] in a little bit of shell shock right
[1:49:25] now. I'm overwhelmed by what just
[1:49:28] happened to me. I got blindsided by
[1:49:30] something I never saw coming." And then
[1:49:32] just start remembering, Amen. Who I who
[1:49:35] I belong to?
[1:49:37] Whose blood purchased me? Whose son am
[1:49:41] I? Where did I come from? Where am I
[1:49:44] going? And what is God trying to do with
[1:49:46] me now? And then all of a sudden, you
[1:49:48] say, "It's all good because all things
[1:49:51] work together for good to them who love
[1:49:53] God and are thee called according to his
[1:49:55] purpose." And that scripture always
[1:49:57] works and always applies.
[1:50:01] That's what we need. Oh, let's just sing
[1:50:03] the song together. Brother John, if
[1:50:04] you'll help me.
[1:50:06] God is good
[1:50:09] all the time.
[1:50:12] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:50:17] mine. God is good
[1:50:20] all the time.
[1:50:23] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:50:27] will shine. God is good.
[1:50:31] God is good
[1:50:33] all the time.
[1:50:37] And if you're walking
[1:50:40] through the valley,
[1:50:43] there are shadows all around.
[1:50:48] Oh, do not fear.
[1:50:51] He will guide you. He will keep you safe
[1:50:56] and sound.
[1:50:58] For he has promised
[1:51:01] you never leave you or forsake you. And
[1:51:07] his word is true. God is good
[1:51:12] all the time.
[1:51:14] He wrote a song of praise. In this heart
[1:51:18] of mine, God is good
[1:51:22] all the time.
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] darkest night, his light will shine. God
[1:51:30] is good.
[1:51:32] Oh, God is good
[1:51:35] all the time.
[1:51:39] And we were sinners
[1:51:41] so unworthy.
[1:51:44] And for us, he chose to die.
[1:51:49] He filled us with his holy spirit.
[1:51:54] Now we can stand and testify
[1:52:00] that his love
[1:52:02] is everlasting.
[1:52:04] Oh, and his mercy
[1:52:07] they will never end. God is good
[1:52:13] all the time.
[1:52:15] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:52:20] mine. God is good
[1:52:23] all the time.
[1:52:25] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:52:29] will shine. God is good.
[1:52:33] God is good
[1:52:35] all the time.
[1:52:39] And though I may not understand
[1:52:45] all the love you have for me,
[1:52:50] but my life is in your hands.
[1:52:55] And through the eyes of faith, I can
[1:52:59] clearly see
[1:53:02] that God is good
[1:53:05] all the time.
[1:53:08] A song of praise in this heart of mine.
[1:53:12] God is good
[1:53:15] all the time.
[1:53:17] He put a darkness.
[1:53:20] His light will shine. God is good.
[1:53:25] Oh, God is good. God is good. God is
[1:53:28] good.
[1:53:30] Oh, God is good
[1:53:33] all the time.
[1:53:36] Praise God.
[1:53:38] Amen.
[1:53:41] Amen.
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:53:47] Could Paul and Silas sing that song in
[1:53:50] stocks with bleeding back? Could Could
[1:53:52] he sing? Could they say? I think they
[1:53:54] could. If they can, we can. Amen.
[1:53:58] Remember, count it all joy.
[1:54:01] Amen. Be of good cheer.
[1:54:05] Be happy. Be ye happy.
[1:54:08] Don't be surprised that this is
[1:54:10] happening. This is more precious than
[1:54:12] gold to us. You know what we need? We
[1:54:15] need some good friends that when we get
[1:54:17] down will tell us the truth. Cuz little
[1:54:20] times we go to we go to friends who will
[1:54:23] pet us and stroke us and say, "Oh, I'm
[1:54:26] so sorry. This is so bad. You're right.
[1:54:28] Everything's horrible and nothing's
[1:54:30] working out. You poor poor thing." And
[1:54:32] those when we're feeling down, those are
[1:54:33] the people we like.
[1:54:36] But you know who we need to come in
[1:54:38] contact? We need to come in somebody who
[1:54:39] will say, "Hey, listen, but sister, all
[1:54:41] things work together for good to them
[1:54:43] that love God and are called according
[1:54:45] to his purpose." And and then as soon as
[1:54:47] that person says that, something in you
[1:54:50] is like,
[1:54:52] "Why did they say that?"
[1:54:55] And then you say, "Oh, doesn't the Bible
[1:54:57] say count it all joy when you fall?"
[1:54:59] Hey, let's sing a song of praise
[1:55:01] together.
[1:55:02] Those are the kind of friends we need.
[1:55:04] We need somebody to to bring us back to
[1:55:06] our right mind, to bring us back to the
[1:55:08] mind of Christ, to bring us back to the
[1:55:10] word of God and the purpose in our lives
[1:55:13] until we can say, "Hey, listen. Listen,
[1:55:15] brother, listen, sister. His grace is
[1:55:17] still sufficient for you. Are you a
[1:55:18] child of God? Is God your father? Are
[1:55:21] you here for a purpose? Has he
[1:55:23] orchestrated your life? Then what's the
[1:55:25] problem? The problem is this flesh.
[1:55:27] Let's get away from the flesh and get
[1:55:29] into the spirit and worship God.
[1:55:32] Oh, praise God. God is good, friends.
[1:55:36] Help us to grow,
[1:55:38] grow in grace and in knowledge with God
[1:55:41] and with man. Let's get to the place
[1:55:44] where we can get quiet in our troubles
[1:55:46] and begin to reflect on who we really
[1:55:49] are. Don't let amnesia creep back in.
[1:55:52] Keep it out with the word of God cuz his
[1:55:54] grace is sufficient. Let's bow our heads
[1:55:57] and pray together and thank God. Oh,
[1:55:59] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord.
[1:56:01] God, I thank you for a revelation of who
[1:56:04] we are. I thank you for a revelation of
[1:56:06] our sunship, Lord. For God, all things
[1:56:09] are under control because we know that
[1:56:11] you have it all under control. God, if
[1:56:14] there's anybody here who have not come
[1:56:16] to that solid reality, that breaking of
[1:56:19] the amnesia, that hearing of the eagle
[1:56:21] scream, that awakening of the seed in
[1:56:23] the soil where they know that they
[1:56:25] belong to you, that they came from you
[1:56:27] and going back to you. I pray God that
[1:56:29] you would send the anointing of your
[1:56:30] Holy Ghost to strike that seed and bring
[1:56:32] them to life. May it move from a hoping
[1:56:34] to a knowing Lord. May there be an
[1:56:36] assurance, Lord, by the new birth that
[1:56:38] they have connected with you and they
[1:56:40] know who they are. Take the scales off
[1:56:43] of our eyes and let us see the truth.
[1:56:45] Let us realize the truth. Let us speak
[1:56:47] the truth. Lord, forgive us for our
[1:56:50] complaining that robs us of faith. But
[1:56:52] Lord, let us confess your word at all
[1:56:54] cost in all circumstances above
[1:56:56] everything else. Help us to confess your
[1:56:59] word. Strengthen us, Lord, by your word.
[1:57:01] Anoint us by your spirit to make that
[1:57:03] word live. and help us to put that word
[1:57:06] on our tongues, Lord, that it might
[1:57:08] become a living reality in our lives.
[1:57:10] That we can see all things work together
[1:57:12] for good. That we can see that you're
[1:57:14] preparing us for a great position, Lord.
[1:57:16] That you're drawing us up higher and
[1:57:19] higher through every circumstances,
[1:57:21] building character in us to seat us to
[1:57:23] share your throne with you, God. Help us
[1:57:27] to count it all joy. Help us to be
[1:57:30] happy. Help us to be encouraged, to be
[1:57:34] cheered. Help us, Lord, to rejoice
[1:57:38] in all trials and all tribulations. For
[1:57:41] you are so good to us, Lord. We love
[1:57:45] you. We ask that you would help us,
[1:57:46] Lord, as we go from here. May this
[1:57:49] reality become more of a reality. And
[1:57:52] may it guide us, Lord, through every day
[1:57:54] of our life. We love you, God. We ask
[1:57:56] for your blessings, Lord. In Jesus
[1:57:59] Christ's name we pray.
[1:58:01] Amen.
[1:58:03] God bless you, brother John.
[1:58:07] Great
[1:58:09] is the Lord our God. Oh, great and
[1:58:13] mighty is he.
