[0:00] 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and
[0:02] movements but still in the darkness of
[0:05] all of it you promised that you would
[0:06] appear here in the last days in the
[0:08] Sodom day and you would make yourself
[0:10] known to the children of Abraham the
[0:12] called the elected and here you are
[0:15] tonight after 1900 years you are just as
[0:17] much alive tonight as you was when you
[0:19] talked to the woman at the
[0:23] well if he's just as much alive as he
[0:26] was amen then that means the power is
[0:28] here amen but we have to have the same
[0:31] access she had to get the benefit of him
[0:33] being
[0:37] here it's God manifested in flesh now in
[0:41] the flesh of his bride for the bride and
[0:43] the husband is the same self flesh these
[0:46] two are one and this is what I want to
[0:48] hone in on and the church is becoming
[0:51] the bride
[0:53] amen are you becoming the
[0:56] bride and the church is becoming the
[0:59] bride all all the time by believing the
[1:02] word what's her access to be bride her
[1:06] access is Faith amen the ability to
[1:08] believe the word is what's putting her
[1:10] in the bride what's changing her from
[1:12] church from denomination to bride how is
[1:14] she making this move how is she moving
[1:17] from denomination into bride she's
[1:19] moving that way by believing the word
[1:21] what's her access to brideship her
[1:23] access is by
[1:26] faith it's not going to a message Church
[1:30] it's not getting along with the Saints
[1:31] it's not agreeing with the pastor that's
[1:33] not access believing the word is
[1:37] access and the church is becoming the
[1:39] bride all the time by believing the word
[1:42] I'm becoming the bride all the time
[1:44] because as he shows me the word there's
[1:45] something in me that says Amen to it
[1:48] amen that's the truth that's the truth I
[1:50] didn't know that before I never saw that
[1:52] before somebody turned to a Bible and
[1:54] they opened the Bible and they showed me
[1:56] something I never seen before but there
[1:57] was something in me that said that ain't
[1:59] nothing but the truth what is that
[2:01] that's my access to be
[2:04] bride not good works not good deeds not
[2:07] going to the right place not a mental
[2:09] agreement with all the right things not
[2:12] dressing right none of that is my access
[2:14] that all is secondary that's a
[2:16] manifestation of the faith that I have
[2:18] in my heart but what's my access to be
[2:20] bride my access is faith in the
[2:25] word and the church is becoming the
[2:28] bride all the time by believing the word
[2:30] so that the word in the church becomes
[2:32] the
[2:34] same the word in the church making it
[2:38] the
[2:39] bride the last
[2:41] sign God identifying himself the word in
[2:45] the
[2:46] church we are not bride because we claim
[2:49] to be
[2:54] bride I'm not bride because my lips can
[2:57] say it I'm bride because my faith in my
[3:01] soul can receive it and believe my
[3:04] access is faith
