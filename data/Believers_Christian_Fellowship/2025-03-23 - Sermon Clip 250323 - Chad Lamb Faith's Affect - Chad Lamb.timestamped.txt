[0:00] the Rich Young Ruler who had kept all of
[0:03] The Commandments believed Moses went to
[0:05] synagogue did everything right come to
[0:08] Jesus reverently respectfully kneeling
[0:10] down and calling him good Master when
[0:13] the good Master gave him the answer to
[0:14] his question he didn't want
[0:17] it he wanted his own money he didn't
[0:21] have faith everything that he was
[0:23] portraying wasn't what was really down
[0:25] on the
[0:26] inside he wanted life with no sacrifice
[0:29] he wanted to give up nothing and have
[0:30] everything he wanted the easy way now
[0:33] Jesus comes to zachus zachus does not
[0:35] come to him respectfully zachus does not
[0:37] come and kneel down zakus does not call
[0:39] him good master in the dramatization
[0:41] brother bam said zakus had heard so much
[0:43] about him he was curious but he doubted
[0:45] if he was real and called him an
[0:47] impostor and said he's probably
[0:48] swindling the people why cuz zachus
[0:51] could believe that because that's his
[0:52] own
[0:52] nature he's he's putting his own nature
[0:56] amen onto Jesus and he climbs up in a
[0:58] tree cuz he's not respect for him he's
[1:01] not honoring him he's wanting to hide
[1:02] from him and he's just wanting to peep
[1:04] out and see what's really going on and
[1:06] Jesus comes under his tree and he knows
[1:09] by discernment zakus is up there and he
[1:11] says zachus come down for today I must
[1:13] go abide in your house and and Jesus
[1:15] comes to his house under much criticism
[1:18] because he goes to the house of a sinner
[1:19] but the reality is who was The
[1:22] Sinner who was The Sinner because sin is
[1:25] unbelief it was the rich young man who
[1:28] walked away from Jesus not the is
[1:32] zakus he come reverently he come with
[1:35] all the accolades he come with all all
[1:37] the Commandments have been completed in
[1:39] his life he come ready amen and he he he
[1:43] did not
[1:44] believe zakus came the wrong
[1:48] way as soon as Jesus comes to
[1:51] dinner Z listen Jesus never told zakus
[1:57] what to do or what to say or what did he
[1:59] need for
[2:00] salvation zakus stood up and said Lord I
[2:05] give half of all my goods to the
[2:08] poor how did he know to do that Jesus
[2:11] never required it he never asked him to
[2:14] amen Jesus told the Rich Young Ruler if
[2:17] you do this you will get this Jesus
[2:21] never said that to zakus he never
[2:22] promised zakus anything this came out of
[2:25] the faith that was inside zakus he stood
[2:28] up he caught the revelation and he
[2:30] realized amen half of everything I got I
[2:32] give to the poor if I've stole anything
[2:35] from anybody I'll restore fourfold and
[2:37] you might say well you know the request
[2:39] of the Rich Young Ruler was give
[2:40] everything if he gave everything he
[2:42] wouldn't have anything to restore what
[2:43] he
[2:44] stole after he gives half to the poor
[2:47] and he pays back four times everything
[2:49] he's taken he may not have been left
[2:51] with a nickel to his name friends yeah
[2:54] how did he stand up and do what the rich
[2:57] younger miss doing and the rich Young
[3:00] Ruler heard the sermons heard the
[3:04] testimonies supposedly live the
[3:07] life but who had the life
[3:13] zakus because faith has an
[3:17] effect when he come in contact with
[3:20] Jesus Christ and recognize who this was
[3:23] it had an effect on him and that effect
[3:25] came into a manifestation
