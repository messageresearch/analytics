bless israel father because those who bless israel they are blessed father so we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you all and i think while we're standing let's open the word of the lord i mean and i would suggest in two portions of the scripture genesis chapter 18. and verse 14 genesis 18 where thank you for your musicians truly appreciate genesis 8 18 verse 14 is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i loved not and for she was afraid and he said nigh but thou didst love and the man arose from dance and looked towards sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him today we could we could say should god hide anything from the bride knowing she goes into the rapture there's no way no way you know i mean in in romans chapter uh romans chapter 1 verse 16 romans chapter 1 verse 16. in the new testament for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jews first and also to the greek for daring is the righteousness of god revealed and here we see the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word we may be seated now i greet you all in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and it's certainly a great honor for me to start these services today i'm back here after two years in that kind of corona chaos that we have i bring greetings from brother rhode walt my pastor and the church in beaslesburg i went to different churches in the last week from all of them i bring greetings wednesday i was in brother paul's he sent greetings to this church and uh we feel really connected to one another and um you have to thank brother brother brother um chad for his most noble invitation for me to be here uh for his friendship for his brother my god richard blessie by the chat i i said many many years ago in the time of transition of the church i am a bc effion and i never forgot because that was what kennedy said it was very important for those germans in the time of the russian threat he said i am a berliner and germans never forgot that you know never forgot that that meant a lot for them you know and so i still say i'm not kennedy you know don't misunderstand me right you know but i want to say this evening i'm i'm a btf and and uh blessed be the name of the lord it's honor honor for me to be here and uh honored to have such a wonderful father that we have um if you wouldn't mind i would really start these services uh to speak about our father okay i will not preach uh but i will just share with you things that are very precious to me um i'm very happy to get acquainted with our most noble brother shambo i'm very interested to listen about your brother shem you got rich you bless you richly your church that came and all of you and i will not name um all of you all of the friends after all these years 20 years now when i came here with the music manipulation it was exactly 20 or 2001 in the time of our brother lonnie and and and uh brother jeff and the the team you know that was there and um yes surely should not forget the greetings of our brother hans munich of our sister sibili brother eckerhart and many many many are just greeting you and hope didn't forget all the greetings from germany and yes may the lord richly bless you and uh i start directly into the word is that fine for you directly entering and i'm i'm sometimes saying this that i'm sure i'm not offending your feelings because because we we are we know one another too long that we know a little bit how we work and what we think and what we believe but the message that we believe does not come from america it comes from the presence of god it was it was a man from jefferson will preaching it but it comes from our father the message of the hour is not a doctrine it is not a book of do's and don'ts it's it's our father talking to us and we understand that language because we were in him we understand and others don't understand that language but we understand his language and we understand it went from the messenger to the message it went from the prophet to the prophecy somebody and we have seen the effect of this message in our life we see this message has transforming power a person came to me and he spoke about brother branham and about the bridge and how much people fell from that bridge i said brother honestly you come too late honestly you come to really we are not staying with william brennan we went from the messenger to the message we have seen already the effect we are pregnanted with the word of the lord honestly we're too late for dates and facts and doubt you're too late for this and and so we are very very thankful and and uh here's a question that comes to brother branham and uh you know i'm i'm a german but me and technique there are two words worlds that now come together yeah here we go okay here we go really um as i said in the beginning uh as i'm a german um it is i can always hide please understand that i'm not finding always the right words you know i will not go into a doctrine this evening okay but i would like to share a vision okay because please understand one or two services is not enough to explain a doctrine no we cannot never show the balance in all things we cannot bring all i wouldn't do this i would even start about that you know because i'm mixed up anyhow i leave more questions than answers you know but i would like to give a vision about certain things okay and i can hide very very fine behind my german accent because years ago when i was here i i went into the church and the alarm went on so the sheriff came and it seems to happen different times by the chair that the sheriff because he was quite upset and i was the only one that he had his dogs and his shares and whatever and i could just say uh me from germany [Music] so i got he felt sorry for me and he you know i had grace in the side of his eyes so so but please please keep in mind take what i want to say okay and sometimes if i miss expressing myself you have to understand my heart okay i'm missing sometimes some some words okay i always tell this um um i i know how to speak spanish you know but i i always say because i'm sometimes go in those countries but i said i will never preach in spanish because i will make a split in the church just because of my grammar so i keep these things off english is enough but you have to have a little bit of grace for me and let's let's let's answer a question that might let's might help us because what i fear and what i really do not understand how can we be in the message of the hour and we fear the rapture how can we how can we fearing the thing which is part of us i mean it seems we did not understand really who we are it seems we we overlooked something because once you understand you are that rapture it's at least in you i mean never forget what we talk about at church there is a divine part but there is a human part and we have to cover both it's divinity in humanity that's so important huh here's the question to brother branham um you you say how brother marcus how could you can you say that we are we are the rapture the for example resurrection it was an event and it was a person jesus said i am the resurrection the rapture is an event we're waiting still for it we're in it we're in the cycle yes but the rapture is a person it's a manifestation of a person okay so please explain the mystery of the translation of the bride just a change see our bodies now let's say our you know what i mean when i say that i don't mean to be sacrilegious i don't mean to say ours i don't mean to say this church i mean to say to every believer abraham he was looking for a promised son that was promised him as is it right and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is that right the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to sarah and abraham their bodies had to be changed is that right she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breast her breast was dried up her womb was wasn't fertile she was sterile steroid she could not have a baby her heart was too old to stand labor so what happened god changed her her back to a young woman and he did abraham to abraham the same thing because he said his body was as good as that see and he had to change their body in order to receive the promised son and we cannot receive the promised son that promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies our sin i skipped something out of that quote he said so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there there is only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word see and the same thing is or the translation of the bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word and that same thing did by sarah before when the old body that she had the first body it had to be changed in order to produce the sun you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it will have to be changed the same way to receive the sun so so we see there is a word laying in us it does not come by our own education it is laid by our father into us uh the psalm said he even laid eternity into our hearts eternity is himself blessed be the name of the lord so instead let's start our little journey we start in in jerusalem with the early church here we have peter speaking to the first church and we start with a big misunderstanding which became a dogma but which was hold hold up held up until this day the latin phrase extra ecclesia nu la salus means outside the church there is no salvation this expression is an axiom often used as shorthand for the doctrine that the church is necessary for salvation it is a dogma in the catholic church and the eastern orthodox church in reference to their own communions so that is what brother branham understood and he was the one bringing us from church thinking to word thinking denomination thinks in church terms we think about a family about a mystical body which is bigger than my local assembly which is fine but one of these days our doors will be closed and we will still continue to go on this will be the name of the lord and and and and and it's so important once you understand you cannot enter into a cult or a denomination you understand who you are you come from a family you come from his mind you are just expressed here nobody can preach you in and nobody can preach you out i'm not depending on the favors of my brothers and sisters though i need it because i have to respect god in you but we're not we're not depending on our eternal salvation of somebody's opinion about us we come from his mind and we go back to his mind blessed be the name of the lord so here the church starts and we have the birth of the church 80 33 and we have the beginning of the first age 80 53 so we have 20 years in between and brother bryan let's say in my own word in the resume of the church ages he said he said my own words when the first church eight started she was already a fallen woman [Music] it took 20 years exactly the first h start we have 20 years and brother bran uses this many times since 20 years we are here it's not a denomination yet he refers to its beginning so something happens in the in the years between 33 and 53 that means the birth of the church was on the day of pentecost that is exactly so then the conversion of the apostle paul in acts chapter 9 was later now as paul was not on the day of pentecost brother branham was not in azusa street came later that's important because brother brain said they call me to me to be a man born out of season both it had to be so both could fall first pentecost fell the second eve fell and pentecost 1906 fell so my question is why should i go back to something that fell in the beginning though though we highly respect the birth of the church we highly respect and and so that there is no misunderstanding all these young people in the message you need the holy ghost you need a start you need a beginning you need a birth by the holy ghost but from that on you need a growth and not coming back to your birth every youth camp you have you need a growth but you have you need to have a beginning so what happens peter is in the house of cornelius now you have to understand one thing the first church never called themselves christians for them the coming of the holy ghost was part of the jewish tradition they felt that they are jewish they never they they even when the first church came together they came together in the temple in the hall of solomon but the heart of solomon was part of the old ancient temple and you remember when paul came to the to the early church that that that they told him you have to cut your hair you have to shave your hair and you have to bring offerings okay so the early church did not know what to do with jewish traditions because when peter entered into the house of cornelius which was agenda he said this and he said unto them you know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company company or to come unto one another's nation but god has and so on how can peter say i'm a jew he has received the baptism of the holy ghost you understand but they called himself jews and when he entered into the house of cornelius the early church asked them how could you enter into a house of an uncircumcised you understand there were in reality the early church were messianic jews they had the holy ghost but their identification was still jew they thought this is the fulfillment of joel so the messiah comes and we will be real jews exactly they did not understand who were who they were so what happened is the first christians were called in antioch acts chapter 13. and here we have the great problem that paul is coming on the scene because there was a great dispute between both sides how to continue you have to understand one thing the jewish church at that at that time consisted of three kind of people one were real jews born to be jews jewish jewish religion was never in a religion of evangelization but you could join them if you want they call them proselytes proselytes were heathen who wanted to become jews okay so you just have to make your circumcision and then you become a jew you're proselyte and you have the third group they are just how you call uh they are they they're sympathizing with that religion okay they said we like it we love the honesty we like the moral standard but we don't want to become circumcised that is the group that paul is referring to when he goes into those synagogues they are sympathizing with jewish religion but don't want to become real jews so they he can now show another way jesus christ that is important for example take as an example of our time uh we all know marilyn monroe marilyn monroe became a jew because she married arthur miller okay so you can become a jew if you want but not by birth but by different different other things the first church had the great problem that some of these first christians were former jews for them the torah was still the torah sabbas was still sabbath and they even said yes but jesus said i did not come to abolish law but to fulfill all law but paul brought in gentiles who never knew the torah and they asked the question torah for me that means nothing so you understand you know you now have a church where one says i mean we need circumcision because this is an eternal covenant amen and the other group says i mean why do i need jesus if i take circumcision i mean where's the point so so here we have a big problem to come together and and and paul understands the great great trouble so what happens is this they come together to what they call the council in jerusalem that was very clear in ad 49 the book of acts makes it makes it very very clear and the bible says it like this and certain man which came down from judea taught the brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved and it says but there rose certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed there were converted pharisees into christianity but brought their pharisee thinking into it okay saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses so now they have brought their doctrinal problems to antioch now put on the spiritual jacket the first false doctrine came from jerusalem because it was brothers from judea i mean and it was people they were christians but having still jewish thinking they didn't understand the plan so now the church is into big conflicts do we keep moses law or is it isn't it important anyhow you have to understand like this let's for example we have you have a mixed marriage of a heathen christian and a jewish christian so the jewish christian said now today is shabbat it's the day of the lord we do nothing the heathen christian said this is saturday you have to repair the car you have to mow the yard he said no this is shabbat she said i mean what about your shabbat we have we follow jesus so it's it's it becomes a big problem what what what about the new generation shall that be circumcised the heathens would say on white circumcision we believe in christ the jews would say no it is an eternal covenant with us so it was a quite a big big big big problem and what happened is they now came together in the what they call the jerusalem council and they had to speak now god doesn't make mistakes the main man was paul but paul was still under the shadow of barnabas so when the bible always says barnabas and paul because barnabas brought him to christianity what happened is the bible says d all the multitude multitudes kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them now i want you to put on your spiritual jackets peter was the one with the key peter was the one who could say i was with brother brennan and he told me so i was with jesus personally i mean i mean i am the one that he said you have the key he was the far most prominent of all peter was the spokesman on the day of pentecost if somebody had to say something it was peter i mean i mean he was there when jesus appeared to to the disciples different different times peter is the man when he speak when he stands up the church is silent what peter but he has a problem peter is not the angel of the church the angel is paul so peter speaks but paul has the vision [Applause] you understand because brother brahman said the angel of the church catches the mystery for the church but but i want i want to give you a compliment the first church fell though they had the holy ghost but they were yet just born you remember that brother brandon that god says to brother branham you cannot teach pentecost the baby supernatural thing that means they are born again because you cannot be a baby without born again but from that day on you must grow in your vision therefore new birth and adoption is two phases no if you put it in one you you will mix up the whole plan of god one is the birth one is the adoption exactly the placing it's enough in it for me it's not another coming of the holy spirit but it's a placing that's what the prophets it's a placing one is the birth one is a real place it's a process okay okay please don't preach or say if you got the holy ghost you got it you got the beginning of it and from then on go on okay take your inheritance grow and okay so we have a spokesman amen and we have an angel and the problem of the church was they did not receive their messenger therefore about the premise preaches the message recognizing the messenger and its message amen blessed be the name of the lord because they were listed they were focused on peter not even peter knew who paul was for them paul was just a nice missionary for us he was the messenger i mean now if we would be there and they would have that great council of discussions and debate and we could be transformed in time and i would be we'll be there i would i would say gentlemen stop your discussion the angel is here so stop i mean stop your brother's meeting all your opinion here is paul he's the angel of the church age but as they didn't under because the bible never said and everybody sat down and paul stood up and they said oh we understand he was the angel they didn't recognize him till the end therefore it was easy for satan to deceive eve once again it doesn't take away their new birth but you understand if somebody says we have to go back in the beginning i always say what do you mean by that but because we recognized our messenger in our and the message for the age can you say amen so it was quite a difficult and and and and when you understand when paul speaks about galatians he he is cheating a little bit he doesn't give the same results like it is written in the book of acts paul is the only one he's sitting there he said i can give the answer but nobody's listening to me okay blessed be the name of the lord so he they find out that they say okay peter you take care of the church in jerusalem let me and let me go outside because these people were programmed on peter so what happens is therefore paul said some are keeping feasts very high especially holy days some are not keeping them at all what does he say we have two groups some have jewish background and some have heathen background gentile background exactly so therefore he says he says there's only one thing i know it's the cross of christ it's a cross of a at at calvary that's what he's writing to that's what is he writing to the romans okay i'm just reading it again he sees all the discussions about closings about about about about food about shabbat about moses law and he said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it's the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believes the jews first and also to the greek or the gender in other words he said we need something which we have in common okay okay you have to live that way and they will live that way but we have one thing in common the cross of jesus christ exactly so this becomes very very important for us because paul then starts his own church uh the church in ephesus 8053 you know we see later there is another conflict between peter and paul and peter begins to dawn he cannot bring it into word peter never writes in his episode look paul is the angel he doesn't see it but he can see paul speak things that seems to be right very deep we don't understand we say aim into things that we don't understand but it sounds good in peter there is a changing of dispensation he is first a man peter and peter understand no no here's somebody i don't fully see his position but he has more than me myself that's tremendous that is the holy ghost in peter to acknowledge another gift therefore i have so much problems with what we believe in the message today the man of the hour i mean i mean who is the man of the hour christ is the man of the year hey we are brothers we're sisters we're family we're family of god okay there's no need for us to become arrogant because we have no message of ourselves as a father is the head of his own home a pastor is the head of his own church the messengers the head of the whole church age and christ is the head of all messengers i was asked the question brother marcus is has somebody the right to correct the prophet i said yes god god is the head above all prophets all messengers are in his hand he can correct who he wants blessed be the name of the lord and then brother brahm said there will be a people who will be the final voice for the final age under their messenger they will not have a message for themselves but you see this is the beginning and now we're starting about about about about something that that that is so contrary to the justice of god we have now here a type on the exodus and brother branham makes clear he said every redemption has two parts it's coming out and going in now i want you to put on the spiritual record to answer the question of brother branham about the word being in us and i would like to show how we are standing in our own way because we came to this message as pentecostals or as lutherans or holiness movement or or whatever we were but we many times see the message through the glasses of a former denomination and god takes many many years to take these things out look here they come one in a million what was the test they all drink in the same rock they all eat the same spiritual manner as we are eating this morning but the word tests prove them when they come to the time of cadiz bernier when they started over into the promised land and they could not go over till they was tested by the words and all the other ten came back and said we can't make it the people are like we are like grasshoppers to them they're great wall city the opposition is too great but joshua and caleb stealed the people they said we are more than able to do it why god said before they left the promised land i have given you the land i've given it to you it's yours but there are one out of each billion now you see i think it's in third book of of of moses god says this you keep sir several feasts but one is the feast of unleavened breath bread and god says this i want you to have that feast when you come in your promised land in other words god says you come in your promised land they said we don't make it god said you come in your promised land they said the opposition is too big god says you come in your promised land they said our our families brother rem said they thought our wives will not make it our children will not make it god says i've given you the land god said did you listen what i told you when you come and you god says if you go into the rapture you do this lord i don't know if i make the rapture because if you go into the rapture you do this not if but when you go i mean we say i i don't know about the rapture god but i know because i saw you behind the curtain of time amen we say yes but but but but i don't know if i make a godsend i gave it to you okay and and god says i give and people say yes but i don't know if i'm making got it but i make it for you okay i i give it to you and we say but i know if i make it i give it to you and this was the word test this was the word do you believe god or do you believe yourself because if i ask somebody here who feels to be worthy for the rapture nobody would say amen and god says but i see something in you don't go after your feelings can you say amen amen so i want to talk to people who say the rapture from me is just the next station that i will take and we would think from our look we have a lutheran approach it's it's we must be humble brothers and sisters let me put off my shoes to show how humble i am and then we would say the rapture i i don't know if i'm worthy and this looks and people love this so much but here's the bride who says we make it why god saw do you understand when brother brahman said quick healing power let me look behind the curtain of time and i saw all of you there and i said that's for me can you say amen and for us it's arrogance it's not it's believing god that was the word chest can you say amen do you believe yourself or do you believe what god says about you can you say amen so this was the test to enter into the promised land so god brings the same test in every church age he says a trumpet always denotes war the messenger the angel come on earth the messenger of the hour like luther's like any of the messengers that would have talked off what does he do he arrives a seal opened reveals a trumpet sound war declared away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group who the messenger they are put in a plague falls upon those who rejected it see and then it goes on then they organize get another organization do you remember that salvation is connected to the word of your age that's what the prophet said very very clear the messenger seals them and when they reject the the back is closed and you cannot come into we had a very prominent preacher and we will not certainly enter into that subject because i i'm behind another man's pulpit and he was asked a question a little bit like a trap brother son so do you believe the lamb left the mercy seat and and this is a critical question because in between or five minutes people put you in that box or in that box so so so and he was wise you know because people have a concept of a lamp sitting on a chair and when it stands up the mercy is over okay and he said this he says he said god is not changing his nature all the time god has god is love the question is who will have access one when to that throne of mercy who for whom will the door be opened and not right and i thought by myself that was that was really wonderful god is not changing his nature at every church age he is love do you know one thing when when when the rapture pass when the rapture is over the blood of calvary still works for who for the jews brother brahm said a new redemption is opened for the jews they will be saved under what with what for because of what because of the blood of calvary and when he died on that on on on on on calvary he had all his plan in his mind he paid the price when he said it is finished it was finished [Applause] therefore brother marcus is mercy over mercy is over and mercy is not over because because you have to think in dispensational terms and and individual terms look at this let me say let me say let me make it as an illustration to make it very simple for you now you have seven arrows okay in your back and you are right in the middle of africa and here comes the line and the line looks to you and you look to the line okay so i always say if it's a christian line he will just pray before he is looking to you okay so you took your first fledge goes away second third fourth fifth you know one thing i have two flesh over and remember when god sent a messenger he always sends a message for grace always god loves the world he sends wesley and he's and he thinks certainly god knows all things he says i want the world to understand who i am but they reject the message some are sealed under him but the rest is rejected then he the next flesh he sends wesley okay then he has one flesh still in his hands and he sends william brennan with a tremendous gift a worldwide ministry and god says now now the world must now understand they must come to christ but they reject and god knows one thing i have no more flesh there's no more messenger coming on this earth the denominational world who has rejected the message of the hour has not another opportunity it is over god will not send another messenger it is over for them but there are individuals and i i just say it as a vision because if we say and and i believe 100 that salvation that the bride all these things are in the word for this age the message for this age to reject us is to reject christ but the question is even in between of the message we say they did not receive the words but they received their denomination but we have denominations in the message now where do i end okay if they say there is no way for them then it means okay only those who believe like i believe because some people who have in the message i rejected the word they just received god sent a prophet and they stay so i have to say okay i have to make that circle so much only those who believe like me the rest have no salvation have nothing therefore always say this keep the blood in the in denominations you say brother marcus they come together i want to say this they make big convention in vain do they worship today but in between of these ranks there are still some people they have a way they have a future they maybe never had we know denominations is the vision that brother branham had about miss america miss europe he didn't never died for those people but in denominations are wonderful people amen and god has a way for them can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord for the for the individual brother brahm says clear 1956 i i i either america will take this and this side 1960 said i will not pray for america anymore so america is finished but here is american city are you finished no no no we are not finished do you understand god america still has wonderful people um and they are not finished they are bright you see both sides if not we come into next then then first say there's no hope for nothing in the denominations okay then it's in the messy okay only those who believe like us at the end it becomes just to your local church only our local church and churches have people who come and who go for many reasons so we have to tell them okay there's no more blood because they left our doctrine then you are back in the thing you see ah you were in the hospital and god on calvary he saw the whole plan everybody who really just just a penny brother blame said like this he said there is some people that just can have a pennies worth worthless and god can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out say they're not in because god uses pennies sometimes don't make the circle smaller make it bigger maybe the love is god it's bigger than we thought about it and then brother brain said this and here you have to bring both quotes together he says a man if a man serves god's purpose there is a resurrection just as sure as anything but brother blame said god uses pennies and on the other hand side there's a resurrection for all those that served his purpose let those people alone let them be what they are you say what about these people let god decide on the white throne judgment this is this is eagle age this is bright age but the system brother is over in the messenger outside of the message remember one thing we go to a hospital i'm marcus becker here's somebody dying with kuvit you see and he understands i'm a minister or you are a minister now that person says mr becker i don't i don't know i i i i never was a christian i want to get right with god should i say brother there's no way it's finished for you i will not say this no i will not say this what would i say to him okay i give you you first have to study the life of william branham no i will not say i would say look he died for your sin on the cross of calvary and whosoever will it let him come if we call it salvation or granted don't play on words but i believe god honors these decisions blessed be the name of the heart there is hope for the individual but the systems are all over brother i'm in vain do they worship me rejecting the messages rejecting christ some people they don't have time i mean if you have one hour for a person and one hour that he has still to live we we had these things when we were standing at the death beds of people we never spoke about about the thunders we didn't do that this is for bride this is coming to prison when it comes to pure salvation just it's just in a denomination accepting his grace and mercy and leave it up into the up up up to the hand of the lord you just say hey jesus died for you you put your name into it and he takes it and then let god decide wherever he is that's to be the name of the lord but i want to just not not say it as a doctrine because i'm not really believing what everybody believes knowing what everybody believes but keep it as a vision because we had already these tendencies of us for and no more no no god has a way but bride is bright can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so so here comes something here's the next one can you say amen so far so you can pray for america you say it's finished still pray for it sometimes we pray for damage control i mean even if you're saying it's fantastic it's tremendous no no it's not tremendous amen pray for germany pray for for pray for for the governors pray for the president do it don't say everything is finished no we're still living here blessed be the name of the world knowing that our kingdom is not america we come from another country going back to another country that should be the name of the lord i'll just give you an example i am a janitor and there was uh uh i had to be there as a janitor in the in the uh in some kind like a speech about israel so i wanted to be there it was from the lutheran church and it was a good speech about israel explaining israel very very fine very good and they had a little book quite expensive um about the jews in the black forest where we're living in and i thought about my pastor and about his wife and i said i so much would like to give them that book as a little present you know they were sick and just to bless them a little bit i thought about you you know but i had no money and i did not say anything was there and everything was finished and so far and he was he was even something like a like a bishop or whatever you know there everybody is packing his things together and the bishop comes to me he said look i have on my heart to give you this book as a little gift now what should i should i throw dirt i would say thank you god bless you richly god bless you i'm no harm to wish them well i mean we were younger and we put everybody who was not of our opinion we'll put them in the hands of the of satan we left them into the hand of satan because they were not one with us today we're a little bit older we leave them into the hands of god he said god help my brother he's wrong as he can be but god bless him god help him because god helped us so much god had a lot of patience with us why shouldn't i have patience with my brothers not agreeing with what they all do but be one blessed be the name of the lord and if somebody is a penny brother you not change that man but you are not changing him by despising him so give him a little bit of hope he says we don't believe it's bright but at the right throne judgment god is a true judge and even if your job we i i dare just come to church god honors even that everything that you do for his kingdom blessed be the name of the lord by that you always keep a friendly atmosphere around you amen amen what about these christians god bless them what about these people in the message god bless them because brother we are we are called to bless people not to curse them we are abraham's seed do you agree no i don't agree but god bless them god gave us so much why shouldn't we bless them all you know bless that's not echo many could you have your stand sure but why should we despise others the moment you despise other i tell you is the spirit that comes upon your own your own congregation then it's only the message yes there's a truth only but then i ask what kind of message i'm in i mean okay only that doctrine in the message okay and then it brings and then it's only our church okay and then you know there are different believers in the church yeah but only that group of the lord croak it becomes difficult brother i'ma keep your heart open and say i commit you in god's hand god brother lonnie always said the first resurrection will prove who is who why should we make up our mind now this is bright this is half bright this is just part of a bride leave them into the hands of the lord treat everybody to be a bride and god knows who is who that's obedient here's martin luther so he's writing this he's a he's a catholic monk he says i'm reading it wikipedia meanwhile in the same year 1519 i had begun interpreting the psalms once again i felt confident that i was now more experienced since i had dealt in university courses with saint paul's letters to the romans to the galatians and the letters to the hebrews i had conceived a burning desire to understand what paul meant in his letter to the romans but thus far they had stood in my way not the cold blood around my heart but that one word which is in chapter one the justice of god is revealed in it i hated that word here's your messenger you say it's a german it's your messenger too okay justice of god which by the use and custom of all my teachers i had been taught to understand philosophically as referring to formal or active justice as they call it the justice by which god is just and by which he punishes sinners and the unjust but i blameless monk that i was felt that before god i was a sinner with an extremely troubled conscious i couldn't be sure that god was appeased by my satisfaction i did not laugh no rather i hated the just god who punishes sinners in silence if i did not blaspheme then i certainly i grumbled vehemently and got angry at god i said isn't it enough that we miserable sinners lost for all eternity because of original sin are oppressed oppressed by every kind of calamity through the ten commandments why does god keep sorrow upon sorrow through the gospel and through the gospel threaten us with his justice and his wrath this was how i was raging with wild and disturbed conscience i constantly badgered saint paul about that spot in romans 1 and it was actually wanted to know what he meant i mediated night and day on those words until at last by the mercy of god i paid attention to their context the justice of god is revealed in it as it is written the just person lives by faith i began to understand that in these verses the justice of god is that by which the just per person lives by a gift of god that is by faith i began to understand that this verse means that the justice of god is revealed through the gospel but it is a passive justice that by which the merciful god justifies us by faith as it is written that just lives by faith all at once i felt that i had been born again and entered into the paradise itself through open gates so the the mystery lays in grammar so let me explain you this there is a genitive of the object and the genitive of the subject it's very simple so this evening you learn something from your german friends not your own language now you can you can can can talk it right if we say the enemy's fear is great it has two directions it can mean we fear the enemy but it can mean too the enemy has a lot of fear because of us his two direction and and and you have to understand martin luther he was a doctor so he was studying he was translating the bible and he understood he always understood the justice of god that means i must be just to please god and he look to himself and remember the subject that we have amen do you believe your feelings or do you believe god and he was thinking about he was praying more and fasting more and he felt worse but then he understood justice of god means the lord is my justice he said i will never make it but he is my justice the whole book became a new book brother once you find grace in god you can have grace with people and there is many people in this message they have the doctrine of william brennan but they don't have the spirit of with it they are just judgmental with themselves and by that they are judgmental with others lest it be the name of the lord so what happens is he had his revival over a genitive so what about us with all these spoken word books what kind of revival should we have if he has a revival just over a genitive you have your revival of an accusative that's fine main thing is you have a revival can you say amen but brothers we were reading the bible under our former background you can listen to a preacher you can see his background he comes from a pentecostal church very very clear he's quoting the prophet but his backup is completely pentecostal the emphasis is very very clear from where he comes from brother therefore we have to renew our minds therefore we have to die of all of our old thinking and taking god's thoughts can you say amen so here comes the next messenger that we have the first one so you understand one spot it's once martin luther saw the love of god how he cares reformation starts reformation was not just a military thing because those germans they have a military spirit and they like to fight and they had no no martin luther was driven by by that love to say i have to tell the people you can fast you can pray you can go to church you can give and give and give and give but this is never your justice the justice is god himself for you blessed be the name of the lord and here comes the next one here we have john wesley he is the next amen he's the next messenger now john wesley he was son of susanna wesley one of tw i think 12 children now susana wesley was that that woman that brother brandon mentioned she had time every week half an hour for every child so in susana's wesley she was the wife of a preacher everything was let me say had its order i mean john wesley was raised that way everything has its order you open you open you open for example how you call it yes something you open like this and you don't have to look you know exactly what the throttles are something like this everything is in order right so when he was a young man he gave his heart to the lord and he was forming the methodist movement methodist comes from method and they said look i mean come to church whenever we want we will come together to serve the lord every evening therefore the methodist movements to make a method method coming to uh to the house of god therefore i pat on your shoulders you are a good methodist this evening coming to church okay but we have to grow into more than death so he gave his heart to the lord as a good methodist everything is in order and he goes over to georgia to be a missionary here in georgia now on the way to georgia he was in the ship and he met german brothers from the holiness movement and we have to understand the former christians were the eagles of their day they were not they were eagles for that day because john wesley was deeply impressed because they came into a storm and they thought the ship would wreck and the german brothers were sitting in in the ship they were just having fellowship they were just worshiping god amen near that now the whole ship would give me the wrong key another key see right no no it's wrong again so there was so much in there in the in the in the in that service for the lord nothing bothered them i wonder ourselves if we're too bothered with coffee today or with trump always bite and whatever brother we come from another kingdom if covet 19 ends kobe 20 will arrive do you understand we have a lot of great prophecies and great things in the message of the hour that is wonderful i'm 100 for it i thought i'm for every gift but god never warned us god never said in two years there will be this this god was hiding it because he wants his church to grow into immaturity he wants to have a church that he said whatever comes whatever goes there prepared god does not want it we can have these things nothing really nothing else but god doesn't want for us uh brother son so can you tell me what happens in two months god says i'm i'm your future i mean because you're not there then relying on somebody who tells you what comes god knows whatever comes whatever goes i have a church who knows who they are let's be there but there's nothing not not wrong against it but but but but god never wanted so they were so much just worshipping the lord and john wesley was impressed he writes in his diary very impressed so he comes to georgia and he wants to be more holy than the holiness movement he wants to top it he wants to say if they were holy i will i will show them what a real holy man is [Laughter] good it's fine but the americans were the wrong kind of people because the americans in the time of john wesley had already the haha spirit like brother branham said amen so he wanted to be this is church man there's no laughter he has nothing this is i mean and they had already their heart spirits so so we have a problem somebody wants to be more holy than anybody else and the church says for him he he had church every day so he comes to georgia okay the brother said okay this afternoon after church we have barbecue where they said barbecue after church we have church [Laughter] and in the evening church and the americans said you can have your church you can have your own church if you want we have barbecue you understand so he wants to reform the people in georgia but it never worked you see so what happened is he had to flee because there was some kind of a story on december 1733 he has to flee back home to england the church just refused they didn't want to have that kind of thing off you know being always stricken oh but they want to have a little bit of of of liberty that's fine so he comes back home and god gives him two events to change his life god wants to train us brother there's nothing wrong to be wrong because we're young and when we're young we make mistakes and god knows we make mistakes but god says okay john boy stand up do it again but you learn your lesson do better next time every minister every believer he is growing he starts as a young man and as a young man he makes mistakes of young people we have to forgive one another we have to forget we cannot make a story because you will get what you reap the same way you will judge your brother god will judge you amen lester be the name of the lord so what happens is this john wesley still amen really strong in his face and his conviction and holiness is part of the gospel there's no question about it but he wanted to make it to the extent they're really pleasing god now here he comes to a person who is sentenced to death that was 1738 i think so yes he's sentenced to death and he's asked to go to that delinquent tomorrow he will die and to say some nice words just to bring it to the lord now here's john wesley he comes not willingly he comes and he thinks okay this unbeliever i will try to convince him to christ he will refuse i would say okay shalom what can i do sorry for this pray for you and then okay i continue my way so he brings the testimony to that man and the man gives his heart to the lord so what can you say to a man giving his heart to the lord he he's exactly like jonah preaching preaching repentance and they repent i mean that was not what i was preaching for [Applause] i want to preach judgment i repent and he does the same thing so the only thing that he can say is brother you're dying tomorrow and the blood of calvary is sufficient for you what can he say the man has no way he he was never injured he never paid his tithing but he can just say if you if you accept that sacrifice of calvary exactly so so he does he dies the next day and john wesley thinks twice he said look i mean i i'm i'm i'm i i'm making one program after the other i get a heart attack by all the things that i do for the lord and he does nothing and he's saved that's not that's only because john wesley thought okay i will arrive at the door of heaven my name is john wesley i was in 30 countries many people know my name i brought so much people to the lord and got a very wonderful church and i started the movement and he understood god was not interested in those things because he is my justice we do things for god but not to to get anything like a special reward who was preaching the best who was the deepest who brought no by justice is the lord what what and and and what happens then one of the next days uh he comes to a uh a a a reunion of the morovians and and according to his own diary he went there against his will you see so listening to those morovians okay right in london in the eldest gate street so he came and sometimes we in the message we can have a certain arrogance of thinking that we know somebody something and uh who just first and second pool man man i cannot have fellowship no no this is just no no no bad influence bad influence how how would mr trump say low energy man low energy man what is he what is his preaching total disaster total disaster so he comes there and they were just reading a preface and he must be sitting there and said man they need a real preacher and they but they don't recognize who is just in their midst so he said but then he says according to his own diary he says in the evening i went very unwillingly to a society in elders gate street where one was reading luther's preface to the epistles to the romans about a quarter before nine while he was describing the change which god works in the heart through the face in christ i felt my heart strangely warmed i felt i did trust in christ christ alone for salvation and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins even mine and saved me from the law of sin and death rather until that time he had a doctrine he had a zeal but then he found his father it changes life brother once you get we don't speak about compromise we but we speak about somebody you know what the love of god is if you know what the love of god is you can give it to the next one if not you just give frustration and pressure and these things i mean everybody's a low energy man everybody is just a total disaster only we ourselves tremendous amen unbelievable nobody can sing like me forget it you understand he changed from a doctrine to a reality sometimes you have a family in the message in there they are they are there they're wonderful you know you see the children on the photo a model family but sometimes they are just rich young rulers they're never born again never born they know how to believe to behave in the message but that is not salvation brother the rich ruler said i've learned these things from my youth how to behave how to dress but god wants a heart god wants a soul god wants a love god wants an enthusiasm god wants the young people to say this message is my message amen the prophet came from me and christ died for me but a true christian never becomes a brand of mite but we have branamites but you have to understand brandon brandon matism is not christianity amen we're christians but we understood the seventh angel was not leading us to himself it was leading us to christ can you say amen amen therefore these three young men uh over there in babylon who saw the star they did not look at the stars saying wow that's deep man that's tremendous three stars in one line we make a picture we make the three stars in line denomination that's tremendous have you ever seen when young people come from a certain uh convention they say brother marcus that was tremendous that was deep he said yes yes we never heard it that way brother mark says yes because the prophet never said it therefore you never heard it definitely never heard it i mean and then i asked i asked and and what did you understand uh nothing but it was tremendous and that's tremendous man we have to bring these youngsters into a position that they find their place in the world we don't want to have fans no sir we're not influenced so so when they saw this thought i didn't say the star was leading them where to to a person to christ the king and we have seen his star the seventh star we've seen instead he did not lead us to jeffersonville it led us to a king a person and you say amen so therefore the justice of god i cannot rely i do my best but when it comes to the last minutes of my life i cannot say i understood this i understood that i only can say lord you paid the price for me amen when it comes to reality bride is bright we are growing into something but i mean reality is he is my justice and we and and if you are a son of god you do your best but your best is not enough blessed be the name of the lord here we know that that that elijah and this will help you so much because many times we are standing in our own way here is the prophet elijah he's a tremendous man but he is a melancholic type of a person his nerves were at the end says brother branham in uh what else are here elijah and god at that moment did not send a social worker he sent an angel and that angel had a book or had something to eat and god sent to us an angel with something to eat i mean brother bram said i would have loved to know what kind of vitamins were in those cookies because elijah was running for 40 days and 40 nights i mean we have a food we are running till the rapture and over the rapture this message that we believe is red bull you need an energy drink this message is red bull for us blessed be the name of the lord and then brother blame says this i never forget the sentence he said when do when you do your best and you come to an end then god is obligated to send the same angel to you to lead you further on you do your part and god is his part here's brother branham amen now we see the picture and it says but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place amon standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why she was far away and she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleanses here the message blood cleanses her and she stands there virtuous she no sin on her at all this message revealed our true identity because we come from the mind of god and we should have gone into our theophany and we landed in north carolina god never asked us do you want to be white or black do you want to be male or female you want to live in america or in germany god never god just placed us somewhere and sometimes we think we god placed us wrong but one thing is sure if you think you are placed wrong your beginning was wrong on this earth be sure you leave this earth the right way because god found you i always liked that little that little demonstration it's just it's not a doctrine just a demonstration as everything that i said until now was not doctrine just a vision just to see different approaches in our thinking in our mind doctrine is something else i don't have the time i will not dare to another and behind another man's spirit will give a doctrine but look at this god before the foundation of the world he made a picture of his family all together so we are not arrogant but we are proud proud about our father proud about the family we are royal family amen i mean sometimes i'm at the dentist you know and i'm a person who are fearing the dentist i don't fear the devil i don't feel no demons but i fear the dentist if i just the sounds makes me pray right so the dentist made them they have these little brochures you know so i'm just reading them to get the time so and i speak about the royals prince charles lady diana and i was thinking where is marcus becker we are the real royals so we are proud but not arrogant we have no reason to be arrogant because our grace is by god so god made a photo and he takes his family and throws them in seven church ages seven continents seven and god knows one thing at the end of seven church ages the family of god is together nobody is missing and brother ram said this god is not complete without you this messenger brought us things that nobody else could preach nobody could say my own he means theophany but my own glorified body standing here on that on that platform that's quote of brother branham brother branham who are the angels behold in the face of the father your own theophilus nobody could say this this was our messenger giving us rapturing faith blessed be the name of the lord so what happened when when these angels met brother rem he didn't understand himself until one year later god says turn the picture to the right and who does he see he's christ amen hoffman's head of christ blessed be the name of why is this so important look at this now levi echo says and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he did not die not and he shall take the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with the finger upon the mercy seat eastwards and before the mercy seat shall be sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times third seal and now we found out that the slain lamb is the bloody lamb bleeding all over it has been slain after being stained it raised again it was sitting on the throne say back in behind the throne like this look at this when the when the priest enters into the in the into the holies of holies he opened the curtain and he was making incest so that there was some kind like a smoke around so he went from the west to the east for the east to the west exactly and when he says he was sprinkled eastwards that means he went behind the throne to sprinkle in the right direction but what happened to that high priest he could not be seen anymore amen because there was that kind of smoke and is israel know one thing on yom kippur he said he is now getting let me call it redemption or atonement for all of our sins and brother brahman said this he had his little belt because if he went in unworthy he would fall dead so you can imagine these people and brother brahm said if any religion doesn't make sound it's dead you can bury it anyhow exactly so huh so once he was sure when he came out of it out of that smoke and out of the door israel saw them they knew god accepted our atonement so the revival was going on they were there was there was spiritual party time but what happened the last time we saw jesus when he was ascending up into another dimension and nobody saw him that time but we know how he looked like because brother brahm saw in a vision and he said exactly that was hoffman's head of christ and when we see the picture on sunset mountain we see okay the high priest came back and he looks exactly like it was 2000 years ago in other words our atonement is it's done amen he is accepted so we are accepted nothing stands between me and the rapture can you say amen therefore i told you do you believe god or do you believe your own feelings amen do you believe if somebody doesn't believe that god the lord is your rapture then in reality you don't believe in calvary amen you must say it is finished for me and as a proof that it's finished for me i can receive the message for this day [Applause] and receive the holy ghost as as my abstract title do you understand so it's a tremendous day so brother abraham said this so old man old woman don't be discouraged do you understand gospel is good news gospel is positive because we don't speak we're not speaking now about problems that we have we will have them but we speak about the plan of god brother margaret do you make it i make it because my father amen he will he will make it for me so old man old woman don't you be discouraged if you were if you are a representation up there in his attribute of god if you have if you are represented here you cannot you are eternal and if you cross from the seventh day into the eighth you got it into the eternal by the baptism of the holy ghost you are included in this now if you are just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up or down or i do this wesley holiness movement we are our dresses are longer our hair are longer wonderful i'm not like the rest of the message that's fine but that is not our justification because the muslims have longer dressed than than us they are not even even better than us that that's the expression of our love to god but not our justification if you are i do this i keep the servants there look people who come to church how arrogant they are yeah i understand there are some people here in lima they go nowhere yeah they don't go nowhere yeah but we go to church every sunday it's wonderful but if this creates an arrogance where did it bring you to where did it bring you to amen now and don't eat meat and so forth but this is the eternal this is eternal the feast after the feast of tabernacles see the feast of tabernacles was the last feast the seven swedes we are worshiping now under the feast of tabernacles the seventh church age the sea feast of tabernacles could only be they could only feast it after the day of yom kippur that means this message this christianity has its yom kippur already god accepted it we believe it i don't believe it but god believes it brother blame said this in the beginning when he was just the lord god believed his own word [Applause] [Laughter] so i don't want to trust on my belief but i trust on his belief i say lord you know better than me myself blessed be therefore i'm when it came to the day of of of of uh uh of of the six days war now this is now now marcus becker okay this is my interpretation but brother blame says that when christ comes down revelation 10 fulfilled he will go directly to the jews therefore many people believe it's not fulfilled it will be after the rapture no scriptures have compound meanings different meanings but what happened after 63 what was the next great step of god it was the six days war i mean hallelujah and the and this and the six days void was not israel giving them back the temple mount it was god with god the threat the tactic in the six days war was this they were destroying all the other airplanes in between of the first two hours of that war and moshidayan said there will be said no words no words and not one information from one pilot to the total silence seventh seal total silence and what happens when they were destroying this the egyptian radio brought false information they said israel is now they are losing they are losing their and israel was speaking to jordan's king by the name of hussein they said don't you enter into that war and hussein jordania took care of the temple mount when brother blame said now israel is back in their homeland yes and no because they didn't have the temple mount which is the heart of all things the the true temple worship so when when when jordania heard the false information from from from egypt they entered into the war because they thought israel is finished anyhow that was the reason that israel could attack the temple mount and get it brother brahm said the greatest fraud for the church is a false light that's all but the greatest disaster for the enemy was a false information in the six days war so they entered all and did not know that israel already destroyed completely all the airplanes of of the egyptians and so forth so when that happened that they came to the whaling war you can see today on youtube the generals begin to cry and they just said the temple mount is in our hands and they were just crying they were just singing israel because they understand this is now the fulfillment of the scripture not only social israel but now back to the temple mount and what happened is this here is the uh rabbi he's taking the shofar the shofar is not but that happens on yom kippur amen that means god fought for israel bringing them back to their homelands god fought for israel bringing them on the temple mount today there's two people that you the two kind of people that you don't have to uh that you don't have to that are extremely secure one is israel in the hand of god and one is the bride can you say amen so what happened we see how god enters on history in history how he brings the bride into their position and how he brings israel into their position according to the will of the lord can you say amen why is this so important i mean the judgment of god a king was asked the question i think the king of jordania samaria judea it belongs to who to the israelites or to the palestinians he said it belongs to god it belongs to god and god has a right to put in that country who he wants the bride belongs to god you're not belonging nobody can preach you in nobody can put you out brother branham please explain us when i'm finishing please explain the mystery of the translation of the bride it's a word in the bride and it will be materialized around that world it's not our efforts we do the best thing for holiness for the baptism of the holy ghost coming to church reading the message that's all true but it's not sufficient it's not sufficient we have to understand we need a lot we need something supernatural so how how did this happen now we have no abraham and sarah and god speaks to you to them you will have a son one day now both are getting old now the day comes when three men come to abraham abraham sees exactly who that is that was god one was just billy graham the other one was all robert but the other one was the son of man and a son of man he knows exactly who's standing there exactly so so they just start a little conversation keep one thing in mind abraham must have thought i hope he does not ask now about that promise because there is nobody god all the time knew one thing abraham you will not make it because i made sarah sterile stereo god knew that god gave him something to do in you you will not make it and and i can see abraham he was so embarrassed here a lot we tried everything uh everything off of fertile institute and we we we went at this seminary and this seminary but not nothing worked really and god was just thinking about himself i know i know i made it impossible for you made it impossible because it was me making sarah sterile [Music] so so so everyone said and we went to church and we were praying and we were praying and god said yeah yeah yeah yeah but it had to be the appointed time [Applause] i had to come amen it must be god do you understand this message is not you have to work yourself more and more and no more brother and if i know the seventh seal i got it that's not it sometimes people have a wonderful understanding but have an arrogant spirit but we need a reality of somebody really so in tune with god that he comes you can say he she is him and he is her and god knows one thing my little children i'm i'm i'm i'm love to see you all what you can do but the rapture you will not make it i must be your rapture martin luther found out he is my justice john wesley said i served him more than ever john john wesley didn't say okay okay ah i understand so we go in the pub next week no no he was he was more fervent than ever but he changed his attitude he said i will not do it to to achieve anything for god but i do it because i accept the love of god for my life therefore if you'd if you are legalized by love continue that way if your legal is by pharah to be a pharisee you know brother i'm so happy in our circle is different it's different forget it it must be the love of god and if you see something wrong on your brother and your heart goes lord help my brother there's too much worthiness around it help him brother that is the love of god bringing us up can you say amen therefore and then god comes and he said how could i hide to abraham all these things knowing he goes in the rapture [Laughter] this is a tremendous time a person says uh brother marcus i want to tell you one thing i'm not in the bright age bright age is part of laodicea there's no contradiction at all it's part of it all is on top of it but it's connected both brother marcus i want to let you know one thing i am in loud is here i said that might be but not me it's complete it's correct what you say but not for me because i understood shalom good morning the night is over in finnish good morning church brother bennett was the star in the night but there was a change in the king of the light what is it's the sun it's here what time it's the rising of the sun and brother brahem says it like this he says he says that stone that was holding jesus he said that was denominational things and god came with an earthquake in our time and rolled that stone away and he says this he took away the stone from us that we understand who we are and we read the message and we understand hey hey and we look in the mirror and we say mama hey that's me that's me i see myself i'm not better than anybody else but that's me can you say amen once you see the love of god you're not judgmental you cannot because you understand it was just god alone no you we're stopping on our you know we we are a little bit better than the rest forget you didn't get the picture no you didn't get the picture and because you know our sleeves are long and our forget it sometimes people can have a wonderful appearance but the inside i tell you you just want to shake his hand from 30 meters god bless you shalom you understand it what we need this message is not a doctrine it's a heart of god revealed god wants to look down on his children he said now they understood what love is love is not a feeling lot is love is a person abraham was so in love when lot was in that situation he was just running after him blessed be the name of the lord can you say amen oh the justice of god he is my justice he is my rapture he is my holiness amen blessed be the name of the musicians would come and and and and and and hallelujah amen if the musicians would come amen can you say amen amen in this message what a message from our father this message has heart and soul i mean this message is more than just i know this and i know that no brother blame said complex has come by knowledge some thinks he does more than the rest so i cannot you know i cannot be really fair because you know we're a little bit forget man i mean our our father was so great he just reached down became one of them and jericho i know but i do it for our color for black people for the first time yeah and they never saw me preaching i know you saw it 10 times that i was making it but there was a young just to show how our father is and i tell you one thing if you're the son of your father you will get that nature but it takes time it takes a little bit of life experience takes a little bit being in that sun to become ripened you know here's a young man and he wants to buy some dog i mean and and the owner of the dogs he comes down and the boy says i want to have this dog and the owner says hey what do you want with this dog i mean he cannot walk he can he's handicapped he he's not cheater he has no words what do you want that dog and when the boy he was putting up his trousers from his knee on he had an artificial leg and the boy said i want to have this door because when we go out he understands me and i understand him and brother brahm says this quote brother branham god became man to understand man quote brother branham god became teenager to understand the teenagers that when you pray god knows what you talk about you can even talk about lust or whatever you can talk with your father he knows what it is because he was a human being what a father therefore the rapture is not that god is just standing there okay bcf maybe amen amen the rapture is not god is just seeing who will make it the raptures our father comes and takes me home it was not elijah searching for that chariot but it was the chariot searching for elijah your own theophany will pick you up one day it's not far away it's exactly there blessed be the name of the lord if our earthly tabernacle will be dissolved we have a building from god not merited not we were born with it [Applause] and all our christian life is the expression of our gratitude to god so you can wish well to every sinner you can just say i don't agree with you but can i make life easier for you i maybe i will preach one day i'm always in contact even with people who left the message or left left our church i believe our young people are still part of us we still are responsible for them so i'm just sending a little whatsapp how are you doing and then you see the mindset that they have and brother marcus and i wasn't in church on sunday i said that was not my question my question is how are you doing the mark is next sunday i come lying anyhow because lying anyhow oh okay okay i will come i write back hey that's not the question i didn't ask if you go to church i saw that you wanted we have a little outro of 20 people i mean i'm over 50 i understand i'm getting older but 20 people i keep in mind who was in church or not 20 viewers fine okay so so i write back hey i'm interested in you how are you doing not if you're just a church member you're a person you're a personality you are you what are you doing can i help you yes but i have my troubles with no i'm not interested in trouble can i help you and then i'm leaving if they'd say nothing i say look if you need me you let me know i'll be there yes but i don't come don't that's not the question you are you i know you're from from sunday school we're friends we were friends we all be friends you see that is how god was with us do you know one thing we did a lot of trouble to our father a lot of things a lot of foolish things i'm a minister and i'm ashamed of some of the things that i did not willfully but we didn't have the maturity yet no we didn't okay god knew it in the beginning but i believe my father was never ashamed of me no he said look that boy one day once he sees it he becomes a different man yeah amen therefore we need a lot of grace for one another do you see something there's message people that cannot forgive they cannot forget amen they always have a story to tell you say brother you're a wonderful preacher but the main thing is missing her you're missing the main thing you don't get the thing you didn't get the core of that message you don't know what the love of god is you always have to tell what people had to do and what then how you suffered that's fine it takes time healing of the lord but it cannot be your whole life stop it i mean you have a father can you say amen therefore do you have the song i have a father do you know it i know they know because i'm always singing it you know the song you understand i'm a little bit here at home okay it's such a it's such a liberty that it's just wonderful and you see even these starchy germans from time to time you know i i was i was one time in in another church maybe the brother will remember uh uh years ago and the pastor it was my first time there and uh he he he took a little bit too much time i respect places you know but he took too much time as he felt and he said oh we understand we have brother marcus here he's one of those hitler boys and i was in the office what kind of impression did i give i'm a christian i'm a brother not a hitler boy man you see but you know one thing the difference between god's mind and your mind here's here is uh job quote of the bible curse be the day when i was born cursed be the day and god at the same time says do you see my servant job there's nobody like him the best man on the earth job says curse me god says i'm so it's such a wonderful man you have to see yourself like god sees you that will transform us in the in the love of god not who is the strictest but love brings automatically holiness decency but the source must be love understand who you are understand somebody pay the price for you [Music] when we were unworthy god said this is my son i'm therefore we treat brothers like this we see that things are going wrong but we just bring him to the hand of god and say heavenly father you had much patience with me help my brother that can you say amen what a father we have what a message we have rather we're so proud not arrogant but it's a pleasure to serve the lord brother marcus what is your doctrine as for me and my house and my heart we serve the lord amen that is our doctrine near oh my god to thee amen and i know that i'm now speaking to people who have exactly the same vision so god bless your noble hearts shalom shalom [Music] he calls me what a time [Music] he knows my name he knows me [Music] [Music] i half a maker i have a name [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he knows my name is [Music] [Music] now while the music is softly playing i would ask you to you can stay seated if you want you can stand if you want but close your eyes please and i would ask the camera not now filming into the audience if that is if i can do this brother franco and the team it's a holy moment of and if somebody's here who just wants to say i want to raise my hands to the lord i would say heavenly father change me from the doctrine to the reality change me to be in the image of my own father thinking like you being like you lord help me let me have that same vision that martin luther had that john wesley had that brother branham had that the first apostle had the lord is my joy the lord is my justice not that i'm better because i'm knowing a little bit more than my brother and if i feel that i know more than my brother lord let me be a help for those who don't see it [Music] never let me have an arrogant spirit of his people even when it comes to sinners lord you have everybody in your hands who am i to tell who is who you are the almighty is there anything too hard for the lord father in heaven so we raise our hands to you and ask just enlarge that vision i believe and i'm sure his eagles this evening family of god royal family but i'm speaking to myself sometimes we are caught up in our human ways our human feelings our human disasters sometimes but lord you always take us a little bit higher into that higher dimension of seeing what's all about lord we have a lot of problems among us and most of these problems we will not solve them we have to live with them but give us grace to always keep our head above all circumstances no matter what comes on this earth no matter what goes but lord let us have a clear vision of who we are lord if when we are attacked when we are in nervous frustrations let us never react because we will say things that we shouldn't say we will do things that we should never do and lord i think about myself we did a lot of mistakes please forgive us father it's not that we sinned but we didn't see the real picture about the whole thing we didn't see the bigger picture we thought our picture is a true picture but you have a you have a family father family is not only me you have many brothers and many sisters lord let me be a blessing for my brothers and my sisters when i talk when i don't talk when i meet somebody let me be a blessing to them let me be an encouragement for those who lost their courage father never be never let me be religious father but let me be a light [Music] in this darkness father let me be a hope for somebody who has no hope let me be an anchor pointing to a christ to a message to a word in our age that takes us in our true position father lord i thank you and overall i ask for our most blessed pastor brother chad may you bless him our most noble friend
