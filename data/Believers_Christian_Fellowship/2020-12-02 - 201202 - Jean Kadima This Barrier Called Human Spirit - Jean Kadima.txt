TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth and healing in her hands god has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth healing in her hand [Music] i forgot oh it's jesus it's jesus that i really want to see and the more i see [Music] want to see [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i belong to jesus [Applause] of is amen as brother john would come this evening let's just sing he's my lord [Music] my lord and he'll give rest [Applause] to there's no doubt there is [Music] if there's no doubt about it praise god let's bow our head with a prayer heavenly father we can do too many too many things too much we cannot pray too much once again we're inviting your presence to come in a mist and take control of the service you're the author of the word father we we went to school we can read but it takes you to give us the contest it takes you to give us the inspiration so we're calling upon your name tonight father because your children did not come to hear from a man but they want to hear from you give them the desire of their heart father speak to them the way only you can do that so we just commit ourselves to you use us as a tool in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen thank you musicians let's just go straight to the word um we're going to look at romans chapter 7 verse 21 well-known verse when well-known scripture [Applause] romans chapter 7 is on the screen too i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members wearing against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death may god add this blessing to the reading of the world you miss it you may take your seat i want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ it's always a privilege to speak to his bride so um you uh you pray for me and uh so god can take all these things that sometimes he pulls on the preachers and god can can streamline them so it can make sense when i'm getting them that makes sense you can really enjoy it but now you gotta give it to the people so we really need him here hey man okay i'm gonna read a portion of uh push a quote let me take a quote again this is uh powerpoint so there are things that i don't want to see now they appearing so but let's just go with this one questions and answer uh 64 brother bernam say the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man brother branham is explaining to us romans chapter 7 21. this to the story is they are too being within ourself excuse me for the terminologies they may not be completely right and they are fighting and the the inside outside men need to ignore and accept i mean you have to ignore the outside man which is your conscience which is your spirit the human spirit and accept the inside man who is the soul now that the same thing paul speaking of uh he was sold under the law of lord to colonel sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have the troubles we do of marriage for five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are colonel and that part must perish but when inside we are a spirit man's soul inside that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said that's the challenge amen and that's the challenge that uh is in front of us but if god speaks to us it means it give us the power of transformation so badabanam continues and how can i take a cocober and make a grain of wheat out of it it is impossible for me to do it the only way i can i can be is because inside that cocoa bird has been transmitted from clockwork with a coca bear to a germ called with life then you bury that coco and it will produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocoa bird and and the life of cocoa bear has been taken out but the nature of the cocoa bird is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again so we we know these things but uh it looks like that's the direction the lord wants us to go tonight so we're going to just talk about them so what is it is say that this nature that we have is a allowed by god permitted by god it was not his perfect will so god what he does is when he wants us to have a different nature he has to put his own nature in us that's why he called the wheat grain uh in this old old cocoa bird that we our natural natural spirit represent and when god does this then the coconut life is transformed into the wheat life however since it's not the original the sticky nature of that cocoa bird remains and that's the fight and that's why tonight i want to call my message uh this barrier called human spirit this barrier called human spirit all right um and when it it comes forth then it's no more coco bird but wheat but wait but while it's here on earth uh in out of the earth and a coca bird is still sticky but it got the nature on the inside of it of wheat and as long as you are in this life you are going to be sticky and have a colonel nature that is going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you are born again and when you raise up you are in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you that's the thing amen so that nature even though you are born again you love the lord you want to serve him but that at the nature is sticky and it's going to bother you and the more you mature in the lord the more it impossible but you gotta fight it with the tools that are already inside you that god gave you yes this is what the prophet says again about that uh the thirst in 1965. like paul say describe as in romans chapter 7 21 when i would do good then the evil is nigh when are you trying did you ever had that inexperienced christians that when you're trying to do something that is worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is the devil and on every hand just to upset you everything that you and that's one good thing that i would like to say this that christians might know that when when you are starting to do something there is something always trying to upset you in doing it do it anyhow amen and sometimes we say it it's not the will of god because i tried before brother oh brother but i'm saying no that's not right he say that's the devil they're trying to keep you from doing what's right now how many times i meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they found out that they're trying to do something and everything is just blocking it off on both sides they say it might not be the will of the lord see now don't let the devil lie to you like that the first thing is find out whether it's the will of god or not it's not when there are obstacles it means not the will of god not necessary and when and then if you want to know whether it's the will of god look into the bible look into the word and find out because he will never contradict the word if he's the will of god there is the thing that this that sets you straight is the word of god and then if you see it's in the word of god for you to do it do it amen ah actually but continues like for instance seeking for the bodies of the holy ghost many times i've run into people say well i have sought for the holy ghost and i just could not receive it i don't believe it's for me every time i get down i i get sick and i go to praying if i fast i get sick and if i try to stay all night i stay i stay up i get so sleepy you know that's a good medicine when you say you don't sleep at night just try to pray you're gonna sleep i get i i can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because god intends you to do to have the holy ghost it's for whosoever will amen so we have laid out um romans chapter 7 to see the battle that is taking place and will take place until we leave this world it will be there so let's be prepared let's have a strategy if i can say that amen so this barrier called a human spirit i don't want to say that the human spirit is not good it's actually good because if you don't have it if he leaves you dead if a baby is born and that spirit is not in that baby that baby is still born therefore we have so many stillborn babies in churches because the spirit did not get in so this human spirit that i'm talking about is not a bad thing is what gives us to become a living soul because this is a human spirit that comes from the lord however it's uh not subject to god to his word and our prayers are effort when we listen to the word and we pray is to subject it to the word so what about him explain to us that spirit you know 1963 the flashing rate of this sign of is coming the moment when a mother is fixing to have a baby you notice you don't care how cruel she has been and how mean you know a while before that baby is born the mother gets gentle why is it when them little muscles in that womb is preaching and jumping like that there is a heavenly body waiting for it so brother branham call it the heavenly body but that's the human spirit but is it is the body is a spirit that was predestinated for you and when it comes from the mother the doctor or the midwife whoever it has to pick it up and shook it and spank it shake it and something and then it catches the breath of life and the the little angelic spirit comes into it the breath of life and he becomes a living soul and brother now compared to the the uh the holy ghost when it comes to a human being and he say and when we have christ in our heart and christ becomes real in our heart it's a little baby if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved then you have another one that one is different amen when this life if you have received christ in your life and this life we're living in now is resolved dissolve you have another one but the spirit you will get on the other side will be different from this spirit we have here today amen continuing uh with kind of laying down laying up laying down the uh kind of for that foundation but that's our subject tonight yeah um 1964 questions answered number four now while this little body is being formed little natural body being formed in the mother there is a spiritual body of the earth now you see is it heavenly spiritual body but is of the earth to receive this natural body as soon as it's born now the baby is born with live muscles and beating heart but no breath of life in it it's it's muscle twitching see then see if there was something different from that if there wasn't a spirit that had to come into it later then our breath could leave us and we would breathe no more and still be alive but when this body doesn't receive oxygen from uh or breath in taken out outtake uh of our lungs then we are dead so therefore we thank god for giving us the spirit amen it is important it keeps us alive um if a man when a man when it leaves a man the man dies that's what i wrote down when it leaves a man the man dies so it's good it's important for us to carry it but it's a spirit that fights the word of god it's a spirit that can carry on it evil a spirit too ah it's a spirit that you know is a wonderer spirit sometimes that the prophet has to uh to say okay we want to start this church we want to start prayer i have to take all the spirits under my control for the glory of god then it's you see is uh when they wan it's wanderer it's kind of if it's out of uh order it's kind of bothering the the prophet like he has to fight to pray for the sick for to have the discernment and that's what we want tonight and is to get this spirit to be sub subject to the lord amen amen now as i say here that when he leaves a man he dies it means that spirit goes back somewhere he was given to us so we can live in this life and when he leaves us it goes somewhere bharapanam talks about an experience in a message called the angel of god you may know the story he said this and the doctors knew he was dead this is a brother named elijah he was dead the doctor say okay he's dead now we're waiting for somebody to come and bring him to the funeral home or something and he say i want to offer sympathy to the family and starting out of the house the wife seemingly crying of the man and as i started out the door a human hand seemingly touched me by the arm the man is dead brother branham goes to comfort the family now he finish he's now leaving he want to go home a hand stops him don't go and i felt it to hold i i felt it hold me and as i started forward i could not move when i turned back the hand left me i went to the bedside and looked down upon the man there was a methodist minister's wife in the room and another sister and i start to have prayer so brother brahm is praying for this man this is what happened why i put this um and when i come to myself brother bernami is lost in prayer and i was laying on this man body the dead man had a over his face for at least half an hour my face was laying right against him and i was calling out into the spirit land there is a land called a spirit land where our spirits come from right and i was calling out into the spirit land brother elijah his name was elijah brother elijah calling out into the land of his spirit not knowing what i was doing in a few moments i i laid still calling i felt the man's hand coming up around my ears the man is working on the pennsylvania railroad tonight alive amen he called him from the land of the spirit he had god is using the prophet to even go into where the our spirit comes from and calling it calling it back to this life this is not the thing that is that is going to was not brother branham just giving us the premise of what the bride will do because the words say that we are the final voice it means the word the denominations don't have the word anymore god can use them they are not the mouthpiece of god we are the mouthpiece but literally can we also be that voice that calling the other churches to come into resurrection how could brother branham called elijah come and go search for him in the dead and bring him here and we can see it in the message uh the rapture 65 now it's the first thing is this sounding the first thing is the trumpet in the voice and the shout and then a voice and then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice that a loud voice in john 11 39 and 44 that called lazarus from the grave so i don't know about this i was looking at it and i say you know that voice that calling the dead to life was in the brother permit was it just for brother branham was it just for verbum to amuse us how can a moral calling other models to life could that be that we will call the other ages back to life because his voice is in us the same voice that called lazarus come to life will that be that same voice we within us my if that is the case sir what a responsibility giving life all the seven church ages that went to sleep are waiting for us to call them back my what a responsibility and to look forward to that day amen and it is already here because all these things are in the world it's the word that will call the dead to come and it's that word that need to be to take this spirit our spirit into subjection i want to insist on this because it's very very important we have received a human spirit that is of the world is colonel it doesn't obey to god it's like a fence when god wants to do something to you when god wants to do something good to you it's he has to go over the fence to bless you because of the human spirit resist god it's like a fence is is a problem and you can see it in brother branham's life it's it's like a fence now when he goes to preach to people first of all just when he opens his mouth people already know his grammar is not good his vocabulary the way he builds his verbs and the nouns you know then he he knows this and he start by addressing the human spirit because it's a barrier to receiving the word because the word does not go straight from the preacher to your soul it goes to your natural ears he goes to your natural spirit before you get to your soul therefore the prophet knowing that he has to prepare the people because a spirit that is not prepared is not ready to receive god and brother say that even this your spirit can get that's all the spirit cannot get along with you how can it get along with god so therefore verbum will try to help the people okay he will say to them for example i'm not educated but i have a message amen i'm not against the nomination i know maybe they heard that this man speaks against the nomination is already a barrier that barrier will not let them receive what god has for them that day so he's going to address that i'm not against your denomination they're good but i'm against the system of denomination i have friends in all the nominations i will tell them that i have a message god send an angel for me if i don't stay true to that message i will be a hypocrite you may disagree with me but we still brothers what is doing is working to to bypass to go over that fence that barrier amen and then he will he will now bring the people to listen to him now is the anti-zoo is a kentuckian language is not the problem anymore now they can listen to him they have they he has just bypassed that barrier and he i'm not talking history now day by day god wants to talk to us we hear the message every time we come wednesday sunday but what barrier can that be the human spirit can not allow us to fully benefit from what we hear day in day out by god's grace we want to pray and look at ourselves and say god help me because i cannot say that me since i have the holy ghost i don't have the human nature it's still there it has the sticky nature of the bird therefore what hinders me to receive the plain bene benefits of the word of god i'm hearing every day there must be something god help me because that nature is there is a sticky nature it will continue until we leave this world is that right let's just continue now here is the brother brand i'm talking to them in the message from that time on from that time in 1962 here is preparing them now now i'm not the preacher his brother but i'm not the preacher you know i'm not i have not the education to do it to become a preacher you have to be educated was peter educated but he was a preacher right but he is going along with the human spirit well let me agree with them that i'm not a preacher maybe they will you know they will listen to me now but you know i already told them i'm not a teacher because i'm not educated i'm not this i'm not this and then sometimes oh you know sometimes i feel reluctant standing here by men of god who's called to the office please brother branham they are apostle prophets teachers pastors and evangelists not all our apostles not all our prophets not all our teachers not all evangelists i'm standing here now he's trying to show them i'm not a preacher i'm just a little little guy he's preparing his healing he is trying to look at the human spirit it could be a barrier for the word of god to be planted therefore speak to them prepare them and then hopefully there will be some that can now listen to the world now he will start talking about his ministry say but my ministry and i i know this i know it because i listen to many messages and you know it you say they are apostles they are doctors they this they're that i am not one of them and me my ministry i say yeah is going to say my ministry is to pray for the sick really really and i'll say 1933 when he re when that voice come came on the ohio river was it to pray for the sec now is he going to say that that yeah you know what my ministry is to pray for the sec i'm listening it was sunday i was coming to church and i would put the tape and we come with the family and i'm i'm listening i i'm just prepared is going to say my ministry is to pray for the sake then uh but we say but my ministry is now different minister from a pastor teacher i am not i i i say think wrong again forgive me i don't mean it but this is my ministry to declare him that is here whoa this is good this is good because brother brethren you cannot be too humble because if you're too humble then we will miss something like this my menace is to declare him that he is here that's our ministry too that's your ministry to declare him amen amen my the spirit of human spirit is such a barrier i don't know when we were in heaven you have asked a good spirit god gave you a sweet spirit but no matter what's how sweet the spirit is is still need god it still needs the word because it's a natural it's a carnal spirit no matter what it is we it is always a resist god-perfect will let's go to a question and answer 64 0a brother branham here let me set a little bit stage here it's the same thing that brother branham is trying to help someone who has a an issue but being a prophet you can see what the problem is it's still the human spirit so he's going to help him now you will say but brother branham is not here tonight i'll say the word is here tonight so the word will discern the issue that you have what are you struggling with but ask god the grace that when the word comes the face and the barrier that you have will not go against it because he speaks still small voice every day wednesday sunday be very careful let us be so real and ask god for that grace because it's so god speaks to us daily it's amazing what god does sometimes oh my now he says now in this speaking tongues and so forth i wished everyone of you spoke in tongues i should do and many times good christians and you see if i tell you that was on the program i found someone not program excuse me on the interview this morning a person i i guess they're still here in the building that about speaking with tongue the person is genuine person and they're real person they lived right and they've they've heard me say that the evidence of the holy ghost was not speaking in tongues and it's not but i advise that person to ask god to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because of its the nature brother branham constantly say speaking in tongues is not the evidence it's not the evidence you have the holy ghost but he turned around and said to a person after looking at the person and say for you because of your human nature which is such a barrier for you ask a god so you can speak in tongues and then when you speak in tongues then that barrier that now the word will go over because he has satisfied a human you know desire and then it can now allow the word of god to go through my no but when i'm saying that the first thing i went to that person found their birth place amen i found them where they're born has an impact on you on the human spirit and that sign they were born under the star the day you were born influenced your human spirit and could tell what the birth was i couldn't even say when they were born which way is set in the natural natural nature set them in a certain line wow then when they're reborn again they're over here in another nature and then when you find into this nature that the inside the conscience that's the soul inside consider the outside conscience that the spirit human spirit moves you in one way that's your natural birth then they will make up something and it's put them what under if put them in a split condition they don't know what to do they will say the lord wants me to do this right when i'm keep talking about other things here but you see the prophet is a revealer of the word of god written in the bible the prophet is a revealer of the word of god written in the zodiac the prophet is the revealer of the word of god written in the pyramid is written in the bible you don't know what he's talking about it's a revealer of the word written in his own life he can see what is written in the zodiac for a person and he can tell that person to overcome the human spirit you do this you ask for god to give you speaking in tongues brother branham is not here the same word is here you also can go to your knees and you know what bother you i preached the message for very long time and sometimes we don't give credit to the believers they actually all know what is bothering them when they say this is my weakness they saying the truth and i i i started ministering or some years later i used to tell people when they tell me that i say no uh you okay no no no there is nothing wrong these people are spiritual they know what is bothering them since you know the same god who spoke to this man can speak also to you if you take time and you are sincere you are real god can speak to you and because of your nature he can say to you because of your nature i want you to separate from certain friends for example are you with me yeah you can do that because he knows your nature you can come to church and the pastor will heed it right and you will know god just told me to stop this to stop that because he knows my nature we are not we don't all have the same nature we very different different personalities and things but yet the world has to have an impact in our life the world must have an impact in our life what stops it sometimes it is our human nature that's right the human nature already say oh i know that this preacher is talking about me i'm not talking about that but it's already talking about me it's already a barrier right yeah is so judgmental it's already buried sometimes the prophet will say the devil is telling you to dis to to not to believe me to doubt to me he can hear it you can hear the spirit speaking i can tell people don't do that don't do that all right but it's not here but the word is here the same yesterday today and forever it's here we let opportunity pass us by it's time we go to our next amen god help me because this group mentality should not be among us we are not jews the jewish people is safe as a nation we are safe as individuals right it's a personal walk we cannot even copy other churches other brothers and sisters in our church and if we we cannot be like that and god you won't find favors with god by following what everybody is doing i hope you you agree with me you will shake my hand after service okay all right question and answer number three and explain the same thing i'll just keep going so you see the prophet is the revealer of a written word the word is even written in his own life you can see where you were born this zodiac but that same word is here amen it's here amen how we need we need to stop that wanderer spirit and keep it a little bit like peter and john say hey look at us because this with so much destruction but you know fix the they want to contact the spirit this is a human spirit is wondering look at us okay pay attention now you see okay we don't have a gold look-up pocket it's not gold okay no silver either but we have something right what what do you have ah they contact the spirit now now what we have is jesus christ in the name of the lord jesus christ stand up god is the same today too now in the message god being misunderstood the way a portion of questions and answers in that message brother branham i'm saved and have been baptized in the name of jesus christ but how do i get away from a stubborn spirit that i can't seem to break away from a brother like you and i saved yeah well my christian brother and sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that got stabbed in spirit it's usually a complex that causes this it's personality either they have inherited from a mother father uncle aunt grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you trace it back down through your life you will find as a prophet revere of the word of god i'm going to insist the word is here so we cannot be like oh if brother brother was here i know if barbara was here we will all be in jeffersonville the real estate market in jeffersonville to the roof they will say why we have so many people here when you go there you find everybody goes to that uh store that sells candies you know salvation in a candy a sister say that was not me a sister say that so we will all go there oh my that's why god took him i was telling the church one day i said i said the church we killed brother branham because everything will be brought upon him can you tell me where my keys are i lost my keys may god say take him because if i don't take him they won't read the message for themselves they won't listen so i gotta take him so i make them guilty we killed brother brennan sorry but you get the the idea now now i've taken this by experience we're talking about a stubborn spirit now i've taken this by experience under discernment because i've met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that spirit and the first thing you know how chase that split right back by discernment and finally was a granddaddy there was a grandmother jeans too jeans and there was somebody else back down there and you inherit inherit that by nature and very say stubborn stubbornness is not of god and now the only way to get away from is that is you have to have faith to overcome that you are a christian you you are a son or daughter of god whichever you may be and you will never be able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it you see brother bottom is telling you what to do because this person went to ask now brother branham is not there at the word still god is still alive i don't even when i read this i don't even know what this person is saying what is that stubbornness i don't understand what i mean but what about him got it right the word knows exactly how you feel the word knows what bothers you no he said it's just like a tantalizing uh a rare snake he's lying there ready to bite you if you just ignore him and walk away for him from him it can't hurt you i had used this in other things when the devil speaks to my mind i decided to ignore him it works yes just ignore him you're not a christian i'm a christian i'm going to church that's it you dissident no ignore him even when he convinced your mind you still ignore him because you're not just this you are that so when you feel that you got a stubborn spirit lay the thing on the altar and believe god that the thing is dead and you will never have it no more and go on don't even pay attention any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you people want to feel like okay is it gone he said no ignore it resist the devil and he will flee from you that get away quickly so that would be my advice how to overcome it we overcome the devil by faith that's why we overcome all evil is by faith you believe but you don't test it with your mind you don't test it with your reasoning because is of the this nature is not good because it's just like you are telling the devil do you agree that now i'm delivered from that thing he will never say yes [Music] church is a barrier i wrote down him in my note barrier to sincerity god values sincerity the prophet told us sincerity alone does not save you but when you have the word when you have the responsibility that we have adding sincerity is critical amen a few few weeks ago i decided to to fast and god knew that i decided to fast because i'm listening to something there you say okay it's like butterburner is being told um when you fast this time when you fast be more sincere wow so god knows that i'm fasting is using the same thing they told brother branham and they say be more sincere but sometimes words for me you know you know you know better with me but the word sincerity what that means you know what is it because if i go to the dictionary i can look for something that is opposite of sincerity so i can understand sincerity and when i go to that it didn't work because when buddha program was told by god that you have one a gift you will take somebody's hand and you will see the sickness on that person and you say if you are humble and sincere and i found that if the country of sincerity uh is a hypocrisy is it what he was telling him if you are less hypocrite now he didn't work for me so he didn't work for me but because the time is kind of flying so i didn't realize but so i realized it was not that sincerity is about the intensity that you doing things how real you are is it just formality to comply then that's not it so the contrary of sincerity in this case was to be more passionate about what you do to be more real it was not to tell brother branham you've been hypocrite now you've been fake uh now you need to be more less fake and uh no it's deeper than that as you reading the message you find out that's the primary definition of sincerity is this one but the the real one that it is it's more about how it approaches god how at the the level of your devotion that's sincerity because you can just do it because i have to do it but you got to be more sincere than that sometimes is sincerity versus dullness dullness you're not really interested you have no real enthusiasm about it sincerely like do you mean business yeah it's not like the the parable of the investment when a man say to god you know god the boss give them money to invest one of them doesn't invest then you say anyway i know you you take what doesn't belong to you even if i don't invest it you'll be okay you know god will take care of everything everything is just in god's plan let's go to bed sleep because it will happen anyway sincerities i mean business i mean it and god loves that you get favors from from the lord when you do this yes brother favors from the lord i i receive everything by grace yes i am the greatest beneficiary of grace you should say that the same amen too but that doesn't does not stop it you know i was not read because the time is just flying but we always talk about sister ahati right we always say she say the right thing but sometimes we don't talk about before she say the right thing what was going on in her life for example we can see that the church was a building they're building a new place they they want to build a new building if i can say that and then since hearty ride took five she took uh 50 dollars to give for the building and the deacons or the trustees say no no sister you cannot do that this is six months of your salary how can we do this she he she forced she ended up giving twenty dollars it's still a lot like two months of her salary she gave it for the building and and when brother brown heard it he had money in his pocket he want to give her back that money and when he tried to give to her god said don't you do that but that night she said the right thing we don't talk about that he was real that's sincerity god is moved but that that real life god is moved by it but when we do things in the group how can you obtain favor by just following the group i'm not saying following what the other people do is necessarily wrong but usually we find that is we taking other people's spirit on ourselves instead of the holy ghost we taking other people's spirits on ourselves and we don't have favors with god i found out everything many things that we hear by the pronoun third pool this happened that happened before that happened it is always something and when you watch it it's people being more real in the devotion passionate about god then god does it look at brother woods bank woods and his brother lyle we know that brother branham called to life a fish is that right but do you know what happened before he does that they were talking they say when we were younger we used to visit a woman nearby she must be old now in her 90s but when we were younger she will give us bread with butter it was delicious we ate it and she spoke to us about jesus we ate the bread but we didn't take the word but she kept doing this but now we are christians we need to go tell her that we are now christians god was a move by this thankfulness but this you know love to appreciation of the work that woman did she did not see the fruits but the fruit were following and when they say it brother heard the voice telling him stand up and speak and he spoke and said a little animal will be raised to death and from death a little animal will be raised what we hear that a little fish was brought back to life but what was the story behind the story behind it was a real christian life seriousness with god god help us i i i was even thinking about sister media i i listened to a biography about her but the the reality is yes she was predestined to be married to the prophet yes you are protested to to a lot of things yes you have this god will fulfill his will in you but you know israel god had them to go to the promised land in four days they ended up not going after 40 years eventually they got there but that was not the way god wanted i look at sister media she was about 12 years old she's a she she she was at the uh the river ohio river when the angel came down and brother branham say close the eyes she listened to what her pastor said she closed her eyes when other people will say well i have my opinion the pastor can say this i have my opinion you know this is america brother yeah but she when the time came for her marriage came she brother balaam didn't want to get remarried and he opposed it in different ways but she went and asked god she said god speak to me through your bible the urim team you know when she opened the bible she saw that i will send you malacca i will send you elijah the prophet in malachi 4 was not that what she heard on the river that day was not that voice spoke when she closed her eyes other people did not close their eyes so they did not hear the voice they saw the light they didn't hear the voice because she obeyed what the pastor told her she closed her eyes she heard of the the message saying that as john the baptist was saying i'm sending you with the message for the second coming of christ so when he reads it at first she could not understand she read it she saw that yes that same voice that spoke to me in ohio river that is in the bible so i will marry whatever it's all over the place maybe we have wrong understanding of the grace of god god wants every christian to be real he wants you to say search me see if there is anything and help me to overcome that search me lord you are the porter i am the clay you know how you made me you know what type of spirit you gave me you know this personality i have you know this berry you know my genes my everything and you have the word and the word can correct me i need you it's a matter of life and death that's why sincerity then that i was talking about uh fasting that day that very day when i heard like you need to be more sincere and then the same day was like you walking with too many people i knew what he was telling me it's a group mentality it is a village mentality cultural mentality why do you do it the people in the message do it is what the prophet say well well what is it what the prophet said did you check what everybody does if is the message where are you going to hide you know you need to stand that day and say god i follow what you would say amen and saying that yeah in the message community there was this that won't work we need to be serious i uh i had that uh we don't talk about fasting and things like that but you you see the contest and when i came to church after that so it was like friday saturday i came to church guess what god had the message for me through the pastor he answered me i did not understand everything but he answered me when i was actually going like north he brought me up through the message anybody but a child was speaking just he was saying different sentences and hesitating at one point just like the prophet was doing in the tip i was listening who said god is speaking to me praise god so here i am i go out maybe i was looking for my uh my mother my mother-in-law and i see but a child coming from the side i never seen him coming from that side and i went but yeah this message was not just great but it was for me he said to me it was for me too [Laughter] then he said but do you can you take one of the service when i be out and that's how god does things like that it's not every time he has to do it this way but every every time we need favors from the lord amen and you cannot have it by just being a a church member well we need to close down i want a musician start coming uh god is wonderful when he was telling me you walk with too many i knew but something in me was like is it my mind where is god but later on it was god yes no we are not the jewish people they can go as a nation we are individuals and god value our personal life personal experience with him these things about complying you know formality and just no god is not in it but everyone was praying for a woman she has been through a lot of things prostitution alcohol this and that but bernie tells her you could be a wife of somebody what's going on and you have let a demon get in you and oh yes he say yes ah let's pray let's pray about it what can i do whatever say let's pray about it okay she went to her knees and she started praying a few minutes later she stood up and said okay okay i think i'm going to change now by the way i'm saying that again sincerity yeah she did it but what i'm saying was just a mental thing say you know yeah i will turn a new page you know december 31st is coming yeah turning a new page new year resolution you know it doesn't work but you do it anyway god is tired with these things formality he's tired he gave us so much responsibility now we gotta be real with it is that right yeah we gotta be real with it you will appreciate it now is the time to say lord you are the porter i'm just a clay you know how you made me mold me now make me into your images father help me and mean business he will do it amen absolutely will do it you know god only through experience we know we don't preach experience but you know god only true experience that's what the baptismal of holy ghost is is experience but our doctrine is based upon the word of god but you know god through what you're going through and it's not a group thing it's an individual one amen god help us yes well you just look like i have to stop okay right all right do you have a sunburn oh i give my completely to you fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my love [Music] let me live in all that's true i just i give my mind completely to you fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my life i just so take me teach me to be still [Music] [Applause] i give my [Music] fill me with your thoughts make [Music] let me live in all that's true precious heavenly father father this is a very important subject this is a personal subject i preach to myself father if there is anything if there is anything that bother me is the human spirit i appreciate you give it to me to be a living soul but it's constantly standing on your way it doesn't allow me to to devote myself to you to worship you the way you want me to worship you i come here father to accuse it to bring it to you and say i want to separate myself from i want to have it subject to you so you can mold me change me and make me into your own image father you are that porter you know of what material you are made of tonight if any of your children is crying out to you father from heaven listen to them fight and grant to each and everyone according to their desire because their desire is your word father they want to find favors from you [Music] it has nothing to do with their salvation they are saved but it has to do with pleasing you [Music] it has something to do with doing your perfect will and you say that the abraham was not blessed until it fully obey you grant to us but i know we have adam needs tonight but we asking for something deeper something that we can serve you with something to please you a true desire a passion to serve you not just being dull not just being passive but the real thing the real thing the genuine man that's what we are asking tonight father grant to us this let this church give birth let the people the young people everyone give birth to christ [Music] and we cannot do that christ was real we cannot do that without being sincere god granted to us we have been working with too many people they hinder our walk because when we work with too many people we cannot walk straight help us father through your grace and mercy commit this church in your hand take anything of of mine from your children leave your seed so you can reproduce according to his own kind your kind granted father in jesus christ's name we pray amen i give my mind completely to you lord fill me it all brand new change my love let me live in all that's true so take me take me teach me to be still [Music] show me your perfect [Music] fill me with [Music] let me live in all that's man let's all stand to say how much i appreciated the word tonight it spoke to me you know and all of us we we get things in this life and this this nature that we deal with and that we don't like but we got tools tonight on how to deal with it you know some of us we have a impatience you know some people are people pleasers they get in situations all the time and say things they don't even mean trying to make everybody around them happy or find themselves in compromising positions because they're trying to please everybody or you have some people who have to know everything you know and nobody no matter what story they tell i've got to tell one better right we all deal with these things right but what he was saying was be real and say god i recognize this in me and i'm laying it on the altar and i'm going to ignore that thing and i'm not going to have that in my life anymore but i just want your spirit to control me be real and be sincere amen see i don't want that thing anymore i don't want that old lying exaggerating spirit anymore i don't want any of those things anymore i'm just going to lay it on the altar and i'm going to turn and walk away from it lord and i'm going to trust you praise god you know when god did the things he'd done for us he didn't do it without sincerity when god came as his only begotten son and he lived a life of perfection before us and he died a brutal death to pay for our sins he didn't do it without sincerity when jesus was laboring in gethsemane to overcome he wasn't doing it without sincerity when god did everything he did he didn't do it without sincerity amen and the example we've had in our lives with the prophet of god amen a tremendously gifted man who god spoke to had visions he he knew what was going to happen he didn't live a life without sincerity but he was sincere and if god went through all of that and god was sincere and the prophet was sincere i want to be sincere i want to be more sincere i mean even even the prophet was told amen when he was talking about in the vision of binding the mamba he was told you must be more sincere and this was a man who was sincere but god desired for for this for this level that this prophet was going to have to operate at he desired he said for this you're going to have to be more sincere so it means there's something to sincerity it brings about a greater revelation a greater power another manifestation whatever it is because because in the vision i mean god could have just said this is what you're going to do because god could have made him do it but he said in order to do this you must be more sincere so that means there's something to sincerity it brings about something in the plan of god it produces something right amen and if that was the case there i wonder if it's the case now if the prophet in order to bind and lose had to be more sincere what about us living here today are we going to be able to move higher in the things of god into the position he's called us to and to the manifestations he's called us to without sincerity but for the prophet more sincerity brought another revelation another manifestation and i say i want to be more sincere god help me to be more sincere help me to make this message and what was preached here tonight make it everything not just something i heard that was good and i can go home and say i heard a good sermon but it's more than that it's my life it's it's who i am it's my identification and this this message of greater sincerity and overcoming the human barrier it's who i am it's what i want it's the desire of my life amen i want to be more sincere and i know you do too let's just bow our heads and say lord we're here lord you're the same yesterday today and forever and we heard you today lord and we recognize the barrier that's within each of us but you've given us a word to overcome that barrier lord you've demonstrated it in a life that was lived lord and you've showed us in the preaching how to overcome and lord help us to take that lord take it for a reality take it as coming directly from you lord and if we'll just simply trust in what you told us and obey we'll see you move in a greater way to overcome this barrier free us lord from this barrier god we heard you you're calling for a greater sincerity and i say along with the others that are here lord we want to be more sincere help us lord to be more sincere we want our devotion lord to be on you we want our time and our energy to be focused on things that matter we want to be more sincere lord help us [Music] help us to overcome that barrier of the human spirit and to see you lord to dedicate ourselves more to you to surrender in a greater way we heard you speak to us lord and now we're responding to what you said and we're believing it by faith and taking action and saying we receive it in jesus name we pray lord for our brother john that you bless him he gave of himself lord i pray to bless him and bless him as he travels home and bless his family for his surrender and his sacrifice you've already blessed us lord with your word and now i pray you bless us in the application may we take it lord and take it into ourselves and apply it lord with all the fervor and zeal that we have lord that it might be a living word not word that falls in our ears only and rattles through our mind but lord a word that drops into our heart and becomes part of us a reality lord we love you we thank you for that bless us as we go live through us lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen let's just sing a song as we're dismissed thee set my spirit free that i might praise thy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is my spirit free to worship thee set my spirit that i might worship please [Applause] flows [Applause] sing that song again but as we do let's be a little more specific we all know the things that we deal with you know some some of us struggle with vanity we're so worried about what everybody thinks about us that we're always trying to look good and always trying to get you know to be impressive to somebody or somebody to be impressed with us we want to look a certain way or say something or or some of us listen to too many voices and we're like like brother jean said we walk with too many and there's too many opinions and we're always confused we never know where we stand because we're always trying to listen to too many voices we all have something different there's a different barrier for each of us there's something we deal with but when we sing this song set my spirit free take that thing in your heart and say lord i want to be free from this i'm laying on the altar i want to be free from vanity i want to be free from pride i want to be free amen from being a people pleaser from hearing too many voices from being too timid i want to be free from all of these things from self-consciousness i want to be free from anger i want to be free from having a short fuse or a critical tongue or whatever it is if i haven't named yours you know the name of it don't wait for me to call it out but when we sing this song say lord i want to be free from that burial i'm doing what the prophet said i'm laying it on the altar with this song right here and i'm going to walk away and if that everything ever creeps up again i'm going to say that's lying because i've been set free in the name of jesus christ i'm not going to go back to that i'm going to walk away from it amen so let's sing this song with sincerity with the determination to be free from those things that are hindering us and holding us back and we'll sing this and we can sing this and pray and sing it with sincerity and sing it as we dismiss the sinners again send my spirit free that i might worship thee set my spirit free that i might praise thy name let all bondage go and let him slow set my spirit free to worship me said [Applause] [Music] [Applause] set my spirit free that i might praise thy name and let all bondage [Music] set my spirit free to worship cleave one more time said set my spirit free that i might freeze [Music] [Music] his word [Music] by his word i'll never fail it's by his word [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] it's by his never fail by his lover [Music] by his spirit [Music] i'll never fail by his spirits overcome by his grace [Music] [Music] his grace [Music] is [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursue we please in o lord unto you please let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursue be pleasing o lord unto you one more time let me
