[0:00] we can make a statement I believe
[0:02] everything that he said really what
[0:04] you're doing is just admitting that he
[0:05] is the authority and that's fine like
[0:08] that's step number one we got to get
[0:10] past that a lot of people
[0:11] haven't but just saying I believe
[0:13] everything that he said recognizing him
[0:16] as the authority and not knowing what he
[0:18] said to apply it to your
[0:20] life does that really do you any
[0:26] good there's going to be a lot of people
[0:29] on Judgment Day
[0:33] not arguing who the Authority for this
[0:36] age
[0:39] was Satan's going to be right there with
[0:42] them Satan knows God sent a
[0:45] prophet Satan knows who the Authority
[0:47] for this age
[0:49] was is that the promised word for the
[0:52] hour then
[1:02] I'm not trying to be dogmatic on
[1:06] it but I've just seen it for too many
[1:16] years this message is
[1:21] Christ he bled and died for this
[1:27] message if he bled and died for this
[1:31] message which did he feel was more
[1:33] important amen right so why would we be
[1:38] ashamed to say that we've come past the
[1:41] penalty that was
[1:43] paid he's the one himself who said
[1:46] that's more important I'm going to lay
[1:49] my life down for it right would it not
[1:52] be an insult to him to just say we're
[1:54] going to stay here we're going to stay
[1:56] here and preach the penalty's been paid
[1:58] the penalty's been paid the P's been
[2:03] paid
[2:05] and you know what that's equivalent to
[2:07] that's equivalent to going to the pawn
[2:09] shop giving the GU the $100 for whatever
[2:14] it is you pawned and then been like see
[2:16] you
[2:17] later that's
[2:19] right the price has been
[2:22] paid you've still got to take it you've
[2:26] got to claim it which was more important
[2:29] the $100
[2:30] or the item that you gave the $100
[2:33] for that's
[2:35] right this is the same
[2:38] principle and I've got the prophet to
[2:40] back it up he says not Calvary was the
[2:43] most Sublime portion of scripture but
[2:45] Revelation 55 was the most Sublime
[2:47] portion of scripture why because he knew
[2:50] the principle the price has been paid
[2:52] but if you don't take that which you've
[2:54] paid for why pay the price for it right
[2:58] why leave it in the pawn shop
