and modern events May clear by prophecy he says what time is it that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in the Methodist days the Baptist age we're living in the bright Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back and he promised to do it amen we've heard these things so many times but we don't want them to become so common that it's no longer exciting that God has turned the page because we're not in church ages anymore this is the bride age amen he says this is the end he said the messenger must come at the end of the age he comes at the end of the Pentecostal age and brother bear said the Pentecostal age is the old laodicean churches so at the end he doesn't come at the beginning he comes at the end what's he doing he's marking out a closing of something and Bridging the way through a gap into something else what's he bridging his way into to the bright age amen and the bride age is not another church age think about this it's not another church age amen sometimes people fight the terminology Brides They want to fight that because they say you're adding another church age it's not a church age it's a bride Age The Very term indicates it cannot be an additional Church age because it is a bride age not a church age not an eighth Church age called breath no it's a bride age it's something completely different than the church ages you had Church ages you had first church age second Church age you had uh laodicean Church we're not talking about church ages anymore there's been a breach Amen to get us from here to get to somewhere else and there's somebody standing in the gap of the breach indicating a change in time to take us out of church ages into bright age not an additional age good morning amen because there's there is no argument here there is no eighth messenger eighth there's no eighth Church age amen that brother bam said there is no Eighth Day it goes back to the first day amen so what is this addition what what comes at the end of the seven Church ages there is an age open amen it's not a new age it's actually an old age [Music] it's not a new age amen it's an eternal age amen it's not marked by time it is a position it's what the church was intended to be when it was birthed at Pentecost but it fell into the church ages and now coming out of the church age there's got to be another indication of a change in time and in every Church age God indicated the change in time with a messenger to come move from one to the other but in this layer of the cnh he was going to bring one at the end of the Pentecostal age to move us out of the church age into the bride age amen which is going right back to what the bride was intended to be at her very birth at Pentecost
