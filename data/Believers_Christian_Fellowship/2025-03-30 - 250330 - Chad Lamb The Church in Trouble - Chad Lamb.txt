don't know if all of you know I think I said something Wednesday but brother Ron ministered and couldn't imagine how difficult that was but he did a fantastic job and I appreciate what he say brother Ron and one thing that he said that really struck me and my wife and I talked about on the way home is brother Ron said I can't preach Judy garvin's funeral she already preached it and the way she lived and that had a lot of impact on me and then it makes you think what kind of sermon am I preaching for my funeral right now amen so it had a lot of impact on us and he and his brother spoke and his sister-in-law and a brother-in-law they all did a fantastic job and I I left encouraged and even some of the things that they were sharing uh from Sister Judy's uh prayer journal and Thanksgiving Journal were things that were on my heart for today so I was feeding and enjoying even the things that were being shared so it helped me so I appreciate you guys being there and we want to keep the Garbin family in prayer anden let's all Stand Together amen I have an interesting title today and I don't want it to scare you so it's just it might be scary at first but I want to preach on the church in trouble the church in trouble amen and this really this came from a conversation that I had I had a conversation with a a minister from overseas he had was going through some distressing things in the ministry and some things that he didn't understand and him and I were just fellowshipping and and as we were talking these were some of the things we were talking on and it was it was really uh edifying for me as well and and so I just wanted to share some of the the highlights from that conversation with you all because I found it to be quite a blessing so if you want to turn with me to Matthew let's turn to Matthew chapter 10 and we'll begin reading from Matthew chapter 10 Matthew chapter 10 verse 16 Jesus says to his disciples behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scorge you in their synagogues and you shall be brought before Governors and Kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall speak for shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the Father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved amen God bless you as you take your seats amen I can't imagine being one of the 12 disciples and being caught up in the in the great things that were happening around Jesus and the great ministry that was taking place and uh the Dynamics of the healings and the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders and all the things that were so tremendous and to come to this place where Jesus starts to instru his disciples and and I can't imagine it being anything but discouraging can you imagine somebody sitting you down and say listen this is going to happen listen they're going to hate you for my name's sake brother's going to rise up against brother and father against son and child against mother and all of these things are going to happen amen and they're going to imprison you and they're going to scorge you and they're going to do all of these things to you and I I just I just myself personally can't imagine what it would be like to sit there no wonder they had doubts when they watched The Miracles and the healings and everything that was taking place and they're like surely this can't be what's happening next but surely that was going to be what happened next but Jesus says but he that endureth to the end shall be saved so he's telling the disciples ahead of time that there is a walk coming that's going to require endurance this word endurance is the same word as patience so patience and endurance the same thing that there's going to the the Christian Life Is A Life That's going to require endurance anden we're going to have to endure unto the end and they that endureth to the end shall be saved um when Jesus says this it also by making the statement he also alludes to the fact that there will be those who do not endure to the end because he says those that endure to the end shall be saved if everybody would endure to the end he wouldn't have made the St statement the way he did so it shows that they wouldn't so when when I take the title of the church in trouble I I just I I don't get nervous but the reality is the church has always been right in the middle of trouble always has been always will be amen because it's the testing ground it's The Proving Ground it's what God uses to manifest his own nature and his own character and the message is your life worthy of the Gospel he says now let's watch look at Jesus just for a minute he was your your example I hope you're not getting too tired now look let's look at Jesus just a minute he was our example for I have given you an example that you should do to others as I have done to you now watch when he came into the world when there was more as much unbelief in the world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same and healing just the same never bothered him there was critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir what was his goal always do that which the father has written always do that which pleaseth him so brother R showing us now in the Life worthy of the Gospel that this is our example that that that the world Jesus was in had just as much unbelief if there ever was we can't say there's more unbelief now there's there's a mass amounts of unbelief but Jesus faced massive amounts of unbelief he was criticized from the time he was a baby he was accused of everything he was was accused of being born out of wedlock he is accused of being a bastard child he was accused of having a devil he was accused of having strange doctrines and and all of these things so he was misunderstood he was accused he was criticized uh uh in his lifetime he was forsaken he was betrayed he he he went through all of these things but brother Brenham said it never phased him it never bothered him oh my goodness I wish I could get to that place where nothing would bother me amen it's going to take a whole lot more grace because this cck bur nature I me I get bothered by a whole lot of things that NE bothered him and I don't think that it never bothered him ever that he was never troubled because we know that he was grieved amen when the Rich Young Ruler walked away we know that he was grieved when the disciples had not Faith amen we know that there was things that bothered him but it never bothered him in a way of deterring him it never bothered him away from his purpose from the objective from the goal amen he was steadfast Amen in doing what he was put on Earth to do regardless of the opposition criticism or whatever he had to face he he says there what was his goal always do that which the father has written always do which pleaseth pleased him let's uh go over to Hebrews chapter 12 I'm going to give you a few scriptures here and then uh share with you some of what we were discussing in our conversation with the brother Hebrews 12:1 says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us patience can also be swapped out with endurance same thing we got to endure [Music] so he said because we have so great a cloud of witnesses what is the cloud of witnesses what he just read in Hebrews 12 all the heroes of the faith those that through persecution and trial and in the face of great opposition they all held their faith and believed the word of God for their day and he's saying because of that let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy which was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin so he is our example but we he's telling us Let Jesus be our example but yet we have not striven to blood I mean we have not we have not been driven in the blood striving against sin we have never had amen we have never had to endure like he had to endure we never had to keep pressing like he had to keep pressing amen so let him be our example and all things so as he's our example I want to go back and go back to verse two and I want to catch something from the mindset of Jesus and in verse two it says looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith so Jesus is the author author of our faith he's the one who has actually given us our faith or written our faith and he's the finisher of our faith so it's not our faith it's his faith that he's written in our hearts amen and he's the finisher of that Faith now let's look again who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God so when we look at the cross the cross wasn't a light trivial thing amen he despised the shame of it the rejection the being stripped neaked to be spit upon to be to be mocked and scored and and hung up like a common criminal amen he despised the shame but what caused him to walk on Amen into that shame that he despised what was it when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane there was something he wanted to bypass and that was C that was the cross he said father if there's any way for this cup to pass me let it pass me and Thrice he asked him and every time he said but not my will thine I want to do your will but is there any way in your will that I can bypass this because he was despising the shame but what caused him to be able to walk forward into what he despised and didn't want and asked to bypass it was the joy that laid ahead amen he had a vision that went beyond the trial he had a vision and an understanding that went beyond the circumstance ances he was looking to the glory that lay ahead he was looking to the joy that lay ahead he was looking to what Redemption would bring the fullness of redemption when you and I and he would and all the children of God would be collected back upon the Earth in a restored Eden amen and the glory that God wanted from the beginning in his mind now established upon the Earth and he could look at that joy and because of that Joy he can endure the cross oh we've been given a message amen that takes the veil off the book so that we can look to the same thing he was looking at amen we could set our focus on the same thing Jesus was looking at amen because we now know what was the mystery in the back of God's mind what he wanted to do and what he wanted to do was restore Eden he wanted to bring back Adam and he wanted to bring back the woman and he wanted to restore them back in rulership on a perfect Earth that was in harmony under the subjection of the Son of God Amen and God revealed that mystery unto us and now we [Music] amen we can look to the same Joy Jesus was looking to and if we can look to the same Joy Jesus can look to can we endure our cross cuz remember Jesus told them amen If any man come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me oh man how many gths prayers have we prayed I mean I don't know about you but I've prayed a lot Lord please don't let this happen please Lord let me bypass this trial let me skip around it somehow or are you come and just wipe it off and make it go away so that I don't have to walk what it looks like I'm having to walk into but can we say but not my will thy will be done and can we what what gives us the courage to step forward into something that that could be painful or difficult or or hard to understand amen it's got to be the joy that lays ahead brother Bram says in the message God has provided the lamb he says but you know he was headed for Jerusalem going up to be crucified all the sins of the world was upon him and he was going to Jerusalem to be offered up as a sacrifice and they mocked and made fun of him and some of them blessed him and some of them cursed him just like there is in practically every meeting where he is at some is for him some is against him but he never seemed to bother him he had his face set toward finishing his course and on he walked steadily as he went on looking towards Jerusalem and 12 little men had him Garrison there trying to hold the crowds back and some trying to touch him and some screaming and making fun of him and so forth brother M tells us wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise he says wherever Jesus was there was always this mixed multitude we we'll read some quotes later that where he says this there was some for him some against him and some who didn't understand and didn't know were confused about what was going on and wherever Jesus was there was always this noise well the question is if Jesus is in our midst what do we expect what should our expectation be I find so many times that we wind up in this journey of life and in our Christian walk we wind up disappointed amen and the only way that we can be disappointed is when something doesn't meet our expectations that's the only way we can have a disappointment if I expected one thing and I received something than I than I expected then I'm disappointed but if my expectation is met there's no disappointment right so Jesus gave his disciples the correct expectation in this life you shall have tribulation yeah you will be hated by all men for my name's sake you know brother against brother and father and all of these things you'll be scor and and Jesus was trying he was trying to set the right expectation so when they come into this this trouble there would be no disappointment but guess what happened many of them were disappointed and discouraged amen and walked away amen because they expected brother BR says we expect Christianity to be a flowery bed of ease but it was never intended to be a flowery bed of EAS Jesus never said it would be none of the Apostles ever said it would be we were never told in the scripture that this was going to be smooth sailing and we never were told that coming to the message all of a sudden would erase all problems amen and there would no be no more trials and there would be no more noise Around Jesus right but there's many times that we get disappointed because of our expectation so I just want to have a Biblical expectation amen because we're going to have according to the scripture we're going to have to endure to the end and in order to endure to the end I'm going to take Jesus as my example in order to endure to the end I've got to have something to fasten my eyes on other than the trials of life I've got to have something to fix my Gaze on other than the trouble that surround the Church of God we've got to set our eyes on something else amen so that so that we don't get disappointed because I'm pressing towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ Jesus I'm moving towards the goal amen and these all of these things amen are things that are necessary to shape to mold to manifest to to do whatever God wants to do he told us they would be here brother B said they will be here Jesus said they will be here amen if you turn with me to John 666 just a different way of saying that John chap 6: 66 so turn with me to John 666 in John chapter 6 verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him we've been talking about this for a uh some time for the last several times we ministered we've been on the same theme but they were hearing hard sayings that they didn't comprehend and things that were hard to reconcile like Jesus telling them to eat his flesh and to drink his blood or to make it more difficult that if you see the son of man come from where he was before and and who was in heaven and it's just so things that the natural mind did not comprehend and they couldn't comprehend and didn't match what they understood and what they had been taught in the Bible and because of this contradiction they couldn't reconcile in their minds and it was a hard saying they said this is a hard saying who can hear it and after they said that Jesus made it more difficult by saying but what and if you see the son of man Ascend where he come down from and and then they they don't understand it and because of that they walked away and and then Jesus verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twel will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil this is interesting to me in Jesus's Ministry he would call 12 disciples and one of them was a devil and that devil would be embedded like a disciple it'd be a chosen disciple embedded like a brother and Jesus wouldn't trust him with the money bag would give him power and authority and he would give him the power to cast out Devils he give him the power to heal the lame give the power to cleanse lepers and he also sent 70 out two by two so he would commission them with a Ministry to go and preach the that the Kingdom of Heaven is near and and they went out commissioned by Jesus himself so if we look at it this way this was Jesus's Church if we could just this is Jesus's church and in his church he has 70 select ministers brother Ram said the Ministerial Association that he has fellowship with and he has confidence in and he sends them out two by two to go preaching and so if they would go out preaching two by two they would say they could say to everybody Jesus sent me personally to come preach that right and he selected me and called me and he sent me to go represent him from City to city and and show going before his face showing that the Kingdom of Heaven is is nigh at hand and so that was his church and then he and and furthermore he had 12 and out of those 12 I mean those were hands selected that were really close to him but when it come to the end of it in Jesus's Church there was a great falling away because they didn't understand the statements and they didn't believe what he was saying they they had something wrong with their faith they saw Miracles they saw all kinds of things but when they were challenged with statements they didn't understand they they walked away and they followed him no more and it was really discouraging to those who were left behind brother B explains this to us how Peter was discouraged seeing the multitudes now failing away and the persecutions coming and the negative statements rising and now the 70 go away and Jesus turns and say will you go also and and Peter says who where who we believe amen what was holding Peter there his faith in Jesus Christ not his comprehension of what he said but even at that he says but one of you is a devil M this is what me and this brother were talking about if this happened in Jesus's Church what should we expect so many times we get discouraged I hear people sometimes are discouraged they say this is going on in the message and this is happening in the message and in the message we have Division and in the message we have false Doctrine message we have false Brethren and then the message this and this and I just I I just begin asking how is that different than any other time in the scripture when God's message came forth amen show me where that's unscriptural right but yet some have gotten disappointed and walked away from the message because they saw that not recognizing that wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise in a mixed multitude am is that right amen and we get disappointed because of our expectation we expect to move into the realm of perfection not realizing that Jesus was our example in all ways amen and all the good things and in all the negative things he was our example Temple brother bam says this way in Hebrews uh CH 3 57 in the Hebrew series he said the old land of Egypt but when you got out there in their Journey just converted and brought out he's talking about the church and the Wilderness brother M calls it the church in the wilderness under Moses this would have been Pastor Moses's church amen it was the church in the wilderness he said they were just converted and brought out then the first thing you know they got in trouble God loves to bring you in trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it now you start to see my title the church in trouble because God loves to do that according to the prophet of God we believe the prophet of God right God loves to put the church in trouble now Moses is sent amen as the leader of the church and now and Moses's church the church in the wilderness brother bam calls him Pastor Moses he starts to type these things out for us amen and and he and he and he brings them out and all of a sudden they're super excited because Pastor Moses has gifts and and amen and he's calling down plagues and he's bringing a tremendous victory over the Egyptians and everything's wonderful until they go out they go out spoiling the Egyptians with with garments of silk and gold on their children everybody walks out rich and and then they come to the Red Sea and they fall into a trap and all Moses is doing is following the pillar of fire the same thing that led him to Egypt the same thing that led to Deliverance the same thing that brought him the word the Passover all the plagues the same thing he's following it but that leads him into what appears to be a trap amen and all of the sudden they begin to murmur against Moses and Moses has all of this fussing going on in his church because they don't understand what's going on they think Moses has failed them but see it was never Moses's success in the beginning Moses never saved them God did Moses never delivered them God did amen it was never Moses to begin with amen so they started looking at Moses Moses oh my goodness look what he did and look at the plagues and look at the spoil and look at all that he T us and it all happened just like Moses said and then because they were looking at Moses now they get out to the Red Sea who do they look at Moses and Moses you failed us and poor Moses is like God help me God says why cist down to me we know the whole story but they got in trouble and all the way down through in the church in the wilderness was nothing but a bunch of trouble remember the bitter Waters of Mara remember uh uh the the problem with the Feast of B peor remember the fiery serpents amen remember when they got tired of mana and God brought them Quail you you remember remember amen when they had no water and brought water from the rock you remember when he got angry and Moses failed and struck the rock twice amen you you remember all of these things that happened in Moses's Church yeah and there was two in there that were genuine Believers where were they in the middle of trouble but all of that was to prove Faith all of that was to prove their faith so God loves to bring you in trouble and where is the place that we hate to be more than any other is in trouble you know if I could just hit a button in my brain and hit delete and reprogram to where I can just say praise God I'm in trouble it would help me so much because the mind is the battle is in the mind amen and the human Spirit doesn't want to go into places where you have to subject yourself to trouble where you have to surrender where you have to sacrifice where you have to make yourself vulnerable and be hurt your human Spirit does not want to go there but there's something in the soul amen that keeps driving us on because there's a joy that lays ahead so Jesus tells us disciples all of these things and and then we find that when they begin when the when the first church amen the first New Testament Church comes up in the book of Acts amen there all of a sudden everything's uh God's doing so much and so many are getting called but Jesus promised them that they would have trouble and we've been talking about this in the Acts chapter 5 but they took Paul or they took Peter I went through it Wednesday and some of the Apostles and they arrested them and threatened them and then they beat them and then they turned them loose amen and threatened them not to preach anymore and they had all this trouble and it says and uh and to him they agreed when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for his name's sake you see they weren't disappointed because Jesus told them this was going to happen but yet they rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for his name's sake amen amen and we've never been in that kind of a condition we've never been arrested threatened on trial beaten and commanded never to preach in his name again but maybe somebody said asked us a question is why you wear a skirt all the time and why don't you cut your hair and oh we're so offended we're so hurt amen or you guys just follow a man oh we're so wounded why I say praise God I get to suffer for his name's sake I misunderstood Jesus was misunderstood I may even be rejected praise God he was rejected God change our thinking is what I'm asking for myself God change her thinking let's go to John 16 together John 16:32 John 16:32 behold the hour cometh yay is now come that you shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me listen remember let's make Jesus our example in all things if all men forsake you you're never alone if no one on this Earth understands you there's one who understands you he says these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have Tri tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen oh what a scripture friends Amen in the world you shall have tribulation can anybody say Amen to that am but then his commandment is be of good cheer for I've overcome the world if there's a scripture ever in the Bible that I failed it's this one because I've fallen into diverse Temptations and tribulations but I've not always been in good cheer but oh how I want to be in good cheer that if God puts me through a trial like he did job and deems me worthy and able and capable of going through the trial and not failing I want to say praise God he's found me worthy not oh God why is this happening to me amen and you can guess which one I usually say but Jesus is telling him in the world you shall have tribulation be of good cheer this is a commandment be of good cheer why can we be of good cheer because he's already overcome the world the victory is sure and the joy sets ahead is mine already it's been purchased it's been guaranteed it's been so before the foundation of the world there's not a circumstance that we're going to face that's going to change what God had in his back part of his mind before the foundation of the world and in this world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer he's already overcome the world so there's not a thing in the world that can stop God's plan for you so no matter what distress no matter what scary statements from a doctor or horrible things coming on the news or or what happens to you personally and nothing can change what God has already foresaw and for the joy that lays ahead let us take up our cross and follow after him cuz that's what he told us to do so yeah I'm just going to say some things and I'm just going to say them amen sometimes you say things and it sounds so bad to say but then you know it's the truth so Jesus didn't have a perfect Church Moses didn't have a perfect Church did Paul have a perfect Church did brother brandham have a perfect church was brandham Tabernacle did he ever say anything negative about things going on in brandham tabernac so if Jesus didn't have a perfect church and Moses didn't have a perfect perfect church and Paul didn't have a perfect church and brother brandham didn't have a perfect Church what made us think we could do better than all of them what made us think we could surpass Moses and Jesus and the Apostle Paul and brother brandham right well brother Brenham had some trouble but not us right I know better than Paul I'm come on friends let's set the right expect I said the right the right expectation is this church is in the middle of trouble you're in the middle of trouble and we will always be because wherever Christ is is where the trouble is where is Satan fighting amen where where Christ is working what is he trying to derail what is he trying to stop what is what is he what is he trying to hinder he's trying to hinder the forward progress of the Gospel he's trying to keep the the word from moving forward and accomplishing its goal amen so where does he put the maximum pressure the maximum pressure comes right to where Christ is working that's why wherever Christ was there's always a lot of noise so what's our expectation well now we have the message and we're going to be perfect listen friends that's not the case let's get that expectation out of our minds right amen let's go to Acts chapter 6 I don't know sometimes for me it's just fun to let the scriptures realign my thinking and bust all my traditional understanding because if we don't understand this principle then we feel like because we have the restored truth and we have the message that we should have a perfect church and so but because there's three types of Believers in every church because there's all kinds of maturity levels even in the genuine elect and because we're still in a in a body of Fallen flesh with a sticky cck bur nature because of all of those ingredients it'll never happen and because of that but when our expectation is it'll be perfect like we'll never have a make mistake there'll never be any Strife there'll never be any disagreement the pastor will never make a mistake the deacons and trustees will make every decision perfectly no nobody will ever get out of kilter with anybody else everything's going to go along just perfect amen if that's our expectation because we have the wrong expectation then what we will do is we will build a false front and start to pretend right because this is the way it's supposed to look but maybe it's supposed to look like the Bible's always looked maybe the church is going to be in the midst of trouble maybe there will always be dissension maybe there will always be misunderstanding maybe there will always be false Brethren maybe there will always be doctrinal issues you remember how brother bam said if this church ever puts forth another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it amen I challenge you to go back and read the book of Acts again that's right if we're going to have a church just like the book of Acts amen and we know brother brand was referring to the there'll be a restoration of power there'll be the Holy Ghost working in the church you will see healing you will see signs you will see Works amen but don't forget the Church of Acts was in trouble from the beginning of Acts to the end of Acts and there was all kinds of problems in the Church of acts so if this if we go back to being a book of Acts church I challenge you to read it again and when you read it this time you''ll be like oh dear that's the kind of church we're coming oh dear oh dear oh dear yes amen amen Acts chapter 6 now I want you to know where we are don't read look I shouldn't have said Don't Look Down I get too far ahead when we're coming to the Acts chapter 6 we're just shortly after the day of Pentecost the inaugural address of the church 5,000 added at one time 3,000 added another the church is growing there's Supernatural signs happening everywhere the apostles are working I mean their Shadow is healing people they're raising up the lame man they're they're doing all of these wonderful things amen there's a great move going on and this is the church the infant Church the the the the pure virtuous virgin bride that's given to Christ before she falls away yeah we agree amen Acts chapter 6 verse1 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians what are they doing murmuring this is the book of Acts the Holy Ghost just fell and fixed all their problems the Miracles are working the dynamic power of of Christ is being the resurrected power of Christ is in their midst what are they doing murmuring the disciples multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because their W widows were neglected in the daily ministration then the twel called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the world word of God and serve tables there wherefore Brethren look you out among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word brand new virgin bride handed to Christ fresh from Pentecost where the Holy Ghost was falling fresh and there began a murmuring against from the grecians against the Hebrews because apparently the grecians didn't feel like the Greek widows were getting as much as the Hebrews widows so there was some unfair treatment or at least there was suspected unfair treatment and they started complaining to the ministers amen that listen they gave this Widow this and this Widow got this and our widows aren't getting the same care as the Hebrew with so who wants to have a book of Acts Church hey I think we got one right and let's just be real about it amen amen let's just be honest this is the way it is there's always going to be trouble because that's for our Perfection there's always going to be something to reconcile because that's for our growth there's always going to be a misunderstanding amen because God is going to do that to cause us to step up and manifest The Life of Christ because he was criticized from the time he was a baby he was misunderstood he was falsely accused he was rejected he was all of these things and in all of that he manifest the life of God okay so what do you think we're going to need to do in the face of all these things we're going to have to manifest The Life of Christ amen so this is the book of Acts I mean right out of the shoot friends this is early on this is when they go to the Ephesian age and start to fall away this is right out of the gate and the whole reason they had to establish deacons is because there was a murmuring there was a dissension between which widows got more of the daily because you remember in this day they threw everything together in one pot and to distribute it and the Hebrew women were apparently or I listen I don't I don't know if this was true or not true but at least it was an accusation amen sometimes we wonder why we can't all agree on something they didn't in the book of Acts Paul and Barnabas didn't even agree on who to take on the next missionary journey and they both had the Holy Ghost that's also the book of Acts amen so so brother bam says it this way and um God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him he says but you see in the church is the pastor and the pastor is a special person this is when he's going through the five Ministry he's built to where he can put up with the fusses of the people why are they fussing they have the Holy Ghost he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things question is do we still need pastors if we still need pastors then maybe we still need somebody who can help reconcile when there's differences and disagreements and who can put up with the fusses of the people well if listen if we still have pastors then we still have fusses of the people and disagreements that have to be reconciled so let's have the correct expectation right that way we don't get derailed every time somebody doesn't agree on something or every time we hit a misunderstanding listen it's always been there it'll always be there it's not that we're ever trying to get to a place of perfection where we never come to a misunderstanding or a disagreement or a different view what we're trying to do is grow into a place where we handle it the way Jesus handled it not that it's abolished from us but it's handled correctly and that's why it'll keep coming around and keep coming around and keep coming around until we learn how to handle it amen because we've got to manifest the life of Jesus Christ when he was spit on he didn't spit back well when he was riled against he didn't R back how are you going to manifest that part of his nature unless you're spit on unless you're riled against against unless you're misunderstood or criticized amen but when we get misunderstood or criticized the first thing we want to do is run away but Jesus didn't have that option because he had the father's will so what God wants us to do is listen when when uh Peter when God told Peter when he reconciled Peter by the Sea of tiberias and he reconciled him back together and and he said do does thou love me does thou love me three times giving him a chance to reconcile then he tells him how he'll die you know you'll be led where you don't want to go and your arms will be spread out signifying a crucifixion and and all of these things and and he he begins to realize what what life might be like for him and he's walking with Jesus and he looks back and he sees John and he says Lord what about him like if I'm going to have to suffer is he going to have to suffer why cuz misery loves company I guess I don't know if I'm suffering I just want to know he's suffering too I mean that's human nature you know what happens is when we get into situations where it's difficult we look around and see somebody else who's seemingly blessed and we feel so why don't they ever have to suffer and the problem is you have no idea what's going on in their life and you don't know what level of suffering they suffer with we just make assumptions that I'm having it hard but everybody else has it better so Paul or Peter says what about him and Jesus says what is that to thee what if he should abide until I return what if he never has a trouble a day in his life and I shower blessings upon him and and he has no trouble and he makes it till the day I arrive and and life is Cushy for him right what's that to thee see we can't control what happens We Can't Stop bad things from happening we can't control negative circumstances the only thing we control is our response amen individually our response that's where God's holding us each one individually responsible is how we respond to things amen and don't worry if you messed up you'll get another chance I'm quite sure of that I'm quite I'm by the this stage of the game I'm quite certain let's go to Acts chapter 15 Acts chapter 15 verse 1 and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and barnabus and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem and unto the apostles and Elders about this question so in the book of Acts you have doctrinal differences amongst the Brethren some were trying to take them back to the previous age and take them back to the law of Moses and saying you know you have to keep this and you have to have some sign of your circumcision and you have to have some evidence and proof amen and and Paul is trying to show them it's all by faith and and now uh uh they're having this dispute so they send them up to Jerusalem and they have the Jerusalem Council where the Brethren are gathered together James and and Peter and John and Paul and Barnabas and others there and if you go to verse 24 let skip over to verse 24 and this is their conclusion that they want to send out to the Brethren says for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your soul saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment so there was Brothers coming down from Jerusalem claiming to speak for everybody in Jerusalem claiming to know the truth and claiming Amen to have the correct doctrinal understanding and they're going through Antioch and other places and they're beginning to challenge the things that Paul and Barnabas are teaching on Grace and they're trying to bring them they're they're trying to hold on to some old tradition and bring it bring it into this new way amen and and Paul's disputing with them but they're doing so by the authority amen of coming from Jerusalem yeah yeah so is there anything different in the message than in the book of Acts no it's the same yeah we can read the book of Acts and say that's going on all around us all the time it's been going on since the beginning this must be where Christ is this must be normal this must be an evidence that Christ is in our midst and the devil's trying to derail it well praise God I see this in the book of Acts I see it in Paul's Ministry I see it in Moses I see it in Jesus I see it all the way through H praise be to God this must be where the truth is cuz this is where the battle is thank you Lord Jesus amen people have walked away because there's too many differences Brothers don't agree there's doctrinal differences there's teaching this and there's teaching that and some people have just walked away right but there's nothing different about that than the book of Acts there's always been different Brothers with different ideas and different doctrines it's always been there and it wasn't right to walk away in the book of Acts and it's not right to walk away now so they sent a letter now this Jerusalem Council with Peter and John and James all they they put together a letter saying that hey we didn't teach this amen just go and don't eat anything strangled and stay away from fornication and idols and and and and that's it and they sent this letter and they sent it with uh uh uh two Brethren from them one of them was Silas and they went down and they went to Antioch and they went around and they shared this letter that settled the matter it was done the Brethren settled it wrong everywhere Paul went they followed Paul trying to spread their own Doctrine Paul was dealing with this in Galatians that's what the whole book of Galatians is about the entirety of oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you having received the gospel how come you receive another which is not another the whole book of Galatians is because these same kind of men with the same understanding although it was settled at the Jerusalem Council it was never settled because that Spirit still lives on and wherever Paul would establish a church it wasn't too long till they were following Paul around trying to establish themselves and in the book of Corinthians Paul is saying they're they're zealous Over You for their own effect they want to gather disciples unto themselves and they want to have uh accolades and they want to uh have credential and they want to use you they're subverting your souls for their own gain right the church has always been in trouble friends amen amen but the Believers have always for the joy that lays ahead kept moving forward we're never going to stop these things so there's no point in fighting them all there's no point in trying to stop them just preach the truth the way we see the truth and move forward with Christ listen if Paul with all of the wisdom that God had given him in the word all the Revelation he got in Arabia three and a half years getting straight from Jesus Christ The Gospel truth if he couldn't stop it what makes you think we can right yeah you'll find out here shortly that neither could brother brandham stop it right in his own Fellowship in his own ministerial ranks yeah if he couldn't stop it what makes us think we can stop it are we better than them amen Paul in Corinthians it's amazing Paul is having to defend his apostleship because there's others saying he's not really all that yeah and Paul's this and that and he may have gotten some things wrong you should listen to us and you can tell by his answer what the debate is and and there's another man writing to them in 2 Corinthians 10 uh ver verse 10 he says for his letter say say they are weighty and Powerful amen the ones who are subverting Paul are saying when he writes you a letter they're weighty and Powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is contemptible what are they doing they're criticizing Paul yeah they're saying when he writes you a letter he's a big man and he's got power and with power of his pen but when he's in your presence he's weak and his speech is contemptible he he why would you want to listen to Paul yeah listen we we read through the Bible and we think Paul Paul was aaz in Paul's day Paul was highly rejected yeah High rejected criticized amen by those who were Christians not just Jews the ones who are criticizing here in Corinthians these are not Jews holding to the traditions of the fathers these are converts to Christ amen these are the judaizers who are trying to mix amen the old Covenant with Moses with the New Covenant amen so they're Christians they claim to be Christians believing in Jesus the crucifixion the Resurrection the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're the on that are criticizing Paul and defaming his character and trying to seow Discord between him and brother and try to bring him down off a pedestal and make him look weak and make him look bad and make him look ignorant yeah how could they do that and when we get to the Corinthians the church is not very old still a young Church let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter CH 11 together second Corinthians chap 11 verse 22 he's still having to make the case said are they Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so am I are they Seed of Abraham so am I are they Ministers of Christ so I just want you to think who is this yeah that's contesting Paul and defaming Paul Hebrews Israelites Seed of Abraham are they Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more so these were Ministers of Christ too I am more in labors more abundant in Stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths of of the Jews five times received die 40 Stripes save one Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned Thrice I have suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deep and journeyings often in Perils of water in Perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen that's because the Jews wanted to kill him now listen to this and perils by my own country country men in perils by the Heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false Brethren and weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger and in thirst and fasting is often in cold and in nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not not Paul went on to tell them so these men that were contesting him were Hebrews Israelites Seed of Abraham Ministers of Christ yeah but then he goes down and begins to describe what his life is like how many thinks Paul was in a lot of trouble all the time and perils in the wilderness and perils in the city and in perils in the sea in perils amongst my own countrymen and Perils of the Heathen and in Perils of false Brethren amen these were those who claimed to be part of the church and part of Christ brother Bram says in Revelation chap 5 part 1 from 1961 he says what if every person in this world was a Christian what if everybody was a Spirit-filled Christian why we wouldn't need any Faith No More would wouldn't need any faith at all see faith is the very is the very thing that we're saved by is Faith and that's the reason there has to be some disagree with it so that we can exercise Faith do you understand it now you've got to have the other side you've got to have a bad woman to make a real one stand out right there's got to be a lie to make the truth positive and make it shine good if everything was truth it would just be so common see so where do we express Faith Amen in the face of doubt if some didn't disagree brother B said if some didn't disagree with it some some has got to disagree with it so that we can exercise Faith there has got to be false Brethren to show True Brethren amen it has to be there there's got to be some that contend with and strive against and and argue and disagree it has to be there friends so that we can express our faith in the word of God because our faith is expressed When Faith is challenged and how's our faith expressed rest because of the joy that lay ahead cuz what do I have faith in that I'm a great person and my life should be good and God protects me and nobody going to say anything against me that's not the faith my faith is in the joy that lays ahead the promise of God Amen that is mine and for the joy that lays ahead I will endure the cross despising the shame and we don't like it amen we don't want to go through persecutions rejections sicknesses we don't want to go through abandonment we don't want to go through any of these things but we are willing to because of the joy that lays ahead head that's the expression of our faith we can all Express faith when we're all here together and everything's going fine we can have faith but can we have faith Amen in the face of obstacles and how will we be able to endure by looking ahead be of good cheer in this world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world Amen amen Paul in First Corinthians start to starts to correct the church because in the church are divisions some are of Apollos some of Paul and some are more righteous than Sam of Christ but they start to have divisions and they they start to uh argue and Paul is now trying to correct this and saying who is Paul and who is apollis are not we just Ministers of Christ amen one Waters one one one plants one Waters but God gives the increase what church is this this is Paul's Church this is the church Paul established this is the one he preached this Doctrine to and what are they doing they're dividing over well I believe this one is whatever my favorite or more accurate or I don't know what they were separating over but I'm am Aus and I'm of Paul and Paul says nonsense it's all Christ anything good comes from Apollo it's Christ if anything good comes from Paul it's Christ amen so let's look to Christ in 1 Corinthians 3 if you could turn back there with me and I know that the Corinthian Church is an immature church I understand that he's trying to teach him spiritual gifts and trying to bring him to maturity uh and we we should be coming to the end of the church ages to a more mature Church the problem is when we do the same thing that they did in Corinth in the Corinthian Church it makes me wonder how mature we actually are 1 Corinthians CH 3:1 and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men so maybe a definition of being carnal is having envying and strife and division or at least those are attributes of being carnal according to Paul for while one saith I'm of Paul another I'm of Apollos are you not carnal so there was some carnality in Paul's church amen and I can say that maybe once in a while some carnality creeps in amongst us you think that's fair am but oh let us deal with it friends help us to recognize it and say God I don't want that in my life but I want to endure I want to press towards what's important I want to care about the most important and I don't want to worry about all these other things the Apostle Paul go let's go back to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 I love this what he says 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 8 we are troubled on every side so I like this I like the fact that he said we because I can put myself in the we well you want to include yourself in the we we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal bodies we may not be taken to death by crucifixion or we may not be led Away by soldiers and be beheaded but we ought to be dying daily and in our dying to ourselves in the mid of all of these things dying out to all of this it should be manifesting the life of Jesus in our flesh so we should be dying in the midst of all of these things Paul I want to read what Paul says he says we are troubled we are perplexed persecuted and bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus so is that true yes yes but what else he says is we are not distressed we are not in despair we are not forsaken uh and not destroyed we're a church in the middle of trouble but we're not forsaken we're not destroyed we're not distressed amen we're we're perplexed but we're not in despair so do we find ourselves in trouble yes do you ever find yourself in distress yes do you ever find yourself perplexed have you ever been cast down then you've been in the same place as Paul has been praise God but let's the other side be a reality to us also we are we are not distressed though troubled not distressed perplexed not in despair we are not Forsaken and we are not destroyed we can be a church in the middle of trouble amen but we can be overcoming by the grace of God Amen God is so good to us let's go to Acts chapter 16 now I'm praying that God will correct all of my wrong thinking and so that I can actually take on the life of those who who lived for him in every generation and let's begin at Acts 16: 19 and when her master saw that the hope of their gains were gone they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach Customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being Romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrate ran off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God amen and the prisoners heard them oh this scripture challenges me friends I have never been in a situation that ever comes close to the trouble that they were in a multitude rose up against them took them to the magistrate who rent off their clothes they ripped their clothes off in the Public Square rent their clothes off and beat them and when they laid many stripes upon them they cast them in prison charging the Jailer to keep them safe and having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in stalks the the crowd hated them you talking about rejection this is rejection somebody's saying they don't like your nose is not rejection this is rejection the whole multitude come against them stripping their clothes off and beating them do you know how shameful humiliating how much rejection how much abandonment you feel how much pain from the beating that you would feel so they're hurting all over then they take them and throw them in the prison and the Jailer puts them in stalks their their legs are fast and shut their arms may be in Chains or maybe they're maybe maybe it's like the old uh European stocks where their feet and their hands are in the same stock and they're in this position beating bleeding bruised naked stripped rejected and the only thing they can think to do is sing praises to God maybe the next time somebody doesn't like my nose I'll sing praises to God maybe I can start to handle my little troubles on this Earth am mean if I can look at what Paul went through and I can look at what Moses went through I can look at what brother Brandon went through and I can look at what Jesus went through and I can say oh God they misunderstand me they say things about me that's not true but you're worthy to be praised anyhow because I'm not looking at that I'm looking beyond that I'm looking at a promise that you gave me and I'm looking at a joy that'll be unfolded on this Earth I'm not looking here for pleasure and comfort and ease of life I'm looking here to please you in everything and whatever you allow is for a purpose but I'm looking ahead let's go to acts 23 acts 23 and verse 10 acts 23:10 this is Paul being imprisoned and tried this ISS after he went to Jerusalem and when there arose a great dissension the chief the chief Captain fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pie of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou Hast testified to me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome you know what this means this means Paul is not going to be released from prison yeah this means he's going to go as a prisoner to Rome and he's going to testify in Rome the same way he did in Jerusalem which he testified being bound and so God comes to Paul and he says oh Paul be happy cuz you're going to stay in prison yeah because you're going to testify of me in Rome amen Paul who could be beaten as strip naked locked in stocks and he and Silas could sing praises to God and they weren't Whispering friends the other prisoners down there heard them I'd say Paul could have been of good cheer he learned how what if Jesus tells you your trial is not going to end but I've got a purpose in it it's actually going to get worse you're actually going to be taken out of your home country you're going to be taken to Rome and you're going to stay in prison but be of good cheer oh praise God I'm not going to turn to all these next scriptures I'm just going to recite a few but in second Timothy 4 Paul starts to tell Timothy in verse n do thy ding to come to me short come shortly unto me for Deus has forsaken me having love this present world and is departed into thessalonica crescence to galatia Titus into dtia only Luke is with me take Mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me in the ministry Paul is writing that Deus has forsaking but who was Deus Deus was a close associate if you look in the letter to filon he says uh he names four Brethren Marcus aristarchus Deus Lucas as my fellow laborers one of his fellow laborers one of his friends one that traveled with him and preached ones that he could recommend to others yeah forsook him Amen in Acts chapter 20 let's turn to Acts chapter 20 in verse 17 in Acts chapter 20 Paul is heading back to Jerusalem and there's been there's been prophecies all along the way that he's going to be imprisoned and persecuted and and taken captive and so he knows that he's going maybe to his death and so here in Acts 2017 it says and from meitus he sent to epis and called the Elders of the church so Paul doesn't want to take the time to go up to Ephesians it says in the book of Acts don't want to go to Ephesus but he goes to malitas he's on his way he wants to get there by the Feast of Passover so he calls for the Elders of the church to come so he gathers all the elders to them because he wants to talk to the elders and here's part of what he says let's start in verse 28 he said take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wol enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them I would like to bring your attention to the fact that we're still in the book of Acts this is still a book of Acts Church These are the men that Paul ordained as elders and worked with as Elders of the church and and he gathered the elders and the elders all gathered around and he and he began to warn them and he claimed that he had been warning them for 3 years and and he says I know that after my departure Grievious W wolves shall come in not sparing the flock and he says and among your own selves shall men who is your own selves these were the preachers the Elders of the church that Paul had worked with and ordained and established and taught see the same thing happens in the message when brother brandham left and we get discouraged because some of the men that knew him and some of the men that were close to him and look what they did and look how horrible and look how they gather is it any different than Paul's Ministry is it any different than the book of Acts is what we've seen and what we see is it any different than the book of Acts no we only get discouraged when we have the wrong expectation amen Amen brother Brenham he makes this statement in the queen of the south from 58 he says and Jesus in his teaching here he just had a lot of criticism and they had been talking about him as every time where the supernatural's done there's a mixed multitude when Moses did the supernatural a mixed multitude went with him and it caused trouble always when the supernatural done a mixed multitude go goes the Revival is going on now and there's a mixed multitude the historians said it wasn't a strange thing that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it but to keep his head above all the fanaticism that followed the Reformation so was Martin Luther a true Messenger from God is he one of the Seven Angels but all around Martin Luther in the Reformation were men who were Fanatics yeah zealots and all kinds of things and they were associated with him they were in the same circles they and and it wasn't that he could brother M said the historians say it wasn't that he could protest the Catholic church and get away with that it that he could keep his head above all the fanaticism that surrounded him if that's true then when you would look from the outside into the Reformation movement and you would see Martin Luther and you would see all the fanaticism surrounding him it would look like a great big old mess yeah and you could be on the outside criticizing but look at this and look at this and look at this amen but God wasn't looking at all of that that's always been there God was looking at the message Martin Luther was given to distribute and he was given that and the elect were going to catch it and the elect were going to move on in the middle of a whole bunch of trouble and a great big old mess of fanaticism amen amen there's listen there's a whole bunch of fanaticism that takes the name of the message and twist it into all kinds of stuff there could be a great big mess going on all around hey but that's what Martin Luther had to deal with that didn't deter God one drop that didn't stop the message from coming forth and that didn't stop the elect from hearing amen from that messenger and grabbing the truth of justification and moving on Amen just because there's fanaticism all around just because there's a great big old mess and and Martin Luther was in a whole big pile of trouble so what so what Paul was in a mess Jesus was in a mess you think there wasn't Fanatics Around Jesus they were trying to take him by force and make him a king to overthrow the Roman government what do you think the Romans thought when they heard that yeah we find the same thing in the message find the same thing all around us friends Amen brother brandham is preaching Revelation 5 this is 1961 this is June says after he's come through and he's preached the U revelation of Jesus Christ series which is the seven Church ages preached Revelation chapter 4 now he's getting into Revelation chapter 5 but there's another title for this message and the other title for this message is called bruised serpent because brother Brenham has to deal with some fanaticism that's around him here's what he says I heard it a few more times but it wasn't so and the other day in can a brother showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pocket said William brandham is our Lord baptizing in the name of William brandham this is what he's dealing with in Bru serpent because they were baptizing in his name and saying he was the Lord Jesus Christ does that change the truth of the message does the fanaticism around Martin Luther change the truth of Luther's message does the trouble that surrounded Paul with these men from Jerusalem coming down and causing problems in all the church is the fact that the church that Paul established all broke up in factions I'm of Apollos and I'm a Paul does that change the truth of Paul's message doesn't change anything it's always been there brother bham comes down and he starts talking about these Brethren he said I had to deal with it years ago and I thought it was dealt with then and now it's come back up and he's contemplating leaving the field over such a lie and and and he's so upset and so troubled in this message and he comes a little further down he says I've wondered if I would have been some of mine enemies it would have been all right if it was his enemies who were baptizing in his name and calling William brandom Lord it would be all right he said but I would just have laughed at it and went on but when it come to being precious Brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me these were some of his friends and some of the people that were closest to him in association and I said Lord that things too great for me I'll just have to walk out and leave it in your hands I don't know what else to do now listen to what he says a few nights ago to make it sure I had a visitation from the Lord and I seen a pre one a precious one one of those B brothers and sisters a precious one a babying a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me right along and the and the thing struck me on the leg so he see somebody babying a little serpent a yellow and black Serpent and that serpent bit him on the leg listen what he says and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me and I looked down and there's where I had been bit before he just tells us earlier on that he had to deal with this before where they were trying to make him Jesus Christ so he had been bit by this snake before but he had thought he had dealt with it and now he looks down in the scenario is in and Bruce Serpent and this serpent bites him where he had been bit before but his blood was too strong which mean he wouldn't take the devil's bait the lie that he's Jesus Christ he resisted that lie amen so it bit him with the poison Venom of a lie trying to overinflate him and trying to make him Jesus Christ and all of these precious Saints and friends that were around him amen but his blood was too strong it couldn't take an effect but it bit him where he was bit before so this is the second time he's dealing with this he says and I turned quickly with a gun and I shot the thing and it hit right in the middle of the thing now this is something that's very interesting and I don't know for sure if this is true or not but I had a brother uh tell me who was familiar with this and he said there was Brethren up in Canada that were believing this and there was Brethren down in Georgia that were believing this and here's brother brandham in Jeffersonville which is in the middle and he shoots the thing in the middle which is what Bruce serpent is all about so he shoots the thing in the middle he said and a brother said I turn with my gun to shoot its head off and he said don't do that just pick up the stick laying there by you and when I turned my back to pick up the stick it wiggled into some water just a little small puddle of water I said Well it can't hurt very much longer now because I believe the brother realizes the Brethren that what would happen I said it's mortally wounded so it'll die so brother Ram's dealing with this deity Doctrine with he he's Jesus Christ and baptizing in his name and people wanted to worship and they were even finishing their prayers in the name of William brandham over their meals and things like that and here he comes he's so troubled to deal with it and God gives him this Vision showing this thing bit him where he'd been bitten before but the blood was strong he's not going to buy into that lie and he shoots it right in the middle and then he goes to shoot its head off to finish it off and a brother standing by says don't do that grab that stick when he turns to grab the stick the snake slithers off into a little pool of water and brother B says well it's mortally wounded it'll die but the Lord never told him that and went into a pool of water and in the Bible water represented people a little pool of water and we know that Spirit didn't die because it's still going on today somebody sent me a picture from overseas where there's a man in Africa bowing on his knees with his hands up to a picture of William brandham in a church he shot it in the middle but it slithered off he never saw it die and we see the effects of it going on now does that change the truth of the message in no way does it change does trouble does false Brethren does false Doctrine is it any different than what Paul dealt with no friends it was in Paul's Ministry it was in jesus' Ministry it was in brother Bam's Ministry and why do we think that we'll be suddenly be free from from it Brothers in the same message he comes down to the end of the message and listen closely to what he says because it had such impact on me he said then that brings me to think of 31 years will will be soon of Ministry for the Lord and I guess every man thinks of sometimes when he has to come to his last service and come to his last hour and look back down the path and see what has been accomplished see what's went on have you did anything have I just said it's it's what you do for others that counts I often wonder what would be when I got to the end of my road which we don't know what time that will be none of us so I was thinking about looking back down along the trail where I've come through life and seen the different Hills and Brier patches and rocks and hard places and smooth Runnings and what did I do what what I did in those kind of times what kind of times the hill the Brier patches the rocks the hard places and the smooth Runnings he was looking back over his life and said what did I do in those kind of times you know sometimes the worst times for a Christian is the smooth Runnings the most treacherous time he said it'll all show up one of these days at the hour of my going away and I'll do that on each it'll do that on each of us we will all be sure of that that it'll show up to each one when that time comes he says in the message possessing the enemy's Gates he says was a little year a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as it is so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to be to happen the way that it's supposed to be God makes it that way God brings tension into the church for every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he lets sickness strike you he lets disease come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do almost anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that it's more precious than gold to US amen there's so many times when the when I read a quote from the prophet I say amen and I read one like this and it's like oh dear but it's just as true as the day Jesus sat and told his disciples you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake and you're going to be scorg and you're going to be in prison and father's going to turn against son and all it's just as true friends because God wants to prove amen what is he looking for Faith and amen what will overcome these obstacles Faith that's it let's go to James chapter 1 James chapter 1 verse 2 oh praise God James 1 vers two my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing question is what do we want out of life do we want an easy life or do we want to come to adoption maturity it's going to take patience this word patience I told you earlier it means steadfastness constancy endurance another definition is a patient enduring a sustaining a perseverance he says count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the try of your faith worketh patience so Jesus told his disciples all of these things are going to happen to you but he that endureth to the end shall be saved so what's it going to take to make it to the goal it's going to take endurance so why should we count it all joy when we fall into diverse Temptations because the trying of our faith worketh endurance how do we get Endurance by the trying of our faith it teaches us to be patient to endure to just stay fast because amen it's all God working something in my life we'll get through this too amen amen and when the next one comes we'll get through this too amen I'm not derailed because there's trouble about I'm not derailed because of rejection or sickness I'm not derailed because of falling away I'm I'm not derailed by all of that but let me set my face on the joy that lays ahead this will end too but let me count this all joy because this is going to bring about the patience that I need to be saved because he that endureed to the end will be saved and we're not going to make it without endurance without patience and we're not going to get paid patience without trials cu the trying of our faith so maybe rather than to despair every time something should happen maybe we should say Praise Your Name Lord Jesus you're working something out of my life maybe the next time our heart is broken because of something somebody said to us or a circumstance that happened in family or happened in church or maybe we should just go amen just like Paul and stalks beating in naked in a prison cell and just start singing praises to God because he's good anyhow and this thing will work together for good cuz it's a promise in the scriptures maybe we could just change our attitude about troubles and disagreement and strife and sickness and trials and falling away and false Brethren and false Doctrine if we could just change our attitude maybe all of a sudden we would realize there's nothing to worry about because the destiny is still secure what is that to thee follow thou me me you say didn't you hear what they're preaching over in so and so City what's that to thee follow thou me didn't you hear there was a bunch of people that fell away because of a new internet not internet s what's that to thee follow thou me do you see that there's people bowing down and lighting candles and worshiping William brandom what's that to thee follow thou me it's nothing unusual in the scriptures it's nothing out of the ordinary wherever Christ was there's always been a big bunch of noise what does he you want me to do look to the glory that lays ahead and endure because he that endur to the end listen despising the shame do you think we like contention we all hate it you think we like it when Brothers Fall Away we hate it you think we like it that there's deception out there in the name of the message and there's false we hate but despising the shame we don't like it but we can't change it we don't want it we didn't ask for it but we can't make it go away the only thing I can do as one individual is press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ the only thing I can do is count it all joy when I hit diverse Temptations and trials for this is working what I need to make get to the end you know what we need to do sometimes sometimes we just need to act like a mule that's harnessed to a hitch and just put our head down and plow quit wishing it was over quit acting like it's unfair quit crying about how mean everything is and how horrible the world is maybe sometimes what we need to do is just drop our head and keep plotting along because if God hitched me to this wagon there's a purpose amen yes and if it's God's purpose I'm not going to go around it I'm not going to go under it I'm just going to go through it and the faster I start taking steps the faster this thing will be behind me yeah and we just need to say God you're everything to me this message is true whatever somebody else wants to do with it is fine I want everybody to believe it but one thing's for sure is I believe it I want everybody to walk closer to you but one thing's for sure I'm determined to give my life to you and let you live through me and one one area that I myself has failed in and I'm asking God to help me is when I find myself in stalks beaten and imprisoned I haven't been singing I've been crying I'm probably not the only one but you know what I want to start doing I'm going to start singing I'm going to start singing you alone are worthy amen of all the glory amen you alone are worthy of all our praise just because I'm having a bad day doesn't change how worthy you are Lord Jesus to be worshiped and adored just because my heart is hurting or my flesh is hurting just because my mind is confused and I'm discouraged doesn't ever diminish the fact that you're worthy of my praise and I want to count it all joy I want to be cheerful Jesus said in this life you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen oh Lord that's so true I'm having tribulation that part of the scripture is true let me make the rest of the scripture true I want to be of good cheer for he has overcome the world the circumstance you're going through he's already overcome it the trouble you're facing he's already overcome it what's coming next he's already overcome it this world is overcome and the new one is about ready to set in and that's the one we're looking towards brother B says in the message the world is falling apart he says in our political world today and our religious world is just exactly like it was in the days of the first coming of Messiah it's polluted the whole system is rotten our po politics couldn't get no worse in our religion I don't see how it could get any worse than what it is the whole thing is corrupted our political World man-made systems Fashions we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life is a struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at how everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some some kind of a system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know that there's something wrong when we try to get a system that makes everything easy and everything perfect we're wrong and there we know there's something wrong because God never intended for this life to be easy what he wanted us here was to build character and become to grow into Christlike character and to display the divine nature thank God so now I I think the scariest times in life should be for us the easiest times and the times of rejoicing maybe should be some of the hardest times because we know God's working something in our Liv we got to lift our eyes just above amen that trial but move it up a little bit higher until we see the Promise that's behind the trials listen friends let's let's let the Millennium be more real to us than this earth when Jesus looked to the glory that lay ahead there was something he was looking at that was not natural eyes seeing the condition around him he was with spiritual eyes seeing something that you could not see on this Earth but what he was seeing amen gave him the courage and the joy Amen to endure the cross amen let's put our spiritual eyesight on and see more than what's going on around us but let's look to the revelation of what's coming and let that eyesight encourage us to step forward and be cheerful and be joyful and sing praises in the midst of our worst day because why I not looking to none of this all of this will perish he's overcome the world be of good cheer he's overcome it we're moving to the next one where he will be king of kings Lord of lords on the throne of David and all wrongs will be right let's go to Romans 8 I want to finish with this scripture in Romans 8 Romans 8 and verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword listen how did this sentence start off who shall separate us from the love of Christ not who will separate us from Earthly Goods or from peace in our mind or from an Easy Living let's come back to what's the most important thing to us amen the love of Christ amen who shall separate us from the shall tribulation tribulation might separate you from mental ease but it won't separate you from the love of Christ am or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as is as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing is going to hurt us friends amen because it can't separate us from his love and his love he's revealed to us his elective love and he's bringing us to that place yes in the flesh it can be difficult but oh praise God if we could just look at our trials differently if you could look at the difficult man at work that hates you differently amen and he's trying to disrupt everything you're trying to do and spread rumors about you and trying to derail you and make sure he gets the promotion and you don't get it and your reputation is is is slandered maybe we must look at that differently instead of God make him go away God maybe we should look at it and say praise God I have an opportunity to act like Jesus Christ now cuz without this man I wouldn't have this chance to display what's inside of me but this man is giving me the opportunity to forgive this man is giving me the opportunity to love this man is giving me the opportunity to be like Jesus on Calvary saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and without this man I don't have the opportunity praise God and let's start wrestling our flesh in the subjection and take great joy in the fact that I conquered this man not that man amen amen we're always trying to conquer the one that rejects us the one that doesn't like us the one with the false Doctrine or the one that spread rumors about us or or the or the one that made us whatever we're always fighting that man that's not the man to fight this is the man to fight and all them other men and women are giving us an opportunity to conquer this man to display Christ right and now count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations because now you have an opportunity to manifest what's inside and in those times that we manifest the wrong thing that old sticky cck bur nature it gives us an opportunity to lay that before God and say God take that thing out of my life that jealousy that self-preservation take it right out of my life because God I see you're giving me an opportunity I don't want to fail it but I only want you to be manifest in my life there's people who are Fanatics so what what's that to thee follow thou me there's people manipulating the truth of the message for the personal game so what what that's to thee there's people who may speak evil of you there's some maybe some people who don't like you praise God I'm thankful praise God why are we thankful because if God ordained that trial for me it's the best thing that he could do for me and if he wants to manifest something out of me that's what I want to live for anyways that he has control of me maybe just maybe we can start looking at our trials differently and maybe just maybe he can accomplish his purpose in our life amen how many see a book of Acts church a little differently now amen how many realize that listen God knows who's who and what's what and what he's doing with each we don't have to know and we don't have to pretend to know we don't have to make it up all we've got to do is surrender and sing his Praises regardless I want to next time I find myself prison not real prison but like the song says a prisoner in my mind because of the struggles and trials and things that are said and done and next time I find myself all locked in stocks and bound up emotionally and tied down on the inside you know what I want to desperately do I want to sing praises to his name because when they began to sing praises to his name the stocks unlocked you know what might get me out of my mental bondage the prison that I'm in my mind it might be the very fact that I quit looking at my circumstance and start looking at the one who's greater than my circumstance who has a purpose in it all and start singing praises to Him and maybe in my singing praises to him he'll take my mind out of the stalks and let me see how good my life is and how blessed I am how thankful I am for everything he's done for me and remind me of the joy that lays ahead amen let's all stand musicians if you'd please come so the next time you think we're going to have a book of Acts church you can say well praise God we've got to take the good and the bad amen amen and the next time you feel pressure to pretend that our church is perfect just remember we're not going to do any better than Paul we're not going to be better than brother brandham better than Moses better than Jesus we can't outdo them so the next time you feel that temptation to present your church as the perfect church just quit please let's just be real you say you know what we're a bunch of people with a bunch of problems that are looking to the glory that lays ahead amen that love this word and driving for it perfect absolutely not but none of them have been we we actually we might be a little bit like the church in the wilderness we might be a little bit like Jesus's church or Paul's church or brother brenham's church but praise God anyhow amen there was Believers there in anyhow I thank God I thank God for reality friends am now what's my goal my goal is just let this vessel be a Temple of Praise not to worry about what all is going on but just to trust him and follow him what he said to Peter I want to apply it to my life what's that to thee follow thou me and let's bow our head heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your word is so good and so true and so rich God we've read over it so many times and so many times we read it we saw highlights successes saw Lord where your people overcame God it takes a few years of maturity to go back and read it again sometimes and see the circumstances that those overcoming came through the trials the difficulties the Mind battles the physical weariness the exhaustion the heartache but God you've been faithful through it all you never promised us a flowery bed of ease but you promised we'd have tribulation you promised rejection you promised trouble you showed us in every way that what what we experience is normal God I pray that your word would defeat Every Lie of the devil that's caused disappointment where people are discouraged and disappointed because they can see error and failure but oh God one thing for sure is I don't want you to be disappointed I want to be pleasing to you Lord I want to surrender my life aresh and God I want to have the perspective that Paul and Silas had I want to have the perspective that those disciples when they were beaten and charg not to preaching your name they ran out Lord they were happy rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for your name and God may my trials not become my enemies but my trials become my friend the thing that pushes me to higher Heights that draws out of me deeper depths of your love and your character God may I not look Lord to the difficult ities and the circumstances of life as my enemy but may I look at them Lord as my helpers to help me manifest your life God may I change my attitude may I rejoice when I fall into diverse Temptations may I count it all joy Lord that my might inherit the promise May the scriptures that we read today become a living reality in US Lord that we would no longer be complainers and whiners and distraught and discouraged but may we be Overcomers by your grace may we recognize the power that you've given us of Revelation and understanding that our eyes can behold the truth and that you've opened to us the understanding of the next phase of the journey and for the glory that lays ahead we can endure our cross help us Lord God I pray that you be with your children you be with us as an assembly Lord that we wouldn't Lord have the wrong expectation of one another the wrong expectation of this Gathering or wrong expectation of the message as a whole and get discouraged and disappointed but may we have Lord open eyes to see God may we all Lord May each one of us have that individual commitment and walk to you that will give our lives to you that will focus on you and that will follow after you regardless Lord for that's the only way to have Victory Lord we ask that you would help each one of us individually bless your children I pray he pour yourself into US Lord God change us change our mindset change our thinking with your Godly knowledge may you wash us with your word we love you we ask your blessing Over Us in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all I certainly love you all and I appreciate your prayers for us this coming week and for the brothers who will be traveling I'll certainly be praying for you all amen God bless you well I'm pressing on the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining every day still praying
