TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what's that what's all heaven waiting on us brother branham said it but i want to show in the scripture it's there's there's more than what we can think and what we can imagine when he says they're waiting on us oh heaven is waiting on us the reconciliation of heaven earth is waiting on us amen it's got to have a bride of his own choosing that stands on the word to prove that she won't fall fail like eve fell then he can take her out of the way go to 144 000. they'll take the word and stand on the word which will complete redemption for the jews from the time of christ on then he'll burn the earth over then we'll have a millennial reign for a thousand years see none of that happens if there's not a bride to express the word then after a thousand years there's a resurrection of the dead and at the resurrection of the dead there's a judgment set the bride's not going to be judged she's going to be the one judging the husband and wife will be sitting on the throne you can sit with me in my throne you know you're not you shall judge the angels this is all the scriptures we're standing there in judgment and people are coming up and there's going to be people amen who's going to receive eternal life having never named the name of christ because of the good deeds they did to the elect but do you realize their entrance into eternal life will never come until this bride expresses the word millennium will never come 144 000 never come everything now everything is hinged on you and i keeping the word the reconciliation of heaven of earth everything is wrapped up down to this one thing you and i believing this word and standing on the word this isn't our pastime this isn't something that we do on the side we're not a mechanic and we believe the message no everything in our lives is for us to believe this word and keep this word and all heaven is behind us
