[0:00] Prepare for rain. Prepare your family
[0:02] for rain. Prepare your marriage for rain
[0:06] because God is coming by your way.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "All I have is rain. It's just
[0:12] water. I just got water and I got lots
[0:14] of water. When I drink water, you know,
[0:16] just it's just water. There's no there's
[0:18] no stimulation." You see, you don't get
[0:21] stimulation by water.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; You get stimulation by wine.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; New wine.
[0:28] wine types, a revelation of Jesus
[0:30] Christ, a revelation of the word. That's
[0:32] what stimulates you. That's what makes
[0:33] you grow. That itself has a life of its
[0:36] own. Water does not have a life of its
[0:38] own. But the wine has the life of its
[0:40] own. But you need to fill your pots and
[0:44] you need to fill your pots with water.
[0:45] He said, "Brother Chris, I have." Okay.
[0:47] Now, the master's coming your way. Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; The master wants to come to the marriage
[0:54] because saints of God, it is the
[0:55] invisible union of the bride of Jesus
[0:58] Christ. You wonder where your
[0:59] stimulation is. You wonder why there's
[1:02] no stimulation. YOU GOT A POT OF WATER
[1:05] and the GO THE THE BRIDEGROOM OF THE
[1:06] FEAST HAS NOT YET ENJOYED the new wine,
[1:09] the best for last.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; You have a potential for a marriage, but
[1:13] no marriage.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; You know that there's a marriage. You
[1:17] know that there's a third pole. You know
[1:18] that there's an opening of the word, but
[1:20] it's just water in your pot,
[1:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23] &gt;&gt; And you want to know what is it? You
[1:24] know that brother over there, he talks
[1:26] about the third pole, but his life is no
[1:28] good. There's no fruits of the word in
[1:30] his life. So what's true? Is the third
[1:32] pull true or is it not? I have heard
[1:34] this stuff. You know, I I've talked to
[1:36] people said, I've heard this. I know
[1:38] exactly what you're talking about. BUT
[1:39] THEIR LIFE HOLDS NOTHING.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; There's no victory in their life because
[1:44] it's JUST WATER.
[1:46] BUT YOU NEED JESUS CHRIST TO COME
[1:48] QUICKEN THAT WATER to turn that water
[1:51] into wine. And you have to be willing to
[1:54] BE A VESSEL POURED OUT.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE to be willing to say, "LORD,
[1:58] POUR ME OUT."
[1:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY, LORD. I SURRENDER. POUR me
[2:02] out. And if there's nothing left when
[2:05] you're done, that's okay. Though he SLAY
[2:08] ME, YET WILL I trust him. YOU HAVE TO
[2:10] UNDERSTAND THAT ALMIGHTY GOD IS IN
[2:12] COMPLETE and total control of YOUR LIFE.
[2:14] YOU HAVE TO TRUST HIM. YOU HAVE to
[2:16] surrender to him. You have to know that
[2:18] the giants of Anoch do not DRAW THEIR
[2:20] SWORDS WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; And you have to know everything that has
[2:24] happened in your life sitting here today
[2:27] HAS BEEN ORDAINED OF JESUS CHRIST. IT
[2:29] HAS BEEN ORDAINED FOR THE BRIDEGROOM
[2:31] because he WANTS TO TURN YOUR WATER INTO
[2:34] WINE. HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU LIVE AND
[2:36] BREATHE THE WORD OF GOD ITSELF
[2:39] &gt;&gt; more than you want it.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Then you wonder what's wrong. You need
[2:43] the quickening. You need God to come by
[2:46] your way. You need him to come. You need
[2:49] the bridegroom.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
