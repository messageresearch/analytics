[12:45] you love him because he first loved you
[12:48] our love is only in response to his love
[12:51] that came
[12:51] first praise be to god it's wonderful to
[12:54] be here with you this evening
[12:56] sure appreciate the atmosphere man let's
[12:58] just turn to matthew 22 together
[13:01] i'd like to continue on with some of the
[13:03] thought from sunday
[13:05] it just wouldn't leave me altogether so
[13:07] praise the lord we'll keep moving in
[13:08] that direction
[13:10] but i'd like to take the title if i
[13:12] could this evening on the ministry of
[13:14] intercession
[13:15] the ministry of intercession and we'll
[13:18] begin here matthew 22 this is a bit of a
[13:20] review we've read
[13:21] this sunday we'll go over it again
[13:24] matthew 22 and 34.
[13:31] but when the pharisees had heard that he
[13:33] had put the sadducees to silence they
[13:35] were gathered together
[13:37] then one of them which was a lawyer
[13:38] asked him a question tempting him and
[13:40] saying
[13:40] master which is the great commandment in
[13:43] the law
[13:44] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[13:46] lord thy god with all thy heart
[13:48] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[13:51] is the first and great commandment
[13:53] and the second is like unto it thou
[13:55] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[13:57] on these two commandments hang all the
[13:59] law and the prophets
[14:02] praise god if we could just master these
[14:04] two things we've mastered it all
[14:06] praise be to god let's pray the heavenly
[14:09] father we thank you lord
[14:11] for your word well we just pray that you
[14:13] would have preeminence among us lord
[14:15] that everything we say and all that we
[14:17] do
[14:18] and lord to hunger in our hearts and to
[14:20] pull on the word and
[14:21] the speaking forth would all be done for
[14:24] your glory and be pleasing to you lord
[14:26] we pray lord that you would just take
[14:28] your time and speak to our hearts lord
[14:30] and
[14:30] deliver to us lord that which you have
[14:33] for us in this hour what we have need of
[14:35] to accomplish your goal and your purpose
[14:37] have preeminence among us in a greater
[14:39] way
[14:40] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[14:43] you can all be seated let's turn from
[14:46] here over to matthew 12 and we'll pick
[14:48] up this
[14:49] same discord over here and a mark i mean
[14:51] i'm sorry mark chapter 12.
[14:54] it's the same question and jesus gives a
[14:57] similar answer but
[14:58] but i like the way he answers this over
[15:00] here as well
[15:01] in mark chapter 12
[15:04] and verse 29
[15:08] and jesus answered him the first of all
[15:10] the commandments is hero israel the lord
[15:12] our god is one lord
[15:13] and i shall love the lord thy god with
[15:15] all thy heart with all thy soul
[15:17] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[15:20] this is the first commandment
[15:21] and the second is like namely this thou
[15:24] shalt love the
[15:25] thy neighbor as thyself there is none
[15:27] other commandment greater than these
[15:30] and so we we talked about that last
[15:32] sunday and we labored on that for a bit
[15:34] but but all the long the prophets hang
[15:37] on these two
[15:38] the first one is love the lord thy god
[15:40] with all thy heart with all thy
[15:42] mind with all thy strength amen with all
[15:45] thy soul
[15:46] and the second is likened to it thou
[15:48] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[15:50] so the capstone is love
[15:54] the the the whole all of the law and all
[15:57] the prophets hang on these commandments
[15:58] love god and love your neighbor
[16:00] amen there's none other commandments
[16:02] greater than these and the capstone
[16:04] is the same thing and so we believe that
[16:06] the capstones come down and we're a
[16:08] capstone ministry is that right
[16:10] and so that this is the age for this
[16:12] this word to live in us
[16:14] and if it's in the scriptures and it's
[16:16] calling for it in this hour
[16:18] then we can have it it's available you
[16:20] know it may seem so
[16:22] far away we know our own temperament we
[16:24] know our own personalities we know
[16:26] our complexes and the things we've
[16:27] struggled with but this isn't the hour
[16:30] for complexes to come forth this is the
[16:31] hour for the word to come forward
[16:33] this isn't the hour for the genetics to
[16:35] take preeminence over the word
[16:37] but this is the hour for the word to
[16:38] take preeminence over the genetics
[16:41] but we get what we believe if we believe
[16:43] our genetics will override the word
[16:45] then that's exactly what we're going to
[16:47] get and if we believe that our complexes
[16:49] amen
[16:50] are stronger than the word then that's
[16:52] exactly what we're going to experience
[16:54] but if we can by faith say this word
[16:56] overrules my complex
[16:58] this overrules my hurt this overrules my
[17:01] past
[17:02] this overrules my genetics this word
[17:04] this
[17:05] this capstone of the capstone ministry
[17:08] this part of christ that he's displaying
[17:10] in this day
[17:10] the fullness has come and it's for me
[17:14] to display in this hour we've come to
[17:17] that and we have to hold that in our
[17:19] minds we have to believe it by faith in
[17:21] our hearts
[17:21] and we have to move forward amen with
[17:24] this
[17:25] before us this is the goal this is what
[17:27] we're walking towards and we have to
[17:29] believe that it's possible
[17:32] we have to believe it's what he wants we
[17:33] believe it's in his word but we have to
[17:35] believe it's what he wants and we have
[17:36] to believe it's possible
[17:38] and if we move forward that way we will
[17:40] get what we believe
[17:43] amen we're not expecting anything
[17:44] outside the word this is just the word
[17:47] let's go over to first corinthians while
[17:48] we're still in our review first
[17:50] corinthians 13.
[17:52] let's read we just read the first part
[17:54] of this but we're going to read the
[17:55] whole
[17:56] chapter i believe uh
[17:59] first corinthians chapter one
[18:03] amen i told you before when i spoke on
[18:05] sunday
[18:06] when whenever i would hear somebody
[18:07] start preaching on love because of the
[18:09] abuses because of the
[18:11] uh the unscriptural application i always
[18:14] recoiled inside
[18:16] because the the the teaching on love was
[18:18] always you know love everybody
[18:20] be sweet you know pass out candy
[18:23] everything's fine
[18:24] nobody's bad nothing's wrong but that's
[18:26] not love that's not god's kind of love
[18:29] god's kind of love is the rod there's
[18:30] the rod of correction that'll whack you
[18:33] on the tail when you're wrong
[18:34] and come along and comfort you and bring
[18:36] you back in line
[18:38] that's god's kind of love god's kind of
[18:39] love it brings the truth and brings it
[18:41] straight and brings it on us
[18:43] but also will advocate for you to get
[18:45] back in line
[18:47] amen so the god's kind of love is is a
[18:49] strong
[18:50] love it's a powerful love and it's not a
[18:52] tied
[18:53] just to our emotions and just to
[18:55] affection because emotions and
[18:56] affections they move around they
[18:58] fluctuate
[18:59] they go up and down but this kind of
[19:01] love doesn't move it's rock-solid
[19:04] amen it's eternal it's set it's not
[19:06] changing
[19:08] so this is you the capstone is love so
[19:11] we can't get away from talking about it
[19:13] but we don't want to talk about it in
[19:14] humanistic terms we want to understand
[19:17] it from god's vantage point
[19:20] uh first corinthians 13 1 though i speak
[19:23] with the tongue of men and of angels and
[19:25] have not charity
[19:26] i am become a sounding brass or a
[19:28] tinkling symbol
[19:29] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[19:31] and understand all mysteries
[19:33] and all knowledge and though i have all
[19:34] faith so that i could remove
[19:36] mountains and have not charity i am
[19:38] nothing
[19:39] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[19:41] the poor and though i give my body to be
[19:43] burned and
[19:44] have not charity it profits me nothing
[19:47] charity suffereth long now look at the
[19:49] attributes of this kind of love
[19:51] charity suffereth long it's long
[19:53] suffering
[19:55] is kind charity envieth not
[19:59] it vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[20:03] this kind of love is not self-serving
[20:08] this kind of love is not self-focused
[20:12] this is a sacrificial love it doesn't
[20:14] envy it is not jealous of others than in
[20:17] the others
[20:17] it's not puffed up it doesn't try to
[20:20] vaunt itself and put itself forward
[20:22] this kind of love does none of that
[20:25] amen verse 5 it does not behave itself
[20:28] unseemingly seeketh not her own is not
[20:32] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[20:36] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[20:39] in the truth
[20:40] beareth all things believeth all things
[20:43] hopeth all things endureth all things
[20:47] praise god this kind of love can bear
[20:49] through anything
[20:51] all the dirt and trash that the devil
[20:53] can pour on this love can bear through
[20:55] it
[20:56] this love can endure all things
[21:00] amen let's keep reading
[21:04] charity never faileth
[21:08] but whether there be prophecies they
[21:09] shall fail whether there be tongues
[21:11] they shall cease whether there be
[21:13] knowledge it shall vanish away
[21:15] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[21:17] part but when that which is perfect is
[21:19] come then that which is in part shall be
[21:21] done away
[21:23] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[21:25] understood as a child i thought as a
[21:27] child
[21:27] but when i became a man i put away
[21:29] childish things for now we see through a
[21:31] glass darkly but then face to face now i
[21:34] know in part but then shall i know even
[21:36] as also i am known
[21:37] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[21:40] three
[21:41] but the greatest of these is charity
[21:44] praise the lord charity love
[21:47] is strong bears it endures
[21:52] not vain not puffed up doesn't think
[21:56] itself
[21:57] is sacrificial is enduring is firm
[22:00] is strong is powerful that's this kind
[22:03] of love
[22:05] i want to talk about intercession now
[22:07] this is this was a bit of a review from
[22:09] sunday but
[22:09] intercession the definition just out of
[22:12] webster's i believe it is
[22:14] intercession the action of intervening
[22:16] on behalf
[22:17] of another the action of intervening on
[22:20] behalf of another
[22:21] and so this kind of love doesn't seek
[22:24] its own
[22:25] but seeks the better of another and we
[22:27] talk about the ministry of intercession
[22:29] the action of intervening on behalf of
[22:32] another
[22:33] and and i say this way when you get
[22:36] nothing out of the deal
[22:40] god not for game not for notoriety
[22:44] not not just just
[22:47] intervening on behalf of somebody else
[22:51] and with to go back and talk about moses
[22:53] when moses stood in the gap
[22:55] amen and he and he told god not to do
[22:58] away with israel
[22:59] and then he you know not to do away with
[23:01] the nation and and he went down
[23:03] and and executed the judgment of god and
[23:06] calling for the levites to come stand by
[23:08] him and they slew three thousand of
[23:09] their brother in that day and
[23:11] demolished the golden calf and made him
[23:13] drink it and all of these things
[23:15] but but then he went up on the mountain
[23:18] the next day to make an atonement for
[23:20] them to what stand in the gap for them
[23:23] and look at what he says he says father
[23:25] forgive them of their sin and if not
[23:27] blot my name out of your book moses was
[23:30] not going up there and standing in the
[23:32] gap to get anything out of this deal
[23:34] he was willing to lose all for the sake
[23:37] of somebody else
[23:40] and so it this is in and brother venom
[23:44] told us he said i never could understand
[23:46] how moses could have a better idea than
[23:48] god because but then i realized
[23:50] it was christ in moses that that's what
[23:52] god was looking for
[23:54] he needed somebody who would stand in
[23:56] the gap somebody who would stand in the
[23:58] breach
[23:58] because god was going to destroy them
[24:00] all had not somebody had not moses
[24:03] stood in the breach so somebody amen
[24:05] under the anointing of christ had to
[24:07] stand in the gap
[24:08] and be willing to give up everything so
[24:10] somebody else could go free
[24:13] praise god so the intercession is the
[24:16] action of intervening on behalf
[24:18] of another let's go and look at ezekiel
[24:21] 22
[24:22] together and we'll spend a little bit of
[24:24] time here in ezekiel
[24:29] ezekiel 22
[24:38] and verse 29
[24:42] ezekiel 22 and verse 29.
[24:48] and the people of the land have used
[24:50] oppression and exercised robbery and
[24:52] have vexed the poor and needy
[24:54] yeah they have oppressed a stranger
[24:56] wrongfully and i
[24:58] sought for a man among them that should
[24:59] make up the hedge
[25:01] and stand in the gap before me for the
[25:03] land
[25:04] and that i should not destroy it but i
[25:06] found
[25:07] none therefore have i poured out my
[25:09] indignation upon them
[25:11] i have consumed them with the fire of my
[25:13] wrath their own way
[25:15] have i recompensed upon their heads
[25:17] saith the lord god
[25:19] so they had done wrong they had
[25:20] oppressed the poor we talked about this
[25:23] at the very end of the service last time
[25:24] they were guilty they were done wrong
[25:27] but before god
[25:28] poured out his wrath first he was
[25:29] looking for a man
[25:31] that would stand in the gap somebody
[25:33] that would take up the hedge that would
[25:35] stand in the gap
[25:35] and say father don't do this don't do it
[25:38] oh god don't
[25:39] don't cross over me to hurt them i'm
[25:41] standing here to guard them to shield
[25:43] them to block them
[25:45] he was looking for somebody that would
[25:47] stand in the gap and take up the hedge
[25:48] and when he found none
[25:50] he poured out his wrath and right now
[25:53] the bride of jesus christ on this earth
[25:56] is standing
[25:57] in the gap because if it wasn't for her
[25:59] the wrath of god would already be poured
[26:01] out with no restraint
[26:03] with no restraint until it completely
[26:05] destroys and brings in a millennial
[26:07] reign
[26:09] so so now we find out that there's
[26:11] somebody standing in the gap
[26:13] but he was looking for somebody nobody
[26:16] was there so he went ahead
[26:17] he said therefore verse 31 therefore
[26:19] have i poured out my indignation upon
[26:21] them
[26:22] i have consumed them if he had found a
[26:24] man who would stand in the gap
[26:26] it would have stopped the destruction
[26:28] but because he found none the
[26:29] destruction came
[26:31] now we're looking at that for the whole
[26:33] land and i talked about the position of
[26:34] the bride
[26:35] but what about for a brother or sister
[26:38] what about for somebody else
[26:40] i mean are we willing to stand in the
[26:42] gap to make up the hedge
[26:44] amen are we willing to stand alongside
[26:46] or intercede
[26:48] amen for somebody else an action of
[26:50] intervening on behalf of another
[26:52] but i remember talking about when your
[26:53] brother he's done you're wrong done
[26:55] you're really wrong you know he's guilty
[26:57] as guilty can be
[26:58] amen you go you stand shoulder to
[27:00] shoulder with that brother
[27:02] what are you doing you're interceding
[27:04] for him you're not just saying
[27:06] whatever i don't care what happens to
[27:07] him no i care what happens to him i
[27:09] don't want anything bad to happen to him
[27:11] if i've got a desire for evil to happen
[27:13] to him there's something wrong with my
[27:15] heart
[27:16] if there's a desire in me that something
[27:18] evil will happen to him just because
[27:20] he did evil to me then there's something
[27:22] wrong with me
[27:23] amen because christ was willing to throw
[27:25] himself in the breach
[27:26] to those who had done him horribly wrong
[27:30] amen we've got that we've got we've got
[27:32] to say god you've got to break down
[27:34] all of self amen so i can get to this
[27:37] place
[27:38] that i my life matches exactly your word
[27:40] and your character
[27:42] to where if somebody's done me wrong i
[27:44] can stay there and say god
[27:45] i'm hurt by what they did i don't
[27:47] understand why they've done
[27:49] but lord would you heal me and would you
[27:51] help my brother
[27:52] and brother ma'am you stay there and
[27:54] then god begins to talk back to you
[27:56] it begins to show you what your brothers
[27:58] went through and show you
[28:00] why he's done that and then you start
[28:02] feeling sorry for him
[28:03] what happens compassion starts to come
[28:05] in because you recognize
[28:07] your brother's in the condition he's in
[28:09] because of something that he's went
[28:10] through
[28:11] or something that's happened to him and
[28:13] then you begin to intercede for him say
[28:14] god let him go i forgive him i pray you
[28:17] forgive him
[28:20] now let's go back here to ezekiel 9.
[28:23] let's go back earlier in the book of
[28:25] ezekiel ezekiel 9.
[28:29] let's look before he poured out his
[28:30] destruction this is earlier on
[28:36] ezekiel chapter 9 and we'll begin at
[28:38] verse 1.
[28:41] he cried also in mine ears with a loud
[28:43] voice saying cause them that have charge
[28:45] over the city to draw near
[28:47] even every man with his destroying
[28:49] weapon in his hand
[28:51] and behold six men came from the way of
[28:53] the higher gate which lie toward the
[28:55] north and every man a slaughter
[28:57] weapon in his hand and one man among
[29:00] them was clothed with linen
[29:01] with a writer's ink horn by a side and
[29:04] they went in and stood beside the brazen
[29:06] altar
[29:06] and the glory of god of israel was gone
[29:09] up from the cherub
[29:10] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[29:12] house and he called to the man clothed
[29:14] with linen
[29:15] which had the writer's ink horn by his
[29:17] side and the lord said unto him
[29:19] go through the midst of the city through
[29:21] the midst of jerusalem
[29:23] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[29:25] men that sigh
[29:26] and that cry for all the abominations
[29:28] that be done in the midst thereof
[29:30] and to the others he said in mine
[29:32] hearing go you after him through the
[29:34] city and smite
[29:35] let not your eyes spare neither have ye
[29:37] pity slay utterly old and young both
[29:40] maids and little children and women
[29:42] but come not near any man upon whom is
[29:44] the mark
[29:45] and begin at my sanctuary then they
[29:47] began at the ancient men
[29:49] which were before the house so he's
[29:52] going to bring a destruction he's going
[29:53] to bring a correction
[29:54] amen but he's got the man with the ink
[29:56] horn and brother benham talks about this
[29:58] in in a couple places we'll read it here
[30:01] from leadership 1965.
[30:03] now look at yourself really are you a
[30:05] genuine bible christian
[30:07] full of love of god remember the bible
[30:09] said the last days when his times take
[30:11] place he said a marking angel went
[30:13] through the churches
[30:14] went through the cities and sealed only
[30:15] those who sighed and cried
[30:17] for the abomination that was done in the
[30:19] city is that right ezekiel 9 we know
[30:21] that's the truth
[30:22] the marking angel went forth and put a
[30:24] mark on their head
[30:25] forehead sealed them them that sighed
[30:28] and cried
[30:29] after that came the slaughtering angels
[30:31] from the four corners of the earth
[30:32] which is coming right away we see it
[30:34] coming war is moving right in
[30:36] that'll kill the whole earth off there
[30:38] was nothing that they
[30:39] couldn't touch but them that had the
[30:41] mark now back out is your heart so
[30:44] concerned about the sinners
[30:45] and the way that the church and the
[30:46] people are doing until you can sigh and
[30:48] cry about it day and night
[30:50] if not so i'm wondering that's the
[30:52] scriptures
[30:53] brother branham i mean he makes a high
[30:55] standard when he starts to talk about
[30:57] this
[30:57] he starts to talk about you know we
[30:59] ought to have this kind of experience of
[31:01] sighing and crying
[31:02] but when you look at ezekiel amen he was
[31:05] sighing and crying over the sins that
[31:07] were done in the midst of jerusalem
[31:09] in the city which is the church and they
[31:13] were grieved over what was happening in
[31:15] the church
[31:15] and there's people sighing and crying
[31:17] over what was happening in the church
[31:19] in the midst of jerusalem amen who who
[31:22] was it
[31:23] that was crying out for the sins and the
[31:25] abominations that were done in the
[31:27] church
[31:28] you know that was the city that was
[31:30] jerusalem that was the church
[31:32] and brother bannon says what about the
[31:33] sinner what about the church who's
[31:35] sighing and crying about that
[31:37] because you know there's a heaviness
[31:39] that comes when you start to see
[31:41] brethren doing wrong
[31:46] you know it wasn't that those people
[31:48] they could say well
[31:49] that one's wrong and that one's wrong
[31:52] and that one's wrong and that one's
[31:53] wrong and that one's wrong and that
[31:54] one's wrong
[31:55] but i'm right and walk away satisfied
[31:59] that i can identify error and somehow
[32:02] makes me
[32:03] feel justified that i can identify error
[32:06] and now i feel good about myself
[32:08] i must be right because i have the
[32:09] ability to identify error
[32:12] you know who else can identify heir the
[32:14] accuser of the brethren
[32:16] the accuser of the brethren is gifted to
[32:19] identify
[32:19] error
[32:23] is that right and you don't want to be
[32:26] in his camp amen and you want to just
[32:28] take up his side
[32:30] and become an accuser of the brethren
[32:32] but yet
[32:33] these people who were sighing and crying
[32:35] over the abominations that were done in
[32:36] the city
[32:37] that were done in jerusalem the holy
[32:39] city of the holy people
[32:40] amen they could identify the wrong
[32:42] absolutely or else they wouldn't have
[32:44] sighed and cried over the abominations
[32:46] they could also identify the wrong but
[32:48] they weren't as the accuser of the
[32:50] brethren
[32:51] they were taking the part of christ and
[32:53] they were sighing and crying say oh god
[32:55] forgive us
[32:56] oh god help us oh god bring a change
[32:59] open the eyes of my brother open the
[33:01] eyes of my sister
[33:02] change this circumstance they were
[33:04] sighing and crying
[33:06] for the abominations that were done in
[33:08] the midst of the city
[33:11] you know it'd be a shameful place amen
[33:14] for the bride of jesus christ to get
[33:16] into a place
[33:17] where she becomes the accuser of the
[33:18] brethren
[33:19] [Applause]
[33:22] without the capacity to sigh and cry
[33:28] things go wrong sometimes people do
[33:31] wrong
[33:32] things happen that are wrong is that
[33:36] right
[33:38] but who is interceding
[33:42] who is it who's out there that's not
[33:44] happy that something's wrong
[33:48] who's grieved over the sin and the
[33:51] abomination
[33:52] that's done in the midst of jerusalem
[33:56] who's grieved amen when we when we see
[34:00] you know when we see our brothers and
[34:02] sisters some of us going the wrong
[34:03] direction
[34:05] when we see worldliness and worldly
[34:07] entertainment creeping in in a family or
[34:09] in a brother
[34:10] who's excited about that the accuser of
[34:13] the brethren
[34:16] and you can't help when you see it
[34:17] there's an honesty that comes with this
[34:19] kind of love
[34:20] it's true and it loves the truth
[34:23] charity loveth truth amen and there's a
[34:27] real truth to say
[34:28] what that that's wrong that's not right
[34:31] that's the truth
[34:32] amen but at the same token just as soon
[34:35] as that
[34:35] that charity can recognize that's wrong
[34:38] the truth is that's wrong
[34:39] charity also can intercede for the wrong
[34:42] and say god forgive my brother forgive
[34:44] my sister
[34:45] and can enter in because this is one
[34:48] holy city of jerusalem
[34:50] and can enter and say god forgive us for
[34:53] our wrong
[34:55] brother branham could do that he could
[34:57] stand at the at the pulpit and he said
[34:59] god forgive us for our sins
[35:02] could enter right in with the brothers
[35:04] and sisters right in
[35:05] god forgive us for backbiting god
[35:08] forgive us for all the transgressions
[35:10] god forgive
[35:11] us for all of these different ways
[35:13] there's got to be
[35:14] somebody because if there's not somebody
[35:17] to stand in the gap god will pour his
[35:19] wrath
[35:19] out upon it and i don't want to see my
[35:21] brother and sister under the wrath of
[35:23] god's judgment
[35:24] i want to stand in the gap and say god
[35:26] forgive them i need them
[35:27] they need me we all this this holy
[35:30] jerusalem's got to be right
[35:32] it's got to be purged it's got to be
[35:34] clean it's got to be correct
[35:36] and i'm not happy when i see abomination
[35:38] and i'm not satisfied
[35:40] like just my little corner is going to
[35:41] be fine my little corner is not going to
[35:43] be fine till the whole thing's purified
[35:47] things are not going to be right till
[35:49] everything's right
[35:51] it behooves all of us amen to intercede
[35:54] for one another
[35:55] amen because really we all have a time
[35:58] we need somebody to intercede for us
[36:00] because there's things that
[36:02] all of us have weak spots and blindness
[36:04] amen and things that we can't see
[36:06] but other people can see it so clear
[36:08] amen we're always blind to our own
[36:10] condition but can see another
[36:12] but if i amen if i can just throw myself
[36:16] in the breach for a brother or sister
[36:18] then there's a brother and sister that
[36:20] can throw themselves in the breach for
[36:22] me
[36:22] [Applause]
[36:24] amen if i take up a critical spirit and
[36:27] i start to become the criticizer of the
[36:29] accuser of the brethren
[36:30] there's going to be another brother that
[36:32] becomes the accuser of me
[36:35] and i can't afford that i'm too weak and
[36:37] too needy
[36:38] i'm too flawed and have too many
[36:40] problems amen i need
[36:41] somebody to intercede for me and how can
[36:44] i ask somebody to intercede on my behalf
[36:46] until i'm ready to intercede on somebody
[36:48] else's behalf
[36:51] amen you know we've started the prayer
[36:54] time on friday and saturday
[36:56] amen and there's such there's such an
[36:58] atmosphere in the sanctuary if you've
[36:59] had the opportunity to come
[37:01] you know what i'm talking about when you
[37:02] enter in it's an absolute brokenness
[37:05] that you hit
[37:06] no pride no arrogancy but an absolute
[37:10] anointing in the sanctuary that just
[37:11] breaks you down
[37:12] i tell you that's the time to intercede
[37:15] let's use that time wisely when we come
[37:17] here on friday we come on saturday
[37:19] let's start interceding and say god
[37:22] would you help us all
[37:23] help your bride we're not in the
[37:25] condition we should be
[37:28] can we do that can we throw ourselves in
[37:29] the lump because there's only one bride
[37:32] there's not two there's not ten there's
[37:35] only one bride
[37:36] of jesus christ so
[37:39] whether we like it or not we're in the
[37:40] mix and if there's abomination in the
[37:43] bride
[37:44] it's affecting you and i
[37:48] it doesn't matter if it's the pew next
[37:50] to you and if it doesn't matter if it's
[37:51] on the other side of the globe
[37:52] if there's abomination in the bride it's
[37:54] affecting you and i
[37:59] we are linked through a mystical link
[38:03] and it behooves us all to intercede and
[38:05] say god
[38:06] you've got to help us rise above this
[38:08] global seeing condition
[38:09] you've got to help us lord not cut all
[38:12] the world
[38:13] off of us lord don't don't sit
[38:16] in the house of the scornful and sit up
[38:18] on your pedestal
[38:19] and say god if you could just bring
[38:21] everybody up to where i am
[38:25] that's not the way to intercede the way
[38:28] to intercede is throw yourself on the
[38:29] floor
[38:31] face down and say woe is me i'm a man of
[38:34] unclean lips and i dwell amongst the
[38:36] people of unclean
[38:37] help us all god we all need your help
[38:41] i need to go higher we all need to go
[38:43] higher we need the world
[38:44] cut off more and more and more amen we
[38:46] need to be clean
[38:47] we need to be purified well you need to
[38:49] have a greater preeminence among us than
[38:51] what you have now
[38:53] we're all in this thing together man
[38:56] there's
[38:57] no no no place just to point fingers
[39:02] and we see things we see things in one
[39:04] another that's grieving
[39:07] we see things that are just grieving
[39:10] and just they they're devastating to us
[39:13] because we know that they're wrong
[39:15] see it in your family you see it
[39:17] extended family you see it here you see
[39:19] it other places
[39:20] you'll see things that are wrong the
[39:23] question is why did god let you see it
[39:28] and why did god give you the discernment
[39:30] to discern that that's the wrong spirit
[39:32] that's that's not right
[39:36] so you can criticize
[39:40] or so you can intercede
[39:45] you know if if god opens your eyes and
[39:48] you can accurately discern a situation
[39:50] and say
[39:50] this isn't right what that family doing
[39:52] is not right what that young person is
[39:54] doing is not right what's happening here
[39:56] or over there is not right
[39:58] amen if god has opened your eyes and you
[40:00] can see that you can accurately discern
[40:01] it by the word
[40:02] that means you're the one to intercede
[40:05] that means you're the one who can stand
[40:07] in the gap
[40:08] because god's given you by revelation
[40:10] and ability to see and
[40:11] in in and identify by revelation then
[40:14] you're the one to stand in the gap
[40:16] you're the one to fall on your face
[40:18] you're the one to take your brother or
[40:20] sister
[40:21] with you amen before the throne of god
[40:23] and say god i'm here
[40:25] with my brother amen and i'm asking that
[40:28] you help us
[40:30] i'm telling you use that terminology
[40:32] amen
[40:33] get get away from help them and help
[40:35] them and help that
[40:36] and start using the terminology of one
[40:39] bride and one
[40:40] body amen and say god help us amen
[40:43] if i smash my finger amen i'm not saying
[40:46] god would you help the little tip of my
[40:49] finger the last
[40:50] two quarter or last half of an inch or
[40:51] quarter of an inch no i say god help me
[40:53] i'm hurting
[40:55] because it's all me every part of it's
[40:58] me
[40:59] amen and every part's linked to another
[41:01] part
[41:03] can we get to the place where we can
[41:05] intercede that way
[41:06] when we see something wrong amen we can
[41:08] take amen spiritually we can take
[41:11] in in our own hearts that brother that
[41:13] sister
[41:14] to the throne of god with us and stand
[41:16] there with our arm around them shoulder
[41:18] to shoulder and say god
[41:19] we need your help right now and my
[41:22] brother
[41:23] for some reason has got caught in a trap
[41:25] or some circumstances
[41:26] got him derailed or are on the wrong
[41:28] track i don't know why
[41:30] but god i'm asking that you help us help
[41:33] us oh what what
[41:36] language friends what language
[41:41] pride is not not part of love
[41:44] love is not puffed up it's not vaunteth
[41:46] itself
[41:48] doesn't envy says this is a strong kind
[41:52] of love
[41:53] this is a powerful kind of love let's
[41:56] look at romans chapter nine
[41:58] i referred to this but we didn't read it
[42:01] sunday but i'd like to read it together
[42:15] romans 9
[42:19] and verse 1 i say the truth in christ i
[42:23] lie not
[42:24] my conscience also bearing me witness in
[42:26] the holy ghost
[42:27] that i have great heaviness and
[42:29] continual sorrow in my heart
[42:32] the apostle paul is going to start
[42:33] talking about his brethren the jews
[42:36] i'm going to ask you who was it that
[42:38] mistreated paul the most
[42:42] his kinsmen his kinfolk the jews
[42:45] they mistreated him they abused him they
[42:48] mocked him
[42:49] they lied about him they beat him they
[42:52] he was
[42:53] he was evilly treated by his own kinsmen
[42:57] but here he says i have great heaviness
[43:00] and continual sorrow in my heart
[43:04] for i could wish that myself were
[43:06] accursed from
[43:07] christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[43:11] according to the flesh
[43:14] that's somebody who knows how to stand
[43:15] in the gap
[43:18] that that's a challenge to me
[43:21] that attitude that approach is a
[43:24] challenge to me
[43:26] you talk about setting a high standard
[43:29] you talk about perfect love
[43:31] you talk about something that you'll
[43:32] never attain to with humanism or
[43:34] carnality or the carnal mind
[43:36] you're never going to get here with a
[43:38] humanistic way
[43:39] amen but if we're ever going to get to
[43:40] this place it's going to be christ
[43:42] on the inside amen christ taking
[43:44] preeminence in us
[43:46] but he says i i have great heaviness and
[43:48] continual sorrow in my heart
[43:50] for i could wish that myself were a
[43:52] curse from christ for my brethren
[43:55] he said i could you know he can't change
[43:57] what god has done
[43:58] any more than then moses could make god
[44:00] blot his name out of the book god said
[44:02] no i'm not going to do it
[44:03] but he had this sorrow in his heart this
[44:06] heaviness
[44:07] that if it was possible he could wish
[44:09] himself wish himself a curse from christ
[44:12] for his brethren's sake
[44:15] i'm telling you that's the nature of
[44:17] christ
[44:18] paul wasn't going anywhere god had
[44:21] already wrote his name in the lamb's
[44:22] book of life
[44:23] he was predestinated it wasn't changed
[44:25] condition but he had such a heaviness
[44:27] such a sorrow such a love such a desire
[44:31] that he could even wish himself a curse
[44:33] from christ for their sake if it was
[44:34] possible
[44:36] knowing that it wasn't possible i tell
[44:38] you friends there's
[44:39] there's something tremendous about this
[44:41] kind of love
[44:44] to where we want others so bad
[44:47] to be right to be saved amen to be born
[44:50] again we want it
[44:51] so bad that we become heavy and with
[44:54] sorrow in our heart
[44:55] because we're longing for things to be
[44:57] made right
[44:58] oh i tell you this is what i want this
[45:00] is what i want so bad
[45:02] when i say god you've got to build this
[45:04] in me i'm not where i need to be
[45:07] but oh praise god for opening our eyes
[45:09] we can see how short we are
[45:11] and when we recognize how short we are
[45:12] intercession's not a problem anymore
[45:14] because somebody's going to have to
[45:16] intercede for me because i'm not where
[45:17] i'm supposed to be
[45:19] somebody's gonna have to say oh help my
[45:21] brother chad amen help him to get over
[45:23] himself and
[45:24] get past himself so he can get to this
[45:26] place
[45:29] we need each other
[45:32] the apostle paul just like
[45:37] just like moses was willing to throw
[45:39] himself in the breach
[45:41] was willing was willing to be lost
[45:46] so that somebody else could be saved
[45:49] so god help us brother branham
[45:54] in the message questions and answers
[45:56] 1964
[45:57] he's referring back to what we read
[45:58] about ezekiel mark those who sigh and
[46:00] cry
[46:01] says the sign cry for the abominations
[46:04] that did in the city
[46:05] where do you see that i can show you ten
[46:07] thousand speaking in tongues to one
[46:09] that's really burdened for sin
[46:12] listen to this listen to this
[46:16] because the pinnacle of christianity is
[46:18] not a dynamic display of the spirit
[46:21] [Applause]
[46:23] amen but the pinnacle of christianity is
[46:25] jesus christ nailed to a cross saying
[46:27] father forgive them they don't know what
[46:28] they're doing
[46:30] the pinnacle of christianity is
[46:31] selflessness giving yourself away for
[46:33] the sake of somebody else
[46:35] the pinnacle is not a dynamic display of
[46:38] power
[46:39] or dynamic display of of the presence
[46:42] of the spirit that's not the pinnacle
[46:44] the pinnacle is being able to be spit on
[46:47] mock scourged made fun of rejected by
[46:49] everybody you know
[46:50] strip neck and nail to a cross and still
[46:53] say father forgive them for they don't
[46:54] know what they're doing
[46:56] if you get to that place you've got to
[46:57] the pinnacle of christ-likeness
[47:01] amen we put the wrong emphasis on the
[47:04] wrong thing for far too long
[47:06] but to have the spirit of christ is to
[47:08] act like christ
[47:10] so to have the holy spirit will bring
[47:12] the nature of jesus christ upon us
[47:14] till we get to that place when we're
[47:16] riled up on we don't rile back
[47:19] it's not dynamic show it's not what's
[47:21] seen
[47:22] amen in the dynamic exciting thrilling
[47:25] powerful move of a spirit and a service
[47:28] that's not the pinnacle
[47:30] the pinnacle is in the face of rejection
[47:32] and mockery and scourging
[47:33] and all of those things to still be able
[47:35] to have the nature of jesus christ in
[47:38] the midst of that rejection and hatred
[47:40] and say god i love
[47:41] my brother would you forgive him god i
[47:44] let him go
[47:45] brother branham said in shalom he says i
[47:47] see him walking arrogantly walking away
[47:50] from the truth and i recognize they're
[47:52] under darkness they can't help that
[47:54] i forgive them and i say god please
[47:57] forgive
[47:58] not only to brother branham forgive them
[48:00] he was able to intercede for those
[48:02] who were walking away arrogantly from
[48:04] the truth of the message he was bringing
[48:06] and he was offended by their rejection
[48:10] he preaches it standing in the gap we
[48:12] talked about it sunday he was himself
[48:14] personally offended and he had to get
[48:16] over himself
[48:18] he had to die to himself and get over
[48:21] himself till he could get to the place
[48:23] in shalom
[48:24] amen he was preaching in june of 1963
[48:27] standing in the gap now in january of
[48:30] 1964
[48:31] six months later he's come to the place
[48:33] where he can say
[48:34] it's not their fault they're under gross
[48:37] darkness
[48:37] they can't help it i forgive them
[48:42] see the growth and the maturity and the
[48:45] prophet of god
[48:47] what should be happening to us friends
[48:50] the same kind of growth and maturity
[48:52] amen i want real christianity i don't
[48:55] want a sunday show
[48:56] and a wednesday show i'm looking for the
[48:58] reality in my life
[49:00] i want it monday morning and tuesday
[49:02] afternoon and
[49:03] wednesday i want it friday when
[49:05] everybody it works against me
[49:07] i want the real deal in my life the real
[49:09] life of jesus christ
[49:11] on display in me i'm not looking for a
[49:14] program i'm not going to sunday to get
[49:15] pumped up and get excited
[49:17] and say we're in the right we're in the
[49:18] truth no i want the truth in me
[49:22] and i want to if they shut the church
[49:23] down i still want to have the same life
[49:27] we're not coming for a pep rally we're
[49:29] coming for instructions in righteousness
[49:31] we're coming for correction and reproof
[49:35] why because he's stripping away and
[49:37] stripping away and stripping away
[49:38] until he finally gets the image of jesus
[49:41] christ and the bride that he's been
[49:43] looking for
[49:44] what's he doing sunday and wednesday
[49:46] he's beating the gold
[49:47] and beating the gold and turning it over
[49:49] and beating the gold
[49:50] until he gets his reflection
[49:55] yeah when's it going to be over brother
[49:57] chad until you perfectly reflect the
[49:59] life of jesus christ
[50:02] because judgment begins at the house of
[50:04] god
[50:05] brother baby said this is the judgment
[50:06] seat
[50:08] where he comes in and shows us your
[50:10] backside
[50:12] why because you know it doesn't do us
[50:15] any good to come here every sunday and
[50:17] every wednesday and say
[50:18] your everything's fine you're the bride
[50:20] you're predestined
[50:21] everything's okay oh praise god god
[50:23] loves you so much
[50:24] everything's going to be all right well
[50:26] that's the truth we know that
[50:28] but how's it going to be all right when
[50:30] he beats out
[50:31] this this dross and this part of the
[50:34] world
[50:34] and cuts this off and shaves that off
[50:36] what's he trying to do
[50:38] he's trying to make the second part of
[50:40] the masterpiece
[50:41] which is the masterpiece bride united to
[50:44] the masterpiece groom
[50:45] amen to show what he intended to be in
[50:48] the garden of eden from the very
[50:49] beginning
[50:51] and in order to get that he's got a
[50:53] knock pieces off and knock pieces off
[50:55] amen yeah you know where we're here
[50:57] we're in the studio
[51:00] we're in the art studio
[51:04] and that chunk of marble was happy
[51:07] until he got in the studio
[51:11] and then the artist begins to talk to
[51:13] the marble
[51:15] i chose you out of every other piece of
[51:18] marble i chose you
[51:21] and the marble's like he chose me
[51:25] i plucked you out of the quarry i pulled
[51:28] you from all the other stones
[51:30] i set you on this pedestal and i'm going
[51:33] to make you into a perfect image of what
[51:35] i had in my mind from before the
[51:37] foundation of the world
[51:38] amen and all the sudden the marvel's
[51:40] hallelujah
[51:41] having a revival i'm chosen he's going
[51:44] to make me perfect
[51:46] and then the first hammer blow strikes
[51:48] bang what did you do that for
[51:54] the first major trial the first time he
[51:56] pulls the rug out from you as a new
[51:57] believer
[51:58] and you fall flat on your face amen he
[52:00] answered your prayer and answered your
[52:01] prayer and answered your prayer and all
[52:02] of a sudden
[52:03] i'm going to go through a season where
[52:04] i'm not going to answer any of your
[52:05] prayers what's he doing
[52:07] he's taking the chisel and he's taking
[52:09] the hammer and he's knocking himself
[52:10] away he's
[52:11] knocking immaturity away what's he
[52:13] trying to do he's trying to get the
[52:15] masterpiece formed
[52:20] and we just want to come to church and
[52:21] say i pulled you out of the quarry
[52:23] here and no we're here amen so that he
[52:26] can knock pieces off
[52:28] amen so that he can shape us into his
[52:30] image so he can polish us
[52:32] down amen what does he use to polish us
[52:34] down something abrasive
[52:38] sandpaper or or some sort of polishing
[52:41] compound
[52:42] amen and when when he gets you close
[52:44] he's knocked the big pieces off and
[52:46] you see him put the hammer down oh
[52:48] praise god he put the hammer down
[52:52] then he gets out of sandpaper
[52:58] constant irritation constant there's
[53:01] this spot
[53:04] there's this one spot that he just won't
[53:07] leave alone
[53:08] [Applause]
[53:11] oh we all got him i got more than one
[53:14] he goes from one to the other to the
[53:16] other
[53:18] but what's he trying to do friends he's
[53:20] trying to get that gold to reflect his
[53:23] very
[53:23] image and when we go to church amen and
[53:26] you see him take out the hammer again
[53:28] oh my god why
[53:32] because he loves you because he chose
[53:33] you because he pulled you out
[53:35] because you're more special than any
[53:36] other stone because he's got a plan for
[53:38] you from before the foundation in the
[53:40] world and he's not going to let you go
[53:42] on in
[53:43] imperfect condition he loves you too
[53:46] much you're not like
[53:47] all the other rocks out there you're
[53:48] different and because you're different
[53:51] you don't get away with anything
[53:53] [Applause]
[53:55] he'll harp on your entertainment he'll
[53:56] harp on your thought life
[53:58] he'll hop on the motive behind your
[54:00] action
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:02] [Music]
[54:04] amen what's it coming in your eyes
[54:07] what's coming in your ears
[54:08] what you're mulling about in your heart
[54:10] through the day amen he's coming down
[54:13] he's getting inside of you he's getting
[54:15] to the deepest parts because he's
[54:17] wanting to pluck
[54:17] everything out that's not like him
[54:22] and then he you know things are going
[54:24] good and now
[54:25] now it says now you got to get to the
[54:27] place where you would wish that you
[54:29] could be a curse from christ for
[54:31] somebody else to be saved
[54:36] it's impossible if it wasn't for the
[54:39] master's hands
[54:42] if it wasn't for his skill with the
[54:44] engraving tool
[54:45] if it wasn't for his desire for you to
[54:49] be a masterpiece
[54:50] greater than your desire to be the
[54:52] master
[54:55] you would have quit if you had the
[54:56] option to quit
[55:00] you didn't have the option to quit
[55:05] he comes in for more he comes in for
[55:08] more
[55:08] and all along the way he's telling you
[55:11] you're going to be just like me
[55:13] amen you're going to be perfect
[55:16] the whole world's going to see a display
[55:19] of what's been in my heart
[55:23] the christian life isn't an easy life
[55:26] it's not it's not easy it's not meant to
[55:30] be easy
[55:32] it's not always jovial it wasn't meant
[55:35] to be jovial
[55:37] the life we live especially as we
[55:40] near as we near that great catching away
[55:45] we become a whole lot more introspective
[55:49] a whole lot more thoughtful because when
[55:53] we first started this journey
[55:55] we were worried about getting things
[55:57] right because we wanted to be pleasing
[55:59] to the lord
[56:00] so i remember when i cut the cable to
[56:03] the cable tv
[56:05] it was a major victory in my life and i
[56:08] look at that now and i thought
[56:09] that was kitty stuff
[56:13] that was kitty stuff compared to what
[56:15] he's trying to get out of my life now
[56:20] you know i remember we threw away
[56:22] certain garments of clothes and
[56:24] we quit going to certain places and
[56:26] watching certain things
[56:27] and you know i really thought i mean i'm
[56:31] coming into the image of christ
[56:37] but the graving tool just keeps going
[56:39] deeper
[56:41] deeper deeper
[56:44] because he's going to root out
[56:45] selfishness
[56:48] he's going to root out self love self
[56:51] preservation self self
[56:55] self he's cutting away itself until
[56:58] there's
[56:58] no more you and it's only him
[57:03] and he gets down to not what you did but
[57:06] he gets down to the reason you did it
[57:12] then you get to the place where you walk
[57:13] away from a conversation and there's
[57:15] nothing wrong with the conversation
[57:17] but all of a sudden he starts to dig
[57:18] down in your heart and says
[57:20] you know did you really mean what you
[57:22] said or you just say that to make them
[57:23] like you better
[57:29] that graving until goes deeper and
[57:32] deeper
[57:33] why he wants an honest heart
[57:36] he wants a pure life and guess what
[57:40] he's going to get it because he's the
[57:41] one holding the engraving to him
[57:44] all he's asking for us to do is stay in
[57:46] the studio
[57:48] and trust him don't run away
[57:51] just stay put and trust him
[57:54] trust that he knows what he's doing
[57:56] trust that his hand is sufficient to
[57:59] shape
[58:00] trust that he knows how to use every
[58:02] tool in his bag
[58:03] trust him stay put trust him
[58:07] relax everything's going to be all right
[58:10] he's going to finish the work that he
[58:12] started he's not going to leave it off
[58:13] but he's going to complete what he's
[58:14] begun and you and i
[58:16] and he had in his mind what he wanted of
[58:18] us before we ever came to this earth
[58:20] before the foundation of the world and
[58:22] he will have it we just need to relax
[58:24] and let him have his way
[58:28] back to this quote questions and answers
[58:31] it says the sigh and cry for the
[58:32] abominations that did in the city
[58:34] where do you see that i can show you ten
[58:36] thousand speaking in tongues to one
[58:38] that's really burdened for sin
[58:40] that even that can't even pray a hour
[58:43] but did you know that the bible said to
[58:45] mark only those who signed cried for the
[58:47] abominations in the city
[58:49] how many ever read it sure that was the
[58:51] holy spirit come forth to mark the
[58:53] people
[58:53] and said to the destroying angel go
[58:55] forth and destroy everything that
[58:57] doesn't have the mark upon them and the
[58:59] mark of god is the holy ghost
[59:01] is a seal of god now where is them
[59:04] people that's
[59:05] that interested i can show you people
[59:07] that jump up and down and cry in a
[59:08] church i can show you people that shout
[59:10] and run all over the building
[59:12] i can show you people that prophesy and
[59:13] it comes to pass i can show you those
[59:15] who speak in tongues and run up and down
[59:17] the building and say things that
[59:18] actually interpret and it comes to pass
[59:21] but where is the person that size in
[59:23] christ for the abominations that did in
[59:25] the city
[59:26] where's that burden soul now remember
[59:30] when we go back to ezekiel what was the
[59:31] city
[59:32] jerusalem the church who is sighing and
[59:35] crying for the abominations in the
[59:37] church
[59:37] are we just happy that we have a church
[59:40] are we just excited we have a church
[59:42] or we can or we can have demonstrations
[59:44] or excitement enthusiasm and run up and
[59:46] down the aisles and jump up and down
[59:48] amen and have things happen are we
[59:50] excited about that and then who's out
[59:52] there that's signing and crying for the
[59:53] abominations that's done in the city
[59:56] amen who's sighing and crying amen for
[59:59] the worldliness
[1:00:00] that's in the bride amen for for who's
[1:00:02] sighing and crying for the fussing and
[1:00:04] fighting and the strife that's in the
[1:00:05] bride
[1:00:06] who's sighing and crying for that
[1:00:10] are we just happy we've got a church to
[1:00:11] go to and it's exciting we heard
[1:00:13] something good and we run out and that
[1:00:14] was exciting that was a good service hey
[1:00:16] we got a good church
[1:00:17] who's sighing and crying for the
[1:00:19] abominations that's done in the city
[1:00:22] there's got to be somebody that does it
[1:00:28] it's not right that things aren't right
[1:00:31] i mean that's a self-explanatory
[1:00:33] statement but when you say it you
[1:00:35] realize it hits you with impact
[1:00:37] it's not right that things aren't right
[1:00:42] said sunday you only have one choice or
[1:00:44] you have a couple choices but
[1:00:45] you you're gonna have to either
[1:00:48] recognize
[1:00:49] that the bride's got to come up higher
[1:00:51] as a whole me included
[1:00:53] yes or
[1:00:56] if i don't want to go through the work
[1:00:59] of interceding for their behalf and if i
[1:01:01] don't want to be burdened enough i don't
[1:01:03] want to be tearful
[1:01:04] and if i don't want to sigh and cry and
[1:01:05] pray then i'm going to have to say
[1:01:07] they're not bride
[1:01:09] to let myself off the hook of
[1:01:10] intercession
[1:01:13] because i want to be a lazy christian
[1:01:18] i don't want to be in that category
[1:01:21] my brother's my brother
[1:01:24] my brother's my brother if he believes
[1:01:28] the message he calls himself a brother
[1:01:29] my brother's my brother
[1:01:31] and i'm not going to call him something
[1:01:33] else
[1:01:35] but if i see something that burdening
[1:01:37] and grieving my soul
[1:01:38] i want to have something in me that will
[1:01:40] sigh in christ say god help us
[1:01:42] all help us we're not where we should be
[1:01:45] amen there's too much of the world amen
[1:01:47] i mean there's too much churchianity
[1:01:49] there's too much denomination
[1:01:51] there's too much strife and indifference
[1:01:53] there's too much separation
[1:01:55] god help us
[1:01:58] can we can we be a people that can sigh
[1:02:00] and cry for the abominations that's done
[1:02:02] in the city
[1:02:06] i'll tell you what i'll sign and cry for
[1:02:07] you if you sign and cry for me
[1:02:10] because i need somebody to stand in the
[1:02:12] gap for me he's not done with his
[1:02:14] engraving tool on me yet
[1:02:17] stan let's stand for one another friends
[1:02:22] let's go to genesis 18.
[1:02:43] genesis 18 and 16.
[1:02:48] genesis 18 elohim
[1:02:52] comes to abraham god in flesh
[1:02:55] comes to abraham and brother benham
[1:02:56] types this with his ministry
[1:02:58] three came two went down to sodom which
[1:03:00] was oral roberts and billy graham
[1:03:02] one stayed with the elected group you
[1:03:05] know the seat of abraham
[1:03:06] so he has this meeting and abraham
[1:03:08] confirms the promise and
[1:03:10] and tells him that in in this next
[1:03:12] season of life you're going to conceive
[1:03:15] you're going to have a son and he goes
[1:03:16] through all of this
[1:03:19] and then verse 16 it says and the men
[1:03:20] rose up from thence and looked towards
[1:03:22] sodom and abraham went with them to
[1:03:24] bring them on the way
[1:03:26] and the lord said shall i hide from
[1:03:28] abraham that thing which i do
[1:03:30] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[1:03:31] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:03:33] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:03:35] him
[1:03:36] so now abraham has received
[1:03:39] the promise he's been given a promise
[1:03:43] he you know he he's met god but now god
[1:03:45] has showed up in flesh
[1:03:47] this is the type of brother branham's
[1:03:49] ministry showed up to the elect seed
[1:03:52] you know he had just changed their names
[1:03:54] he's got to give him a new identity
[1:03:56] he said i no longer call you church i
[1:03:57] call you bride
[1:03:59] he comes and he promises that you're
[1:04:01] going to receive the promised son
[1:04:03] it's time amen for for the bride to be
[1:04:05] impregnated
[1:04:06] it's coming time now all of this has
[1:04:09] happened
[1:04:10] and now as soon as that happens amen
[1:04:12] they stand up to rise the two go down to
[1:04:14] sodom and and he goes with this one amen
[1:04:17] this god in flesh is elohim and he walks
[1:04:19] with him and
[1:04:20] and god begins to reveal to abraham what
[1:04:22] he's going to do next and he says
[1:04:24] because you're special because i know
[1:04:28] you and i know you'll bring up your
[1:04:30] household right i
[1:04:31] know amen do you be true to the promise
[1:04:33] you'll be true to the word
[1:04:34] amen i know you'll be true to me because
[1:04:37] of that i can't hide from you what i'm
[1:04:39] going to do
[1:04:41] so you see yourself can you see yourself
[1:04:43] in here
[1:04:48] verse 20 and the lord said because the
[1:04:49] cry of sodom and gomorrs
[1:04:51] is great and because their sin is very
[1:04:53] grievous i will go down now and see
[1:04:55] whether they have done
[1:04:56] altogether according to the cry of it
[1:04:58] which is come unto me and if not i will
[1:05:00] know
[1:05:01] and the men turned their faces from
[1:05:03] thence and went toward sodom but abraham
[1:05:05] stood yet before the lord
[1:05:07] and abraham drew near and said wilt thou
[1:05:09] also destroy the righteous with the
[1:05:10] wicked
[1:05:12] who's he talking to he's talking to god
[1:05:17] i mean how can you ask god a question
[1:05:20] like this
[1:05:22] he's talking to god amen god knows
[1:05:25] everything
[1:05:26] and everything god does is right
[1:05:29] but now he is he's confirmed the promise
[1:05:32] to abraham
[1:05:33] name change i've told him that you're
[1:05:35] going to fulfill the word
[1:05:36] and you're special to me and i know you
[1:05:38] amen and everything's going to work out
[1:05:40] right but this is what i'm going to do
[1:05:41] destruction is coming
[1:05:44] and then he asks the question will thou
[1:05:47] also destroy the righteous with the
[1:05:48] wiccan
[1:05:49] per adventure there be fifty righteous
[1:05:51] within the city will thou also destroy
[1:05:53] and not spare the place for fifty
[1:05:54] righteous that are therein
[1:05:56] that be far from thee to do after this
[1:05:58] manner to slay the righteous with the
[1:06:00] wicked
[1:06:00] and the righteous should be also the
[1:06:02] wiccan that be far from thee shall not
[1:06:04] the judge of all the earth do right
[1:06:07] who's he talking to he's talking to god
[1:06:12] and he's trying to convince god god
[1:06:14] you're
[1:06:15] you're too good your reputation's on the
[1:06:17] st on the line
[1:06:18] don't i mean come on if there's right
[1:06:20] surely you won't
[1:06:22] all the god the righteous judge of the
[1:06:24] earth will do righteously will do right
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:27] what's he doing he's in the place of
[1:06:29] intercession
[1:06:30] he is now interceding god has come in
[1:06:33] flesh
[1:06:34] god has identified him told him it's
[1:06:35] time for the bride to be impregnated
[1:06:37] tells him that destruction is coming and
[1:06:40] immediately he enters into a role of
[1:06:42] intercession
[1:06:44] and he's saying god doesn't strike him
[1:06:46] dead for asking these questions because
[1:06:48] he's portraying
[1:06:49] something in the righteous seat of
[1:06:50] abraham that we should also have
[1:06:53] he's acting the part of christ whenever
[1:06:56] god comes down in judgment
[1:06:58] amen somebody has to play the role of
[1:07:00] mercy
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:03] and now god has come down in judgment to
[1:07:05] decree judgment against sodom and
[1:07:07] gomorrh
[1:07:08] and judge them for their sins somebody's
[1:07:10] got to stand in the gap
[1:07:11] somebody's got to cry for mercy and now
[1:07:14] the royal
[1:07:14] seed amen abraham amen is standing
[1:07:18] in the gap and he's having a
[1:07:20] conversation with god and say god surely
[1:07:22] you won't
[1:07:22] god you can't do this oh god how could
[1:07:24] you do that you're righteous don't you
[1:07:26] know better than this
[1:07:32] and god didn't strike him dead because
[1:07:33] that's the role he was supposed to play
[1:07:36] god was playing the role of the
[1:07:38] righteous judge he was playing the role
[1:07:40] of the interceder
[1:07:42] interceding on behalf of the lost
[1:07:46] do you see your role do you see where
[1:07:48] we're supposed to be
[1:07:53] it goes on god answers 26 and the lord
[1:07:56] said
[1:07:57] if i find in sodom 50 righteous within
[1:07:59] the city then i will spare
[1:08:01] all the place for their sakes now god
[1:08:04] knows exactly who's there
[1:08:08] god knows so god can give him a correct
[1:08:10] answer if i find 50 i will spare it
[1:08:13] because he knows he's not going to spare
[1:08:15] it
[1:08:17] but he's not chastising abraham for
[1:08:20] standing in the gap
[1:08:21] abraham's doing exactly what abraham
[1:08:23] should be doing at this time
[1:08:26] and what do you think the bride of jesus
[1:08:28] christ should be doing
[1:08:29] amen not saying oh god bring your fire
[1:08:32] down and bring me to a millennium but oh
[1:08:34] god
[1:08:35] can you hold it off for another day i've
[1:08:37] got a family member i've got a loved one
[1:08:39] who was abraham looking at he was
[1:08:41] looking at lot down there
[1:08:42] he was saying there's some there there's
[1:08:44] a lot down there my family's down there
[1:08:46] can they come out first lord i mean do
[1:08:49] we have enough burden for our family to
[1:08:51] say god
[1:08:52] could you hold it off one more day you
[1:08:54] realize he's not going to hold it off
[1:08:56] one more day
[1:08:56] he's got an appointed time when the
[1:08:58] wrath will strike when he lifts his
[1:09:00] bride out of here
[1:09:01] but he's wanting us to intercede for
[1:09:03] somebody else
[1:09:04] so that he can move with compassion so
[1:09:06] that he can move with mercy
[1:09:09] can we have enough of the love of god
[1:09:11] and says say god i'm willing to stay
[1:09:14] in the condition i'm in one more day if
[1:09:17] you can get my son if you can get my
[1:09:19] daughter if you can get my parents if
[1:09:21] you can get the ones who've left the
[1:09:22] church if you can get the loss that's
[1:09:24] out there if there's any more seed or
[1:09:26] anybody that can come to life
[1:09:28] amen would you get them lord i'm willing
[1:09:30] to stay longer
[1:09:31] in this horrible dark world
[1:09:37] i think that's the attitude that bryce
[1:09:38] supposed to have
[1:09:41] don't worry he'll pluck you out when the
[1:09:42] right time is to pluck you out
[1:09:45] but can we have enough heart to say i'm
[1:09:47] willing to endure
[1:09:49] satan's eden a little longer
[1:09:53] because there's people that i want to
[1:09:54] see saved
[1:09:57] there's people that i want to see with
[1:09:59] an opportunity at least to do good to
[1:10:01] the bride
[1:10:03] at least can we extend time a little
[1:10:05] longer at least to let them give a cup
[1:10:07] of cold water to somebody
[1:10:08] that they might receive a reward god
[1:10:11] because i care
[1:10:15] praise be the god that's the attitude i
[1:10:18] want to have
[1:10:19] i said god help me verse 27 and abraham
[1:10:23] answered and said behold now
[1:10:25] i have taken upon me to speak unto the
[1:10:27] lord with him but dust and ashes.
[1:10:30] you don't come to god with pride and
[1:10:31] arrogance
[1:10:34] you don't come to god and say now you
[1:10:36] know you said i was perfect
[1:10:38] and you told me you know me that i'm
[1:10:40] going to do everything right
[1:10:42] and so i know they're bad but no
[1:10:46] he comes to god and said i spoke to you
[1:10:48] and i'm but dustin ashes
[1:10:52] per adventure there shall lack five of
[1:10:54] the fifty righteous will thou destroy
[1:10:56] all the city for lack of five
[1:10:58] and he said if i find there forty and
[1:11:00] five i will not destroy him
[1:11:01] and he's spaking to him yet again and
[1:11:03] said per adventure there be forty found
[1:11:05] there
[1:11:05] and he said i will not do it for the
[1:11:07] forty sake and he said unto him
[1:11:09] oh let not the lord be angry and i will
[1:11:11] speak per adventure there shall thirty
[1:11:13] be found there
[1:11:14] and he said i will not do it if i find
[1:11:16] thirty there
[1:11:18] and he said behold now i have taken upon
[1:11:20] me to speak unto the lord
[1:11:21] abraham is working with god
[1:11:25] to intercede for somebody else it wasn't
[1:11:28] a quick god could you help him
[1:11:29] you know brother ted said and yeah i'm
[1:11:31] willing to stay here another day
[1:11:34] he was back and forth with god laboring
[1:11:36] i mean could it be 30 i mean how
[1:11:40] he was working in the realms of
[1:11:42] intercession
[1:11:47] and he said behold now verse 31
[1:11:50] i've taken upon me to speak unto the
[1:11:52] lord per adventure there shall be 20
[1:11:54] found there and he said i will not
[1:11:55] destroy it for 20 sake
[1:11:57] he said oh let not the lord be angry and
[1:11:59] i will speak yet but this once per
[1:12:01] adventure 10 shall be found there
[1:12:03] and he said i will not destroy it for
[1:12:05] the tense sake
[1:12:07] and the lord went his way the lord cut
[1:12:10] off the conversation
[1:12:14] because he already knew in his mind what
[1:12:16] was going to happen
[1:12:17] abraham had played his role and now it
[1:12:19] was time for god to end the conversation
[1:12:24] the lord went his way and as soon as he
[1:12:25] had left communion with abraham and
[1:12:27] abraham returned into his place
[1:12:30] you realize when when
[1:12:33] haman in the book of esther when haman's
[1:12:36] plan
[1:12:36] come unfolded it was the bride amen it
[1:12:39] was the rise of the bride and the bride
[1:12:41] moving into position that
[1:12:42] that unfurled haman's plan
[1:12:45] but when the king discovered haman's
[1:12:47] plan amen
[1:12:49] he went out into the garden where did
[1:12:51] haman go for mercy
[1:12:54] amen not to the king haman threw himself
[1:12:58] down
[1:12:58] on the queen's bed amen and started
[1:13:01] asking for mercy
[1:13:02] of esther
[1:13:05] and before esther could say anything to
[1:13:07] the king the king come in and took care
[1:13:09] of business right then
[1:13:10] and because who knows what esther would
[1:13:12] have said but he come
[1:13:14] to esther not to the king because
[1:13:16] whenever there's time for judgment
[1:13:18] somebody's got to play the part of mercy
[1:13:20] but when god decrees that there's no
[1:13:22] longer time for mercy
[1:13:23] he takes matters into his own hand he
[1:13:25] doesn't ask the mercy part to do it for
[1:13:30] him
[1:13:33] god knows what he's doing and when he's
[1:13:36] going to do it he does it his way
[1:13:38] and god knows when it's time to say no
[1:13:40] more
[1:13:43] i'm shutting off the conversation you
[1:13:45] did your part you played your part
[1:13:47] and there's coming a time when the bride
[1:13:49] will have played her part
[1:13:50] she would have done what she's supposed
[1:13:51] to done she's held back the wrath
[1:13:53] until everyone amen had an opportunity
[1:13:56] that needed to have an opportunity
[1:13:58] and when that part is done amen he's
[1:14:01] going to stop the conversation and he's
[1:14:02] going to take her away
[1:14:05] because the scripture says he who now
[1:14:06] let us are holdeth back
[1:14:09] he who now let us brother ben said
[1:14:10] that's a holy ghost
[1:14:12] but where is the holy ghost it's in the
[1:14:15] bride
[1:14:16] he who now let us will let until he be
[1:14:18] taken out of the way when is he going to
[1:14:20] be taken out away the brother bam tells
[1:14:21] us at the rapture of the bride
[1:14:23] when she leaves here the holy ghost will
[1:14:25] be taken out of the way
[1:14:26] amen until that time amen we're here
[1:14:29] imploring for god to have mercy god
[1:14:32] i've got a lot down there i've got
[1:14:33] somebody over here that's on my heart
[1:14:35] i mean who do you think was on abraham's
[1:14:37] mind when he was wrestling with god
[1:14:40] he had somebody on his heart he had lot
[1:14:43] and lots family down there on his mind
[1:14:46] amen and he was imploring with god
[1:14:48] because of somebody that was dear to him
[1:14:53] can we do the same thing can we have the
[1:14:57] we're a royal seat of abraham you
[1:15:00] believe that
[1:15:01] then abraham set the example for us he's
[1:15:03] the father of our faith and this is how
[1:15:05] the father of faith acted can we act the
[1:15:07] same way
[1:15:10] let's go to acts 26
[1:15:20] acts 26 and verse 27.
[1:15:27] paul is in chains been arrested he's
[1:15:28] went to jerusalem and
[1:15:30] a great riot broke out over him being in
[1:15:32] the temple
[1:15:34] they've taken him away to save his life
[1:15:36] over to caesarea and
[1:15:38] felix is there and agrippa comes to see
[1:15:40] felix and they have an audience with
[1:15:43] with paul and paul begins to preach to
[1:15:45] them
[1:15:46] now remember we've mentioned this before
[1:15:49] but
[1:15:50] paul is in prison there's a great trial
[1:15:53] going on
[1:15:54] they've come up and they've they they've
[1:15:56] made accusations against him
[1:15:58] he's given answers to agrippa agrippa
[1:16:00] doesn't know what to do about this and
[1:16:02] he's not sure how to handle paul because
[1:16:04] paul's a bit
[1:16:05] of a problem because if he lets him go
[1:16:07] then he's got problems with the jews and
[1:16:10] but he knows he's not guilty
[1:16:13] paul is in prison he's in chains and
[1:16:16] he's bound
[1:16:18] but whenever he has an audience with
[1:16:21] felix and agrippa
[1:16:23] and candace the queen he doesn't ask for
[1:16:27] mercy he doesn't ask to get off on good
[1:16:30] behavior
[1:16:32] he doesn't ask them to let him go or
[1:16:34] deport him to antioch or
[1:16:36] he starts preaching the gospel every
[1:16:39] time
[1:16:39] because paul cares about souls not about
[1:16:43] his own neck
[1:16:44] he's not just he's not paul is not
[1:16:46] saving his life
[1:16:47] paul is giving his life for somebody
[1:16:49] else to be saved
[1:16:52] they would they would stone paul and
[1:16:54] paul would go right back at it amen they
[1:16:55] would
[1:16:56] there'd be a great riot amen trying to
[1:16:58] shut him down
[1:16:59] and he would keep preaching i mean he
[1:17:01] could have saved himself
[1:17:02] paul could have went away into the
[1:17:04] mountains years ago
[1:17:06] and just started writing letters and
[1:17:07] having messenger boys carry out his
[1:17:09] letters
[1:17:09] amen but that's not what he was called
[1:17:12] to do that's not what was in his heart
[1:17:13] his heart was amen to get the message
[1:17:16] out to get the gospel out
[1:17:18] no matter what it cost paul personally
[1:17:21] and he's in prison amen he never employs
[1:17:24] for
[1:17:24] implores for his freedom whenever he
[1:17:27] gets a chance to talk to him
[1:17:29] he talks the message he tries to win
[1:17:32] souls and here he is
[1:17:36] verse 27 king agrippa believeth thou the
[1:17:39] prophets
[1:17:40] i know that thou believest then agrippa
[1:17:42] said unto paul
[1:17:43] almost thou persuades me to be a
[1:17:46] christian
[1:17:47] he wasn't trying to get off on good
[1:17:50] behavior
[1:17:52] almost that persuades me to be a
[1:17:53] christian and paul said i would to god
[1:17:56] that not only thou
[1:17:57] but also all that hear me this day we're
[1:18:00] both
[1:18:00] almost and all together such as i am
[1:18:02] except these bonds
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:05] i wish you were a christian i wish i
[1:18:07] wish whatever was in my heart you had in
[1:18:09] your heart and i wish you were in the
[1:18:10] same condition i am
[1:18:12] except for these chains i wish you were
[1:18:15] better in a better spot than me
[1:18:17] i wish you had all the love in my heart
[1:18:19] and all the truth and revelation
[1:18:20] and you were free to roam around and he
[1:18:22] would be willing to stay there in
[1:18:24] chains to get that result
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:28] amen this is what god's calling us to
[1:18:31] friends this is a higher life to live
[1:18:33] than what we've lived before but this is
[1:18:36] the life of jesus christ
[1:18:40] let's go to second corinthians chapter
[1:18:42] 5.
[1:18:50] ii corinthians chapter 5 and verse 18
[1:18:58] and all things are of god who hath
[1:19:01] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:19:03] and has given to us
[1:19:05] the ministry of reconciliation to it
[1:19:07] that god was in christ reconciling the
[1:19:09] world unto himself not imputing their
[1:19:11] trespasses unto them
[1:19:13] and have committed unto us the word of
[1:19:15] reconciliation
[1:19:17] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:19:19] as though god did beseech you by
[1:19:21] us how did god beseech them first
[1:19:26] inside jesus christ right
[1:19:30] inside jesus christ let's go back to 19
[1:19:33] to wit that god was
[1:19:34] in christ reconciling the world unto
[1:19:37] himself
[1:19:39] but hath committed unto us the word of
[1:19:41] reconciliation
[1:19:44] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:19:45] as though god did beseech you
[1:19:47] by us now he did it in jesus christ but
[1:19:50] now he's doing it by us
[1:19:52] we pray you in christ's stead
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:57] we pray you i'm imploring you i'm
[1:19:59] speaking to you
[1:20:01] instead of christ in the place of christ
[1:20:03] in christ's dead
[1:20:04] now i am trying to give you the word of
[1:20:07] reconciliation god was in christ
[1:20:09] reconciling the world to himself
[1:20:10] but he's given us the word of
[1:20:11] reconciliation we're as ambassadors and
[1:20:14] god
[1:20:14] is now speaking to you by us and i
[1:20:17] implore you
[1:20:18] in christ's dead amen be ye reconciled
[1:20:21] to god
[1:20:23] what was the ministry be reconciled to
[1:20:26] god
[1:20:29] and paul recognized his position i'm
[1:20:32] standing in the place of christ
[1:20:35] god is doing it by us he's trying to
[1:20:37] reconcile you to himself
[1:20:39] that was his ministry amen
[1:20:42] let that be our ministry revelation
[1:20:46] five let's grab a couple more scriptures
[1:20:49] here revelations five
[1:20:52] revelation five
[1:20:58] and eight revelation 5 and 8.
[1:21:02] and when he had taken the book the four
[1:21:04] beasts and 4
[1:21:06] and 20 elders fell down before the lamb
[1:21:08] having every one of them harps and
[1:21:10] golden vials full of odors
[1:21:11] which are the prayers of the saints and
[1:21:13] they sung a new song saying thou art
[1:21:15] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:21:17] seals thereof
[1:21:17] for thou was slain and hast redeemed us
[1:21:20] to god by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:21:22] and tongue and people and nation
[1:21:24] and hast made us unto our god kings and
[1:21:26] priests
[1:21:27] and we shall reign on the earth
[1:21:30] thou hast made us we're going to reign
[1:21:32] on the earth but now you've already made
[1:21:34] us
[1:21:34] kings and priests brother benham said in
[1:21:38] the church age book
[1:21:40] it says he hath made us oh there are
[1:21:42] certain truths we need to emphasize this
[1:21:44] is one of them
[1:21:45] he he hath made us salvation is his
[1:21:47] doing salvation is of the lord all of
[1:21:49] grace he redeemed us for a purpose
[1:21:51] he bought us for a purpose we are kings
[1:21:53] spiritual kings
[1:21:55] oh we're going to be kings on the earth
[1:21:56] with him when he sits on his throne
[1:21:58] but now we are spiritual kings and reign
[1:22:00] over a spiritual kingdom
[1:22:05] skip down another paragraph he says
[1:22:07] right now we reign with christ having
[1:22:09] dominion
[1:22:10] over sin the world the flesh and the
[1:22:11] devil showing forth his praise and glory
[1:22:14] showing forth himself for it is christ
[1:22:17] in us
[1:22:17] willing and doing of his good pleasure
[1:22:20] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[1:22:22] heavenly places in christ
[1:22:24] so we are seated in christ and christ is
[1:22:26] seated in us
[1:22:29] he is in us the willing and doing of his
[1:22:31] good pleasure
[1:22:32] and made us priests yes priest unto him
[1:22:36] offering the spiritual praise of
[1:22:38] sanctified lips spending our lives as a
[1:22:41] sweet offering unto him
[1:22:42] worship worshiping him in spirit and in
[1:22:45] truth
[1:22:46] interceding and petitioning
[1:22:49] priests and kings in our god no wonder
[1:22:51] the world does not appeal to us
[1:22:53] and we are peculiar people zealous unto
[1:22:55] good works we have been recreated
[1:22:57] in him to be children like unto our
[1:22:59] father
[1:23:01] he is now in us
[1:23:04] he is in us willing and doing of good
[1:23:07] pleasure and he has made us priests now
[1:23:09] spiritual priests to offer praise
[1:23:12] sacrifice of praise
[1:23:13] sacrifice of our lives but also to
[1:23:16] intercede
[1:23:16] and petition so part of our priesthood
[1:23:20] now
[1:23:21] is intercession and petitioning
[1:23:23] interceding for others
[1:23:24] and petitioning the throne on behalf of
[1:23:27] others
[1:23:28] god would you forgive my brother god
[1:23:30] would you forgive my sister god would
[1:23:32] you change this circumstance god would
[1:23:34] you help us in this area
[1:23:36] we have a priesthood now we are a
[1:23:38] spiritual priest
[1:23:39] christ is in us finishing the work and
[1:23:42] we have been given a priesthood
[1:23:45] and we've been given the ability to
[1:23:47] intercede and petition
[1:23:50] let's not waste our opportunity
[1:23:55] let's not just rejoice in being a priest
[1:23:59] i'm a priest
[1:24:02] what's a priest do why are you a priest
[1:24:07] we're kings and priests but what does a
[1:24:09] priest do what's a priest supposed to do
[1:24:13] well the priest in the temple was always
[1:24:15] helping the people connect with god
[1:24:17] and always taking the person's sacrifice
[1:24:19] and helping them make a sacrifice so
[1:24:21] that they could be reconciled to god
[1:24:24] they had a ministry of reconciliation
[1:24:27] the priesthood had a ministry of
[1:24:28] reconciliation
[1:24:31] we're priests praise god i'm priests
[1:24:33] i'll put a badge i i'll put that another
[1:24:35] sash on my arm a priest i'm a king
[1:24:37] child of god but what does it mean what
[1:24:41] am i supposed to be doing as a priest
[1:24:44] what rights and privileges and
[1:24:46] responsibilities do i have
[1:24:49] i've got the right to go before the
[1:24:51] throne of god and take my brother along
[1:24:53] because i'm a priest and say god i want
[1:24:56] my brother and i to be reconciled
[1:24:58] together and i want us to be reconciled
[1:25:00] to you
[1:25:02] interceding and petitioning is part of
[1:25:04] the royal priesthood
[1:25:07] let's go to luke chapter 10
[1:25:11] and i want to finish with this parable
[1:25:15] luke chapter 10.
[1:25:20] i was talking to brother joriah one day
[1:25:22] and he told me something brother benham
[1:25:23] said about this
[1:25:25] the story of the good samaritan and i
[1:25:26] had never known brother brenham said it
[1:25:28] when he said it it just blessed me so
[1:25:30] much and i've been chewing on it since
[1:25:31] and
[1:25:32] i went back and i looked at it and it
[1:25:33] was it was really good
[1:25:36] amen not just because dry i said it
[1:25:38] because brother branham said it
[1:25:40] angeria said it amen
[1:25:46] but in fellowship we just feed off one
[1:25:47] another
[1:25:49] amen there's 1200 sermons brother madam
[1:25:51] said so much
[1:25:53] not one of us has it all but we need one
[1:25:56] another to feed each other amen
[1:25:58] and i was feeding off brother jeriah
[1:26:00] luke chapter 10 verse 25
[1:26:03] and behold a certain lawyer stood up and
[1:26:05] tempted him saying
[1:26:06] master what shall i do to inherit
[1:26:09] eternal life
[1:26:10] and he said to him what is written in
[1:26:11] the law how read us thou
[1:26:14] and he answered and said thou shalt love
[1:26:15] the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:26:17] with all thy soul with all my strength
[1:26:18] and with all my mind and thy neighbor as
[1:26:20] thyself.
[1:26:22] hey this guy got it this is what jesus
[1:26:26] when they ask jesus the greatest
[1:26:27] commandment this is the answer jesus
[1:26:29] gave
[1:26:30] and he said the second is like to it
[1:26:31] love thy neighbors thyself amen and now
[1:26:34] this is not jesus saying it amen this is
[1:26:36] one of the lawyers saying it
[1:26:38] he got it verse 28
[1:26:42] and he said unto him thou has answered
[1:26:44] right this do and thou shalt live
[1:26:46] so what can i do to have eternal life
[1:26:47] just keep just keep the
[1:26:50] word that all the law and the prophets
[1:26:51] is based on and keep the commandments
[1:26:53] where there's no greater commandments
[1:26:54] than this
[1:26:54] just do that amen
[1:26:59] but he willing to justify himself
[1:27:03] unto jesus
[1:27:06] and who is my neighbor so he asked jesus
[1:27:09] a question who's my neighbor
[1:27:11] and jesus answer said a certain man went
[1:27:14] down from
[1:27:14] jerusalem to jericho and fell among
[1:27:16] thieves which stripped him of his
[1:27:18] raiment and wounded him
[1:27:20] and departed leaving him half dead and
[1:27:23] by chance there came down a certain
[1:27:25] priest that way and
[1:27:26] when he saw him he passed by on the
[1:27:28] other side and likewise a levite when he
[1:27:31] was at the place came
[1:27:32] and looked on him and passed by on the
[1:27:33] other side but a certain samaritan as he
[1:27:36] journeyed came where he was and
[1:27:38] when he saw him he had compassion on him
[1:27:40] and he went
[1:27:41] to him and bound up his wounds and
[1:27:43] poured into oil and wine
[1:27:45] set him on his own beast and brought him
[1:27:46] to an inn and took care of him
[1:27:49] and on the morrow when he departed he
[1:27:50] took out two pence and
[1:27:52] gave them to the host and said unto him
[1:27:54] take care of him
[1:27:55] and whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[1:27:57] come again i will repay thee
[1:27:59] which now of these three thinketh thou
[1:28:02] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[1:28:03] the thieves
[1:28:04] and he said he that showed mercy on him
[1:28:07] then said jesus unto him
[1:28:08] go and do likewise which one was a
[1:28:11] neighbor
[1:28:13] the one who showed mercy who's my
[1:28:17] neighbor maybe the one who needs mercy
[1:28:18] shown to them
[1:28:21] here's what brother branham says this is
[1:28:22] very interesting in the message blind
[1:28:24] bartimaeus from 1954
[1:28:26] but this poor blind man sitting outside
[1:28:28] of the big wicked city
[1:28:30] he's speaking of um blind bartimaeus
[1:28:33] down in jericho thinking of this wicked
[1:28:35] city as far as i know still
[1:28:37] a wicked city in the bible it's
[1:28:39] represented as the roads to hell
[1:28:41] going to jericho jericho was cursed
[1:28:45] it's a rose to hell any come yet
[1:28:47] jerusalem sets on a hill jericho sits in
[1:28:49] the valley
[1:28:50] and the good samaritan found a man
[1:28:52] coming from jerusalem down to jericho
[1:28:54] when he fell among thieves think of it
[1:28:56] he was backslidden coming from heavenly
[1:28:59] to the cursed
[1:29:01] jericho is a cursed city jerusalem is a
[1:29:03] blessed city and he was on his road
[1:29:05] backsliding
[1:29:06] when he fell among thieves and robbers
[1:29:08] that stripped him and that's when you
[1:29:10] fall among thieves and robbers when you
[1:29:11] start backsliding away from god
[1:29:13] just expect the enemy to be along the
[1:29:16] road
[1:29:17] now all of a sudden the story changes
[1:29:21] this is somebody who's falling from
[1:29:24] jerusalem into jericho they're
[1:29:26] backsliding they're going away from the
[1:29:28] things of god
[1:29:29] they're moving away amen and they fell
[1:29:31] among thieves and
[1:29:32] robbers who stripped them and beat them
[1:29:35] and left them
[1:29:36] half dead brother ram goes on to say in
[1:29:39] the lamb and the dove
[1:29:40] 1957 you know i think these meetings are
[1:29:42] when we catch the sinner you know jesus
[1:29:44] found a man one time in a parable
[1:29:46] was on his road from jericho or from
[1:29:48] jerusalem to jericho
[1:29:49] it showed he was backsliding he was
[1:29:52] going from
[1:29:53] up high going down low he was
[1:29:55] backsliding
[1:29:56] and he met him on the road and the enemy
[1:29:58] had beaten him and robbed him and left
[1:30:00] him half
[1:30:00] dead that was physically alive
[1:30:04] spiritually dead the scripture says he's
[1:30:07] half dead
[1:30:08] brother branham said physically alive
[1:30:10] but spiritually a dead
[1:30:12] when jesus christ found me amen i was
[1:30:15] somewhere between heaven
[1:30:16] and hell i was on the road down going
[1:30:20] the wrong direction
[1:30:21] amen and i'd come into a laodicean
[1:30:23] condition amen where i was stripped
[1:30:25] naked
[1:30:26] i had nothing i'd fallen among thieves
[1:30:28] who stole me of my covering robbed me of
[1:30:30] the word
[1:30:31] rodney of the joy robbed me of the life
[1:30:33] through denominational systems and i was
[1:30:35] half dead physically alive but
[1:30:37] spiritually dead
[1:30:40] amen this is the condition amen the good
[1:30:43] samaritan was jesus christ and he found
[1:30:45] all of us in this condition
[1:30:49] and he brought us out of this condition
[1:30:51] he poured in the oil
[1:30:52] and he poured in the wine and he clothed
[1:30:55] him he bound him up
[1:30:56] and he took him into the inn
[1:31:00] brother brendan says the end is the
[1:31:01] church
[1:31:03] and he gave the innkeeper money to take
[1:31:05] care of him he brought him to the church
[1:31:07] and the church was supposed to
[1:31:08] bring him up jesus christ found him but
[1:31:10] the church was supposed to bring him up
[1:31:13] he said when i return i'll repay you
[1:31:14] because there's going to be a judgment
[1:31:16] of rewards
[1:31:18] i'll repay you
[1:31:22] it says robbed him left him half dead
[1:31:24] that was physically alive and
[1:31:26] spiritually dead
[1:31:27] the priests the levites and so forth
[1:31:29] passed him but the good samaritan as
[1:31:31] jesus taught it picked him up
[1:31:33] poured oil in and whined and taken him
[1:31:34] to the end now there's the place i want
[1:31:37] to get to
[1:31:38] get to you he taken him to the end and
[1:31:40] said to the caretaker
[1:31:42] take care of him give him a couple of
[1:31:44] pennies or whatever it was to pay his
[1:31:45] way and said
[1:31:46] now if he needs any more just go ahead
[1:31:48] and take care of him i'll make it right
[1:31:50] when i come
[1:31:53] amen the samaritan was half jew half
[1:31:57] gentile or one
[1:31:58] where the middle wall of partition's
[1:32:00] been taken down
[1:32:01] either jew or gentile and jesus christ
[1:32:04] demonstrated for this but when jesus
[1:32:06] christ found
[1:32:07] me how did jesus christ come to me he
[1:32:10] came in a body of flesh
[1:32:12] and somebody brought me the word what
[1:32:15] was it it was
[1:32:16] jesus christ in his earthly body the
[1:32:18] bride
[1:32:19] amen and that's how they ministered to
[1:32:21] me and poured in the oil
[1:32:22] and poured in the wine and brought me to
[1:32:25] the church
[1:32:27] because when he when he gets to the
[1:32:29] bottom of here in verse 37
[1:32:31] he said any and he showed mercy on him
[1:32:33] then said jesus unto him
[1:32:35] go and do likewise now
[1:32:40] jesus rescued you how did he rescue you
[1:32:43] amen he sent somebody along it was
[1:32:45] christ but he was using another vessel
[1:32:49] amen and he poured in the oil and wine
[1:32:51] and used his own beast to carry you to
[1:32:53] the end and there they took care of you
[1:32:56] and tell you
[1:32:56] you got strength back
[1:32:59] now you go and do likewise now
[1:33:03] he says let's go back to the parable and
[1:33:05] look at it
[1:33:06] let's go back
[1:33:11] let's go to verse 30 again and jesus
[1:33:12] answered he said a certain man went down
[1:33:14] from jerusalem to jericho and fell among
[1:33:16] thieves
[1:33:17] which stripped him of his raiment and
[1:33:18] wounded him and departed
[1:33:20] leaving him half dead and by chance
[1:33:23] there came down
[1:33:24] a certain priest that way the priest was
[1:33:28] backslidden too
[1:33:32] he was following the same path a
[1:33:34] backslidden priest
[1:33:36] can't save anybody he's moving from the
[1:33:39] heavenly from the word from truth
[1:33:41] and going down the road to hell amen
[1:33:43] that kind of priesthood couldn't do
[1:33:45] anything but it was the rejected
[1:33:47] samaritan the one that was the outcast
[1:33:49] who was pushed away
[1:33:51] that was the one who had a different
[1:33:53] kind of priesthood he was moving
[1:33:55] possibly the scripture doesn't say but
[1:33:57] possibly he was moving in a different
[1:33:59] direction
[1:34:02] we know the priest was going down the
[1:34:04] same way
[1:34:07] he couldn't help that man going that way
[1:34:12] but oh the levite come along and he was
[1:34:15] in the same condition going the wrong
[1:34:17] way
[1:34:18] but the samaritan he's the one who could
[1:34:22] help
[1:34:24] he had the oil in the wine
[1:34:27] before you can help you've got to have
[1:34:29] the oil in the wine
[1:34:33] he had the oil and wine he knew how to
[1:34:36] bind up the wounds
[1:34:37] and he knew where to take him
[1:34:41] praise god that's the role that we're
[1:34:44] supposed to be playing it's jesus christ
[1:34:47] in you and i the ministry of
[1:34:50] reconciliation
[1:34:51] he's doing it we are in christ's dead
[1:34:54] imploring people
[1:34:55] be reconciled to god amen he's working
[1:34:58] in
[1:34:58] and through the bride to finish his work
[1:35:00] to finish his work of reconciliation
[1:35:03] can we stand in that place
[1:35:09] second corinthians 1.
[1:35:16] second corinthians chapter 1
[1:35:23] verse 3.
[1:35:29] blessed be god even the father of our
[1:35:30] lord jesus christ the father of mercies
[1:35:32] and the god of all comfort
[1:35:34] who comforteth us in all our tribulation
[1:35:38] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:35:40] which are in trouble
[1:35:41] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[1:35:43] are comforted of god
[1:35:46] so why did god ever help you in the
[1:35:48] first place
[1:35:51] so you can help somebody else
[1:35:55] why did the samaritan rescue you and
[1:35:58] bind you up and take you to the end
[1:36:00] so that you could bind somebody else up
[1:36:02] and pour oil and wine in somebody else
[1:36:04] and take them to the end
[1:36:05] because jesus looked at that man and
[1:36:07] said go and do
[1:36:08] likewise it wasn't just for him to do
[1:36:11] it's for you and i to do it too
[1:36:15] god blessed be the god of all comfort
[1:36:17] who comforted us in all our tribulation
[1:36:20] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:36:22] which are in any trouble
[1:36:23] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[1:36:26] are comforted
[1:36:27] of of comforted of god
[1:36:31] let's look at luke chapter six and
[1:36:32] that's the last scripture i want to look
[1:36:34] at
[1:36:36] musicians if you can make your way on up
[1:36:42] luke chapter 6.
[1:36:45] i want to finish on this
[1:36:49] luke 6 and 37.
[1:36:55] judge not and you shall not be judged

[1:37:01] condemned
[1:37:02] forgive and ye shall be forgiven give
[1:37:04] and it shall be given unto you
[1:37:06] good measure pressed down and shaken
[1:37:08] together and running over
[1:37:10] shall men give unto your bosom for with
[1:37:12] the same measure that you meet with all
[1:37:14] it shall be measured to you again
[1:37:18] that's just not about money you realize
[1:37:22] that
[1:37:22] that's not about money let's go back and
[1:37:25] read it and erase money from your mind
[1:37:29] it says judge not and you shall not be
[1:37:32] judged
[1:37:33] remember the last statement is the same
[1:37:36] measure that you meet with all it shall
[1:37:38] be measured to you again
[1:37:40] so now let's go back and read it judge
[1:37:42] not you shall not be judged
[1:37:44] condemn not and you shall not be
[1:37:46] condemned forgive and you shall be
[1:37:48] forgiven
[1:37:49] give and it shall be given unto you good
[1:37:51] measure pressed down
[1:37:52] shaken together running over shall men
[1:37:55] give unto your bosom
[1:37:56] for with the same measure that you meet
[1:37:58] with all it shall be measured to you
[1:38:00] again
[1:38:04] if we stand in the seat of the scornful
[1:38:07] somebody will scorn us with whatever
[1:38:11] measure we meet it will be given back
[1:38:15] this is a
[1:38:16] law of god forgive and it'll be forgiven
[1:38:20] to you
[1:38:21] judge and you'll be judged condemn me
[1:38:22] you'll be condemned give and it'll be
[1:38:24] given back to you
[1:38:26] god is teaching us a principle if i want
[1:38:29] somebody to forgive
[1:38:30] me and overlook my faults then i've got
[1:38:31] to forgive somebody and overlook their
[1:38:33] faults
[1:38:34] if i want somebody to intercede for me
[1:38:36] then i've got to intercede for them
[1:38:37] if i want somebody to stand in the gap
[1:38:39] for me i've got to stand in the gap for
[1:38:40] them
[1:38:41] because whatever measure i meet out is
[1:38:43] what i get back
[1:38:44] and if i meet out an accuser of the
[1:38:46] brethren all i'm going to get back is an
[1:38:48] accuser of the brethren
[1:38:51] if i've got a critical nature critical
[1:38:54] spirit and i'm criticizing criticizing
[1:38:56] criticizing
[1:38:57] i ought not to be too offended when i
[1:38:59] get criticized back
[1:39:03] but if i can show mercy somebody show
[1:39:05] mercy on me if i can give forgiveness
[1:39:07] somebody get forgiveness from me
[1:39:08] if i can if i can cover a sin with love
[1:39:11] somebody can cover my sin with love
[1:39:14] if i can intercede for somebody somebody
[1:39:16] can intercede for me
[1:39:17] because there's never a time that we've
[1:39:19] got to a place we no longer need
[1:39:20] something we're always going to need
[1:39:22] something
[1:39:24] amen and sometimes we don't even know
[1:39:25] what we need but this person next to us
[1:39:28] may know what it is we need
[1:39:29] yesterday amen and
[1:39:32] sometimes i see what they need and they
[1:39:34] don't even realize what it is i see a
[1:39:36] complex that they don't see
[1:39:38] i see a need in their life that they
[1:39:39] don't realize they have and why can't i
[1:39:41] just
[1:39:41] intercede for that implore god and take
[1:39:43] him before the throne because they can
[1:39:45] see something in me that i can't see
[1:39:50] let's cover for one another amen let's
[1:39:52] not expose each other's sins let's cover
[1:39:54] each other's sins
[1:39:56] let's not let's not criticize amen let's
[1:40:00] hold each other up
[1:40:01] let's not point out the bad point out to
[1:40:03] good
[1:40:07] it doesn't mean that we put truth aside
[1:40:10] truth is truth
[1:40:11] wrong is wrong amen we've got both sides
[1:40:13] we've got to be straight on the word
[1:40:16] but just as soon as we're straight away
[1:40:18] that's absolutely wrong
[1:40:20] but i don't know why my brother did that
[1:40:21] if i knew why i would probably
[1:40:23] understand
[1:40:23] so i'm going to assume that there's a
[1:40:25] reason why and i'm going to ask god to
[1:40:27] fix the wrong
[1:40:29] wrong is wrong we'll always be wrong but
[1:40:31] can we have a heart of compassion
[1:40:33] i've done wrong before not even knowing
[1:40:35] i was doing wrong
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:37] i've done wrong before knowing i was
[1:40:39] doing wrong
[1:40:42] and i still needed somebody to correct
[1:40:43] me and love me
[1:40:47] there's times i knew i was wrong and
[1:40:49] what i needed was somebody to come and
[1:40:51] tell me i was wrong but love me enough
[1:40:52] to say but i'm sticking with you anyways
[1:40:58] but i love you and i'm telling you this
[1:40:59] because i love you not because i'm mad
[1:41:01] at you i love you and i want you to know
[1:41:02] and i'm willing to pray with you and
[1:41:04] stick stick stick through this with you
[1:41:08] and i haven't already told half the
[1:41:09] church
[1:41:12] i've only told you praise the lord
[1:41:15] amen oh if we could just act like that
[1:41:19] what kind of church can we have
[1:41:20] what kind of bride can this be i mean if
[1:41:22] we just root out all the works of the
[1:41:24] devil
[1:41:24] amen and we get him out of our midst and
[1:41:26] get all this selfishness and pride and
[1:41:28] arrogancy and envy
[1:41:30] amen and strife and get it out of what
[1:41:32] kind of manifestation and power would be
[1:41:34] in the bride
[1:41:34] if you shut off the works of the devil
[1:41:38] man that's why he's given us the word so
[1:41:40] we would know how we're supposed to act
[1:41:42] and when we're falling short we know
[1:41:43] exactly how to pray god you've got to
[1:41:45] help me come to this place
[1:41:48] i want to intercede for my brother not
[1:41:50] criticize him
[1:41:51] and if i see something wrong then i
[1:41:53] should be praying the most
[1:41:58] help us lord god is good let's stand
[1:42:09] praise god how many of you believe
[1:42:12] you're getting a body change
[1:42:16] then we've got to change if we're going
[1:42:19] to get a body change we've got to change
[1:42:21] because we're not where we're supposed
[1:42:22] to be
[1:42:23] we're not we've not yet arrived friends
[1:42:27] we've got to mature we've got to grow
