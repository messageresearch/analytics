TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. I'm so thankful that God's called me to be a calf of the stall. &gt;&gt; Not a wandering, aimless, needy, starving. Hey, listen. Remember remember uh Pharaoh's dream when Joseph was in captivity and Pharaoh had a dream that none of the wise men could tell him. And he saw seven fat kind cows. Seven fat and healthy. Fat was the word for healthy. And and and then coming up out of the river was was seven spindly Amen. weak. Amen. Uh uh uh uh uh emaciated cattle. And the seven emaciated cattle ate the fat cattle. And he he wanted an interpretation for the dream and didn't have it. But but then Joseph come along and Joseph said, "This is the interpretation. You're going to have seven good years of harvest where you got good food and have plenty." That's what the seven fat kind represented. But then you're going to have seven years of famine. And the seven years of famine are going to eat up the seven good years because all those skinny cows ate the fat cows. &gt;&gt; And after they ate the fat cows, they were just as skinny as ever. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It didn't help them any &gt;&gt; and everything would be lost. But what was his advice? His advice was store up the grain in the good years. Amen. To sustain you through the bad years. Amen. That's what God told Brother Brandham to do. Store up these vegetables. You're going to need it in the future. Amen. Our Joseph is Christ. Amen. And he's the one who controls the grain. And now in that day when you go to get grain, you had to go to Joseph. And Joseph is Christ. And Joseph is sitting on the grainery. And he's GOT ALL THE GRAIN. AMEN. OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES, ALL THE ORIGINAL teaching of the seven thunders. AND HE'S READY TO DISH IT OUT TO WHOEVER will come to him to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember his brethren tried to come and buy it. AMEN. HE WOULD SELL IT TO EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT EVERY TIME HIS BRETHREN TRIED TO BUY IT, HE PUT THEIR MONEY BACK in their sack. HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. THIS IS FREE FOR YOU." And then he said, "YOU COME DOWN TO GOAN. I'M GOING TO FEED YOU. I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN YOU. I'M GOING TO keep you healthy." OH, PRAISE GOD. JOSEPH HAS BROUGHT US INTO GO AND HE HAS THE STOREHOUSE and he's sustaining us. He's keeping us. He's feeding us out of the grainery. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just eat &gt;&gt; and live, my friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eat and have life and strength and vitality and be all that we're supposed to be by eating the message. All our efforts are going to fail. All of our attempts, all of our trying, it'll come to not. But if we just keep eating the word, the word will produce its own life. It'll bring it'll bring life out of the seed that's in the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just keep eating, receiving, and it'll become all it was meant to be.
