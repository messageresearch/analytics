[7:52] to thank all those who came out
[7:54] yesterday for the work day
[7:55] i got a couple pictures i'd like to show
[7:57] we had quite a crew show up and the
[7:59] trustees had worked together to organize
[8:02] a workday to get a lot of things done
[8:03] and
[8:04] and there was a lot of people and they
[8:05] got a lot of things done
[8:07] and so we thank god for that here's a
[8:09] group ceiling
[8:11] cracks in the parking lot you see
[8:13] brother moses down there
[8:14] digging it out and painting doors
[8:19] painting doors you know cleaning gutters
[8:24] screwing screws on the roof
[8:27] dryer supervising something looking up
[8:31] in a hole
[8:32] picking up sticks pressure washing
[8:35] outside
[8:36] and so there was a lot of things i mean
[8:38] a lot of things got done in a very short
[8:40] amount of time
[8:40] so we appreciate everybody who came out
[8:42] we had a good group of brothers the
[8:44] trustees did a good job organizing it
[8:47] several of the trustees wives put
[8:48] together a
[8:49] lunch afterwards there's a good group of
[8:52] men there
[8:54] working and here's another group and i
[8:56] just want to say thank you and i think
[8:57] as a church we should thank them for
[8:59] what they've done for all of us
[9:05] and then it's nice to see
[9:08] i mean even though it's physical work
[9:10] it's carnal
[9:11] but still we come together because we've
[9:13] got a vested interest together
[9:15] amen to have a place where we can
[9:17] worship god a place where we can
[9:18] fellowship together
[9:20] around the things of god and i
[9:21] appreciate those who sacrifice for the
[9:23] rest of the body
[9:24] may god bless you and thank you for that
[9:27] man let's all stand now
[9:29] and let's go to the word thank you
[9:30] musicians
[9:32] ephesians chapter 2. let's start there
[9:36] i want to continue on with the the same
[9:38] subject we were talking about wednesday
[9:40] resurrected and raptured to be
[9:43] resurrected
[9:44] and raptured and then i didn't get
[9:47] into my subject like i thought that i
[9:49] would and that's fine by me
[9:51] i'm perfectly happy that way when god
[9:53] takes over and
[9:54] the anointing moves in a different
[9:56] direction i'm very very grateful for
[9:58] that that's what we pray for amen that's
[9:59] what we want
[10:00] but i feel comfortable coming back to
[10:02] this subject and going on
[10:04] and we'll just see how far we get this
[10:05] time amen but
[10:07] but god be praised we want him to take
[10:10] control
[10:11] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1
[10:14] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[10:17] in trespasses
[10:18] and sins wherein in time past you walked
[10:20] according to the course of this world
[10:22] according to the prince of the power of
[10:24] the air the prince the spirit that now
[10:26] worketh in the children of disobedience
[10:30] among whom also we all had our
[10:31] conversation in times past
[10:33] and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[10:36] desire of the flesh
[10:37] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[10:39] children of wrath even as others
[10:42] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[10:44] great love wherewith he loved us
[10:46] even when we were dead in sins and quick
[10:48] and dead and sins hath quickened us
[10:50] together with christ
[10:51] for by grace you are saved and hath
[10:54] raised us up together and made us sit
[10:56] together in heavenly places
[10:58] in christ jesus that in the ages to come
[11:01] he might show the exceeding
[11:03] riches of his grace and his kindness
[11:05] towards us
[11:06] through christ jesus for by grace are
[11:08] you saved through faith and that not of
[11:10] yourselves
[11:11] it is the gift of god not of works lest
[11:14] any man should boast for we are his
[11:16] workmanship
[11:17] created in christ jesus unto good works
[11:19] which god hath before
[11:21] ordained that we should walk in them
[11:24] amen let's bow our heads and pray lord
[11:27] jesus we thank
[11:28] you for yet another opportunity to come
[11:30] and hear your word preached
[11:32] god we know that this is a method by
[11:34] which you've chosen to save souls
[11:36] this is the method by which you've
[11:38] chosen to speak to your children lord
[11:40] one of the methods
[11:41] and god would just ask that you would
[11:43] take complete control
[11:44] that you would move the man to the side
[11:46] lord and that you would come and the
[11:48] power of your holy spirit and that you
[11:49] would minister through a gift
[11:51] you've placed into a clay vessel and god
[11:54] that you would break the bread for us
[11:55] afresh this morning and that
[11:57] we would have our eyes open to see you
[11:59] as you are
[12:00] gone take preeminence over everything
[12:02] that'll be said lord
[12:04] lord speak through our lips and hear
[12:06] through our ears lord that we might
[12:07] receive
[12:08] truth the truth that you want for us and
[12:10] may that truth change us
[12:12] from glory unto glory we love you and we
[12:15] ask for your blessings in jesus christ's
[12:16] name we pray
[12:18] amen you can have your seats
[12:22] i'm going to read the same quote i've
[12:24] read wednesday
[12:27] and then see how far we get i think i've
[12:29] read it wednesday and last sunday
[12:31] and we'll see if we can move further
[12:34] by the grace of god it is in the message
[12:37] it is the rising of the sun
[12:39] it said waving of the sheaf what was the
[12:41] sheaf the first one that come to mature
[12:43] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[12:46] that proved it was a sheaf
[12:47] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[12:49] talking about it was waved over the
[12:51] people and the
[12:52] first time there will come forth for the
[12:53] bright age for a resurrection
[12:55] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[12:58] message that the full maturity of the
[13:00] word has turned back again
[13:01] in its full power and being waved over
[13:04] the people by the same signs and wonders
[13:06] that he did back there
[13:08] because i live ye live also speaking to
[13:10] his wife
[13:11] because i live ye live also what a
[13:14] resurrection that was
[13:16] and what a resurrection this is to be
[13:18] quickened from the dead
[13:20] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[13:22] god's quickening power
[13:24] amen so so now
[13:28] when we there's coming forth brother
[13:31] bram said in
[13:32] his time he was speaking there in 1965
[13:34] there's coming forth for the bride age
[13:36] for a resurrection out of dark
[13:38] denominationalism so
[13:40] he's speaking of a resurrection amen
[13:43] a resurrection out of dead
[13:45] denominationalism because
[13:47] at this point denominationalism had died
[13:50] amen
[13:51] it had brought death and had run its
[13:52] full cycle of death
[13:54] and now brother branham is standing here
[13:55] at the end of the laodicean church age
[13:58] and saying
[13:59] and now he's saying now this is a
[14:02] resurrection
[14:03] out of dark denominationalism and
[14:06] and now when he when he come to this
[14:08] resurrection in
[14:10] the first resurrection when jesus christ
[14:12] raised from the dead
[14:13] amen he came back amen as a pillar of
[14:16] fire on the day of pentecost
[14:17] and he came back to confirm the word and
[14:20] confirm the promise
[14:21] amen and the disciples are able to pick
[14:23] it up and say this is joel this is that
[14:25] this is that and he comes forth to prove
[14:27] the word or to confirm the word or to
[14:29] manifest the word
[14:31] and so in that resurrection he come
[14:33] forth in the manifestation of the word
[14:36] and in this one he says for the bride
[14:39] age for a resurrection out of dark
[14:40] denominationalism will be a message
[14:42] that the full maturity of the word has
[14:44] turned back again
[14:46] in its full power and being waved over
[14:48] the people
[14:49] it says because i live ye live also and
[14:52] so now we see
[14:53] that like we talked about last time now
[14:55] the word amen has been brought back into
[14:57] full effect
[14:58] now the word has been brought back into
[15:00] the full revelation of the word
[15:02] now the word is living amen the whole
[15:05] book is made alive
[15:06] by the revelation of the word amen it
[15:09] was
[15:09] it was darkened amen by creeds and
[15:12] dogmas and ideas of man
[15:14] amen through through all kinds of
[15:16] churches and denominationalism
[15:18] had darkened the word and the word had
[15:20] went into obscurity amen and it laid
[15:22] dormant through the dark ages as if as
[15:25] if it was lost as if it was dead
[15:27] amen but through luther luther brother
[15:29] said you see just a little sprig start
[15:31] to come out of the ground
[15:32] amen and it grew through through wesley
[15:34] through the pentecostal age
[15:36] amen to come back to seed again come
[15:39] back to the full measure of
[15:40] the word amen and when when he says that
[15:44] when we come back to the full measure of
[15:46] the word
[15:47] now he says because i live ye live also
[15:50] amen when when jesus christ resurrected
[15:52] and lived
[15:53] amen he was telling his disciples you'll
[15:55] know i'll come to you
[15:56] i'll be the comforter and i'll come to
[15:58] you and because i live ye live also
[16:01] and in this day because that word lives
[16:03] i live
[16:04] also and so for me
[16:07] what i want to see amen more than
[16:10] anything what gives me courage what what
[16:12] places
[16:12] me is to see the word live when i see
[16:15] the word
[16:16] live amen i live also when the
[16:19] when the when it comes from obscurity
[16:22] and darkness
[16:23] and shadow and moves into the fullness
[16:25] of its light
[16:26] amen when it comes to light and comes to
[16:28] life i come to light
[16:29] and i come to life because whatever that
[16:31] word is i am too
[16:35] amen brother bam says in the message
[16:38] god's provided place of worship
[16:40] now notice when this great moving power
[16:42] of god
[16:43] comes into a son of god it quickens him
[16:46] the spirit of life enters into him then
[16:48] what does it do it seats them in
[16:50] heavenly places right now
[16:52] not they will be we are now now we've
[16:55] already
[16:56] resurrected
[16:59] we've already resurrected the question
[17:02] is have you resurrected
[17:04] because the title is uh resurrected and
[17:07] raptured
[17:08] to be resurrected and raptured and we'll
[17:11] just cut to the chase
[17:12] if we can't in this day come to a
[17:14] resurrection and a rapture
[17:16] amen there's no point sitting on our
[17:17] heels waiting for something to happen
[17:19] amen the something that will happen is
[17:21] already happening
[17:23] it's already testified of it in our soul
[17:26] amen something's changed something's
[17:28] quickened to life
[17:29] proving that there's going to come
[17:30] another change
[17:33] praise be to god so to me it's important
[17:36] to catch what's going on now
[17:38] not to constantly be looking for what's
[17:40] going to happen amen because what's
[17:42] going to happen is testified by what has
[17:44] happened
[17:45] and what has happened is testifying to
[17:47] what will happen amen so
[17:48] we can get our focus on what god did in
[17:51] the past or what will happen in the
[17:53] future
[17:53] and miss what he's doing right now and
[17:56] if we miss what he's doing right now
[17:58] we're missing the very mechanism that
[18:00] will get us to where he needs us to be
[18:02] and where we want to be so we can
[18:05] constantly be looking like i want to go
[18:07] there i can't wait till my items change
[18:09] i can't wait to make it to the
[18:10] millennium and i'm just sitting here
[18:11] waiting waiting waiting waiting
[18:13] and if we're sitting in that state we're
[18:15] missing the very method by which he's
[18:17] using to get us there
[18:20] always waiting we'll never arrive with
[18:23] that attitude
[18:25] that's why the devil will constantly
[18:27] project out and project out and project
[18:29] down
[18:30] and get get us blind to what's going on
[18:33] right in front of us what's all around
[18:35] us what's happening this very moment in
[18:37] time
[18:37] in the believers because if it can get
[18:39] us blind to this that's
[18:41] this thing that's happening now this
[18:43] word that's bringing a life to the
[18:45] people to quicken the life inside them
[18:47] that will bring them to all of those
[18:50] things
[18:51] but if the devil can get us to focus
[18:53] there our focus there
[18:55] and miss what's happening here he he
[18:57] knows
[18:58] that if we don't catch what's happening
[19:00] now and we don't move
[19:02] move with the spirit now and move where
[19:04] god's moving now
[19:05] we will never make it to the thing we're
[19:07] focusing on
[19:09] and it'll constantly be kicking the can
[19:11] down the road and kicking the can down
[19:12] the road
[19:13] it'll always be the carrot on the stick
[19:17] i'm always just the donkey's just
[19:19] walking to get to the carrot and look
[19:21] something's still there
[19:23] it's still there he's never arrived
[19:30] i say how do i know
[19:33] how do i know that my atoms are going to
[19:35] change
[19:37] because i've already resurrected because
[19:40] the rapture
[19:41] started with a shout and i heard the
[19:43] shout and it moved me into a different
[19:45] condition it raptured me out of dead
[19:47] denominationalism it raptured me out of
[19:49] laodicea it brought me into the bright
[19:51] age
[19:51] it quickened something inside of me to
[19:53] life that's how i know for sure
[19:55] that my atoms are going to change i'm
[19:56] not aimlessly following a stick with a
[19:59] string
[19:59] and a carrot and some promise before and
[20:01] just aimlessly moving around
[20:03] hoping someday to get it i will get it
[20:05] amen i've already eaten the carrot
[20:07] spiritually
[20:09] i've already tasted amen that the lord
[20:11] is good i already know
[20:12] and then i've already experienced it and
[20:14] i'm going to experience it
[20:20] see the prophet of god told us that that
[20:23] the biggest trouble he sees in the
[20:25] church sometimes is fear
[20:28] and and he says some of these things
[20:30] come to take the scare away
[20:32] because there's so much scare of i'm not
[20:35] really a child of god i'm not going to
[20:36] make it i'll be left behind and
[20:39] i'm not going to be good enough and all
[20:41] of these all of these silly things
[20:44] that have nothing to do with it amen
[20:48] when we really what brother branham has
[20:50] done for us
[20:51] what god has done for us through the
[20:53] ministry of brother banham what god has
[20:55] done for us
[20:56] is he's taken the mystery away from the
[20:58] new birth
[20:59] so we can actually understand what our
[21:01] new birth actually is
[21:04] let's just keep reading here in the
[21:07] easter seal 1965
[21:09] are we if we are ordained on that ground
[21:12] if we are ordained to be
[21:14] on that ground like the eagle walking in
[21:16] the chicken's nest if you're ordained on
[21:17] that ground
[21:18] the holy spirit is here to find you
[21:21] who finds who
[21:24] the holy ghost is here to find you
[21:27] if you were ordained before the
[21:29] foundation of the world the holy ghost
[21:31] is here to find you
[21:32] amen you can't be lost you can no more
[21:34] be lost and god can be lost
[21:36] if you're carrying within your soul a
[21:37] portion of god an attribute of god
[21:39] a gene of god and part of the life of
[21:42] god part of the word of god and
[21:43] to me i don't care what terminology you
[21:46] attach to it it's all the same thing
[21:49] it is part of god it is the life of god
[21:51] it is
[21:52] it is the word of god it is the light of
[21:54] god it is god
[21:57] and if they're carrying that around in
[21:59] your soul how can you be lost
[22:00] but god is here the holy ghost is here
[22:03] seeking you out
[22:04] and we'll find you amen there's no
[22:06] there's no misses amen
[22:08] there's no almost with god it's a sure
[22:11] thing because it was short before the
[22:12] foundation the world he's seeking you
[22:14] out and we'll find you
[22:19] so the holy spirit is here to find you
[22:22] and when it finds you you recognize its
[22:25] call
[22:27] oh praise god
[22:30] it wasn't my efforts in finding
[22:32] something
[22:34] that brought the holy ghost to me
[22:37] but the holy ghost came to me and found
[22:39] me and when it found
[22:41] me i recognized its call
[22:44] [Music]
[22:46] you see it takes it it takes the
[22:49] the all the pressure and all the scare
[22:52] away
[22:53] because we're responding to his call
[22:57] we're responding all that the father has
[22:59] given me shall come to me
[23:01] all that the father will draw amen it's
[23:04] not
[23:04] that we were trying to draw the father
[23:06] the father was drawing us
[23:09] it wasn't that we were trying to make
[23:11] something happen
[23:12] god was making something happen and see
[23:15] the
[23:16] the gospel can get preached in such a
[23:17] way amen that we're
[23:20] constantly feeling like i haven't put
[23:22] forth enough effort yet
[23:23] i haven't tried hard enough yet i
[23:25] haven't yet found what i'm supposed to
[23:27] find
[23:27] and not realizing that the thing that
[23:29] you're supposed to find is the thing
[23:31] that's supposed to find you
[23:33] and when it finds you a minute quicken
[23:35] something inside so you recognize what
[23:37] it is that just found you
[23:40] amen
[23:44] and when it finds you you recognize this
[23:46] call you know the hour you're living
[23:48] you know that these things are supposed
[23:50] to happen quickly
[23:52] you're raptured up to meet it and now
[23:54] you're sitting in heavenly places in
[23:56] christ jesus
[23:58] oh what a promise what a heavenly father
[24:00] who would give us these things
[24:03] so based on that quote based on what the
[24:06] prophet of god has said
[24:08] i i'm raptured
[24:13] there's a part of me that's already
[24:15] raptured
[24:17] seated in heavenly places in christ
[24:19] jesus you know when
[24:20] when that holy ghost finds you when it
[24:22] finds you you recognize his call
[24:24] you know the hour you're living you know
[24:26] these things are supposed to happen
[24:27] quickly you're raptured up to meet it
[24:30] praise be to god i think that gives us
[24:33] permission to stop kicking the can down
[24:35] the road
[24:38] and start living in the benefits that's
[24:40] been given to us
[24:42] in the message it is the rising of the
[24:43] sun from 1965
[24:45] and now see now you are already
[24:47] resurrected when god raised
[24:49] up when god raised him up he raised you
[24:52] the son is just now
[24:53] on you and now you're growing into a
[24:55] blossom life like he was
[24:57] to be resurrected completely in the last
[25:00] day
[25:01] your potentials you have now why do you
[25:03] you're
[25:04] why do you know your soul changed didn't
[25:07] it
[25:08] your body come obedience to it didn't it
[25:10] in obedience to what
[25:12] what a church the word which is the life
[25:17] i'm going to repeat that again the word
[25:20] which is the life
[25:24] the word which is the life
[25:28] then you are now resurrected from the
[25:31] dead
[25:32] i'll take that as true for me you are
[25:35] now
[25:36] resurrected from the dead you heard the
[25:38] call you recognized and messed with your
[25:39] hour you
[25:40] quickly you were raptured up to meet it
[25:42] amen i have been resurrected and
[25:44] raptured amen
[25:48] amen you are now resurrected from the
[25:50] dead it is easter with jesus and i
[25:53] it's easter with you and jesus it's
[25:55] easter with you i and jesus
[25:57] jesus you and i we are all resurrected
[26:00] together
[26:02] amen now brother ben says in the
[26:05] uh works his faith expressed 1965
[26:08] he said i'm two separate people i'm body
[26:10] soul and spirit
[26:11] three separate people but i'm only one
[26:14] makes me as a being
[26:16] and questions and answers in 1964 he
[26:18] says see you're a dual person three
[26:20] people in one
[26:21] soul body and spirit 1965 and things
[26:25] that are to be
[26:26] he says there's three people of you the
[26:29] outside is the body you got five senses
[26:31] you that you contact your earthly home
[26:33] with that the inside is a spirit there's
[26:35] five senses there love conscious and so
[26:37] forth
[26:38] you contact but the inside of that is
[26:40] the soul
[26:41] and the reason i i want to bring this up
[26:44] and mention this is brother ben very
[26:45] clearly says
[26:46] he says you're three people but you're
[26:49] one
[26:51] he says there are three people in one
[26:54] there's three people of you he says this
[26:57] and if you notice
[26:58] almost all the quotes all but one quote
[27:00] that i'm going to use today all comes
[27:01] from 1964 and 1965
[27:04] because after the opening of the seals
[27:05] brother branham was honing down
[27:07] amen on this content he was honing down
[27:09] on this revelation and his understanding
[27:12] because he was taking the mystery away
[27:14] from who we are
[27:16] he was really peeling back the mystery
[27:18] of who we are amen
[27:21] because down through the denominational
[27:23] ages amen
[27:24] we thought that we were people who
[27:28] who were sympathetic to a line of
[27:30] preaching and had
[27:31] agreed with that line of preaching and
[27:33] therefore by agreeing with that line of
[27:35] preaching we were now saved and born
[27:37] again
[27:39] that was the denominational
[27:40] understanding that's why the
[27:42] denominations today
[27:43] amen will bang on doors and do rallies
[27:45] and do any kind of trick or mechanism to
[27:47] get people into a church to sit down
[27:50] amen and listen because the whole goal
[27:52] is to get the people there
[27:54] to mentally accept and acknowledge
[27:56] what's being preached
[27:57] and if they mentally accept and
[27:59] acknowledge a historical fact
[28:01] that there was a man named jesus which
[28:03] was god made in flesh who came and died
[28:05] for them if they can mentally
[28:06] accept that and agree with that and say
[28:09] with their mouth that i believe that's
[28:10] true for me
[28:11] then now they're saved and can be born
[28:13] again and are born again believers
[28:17] and that's the darkness of
[28:19] denominationalism because the darkness
[28:21] and denominationalism takes the whole
[28:23] plan of god
[28:24] amen and rested on your ability to
[28:26] mentally accept something
[28:29] or an understanding amen and now brother
[28:31] brahms coming at the end of the ministry
[28:33] and he's peeling back
[28:34] the mystery taking the cloak off of that
[28:37] amen
[28:38] because that's why that's why you find
[28:40] sometimes in denominationalism there's
[28:42] almost a desire to beg
[28:44] somebody just agree with what i'm
[28:45] telling you
[28:47] just just repeat after me just say and
[28:50] somehow
[28:51] there's an actual belief that if i can
[28:53] get you to repeat words out of your
[28:55] mouth
[28:55] that you're now saved and born again
[28:57] you're a new creature in christ jesus
[28:59] and how do words coming out of a mouth
[29:02] amen
[29:02] obligate god to fill you with the spirit
[29:07] i understand what i'm saying or
[29:10] preaching a historical fact
[29:11] that jesus came and died on calvary and
[29:13] if you accept that
[29:14] you can be saved and be born again hey
[29:16] that's part of the word that's part of
[29:18] that's
[29:19] absolutely the foundation for our
[29:21] redemption
[29:23] but just being able to recognize yes
[29:26] that that happened
[29:27] and i believe it's true and he died for
[29:29] the sins of the world absolutely that's
[29:31] the truth
[29:31] amen that that's not the mystery
[29:34] of redemption that's not the mystery of
[29:37] being born again becoming a new creature
[29:39] brother branham takes the mask off of
[29:42] that
[29:42] and he says it wasn't what you agreed
[29:44] with in a preacher it wasn't what you
[29:46] said
[29:47] at a campaign it wasn't an action you
[29:49] took or a pledge you made
[29:50] amen really the only way that you can
[29:53] ever be born again
[29:54] amen is there had to be a seed gene of
[29:57] god in your soul
[29:58] from before the foundation of the world
[30:00] it was part of god and god came seeking
[30:02] it out
[30:03] amen and the way that god was going to
[30:04] quicken that is there was a seed word
[30:07] predestinated for a certain age so god
[30:10] was going to have a revealed word
[30:11] preached in a certain age and when these
[30:13] two came together
[30:14] it was going to unlock the faith that
[30:17] was already laying in your heart
[30:18] and when that unlocked you were able to
[30:20] say that ain't nothing
[30:22] but the truth i believe that's the truth
[30:24] amen not by mental not
[30:26] by verbal amen but by a seed coming to
[30:29] life
[30:29] in the soul and that is the mystery of
[30:31] the new birth
[30:34] and what brother branham did what god
[30:36] did through brother adam is peeled away
[30:38] the mystery of denominationalism
[30:41] and that's why you can see that's why in
[30:44] the denominationalism
[30:45] they'll just they'll beg their children
[30:48] just come to church with me just come to
[30:50] church with me
[30:52] if i can just get them to hear and agree
[30:54] with it
[30:56] listen if there's a seed there the holy
[30:59] ghost will find it
[31:02] the holy ghost will find it what we need
[31:04] to do is not beg and not plead
[31:06] but just let the light shine to share
[31:08] the word just have
[31:09] faith and believe that not one will miss
[31:13] it
[31:14] that he won't lose one amen that ev that
[31:17] the holy ghost
[31:18] will find every predestinated seed
[31:22] amen we almost
[31:26] scare people into receiving christ
[31:30] but what did they receive by the scare
[31:34] what did they receive they received an
[31:36] idea they received a concept
[31:40] but how can you receive christ without
[31:42] receiving the word
[31:43] amen they are one and the same
[31:47] amen so too many times there's a
[31:50] temptation to separate the word
[31:52] and separate the spirit but in this
[31:55] quote we read as the rising of the sun
[31:58] he says your body came in obedience to
[32:00] it didn't it and obedience to what the
[32:02] church
[32:02] the word which is the life
[32:05] because jesus said the words i speak
[32:08] unto you they are
[32:08] spirit and they are life
[32:12] there's too much of a temptation to
[32:14] separate the word and the spirit
[32:16] or say you know if you if
[32:19] if it just this way we just got to get
[32:22] you in contact with the spirit
[32:24] that's all if you just get in contact
[32:25] with the spirit amen then the spirit
[32:27] will lead and guide you into all truth
[32:28] and then you'll find the word
[32:31] but that's not the way brother bannon
[32:32] preached it in 1965
[32:35] at the end of his ministry that's not
[32:37] the way he preached it he said the word
[32:39] comes to you and unlocks the mystery
[32:42] you're born again amen not of
[32:44] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[32:45] the word of god
[32:46] that you're washed by the water of the
[32:48] word amen that without the word
[32:50] amen the word and the spirit go together
[32:52] amen when you receive the word you
[32:54] receive the spirit
[32:55] when you reject the word you reject the
[32:56] spirit
[32:59] and so so there's a pentecostalism that
[33:02] says if i can just get you in contact
[33:03] with the spirit amen that spirit will
[33:05] lead you and guide you all the truth
[33:06] that's absolutely right
[33:08] the spirit will lead and guide you on
[33:09] all truth amen but it takes the truth
[33:12] coming to you
[33:12] to quicken that seed the life amen to
[33:15] connect with the spirit and the spirit
[33:16] will continue
[33:17] to lead and guide you into all truths
[33:22] amen we can't separate the spirit in the
[33:26] word
[33:30] brother man now he's telling us there's
[33:32] three people of you
[33:36] you're three people in one
[33:39] now when we start preaching like this
[33:42] and start talking about this
[33:44] really we're just using terms
[33:47] and those terms are so um
[33:50] incapable of accurately
[33:53] explaining the full truths we'll say it
[33:56] like this the revelation
[33:58] the the the revelation of the word is
[34:01] pure
[34:03] or i should say it like this the the the
[34:06] word is pure
[34:07] the word is god and the word is pure
[34:11] and the best way for me to understand a
[34:15] pure god
[34:16] is by divine revelation because divine
[34:19] revelation is pure
[34:22] but god wants his word preached and he
[34:25] wanted it written in book form
[34:27] and so now the purity has to
[34:31] be diminished i don't mean that
[34:34] sacrilegious in any way
[34:35] but whenever you take this perfect this
[34:37] pristine
[34:38] this crystal clear perfect word of god
[34:41] and you bring it down into any form of
[34:43] human language
[34:44] you have just lowered it from that
[34:46] pristine perfect state because human
[34:48] language isn't perfect
[34:49] [Applause]
[34:51] it's flawed and our understanding of it
[34:53] is flawed and so now it's come
[34:55] down amen into a mechanism god's going
[34:58] to use
[34:58] to promote his word by by the written
[35:00] word and the spoken word
[35:02] and preaching of the word amen but the
[35:04] only way to get
[35:05] back to the pure is when through the
[35:07] mechanism
[35:08] of human language god quickens something
[35:11] inside
[35:11] amen and brings a divine revelation from
[35:14] the father
[35:14] it connects you back to the higher form
[35:17] which is god himself
[35:20] does that make sense so when we start
[35:22] preaching we start using terms even
[35:24] brother bam starts using terms
[35:25] brother ben will flip-flop his terms
[35:28] he'll say it one way amen and if you
[35:31] lock in on it when he flips
[35:33] and says and uses other terminology or
[35:36] uses a
[35:37] or phrases it exactly the opposite it
[35:39] puts us in a situation where when we
[35:41] bind ourselves by human language
[35:43] we now must make a choice between a or b
[35:47] he said it this way and then he said it
[35:49] this way i must make a choice between a
[35:51] and b and it is not a choice between a
[35:54] and b
[35:54] he's just trying to use limited language
[35:57] a man with a seventh grade education
[35:59] born in kentucky amen fluent in
[36:01] hillbilly
[36:04] trying to express what he's seeing and
[36:07] what he's seeing is
[36:08] more than what he's capable of saying
[36:11] amen and so the terminology will flip
[36:14] and he'll use this term and he'll use
[36:16] that term
[36:16] he'll explain it this way one time and
[36:18] explain it this way another time
[36:20] amen the bible does the same thing when
[36:22] the bible refers to a seed
[36:24] amen sometimes amen the seed
[36:27] is you and sometimes the seed is the
[36:30] word that's being preached
[36:33] right same term but if you fixate on one
[36:37] and exclusive to the other
[36:39] amen you've missed the point the point
[36:41] is not the definition of the term
[36:42] the point is the revelation that's
[36:44] trying to be expressed
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:47] and so i feel like so many times we
[36:49] divide one another we divide against one
[36:51] another
[36:52] based off our quotes and our terminology
[36:54] instead of actively saying god revealed
[36:56] to me what this prophet is trying to
[36:58] explain
[36:59] i want to catch the revelation of what
[37:02] he's saying and why is he saying it this
[37:04] way
[37:04] amen not not this quote versus this
[37:07] quote and now we're at war one another
[37:09] because i believe he said it this way
[37:11] that's it i believe he said it this way
[37:13] that's it and they're probably both true
[37:15] if we could just fly higher above
[37:17] language
[37:18] amen and catch the divine revelation of
[37:20] what's being said
[37:22] i don't think brother branham's changing
[37:24] his mind
[37:25] especially from you know one week to the
[37:28] next
[37:30] and so when we begin to use terms like
[37:33] you're three people and one
[37:37] i mean what does that even mean you
[37:40] could we could go
[37:41] one person can go one way with this one
[37:43] person can go another way
[37:44] but just hang on let's try to catch the
[37:46] revelation of what's being said
[37:49] now there's three parts of you or three
[37:51] people of you or three
[37:53] whatever i don't care what you call it
[37:57] call it parts call it phases call it
[37:59] operations
[38:00] call it you can call anything you want
[38:02] but there's three parts body soul and
[38:04] spirit
[38:06] and brother branham is starting to talk
[38:08] about the the soul
[38:10] amen and what takes place in the soul
[38:12] and he says now
[38:16] in the message in the message the quote
[38:17] that we read out of the rising of the
[38:18] sun
[38:19] he said the sun is just now
[38:22] on you and now you're growing into a
[38:24] blossom life like he was
[38:25] to be resurrected completely in the last
[38:27] day
[38:28] your potentials you have now why do you
[38:32] know
[38:32] your soul changed didn't it and that's
[38:35] what i want to look at for a minute
[38:37] your soul changed didn't it and and
[38:39] there's a resurrection
[38:42] of the life in the soul there's a
[38:44] rapture in the soul
[38:48] there's three parts of you there's a
[38:50] soul amen
[38:51] and and men have souls but
[38:54] some men have souls that contain a
[38:57] portion of the life of god
[39:01] and some men have souls that don't
[39:04] and you can't change that amen
[39:09] and then brother talks about your spirit
[39:10] and we'll get that a minute that spirit
[39:13] is just a worldly spirit or a spirit of
[39:15] the earth an earthly spirit that's given
[39:16] to you
[39:17] in this life and when you die it breaks
[39:19] up and goes
[39:22] and then you have a body and this body
[39:24] is going to have to be changed the atoms
[39:26] in this body will have to be changed
[39:28] into a glorified condition
[39:30] right your spirit will break up and go
[39:34] because you have a spirit body a
[39:35] theophany eternal in the heavens
[39:37] and so you will be triune being you will
[39:39] be three persons
[39:40] you will be you i'll say this born again
[39:43] soul
[39:44] resurrected soul spirit body theophany
[39:48] and glorified body changed body flesh
[39:52] body
[39:53] all right amen so that being the case
[39:57] i'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna use
[39:59] phrases and terms but don't fixate on
[40:01] when i say catch what i'm saying
[40:03] that your first body change is your
[40:06] born-again experience in the soul
[40:09] your first body change your first
[40:11] resurrection in rapture
[40:12] is the change that takes place when
[40:15] light amen the word for the hour the
[40:17] light the spirit of god
[40:18] whatever term you want to use i don't
[40:21] care what term you use
[40:22] but when that light strikes the seed
[40:24] that's in the soul
[40:25] it springs forth to life i mean that's
[40:28] the first body change your soul
[40:30] changed it was it changed amen
[40:34] now let's keep let's keep going i want
[40:36] to stay on this
[40:39] brother brahm says in the true easter
[40:40] seal from 1961
[40:42] it says now we are resurrected today
[40:45] we are in 1961
[40:49] we are resurrected today absolutely why
[40:52] can we have such a time over the things
[40:53] of god because we're resurrected
[40:56] those who he foreknew he called those
[40:58] who he called he justified those we
[40:59] justified
[41:00] he has glorified then we are now
[41:03] resurrected
[41:04] we are resurrected from the inside out
[41:07] not from the outside in
[41:10] this is so important because because
[41:13] we're we're
[41:14] we're waiting for a resurrection so we
[41:16] can see our dead loved ones so we can
[41:17] get enough faith for our bodies to
[41:19] change
[41:20] we're resurrected from the inside out
[41:23] not the outside
[41:24] in it's not an outside
[41:27] factor that's going to all of a sudden
[41:30] bring me faith
[41:31] what's going to bring me faith is going
[41:32] to be the thing that's been working in
[41:34] me all along
[41:35] we're resurrected from the inside out
[41:38] the first person out or the first body
[41:42] out if i could say it that way it's
[41:45] it's probably not a correct term so
[41:47] don't worry about it just catch what i'm
[41:49] saying
[41:52] amen so for me just the way i see it
[41:55] my first body change was that body of
[41:58] the soul the person of the soul
[42:00] whatever changed not what i was
[42:05] changed here we go then we are now
[42:09] resurrected we are resurrected from the
[42:11] inside out not from the outside in
[42:13] oh do you notice not sealed out this way
[42:15] but sealed in
[42:16] oh my if the church could just see it
[42:19] we're not sealed out we're sealed in
[42:21] them days when the sin was abomination
[42:23] before god
[42:24] there was no appropriation to take it
[42:26] away we were sealed away from him
[42:28] now when that ripped in two and that
[42:30] seal was broke by a sin offering being
[42:32] made from us
[42:34] now we're baptized inside and sealed
[42:37] inside
[42:38] we are resurrected
[42:42] praise god i'm resurrected i've been
[42:45] caught up in the heavenly places why
[42:46] amen because i was sealed inside and i'm
[42:49] resurrected from the inside out
[42:51] so the resurrection and the rapture has
[42:53] already happened for me
[42:54] in the soul now that amen
[42:58] that change will affect another change
[43:01] and that other change will be my body
[43:02] will be changed into a glorified
[43:04] condition
[43:07] but you see i can't fixate on one until
[43:10] i first come to the first
[43:13] some day someday someday i'm telling you
[43:16] if someday hasn't already happened for
[43:18] you you've got your eyes on the wrong
[43:20] place
[43:20] i mean we need to come back to the
[43:22] inside man and say god i need something
[43:24] for you that will quicken me to life
[43:26] i need something from you that will
[43:28] change me amen that will change me from
[43:30] the inside out
[43:33] so now we are baptizing inside and
[43:37] sealed inside we are resurrected
[43:39] we are now resurrected already
[43:41] resurrected how do you know
[43:43] the bible said so amen we are now
[43:45] resurrected we are now raised with him
[43:47] in spiritual resurrection
[43:49] what does the word quicken mean quicken
[43:51] means resurrection
[43:52] that's right we're already resurrected
[43:55] right now
[43:56] setting together in heavenly places in
[43:58] christ jesus enjoying the easter seal
[44:02] i'm glad i can believe that amen
[44:06] now this is the quote that i was
[44:07] referring to earlier in the message
[44:09] leadership
[44:10] 1965 your spirit breaks up when you die
[44:13] it takes its flight but your soul lives
[44:15] on
[44:16] so brother brahms referring to this why
[44:19] because we bypassed our theophany amen
[44:21] and when we came to this earth to be
[44:22] tempted we were given a spirit an
[44:24] earthly spirit a spirit of the world
[44:26] amen so that we could face temptation
[44:28] but we have that spirit body
[44:30] already waiting eternal in the heavens
[44:33] so there's three persons of you
[44:35] so and the message knoweth it not in
[44:38] 1965
[44:40] it says now this outside man is the
[44:42] flesh
[44:43] that's what we look at what we see and
[44:45] it has five inlets to the body
[44:47] any grammar school child as myself would
[44:49] know there
[44:50] there is five senses controlling the
[44:52] body see taste feel smell
[44:54] and hear without that you can't touch
[44:56] the body that's the only way you have to
[44:58] the body
[44:58] see taste feel smell here you see it
[45:01] taste it feel it
[45:02] now this is the evil one on the outside
[45:05] now inside of that is a spirit which you
[45:07] become when you're born in the earth
[45:09] and the breath of life is breathed into
[45:11] him the spirit
[45:12] is of a worldly nature because it was
[45:15] not given from god
[45:16] but it was permitted by god now you've
[45:19] got that for every child that's born in
[45:20] the world is born in sin
[45:22] shaped in the nicu we come to the world
[45:23] speaking lies that right
[45:25] so that person inside there is a center
[45:27] to begin with
[45:28] now it's got five inlets and then five
[45:31] inlands i don't know whether i can call
[45:33] them right off
[45:34] first you know is conscience and love
[45:36] and no conscience love reason there's
[45:37] there's five inlets to the spirit you
[45:39] can't think with your body you have to
[45:41] think with your spirit
[45:42] you can't have conscience in your body
[45:44] it has no mental faculties at all
[45:46] your body doesn't so you have to think
[45:47] with your spirit you have to reason you
[45:49] can't reason with your physical being
[45:51] because reason doesn't see taste feel
[45:53] smell or hear
[45:54] reason is what you can make in your mind
[45:57] if you're asleep or you're out your body
[45:58] is laying there dead
[46:00] but your spirit can still reason there
[46:02] is five senses that control the inside
[46:04] man
[46:05] now to the last man which is the soul
[46:08] there is only one sense that controls
[46:10] that and that is free moral agency free
[46:12] will to choose or reject
[46:14] so once again brother telling us that
[46:17] that
[46:17] the outside man that's the flesh amen
[46:20] then the inside man that spirit
[46:22] he said that's a spirit of a worldly
[46:24] nature because it was not given from god
[46:26] it was permitted by
[46:28] god and that's the thing that breaks up
[46:30] and takes its flight
[46:31] when you die you don't need it no more
[46:34] you've got another one
[46:37] he says this last man i love the
[46:40] terminology this last man how many men
[46:42] are you
[46:43] how many persons are you he's he's just
[46:46] trying to explain something
[46:49] now in the message souls that are the
[46:52] souls that are in prison now in 1963
[46:55] now the soul of the man is not the body
[46:57] of man it's the soul
[46:59] and the soul is something that the
[47:00] nature of the spirit and then when the
[47:02] nature of a man when
[47:04] when we are dead the scripture plainly
[47:06] tells us that we are dead and our lives
[47:08] are hidden god through christ
[47:09] sealed there by the holy spirit now it
[47:12] wasn't that your body died it wasn't
[47:13] your spirit died
[47:14] it was the nature of your spirit died
[47:16] see the nature which is the soul
[47:18] the nature of your soul is god if you're
[47:21] born again
[47:22] if it's not it's of the world
[47:25] so brother branham is is is just using
[47:27] terms and explaining
[47:28] and we'll just keep moving colossians
[47:31] three
[47:32] we'll see if god can just open to us
[47:35] and share with us the thing that's on my
[47:37] heart
[47:39] colossians 3
[47:42] and verse 1.
[47:48] colossians 3 and 1.
[47:52] if you then be risen with christ seek
[47:54] those things which are above where
[47:55] christ sitteth on the right hand of god
[47:58] set your affection on things above not
[48:00] on things on the earth fear
[48:02] you are dead and your life is hid with
[48:04] christ in god
[48:06] so you are dead and your life is hid in
[48:08] christ with god that's what the
[48:09] scripture brother branham referred to
[48:11] you're
[48:11] dead amen your soul died
[48:14] your soul changed something changed
[48:16] inside an old nature died the seed
[48:19] nature came to life
[48:21] in the in the message the invisible
[48:23] union of the bride of christ 1965
[48:26] how did you come to this you were
[48:28] deceived into it by your first marriage
[48:30] to your adulterous parent eve it's no
[48:32] fault of your own by your natural birth
[48:34] you come after eve
[48:35] who committed adultery that's the reason
[48:37] you was born unadulterous
[48:40] you're a sinner to begin with that's
[48:41] right you was deceived into it
[48:43] no no you it ain't your fault you never
[48:47] did it because that
[48:48] little germ that was in you was to be
[48:50] you before the foundation of the world
[48:52] god put your name in the lamb's book of
[48:54] life
[48:55] i mean there's that seed life down in
[48:57] your soul when you come into this earth
[48:59] amen there's a part of god down on the
[49:01] inside
[49:02] of the soul amen and that was to be you
[49:04] but you've come the wrong way amen
[49:06] we didn't come god's originally intended
[49:09] way if we were to come that way
[49:11] amen that's the life that would have
[49:12] dominated from the beginning but of no
[49:14] fault of our own we come
[49:16] amen the wrong way and so now there
[49:18] there's
[49:19] something in the soul that needs to be
[49:21] purged there's a pollution there's a
[49:22] corruption
[49:25] amen there's a pollution there's a
[49:27] corruption
[49:28] and he says it's because of your uh
[49:31] marriage to your adulterous parent eve
[49:32] it's no fault of your own
[49:34] by your natural birth you come after eve
[49:36] who committed adultery
[49:38] you never did it because that little
[49:41] germ that was in you was to be you
[49:42] before the foundation of the world
[49:44] and that's the part that god's focused
[49:46] on
[49:48] aren't you glad that that's the part
[49:50] that he's focused on
[49:52] because that's not the part the devil's
[49:54] focused on
[49:55] and that's not the part that we struggle
[49:58] with in our flesh we struggle with the
[49:59] outer man amen we struggle with the
[50:01] spirit realm amen and the devil works on
[50:03] those things
[50:04] but god is interested in what's on the
[50:06] inside of that soul
[50:07] that's a part of himself that he's
[50:09] gathering back to himself
[50:10] it's been sowed into the earth and now
[50:12] he's coming amen the holy ghost is here
[50:15] seeking out that which was lost
[50:18] looking for the lost sheep not
[50:21] trying to convert goats to sheep but
[50:23] he's looking for the lost sheep
[50:25] amen they were already sheep and now
[50:27] they're lost and now he's here seeking
[50:29] out what already belongs to him
[50:31] what is already part of him amen and
[50:33] that's the part that he's focused on
[50:35] and how is he going to awaken that seed
[50:38] how is he going to find it amen he's
[50:40] going to find it by shining the light of
[50:42] the word
[50:42] and when he shines the light of the word
[50:44] amen what what
[50:45] what is laying down in that seed what is
[50:48] the seed gene of god
[50:49] it is god and god is the word
[50:54] and i can use all kinds of terms here
[50:56] but who cares about the terms catch the
[50:58] reality
[50:59] it's godliner god is the word amen so
[51:02] when god comes to find
[51:03] the word that's laying there god brings
[51:05] the word amen and when the word finds
[51:08] the word amen it quickens the life so
[51:10] how does he find it
[51:11] he brings the word for that day the
[51:13] predestinated word for that day
[51:15] and the predestinated word for that day
[51:17] is light
[51:19] it is life it is spirit it is word
[51:23] it is christ it is god it is all of
[51:26] those things
[51:27] because why he's hunting out the
[51:29] counterpart
[51:30] and to find the counterpart he's got to
[51:32] bring something of the original
[51:34] to find the original that's laying there
[51:37] [Music]
[51:39] that's why he brings a messenger in each
[51:41] age that's why he brings a message in
[51:43] each phase that's why he brought a
[51:44] messenger in
[51:45] our age to bring the word for our day
[51:47] that will quicken the seed that's
[51:48] predestinated for this
[51:50] day because the light comes to the light
[51:54] amen the life
[51:57] comes to the life the word comes to the
[52:01] word amen
[52:04] oh praise be to god
[52:08] see we talk about a a new birth but to
[52:10] have a new birth
[52:12] amen uh uh would you just understand it
[52:14] just ignorantly
[52:15] this way if i'm going to have a birth
[52:18] amen and a cat
[52:19] i have to have a cat come to a cat
[52:23] i have to have a dog come to a dog
[52:28] so it's got to be god and god to have a
[52:32] son of god
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:35] amen praise be to god i just love it
[52:38] simple like that
[52:40] and childish like that
[52:44] now let's look at first peter together
[52:51] first peter chapter 1 verse 22.
[53:09] first peter chapter 1 verse 22
[53:13] seeing ye have purified your souls and
[53:15] obeying the truth
[53:16] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[53:18] of the brethren see that you love one
[53:20] another
[53:21] with a pure heart fervently being born
[53:23] again not of corruptible seed but of
[53:25] incorruptible by the word of god which
[53:28] liveth and abideth
[53:29] forever so brother brahma says
[53:33] or not brother peter says
[53:36] in 1 22 i love it when it all runs
[53:39] together
[53:40] and it all becomes the same thing jesus
[53:42] brother branham paul peter
[53:45] what's the difference it's the word
[53:48] seeing you have purified your souls and
[53:50] obeying the truth through the spirit
[53:51] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[53:53] see that you love one another with a
[53:54] pure heart fervently being born again
[53:56] not of corruptible seed but of
[53:58] incorruptable
[53:59] by the word of god which liveth and
[54:01] bideth forever
[54:02] your first birth came by corruptable
[54:04] seed but your second birth comes of
[54:05] incorruptible seed because the
[54:07] incorruptible seed is already laying
[54:08] there in the soul
[54:11] and you're born again of incorruptible
[54:12] seed by the word of god
[54:14] the word of god is is the mechanism that
[54:17] god uses to bring the birth
[54:20] amen but in verse 22 says see you have
[54:23] purified your souls and obeying the
[54:24] truth
[54:25] because something something you didn't
[54:28] come the original way
[54:29] you didn't come the right way you've
[54:31] come now through
[54:32] through the adulterous parent eve has
[54:35] now started something in the earth and
[54:37] now
[54:38] the children of god are coming in a way
[54:40] that god did not originally intend for
[54:42] them to come
[54:42] and they're coming now when something in
[54:45] their soul
[54:46] needs to be purified now he says you
[54:48] have to purify your soul
[54:50] amen and so god has to come down amen
[54:53] and purify the soul and quicken the seed
[54:55] to life
[54:56] and bring it to life and i know i've
[54:58] heard it taught before
[54:59] about an exchange of the soul that the
[55:02] seed is the soul and
[55:03] and the first one dies it goes away and
[55:06] is annihilated and
[55:07] dissolved completely and a new soul
[55:09] grows out of the sea that's in the
[55:10] inside
[55:11] i don't believe that and the reason i
[55:13] don't believe that is you've purified
[55:15] your souls amen
[55:16] if that was the case that's the only
[55:18] inside that creates a new soul
[55:19] does it need to be purified why would
[55:21] you purify what's already pure
[55:25] so there's something wrong through the
[55:26] birth there's something wrong
[55:28] that come all the way back in the garden
[55:30] of eden now we've come in a way
[55:32] that something has to happen to purify
[55:34] our souls and
[55:35] and when it purifies our souls now by
[55:38] the word of god
[55:39] there's a new birth of incorruptible
[55:41] seed
[55:43] man that's just the way i see it amen
[55:44] that's just the way it comes to me or
[55:45] else why would there be salvation for
[55:47] the soul
[55:49] the soul is lost has to be saved why
[55:51] would the soul need to be redeemed
[55:53] amen there's something wrong with the
[55:55] soul it's got to be purified by the fire
[55:57] of god we'll read that in a minute it's
[55:58] got to be redeemed it's got to be saved
[56:00] salvation has to come to the soul amen
[56:03] not not a
[56:04] not another soul not an exchange of soul
[56:06] amen but that soul
[56:08] has the seed the gene of god woven into
[56:10] the fabric of the essence of who you are
[56:13] and god has to bring a purifying fire to
[56:15] burn away the old nature the corruption
[56:18] that is set in
[56:18] so the incorruptable seed can spring
[56:20] forth the life by the word of god
[56:23] that's the way i understand the message
[56:25] is where i understand the scriptures
[56:26] amen that's the saving of a soul the
[56:29] purifying of a soul
[56:32] brother bam says in in future home
[56:35] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[56:37] earthly bride he says remember the holy
[56:40] ghost descended on jesus which jesus was
[56:42] a part of the earth
[56:44] why the germ of god the life of god was
[56:46] designed
[56:47] in the womb of a woman that's right
[56:48] which was the earth all right
[56:50] and then the life of god come in so he
[56:53] was the beginning of the creation of god
[56:55] see
[56:56] and then that blood of god that was
[56:57] there by that germ when it was shed at
[56:59] calvary dropped back upon the earth what
[57:02] for
[57:02] to redeem the earth now it's been
[57:04] justified
[57:05] it's been sanctified called and claimed
[57:08] announced to be received its baptism of
[57:10] fire
[57:10] and cleansed for jesus and his bride so
[57:13] brother ma'am's talking about
[57:14] the future home that we're coming
[57:16] through there's he's already
[57:18] washed it amen in water and noah's flood
[57:20] he's already dropped blood on it when
[57:22] jesus christ came and dropped his blood
[57:23] for sanctification but there's going to
[57:25] be a holy fire from god that burns it
[57:27] off at the end of the millennium
[57:29] amen to cleanse this earth amen to
[57:31] purify the earth
[57:33] for jesus and his bride and brother is
[57:36] running this in parallel as a type of
[57:38] our new birth
[57:39] and brother says and you are these other
[57:41] parts that's drawn out of this earth
[57:43] the earth you're a part of the earth
[57:45] your body your soul is part of god
[57:47] an attribute of god displayed here on
[57:49] the earth in a body
[57:50] the body is to be redeemed now the soul
[57:53] is redeemed
[57:54] because it was in sin
[57:57] because it was in sin so god come
[58:00] down by a process of justification
[58:03] sanctification
[58:04] baptism of the holy ghost and redeemed
[58:06] your soul
[58:08] so the same thing that he does to the
[58:10] earth he does
[58:11] to you
[58:16] same thing he does to the earth he does
[58:18] to you justification sanctification
[58:20] baptism of the holy ghost in the message
[58:23] things that are to be in 65
[58:25] now the next thing you receive was the
[58:27] baptism of the holy ghost and fire
[58:30] now god when this millennium is over god
[58:32] is going to give the world a baptism of
[58:34] fire
[58:34] it's going to blow the whole thing up
[58:36] the heaven and earth will be on fire
[58:38] peter said so and the thing will have a
[58:40] baptism of fire renovation of the whole
[58:42] thing
[58:43] and then there'll be a new heavens and a
[58:45] new earth that's when they'll dwelleth
[58:47] righteousness
[58:48] that's where we are we have become from
[58:51] mortal beings from time beings to
[58:52] eternal beings
[58:54] when the word of god lit our souls
[58:58] when the word of god that fire of god
[59:00] the light of god
[59:01] it's all the same thing the light of god
[59:03] the fire of god
[59:04] amen it lit when that when the word of
[59:07] god lit
[59:08] our souls we become sons and daughters
[59:10] of god with the attributes the gene of
[59:12] god
[59:12] in us to be sons and daughters of the
[59:14] father god in heaven crying
[59:16] abba father my god my god in my father's
[59:20] house
[59:21] there's something laying there amen like
[59:24] the earth is an
[59:25] attribute of god and god is not going
[59:29] to destroy the earth and do away from it
[59:32] when god says he's going to destroy the
[59:33] earth what he's talking about is
[59:35] destroying the surface of the earth
[59:38] and reforming it to a place where he and
[59:40] his bride can live
[59:42] he's not annihilating the earth and the
[59:44] fact that he can even call it
[59:46] annihilation
[59:47] but he's annihilating the surface of the
[59:49] earth and burning off all impurity and
[59:50] all germs
[59:51] that's why the holy fire falls from god
[59:54] out of heaven
[59:55] and that's why the holy fire falls at
[59:56] the end of the millennium is to purge it
[59:58] to burn it to purify it
[1:00:02] so that it's a proper dwelling place for
[1:00:04] christ and his bride to live together
[1:00:07] and he does the same thing for our souls
[1:00:11] he comes down in justification and
[1:00:14] sanctification but
[1:00:15] when the word lit into our souls when he
[1:00:18] comes down with the holy fire of god
[1:00:19] he is burning out amen all the
[1:00:22] impurities he's purifying
[1:00:23] amen to make it a fit place for him and
[1:00:25] his bride to live together
[1:00:28] i in you and you and me you in christ
[1:00:30] christ and you
[1:00:33] praise me to god brother bam says in
[1:00:36] the god of this evil age in 1965 he said
[1:00:39] but let them get the real divine healing
[1:00:42] the healing of the soul the real divine
[1:00:46] healing is the healing of the soul
[1:00:49] amen which makes a new creature
[1:00:53] passes from death and alive then waiting
[1:00:56] in this old tabernacle for redemption of
[1:00:58] the body
[1:00:58] after the soul has been redeemed grant
[1:01:01] it lord
[1:01:02] amen now what how do i know
[1:01:05] that i'm going to come to a body change
[1:01:07] amen because i've already changed amen
[1:01:10] something came and burnt the impurities
[1:01:12] out of me something came and purified
[1:01:14] amen my soul something came the word lit
[1:01:17] into my soul
[1:01:17] and changed there was an effective
[1:01:19] change a new birth a new creature
[1:01:21] a new creation what did it come from
[1:01:25] amen when you go all the way back to
[1:01:27] genesis and you find the world covered
[1:01:29] in water
[1:01:29] amen it was brother ben said it was
[1:01:31] burnt over with water
[1:01:35] strange terminology burnt over with
[1:01:36] water but it was destroyed
[1:01:40] but the earth was still there all the
[1:01:42] elements were still in it
[1:01:44] but there was a judgment upon the earth
[1:01:46] from a previous civilization
[1:01:47] and something had to be washed off amen
[1:01:50] and so
[1:01:50] out of the earth could come the life
[1:01:52] that's already there
[1:01:55] not crumple up the ball of there throw
[1:01:57] it away and bring a new one out
[1:01:59] no take this one and purify it wash it
[1:02:02] and purify
[1:02:03] to take the life that's already there
[1:02:05] because it's an attribute of god and god
[1:02:08] is not going to do away with his
[1:02:09] attributes
[1:02:11] he will wash it he will purify he will
[1:02:13] redeem it he will purge it and make it a
[1:02:15] place lived but he will not do away with
[1:02:16] his attributes
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:18] he will make it a fit place to live on
[1:02:21] and now when we come to the holy fire of
[1:02:22] god at the millennium
[1:02:24] he's not burning it down amen to where
[1:02:26] it's gone no more
[1:02:27] and then poofy creates a new one no he's
[1:02:29] burning this one down
[1:02:31] so that the life that's there can come
[1:02:33] back out again to make it a fit
[1:02:35] place a pure place a holy place a
[1:02:37] sanctified place for he and his bride to
[1:02:39] live
[1:02:40] and that's what he's doing in this
[1:02:42] resurrection and this rapture in our
[1:02:44] soul
[1:02:44] he's burning it down burning the old
[1:02:46] nature out amen burning out the
[1:02:48] impurities whatever
[1:02:49] came by coming the wrong way he's
[1:02:52] burning it out
[1:02:52] so he can take that life that's laying
[1:02:55] there and after the impurities are
[1:02:56] burned out
[1:02:57] it can spring to life amen and become
[1:02:59] the control tower down in the soul
[1:03:04] now we talk about the life down in the
[1:03:07] soul
[1:03:09] you know we use terms we're going to go
[1:03:11] back to this thing with terms
[1:03:13] we say it's in a dormant state or it's
[1:03:15] like it's dead
[1:03:16] you can't kill the life of god
[1:03:19] it can't ever be dead
[1:03:22] amen but it's like it's dead it's
[1:03:25] inactive
[1:03:26] it's dormant it's just laying there
[1:03:29] because why brother branham said it's
[1:03:31] zoe life
[1:03:34] zoe life is the life of god the life of
[1:03:36] god can't die
[1:03:38] but it's laying there waiting waiting
[1:03:42] waiting waiting for what for the word to
[1:03:46] light it off for the spark to come for
[1:03:48] the holy spirit to come
[1:03:49] for whatever it is to find itself for
[1:03:51] the scream of the eagle
[1:03:54] for the word to come to the word for the
[1:03:55] light to come to the light for the life
[1:03:57] to come to their life
[1:03:58] i don't care how you say it it's just
[1:04:00] waiting for its counterpart to come
[1:04:02] and come and burn off all of this so
[1:04:04] that this can spring to life
[1:04:07] and he says the god who is rich in mercy
[1:04:11] 1965 many of you can fellowship with me
[1:04:14] on this thought
[1:04:15] when you was a little boy or little girl
[1:04:17] you would walk around and
[1:04:18] there would be certain things that would
[1:04:20] just where it wouldn't bother the other
[1:04:22] kids it seemed like there was something
[1:04:23] in you that cried out
[1:04:24] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[1:04:27] sinner you remember that
[1:04:28] certainly now what was that that was
[1:04:31] that little form of life in you then
[1:04:35] and then after a while you heard the
[1:04:37] gospel maybe you went to church
[1:04:39] you picked out this and that and went
[1:04:40] from the nomination to the nomination
[1:04:42] but one day
[1:04:43] you being part of god you had to be part
[1:04:46] of the word
[1:04:47] and when you heard the word you know
[1:04:50] where you come from
[1:04:51] you know that was the truth you were
[1:04:53] always the seed was in you
[1:04:55] always the word seen the word that was
[1:04:58] in you
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] the word seen the word that was in you
[1:05:04] that was before the foundation of the
[1:05:06] world saw the word and you came
[1:05:08] to it what happened
[1:05:11] what happened in your new birth amen the
[1:05:13] word saw the word
[1:05:15] the word from the word predestinated saw
[1:05:18] the word
[1:05:19] before the foundation of the world i
[1:05:21] don't know how else the word it amen the
[1:05:22] word saw the word the life saw the light
[1:05:25] two omnipotents met yes
[1:05:30] two parts of god come in contact with
[1:05:32] one another and triggered
[1:05:34] a new creation
[1:05:37] praise god let's go to john chapter 3.
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:51] john chapter 3 and we'll start in verse
[1:05:54] 1.
[1:06:01] there was a man of the pharisees named
[1:06:02] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[1:06:05] the same came to jesus by night and said
[1:06:07] unto him rabbi
[1:06:08] we know that thou art a teacher come
[1:06:10] from god for no man can do these
[1:06:12] miracles that thou doest
[1:06:13] except god be with him jesus answered
[1:06:16] and sent in him
[1:06:17] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[1:06:19] man be born again he cannot see
[1:06:21] the kingdom of god that means after
[1:06:25] you're born again you can see it
[1:06:28] but your eyeballs didn't change because
[1:06:31] there's another kind
[1:06:32] of life it's not this life it's this
[1:06:34] life
[1:06:36] nicodemus sayeth unto him
[1:06:39] how can a man be born when he is old can
[1:06:42] he enter the second time into his
[1:06:43] mother's womb and be born
[1:06:45] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[1:06:46] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:06:48] of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of
[1:06:50] god
[1:06:52] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:06:54] and that which is born of the spirit
[1:06:55] is spirit marvel not that i said unto
[1:06:58] thee you must be born again
[1:07:00] the wind bloweth where it listeth or
[1:07:02] where it wills
[1:07:03] and thou hearst the sound thereof but
[1:07:05] cast not tell whence it cometh
[1:07:07] and whether it goeth so is everyone that
[1:07:10] is born of the spirit
[1:07:12] praise god you're a mystery just like
[1:07:15] the wind
[1:07:16] they can see the rustle in your life
[1:07:17] they can hear the effect in your life
[1:07:20] but they cannot tell where you came from
[1:07:21] and where you're going amen but you
[1:07:23] yourself
[1:07:24] know where you came from and where
[1:07:25] you're going
[1:07:27] if you're born again you're just as much
[1:07:29] a mystery
[1:07:31] now brother brahma says in the easter
[1:07:33] seal
[1:07:35] but he that understands he that knoweth
[1:07:38] his place
[1:07:38] in this hour he that heareth my word and
[1:07:41] believeth on him that
[1:07:42] sent me hath present tense eternal life
[1:07:44] shall not come into the judgment but his
[1:07:46] path
[1:07:46] already passed from death into life then
[1:07:49] when this
[1:07:50] new when this new eternal life dwells in
[1:07:52] you it is the potential
[1:07:54] or the earnestness of you being being
[1:07:56] quickened from
[1:07:57] mortal to immortality let me say that
[1:08:00] again when this spirit has found you the
[1:08:02] individual
[1:08:03] and has come upon you it is the
[1:08:05] potential of your eternal inheritance
[1:08:07] that god thought of you and made for you
[1:08:08] before the foundation in the world
[1:08:10] that is your potential like if you ask
[1:08:12] me for an oak tree
[1:08:14] and give you an acorn the light the life
[1:08:17] for the oak tree is in the acorn now but
[1:08:19] you have to wait till it grows up
[1:08:22] further down the same quote he says now
[1:08:24] notice it's the earnest or the potential
[1:08:26] the quickening power of your
[1:08:27] resurrection
[1:08:28] when you receive the holy spirit is then
[1:08:31] dwelling in you the potential of it
[1:08:33] now you are now on your way growing to
[1:08:36] the full resurrection
[1:08:38] no tree just comes up overnight it's got
[1:08:40] to grow as we grow in grace and
[1:08:42] knowledge of god
[1:08:43] you are baptized into the holy spirit
[1:08:45] now as the pentecostal church baptized
[1:08:47] in the holy spirit
[1:08:48] it's begin growing limbs has died they
[1:08:50] prune them off
[1:08:51] but the tree is still growing it's still
[1:08:53] going on because it's got to come to the
[1:08:54] resurrection
[1:08:56] they'll they're led by the spirit to
[1:08:58] quicken the word to you who is believers
[1:09:01] the word keeps quickening as you come to
[1:09:03] first limb second limb third limb
[1:09:05] on up it just keeps quickening the
[1:09:07] spirit of god
[1:09:08] keeps quickening to you so
[1:09:12] brother is telling us when when that
[1:09:14] life comes into you
[1:09:15] and the holy spirit comes and you
[1:09:17] receive it and you're quickened to life
[1:09:18] he said that's your potential
[1:09:20] now now you're growing into the full
[1:09:22] resurrection
[1:09:23] if i can say this way you've already
[1:09:25] resurrected and seated with him in the
[1:09:26] heavenly place you've already raptured
[1:09:28] up
[1:09:28] and now you're growing into full
[1:09:30] resurrection
[1:09:31] full rapture which will be the change of
[1:09:33] this body
[1:09:34] when the atoms change amen and so now
[1:09:37] what's happening
[1:09:38] is now the potentials are there amen the
[1:09:41] seed has sprung to life
[1:09:42] and now it's got to grow into the full
[1:09:45] maturity
[1:09:46] or the full or full manifestation of
[1:09:48] what's already taken place
[1:09:50] when it grows to the place where we come
[1:09:52] to the full resurrection
[1:09:54] the full rapture those are terms forget
[1:09:57] the terms
[1:09:59] but you've already resurrected and
[1:10:00] you've already raptured
[1:10:03] but we're waiting for this body for the
[1:10:06] atoms to change in this body
[1:10:09] now how are these atoms going to change
[1:10:11] in this body
[1:10:12] brother bam said it'll be a revelation
[1:10:17] how are they going to change because i
[1:10:19] go sit on a bench
[1:10:21] and say i'm a child of god and someday
[1:10:23] god's going to do something magical
[1:10:25] and poof no
[1:10:28] we're growing into it now
[1:10:32] we're growing into the full resurrection
[1:10:34] now amen
[1:10:35] the the resurrection of your soul
[1:10:40] is bringing the resurrection of your
[1:10:43] body
[1:10:44] the rapture of your soul is producing
[1:10:47] the rapture of your body
[1:10:49] amen it's not that i'm waiting to be
[1:10:51] raptured you are
[1:10:52] being raptured right now and if your
[1:10:55] flesh is not being resurrected and
[1:10:57] raptured right now
[1:10:58] you need to go back and check the inside
[1:11:00] man and make sure there's been a
[1:11:02] resurrection in there
[1:11:03] because the resurrection in there brings
[1:11:05] this outer man
[1:11:06] subject to the spirit that's on the
[1:11:08] inside
[1:11:10] and it begins to grow and grow and feed
[1:11:12] on the word and grow and grow and as it
[1:11:14] grows
[1:11:14] it brings this outside more in line more
[1:11:17] in line
[1:11:18] more in line with the word
[1:11:22] that's why sometimes we make excuses
[1:11:25] amen in the flesh and say well this is
[1:11:26] my flesh and someday that will change
[1:11:28] absolutely someday it'll be completely
[1:11:30] changed but it should be changing today
[1:11:33] there should be effective changes taking
[1:11:35] place in the outside men
[1:11:36] because of the life on the inside
[1:11:40] brother bam says in the easter seal he
[1:11:42] says we are easter
[1:11:46] oh i'm waiting for easter you are easter
[1:11:50] what was easter the resurrection of
[1:11:52] jesus christ what is easter the
[1:11:53] resurrection of the bride
[1:11:56] you are easter we are now in our easter
[1:11:59] we've already raised hallelujah from the
[1:12:01] things of the world to the things of
[1:12:02] god's promise
[1:12:03] not we will we are it's the potentials
[1:12:07] in the rising of the sun he says now
[1:12:09] potentially you are resurrected
[1:12:11] you're resurrected when you receive the
[1:12:13] holy spirit in you
[1:12:15] you're resurrected right then your body
[1:12:17] is the
[1:12:18] is potentially resurrected oh i hope you
[1:12:21] catch what i'm saying
[1:12:24] who is this melchizedek and then when
[1:12:27] you become subject to that spirit
[1:12:29] it throws your whole being subject to
[1:12:31] that spirit
[1:12:32] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:12:35] but this seaword made manifest
[1:12:37] quickened hallelujah made alive
[1:12:42] and when the bible said don't do this
[1:12:43] that body quickly turns to it there is
[1:12:45] no question
[1:12:46] and what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:12:48] resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:12:50] again
[1:12:51] because it's already started
[1:12:55] it was once subject to sin and admire
[1:12:57] and corruption but now
[1:12:59] it's got the earnest it's turned
[1:13:01] heavenly
[1:13:02] now that's the earnest that you're going
[1:13:04] in the rapture
[1:13:05] it's the earnest why i'd read it again
[1:13:08] it's the earnest of the resurrection the
[1:13:10] body will be raised up again
[1:13:12] because it's already started
[1:13:15] that's the key friends it's already
[1:13:18] started
[1:13:20] i'm not what i used to be i'm not what i
[1:13:23] ought to be
[1:13:24] not what i want to be but i'm not what i
[1:13:26] used to be it's already
[1:13:30] started
[1:13:33] prophet of god said in the rising of the
[1:13:35] sun but brother when you hear that
[1:13:37] scream there's something in you your
[1:13:38] eagle to begin with
[1:13:40] why you are that seed that the
[1:13:42] resurrection of the son has dawned
[1:13:44] and the way the wave sheath upon the
[1:13:46] earth to make you recognize that you are
[1:13:48] an eagle
[1:13:49] and not a denominational chicken you see
[1:13:52] it
[1:13:52] if the spirit that raised him from the
[1:13:54] dead the word the dynamic of the word
[1:13:56] dwells in you
[1:13:57] it also quickens your mortal body
[1:14:01] there's the key it quickens your mortal
[1:14:04] body
[1:14:05] now how now how we flesh of his flesh
[1:14:08] and bone of his bone because quickly
[1:14:10] while we're yet mortal sinners
[1:14:12] mortal ready to die these bodies it
[1:14:14] quickens that body
[1:14:15] that's quickens brings to life the
[1:14:17] spirit that once liked to drink
[1:14:19] run around commit adultery and all these
[1:14:21] it's quickened
[1:14:22] why the thing died and you are
[1:14:24] resurrected it quickens your mortal body
[1:14:27] therefore your body is the temple of the
[1:14:29] dynamics because why
[1:14:31] from the beginning you are part of the
[1:14:32] mechanics oh there is your resurrection
[1:14:35] there is the church in the resurrection
[1:14:37] with him these bodies
[1:14:39] right now are quickened see you've heard
[1:14:42] you believe
[1:14:43] it changed you from a denomination to
[1:14:45] the word
[1:14:47] see the the
[1:14:51] the whole point that i'm trying to drive
[1:14:54] is that when that word of god for our
[1:14:57] age when that fire of god
[1:14:59] came down the spirit the word the life
[1:15:01] in the word
[1:15:03] when it come down and burnt
[1:15:06] off burnt that soul when it when it
[1:15:09] whatever purge purified
[1:15:11] it unlocked the mystery that was laying
[1:15:14] in the soul
[1:15:17] brother bam said you know when you were
[1:15:19] a young man and you can fill a
[1:15:20] fellowship with me on this when you were
[1:15:22] a young man or girl
[1:15:22] you just seemingly couldn't do things
[1:15:24] other kids could do there was something
[1:15:26] that you couldn't do it and you know
[1:15:27] maybe you went to a church and you
[1:15:29] bounced around from here to there but
[1:15:30] one day you heard the word
[1:15:33] and you knew it was true see what was
[1:15:37] that
[1:15:37] it was always there and god
[1:15:40] knows how to unlock the potentials that
[1:15:42] are there and he brings the word the
[1:15:44] matching part of what it is the word for
[1:15:46] this day
[1:15:47] with the word for this day
[1:15:51] and he brings them through and it sparks
[1:15:52] the life and when it does
[1:15:54] amen that quickens your mortal body
[1:15:58] because you who likes like to commit
[1:16:00] adultery and tell lies and smoke and
[1:16:02] drink
[1:16:02] you don't do that no more what did that
[1:16:06] a church system
[1:16:07] know what did that rules and regulations
[1:16:09] no what did that
[1:16:10] is there's a new control tower on the
[1:16:12] inside the life of god is living down
[1:16:15] out of the soul if i could just use
[1:16:18] terms uh let me use terms and just catch
[1:16:21] what i'm saying
[1:16:23] we talk so much about you know uh
[1:16:26] receiving the spirit we receive the
[1:16:27] spirit there's got to be a connection
[1:16:29] made a spark went off
[1:16:32] but where was zoe life all the time
[1:16:36] it was in the soul in the seeding of god
[1:16:38] zoe life life of god all the time
[1:16:42] what came to that to quicken it zoe life
[1:16:46] and you can call it the word you can
[1:16:47] call it the holy ghost you can call it
[1:16:49] whatever you want it's the same thing
[1:16:53] and when it came to quicken that it came
[1:16:55] to life
[1:16:56] and what comes to life and manifestation
[1:16:59] the life of god
[1:17:02] see now it's not just the life of god
[1:17:05] coming
[1:17:05] on but it's the life of god coming out
[1:17:09] amen the life of god the the mystery
[1:17:13] that was locked down in our soul
[1:17:14] unlocked by the word of god unlocked by
[1:17:17] the baptism the holy ghost
[1:17:18] now growing and now what's coming out of
[1:17:21] us spirit of god
[1:17:23] life of god holy ghost coming out of us
[1:17:26] friends
[1:17:27] that's why brother ben says you can
[1:17:29] receive the baptism the holy ghost
[1:17:31] every hour of your life and die and go
[1:17:32] to hell amen because
[1:17:34] it didn't do anything in the soul realm
[1:17:36] it was just coming upon
[1:17:37] coming upon coming upon but there's
[1:17:40] those that are out there
[1:17:41] that that spirit will come upon to
[1:17:43] quicken something that's already in
[1:17:45] and when it quickens what's already in
[1:17:47] what's inside will begin to come out
[1:17:49] and what will come out is the very life
[1:17:51] and nature of god himself
[1:17:54] the very portion that is manifested that
[1:17:57] is ordained to be manifest in this hour
[1:17:59] will come out so it's not so much that
[1:18:01] the holy ghost keeps adding and adding
[1:18:03] and adding the holy ghost
[1:18:05] unlocks and out comes more and more
[1:18:08] and more and more it's not so much
[1:18:12] if i could say it this way then i need
[1:18:13] the holy ghost to add something to me
[1:18:15] i need the holy ghost to draw something
[1:18:17] more out of me
[1:18:20] is that right mother benham said if
[1:18:23] you've got the seed of god in you
[1:18:24] amen all the potential that's in god
[1:18:27] lays in you only in a portion
[1:18:30] so i'm not i'm not really asking god add
[1:18:33] something to me add something to me
[1:18:35] i've got confidence in what he already
[1:18:37] put there what what by the preaching of
[1:18:39] the word by the lifting up of the word
[1:18:41] what he's doing is drawing that life out
[1:18:44] of the seed it's already there
[1:18:45] friends and he's drawing it up
[1:18:49] and drawing it up and drawing it up
[1:18:53] and that's why you know going to have an
[1:18:55] another fix
[1:18:56] another emotional fix amen another great
[1:18:59] time
[1:18:59] is not going to change anything if
[1:19:01] there's no seed on the inside
[1:19:04] amen we want to hear him lift it up the
[1:19:06] word preached in its power
[1:19:08] god preaching the revelation of the word
[1:19:10] to unlock more of the life that's
[1:19:12] already down inside
[1:19:14] [Applause]
[1:19:19] the life the potential it's all there
[1:19:22] it's been resurrected it's been raptured
[1:19:25] and now it's
[1:19:26] growing into its full potential and as
[1:19:29] it grows into its full potential
[1:19:31] it's taking this outside man and
[1:19:34] bringing it
[1:19:35] subject to the word
[1:19:39] and what do you think the last word will
[1:19:41] be that it comes subject to
[1:19:46] the body change the atoms change
[1:19:50] but it's not going to go from
[1:19:53] it's not going to go from toddler
[1:19:57] totting around
[1:19:58] to body change it's growing and as it
[1:20:02] grows
[1:20:02] and as it grows as the life on the
[1:20:04] inside grows
[1:20:06] the life on the outside conforms
[1:20:09] to the life on the inside because it's
[1:20:12] the control tower
[1:20:15] that's why if we say we're super
[1:20:19] revelated
[1:20:20] and can't overcome sin we need to go
[1:20:23] back to the basics
[1:20:26] we say we're super revelated but there's
[1:20:29] no spiritual growth
[1:20:30] where there's no change in us i would go
[1:20:33] back and check
[1:20:34] my my my baseline
[1:20:38] i got the revelation of the seventh seal
[1:20:40] the revelation of seven seals should
[1:20:42] produce the life of the seven seals
[1:20:48] the revelation of the word should
[1:20:49] produce the life of jesus christ the
[1:20:51] revelation of jesus christ should
[1:20:52] produce the life of jesus christ
[1:20:54] if the life of jesus christ is already
[1:20:56] in there
[1:20:58] so the life of jesus christ comes to the
[1:21:00] life of jesus christ
[1:21:01] to quicken the life of jesus christ and
[1:21:03] draw out of the seed all the potential
[1:21:06] that's already in there
[1:21:08] why do we keep reading the same message
[1:21:10] books we've already read
[1:21:12] and why do we keep reading the same
[1:21:13] bible we've already read and why do we
[1:21:15] keep coming to church every sunday and
[1:21:16] wednesday amen because we're wanting god
[1:21:19] to draw
[1:21:19] out of us more of what's already in
[1:21:21] there unlock more of the mystery unlock
[1:21:23] more of the potential
[1:21:24] by revelation by faith amen faith is a
[1:21:27] revelation by revelation
[1:21:29] unlock more and more and more of what's
[1:21:31] already on the inside
[1:21:35] and let that life bring this outer man
[1:21:37] into subjection
[1:21:38] and pull that in and pull this in and
[1:21:41] pull that in
[1:21:43] bringing it to match the word
[1:21:49] see when we
[1:21:53] when we have a wrong concept or a
[1:21:56] denominational concept of the new birth
[1:22:00] we we always hope that our confession
[1:22:04] was good enough
[1:22:06] and we always hoped that i said the
[1:22:08] right thing
[1:22:10] like i repented but you know i really
[1:22:12] repented but i forgot this thing that i
[1:22:14] did when i was five years old so do i go
[1:22:15] back and repent for that again
[1:22:19] we're looking for a formula that's a
[1:22:21] denominational approach
[1:22:24] i repented but i you know i i
[1:22:28] i don't know if i repented all the way
[1:22:30] and i'm not sure and i
[1:22:32] it's not the words that we said friends
[1:22:35] it's you may have got your words all
[1:22:37] wrong you may have been a blubbering
[1:22:39] mess amen when god come and contacted
[1:22:41] you
[1:22:41] and the soul you may have been crying so
[1:22:43] hard no words were coming out amen it's
[1:22:45] not about what's said it's not about
[1:22:48] you know what was the understanding i
[1:22:49] had right then it doesn't matter it's
[1:22:51] the understanding that he come for you
[1:22:53] amen you're part of him it's jesus
[1:22:55] christ amen
[1:22:56] revealed personally to you and you know
[1:22:59] you've made contact with him and you can
[1:23:01] be an utter wreck
[1:23:02] and a mess and forget to repent of what
[1:23:04] you did when you were 5 and 10 and all
[1:23:06] that but what you're doing is you're
[1:23:08] accepting what he's telling you
[1:23:09] that i'm yours i'm your child take me
[1:23:11] god forgive me for my wrong
[1:23:16] amen it's not about saying the right
[1:23:18] word the right phrase
[1:23:20] coming to a certain order folding our
[1:23:21] hands a certain way amen god can find
[1:23:23] you in the shower he can find you in
[1:23:25] your house in the yard in a car in
[1:23:27] church at an
[1:23:28] altar at a camp amen it doesn't matter
[1:23:30] where and it doesn't matter how
[1:23:34] your experience may be nothing like
[1:23:36] somebody else's experience but the truth
[1:23:38] is you have to have an experience and it
[1:23:40] has to be a personal experience to you
[1:23:42] where at some point you come in contact
[1:23:44] with deity and that contact with deity
[1:23:46] did something inside me that has never
[1:23:48] changed back
[1:23:50] it has changed me amen it may not be
[1:23:52] like yours and it may not match your
[1:23:54] definition or your idea of what it's
[1:23:56] like
[1:23:56] amen what should happen and all the
[1:23:58] things that should go with it but i
[1:24:00] don't know i don't know how else to
[1:24:01] explain it but i met
[1:24:02] him he came to me and changed me
[1:24:06] i've never been the same
[1:24:10] and if there's nothing there on the
[1:24:11] inside there's nothing to change you too
[1:24:16] just changing the ideas but changing the
[1:24:20] ideas will do nothing for the soul
[1:24:24] changing the soul will change the ideas
[1:24:31] brother ma'am says
[1:24:36] and the message and knoweth it not many
[1:24:38] think because they speak with tongues
[1:24:40] they got the holy ghost
[1:24:42] that don't mean that though the holy
[1:24:44] ghost does speak with tongues
[1:24:46] but until that real genuine holy spirit
[1:24:48] in there will cope with every word
[1:24:50] if the holy spirit in you that makes you
[1:24:51] speak with tongues looks back there and
[1:24:53] doesn't agree with the rest of the word
[1:24:55] then it's the wrong spirit it's got to
[1:24:58] come from the inside which
[1:25:00] is the word from the beginning
[1:25:04] you got that it's got to come from the
[1:25:06] inside which is the word from the
[1:25:07] beginning
[1:25:08] so what is the word from the beginning
[1:25:10] the message
[1:25:12] no what's inside is the word from the
[1:25:15] beginning
[1:25:16] so the revealed word comes from what was
[1:25:18] already predestinated word
[1:25:20] and brings it to life in the beginning
[1:25:23] of the creation of god when god began to
[1:25:25] create
[1:25:26] you bring you into existence you see
[1:25:29] you started back there as a seed and
[1:25:31] worked down to here where you are now
[1:25:35] you started back there as a seed in the
[1:25:37] beginning in the creation you started
[1:25:38] back there seed worked your way down to
[1:25:40] where you are now
[1:25:41] how did you work down i don't know what
[1:25:42] does all that mean i don't know one
[1:25:44] thing i know for sure
[1:25:45] is i was back there in the beginning i
[1:25:46] was in the seed and i've worked my way
[1:25:48] down to where i am now
[1:25:50] and god knew where this seed was and so
[1:25:52] he sent his spirit and he sent his word
[1:25:54] to light upon that seed to bring that
[1:25:56] seed to life so that there can be a life
[1:25:58] on the inside of this vessel that'll
[1:26:00] bring this vessel into obedience
[1:26:04] explain it any way you want to explain
[1:26:06] it with any terms you want to
[1:26:08] use but until we get to that reality it
[1:26:11] doesn't matter
[1:26:14] the reality of the seed coming to life
[1:26:18] and becoming the watchtower god on the
[1:26:20] inside
[1:26:28] go to first corinthians chapter 2.
[1:26:47] first corinthians chapter 2.
[1:26:56] and verse 11 for what knoweth
[1:27:00] what for what man knoweth the things of
[1:27:03] man save the spirit of man which is in
[1:27:05] him
[1:27:06] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:27:08] but the spirit of god
[1:27:10] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:27:12] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:27:15] that we might know the things that are
[1:27:16] freely given to us
[1:27:18] of god that first spirit came from the
[1:27:21] world
[1:27:23] remember he's in a spirit to unlock a
[1:27:25] life on the inside of us
[1:27:27] because these things are freely given to
[1:27:29] us
[1:27:30] so that we could understand
[1:27:34] how can you accept the word when
[1:27:36] millions reject the word
[1:27:39] how can you accept the word when
[1:27:40] millions reject it and people you love
[1:27:42] dearly and people who are smarter than
[1:27:44] you and i
[1:27:45] and and lived a nicer life than you and
[1:27:47] i lived they've rejected how can you and
[1:27:50] i believe this word
[1:27:51] because there was something on the
[1:27:53] inside to believe with
[1:28:00] a thinking man's filter
[1:28:04] the word cannot deny itself then it is
[1:28:06] satisfied or it's the desire
[1:28:08] it's a desire of what what made you
[1:28:10] desire in the first place
[1:28:11] because down in your soul there was a
[1:28:13] predestinated seed which was eternal
[1:28:15] life
[1:28:16] always laying in there always was in
[1:28:18] there
[1:28:19] all that the father has given me will
[1:28:20] come to me there isn't any of them going
[1:28:23] to be lost
[1:28:24] a thinking man's taste when a thinking
[1:28:26] man hears the word of god
[1:28:28] my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[1:28:30] they'll not follow
[1:28:31] for down in there is life down and there
[1:28:34] is life
[1:28:35] and life connects with life
[1:28:40] down in there is life and life what
[1:28:44] life god's life
[1:28:47] spirit life word life
[1:28:51] and life spirit word christ
[1:28:55] comes to life springs forth
[1:28:59] into life that is the resurrection
[1:29:04] that is the change in the body and the
[1:29:08] soul
[1:29:10] brother said in leadership
[1:29:14] the choice of your conduct you can mix
[1:29:16] it now you're either for god or against
[1:29:19] god and the outward expression shows
[1:29:20] exactly what's on the inside
[1:29:22] the cockapoo many of you think i got the
[1:29:24] baptism in the holy ghost i'm going to
[1:29:26] heaven
[1:29:26] that don't mean one thing that you're
[1:29:28] going to heaven
[1:29:29] no sir you can have the baptism of the
[1:29:32] holy ghost every
[1:29:33] hour in your life and still be lost and
[1:29:35] go to hell
[1:29:36] the bible says so uh-huh that's exactly
[1:29:38] right look here
[1:29:39] you're an outside person you have five
[1:29:41] senses that contacts this
[1:29:43] outside body god gave you five senses
[1:29:45] not to contact him
[1:29:46] your earthly home see taste feel smell
[1:29:48] in here then you have a spirit on the
[1:29:50] inside of that and that's five outlets
[1:29:51] conscious and love and so forth five
[1:29:53] outlets
[1:29:54] that you contact the spirit world with
[1:29:56] that but with your spirit
[1:29:58] your physical contacts the physical your
[1:30:00] spiritual context is spiritual
[1:30:02] but inside of that you've got a soul and
[1:30:05] that soul is that gene that come from
[1:30:07] god
[1:30:09] that's what the word come to quicken
[1:30:12] the word didn't come to tickle our ears
[1:30:15] the word didn't come
[1:30:16] in this day to start a new movement and
[1:30:18] do the nomination to promote a man
[1:30:20] that word came to quicken that seed
[1:30:24] we come in contact with that life and
[1:30:25] that word and that light
[1:30:27] and that whatever we come in contact
[1:30:29] with that and something in us
[1:30:31] changes and that change begins to grow
[1:30:36] and as we feed on the word and we're
[1:30:37] lifted up in revelation in the
[1:30:39] resurrection in the rapture
[1:30:40] as we lift it up it quickens
[1:30:43] our mortal bodies word by word
[1:30:48] revelation by revelation week by week
[1:30:50] month by month
[1:30:51] we should never be going backwards in
[1:30:54] our walk
[1:30:54] we should never be going backwards amen
[1:30:57] in our life
[1:30:58] amen we should be moving forward
[1:30:59] constantly climbing and going up with
[1:31:01] god
[1:31:02] revelation upon revelation word by word
[1:31:05] until finally this flesh
[1:31:08] can no longer resist the word of god
[1:31:11] amen can no longer resist the life on
[1:31:13] the inside and the life on the inside
[1:31:15] will
[1:31:16] pull this flesh into a glorified
[1:31:18] condition
[1:31:22] praise be to god
[1:31:28] amen want to read this other quote
[1:31:31] things that are to be
[1:31:33] now the only way that you can be a son
[1:31:34] or daughter of god is because you have

[1:31:54] eternal life that was god

[1:32:02] even a molecule
[1:32:04] and you are nothing but the
[1:32:05] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:32:07] was in god as the son of god
[1:32:10] i tell you when i read that it makes you
[1:32:12] say i don't want to be nothing but that
[1:32:14] and if i'm being anything but that i

[1:32:18] and be
[1:32:18] nothing but the manifestation of the

[1:32:28] up this age
[1:32:30] you know i read that for a specific
[1:32:31] reason now you're expressed
[1:32:33] after his word is coming you
[1:32:37] it takes the word to meet the word it
[1:32:40] takes the life
[1:32:41] to meet the life i can say that a
[1:32:43] thousand times
[1:32:44] but a thousand times still may not do it
[1:32:46] justice
[1:32:48] because sometimes we're looking for a
[1:32:50] certain experience or a certain
[1:32:52] emotional thing or a certain way
[1:32:54] and when god's way is to bring the life
[1:32:57] to you bring the word to you
[1:32:58] amen bring the word for this age to you
[1:33:00] and that is to bring a change
[1:33:04] that is to change to bring this life up
[1:33:07] it says you are expressing god's life in
[1:33:09] you because you are a son or daughter of
[1:33:11] god
[1:33:12] therefore you get what i mean see there
[1:33:15] you are you are now made you're sitting
[1:33:16] in this church tonight
[1:33:17] because your duty is to express god to
[1:33:19] this nation and this people in this
[1:33:21] neighborhood
[1:33:22] where you associate wherever you are
[1:33:25] god knew that you would be here because
[1:33:26] you have to be one of his genes or his
[1:33:29] attributes
[1:33:29] you had to be if you ever if you've got
[1:33:32] eternal life then it
[1:33:33] always was eternal life and god before
[1:33:36] there was a foundation of the world
[1:33:37] knew that you would be here and when the
[1:33:40] word
[1:33:40] or the water the washing of the water
[1:33:42] the word fell upon you
[1:33:44] it was expressed in a being now you have
[1:33:47] faith
[1:33:48] you have fellowship with your father god
[1:33:50] just as you have with your earthly
[1:33:51] father
[1:33:52] you are citizens of the king not
[1:33:54] citizens but your children
[1:33:55] sons and daughters of the living god if
[1:33:58] it be that eternal life
[1:33:59] dwells in you see
[1:34:02] this revelation that brother branham
[1:34:04] started bringing at the
[1:34:06] end of his ministry is to take the scare
[1:34:08] away
[1:34:10] what are we scared about well i'm scared
[1:34:13] i won't make it
[1:34:14] you already made it i'm scared i won't
[1:34:17] be there you're already there
[1:34:20] you're three persons and one person of
[1:34:22] you is already on the other side
[1:34:24] amen you have a theophany body waiting
[1:34:26] eternal in the heaven
[1:34:27] you're already made it there's no
[1:34:29] question of whether you'll make it or
[1:34:30] not amen the struggle is not will i make
[1:34:33] it the struggle is not am i one of them
[1:34:35] amen it's already been confirmed to me
[1:34:37] because i met the person of the word and
[1:34:39] changed me
[1:34:42] it's the will i make it to the rapture
[1:34:46] if you've already resurrected the
[1:34:48] rapture can't go without you
[1:34:52] if you've already raptured the rapture's
[1:34:54] not going anywhere
[1:34:56] amen until your body changes
[1:34:59] so there's no missing it there's no
[1:35:01] there's no it going on without me
[1:35:03] there's none of those things and the
[1:35:04] true revelation of the word because the
[1:35:06] true revelation the word takes the scare
[1:35:09] away amen and the whole christian walk
[1:35:11] is based on rest
[1:35:16] rest amen the key to operating any gift
[1:35:20] is to relax to find our position
[1:35:24] we can't always be i don't even know if
[1:35:26] i'm this and i don't even know if i'm
[1:35:28] that
[1:35:28] i don't even know amen
[1:35:33] i was before yes what i was before
[1:35:37] i will be am i going to make it
[1:35:41] i've already made it am i a child of god
[1:35:44] i was before the foundation of the world
[1:35:48] how do you know because my soul changed
[1:35:52] my desires changed the core of who i am
[1:35:55] it quickened the life
[1:35:57] my thoughts are on him my affections are
[1:35:59] on him
[1:36:00] i love his word and then every time i
[1:36:02] hear the word something in me just
[1:36:04] jumps for joy and i respond to that word
[1:36:08] and that word is lifting me higher and
[1:36:10] changing me by degrees it's changing me
[1:36:16] we can live our full potential when
[1:36:19] we're no longer
[1:36:20] trying to answer old questions
[1:36:24] because of denominational ideas on the
[1:36:26] new birth
[1:36:31] god i've already resurrected
[1:36:34] i've already raptured
[1:36:37] you're not leaving me behind
[1:36:40] you're not you're not going to kick me
[1:36:43] away
[1:36:44] you're not going to cast me out you've
[1:36:47] already accepted me
[1:36:49] you've already united with me you've
[1:36:52] already raised me up
[1:36:53] you're not i'm not missing anything
[1:36:57] and now i can focus on what i'm here on
[1:37:00] this earth to do
[1:37:02] is to express the life of god
[1:37:06] see the devil's always bringing us back
[1:37:08] to try to answer questions that are
[1:37:10] already answered
[1:37:12] so that we no longer express what we're
[1:37:14] supposed to be expressing in this life
[1:37:17] we should be free people free from worry
[1:37:22] free from scare free from fear we should
[1:37:24] be a free people
[1:37:27] this revelation should take all the
[1:37:30] bondage off of us all
[1:37:31] the restrictions and all the fear and
[1:37:33] all the scare it should take it off of
[1:37:35] us
[1:37:36] so that we can really be who we were
[1:37:38] always meant to be
[1:37:40] not hoping that something will work out
[1:37:42] and hoping the next move will work out
[1:37:44] but believing that the
[1:37:45] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:37:47] to the lord i'm a child of god and he
[1:37:49] saw the way that i will take he knows
[1:37:50] the way that i would take
[1:37:51] he knows the outcome and i'm a child of
[1:37:53] god walking by faith in the word of god
[1:37:56] and if i need to take a step to the
[1:37:57] right or left he will move me to the
[1:37:59] right or left because my heart is pure
[1:38:01] before
[1:38:02] him
[1:38:05] i've already the first part of me
[1:38:10] the the inside man has already
[1:38:12] resurrected and raptured
[1:38:16] the spirit body is already there
[1:38:22] i'm more there than here
[1:38:27] right can we believe it friends can we
[1:38:30] believe it
[1:38:31] i'm more there than here there's only
[1:38:34] one there's three people in me there's
[1:38:36] only one
[1:38:37] part of me only one people of me only
[1:38:39] one phase of me
[1:38:40] left to cross over amen in those two
[1:38:43] parts
[1:38:44] are pulling this part as fast and as
[1:38:46] hard as it can
[1:38:48] that's why the things of the world are
[1:38:49] dropping off of us that's why
[1:38:51] earthly desires are falling away that's
[1:38:54] why our passions are changing all the
[1:38:56] time
[1:38:56] because there's two parts already
[1:38:59] resurrected already on the other side
[1:39:01] drawing this last man over drawing this
[1:39:04] flesh man
[1:39:05] amen and bring him higher and higher and
[1:39:08] higher
[1:39:08] the resurrection is on the rapture is in
[1:39:11] place
[1:39:12] it's moving right now it's moving in me
[1:39:14] it's moving in my very flesh b
[1:39:18] how do you know it's already started has
[1:39:21] it started for you
[1:39:22] it started for me amen there's things
[1:39:25] that i have overcome
[1:39:26] in the last several years that i could
[1:39:27] never overcome before
[1:39:29] there's thought patterns that have
[1:39:31] changed amen there's desires in the
[1:39:33] flesh that have disappeared
[1:39:36] carnal desires worldly things have just
[1:39:39] begun to
[1:39:40] vanish away what did that it wasn't
[1:39:43] willpower
[1:39:44] it wasn't positive thinking amen it was
[1:39:46] the revelation in this word
[1:39:47] pooling me drawing me off of the earth
[1:39:53] and that same thing that quickens your
[1:39:56] mortal body
[1:39:58] that same spirit that same life that's
[1:40:00] in whatever you call it
[1:40:02] that same thing in you amen that is the
[1:40:04] control tower on the inside
[1:40:06] that is changing this mortal body and
[1:40:08] lining it to the word
[1:40:09] that same thing that could change amen a
[1:40:11] fallen body
[1:40:12] and that no longer will desire earthly
[1:40:15] carnal things and it will disappear
[1:40:18] and if we can see that happen what in
[1:40:20] the world are we worried about
[1:40:22] a body chain to adam's chase i'm already
[1:40:25] changing
[1:40:26] i couldn't change that but it's changed
[1:40:28] i couldn't change that desire but it's
[1:40:30] gone
[1:40:30] i couldn't stop being tempted from that
[1:40:32] but i'm no longer tempted by that
[1:40:35] we should have more confidence than
[1:40:37] anybody else on the earth that i'm going
[1:40:38] the full distance i'm going all the way
[1:40:40] whatever's drawn me this high is going
[1:40:42] to draw me the rest of the way
[1:40:45] this flesh is going to move to match
[1:40:48] what's already taken place on the inside
[1:40:53] i've already undergone one body change
[1:40:57] and i'm undergoing another this body
[1:41:02] is changing
[1:41:06] that's why we press towards the mark of
[1:41:08] the high calling that's why we feed on
[1:41:10] the word
[1:41:11] i said earlier why do we read the same
[1:41:13] book we've read 10 times
[1:41:15] why do we read the same bible we've read
[1:41:17] our whole christian lives why do we come
[1:41:19] to the same services
[1:41:21] why so that that word
[1:41:25] can be lifted up and if
[1:41:28] i live ye live also
[1:41:31] if that word and that revelation can be
[1:41:34] lifted up
[1:41:35] then it can begin to draw that life out
[1:41:37] of me
[1:41:40] see it's not a puddle it's not
[1:41:44] it's not a chicken putting peacock
[1:41:46] feathers in
[1:41:48] it's not a crow trying to be a dove
[1:41:52] it's the life on the inside the dove
[1:41:55] brother venom said is a peculiar bird
[1:41:58] because it's got oil on the inside
[1:42:01] and the oil represents the holy ghost
[1:42:03] from the inside
[1:42:04] cleans it from the inside out
[1:42:08] they don't have to take a bath it's
[1:42:09] clean from the inside out
[1:42:12] man what's happening the resurrection
[1:42:16] takes place from the inside
[1:42:18] out i'm walking
[1:42:22] in the resurrection i've been raptured
[1:42:27] and i'm being raptured oh what a
[1:42:30] revelation friends
[1:42:32] let it affect us let it change us
[1:42:35] let it draw us higher and let's all
[1:42:38] stand
[1:42:40] i want to read one quote while we stand
[1:42:41] and while the musicians come
[1:42:48] brother iran says in the message it is
[1:42:49] the rising of the son
[1:42:51] he said you believe that we shall rise
[1:42:55] in him we become part of him the easter
[1:42:57] the revealed secret of god like it was
[1:43:00] then of life after death we are now
[1:43:03] alive who were once dead in sin and
[1:43:04] trespasses
[1:43:06] the true easter seal has broke death
[1:43:08] from around me
[1:43:09] and i'm alive the easter seal at the
[1:43:13] beginning
[1:43:13] broke the seal of the roman seal the
[1:43:15] easter seal that
[1:43:17] he was sealed up and man when they died
[1:43:19] was gone but he broke that seal and
[1:43:22] revealed the secret
[1:43:23] and now god by his holy spirit has broke
[1:43:26] the seal from around our lives
[1:43:28] and christ is revealed as he lives in
[1:43:31] us for now we are quickened
[1:43:35] with him
[1:43:38] what happened in the messages in 1965
[1:43:44] for me brother branham god through
[1:43:46] brother branham
[1:43:47] took the seal off the mystery of my new
[1:43:51] birth
[1:43:53] it wasn't a decision that i made
[1:43:58] i should change that statement it wasn't
[1:44:00] only a decision that i made
[1:44:03] it wasn't only a mental agreement with
[1:44:06] the word
[1:44:08] but when he took it off and he uncovered
[1:44:10] what it was
[1:44:12] it was god finding a portion of himself
[1:44:16] my new birth was god coming to god
[1:44:19] word coming to worm life coming to life
[1:44:23] well god had four ordained before the
[1:44:24] foundation of the world a seed that had
[1:44:26] been coming down from the beginning
[1:44:27] coming all the way down to where i am
[1:44:28] now
[1:44:29] the holy ghost came and found it and
[1:44:31] when the holy ghost
[1:44:32] found it amen the fire of god the word
[1:44:35] of god
[1:44:35] lit it and it sparked into life that was
[1:44:38] my new birth
[1:44:40] that's why amen when my mind begins to
[1:44:43] falter and when my flesh becomes weak
[1:44:46] i do not lose my new birth amen i do not
[1:44:49] lose my experience with god
[1:44:51] because it wasn't something that
[1:44:52] happened just in the mind or just in the
[1:44:54] flesh it happened in the soul
[1:44:56] it was god making contact with god it
[1:44:58] was life
[1:44:59] making contact with life and that will
[1:45:02] never change
[1:45:03] it'll never fade away where brother bam
[1:45:05] said you can completely lose your mind
[1:45:07] and go insane and it won't change the
[1:45:09] soul
[1:45:11] you can so lose your mind and go insane
[1:45:13] that you can die
[1:45:14] swearing like a sailor but that doesn't
[1:45:17] touch the soul
[1:45:22] what happened the mystery's been
[1:45:24] revealed
[1:45:26] it wasn't that i just liked the message
[1:45:28] it wasn't that i just thought it was a
[1:45:30] better idea
[1:45:31] it wasn't that somebody lined up the
[1:45:32] scriptures enough to convince me
[1:45:34] that had nothing to do with it amen all
[1:45:37] that was was putting me in contact with
[1:45:39] him
[1:45:39] so that he could come in contact with me
[1:45:41] and when the two omnipotents meats
[1:45:47] the predestinated part of god that was
[1:45:49] preordained to be in this vessel of clay
[1:45:51] to manifest his life
[1:45:52] came to life that was my new birth
[1:45:57] and i'm not giving that up for nothing
[1:46:02] i'm not going to let the devil talk me
[1:46:03] out of that
[1:46:05] because it's the very thing that's
[1:46:07] changing me
[1:46:08] changing me and changing me
[1:46:12] tell your friends
[1:46:15] the try harder doctrine stinks
[1:46:21] the denominational idea stinks
[1:46:26] the denominational idea has politicians
[1:46:28] claiming to be born again christians
[1:46:31] who live all kinds of terrible lives
[1:46:35] how can they claim to be a born-again
[1:46:36] christian because all the preachers tell
[1:46:37] them they're born again because they
[1:46:40] believe jesus died on the cross
[1:46:43] and they do they believe jesus died on a
[1:46:45] cross for the sins of the world
[1:46:47] and they really believe it but why
[1:46:50] doesn't have the power to change their
[1:46:52] lives
[1:46:53] and make them moral and godly and
[1:46:55] christ-like right
[1:46:59] see that's the darkness of the
[1:47:01] nomination listen
[1:47:02] that you can agree with something you
[1:47:04] can say something and you can repeat
[1:47:05] after a preacher and you can be born
[1:47:07] again
[1:47:07] that's nonsense the only way you can be
[1:47:10] born again if there's something there to
[1:47:12] be born
[1:47:14] if there's some life there to be quick
[1:47:16] in the life
[1:47:17] if there's nothing there you cannot be
[1:47:19] born again
[1:47:21] but if there's a sea gene of god laying
[1:47:23] there then god will hunt it out
[1:47:25] god will find it because the mama eagle
[1:47:27] knew it had laid another egg
[1:47:28] and went searching the country for it
[1:47:31] god found you
[1:47:32] you didn't find god because god was
[1:47:34] already in you
[1:47:35] he had to find you because he can't lose
[1:47:37] himself
[1:47:40] oh the seal's been tore away the roman
[1:47:43] stone's been rolled away
[1:47:44] no more denominational ideas i'm a child
[1:47:47] of god
[1:47:48] not because of my conduct not because of
[1:47:50] my decisions
[1:47:51] i'm a child of god because i was in him
[1:47:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:56] and nothing's going to take that away
[1:47:58] i'm not giving it up for no
[1:48:01] silly whisper of the devil our
[1:48:03] denominational idea
[1:48:06] now can we relax into another gear
[1:48:11] can we all who were preordained to be in
[1:48:14] this life and manifest him in this world
[1:48:17] can we just drop into that channel where
[1:48:18] he can begin to operate
[1:48:20] because all the scare and all the fear
[1:48:21] is gone
[1:48:24] i'm not worried about i'll miss the boat
[1:48:26] or no
[1:48:28] i when i pray and agonize i pray to be
[1:48:30] more pleasing to him
[1:48:31] not to be saved again
[1:48:34] i just wrestle with my flesh to be more
[1:48:36] pleasing to him
[1:48:38] not to get converted again
[1:48:41] now can we just relax into that place
[1:48:44] where his life can live in
[1:48:46] us can we get away from the scare and
[1:48:48] the turmoil of who we are and what am i
[1:48:50] am i this am i that am i right am i
[1:48:52] wrong can we just drop into a channel
[1:48:54] and relax into a gift
[1:48:56] and rest in the spirit and let god start
[1:48:59] to do what only god can do
[1:49:03] praise god let the scare fade away
[1:49:07] go back to our origins
[1:49:13] go past your beginning
[1:49:17] well at my beginning go past your
[1:49:18] beginning because your beginning denotes
[1:49:21] time
[1:49:23] can you go back before your beginning
[1:49:25] and go to your origin
[1:49:28] and where is your origin if your
[1:49:30] origin's in him
[1:49:32] then everything's all right
[1:49:36] rest little bride rest
[1:49:40] fear not little flock it's the father's
[1:49:43] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:49:46] don't worry don't stress don't fret
[1:49:49] everything's on time let the peace that
[1:49:52] passes understanding
[1:49:55] envelop our hearts and bring us into
[1:49:58] that place
[1:49:59] that he wants us to be god bless you
[1:50:02] saints
[1:50:02] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[1:50:06] you lord jesus for your word
[1:50:10] god we realize the limitation of
[1:50:13] language
[1:50:14] but oh god that's how you decided to
[1:50:17] bring forth your mystery
[1:50:19] and god we accept it and i pray god that
[1:50:22] you'd move your people
[1:50:24] past the words of a man past human
[1:50:27] language
