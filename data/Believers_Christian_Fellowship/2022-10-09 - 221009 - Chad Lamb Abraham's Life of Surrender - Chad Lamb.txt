we've had plenty of practice lately praise the Lord I hope we keep the trend up so there's there's 12 months in the year there's no reason why we can't have 12 babies and 12 baby dedications so praise God let's turn to Romans 4 while we're standing Romans chapter 4. and I think we'll read just from verse three just one scripture Romans chapter 4 verse 3 for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and was counted unto him for righteousness amen God bless you as you have your seats just like to draw there that Abraham believed God and that was so key because Abraham was the father of Faith amen he is the uh we are children of Abraham by faith he's father of the royal seed and and so Abraham believed God and was counted him for righteousness that's not the the main thrust of my subject but I want to start there with Abraham believing God because his actions were based on his faith and I want to talk this morning on Abraham's life of surrender the prophet of God says in the message Faith from 1956 he said now we're speaking tonight upon faith and I thought it would be nice maybe if we would use this great character of Abraham for an example of Faith because it was to Abraham the promise was given and we'll kind of review the life of Abraham just a little because he was an outstanding character and he was a man who believed God and now he had no great background to believe God because it's commonly believed that he was from a family of idolaters he came to down from Babylon his family dwelt in their land of chaudia the city of Earth the valley of shinar and was just an ordinary man he wasn't no angel he was just a man like you and I and God looking over the Earth to see for men that he could put confidence in that would believe him regardless of circumstances he found Abraham and called Abraham by election so brother Venom said that he wanted to use Abraham because Abraham was an outstanding character and and brother random preached a lot about Abraham and we've preached a lot about Abraham he's he's the father of Faith he is a an outstanding figure he received the promise of God without condition there was a covenant with Abraham the abrahamic Covenant was an unconditional Covenant where God wasn't going to say any longer if you'll do this I'll do this but he says I will I will make of you a great nation I will give you the land and so we we are by faith Abraham's seed and part of that unconditional Covenant so it means so much to us and so I've preached on Abraham before but I just love I love the life of Abraham and as we look into it it just struck me differently this time there was something I was mooling over in my heart and as I I read through his life again it just had impact on me if we could turn to Genesis 11 I just want to look at the life of Abraham in a few places Genesis chapter 11. in verse 31. we're going to bounce around from scriptures but we're going to follow the life of Abraham through Genesis here and in Genesis 11 31 it says and Tara took Abraham his son and lot his son the son of Heron his son's son son and Sarai his daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from Irv the childish to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Heron and dwelt there and the days of Terror were 205 years and Tara died in Heron let's go over to chapter 12 verse 1 now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of the country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be blessed and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and indeed shall all families of the earth be blessed now if you go back to verse 1 it says and the Lord said unto Abram the Lord had said to Abram and brother Branham I love the way brother Branham reads the Bible amen he this is a man who who doesn't have a high level of Education no Seminary experience God called him amen and just a young man and he had very limited education in fact when he started off reading he couldn't even read his Bible in front of the congregation he would have he would have his fiancee read it or he'd have another Minister read it because he wasn't that much confident reading in public amen but he could read the Bible correctly even though he didn't have the education to read it smoothly amen he read it correctly and he could see here the Lord had said unto Abram he had said something to Abram previous to this he had already told him to leave his Kindred to leave his homeland and go into a land so if we back up to verse 31 again we know that Abraham has already been instructed to leave his Kindred and leave his home but it says in 31 that Tara which is Abram's father took his son Abram and and lot the son of Heron his son son and Sarah his wife or his daughter-in-law the son of Abram's wife and they went forth with them from Ur of the childish to go into the land of Canaan look where they're going they're going to Canaan who got the Commandment to go to Canaan Abram got the Commandment to go to Canaan and he was told to leave his Kindred leave his home and go to Canaan so now you realize that that brother Ben was going to tell us that he took his daddy along he took a lot of long he didn't fully obey God because he was supposed to leave Kindred and supposed to leave land but when he got the commission to go to Canaan all of a sudden he must have expressed it somehow to his father and his father took over and it says Tara took Abram amen Tara took Abram and they they were going on their way to Canaan which isn't exactly what God had told him it's a little bit of a deviation from the truth but they're going to Canaan they're going in the right direction and you can see how Abram Abraham when we look at this life I want to look at how Abraham was learning and how Abraham taught him because in every Junction in life God confirms the promise to Abram even though Abram's not fully there yet amen and it so matches our life because we're learning as we go amen none of us want to go back and live the level we were at four or five years ago nobody wants to go back amen we we look back and we realize that wasn't exactly right I didn't have exactly the right attitude my motive was a little questionable on that and I don't want to go back to those days I want to keep pressing forward and be more christ-like and we can see the way God let Abraham it's very much the way God leads us amen although there was some mistakes although there were some wrong motives and maybe wrong desires or wrong attitudes God still dealt with us we were believing God Amen and and it says Abraham believed God he believed what God told him he believed it enough to share it with his family he believed it enough he had to go to Canaan but when he shared it with his father his father took over and Tara took Abram and law and come up to the land and and Abram was probably happy I don't know but happy that his dad had caught the same vision and lot had caught the same vision he was believing God but not fully realizing the extent of what God meant by leave thy Kindred and leave thy family and we know I love when brother bam says this in faith he was just an ordinary man he was just a man like you and I amen so it's so easy now to go back and place yourself in Abraham's shoes as he was Abram at this time to place yourself there amen and realize I I look back on the story and realize Abraham was wrong amen but maybe Abram didn't realize he was wrong or he didn't realize how wrong he was but he's just happy he heard from the Lord he's happy that he's going on with God so they travel they begin to leave their Homeland in the south of Mesopotamia and ER and they move north because they're following the Fertile Crescent they go north in Mesopotamia and curve around and come down into the land of Canaan and as they're moving North they go up to Heron which is very much North and towards the West they're moving to Canaan and when they get to Heron they stop there and that's where Tara dies and it says verse 32 and the days of Terror were 205 years and Tara died in Heron he didn't go all the way into Canaan he died along the journey and and when you look back at this you realize that was the grace of God maybe Abraham was devastated maybe Abraham was heartbroken I don't know what his response would have been but that was the grace of God because God needed Abraham separated unto himself to fulfill the promise in his life and when Abram decided to go along and take Dad and and others with them amen God had to begin to bring a separation because Abraham was still young Abraham was still immature Abraham was still learning so God in his mercy and Grace brought the separation and it was no doubt it was hurtful to Abram but it was needful for Abraham and then God Amen from here Abraham goes on without his father so we read that in in verse one so let's drop down to verse 4. verse 4 so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 70 and 5 years old when he departed out of heron brother Ram said in Jehovah Jireh said now Abram started off he had trouble as long as his daddy was with him the old fellow died then he took his nephew and as long as lot was along there was trouble God said separate yourself walk alone with him that's the way God wants you to do separate yourself from all unbelief and walk alone with God so he goes now Tara's been separated he now he goes on with lot and it says in verse 5 and Abram took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in heroin and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan into the land of Canaan they came and Abram passed through the land unto the place of psychum Unto the place of Mora and the Canaanite was then in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and there build it he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him and he removed from thence into a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel in the west and hay I own the East and there he builded an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord and Abram journeyed going still toward the South so here Abram moves into the land and when he moves into the land he's still not in perfect obedience to the word is that right he still has a lot along with him he's still not made a total separation and as soon as he moves into the land God Appears to him and confirms a promise that he's going to give a seed and going to give the land to the seed and and and we think sometimes in our mind amen once we see somebody not in perfect submission not in a perfect walk not in a perfect way Hey listen God knows how to deal with his children amen and let God deal with his children because here Abram is not in a perfect submission he's not in complete obedience amen but because he's moving in the right direction we know that Abram believed God Amen he believed God but he didn't quite amen have a full comprehension he wasn't in full obedience but he believed God and as he moved God moved with him and when he made a step God met him in that step amen amen and the kid for us is just to keep moving obey gone but believe God and what you see and tell you to do do it amen and we look back and say I got it wrong there and I got it wrong there and I got it wrong there but when you were there you were doing the best you knew how to do you believed God and you were living for him and you realize now there was a little something wrong back there and there was a little something wrong in this situation amen but because you were a child of God and you believed God when you moved God met you amen God confirmed a promise he healed you he he did all kinds of things for us he worked in Supernatural ways amen so there's never a time to stop we must keep growing and keep going and come into perfect faith and perfect obedience into a perfect life but all along the way God is with us God called Abram he didn't call him to leave him he didn't call him to ditch him he didn't call him to say oh that's your first mistake strike one you're gone he called him because he had a purpose for Abram he knew what Abraham's destination was what his purpose was and and as Abram moved and grew and increased amen God was with him all along and God confirmed the promise and then confirmed it again and then confirmed it again I love looking at the life of Abram because all of a sudden our life begins to make sense if we look now I want to read to you uh out of Romans chapter four keep your place here in Genesis we'll come back but I want to look at two scriptures Romans chapter 4. and then we'll go to Hebrews 11 Romans chapter 4. verse 12. describing Abraham Romans 4 and 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk on the steps of the Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised So This Promise is not only for the Jew for the circumcised it's for the uncircumcision or the non-jew as well as long as they walk in the steps of the Faith of Our Father Abraham for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abram or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void in the promise made of non-effect because the law worketh wrath for there is no law there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Abraham is Our Father Abraham is our example of Faith amen and we see his walk of faith and you see him grow in his walk of faith and grow in his understanding that he is our father and we must walk in the footsteps of his faith let's look at Hebrews 11 together Hebrews 11 and 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went I love the scripture because the critical mind that amongst us would say well he didn't completely obey but what God saw what was in Abraham's heart he believed God and he obeyed did he get it partially wrong yes amen did it cause him trouble yes did there have to come a further separation absolutely but when Hebrews was looking at the faith of Abraham in the heart of Abraham it said when Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for inheritance obeyed it didn't matter what anybody else thought about the way Abraham did it what matters is right here what God thinks Abraham obeyed God Amen and when God needed him to go a little further God knew how to take him a little bit further but Abraham believed God and he obeyed God and he was moving by faith amen amen amen in Colossians 3 1 it says if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on thing above not on things of the earth if you go back and read Hebrews 11 read the next scripture that we didn't read Hebrews 11 let's read verse 9 by faith he's sojourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God now we know what Abraham was looking for he was looking for the Heavenly City he wasn't looking for Earthly things he wasn't lurking to established something on Earth an Earthly City an Earthly home he was looking for a Heavenly Home a city not made with hands that has foundations whose Builder and maker was gone amen and Paul tells us that if if we'd be risen with Christ we seek those things which are above amen not those things is that your affection on things above not things on the earth we're going to see this is Abraham's life and it needs to be let's go back to Genesis 13. so Hebrews 11 says Abraham when he was called out he obeyed we with uh the understanding we have will say well he obeyed but he kind of obeyed God said he obeyed he was be he was the father of Faith he was believing God and he was acting on his faith did he get a a little part wrong he got a little part wrong amen but we have a heavenly father who watches over us and he knows the destination and he will make sure we get there and we get there right amen and so he first God removes Terror from the equation amen and it wasn't it wasn't Abraham's free choice to separate from his father that was the mercy and grace of God Amen and I want to go back to that in a minute but let's read this first and we'll go to that Genesis 13 5. and lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the Herdman Abram's cattle and the Herdman of lots cattle and the Canaanite and the parasite dwelt in the land and Abram said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy Herdman for we be Brethren it's not the whole land before thee separate separate thyself I pray thee from me if that will take the left hand then I will go to the right or thou depart to the right then I will go to the left now God knows that Abraham needs a greater separation Abraham may not realize it amen but God realizes now Abraham's not walking in unbelief even though he's in partial Disobedience because he believed God he obeyed God but not fully but he's not not with a heart of unbelief but God knows there needs to be a greater separation amen and even allows Abraham to fail because when God told him to go to the land he wanted him to stay in the land of Canaan but where did they get so much substance and where did they get so rich that the land couldn't contain them they had to separate they got it down in Egypt how did they get to Egypt because a famine hit the land and Abraham did what God told him not to do he left Canaan and went down into Egypt is it wrong it was wrong was it right it worked out right because they were increased and he left Egypt exceedingly wealthy and golden and silver and servants and in cattle amen and lot had abundance too and now the land couldn't contain him what's God doing he now God is using Prosperity Amen to bring division God had allowed them to go and come back wealthy so that he can create a situation of tension amen and you think how it's so terrible that they love each other so much and now there's tension in their herdmen There's A disruption in the Harmony in the family and now Abraham's going to make a proposition to lot amen you separate from me Let there not be Strife you go one way I'll go the other way if you take the right I'll take the left and Abram's acting like a gentleman through it all amen and God is going to reward Abraham for his attitude but it's God who set up the situation because Abraham needed to more fully obey the word amen and whether he was blind or not I don't know but I know he believed God he believed God and God counted it to him for righteousness even when he was not completely obeying praise be to God I I look back on my life and say if God can do that for Abraham he's done it for me I know he's done it for me he blessed me in answering my prayers and I know that I wasn't fully lined up to the word there was things in my life that weren't right amen but I was believing God and doing what I believe to be right and God was dealing with me all along amen it's not like God just took a newborn baby Christian you come to the word and all of a sudden he's got these expectations that if you don't meet him all he won't deal with you anymore he's looking at your faith he's looking at what you believe and he's looking at what you're doing and why you're doing it I'm so thankful amen he creates situations that will cause growth and we look at these situations and sometimes these situations they cause turmoil within us and they we get upset and we get bent out of shape and we can even become offended amen we can get upset at people Abram could have easily got upset at the herdsmen of law then he could have got to say a lot for not dealing with this herd man he could have I there's all kinds of ways that Abram could react into the situation wrong amen but he just yielded to the situation and he said separate from me I pray you go one way I'll go the other let there not be Strife Among Us and Abraham was always willing to surrender this is what I want to start getting into Abraham was always willing to surrender God said leave the land he left the land when God took his father he moved on to the land without his father when the situation came up with lot and lot needed to separate he let lot go Abraham's Life we'll see we keep watching becomes a life of surrender to the will of God becomes a life of surrendering to the plan of God and and I want that to be my life I wrote down something that just struck me it said sometimes surrender is not a choice because Tara leaving was not Abraham's choice the situation that caused lot to separate it wasn't as if Abraham all of a sudden realized you know what I need a total separation I need to separate from a lot no God allowed circumstances to come to where they needed to separate so sometimes the surrender is not a premeditated choice not we see a situation and I make this Choice sometimes that's not the surrender sometimes it is you see the will of God you've got to make a choice you surrender and you make the choice but sometimes God has made the choice for you and we need to surrender to God's choice it's sometimes not a choice we make before a situation or a separation but surrender is a choice we make after it's a choice we make to yield to the circumstances not to become hurt or offended not and not to allow any bitterness in our heart see God was putting Abraham in a condition where he can bring about the promise in his life these things were for Abraham's good this was this was God fulfilling his purpose and planting Abraham but none of us want to lose a father there's there's no way that Abraham lost his father Tara and said well that's a good thing praise God I'm sure he was heartbroken I'm sure it hurt I'm sure he missed his father but he had to move on in the plan of God and bury him there inherent and he had to go on to Canaan without him and that was God's mercy to Abraham to get Abraham in a condition for the promise nobody wants to lose somebody nobody wants Strife nobody wants their herdsmen striving with their brethren right nobody wants difficult situations nobody wants fusses and fights nobody wants a hard situations the Apostle Paul did not want a thorn in his flesh that was not his choice that was the choice of God who knew what Paul needed so that he wouldn't become puffed up so they could in humility and Minister the word and God Did It for Paul and God Did It for the people that would hear Paul Paul didn't want it amen but once he realized it was the will of God he surrendered himself to it it was not angry about it was not bitter over it did not get hurt till God towards God Amen all of a sudden he began to glory in his he said now therefore glory in my infirmities for when I'm weak then am I made strong bomb began to learn to to to yield and even brother Benham he had a problem with tension all of his life amen and there towards the latter part of his ministry he said you know this tension's bothering me all of my life I get the blues I get the feeling like nobody loves me and I know that's not the truth that's just me doing that and he starts to describe the tension that he gets under and the anxiety and and the depression that he goes through and he starts to explain this amen and then he says but I got to thinking about this tension it's this tension that drove me to Christ he said what would I be without tension he said it's good for me instead of cursing the thing and getting upset about it and getting angry amen he began to realize that God was using this for me this is a blessing of God it drove me to Christ it keeps me dependent on Christ amen it keeps it keeps us in the right State of Mind many times and and I've seen so many times where people go through very difficult situations very difficult family situations difficult marriage situations a difficult work situation whatever kind of situation Church situations and you realize after talking to him for a little while they're hurt but they're hurt towards God because they said God could have prevented it God could have stopped it why could God allow it to happen why why am I going through this and why is this happening in my life and they're hurt over the situation but the more you talk to them to realize they're actually hurt at God Amen and there's a little bit of hurt they're harboring towards the almighty God because they know God could have stopped it God could have prevented it and I don't understand why God allowed it and I just want to I want to live the life of Abraham and say God allowed it for my purpose there's some benefit in it somewhere I'm not going to be hurt at God I'm not going to be offended at God I won't be a hurt or offended towards my brethren I'll just recognize that God is working something in my life and I needed another layer of separation man we have to be so careful about our attitude towards situations Abraham he in every will watch as we go but in every Junction he surrendered he surrendered he surrendered he surrendered and I want to surrender when things are happening I just want to yield to what God is allowing not accepting the devil's lie not except not living below my privileges and no way will I ever forsake or deny my Divine Healing my right to Healing that was purchased at Calvary I'll never deny amen that I have a deliverer that will deliver me from every situation but if God is allowing something and this is for His glory and for my benefit I don't want to take a wrong attitude towards people or a wrong attitude towards The God Who permitted it to happen I remember I've prayed before as a young Christian I would be sick or have a situation that was Troublesome and I said God why are you allowing this you could stop it so easy anybody else have those prayers I would even pray God one twitch of your finger I remember praying this one time one twitch of your finger be over why won't you twitch your finger I hope I'm not the only one who's prayed like that but I really heartfelt I knew it was this was a non-issue for God this was this was easy this was it could be resolved it could be over with and a fraction of a second and a moment of time but God was permitting it and I didn't understand why he was permitting it but now I look back and I thank God he permitted those things because I learned to trust him amen I learned to walk in his word I learned to have faith even when things didn't happen instantly I learned to trust in God and I learned that the word Works in every situation those things that I thought were killing me were setting me free the prophet of God says and the message shalom it says many people ask why they asked they asked sometimes they ask me why why must these things happen why why did this happen to me why did I start and this happened and had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here sometimes I've asked why why when I was just a young Minister first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his and kept trusting remember brother Venom his wife died young wife died of tuberculosis eighth month eight month old baby died of of meningitis I believe it was in the hospital he come to her crib suffering so bad her eyes were crossed and asking God and and just begging God for her healing is looking down at her begging of God he seen God at this point heal he knew God was a Healer he knew God could change the situation in a moment and he looked down at her suffering so bad her little eyes were crossed amen and he asked God to please heal her and he said like a black sheep come down he wouldn't hear my prayer he said I didn't understand it then he goes I do now and brother Brown tells his life story there's one version of the lifestyle I don't remember which one he tells it several places but there's one at the end he just starts crying and he and he's emotional he says I'm sorry I just can't go on that's all I can tell now and the man was heartbroken the man lived through tragedy through heartache amen but you never saw him get bitter towards God and you never saw him get upset towards other people amen even his mother-in-law amen his mother-in-law was the one who chastised him for wanting to go out amongst the Pentecostals and and she rebuked him and said you'll not drag my daughter out amongst that rubbish and and he hurricane hearkened under her voice and and he didn't go out amen and that's why all of these troubles came to him is because he refused to go out when God first called him out and God Amen allowed all of this stuff to happen into his life and he recognized it when he was in a boat Amen in a flood trying to rescue people and the engine wouldn't start and he's pulling and pulling and it won't start and he's heading for the falls and he said God whatever I've done I'll make it right and he realized it didn't go out and he let his mother-in-law persuade him away and finally he repented and said he'll make it right and the engine started and he went off but you never saw brother Branham get bitter towards his mother-in-law you never hear him speak evil about her amen was it her fault yeah it was partially her fault it was her influence it was her hard nature but brother Madam took the blame upon himself and then he even realized I didn't understand why but now I understand why it had to be this way it was needful that it would be this way and now there's no bitterness there's no anger there's nothing to be upset about he said I just put my hand in his and kept trusting he knows every Junction he knows the Rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use see the back side of the desert sometimes where God molds righteous men into sages and prophecy that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the in the word when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them let them come to the word and God beats it right out of them molds it right into this into the great Symphony with of his word see and then they see the word moving on God knows when the rhythm of it has got to change he's talking about a great Symphony and God is the great composer and and all of a sudden it's beating out a certain Rhythm and then there's a time for a change it's beginning to change it's changing into a new segment of the of the symphony it's it's changing the beat he said and God knows uh God God knows when the rhythm of it has got to change and in in Abram's life he knew that the rhythm of it had to change there needed to be a greater separation how am I going to be bring a greater separation amen all of a sudden I know well I'll give them so much stuff that they can't dwell together amen and allow this little Spirit of strife to come into the herdsmen and all of a sudden there's great tension around Abram tension between the herdsmen of him and the herdsmen of lot amen this is not the situation that Abram was asking for it wasn't the situation that he wanted but it was God knows that there's time for a change of Rhythm the beat has to change we've got to get to the next part of symphony and I've got to change some things here and God allow some things to happen that'll bring the change it says he knows how the Rhythm goes I don't know how it goes but he knows he knows how it goes I don't but I look at it here and say well it's just coming many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivereth them out of them all God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age and the same Rhythm making it his word that's how God moved down through history from all the way from Genesis to Revelation he has moved through history with his word that's right with the rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit vindicating his word to the elect God has known every change of every beat down through time from Genesis to Revelation amen he's allowed Wars amen he's allowed all kinds of famine and circumstances all to do what all to change the rhythm of the beat Amen to bring them into a new measure to bring him into a new part of the symphony Amen to take it amen higher to take it to a climax to do whatever he's going to do he knows it's time for a change of beef and it brings the circumstances about to bring the change and how many people were were upset about wars and how many people were upset about famines and how many people were upset about the circumstances in all these circumstances was God changing the rhythm of the beat for his great plan for his great Symphony but what God does on a grand scale he does in our lives do what God does Amen on a global scale he does for us and the microcosm of our life he knows when there needs to be a change amen and you say why did the plant shut down why did I lose my job amen why did all of this happen amen there's a changing of a beat he knows the Rhythm that you're moving to and he knows when it's time for a change let him bring the change Abraham was learning to surrender to the changes not to fight but to surrender brother bam said in the message expectation God told him to separate himself from all of his Kindred and God never did bless him anymore till he obeyed him fully as long as his father hung along while the old fella caused trouble and then he got with lot and then lot caused trouble and until he separated himself and got away from all the unbelief shook away from him then God came down and talked to him and something happened he then the prophet goes on to say in Abraham's Covenant confirmed now we find out that God told him to separate himself last night and away from his Kindred away from his people but Abraham like an ordinary man now God never run him out back to his homeland for doing it right think about that God told him to completely separate and he didn't completely separate first he went along with Dad God took Dad went along with lot and until God created the circumstance where lot would separate amen he was impartial Disobedience to the word but we know Abraham believed God and that's why he went and so now God it says because he was in that condition God didn't run him back to his homeland and give up on Abraham and send him back to where he came from he chose Abraham he's going to work with Abraham he's got a he's got a definite purpose in Abraham's life so what's he going to do he's going to start changing the rhythm of the music he never run him on back to his homeland for doing it but Abraham never did get blessed of God until he separated himself from all of his people he took his father along he took some more along took his nephew and the old fella always was in the way until finally God called him off the scene and then Lotus nephew backslid and went down into Sodom and then when he got separated from him then God began to tell him about the blessing what he was going to bless him I like that God was not hurting Abraham God wanted to separate him out because he had something else he wanted to tell him he had another part of the plan he wanted to show him there was going to come another confirmation of his promise and his relationship with Abraham was going to go deeper amen but he needed him separated to himself and what looked like harm was the one of the greatest things that ever happened to him and brother remember says and the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things as your God trying to put punishment upon you It Isn't So no sir it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you're tied to this earth by the care Earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for wherever your treasure is there you are also that's right your heart is where your Treasures are that's why Abraham was looking for a city he wasn't looking for a place to establish a city he was looking for the city of God he became Heavenly minded and the Earthly things didn't have a pull on him and now if we're in Christ then we look to things that are above not things that are on the Earth if we lose temporal things let them go if if things on the earth don't work out Let It Go there's many things that have been taken from us and I'm thankful for it amen there's many ideas that have been Stripped Away From Me Hobbies friendships uh jobs careers there's many things that I have surrendered or have been taken out of my hands amen and now I look back and say it was every bit the grace of God I couldn't stay in that relationship and grow the way he wanted me to grow I couldn't stay in that fellowship and grow the way you wanted me to grow I couldn't stay in that career and grow the way he wanted me to grow so God would change the circumstances he would change the rhythm of the beat in my life amen and then you can become bitter over what you lost I had so much going for me than this event transpired and now I've lost my savings I've lost my retirement I've lost my good career amen when it comes to God Amen you've lost nothing because your treasure is in heaven amen not on Earth there is no losing to a child of God what there is is surrendering and these fiery afflictions are there to burn the bonds off of us that are tying us down and keeping us EarthBound foreign if you lose you haven't lost if you're believing God and following after him with all your heart and he allows something to happen amen just take it as God's and God's Great purpose amen something else will work out it always does let's look at Mark chapter 10 keep your place in Genesis but let's look together in Mark chapter 10. Mark 10 and 28. foreign then Peter began to sand him low we have left all and have followed thee and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that had left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now and this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life you can't lose following God you can't lose surrendering to him can temporal Earthly Things Fall Away they can sometimes God Amen when we're missing something when we're blind to something believing God following him but blind to something God has ways of making things go away God God can shut down your place of business and now you've got to go look for another job God can create situations that you know you have to separate from or God can bring to your light a situation and ask you to surrender it he can do all of these he can do like he did with Tara just take him away he can do like he did with lot create the circumstance where where you know you can't go on this way or he can do like he's done in other places with Abraham he can ask him to surrender and and watch Abraham of his own choice surrender God has done this for me on a couple of occasions where I've had to give up uh there was one a job that I I absolutely love the job that I enjoyed very very much but it kept me away from home it kept me far away the the company I worked for was based out of Columbus and I was spending nights away and I was doing some training work that I loved on industrial equipment and I was getting more involved with that working for corporate and I could really see a future and I really really loved it but I was also working with the youth at the same time and it was becoming hard to have youth meetings and it was becoming hard on my young family me being away and one day it was it was just it was just eating at me I was gone from home a lot and I had all these responsibilities and and I went into a hotel and this hotel was one I stayed in every time I was down there and I checked in and and I knew what section of Hotel I liked and I knew what backside topped you know and I told him and the woman typed it up she's been in my name she goes you've stayed here more this year than anybody else and I said oh boy this is not what I want in life and I I was already dealing with me on that and when that happened I realized I've got to give this up and I went in and I turned in my two week notice and I found a job and I took a ten thousand dollar a year cut and pay and we were a single income family raising several little children but I knew it was what God was asking me to do I knew it was what God wanted and there was some I can't explain it but there was some Freedom inside of me when I went opposite to laodicea when I knew what God was asking and when I made the decision to surrender to him there was something that energized my soul and I ended up so happy to make that choice because I knew it was the right choice for the right reasons it was for my family and it was so I could help with the youth and minister to them and I I ended up so blessed and I looked back and there are zero regrets whatsoever for giving that up none whatsoever I didn't lose anything because God was wanting to take me to a higher level amen the corporate world would have taken me One Direction but God was wanting to take me another Direction I didn't know it then but God wanted me to stand here now and God wanted me to pastor at church I had no idea of that then I just thought I was going to help out a little bit in the youth and my family needed me I thought the decision then was for the circumstances I was looking at then but I didn't realize the decision then was for circumstances that was coming down the road God knows the Rhythm God knows the sheet music for your life and he knows exactly what it's going to take and he knows the Junctions of time and he knows how to change the beat and he knows how to get a a little lady standing behind a desk to say the right word to trigger something in your heart God knows the Junctions amen and God I didn't have to do that I could have stayed where I was at and managed everything and made it work but I knew in my heart what God wanted and I surrendered and it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me and I'm standing here now because God moved me down that road he knows the Junctions he knows the change of time amen you could say where would you have been I could have maybe this and could have maybe that and you know so many years in the company and this and pay and benefits and blah blah blah and I say I don't care I didn't lose anything my treasures are in heaven amen they're secure rust does not defile moth does not eat nothing can touch where my treasures are these things in life are temporal we need to make sure we keep them temporal and God knows how to change the Junctions he knows how to beat out the Rhythm and he knows how to create circumstances where you know that you it's it it won't go anymore this doesn't work anymore I've got to change let's look at verse 14 now back in Genesis 13. Genesis 13. in verse 14. and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now nine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou sees to thee will I give it into thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land and length of it in the breath of it for I will give it unto thee this is another confirmation in a deeper revelation of the Covenant God has made with Abraham and the promise but it said in the Lord said verse 14 the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him God knew there needed to be a change a junction a change in the Rhythm and the beat and as soon as there was here he come with a greater portion of himself a greater revelation of his purpose in Abraham's life amen that God Amen had to take him through the junction and through the junction he came in contact with a greater measure of the promise there's so many Junctions in life don't be afraid of them just beyond them may be a greater a greater revelation of Christ in our life there was as I was standing through this there was a side thought that hit me with impact and I want to read it to you verse 14 or I'm sorry Chapter 14 verse 14. let's jump to the next chapter and I want to just take a little diversion for just a minute and get right back but it'll all play in to the same thought and when Abram heard this is Chapter 14 verse 14 when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them into Dan we know that Sodom and Gomorrah in the city's roundabout were taken captive by an alliance of of kings and they and lot was in the mix and when Abraham heard it he grabbed his soldiers and went for it and he divided himself against them and and his servant by night and smote them and pursued them unto hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and his women also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheddar LaMore and of the kings that were with him in the valley of Sheva which is the King's Deo in Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all I think this is so striking because God wanted Abraham separated from lot but God never intended for Abram to turn his back on lot to despise lot or disown lot I think this is absolutely amazing he had to separate from lot amen and God saw to it that there was a separation and after he separated he reconfirmed the promise and gave more details amen but but when when lot his brother got into trouble Abraham went to rescue him and when he went to rescue him when he came back who does he meet none other but Melchizedek Melchizedek doesn't show up in any other time he shows up at the time that he comes back from delivering his brother the one he has to be separated from but yet God honored what Abram did to deliver his brother lot and when he come back he served in communion I think this is absolutely so telling because there has to be separation from unbelief but that doesn't mean there's no more care or concern for people we have to separate from and and God even rewards Abraham by coming in his theophany as Melchizedek and feeding him bread and wine after the victory here's what the prophet of God says in Jehovah Jireh and notice what a type we find here after the battle is over after the real believer has fought the enemy broke down the lines and tried to capture his brother the the real Seed of Abraham bringing back that Wayward brother Melchizedek came out and served wine and bread communion giving communion after the battle was over served the communion to them after the battle what was he doing going after a wayward brother one that he has to be separate from because of unbelief but he's not supposed to quit loving him in the time of trouble he went to rescue him when God was coming down and he was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and he allowed Abraham to know and he told him Abraham then began to intercede for lot he began to intercede for Sodom and said would the righteous judge of all the Earth would he destroy it if there's righteous in the Earth or righteous in the city if there's 50 if there's 45 there's 40 if there's 30 all the way down to 10. here Abraham is interceding on behalf of Sodom because lot's down there and God is not ever it it never appears that God is ever upset at Abraham for loving lot I don't see in this I don't see where he ever rebuked him for loving life I don't think he ever rebuked him for rescuing a lot and he didn't rebuke him for interceding for Lots act it looks to me like he rewarded him on every account because when he come back from the rescue he met milk as a dick when when it go when we follow the story of lot down in Sodom and the angels come to him they it says they took them by the hand they took lot when lot delayed to leave they took law and his wife and his daughters by the hand and they rushed them out of the city and when God was going to destroy Sodom he remembered Abraham he remembered lot for Abraham's sake you remembered Abraham and rescued lot God even honored Abraham's love for lot do we have to separate from unbelief absolutely we have to separate from unbelief but it doesn't mean that God doesn't want us to love people pray for them rescue them when they're in need and intercede on their behalf I think God likes it from what I can see in Abraham's life you never see God chasing him or get angry with him but God remembers him in his prayer and rescues lot because he remembered Abraham never said he rescued a lot of his own Merit he rescued lot because he remembered Abraham and God has separated us many of us are separated from family members it may not be that we never speak to him but we're just not in Fellowship because there's the word has brought us separation the word has brought a separation sometimes and where we're used to fellowship and where we used to go to church in the denominational church we attended there's been a separation there needed to be a separation many times God calls for a separation but it never means that that separation takes away love could never be what Abraham was Lot was a penny Abraham was a silver dollar lot could never be what Abraham was amen but Abraham never rejected lot he just separated from him so I think it's still we have to be careful in our attitudes in these things and then let's keep reading let's go to verse 21 now Chapter 14 verse 21. and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abram said unto the king of Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latched and that I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abram rich so that when they come back with the spoils of the War the King of Sodom and says you can take it all just give me the people but he had already made a promise to God that he wouldn't take it because he didn't want any man to make him Rich he wanted God to get all the glory and the victory for it all he didn't want anybody the wrong idea he wasn't bound to temporal Earthly things he wasn't hungry for more all he wanted was what God gave him amen he didn't want anything else and when he turned that down amen because of what he made a promise that he made to God look at verse 1 of chapter 15. after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward God when when Abraham would surrender God would come on the scene Abraham would surrender God would come on the scene he lived a life learning to surrender let's go to Genesis 17. I want to look at just a couple more places Genesis 17 and verse 15. and God said unto Abraham ask for Sarai thy wife Thou shalt not call her Sarai but Sarah shall her name be and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her the neighborhood fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born into him that is a hundred years old just Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seat after him he Abraham loved Ishmael is there any doubt in your mind that Abraham loved Ishmael his son and when God gave a promise of the son his promised seed coming through Sarah he he mentions Ishmael all that Ishmael could live before thee and he says no it's going to be the child from Sarah but I've heard you and I'll take care of Ishmael but he had a love in his heart for for his son let's go over to chapter 21 now we picked this up after the birth of Isaac and Isaac was when he was weaned Abraham had a feast and and at the feast Sarah saw the the Ishmael mocking in verse verse 9 of chapter 21 says and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne unto Abraham mocking wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son even with Isaac and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son and God said unto Abram let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the Bond woman and all that Sarah has said unto thee hearkened into her voice for an Isaac shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it into haggar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba when I look at this I thought to myself when I read this I thought that I had been tested but I've never been tested like this he loved Ishmael we know the story re-read the story re-read the end of it and we go back later but Ishmael wasn't the one but but in Abraham's life he had had about four at this point about 14 years with Ishmael he's about a 13 or 14 year old boy and he loves him and they spent time together and he's raised him as his son amen and all of a sudden now God is calling for another separation amen because the seed is going to be in Isaac and now the bond one the Bond woman son must be put away and God speaks the the the through Sarah through strives through contention through through Abraham's wife now there's another situation again attention in the home and now she sees this that this Ishmael mocking her son she goes to Abraham and there's more trouble in the home and he says and he's grieved over this he says send away the Bond woman and her son for the Bond woman son shall not be Heir with my son and and Abraham's grieved and God comes to him and says don't be grieved listen to her listen to her and I'll make a nation out of him and the next morning he gets up and gets bread and gets water and he puts it on at our shoulder and he sends away his 14 year old son into the wilderness away from me I don't know that any of us have ever been tested to this level but by the time Abraham comes to this spot he's learned to surrender to God he has learned to give in What God Says is best and though he's he wants Ishmael to serve God he wants things to work out when God said send him away he sent him away and God had promised that he would watch over and make a nation out of him and God did exactly what he promised to Abraham even when they went and the water run out in the bottle and they were in the wilderness and they were going to die and Ishmael was going to die and haggar went over a bow shot from him because she couldn't watch him die God's promised to Abraham was still in effect amen because as the boy was laying there dying he whispered a prayer and the angel of the Lord came to haggar and and said I've heard I've heard the lad and he opened her eyes and she saw a well of water because God said he would take care of Ishmael and that had to be good enough for Abraham he couldn't figure it out he couldn't understand it he didn't know how it all worked out but the rhythm of the symphony was changing again Isaac was on the scene now and the promised son was Isaac Ishmael had to go but there's a changing of the Rhythm and Abraham didn't understand it but he knew by now that what God says is true God will take care of it all amen and he could take a loaf of bread and a bottle of water and put it on the the the Bond woman and the son that he loved so much and send them out knowing if God said he's going to take care of him God's going to take care of him and God proved his word once again you could try to reason and think it out figure out another way make another preparation he sent him off amen with bread and water and God took him from there and raised him up to be a great nation we can trust the word of God it doesn't it's not reasonable sometimes it doesn't make sense sometimes to our reasoning we don't know how it would work out but the point is not to figure out how it will work out before we surrender but to surrender and watch it work out hey brother Ben said in perfect strength by Perfect weakness said and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me now that's hard I know because we're always wanting to put our part in something that we know you know that we want to do it we say well I just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong and God will never use that effort Abraham just surrendered to what God asked him to do and he sent away Ishmael and the Bond woman and God took care of it then God's going to bring him to another test which we all so familiar with let's turn to chapter 22 and read the test of Abraham with Isaac one thing I want to mention is when God started when God called Abram and led him away from his home God didn't start with this test God started him out by just leaving his Brethren leaving his Kindred and leaving his homeland and even in that he didn't do it completely right but God dealt with him along the way and God confirmed his Covenant with him in God every step Abraham took God blessed him he took another step God blessed him he took another step God blessed him and all the way God was working on his will and working on his word but when Abraham as Abraham grows and matures his level of surrender comes to a level of perfection where he learns to surrender to the will of God Amen If Abraham could go back to the land of UR to the chaldeas after he gained all this understanding the way he left would have been much different he wouldn't have taken father along he wouldn't have taken a lot along amen but he was he was just beginning his journey with the Lord he was just beginning this walk of Faith amen and he believed God but in his immaturity he didn't realize and understand what it means to really surrender to the will of God but God trains Abraham through all these circumstances and all these Junctions of life and you wonder what is my life all about your life is about the same thing Abraham's life was about the Junctions that you've had in your life the transitions that you've had if you've been on this life any number of decades then you've seen God change you move views change circumstances change the rhythm of the beat in your life if I could go back 20 years is anybody if any of you could go back when you first started serving the lord would you do things differently would you surrender more quickly would you obey better absolutely amen but God dealt with us where we were what God was looking for was Faith amen do you believe my word are you moving in a pure heart with pure motives in my word he'll take care of everything else he knows the Junctions he knows how to train us he knows how to get us where we want to be but listen friends there's more for us to gain there's a greater surrender that needs to come into the heart of his bride and he knows the Junctions he knows the changing of time and he knows what it's going to take to get a surrender out of you and I we look back and we see that was good for me and that was good for me and I learned so much there I learned so much here hey guess what you're still learning and what's going on today and what will happen tomorrow and what's going to happen next week is part of the same sheet music and the conductor knows the changing of the Rhythm I said this before I want to get to the place where I don't lose my mind every time something goes wrong God help me help me not help me not to slip into the carnal when it's just time for a changing in the music when God wants to bring a separation or a greater Revelation or or build another bit of character in my life I don't want to lose my mind and I don't want to act like everything's out of control nothing is ever out of control no matter how much out of control it feels to you nothing is nothing is going the wrong direction everything is going God's direction if you're a child of God His Eye Is on you and he's moving you in the right direction don't get hurt towards the circumstances don't get bitter don't say I mean don't even take the attitude well God God took away this like it's some negative thing we were all so happy together and God broke up our fellowship listen if anything ever happened to you it was for you everything that happened to Abraham was for Abraham and we have to realize that if I believe that I'm a predestinated seed of God I'm a Child of God everything that happens to me is for me and God is the great conductor and he's he's wrote the sheet music of my life and I may not exactly know what's coming I may think it's going one way but he's got another way for it to go all together when it comes time to to make the junction and I see it turn I want to say God I surrender to you have your way in me when he asked something as hard as send Ishmael away can you imagine your 14 year old boy sending him away but God had brought him from one Junction to another to another until he could do what God told him to do let's look here at Genesis 22 verse 1. and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Abraham and he he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest I love that the scripture put this put this in here whom now lovest and get thee unto the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of I love how real the prophet makes the Bible I love for years growing up as a child I read the Bible and when I read the Bible I was very sterile towards the Bible these are things that happened long ago to people I don't know it was very sterile there was no feeling there was no emotion there was no entering into the story but the prophet of God as a way of dramatizing something till you can enter right in and begin to feel the feelings and I love that the Bible said take thy son thine only son whom thou lovest that Abraham loved this boy and what God was going to ask him to do was going to be in such a violation of that affection that the scripture says to take thy son whom thou loveest in verse 3 it says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him Isaac's son enclaved the wood for a burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place which God had told him what I absolutely love about this scripture is Abram Abraham does not ask God if there's another way he does not pray he does not reason he does not come up with a plan he wakes up early in the morning and he starts doing exactly what God told him to do this is why Abraham is the father of faith he had learned to believe God he had learned to obey God he learned to trust in the Lord and we are children of Abraham I want to learn to trust in the Lord to this level that no matter what he asked or what the word says I will willingly surrender to it knowing that it will work out perfectly fine this is where Abraham had got to Abraham did not believe that he was going to kill his son and his son was going to remain dead Abraham believed he was going to kill his son but he believed God would raise him up because he already had a promise and by now he had learned that God's word doesn't change he had already tried to bring it to pass by his own effort through the Bond woman and he had tried this and he had tried that but by the time he's come to this part in his life he has learned that the word of word of God works under every circumstance and he knows that God said and Isaac shall thy seed be called and he knew that that was the only way that it could be and if God wanted Isaac dead then God was going to have to raise him back because God had already said in Isaac shall thy seed be called this was Abraham in perfect faith and perfect surrender and a perfect obedience prophet of God says in Jehovah Jireh and then one day God wanted to make it real plain to the people in Phoenix so how was he going to do it he was going to give this Abraham a double test so he said Abraham take thine son thine only son and take him to a certain Mountain where I'm going to show you in their sacrifice him now what if Abraham would have took the second thought how am I going to be the father of Nations when the when where here I am this old and you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that I have that you'll keep your word and make me a father of Nations and God loves to test his people every child that comes to God must be tested child trained no exceptions everyone and maybe tonight you're you're you're sick maybe tonight that you're sick just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged God's on the throne he knows all things if you're truly born of the spirit of God everything's working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep that word he's kept it now for oh thousands of years to every believer would you be any exception no sir we're no exception now watch him now God keeps his word God keeps his children God knows what he's doing if God has asked you for a greater separation give him a greater separation if he has asked you for more sincerity give him more sincerity if he's asked you to give up a job give it up if he's asked you to give up uh something a hobby whatever if he's asking and moving your heart surrender to him there's Junctions in time there's things as we grow and as we move God's got to bring us into another phase another step another a work and he brings these Junctions of time in these transition times amen it's not time to reason it's not time to figure out it's time just to submit and say God if that's what you want that's what I'll do verse 5. and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you you know what I I absolutely love this story we've been through it we all know it it's super familiar but every time I read it I get excited because Abraham didn't have to go through a bunch of emotion and a bunch of show he didn't he'd have to do anything to prove his faith he just did what God told him to do and he knew it was going to work out and he told he he told the two servants that are with him he didn't have to explain anything all he said is we're going to go Yonder in worship and the lad and I will come back how did he know because the promise that God gave you did he know what was going to happen no he didn't know it was going to happen did he have his own idea he probably had his own idea according to the scripture but it didn't happen according to his own idea but one thing he knew is that promise that he gave me is sure it is true you can say I know God's dropped it in my heart that by his stripes I am healed this sickness won't take me out amen and you don't know if he's going to use surgery if he's going to use medicine if he's going to do something Supernatural you don't know what's going to happen when you go to that mountain and you come back but you know that there's a Divine promise and if God is quickened into your heart that it's not this time then you can say I'm going to go through whatever I'm going to go through and I'm going to come back amen and I'm going to be healed in the name of Jesus Christ I don't know how I don't know why but God dropped it in my heart that this isn't my time to go I'm going to get through this what will happen I don't know I'm just going to walk I'm going to walk and I'm going to go as he leads and and if he's going to if he's going to take me a third through a surgery say God this is how you're going to do it if he's going to take you amen through medicine God this is how you're going to do it if none of it works you say oh God this is how you're going to do it you're going to show that none of it works because you're going to heal me steal not the time to get excited it's time just to press on and believe the word Hebrews 11 17 says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure Abraham believed that God could even raise him from the dead Abraham had every intention of doing what God asked him to do he took the knife he took the fire he claimed the wood for the sacrifice he had every intention of fully obeying God's word but in his heart he knew that God could raise him up because he received him as one from the dead God could raise him easily from the dead he didn't know how it was going to happen but one thing he knew is he was going to do what God Said do but believe that when God made the promise that in Isaac thy seed shall be called that that word cannot change foreign if God said he's going to have a bride without Sparta Rico he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle and if he come through a prophetic if you come as a son of man through a son of man this time and told us that that you were Washed by the washing of the water of the word and what we have now is a pure word for washing then I can believe with all of my heart that this message is going to make me fit that scripture and I'm going to be perfect amen by what by a perfect word is going to build me perfect faith and God is going to have perfect obedience how are you going to do it brother Ted I don't know I failed a thousand times before I may fail another thousand times but I know by the washing of the water of the word that we've been given he will have a bride without spotter wrinkle and I know I am part of that bride how are you going to get there I don't know he's going to show me he's going to teach me I don't know what it's going to look like I don't know all the steps that we're going to go through but I know the destination I know what he's called for he's called for a Perfect Bride standing there in the Splendor of him and I know I will be that how he knows the Junctions and he's training me just like he trained Abraham amen this bride is coming to perfect faith and a perfect word you believe that she'll be standing there in his glory perfect faith and a perfect word and shall be in perfect submission say we're far from it I don't know how far we are but when Abraham started it looked like he was far from it but by the time he got to the end of his journey he was there God led him through Junction after Junction after Junction until he can say take thy son and only son whom thou lovest and take him to the mountain I show you and there slay him and what Abraham will do is wake up in the morning and cleave the wood and saddle the ass and get the fire and grab his knife and take his son and go to the mountain this is what God is doing to you and I this is where God is bringing us to where we'll have the faith of Abraham and if the word says do this we'll do it if the word calls for this we'll do it I don't know how it will work but it will work I don't know I it looks like it'll have bad consequences but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God will work it for good again in Jehovah Jireh says how are you going to do it Abraham explain to me if you've got the knife and the sheath here and the vision from God telling you to go kill that boy how are you going to how how are you two going to return back but God but Abraham believed God and he didn't take no second thought the only thing he knowed God gave the promise and if Abraham had received Isaac as one from the dead he knew that God would raise him up from the dead again and if you being dead and sin and trespasses without any nature to serve God at all and God by election called you and gave you his Spirit without you making any choice he says nobody can come to me unless the father first draws him that's not your choice that's his choice he chose to draw you before you were drawn and you would have never come if he didn't draw you it wasn't your choice it was his choice and if God by election called you and gave you a spirit without you making any choice no man can come to me except my father draws him first and if God did that through you without you being able to make a choice how much more will he heal you and keep you when you've got a choice by a sworn effort of his what a marvelous thing how that God promised Abraham didn't take the second thought he said well God's been good he kept his promise I don't know how he's going to do it but he will do it we are in training you're in training how many junctions have you had in your life how many terms how how many of you never imagined you would be where you are now never dreamed that you would be here but what was it Junctions changes in the rhythm of the beat and it moved and what what were you learning all through it all to surrender to the will of God to give in to him that he knows best he can read the sheet music and he knows exactly what's going to happen we didn't plan on being here we didn't plan on being like this but God knew what he was bringing us to and I don't know for you but I can say for me I'm thankful for every hard thing I've ever went through I'm thankful for every seemingly negative thing that happened in my life because it all has brought me to the place I'm at now I've I've had hard things happen in life I've had difficult situations we've had loss and we've had we've had rejection we've had all kinds of difficulties some of it were things that happened to me some of it were brought on by my own disobedience but now I stand thankful for everything that's ever happened amen every negative thing that brought negative consequences because it's moved me into a greater faith in God a greater understanding of his word and I believe more now than I've ever believed in my life and I see more now than I've ever seen in my life and I've got a heart that wants to give him more than I've ever wanted in my life and what brought us here training just like he did Abraham he's doing to Abraham's seed your life is training you're in training now you'll be in training tomorrow you'll be in training next week amen and let that training let the junction bring you to another level in the sheet music in perfect Faith the prophet says when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith and a perfect word like Jesus did the word of God is perfect we're to have perfect faith in his perfect word and resist Satan not by yelling at him not by a bunch of actions but by just believing God's word resist the lies of the devil how do you drive him out believe the word resist everything contrary to the word resist everything that would move you contrary to the word resist it and that's how you resist the devil let's go to Genesis let's read Genesis 22 9 now and they came to the place which God had told him of neighborhood build an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the light neither do thou do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me God was testing Abraham and God wanted him to pass the test when he saw that he fully obeyed and withheld nothing God stopped him and we know he gave him a substitute and it's all symbolic but I want to go over to verse 15. it says then the angel of the Lord called him to Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and he said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice once again Abraham obeys God brings another Revelation and another confirmation after The Obedience after the surrender God comes on the scene and he says I have sworn by myself this is an unconditional Covenant that I've put my reputation on the line I've sworn by my own person that I will bless you in the and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy so for the Seed of Abraham God promised and swore by himself that there'll be a Perpetual victory over the enemy's Gates and guess what you and I are still benefactors of that promise because we are Seed of Abraham by being in Christ and we are now possessors of the gates of our enemies why because God swore it by himself because Abraham obeyed him because Abraham had perfect faith and because Abraham had perfect submission because Abraham believed God God made a promise and swore by him own self that the Seed of Abraham shall possess the gate to their enemy and here you and I are and we should thank Abraham over and over that he obeyed God because we're the benefactors of that obedience God has made a promise to us because he had some man in his hand that would surrender all to God almighty what is it we're learning to surrender everything what is it the bride needs a greater surrender in Jehovah Jireh the prophet says a woman it's her nature of a woman to surrender to a man and it's the nature of the church to surrender to Christ surrender to his will Just Surrender she has no thinking of her own she takes his word not somebody else's if Eve would have done that we'd have never had to die but she listened to reasonings but the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word and only believes God's word that's the real the restored bride it should be the nature of the true church just to surrender to him and not to question and not to become bitter and not to become angry and not to get upset amen at all the seemingly negative things but it's so much better just to say God knows the sheet music's already been written we've come to another Junction you know we we ask why president many people and the quote I read many people have asked me why and the message Shalom many people ask me why why did this have to happen he goes I've asked myself why why did this have to happen why was it like this why when I was a young Minister God took my wife right out from under me took my baby right from under my heart because I didn't know then but I know now you know he could have gotten bitter he could have been upset you could have been angry but he realized that it was all his Perfection God molding him for the work that he had to do you see Paul is not bitter Abraham's not bitter neither should the Bride of Jesus Christ be bitter over any situation that has ever happened in our lives if you're struggling with offenses bitterness and you may not even realize it but you may be hurt towards God for allowing a horrible situation or allowing a bad situation to continue I would encourage you to repent and say God I'm sorry I'm sorry but I realized just as true as you were to Abraham you're that true to me and just as much as you were in favor of Abraham through every Junction and every difficult situation that's what you're doing in my life for I'm one of your children and I'm sorry for being offended and I'm sorry for harboring bitterness and I'm sorry Lord for having a poor attitude and I'm sorry for blaming you nobody ever wants to do that but I tell you if you do that it'll set you free he's saying God I'm sorry I've been blaming you for my troubles I'm sorry I've been offended at you for allowing tragedy in my life and allowing travesties all around me but listen it's the junction of our life it's the molding of our character it's the shaping of Our Lives it is it is in the sheet music or else God wouldn't allow it what what he's going to do and what he intends and the purpose and what will happen next none of us know but I know one thing his promise is true he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle she will be in perfect Faith walking in Perfect Harmony to her word what's it going to take probably more of the same training teaching more word training teaching more word training teaching greater Revelation training teaching greater revelation is that what your life has been like that's what my life's been like don't expect it to stop get more training teaching greater Revelation training teaching greater revelation and understand that God's ways are perfect in the choosing of a bride like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word say God that's what I want I'm not what I ought to be I'm not even what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be and if God can move us along in the Junctions of time and creating us a desire to surrender if he's done that in the past he's still able to do it and I thank God that he knows the sheet music and he knows the junction and it begins to be and and brother bear starts talking about that he's talking about the Symphony of Peter and the Wolf and he's talking about how you can feel the change coming there's an intensity to the beat there's something coming and you can feel the change coming then all of a sudden next thing you know it switches over and it's to another phase of the symphony many times in our lives you can feel that pressure mounting there's a situation that's that's that's closing in and you can feel the beat of the drums don't get nervous a junction just keep walking keep surrendering God will bring you to another phase of the song of your life God is good in all of his ways and he can be trusted what I want more than anything is I want at the end of my life I want I want to grow to that place where Abraham was where God says and I do where God says move and I move and God says go and I go and God says stop and I stop I want so bad to get to that place where God says and I do until I can look on the things that are above not the things on the earth that I'm willing to separate from every Earthly thing amen and lay my treasures in heaven where they cannot be lost and they cannot be corrupted and to where that becomes the central focus of my life that's where I want to grow to I've seen what God done and I see what this word is doing and I can see that's the destination say thank you God let me live like Abraham was able to live man let's all stand musicians if you come and Blake if you'll come I certainly don't want to go back to what I was a handful of years ago I don't want to go back to that kind of faith that kind of obedience I I want to and I and I tell you this I don't want to stay where I'm at I'm not satisfied or content with where I'm at but I want to keep growing the way Abraham growed and I want to keep moving and I know God's been so merciful to me God's been so kind to me when I was wrong he still took care of me when I had things that shouldn't have been there he still loved me and he still cared for me and he still brought me through and I know he's not going to abandon me now and I'm just going to stay with him and yield to him all that I know to do and he's going to keep bringing me through and I believe with all my heart the bride is coming to this perfect faith where she'll stand on the word if the whole world turns against her she'll stand on the word not knowing what will happen next it may look like everything we thought was going to happen goes completely opposite to what we thought but that's no time to change from the word God will still do what he promised to do for you and I am man let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus I thank you Father I thank you God that you gave a life like Abraham's God that you called him chose him you molded him and shaped him you brought him through the Junctions of his own Symphony we can read it oh Lord on the pages of the Bible that you by your grace have given to us and it stands as an example to us of what you're doing in our lives God our life is not a mystery anymore you've taken the seals off of your word you've peeled back the layers of this book so that we can see that our lives are not a mystery our lives are laying right here in the word what you've done for others you're doing for us Lord I pray that you'd give us a greater surrender in our hearts Lord forgive me forgive me Lord for my wrong thoughts and ideas and attitudes and actions and take me from where I am through every Junction that you have for me Lord let me believe in a greater way than I've ever believed settle in my heart like never before the Perfection of your will and word may I walk with my hand and yours trusting that all things work together for good Lord I want to be pleasing to you I want to have a faith that pleases you I want to walk and talk in a way that brings honor to your name I I want you to be pleased with me like you were with Abraham when he offered up Isaac oh whatever is holding me back take it out of my life whatever Lord is is hindering me take it away from me Lord I might serve you with a free heart with a free will to give all my life to you bless this congregation bless your people God and all that we say and do what's done for you is the only thing that matters help us Lord to stay in your perfect will trusting in you and loving you through every Junction just want to say I Trust You Lord I trust you God you're so good to us take us as we leave from here move in us and through us Lord shine the light through these vessels to this dark world and may some find their way to you oh that's our great desire May our life reflect your light and may we do nothing to hinder what you're trying to do in this day and Jesus Christ's name we
