[0:00] it seems like it's so much better than
[0:02] it was five years ago it's so much
[0:04] tastier so much more satisfying full of
[0:06] flavor you you come to the service and
[0:08] feed on the word and it's like this is
[0:10] amazing this is unbelievable amen but
[0:13] that's what you said four years ago
[0:14] that's why you said six years ago that
[0:16] this is the best how can it get any
[0:18] better it's the same Jesus Christ
[0:21] yesterday today and forever but the
[0:23] portion for your day is the tastiest you
[0:26] can ever eat today
[0:28] you can't stomach tomorrow's yet you got
[0:31] to grow up for that yesterday's you've
[0:33] already grown fast but today's portion
[0:35] is the portion that tastes the best
[0:38] and I trust if time continues and we're
[0:40] here 10 years from now we'll be saying
[0:42] my goodness I can't believe this is the
[0:45] best message I've ever heard I can't
[0:47] believe where is that man getting this
[0:49] stuff
[0:50] [Applause]
[0:52] amen where is he getting it out of the
[0:54] barrel that was stored up in the 1960s
[0:57] amen because it was put away for a
[1:00] future need
[1:02] and and I believe there was enough
[1:04] stored up to carry us all the way
[1:07] through
[1:10] and every time we go to the storehouse
[1:14] and crack open another mason jar
[1:19] somehow the longer it sits undiscovered
[1:22] the better it tastes
[1:27] amen
[1:31] the wine gets better with age
[1:35] and this this little woman and a boy he
[1:38] was growing noticeably he was growing
[1:42] and the meal that she was eating listen
[1:44] she was going to the same barrel and
[1:47] pulling out the same scoop and using the
[1:50] same oil and it was the right food for
[1:53] the pastor
[1:55] for the woman
[1:56] and for the boy
[2:00] she didn't fix a separate meal for the
[2:02] leader of the church had to eat a
[2:04] special diet and the woman in the house
[2:06] the widow woman or the little boy they
[2:08] didn't need special food they all ate
[2:10] the same Christ for their day
[2:13] amen the teenagers don't need a
[2:15] different watered-down message they need
[2:18] the same message that feeds Mom and Dad
[2:20] the same one that feeds the pastor feeds
[2:22] the mother in The Home feeds the father
[2:24] in The Home feeds the teenage boy it's
[2:27] the same Christ for our day that every
[2:29] one of us need
[2:30] [Music]
[2:33] we don't need a program we don't need to
[2:35] water it down we don't need to change it
[2:36] we just need to preach it in the
[2:37] fullness of its power
[2:39] if you've got a child you may not fix
[2:41] them as big a cake
[2:43] but they're going to eat the same food
[2:45] amen
[2:47] praise be to God
[2:49] amen this is what God's been given us to
[2:52] overcome by this is what God's been
[2:54] given us Amen to rise above amen the
[2:57] false doctrines of this world Amen we
[2:59] don't need to change it we don't need to
[3:00] alter it we don't need to keep it from
[3:02] the kids we need to feed them the same
[3:04] thing we're eating
