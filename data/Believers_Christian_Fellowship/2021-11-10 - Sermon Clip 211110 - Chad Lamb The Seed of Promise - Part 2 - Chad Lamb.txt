========================================

and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me he did not stop abimelech from sinning against sarah that's not why he came down to him in a dream that's not why he smote them with curses and closed their wounds because that had already taken place at this time he had he had come down to speak to him in a dream abimelech was not what abraham was abraham was the seed line abimelech was not but abimelech was righteous because he wasn't doing this intentionally and because abimelech was righteous god came to him and said you're but a dead man you're under a curse the wounds are already shut up in your nation and you're going to die because you've taken a man's wife and he says you know the integrity of my heart he told me he lied to me and god says i know the integrity of your heart that's why i kept you from sinning against me what was he doing he was protecting his word because isaac had to come from sarah and abraham amen and so abhimalek didn't know it but bhimalek was standing in opposition to the word of god he was going to hinder the word he was going to stop the word he was going to derail the word so god comes down supernaturally injects himself into the situation because he has to manifest what's in his mind he has to manifest what's written in the last book of life he has to manifest what's written in the stars do you get what i'm saying so now god has to come down he has to play he has to warn he has to speak because he's got to preserve this womb because it's this is his plan and from there the word is coming forth to stop that word from coming forth brings a curse and brings death even though abimelech wasn't aware of it even though pharaoh wasn't aware of it they weren't doing it intentionally but to come against the word even unintentionally will bring death because the word is life and to come against life is death so the movement of life in that day was coming from abraham through sarah unto isaac and that was the movement of life and to stop that would bring death and curses upon you
