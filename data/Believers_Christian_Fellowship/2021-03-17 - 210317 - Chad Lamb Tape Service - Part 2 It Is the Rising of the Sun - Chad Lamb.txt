we're going to be continuing on in the second part of it is the rising of the sun so we're going to just open in a word of prayer and let you have your seats and we'll get into that if you didn't bring your book if you didn't have one yet they're still out and the four year beside the welcome desk on the blue card out there so you can run out and grab one let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you for the privileged lord of being here tonight god of the billions of people that are on this planet you have called us lord those that are walking in darkness lord in an hour that's getting darker by the moment but you've put eye salve in our eyes and give us eyes to see and here's to here and our heart to perceive what you're doing in this day help us never take it for granted lord may it never become common to us or a tradition but it may be a love affair every day between us and you lord god as we come to this tape service lord i pray that you just give us fresh revelation that you would help us to see what it is you're trying the message you're trying to get to your children in this hour may we receive it in its fullness the way you intended it to be received god when your heart was given through this prophetic message lord help us to receive your heart purpose and meaning in it lord well we love you and we ask that you would take preeminence among us may we worship you lord in spirit and in truth in jesus name we pray amen you can all have your seats um we're going to like i said this is the second part we'll have a third service next wednesday to finish it and we're going to listen to just under an hour tonight we've got some quick questions as well but i want to go through our opening scriptures first so we're going to go back to the three opening scriptures that brother venom opened with and we'll begin in revelations chapter one so if you want to take your bibles and we want to make sure we keep these um the context what he's the the scriptures that he used to gain this context in our minds as we move forward so revelation chapter 1 was the first scripture that he read and he read verse 17 and 18 and we'll read that now and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death my lord and my savior holds the keys of hell and of death what am i afraid of not hell and death that's for sure let's go back to romans chapter 8. this was the second scripture that brother branham read let's begin this service romans chapter 8 and verse 11. romans 8 and 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen let's go to mark 16. mark 16 and brother brennan read verses 1 and 2. mark 16 verse 1 and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and psalmy had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulcher at the rising of the sun from this brother branham cross's text now he's going to go into another scripture in leviticus here in this next part so we'll turn and read that together leviticus chapter 23. in leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9 leviticus 23 and 9. and the lord spake unto moses saying speaking to the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it amen so brother man we'll go into this and explain this for us if we'll take out our books and then we're going to we're going to go back and just review it just a couple uh read a couple quotes and review and then we'll go into our questions if you take your book you notice the title is it is the rising of the sun so we we noted last time that this is a very present tense title it is the rising of the sun this isn't time to reflect back although they come to an easter service this is going to be the last easter message that brother venom is going to preach in his earthly journey until he returns in a glorified body in the millennium but this this is the last message he's going to preach amen and and so the last easter message i'm sorry that he's gonna preach and this message is from april 18 1965 so we always want to note where we are in the ministry and where we are in time and he's preaching in jeffersonville and he's telling us that it is the rising of the sun brother venom is not just looking back but he's taking us back in that day to show us the reality of what happened and what it means to us and he's asking was it just a tradition is it just a one day in the year was it just then or is it is the resurrection for me now and he's trying to let us know it's for us now that it is the rising of the sun so if we could turn together to paragraph 30. i'm going to pull out a little highlight a few little highlights for review paragraph 30 on page 5. sorry page 5 paragraph 30 it says satan doesn't satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again this is the point brother is trying to drive home amen there's a resurrection for us let's turn to page seven and read paragraph 41 at the top page seven at the top but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising another sun son rising it was not only the sun rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth no no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is upon the earth it takes to eson light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that because this son of god raised it would also raise to life every sun that was foreordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at the time when it first dawned now on this great breaking of the easter seal praise god amen let's turn to page 9 and paragraph 54. 54 on top of page 9. and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've already conquered him don't fear any more for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained it to do he had raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is i'm alive or quickened the word the word the word means the word quicken the greek word means something that's made alive after death like the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of that seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he was quick and not only that and will send that same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there you will be also this is the great meaning of easter all right now let's go to paragraph 12 and we're going to begin on paragraph 12. i'm going to read the questions here in just a minute but we're going to start right at the beginning of page 12 on paragraph 76 page 12 at the top on paragraph 76 and we're going to go to page 30 it'll be just under an hour and we're going to go to the bottom of paragraph 231 so that's what we're looking to do today now let's go to the questions if we could pull up the powerpoint brother franco all right we've only got four today the first one is what is the wave sheath so you want to write these down these come in chronological order like i said there's no trick questions this is just something to keep us all tuned in together what is the wave sheath and number two what are the mechanics and the dynamics what are the mechanics and the dynamics and i just want to make a disclaimer if there's anything on here that's spelled incorrectly it is microsoft's fault and not mine because they have spell check so what are the mechanics and the dynamics number three how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh this is probably the most important question of them all how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh praise the lord number three how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh and number four how were sins remitted by the apostles so he's going to get into this our sins remitted by the apostles those are our four questions as you listen to the message you'll these you'll come across these brother venom answers all of these and then when we're done we'll get up and we'll go through these and discuss them and pull out highlights so i think that's everything check my notes here yes that's everything all right we'll begin at the top of page 12 on paragraph 76. brother franco if you can go ahead and turn on the message uh them who were once groping in darkness and wandering around if they should wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules all those things passed away well that was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man-made reason there had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again when they say that jesus christ is the same yesterday forever that his power isn't the same that is gospel this is the same when the bible says it's the same god define every denomination never creed and he moved forth with his holy spirit as he promised hence proved it to us as he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quicken after being said in the world and sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus his brain is spirit brings his same life again on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ the body the anointed blocking if the spirit of god anointed that body in such a way that when that seed fell into the earth you just wouldn't let him rest there no he quickly raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you he'll also raise you up i'd like to read a little scripture here for you i'd like for you to turn to another scripture i got wrote down here it might help you a little is found in the book of leviticus the 23rd chapter the ninth to the eleventh verse listen close in the law of levitical law god speaking to moses listen all these things are tight now and we'll stop here for a few moments to get into this type and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give unto you unto the place of position that i have given unto you now you speak to the children of israel that when you get to this certain place that i promise you i take you when you get there in this land now speaking natural here type in the spiritual and shall reap the harvest thereof you may receive what i told you thereof then you shall bring a sheath of the first fruit of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you all tomorrow after the sabbath the priest shall weave it if there would be any holy ritual it should come forth on the sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is saturday but did you notice in this memorial the wave it on the first day of the week the sheep which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripened you cut down this sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the lord for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheath and he's the wave it before the lord on not on the sabbath the seventh day but on the first date which we call sunday s-u-n-d-a-y of course that's a roman uh word which they called it the sunday for the sun god but how it is changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a why the sunday that that carnal week god's first one up from today is to be waived over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seeds of those that slip waved upon the first day of the week on sunday he raised up waves goodbye and ascended up on han in the presence of the people notice it was the first corner of god's wheat that had been raised from today god's first corner week by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheep that's why they had to weigh that sheep or it was the first one that come to maturity and it was weighed as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come there was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth as waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although it you've been typed in many times and we'll see later that he was types but this is really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promised of life he was waved at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to come and to be waived again we realized in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sunday again in the days that the ethon of man will be revealed or waved again over the people who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word would make flesh and dwelt among us and of all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signed by wonders we see the day that in the book of of luke here as we just quoted from the the luke the 17th chapter the 31st and malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the shot of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us has given us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all those types in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the pride coming up christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheep ways to get in the laces oh my gosh waiting of the sheep what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about [Applause] he was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the fraud age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism it will be a message that's the form full maturity all the word has turned back again in his full power and being waved over the people by the same kinds of wonders that he did that all right it's called alien ye live also speaking to his wife because i live you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the deity to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickness power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to him on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now and he's our stage to be waved again in the last days now for instance you say when i waited brother branham i know a church said well i do too but now for instance what if if we were going to go back to tucson this afternoon now and each one of us had a was going to go in a a big cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of a blue skin softness of the leather soft and easy to sit in and the floorboards were plush the steering wheel were nickel plated and had diamond studs all over and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels were all had bearings and greased up and the tires were all puncture proof and blow out freeze all been tested scientifically they've been pushed off the assembly line both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because it is the option but now when you're going to start them all those that look just alike but there's one of them don't have any spark any firing power well you say the power is in the gasoline brother brand but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest this power that there's a power there to confirm that this gasoline it just might as well be water until no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest him and to bring to pass it this is gasoline [Music] it might be in a gasoline can it should still be water see but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove where it's getting special and when you try to put the holy spirit in the denomination you're as much as trying you get a splatter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but all i'm so fast that there is a 10 thousand power the word of god and a holy ghost hide it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shoved that cadillac down the road under the dynamic power of the holy ghost which came back to us ways over the people at the day of pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all prophets there's been churches churches bribes brides churches bride brides but there's got to come one [Music] [Music] in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift you're assigning a job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it work that's what he proves that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word the body of jesus christ cold stepping dead in the grave shake it alive and rise again and roll away i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only a mechanic god's word he was a dynamic to prove it and is he being the group today the bride has to come forth called this part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bra because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit defeated his spirit coming the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and make mechanics and dynamics and tell the church or the people all these easter bunnies these ceremonies as big churches and pirates will fail and pass away until that church both diabetic and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so hey why is that in john 14 12 see that's what he belong with me the works that i do shall he love [Applause] amen i'll give him a charge of my dynamics [Music] and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up down all you want to and deny this word amen you won't do any good if you're just cranking around the pistons have got sparked out of fire but no gas need to far back it'll only work as they come together amen so one will set still and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yes they both might look like both claim to be churches proclaim to be bribed but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass so what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when a diamond it comes that bar is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explosion that causes a combustion and that combustion moves every emotion ever moved or he is the pain yesterday today and foreign that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sent me swords and i use the same mechanics it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life i remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice the same spirit now romans 8 1 let's just read that again in romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm sorry and romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's this catch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead 12 in you oh there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bride grew he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit forming in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he made e from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word or adam was the spoken word see he took from him and then taken the he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eaves who are still part of adam's fears it's adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamics that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones then how is this mortal flesh go become his flesh we'll get to it how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh the projected ones of course like the seed laid up on the earth the one that had life and many of them are dead they were just rotten seeds but waters and things burn them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god know it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own how this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the sun was set across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to lie it was not to bring all the dirt fell right but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the line not all men will receive crimes oh no but those which god for ordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's when it comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun's so hot that rock said there's no sun so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and they begin to spring forth the line it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the earth but to quicken the life of the seed now the holy spirit comes down of course it wasn't fat why won't all the people receive it it wasn't said to him god told me i don't believe i don't care what you said you could raise up the dead or anything heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe that it's going on you're unbelievers it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't sent to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them to perish is foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed is life my crude little story about the farmer putting the egg on the eagle egg under the heat see that little eagle was absolutely he was a he was an odd-looking little creature when this uh farmer had did that thing that he did to put this uh eagle egg under this old hand and she had shot a funny looking chicken it was a it was odd a little salty didn't look like him his feathers wasn't like the rest of him and he he just he was not a little tired and uh all the rested chickens recognized him in odds and the hen went around he didn't even like the dike she was feeding me he just didn't like that scratching in the barnyard he he didn't have nothing to do with it so he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there and he never tasted anything that he just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it i think because he wants a chicken too and uh the hand would cluck and you know there's a miracle just back there is no such a thing to join the church it just didn't hit right with the little guy so he fought around the hands until one day his mammy the old eagle old laid so many eggs and there was one missing she knew that that eagle was somewhere so she starts out on the hunt party and she's circled over the mountain top and down in the valleys over and everywhere before he might of be by this time it's time for him to be born the time frame be hatched out so maybe a crow coming to pick up my egg maybe a vulture i don't know if something picked up my egg but i know that egg is in my mind [Music] hallelujah got a son somewhere i got the honey so he's gone he's that great eagle in his thoughts he wanted to have a church in order to have a people no matter what cuddled him no matter what he's hatched out under he's hunting he's hunting for his own and one day the story goes this old eagle flew over the barnyard just looking at what you found oh for that resurrection to recognize that he really wasn't chicken natural he was an eagle and he's always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard a scream and said look up this way and he looked above him and there was a creature but 14 feet wings powerful and all the chickens he was in a barney heart and claimed him to be her son he said mama how can it get to you they just jump start flopping your hands or you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated foreign church you know he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over that wave she he's the same yesterday for everybody not some mythical story but a reality no matter how i might try to tell him the eagle he didn't know what a eagle was yet he was an eagle he would understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a phd not a lld not a good neighbor but a son of god molded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word amen the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to obedience to the word of god quickly what do you want to know how i can get there with her he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't get a higher jump he's a chicken but this eagle said that's not soul well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are your eagles just start spreading those wings get a little exercise in him start moving up the word to the word the works that i do shall you also he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he also because i live he lives also into the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you he quickens your mortal body see what does it do now listen to what you know that this easter i want to mean more to you than any easter egg i want you to see we know what it's done for him but i want you to see it's not well it has done the same for you amen what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything a bunch of cigarettes and you women who once had short hair and painted and carried on more sharks and things like that oh it wants something scream and you look down here and it was the word saying it quickened your you said no more shorts no more liquor for me no more no more stealing no more see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies look at the rest of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjection of love christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's hard for women to wear uh slack when the words said no think it quits you do that you're drawn to it see it's you then it becomes you become part of the word it brought your body not well you say well now let me tell you something my pastor what your pastor said what the word said if you want to be a chicken go on with them but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the eagles he's the feeder of the hymns see not of the eagles the eagle eats on eagles from there they acquainted the bible said strongly that the man and so forth and what all you do it's wrong say days and miracles just pass this bible said he's the same yesterday forever let's say that's mental telepathy there's some kind of mind reading this discernment all these divisions and things is nonsense they are chickens that's right they don't know what eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you your ego should begin with why you are the seed that the resurrection of the s o n has gone in the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now how we flesh to be flesh and born in his bones because quickly while we're at mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what's quick it brings the line the spirit that wants like to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quickened well the thing died and you're resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your body is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics there's your resurrection there's the church in the resurrection these bodies right now are quickened okay you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word see the dynamic if it comes upon water it will splutter taste america want to breathe strike a chicken it won't do no good but when he strikes the eagle he moves out the dynamic with the mechanics you know what i mean that is if he is a true eagle now he will understand let me straighten a little scripture here for you i think we're off of the poem but we are still here amen uh saint john 5 24 jesus said he that teareth my word and believe it's on him and say he has everlasting life now look i go down the street and take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding i may just say nothing else but it's saying what it says see the right word there in the greek in the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right i go down yours there's a drunk coming along they're speaking with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking god's name in vain and everything else like that say did you hear what that preacher said did you yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle now brother brown want more scripture than that all right my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had told me that i come said it just the way he told me some minister lady gave me a right sharpen the ball now she said i guess you take the place of god it's a no man that were you told her sin is forgiven the words that only god has power another pharisee that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles actually had the revelation of who he was before he denied christ the son of god he said blessed are them the son of jonah flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys whatever you find on earth i'll find it in here what you loose on earth that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flashing that day but the sun the groom is the flesh today by the bride whosoever sends your remit to them they are remitted whosoever sends you retain to them they are retained now the catholic church picks that up and takes it to the priest but that's carnal watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's really going to go baptized in the name of father son holy course he knows they know who he was talking to a little preacher of the day he said to me he said now brother branham i've come out and joined one over to a certain uh certain church a pentecostal church where the pentecostal now has started taking the round wafer you know you've heard of that i guess the kosher the moon god you know and they all accepted it and statement this man said this congregation went through you said what i have blessed is blessed now you know what the priest says he has power to turn it back to the body of christ six to one half dozen others that's the same and um he said i want to ask you something he's trying to dodge that issue of the baptism jesus name because this was the man that said it was it was the antichrist that did that he said do you think it's all necessary that a man should be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's the gesture he said after he's been baptized in the name of father son holy ghost i said yesterday he has been baptized at all amen yes at all amen that's the title i said it doesn't recognize i said why did uh why did uh peter he said well let me tell you something he said now in acts 10 49 he said why peter had to speak these words the holy ghost telephone man but i said he turned right around and said can a man forbid water these should not be baptized he said when you're speaking over there a while ago about acts 19 where paul passed it up close to that's behind them disciples and said well said they wasn't baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost i said no they were baptized unto repentance not for remission of sin unto repentance because jesus had been made on you the sacrifice hadn't been killed he said well why would they have to be baptized or i said the man that had the key said this for be it knowing unto you that there's not another name under heaven given among man whereby you must be saved salvation alone goes in the name of jesus christ whatever you do in war or deeds do it all in the name of jesus christ there's not another name no church no heart you know titles or nothing else yet he is the rose of sharon lilly's valley morning star alpha omega beginning in jehovah character manasseh all these he's all these things but yet he there's not no salvation in any of those titles jehovah no salvation rose of sharon yet he is no salvation father son or holy ghost no salvation only the name of jesus christ and then the bible says that repentance and remission of sin must be taught in his name beginning at jerusalem and to the uttermost parts of the earth yeah he said do you think it makes any difference i said sir i want to ask you something he and i my wife were staying at the table he just moved over stimulus i said we are both arizonans we live here and i and we know our council and our award and all our mayor the governor and everything he said yes i said now if i told you brother to go over here and sign up for our dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona would you go sign it like that do you think they'd receive it as to death i guess not he said why did jesus say that after this is it see wow if i told you to go sign for this dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona and us being citizens of arizona and knowing who the governor is what you know to sign it in the name of sam goddard see i said because he is the governor of the state i don't have to question you you know who the governor is and he said father son and holy ghost he knows how to go to baptize they know who he was my sheep hear my voice he said oh i think but now the next thing what do you believe that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting time and when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential when you have received this holy spirit now that they did at pentecost they were the mechanics now the dynamics had to come they had believed you know our good baptist friends tells us when we believe we've got it but they didn't have it yet did believe acts 19 did believe but they didn't have you received the holy ghost sensually see they had the mechanics all right because the apostles were i mean uh apollos was teaching to them and proven by the bible the mechanics that jesus was the christ but they didn't have the dynamics yet that's it all right what spanish you potentially have the earnest the waiting now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come subject to the word it makes you act different look different live differently it'll just make you different hello quickened you who are once dead and sin and trespasses and darkness has he quickened what by his spirit that raised up jesus on easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal body now what is our soul quickens brings to life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else or it will freaking your mortal bodies to the word so it will you can't run without it you just splutter you don't believe all of it if you have pork gasoline part water you can't ain't going to go nowhere you've got to take it one hundred percent gasoline if you don't you're back for you ain't got no power well i'll buy bleed this or don't believe that don't you ain't going nowhere but oh when you take this let it light up on that every word is true then notice how as we close notice this notice it's just like a little a little seed laying in the ground now potentially you are resurrected you're resurrected when you receive the holy spirit in you you're resurrected right then your body's potentially resurrected look at a little steep plant in the ground it has to drink from its fountains the waters it pours down and as it drinks it pushes up towards him coming more like the likeness of the seed that went into the ground see the church come that way through justifications sanctification baptist and holy ghost now in the blossom see the spirit of god comes through that and the spirit of the world has come to the antichrist the same way and now blocks them out in a great union of churches see the whole thing and the individual comes that way everything works on the same on the same scale of god because he is saying yesterday forever notice on your way growing to the fullness of the resurrection led by the spirit as the sun f-u-n tool that little plant that's drinking from god's fountains just keep see he can only drink from one thing you pour oil down that little seed one time kill it that's right you pour stagnated water old water ain't no good's contaminated it'll stump the growth it won't bear fruit is that right but you pour real good soft rainforest hey no man-made chemicals in it just let it come from the heavens above and watch that little frame there's no water i'll grow that like that rainbow you put chlorine stuff in like you try to dose us up with and the first thing you know it kills the plane that's what's the matter today to try to give them water from the denominational fountain and it stunts the growth but lame has it were that dew drops of mercy all right day and by night jesus the light of the world and you've got it we'll walk in the light that beautiful light comes where the few drops of mercy are bright just shine all around me take these man-made fountains away from me all the thoughts i know nothing but the blood of jesus that's all the fountains i want to know that's the word dwelling me lord water it with our spirit now if that spirit that raised up jesus from the grave dwells in you you potentially have life led by the spirit to quicken the word to you to believe it the little thing keeps pushing up as it grows notice at pentecost their bodies were quickened to a new line look at a bunch of little cowards i'm holding fuel looking i'm just warmed up feeling good right oh my notice they were cowards notice but they had the mechanics but they were all standing back in their arms greater i'm afraid to go out and make a claim that goes oh all them great big bishops in the entire arab parade and preach the names i'm afraid to make that claim pray to us out and go oh i just can't do that you see but all of a sudden the dynamics come yes and what did it do didn't always fill their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quicker they were no more cowards they went right out in the face of the people yes sir you man of judea than you to dwell in jerusalem or before the dynamics come they were just mechanics amen that dwell in jerusalem let this meat on you and harken my words these are not drunken supposed this is that i'll show you what it is it's the scripture this is that and i always say just think that let me keep this for that coming no this is that they were spoken over the prophet john will come to pass when i say it says god i'll pour out my spirit upon all places see the dynamics come into the mechanics it was afraid no more some of you people that are afraid that some woman will laugh at you for having their quit learning some of you man that's afraid your organization will throw you out when you're baptized your congregation is scriptural baptism you need to close yourself in the upper room till the dynamics come that's right it changed them it quickened them it made them different they were changed people from their own they quickened them from an old life of being a coward to a lack of the light of the tribe of jesus they absolutely face martyr nails or crosses crucified upside down first part of their lives now no more cars death had no victory over them at all the dynamics is in the mechanics yes sir it quickens their mortal body now listen here's another thing for fruit it's so quick in them in such a way do you know what they was lifted up in heavenly places and their mortal bodies were so quick until their language changed hallelujah they don't want to get quick in their language that's what the bible says their mortal bodies be quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quicker their spirits were quickened they lied quicker they were quick and all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk in any more human languages they were so quick enough in the presence of god until they spoke in new tongues by every language if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your immortal bodies it'll make you do things you didn't do before but there's poor quickening power then see your body ain't subject to sin no more you you're sorry he said come on out here you say shut your mouth oh we got the biggest shut your mouth your eagle jersey our independence no where you gonna walk he don't hop like a vulture you see sabra is dead no they're carrying a man on the ground doctor cut your mouth oh here's a good dinner over here it's not for me my desires has changed my appetite is different our man shall not live on the world of caring alone but by every word that proceeds out above the power of genuine quicken eagles amen oh and you raised up christ from the grave dwelling in you as quick into your mortal body unto his presence you recognize it you are no longer a scavenger you're an eagle you don't want the things of the world you're the son daughter of god you're facing at a fountain that the world was nothing about you're drinking that somebody knows the world knows nothing about you you're eating hidden manna that the world never even knows nothing of it or you're an eagle you're quick enough where you can get to it you can't get through it down here you got to get up here you got to be quick and lifting up there so quickly hey what did they do they spoke in another language the bible said they didn't they spoke in every tongue under heaven could you imagine that an old mortal body that came out that well i don't know now whether i can believe this or not all at once they were so quick and so the bravery of the lion of the tribe of judah fellowship over that waving sheep oh that eagle come to call its own amen and they love not their lives unto them amen amen and there's going to be more who will give their life blood for this holy ghost gospel in its cleansing amen as the son of god be revealed again to the bride in the last days now quickly power's got to come a quick amount of these dead denominations increase to a visiting world of their living god oh no it's a new life it does the same thing for us now notice then they were so quick into that quick thing power uh listen close now i'm trying to show you the quickness power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them and not only the dynamics come into quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what i mean they were so quick until their tongues began to speak in another england they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of christ until they laid their hands they were so quick and with quickening power and when they laid their hands up on the stick they got well quickened your mortal body man they were healed by laying on their hands and the spirit clicking their fellowships together with god so they also were so quick and into the presence of god until when a person died in their soul and girl they called him back to life again sorry i'm feeling religious that's right not only was his resurrection for himself but whosoever will through this predestinated seed that began their quickest christians are more about they lay hands on the sticks they recovered they prayed in the spirit of salvation call the dead back to life that's right right quicken their immortal body and if it comes into you if it be so now you can say it so but if it be so these signs follow them it quickens your mortal body it'll quicken you now notice put them into the presence of god why it was the spirit of god that raised up jesus from the grave and the spirit of god are given that eternal life comes from the greek word if you look up zoe which moves it through you and then quickens their even their mind hello how can you say that that spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here's your evidence when you got it now if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word and if it contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ sure what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word let's talk about the other day i love the word amen what is the wave sheath let's look at paragraph 87 on page 13. paragraph 87 will start there and read a little while it is not s-u-n anymore it is the s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday that that corn of wheat god's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week on sunday he raised that wave goodbye and ascended up on high in the presence of the people notice it was the first corn of god's wheat that had been raised from the dead god's first corn of wheat by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the firstfruits he was that sheaf that's why they have to wave that sheep for it was the first one that came to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come would come it was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and has waved over the people and oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been typed in many times as we'll see later he was tight but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promise of life he was waved at the day of pentecost when they come a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realize in the last day according to luke 17 30 the the sunday again and the day that the s-o-n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people i'm going to stop right here for just a minute brother branham takes us to leviticus 23 and shows us the old testament law of gathering you know when they would come to a field the first part of the field that would come to maturity they would cut down a sheath from the first part of the seed that would come to full maturity and they would take it to the temple and not on the seventh day but on the first day of the week on the sunday amen they would begin to wave it amen and they wave it for your acceptance is what the scripture says showing that whatever brought this seed to full harvest maturity will bring the rest of the seed to full harvest maturity and so christ was the first one that came to full maturity to be in god to prove that he was the son of god to prove that he was seed and he was plucked up and waved over the people not on the seventh day but on the first day and then the first day of the week at the rising of the sun amen and he was waved over the people to show that that the same potential amen the same potential lays in the rest of the seed now let's start at the top of verse 14 our page 14 again um paragraph 92 and to be waived again so it was waved once and it was way back at the day of pentecost amen it was waived uh back again at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost came and was waved over the people and it quickened them to life and then brother branham says and it's to be waived again amen we realize in the last day according to luke 17 30 in the sunday again in the day that the s-o-n of man will be revealed are waved again over the people so now what was the wave sheath it was the first one to come to harvest maturity it was plucked up from the grave it was waved over the people the day of pentecost to show amen that they've been accepted and what brought him to full maturity will bring them the full maturity but brother branham said it's got to be waived again in the last days amen and the day what day the day that the esso of s o n of man the son of man will be revealed are waved again over the people so in luke 17 30 amen in the revealing of the son of man what was the revealing of the son of man it was the waving of the wave sheath again in the last day over the people to show quickening power is here amen to bring you to life amen now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word he goes right back to john 1 1 who was the son of man it was the word amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signs by wonders we see today that in the book of luke here that we just quoted from luke the 17th chapter 30th verse and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and is giving us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those who slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my what was that sheep that was the waving of the sheep it was luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of man was the waving of the sheep and it was waved again in the last days it was it was waved in his day amen to bring him out of the dead traditions of their fathers where they had taken the law and converted into their own understanding to bring them out of that into the reality of the living word and is to do the same thing again in this day the bride coming of christ coming out of the church don't have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheep what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time that will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back then show me where through this prophet god didn't do the same thing amen through this prophet he showed the sa he revealed the son of man through the prophet he did the same signs and wonders through the prophet he restored back the word and it was waving the wave sheath over the people again verse 97 or paragraph 97 because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is because it is the rising of the sun not was or will be but it is a rising of a sun what a resurrection that was on that day but what erection resurrection this is in this day friends to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was weighed back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now when i say it's to be waved again in the last days he was the word being waved amen it was the son of man being waved the word made manifest being waived and on our day it was waved again amen the first one that come to maturity to prove it was a weed and brother banham was standing here a son of man revealing the son of man but these son of man was working through that son of man a son of men to to reveal that the word has come back the same signs the same wonders the same life the same resurrection life that was there was back again and what was it wait for for your acceptance to show that you have been accepted amen that now there's a there's a field amen there's a true wheat out there amen and this proves that the field has been accepted amen and you're coming to the same maturity amen friends i i appreciate what god has done for us because he's done it in such a way you it can't be hid it can't be ignored he did it so powerful and so mighty with such demonstration that you can say amen it's already been accepted amen it's already been accepted so the rest of the field is secure the rest of the field will come to full harvest maturity i don't have to worry amen i don't have to stress i don't have to strain because there was a wave sheet because that part of the word come to manifestation and was waved over the congregation it has secured the process for the rest of the field the rest of the field will come to full harvest maturity it has been waived for my acceptance amen i don't have to prove anything i don't have to strain all i have to do is lay in the presence of the sun to break all the greenness out amen will come to the same harvest maturity you may not have to do all the same things that brother branham did that's not what i'm talking about but the same life amen the same resurrected life has to be in you and i it's been waived for our acceptance let's turn over to page 21 no i'm sorry 20. top of page 20 paragraph 141 and god knows and god knows he's got a predestinated for ordained church he knowed he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over it the wave sheath oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but a reality so what is the wave sheath it's the son of man it's the holy spirit it's the life of god it's the life of christ it's all the same thing being waved back over the people again and that's the wave chief hallelujah let's look at question number two what are the mechanics and the dynamics let's go to page 15. page 15. let's look at paragraph 102. well you say the power is in the gasoline brother venom but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it might as well be water no matter how much theologians claim how well you get your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheaf until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word that gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we have too much we have we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water see but the only proof of it is proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not so the the the mechanics brother bannon is showing is the word amen the mechanics is the word amen but the he says the dynamics is the holy spirit is the life let's turn over to paragraph 113 on the next page and i want to read in this paragraph 113 i want to read the last two sentences he said that's the easter that's the easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together both the word and the life that's this easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics that's an interesting statement it takes both next page paragraph 116. it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane and the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickened it it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which pleases to god is pleasing to god now as he sent me so what send i you with the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate in and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place so the mechanics is the word and the dynamics is the spark amen that so brother bram takes it with gasoline and spark in this engine in this cadillac said the cadillac is perfect it's set in motion he said we have two cadillacs here and everything set and then perfect amen and he says but one has got the spark and the other one has no spark and the one with the spark can get on down the road and he types the mechanics and the dynamics with gasoline and spark and he types it with the word and the life so it takes the word and the life together and he said this is the easter message the eastern messages the dynamics and the mechanics together it's the word and it's the life amen it's the word that's been restored and it's the life that's come back into the church question number three how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh this is really good let's go to paragraph 123 on page 18. how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh we'll get to it in a minute see how it's how how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now oftentimes when we read that scripture and many times in the past we've read the scripture with a denominational understanding and we look at this scripture as future tense that says if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell on you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you and we look at it as a future resurrection body change scripture but brother branham is going to use it as a present tense scripture that the spirit in you will quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you that your mortal body is going to be quickened amen even before the change in the body even before your atoms change there's going to be a quickening of your mortal flesh so the denominational understanding is if you have the spirit of god someday your body will change in the rapture and resurrection but brother branham is bringing it right present tense amen that is a truth but it's also true that that spirit is changing us now let's turn to let's look at paragraph 141 on the next page page 20. this is one of those where brother branham asks a question and he makes a statement then he says other things and he gets back to it he says other things and he gets back to it and you got to follow brother branham through because he asked the question he said how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh how is it done what is this great transformation in paragraph 141 he says and god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated foreordained church he knowed he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over it that wave sheave oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle oh i want to stop right there brother branham's keying in on if his story of the farmer taking an egg out of the eagle's nest and putting it under a hand and the eagle being born in the barnyard under a hand amen and confused about its identity thinking it's a chicken identifying as a chicken but all the time being an eagle and brother ben is going to take that story and he's going to begin to show us and listen through this eagle story he's going to begin to show us the quickening power and a resurrection and the same quickening power and resurrection that's available for us today he says now when that holy spirit begins to fly over that wave sheaf he's the same yesterday today and forever he said no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was no matter how many times he was a christian wanted to be a christian amen you didn't even know what a christian was until you saw the prophet of god in action god working through that one then you knew what a son of god was amen no matter how many tried to tell him an ego he didn't know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle he would not understand it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when he seen not a denomination not a phd not an lld not a good neighbor but a son of god molded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day look what brother branham is saying he's not talking about i mean the day that jesus of nazareth is here he's talking about today there had to be an eagle flying in this day for us to look at we didn't even know what a manifested son of god it was we didn't even know what a mature son of god was until we saw one and then we know whatever that is is what i am amen i'm going to read that again but a son of god molded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no him going to hold you he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it what did the eagle realize the eagle realized that it's not an earth-bound bird but it's a heaven-bound bird and it recognizes his position and leaves the denomination leaves the church leaves the barnyard and takes his position in the heavenlies and you and i realize amen when we heard this eagle screen this holy ghost that was moving in our day amen we saw it manifest through a life amen with with all the signs and all the wonders and the restoration of the word when we saw that amen we recognize that's my position amen the ego was looking up to its position and we in our day have been looking up we're not supposed to be earthbound we're not supposed to be denominationally minded we're not supposed to live a chicken life but our position is up there you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to obedience to the word of god amen brother ben's talking about today it is the rising of the sun paragraph 147 the word to the word the works that i do show you also he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he also see because i live he lives also and if the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you it quickens your mortal body see what does it do now listen so that you'll know this easter i want it to mean more to you than any easter ever did see i want you to see it we know what it did for him but i want you i want you to see it not will it has done the same for you what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words it brings it to life now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything or a bunch of cigarettes and you women who once had short hair painted and carried on and wore shorts and things like that all at once something screamed and you looked down and here it was the word see it quickened your you said no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying no more stealing no more this that see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what it is subjection to what christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's all right for women to wear slacks when the word says no see it quickens you to that see you are drawn to it see it becomes you become part of the word it brings your body skip down to paragraph 154 but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with why you are that seed now you want i want you to see all the way through this message brother branham is referring to the seed singular not seeds plural he is never referring to it plural because in the bible it was abraham's seed singular not plural and what is abraham's seed abraham's seed is christ and you are part of that seed singular christ you're part of it it's part of a many member body but it's the life of christ you are that seed that resurrection of the s-o-n has dawned and the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chick and you see it and if the if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone he asked the question again now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly while we were yet sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what's quicken brings to life the spirit that once liked to drink run around commit adultery and all these it quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics because you're part of that seed amen you're part of christ you're part of the word and because you're part of that amen you are a temple of the dynamics oh there is your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quick and see you've heard you believed it changed you from a denomination to the word when brother branham is preaching this scripture amen out of romans 8 11 he is preaching it present tense potential to quicken your mortal bodies to bring this body subject to the word this body in obedience to the word that this body must now reflect the life that's come inside because the dynamic power has come inside to quicken the word and now it's to be manifest on the outside not just something that takes place on the inside but what takes place on the inside has to be brought to life on the outside so this power has to quicken your mortal body so that this body can demonstrate the life that's on the inside amen praise be to god god is good let's look at turn the page over to paragraph 191 the bottom of page 25. now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come subject to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different now look ben quickened you who were once dead in sin and trespasses in darkness as he quickened what by his spirit that raised up jesus on easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal bodies now watch it also quickens brings to life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else for it will quicken your mortal bodies to the word it sure will brother branham is preaching a present tense resurrection he's preaching a present tense easter he's saying it is the rising of the sun and that rising of the sun is quickening seeds that have life inside of them it's quickening them to life to bring them into a manifestation that that no way defeats the truth or or obscures the truth that one day these bodies will change our atoms will change absolutely but it's changing now amen the the body is coming subject to the life on inside and it's raining in the cravings it's raining in the desire it's changing the cravings changing the desires changing the actions changing the reactions amen bringing it light it's changing now and it will be ultimately changed when our atoms change praise god let's go to question number four to go here i'd like to take our bibles before we read this and let's read in matthew 16. brother branham's going to quote these just off hand in the sermon here but i'd like to read matthew 16 verse 17. and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven so peter just got the revelation of who christ is and he said it wasn't anything any man gave you it was a direct revelation from the father so that's what he just stated in verse 18 and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it verse 19 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let's go over to john 20. john chapter 20. and verse 21 first william then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained the question that i asked for question number four was how were sins remitted by the apostles and it was based off these scriptures let's go to paragraph 163 at the bottom of page 22. paragraph 163 as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had told me that i come said it just the way he told me and some minister lady gave me a right sharp balling out what brother ben is referring to his brother branham is referring to the lord told him that the people were caught up in wrong marriages through marriage and divorce and by wrong teaching they were caught in these situations and brother brenham was told that he could permit them to go on as they were that they were forgiven and that they could go on as they were but don't ever do it again right that's what he's referring to it says here and some minister lady gave me a right sharp little balling out she said i guess you take the place of god i said no ma'am said well you told them their sins is forgiven said where said only god has power see another pharisee. i said you see that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was he told him thou art christ the son of god he said blessed art thou see son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven what you loose on earth that's that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in the day by the sun the groom it is flesh today by the bride see whosoever sends you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now the catholic church picked that up and takes it to their priest but that's carnal they'll go and make a confession in a confession booth to a priest and the priest will say no you're forgiven but that's carnal that's not even what this is talking about paragraph 170 watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told them to go baptized in the name of father son holy ghost he knowed they knowed who he was look how brother benham tied this thing together he's saying now now he got a right sharp balling out from a woman because of what he had said but brother brandon prefaced what he said was this is only to my people only to those that are staying with this word and on this word the ones who are believing the manifested revealed word for the day the ones who have accepted christ amen the ones who have got who've accepted amen the word made flesh he said it's only for those people so brother ben preface that he comes down and he says now he told peter whatsoever you bind i'll buy what you loose i'll lose amen that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh and he goes on to say whosoever sends your remit to them to remit whoever sends you retain to them to retain and he says not like the catholics where the catholic priest says you're forgiven and you're not and you confess it to me no he says watch it's the spiritual revealed word that did it that's why he told him to baptize that way what he's showing that the revelation of who the father son and holy ghost was he told him to baptize that way because he knew that they caught the revelation of who he was and would come preaching the right baptism and when the right baptism would only be accepted by the eagles and when it was accepted by the eagles when they accepted the word for their day their sins would be remitted it wasn't a hocus pocus or casting a spell or an incantation or you said this and i say this and you're forgiven because of this no they just gave the revelation of the word for their day what must we do to be saved repent amen and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and they accepted it they believed it and then they repented they were baptized and they were filled with the holy ghost and their sins were remembered that's how the apostles remitted sin by giving the revealed word for their day and when it was accepted and acted upon the sins were remitted how is the sins remitted in this day the exact same way it's no different the revealed word of the hour is given out amen it's accepted by faith and acted upon amen and the baptism of the holy ghost comes and the sin is washed away amen there's nothing different it's the same process praise be to god now i want to make one last note before we close paragraph 231 let's go all the way to page 30. i thought this was an outstanding statement so the last thing that he said before we turn the tape off paragraph 231 now look how can you say that the spirit dwells in you how can you say that though you've done everything that you thought was right here's your evidence whether you've got it or not if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word and if it if it contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ i care what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word i was talking on that the other day what's the evidence that spirit in you doesn't move your contrary the word it moves you right into the word to accept every word to believe every word to manifest every word to live it amen to believe it to live it to manifesting oh god is good friends i want to ask you is this the rising of the sun was this whose resurrection is this anyways i want to say this is my resurrection this is my easter it's my easter every day why because the sun is risen amen and it's quick in the life on the inside and that life amen is quickened this mortal body and what i was i'm not anymore amen what i used to be and what i used to struggle with and what used to trip me up doesn't anymore amen and it wasn't me that stopped it was his life in me amen that brought this body subject to the word amen and it's quickened this mortal body and i'd like to say it is continuing to quicken this mortal body because as we move on and drink from that fountain amen it's growing and it's manifestation it's growing in its power it's growing in its life because the more we drink and the more we grow the more we manifest that life it is quick in this mortal body but i say it is still quickening this mortal body and that word my faith in that word will have its last quickening effect and i won't have to worry about this body anymore let's all stand musicians if you could come the word is so good friends you know when that holy ghost was waved in this day it showed that the full potential is here the full potential for anything that the word says the life the full life of that full word is here present tense the full potential for the manifestation of any word is here but there's a bride here that is that is so tied into the word and so submissive to her bridegroom to her headship to the word that she'll she'll have the same relationship to her bridegroom that christ had to his father and he only did that which pleased his father and he only did that which the father showed him the full potential of the full life is here for full manifestation but this isn't for a pentecostal manifestation where we manifest to feel good where we take the gifts and play with them and take the promises and and play with them for our own satisfaction and our own pleasure but now there's a bride that's coming into full maturity that's coming into a full surrender through her headship and she will only do that which pleases her husband the full potential for the full life is here amen and when he says move you have all the power of heaven to back you up in that move because the word says so but she's not going around moving on her own she's not going around declaring her own she's just submissive to the preeminence of christ to the headship of christ and anything he calls for the potential is already here the life is already here that's what we walk in when you come up against an obstacle amen when you come up against an obstacle whether it be health or whether it be something you need deliverance for whatever whatever obstacle you face in this day amen the same power that was there that day to lift up peter when he was sinking and helping walk back to the boat is the same power that was here the same one that opened blinded eyes the same one that raised the dead the same life is here in you and i friends when you come up against an obstacle all that is here amen we don't need to get more it's already here we just need to move as he gives us inspiration and as he moves through us we need to have confidence in what he's already done and who he is and who's here with us not doing our own thing but as he moves us we've got the confidence to move forward because the life is here it is the rising of the sun it is the restoration of the bride tree it is the resurrection of the bride out of dead denominationalism and what happened to the bride as a whole is happening to you as an individual it is our easter i want this easter to mean more to you than any easter before that's what brother branham said i said it means more to me than it ever has it's not me it's him amen let's sing it's just worship the sun is up now i can go free these chains that were holding me i can no longer see her long trumpets out declaring my jubilee now that i once had is restored to me because the price has been paid all my sins washed away now and for all [Music] is [Music] declaring my

to be i know what he's done in this day i've got no doubts about my identity who i am i'm just tired of the immaturity [Music] but there's a cure for that and it's to lay in the presence of the sun delay under this word amen in the life of the word and let it bake all of the greenness out i'm ready i'm ready to be baked out under this bright and shining light to be all that he's called me to be friends let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord we thank you for this message lord god every time we play it it's a privilege every time that our ears hear that voice of the seventh angel lord it

you and you're here well we just surrendered to you and asked that you would take a greater preeminence in our lives that you would manifest yourself through the quickening power that's quick in this mortal flesh may it fully display all that you've called for the display to be in this hour may you show yourself through us well we love you for what you're doing we thank you we ask god that you have your way with us and take us from here and may we fulfill your purpose in this life we ask it in jesus christ's name amen the sun is up now i can go free the chains that were holding me i can no
