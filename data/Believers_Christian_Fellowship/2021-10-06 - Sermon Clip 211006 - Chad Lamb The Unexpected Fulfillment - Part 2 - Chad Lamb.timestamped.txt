[0:00] and i saw when the lamb
[0:03] when the lamb
[0:05] i saw when the lamb
[0:07] opened one of the seals
[0:09] and i heard it were the noise of thunder
[0:11] and one of the four beasts saying
[0:13] come and
[0:14] see brother branham said in the sixth
[0:17] seal
[0:18] so now tonight we have assembled here to
[0:21] hear your word and as we have been
[0:22] studying in this certain person of the
[0:24] scripture that the lamb was the only one
[0:27] that could open the seals or to loose
[0:29] them
[0:34] who opened those seals
[0:38] why did he open those seals
[0:40] how do you know the seals were open
[0:41] because of the seven thunders
[0:45] when did you hear the seven thunders
[0:48] in those consecutive nights of services
[0:51] when he was given the revelation of the
[0:53] unwritten word what john was not allowed
[0:55] to write when he was given the
[0:57] revelation of the unwritten word it tied
[0:59] you right back to the silence from
[1:02] revelation chapter eight they're the
[1:03] same thing the revelation of the
[1:05] unwritten word is revealing what was
[1:08] done in that silence what was that
[1:09] silence it's his coming
[1:12] and i'll just ask you a couple questions
[1:16] are you married to the lamb
[1:18] is this the invisible union
[1:20] is the wedding here
[1:22] then he has to be here
[1:24] you can't marry somebody who's not
[1:26] present
[1:27] now is the bride pregnant with the word
[1:30] has he pregnanted somebody he's not
[1:31] married to
[1:34] can he marry somebody when he's not
[1:35] present
[1:37] can he pregnant somebody without being
[1:39] here
[1:41] see it's it's so simple we can walk
[1:43] right over the top of it because we have
[1:45] in our mind we're looking for the
[1:47] denominational picture of a giant image
[1:50] of jesus coming down and we all stretch
[1:52] our hands out and we all begin to float
[1:54] up to him but that's a denominational
[1:56] idea
[1:59] it's not it's not the scripture it's not
[2:01] what brother benham told us amen
[2:04] he don't look for nail scars we look for
[2:06] the word made manifest
