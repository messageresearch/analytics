TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because that's what I've been meditating on. Not that we want to make each other mad, but I would I would rather rather I rather than being complicit to watching a train wreck. Amen. I'd rather say something &gt;&gt; rather than sitting BACK AND WATCH A FAMILY go off the rails and watch somebody go into utter destruction or a MAN GO OVER THE FALLS AND JUST keep my mouth shut because I can only say nice things and I can only compliment. I can only praise, but I can never question. I can never ask if everything's all right. I can never share a concern. God, help us not to be complicit. Help us not to be, Amen, sitting there watching, doing nothing, but let's be good friends &gt;&gt; and love one another with a real sacrificial love. A love that causes us to get out of our comfort zone. A love that causes causes us to risk ourselves for the benefit of somebody else. Risk our reputation. Risk somebody getting upset at us. risk being able to have an uncomfortable conversation. Amen. Risk it for the love and benefit of another human being &gt;&gt; or just stay safely behind our own safe shelter and have eyes to see but never a mouth to speak. So God help us. Help us to be true. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said remember love is corrective always. Genuine love is corrective. So you must be able to stand the correction. Brother said, "I've all my life I've cherished friends. There's nothing I love like people, and I wanted people to love me." I put this in here because Brother Brennan was a rejected little boy. All of his life. He wanted friends, and he loved people, and he felt the rejection all the time. And he said this also, "I was misunderstood so much to when I'd be talking on the street to someone and somebody else would come up." Well, they'd walk away and leave me stand. and I love people, but no one had nothing to do with me. I was what they called the black sheep. Here's a man with the rejection complex. And here's a man who just wants people to love him and he loves people. Amen. But this is man's been called to be a prophet of the age. And he's been a one who's got to cry out AGAINST SIN AND CALL OUT to the man going over the falls again and again and again. And what does he get in return? Rejection. Rejection. Rejection. &gt;&gt; But I didn't reject him. I'M THANKFUL HE CALLED OUT AGAINST SIN. I'M THANKFUL HE CALLED out against my problem, my issue, my church, MY FORM OF BELIEF. I THANK GOD THAT A MAN WHO didn't want to did. A MAN WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT did it anyways. A MAN WHO WASN'T HOSTILE, HE WASN'T CRITICAL. HE WASN'T CUTTING anybody down, but he was under a commission of God. And he loved human beings enough to tell the truth out OF THE BIBLE. AND I THANK GOD THAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD HE BE THE ONLY ONE IN AN AGE THAT DONE IT? WHY NOT WE? AMEN. FOLLOW SUITS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. To me, that's real love. Because that man did not want the rejection that followed being honest. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD GO STAND. HE WOULD BE PREACHING the truth. Amen. To ministers who were getting up OUT OF THE BACK AND WALKING OUT AND DROVES OF THEM were walking out. WHILE HE WAS PREACHING, I WAS NOT disobedient to the heavenly vision. AND HE HAD TO STAND there and finish his sermon. A MAN WHO WAS REJECTED AS a boy who just wanted people TO LOVE HIM HAD TO STAND THERE AND deliver what God placed ON HIS HEART WHILE PEOPLE WERE SHAKING their heads and walking out. &gt;&gt; And I thank God he did. &gt;&gt; To me, he's a friend.
