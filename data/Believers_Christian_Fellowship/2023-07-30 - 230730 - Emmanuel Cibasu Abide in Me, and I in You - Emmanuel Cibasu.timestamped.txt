[8:28] in your heart as we look around and see
[8:30] everything falling apart you can be
[8:32] seated we got a number of
[8:34] things this morning we want to go
[8:36] through here a couple of things I I just
[8:40] [Music]
[8:43] been struggling with her to give this
[8:44] testimony or not because I don't want to
[8:46] take too much time but I I just
[8:48] something just burning in my heart and
[8:51] um
[8:52] if a neighbor that recently her husband
[8:56] passed away from cancer and we got kind
[9:00] of close to him
[9:02] they're in his last
[9:03] couple of months that he was alive and
[9:06] he'd done some farming and he he told me
[9:09] that he had a while back he told me that
[9:12] he lost his wallet in the field when he
[9:14] was farming and they'd done they'd quite
[9:16] extensively looked for it they brought
[9:18] in dogs to sniff for it and all
[9:21] different things and you know kind of
[9:23] forgotten about it and
[9:25] uh
[9:27] she told me she said I just want you to
[9:29] go ahead and farm that land over there
[9:31] and when when I went over to plowette
[9:34] last Saturday
[9:36] she had told me before I went over she
[9:37] said you know Richard's wallet's over
[9:39] there in the field she goes see if you
[9:41] can find that and you know when she said
[9:44] that I she
[9:46] she said it in my mind I just dismissed
[9:48] it I said it's 20 acres there's no way
[9:50] I'm going to find a wallet in 20 acres
[9:52] and uh so as I as I went over and began
[9:55] to plow her request just was burning in
[9:58] my heart I don't know how to explain it
[9:59] other than that and this this testimony
[10:01] for me is deeper than just the testimony
[10:03] that I can even tell you but
[10:05] this is just burning in my heart and I I
[10:07] stopped as they come around the end of
[10:08] the field and I just bowed my head and I
[10:11] said Lord if you'd help me find that
[10:13] wallet
[10:14] I can't find that wallet out here but if
[10:16] you'd help me find that wallet I think
[10:18] it means something to Mary and uh and so
[10:21] I just kept plowing and you know it just
[10:23] goes to show the expectations when I
[10:25] prayed all I can tell you is both the
[10:28] unction to pray and the faith for the
[10:30] prayer I instantly knew I was going to
[10:33] find that wallet
[10:34] in 20 acres amen and I found out later
[10:38] he lost it 13 years ago
[10:41] and and I knew it had been some time
[10:43] they hadn't farmed it for a few years
[10:45] and
[10:46] and so as I was as I was going and I was
[10:48] just watching kind of as I was plowing
[10:50] brother Ron and I was plowing and and I
[10:53] was watching the dirt that was turning
[10:54] over to the side from the previous time
[10:56] I went around I thought you know the
[10:57] Lord's just going to turn that wallet up
[10:58] there on top of that and I'll be able to
[11:00] find that and you know there's a lot of
[11:02] real small rocks that look like wallets
[11:03] in a field and I and I was just kind of
[11:06] expecting and as I was every time I'd
[11:08] come around I'm listening to a message
[11:09] and just praying and not really thinking
[11:12] about it all the time and I'd come
[11:13] around this one end of the field and it
[11:14] just kept I kept remembering and I'm
[11:16] like oh I gotta look I gotta look
[11:19] and so I was thinking well the Lord must
[11:20] be trying to tell me it's down here at
[11:22] this end of the field
[11:23] and uh Saturday I plowed part of it and
[11:26] then Monday I went back and you know
[11:28] brother Jean preached on Sunday from
[11:30] spiritual to full manifestation I didn't
[11:33] think about this until later but as I
[11:35] was plowing on Monday I was clear at the
[11:37] other end of the field I was almost to
[11:38] the end of the field and brother Ron in
[11:41] the furrow as I you know you're not
[11:43] paying attention to where you're driving
[11:44] in the furrow where that's rolling it
[11:45] over but I just happened I turned back
[11:48] around from looking to plow and as as
[11:49] the tractor
[11:51] was coming down the furrow just before
[11:53] it disappeared in front of where the
[11:54] tire would be because it has big tires
[11:56] on the front I saw something Flash and I
[11:59] just knew I was like that's a wallet
[12:01] and as a try to make this a little
[12:03] shorter I I got out you know stomped on
[12:06] the brakes I go around there and I got
[12:08] and I just I saw it was a wallet and
[12:09] like all I wanted to know is like whose
[12:11] wallet is this you know you're just you
[12:13] just under that expectation at the same
[12:15] time almost disbelief like there's no
[12:17] way because if you understand farming a
[12:19] little bit like when you're plowing the
[12:22] plow rolls the dirt over immediately
[12:24] onto the previous and this wallet was
[12:27] buried seven inches deep in the ground
[12:29] closed and when the plow went over it
[12:32] the dead Furrow that's the one that
[12:35] rolls over and it leaves the trench for
[12:38] you to drive in the next time that plow
[12:40] went over the top of the wallet
[12:42] perfectly peeled every bit of dirt off
[12:45] the top of the wallet and left just a
[12:47] little Mark in the wallet just a tiny
[12:49] little scratch in the top of the wallet
[12:50] and it caused the wallet to open up
[12:53] so that the light from the Setting Sun
[12:55] on Monday would shine on the plastic on
[12:57] the inside so that I would see it
[13:00] and just a number of things I you know
[13:02] I'm looking at it just in disbelief
[13:05] this is crazy and then as I'm plowing
[13:07] them the more I'm going around and I'm I
[13:10] was thanking the lord obviously I'm like
[13:11] Lord that that was miraculous
[13:14] but really the testimony for me was not
[13:16] in in finding the wallet but it was if I
[13:20] could express it this way it was in God
[13:21] teaching me something about faith
[13:24] because
[13:27] I'm ashamed to say that many times God
[13:29] puts a little unction in your heart and
[13:30] and you just kind of brush it off
[13:33] but Saturday uh something was just real
[13:37] about it and the other thing was this
[13:39] wasn't something for me I wasn't asking
[13:41] for a need that I had Lord would you
[13:42] provide this need where it was a need
[13:45] for somebody else
[13:48] um
[13:50] and there was something real about the
[13:52] faith and as I went around that field
[13:54] like I knew I was going to find that
[13:56] wallet and you say how can you know that
[13:59] I don't know but it's just the simple
[14:01] Faith amen and we're looking for simple
[14:04] Faith to drop into our hearts and so
[14:05] hopefully that'll encourage somebody
[14:07] this morning Mary couldn't believe it
[14:10] she said how did that happen she said
[14:12] that was 13 years ago
[14:14] she couldn't remember exactly when it
[14:16] happened and as we opened the wallet up
[14:17] and kind of went through the contents
[14:19] there was a picture in there from his
[14:20] children
[14:21] one of his children from 2010 in January
[14:25] and of course the picture was no good
[14:27] but we could see the writing of the ink
[14:29] on the back of the picture so we knew
[14:30] that it happened in 2010 and she said
[14:33] how can that happen and it's just been
[14:36] an opportunity for us to last several
[14:38] months to witness God's power and Life
[14:41] to them as a neighbor and just praying
[14:43] that God will continue to let give us
[14:44] that opportunity to be able and what a
[14:47] witnessing testimony that is to say
[14:48] because God cares about a little widow
[14:51] woman amen and you can go right into the
[14:52] scripture and you can begin to show God
[14:55] cares for those amen sometimes who you
[14:58] would think would be just maybe just
[15:00] somebody that's insignificant but when
[15:02] you gotta got something in your heart
[15:03] God cares and so if God puts a need on
[15:05] your heart for somebody just pray you'll
[15:08] take it to your heart and that God would
[15:10] be able to give you Faith to be able to
[15:12] believe for that because one of these
[15:13] days we need faith for a body change
[15:15] amen and I believe that that's the kind
[15:18] of Faith we're going to have something
[15:19] that just transforms from me to he bless
[15:23] the Lord
[15:28] [Music]
[15:33] oh bless the Lord
[15:38] rape
[15:44] oh bless the Lord
[15:49] who Reigns my life with so much power

[18:14] praise be to his name
[18:16] are you happy this morning to be in the
[18:19] house of the Lord
[18:22] the prophet of God said that
[18:25] we are only Mortals once
[18:28] [Music]
[18:30] we are Mortals once
[18:34] before this service end
[18:37] we might end to be mortal
[18:41] and to be immortal
[18:44] and while we are Mortals
[18:47] this is the grandest opportunity
[18:49] that your entire body while you're still
[18:52] healthy
[18:53] you you while the voice could still
[18:57] sound God bless you musicians thank you
[19:02] you may be seated just for a little
[19:04] while
[19:11] the word of God has become so real
[19:15] so precious
[19:18] than
[19:20] when I am even in the basement
[19:23] I'm saying God
[19:25] even if this body will never be able to
[19:27] speak
[19:29] let the wars of the basement testify
[19:32] that I Heard a Voice
[19:34] I heard someone who loved you
[19:38] I walk around even the little trees in
[19:41] the backyard
[19:42] I speak I said even when my voice will
[19:46] no longer speak
[19:49] you testify that once I believe that
[19:52] your creator my creator
[19:54] and I love him
[19:59] anything around me around you
[20:02] should hear you in your best today
[20:10] God bless you we don't want to go into
[20:12] that and we just want to greet your this
[20:16] morning
[20:17] and I have greetings from our pastor
[20:20] brother Chad
[20:21] he stoled me and I said I'm gonna do it
[20:25] he said please greet all the saints from
[20:28] me and I said I'm going to do it brother
[20:31] so they just finished their final
[20:34] service
[20:36] today it was morning on our time and
[20:39] it's their afternoon I think we have six
[20:41] or seven hours difference
[20:43] so they are ready to
[20:46] come back home tomorrow starting
[20:49] tomorrow
[20:50] but I think we will I will ask you once
[20:52] again
[20:54] if you would stand would pray for our
[20:56] pastor
[20:57] and brother Jonathan if you would stand
[21:02] how many appreciate our pastor
[21:06] I'm taking this opportunity because he's
[21:08] not here so I don't want to embarrass
[21:10] him
[21:12] and I can tell you that's me
[21:15] absent the word of God in simplistic
[21:18] living in a man
[21:25] he
[21:26] the god the life of God within a man I'm
[21:30] not lifting him up
[21:32] has drawn me closer to him than ever
[21:35] before
[21:41] and I just want you to hold him you
[21:43] don't know what he might be what he's
[21:45] going through
[21:47] he is exhausted completely exhausted in
[21:50] the body
[21:52] I told him this morning like a little
[21:54] joke I said now Leo the two-thirds of
[21:57] your being could rest
[22:00] now they can enjoy their normal life for
[22:03] a little while
[22:06] his very life
[22:08] has been squeezed for you and me
[22:11] every single day
[22:14] and God has been sorry or at this place
[22:19] done
[22:21] it has to be a true Revelation but you
[22:23] can see him coming up walking up and
[22:25] down every day at this very sacred
[22:28] Pulpit I'm here standing with fear
[22:32] with trembling
[22:34] because this is not a man's job
[22:38] we cannot speak God's word
[22:41] God's word is God how can a man speak
[22:44] God
[22:45] they will take God to speak and to prove
[22:48] his own word
[22:51] just let's have by God's grace
[22:56] the reverence of what we have heard
[23:00] [Music]
[23:02] that's whole let's put every every every
[23:06] ounce of your being that you have today
[23:09] tomorrow doesn't belong to you
[23:12] but we're not here for fear or fear of
[23:14] hell no that's a that's a that's a
[23:17] religion
[23:18] we're here because we have a husband
[23:22] there's a love somewhere inside of a
[23:24] believer
[23:27] and we will discover
[23:29] what a Son of God is what a daughter of
[23:32] God is if God would allow us time
[23:35] while we're going to be praying for our
[23:36] pastor and brother Jonathan also
[23:39] remember my sister-in-law those that
[23:42] know brother
[23:43] Nick and sister Anna Maria they are in
[23:46] Florida my sister-in-law is sick so she
[23:51] has been along some three treatments
[23:55] and now she wants to do the natural ones
[24:01] that she has called in a prayer
[24:03] requested the congregation she said her
[24:06] home Church
[24:07] that you would remember her in prayer
[24:10] and if anyone else we can we will never
[24:13] get tired of coming to God to praying
[24:16] praying
[24:18] is a fellowship with God I don't want to
[24:21] fellowship with him just once a day
[24:22] twice three times
[24:25] pray every time
[24:27] I speak like a foolish speak to the
[24:30] rocks
[24:31] said you rock listen a Son of God is

[29:20] to you in Jesus Christ ever pray amen
[29:24] God bless you
[29:26] and let's turn to the Book of John
[29:30] chapter 15 thank you for keeping you
[29:33] standing up
[29:34] but you know what that let those legs
[29:37] exercise one day they will be cold
[29:40] someone has to carry them somewhere
[29:44] let them glorify God is just standing to
[29:47] read his holy and precious word
[29:50] we're living in the greatest day that
[29:53] when he opens he he unveils himself
[29:56] it's something becomes a reality the
[30:00] world is not the world is fake
[30:02] but your or not of this world use those
[30:06] legs because they are not meant to be
[30:08] here
[30:11] John 15
[30:14] starting with the first verse
[30:17] and it's just uh
[30:21] as scripture that you are familiar with
[30:23] it's a little bible study I've been
[30:26] going through and just helped me if you
[30:29] I know you have prayed for me you're
[30:30] poor if you don't pour I just call
[30:33] Brother John back and I walk back and
[30:35] said sit down
[30:36] so please Paul
[30:39] he goes and this is
[30:41] as we're reading it
[30:45] as brother shot has mentioned one time
[30:48] many times and we have mentioned
[30:51] the word of God becomes so real that
[30:53] when you're reading it you want to
[30:55] rehearse it over and over I would have
[30:57] started and said I am
[31:00] I
[31:02] I am I am three times just so I can know
[31:05] who's speaking
[31:08] the one who's speaking he's the Creator
[31:10] himself
[31:13] so we're reading this is the grandest
[31:16] opportunity the creator has given you
[31:19] to read his word to read about him
[31:23] said I am the True Vine
[31:26] and my father is the husbandman
[31:30] every
[31:32] just let's this is not we love some
[31:34] but this is his specific every and he
[31:40] told you in the first one that I am the
[31:43] True Vine
[31:44] and my father is the husband man now
[31:48] listen the work of the husbandman
[31:51] this husband man is a faithful
[31:53] husbandman
[31:55] because one day on Calvary
[31:58] the Lord Jesus was hanging there only
[32:02] with one scripture left One Promise
[32:06] from a man that who saw corruption
[32:09] corruption himself
[32:11] from the mouth of David David saw
[32:13] corruption but the word he spoke out
[32:16] that I will not see my Holy One seek
[32:18] corruption
[32:21] the Vine
[32:22] stood on that word and he knew that my
[32:25] husband is is faithful
[32:28] and he fulfilled that one scripture
[32:31] and now this husband man is going to
[32:33] make sure that every
[32:38] he has a job every
[32:41] every branch it's not a group
[32:46] every branch in me that beareth not
[32:49] fruit he takes away
[32:51] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[32:55] purges it that it may bring forth more
[32:58] fruit
[32:59] now
[33:02] you may be said it because it might be a
[33:04] little bit lengthy
[33:07] just asking for God to bless the reading
[33:10] of his word
[33:12] and in verse through it says
[33:18] now
[33:20] ye are clean through the word which I
[33:24] have spoken unto you
[33:26] so if this word now pertains only to
[33:31] those 12 disciples
[33:33] two thousand years ago
[33:36] then
[33:37] Judas
[33:40] is going to be inheriting verse 4.
[33:47] but we know that he did not inherit
[33:49] verse 4.
[33:52] so if this now is not the now 12 2000
[33:57] years ago because that would put us all
[34:00] outside it will only have 12 people even
[34:02] Judas included
[34:06] because he spoke to Jesus Judas as well
[34:09] but this is the now of 2000 years ago
[34:13] this is right now
[34:15] because if you do believe that this is
[34:18] the right now then the verse four
[34:21] belongs to you
[34:23] then the remaining of the scripture
[34:25] reading belongs to you if it only
[34:28] belonged to the 12 disciples we would
[34:32] stop here we said praise God the 12
[34:35] disciples were spoken to they were clean
[34:38] Judas included let's close the book and
[34:42] go home
[34:46] this now is right now
[34:51] and right now it has to be opened to you
[34:56] you know that many people live but they
[34:58] don't live right now
[35:02] they live in a mirage
[35:05] of yesterday
[35:07] but never realized that they live right
[35:09] now
[35:12] we are clean through the word which I
[35:16] have spoken unto you what does the
[35:19] cleansing
[35:21] his word
[35:24] the word of Noah the time of Noah will
[35:26] never cleanse you
[35:31] the word of the time of Moses will never
[35:33] cleanse you
[35:35] you will gain some knowledge some
[35:38] history
[35:40] there's only one specific word that will
[35:44] cleanse you
[35:45] it's the word of your time
[35:51] abiding me and I in you
[35:54] so we're in verse 4.
[35:57] abide in me and I in you that's the
[36:00] little title of our sermon this morning
[36:05] and this is all God wanted
[36:09] by creating man
[36:13] he wanted this portion of this verse
[36:17] he wanted you and I to abide in him
[36:21] and he can abide
[36:23] within us within each individual
[36:27] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[36:30] itself except it abide in the vine no
[36:33] more can he accept he abide in me well
[36:37] brother and sister this should give at
[36:40] least every single person the rest to
[36:44] rest from every trial every trying
[36:47] you're trying to achieve something just
[36:50] take your hands off say you know what
[36:53] no it says no more can he
[36:59] except he abide in me
[37:02] pushing trying to get something done
[37:05] trying to prove something you can do
[37:08] nothing
[37:14] this is the greatest invitation
[37:18] that God has ever given to man
[37:24] to abide in him in this great
[37:29] Jehovah
[37:30] to abide within you
[37:34] I am the vine now he has to tell us he
[37:38] was speaking about every branch
[37:41] now he's going to openly tell us what
[37:45] branches are
[37:49] with our
[37:51] Pentecostal maybe background or Baptist
[37:54] background we know that the branches
[37:55] speaks of man but we want to hear it
[37:58] from his own lips
[38:01] I am the vine and ye are the brain
[38:05] branches
[38:07] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[38:11] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[38:14] without me
[38:15] ye can do nothing he is insisting again
[38:20] without him ye can do nothing just take
[38:26] out your the paper maybe a notebook
[38:28] write out every every achievement you
[38:32] want to achieve on this Earth
[38:39] anything you can do you can achieve
[38:43] meaning it's empty
[38:46] because what he wants to do through you
[38:49] it only comes one way
[38:52] when you are abiding in him that's when
[38:56] something real
[38:59] something real
[39:01] of your own purpose on Earth happens
[39:03] when you are abiding within him
[39:07] six says
[39:09] if a man abide not in me
[39:11] his cast forth as a branch
[39:15] and is withered and Men gather them
[39:19] and cast them into the fire and they are
[39:21] burnt
[39:23] this is very critical
[39:25] because
[39:26] when
[39:28] we don't know how to check if a man is
[39:32] abiding or is not abiding
[39:36] we don't know how to check when he's
[39:39] already cast out
[39:40] it's a branch or not
[39:44] we have no idea when he's withered when
[39:48] he start start withering withering
[39:53] the only time we notice is when he's
[39:55] already picked up by mind of man
[39:57] When someone tells you someone said this
[40:02] a group of people said this
[40:04] so we're only realizing at the fourth
[40:07] level the three levels before we don't
[40:11] know
[40:13] and Once the mind of man picks you up it
[40:15] has only one destination fire
[40:20] to be burnt
[40:21] seven says if he abide in me and my
[40:24] words then he is clarifying now
[40:28] that abiding is not just a little single
[40:32] place or some
[40:36] some proverb
[40:39] it's when his words
[40:42] when you are abiding in his words you
[40:46] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[40:48] done unto you
[40:50] here in is my father glorified that he
[40:54] bear much fruits so shall he be my
[40:58] disciple
[41:00] it's it's as I told you
[41:04] it's just a Bible study
[41:07] and it's precious I just if we would
[41:11] take time to go through every word in
[41:15] this scriptures would take us months
[41:17] here
[41:19] they're so precious
[41:21] and the prophet of God said this
[41:26] in the mess in the Paradox in 1961 a
[41:30] little quotation
[41:33] that took my breath away
[41:36] simple
[41:38] but it has to be something that God
[41:39] opens up to you he said you are not here
[41:43] here just to eat and drink and to sleep
[41:49] and to get up and work
[41:52] and then go back eat and drink and sleep
[41:55] again
[41:58] he summarized Our Lives
[42:02] you're not here just to eat and drink
[42:04] and and to sleep and to get up and work
[42:07] and then go back eat and drink and sleep
[42:10] again
[42:11] you are here to be Sons and Daughters of
[42:16] God
[42:17] you are here to take your position and
[42:22] place in Christ
[42:25] this is the prophet saying
[42:27] he said and I am here
[42:31] this morning to call you
[42:37] I would want you to take
[42:40] this calling from the prophet
[42:43] personally to you this morning
[42:47] you are here to be Sons and Daughters of
[42:50] God you are here to take your position
[42:53] in place in Christ and I am here
[42:58] this morning
[43:00] to call you
[43:04] Sons and Daughters of God
[43:08] entitles a lot
[43:12] for instance if I only say
[43:14] a mother what a mother means
[43:20] I would explain probably a few
[43:24] attributes of that
[43:26] but I cannot fully grasp it because I'm
[43:28] not a mother
[43:32] meaning when you say a mother
[43:34] they are just a whole lot to that
[43:39] it's not only because she has children
[43:41] sitting by her
[43:43] no there's there's a more than that
[43:49] Sons and Daughters of God
[43:51] it encompasses a lot
[43:54] we will see as we will be going down if
[43:58] we'll get to it
[43:59] in another message the prophet of God
[44:01] said God put you here to be Sons and
[44:05] Daughters of God and if you fail to get
[44:08] that
[44:10] you fail to receive the very purpose of
[44:13] God
[44:15] the very purpose God put you on Earth to
[44:18] be that's right no matter how honest
[44:22] how decent
[44:24] how moral you might be how good you
[44:28] might be What a fine sociable fellow you
[44:31] might be you'll still miss the calling
[44:37] unless you serve the Lord Jesus and
[44:41] become a son and a daughter of God
[44:48] no matter how good a neighbor you might
[44:51] be
[44:51] how good anything excuse me
[44:55] good anything you may be that's all good
[45:00] and we appreciate that but my brother
[45:03] until you become a Son of God you fail
[45:08] to answer the purpose that God put you
[45:11] on the earth to be
[45:21] you remember the in the Book of John
[45:24] first one
[45:26] John 1
[45:29] 10 through 12.
[45:31] Jesus was in the world
[45:34] as I might be reading it to my read if
[45:36] you want
[45:38] John
[45:39] you suggests to give the background John
[45:42] 1
[45:45] verse 10.
[45:49] Jesus he was in the world and the world
[45:53] was made by him and the world knew him
[45:56] not
[45:57] he came unto his own this is two
[46:01] thousand years ago
[46:04] he then he came on to his own and his
[46:08] owner received him not
[46:11] but as many as received him
[46:14] to them gave him power
[46:18] just listen what it takes to become Son
[46:20] of God or a daughter of God
[46:23] it's it's not just a simple slogan
[46:26] it takes power not of men the power of
[46:31] God the prophet of God said we can enjoy
[46:33] blessings that's the difference between
[46:35] blessings and the power of God he said
[46:37] the power of God when he comes I have no
[46:39] life within me
[46:42] now to become a son of daughter of God
[46:45] you don't call yourself
[46:48] you cannot make yourself
[46:51] it will take the power the same power
[46:54] that created the Earth the Heaven and
[46:56] Earth
[46:57] that same power had to be included to
[47:01] make you a son and daughter of God
[47:04] because it encompasses a lot as we will
[47:08] be going through that you will find out
[47:09] a son or daughter of God
[47:12] it is a people
[47:15] that's back with God in Fellowship again
[47:24] Aaron
[47:26] Aaron in the Old Testament
[47:28] had that opportunity once a year
[47:32] to experience what a son or daughter of
[47:35] God was
[47:39] once a year
[47:48] he says but 12
[47:51] John 1 12 but as many as received him
[47:57] many remember that many will receive him
[48:00] where
[48:01] during this time
[48:03] when he came his own received him not
[48:07] very few
[48:08] had that opportunity to receive him but
[48:11] these many is not them it's right now
[48:14] this time
[48:16] and I would like I'm inviting you to
[48:19] receive him
[48:24] but as many as received him to them gave
[48:28] he power
[48:30] this is God
[48:32] giving power to a person a human being
[48:36] said you know what
[48:37] I want you to become son and daughter to
[48:40] me
[48:41] and you cannot do it on your own
[48:44] here's my power
[48:49] it takes power to do that
[48:52] if he gives you power he knows there's
[48:54] another Power there that you have to
[48:56] overcome
[48:58] else he would not have given you power
[49:02] he gave him power to become the sons of
[49:05] God even to them that believe on his
[49:08] name
[49:11] now coming back to
[49:13] our scripture reading
[49:16] of John 15.
[49:20] the prophet of God said that
[49:22] in letting off the pressure he said now
[49:24] we know that this world is a creation
[49:27] and before the there can be a creation
[49:30] there has to be a creator of that
[49:33] creation
[49:34] and this Creator expresses himself in
[49:38] the creation this creator
[49:41] God
[49:43] expresses himself
[49:45] in his creation
[49:48] we will just hold on that
[49:51] and this Creator expresses himself in
[49:54] the creation if we did not even have a
[49:57] Bible we would still know the truth
[50:01] just as we do
[50:03] the Bible only sets it in order
[50:08] it's not the Bible that
[50:10] gives you the truth to know that God is
[50:13] God
[50:14] because job didn't have the Bible
[50:17] but he knew how did he know he only
[50:20] looked at the botany life
[50:23] a tree and a flower and the Bible the
[50:26] prophet of God says it only sets it in
[50:30] order
[50:31] every human being every human life
[50:35] there's a way they can know if they can
[50:39] only surrender to God to know there's a
[50:41] God somewhere without the Bible
[50:43] even those that can only have the the
[50:47] Quran in their in in in their their
[50:50] homes
[50:51] somewhere there's a way for them to know
[50:55] that there's God
[50:57] the Bible will only set that in order
[51:01] and you will study nature there's a
[51:04] great thing in nature everything that I
[51:06] look at and God has made he is the
[51:09] author of nature nature runs in
[51:13] continuity
[51:15] all nature runs about the same you
[51:17] notice everything as I have said I
[51:21] believe last evening that nature
[51:23] testifies of God we know that God
[51:25] expresses himself in his creation
[51:28] the Creator himself and nature testifies
[51:32] of him
[51:33] the creation testify of the Creator the
[51:36] Creator expresses through the creation
[51:39] if you never had a Bible you could still
[51:42] watch nature and know that this Bible is
[51:46] the truth
[51:49] meaning
[51:51] there's no
[51:52] way to hide out
[51:57] no way to hide out
[51:58] even even Jesus himself when he came on
[52:01] Earth
[52:03] I don't because in that time the scroll
[52:06] the Torah the Old Testament as we call
[52:08] now was a specific
[52:12] book that only the priests would carry
[52:15] it was not at any any any everybody's
[52:19] availability
[52:21] so even when Jesus came on Earth he had
[52:23] to borrow it he has to ask it was given
[52:26] to him in the temple when he wanted to
[52:29] read the book of a scripture of Isaiah
[52:31] 61. they had to deliver him the book The
[52:36] Scroll
[52:38] he didn't have it himself he didn't own
[52:40] it
[52:41] simple people could not own this the
[52:43] Bible as we're owning it today it used
[52:46] to be precious
[52:48] Jesus himself he had he didn't have it
[52:51] they had to give it to him in the temple
[52:54] and after he read it handed it back to
[52:57] the minister
[53:00] why because
[53:02] in the volume of the books
[53:05] he was contained
[53:07] the book spoke of him now we're looking
[53:10] at
[53:11] so nobody can justify himself for not
[53:13] having the Bible
[53:15] or not having or not having the Bible
[53:18] because nature testifies of him
[53:22] we can see again as the prophet of God
[53:25] says
[53:27] that
[53:28] just going to the our scripture now so
[53:31] we've seen the chapter 15.
[53:35] but God has created
[53:37] his creation
[53:39] he has created luminaries the Sun the
[53:43] moon the stars he expresses himself
[53:46] through his creation
[53:48] he has created the animal life
[53:51] He has expressed himself through
[53:54] uh lamb A4
[53:58] Bullock goat sheep He has expressed
[54:02] himself through the fowl of the air you
[54:04] can say the ego darling in in pigeons
[54:08] he also expressed himself in the botany
[54:11] life
[54:13] and for this reading of the scripture
[54:16] God the Lord Jesus is bypassing all
[54:20] those creations
[54:22] that men could see I see a niggle flying
[54:25] I see the Samoan hen standing there
[54:27] those that could give more meaning to
[54:30] little humble simple people
[54:34] but the Lord Jesus is coming down to a
[54:36] level of he wants and this is a critical
[54:41] moment after he has
[54:43] spent the Passover his last passover
[54:45] with his disciples
[54:48] in John 13.
[54:50] in John 14 as we have heard him many
[54:52] times that he went to prepare us bodies
[54:57] missions bodies
[55:00] now it's chapter 15. God is Not
[55:04] expressing himself Through The
[55:06] Luminaries the Stars the Moon
[55:10] the sun is not expressing himself
[55:13] through the Eagles but he is coming to
[55:16] express himself through a botany life
[55:20] that even a simple a simple peasant
[55:24] could get him what his meaning
[55:27] he's coming here laying himself down he
[55:30] said I am the True Vine
[55:36] not I am the Vine
[55:40] I am the True Vine I looked up the word
[55:44] true
[55:52] it says
[55:55] in the Greek blessing it says
[55:58] it's that which has not only the name
[56:01] and risk resemblance
[56:04] but the real nature corresponding to the
[56:09] name
[56:10] in every respect correspond
[56:13] corresponding to the idea signified by
[56:17] the name
[56:18] real true genuine
[56:22] true is opposite to what is fictitious
[56:28] it's opposite to counter counterfeit
[56:32] it Opposite to imaginary
[56:35] opposite to simulated or pretended
[56:40] it's opposite to what is imperfect
[56:45] it's opposite to frail
[56:48] it's opposite to uncertain meaning when
[56:51] he says that he is making sure that we
[56:54] get it
[56:55] he is the true the certain the perfect
[57:00] the genuine the real one why because
[57:05] there's a false one
[57:10] he does not leave his children
[57:12] in confusion
[57:14] he said
[57:15] I am the True Vine meaning that there is
[57:19] also a false one
[57:23] the prophet of God in the fusion Church
[57:25] age he said there is a true church
[57:28] in a forced church I told you this is a
[57:32] Bible study one verse will take us
[57:34] probably I don't know how maybe we'll
[57:36] spend we'll finish with only two or
[57:38] three verses
[57:39] yes
[57:41] there is a true and and you know those
[57:44] that sleep I always have a little note
[57:46] here put your name and then I'll give it
[57:48] to the deacons so we can make sure that
[57:50] we we balance on that side
[57:53] um
[57:57] there is
[57:58] a fourth one
[58:01] and the prophet of God could tell us how
[58:04] the false one
[58:05] what it is because you don't want to
[58:07] take my little mind I have none here
[58:10] the prophet of God says there is a true
[58:13] church and a false Church
[58:15] there is a True Vine and a false Vine
[58:20] now let's find out what is the false
[58:23] Vine so we can we can at least
[58:25] understand what the true one how would
[58:27] would it look like
[58:30] he said see how it started out in the
[58:32] early church
[58:34] it was called Deeds
[58:38] look how this
[58:40] false Vine comes in our lives
[58:44] it comes through Deeds
[58:49] very
[58:51] very innocent
[58:54] unseen undetected
[59:00] then it became a Doctrine going step by
[59:04] step
[59:07] it became the standard
[59:12] it became the unbending way you can no
[59:17] longer bend it
[59:22] look how this false Vine
[59:25] presents to us to every individual
[59:31] now the True Vine has sent us his
[59:35] prophet
[59:36] to uncover the false Vine
[59:39] he comes in as Deeds something that you
[59:43] do you start doing maybe because someone
[59:46] was doing it
[59:47] maybe because you saw it somewhere maybe
[59:50] you thought it because we know maybe you
[59:53] had the desire for it you will see that
[59:56] the desire the word lust and desire are
[1:00:00] the same word
[1:00:02] the only thing is lust is a desire of
[1:00:05] man
[1:00:08] which is different from the desire of
[1:00:10] God anything that's man inspired men's
[1:00:13] desire it might not look like sin is
[1:00:17] lost
[1:00:21] it becomes this true this false Vine
[1:00:25] comes in sneaks in
[1:00:27] as the Deeds
[1:00:32] this helps each and every one of us
[1:00:34] because now we can start looking inward
[1:00:38] forget about the one sitting on your
[1:00:40] side in front of you in the back let's
[1:00:42] look inwards
[1:00:44] what Deeds do we have
[1:00:49] what is motivating us what is what is
[1:00:51] driving our entire purpose of being
[1:00:54] of living
[1:00:56] Deeds unsettled
[1:01:00] it became a Doctrine you can start
[1:01:03] speaking about it you can start maybe
[1:01:05] presenting to someone else
[1:01:08] it becomes presentable it becomes
[1:01:10] something to speak about from something
[1:01:12] a subject
[1:01:14] it became a standard
[1:01:16] it grows up
[1:01:19] and finally
[1:01:20] it becomes unbending way you cannot bend
[1:01:23] it anymore
[1:01:28] it finally took over
[1:01:30] and God was pushed aside look at this
[1:01:34] false Vine it came in as a deed look
[1:01:36] what is happening
[1:01:38] the True Vine God is pushed aside
[1:01:40] because there's another Vine coming in
[1:01:43] oh aren't you glad that God has sent you
[1:01:45] this precious message how would you how
[1:01:48] would you know how do you know how to
[1:01:49] live
[1:01:54] oh it started so small
[1:01:58] so quietly
[1:02:00] so inoffensively
[1:02:04] I like these precious words from God's
[1:02:08] mouth himself
[1:02:10] it looks so good
[1:02:13] it doesn't look bad
[1:02:15] it
[1:02:16] seemed so sound
[1:02:20] because it's become a Doctrine you can
[1:02:22] speak about it
[1:02:24] you can present it we know that in the
[1:02:26] Garden of Eden
[1:02:27] the same false Vine came in
[1:02:31] Adam so bright
[1:02:33] the Deeds were came in and then we start
[1:02:36] growing as a Doctrine
[1:02:38] and she could share the doctrine with
[1:02:40] her her husband
[1:02:45] partaking of the force of Art
[1:02:52] then it caught a hold
[1:02:55] and like a python
[1:02:58] like that deadly snake
[1:03:01] it squeezed out that very breath and
[1:03:05] killed all the spiritual spirituality
[1:03:07] there was in the church oh that false
[1:03:12] Vine is subtle
[1:03:14] look where the Prophet is starting with
[1:03:16] the Vine the fourth one
[1:03:20] coming in as deed
[1:03:25] Doctrine
[1:03:26] standard
[1:03:27] it becomes unbending way
[1:03:31] shizad the True Vine outside
[1:03:34] so sound so inoffensive
[1:03:38] quietly
[1:03:39] so good
[1:03:41] oh that false Vine is subtle
[1:03:45] it is like an angel of Light listen how
[1:03:48] the prophet described describes him
[1:03:51] it's like an angel of Light
[1:03:53] until it gets a hold on you
[1:04:01] are we still there
[1:04:08] the prophet of God's
[1:04:12] by God's divine revelation is uncovering
[1:04:15] this false Vine
[1:04:17] to let you see who Christ is
[1:04:21] the true man why did he say that he is
[1:04:23] the true vine
[1:04:25] the prophet of God says this in the
[1:04:27] resume of the church he said we learn in
[1:04:30] no uncertain terms that this false Vine
[1:04:34] is the vine of Satan
[1:04:38] so Jesus by describing telling I am the
[1:04:41] True Vine he's telling you to watch out
[1:04:44] there was a Vine of Satan up there
[1:04:49] there
[1:04:52] Gathering is of him oh
[1:04:56] it's becoming a church
[1:05:01] they meet in the name of God look how
[1:05:05] close this false bind is
[1:05:08] they meet in the name of God in lie that
[1:05:12] they are
[1:05:13] Christ
[1:05:17] what's a force Vine is becoming day
[1:05:21] this fourth Vine
[1:05:24] is becoming day
[1:05:28] they preach
[1:05:30] they teach they baptize they worship
[1:05:34] they partake of various rights given by
[1:05:37] Christ to the church yet they are not of
[1:05:41] God it becomes not a people
[1:05:47] but since they say they are God will
[1:05:51] hold them responsible and each and in
[1:05:54] each age he speaks of them and to them
[1:05:57] they remind us of Balaam he had the
[1:06:01] prophetic office he knew the proper
[1:06:04] approach unto God as demonstrated in the
[1:06:07] sacrifice of the clean beasts
[1:06:10] yet he was not a true Prophet for when
[1:06:14] God told him not to go to honor balak
[1:06:16] with his presence he sought to go anyway
[1:06:19] for he was motivated
[1:06:23] by his lust
[1:06:27] for gold and Prestige I remember Brother
[1:06:30] Kyle preaching that on Wednesday
[1:06:34] the the the the
[1:06:36] Balaam was looking at the children of
[1:06:39] Israel they had the same same sacrifice
[1:06:44] they had Bullocks they have everything
[1:06:46] just was just similar same way no
[1:06:49] different difference but what they
[1:06:51] forgot to see
[1:06:53] was that smitten Rock
[1:06:57] that shout in the camp
[1:06:59] that light that was there they couldn't
[1:07:01] recognize that so this false Vine
[1:07:04] is always on the same Trail
[1:07:08] and the prophet of God say notice they
[1:07:11] look the same they are anointed the same
[1:07:14] but noticed by their fruit
[1:07:21] how do you know it
[1:07:25] by their fruit
[1:07:29] we don't speak fruit
[1:07:31] fruits all alive
[1:07:41] so the prophet of God is showing us the
[1:07:44] characteristics of this Vine and you
[1:07:46] know what it always grows right
[1:07:50] alongside the True Vine
[1:07:55] very very sneaky
[1:07:58] your eyes and my eyes will never detect
[1:08:01] them
[1:08:03] there's no power in us to detect it
[1:08:05] takes the power of God to come and
[1:08:07] detect them you see Adam and the serpent
[1:08:10] they were closer together
[1:08:13] Cain and Abel same room same roof Esau
[1:08:17] and Jacob
[1:08:19] Moses and Balaam
[1:08:20] Jesus and Judah even from the same tribe
[1:08:25] the church and the bride
[1:08:27] closer together
[1:08:32] we don't want to spend too much time on
[1:08:34] that we come now on the second verse
[1:08:38] he said every branch in me that's a John
[1:08:40] 15. every branch in me that beareth not
[1:08:44] fruit he taketh away
[1:08:46] it shocked me to know that could some
[1:08:49] Branch be in him in that bearing fruit
[1:08:55] could Branch be in this True Vine
[1:08:59] and not bearing fruit
[1:09:02] that that the husbandman has to take it
[1:09:05] away
[1:09:07] that's a shocking
[1:09:10] in this very true vine
[1:09:14] there are branches
[1:09:17] because the husband man has to go every
[1:09:20] inspect to everyone every every branch
[1:09:24] within there's some there
[1:09:27] that will not bear fruit
[1:09:30] that will
[1:09:33] for which the husband men
[1:09:36] will have to intervene
[1:09:40] to cast it away
[1:09:43] in there
[1:09:46] that is
[1:09:48] I'm still wrapping my my mind around
[1:09:50] that
[1:09:51] and the prophet of God in the the
[1:09:53] message serves we would see Jesus he
[1:09:56] said now when he was on Earth he said I
[1:10:01] am the vine and ye are the branches
[1:10:04] now the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:10:09] the vine only puts the energy into the
[1:10:12] branch
[1:10:13] and the branch bears fruit
[1:10:18] you don't gather fruit of the of the
[1:10:20] Vine
[1:10:21] you gather it off the branch
[1:10:25] every branch in me that bringeth forth
[1:10:29] not good fruit
[1:10:33] he cuts it off
[1:10:36] the husbandman does that
[1:10:39] something is in this True Vine
[1:10:42] that is not appropriate
[1:10:46] not in the false Vine in the True Value
[1:10:50] he cuts it off
[1:10:51] prunes it the church and and anymore
[1:10:57] and he goes He said
[1:10:59] I am the viney or the branches and every
[1:11:02] branch that brings the fourth fruit is
[1:11:04] pruned and fixed up and purged
[1:11:06] so it will bring more but the branch
[1:11:09] that does not bear fruit is plucked off
[1:11:14] it was where
[1:11:16] nothing the false mind
[1:11:19] in the true word
[1:11:27] now the branches is the one that bears
[1:11:30] fruit not the Vine
[1:11:33] so with the church
[1:11:36] is left as the branches
[1:11:39] so your eyes and my eyes is the only
[1:11:42] eyes that God has on the Earth
[1:11:46] your lips and my lips is his branch
[1:11:50] he energizes it to bring forth fruit in
[1:11:54] our ears is his ears our hands to do
[1:11:57] good is his hand our feet or his feet to
[1:12:01] carry us to church and to do good bless
[1:12:05] all the feed that beareth good Tiding so
[1:12:09] he's talking about the branches here
[1:12:11] just let's be have a time just to digest
[1:12:16] what
[1:12:17] the word and the prophet I was telling
[1:12:19] about this
[1:12:21] branch
[1:12:22] because it's every
[1:12:25] this there is no way to hide behind any
[1:12:28] person
[1:12:29] behind the husband behind the wife
[1:12:32] behind the mother a father there's no
[1:12:34] way because this husband man will make
[1:12:38] sure that every branch is checked
[1:12:43] every branch is checked is it producing
[1:12:47] is it bearing fruits or it's not
[1:12:56] the book of Hebrews you don't have to
[1:12:57] turn I can read it just to ensure that
[1:12:59] this is every branch
[1:13:02] it's the opposite of some or all
[1:13:06] every bridge
[1:13:09] this branch
[1:13:11] will have to be checked
[1:13:15] this Branch here will have to be checked
[1:13:18] not by the preaching
[1:13:20] will be chipped by the fruit
[1:13:25] if the fruits are not found on this
[1:13:27] branch
[1:13:28] there's no other way but being plucked
[1:13:31] It Off
[1:13:33] that's the only way to remain in that
[1:13:35] vine the True Vine
[1:13:40] Hebrews 12 4-7 said ye have not yet
[1:13:45] resisted unto blood
[1:13:47] this is Paul speaking
[1:13:49] striving against the sin
[1:13:51] he's telling us that each and every one
[1:13:54] of us we have not resisted unto blood
[1:13:57] resisting against the sin what is sin
[1:13:59] it's unbelief
[1:14:01] unbelief will come in every fashion
[1:14:04] every single day to knock at your door
[1:14:10] and Paul said we have not resisted unto
[1:14:14] blood
[1:14:16] striving against this unbelief
[1:14:19] of this day
[1:14:21] and ye have forgotten the exaltation
[1:14:24] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:14:27] my son despise not thou the chest
[1:14:32] chastening of the Lord
[1:14:35] nor faint when thou are rebuked of him
[1:14:39] look who is doing the chastening
[1:14:42] it's not Satan chastening you
[1:14:46] the Lord himself
[1:14:49] will ensure that every branch
[1:14:52] is chastened
[1:14:55] will ensure that every branch is rebuked
[1:15:02] I wish it was a party
[1:15:04] but this is not a party joining
[1:15:10] for whom the Lord loveth listen to that
[1:15:14] want God to love you listen to what he's
[1:15:17] going to be doing for you
[1:15:18] for whom the Lord loveth he chastenth
[1:15:25] and scourgeous
[1:15:28] every this is not a few
[1:15:32] every son whom he received
[1:15:37] every
[1:15:40] when we're reading something like this
[1:15:43] and forgive me if maybe I'm acting a
[1:15:46] little strange here but there's a lot of
[1:15:48] reverence and fear inside
[1:15:52] not fear of hell
[1:15:54] fear that father
[1:15:57] if I cannot live it to it
[1:15:59] what would be my purpose on Earth
[1:16:03] to come to eat to drink to sleep to wake
[1:16:07] up to go to work come back again and
[1:16:10] sleep again
[1:16:12] that would be a waste
[1:16:14] and God cannot create you for waste
[1:16:20] there got to be something So Glorious so
[1:16:24] precious
[1:16:26] for which your life is here
[1:16:34] seven says if he enjoy chastening
[1:16:39] God deals with you as with Psalms
[1:16:43] for what son is he
[1:16:46] whom the father chastenth and not
[1:16:53] there's no way to escape
[1:16:58] and it's for your good and my good
[1:17:05] his chastening
[1:17:08] it's at every sun and every Doris door
[1:17:12] and you will see why he has to be at the
[1:17:14] door of every son and every every dollar
[1:17:18] because it's molding something
[1:17:20] it's taking you off out of a shell
[1:17:24] that he can expose you to his son
[1:17:27] s-u-m-s-o-n
[1:17:33] the prophet of God in the restoration of
[1:17:35] the bright tree
[1:17:37] 1962 goes
[1:17:39] God is the husbandman of this tree
[1:17:44] but Jesus told us in 15 1.
[1:17:49] he takes care of it
[1:17:51] he watches over his heritage
[1:17:55] listen to
[1:17:57] the duties that the husbandman has in
[1:18:00] this True Vine
[1:18:03] he's not just getting them together
[1:18:05] let's this let's get them grow let's get
[1:18:07] no no no no no no he is watching over
[1:18:11] his heritage
[1:18:16] what is his heritage
[1:18:21] his own word
[1:18:26] this sons and daughters
[1:18:28] they only have one end goal
[1:18:33] they are to become no less than the word
[1:18:38] itself
[1:18:40] that's what's the Son and Daughter of
[1:18:42] God is
[1:18:44] he said I'm a son of God
[1:18:46] you want to say that you are word God's
[1:18:49] word
[1:18:50] I'm a daughter of God
[1:18:52] I am God's word
[1:18:56] that's the equal sign
[1:18:59] and for you to become that word
[1:19:02] that word is the creator it's life it
[1:19:06] takes God's power to make you that word
[1:19:17] the prophet of God says he watches over
[1:19:20] his word that's his Heritage he watches
[1:19:24] over his heritage
[1:19:28] he watches over his word to confirm it
[1:19:32] to watch it see where he can get he is
[1:19:36] going to restore
[1:19:39] Sons and Daughters of God is full
[1:19:42] restoration
[1:19:48] this wipes out all the denominations
[1:19:53] they're not sons of God sons of God
[1:19:55] might be their in potential
[1:19:58] but until they will meet the word of
[1:20:00] their day
[1:20:02] and they are identified with it they
[1:20:05] become a part of it they become one with
[1:20:08] that word then they are Sons and
[1:20:11] Daughters manifested by God
[1:20:17] he said
[1:20:18] so when these churches begin to organize
[1:20:22] it's talking about the denominations
[1:20:25] and things like that he just prunes them
[1:20:30] off and the church goes on
[1:20:32] see what he's doing
[1:20:34] something were found in the True Vine
[1:20:36] seemingly
[1:20:38] is pruning that the husband means
[1:20:40] pulling that off
[1:20:41] when the Lutheran said we're going to
[1:20:44] become an organization will be big will
[1:20:47] be as big as the Catholic all right he
[1:20:49] just prunes them off he just prunes off
[1:20:52] the branch
[1:20:55] because once they were in
[1:20:59] Luther were in but look where those that
[1:21:02] came after Luther
[1:21:03] they were in the method of Luther
[1:21:07] Luther message Believers were cut off
[1:21:12] don't you think that
[1:21:14] message Believers of end time
[1:21:16] that won't remain in the vinyl will be
[1:21:18] cut off
[1:21:20] but he won't be here for my for these
[1:21:22] people here now that's that's outside
[1:21:25] for this one everybody is in
[1:21:30] and Wesley took it right
[1:21:33] on raise up
[1:21:36] raise up another prophet
[1:21:39] ride on raised up another Prophet then
[1:21:41] soon as Wesley died Wesley was in but
[1:21:44] those that came in the message of Wesley
[1:21:48] Wesley died the great prophet what did
[1:21:52] organize it
[1:21:54] on Camp Pentecostal soon as he did die
[1:21:57] he pruned that off
[1:21:59] it's raising right on up he's going to
[1:22:03] restore sons and daughters
[1:22:09] and he said not
[1:22:11] where does the fruit grow
[1:22:13] it don't start down here at the bottom
[1:22:15] it starts in the top
[1:22:17] where does the sun hit the tree first
[1:22:21] in the evening light the top of the tree
[1:22:25] not down on the bottom branches but up
[1:22:28] there in the top of the tree is where
[1:22:31] the fruit ripens at
[1:22:36] so we can we have at least an idea what
[1:22:40] the True Vine is we know
[1:22:44] what it stands for we're not the false
[1:22:47] Vine and how it sneaks in
[1:22:49] we know that this is this covers every
[1:22:54] not a bunch not some every
[1:22:58] every son and every dollar each
[1:23:01] individual
[1:23:02] I'm included
[1:23:06] now we come down to the verse 3. now you
[1:23:11] are clean through the word which I have
[1:23:13] spoken unto you
[1:23:15] the prophet of God says there has to be
[1:23:18] the cleansing first
[1:23:20] because you will see that there is a
[1:23:22] great invitation in verse 4.
[1:23:26] that great invitation God Jesus could
[1:23:30] not could not break his own law
[1:23:34] you can never have fellowship with him
[1:23:38] outside of the shed blood of Jesus of
[1:23:40] his own blood body
[1:23:43] and innocent has to die
[1:23:46] before he can cleanse you can come into
[1:23:48] fellowship and remember that as he's
[1:23:51] inviting you to abide in him
[1:23:54] him abiding in you what is it for
[1:23:59] this is for a content for a continuous
[1:24:02] relationship
[1:24:05] it's a continuous Fellowship
[1:24:10] we will see it how it started in the Old
[1:24:12] Testament
[1:24:13] to have it the prophet of God says there
[1:24:16] has to be a pleasing first
[1:24:18] and that's what the church today and
[1:24:21] what I want to point to that we need a
[1:24:24] cleansing
[1:24:26] you will see that invitation it's so
[1:24:30] simple he said my word has made you
[1:24:33] clean
[1:24:34] abide in me I in you it's a process
[1:24:39] it takes a lot in between these two
[1:24:42] verses between three and and four there
[1:24:46] are a lot there
[1:24:48] he said before anything can begin
[1:24:52] from God we've got to have a purging
[1:24:57] and when we look at and see things that
[1:25:00] is now under the present conditions
[1:25:03] existing the way they are we can see
[1:25:06] that we got to have something to happen
[1:25:09] before God can continue his program
[1:25:12] something has to happen
[1:25:15] a purging
[1:25:17] a cleansing
[1:25:19] before this great invitation ever given
[1:25:23] to man for men who was once lost and
[1:25:28] worthy could come into the holiest of
[1:25:30] the Holy
[1:25:32] and this holy of holies of the Holy
[1:25:35] could dwell could abide in man
[1:25:38] something has to happen
[1:25:48] in the questions and answered answers 59
[1:25:51] the prophet of God says now watch I'm
[1:25:54] going to take
[1:25:56] like this bottle he's taking a little
[1:25:59] bottle
[1:26:00] and it's laying out there in the chicken
[1:26:03] yard
[1:26:04] and it's all full of Filth
[1:26:07] I pick it up
[1:26:10] we know that that's justification
[1:26:13] I'm going to use this sinner listen to
[1:26:17] that
[1:26:18] he's picking up that Barrel there that's
[1:26:21] filthy dirty
[1:26:23] because he has an intention
[1:26:26] he has a purpose he is going to use that
[1:26:29] sinner
[1:26:32] God didn't bring you to this message
[1:26:34] just to be a believer just say hey
[1:26:36] Hallelujah everything goes because he
[1:26:40] wants to use you
[1:26:45] each and every one of us
[1:26:47] there is a specific service
[1:26:51] that God has intended ordained for you
[1:26:54] that the other fellow cannot do
[1:26:57] every one of us because there's no one
[1:27:00] who can replace you no one who can
[1:27:02] replace brother Chad here no one who can
[1:27:04] present my brothers sisters back there
[1:27:06] or me
[1:27:08] there is a specific purpose service that
[1:27:12] is all has been only entitled entrusted
[1:27:15] to you
[1:27:18] and God wants to use you
[1:27:24] that puts you at the same level with the
[1:27:27] prophet with the preacher with the
[1:27:29] pastor with everybody because you are
[1:27:32] ill
[1:27:35] don't look at your body or flesh don't
[1:27:38] look at how much
[1:27:39] you you wasted time more thing just know
[1:27:43] that this is God's word
[1:27:45] and his word is telling you
[1:27:47] wherever you are receive it it's yours
[1:27:50] God has a use of you
[1:27:55] he wants to use you
[1:27:58] and there's something specific that only
[1:28:03] you could be the best in that
[1:28:14] the prophet of God says
[1:28:16] I'm going to use this sinner
[1:28:19] and the next thing I do if I am going to
[1:28:24] use it
[1:28:26] I will have to cleanse it
[1:28:30] the very cleansing that God is doing
[1:28:32] right now day in and day out he cleanses
[1:28:36] you through on Wednesdays he cleanses
[1:28:38] you on Sundays he cleanses you at home
[1:28:40] as you were walking or working with the
[1:28:43] message reading your Bible he's
[1:28:44] cleansing you
[1:28:46] for a great purpose
[1:28:51] and then if he cleanse it what do I do
[1:28:54] to it
[1:28:56] sanctify sanctify it
[1:29:00] Sanctified means
[1:29:03] he wants to impute you his holiness
[1:29:09] it's a nature a divine nature of God on
[1:29:13] you before he can use you
[1:29:16] cleansing you and taking his robe of
[1:29:20] righteousness of Holiness just this fits
[1:29:24] you
[1:29:28] brother
[1:29:30] we're not just simple men and simple
[1:29:32] women in this world
[1:29:35] you've been called you've been ordained
[1:29:38] toward the robe of deity
[1:29:42] that's son and daughters of God you've
[1:29:45] been ordained
[1:29:46] you've been elected to wear a robe of
[1:29:50] deity on Earth
[1:29:54] in so much that people around you will
[1:29:57] never understand who you are
[1:30:00] remember one day I was reading somewhere
[1:30:02] I think maybe brother Billy Paul gave a
[1:30:05] testimony
[1:30:07] the one time he went in his father was
[1:30:10] the brother Brandon was at the table in
[1:30:12] a little room meditating
[1:30:15] Billy Paul opening slowly the door to
[1:30:18] sneak in to see
[1:30:20] is to see what's going in
[1:30:23] going on there
[1:30:24] he saw his daddy
[1:30:27] then in his mind
[1:30:30] he started thinking because of what he
[1:30:33] saw the day before the healings and
[1:30:35] things in the campaign Trail
[1:30:37] in his mind he said
[1:30:40] God
[1:30:42] is this my daddy or or it's you
[1:30:48] his dad was looking on that side
[1:30:51] with the scriptures reading and this is
[1:30:54] Billy Paul maybe few few yards away
[1:30:59] few feet away I might say
[1:31:02] is this my daddy
[1:31:05] oh God it's you inside of him
[1:31:09] and the dad who was working meditating
[1:31:11] here Tundra and said Billy it's your dad
[1:31:22] it's a man
[1:31:24] wearing the robe of deity
[1:31:27] that you can you cannot tell who who it
[1:31:29] is is it man we said God
[1:31:31] both
[1:31:33] that's what God wants to in wants to do
[1:31:37] with you
[1:31:38] your days are the most glorious day that
[1:31:42] ever lived on earth
[1:31:44] your feet are the Most Blessed the feet
[1:31:47] that would walk into someone's home
[1:31:53] let's go back to this
[1:31:56] he said the word sanctify means clean
[1:32:00] same thing as holy
[1:32:04] holy in Hebrew words the sanctify is in
[1:32:07] a Greek the word sanctify means clean
[1:32:10] and set aside for service
[1:32:15] this bride every member of it is to be
[1:32:21] put to service
[1:32:24] there's no nearer portion and bigger
[1:32:26] portion every member of this bride
[1:32:29] is going to be put to the service
[1:32:34] he said but then blessed are they that
[1:32:37] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[1:32:39] they shall be filled then they will they
[1:32:42] are put in in service
[1:32:47] so as in verse 3
[1:32:51] the Lord is declaring ye are clean by
[1:32:54] the word I have spoken to you
[1:32:58] it has to be something that if you are
[1:33:03] the one he's speaking to you will
[1:33:05] respond to that you will say that's me
[1:33:09] it's not for somebody else if you have
[1:33:12] received it
[1:33:13] if you have accepted if you if if within
[1:33:17] you God God give me the terminologies
[1:33:19] within you you are assured that this
[1:33:23] message came for me
[1:33:25] this came waited that Moses could not
[1:33:29] sin entirely that Isaiah could not see
[1:33:32] it entirely that any other Prophet they
[1:33:35] desired they longed to see this day and
[1:33:37] here I'm living in this day this is for
[1:33:39] me if you are
[1:33:42] convinced that this came to you then
[1:33:46] receive that cleansness
[1:33:50] and once you receive that you are
[1:33:53] candidate to the verse 4.
[1:33:59] the prophet of God said when Peter had
[1:34:01] been called and justified by Believing
[1:34:03] on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:05] and in John 17 17 Jesus Sanctified them
[1:34:09] through the word there's nothing outside
[1:34:13] of this war that will ever sanctify you
[1:34:16] that it will ever make you ready for
[1:34:20] your robe of deity there's nothing else
[1:34:25] you will see that if we have time here
[1:34:28] to go in the Old Testament they had the
[1:34:30] um the uh the ashes of the red Aether
[1:34:33] which was called the water of
[1:34:35] separations it's not even water it's
[1:34:37] it's ashes
[1:34:39] you touch those ashes
[1:34:42] you are you are
[1:34:45] a sinner you are unclean
[1:34:49] it has to be sprinkled
[1:34:51] upon you you have to be under the ashes
[1:34:55] then you are Sanctified you are clean
[1:34:59] any other shape of you coming in contact
[1:35:02] with the ashes you are
[1:35:05] filthy unclean
[1:35:09] the only way this word could sanctify
[1:35:12] you it's when it's there you are there
[1:35:16] it's sprinkling over you you can sit
[1:35:19] close to it you can walk closer to it
[1:35:21] you are unclean
[1:35:25] that's the way it used to be in the Old
[1:35:27] Testament you cannot touch the the ashes
[1:35:30] of the red April which was called for
[1:35:33] the water of separations you touch it
[1:35:36] you are unclean
[1:35:39] let the priests sprinkle it over you
[1:35:42] then you are clean
[1:35:44] the only way to be clean
[1:35:46] let this word be all that you can do
[1:35:49] what do what does the word say
[1:35:55] what I'm here it's there what does it
[1:35:58] say
[1:35:58] then get sprinkled
[1:36:01] then it will clean
[1:36:03] any other shape you want to touch it to
[1:36:06] manipulate it to your own way
[1:36:08] just touching you or made unclean
[1:36:16] he was the word so he Sanctified them he
[1:36:20] said father
[1:36:21] I sanctify them through the word
[1:36:27] you've got to accept it you're cleansing
[1:36:30] the prophet of God says if
[1:36:34] I was a young man
[1:36:36] this is a message a man running from the
[1:36:38] the presence of the Lord if I was a
[1:36:40] young man and looking for a wife to be
[1:36:43] married
[1:36:45] and here stood a girl that met every
[1:36:48] qualification
[1:36:50] that I thought it took it took to make a
[1:36:53] woman
[1:36:54] why morally she was a queen
[1:36:57] and lovely and a fine personality a real
[1:37:01] Christian everything that I could think
[1:37:03] of to make me a good wife
[1:37:06] no matter how much I say
[1:37:10] she is perfect she is exactly right she
[1:37:14] isn't mine
[1:37:17] until I accept her
[1:37:21] and the
[1:37:23] responsibility of her being my wife
[1:37:29] that's the same thing with the message
[1:37:34] you might say it's right or this and
[1:37:38] that or the other and say I sympathize
[1:37:40] with it
[1:37:42] I believe is the truth
[1:37:45] but you've got to accept it
[1:37:48] and it's got to become a part of you
[1:37:54] this message got to become a part of you
[1:37:59] and you are part of it
[1:38:06] you've then it's yours when you marry
[1:38:11] this certain woman that you have chosen
[1:38:14] you are one
[1:38:16] and that's the way you are with Christ
[1:38:19] when you see him manifested and made
[1:38:22] real then you are a part of him
[1:38:26] and he is a part of you and together you
[1:38:30] are a part of the message
[1:38:32] this message
[1:38:34] is no longer
[1:38:36] writings
[1:38:38] it's me
[1:38:40] you're talking about the message or
[1:38:42] you're talking about me
[1:38:45] that's who I am
[1:38:47] it's the word it's life
[1:38:54] we know that
[1:38:57] before we can go to the abide that's we
[1:39:00] haven't even
[1:39:02] gone into our subject yet but we're
[1:39:05] still here God knows
[1:39:07] so and Jesus would tell you that no more
[1:39:11] can you do could you do except he abide
[1:39:14] in me
[1:39:16] you will remember that
[1:39:21] even the Lord Jesus himself who lived
[1:39:25] fully the sonship
[1:39:28] he lived every day
[1:39:31] being a son of God
[1:39:34] that's our example
[1:39:36] as I told you in the Old Testament Aaron
[1:39:39] had experienced that just once a year
[1:39:42] people did not know because when he when
[1:39:45] he was walking in you remember he had to
[1:39:47] be pomegranate and the belt as even his
[1:39:51] walk that's the only way they would know
[1:39:54] that Aaron is still alive
[1:39:57] is the way he was walking into that
[1:40:00] invisible place
[1:40:03] if he did not walk
[1:40:05] the people would start mourning outside
[1:40:08] it was by his walk inside
[1:40:12] not laying down walking inside the bells
[1:40:17] were set to such a way that a sound was
[1:40:20] coming from the Bell
[1:40:22] would you imagine if Aaron was not
[1:40:24] walking in the holy of the holies
[1:40:27] if he was not walking in
[1:40:30] death
[1:40:33] was in
[1:40:36] it was sound proof
[1:40:38] there's no other way to know whether he
[1:40:41] was alive or not
[1:40:43] whatever was happening there was a
[1:40:45] secret even if you would have asked him
[1:40:46] he would not explain it it would tell
[1:40:49] you there's a part of Mana there
[1:40:51] there's a little white hanging there
[1:40:54] he will not explain but life was inside
[1:40:57] they only discovered that with the rod
[1:41:00] which was another branch
[1:41:02] of an almond tree
[1:41:05] that branch
[1:41:06] a natural Branch went back to what it
[1:41:09] used to be
[1:41:12] that's when this Branch a son and
[1:41:14] daughter of God once it goes into that
[1:41:17] Holy of the Holy that's where the
[1:41:19] abiding is they could go back to what
[1:41:22] they used to be
[1:41:24] a son or daughter of God
[1:41:27] is adamant before the fall
[1:41:31] you said I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[1:41:34] of God
[1:41:35] you mean to say that you are in the
[1:41:37] condition that Adam was before the fall
[1:41:41] or he had only one reliance
[1:41:44] God said
[1:41:47] God said
[1:41:50] that's what son and daughter of God is
[1:41:53] more to it
[1:41:56] and even when he was here
[1:41:58] he could tell you in John 5 19 you don't
[1:42:01] have to turn on he said then answered
[1:42:03] Jesus and said unto them verily verily I
[1:42:05] say unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:42:08] himself this son
[1:42:10] our example
[1:42:12] the lamb could do nothing of himself
[1:42:16] but what he seeth
[1:42:18] the father do this place what he seeth
[1:42:23] John 5 30 it says Akin of my own self do
[1:42:28] nothing as I hear
[1:42:33] his saying was connected with God his
[1:42:37] hearing connected with God
[1:42:40] that's what his son and daughter of God
[1:42:42] will be
[1:42:43] his saying will be connected with God
[1:42:45] his hearing will be connected with God
[1:42:48] in John 8 28 he said I do nothing of
[1:42:53] myself
[1:42:55] but as my father has taught to me
[1:42:59] hearing
[1:43:01] is connected with God
[1:43:04] seeing
[1:43:05] connected with God
[1:43:07] Doctrine anything he knows he's been
[1:43:10] taught by God
[1:43:13] Sons and Daughters will come to a level
[1:43:16] that all they see is God
[1:43:19] all they hear is God
[1:43:22] all they ever know
[1:43:25] has been taught by God
[1:43:29] not by any other source
[1:43:36] and then 15 5 goes I am the vine ye are
[1:43:40] the branches now is explaining as
[1:43:42] exposing us oh
[1:43:44] we are those branches
[1:43:47] of the True Vine
[1:43:51] he that abideth in me
[1:43:54] in I in him
[1:43:57] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:44:01] without me you can do nothing
[1:44:06] is I said this abiding
[1:44:09] there's a little condition there
[1:44:12] if you abide
[1:44:15] it's on condition
[1:44:18] I don't want to read through this but in
[1:44:21] the Old Testament just to resume it
[1:44:24] quick in the Old Testament when a sinner
[1:44:28] a sinner
[1:44:30] had the conscience that has been
[1:44:33] separated from God
[1:44:34] that he was he broke the fellowship with
[1:44:37] God
[1:44:38] now when he is coming back
[1:44:41] he was coming through the water of
[1:44:43] Separation within within the out of
[1:44:45] court
[1:44:46] sprinkled by the ashes of the red afro
[1:44:49] mixed with a cedar and his burned
[1:44:52] together
[1:44:53] he was Washed by the Water of separation
[1:44:57] to come into the out of court
[1:45:01] then he would go within the first Veil
[1:45:06] which is also called The Holy place
[1:45:09] he would walk there because there were
[1:45:11] seven strikes of blood
[1:45:14] of the Lamb he brought in
[1:45:16] that he was putting into remembrance
[1:45:20] that something paid the price for me
[1:45:24] it's not me I could not hear
[1:45:28] what I see there death struck this place
[1:45:32] on my behalf
[1:45:33] then he would walk into under the
[1:45:36] stripes there in the Holy place in the
[1:45:38] first Veil
[1:45:40] but for the second Veil which is the
[1:45:42] holy of the holiest
[1:45:45] it required a priest the high priest
[1:45:50] which was he was a deadly preparation
[1:45:54] an entire year
[1:45:56] of a man who has been dedicated called
[1:46:01] to just intercede for the sin of the
[1:46:03] people he had to make sure that
[1:46:05] everything he was living day by day or
[1:46:08] twist 165 days was not something that he
[1:46:14] would lose his life inside
[1:46:18] your Center you would go you do whatever
[1:46:20] you do leave her any way that anybody
[1:46:22] lives but this man was watching every
[1:46:25] single day this is natural
[1:46:27] every single day his motives
[1:46:30] his actions his thoughts wake up
[1:46:37] to make sure that there's nothing that
[1:46:40] he will be unaware of
[1:46:44] that would cause him to die there
[1:46:47] it would be his death and the sinner's
[1:46:49] death
[1:46:54] he wouldn't ensure that everything is
[1:46:56] combed through
[1:46:58] to come that one day
[1:47:02] to take the blood and to walk into the
[1:47:06] holiest of the Holy
[1:47:08] the prophet of God said the outer Court
[1:47:11] the light that was there was a firmament
[1:47:14] sometimes it would go dark
[1:47:17] that's why the the center in the outer
[1:47:20] Court
[1:47:21] was up and down they don't know what to
[1:47:23] do
[1:47:24] they're fighting with the word when the
[1:47:26] word said give tithing it's not for them
[1:47:30] live this way it's not for them
[1:47:33] they're fighting with that
[1:47:36] but within the holy place the first Veil
[1:47:40] the prophet of God said the word says
[1:47:42] that the word uh candlesticks
[1:47:45] they were burning
[1:47:46] sometimes they would go smoky
[1:47:50] you'll see a Christian who's been a
[1:47:51] Christian for years things they are
[1:47:54] doing the way they are acting you said
[1:47:57] something went wrong
[1:47:59] no
[1:48:00] you don't know
[1:48:02] which place they are
[1:48:06] out of Courts
[1:48:08] the light goes dark the firmament
[1:48:12] even in the inside the holy place
[1:48:15] the Candlestick would burn burn out
[1:48:17] smoky
[1:48:19] up and down
[1:48:21] but once you go inside there
[1:48:24] the light thereof was of this kind of
[1:48:27] Glory
[1:48:28] the supernatural light the prophet of
[1:48:31] God says little
[1:48:33] light
[1:48:34] Hanging On The Mercy Seat
[1:48:38] that will make that once you are in
[1:48:42] Aaron was not allowed into to to stay in
[1:48:46] because
[1:48:48] God has not done the propitiation work
[1:48:52] yet he has not fully atoned for the sin
[1:48:55] of the people
[1:48:57] he would go in
[1:48:58] and and come out and the prophet of God
[1:49:01] says out of in the out of court you were
[1:49:04] not in Fellowship you were in fellowship
[1:49:06] with the people there and out of court
[1:49:08] but not with God
[1:49:13] not with God
[1:49:18] you could be sprinkled with the water of
[1:49:20] separations
[1:49:21] but you had no fellowship with God
[1:49:24] you were in the process
[1:49:27] you could have fellowship with brothers
[1:49:29] that were in the fellowship in the
[1:49:31] out-of-quarter sisters you have
[1:49:33] fellowship with man
[1:49:34] but fellowship with God not yet
[1:49:39] and the prophet of God says
[1:49:41] now do not remain there
[1:49:44] in the Arab Court
[1:49:46] my precious brother or sister you've yet
[1:49:50] not approached the fellowship
[1:49:55] you can be in the Holy place
[1:49:58] the first Veil
[1:50:00] you have fellowship with brothers and
[1:50:03] sisters there
[1:50:05] the prophet of God said you have not the
[1:50:08] fellowship with God
[1:50:11] you're still not entered into the
[1:50:14] fellowship
[1:50:18] he said notice
[1:50:20] when you come in separation making
[1:50:22] confession all right you can fellowship
[1:50:26] with them
[1:50:28] you come in under the blood you can
[1:50:32] fellowship with them
[1:50:37] that's true enough
[1:50:39] but to fellowship with God
[1:50:43] you have to go into the presence of God
[1:50:51] and that's into the Shekinah Glory
[1:50:55] and one man once a year referring to
[1:50:57] Aaron
[1:50:59] was dressed to go in into she kind of
[1:51:02] Glory where that he fellowshipped with
[1:51:04] God face to face
[1:51:11] before he can go in
[1:51:14] Aaron was stripped of his clothes
[1:51:19] by Moses
[1:51:21] dressed up differently
[1:51:24] the clothes he had all year long
[1:51:27] regardless of his Holiness staying
[1:51:29] praying concentrating those clothes
[1:51:32] could not even allow him to go inside
[1:51:35] they had to strip every Clause every
[1:51:37] every every every piece of clothes on
[1:51:39] him
[1:51:41] to dress him up differently
[1:51:46] and you can come to the the temple
[1:51:49] you will see one person dressed up
[1:51:52] differently
[1:51:54] as we all come in the natural here if
[1:51:56] there's a wedding
[1:51:57] brother a brother could wear the same
[1:51:59] suit I'm wearing sitting up there during
[1:52:02] his wedding
[1:52:03] you can even come be have a confusion
[1:52:06] when he walks in who got married
[1:52:09] but for a sister
[1:52:12] I doubt there are two that would be
[1:52:14] dressing up the same way the same day
[1:52:18] Aaron has to be dressed up as a bride
[1:52:22] to walk into
[1:52:24] stripped from every piece of cloth they
[1:52:27] had he had on
[1:52:31] this was just the natural to go and
[1:52:34] experience one day of sonship and
[1:52:36] daughtership of God
[1:52:45] the prophet of God said
[1:52:49] one man once a year went in there
[1:52:52] Aaron
[1:52:55] but when our real sacrifice Jesus Christ
[1:52:57] died at Calvary
[1:53:00] he ran the Veil
[1:53:03] in two
[1:53:05] making a way with his own blood
[1:53:09] that whosoever will
[1:53:12] brother
[1:53:16] These Are Holy things
[1:53:19] that God has allowed our motto tongue to
[1:53:22] speak about
[1:53:25] when it becomes a reality when it
[1:53:27] becomes a a deposit of a revelation
[1:53:30] inside of you you said God you are
[1:53:32] allowing me to speak of what you did for
[1:53:35] me
[1:53:36] holy
[1:53:38] when Abraham Lincoln
[1:53:41] when when brother Graham says that a a
[1:53:44] black man because he fought for the
[1:53:46] black people here the slavery
[1:53:48] and when that slave would go there he
[1:53:50] would not even touch the Blood of
[1:53:52] Abraham Lincoln because of a reverence
[1:53:55] that he gave his blood
[1:53:58] for me when Abraham Lincoln was a sinner
[1:54:00] and this was a sin how much do we have
[1:54:02] to reverence the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:54:06] this is not something red we will
[1:54:08] remember it's one two thousand years on
[1:54:10] one little cross There Something red
[1:54:12] this is the very word that you have been
[1:54:14] presented today day their night
[1:54:20] this is the only blood that will cleanse
[1:54:22] you this word
[1:54:25] he's been so real to us in this place
[1:54:27] we've seen his glory
[1:54:34] he ran the Veil
[1:54:37] making away with his own blood
[1:54:40] this is divine blood
[1:54:43] this is the blood of life
[1:54:47] all life was contained inside
[1:54:53] whosoever will can come into this kind
[1:54:56] of Glory in the presence of the Holy
[1:54:59] Ghost
[1:55:00] and be filled with power of Pentecost
[1:55:05] as they did after the veil had been torn
[1:55:08] down yellow brown black white male
[1:55:11] female Gentiles Jew whosoever will
[1:55:17] there's nothing I can prevent anyone
[1:55:19] from entering in
[1:55:22] you did this you have no right
[1:55:24] I have no right
[1:55:27] whosoever will
[1:55:33] let him come and drink from the Fountain
[1:55:35] of the Lord when they come into that she
[1:55:37] kind of Glory Anointed with the Holy
[1:55:39] Spirit then they got fellowship with God
[1:55:44] again
[1:55:46] then they are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:55:50] you hear what son and doors of God it's
[1:55:53] when this group of people
[1:55:56] individual every one of them
[1:56:00] when they have Fellowship back with God
[1:56:03] again
[1:56:06] meaning we were before
[1:56:08] because you cannot come in today when
[1:56:10] you were not
[1:56:11] you have to be there before you can come
[1:56:14] back and fellowship again
[1:56:16] Sons and Daughters of God is a group of
[1:56:20] every individuals
[1:56:22] that have been cleansed by the word of
[1:56:24] God and returned back to fellowship with
[1:56:27] God again
[1:56:33] then he can dwell in them
[1:56:36] they can dwell in him
[1:56:41] it's a personal
[1:56:43] invitation John 15 verse 4. it's a
[1:56:48] personal invitation
[1:56:52] thank you brother John for the
[1:56:55] testimony you gave gave this morning
[1:57:01] it's the same God who does it
[1:57:04] simple way
[1:57:07] little thing little wallet God had to
[1:57:10] find that wallet
[1:57:13] because it meant so much for that lady
[1:57:16] God has to find that wallet God had to
[1:57:19] come down God had to walk God had to do
[1:57:22] what he did there coming every stone
[1:57:24] looking up his God doing that and God
[1:57:27] knew where it was and found it
[1:57:32] when you are into that presence your
[1:57:35] kind of Glory
[1:57:37] every move has a reason
[1:57:44] the prophet of God says allow me to read
[1:57:46] this a little bit lengthy I don't know
[1:57:47] what time it is we're going to be
[1:57:49] stopping somewhere
[1:57:51] in the hidden life
[1:57:53] 1955.
[1:57:55] the prophet of God said
[1:57:57] forgive me it's just something burning
[1:58:00] inside
[1:58:02] the thing is that
[1:58:06] sometimes I tell a wife people around
[1:58:10] that
[1:58:11] this could be my last breathing day
[1:58:17] you know what
[1:58:19] I pray and desire that God let us say I
[1:58:23] fall this body falls down
[1:58:25] it will be testifying of you
[1:58:35] and notice the dressing
[1:58:37] of this high priest
[1:58:39] before he could enter the Veil
[1:58:42] he had to be stripped and dressed right
[1:58:46] to go in
[1:58:48] that's what the church is today what it
[1:58:51] needs is a stripping
[1:58:56] what do you and I need
[1:58:59] it's a stripping
[1:59:02] and you you know I know
[1:59:05] you know what's stripping you need in
[1:59:07] your life
[1:59:09] because he cannot come closer to
[1:59:11] anything else but his work
[1:59:15] he's a jealous God
[1:59:17] he cannot if there is a deed
[1:59:21] a Doctrine
[1:59:24] standard an unbending way there
[1:59:28] he cannot be there
[1:59:32] he cannot be there
[1:59:35] because there's another Vine there
[1:59:38] in this Vine is humble
[1:59:41] he's loving
[1:59:43] in his jealous
[1:59:46] he will not come in fight with the other
[1:59:47] Vine
[1:59:48] who just stay away
[1:59:54] that's what the church is what it needs
[1:59:57] is a stripping of of all these little
[2:00:00] courts and things
[2:00:03] and dressed in the righteousness of
[2:00:06] Jesus Christ
[2:00:07] he had a pomegranate
[2:00:10] no I skipped there
[2:00:12] and ready to enter in his walk must be
[2:00:16] different
[2:00:18] brother
[2:00:19] if I walk the same way I was walking a
[2:00:22] week ago
[2:00:24] it's something
[2:00:25] I had to be regretful for
[2:00:29] my walk today has to be different from
[2:00:32] yesterday
[2:00:36] let me remind you
[2:00:39] we are only Immortals once
[2:00:43] don't forget that
[2:00:46] we're meant to be immortal
[2:00:49] we are only mortal once
[2:00:53] and that could stop in any time
[2:00:57] and while we're still Mortals
[2:01:00] let something of God himself write him
[2:01:04] in the sand of your life
[2:01:09] his walk must be different
[2:01:13] along the hems of His Garment he had a
[2:01:16] pomegranate and then a bell and as he
[2:01:20] walked his walk was so perfect brother
[2:01:25] and sister this isn't a natural a man
[2:01:29] who can walk in sin
[2:01:32] before the blood of Jesus was shed on
[2:01:35] Calvary perfect
[2:01:37] Aaron did
[2:01:40] meaning representing you and me
[2:01:44] our walk on this Earth
[2:01:47] has to be transformed by the power of
[2:01:51] God
[2:01:52] to become a perfect walk
[2:01:56] that you open your mouth your sister can
[2:01:59] realize it he's saying the truth your
[2:02:03] brother can say is saying the truth
[2:02:07] nothing but the truth not my mind not
[2:02:10] your mind not your what you know from
[2:02:12] your family traits family lineage
[2:02:19] his work was so perfect
[2:02:22] until the bells played
[2:02:25] holy
[2:02:26] holy
[2:02:27] holy unto the Lord if the outside would
[2:02:31] not hear that sound
[2:02:34] death has struck Aaron
[2:02:39] if my walk is not playing that sound
[2:02:43] death in the camp
[2:02:48] what we need today is not whether we are
[2:02:52] assemblies or Church of God or Oneness
[2:02:54] or whatever it might be I will walk
[2:02:57] ought to be playing to the public
[2:03:01] holy
[2:03:03] holy
[2:03:04] holy
[2:03:06] unto the Lord
[2:03:09] another thing
[2:03:11] he must be anointed before he goes in
[2:03:18] he must not only he was dressed up he
[2:03:21] made a preparation for this one day
[2:03:24] through the entire year
[2:03:27] he got to be stripped off
[2:03:29] dressed up correctly
[2:03:31] now he has to be anointed
[2:03:36] the anointing oil was made with the Rose
[2:03:39] of Sharon
[2:03:40] in the crushing of the Rose brought
[2:03:43] forth the perfume and they put it on the
[2:03:46] the oil that run on Aaron's beard
[2:03:49] plumbed to the Hem of His skirt
[2:03:53] covered
[2:03:55] all over with the anointing oil
[2:03:59] walking right
[2:04:01] living right moving right dressed right
[2:04:06] there he went taking before him the
[2:04:09] blood and as he went behind the curtain
[2:04:12] into the third room in the holy of the
[2:04:16] holiest
[2:04:17] there was a veil dropped behind him
[2:04:22] that the outside world could know could
[2:04:26] not see him no more
[2:04:30] no more
[2:04:32] not even a little shape of him
[2:04:34] not even not not even a shadow of Aaron
[2:04:39] and every man or a boy or woman or girl
[2:04:42] that ever is Anointed of God and Walks
[2:04:46] Behind that Temple
[2:04:48] the veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him
[2:04:51] in a secret place
[2:04:52] Aaron was in a secret place
[2:04:56] a son and daughter of God
[2:04:59] ought to be living in a secret place
[2:05:05] the world cannot see where you are they
[2:05:09] will never understand you
[2:05:18] the veil drops behind him in the world
[2:05:22] and all of its things are cut off behind
[2:05:25] him
[2:05:26] the world and everything cut off behind
[2:05:31] has no remembrance of what is outside
[2:05:37] the prophet of God says this that when
[2:05:40] put put Aaron's right in there
[2:05:46] a few more minutes
[2:05:47] put Aaron's rod in there
[2:05:50] and all the dead amountry
[2:05:53] but as it went under the Shekinah Glory
[2:05:56] everything it was
[2:05:59] was restored again
[2:06:04] a dry stick
[2:06:06] it was a branch
[2:06:11] but because it was in
[2:06:13] it we went to abide one night only
[2:06:19] just to abide one night
[2:06:23] it was restored back
[2:06:26] now when the Lord Jesus wants you to
[2:06:28] come and abide within him what is he
[2:06:31] wanting to do
[2:06:33] restore you back
[2:06:35] Adam
[2:06:38] a son or a daughter of God is a restored
[2:06:42] human being
[2:06:45] it's a restored deity the prophet of God
[2:06:48] says God was the great God and Adam was
[2:06:53] an immature God a Son of God a daughter
[2:06:56] of God is a restored amateur God
[2:07:01] in humility and simplicity
[2:07:07] he said
[2:07:10] and all the dead almond tree
[2:07:13] but as it went under the Shekinah Glory
[2:07:16] everything it was was restored back
[2:07:19] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[2:07:23] under the Shekinah Glory
[2:07:25] of the Holy Spirit the veil dropped
[2:07:29] behind him everything that he ought to
[2:07:33] have been
[2:07:35] listen to that
[2:07:37] everything you ought to have been
[2:07:43] not from mind man's perspective from
[2:07:47] God's perspective everything you ought
[2:07:50] to have been
[2:07:54] a Son of God blooms out of him again
[2:08:01] everything you ought to have been
[2:08:04] there's only one thing that can restore
[2:08:07] it in your life
[2:08:09] when you become a son or daughter of God
[2:08:15] you go back to what you used to be
[2:08:18] what God intended for you the perfect
[2:08:21] one the Creator the one who knows
[2:08:23] everything what he you he ordained you
[2:08:27] to have been
[2:08:28] you find it when you become a son or
[2:08:32] daughter of God
[2:08:36] remember overnight it bothered blossomed
[2:08:40] and growed almond almonds on it fruits
[2:08:44] of the spirit love joy long-suffering
[2:08:48] goodness gentleness patience that's what
[2:08:52] we need to get in the third step the
[2:08:55] holiest of the Holy get over into the
[2:08:59] Shekinah Glory where that little sacred
[2:09:03] light I love that
[2:09:06] no not the light of the firmament
[2:09:08] outside
[2:09:09] not that the Kendall lights
[2:09:12] they could go smoky inside in the Holy
[2:09:15] place no but there was a little sacred
[2:09:18] light
[2:09:21] that no one else could see outside only
[2:09:23] Aaron saw it once a year
[2:09:27] but today
[2:09:28] he's giving you and me access into that
[2:09:32] to that little sacred light
[2:09:35] sacred light
[2:09:39] it was hanging over The Mercy Seat
[2:09:43] that nobody else could see it
[2:09:45] the congregation out and out could never
[2:09:47] see that they never knew because
[2:09:49] Aaron could not talk of what he saw
[2:09:51] inside
[2:09:55] he could not
[2:09:57] so the children of Israel never knew
[2:10:00] what was behind the veil
[2:10:02] the only time they couldn't know what
[2:10:05] was behind the veil was on Calvary
[2:10:08] so Moses no one knew what was behind
[2:10:11] there only Aaron
[2:10:13] once a year he could not talk about it
[2:10:16] little
[2:10:18] sacred light
[2:10:20] hanging over The Mercy Seat
[2:10:25] there was a wedding going on there
[2:10:29] between Aaron and the little sacred
[2:10:32] light
[2:10:35] in such a way that when the when the the
[2:10:37] this Branch Aman Rod was inside there
[2:10:41] was a little wedding there
[2:10:44] everything that it ought to have been
[2:10:46] was restored back
[2:10:48] in one night
[2:10:49] but he's not calling us for one night no
[2:10:54] he wants to abide continuously in you
[2:10:58] you in him in a continuous relationship
[2:11:04] continuous Fellowship
[2:11:07] you know the message has been we I don't
[2:11:09] know talking about myself
[2:11:11] it's been so crazy that whatever you are
[2:11:14] you speaking about it in the restroom in
[2:11:15] the shower every place
[2:11:17] there's something that you're finding
[2:11:20] yourself speaking the word unconsciously
[2:11:24] you've experienced that unconsciously
[2:11:28] speaking the words
[2:11:33] he wants us to abide in that place
[2:11:38] and he said that's the place to stay
[2:11:44] that's the place to abide
[2:11:47] brother and sister don't be out there
[2:11:49] out of the court in the outer courts
[2:11:52] not in the Holy place
[2:11:54] he wants us the prophet is telling us
[2:11:57] the inside the holies of the Holy third
[2:12:00] room that's the place to stay
[2:12:04] were the manna part of manner set down
[2:12:08] by the ark
[2:12:10] outside they will not see that manner
[2:12:13] The Outsider will get it and it will rot
[2:12:16] it will get to work on Tales the evening
[2:12:18] but there inside since it's been there
[2:12:21] it's fresh
[2:12:25] it's once you know what is inside the
[2:12:27] little place
[2:12:29] you have no desire to go out I assure
[2:12:31] you
[2:12:33] once a Believer gets inside that place
[2:12:36] under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[2:12:40] you go into you discover what is inside
[2:12:43] there brother and sister the world has
[2:12:47] flown from you
[2:12:56] that's the place to live
[2:13:02] Aaron could only be once one day a year
[2:13:06] but God is inviting you to live there to
[2:13:09] stay there
[2:13:11] that you and that little sacred light
[2:13:15] you can be one
[2:13:19] the curtains is dropped behind you
[2:13:24] he said today people just have enough
[2:13:27] religion to make themselves miserable oh
[2:13:35] people just have enough religion to make
[2:13:37] themselves themselves a miserable
[2:13:41] knowing that they ought to do this they
[2:13:43] are trying to escape hell
[2:13:46] well if that's the way I felt about it
[2:13:49] brother I don't know what I would do
[2:13:52] oh get in with Christ
[2:13:55] Shadow from the things of the world for
[2:13:58] to commune with him is a pleasure
[2:14:03] how many could say Amen to that to
[2:14:06] commune with him it's a pleasure
[2:14:12] it's beautiful
[2:14:13] it's something that fills and satisfies
[2:14:17] the soul
[2:14:18] something that gives you peace that
[2:14:21] surpasses all understanding
[2:14:24] all the crosses
[2:14:27] all the crosses become flying wings
[2:14:33] you have a cross your bearing
[2:14:35] enter in
[2:14:38] it's going to be turned by the power of
[2:14:39] the Holy Ghost into a frying wing for
[2:14:41] you
[2:14:45] all the burdens are chariots Wheels
[2:14:49] you have a burden
[2:14:50] want to Will on your chariot
[2:14:53] God will has the power to transform that
[2:14:58] oh you can fly away
[2:15:04] my burdens are light
[2:15:06] yoke up with him the yoke is all padded
[2:15:11] with hallelujahs
[2:15:14] when you are
[2:15:16] once inside the veil listen to this
[2:15:20] when you are once inside the veil with
[2:15:25] him
[2:15:26] he becomes your life
[2:15:34] he becomes your life
[2:15:37] let me I'm going to be stopping at the
[2:15:38] verse six
[2:15:41] those were first five that I skipped a
[2:15:44] lot
[2:15:45] verse 6 he said
[2:15:48] if a man abide not in me
[2:15:53] he is cast forth as a branch
[2:15:57] and is withered
[2:15:59] and Men gathered them who's Gathering
[2:16:02] them mans men's idea
[2:16:05] men's idea picks you up
[2:16:07] factor factor searching engine fit backs
[2:16:12] you up
[2:16:15] the voice of the signs all this they
[2:16:17] pick you up because the men have to pick
[2:16:18] you up
[2:16:19] have to prepare you to be burning
[2:16:24] and cast them into the fire and they are
[2:16:27] burned but listen if you abide the
[2:16:30] prophet coming back God be with us
[2:16:34] give me a few more minutes listen 10
[2:16:36] minutes what should be done
[2:16:38] if God God's word is in US
[2:16:43] in abideth in there
[2:16:45] it's just speaks for itself
[2:16:49] ask what you will
[2:16:52] and it will be given to you
[2:16:55] not that that's a found in John 15 7 if
[2:16:58] you want to mark it down
[2:17:00] see Jesus said if he abide in me my
[2:17:03] words in you
[2:17:05] not today one thing
[2:17:07] tomorrow next day something else
[2:17:11] and backslid and over here and down here
[2:17:16] and down there it shows you never got
[2:17:20] nothing to begin with
[2:17:22] if you you're one thing one day in the
[2:17:26] next week another thing else and next
[2:17:29] little Peckerwood I don't know what it
[2:17:31] is you'll translate that for me later
[2:17:33] a little pickle Ward comes along picks
[2:17:36] on a hollow tree you run after it and
[2:17:39] then next one over here Mission trotting
[2:17:43] don't know where you do belong then
[2:17:46] Christ do not abide in you
[2:17:50] his word isn't there because it's stable
[2:17:55] you never turn to Darkness
[2:17:58] in John to scripture second John 1 5 9
[2:18:04] I'm going to read it for you whosoever
[2:18:06] transgresses and abideth not in the
[2:18:09] doctrine of Christ
[2:18:10] has not gone
[2:18:12] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[2:18:16] Christ
[2:18:17] he has both the father and the son
[2:18:23] now the branch and the vine I'm going to
[2:18:26] be reading this message here before we
[2:18:29] close now the branch and the vine is
[2:18:31] connected together
[2:18:35] the branch and the Vine
[2:18:37] and God has always tried to get a people
[2:18:42] that he could so dwell in listen to the
[2:18:47] desire of God
[2:18:49] and his purpose for you
[2:18:52] he's always tried to get a people that
[2:18:55] he could so dwell in that he could show
[2:18:59] his glory among his people
[2:19:03] if he abide in me
[2:19:07] in my words abide in you
[2:19:09] seven
[2:19:11] you shall ask what you will and shall be
[2:19:14] done unto you I didn't want to leave
[2:19:16] that up because the circle of our little
[2:19:20] subject verse 7.
[2:19:24] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[2:19:27] you you shall ask what you will and it
[2:19:30] shall be done unto you
[2:19:32] your will will be nothing else but his
[2:19:35] fruit
[2:19:39] he said
[2:19:41] now it just can't go one time then of
[2:19:44] the next time if you're biting him
[2:19:49] abide means to rest there
[2:19:55] say right there that's what the prophet
[2:19:58] is saying
[2:19:59] and he said because
[2:20:02] it's no more
[2:20:06] for it's it isn't you no more it's the
[2:20:10] word that's in you and the word is God
[2:20:16] you will only ask what the word tells
[2:20:21] you to ask
[2:20:23] know the day you're living then and ask
[2:20:27] accordingly
[2:20:30] because
[2:20:31] you will only ask what the word tells
[2:20:36] you to ask
[2:20:38] you are not speaking your own word
[2:20:42] you're speaking his word
[2:20:49] God wants your hands
[2:20:52] he wants your eyes
[2:20:55] he wants your tongue
[2:20:58] he wants your lips
[2:21:01] he wants your ears
[2:21:03] once your hands and feet so he can bring
[2:21:07] forth
[2:21:08] fruit through you
[2:21:13] you are his workmanship
[2:21:21] if he abide in me and my word in you as
[2:21:25] we might stand
[2:21:26] let's stand up
[2:21:28] and musician you might make your way
[2:21:30] this way
[2:21:32] if he abide in me and my word in you
[2:21:34] then ask what you will it shall be done
[2:21:36] unto you
[2:21:38] uniting the bride back with the word
[2:21:42] that's what it is
[2:21:44] which is God
[2:21:48] we become a part of his word part of his
[2:21:52] life
[2:21:53] for we are flesh of his flesh
[2:21:56] and bone of his bone in life of his life
[2:21:59] then we can no more perish
[2:22:03] than God himself could perish
[2:22:07] that's what the Holy Ghost is the
[2:22:10] uniting the abiding produces that
[2:22:14] he said you become a living unit
[2:22:21] units walking on Earth with the life of
[2:22:24] God inside
[2:22:26] when you abide
[2:22:29] it takes the abiding
[2:22:32] not one day in one day out
[2:22:36] come that the veil would drop behind you
[2:22:41] the world
[2:22:42] forsaken completely
[2:22:45] you shut in with him
[2:22:47] there you'll be bloomed back to what you
[2:22:52] ought to have been
[2:22:56] son and daughters of God
[2:22:58] these are
[2:23:00] amateur Gods restored back
[2:23:05] they live where God lives
[2:23:09] they live in him and he lives in them it
[2:23:11] might be playing something
[2:23:22] and the world is failing apart
[2:23:27] the prophet of God says
[2:23:31] you want to know where the secret lies
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:35] in all of this
[2:23:38] where the secret lies
[2:23:42] he said the power of visions and things
[2:23:46] is back to the word
[2:23:50] it's the word of God Jesus was the word
[2:23:53] he was the manifestation of God God was
[2:23:57] in Christ reconciling the world to
[2:23:59] himself
[2:24:00] and he was the word in the beginning was
[2:24:04] the word and the Word was made flesh
[2:24:07] and the word wants to be made our flesh
[2:24:15] let's bow our heads
[2:24:22] precious Heavenly Father
[2:24:27] we do recognize one thing Lord that
[2:24:33] you ordain
[2:24:36] our mortal lips
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:42] to speak deity
[2:24:46] to speak things that angels
[2:24:49] cannot even look to to see what's
[2:24:52] written or even to hear them
[2:24:58] yet sometimes we
[2:25:02] not sometimes father but all the time we
[2:25:04] feel un inadequate
[2:25:06] we we are unworthy in in these bodies of
[2:25:10] Flesh
[2:25:13] no wonder they were meant to
[2:25:15] to be back to go back to the ashes
[2:25:18] because we can never find
[2:25:21] adequate words
[2:25:24] or enough verb to explain
[2:25:29] How Great Thou Are
[2:25:33] Lord would you take this little broken
[2:25:37] message this morning

[2:26:14] even know even come to desire within
[2:26:16] this body of Flesh
[2:26:21] Lord would you send the power
[2:26:25] at every address
[2:26:27] in every Heart Lord
[2:26:30] and all we will desire would only be you
[2:26:36] Lord we don't know

[2:26:41] mouth of Flesh
[2:26:43] if this would be the last
[2:26:46] father I ask that your angels
[2:26:50] will be taking these words further
