TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the devil hands us negative thoughts about the way somebody treated us or away a situation unfolded or a way somebody handled something amen and we begin to stick these things here and accomplish the next thing though we're walled off and we think the problems with everybody else that church that Ministry that family that family member that but they're not the ones who built the wall we are we sit inside our wall all bricked in and separated from fellowship and and licking our wounds and sucking our sores and blaming everybody else for this wall That's separating us and we think we're right say God forgive me amen knock down this wall that I built this thing that's separating me from fellowship this thing that's hurting me and we're the ones who hurt the most we suffer by our own efforts to save ourselves we destroy ourselves our own efforts to protect our heart from many more damage is the very thing that destroys our heart because we pull away from the fellowship that God wants to use to heal us I say God help me forgive me amen knock These Bricks out of the way all these negative lies of the devil all the wrong seed that was sown in my mind and I allowed it to stay God forgive me of that and knock it all away and help me to have a softer feeling in my heart towards others this is what he says I will repeat that last phrase until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is the change brother Roy that scene coming something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite my goodness brother Branham when he's coming with a perfect interpretation of the word a perfect Revelation and brother Branham at this point had Revelation he hadn't even shared yet he had things God told him he felt to stop not say anymore he understood what the third pull was he knew what the seventh seal was he knew what all the seals were he knew the day and hour he knew all of this he had this great Revelation and what he needed was not was not more Revelation what he needed was for him to change so that he can Manifest this revelation so he can move into this final stage of the ministry he was going to take a change in him and the change in him was not going to be Pride it wasn't going to be arrogancy it was going to be a haughty Spirit it wasn't going to be a know-it-all the change in him was going to be a greater feeling for the people he was moving into the Capstone of perfect love that's the change that he needed and what change do we need we don't need to have the answers for everything we don't need to cut everybody's legs out from under them when they don't understand the message or they disagree we don't need debate we don't need all of this nonsense what we need is a more Divine love perfect love working in us we need something to change us so that we can move into this final stage of the ministry it's not going to be head and knowledge that does it is not going to be we understand it all and nobody can stand against the Bible Understanding that we have my goodness what we need is to project love because when love projects Sovereign Grace takes its place
