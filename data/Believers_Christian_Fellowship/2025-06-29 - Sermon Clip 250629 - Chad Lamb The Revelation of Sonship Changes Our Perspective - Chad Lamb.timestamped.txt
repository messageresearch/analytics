[0:00] To me, I have to get to the place where
[0:02] I say what the word says and stop saying
[0:04] what I feel because what I feel is so
[0:07] often opposite to what the word says.
[0:09] And this is what revelation of sunship
[0:11] will do to us once God reveals to us
[0:14] where we came from, who we are, why
[0:16] we're here, where we're going, and what
[0:18] his purpose is. It gives us the ability
[0:20] to look beyond the trial and look beyond
[0:22] to the things that God has laid in store
[0:24] for us and say, "This is working for
[0:27] that goal. this is working for the
[0:29] purpose he has in my life because
[0:30] without revelation of sunship we just
[0:33] become the victims of circumstances in
[0:36] life and there are circumstances for
[0:38] everybody in life and not just
[0:41] Christians not uncchristians not I mean
[0:43] if you're Muslim if you're Jew if you're
[0:44] Hindu it doesn't matter who you are amen
[0:47] he a man that is born of a woman is a
[0:48] few days and full of trouble
[0:51] amen but but that's because of the
[0:53] fallen nature that's because of the
[0:55] curse upon the earth so everybody falls
[0:57] falls into trouble. Everybody has
[1:00] tribulations. Everybody has troubles on
[1:02] the earth. But a son and daughter of God
[1:04] was born into this situation with a
[1:07] sin-cursed body and a sin-cursed world
[1:09] because God wants us to get an education
[1:11] cuz he's bringing us to a perfection.
[1:14] And he's using all of these
[1:15] circumstances that eat away and destroy
[1:17] the world. He's using the same
[1:19] circumstances to build us up and bring
[1:21] us into perfection, to bring us into
[1:23] maturity and bring us into our adoption
[1:25] where he can place as sons and daughters
[1:27] of God with authority that he places in
[1:29] us so that he can give us the signate
[1:31] ring so that he can give us the sword.
[1:33] Amen. Amen. So though our though our
[1:38] troubles are the same, we lose loved
[1:41] ones, we get sick, we lose jobs, we have
[1:43] financial crisis, we have things that go
[1:45] wrong, we have vehicle breaks down, we
[1:47] have family relations that go south, we
[1:49] have everything that everybody else has,
[1:51] but they are victims of circumstances of
[1:54] a sin-cursed world. We are never victims
[1:56] of circumstances because we have a
[1:58] heavenly father who knows all things and
[2:00] has orchestrated everything for our
[2:02] good. Amen. Amen.
[2:05] See, this is why unless we have God
[2:08] revealed to us who we are to break the
[2:10] spiritual amnesia, this world will
[2:12] whittle us down into depression, into
[2:15] discouragement, into a place where we
[2:17] just can't feel like we can go on
[2:19] anymore and brings us into states of
[2:21] depression and despondency and
[2:23] hopelessness. Amen. Because there's
[2:25] nowhere else to go. If we're just born
[2:28] of whoever our earthly mother and father
[2:30] was, if the only truth in our lives is
[2:32] the truth that's on our birth
[2:33] certificate and the truth that we feel
[2:35] and see and hear, Amen. then we're of
[2:37] all people most miserable, we're going
[2:39] to fail because this world is falling
[2:41] apart.
[2:43] There's no sure place to stand. There's
[2:45] no foundation. This thing is rumbling.
[2:47] Amen. And crumbling because it's going
[2:49] to be remade. Amen. It's going to bring
[2:51] forth. A it's going to be reformed for a
[2:53] new millennium. So everything is
[2:55] starting to crumble and fail. So God can
[2:58] bring a fresh everything, a fresh
[3:00] government, a fresh civilization, a
[3:02] fresh earth. Amen.
[3:05] So we we there's got to be something
[3:08] that happens in us. Amen. That lets us
[3:10] look beyond the circumstances or else,
[3:12] friends, we're just going to fall into
[3:14] the same despair that the rest of the
[3:16] world's falling into or or we'll move
[3:18] into some sort of coping mechanism to
[3:21] cover it up. Y which is where a majority
[3:23] of the world is
[3:25] and addictions and pleasure seeking and
[3:28] all of these other things. But when we
[3:30] have a revelation of sunship and we know
[3:32] that we have a heavenly father who has
[3:34] orchestrated our lives, he has written
[3:37] it in code. He has desired. Amen. A
[3:39] definite purpose.
