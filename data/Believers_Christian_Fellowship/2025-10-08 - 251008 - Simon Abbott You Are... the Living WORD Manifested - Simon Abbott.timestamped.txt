[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] I know that I am nothing to bear the
[0:05] Christian name. Oh, for every blunder
[0:09] that I make, I've just myself to blame.
[0:13] But glory, hallelujah,
[0:16] I don't see them at all. And neither
[0:20] does my Savior, for the God has cleansed
[0:24] them all.
[0:26] Oh, in him, in him, it's the only place
[0:31] for me. And I won't go back for anything
[0:36] to where I used to be. And the sun is
[0:39] always shining. And the victories been
[0:43] won. And I'm walking in the light of
[0:47] that new Jerusalem.
[0:51] Why do you talk of sorrow? For there is
[0:55] none in here. In Christ is no
[0:58] unhappiness. In Christ there is no fear.
[1:02] It doesn't seem to matter how dark it is
[1:06] outside. For in shakina glory soul is
[1:11] free to hide.
[1:14] Oh in him in him the only place to be. I
[1:20] won't go back for anything where I used
[1:24] to be. Oh, the sun is always shining and
[1:29] the victories been won. I'm walking in
[1:32] the light of that new Jerusalem.
[1:38] Oh, it doesn't seem to matter how this
[1:41] old flesh may feel. That every man's
[1:45] word be alive. God's word alone is real.
[1:49] Oh, how my heart's rejoicing. It's all
[1:52] in him, not me. And the glory is to him
[1:57] all eternity.
[2:01] In him, in him, it's the only place for
[2:06] me. Oh, I won't go back for anything.
[2:10] Where I used to be. The sun is always
[2:14] shining and the victories been won. And
[2:18] I'm walking in the light of that new
[2:21] Jerusalem.
[2:23] In him, oh in him. In him. It's the only
[2:28] place for me. I won't go back for
[2:32] anything. Where I used to be. The sun is
[2:36] always shining and the victories been
[2:40] won. And I'm walking in the light of
[2:43] that new Jerusalem.
[2:46] Amen. Amen. Walking in the light. Let's
[2:50] go to the key of E flat. Let's sing that
[2:51] song little by little.
[2:54] Amen. Little by little,
[2:59] I'm changing
[3:01] and I'm growing.
[3:04] Little
[3:06] by little.
[3:08] And I know that it's showing.
[3:12] I'm not who I'll be. And I'm not who I
[3:16] was. I'm somewhere in the middle.
[3:22] And God is changing me little by little.
[3:31] Oh, sometimes it seems that I'm so far
[3:35] away
[3:37] from all I want to be.
[3:41] God, his word says he'll finish one day
[3:47] all that he started in me.
[3:51] Oh, I looked at me and I don't
[3:55] understand, but God has a vision and God
[4:00] has a plan.
[4:04] Little
[4:05] by little,
[4:08] I'm changing
[4:10] and I'm growing.
[4:14] Little
[4:15] by little.
[4:18] And I know that it's showing.
[4:23] I'm not who I'll be. And I'm not who I
[4:26] was.
[4:28] I'm somewhere in the middle.
[4:32] Oh, God is changing me.
[4:37] Little by little.
[4:41] Oh, little
[4:44] by little,
[4:47] I'm changing
[4:49] and I'm growing.
[4:52] Little
[4:54] by little.
[4:56] And I know that it's showing.
[5:01] I'm not who I'll be and I'm not who I
[5:05] was. I'm somewhere in the middle
[5:11] and God is changing me little by little.
[5:20] He paid a debt that he did not owe. And
[5:26] I owed a debt that I could not pay. I
[5:31] needed someone
[5:34] to wash my sins away.
[5:40] And now I sing a brand new song.
[5:46] Amazing grace.
[5:48] All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt
[5:54] that I could never pay.
[6:00] He paid a debt at Calvary.
[6:05] He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm
[6:10] glad that Jesus
[6:13] did all my sins erased.
[6:18] [Music]
[6:19] I now can sing a brand new song. Amazing
[6:26] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[6:32] debt that I could never pay.
[6:37] [Music]
[6:39] And now he's coming back for me to live
[6:44] with him eternally.
[6:48] Oh, it's been glorious
[6:52] to see him in this day.
[6:57] And I now will sing a brand new song.
[7:03] Amazing grace
[7:06] all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt
[7:11] that I could never pay. Oh, sing that
[7:15] verse again. And now he's coming back
[7:20] for me. I'll live with him eternally.
[7:26] Oh, it's been glorious
[7:30] to see him in this day.
[7:36] And I now sing this brand new song.
[7:41] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[7:47] paid a debt that I could never pay.
[7:55] Amen. so thankfully paid that debt.
[7:58] Father in heaven, how we love you
[8:04] and we lift your name in all the earth.
[8:12] May your kingdom be established
[8:16] in our praises
[8:20] as your people

[8:26] Oh, blessed be the Lord
[8:31] God
[8:32] Almighty
[8:36] who was and is and is to come.
[8:42] Blessed be the Lord
[8:46] God

[9:07] and we lift your name in all the earth.
[9:15] And may your kingdom be established
[9:20] in our praises
[9:23] as your people

[9:30] Blessed be the Lord. Let's stand
[9:33] together as we sing that. Almighty.
[9:39] Oh, who was and is and is to come.

[9:59] more.

[10:16] to come.
[10:19] Blessed be the Lord
[10:22] God
[10:24] Almighty
[10:28] who reigns
[10:30] forever
[10:32] more.
[10:35] Oh, he reigns
[10:38] forever
[10:40] more.
[10:43] Amen. As brother Simon comes tonight,
[10:45] let's sing that. Welcome, Holy Spirit.
[10:49] Welcome Holy Spirit
[10:55] for we are in your presence
[11:03] in your

[12:36] And when I'm in your presence
[12:42] and I look upon
[12:45] your face,
[12:49] then all my troubles vanish
[12:52] in.
[12:55] Oh, praise his name
[13:01] and welcome Holy Spirit.
[13:06] [Music]

[13:12] [Applause]

[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. The Lord's
[14:22] good. Amen. Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; It's nice to be here. It's maybe not
[14:25] nice to be here, but all is well.
[14:29] All is well. Thank you. I appreciate
[14:31] that. Bash, brother, John.
[14:34] All is well. What can we say? Greetings
[14:36] first of all and greetings from Brother
[14:38] Chad. He called me just as I was coming
[14:39] in and he said, "Pass on his love and
[14:41] greetings." So, we just pray for Brother
[14:44] Chad as he's traveling with David. Um,
[14:47] all is well. Let's just turn if we can
[14:49] to Corinthians 3. while you're turning.
[14:52] Just like I said, I'm just trying to
[14:54] calm down here a sec. And
[14:58] there's a time of your life, you know,
[15:00] when you're a teenager or when you're
[15:01] younger and you just don't shut up. You
[15:04] just keep
[15:06] and then when you get a bit older, maybe
[15:08] you get a little bit wiser and then you
[15:11] stand here
[15:12] and all your thoughts just disappear.
[15:15] But all is well. I'm going to try and
[15:17] I'm going to apologize ahead of time
[15:18] because my notes are probably
[15:19] everywhere.
[15:21] And um
[15:24] yeah, I was just I thought my brother
[15:27] John was going to sing till half past,
[15:29] but
[15:30] I was trying to finish as quick as I
[15:32] could. But all is well. Let's just see
[15:35] how we get on. 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[15:37] if we can.
[15:38] And I'd like to read verses 1 to three
[15:41] if that's okay. Verses 1 to three.
[15:45] It says here, "Do we begin again to
[15:47] commend ourselves? Or need we as some
[15:49] others epistles of commendation to you
[15:52] or letters of commendation from you? Ye
[15:55] are our epistle written in our hearts,
[15:56] known and read of all men. For as much
[15:59] as ye are manifestly declared to be the
[16:01] epistle of Christ, ministered by us,
[16:03] written not with ink, but with the
[16:05] spirit of the living God, not in tables
[16:07] of stone, but in the fleshy tables of
[16:09] the heart." Amen. Let's just pray over
[16:11] the reading of the word if we can. Lord
[16:13] Jesus, we just ask that you come and
[16:15] speak to us, Lord. We pray. Put
[16:17] ourselves to one side, Lord. The speaker
[16:19] and the hearer, Lord. Just you speak
[16:20] through us and you hear through us,
[16:22] Lord, we pray. We love you, Lord. We can
[16:25] do nothing. You do so much for us, Lord.
[16:27] It's the smallest thing that we can do.
[16:29] Come and be used of you. That's what we
[16:31] want. That's our desire, Lord Jesus. So,
[16:33] we just ask that you help us, Lord, and
[16:35] just take away any nervousness and just
[16:37] just speak to us. We pray. We love you,
[16:39] Lord Jesus. And we just thank you Lord
[16:42] for all things. Amen. You may be seated.
[16:44] Lord's good.
[16:47] You know,
[16:49] sometimes I try and tell myself, look,
[16:51] if we would just sit around as though
[16:53] I'd sit around, sit like we would be
[16:55] sitting at the feet of the Lord Jesus.
[16:58] That would be um a beautiful thing. And
[17:01] we wouldn't be nervous. We would just
[17:02] sit there and he would like a father to
[17:04] a son talk to us and encourage us. And
[17:07] so we are um that's what we want to do
[17:10] this evening. Just come and just hear
[17:11] from the Lord. And I want to hear from
[17:13] the Lord too. So you know over the last
[17:15] couple of services um it's always this
[17:18] is what really stresses stresses you out
[17:20] is that the Lord kind of gives you a
[17:22] word or you think you know you think oh
[17:23] this is really beautiful and you kind of
[17:25] go and then the Lord kind of changes
[17:26] direction and then you're kind of left
[17:28] dangling which is good because then it's
[17:30] not us it's got to be the Lord. But you
[17:32] know, the last couple of services, um,
[17:35] uh, I felt the Lord was kind of
[17:38] directing me in these this direction.
[17:40] And it's unusual, very unusual. Not
[17:43] unusual when it's your home church, but
[17:46] unusual, but kind of it's almost
[17:48] carrying on from what brother Chad's
[17:50] been speaking on the similar subject,
[17:52] which is good. It's always nice when we
[17:55] can have that sort of continuity. And
[17:56] like I said, if it's yourself speaking,
[17:57] then that's nice. But if you're being
[17:59] inspired and then let's just go that
[18:01] way. So our thought this evening is you
[18:04] are the living word manifested. You are
[18:07] the living word manifested. Pardon me.
[18:11] As I said it's also almost continuing on
[18:15] from brother Chad because I had to
[18:17] shorten it down a little bit because you
[18:18] know you are the living word made
[18:20] manifest in simplicity but that's a
[18:22] little bit long but it truly is that
[18:24] simple. Um,
[18:27] so many of us get so caught up with
[18:30] being complex, you know, and we end up
[18:32] getting complex is because we're not
[18:34] complex, but we're not supposed to be,
[18:37] you know, and so the subject when we
[18:40] when we would hear the subject, you are
[18:42] the living word made manifest,
[18:44] then immediately we would think, oo,
[18:46] that's complicated, but it's actually
[18:48] not complicated. And you know, if if if
[18:52] I can just bring something in a simple
[18:54] way that we can catch the picture, then
[18:56] then it's then it's good. if we would go
[18:59] out of here with loads of long words and
[19:00] not knowing what everything meant. And
[19:02] I've, you know, it's funny because I
[19:05] said years ago, I said, I remember
[19:07] preaching about um uh you know, those
[19:10] those guys that go would go to a
[19:12] convention and they go to this
[19:14] convention, they come back on the
[19:15] convention high and you know, you say,
[19:18] "Oh, it's just amazing. You should have
[19:20] been there. You should have heard it.
[19:21] Oh, it was just oh, it was just Oh." And
[19:24] you say, "Well, what was preached?" And
[19:26] they're like, at me.
[19:29] I don't know, but it was good.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; And you know that's kind of and then I
[19:34] think we went somewhere literally two
[19:37] weeks maybe later and that exact thing
[19:39] happened. Somebody was talking about
[19:42] this and I just we just said look you
[19:43] know so what was preached and they said
[19:45] but I don't know but it was good and it
[19:48] was it was comical but what it is is if
[19:50] you go somewhere see the sometimes the
[19:52] simplest things that are preached are
[19:53] the things that kind of stay with us the
[19:55] longest
[19:56] &gt;&gt; and you know a a good school teacher is
[20:00] somebody who you can still remember the
[20:03] things that they told you
[20:05] &gt;&gt; and you know for me school was a bit of
[20:08] a drag because that's not my apartment.
[20:11] But there's still things that I remember
[20:14] because it was made simple.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; It's like you guys with your inches.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; It's like, yeah. So, how long is this?
[20:26] Well, it's 4 foot and 38 and 416 of a.
[20:32] But then brother John the other day he
[20:36] just got his pen out and he marked on
[20:37] the barn door, barn wall, whatever it
[20:40] was. He drew a few lines. He says,
[20:42] "Well, look," he said, "It sort of goes
[20:43] up and it goes down." I was like, "Well,
[20:44] that's fair. Do it. It's like 10 and a
[20:45] half." He says, "Well, there's your
[20:46] quarters. Then there's this." And he
[20:48] explained it. It was like the penny kind
[20:49] of dropped. So there's a way of
[20:51] explaining something. And that's
[20:53] basically my goal in life. Because my
[20:57] personal testimony is I sat in church
[20:59] until I was an adult with three kids
[21:00] that were yay big. Um, and you come out
[21:03] of church and you would It's I don't
[21:05] know if you know the story of the
[21:06] Empress New Clothes, but it's like I was
[21:09] always that little kid when I was like
[21:12] 10 years ago. I was always the little
[21:14] kid that didn't I was the other people
[21:16] that didn't want to admit that they
[21:18] didn't know what they were talking
[21:18] about. You know, the long words that are
[21:20] used and you don't know what they mean.
[21:22] So, if we can just kind of break it down
[21:24] and
[21:26] &gt;&gt; take it into bite-sized chunks, then we
[21:28] can understand and draw it on the side
[21:30] of the barn.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. in in a language that we can
[21:33] understand.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; You know,
[21:37] &gt;&gt; things don't have to be complicated.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; You know, God is hidden and revealed in
[21:45] simplicity.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Let's just read that. We're going to
[21:49] come back to this scripture a couple of
[21:50] times. Let's go to Luke chapter 10.
[21:54] Let's go to Luke chapter 10. Like I
[21:55] said, we'll come back to this a few
[21:56] times.
[22:00] We're going to read 19- 24.
[22:03] Luke 10:19- 24.
[22:08] The Lord Jesus says,
[22:11] "Behold, I give unto you power to tread
[22:12] on serpents and scorpions over the over
[22:15] all the power of the enemy, and nothing
[22:17] shall by any means hurt you.
[22:19] Notwithstanding
[22:21] in this, rejoice not."
[22:24] The spirits are subject unto you, but
[22:26] rather rejoice because your names are
[22:28] written in heaven. In that hour the Lord
[22:30] Jesus rejoiced in his spirit and said, I
[22:32] thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven
[22:33] and earth, that thou hast hid these
[22:35] things from the wise and prudent and
[22:37] hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[22:40] Father, for it seemed good in thy sight.
[22:42] All things are delivered to me now of
[22:44] the Father. No man knoweth who the Son
[22:46] is but the Father, and who the Father is
[22:48] but the Son, and he whom the Son will
[22:51] reveal him. And he turned again unto his
[22:54] disciples and said privately, "Blessed
[22:55] are the eyes which see the things that
[22:58] ye see." And I want you to just listen
[23:00] to this verse 24
[23:03] because this is astounding. It says,"For
[23:05] I tell you that many," listen to this,
[23:08] not just kings, because the kings don't
[23:09] particularly have to be prophets or
[23:11] anyone spiritual, but prophets,
[23:14] many prophets and kings have desired to
[23:17] see the things which you see and have
[23:20] not seen them, and to hear the things
[23:22] which you hear and have not heard them.
[23:24] You know, it doesn't matter how uh how
[23:26] much the the prophets in the Old
[23:28] Testament or not all the prophets. The
[23:30] prophets, you see, when when a book's
[23:32] got a seal on it and you peel off the
[23:34] first four books, you can only go as far
[23:36] as that
[23:37] &gt;&gt; and then you peel off more, you can only
[23:39] go as far as that.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And you can you see what I mean?
[23:42] &gt;&gt; And so even in the Old Testament,
[23:44] everything was foreshadowing. And and
[23:45] you get um
[23:48] like Abraham and Sarah buried in the
[23:50] promised land. You get Isaac buried in
[23:52] the promised land. They saw they saw
[23:55] what was going on, but they didn't see
[23:57] what you see.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; So it, you know, blessed are your eyes.
[24:02] Blessed are your ears. The things that
[24:04] we hear now
[24:06] &gt;&gt; is just like on such another level.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And we don't struggle to understand it,
[24:12] do we?
[24:13] &gt;&gt; It's just simple.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; You see, like I said, we get so many
[24:18] hang-ups on being simple. Everybody
[24:20] wants to be complicated. I don't know
[24:22] how it is in the US, but in England, I
[24:24] might have said this before, you know, a
[24:26] cleaner, that's that would be a cleaner
[24:27] who would come and like clean a a
[24:29] building or whatever, they don't call
[24:31] them cleaners anymore. It's called a
[24:34] hygiene technician.
[24:36] That's true story. That's true story.
[24:39] You know, that's just one example. You
[24:41] know, everything that we have in life
[24:43] has got some fancy name. Nobody wants to
[24:45] be simple anymore.
[24:47] But you see the funny thing is God
[24:49] himself
[24:51] is reveals and hides himself in
[24:53] simplicity.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; The very thing that we
[24:58] don't want.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; So actually when we have complexes about
[25:02] being simple actually we getting
[25:05] complexes about being like him. True.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; True story. You see, everybody wants to
[25:11] be,
[25:13] &gt;&gt; but actually the Lord's the one who
[25:14] humbled himself.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "Let this mind
[25:17] be in being you that was in Christ
[25:19] Jesus."
[25:20] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have the same attitude
[25:21] in all things.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; So simplify ourselves, humble ourselves
[25:25] down. And you know the Lord, many times
[25:29] the Lord will humble us through
[25:30] situations. And we know enough about
[25:32] that and we all do.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; But many times the Lord will humble us,
[25:36] humble us through situations. But you
[25:38] know, many times the Lord gives you the
[25:41] opportunity for you to humble yourself
[25:45] &gt;&gt; and then he'll wait for you to take it.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; True story.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; He will wait for you to take it.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; See, we need to just accept the way that
[25:55] he is choosing to reveal himself.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; And he's choosing to reveal himself
[25:59] through you in a simple way.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not looking for all the like
[26:05] brother Bannon would say the stuffed
[26:07] church and all the rest of it. He's
[26:08] looking to reveal himself in simplicity.
[26:10] If he has always revealed himself in
[26:12] simplicity then he always will.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; So if you want to be used of the Lord
[26:17] and you say well I want to see the the
[26:18] Lord that I want the Lord to be seen in
[26:20] my life then just be simple be humble.
[26:23] Be simple just normal. You know, you
[26:26] know, when you look through the Bible,
[26:29] you look through right up to our day,
[26:31] all the men that the Lord used were
[26:33] simple. They were like, you know,
[26:35] farmers, fishermen, just
[26:39] tent makers.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; They were just simple people. Now,
[26:43] there's nothing wrong with being clever.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's not about
[26:47] that. We're not talking about that. But
[26:48] we're just talking. See, even the
[26:50] cleverest people can just be the the
[26:51] humblest people, the simplest people.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; You see?
[26:56] You say, "Well, what about Paul and
[26:57] Moses? They were both super clever."
[27:00] Yeah, but before the Lord could use
[27:02] them, he had to humble them down.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; He had to make them nothing. The The
[27:06] thing is, it's like on the way here, I
[27:09] wasn't finished. And I was about
[27:11] breaking up in tears. And it's like I
[27:14] said, I said to Mar, I said, "Well," I
[27:15] said, "The good thing is, you know, if
[27:18] if every she said, "You were fine." I
[27:19] said, "I'm not fine." I said, "But I
[27:21] suppose if I was fine, then it wouldn't
[27:23] be good."
[27:25] You know, we need to rely on the Lord.
[27:27] You know, if if I would come up here and
[27:28] just say a few words and you know,
[27:30] that's that's the thing. I'm not Paul.
[27:33] But, you know, for those who knew me
[27:34] from the old life, the old Simon, mate,
[27:37] I was the middle of every party. I was
[27:40] the one like this. I was one with the
[27:41] best jokes. I was one with this and I
[27:43] was like, and you get to the point where
[27:45] you can't say anything anymore. you're
[27:46] just like kicked around and kicked in
[27:48] the corner and everyone runs over the
[27:49] top of you and you just sometimes that
[27:51] little
[27:52] sticky out of nature comes up and sticks
[27:54] up and says, "Yeah, well actually but
[27:56] it's like well afterwards you feel so
[27:57] bad." You say, "Lord, forgive me. I
[27:59] shouldn't have said that. Just let
[27:59] everyone kick over the top. It's fine.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; It's fine." But you know when the Lord
[28:04] kind of humbles us down then suddenly we
[28:06] can't speak. But if I would speak then
[28:08] it wouldn't be good anyway.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Just don't ask me to be a wedding.
[28:16] whatever it is.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean?
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Because when you stand there, it just
[28:22] doesn't work.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; All is well. See, Paul and Moses had to
[28:27] be humbled before God could manifest
[28:30] himself through them. Don't forget,
[28:32] brother says he like Moses was it was
[28:34] the Lord Jesus Christ in Moses. It was
[28:36] the Lord in Paul. It was the Lord in all
[28:38] these ones. And the Lord can only use us
[28:41] when we are humbled down. You know, Paul
[28:43] and Moses had to be simplified
[28:48] &gt;&gt; to be used because if if the Lord
[28:50] reveals himself in simplicity, there's
[28:52] only one way it's going to be done and
[28:53] that's in a simple way.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; But says here in 63,
[29:00] he says it's God hiding himself in
[29:01] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[29:03] same. He says, catch those two
[29:04] scriptures. Who has believed our report?
[29:06] And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[29:08] revealed? Even then Jesus thanked God
[29:10] that he had hid the mysteries from the
[29:12] wise and prudent and would reveal it to
[29:15] babes such as would learn
[29:17] &gt;&gt; for it seemed good to God to do that.
[29:20] Now from this text or I call it from the
[29:22] scripture reading I draw this text God
[29:24] hiding himself then revealing himself in
[29:26] the same and for the tapes I keep
[29:29] repeating. So for the tapes because
[29:30] they're taping it see and we can listen
[29:32] to it again. as God hiding himself in
[29:34] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[29:37] same. It's a strange thing to think how
[29:39] that God does such a thing as that. God
[29:41] will hide himself in something so simple
[29:45] that it'll cause a wise man to miss it a
[29:48] million miles
[29:50] &gt;&gt; then turn right back around in that some
[29:53] simple thing in simplicity of his way of
[29:55] working and reveal himself right out
[29:59] again. I thought I made a text. I
[30:01] thought we might study this before we go
[30:02] into the great teachings of the seven
[30:04] seals. Many miss him by the way he
[30:08] reveals himself.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; You see,
[30:10] &gt;&gt; we are so busy looking. This is why, you
[30:14] know, when the Lord Jesus came the first
[30:15] time, they missed him.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, talk about how can you miss it?
[30:19] You know, that's a bit of an Easter
[30:20] message, but you know, when the Lord
[30:23] Jesus is crucified, I mean, you could
[30:25] work, brother. I mean, in Daniel 7:2,
[30:26] you could work it out to the day that
[30:29] the Lord comes in on the on the ass of a
[30:32] fool
[30:33] &gt;&gt; and they're even in the temple singing
[30:35] it for goodness sake. Seriously.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; And all religious and all pious with the
[30:39] suits on all riding on with the gold
[30:42] scroll, you know, cuz they, you know,
[30:45] riding on an ass on the f of an ass. And
[30:47] there's a big noise outside and like
[30:49] what's going on? And they go and look
[30:51] out and oh, it's just somebody on a ass
[30:55] and on the f of an ass. And they close
[30:56] the curtain. And then they pick up the
[30:59] old scroll and he readjusts his gold
[31:01] necklace.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And riding on a f of an ass.
[31:05] Like for real.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; For real. But you see because it in
[31:09] theory they're looking for it. But
[31:12] actually, when it happens, it's so
[31:14] simple.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And the donkey didn't have any bling.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; You know, it didn't have no chrome on it
[31:20] or anything. And he was just, let's face
[31:22] it, the Lord had been beaten.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; He was dirty.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; He was dirty. If that was your neighbor,
[31:30] &gt;&gt; maybe you wouldn't want to go and help
[31:32] him
[31:32] &gt;&gt; without a pair of gloves. No, seriously.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? like the Lord
[31:36] was beaten in such a way and the donkey
[31:38] and everything and the dust pounding up
[31:40] and the look out because it wasn't how
[31:42] they thought it was going to be
[31:45] &gt;&gt; they rejected it. You see many miss him
[31:48] by the way he reveals himself
[31:52] &gt;&gt; you know
[31:55] for his bride
[31:57] because I like this thought I like this
[31:59] small thought because we come from him
[32:01] right we know that it's Ephesians 1 we
[32:04] were chosen him before the foundation of
[32:06] the world because we come from him we're
[32:08] actually made of the same material
[32:11] &gt;&gt; so any of you people out there you know
[32:13] you've you've got your father maybe
[32:15] father John and he's got um Peter
[32:18] sitting next to you and he's got Levi
[32:19] and Emma. If you would kind of do all
[32:21] the DNA testing stuff, you'd be like,
[32:22] "Oh yeah, that's John."
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because because they're made from
[32:26] the same material.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; And so if we come from God somewhere,
[32:30] there's got to be that. And that's what
[32:32] we call talk about the faith seed.
[32:33] There's got to be that faith seed DNA
[32:35] somewhere there
[32:37] &gt;&gt; that reflects the father. We're made of
[32:40] the same material, you know. And I like
[32:41] this, like I said, this small thought,
[32:42] you know, we speak the same language as
[32:44] God. And that's why when we when the
[32:46] Lord reveals himself in simplicity, we
[32:49] it's not hard for us to understand
[32:51] because he speaks our language. Listen,
[32:53] the Lord said that we're his sheep.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Feed my sheep." He said he
[32:58] said, "Feed my lambs."
[33:00] &gt;&gt; But he's the lamb of God.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; So, we're all speaking the same lang
[33:05] lamb language.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; You know, we speak the same language. We
[33:08] don't struggle to understand these
[33:10] things.
[33:11] See, when the Lord reflects, sorry,
[33:15] reveals himself to us, you know, for us,
[33:19] we it's not a foreign language. We we
[33:21] understand and when we when we hear it
[33:23] because we're made of the same material,
[33:24] we're actually looking into the mirror.
[33:26] And that's why we say looking into the
[33:28] mirror of the word, you know, we see
[33:29] ourselves reflecting something in us.
[33:31] There's just that DNA. You don't look
[33:34] I'm sure in the past they've done like
[33:35] tests you know when the parents don't
[33:37] know who they are this that and the
[33:38] other or they've been lost and all the
[33:39] rest of it they come together there's
[33:41] some kind of connection there they can't
[33:43] understand it and you know the son the
[33:44] longlost son comes home and the father's
[33:47] maybe I don't know but the when families
[33:49] come together there's an unseen
[33:51] connection and he's kind of you don't
[33:53] you know maybe it's the way I've said it
[33:54] before we scratch your head or however
[33:55] it is it's just you can see the
[33:57] reflection of the father in the sun and
[33:59] so and and now many miss him And many
[34:03] miss who you are.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Although you're the word. Listen, unless
[34:07] Although you're the word that's
[34:09] revealed, manifested in this day. Yeah.
[34:13] The Lord chose himself to reveal himself
[34:14] in his bride, right? You are the word
[34:17] made manifest. The the epistles of of of
[34:19] the word. Many will miss it because we
[34:22] look the way we do.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; I don't see any of the big gold check
[34:26] necklaces. I don't see any bling. I
[34:28] don't see any fanciness. I don't say
[34:29] we're just simple people, but we're
[34:32] simple because the DNA of our father is
[34:34] simple
[34:35] &gt;&gt; in the way that he reveals himself. So
[34:37] the way that we reveal ourselves is the
[34:39] same way.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Now,
[34:43] we are simple, but we ain't stupid.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking for you.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; No, it's true. We're simple, but we
[34:53] ain't stupid. We're simple, but we're
[34:56] not ignorant. Yeah.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Just go to Psalms 19.
[35:01] Psalms 197 and 8. I can turn to it if
[35:04] you want. Psalms 197 and 8
[35:16] says he's going forth is from the end of
[35:18] the heaven and his circuit unto the ends
[35:20] of it. And there is nothing hid from the
[35:22] heat thereof. The law of the Lord is
[35:25] perfect. converting the soul. Sorry, I
[35:27] read six. The law of the Lord is
[35:29] perfect, converting the soul. The
[35:31] testimony of the Lord is sure, making
[35:34] wise the simple. The statutes of the
[35:37] Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The
[35:39] commandment of the Lord is pure,
[35:41] enlightening the eyes. So notice here it
[35:44] says, "The law of the Lord
[35:47] maketh wise." He maketh wise the simple.
[35:50] So anyone who humbles himself before the
[35:52] Lord, he makes them wise. Now, we're not
[35:54] talking about worldly wisdom. It says
[35:56] the commandments of the Lord are pure
[35:59] enlightening the eyes. The law and the
[36:01] commandments are his word. It's his
[36:03] word. And so, because we've humbled
[36:05] ourselves, being the bride of Christ,
[36:07] we've humbled ourselves. Okay?
[36:11] The law of the Lord is making us wise
[36:13] and the commandment of the Lord is
[36:15] enlightening the eyes. He's giving us
[36:16] revelation. Because we humble ourselves,
[36:18] it pleases the Lord. Revelation is a
[36:20] gift. Don't forget. And remember, the
[36:22] Lord's hiding himself in simplicity.
[36:23] He's revealing himself unto babes that
[36:25] will learn. I think we read the
[36:27] scripture already. You see, so through
[36:29] the word, we're made wise. Now, we're
[36:31] not stupid. We're simple. And the wisdom
[36:35] we have is not worldly wisdom. So,
[36:39] you teenagers that think like you can
[36:41] make a million bucks by making a phone
[36:42] call, don't go out from here thinking,
[36:44] "Yes, now I've got the wisdom." We're
[36:46] not talking about that. We're speaking
[36:48] about the the the godly wisdom, not
[36:51] earthly wisdom. And listen, when we talk
[36:53] about the intelligent, we're not talking
[36:54] about physical intelligence. This is the
[36:56] beautiful thing about the Lord is that
[36:58] when he reveals himself, it's about he's
[37:00] revealing himself to people that will
[37:02] learn, people that want to learn,
[37:05] &gt;&gt; people that have got a hunger in their
[37:06] heart for the Lord. Revelation does not
[37:09] come through learning. It's a gift of
[37:11] God.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; It's and it's sovereignly given.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; It's sovereignly given. It's nothing
[37:17] we've done. It's purely by grace. Now,
[37:19] let's just turn back to 2 Corinthians
[37:21] again if we can. 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[37:24] again.
[37:29] Let's read it. It says, "Do we," we're
[37:32] going to read 1:3. "Do we again commend
[37:34] uh do we begin to commend ourselves or
[37:37] need we as some others epistles of
[37:41] commendation to you or letters of
[37:43] commendation from you? Ye are our
[37:45] epistle in our hearts known and read of
[37:47] all men. For as much as ye are
[37:49] manifestly declared to be the epistle of
[37:51] Christ ministered by us, not with ink,
[37:53] not with the spirit of the living God,
[37:54] but not in tables of stone, but in the
[37:56] fleshy tables of the heart. Listen, this
[37:59] letters of commendation and a and us
[38:02] being a written epistle, this is
[38:04] actually describing something being
[38:06] witnessed. Here we are. It's speaking
[38:09] about something being witnessed. And
[38:11] when we talk about being witness, it's a
[38:12] living testimony. It's a living witness
[38:14] of the word.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Now when we are manifestly declared to
[38:20] be the epistles of of of of of Christ
[38:24] then it means that actually we are
[38:26] witnesses of the word preached. I want
[38:28] you to notice here it says here in um
[38:32] verse three for as much as ye are
[38:34] manifest declared to be listen carefully
[38:37] the epistle of Christ ministered by us.
[38:41] So basically Paul's looking on these
[38:43] people and he's telling them that's the
[38:46] bride of the first church age. He's
[38:48] looking on these people and he's telling
[38:49] them that you are manifestly declared to
[38:53] be the epistle of Christ ministered and
[38:55] put this is Paul speaking by me
[38:58] &gt;&gt; by me. So actually they have actually
[39:01] become
[39:03] a written epistle. Now an epistle is a
[39:05] letter. a letter which is a testimony, a
[39:08] witness, a letter um a written letter.
[39:11] So we are written epistles and we are
[39:13] manifesting the word and actually those
[39:16] around us can now read what's being
[39:19] preached in our day by reading our
[39:22] lives.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; You see it says we are read of all men.
[39:25] Ye are uh our epistle uh written in our
[39:28] hearts known and read of all men. You
[39:30] know, when I when I read that, I
[39:32] thought, you know, it's the old uh
[39:36] 31st of October thing going on. You
[39:38] can't go to Manard's or somewhere
[39:41] without some great big orange teddy bear
[39:43] with fangs
[39:44] &gt;&gt; booing at you.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; It's like, what's going on?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Right. But and it just seems, listen
[39:49] carefully, it just seems so in your
[39:52] face, doesn't it?
[39:53] &gt;&gt; It's so in your face,
[39:56] &gt;&gt; bang about what are you?
[39:59] Because we are known and read of all
[40:01] men.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And whether they want it or not, we are
[40:06] walking around a living. You know when
[40:08] it says in the heart, it says there in
[40:10] verse three, if you look at the end, it
[40:11] says not in tables of stone. So it's not
[40:13] your big orange teddy bear. It says but
[40:15] in fleshy tables of the heart. It's not
[40:17] something physical like a like a it's
[40:20] the heart. When it speaks about the
[40:21] heart, we're speaking about life.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; So it's a living testimony. So, as we
[40:26] walk around, whether they like it or you
[40:28] don't, Brother Chad's been going through
[40:30] the airports, and there's been thousands
[40:33] of people
[40:35] &gt;&gt; that have had to pass him.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not in people's faces, if you
[40:38] get my meaning. But actually, they have
[40:40] no choice but to read that letter.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; See, whether they look at you and look
[40:44] at you disdainfully, well, they've
[40:46] looked at this and looked at it
[40:47] distastefully.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; See, whether they look at it and think,
[40:50] "Oh, mate, that's a really nice family."
[40:51] That's then they've actually looked at
[40:53] it. They've looked at your family out
[40:55] and about acting how you should,
[40:57] headship of the father, watching out for
[40:58] his children, this that and the other,
[40:59] caring for his family. They've seen you
[41:02] &gt;&gt; and they've said and they've said,
[41:03] "Mate, that's a really nice family."
[41:04] What are they saying? They are saying,
[41:06] "Mate, you know, actually the way that
[41:08] the Lord has the family, that's actually
[41:10] because that's what you are. You're
[41:11] becoming this reflection, the word made
[41:15] manifest, living epistles, living." And
[41:17] that's what that's that's like I said,
[41:19] you know, we it's kind of in your face
[41:21] everything of the world, but actually
[41:22] when you think about it, wherever we go,
[41:24] we are also that billboard wherever we
[41:26] go. Yeah. Yeah. Don't forget that one.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to John one. This is
[41:31] quite nice. Let's go to John one if we
[41:33] can.
[41:36] John 1 1:9.
[41:41] So this says speaking now we're about
[41:43] living epistles, the witnesses. Yep.
[41:46] Witnesses of the word. It says, "In the
[41:47] beginning was the word and the word was
[41:49] with God and the word was God. The same
[41:52] was in the beginning with God. All
[41:54] things were made by him. Without him was
[41:56] not anything made that was made. In him
[41:59] was life and the life was the light of
[42:02] men. And the light shined in darkness
[42:04] and darkness comprehended it not. There
[42:06] was a man sent from John whose name
[42:09] sorry there was a man sent from God
[42:10] whose name was John. The same came for a
[42:13] witness to bear witness of the light
[42:16] that all men through him might believe.
[42:18] He was not that light but was sent to
[42:21] bear witness of that light. That was the
[42:24] true light which lightth every man that
[42:26] cometh into the world. Amen. Notice
[42:30] John was not that light. That's right.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; But was a witness of that light.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so that light actually was in
[42:39] John.
[42:40] The same light although he was a
[42:42] witness. The same light is the life.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; The light was in John and it was shining
[42:47] out and it was manifesting itself. The
[42:49] Lord was manifesting himself. That light
[42:51] was manifesting himself through John.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he was not that light. John the
[42:57] Baptist was only listening
[43:01] there on the river when he appeared.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; He was a witness of the light.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was only standing there when he
[43:11] appeared.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he's 65.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "I wasn't the one that appeared
[43:18] down on the river. I was only standing
[43:20] there when he appeared. I'm not the one
[43:22] that performs these things and fortell
[43:24] these things that happen so perfectly as
[43:25] they are. I'm only one that's near when
[43:28] he does it. I was only a voice that he
[43:31] used to say it." Listen, John the
[43:33] Baptist, when he was there, the Lord was
[43:36] living through him and he was baptizing.
[43:38] He was doing that thing that the Lord
[43:40] had shown him to do in the desert.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord had showed him to do that. He
[43:44] was doing that. So, who was it that was
[43:46] actually doing it?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't John. It was the Lord Jesus
[43:49] Christ.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; So, now we've got the same thing again
[43:52] here, Brother Bannon. I was only near
[43:54] when he does it. I was only the voice he
[43:56] used to say it. It wasn't what I knew.
[43:58] It's what I surrendered myself to that
[44:02] he spoke through. This is the thing with
[44:05] humbling yourself. To humble yourself
[44:07] isn't just like the old days of before
[44:12] Luther came to the truth of whipping
[44:14] yourself and beating yourself. The old
[44:15] Catholic doctrine. That's not it's not
[44:17] that's not humbling yourself. Humbling
[44:19] yourself is surrendering.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Surrendering to God.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "I just surrendered
[44:27] myself to that he spoke through. It
[44:28] isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel."
[44:30] No, it was a manifestation of the son of
[44:32] God. It wasn't the angel his message. It
[44:34] was a mystery that God unfolded. It's
[44:36] not a man. It's God. The angel was not
[44:39] the son of man. He was a messenger from
[44:40] the son of man. The son of man is
[44:42] Christ. He is the one that you're
[44:43] feeding on. You're not feeding on a man.
[44:44] His words will fail. You're feeding on
[44:46] the unfailing body word of the son of
[44:48] man. Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord's good. So where am I? So that
[44:56] uh
[44:59] I told you I did warn you did not say
[45:00] it. There we go. And I'm old fashioned
[45:02] so everything's on paper.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; You see, brother Brandon was not that
[45:07] light. Although the light was in him.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he was not that light, but he
[45:13] was sent to bear witness of that light.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to Matthew 28 if we can.
[45:18] Matthew 28. We're just going to touch on
[45:20] this little
[45:26] We're going to read 1:7
[45:30] to 7. Speaking about witnesses,
[45:33] witnesses of the gospel, witnesses of
[45:34] the word. In the end of the Sabbath, it
[45:37] began to dawn de to to dawn towards the
[45:39] first day of the week. Come Mary and
[45:40] Magdalene and the other Mary to
[45:41] separate. And behold, there was a great
[45:42] earthquake. For the angel of the Lord
[45:44] descended from heaven, and came and
[45:46] rolled back the stone from the door, and
[45:48] sat upon it. His countenance was like
[45:51] lightning. His raignment was white as
[45:53] snow. And for fear did the keepers the
[45:57] key the keepers did shake and became as
[45:59] dead men.
[46:01] And the angel answered and said unto
[46:02] him, "Fear not, for I know that thou ye
[46:04] seek Jesus which was crucified.
[46:07] He is not here for he is risen." And he
[46:09] said, "Come and see the place where the
[46:11] Lord lay. Go quickly and tell his
[46:13] disciples that he is risen from the
[46:15] dead. Behold, he goeth before you into
[46:17] Galilee." that there ye shall see him.
[46:20] Lo, I have told you. So, here we go
[46:22] again. Listen. This is now the angel of
[46:25] the Lord. But it was not the Lord Jesus.
[46:27] It wasn't the Lord Jesus. It was the
[46:28] angel of the Lord. Notice in verse five,
[46:31] the L the angel answered said unto the
[46:33] woman, "Fear ye not, for I know that ye
[46:36] seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not
[46:38] here, but he is risen." So here the
[46:41] angel um he was a witness of that light.
[46:44] Again, you see, always the life of God
[46:47] will witness the word. And so, he was
[46:50] here as a witness that to to to to Mary
[46:53] telling basically a witness is somebody
[46:54] that tells you of something that's
[46:56] happened. Yeah. So, he's telling her
[46:58] that the Lord is risen. And so, notice
[47:00] his countenance shone. It says in verse
[47:02] three, his countenance was like
[47:04] lightning. His raignment white as snow.
[47:06] And you know, one thing that we we you
[47:08] can't be in the presence of God without
[47:10] being changed. Yes,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; that angel came from the presence of
[47:14] God, a manifestation of God. It comes
[47:16] from God himself. It's impossible to
[47:18] come from God without
[47:21] something being changed. Look at Moses.
[47:24] I'm going to read Moses actually. Exodus
[47:26] 34. Exodus 34.
[47:29] Let's read Exodus 34. We'll read 29-35.
[47:34] It says, "In it came to pass when Moses
[47:36] came down from the Mount Si with the two
[47:38] tables of the testimony in Moses' hand.
[47:40] when he came down from the mount that
[47:43] Moses whisp not that the skin of his
[47:45] face shone while he talked with him. And
[47:47] when Aaron and all the children of
[47:49] Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of
[47:50] his face shone, and they were afraid to
[47:52] come nigh him. And Moses called unto
[47:54] them, and Aaron, and all the rulers of
[47:56] the congregation returned unto him, and
[47:58] Moses talked with them. And afterward
[47:59] the children of Israel came nigh, and he
[48:01] gave them in commandment, and all the
[48:02] Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si
[48:05] until Moses had done speaking with him,
[48:07] he put a veil on his face. But when the
[48:09] Lord went in before, but when Moses went
[48:11] in before the Lord to speak unto him, he
[48:13] took the veil off until he came out. And
[48:14] he came out and spake to the children of
[48:16] Israel, that which was commanded. And
[48:18] the children of Israel saw the face of
[48:20] Moses that the skin of Moses' face
[48:22] shone. And Moses put the veil on his
[48:24] face again until he went in to speak
[48:26] with him. Amen. So Moses had a message.
[48:30] Moses obviously was a messenger.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Moses had a message from God. He's
[48:34] coming back to the children of Israel
[48:36] now with his message. He was not that
[48:38] light but he was a witness of what that
[48:41] light was telling him. There was a
[48:43] message to be given. And you know Moses
[48:45] was so filled with the spirit that even
[48:47] his face shone. He was in the presence
[48:49] of God. It can't be that we can be in
[48:51] the presence of God without being
[48:52] changed.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, sometimes, you know,
[48:55] sometimes, look, we all go through the
[48:56] ups and downs a little bit.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you'll go to church and
[48:59] the Lord will really strike your heart
[49:01] with something and you'll come out and
[49:02] you'll you'll feel something's changed
[49:04] inside. And it's because you've touched
[49:06] the hem of his garment. It's because
[49:08] you've you you've drawn close to him and
[49:10] he's touched you in a special way. We
[49:12] can't be in the presence of God without
[49:14] being changed. Steven had a message.
[49:18] Steven actually had a message. He was
[49:19] preaching in the in the council and he
[49:22] was not that light. He wasn't that
[49:24] light, but he was a witness of that
[49:26] light. And when he stood before the
[49:29] council, they looked on him steadfastly.
[49:31] They saw his face as as though it was
[49:33] the face of an angel.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Angel is a messenger, but they say his
[49:37] face was shining. Eve's face was the
[49:39] face of an angel. Let's just read that.
[49:41] I know we're back and forth in the
[49:42] scriptures and it's it's Wednesday and I
[49:44] know we're tired, but let's just have a
[49:45] look. It's it's only one verse. In fact,
[49:47] I'll just read it. It's verse uh chapter
[49:49] 6:15.
[49:50] It says, "And and this is I don't want
[49:52] to read the whole thing. It's just
[49:53] this." And all that sat in the council
[49:54] looking steadfastly on him saw his face
[49:57] as it had been the face of an angel. Why
[50:00] didn't they listen to him then?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Because it wasn't simple. Oh, sorry. It
[50:06] wasn't complicated. He didn't have the
[50:07] gold chains. He didn't have the golden
[50:09] chariot outside. It was just a humble,
[50:11] simple person that was filled with the
[50:13] Holy Spirit. It says and verse 8 and
[50:15] Steven full of faith and power and great
[50:16] wonders and miracles among the people.
[50:18] If the Lord used him, put it this way,
[50:20] if the Lord used him in that way, great
[50:22] many miracles, full of faith and power,
[50:24] then I'll tell you one thing, he had to
[50:26] have been humble.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; He had to have been simple.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord was choosing to
[50:30] reveal himself through and then he
[50:31] preaches this phenomenal sermon.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; How can that be anyone else but God
[50:36] speaking through a man?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; So, he had to have humbled himself. He
[50:40] had to have simplified his life. Yes.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? The Lord's good.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; See,
[50:47] I just I remember when um I think it was
[50:50] brother Eddie Biscll in his testimony.
[50:53] Was it him going well I think it was
[50:54] before he shot that moose that walked
[50:55] out on the road. Do you remember that
[50:56] one? And he's in the car with brother I
[50:58] think that's right. In the car with
[50:59] brother Bham and I think he sleeps and
[51:01] he wakes up and he said brother Brown's
[51:03] face was kind of white. Oh is that Billy
[51:04] Paul?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Eddie Biscoll. That's it. And his face
[51:08] hairs were sticking out and his face was
[51:10] white.
[51:12] when you're in the presence of God, your
[51:14] face has got to change. It's just
[51:17] physically impossible to be. And so now,
[51:20] even when brother Eddie, I think he says
[51:22] he says he was absolutely scared to kind
[51:23] of even look sideways, he knew something
[51:25] was there. But even when the Lord when
[51:27] this when the when the when when that
[51:28] when that pillar of fire left, when the
[51:30] Lord left the car as they're still
[51:32] cruising down the road, he kind of looks
[51:34] across. Brother Ram's face was a witness
[51:36] of what had just happened.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You can't there's
[51:39] no hiding it. There's no hiding it. When
[51:41] the prophet had been in the presence of
[51:43] the Lord, even after so many times, his
[51:45] face still turned ashen. You know, when
[51:48] you look at picture of brother Adam when
[51:49] he's he passed away when he was 56, he
[51:52] looks like he's in his late 70s. You
[51:55] can't be in and out of the presence of
[51:57] God like that without why the Lord Jesus
[51:59] himself. Imagine that vessel that the
[52:01] Lord used and it's the presence of
[52:02] almighty God living in it day in day
[52:04] out. They they they said that he said
[52:06] before Abraham I was. They said, "You're
[52:08] not a man over 50." Why 50, not 30? He
[52:11] was 30.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Because of the the the the body was
[52:14] under such
[52:16] &gt;&gt; you can't be a this these bodies cannot
[52:19] be in the presence of God without the
[52:21] being a change.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; One of these days we're going to be
[52:24] changed totally.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord's good. And then again, because
[52:30] we're this witness, our lives witness,
[52:33] we those around us with these written
[52:34] epistles, those around us, they can see
[52:37] the change. They can see something's
[52:39] happened. You might come out of here and
[52:40] on a on a after a service and and you
[52:43] just something's changed. And somebody
[52:45] around you, maybe those close to you,
[52:47] they can see a difference. They're like,
[52:48] "Mate, you've something's happened."
[52:50] That's the whole point. You know, people
[52:52] people used to get upset with me
[52:53] because, you know, I changed my ideas,
[52:57] you know. Well, yeah, that's the whole
[52:59] point. We're supposed to
[53:00] &gt;&gt; we're supposed to change, you know, but
[53:02] people people get upset because well,
[53:04] you you know, even though you're a
[53:05] message believer and you you're
[53:06] so-called message and what you used to
[53:08] be and you do this and that and pardon
[53:10] me, you you'd allow this and allow that
[53:13] and then when you change your ideas and
[53:15] the Lord straightens you up like, "Yeah,
[53:16] but you used to." Yeah, that's the
[53:18] point.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; We used to, but we've come into the
[53:20] presence of the Lord and the Lord's
[53:22] changed us and and we can't be the same
[53:24] anymore. We can't walk anymore. You see
[53:27] what is it? We have been we've been in
[53:28] the presence of God and now we're this
[53:30] witness. We are a witness of that light.
[53:32] We're a written epistle.
[53:35] And notice we're a written epistle of
[53:37] the word preached in our day. I want to
[53:39] go back again to this 2 Corinthians.
[53:42] 2 Corinthians. And we're going to read
[53:44] verse three. It says, "For as much as ye
[53:46] are manifestly declared to be the
[53:49] epistle of Christ, ministered by us,
[53:52] written not with ink, but with the
[53:53] spirit of the living God, not in tables
[53:54] of stone, but in the fleshly tables of
[53:55] the heart." Listen, Paul is pointing
[53:57] out, like I said, that that they have
[54:01] become a written epistle of the word
[54:04] which Paul preached. So, in other words,
[54:06] if you wanted to see what Paul had
[54:08] preached, all you got to do is look at
[54:10] the people.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And remember it says known and
[54:13] read of all men. And not just those
[54:15] people are in around church. It says
[54:16] known and read of all men. You see if
[54:18] you wanted to know what what Paul
[54:20] preached just look at the saints lives.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Look at how they acted. Look at what
[54:24] they did. They were a written testimony
[54:26] of what was being preached. And that's
[54:28] how it's been through all the churches
[54:30] in the bride in the bride in the church
[54:32] ages. So you know if you want to know
[54:33] what Luther preached just look at the
[54:35] people. Look at the people and you would
[54:38] have seen that change. You would have
[54:39] seen them coming out of the Catholicism.
[54:40] You receive. You want to know what
[54:42] Wesley preached? Look at the W W W W W W
[54:43] W W W W W W W W W W W W W W Wesians, the
[54:44] way that they methodically practiced
[54:46] their religion, the way that they served
[54:48] the Lord methodically. You look at the
[54:50] way that they did it. See, then you
[54:52] could see what was being preached and
[54:55] it's got to be the same today. Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; So when we stop and think about it, if
[55:00] we do 1 + 1 is two,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; then actually
[55:05] the bride is a further manifestation of
[55:10] the word.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You know, this is not this is Simon.
[55:15] It's not a new doctrine.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; But the Lord wrote the Bible in the
[55:19] stars.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; The Lord wrote the Bible in the pyramid.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord wrote the Bible this Bible we
[55:24] have now. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; But actually, if we are written
[55:27] epistles,
[55:29] &gt;&gt; then we're actually the same thing.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; If people can pick it up your life and
[55:34] read your life and say, "Mate, you know,
[55:38] we shouldn't be doing this. We shouldn't
[55:39] be doing that because they don't do it."
[55:41] And they're reading the word or my
[55:43] goodness, why do they do so? Why? If
[55:45] they're reading the word that look, you
[55:47] say, "Well, it's not you can't get the
[55:49] seals and you can't do this and you
[55:50] can't." Well, hang about how much of the
[55:52] seals and how much of this that and the
[55:53] other can we read the pyramid?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Like the stars, you know, unless you
[55:57] know the stars and you just can't do it.
[55:59] It's it's it's just a it's it's so it's
[56:02] it's like a it's just a different This
[56:05] is like an in-depth version, but we
[56:07] should be pretty in depth.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; We should be pretty in-depth. We should
[56:12] be actually
[56:15] &gt;&gt; what the prophet preached. We should be
[56:17] living.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then people will actually,
[56:21] like I say, they they can do their
[56:23] orange big goofy teddy bears out there,
[56:26] but when they're watching us, they
[56:27] should actually be asking the question,
[56:29] what is different about these guys?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; What's different?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Because this is a revealed word. This is
[56:36] a furtherment of something that we're
[56:38] used to because we ain't used to seeing
[56:40] this,
[56:41] &gt;&gt; you know? How can they act like they do?
[56:42] How can they how can you do that? You
[56:44] know, it's like I think it's the um like
[56:47] the the old Menanites and different ones
[56:49] now. They live by law. The Aish and that
[56:51] they live by they live a real nice life,
[56:53] but they live it by a law.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; And I think there's been the younger
[56:57] sisters that are working in the pantry
[56:59] and that and they and they'll ask him,
[57:01] "Look, you know, this is what I've
[57:02] heard. They've asked them, how do you
[57:04] live like that without someone telling
[57:06] you what to do?"
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Right? Well, the thing is we become the
[57:12] word.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; In theory, we should be able I mean,
[57:16] this is going a bit far, but in theory,
[57:17] we should be able to look in the mirror
[57:18] and say, "My goodness, that's praise the
[57:21] Lord. I'm seeing the word. I'm see I'm
[57:24] reading it in my own life."
[57:26] &gt;&gt; You know, and for those of you who used
[57:27] to have a bad temper and you know, all
[57:30] if if you see the way that you've tamed
[57:31] down, you can see his progression. You
[57:34] can see the progression of how you're
[57:36] going and you can actually see yourself
[57:38] lining up with the mirror that we're
[57:39] supposed to be lining up with.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord's good.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's just go to 64. Brother says
[57:46] any influences 64. He says, remember the
[57:49] Bible said, this is now speaking about
[57:51] remember with a living manifested word.
[57:53] Remember the Bible said you are living
[57:56] written epistles read of all men. Now,
[58:00] many people won't read the Bible, but
[58:02] God has made you a living
[58:05] representative.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Hang about.
[58:09] If I would start to preach something
[58:11] that was wrong, you wouldn't be very
[58:13] happy right now.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; True story.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And there wouldn't be many amens.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But what about if we would start living
[58:22] wrong out there?
[58:23] &gt;&gt; You're doing the same thing.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. Yeah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; See each one of us, this is we we've got
[58:28] a responsibility. The Lord has made you
[58:31] a living representative. He a
[58:34] representative basically is somebody who
[58:38] represents a company or represents or an
[58:41] ambassador represents the king or
[58:42] whatever you want to represent. A
[58:44] representative is basically you look at
[58:46] that person and you that's why you know
[58:48] um someone in the medical field you
[58:51] don't want someone to represent your
[58:53] company and they got like all the studs
[58:55] and the long hair and never washed for 3
[58:58] months and you know it's like well we
[59:01] don't really want that as a
[59:03] representative for our company. You're
[59:05] looking for that cleancut nice smelling
[59:07] straight guy that's going to represent
[59:08] your company the way that you would see
[59:11] it. Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; And that's how it is with the Lord.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord's called us to be
[59:16] representative. He says, "But God has
[59:18] made Listen,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; he's not actually asked you."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "He's made you."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; But God has made you. We have no choice
[59:26] in this.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; God has made you a living
[59:29] representative. You are a walking
[59:31] letter. Should be a walking Bible.
[59:35] Christ in you. You should be the walking
[59:39] word of God. Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You should be the walking word of God.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Read of all men.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Notice if we are what we're supposed to
[59:54] be, walking living word bride. Then it
[59:58] actually would have the same effect as
[1:00:01] when someone would pick up a Bible in a
[1:00:03] bookstore and read. True.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we're not talking about all
[1:00:07] the, you know, Old Testament names and
[1:00:08] things. No. But when you when somebody
[1:00:10] picks up a Bible in a Bible store, I
[1:00:12] mean,
[1:00:14] who's been to a Bible store recently in
[1:00:17] the last five years?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the
[1:00:19] section where they've got Bibles for
[1:00:22] ladies, men,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; ladies who, you know, Bibles for
[1:00:28] teenagers, Bibles for kiddies, Bibles
[1:00:31] for I mean, they've got everything, you
[1:00:33] know. They've got Bibles where no one's
[1:00:35] going to be offended. If you would
[1:00:36] actually pick up somebody would go out
[1:00:38] in the world and pick your neighbor pick
[1:00:40] up the Bible in a bookshop the original
[1:00:43] a good King James pick it up and start
[1:00:45] reading there's going to be two things
[1:00:46] happen either they'll be convicted
[1:00:50] which shows that they're understanding
[1:00:53] what's written.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Or they'll absolutely reject it.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when they see us if we remember
[1:01:00] the Bible said you are living written
[1:01:02] epistles read of all men. Now many
[1:01:03] people won't read the Bible but God has
[1:01:05] made you a living representative. You
[1:01:07] are a walking letter. You should be a
[1:01:09] walking Bible. Christ in you. You should
[1:01:11] be the walking word of God. Right? So
[1:01:14] now when you are the walking word of God
[1:01:15] and this happens daily. You walk into a
[1:01:19] shop, two things will happen. They'll
[1:01:22] either love you or hate you.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And it's the Lord said if they hate you,
[1:01:29] it's not you that they hate because they
[1:01:30] hated me first. Why? Because you are the
[1:01:33] walking Bible. You are basically like
[1:01:36] not like the orange thing. You know what
[1:01:37] I'm saying? But you are walking out
[1:01:38] there. There's nowhere for them to look.
[1:01:40] They have You go to the counter. What
[1:01:42] they going to do?
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; What would you like? I want that one.
[1:01:48] No, not that one. This one. No. No.
[1:01:50] They've got to look at you. And when
[1:01:52] they look at you, I'm I'm telling you,
[1:01:53] you know, we we've had it recently. You
[1:01:56] know, you go to the old Starbucks and
[1:01:58] there's somebody who's um a little bit
[1:02:00] confused.com and I've got the cross in
[1:02:02] the car and I'm telling you every single
[1:02:05] time they make my coffee wrong on
[1:02:07] purpose and they give it with a smile.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; See what is it? Either you're con
[1:02:14] they're convicted
[1:02:15] and I don't think that's the case in
[1:02:17] that one or they just absolutely hate
[1:02:20] you because they hate the word.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; You see when you are that living written
[1:02:24] epistle, you're the Bible. You're on
[1:02:25] show. You're for everyone to see it and
[1:02:27] this and actually then you're doing the
[1:02:28] right thing and you don't like wait till
[1:02:31] the judgment. No, no, no. You just say,
[1:02:32] "Lord, help him. Lord, help him." You
[1:02:35] You're as nice as you can be to them.
[1:02:36] The Lord Jesus was he says he says he's
[1:02:39] kind. The Bible says God is kind to the
[1:02:42] unthankful and the evil. It's like
[1:02:44] really? So, how much more do we need to
[1:02:46] be that way? Somebody does something
[1:02:47] against you, it's fine. It's fine. You
[1:02:49] know what? The only the only problem we
[1:02:51] would have is if you raise above zero,
[1:02:53] oh, how dare you do that to me? Do you
[1:02:55] know who I am?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's all good.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:01] It's all good. Right. So, the lives, you
[1:03:04] know, so so and many times, you know,
[1:03:05] that the people do they get pricricked
[1:03:07] in the heart and like, mate, you know,
[1:03:09] I've noticed that and for you guys it's
[1:03:10] more normal.
[1:03:12] Um, but for us it's it's pretty
[1:03:16] different. It's very different. In
[1:03:17] England, it's very very different. You
[1:03:19] know, you you you have a cross in your
[1:03:20] car and people absolutely like look at
[1:03:22] your car, they'll almost key your car.
[1:03:24] It's pretty bad. But you see the or
[1:03:26] they'll see you and they'll come up to
[1:03:27] you and they'll say very rarely, you
[1:03:29] know, what a beautiful family. What are
[1:03:30] they saying? What a beautiful picture of
[1:03:32] God.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; You know, they don't know what they're
[1:03:34] saying, but they just,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; you see what I mean? Okay. So, it's so
[1:03:39] simple. We have to just surrender.
[1:03:41] Surrender ourselves. See, when the Lord
[1:03:44] takes over and lives himself through
[1:03:47] through you now, suddenly without even
[1:03:50] thinking,
[1:03:51] you're manifesting God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Who likes Chinese food in here?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Boom. I'm among family. Listen,
[1:04:01] something in me, I just can't help it.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; I just like it.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And so, there's some things in life that
[1:04:08] we just like.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And I know Brother Chuck doesn't like
[1:04:11] it.
[1:04:13] But I like it
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; and I can't help it. You see, he's
[1:04:17] manifesting who he is and I'm
[1:04:18] manifesting who I am. And it's the same
[1:04:21] thing with with when we surrender, if
[1:04:22] the Lord is in us, if it's his life in
[1:04:24] us, then we taste, we have his taste.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And we're not talking about food now.
[1:04:28] We're talking about these things,
[1:04:30] spiritual things. So without thinking
[1:04:32] about it, and now what makes Brother
[1:04:34] Chuck like the steak and chips? And I
[1:04:36] mean, I like steak and chips, but And
[1:04:37] what likes me like the Chinese? What is
[1:04:39] it? And why is it I always come back to
[1:04:40] food.
[1:04:42] But but what is it? It's just kind of
[1:04:45] something who I am. It's my it's me.
[1:04:47] It's the unseen me that just likes it.
[1:04:50] And so it's the life within me. And
[1:04:52] that's why we have all our diff that's
[1:04:54] why we're all so different because
[1:04:55] there's different each one's got a
[1:04:57] separate soul, a separate life, you
[1:04:59] know, we're not all this regimental
[1:05:00] soldiers. And so and so we're all each
[1:05:03] one of us different. But one thing we
[1:05:04] have in common is the same life of God
[1:05:06] that's in us. So for the spiritual
[1:05:08] things, we will have the same taste. We
[1:05:10] will have the same desires. Look,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; we're all here tonight because we want
[1:05:15] to change for the better.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; We want to hear from the Lord. We want
[1:05:19] to know, Lord, what can we do to to to
[1:05:22] change? What can I do? Lord, help me.
[1:05:24] See, we've got that desire in us. So, if
[1:05:27] we surrender then and there's that life
[1:05:29] inside us without helping it. We all
[1:05:31] like Chinese food. It's not a new
[1:05:34] doctrine.
[1:05:36] It's just listen, it's that simple. It's
[1:05:39] that simple. We don't have to learn this
[1:05:41] and learn that and learn the other. You
[1:05:44] don't you don't have to be able to
[1:05:45] recite every Bible in order. Look, not
[1:05:48] even I can do that. Did you hear that? I
[1:05:51] mean, I can't recite all the I've got a
[1:05:53] terrible memory. I've got to write
[1:05:54] everything down, which is why I'm old
[1:05:55] fashioned. I'm terrible. Look, if it
[1:05:57] came to to the intellectual stuff, then
[1:06:00] you're all winners and I'm the loser.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; But it's not that. It's just a life. I
[1:06:04] can't help liking Chinese food. That's
[1:06:05] it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's it. It's just there. That's it.
[1:06:08] And sister Joyce loves it too cuz I can
[1:06:09] see her giggling. She's saying amen.
[1:06:11] Preach it, brother. See what I mean?
[1:06:12] What can we do? We can't help it. So by
[1:06:15] manif, it's that simple.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Him in you. Simple. He's manifest. And
[1:06:21] listen, the key is in surrender. Like
[1:06:23] brother says, what I surrendered myself.
[1:06:25] It I was only the one that was there
[1:06:27] when he does it. I was only the voice
[1:06:28] that he used. It's just what I
[1:06:31] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:06:33] through. You know, um, Stephen
[1:06:36] surrendered himself to the Lord.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord spoke through him. Laid it all
[1:06:40] out.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Laid it all out. Peter on the day of
[1:06:43] Pentecost stood up, couldn't spell his
[1:06:45] name, and yet he can recite all the
[1:06:46] scrolls.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; How's that work? Cuz it wasn't him. It
[1:06:49] was just the intelligence that was in
[1:06:51] him speaking through because he
[1:06:53] surrendered himself.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord's good. You know, the key
[1:06:59] is in uh surrender. This is Don't worry,
[1:07:03] brother John. Brother John's glass. You
[1:07:06] know, if you want to put more of God in
[1:07:08] your glass, empty out the bit that's
[1:07:10] you.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; It makes more room. It's that simple.
[1:07:13] It's so simple. Just s and listen.
[1:07:16] Surrender yourself. Lord, I surren I
[1:07:18] just take it, Lord. That's what we want.
[1:07:20] Empty out. Empty out. Empty out. Let's
[1:07:22] just go to First Thessalonians if we
[1:07:23] can. 1 Thessalonians, please.
[1:07:27] And we're going to read 1 6-10. 1
[1:07:29] Thessalonians 1 6-10,
[1:07:35] the living word made manifest. And ye
[1:07:38] became followers of us and of the Lord,
[1:07:41] having received the word in much
[1:07:43] affliction. You know, you know what it
[1:07:45] says here, you became followers of us.
[1:07:47] If someone comes to you and says,
[1:07:48] listen, you got to start following me.
[1:07:50] Something's wrong. But you see, Paul was
[1:07:55] the living word. So when it says
[1:07:57] following us, they're not following the
[1:07:58] man. They're following the life that's
[1:08:00] in the man. They're following that
[1:08:01] epistle that they're reading there. And
[1:08:03] ye became followers of us and of the
[1:08:04] Lord, having received the word in in
[1:08:06] much affliction uh with joy in the Holy
[1:08:09] Ghost, so that ye were examples to all
[1:08:12] that believe in Macedonian Archa. For ye
[1:08:14] for from you sounded out the word of
[1:08:17] God, not only in Macedonian Archa, but
[1:08:19] also in every place that your faith to
[1:08:21] God, Ward, or that means towards God is
[1:08:24] spread abroad. So that we need not speak
[1:08:27] anything.
[1:08:28] For they themselves show us what manner
[1:08:30] of entering we had unto you. And how
[1:08:32] that ye turn from God from turn to God
[1:08:34] from idols to serve the living and true
[1:08:36] God and to wait for the son from heaven
[1:08:39] for his son from heaven who raised who
[1:08:41] he raised from the dead even Christ
[1:08:43] Jesus which delivered us from the wroth
[1:08:45] to come. Amen. So notice in verse 8 it
[1:08:49] says and for and for from you sounded
[1:08:51] out the word of the Lord not only in my
[1:08:53] ara but also in every place that your
[1:08:55] faith uh toward God is spread abroad so
[1:08:58] that we need not speak anything.
[1:09:02] I find that quite astounding. The word
[1:09:05] was so manifested in the saints of these
[1:09:09] in the lives of these saints that not
[1:09:11] even Paul this is Paul not even Paul had
[1:09:15] to say one single word
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; their life their life as written
[1:09:21] epistles manifesting the word it was
[1:09:23] enough it's it's your faith towards God
[1:09:26] is spread all so that we need not speak
[1:09:28] anything they were living epistles they
[1:09:31] were read of all men they were true
[1:09:34] witness of the word there were the the
[1:09:36] light was being manifested and trust me
[1:09:38] they will have been simple lives simple
[1:09:42] lives. Amen. Let's just try and turn a
[1:09:44] little corner. Let's just go to 2
[1:09:45] Corinthians if we can. 2 Corinthians.
[1:09:49] Let's just turn a little corner. 2
[1:09:51] Corinthians 11 1-3.
[1:09:58] Second. It says, "Would to God that ye
[1:10:01] would bear with me a little in my folly,
[1:10:03] and indeed bear with me, for I am
[1:10:05] jealous over you with a godly jealousy,
[1:10:07] for I have espoused you to one husband
[1:10:09] that I may present into you as a
[1:10:12] chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear,
[1:10:15] lest by any means, as a serpent beguiled
[1:10:17] Eve through his subility, which was
[1:10:20] through knowledge,
[1:10:22] she was beguiled, so your mind should be
[1:10:24] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:10:27] Christ." Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; See, notice how Paul here, he says he
[1:10:32] fears that because it's so simple,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; we might be deceived. Look, we know the
[1:10:38] bride can't be deceived.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; But because it's so simple, it is so
[1:10:43] simple, it will just be looked over the
[1:10:45] top of the scripture. This scripture
[1:10:47] really brings home how simple the word
[1:10:50] of God is. It is true. Even the deepest
[1:10:53] things I find the deepest things when
[1:10:55] because we speak the same language. It's
[1:10:57] not hard to understand.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; We can understand these things and so
[1:11:00] you know other people when you talk to
[1:11:02] other people and and you just kind of
[1:11:03] join the dots which we take for we take
[1:11:05] for granted. You know that the prophet
[1:11:07] brought us the word and and and it's
[1:11:09] expounded since it just keeps it keeps
[1:11:10] expounding and the things we look when's
[1:11:13] the last time you sat down at a
[1:11:14] brother's meeting and discuss serpent
[1:11:15] seed.
[1:11:17] Exactly. You don't. It's just well it's
[1:11:20] like well you know it's it's a
[1:11:22] foundation it's there we don't discuss
[1:11:24] it but when you would speak to somebody
[1:11:26] about just the things which we just kind
[1:11:28] of join the dots you know Joseph the
[1:11:30] type of the Lord Jesus and all the
[1:11:31] things and all these things d join all
[1:11:33] the dots they just sit there with big
[1:11:34] eyes like how do you know all this what
[1:11:37] are you talking about what are you
[1:11:38] talking about for us it's not hard it's
[1:11:40] simple the Lord reveals himself simple
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; you see it's so simple and in verse two
[1:11:48] it's kind of clear For I am jealous over
[1:11:50] you with godly jealousy for I have
[1:11:52] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:11:53] present you as a chase virgin to Christ.
[1:11:56] So we can see that we're a spouse to
[1:11:58] Christ. So when I think on this being a
[1:12:02] spouse to Christ, when I think about
[1:12:03] this, you know, the simplicity of the
[1:12:07] simplicity of things, you know, there
[1:12:09] was a there was a wedding last last
[1:12:11] weekend, Simon Emily. There was a
[1:12:14] wedding and and I I I always get kind of
[1:12:16] inspired a little bit with the weddings,
[1:12:17] but the identity of the bride is
[1:12:21] actually found in the bridegroom.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; So when the before the bride gets
[1:12:26] married, she's born with an earthly
[1:12:30] identity. An earthly identity which is
[1:12:33] she's given upon birth. That's it. But
[1:12:35] actually her identity lays in the
[1:12:37] bridegroom. And so in order to fulfill
[1:12:42] her full identity, to manifest all that
[1:12:46] she actually is, she has to go through a
[1:12:49] name change.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; She has to change her name. And so now
[1:12:52] she can manifest what is truly meant for
[1:12:55] her life and actually manifest what's
[1:12:58] the in the bridegroom. And so I thought,
[1:13:01] you know, about a marriage and I thought
[1:13:02] that how every marriage needs a token.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Every marriage needs a token and
[1:13:09] it's a ring. So like you know last last
[1:13:12] weekend it was you know is there a token
[1:13:14] of this and they bring out the old ring.
[1:13:16] So every marriage needs a ring. And when
[1:13:20] I remembered this I remembered the
[1:13:23] photo. How do I do that brother? Did I
[1:13:24] just press on it? Brother Franco's going
[1:13:27] to do it. I remembered this.
[1:13:30] Every marriage needs a ring.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when I when I thought
[1:13:34] about this a high cloud ring of mystery
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; and I thought you know it's almost a
[1:13:41] prophetic statement that's made here in
[1:13:43] this magazine.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord himself comes down as a
[1:13:48] witness
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and he's witnessing something that's
[1:13:51] going to go on. The Lord himself he
[1:13:54] comes down in this ring of mystery
[1:13:57] coming down with a ring. coming down
[1:14:00] with the token.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham says that the
[1:14:04] natural types are spiritual.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, listen, sometimes it's
[1:14:09] just that simple.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's that simple.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go Hebrews 6:13. You can leave
[1:14:15] that up there, brother Franco. It's
[1:14:16] fine. Hebrews uh what did I say? Hebrews
[1:14:19] 6:13.
[1:14:21] Let's go to Hebrews 6:13.
[1:14:31] It says, "For when God made promise to
[1:14:34] Abraham, I like this. When God made
[1:14:37] promise to Abraham, because he could not
[1:14:41] swear by no greater, he swear by
[1:14:44] himself." You know,
[1:14:47] this was so important.
[1:14:50] The covenant with Abraham was so
[1:14:53] important. this the uh unconditional
[1:14:56] covenant that the Lord came down himself
[1:14:59] and swear by himself.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He was the witness himself. It was so
[1:15:04] important that he was a witness. And we
[1:15:07] as the faith seed of Abraham with an
[1:15:09] unconditional covenant of grace, the
[1:15:13] Lord comes down himself.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; A high cloud ring of mystery.
[1:15:20] Now then I read this part of the
[1:15:22] article. Can you click on it, brother
[1:15:23] Franco? That's it. It's a bit fuzzy for
[1:15:26] you guys,
[1:15:27] but I read this. It says, "Hovering like
[1:15:29] a giant smoker in the great cloud
[1:15:30] appeared over sunset, Flagstaff,
[1:15:31] Arizona, 5th, February 28th, and set off
[1:15:34] continuous science mystery. Watches
[1:15:36] struck the odd clouds odd shape, huge
[1:15:38] size, took pictures, mainly these four
[1:15:40] at different times from the widest
[1:15:41] cattle in the states. Dr. James
[1:15:43] McDonald, meteorologist from the
[1:15:44] Institute of Aspherent Physics in
[1:15:46] Tucson, has been accumulating the
[1:15:47] pictures using them as a basis for
[1:15:50] calculation. He said
[1:15:52] he has made a startling discovery that
[1:15:54] the cloud was at least 26 mi high 30 mi
[1:15:57] across a lot higher and bigger he says
[1:16:00] than the cloud should be the circle's
[1:16:01] too high to be made by jet planes so far
[1:16:02] Dr. come ter rockets, rockets, planes,
[1:16:05] bombs, tested by near the you don't need
[1:16:07] to know that. The point is I kind of
[1:16:11] Hey,
[1:16:14] I'm going to try something here. I don't
[1:16:15] know what I'm doing,
[1:16:19] mate.
[1:16:22] You know, my dad's from the 60s. I don't
[1:16:24] know if he used to say, "Eat your heart
[1:16:26] out." That just that just means uh I
[1:16:29] don't know what he used to say that. It
[1:16:31] just means I can do it too, I guess.
[1:16:33] Look at that. That is awesome. Praise
[1:16:35] the Lord. You know, when I read this
[1:16:38] part of the article,
[1:16:41] I thought I thought, you know, even even
[1:16:44] when it was published, it was published
[1:16:46] on the day I think that no no went to
[1:16:48] the ark. Is that right? It was published
[1:16:49] the magazine was p published this this
[1:16:51] uh specific days these things happened.
[1:16:55] Why 26 miles high and 26 miles across?
[1:16:58] Why? And I just thought, well, why 2630?
[1:17:02] And look, I'm I'm just giving a
[1:17:04] disclaimer. It it it's no doubt a
[1:17:06] coincidence. It's probably just Yeah,
[1:17:08] great. But if it's a coincidence, it's a
[1:17:10] beautiful coincidence. Let's turn to
[1:17:12] Exodus 26:30.
[1:17:15] Exodus 26:30.
[1:17:18] Now remember,
[1:17:20] this is now the first Exodus. Yeah.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; This is the first Exodus. This is an
[1:17:26] Exodus of coming out and going in.
[1:17:30] Exodus 26:30
[1:17:34] it says, "And thou shalt rear up the
[1:17:37] tabernacle." Now, Moses has had the full
[1:17:41] um Moses had the full explanation. He's
[1:17:44] going into the he's halfway through the
[1:17:46] full explanation of how everything's got
[1:17:47] to be absolutely in detail. Says, "And
[1:17:50] thou shalt rear up the tabernacle
[1:17:51] according to the fashion thereof which
[1:17:54] was showed thee in the mount."
[1:17:58] Okay. So when I read that I thought
[1:18:00] okay. So this is when the Lord himself
[1:18:03] comes down
[1:18:05] and gives listen the Lord comes down and
[1:18:09] gives the word.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; To Moses
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; the word that's going to make the way
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; for them to be saved
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; for them. Yeah. He's giving the word.
[1:18:20] He's giving them the way of escape. The
[1:18:24] Lord is giving them. The Lord comes down
[1:18:26] himself
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; comes down himself and it happens on the
[1:18:30] mount.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That the word is given on the mount.
[1:18:34] 26:30. It's there. I say if it's got
[1:18:36] it's a nice coincidence.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:18:40] this also on the mount it's given
[1:18:45] the Lord is giving instruction on on how
[1:18:48] the tabernacle
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; is to be built. The tabernacle was going
[1:18:52] to be the dwelling place of God. It was
[1:18:54] going to be the place that God goes
[1:18:56] inside. And the word is given on the
[1:18:59] mount.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; He did it on the mount. Now, the Old
[1:19:04] Testament tabernacle was only temporal.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; It just foreshadowed what was to come.
[1:19:08] It was a temporal covering. So, now we
[1:19:11] jump forward to Matthew 26:30. We've got
[1:19:14] the 26:30 again. Let's look at Matthew
[1:19:16] 26:30.
[1:19:20] Matthew 26:30.
[1:19:27] And when they had sung a hymn, they went
[1:19:31] out into the Mount of Olives.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Here we have the mount.
[1:19:37] Amen. So now this is actually taking
[1:19:41] place right at the end of the Lord's
[1:19:45] earthly ministry. The word has been
[1:19:48] delivered. The word has been delivered.
[1:19:50] And now it's time for the Lord to
[1:19:52] fulfill the scriptures concerning
[1:19:55] himself, concerning all the scriptures
[1:19:57] concerning giving his life for his
[1:19:59] bride. And now he's laying his life down
[1:20:03] just like the types in the Old Testament
[1:20:05] like the doves when the when the when
[1:20:07] the two doves, the pairing mate, and you
[1:20:09] know, uh the the the doves are funny
[1:20:12] little animals. I sent a brother to a
[1:20:14] picture to brother Chad, a little video
[1:20:15] to brother Chad. I don't know if you
[1:20:16] guys saw it. It was just a fun little
[1:20:18] thing that I saw. Um there was there was
[1:20:20] a pigeon and it had died now. They're
[1:20:22] collared doves. So it's like it's a
[1:20:24] proper dove and they got like a little
[1:20:25] black ring around. You can look at it a
[1:20:27] collared dove. And we quite like him.
[1:20:30] Josh doesn't like him cuz they just coo
[1:20:32] at him all day long. For you guys it's
[1:20:34] romantic. For us it's not
[1:20:38] all day long anyway. And I always say
[1:20:40] they're saying Josh Josh.
[1:20:43] But the but the but the funny thing is
[1:20:45] with these doves is they actually mate
[1:20:47] for life,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; right? And it's true.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And we you know in our barn we had uh in
[1:20:52] our shed shed we had
[1:20:55] two two doves that were nesting in there
[1:20:58] and one of them died. Yeah. Well for us
[1:21:01] it's like yeah big deal. But this one
[1:21:04] little dove just sat by its partner
[1:21:08] for I thought oh mate and I sent a video
[1:21:10] after two days I think to brother Chad.
[1:21:12] said, "Look, you know, just just as a
[1:21:14] type, cuz if you haven't seen that, I
[1:21:16] don't know if you guys have I don't
[1:21:17] think you have many doves, do you?" But
[1:21:19] anyway, he just sat there. It sat there
[1:21:21] and sat there and sat there for days and
[1:21:24] days and days and he died.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he died. And you know, there was
[1:21:29] nothing wrong with it.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; But there's these types that you can't
[1:21:33] get away from that are in nature. The
[1:21:35] Lord, this is a partnership for life.
[1:21:38] And the Lord, so these doves, the the
[1:21:40] Lord put it in the Old Testament where
[1:21:42] the one dove gets his neck ripped off
[1:21:45] and the blood gets sprinkled and then
[1:21:46] the one goes free. The male gets killed
[1:21:49] and the and and as a sacrifice and the
[1:21:52] other one can go free. And so now the
[1:21:55] Lord is laying his life down. He's about
[1:21:58] to lay his life down so that we can go
[1:22:00] free.
[1:22:01] The word. He's the word.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He is the word and he's now preparing.
[1:22:06] He's giving the word the way of escape
[1:22:10] for his gentile bride. You know, the
[1:22:13] Lord had to pay for our sin because he
[1:22:15] can only marry a virgin. So, he had to
[1:22:17] pay for our sin. It was the only way.
[1:22:19] And so, now on the mount, what is going
[1:22:22] through the Lord's mind? What is he
[1:22:23] thinking about? It's you and I.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You and I is the main thing on the
[1:22:28] Lord's mind. What's going on here?
[1:22:29] What's going on? It's the first step to
[1:22:32] this union taking place. It's the first
[1:22:35] step between the wedding, the uni union
[1:22:37] of Christ and his bride. But it had to
[1:22:39] be that he had to give his life. So now
[1:22:42] on the mount, we have the same thing. We
[1:22:44] have the word on the mount in the last
[1:22:47] days.
[1:22:49] Again, the Lord himself came down.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; He came down in the form of the cloud.
[1:22:54] The same cloud brother says the cloud
[1:22:56] was in led the children by night and
[1:22:58] cloud and the fire by day. It's the same
[1:23:00] one. So now comes he comes in the form
[1:23:02] of a cloud and he's bringing a message
[1:23:04] again. He's bringing a message again.
[1:23:07] He's coming to unite himself with his
[1:23:09] bride. And we know that when brother
[1:23:12] where brother Brandon was when he the
[1:23:14] seven angels appeared when the cloud
[1:23:16] appeared he was on the mount. He was on
[1:23:18] a hill and you know and the cloud hung
[1:23:20] over cl flag flagstaff. Now I've never
[1:23:23] I've never seen flag staff. I think you
[1:23:26] guys have maybe seen because you got in
[1:23:27] Arizona, but I've never seen a picture
[1:23:30] of Arizona where the cloud kind of hung.
[1:23:32] Brother Franco,
[1:23:34] this is this is Flagstaff.
[1:23:37] So the cloud is it's down in the valley
[1:23:39] and on the top is the mountains. So
[1:23:42] again, we see this ring that's hovering
[1:23:46] and again coincidence. It's beautiful
[1:23:47] for me. I enjoy it.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord it's it's this it's this it's
[1:23:51] this ring this testimony. It's this it's
[1:23:54] it it's hanging over a mountain. Again,
[1:23:59] there at the Mount of Olives, the Lord
[1:24:00] was preparing a way for us to be united
[1:24:03] with him. He was preparing the way of
[1:24:05] life for us. He was preparing the way.
[1:24:08] And on the mount when the Lord brought
[1:24:09] the word of God to the prophet, he was
[1:24:12] preparing a way that we could live.
[1:24:14] Look, I without the look, it doesn't
[1:24:17] matter. Bride, no bride through all. If
[1:24:19] you if the the restored word didn't come
[1:24:21] back, there's no way of of of us.
[1:24:23] There's no way. The only way for us to
[1:24:25] live was to have the restored word back.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And the Lord chose a mount to do it. He
[1:24:30] chose a mount to show himself. And now
[1:24:32] he there's the ring there. This this
[1:24:34] ring of mystery is there as a testimony.
[1:24:37] He comes down personally. And Moses, he
[1:24:39] came down personally onto the mount.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus, it was him personally on
[1:24:43] the Mount of Olives. And now he comes
[1:24:44] down personally once again in the form
[1:24:47] of the the cloud in the form of those uh
[1:24:50] within those seven angels. He comes down
[1:24:51] himself. He's preparing a way for his
[1:24:53] bride to be united and she'll be a
[1:24:56] wordclothed bride.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; So notice the tabernacle in the Old
[1:25:00] Testament. It was only temporal.
[1:25:03] It was never God's intention to live in
[1:25:06] a tent forever.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; That was that it was never it was never
[1:25:09] it was that wasn't the plan of God. that
[1:25:10] God's end plan was to dwell in the human
[1:25:14] heart. The tabernacle of God is with
[1:25:16] men. You know, manifesting yourself, the
[1:25:19] living word, the Lord wants to manifest
[1:25:21] himself through a living bride, a many
[1:25:24] membered body. And for him to manifest,
[1:25:26] that's like we said, it's his life. It's
[1:25:28] his life. So, I like Chinese and brother
[1:25:31] Chuck likes his taking chips. That's
[1:25:32] just the life, our life being
[1:25:34] manifested. We don't have to do
[1:25:36] anything. I think says a sheep just bear
[1:25:38] bears wool. That's all there is to it.
[1:25:40] He doesn't have to think about it. It
[1:25:42] just it just grows the old wool and
[1:25:43] that's it. Brother says, "Why are we
[1:25:45] toss was so tossed about in 56 he says
[1:25:49] the heart is the abode of God." And in
[1:25:51] the Old Testament, God dwelt in his
[1:25:54] glory over the ark. The heart and the
[1:25:56] heart is the ark. God dwells in the
[1:25:59] head. Sorry, God dwells not in the head,
[1:26:01] in the heart. God is not known by
[1:26:03] theology. God is not known by a mental
[1:26:05] conception. God is known by an
[1:26:07] old-fashioned, sanctified, born-again
[1:26:09] experience that's in the human heart.
[1:26:11] Yet, men and women live a good life and
[1:26:14] love God by mental conception. But the
[1:26:16] real hiding place is in the heart, hid
[1:26:18] with Christ. And when Christ, the Holy
[1:26:21] Spirit comes into your heart. He is in
[1:26:24] you with your temperament. So, this is
[1:26:26] what we're saying. It's just, it's like
[1:26:28] I like Chinese. I'm bride. Brother Chuck
[1:26:30] likes saying chips. He's bride. And
[1:26:32] somebody else likes donuts or whatever
[1:26:34] it is. It's like you can't help it. He
[1:26:36] just we're all bride. He's living in
[1:26:38] you. But we all have the same spiritual
[1:26:41] understand the spirit the love for the
[1:26:43] Lord. We've got that same life within us
[1:26:45] with your temperament. So whatever you
[1:26:47] are in the flesh, you don't all have to
[1:26:49] start eating Chinese. You just we just
[1:26:51] have and this just explaining it simply.
[1:26:54] It's the life in us. Whatever you are,
[1:26:56] just be who you are because he is living
[1:26:59] in you. He says he is in you with your
[1:27:02] temperament and he's living his own life
[1:27:05] to his own will through you. Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] I know that sounds awful, but it's
[1:27:09] right. Christ so yielded you are that
[1:27:12] Christ speaks the kind of words that he
[1:27:15] would speak.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; See, this is where we're getting to.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he said
[1:27:21] it.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; See, this is speaking about you now. He
[1:27:24] says, I know that sounds awful, but it's
[1:27:26] right. Christ so so yielded you are that
[1:27:30] Christ speaks the kind of words he would
[1:27:32] speak he thinks the kind of thoughts
[1:27:34] that he would think through you
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; he does the kind of works he would do
[1:27:40] through you are yielded and resting what
[1:27:43] a beautiful picture of a consecrated
[1:27:44] Christian yielded Christ working through
[1:27:47] Paul said to me to live for me to live
[1:27:50] is Christ to die is gain not me that
[1:27:52] liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in
[1:27:54] me Christ Living in the individual so
[1:27:58] surrendered Christ speaks through the
[1:28:00] lips, thinks through the mind, sees
[1:28:02] through the eyes, acts through the
[1:28:04] temperaments. Hallelujah. Then the
[1:28:07] things of the world has passed away. How
[1:28:08] can it be anything but sweet and
[1:28:10] pleasant all the time? Christ has got
[1:28:12] control. Amen. You see it. You see what
[1:28:13] it is. It's Christ in you. It's Christ
[1:28:16] in you. Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; As the scripture says in 1 Corinthians,
[1:28:22] let's go 1 Corinthians 6:19. It's just
[1:28:25] one verse.
[1:28:27] It says, "What know ye not that your
[1:28:29] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:31] which is in you, which ye have of God,
[1:28:34] and ye are not of your own." You see the
[1:28:37] Lord, ye are the temple of the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost. The temple is dwelling place of
[1:28:42] God. You are the dwelling place of God.
[1:28:45] He is living in you. He's manifesting
[1:28:48] himself through his bride. He's manel
[1:28:50] manifesting himself through you. And
[1:28:52] Christ and his bride, they are united in
[1:28:54] one. When he is speaking, we all you
[1:28:56] see, we're getting this picture that
[1:28:57] when he wants to say something, he's
[1:28:59] going to use you to do it because you've
[1:29:00] surrendered yourself. You see, now this
[1:29:03] is this is the thing. Just empty
[1:29:04] yourself out and then it'll all be God.
[1:29:06] Empty it out. Empty out the bit of you.
[1:29:09] And whatever comes now, whatever comes
[1:29:11] out of there has to be God.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; It has to be because there ain't none of
[1:29:15] you in there.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And listen, this is somewhere that I'm
[1:29:17] working on getting to.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we're all in the same boat,
[1:29:20] but we've all got that same desire. It's
[1:29:22] what we want.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Him in us. Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, the bride can only manifest
[1:29:28] himself him. The bride can only manifest
[1:29:31] him fully
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; when she takes his name.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Just like the bride, her identity is in
[1:29:37] the bridegroom.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in ourselves. It's
[1:29:41] in him.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; So for us to manifest him fully,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; we have to take his name. And with a
[1:29:50] marriage comes a name change.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; With a marriage comes a name change.
[1:29:54] Notice at the opening of the seals,
[1:29:58] right?
[1:30:00] This is now when the way was made for us
[1:30:04] to go to have that that union with
[1:30:06] Christ. When the way was made, there
[1:30:09] came a name change.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; You see, there came and with the name
[1:30:12] change comes a new identity. Remember
[1:30:15] the identity of the bride is laying in
[1:30:17] the bridegroom. And brother says in the
[1:30:18] first seal, we know this very well. Um
[1:30:21] it says he wouldn't he he said it would
[1:30:23] be known in the last day but it comes
[1:30:25] forth in a church symbol. Do you
[1:30:27] understand it church? So he's addressing
[1:30:30] the we know this but brother's
[1:30:32] addressing the church as church. Do you
[1:30:34] understand it church? Congregation says
[1:30:36] oh amen. It comes forth in a symbol of a
[1:30:38] church and they know there is a seal but
[1:30:41] just what it is yet they don't know
[1:30:42] because it's a white horse rider. This
[1:30:44] is the first seal remember. So, it's
[1:30:46] right at the beginning, right at the
[1:30:48] beginning of the of the opening of the
[1:30:49] seals and and the only the o and only to
[1:30:52] be revealed at this last day when this
[1:30:54] actual seal is broken. Broken to who?
[1:30:56] Not to Christ, but to the church.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Notice, oh, how that makes me tremble.
[1:31:02] Oh, I hope that the church truly
[1:31:04] understands it. What I mean, you people.
[1:31:06] So, brother Brown's like he's gone from
[1:31:08] calling people church and he's like, and
[1:31:10] they're all sitting there. Oh, yes, yes,
[1:31:12] yes. And then he says, you people. Yeah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He's talking about me. Yeah. And then he
[1:31:19] says, "I'm going to call you bridey
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; that you'll understand it." See, he's
[1:31:24] going, "Oh, do you understand it,
[1:31:26] church?" Oh, amen. He knows they don't
[1:31:28] understand it. He's calling him church.
[1:31:29] Listen carefully.
[1:31:31] The word church
[1:31:34] has no identity.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Call somebody church,"
[1:31:39] there's no identity found in the word
[1:31:41] church.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; You could be anything,
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah, there's no identity in the
[1:31:45] word church.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Bride means that you're a spouse to
[1:31:48] somebody.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; One person, one person.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You see, so here he's calling them
[1:31:53] church, church, church. But in order
[1:31:56] that they actually understand what's
[1:31:58] going on, you know, and this is this is
[1:32:00] this is the um nice coincidence. You
[1:32:03] know the the Lord has come with this
[1:32:05] message and this is the beginning of the
[1:32:06] message and it starts with so that they
[1:32:08] understand what's going on because I've
[1:32:11] had the ring of mystery and the Lord's
[1:32:13] come down to unite himself and so that
[1:32:16] he kind of get what's going on that the
[1:32:18] Lord's come down. He's brought his word
[1:32:21] that we're going to be united and
[1:32:23] there's the ring of mystery and and it's
[1:32:26] and it's on the mount and it's on the
[1:32:27] mount and it's all but so that you
[1:32:29] understand I'm going to say I'm going to
[1:32:31] call you bride. Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; So that you'll understand it. See, and
[1:32:35] they're probably still sat there like,
[1:32:36] "What are you talking?" But it just so
[1:32:38] we understand it.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Now we see what's going on because
[1:32:42] there's no identity found in the word
[1:32:45] church. Identity is found in the
[1:32:47] bridegroom.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; So when we when we are espoused to
[1:32:51] somebody,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; the Lord the word the word has been
[1:32:59] restored to us. Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord's given us the Isal. He's given
[1:33:03] us the revelation. Remember,
[1:33:04] revelation's only given of the Lord. And
[1:33:06] we've recognized our day and its
[1:33:09] message. We've recognized it. We've
[1:33:11] become that message. And now we are
[1:33:14] being read of all men, the very thing
[1:33:16] that was preministered.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; We've accepted the word, become one with
[1:33:19] the word. The marriage has taken place.
[1:33:22] The bride has made herself ready.
[1:33:25] You know, as we come to a close gently,
[1:33:29] the ring
[1:33:32] that's such a mystery to the world, the
[1:33:36] ring that's such a mystery to the world
[1:33:38] is the bride knows what it means.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; We know what it means.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; For the bride, it's our identification.
[1:33:45] Our identification's come.
[1:33:48] We are, you are the virgin bride of the
[1:33:52] Lord Jesus Christ. We've been washed by
[1:33:54] the word. We've been cleansed. We've
[1:33:56] been brought to that position. We've
[1:33:57] been given the word. We've been we've
[1:33:59] been we've been he's put the the you
[1:34:01] know the Lord, this is why it's so we
[1:34:04] have to walk in his ways. It's half of
[1:34:07] it's about being that written epistle.
[1:34:09] But what about you? We want to please
[1:34:11] the Lord. Remember Esther when she uh
[1:34:13] came before the king, she put on the
[1:34:15] clothes that he gave her.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; The Lord's come down and he's clothed us
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; and he wants to see us. If we want to be
[1:34:21] acceptable, if we want to be pleasing to
[1:34:23] the Lord,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; then we need to actually dress ourselves
[1:34:26] in the very thing that he gave us.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not really I've got to be honest
[1:34:31] with you, I'm not really into
[1:34:34] buying dresses for my wife. I'm so
[1:34:37] I'm I you know, I'm just not good at
[1:34:39] that sort of thing. Just give her some
[1:34:41] money, you go buy it, this that and the
[1:34:42] but if you if I would buy something for
[1:34:44] her, in fact, you know, I say, you know,
[1:34:46] you go buy yourself something nice. when
[1:34:48] she wears it, it's the thing that I've
[1:34:50] bought for her.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; So, she knows that she, you know, I'm
[1:34:53] pleased when because it's the thing that
[1:34:54] I've given her.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And so, the Lord's
[1:34:57] the same. The Lord is the same. The Lord
[1:34:58] loves us. And we know that the Lord's
[1:35:00] given us. Why wouldn't we want to just
[1:35:02] dress the way that he wants us to dress?
[1:35:04] Why we want to clothe ourselves in that
[1:35:06] the thing that he's given us.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we are being changed as
[1:35:10] brother John s that song. You know,
[1:35:11] little by little, he's changing us and
[1:35:13] we're being changed into his image.
[1:35:17] Ram says in 64 and it's our last quote
[1:35:19] here. He says now now is the Holy Spirit
[1:35:22] that we talk about. It's that Jesus
[1:35:24] Christ. Sure it is. See he is God known
[1:35:27] as God. The Holy Ghost. It ain't another
[1:35:29] God. It's the same God. Father, Son,
[1:35:32] Holy Ghost. It's not three gods. It's
[1:35:34] three attributes of the same God. See
[1:35:36] just the se the same God in three forms.
[1:35:39] You see in other words, in otherwise uh
[1:35:42] three offices like you know when he
[1:35:44] served as father then as a son god could
[1:35:45] sending coming from one who cannot be
[1:35:48] touched even to touch the mountain he
[1:35:49] had to die till we would come and handle
[1:35:51] him in flesh and now he's in you. He
[1:35:55] sanctified you with his blood that he
[1:35:57] might live in you at that day you'll
[1:35:59] know I'm in the father the father in me.
[1:36:02] I in you and you in me. See it's God
[1:36:04] above us. It's God with us. It's God in
[1:36:06] us. See and that's Christ tonight. The
[1:36:08] Holy Spirit. He is the same and you are.
[1:36:11] He's the vine. You're the branches. Have
[1:36:13] faith in him if he will identify himself
[1:36:16] tonight being among us. You know, I'm
[1:36:19] sure
[1:36:21] when he identifies himself in brother
[1:36:23] Ram services, you know, you have the
[1:36:25] prayer immediately. Oh yeah, prayer
[1:36:26] line's coming. Pray. Listen. But what
[1:36:27] about tonight?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; If the Lord's identifying himself
[1:36:31] tonight,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; where can he be found?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; We don't need to have a prayer line. We
[1:36:35] don't need to have a discernment to know
[1:36:36] that Lord's here. We look at our brother
[1:36:38] and sister. He's identifying himself in
[1:36:40] you. You are the word made manifest.
[1:36:43] Living epistles. Living epistles. You
[1:36:46] know, we are so fully surrendered to the
[1:36:47] Lord that it's the Lord. It's him in us.
[1:36:50] It's him speaking through you. It's him
[1:36:52] living through you. And when it's him
[1:36:54] walking in you, talking in you, then we
[1:36:57] can stand there and we can say, "I was
[1:36:59] only there when he did it." True story.
[1:37:02] If he is living through us, if there's
[1:37:04] if I can't help the way that I act and
[1:37:06] it just comes out the Lord, the Lord,
[1:37:08] the Lord, then actually I wasn't the one
[1:37:10] who did it.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's the level we need to get to. And
[1:37:13] stop thinking about discernments.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; That wasn't even important anyway,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The discernments was there to point us
[1:37:21] towards the real thing, which was the
[1:37:22] word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; It's the it's giving of himself.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord's good. Amen.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:30] We stand reflecting him.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; We are standing now. We've been given
[1:37:37] the clothes. We're wearing those
[1:37:39] clothes. We can say truly we're only
[1:37:42] standing there when he does it.
[1:37:44] Sometimes, you know, you know, when when
[1:37:47] you go to a brother or a sister and
[1:37:48] they're in need, you don't even know it.
[1:37:50] So, you go to visit somebody, you just
[1:37:51] feel in your heart, I'm going to go and
[1:37:52] visit that bro. I'm going to visit that
[1:37:53] sis. It's like you go there, you talk to
[1:37:55] them, and afterwards they're like, you
[1:37:57] know, you wouldn't believe that really
[1:37:59] touched my heart. That's exactly what I
[1:38:00] need. You're like, well, did you know
[1:38:02] what you were doing? No. So, no. And
[1:38:04] it's happened to each one of us. True.
[1:38:05] True. Happened to everyone, right? Okay.
[1:38:07] So, can you take credit for that?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; No. No. And how listen, how many people
[1:38:12] I Well, you see, I I dreamed a dream
[1:38:15] like
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; No. No. Truly. So, if you go somewhere,
[1:38:19] you talk to them
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and how many times does it happen? Oh,
[1:38:23] do you know that really that's exactly
[1:38:24] what I needed? How did you know? Oh,
[1:38:26] brother Chad's preaching. It's like,
[1:38:27] mate, that's exactly what I'm going
[1:38:29] through. That's answered my questions.
[1:38:31] Can he take any credit for that?
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; No. No. What is it? It's the the Lord
[1:38:38] manifesting himself through your room is
[1:38:40] standing there. You see, this is the
[1:38:42] thing now. What we need to realize,
[1:38:43] guys. You know, it's not hard for us to
[1:38:46] believe the prophet, he's part of the
[1:38:49] bride. He's the, you know, that's not
[1:38:51] hard for us to believe. What's hard for
[1:38:52] us to believe is that we're part of that
[1:38:54] same category,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; He was only standing there when the Lord
[1:38:59] worked through him. And it might be a
[1:39:01] little bit lesser in our eyes. It might
[1:39:03] be a little bit more simple
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; in our eyes because we don't have all
[1:39:09] the gifts. And but when the Lord uses
[1:39:11] you, it's the same thing.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; It's him working through you. Listen, be
[1:39:16] encouraged. Be encouraged because I know
[1:39:18] each and every one of you has happened.
[1:39:20] You've gone to see somebody. You've
[1:39:21] spoken to somebody. You maybe sent a
[1:39:22] text. You sent some you some way of
[1:39:25] reaching out to somebody and they've
[1:39:26] written about that's just what I needed.
[1:39:28] You were only sending there when you
[1:39:29] flicked the text.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; When he did it,
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; you were only standing there. He was
[1:39:35] working through you.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the Lord gets full
[1:39:38] preeminence in his bride, it will be
[1:39:40] literally listen carefully. When the
[1:39:42] Lord gets full preeminence in his bride,
[1:39:45] it will be the same as when the Lord
[1:39:47] stood there and said,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; "Speak the word."
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; You see me, you see the father.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus stood there and said,
[1:39:55] "You see me, you see the father." What's
[1:39:57] he saying? You see, you see the same
[1:39:58] thing. So now actually when the bride
[1:40:00] has full preeminence and you are the
[1:40:01] written epistle, then basically when
[1:40:04] people see me, they see this.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; So when you see me, you see the word.
[1:40:10] When you see me, you see the father.
[1:40:12] It's the same thing. I at that day, I in
[1:40:15] you, you in me. And it's the word. It's
[1:40:17] exactly right, brother. It's the word
[1:40:18] speaking through you. You can't help it.
[1:40:20] It just comes out.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see me, you see Listen.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the word that
[1:40:27] was preached in the seventh church age.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; You see the word that the prophet
[1:40:32] preached. When you see me,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; we are no longer a church. Yeah,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; brother. Brother Bill brother John, we
[1:40:41] are no longer a church.
[1:40:44] Musician, sorry.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Not used to that one. We are no longer a
[1:40:51] church. A church does not have an
[1:40:54] identity.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Bride means that you have an identity.
[1:40:59] Bride means actually if you're a bride,
[1:41:02] it means that someone's chosen you.
[1:41:04] Right?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; It means that you belong to somebody.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are written epistles.
[1:41:12] We are true witnesses. We are not that
[1:41:16] light, but we are reflecting that light.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; We are witnesses of that light. We are
[1:41:21] the living word manifested for this day.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; In those days, the saints were what Paul
[1:41:27] preached. They were the living epistles
[1:41:29] of what Paul preached. In this day, we
[1:41:31] are the living epistles of what the
[1:41:33] prophets preached. Let's just stand
[1:41:34] together and pray.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help us. We pray, Lord, so
[1:41:41] everywhere with thoughts, Lord Jesus.
[1:41:43] But we just pray, Lord, that something's
[1:41:44] just anchored, Lord. We're just
[1:41:45] thankful, Lord, that Lord, you do things
[1:41:48] in a certain way. You hide yourself. You
[1:41:49] reveal yourself in simplicity, Lord
[1:41:51] Jesus. We're just so thankful, Lord. We
[1:41:52] are so simple and sometimes we we we
[1:41:55] have complexes because we're too simple,
[1:41:57] Lord. Lord Jesus, you're in the symbol.
[1:41:59] Lord Jesus, I can use an example about
[1:42:01] you drinking a glass of water or having
[1:42:03] Chinese. Lord, the prophet stood there
[1:42:06] and said about children chewing bicycle
[1:42:09] tires off or pedals. And Lord, it's
[1:42:11] simplicity. It's always simplicity.
[1:42:13] Lord, you reveal the deepest things in
[1:42:15] simplicity. And Lord, we all get
[1:42:17] complexes about simple. Help us, Lord,
[1:42:18] to humble ourselves down to just
[1:42:20] simplify, to make ourselves humble,
[1:42:22] Lord, to simple be simple and to accept
[1:42:26] the way that you've made us. You've made
[1:42:27] us this way, Lord. We're not stupid. We
[1:42:30] are not um we're not ignorant, Lord
[1:42:33] Jesus. You've shown us the way, Lord. We
[1:42:35] are so thankful, Lord. Help us, Lord. We
[1:42:37] pray. Bless each and every heart, Lord
[1:42:38] Jesus. Bless brother Chad as he's
[1:42:39] traveling. Just restore strength to him
[1:42:41] and just encourage him. We pray, Lord.
[1:42:44] Encourage each and everyone, Lord. Help
[1:42:45] us, Lord Jesus, to identify with the
[1:42:47] position that you've called us to. You
[1:42:49] have made us living representatives of
[1:42:51] you, Lord. Help us, Lord, to live up to
[1:42:53] that, Lord Jesus. We're thankful, Lord
[1:42:55] Jesus, for the identity that you've
[1:42:56] given to us, Lord. You've shown us who
[1:42:58] we are, where we are. Lord Jesus, we are
[1:43:00] so thankful. We bless your name. We love
[1:43:02] you, Lord Jesus. And we just commit the
[1:43:03] rest of the service to you, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:04] Bless us now as we go. Love you, Lord.
[1:43:06] Amen.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. God bless
[1:43:10] you.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I'm resting on the finished work of
[1:43:17] Jesus Christ today.
[1:43:21] All circumstances
[1:43:23] will be gone. And the word of God will
[1:43:27] still remain. No sickness fear. No sill
[1:43:33] can have control and worry me. The keys
[1:43:38] of faith are in my hand. And I am bound
[1:43:43] for victory.
[1:43:47] Oh, I am free.
[1:43:50] My day has come.
[1:43:56] I can be who I truly am.
[1:44:03] Oh, I am free.
[1:44:06] Covered by his blood.
[1:44:11] All things
[1:44:14] are possible with God.
[1:44:19] All things
[1:44:22] are possible with God
[1:44:27] and a great commission from my Lord. I
[1:44:33] have now received
[1:44:36] the prince of power of the air.
[1:44:41] Never have a part in me.
[1:44:45] amateur creator. I change the atmosphere
[1:44:51] around
[1:44:53] the chains of circumstance
[1:44:57] for any spirit to be found.
[1:45:02] Oh, I am free.
[1:45:05] Mighty day has come
[1:45:10] and now I can be who I truly am.
[1:45:18] For I am free,
[1:45:21] governed by his love.
[1:45:26] All things
[1:45:29] are possible
[1:45:31] with God.
[1:45:34] All things
[1:45:37] are possible with God.
[1:45:42] And I know that Jesus the I am is the
[1:45:48] same today.
[1:45:51] The prophet came to show the light. The
[1:45:56] bride must have it on display. The hour
[1:46:00] has come. Christ in us to be completely
[1:46:06] glorified.
[1:46:08] I want the spirit to be free to do the
[1:46:13] gater works in me.
[1:46:17] And I am free.
[1:46:20] Mighty day has come.
[1:46:25] And now I can be who I truly am.
[1:46:32] Oh, I am free.
[1:46:36] Covered by his love.
[1:46:41] All things
[1:46:44] are possible with God.
[1:46:48] All things
[1:46:51] are possible with God.
