I want to continue on with the thought light and darkness this would be part two and then I'm going to just recap just something from the tail end of Sunday service and then going to a different direction so I just pray bear with me in that also want to remind you that Brother Kyle will be traveling down to Junction City Ohio this Sunday to minister for that ex-amish group of new Believers and they're fresh and they're hungry for the word and so I know Brother Kyle would love to be God's tool Amen in the hand of God so just pray for him and also want to say that this past Sunday the youth group went up to literal Life church and they sang a special up there at the Tri-State youth meeting and I want to say you guys did a wonderful job that was a beautiful song and say God bless you for that and hopefully it's out on the internet somewhere where everybody else can hear it I don't know I'm not good at those things but it was a blessing it blessed me so thank you and God bless you amen let's read Exodus 20. Verse 18 together Exodus 20 verse 18. and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God has come to prove you and that his fear may not may be before your faces that you sin not and the people stood afar off and Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness where God was amen God bless you as you take your seats we talked to if we want to bring up the PowerPoint brother Franco we talked uh last Sunday when we were preaching about the light and darkness and how amen God dwells in the thick Darkness Solomon said so that God dwells said he would dwell in the thick darkness and here on Mount Sinai God came down and when God comes down amen we we would imagine God coming down Amen to speak to his people that that should be something nice something pleasant something easy but when God came down to speak directly to his people it was terrifying amen there was thunderings and there was Lightnings and there was a furnace of fire and smoke and billowing smoke and a cloud and the Earth Shook and trembled and the people were terrified and what was it it was God coming down God was coming down Amen to prove them but they ran from the presence of God and moved afar off from the mountain when they were supposed to come up to him they moved away from him amen and so they commissioned Moses to go and Moses went into the thick Darkness where God was amen so we talked about that and then we talked about how uh the seeds that were down under the darkness shrouded in darkness of the earth and job said that God made Darkness a swaddling ban for the Earth but under the darkness were seeds that were dermatized with life in them they had light amen and when the condition was right and the light came to the seeds amen they sprung forth the life and brother Branham and the four seal typed that with you and I now we come into the Earth shroud and in darkness our mind is clouded amen and enmity with God is what the Bible says and we're strapped and we're swaddled in this hybridization of flesh but down on the inside amen there's a seed of life amen with light inside waiting to come in contact with the light for the season to bring it to life and it Springs forward amen and so then we begin to understand about ourselves amen and we ended with this and I want to just take a a quick second and hit a few slides on this and I want to move into the direction for tonight Amen brother Branham says in what is the attraction on the mountain what is the light up on Sunset mountain in the Coronado Forest of Arizona what is this strange thing that happened up there that the people has been driving east from West picking up rocks that laid around with their where it struck and every one of them every Rock has three corners on it that tore off the three are one they're laying on desks on paperweights across Nation what is the strange thing upon sunset Mountain and the Coronado Forest I think it's interesting brother Ben said what is this light up on Sunset Mountain and he shows the Pyramid of cloud amen and and then later on when brother benham's there and and the and the Whirlwind comes down and blasts the rocks out of the mountain all the Rocks were three cornered rocks in a pyramid shape and here we have a a pyramid-shaped cloud and and it's all showing the same thing the three are one that God has come Amen to unite with his people amen and brother Benham calls it a light what is this light amen and some call to the cloud brother Branham calls it a light praise God and he goes on to say that shall never die it's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us and now exactly on Sunset mountain and the sunset light the evening light has come God vindicating himself he said in God's power to transform that's the day we're living in right now the light will shine just at the evening when the darkness is setting in Twilight time the evening star so now this is the black and white version of the picture and you know brother Brown was told turn it right you know he turn it to the right and there he sees amen it's the face of Christ amen and it's shrouded and wigged in the angel's wings and and and and he turns it brother M himself amen has to turn it right to see and he says that's our Lord up there in the scripture in second Corinthians 4 6 says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God and the face of Jesus Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen and then I want to go back to the scripture we read at the beginning of Sunday and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians in the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these on one side it was a cloud and darkness on the other it was light to these I want to be on the light side amen so there you know we live in the day where there's been arguments and debates over the cloud and whatever and to some it's a cloud to me it's the light of the hour to some it brought confusion to some about questions and they're trying to discern the cloud and what materials are made out of and what how high is it and was it this material that material and for me it doesn't matter the material amen that's my Lord up there it's the light coming back Amen to the earth and the time of darkness when darkness is setting in amen the evening light has come so for me I I don't want to be on the dark side of analyzing a cloud I want to see the light amen that cloud brought light to you and I amen so it just goes to show for one for one the same event the same scripture the same circumstances can be Darkness for another it can be light and that's the way it is in our life sometimes as Christians the same event for one can be Darkness for another it can be light and so that's what I I want to make a turn now and that that was just the wrap up from Sunday I want to take the same title different subject I don't know why let's just let's just go with it amen light in the darkness but I want to look at light in the darkness from another angle in another way amen but it's the same title amen but when I was meditating on this God brought the inspiration for Sunday but on top of it he brought the inspiration for tonight amen so I can use the same title for both and this is the scripture there's a scripture and a quote that I want to put together in Psalms 1 12 4 he says unto the upright there arise of the light in the Darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous so unto the upright there ariseth light in the Darkness amen and by God's grace he has called us his upright he's called us to be the upright in this age and he has set us upright by his grace by his word amen and into the upright there arises of light and darkness so that means if you're one of God's chosen following after God Amen God will cause to arise light in the darkness so whatever Darkness you face amen If You by Grace have been positioned to be one of the upright ones in this end time then God will rise light out of the darkness amen every Darkness we face every dark circumstance we come in contact with we have to understand who we are amen and God is not allowed a darkness in my life maybe a dark set of circumstances maybe a dark trial but that darkness is not to destroy me or swallow me up or engulf me amen but God will arise a light in that Darkness and everything I faced I Believe by where God has positioned Me by Grace amen we realize none of us have put ourselves in any position we can't put ourselves in any position amen neither can an oak tree become a palm tree or a palm tree become a maple tree amen you you are what you are amen by the seed that you're born in born with so an oak tree can't take pride in being an oak tree and and a and a palm can't take pride in being a palm amen but an oak tree amen also should not be living in denial that it's an oak tree amen do you see what I'm trying to say Amen we we we we don't want to uh we don't want to allow God's grace in our lives to bring a sense of Pride amen our entitlement because that's not what it's all about amen it's the grace of God and for us it should make us humble to realize what we would be without Grace without the foreknowledge of God and the predestination we would be as lost in darkness as anybody else's lost in darkness but it's the grace of God that has brought light to us we didn't go and find it we didn't make it appear God did it all and we didn't put ourselves in contact he put it in contact with us amen by his grace so that can bring no Pride but it should bring a recognition of who I am amen because God has planted a seed inside of me and brought a light along to to Quicken this seed in me and now there's another life living inside of me the original life what God intended for me from the beginning but not now it doesn't do me any good I'm never going to get anywhere in life amen if I don't surrender to the life that's in me amen and surrender to the position that he positioned me in so if God calls me bride then I want to believe I'm bride because in getting in line with the Revelation I'll begin to produce Pride fruits not living in denial all the time how could I be and maybe I'm not my last mistake and all of this and constantly living in a state of Doubt amen I'm not going to get anywhere until I come in alignment with the predestinated plan for God and I accept what God said about me amen always in the Bible it was critical that the people that God called accepted their calling recognized who they were amen and so it's I think the same thing holds true for you and I that we need to accept God's calling and accept who we are because the upright there arises light in the Darkness so now we don't have to be afraid of the darkness we live in the darkest time we live in Satan's Eden we live in a blackout of the church systems that laodicea has gone into total darkness when the when the when the lunar eclipse was shown Amen to uh on the newspapers there brother pointed to it the beginning of 1964. Amen it showed six but didn't show the seventh amen because it was totally blacked out there was no picture to take showing that laodicea had gone into complete apostasy so in the religious world it's total blackness political world total Blackness Financial World total Blackness amen I don't it's the world has gone into darkness but we don't have to be afraid of the darkness before the upright he'll allow a light to arise in the Darkness amen so the conditions of the world I've said this before but I want to reiterate and these things tonight amen don't wait for the new thing to come there's nothing new coming this is a reminder amen amen the the conditions of the world should not be causing us anxiety the news reports should not be causing us anxiety the political systems the financial systems should not be causing us anxiety amen because there's already prophecy telling us this would go this way so if anything we should be encouraged amen that God is bringing the prophecy to fruition amen because we know when the world goes into a total collapse it's an Escape for the bride right and so we should not we should see that in the darkness of the age God is allowing to the upright a light to arise our world should be getting brighter not darker as the world gets darker our personal life should get brighter our world should get brighter the Revelation should become clearer so then this is the quote that was on my mind and Elijah in the meal offering says in Germany they've got a picture they call it the clown picture it's a it's a competent to this great picture of the crucifixion that forced lawn in Los Angeles the great picture it's as wide as the building is across they have a build a building around the picture many of you have seen him but this in Germany is called the angel or the cloud day I believe it's called and when you get off from the piece from it you get off a piece from it and look at it it looks hideous looks like Angry clouds are mixing around one another like that as the light reflects on him and look like the clouds are moving is the way the picture is made to reflect the lines make it look like the cloud an angry storm coming to tear up everything I want you to catch that it looks like an angry storm coming to tear up everything and then you're told by the guide walk closer and just keep watching it and when you get real close to it it isn't clouds it's angel's wings of beating together rejoicing it's a blessing in disguisement amen so this is where I was drawing inspiration from the light in the darkness and the scripture from Psalms to the upright he'll allow a rise a light in the darkness amen from afar off amen this picture looks terrible it looks like a storm it looks like Angry clouds coming to tear everything up amen but as you got closer and closer to it you realize it's angel's wings beating together it's a blessing and disguisement and and that I believe is the way we should view trials and tribulations and darkness that's trying to encroach Upon Us Their Blessings and disguisement amen that may be hard to swallow that may be hard to believe but I think scripturally we can see that it's true when we look at this picture this is the three Hebrews and the fiery furnace but we don't see three we see four because who's the fourth one the fourth one is the son of God when did they come in contact with the son of God in their prayer meeting no they came in contact with the Son of God in the fiery furnace he manifest himself to them in the furnace amen let's look together at Daniel chapter three let's turn to this together we're going to hit just a couple of these examples Daniel chapter 3. and we'll go to verse 23 Daniel chapter 3 Daniel chapter 3 verse 23. and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astoned and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true O King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt in the form of the fourth is like the son of God amen there was a whole story that transpired and that there was a a religious system coming into play a forced worship I mean we know all of these things and these three Hebrews withstood it they refused to bow at at the the bidding of the king and and the King begins to to tell them that they're going to be bound they're going to be punished and and and the three Hebrew children they they say Amen oh King live forever they're never disrespectful to the authorities that are around them that's important to note but they never compromise on the word oh King live forever amen our God is able to deliver us amen but even if he doesn't they didn't have God in their pocket to where they could control God and say God's going to do this and God's going to do that and God's going to do this they couldn't control God they were depending on God to control the situation but they were trusting in a living God and they said we we know that God is able to deliver us but even if he doesn't we will not bow we cannot go beyond the word amen we cannot compromise on the word we cannot change the word O King live forever we respect you but we're not going to Bow and even if God doesn't Deliver us see they weren't willing to find out what God would do first and base their action upon the reaction of God they were basing their action upon the word of God trusting God they did not know that Christ would manifest himself in the fire all they knew was that I can't do this and they were walking you know they heated it seven times hotter the Wrath of the King was great amen it was so hot that the ones who were carrying them up it slew them we know all these it's terrible but as they're walking up the ramp no manifestation if they're standing before the king no manifestation they didn't know what's going to happen next they're moving into a dark situation into a terrible trial amen but the moment that they're cast down into the very worst of the worst of the worst amen all of a sudden their bands are loosed and Christ is there with them amen because we're the upright he'll cause a light to arise in the Darkness we have all of these examples not so we can tell Sunday School Stories so that we can see ourselves and see what God can do for us amen these are Sunday School Stories these are living realities this wasn't a Sunday School Story to these three Hebrews this was life it wasn't a story that they repeated it wasn't uh some mythical thing this was their life they lived this they didn't talk about it they lived it so that we would know if we are elect like they are elect then God knows when and how to come on the scene he knows where we're at he knows what's going on and we don't have to worry about what's happening we can trust in him we go to this one let's go to Daniel chapter six Daniel chapter 6 verse 21. this is after Daniel had spent the night in the Lion's Den the king comes and asks him if he's all right verse 21 then said Daniel unto the king O King live forever may God my God has sent his Angel and has shut the Lion's mouths that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee O King have I done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God amen Daniel believed in his God that's why there was no hurt on him amen Daniel didn't know what would happen at least there's no indication in the scriptures that Daniel knew what would happen but Daniel knew I can't obey this new law he has to pray to his God Amen in so doing Daniel's going to be executed by lions and then once again this is life to them this is a dark trial and he's going into the dark dungeon of the Lion's Den amen but in that place the angel of the Lord comes in that place the light arises and stops the mouths of the Lions and becomes a tremendous testimony to that King into the whole nation so from this we're learning that we don't have to get anxious about anything amen we say that but we still get anxious that's why we need to know who we are and what God's done for others and what God will do for us in the hour we live in and who we are in God's side amen so that we can we can keep encouraging ourselves in the Lord and stay planted on Solid Ground despite what's going on around us in this in this message brother Ben says here they go through the Wilderness now after the old-fashioned meeting now they're on their Journey isn't it strange that they he was led right straight to the Wilderness of sin right up to the Wilderness right up from to the Fountain of bitter water they come right out of the crossing the Red Sea spoiling Egypt crossing the Red Sea right to the bitter water and this is what brother Brown said could you imagine God taking his children right after they got saved filled with the Holy Ghost to a fountain of bitter water sure he'd like to express his love to them again oh praise God that's right they got up there you know when you get the Holy Ghost you attend a lot of obstacles many are many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivered them out of them all God brings you right up facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness brother Branham does some wonderful things in the word amen to bring us to a higher Revelation and understanding of the life we live in we are not going to live a life free of trial and tribulations God doesn't want us to it meant so much Prosperity preaching another kind of preaching and it makes it makes it sound like God never wants you to suffer any God doesn't want any hardship or any obstacles to come your way that God's a doting grandfather and he wants to remove everything so that you can live a blessed life and everything can be perfect amen but brother Branham come along and told us that's not the reason we're living in this Earth We're living here for education so that we can gain character to Reign by in the next life and the character is a victory not a gift and it comes through hardships through trials through testings so the prophet of God came and he brought reality back to Christianity the churches have taken reality away amen but he's coming brought reality back so that you can live the same kind of Life they lived in the scriptures so then we're not confused when difficult circumstances come up there's no confusion now God why would he bring him out of Egypt Into the Wilderness delivered them from a mighty hand slew the army that was after them brought them into such a wonderful Victory and the next thing he does is he lands them by by a spring of bitter water that they can't even drink another trial why he wants to show them that he loves them some more God why is this happening to me God why why did you let this happen maybe he wants to show you who loves you again or maybe he wants to show you his power and his goodness maybe he allowed the circumstances to get such a way so that he can show you how able he is to deliver amen I like to do a better job of showing him that I trust him he's done an excellent job of showing us he can Deliver Us from everything If We Gather what's in this room today and we start talking about circumstances healings crisis all the things that have happened in our lives we're going to find out very quickly that God is able to deliver from every circumstance every past sin every Temptation every hurt every Affliction every family situation God is able to deliver from everything amen and and I I have seen God able to do Mighty things to show his love for his children and show his power and his goodness but I want to show him back that I trust him amen that's what I want to give to him I want to turn if we can um to mark 4. Mark chapter 4 I'm going to read from verse 35. in the same day when even was come he saith unto them let us pass over into the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke him and send him Master carest thou knot that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him I think God wanted to show his power and his goodness to them do you think Christ didn't know that the storm would come you think he was unaware of what was about to transpire unaware what was going on in the danger they were in amen but when he stood on the the bow of that boat and he said peace be still he was showing what what he was able to do for his children and all of a sudden they were astonished and they say what kind of man is this amen a God man that's what kind of man he is but he's the same Christ that's in our boat he's the same Christ that is in the ship he was in the ship all along the Deliverance was with them all along amen but waited to the condition to get so bad they had no option but calling him on the scene and when they called him on the scene he showed that he was always there and he was always able to calm the storm so why did he let the storm come to begin with if he could stop it why did he let it start maybe he wanted to show his power and his goodness to his children brother man tells the story of the Shepherd that took and broke a sheep's leg do you remember the story and somebody asked him why did you do that and starts telling because this little sheep I wanted to keep it close to me so that I can give a little extra love and attention so that it would know that I love it breaking a sheep's leg to give it extra attention to show it that it's loved would God do a thing like that if we need it he would do it would God do a thing like that I'm telling you a loving God would break you so that he can show his love to you a loving God will break your will will break everything about you a loving God will break he will break every hope every dream every desire he'll break it all so that he can draw you close to him and show you that he loves you I say I thank God that we serve a God Like That that doesn't let me go on in my own dreams go on in my own ways and go on but but anything that draws me away from God God is willing he's willing to break me to pull me back to him to show his love to me I say thank God for that amen brother Ben there's a quote here that I want to read really quick and the message I know says and why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little Arc pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he'd went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation I've liked that poem or Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our Comforts is just beyond the river how many of you know that Christ Is A Healer do you know it because you read it or do you know it because he healed you so God proved his word to you by allowing a sickness to come so that you would know personally him as a savior personally him as a Healer personally him as a redeemer maybe God would allow us to feel unloved so that we could feel his love maybe that God allow us to feel rejection so that we can know what his acceptance is maybe he would allow us to feel lonely so that he could come and be a comforter to us maybe all of these things are good for us maybe they they bring us into a closer fellowship with God that's what the prophet said he goes on to say it wasn't until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they've seen one like the Son of God standing among them their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went into the fire did the comforter appear it was Daniel who had purposed in his heart that he not Define himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he'd pray to God or go to the Lion's Den but it was after the heat was put on and he was thrown into a lion's den that after that he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the midst of him keeping away the great Pillar of Fire standing between him and the lions and the Lions could not get him because he'd went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his God was able to deliver him from then it was Abraham after he'd been after he'd seen the ground get Barren and the drought come and lots separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world it was after he had heard the wines and cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained in the land that God gave him and told him to sojourn in and as on that day after he'd been tried till his patience was at the end it was on that day I love the way the prophet said that when his patience come to an end it was on that day not a day early not a day late but when he came to the end of his patience it was his patience was at the end it was on that day that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with Elohim under the oak that day it was after he'd suffered his trials after he'd went through the troubles that he'd been through that God appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was Sarah and said she laughed at him in the tent behind it was there that Abraham called him Elohim it was after the trial and tribulation oh if the church could only wake to itself today to find that after the troubles and trials and the laughs and made fun of and the things that the church has been through the Pentecostal church that we see God in our midst doing great signs and wonders it was after the scorning after the Laughing after the rejection after all of that we see God I say we shouldn't be so fearful of Trials amen this little quote I found that was quite interesting he said but after death Faith sees the resurrection a god of Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe when he asked standing over behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith standing by you directs you to that God of resurrection and a God of all wisdom who was who has ordained our path he's standing just behind every trial where's he at he's behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see him with your natural life where is he standing behind every trial amen and that's why I don't think we should be so fearful of the trial because he's in the he's allowing a light to arise in the midst of Darkness amen out of the darkness the light is arising to the upright and the prophet says he's standing behind every trial I was when we were in the Philippines this last time I was speaking to uh brother Nestor and brother Nestor was made this statement and this is what I've been meditating on for a long time he said this statement he says I don't I'm going to get this right he says I don't dread you said dread or fear troubles coming to the church because I don't dread troubles coming to church he said I welcome them now up to this point I was like polar opposite he said every time Trouble Comes to the church something good happens and if you remember the last the one that he was talking about when brother brother Nestor came here the last time which is about four years ago I believe it was when he was here when he flew over here when he landed he found out that because of an earthquake they had right before he left amen that the engineer had come in and condemned the building that they had their Church on and where they had their church was also his home he had a home on the back side of the church and the engineer come and condemned it and gave him like 48 hours to vacate the premises and while brother Nestor was in the plane landed he got this news and found out they had no church and he was homeless all in a moment's time no church and homeless because of an earthquake and you say how could God allow that to happen to a church into a brother Nestor or somebody who sacrificed how could it happen but here we are four years later and they have another church amen that's better than the one that they had amen they had no parking now they have a whole parking lot they've got extra space that they can use when they have big meetings amen and brother Nestor has a home a beautiful home and he's never had a home since he entered the ministry he's never had his own home and now he has a home that he can entertain or a house 80 ministers in their lives when they come together for meetings and he's sitting there telling me this and this is a seasoned brother who's seen a lot and he says I don't dread troubles coming to church I welcome them because every time trouble is struck the church something good has happened and I said oh God I need an adjustment in my thinking and so I've been meditating on that for over a month and and then this this started coming together for me just in the last week then I began to realize that the things I've dreaded the most amen are when God showed himself mightiest on my behalf the darkest times in my life is when God has showed us himself Supernatural in my life it wasn't the good times it wasn't all the blessings amen I I thankful for all the blessings and all the good times but the times that I saw a living God come on the scene were some of the Darkest Hours of my life and some of the greatest testimonies I have come from the worst situations not from the best from the worst from the worst comes the best my greatest testimonies the greatest things I share amen the Fulfillment of scriptures and all these things come from trouble sometimes in my life sicknesses and darkness and family troubles and church troubles if out of that God has moved supernaturally and done things and I can testify over and over and over again of a mighty God who answers prayer and delivers and comes on the scene in the darkest of ours why because I was in dark hours and in trouble and in sick and in all kinds of situations I said God help me to get to that place where brother Nester is where I'm no longer dreading the things that are coming when we see the billowing clouds rolling and sometimes you can see a trial coming you ever been there you can just see it's getting ready to hit amen I want to see the Angels Wings a blessing in disguise I want to see how God is going to allow a light to arise in this Darkness I don't know the the Hebrew children didn't know Daniel didn't know amen but God knew and God knows for us and that's where I want to be amen I want to look at another aspect of this as we move forward in Jeremiah 29 and verse 10 he says for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and I'd just like to say our life is not a random set of events our trials are not a random set of events but God said I know the plans I have towards you he's tearing Jeremiah before they're taken captive and carried to Babylon that he has a Time marker that you're going to enter this trial I'm allowing it to happen and it'll be for seven years and at the end of 70 years I'm going to bring you out listen Jeremiah is not saying if you're good and behave yourself and I might think about it you might persuade me to change my mind amen God is saying I know when this trial will start and I know when this trial will end because I I know the thoughts that I think to you thoughts of good and not of evil they're getting ready to get carried captive Amen to a pagan culture in society under a pagan King taken from Jerusalem and Jerusalem sacked and destroyed and carried away to another land I mean he says I don't have thoughts of evil but I have thoughts of good towards you to bring you to an expected end I know the time that this will begin and I know the time that this will end breaks gone I want to look at Genesis chapter 50. I want to look at the lies of Joseph now with this in mind this is the end of Joseph's life this is after Jacob his father passes away he's saved his brother and they're all there with him in Egypt and they say they say so shall ye say unto Joseph this is his brothers forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto the evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the Servants of God of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God you haven't done anything to me I'm positioned by God but as for you you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive they thought that they had they thought that by their wickedness they had dumped something horrible to their brother and their brother is standing there saying you meant it for evil that was your intention but there was another purpose behind it all and God meant it for good and I am in the position the place of God and you were only a tool that he used to work a work of evil because of your corrupt heart to bring about good and to get me in this position today so how can I be angry at you and kill you and have retribution listen there's going to be people who speak evil about you reject you say horrible things and maybe even do horrible things to you but praise God God is trying to get us in position and when we understand who we are and that nothing can happen in the life of a Believer unless God first approves of it and the clock is ticking right on time and everything has to be this way when we come to the realization of that nobody in this life is hurting you everybody is helping you every evil deed every Wicked happening I mean every underhanded deed every misconduct at work every that was helping you say how is that possible I don't know but it's possible look at the lives of Joseph brother Franco can you pull up the um whiteboard I want to look at something in the white on the Whiteboard for just a minute because I think it's super interesting if we go to Genesis 37 let's turn to Genesis 37 really quick sometimes I like a service like this to get her head screwed on straight because in this life as human beings we think the human thoughts are wrong God's thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts the human thinking is all upside down and backwards and the laodice and think he's completely contrary to God and sometimes we just need a old-fashioned Bible study and go back through some of these things to get our heads screwed back on straight so that we can think like God thinks and our thinking go to a higher level amen so so Genesis 37 verse 5. and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it into his brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my chief arose and also stood upright and behold your sheep stood round about and made obescence to my sheep and his brother said unto him shout thou indeed Reign Over us our shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his Brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obesecence to me and he told it to his father and to his brother and then his father rebuked him and said in him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his Brethren envied him but his father observed the sayings here he comes with a dream and then the dream is a prophecy and the prophecy of Joseph rising to a position of power of authority and Dominion in his brothers bowing to him and you can see his brothers hated this dream because they didn't want to bow to Joseph so what they did what they intended to do is deal with Joseph so that the dream won't come to pass amen but you can't stop prophecy and you can't get somebody out of a god-given position all you can do by your actions is put them in position how can a man outdo God how can how can the efforts of human beings change the mind of God and change the position God wants to put somebody in so they in their own thinking are dealing with Joseph Joseph thinks he's going to rule over us well we'll just get rid of Joseph so that what he thinks will never come to pass the problem is it wasn't what Joseph thought it was a prophecy that was in Joseph's life and nothing was going to change that prophecy and so they sold him into slavery I think we have the white board up I want to I want to take a look at this I want to look at the path of the prophecy because it's super interesting to me when when the when the dream gives a prophecy the prophecy is him in Dominion him in authority and everybody bowing to him so the first thing that God does to bring the Fulfillment of the prophecy number one is rejection because God has got to get Joseph in position for the prophecy but I don't think Joseph thought step one was rejection do you then we come to step two in slip two is slavery which brings him to Potiphar's house right so in order to fulfill the prophecy God knows the plans that he has for Joseph plans of good and not of evil to bring an expected in in order to get Joseph in his predestinated position Step One is rejection step two is slavery bondage sold as a slave to potiphar then in Potiphar's house then he starts to rise now there's a rising of Joseph and Potiphar's house he's given responsibility he's given Authority he becomes the steward of Potiphar's house and potiphar is an official amen under Pharaoh amen so if you believe that his position next to Pharaoh is the destination then it looks like the plan of God is working working him close to the prophecy he's getting pretty close to the prophecy so as he gets closer and closer becomes a greater man and Potiphar's house so that potiphar doesn't even know his Daily Business he doesn't even know how much he has amen he's left all of that to Joseph Joseph's become a great man amen so we're going to come to step three is a false accusation I don't even know if that's spelled right a full false accusation so step three God allows a false accusation and and Joseph is pinned for a crime he never committed his reputation is ruined his name is slandered and this false accusation moves him to step four and step four is prison and and we have to think this is a man who starts with the destination in Prophecy he knows the end result he doesn't know the path there amen but everything that's happening to him is looking like it's moving away from the prophecy but not God knows the plan that he has the thoughts that he has for Joseph to bring him to an expected end and God knows just how long it'll take he knows how long he needs to be in this position he knows how he knows when to move him from this position to this position because God has a plan and the prophecy is not going to fail listen there's a prophecy in each one of our lives God has called us to manifest and manifest Bride In the End Time amen Christ in Bride form in your flesh and God wants that manifest and he knows the way he wants you to manifest it he knows how he wants you to declare the word and he knows what it's going to take to get each one of us into position for that manifestation but sometimes the first step is rejection was that your first step and receiving the word rejection amen amen so many times you go from rejection and then all of a sudden you go to the next phase and things start to get better and it looks like okay now I'm moving into this prophecy I'm becoming all that God wants me to be and God will absolutely Blindside us and do something we never saw coming and he allows Joseph to get be falsely accused of raping Potiphar's wife his name slander D Fame cast into prison forgot about and now it looks like the absolute death of the prophecy but Joseph didn't know I don't think anybody else know that that was the step that he needed to get right underneath the throne God was positioning him Potiphar's wife was trying to destroy Joseph the Potiphar's wife was pushing Joseph into position the people who have tried to destroy your reputation who slandered you and spoke evil of you they're trying to get rid of you destroy you or whatever hurts your reputation they have no idea the only thing that they can do is work into the plan of God and put you in a better position that's why I said sometimes I like services like this to get our head screwed on straight so we can say listen no weapon formed against me shall prosper No Lie is going to change what God wants to do in my life no amount of rejection no amount of being Cast Away lied about uh forsaken none of those things are going to change what God has already saw in my life everything must be working according to his plan what I need to do is not despair but lift my voice and praise God because I already know by a prophecy in this end time what my destination is I already know the prophecy I don't need to worry about all the steps God already has them mapped out and he knows when to move them God knows God knew oh my goodness God knew when it was time to take Joseph from Potiphar's house into prison and God would allow an evil spirit to start moving and Potiphar's wife so she would desire amen the wrong kind of relationship with Joseph Joseph had no desire for it amen it wasn't Joseph's fault he didn't do anything wrong but how else is God going to get Joseph in prison through a false accusation step number five from prison to throne nobody would have expected that nobody expected that the prison house the dungeon was the step he needed to get to the throne we thought maybe potiphar would introduce him and he would see how great he is and what great work he did for potiphar and then he would ask potiphar can he be my Steward and who knows but God doesn't think like you and I think amen God has to get him first God's got to get him in Egypt so what's the best way to get him in Egypt make his brothers hate him and make him sell him to a caravan that's going down to Egypt and they took him down to Egypt They Carried him down to Egypt you know those slave Traders weren't hurting Joseph one bit he was sold to slave Traders can Joseph get mad at the slave Traders he can't get mad at the slave Traders any more than get mad at his brethren any more than he could get mad at Potiphar's wife or potiphar because Joseph at the end of the story has come to a higher revelation and say it was all meant for evil but God meant it for good I am in the place of God amen nobody can put me in and nobody can take me out the only thing circumstances can do is push me into place and help me build character along the way that I'm going to need for the next stage in life every harmful thing somebody does to you don't don't let it destroy you amen make them Stepping Stones not stumbling stones and realize God's not forgotten about me he's not forgotten and it looks like things are going worse they're not going worse maybe worse is what you need to get right under the throne amen so when Pharaoh gets angry at his Butler and it is Baker why did Pharaoh get angry at the Butler and the baker he got angry at the butler in the baker because because Joseph was in prison and God sent them to prison amen remember there's a whole story behind it it doesn't matter the story the story what we need to know is Joseph's in prison he's got to get these two servants cast out in the prison then they have dreams and then there's an interpretation of the dreams then there's one restored there's one killed and and then at an appointed time listen Joseph was down there wasting away and he had one request he said when you are restored to Pharaoh would you please mention me to pharaoh and this man agrees he agrees I will mention you to Pharaoh amen and so now now guess what he does when he gets out and he gets restored he forgot what he promised Joseph the question is was he hurting Joseph was he forgetting was was his forgetting an offense or did it work into the plan because he forgot to mention Joseph because it wasn't time to mention Joseph but there would come a time that Pharaoh would have a dream and this dream would trouble pharaoh and trouble and Pharaoh troubled by this dream would now begin to ask is there anybody that can interpret the dream and ask his wise men and want to know what the meaning of the dream is and it's at that moment that this servant has an aha moment ah my Lord I forgot until just this convenient moment Joseph could be down there in prison going that guy he promised me he told me he would say what a dirty scoundrel he gets out I helped him and he doesn't even have enough kind courtesy to the Bible is written about real people in real situations but this is where we live amen and all of a sudden I don't need to get mad at the guy at work what I should do is send him a little thank you note the person is trying to slander hurt the reputation you should say thank you amen because if you're able to do that it must be because God wants it done or now we told a lie about you we falsely accuse you about something and now you've lost your job and you must say well if if I've lost my job God must be repositioning me so I need to send a thank you note to that that manager and that guy who lie that setup scheme that they set up I need to write them a little thank you note and say thank you amen because I know there's a prophecy in my life and nothing you can do can hurt me or move me outside of that prophecy if God allowed you to do it the only thing you can do is move me further into the prophecy amen I say God help us to get our head screwed on strength not the Panic not to lose our mind not to lose our Revelation every time bad things happen but to recognize amen God I've got a prophecy in my life God has already showed me amen by the end time Vision who I am and what his plan is for me and that I'm going to reach I'm going to make I'm going to be there I will be manifesting bride I will take a body change these atoms will change I know that will happen how I get from here to there I don't know it may be a little up a little down a little sideways some backwards and forwards I don't know but I will get here and everything that happens has to be moving me here because God knows the thoughts he has towards me to bring me to this expected end but Frank if we could go back to the PowerPoint it's amazing how Jesus came and he came according to prophecy and as he was born amen he was rejected right from his birth because they didn't believe she was virgin they thought there was some funny business going on and right from the beginning he gets rejection but then he comes out with healing campaigns and it's like Joseph and Potiphar's house now he gets some he gets crowds gathered people loving him he gets all this going on until a woman makes a false accusation and that woman is the false Church and she makes a false accusation and that false accusation has Jesus on trial with the government because of a false accusation ruining his reputation smiting him amen and they kill him under capital punishment he goes into the prison house but praise God that's just the next step to the throne so if that's how Joseph's life is if that's how Jesus life is and how do you think our life's going to be I don't know I don't expect it to get a lot better I expect it to be the same way everybody else's was trial and tribulation all the way but by the grace of God everyone is pushing teaching gaining we're moving in the program of God I want to look at this picture here there's a quote that I'd like to read out of standing in the gap and we've been through standing in the Gap so much the message is one that means something to me in particular means a lot I believe brother Branham is so real in this message and he's explained so much but in the message standing in the Gap brother Branham is suffering himself with rejection he's preached the message he's come he's come to the third pool he's come to the opening of the word he's come to everything his ministry had been pointing to he comes to this great event of the opening of the seals and afterwards he suffered rejection nobody would hear what he had to say nobody understood what he was preaching and he was being rejected for what he said and he himself is suffering under the rejection and he wants he wants to to to run away he wants to go up and be a guide and he wants to go help Bud Southwick and we know the story so well but but along then before that he starts having this dream that he's trying to find his brother-in-law who's who's an alcoholic and a bum and and he sees himself as a bomb and and he goes through all of this and he goes into the restaurant and in the restaurant he sees the mountain man who he he admires and he wants to be like him and and he keeps working this plan he wants to get away from the people away from the rejection nobody heard his message he wants to run away and so under this suffering of this trial he he sees these two men that look like him and Fletcher Broyhill Fletcher boy and and all of this takes place and he starts driving down the road I just love this story we've talked about it before but it just pay close attention God was going to show this mountain range to brother branna and God was going to tell him that your name is written in that mountain range and that mountain range explains your life the story of your life is in that mountain range your name is on that mountain range and that mountain range is right there in a specific spot it's there it's been there for a long time it didn't just move there that day and God before the foundation of the world God had to know that he was going to have a prophet suffering under rejection having need of encouragement and a revelation at a specific point in time at a specific spot on the map and he had to prepare this sign how many thousands or millions of years before Amen in a certain spot because he knew by his foreign knowledge that there's going to be a certain trial strike my prophet and he needs a certain encouragement at a certain place on the map at a certain point in time and how in the world can we think that when we get into a trial God doesn't know where we're at and God doesn't know what we're happening and what is happening gone and don't you know and we say things and I say them too I say things like God don't you see what I'm going through and it's laughable when we sit here in this context it's laughable but under despair under the trial under the agony we begin to cry out God don't you see what I'm going through we like to we're like the uh the the disciples in the boat don't you care that we perish but did he care yes he cared did he know yes he known did he know that his Prophet Hey listen this Prophet had a Monumental job to do so God was going to provide him Monumental encouragement says in the message standing in the Gap he's driving along he said as in Billy and I started on down the road we started going on down the road Billy went to sleep again and and it said the voices speaking to him said I'll give you an everlasting sign I said Lord what I waited a little bit and nothing happened I said what is the Everlasting sign Lord and I waited a few minutes and just in I looked over to see Billy he was asleep and he said I'll give you an everlasting sign again he said look Westford from where you're at I turned my head like this in the truck to look slowly down you know and oh my the spirit of the Lord I felt like I could scream and cry and I looked and I just saw a mountain with white caps on it and I said I don't know see no I don't know I don't see no Everlasting sign about that and he said your name is wrote all over it I stopped and I looked up on the mountain and I seen those Seven Hills now here if you want to see something there was Seven Peaks on top of a mountain one mountain that ran for several miles the last Mountain before you go into the other country no more Mountains after that and it was running from east to west the mountain set and it was snow-capped on top the first two small Peaks and then a larger Peak and then another small Peak then a larger Peak than a small Peak than a great large Long snow-capped Mountain and I said Lord I do not understand what that means he said how many Peaks are there I said they're seven I said how many letters in your name God is directing him right to this he said b-r-a-n-h-a-m that's seven if you're counting m-a-r-r-i-o-n-7 b-r-a-n-h-a-m-7 and there was three outstanding Peaks he said those three Peaks are the first second third pool the first one was your first part of your ministry small hill then your first pull pretty high you know signing the hand then there was a little interval in there the time that I was taken off from being too tired many of you remember it and then come to discernment the second poem now I I've had another about a few years here of just kind of little Peaks see back like my Ministry wasn't yet and then come the third one three is a number of completions see the third one the next Peak was five number of Grace then the next Peak was seven the number of perfection in the end sixth day shall you labor the seventh is the Sabbath the end of the week the End of Time see and I stopped and I showed it to Billy and I looked at them and he said let that stand if there's ever a doubt in your mind remember this place and come back here everyone looked at this and he's he starts the god starts to describe this to him see you've worked up your ministry and you come to your first he said the first second third puller there before brother Branham ever knew that there was three portals in the ministry that mountain was there was three polls written in his life before he was ever born there was three pools on that mountain he didn't manufacture those he didn't produce those they were already written in the mountain then he says there's a little interval between the first and second he said that's the time that I was taken off the field for being too tired guess what it was already in the mountain God knew he would leave the field being too tired God already had the Peaks and already had the valleys and how high the peak how low the valley the next big the spacing between the Peaks is it was all his life was written in stone before he was born you think gone now let me let me ask you this God wrote that in stone knew the life story of the Prophet Knew by foreknowledge what was going to happen where the Peaks were The Valleys where where the three pools he had it all written there his name was on he knew what he would be named he knew it would have seven letters he wrote it all out there do you think God changed anything in that prophet's life he'd have to rearrange the mountains do you think God was surprised and disappointed at the valley do you think God would come to brother Branham and brother branham's too tired and taken off the field and you think brother remember go I'm surprised in you God already knew God already knew we've hit valleys we've hit frustrations we've had Peaks we've had highs we've had lows do you think God didn't know anything God's going to come to you through your values I'm just really disappointed in you God already knew your valleys he already knew your whole highs your lows your setbacks God already knew amen before the foundation of the world God has even ordained our trials when it comes down to the end of it the only thing we can say is thank you God I can't run my own life I can't figure out whether I'm up or down I don't know if I'm in a valley going into one coming out of one on a sometimes I have no idea where I'm at in life but God knows exactly where I'm at in life sometimes I don't trust my own thinking I don't trust my own emotions I don't know what's happening inside of me I don't know what's happening around me but one thing's for sure God knows the thoughts he has towards me and I'm coming to the expected end and I may not it may not look pretty I may not do it in Grand fashion but it's already spelled out and I'm going to get there and there's nothing anybody can do to change God's mind about me there's nothing I can do to change God's mind about me he's already wrote it do you think listen do you think when brother Brenham left to feel too tired weary he was having a nervous breakdown his nerves were on edge I meant and he was weeping and he was laying in bed he was sleeping and he was tired do you think God was going oh man I've got a plan for him I hope he gets back out there I hope he gets his act together because I need him why is it so easy to believe this about Joseph and about William Brandon but not about us we believe it wholeheartedly about William brand we believe it wholeheartedly about Joseph but when it comes to us but yeah brother Chad but you don't know I did this I did that listen I'm so thankful God gave us a life of a prophet on display that he could tell us that his Goods his bads what he did right what he did wrong the mistakes he made he even the angel even rebuked him for the way he was having healing campaigns because he was wearing himself out it was even his fault that he went into the valley but God knew it beforehand let's say God he knew his tent would get stolen from him he knew his friends would reject him he knew the Pentecostals would turn their back on him but guess what nothing ever moved him out of his position everything was putting him into position until he come to that third pool and if you look at that third pull brother bam talks about it he says that one then there's none after that that one just moves off into eternity brother man can look at that and he knows after the opening of the seals after the opening of the word the third pull of his ministry he's not looking for another Peak he's not looking for another amen he's going to move that Peak that third pull the opening of the word that's it that's the climax that's the end that'll move off into eternity um and God took his Prophet home two years after the opening of the seals because the third pool was the last peak in his life and that would move off into eternity it was already written I say if God can do it for Joseph and God can do for William Branham God has done it for me by faith I believe that God has already knows the thoughts that he has towards me and everything that happens is moving me into my position do I understand it all no I doubt Joseph understood it all and we know for sure brother Birmingham didn't understand it all that's why we don't understand it all but I said God help me think about life the way you think about my life give me I Salve to rub in my eyes so that I look at circumstances different than I looked at them before this isn't somebody trying to destroy me this is God using a tool to move me is gone this is going to read just a couple more quotes and we'll finish and super sign he said God knows the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything do we believe that that it would work out just to his glory and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes God is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time sometimes we get weary upset we get hastily we think oh we must do this or do that but remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to this great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his knowledge God doesn't predestinate by his desire he's not willing that any should perish but his foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew that this would be our day he had plans for this day he has plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he is always on time I want to say Amen to that I believe that about me do you believe it about you we believe it because the prophet said it we saw it work out in his life but I want to believe it about me that he allows even my mistakes to work together for his glory do I make mistakes yes do I suffer from yes am I sorry for him yes but he'll allow even my mistakes to work together for his glory because he has a plan and he wasn't waiting for me to make my plan before he made his plan now I want to finish with this thought so this world is falling apart let her fall apart that's all right it's going to do it anyhow this world is falling apart the more it fall apart the more it'll push you in position the closer tragedy strikes and the more difficult circumstances get the only thing an economic collapse what can it do put you in position a government collapse puts you in position War breakout on your doorsteps put you in position I mean all the businesses close down put you nothing can happen that will not put you in God's position the world is falling apart brother members that let her fall apart we're not here to save the world the world is destined to collapse now look at this quote oh if you would only see it it was the waters that destroyed the world but it was the same Waters that saved Noah and also save the whole earth for Noah I just want to say atomic fire is about to fall but the same atomic fire that's about to fall is going to be you're in my salvation because God will pluck us off of here before that happens and the fire that falls will be what saves us because we're already dark in Christ and before the fire falls the atomic fire falls on the earth God is going to take us in a body change and a transition to another place amen and then the fire is going to save the whole earth for you and I nothing that North Korea is doing is hurting us nothing that that Russia is doing is hurting us nothing that anybody is doing is hurting us nothing that Iran is doing is hurting us everything that the world is doing is putting us into our prophetic position and now the news should not scare us now it doesn't mean we shouldn't be scared for loved ones and worried about those we care about we can't help those things but for us individually nothing no weapon formed against me can prosper nobody else can have another plan that trumps God plan and nobody can move me away from God's plan everything that's happening everything that's going to happen what's happening now and what happens next the next law that changes is not going to disrupt you it's going to put you in position I'll say it this way when brother Brown told us that they're going to close the doors of these churches closing the door to these churches will not hurt the bride one drop it'll put her in position whether we're here for it or not for here for it I don't know everything that's going to happen I don't claim to know what's going to happen but nothing that happens they change the law if they begin to tighten up things in religious circles it's not hurting we're not scared right I say God whatever happens help me to keep one thing in my mind and in my heart above everything else and that is you know the thoughts that you have towards me thoughts of good and not of evil to bring me to an expected end before Nebuchadnezzar's Army marched into Jerusalem he told Jeremiah I know the thoughts that I have it looks evil but most thoughts are not evil they're good to bring you to expect it in and after 70 years your this trial has a starting date this trial has an ending there and I trust that God the god of the Bible let's all stand the falling apart of the world is the Deliverance of the Bride the purging of the Earth by fire is a preparation for a honeymoon thank God musicians if you please come brother John this power had some prey dear Lord Jesus we thank you God there's so many wonderful truths that you have told us in your word God these truths are so beyond the human scope of imagination they're so beyond our normal realm of thinking that God we must be constantly reminded of these things Lord I Thank You Lord that you've placed them in the message you wrote them in your Bible Lord to give us this encouragement that we need Lord we don't know exactly what we're facing in the months and years to come we don't know exactly how dark it'll get it's dark but it'll get darker we don't know how dark it'll be we don't know what must happen we don't know all the things that will transpire but God we don't really need to know what we need to know you've already told us that you know the way I take and when I've been tried I shall come forth as gold Lord I'm trusting in you with all of my heart I pray God that you would give us your mind the mind of Christ the revelation of your word and may it push out every other thought Lord every thought that's contrary every fear and anxiety may you move it away from us Lord it may Faith take its place God may we walk with confidence in this world knowing that you have a plan for each of our lives and nothing nothing nothing nothing will move us out of your plan no power that anybody else has no scheme that anybody else can scheme up will change the direction you're moving us in God help us to relax Trust to have faith in the midst of Darkness God forgive us Lord for Lord are our emotions forgive us for allowing the emotions to rule bring us to a higher level of faith may we walk like you would walk in this life Lord Jesus when you were walking you weren't nervous you weren't scared in the face of trials in the face of moms who wanted to Stone you you weren't afraid is storms that threaten your life you were not afraid and trials and imprisonment even in crucifixion are you faced it knowing god had a plan you had a plan Lord that you were working your plan saving your people Lord I pray that you'd help us to walk in this life as you walk that you would grant us a higher level of Faith than we've ever operated by before Lord as you unveil your plan and unveil your word and constantly remind us of your word May the hearing of the word bring Faith maybe you said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word May the constant hearing of this word bring us to that level of faith we need to operate God it's your word we believe it take us from here Lord as we part ways this evening and go home May these things that we heard may they resonate within and may we ruminate upon them may they become part of us as we digest it it may just become part of our spiritual life we love you we ask for your blessing on us your grace in our lives to manifest itself as we walk in this Dark World with our opening scripture and this thought Lord May the upright see the light arise in all the darkness and in every dark situation may we watch for your light to shine we love your father we thank you for your word we ask you and bless us as we part in Jesus Christ's name we pray I have a maker he form my heart and before even time began my life was in his hand he know s he
