[0:00] now verse 10 but the chief priests
[0:02] consulted that they might put Lazarus
[0:04] also to death they already wanted to
[0:07] kill Jesus because Jesus was exposing
[0:09] their system he was exposing their
[0:11] religion he was exposing the the the the
[0:14] the falseness of their heart and and he
[0:16] was exposing the whole thing and the
[0:18] people were going after Jesus and they
[0:19] were losing their in influence and for
[0:21] Envy they wanted to kill Jesus but now
[0:24] it wasn't just Jesus that they needed to
[0:26] kill but the one that he raised back to
[0:29] life is AAR too because now people are
[0:31] being attracted to the one who was
[0:34] raised back to
[0:37] life praise
[0:39] God let's read this again but the chief
[0:41] priest consulted that they might put
[0:43] Lazarus also to death because that by
[0:46] reason of him who Lazarus many of the
[0:50] Jews went away and believed on
[0:53] Jesus what's the problem now the problem
[0:56] now is not just that Jesus is preaching
[0:59] the word exposing the the false Doctrine
[1:02] and the falseness of the church now
[1:04] there's one that's been called by name
[1:06] that's been resurrected to life that's
[1:07] come out of the system and now he's
[1:09] there testifying that Jesus is the
[1:12] Messiah testifying that the voice of the
[1:14] Resurrection is present and the life of
[1:16] the resurrection and the power of the
[1:17] Resurrection is present tense and now
[1:20] not just because of Jesus but now
[1:23] because of Lazarus many of the Jews amen
[1:26] are Believing on
[1:28] Jesus why is the resurrection power
[1:31] supposed to do today it's supposed to
[1:33] restore a bride back to her position why
[1:36] because she's now an attraction amen
[1:38] that's attracting the attention of the
[1:40] people and so people will come see her
[1:43] resurrected life and Believe on Jesus
[1:46] Christ that's what our life is supposed
[1:48] to produce we've been resurrected amen
[1:51] we've been resurrected out of dead
[1:52] denominationalism we've been resurrected
[1:54] out of the false understanding we've
[1:56] been brought back to the original life
[1:59] the original faith of the of the
[2:00] forefathers we've been back to the
[2:02] original life that came from Pentecost
[2:04] why was the life restored amen so that
[2:06] people could see there's a resurrection
[2:08] power on Earth today we don't have to
[2:10] live a compromising life we don't have
[2:13] to live a second rate Christian Life we
[2:15] don't have to have hypocrisy all around
[2:17] us there can be a genuine life lived for
[2:19] Jesus Christ there can be a real church
[2:21] just like there was in the first century
[2:23] that'll give all that'll believe the
[2:25] word that'll stay with it that'll
[2:27] manifest the life amen and that's an a
[2:29] attration that'll attract people to
[2:31] Jesus Christ now that becomes the
[2:35] threat
[2:37] right I don't know about you but I would
[2:39] like to be a
[2:41] threat to the kingdom of the devil lord
[2:45] I would like my resurrected life to be a
[2:50] threat not me cuz I have
[2:53] nothing but a life a resurrected life
[2:58] that seed of God that was laying dormant
[3:00] inside has sprung to life at the voice
[3:02] of the Resurrection we heard the call
[3:05] we've come to life and now it's his life
[3:07] in here manifesting
[3:10] itself
