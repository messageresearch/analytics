========================================
whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met what what two omnipotence have met amen the seed the word the the the the life of God inside a child of God with the the the word for this age when those two come together amen there's Faith to believe it it falls in good ground what is that that's two omnipotence coming together and when two omnipotence coming together you can't stop the word from manifesting amen why because it's God and God it's Christ in Christ is the word and the word do you understand God did it before the foundation of the world he's the son of man that SED seed into his field he prepared the ground ahead of time he brought the right seed right the right seed in the right season and brought forth the right soil at the right time and he made sure the two got together he sent a seed SE your way one day amen and that seed s may have tossed seed Here There and Everywhere amen but he happened to get some over in your field and when it come into your field amen two omnipotents come together and your life changed what religion couldn't do for you before what denomination couldn't do for you before when this predestinated seat of the hour the anointed word for the hour hit the good ground of the predestinated seed in your soul the two come together two omnipotence met and your life changed you quit talking the way you talked you quit walking the way you walked you quit thinking the way you thought that wasn't you cleaning up your life that was the seed coming to its resting place that was the word coming to the word the word predestinated and the word for this age came together amen it's worked in every age and it works in this age it's the power that's being released in our lives it's not us working our way into something it's not our us pushing or prodding or pulling or it's not us trying to create something by by strive by effort or by whatever amen that's all human that's not going to work amen but it's just a yielding ourselves it's just a surrender what God has already ordained God has already placed it in you and he's already brought it forth in this age and you didn't have anything to do with that seed getting in your soul and you didn't have anything to do with the word coming forth in this age so what do you think that you're going to do now to make it do something amen it's not your effort all you can do is say beat unto me according to Thy word all you can do is surrender to it and let those two omnipotents come together amen listen it's beyond you it's beyond your thinking it's beyond your efforts it's beyond your desire it's beyond anything that's in you as a human being it's so much deeper than your human realm it's the part that was intended to be you from the beginning it's the thought of God that's coming into manifestation in this season it's not you it's him in you
