[0:00] I was thinking about that other day is
[0:02] like you know you think about it with
[0:03] with Noah there was Noah on that day and
[0:06] everyone around him was saying Noah you
[0:08] have lost your mind you are crazy like
[0:12] you keep saying that you heard from God
[0:16] and you're his voice piece for the day
[0:19] and you keep saying it's going to rain
[0:21] and we have all these scientific
[0:23] instruments around us proving that
[0:26] you're a
[0:27] liar like you realize the advancement of
[0:30] Science and Technology was there to
[0:33] prove that God's word could not be held
[0:35] or kept like everything advaned to a
[0:38] place to disprove God what do you
[0:41] think's going on today where is science
[0:45] and technology and the devices of man's
[0:48] imaginations that we have strapped to
[0:49] our hips are trying to do it's trying to
[0:52] deny the revelation of Christ in you if
[0:55] you haven't realized it there's a lot of
[0:57] scientific instruments and advancement
[1:00] and Technology with one purpose one
[1:02] objective what's the devil's objective
[1:04] to disprove God's
[1:07] word that's his whole objective you
[1:10] think science and technology is
[1:12] advancing so you can have an easier life
[1:14] no one objective disprove God's word and
[1:17] try to convince you you are not who you
[1:19] think you
[1:22] are so how you better be careful you
[1:24] better gird up the loins of your mind
[1:27] you know gird it up like uh you know um
[1:30] uh you tie it up tight right so like if
[1:32] you I think in the old orients you know
[1:34] when they would say gird up your the
[1:35] loins of your mind like they like gird
[1:37] up their jacket they got to go for a run
[1:39] you know we can't let this trip us up so
[1:41] he's saying G up the loins your mind
[1:42] don't let anything loose hanging around
[1:45] be careful what you're listening to
[1:46] careful what you're you're you're
[1:47] consuming cuz it's all there with one
[1:50] objective to discredit God's word and
[1:52] get you to disbelieve it all of this
[1:55] science technology and
[1:58] advancements but Noah just believed it
[2:02] Noah just believed that word Noah just
[2:04] believed that this word was the truth
[2:08] and he put his life to it yes amen
[2:11] everything he had he gave to
[2:13] it he testified that he believed what he
[2:16] believed in the life that he lived every
[2:19] single dayen not just what he
[2:23] preached but he went to work cutting
[2:25] down the trees putting it all together
[2:28] boiling the sap every day for 120 years
[2:32] he was testifying that he believed what
[2:35] he said amen and think about it it's not
[2:38] always that we have a quote it's not
[2:40] always that we can repeat a Bible verse
[2:43] what are you doing every day every
[2:46] moment of every day are you telling the
[2:48] world that you believe you're you're
[2:50] leaving soon do you believe you're going
[2:53] out of here
[2:54] sometime that this world is not your
[2:56] home you're just passing
[2:58] through are you giving your life to
[3:01] pursue all that it can offer
[3:03] you like Noah testified he believed the
[3:06] message by just getting up and cutting
[3:08] down
[3:10] trees I love that I love the Simplicity
[3:13] of that he just got up and did exactly
[3:16] what God called him to do build the ark
[3:18] amen and then I love it cuz God was in
[3:21] the ark amen he never said Noah go in
[3:24] the ark he said Noah come in the ark
