[8:50] pray together let's turn to Hebrews chap
[8:53] 11 I also wanted to give you an update
[8:56] on sister Joyce Wy she's been gone for
[8:58] several weeks she went to Arizona to uh
[9:01] be with her sister because her sister's
[9:03] husband was passing away they knew that
[9:05] he was passing the time was short she
[9:07] went down there so she could be with her
[9:08] sister and I think it's ended up being
[9:10] more than three weeks maybe going on
[9:12] four weeks but she's due back tomorrow
[9:14] she says she misses everybody and can't
[9:15] wait to see everybody so she appreciates
[9:18] your prayers but that's a little update
[9:20] for sister Joyce let's turn to Hebrews
[9:22] chapter
[9:26] 11 and let's look at verse 8
[9:31] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[9:33] go out into a place which he should
[9:35] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[9:37] and he went out not knowing whether he
[9:39] went by faith he sojourned in the land
[9:41] of promise as in a strange country
[9:44] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[9:45] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[9:48] promise for he looked for a city which
[9:50] had foundations whose Builder and maker
[9:54] is gone amen you'll see why we read that
[9:57] when brother B goes to his opening
[9:58] scripture so let's bow our heads and
[10:00] pray dear heavenly father we thank you
[10:03] Lord that we can gather together tonight
[10:06] we thank you Father that your Holy Ghost
[10:08] gives us leadership Lord and and I
[10:10] believe by your leadership you've called
[10:12] us to play this tape tonight I know it's
[10:14] for a purpose Lord and I'm excited Lord
[10:17] to see what you'll speak to our hearts
[10:19] and what we can gain Lord from hearing
[10:21] this testimony once again Lord I I pray
[10:24] that you'd bless each heart and each
[10:26] life Lord may we open up and receive
[10:28] from you that special portion you have
[10:30] for us tonight and may the word take
[10:32] effect in our lives we ask this blessing
[10:35] in Jesus Christ's name
[10:37] amen amen while you're standing let's
[10:40] turn to Hebrews 13 because we're going
[10:42] to start right when brother brandham
[10:44] goes into his opening scripture so I
[10:45] want you to go ahead and turn to Hebrews
[10:46] 13 and he'll start reading at verse 12
[10:49] you can go ahead and have your seats
[10:51] with that amen I know many of us have
[10:55] heard brother bram's life story but not
[10:56] everybody has and for me when I started
[10:59] thinking about it I know it's been at
[11:01] least a few years but I think several
[11:03] years since I've heard it and so I every
[11:06] time I play a tape I always preview it I
[11:08] read the book and I and I didn't at all
[11:10] I didn't let myself read read any lines
[11:13] out of it because I wanted to do it
[11:14] fresh with everybody today so may God
[11:17] bless you brother Franco you can go
[11:18] ahead and turn on the tape
[11:27] anytime now I wish to read for a text
[11:32] this afternoon just to start off the
[11:34] life story found over in the book of
[11:37] Hebrews the 13th
[11:41] chapter and let's begin here about I'd
[11:45] say about the 12th
[11:47] verse wherefore Jesus also that he might
[11:51] sanctify the people with his own blood
[11:54] suffered without the gate let us go
[11:59] therefore to him without the camp
[12:03] bearing his
[12:05] reproach for here we have no continuing
[12:09] City but we seek one to come now that is
[12:15] kind of a
[12:17] text for you see if it's a life story or
[12:21] anything pertaining to a human being we
[12:24] don't glorify that and especially a
[12:27] man's past
[12:29] if it's been as dark as mine has been
[12:32] but I thought if we read the scripture
[12:35] God would bless the scripture and my
[12:37] thought is that here we have no
[12:40] continuing
[12:42] City but we seek one to come now I know
[12:47] that you're very fond of Los Angeles you
[12:50] have a right to be it's a great
[12:53] beautiful city with its Smog and watmore
[12:57] yet it's a beautiful city fine
[13:01] climate but this city cannot
[13:05] continue it's got to have an end I've
[13:09] stood in
[13:10] Rome where the great Emperors in the
[13:13] cities that they thought they would
[13:14] build
[13:15] Immortal and dig down 20 ft to even find
[13:19] the ruins of it I stood where the
[13:22] Pharaohs has had their great kingdoms
[13:25] and you dig down in the ground to find
[13:28] where the great pharaohs
[13:30] ruled all of us like to think about our
[13:34] city and our place but
[13:37] remember it cannot
[13:39] stand when I was a little boy I used to
[13:42] go to a great maple tree in my country
[13:45] we have a lot of hardwood and then we
[13:48] had this maple trees the sugar maple and
[13:52] what we call the hard maple soft maple
[13:56] this great gigantic tree it was the most
[14:00] beautiful tree when I would come in from
[14:02] the fields of working the and and
[14:06] Harvesters I would love to go to this
[14:09] big tree and and sit down under it and
[14:12] and look up and I see it's great Mighty
[14:16] uh uh branches Sway in the wind great
[14:20] huge trunk and I said you know I believe
[14:24] that this tree will be here for a
[14:28] hundreds and hundreds of years not long
[14:31] ago I took a look at the old tree it's
[14:34] just a
[14:35] snag for here we have no continuing City
[14:40] no nothing here on the earth that you
[14:42] can look at will
[14:43] continue it's got to have an end
[14:46] everything that's mortal has to give
[14:49] away to an
[14:50] immortality so no matter how good we
[14:53] build our highways how fine we make our
[14:56] structures it all has to go for here
[15:00] there's nothing can continue just the
[15:03] Unseen is what continues I remember the
[15:07] house that we lived in it was an old log
[15:10] house chinked with mud I perhaps maybe
[15:13] many never seen a house chinked with mud
[15:17] but it was all chinked up with mud and
[15:20] the great huge logs that was in the old
[15:24] house I thought that house would stand
[15:27] for hundreds of years
[15:30] but you know today where that house
[15:31] stood is a housing project it's so much
[15:35] different everything's
[15:38] changing but I used to see my father he
[15:43] was a rather a short stocky man very
[15:48] strong and he was one of the strongest
[15:51] little men that I knew of I met Mr CS a
[15:55] fellow that he used to work with in the
[15:57] logs he was a
[15:59] logger and about a year ago and Mr CS is
[16:05] a very good friend of mine Deacon in the
[16:07] First Baptist Church and he said Billy
[16:11] you ought to be a real powerful man and
[16:15] I said no I'm not Mr CS he said if you
[16:18] took after your daddy you would be he
[16:20] said I seen that man weighing 140 lb
[16:24] load a log on the wagon by himself it
[16:27] weighed 9 100 lb he just knew how to do
[16:31] it he was strong I'd SE him come into
[16:34] the place to wash and get ready for
[16:37] dinner when mother would call him and we
[16:41] had an old apple tree out in the front
[16:45] yard and then there was three or four
[16:47] small ones along towards the back and
[16:50] right in the middle tree there was an
[16:53] old Looking Glass had been broke Mar
[16:56] large one and had been tacked on the
[16:59] side of the tree with some Nails bent in
[17:02] kind of like what some of you cartenders
[17:04] listen in would call coat hangers it had
[17:08] been vent in to hold the glass in its
[17:11] place there was an old 10 comb how many
[17:15] ever seen an old 10 the oldfashioned tin
[17:18] Combs I can just see it and then there
[17:22] was a little wash bench just a little
[17:24] board with the little sling leg beneath
[17:27] it tacked against the tree a little old
[17:29] half sulfur pump there that we pumped
[17:32] the water out and we washed at this old
[17:34] tree and Mama used to take meal sacks
[17:38] and make towels anybody ever use a meal
[17:41] sack
[17:42] towel well I'm sure I'm feel at home now
[17:47] and those big old rough towels and when
[17:49] she'd give us little kides a bath she'd
[17:52] feel like she's rubbing a hide off every
[17:55] time she rub and I remember that that
[17:58] old meal sack and she pull some of the
[18:00] strings out make little tossel to kind
[18:02] of decorate it up how many ever slept on
[18:05] a straw
[18:07] tick well I will
[18:11] say how many ever know what a shuck
[18:13] pillow
[18:15] was well brother Glover I'm at home now
[18:18] sure
[18:19] know straw tick well hasn't been too
[18:22] long since I just come off of one it was
[18:26] oh it's good sleeping cool
[18:29] then the winter time they take the old
[18:30] feather bed and lay on it snow and then
[18:32] have to put a piece of canvas over the
[18:34] top of us to cause the snow blo in the
[18:36] the the cracks in the house you know
[18:38] where the old cadboard shingles would
[18:40] turn up you know and the snow would
[18:42] sweep through it and oh I can remember
[18:45] that very well and then pop used to have
[18:48] a shaving brush ah now this is going to
[18:50] get you it was made out of corn Shucks a
[18:54] shaving brush with corn Shucks he'd take
[18:57] mother's old Li soap that she had made
[18:59] fix it up and put it on his face with
[19:01] this corn shuck brush and shave it with
[19:03] a big old straight razor and on Sunday
[19:06] you take the um the pieces of paper
[19:09] stick around his collar the wor cellid
[19:11] collars and put it around the collar
[19:14] like this to keep the the the lather
[19:17] from getting on his shirt collar did you
[19:19] ever see that done why my my I remember
[19:24] a little Old Spring down below where we
[19:26] used to go get a drink a water and get
[19:28] our water out of an old gourd Dipper how
[19:30] many you ever seen a gourd
[19:33] Dipper well how many of you is from
[19:35] Kentucky anyhow well just look at here
[19:38] at the kyans well M I'm right I thought
[19:41] it was all ois and Aries out here but
[19:44] look like ky's moving in well they did
[19:46] strike ARL in Kentucky few months ago
[19:49] you know so maybe that's some of them's
[19:51] coming this
[19:53] away and then I remember when dad used
[19:55] to come in and take his wash for dinner
[19:58] and he'd roll up his sleeves them little
[20:00] short stubby
[20:02] arms and when he'd pull up his arms to
[20:05] wash thr the water up on his face the
[20:08] muscle just wed in his little arms and I
[20:11] said you know my daddy will live to be
[20:14] 150 years old he was so strong but he
[20:19] died at
[20:21] 52 here we have no continuing City
[20:25] that's right we cannot continue
[20:28] now let's take a little trip all of us
[20:31] there's every one of you here that has a
[20:33] life story just as I do and it's good to
[20:38] stroll down memories Lane once in a
[20:41] while don't you think so just go back
[20:44] and let's all go back for a while back
[20:47] to similar experiences as a a little
[20:51] children and now the first part of the
[20:54] life story I'll just give it a little
[20:58] touched because it's in the book and
[21:00] many of you have the book I was born in
[21:03] a little mountain cabin way up in the
[21:06] mountains of
[21:07] Kentucky had one room that we lived in
[21:11] no rug on the floor not even wood on the
[21:14] floor it was just simply a bare floor
[21:17] and a stump top of a stump cut off with
[21:21] three legs on it that was our
[21:23] table and all those little Broms and
[21:26] pile around there and out on the front
[21:30] of the little old cabin and Waller down
[21:32] looked like where a bunch of possums
[21:34] have been wallering out there in the
[21:36] dust you know all the little brothers it
[21:38] was nine of us and one little girl and
[21:44] she really had a rough time amongst that
[21:46] bunch of boys we have to respect her yet
[21:49] today from the things that we did in
[21:51] those days she couldn't go with us
[21:53] anywhere we'd run her back she was a
[21:55] girl so she couldn't take it you know so
[21:58] so we had and all remember that back
[22:03] behind the
[22:05] table we had just two
[22:08] chairs and they were made out of Limar
[22:12] just Old Hickory uh saplings put
[22:15] together and the bottom of them laced
[22:19] with Hickory bark did anybody ever see a
[22:21] hickory bark chair yeah and I can hear
[22:24] Mama yet all later on when we got into a
[22:28] place where she could have a wooden
[22:30] floor with those babies on her lap like
[22:34] this and rock in that old chair just
[22:36] bang didy bang didy bang on the floor I
[22:39] remember to keep the little ones from
[22:41] going out the door when she would be
[22:43] washing or something she'd lay a chair
[22:45] down and turn it kind of catac cored
[22:47] across the door to keep the little ones
[22:50] from getting out when she had to go
[22:52] spring to get water and so forth and
[22:55] mother was 15 years old when I was born
[22:58] born dad was
[23:00] 18 and I was the first of of the nine
[23:05] children and they told me that the
[23:08] morning I was born now we was very poor
[23:13] just the poorest ol poor and we did not
[23:17] even have a window in this little cabin
[23:20] it had like a little wooden door that
[23:22] you open I doubt whether you ever seen
[23:24] anything like that a little wooden door
[23:26] that open instead of a window you keep
[23:27] keep it open in the daytime you closed
[23:29] it at night we couldn't turn on the
[23:31] electric lights or even burn kerosene in
[23:34] those days we had what you call a grease
[23:38] lamp I don't know where you ever know
[23:39] what a grease lamp was well what do you
[23:42] and you ever buy burn a pine knot for
[23:45] just take a pine knot and light it and
[23:47] Lay It Up on a lid it'll burn and that's
[23:50] smoked up a little bit but they had no
[23:51] franch or anyhow to smoke up so it just
[23:54] the cabin got the smoke in it drawed
[23:56] good CA there plenty of roof up there
[23:58] for to draw through so it um and I was
[24:03] borned on April the the 6
[24:07] 19009 of course you know that makes me a
[24:09] little over 25 now and so uh the morning
[24:13] that I was born mother said that
[24:18] uh they opened up the window now we had
[24:21] no doctors it was a
[24:24] midwife just and that Midwife was my
[24:27] grandmother
[24:28] and so when I was born and my first
[24:32] beginning to cry and and mother wanted
[24:37] to see her child and and she more more
[24:41] than a child herself and when they open
[24:44] up the little window just at the break
[24:47] of day about 5:00 and the there was an
[24:51] old Robin
[24:53] sitting by the side of a little bushes
[24:55] you all seen the picture of it in and my
[24:58] book of my life story an old Robin was
[25:02] sitting there just singing for all that
[25:04] was in him I've always loved
[25:08] Robins now you boys out in radio land
[25:11] don't shoot at my birds you see they're
[25:13] they're that my birds did you ever hear
[25:16] the legend of the robin how he got his
[25:17] red
[25:18] breast I'll stop here a moment how he
[25:22] got his red breast there was a king of
[25:25] kings was dying one day on a cross cross
[25:29] and he was suffering and no one would
[25:32] come to him he had no one to help him
[25:36] and there was a little brown bird wanted
[25:38] to take them Nails out of the Cross and
[25:41] he kept flying into the cross and
[25:44] jerking on those Nails he was too little
[25:47] to pull them out and he got his little
[25:50] breast all red with
[25:52] blood ever since then his breast has
[25:55] been red don't shoot him boys let him
[26:00] alone he was sitting at the side of the
[26:03] window a chirping as the robin singing
[26:08] and Dad pushed back the window and when
[26:11] they pushed the little window door
[26:16] back that light that you see in the
[26:18] picture come whirling in the
[26:21] window says my mother and hung over the
[26:26] bed grandmother didn't know what to say
[26:28] now we are was not a religious family my
[26:33] people are Catholic I'm Irish on both
[26:36] sides my father is strictly Irish
[26:38] Brandon my mother is Harvey only her
[26:42] father married a Cherokee Indian so that
[26:45] broke the little line of the blood of
[26:48] the Irish and father and mother did not
[26:51] go to church and they married out of the
[26:54] church and they had no religion at all
[26:57] and back there in the mountains there
[26:58] was not even a Catholic
[27:00] church so they come over in the early
[27:03] settlers two Broms come over and from
[27:06] that sprung the whole generation of
[27:08] Broms as the genealogy of the family and
[27:12] then she opened when they open this
[27:14] window and this light stood in there
[27:17] they did not know what to do dad had
[27:19] bought him Mama said a new pair of
[27:21] overhauls for this event he's standing
[27:24] with the his arms in the bib of the old
[27:26] overhauls like the Woodsman and loggers
[27:29] used in those days and it frightened
[27:32] them well after i' got up maybe 10 days
[27:37] old or something they taken me up to a
[27:40] little Baptist Church called posum
[27:45] kingdom posum kingdom Baptist Church
[27:49] that's quite a name there's an old
[27:51] circuit preacher the oldfashioned
[27:54] Baptist preacher came through there
[27:57] about about once every two months on uh
[28:00] the people would have a little service
[28:03] together theyd Go sing some songs but
[28:05] they had preaching ever so often on the
[28:07] circuit Rider they paid him each year
[28:10] with a sack of pumpkins and a few things
[28:13] like that you know that the people are
[28:14] raised to giveing and the old preacher
[28:17] came by and there he offered prayer for
[28:20] me as a little boy that is my first trip
[28:24] to church at the year of about something
[28:28] a little over 2 years old the first
[28:31] Vision taking place well they had told
[28:35] around in the mountains there that this
[28:37] light came in so they tried to figure it
[28:40] up some of them said it must have been
[28:42] the sunlight reflecting on a maror in
[28:45] the house but there was no maror in
[28:47] there and the sun wasn't up so it was
[28:50] too early at
[28:51] 5:00 and then all they just passed it by
[28:55] and when is about
[28:58] uh supposed to be near three years old
[29:02] now I have to be honest there's things
[29:06] here that I do not like to
[29:09] say and I wish I could bypass it and not
[29:13] have to say it but yet to tell the truth
[29:16] you must tell the truth if it's on
[29:18] yourself or your people be honest about
[29:21] it then it's always the same my father
[29:24] was a long way from being a religious
[29:27] person he was a typical Mountain boy
[29:30] that drank constantly all the time and
[29:33] he had gotten in some trouble in a
[29:36] fight and there had been two or three
[29:38] men almost killed as they fighting
[29:41] shooting and cutting one another with
[29:43] knives at a some kind of a party up in
[29:46] the mountains and dad had been one of
[29:48] the Ring leaders of this fight because
[29:52] that had had been a friend of his that
[29:54] got hurt and hit someone with a chair
[29:57] and had the man had a knife out and he
[29:59] was going to cut Dad's friend on the
[30:02] floor with this knife through his heart
[30:04] and dad took his part and it really must
[30:08] have been a terrible fight because they
[30:10] from all the way down to burksville many
[30:13] miles away they sent a sheriff up after
[30:16] Dad
[30:17] horseback so the man was laying at the
[30:20] point of death might be some of his
[30:22] people listening in I'm going to call
[30:24] his name will yarberry was his name
[30:27] probably I think some of them is in
[30:29] California of his boys but he was a
[30:31] bully great powerful man killed his own
[30:34] boy with a fenra so he he was a very
[30:38] powerful and Wicked Man and so there was
[30:42] a great knife fight between he and dad
[30:44] and my father almost killed a man so he
[30:46] had to run and leave Kentucky and come
[30:50] across the river to
[30:51] Indiana and um he had a brother that
[30:54] lived at the time in Louisville Kentucky
[30:56] it was was the assistant superintendent
[30:59] of the wood Mosaic Sawmills in Kentucky
[31:02] in Louisville and so Dad come to find
[31:05] his older brother dad was the youngest
[31:07] of the boys of 17 children and so he
[31:12] came to find his older brother and while
[31:15] he was gone for almost a year he could
[31:18] not come back because the law was
[31:21] looking for him and then
[31:24] when we had heard from him by letter
[31:27] signed by another name but that he told
[31:29] Mother how it would be that she'd hear
[31:32] from him and then I remember one day the
[31:35] spring this little cabin was just behind
[31:39] the house and and during that time after
[31:42] there's 9 11 months difference between
[31:45] me and my next brother and he was still
[31:48] crawling and I had a big rock in my hand
[31:51] and I was trying to show him how hard I
[31:53] could throw this rock and the old mud
[31:56] where the spring had run out out of the
[31:59] ground and made the muddy ground and I
[32:03] heard a bird and it was singing up in a
[32:06] tree and I looked up to that tree and
[32:08] the bird flew away and when it did a
[32:12] voice spoke to
[32:14] me I know you think I could not think
[32:17] and remember that but the Lord God who
[32:21] judge the earth and the heavens and all
[32:24] there is knows that I'm telling the
[32:25] truth that bird when it flew away a
[32:29] voice came from where the bird was in
[32:31] the tree like a wind caught in the bush
[32:34] and it said you'll live near a city
[32:38] called New Albany and I've lived from
[32:42] the time I was 3 years old until this
[32:44] time within three miles of New Albany
[32:47] Indiana I went in and told my mother
[32:50] about it well she thought I was just
[32:53] dreaming or something later we moved to
[32:56] Indiana and father went to work for a
[32:58] man Mr wathan a rich man he owns the WAN
[33:02] distilleries and he owned a great shears
[33:05] is maled millionaire and the Louisville
[33:08] Colonels and baseball and so forth and
[33:11] then we live near there and dad being a
[33:15] poor man yet he could not do without his
[33:18] drinking so he he went to making whisky
[33:21] in a in a
[33:23] still and then it worked a hardship on
[33:26] me because I was the oldest of the
[33:29] children I had to come and pack water to
[33:32] this steel to keep those Carls cool
[33:35] while they were making the whiskey then
[33:37] he got to selling it and then he got two
[33:40] or three of those Stills now that's the
[33:42] part I don't like to tell but it's the
[33:44] truth and I remember one day from the
[33:48] barn coming up to the house crying
[33:54] because out at the back of the place was
[33:56] a pond
[33:57] where they used to cut ice many of you
[33:59] remember when they used to cut ice and
[34:00] put it in sawdust that's way Mr won kept
[34:03] ice out there in the country and father
[34:06] was a a chauffer for him a private
[34:09] chauffer and when uh this Pond was full
[34:13] of fish and when they would go to
[34:15] cutting the ice and bring it in and put
[34:18] it in the sawdust and when the ice
[34:20] melted in the summertime as it went down
[34:23] it was kind of clean I suppose more like
[34:25] a lake ice and could use it not to drink
[34:28] but to keep water cold put it around the
[34:31] buckets and their milk and so forth one
[34:34] day packing water from back out at this
[34:37] pump which was about a city block I was
[34:40] squalling to who wouldn't have it
[34:43] because I'd come from school and all the
[34:45] boys went out to the pond fishing I just
[34:47] love to fish and so they uh all got to
[34:52] go fishing but me and I had to pack
[34:54] water for this Ste of course my that had
[34:57] to be mom is prohibition and um I it was
[35:02] such a hardship and I remember coming
[35:05] along there with a stump toe I had a
[35:08] corn cob wrapped under my toe to keep it
[35:10] Out of the Dust did you ever do that
[35:12] just put a corn cob under your toe like
[35:14] this and wrap a string around it it
[35:16] holds your toe right up like a turtle
[35:18] head almost you know sticking up you
[35:20] could track me everywhere I went with
[35:22] this Carn cob under my to stumpage you
[35:25] know didn't have any shoes to wear so we
[35:28] never wore shoes sometime half the
[35:30] winter if we did we it was just what we
[35:32] could pick up somebody would give us and
[35:34] clothes of what somebody charity would
[35:36] give us and I stopped under this tree
[35:41] and I was sitting there just squalling
[35:43] it was in September because I wanted to
[35:46] go fishing I had to pack several tubs of
[35:48] water with little molasse buckets just
[35:50] about that high half a gallon cuz it's
[35:52] just a little lad of about 7 years old
[35:55] and I P him a big tub and then go back
[35:58] and get a another two buckets and come
[36:00] back pump it that's the water we had and
[36:03] there go to run off a batch of that corn
[36:06] whiskey that night these men with Daddy
[36:09] up at the house and I was crying and all
[36:12] at once I heard something making a noise
[36:15] like a whirlwind something like this I
[36:18] hope it isn't too loud
[36:22] going just a noise like that well it was
[36:25] awful quiet and I looked around and you
[36:29] know what a little Whirlwind I believe
[36:30] you call them little Cyclones in the
[36:32] fall of the year they pick up through
[36:34] the corn field you know the leaves and
[36:36] so forth in the Autumn there the leaves
[36:38] had just began turning and I was under a
[36:40] great white popular tree stood about
[36:42] halfway between the barn and the the
[36:45] house and I heard that noise and I
[36:48] looked around it just as quiet as it is
[36:50] in this room not a leaf flowing nowhere
[36:52] nothing and I thought where's that noise
[36:55] coming from well I thought must be away
[36:59] from here just a lad and it got louder
[37:01] and louder I picked up my little buckets
[37:04] and squalled a couple more times and
[37:06] started up the lane I was resting and I
[37:08] got just a few feet from that out from
[37:11] under the branches of this big tree oh
[37:14] my it made a whirl sounding and I turned
[37:17] to look and about halfway up that tree
[37:20] was another Whirlwind caught in that
[37:22] tree just to going around and around
[37:25] moving those leaves well I thought
[37:27] nothing strange about that because it
[37:29] just in that time of year and the Autumn
[37:33] why those whirl winds come little we
[37:35] call them whal winds and they uh and
[37:38] they pick up dust you see them on the
[37:40] desert like that same thing so I watched
[37:43] but it didn't leave off usually it's
[37:44] just a puff for a moment then it goes
[37:46] but it had already been in there 2
[37:48] minutes or more well I started up the
[37:51] lane again and I turned to look at this
[37:53] again and when it did a human boss voice
[37:57] just as audible as mine is said don't
[38:00] you never
[38:02] drink smoke or defile your body in any
[38:06] way there will be a work for you to do
[38:08] when you get older why like this scared
[38:10] me to death you can imagine how a little
[38:13] fell fell I dropped those buckets and
[38:16] home I went just as hard as I could go
[38:18] scream in the top my voice and there was
[38:21] copperheads in that country snakes and
[38:23] they're very poison mother thought
[38:26] coming alongside the garden I'd perhaps
[38:28] got my foot on a copper head and she ran
[38:31] to meet me and I jumped up in her arms
[38:33] screaming hugging her and kissing her
[38:35] and she said what's the matter did you
[38:37] get snake bit look me all over I said no
[38:38] mama there's a man in that tree down
[38:40] there and she said Oh Billy Billy come
[38:43] on and she said did you stop and go to
[38:46] sleep I said no ma'am there's a man in
[38:48] that tree and he told me not to drink
[38:50] and not the Smoke Drink whiskies and and
[38:54] things and I was packing water to a
[38:55] moonshine still still right then and he
[38:58] said don't you never drink or defile
[39:00] your body in anyway that's immoral you
[39:02] know and my child Young Manhood with
[39:05] women and to
[39:07] my best I have never one time been
[39:13] guilty of such the Lord help me with
[39:15] those things and as you go along you'll
[39:17] find out so then don't drink or don't
[39:22] smoke or do not defile your body for
[39:25] there will be a work for you to do when
[39:26] you get older well I told that to Mama
[39:30] and she just laughed at me and I was
[39:31] just hysterically she called the doctor
[39:34] and the doctor said well he's just
[39:35] nervous that's all so she put me to bed
[39:38] and I never from that day to this ever
[39:42] passed by that tree again I was scared I
[39:44] go down the other side of the garden
[39:46] because I thought there was a man up in
[39:48] that tree and he was talking to me great
[39:51] deep voice that spoke and uh then
[39:55] sometime about
[39:56] a month after that I was playing Marvels
[40:00] out with my little brothers out in the
[40:02] front yard and all at once I had a
[40:04] strange feeling come on me and I stopped
[40:07] and sat down the side of the tree and we
[40:09] were right up on the bank from the Ohio
[40:10] river and I looked down towards
[40:13] Jeffersonville and I seen a bridge rise
[40:15] up and go across that of the river span
[40:17] the river and I seen 16 men I count them
[40:20] had dropped off of there and lost their
[40:22] lives on that bridge I run in real quick
[40:25] and told my mother
[40:27] and she thought I went to sleep but they
[40:29] kept it in mind and 22 years some then
[40:33] the municipal bridge now many of you
[40:35] cross when you cross there crossed the
[40:37] river at the same place and 16 men lost
[40:41] their life building that bridge across
[40:42] the river it's never failed to be
[40:46] perfectly true as you see it here in the
[40:48] auditorium it's been that way all the
[40:50] time now they thought I was just a
[40:53] nervous which I am a nervous person
[40:55] that's true
[40:57] and if you ever notice people who are
[41:00] are inclined to be spiritual are nervous
[41:04] look at poets and Prophets and look at
[41:07] William keer who wrote that famous song
[41:10] There is a fountain filled with blood
[41:11] drawn from Emmanuel's veins did you ever
[41:13] you know the song I stood by his grave
[41:15] not long ago brother Julius I believe I
[41:17] know no yes that's right was with us
[41:19] over there and his grave and and there
[41:22] after he had wrote that song the
[41:23] inspiration left him he tried to find
[41:26] the uh the river to commit suicide see
[41:30] the spirit left him and people like uh
[41:37] uh poets and authors and are not uh I
[41:41] mean prophets look at Elijah when he
[41:43] stood on the mountain and called fire
[41:45] out of the heaven and called rain out of
[41:47] the heaven then when the spirit left him
[41:48] he run at a threat of a woman and God
[41:50] found him pulled back in a cave 40 Days
[41:53] Later look at Jonah with enough
[41:55] inspiration when the Lord had anointed
[41:57] him to preach there in Nineveh to a a
[42:00] city with the size of St Louis repented
[42:03] with sackcloth and then when the spirit
[42:05] left him what happened to him we find
[42:08] him up on the mountain after the spirit
[42:09] left him praying to God to take his life
[42:12] and uh you see it's
[42:14] inspiration and when these things happen
[42:17] it it does something to you then I
[42:19] remember coming on up I got to be a
[42:21] young man I'll hurry to make it within
[42:24] the next little bit when I
[42:26] got to be a young man I had ideas like
[42:30] all young men I going to school I found
[42:34] I'm little girls you know I was real
[42:35] bashful you know and I I finally got me
[42:38] a little girlfriend and U like all
[42:41] little boys about 15 years old I guess
[42:44] and and so uh oh she was pretty my she
[42:49] had eyes like a dove and she had teeth
[42:51] like Pearl and neck like a swan and she
[42:54] she was really pretty and another little
[42:57] boy he uh we were buddies so he got his
[43:00] daddy's old Model T Ford and we got a
[43:02] date with our girls we was going to take
[43:04] them out riding we got enough about two
[43:06] gallons of gasoline we had to Jack the
[43:09] back wheel up to crank it I don't know
[43:10] where you ever remember that or not you
[43:12] know to crank it but we we going along
[43:14] pretty good and so I had a few Nickel in
[43:17] my pocket and we stopped at a little
[43:19] place and got you could get a ham
[43:21] sandwich for nickel and so oh I was rich
[43:25] I could by four of them see and after
[43:28] we'd eat the sandwiches and drink the
[43:30] coke I started taking the bottles back
[43:33] into my surprise when I come
[43:36] out women had just start falling from
[43:39] Grace at that time for from Womanhood my
[43:42] little Dove was smoking a
[43:45] cigarette well I've always had my
[43:48] opinion of a woman that would smoke a
[43:50] cigarette and I haven't changed it one
[43:52] bit from that time on that's right it's
[43:54] the lowest thing she can do
[43:56] that's exactly right
[44:00] and I now the cigarette company could
[44:03] get after me for this but I'm telling
[44:06] you that's just a stunt of the devil
[44:09] it's a biggest killer in sabotage this
[44:12] nation's God I'd rather my boy be a
[44:15] drunker than to be a cigarette smoker
[44:18] that's the truth I'd rather see my wife
[44:20] laying on the floor drunk and a see her
[44:22] with a cigarette that's how now this
[44:25] spirit of God
[44:26] that's with me if that is the spirit of
[44:30] God is you my question you smoking
[44:33] cigarettes is got a slim chance when you
[44:35] get there because that just every time
[44:38] you notice it on the platform how he
[44:39] condemns it it's a horrible thing keep
[44:42] away from it ladies if you have been
[44:44] guilty of that pleas in the Name of
[44:47] Christ get away from it it breaks you
[44:50] it'll kill you it it's a it's a cancer
[44:53] by the carloads the doctors try to warn
[44:57] and then how they can sell you that
[44:59] stuff if you go down to the drugstore
[45:01] and say buy I want to buy 50 cents worth
[45:03] of cancer why they come lock them up but
[45:06] when you buy 50 cents worth of
[45:07] cigarettes you're buying the same thing
[45:10] doctors say so oh this money mad Nation
[45:16] it's too bad it's a killer it's been
[45:19] proved well when I seen that pretty
[45:22] little girl just acting smart this
[45:25] cigarette in
[45:26] uh Han that like to kill me cuz I really
[45:29] thought I loved her and I thought well
[45:33] I'm called a woman hater you know that
[45:35] because I'm always kind of against women
[45:37] but not against you sisters I'm just
[45:40] against the way modern women act that's
[45:43] right good women should be packed long
[45:45] but I can remember when my father's
[45:47] still up there running I'd had to be out
[45:49] there with water and stuff see young
[45:51] ladies that wasn't over 17 18 years old
[45:54] up there with man my age now drunk and
[45:57] they'd have to sober him up and give
[45:58] them black coffee to get home to cook
[46:00] their husband's supper oh something like
[46:04] that I said this was my remark then
[46:06] they're not worth a good clean bullet to
[46:07] kill them with it that's right and I
[46:09] hated women that's right and I just have
[46:12] to watch every move now to keep from
[46:14] still thinking the same thing so but now
[46:17] a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[46:20] she should be honored she's my mother's
[46:23] a woman my wife is and there lovely and
[46:26] I've got thousands of Christian sisters
[46:29] who I highly respect but if if they can
[46:31] respect what God made them a motherhood
[46:34] and a real queen that's all right she's
[46:38] one of the best things that God could
[46:39] give a man was a wife besides salvation
[46:42] a wife is the best thing if she is a
[46:44] good wife but if she isn't Solomon said
[46:47] a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[46:50] but a a honory one or no good one is
[46:53] water in his blood and that's that's the
[46:56] worst thing could happen so a good woman
[46:59] if you've got a good wife brother you
[47:01] ought to respect her with the highest
[47:03] that's right you should do that a real
[47:06] woman and children if you've got a real
[47:08] mother that stays home and tries to take
[47:10] care of you keeping your clothes clean
[47:12] send you to school teaching you about
[47:14] Jesus you should honor that sweet old
[47:16] mother with all that's in you you should
[47:18] respect that woman yes sir because she's
[47:21] a real mother they talk about the
[47:23] illiteracy of Kentucky Mountain you sit
[47:26] this your dog patched St some of them
[47:28] old mammies out there could come here to
[47:31] Hollywood and teach you modern mothers
[47:33] how to raise your kids you let her kid
[47:35] come in one night with her hair all
[47:37] messed up and lips lips what do you call
[47:40] it makeup stuff they put on their face
[47:42] and her dress all squeezed to one side
[47:45] and been out all night drunk brother
[47:47] should get one of the limbs off the top
[47:49] of that hickory tree and she'll never go
[47:50] out no more I'm tell she if you had a
[47:53] little more of that You' have a better
[47:54] Hollywood around here you're in a better
[47:56] Nation that's right it's
[47:59] true just try to be modern that that's
[48:02] one of the tricks of the
[48:04] devil now this little girl when I looked
[48:08] at her my heart just bled and I thought
[48:10] poor little fell and she said oh you
[48:13] want a cigarette
[48:14] Billy I said no ma' I said I don't smoke
[48:19] she said now you said you didn't dance

[48:35] I said well I like to fish I like to
[48:38] hunt that didn't interest her so she
[48:43] said take this cigarette and I said no

[49:23] stand that so I said give it to me I
[49:27] hand I said I sure where I'm or
[49:28] not got that cigarette out and started
[49:31] to strike the match I know you're now
[49:34] I'm not responsible for what you think
[49:36] I'm just responsible for telling the
[49:38] truth when I start to strike that
[49:40] cigarette just as much determined to
[49:42] smoke it as I am to pick up this
[49:45] Bible I heard something
[49:51] going I tried again I couldn't get it to
[49:53] my mouth I got to cry and I throw R the
[49:55] thing down and they got to laughing at
[49:57] me and I walked home went up through the
[49:59] fields sat down out there crying and and
[50:03] it was a terrible life remember one day
[50:05] dad was going down the river the boys my
[50:07] brother and I we had to take a boat and
[50:08] go up and down the river hunting bottles
[50:10] to put the whiskey in we got a nickel a
[50:13] dozen for him to pick him up along the
[50:15] river and dad was with me and he had one
[50:18] of these little flat I believe about a
[50:19] half pint bottles and there a tree had
[50:21] blowed down and dad this man was with
[50:23] him Mr darn Bush I had his he had a nice
[50:26] boat and I wanted to find favor with him
[50:28] because I wanted to use that boat it had
[50:29] a good Rudder mine didn't have no Rudder
[50:30] at all we had this old boards to paddle
[50:33] with if he'd let me use that boat so he
[50:36] done welding and he made the Stills for
[50:38] Dad so uh he they throw their leg up
[50:40] across that tree and Dad reached in his
[50:42] back pocket and pulled out a little flat
[50:44] bottle of whiskey hand it to him and he
[50:46] took a drink hand it back to Dad and he
[50:49] taking a drink he set it down on a
[50:50] little sucker on the side of the tree
[50:52] that went out and Mr darn Bush picked it
[50:55] up said said here you are Billy I said
[50:57] thank you I don't drink he said a
[51:00] Brandon and don't drink everyone died
[51:03] with their boots on nearly and he said
[51:05] uh brandom and don't drink I said no sir
[51:08] no dad said I raise one
[51:10] sithy my daddy calling me a I said
[51:15] hand me that bottle I pull that stopper
[51:18] out of the top of it determined to drink
[51:20] it when I started turn it
[51:21] [Music]
[51:24] up
[51:26] I hand the bottle back and took off down
[51:28] through the field as hard as I could
[51:30] crying something wouldn't let me do
[51:33] it see I could not say well I was any
[51:37] good I was determined to do it but it's
[51:41] God
[51:42] grace Amazing
[51:45] Grace that kept me from doing those
[51:48] things I wanted to do it myself but he
[51:51] just wouldn't let me do
[51:54] it later on I found a girl when I was
[51:57] about 22 years old she was a
[52:00] darling she was a girl that went to
[52:02] church German Lutheran her name was brag
[52:06] b r u m b a c h come from the name of
[52:08] Bram
[52:09] ball and she was a nice girl she didn't
[52:12] smoke or drink or or she didn't uh dance
[52:16] or anything a nice girl I went with her
[52:19] for a little while and I'd then about 22
[52:23] I'd made enough money to I bought me an
[52:24] old Lord and uh I we'd go out on dates
[52:28] together and so that time there was no
[52:30] Lutheran Church close they moved from
[52:32] Howard Park up there and so there was a
[52:34] minister the one that arain me in the
[52:37] Missionary Baptist Church Dr Roy Davis
[52:40] sister Upshaw the very one that sent the
[52:42] brother Upshaw over to me or talked to
[52:44] him about me Dr Roy Davis and um so he
[52:49] was preaching and had the First Baptist
[52:51] Church or the U the uh I don't believe
[52:54] it was the first Baptist BST church
[52:55] either it was a Miss called the
[52:57] Missionary Baptist Church at
[52:58] Jeffersonville and he was preaching at
[53:00] the place at that time and we would go
[53:02] to church at night so and we' come back
[53:05] and I never did join church but I just
[53:08] like to go with her because the main
[53:11] thought was going with her I just might
[53:13] as well be honest so then uh going with
[53:16] her and one day she is out of a nice
[53:18] family and I begin to think you know you
[53:22] know I oughtn't take that girl's time it
[53:24] isn't it is isn't right because she's a
[53:26] nice girl and I'm poor and and I my
[53:30] daddy had broke down in health and I
[53:33] there was no way for me to make a living
[53:37] for a girl like that who had been used
[53:39] to a nice home and rugs on the floor I
[53:42] remember the first rug I ever seen I
[53:44] didn't know what it was I walked around
[53:46] the side I thought it the prettiest
[53:47] thing I ever seen in my life how would
[53:49] they put something like that on the
[53:50] floor it was the first rug I'd ever seen
[53:53] it was this one of these I believe it's
[53:55] called called matting rugs I may have
[53:56] had that wrong some gu like wicker or
[53:58] something is laced together and laying
[54:00] on the floor pretty green and red and
[54:02] big rolls worked in the middle of it you
[54:04] know it was a pretty thing and so um I
[54:07] remember uh I made up my mind that I
[54:10] either had to ask her to marry me or I
[54:14] must get away and let some good man
[54:16] marry her somebody that would be good to
[54:18] her could make her a living and could be
[54:20] kind to her I could be kind to her but I
[54:24] I I was only 20 cents an hour so I
[54:27] couldn't make too much of a living for
[54:29] and I with all the family we had to take
[54:31] care of and dad broke down in health and
[54:34] I had to take care of all them so I was
[54:37] having a pretty rough time so I thought
[54:41] well only thing for me to do is tell her
[54:43] that I I she I I just won't be back
[54:46] because I thought too much of her to
[54:48] Wreck her life and to let her fool along
[54:51] with me and then I thought if somebody
[54:54] could get a hold of her and marry her
[54:55] make a lovely home and maybe if I
[54:57] couldn't have her I could I could know
[55:00] that she was happy and
[55:03] so I thought but I I just I just can't
[55:06] give her up and I I was in an awful
[55:10] shape and day after day I'd think about
[55:12] it so I was too bashful to ask her to
[55:17] marry me every night I make up my mind
[55:19] I'm going to ask her and what is that
[55:22] butterflies or something you get in your
[55:24] all you Brethren out there probably had
[55:26] the same experience along that and a
[55:28] real funny feeling my face would get hot
[55:31] I didn't know I couldn't ask her so I
[55:34] guess you wonder how I ever got
[55:37] married you know what I wrote her a
[55:39] letter and ask her and
[55:41] so uh now it wasn't Dear Miss it was a
[55:45] little more you know on the love side
[55:46] than that it was just not a an agreement
[55:49] it was I I wrote it up best I could and
[55:52] I was a little afraid of her mother her
[55:55] mother was she was kind of rough and uh
[55:58] but her father was a gentle old Dutchman
[56:00] just a fine old fell he was the
[56:03] organizer of the Brotherhood of the
[56:05] Treman on the railroad making about $500
[56:09] a month and damn times and me making 20
[56:11] cents an hour to Mary's daughter I know
[56:14] that would never work and her mother was
[56:17] very she's a nice lady and she uh she
[56:21] was kind of one of these high societies
[56:23] you know and prissy like you know
[56:25] so she didn't have much use for me
[56:27] anyhow I was just an old plain SAS for
[56:30] ass country boy and she thought hope
[56:33] ought to go with a little better classy
[56:34] boy and I I think she was right and so
[56:37] um but I didn't think it then so I
[56:41] thought well I don't know how I can't
[56:43] ask your daddy and I'm sure I'm not
[56:45] going to ask your mother and so I got to
[56:47] ask her first so I wrote me a letter
[56:50] that morning on the road to work I
[56:51] dropped it in the mailbox the mail we
[56:53] was going to church Wednesday night and
[56:55] as on Monday morning I tried all day
[56:57] Sunday to tell her that I wanted to get
[56:59] married and I just couldn't get up
[57:00] enough nerve so then I dropped it in the
[57:02] mail box and all at work that day I
[57:04] happened to think what if her mother got
[57:06] a hold that letter
[57:08] oh my then I know I was ruined if if she
[57:12] ever got a hold of
[57:13] it because she didn't care too much
[57:16] about me well I was just sweating it out
[57:18] and that Wednesday night when I come oh
[57:21] my I thought how am I going to go up
[57:23] there if her mother got a hold of that
[57:24] letter she'll really work me over so I
[57:28] hope she got it I dressed it to hope
[57:30] that was her name hope and so I said
[57:33] I'll just ride out here to Hope and so
[57:35] and I thought maybe she might have not
[57:36] have got a hold of it so I know better
[57:39] than to stop outside and blow the horn
[57:41] for her to come out oh my and any boy
[57:44] that hasn't gotten nerve enough to walk
[57:46] up to the house and knock on the door
[57:48] and ask for the girl ain't got no
[57:49] business being out with her anyhow it's
[57:51] exactly right that's so silly that's
[57:54] cheap
[57:55] and so I stopped my old forge you know
[57:57] and I had it all shined up so I went up
[58:01] and knocked at the door mercy your
[58:03] mother come the door I couldn't hardly
[58:05] catch but I said H how do you do Miss
[58:10] from she said how do you do
[58:13] William I oh
[58:17] William and uh and she said will you
[58:20] step in I said thank you I stepped in
[58:24] inside the door I said is uh
[58:28] uh hope just about ready and just then
[58:32] here come hope skipping through the
[58:33] house just a girl at
[58:35] 16 and uh she said hi Billy I said hi
[58:39] hope I said you about ready for church
[58:42] said just in a minute I thought oh my
[58:44] she never got it she never got it good
[58:46] good good hope never got it either so
[58:48] it'll be all right cuz she have named it
[58:50] to me so I felt pretty fair and then
[58:52] when I got out of church I happened to
[58:55] think what if she did get it see I
[58:59] couldn't hear what Dr Davis is saying I
[59:01] look over at her and I thought if maybe
[59:03] she's just holding it back and she's
[59:05] really going to tell me off when I get
[59:06] out of here for asking her that and I
[59:09] couldn't hear what Brother Davis was
[59:10] saying uh and I look over at her and I
[59:12] thought my I hate to give her up but and
[59:15] I I The Showdown sure to come so after
[59:18] church we started walking down the
[59:19] street together going home and and um so
[59:23] we walked to the old Lord and it's all
[59:26] along the Moon is shining bright soon I
[59:28] look over and she's pretty boy I look at
[59:30] her I thought my how I would like to
[59:32] have her but guess I can and so I walk
[59:35] on a little further you know and I look
[59:36] up at her again I said H how you feeling
[59:39] tonight she said oh I'm all
[59:43] right and we stopped the old fort down
[59:45] we start to get out snow around sidewalk
[59:48] around the corner go to her house and I
[59:50] was walking up to the door with her I
[59:52] thought you know she she probably um
[59:55] never got the letter so I just might as
[59:57] well forget it I'll have another week of
[59:59] Grace anyhow so I got feeling pretty
[1:00:01] good she said uh Billy I said yeah she

[1:04:51] went out to Sears and roll bus and got a
[1:04:53] little uh
[1:04:54] table with four chairs and it U it
[1:04:59] wasn't painted you know and we got that
[1:05:01] on time and so then I went over to Mr
[1:05:04] Weber a junk dealer and bought a cooking
[1:05:06] stove I paid. 75 cents for it and a
[1:05:09] dollar and something for grates to go in
[1:05:11] we set up housekeeping I remember taking
[1:05:13] a painting a shamrock on the chairs when
[1:05:15] I paint him and oh we were happy we had
[1:05:19] one another so that's all
[1:05:21] necessary God by his Mercy and his
[1:05:24] goodness where the happiest Little
[1:05:26] Couple could be on the earth I found
[1:05:29] this that happiness does not consist of
[1:05:32] how much of the world's good you own but
[1:05:34] how contented you are with a potion
[1:05:36] that's lotted to
[1:05:38] you and after a while God came down and
[1:05:42] blessed our little home we had a little
[1:05:45] boy his name is Billy Paul it's in the
[1:05:49] service right now
[1:05:50] here and uh a little later from that
[1:05:53] about 11 months he blessed us again with
[1:05:56] a little girl called Sharon Rose taken
[1:06:00] from the word of the Rose of
[1:06:03] Sharon and I remember one day I had
[1:06:07] saved up my money and I was going to
[1:06:09] take a little vacation going up to a
[1:06:12] place Papa Lake to fish and on my road
[1:06:17] back and doing this time I'm leaving out
[1:06:19] my conversion I was converted and was
[1:06:21] ordained by Dr Roy Davis and the
[1:06:24] Missionary Baptist Church and had become
[1:06:26] a minister and had the Tabernacle that I
[1:06:29] now preach in in
[1:06:31] Jeffersonville and um I was pastoring
[1:06:34] the little church and I no money I
[1:06:36] pastored the church 17 years and never
[1:06:39] got one penny I didn't believe in take
[1:06:42] there wasn't even an offering plate in
[1:06:43] it and what tithings I had from work and
[1:06:46] so forth had a little box on the back of
[1:06:48] the building said little sign on it in
[1:06:51] so much as you have done the least of
[1:06:52] these my little ones you have did it
[1:06:54] unto me and then that's how the church
[1:06:57] was paid for we had 10 years loan to pay
[1:07:01] it and was paid off less than two years
[1:07:04] and I never took an offering of no kind
[1:07:07] and then I had few dollars I saved up
[1:07:10] for my vacation she worked too at fine
[1:07:14] shirt factory a lovely darling girl and
[1:07:19] her grave is probably snowy
[1:07:21] today but she's still in my heart
[1:07:25] and I remember when she worked so hard
[1:07:28] to help me to have enough money to go up
[1:07:31] to this Lake to fish and when I was
[1:07:34] coming back from the lake I begin to see
[1:07:36] coming into Mishawaka South bin
[1:07:40] Indiana and I began to notice cars that
[1:07:43] had signs on the back said Jesus
[1:07:46] only and I thought that sounds strange
[1:07:48] Jesus only and I begin noticing those
[1:07:51] signs and his own anywhere from bicycles
[1:07:54] Fords Cadillacs and what more Jesus only
[1:07:58] and I followed some of them down and to
[1:08:01] come to a great big church and I found
[1:08:03] out they were Pentecostal I'd heard of
[1:08:06] Pentecostal but they were a bunch of
[1:08:08] Holy Rollers they laid on the floor and
[1:08:10] froed their mouth and everything that
[1:08:13] they told me about so I didn't want
[1:08:15] nothing to do with it so I heard them
[1:08:17] all carrying on in there and I thought
[1:08:19] believe I'll just walk in so I stopped
[1:08:22] my Ford and walk walked in and all the
[1:08:25] singing you ever heard in your life and
[1:08:28] I come to find out there were two great
[1:08:30] churches one of them called a PA of JC
[1:08:33] and the PA of w many of you people might
[1:08:35] remember those old Argan I think they're
[1:08:37] United call now I called the United
[1:08:39] Pentecostal Church well I listen to some
[1:08:43] of their teachers they were standing
[1:08:45] there oh they were teaching about Jesus
[1:08:47] and how great he was and how great
[1:08:50] everything was and about a baptism of
[1:08:52] the Holy Ghost I thought what are they
[1:08:54] talking about and after a while somebody
[1:08:57] jumped up and started speaking with
[1:08:59] tongues well I never heard anything like
[1:09:01] that in my life and here comes some
[1:09:04] woman up through there running just as
[1:09:06] hard as she could then all of them got
[1:09:07] up and started running I thought well
[1:09:10] brother they sure ain't got no church
[1:09:11] manners screaming and shouting and
[1:09:15] carrying on I thought what a bunch this
[1:09:17] is but you know something about it
[1:09:20] longer I sit there the better I liked it
[1:09:24] there was something seemed to be real
[1:09:26] good and I began to watch him and it
[1:09:28] went on I thought I'll just bear with
[1:09:29] him a while cuz I I'm close the door if
[1:09:32] anything starts just rational I'll run
[1:09:34] out the door I know where my car is
[1:09:36] parked just around the corner and I
[1:09:38] begin to hear some of them preachers as
[1:09:40] Scholars and students well I thought
[1:09:42] that's fine so it comes supper time and
[1:09:45] said everybody come to supper but I
[1:09:47] thought wait a minute I got $1.75 to go
[1:09:50] home and I that's all I had for gasoline
[1:09:53] money just taking that to take me home I
[1:09:55] had my old Ford it was a pretty good old
[1:09:57] Ford it wasn't backslid it just like
[1:09:59] this one out here just wore out and it I
[1:10:02] actually believe that Ford would go 30 m
[1:10:04] an hour but of course that was 15 this
[1:10:07] way and 15 this way you see but it
[1:10:09] together you had 30 and so it um I
[1:10:13] thought well that night I think I would
[1:10:15] go out and after the I stayed for the
[1:10:17] night service and all he said all of the
[1:10:20] preachers regardless of denomination
[1:10:22] come to the plat on well there's about
[1:10:25] 200 of us up there I went up and so he
[1:10:28] said now we haven't got time for y'all
[1:10:29] to preach he said just walk by and say
[1:10:32] who you are and where you from well it
[1:10:34] come my time I said William brandom
[1:10:36] Baptist Jeffersonville Indiana walk by I
[1:10:39] hear all the rest of them calling
[1:10:41] themselves Pentecostal Pentecostal
[1:10:42] Pentecostal PFW PC PW I walked by I
[1:10:47] thought well I guess I'm the ugly
[1:10:48] ducklin so I sat down waited and that
[1:10:51] day they had fine young preachers out
[1:10:53] there and they preached powerfully and
[1:10:56] then they said the ones going to bring
[1:10:57] the message tonight is I believe they
[1:10:58] called him Elder and the ministers
[1:11:01] instead of Reverend it was Elder they
[1:11:03] brought an old colored man out there he
[1:11:05] had one of these oldfashioned preachers
[1:11:07] coats I don't guess you ever seen one
[1:11:10] long pigeon tail in the back you know
[1:11:12] with a velvet collar and he had just a
[1:11:14] little white rim of hair around his head
[1:11:16] poor old fell cannot like this you know
[1:11:18] what he stood there and he turned around
[1:11:20] and where all the preachers have been
[1:11:22] preaching about Jesus and the great how
[1:11:24] great he was and so forth that old man
[1:11:26] took his text from over in job where was
[1:11:29] you when I laid the foundation of the
[1:11:31] world or when the morning Stars sang
[1:11:33] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:11:35] Joy the poor old fell I thought why did
[1:11:36] they put some of them young fellas up
[1:11:38] there to preach great the places packed
[1:11:40] in jam and I thought why didn't they do
[1:11:42] that so then uh this old fell instead of
[1:11:45] preaching what was going on down here on
[1:11:47] Earth he begin to preach what was going
[1:11:49] on in the heaven all the time well he Tu
[1:11:51] him up at the beginning at the beginning
[1:11:53] of time and brought him back in the
[1:11:55] second coming down the horizontal
[1:11:57] rainbow I never heard such preaching in
[1:11:59] my life about that time the spirit hit
[1:12:01] him he jumped about that high and
[1:12:02] clicked his heels together thrown his
[1:12:04] shoulders back went tipping off that
[1:12:05] platform said you haven't got room
[1:12:07] enough up here for me to preach and he
[1:12:08] had more room than I got
[1:12:10] here I thought if that'll make an old
[1:12:13] man act like that what would he do if he
[1:12:14] got on me I don't know maybe I need some
[1:12:18] of that while he come out there I felt
[1:12:20] so sorry for the old fell but when he
[1:12:22] left I was feeling sorry for myself
[1:12:24] and I looked at him go off there I went
[1:12:26] out that night and I thought now the
[1:12:29] next morning I'm not going to let nobody
[1:12:30] know where who I am so I went that night
[1:12:33] I pressed my trousers I took went out in

[1:20:07] of the worst a little
[1:20:09] later few years after the children come

[1:20:39] couldn't put her in there so we taken
[1:20:40] her out to the government where they had
[1:20:42] a room out there and so then they called
[1:20:44] me back out and I always lived on the
[1:20:47] river and caught a Boatman so I was
[1:20:49] trying to get the people rescue him from
[1:20:51] the flood and then I want they called me

[1:52:54] Yonder if they've never fulfilled their
[1:52:57] promise may they do it now
[1:53:18] Lord
[1:53:20] amen been a long time since I listened
[1:53:23] to
[1:53:25] that you know the message didn't come
[1:53:27] without a
[1:53:31] price and then our Salvation didn't come
[1:53:34] without a
[1:53:35] price this message didn't come without a
[1:53:38] price and we can't pack it without a
[1:53:41] price I thank God somebody was willing
[1:53:44] to pay the
[1:53:48] price
[1:53:55] man God wouldn't let that man go
[1:53:58] wrong because he loved that man but he
[1:54:01] wouldn't let that man go wrong cuz he
[1:54:02] loved
[1:54:09] me see how much God loves
[1:54:13] us I thank God I thank God for a man who
[1:54:18] would surrender himself
[1:54:21] wasn't easy and he didn't do it right
[1:54:23] wasn't wasn't going about it always the
[1:54:26] right way but God kept him lined up to
[1:54:29] protect that gift for me and
[1:54:34] you he learned he said the way of a
[1:54:36] transgressor is hard should have obeyed
[1:54:39] but the grace of God restored our
[1:54:41] brotherr the mercy of God would let him
[1:54:45] meet his wife in a dream to know that
[1:54:47] they're
[1:54:48] okay even in
[1:54:51] chastisement God is still tender and
[1:54:54] merciful even in correction he still
[1:54:57] loves
[1:55:02] us I can't wait to meet
[1:55:05] him when we get to the married supper of
[1:55:07] the
[1:55:08] Lamb I can't wait to say thank you for
[1:55:11] staying
[1:55:12] true he said Lord just let me be honest
[1:55:16] not asking for a flowy bed of ease when
[1:55:18] my Christ suffer
[1:55:20] but just keep me honest and keep me true
[1:55:23] how many of you want to pray the same
[1:55:25] thing Lord I I can't expect it to be
[1:55:27] easy it never was easy but Lord please
[1:55:30] help me to be
[1:55:32] true cuz without you we can't do it
[1:55:37] ourselves now you see what brother
[1:55:39] Brenham opened with the
[1:55:40] scripture here we have no continuing
[1:55:44] City but we seek one to
[1:55:48] come we must go beyond the camp and be
[1:55:52] joined to
[1:55:53] him just as we close can we turn to
[1:55:56] Hebrews 13
[1:56:15] together been many years I don't know
[1:56:17] how many years but many many years since
[1:56:19] I heard this
[1:56:21] testimony really it impacted me I
[1:56:23] remembered most of it maybe not all of
[1:56:25] it but it hit me with impact again
[1:56:27] tonight and I thank God for dropping in
[1:56:29] my heart to play
[1:56:32] it when you listen to
[1:56:35] that what's the point of fussing about
[1:56:37] the
[1:56:38] message what's the point of having our
[1:56:40] own ideas and fussing and striving and
[1:56:44] pushing and pulling what's the point
[1:56:47] what are we
[1:56:48] doing God wanted us to get the truth and
[1:56:51] God watched after that
[1:56:53] man and when he stepped to the side he
[1:56:56] corrected him so
[1:56:58] hard so
[1:57:01] hard so that he would stay true to the
[1:57:04] word so that we would have a pure
[1:57:07] message amen I thank
[1:57:10] God I thank
[1:57:12] God and all I want if God will help me I
[1:57:15] just want to be true I know I can't do
[1:57:18] it by myself
[1:57:20] I can't do it in My Own Strength I know
[1:57:22] I've failed a thousand times but oh if
[1:57:25] God will just help me I just want to be
[1:57:27] true true to the end and stay true to
[1:57:30] his word I want to follow the example
[1:57:33] that God gave us in his
[1:57:35] Prophet what an
[1:57:38] example what a life that we saw lived
[1:57:41] for Christ and he was honest about it he
[1:57:44] didn't tell us just the highlights he
[1:57:46] told us the good parts and the bad parts
[1:57:48] the successes and the mistakes told us
[1:57:50] where he went wrong and he told us what
[1:57:52] God did for him and he didn't take
[1:57:53] credit for anything he gave it all to
[1:57:55] God he took credit for his mistakes but
[1:57:57] not for any
[1:57:59] success what an example God gave us you
[1:58:02] know what I want more than anything I
[1:58:05] want to follow that example I want to
[1:58:08] walk in that same path I want God to
[1:58:11] help me be true be humble be sincere
[1:58:15] stay
[1:58:16] honest and I can't do it by myself I
[1:58:19] thank
[1:58:20] God that he loves us let's turn back to
[1:58:23] Hebrews 12 and I just want to look at
[1:58:25] this and I was just had this
[1:58:29] thought even about the correction that
[1:58:32] the prophet went through he was
[1:58:35] corrected he was wrong he disobeyed the
[1:58:37] Lord he listened to his mother-in-law
[1:58:39] and he suffered greatly for
[1:58:42] it but I don't think God ever quit
[1:58:44] loving
[1:58:46] him but and Hebrews chap 12 verse 1 says
[1:58:53] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:58:56] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:58:58] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:59:02] sin which do so easily beset us and let
[1:59:04] us run the race with patience let us
[1:59:07] with patience run the race that is set
[1:59:09] before us looking into Jesus the author
[1:59:12] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:59:14] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:59:16] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:59:19] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:59:23] God we have a great cloud of witnesses
[1:59:26] one of those Witnesses is our brother
[1:59:29] Brandon and seeing that we are compassed
[1:59:31] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:59:33] let us lay aside every weight in the sin
[1:59:36] that does so easily beset us and let us
[1:59:39] run with patience the race that is set
[1:59:41] before us and how do we run looking un
[1:59:44] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[1:59:48] faith
[1:59:49] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:59:51] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:59:53] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:59:55] Throne of God for consider him who hath
[1:59:58] endured such contradiction of
[2:00:00] Sinners against himself lest you be
[2:00:02] wearied and faint in your mind what's
[2:00:06] Paul saying Paul just got through with
[2:00:08] Hebrews chap 11 by faith Abraham by
[2:00:12] faith Sarah by faith Enoch by faith then
[2:00:16] he gets down to the end of this and he
[2:00:18] starts to say
[2:00:19] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[2:00:21] brought righteousness obtained promises
[2:00:23] stopped the mouth of line quenched the
[2:00:25] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[2:00:27] sword of weakness were made strong wax
[2:00:29] Valiant in fight turned to flight the
[2:00:31] armies of the aliens women received
[2:00:33] their dead raised the life again and
[2:00:35] others were tortured not having
[2:00:36] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[2:00:38] better resurrection and others had trial
[2:00:40] of cruel mockings and scorings yay
[2:00:43] moreover bonds and imprisonment they
[2:00:45] were stoned they were saw aunder were
[2:00:48] tempted were slain with the sword they
[2:00:50] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[2:00:52] skins being destitute Afflicted
[2:00:54] tormented of whom the world was not
[2:00:56] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[2:00:59] mountains and in dens of caves of the
[2:01:00] earth and these all having obtained a
[2:01:03] good report through faith receive not
[2:01:05] the promise God having provided some
[2:01:07] better thing for us that without us that
[2:01:11] they without us should not be made
[2:01:12] perfect right after he talks about the
[2:01:15] Affliction and the torment and the
[2:01:16] destitute and affliction and goat skins
[2:01:20] and he tells us seeing that you have
[2:01:23] this great company of witness went
[2:01:24] before lay aside the sin and the weight
[2:01:27] that so and let us run the race with
[2:01:30] patience look at the examples that we've
[2:01:32] had we surely can endure the little
[2:01:35] things we're enduring
[2:01:37] now then he goes verse three now let's
[2:01:40] go down here for consider him that
[2:01:42] endured such contradiction of Sinners
[2:01:44] against himself lest you be wearied and
[2:01:46] faint in your minds you have not resist
[2:01:49] resisted unto blood striving against
[2:01:51] sin and you have forgotten exhortation
[2:01:54] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[2:01:56] my son despise not thou the chastening
[2:01:58] of the Lord nor faint when thou are
[2:02:01] rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth
[2:02:03] he chasteneth and scores every son whom
[2:02:06] he
[2:02:07] receiveth there's an interesting
[2:02:09] transition that takes place in the
[2:02:11] scripture here it's
[2:02:14] fascinating said consider him Jesus
[2:02:18] verse three who endured such
[2:02:19] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[2:02:20] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[2:02:22] minds he said don't get weary resisting
[2:02:24] sin for you have not resisted unto blood
[2:02:27] striving against sin and you have
[2:02:30] forgotten the exhortation was speak unto
[2:02:32] you as into the children my son despise
[2:02:34] not the chastening of the Lord
[2:02:36] immediately he goes with us resisting
[2:02:38] sin and don't be weary keep pressing
[2:02:41] right to the chastening of the
[2:02:44] Lord what are we supposed to not get
[2:02:46] weary in we're supposed to not get weary
[2:02:49] and God bringing us back to the path
[2:02:51] correcting us when we go wrong chasing
[2:02:54] us why because he loves us he chastened
[2:02:58] the prophet cuz he loved
[2:03:01] him he says let's read now again in
[2:03:05] verse six for whom the Lord loveth he
[2:03:07] chasten and scourgeth every son whom he
[2:03:09] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[2:03:11] dealth with you as with sons for who for
[2:03:14] what son is he whom the father
[2:03:16] chasethe be without chastisement where
[2:03:19] of all our partakers then are you
[2:03:20] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[2:03:23] have had fathers of our flesh which
[2:03:25] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[2:03:27] shall we not much rather be in
[2:03:29] subjection unto the father of spirits
[2:03:30] and live for they verily for a few days
[2:03:33] chasen us after their own pleasure but
[2:03:35] he for our profit that we might be
[2:03:38] partakers of his Holiness now no
[2:03:40] chastening for the present seeth to be
[2:03:42] joyous but Grievious nevertheless
[2:03:45] afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit
[2:03:47] of righteousness unto them which are
[2:03:49] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[2:03:53] hands which hang down and the feeble
[2:03:55] knees and make straight paths for your
[2:03:58] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[2:04:00] out of the way but let it rather be
[2:04:04] healed telling us lift up your hands
[2:04:07] strengthen your knees walk on a straight
[2:04:10] even path unless that which is lame be
[2:04:13] turned unless your own limping drive you
[2:04:14] off but he says rather let it be healed
[2:04:19] said oh God let my limping be healed
[2:04:23] keep me on the straight path Lord if you
[2:04:26] you have to chasing me you've chasen me
[2:04:28] you had to chasen the prophet you chasen
[2:04:29] him but oh God that's your love for us
[2:04:32] that was your love for us to keep us
[2:04:34] where we needed to
[2:04:36] be thank God that the prophet was so
[2:04:39] honest about his life so thankful that
[2:04:44] he endured and he didn't give up he
[2:04:46] tried but God held him
[2:04:49] how many of how many of us would have
[2:04:51] already been gone if he didn't hold us
[2:04:53] and where would we be if he hadn't held
[2:04:55] us oh God let us not get weary let us
[2:04:59] lay aside every sin and waight that so
[2:05:01] easily be said us and let us run the
[2:05:03] race with patience looking into Jesus
[2:05:05] the author and finisher of our
[2:05:08] faith we are all we were all all of us
[2:05:13] depending on God keep keeping that
[2:05:16] man the question is
[2:05:19] who's depending on God keeping
[2:05:22] you wasn't just that
[2:05:24] man God's keeping us for the sake of
[2:05:27] somebody else and I say thank you God
[2:05:30] when I go to the right you bring me back
[2:05:32] when I go to the left you bring me back

[2:05:36] and I thank God that he was so good to
[2:05:41] us and I thank God for a man who would
[2:05:45] surrender and show us the way amen

[2:05:51] may never get it right in my lifetime
[2:05:53] but that's the way I want to
[2:05:56] live God help me all I can say is what

[2:10:07] errors you know it was so important that

[2:10:12] in this life it was so critical that God
[2:10:15] would chasen him and correct him and
[2:10:17] help him and encourage encourage him and
[2:10:19] gift him and teach him he would do all
[2:10:20] of that cuz it was so

[2:11:35] Christ in the end time will he break it
[2:11:38] yes will he smush it back down on the
[2:11:40] wheel yes and will it hurt yes but oh
