[13:22] and use us Lord to magnify and fulfill
[13:25] this word we love you God we ask that
[13:28] you would accomplish your will that you

[13:33] surrender to you that your spirit would

[13:52] before we love you and we ask God for
[13:54] these things that you would take control
[13:56] and speak to us in Jesus Christ's name
[13:59] we pray amen and God bless you we're
[14:03] going to ask you to take your Bibles
[14:05] while we're standing we just want to say
[14:07] Happy Father's Day to all the fathers
[14:10] amen God has certainly been good to us
[14:13] as we look around and see the families
[14:15] and and what God has done and what the
[14:18] word has done amen amen I I I realized
[14:22] several years ago when we came to the
[14:24] message that the message that was
[14:26] delivered to us changed my whole life it
[14:29] taught me to be a father it taught me to
[14:31] be a man it taught my wife to be a
[14:33] mother to be a real woman and and It
[14:35] produced the family that we have now it
[14:37] wasn't our efforts cuz we would have
[14:39] ruined everything it was the grace of
[14:41] God because he gave us of himself amen
[14:44] and I remember how uh when we came to
[14:47] the message all of our family was so
[14:49] worried about us because they we had
[14:51] gone off the deep and we had left what
[14:53] was traditionally true for our family
[14:55] for generations and and they were
[14:57] worried and we had got to a call and we
[14:59] were off and but I remember that it
[15:01] didn't take long after years they would
[15:03] always compliment the family and
[15:05] compliment our marriage and complement
[15:06] the relationship and compliment the kids
[15:08] and talk about how wonderful it was they
[15:10] love the Holiness they love the the
[15:12] family unit they love the relationship
[15:14] of mom and dad with kids and they didn't
[15:16] realize it was the thing they feared had
[15:18] produced what they
[15:20] loved amen and so when we look around
[15:22] and see families that are intact because
[15:24] of the grace of God we just say thank
[15:27] you Lord for your word may it keep keep
[15:29] changing us and keep uniting us and
[15:31] breaking every barrier that's still
[15:33] hindering these things in our life and
[15:35] may the word produce itself amen so we
[15:38] going to say God bless you fathers we
[15:40] thank God for you
[15:42] amen uh as we take our Bibles let's turn
[15:45] to Genesis chapter
[15:47] 1 and I heard sister Nancy marrow is
[15:50] here God bless you where you at sister
[15:51] Nancy God bless you Sister Nancy it's so
[15:54] good to see you so happy you're here and
[15:56] feeling good amen it's good to have her
[15:58] back she's been been absent for a little
[15:59] while and so God has certainly been good
[16:02] to
[16:02] her amen we know that many are traveling
[16:05] everybody most everybody with the yingst
[16:07] family has gone to Canada for the
[16:09] wedding of uh brother Jared a blast and
[16:11] so they're gone and it's also vacation
[16:14] season has started so many are gone so
[16:16] we wish them well may the Lord bless
[16:18] them as well but thank God that we're
[16:20] still here and he's and we're here to
[16:22] hear his word amen Genesis 1 and
[16:27] 26 Genesis chapter 1:
[16:30] 26 and God said let us make man in our
[16:33] image after our likeness and let them
[16:35] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[16:36] and over the foul of the air and over
[16:38] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[16:40] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[16:42] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[16:44] own image in the image of God created he
[16:46] him male and female created he them and
[16:50] God blessed them and God said unto them
[16:52] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[16:54] the Earth and subdue it and have
[16:57] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[16:59] the foul of the air and over every
[17:01] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[17:04] amen may God bless you as you take your
[17:06] seats and may God bless us as we look
[17:08] into his word amen I just want to
[17:11] welcome brother Emanuel God bless you
[17:13] brother Emanuel it's good to have you
[17:14] back in the service and good to have you
[17:16] there with your family amen I've asked
[17:18] brother Emanuel if he'll take the
[17:19] Wednesday night service so he's agreed
[17:21] he'll be preaching Lord willing this
[17:22] Wednesday and hopefully he can give us
[17:24] an update of some things that were
[17:26] accomplished and then Minister the word
[17:28] so if you can be praying for him I know
[17:30] he'll greatly appreciate
[17:32] that amen uh when we look here this is a
[17:35] very familiar passage of scripture but I
[17:38] want to I want to preach I want to
[17:41] capitalize on Father's Day because
[17:42] there's been something that's been
[17:43] stirring in my heart and uh I want to
[17:46] talk about bringing forth the Royal seed
[17:49] and um and if we can look here that God
[17:52] had had commanded them to multiply and
[17:55] replenish uh the Earth and subdue it and
[17:57] have dominion and Adam was given this
[18:00] commandment but then we go to chapter 2
[18:02] if you go with me to chapter 2:
[18:06] 18 it
[18:08] said uh Genesis 2:18 and the Lord God
[18:11] said it is not good that man shall be
[18:12] alone I will make him a help meat for
[18:15] him and out of the ground the Lord God
[18:17] formed every beast of the field and
[18:19] every foul of the air and brought them
[18:20] unto Adam to see what he would call them
[18:23] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[18:24] creature that was the name thereof and
[18:27] Adam gave names to all cat and the foul
[18:29] of the air and to every beast of the
[18:31] field but for Adam there was not found a
[18:33] help meat for him and the Lord God
[18:35] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[18:37] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[18:39] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[18:42] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[18:44] from man made he a woman and brought her
[18:46] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[18:49] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[18:51] she shall be called woman because she
[18:53] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[18:56] man leave his father his mother and
[18:58] shall cleave to his wife and they shall
[19:00] be one flesh so by the grace of God
[19:04] we've seen this so thoroughly explained
[19:07] by the prophet we've gone into this so
[19:09] many times but he begins to show us that
[19:12] God's foreshadow of his plan lays right
[19:14] here in the creation of Adam because
[19:16] Adam was a created Son of God Amen and
[19:19] and as a spoken word created Son of God
[19:22] he was given dominion over the whole
[19:23] earth and and God wanted him to multiply
[19:26] and replenish God's original intention
[19:28] would to have an earth inhabited with
[19:30] sons and daughters amen we know that sin
[19:33] entered in and brought a corruption and
[19:35] a perversion and it started the cycle of
[19:37] redemption which also plays into God's
[19:39] Great desire because one of God's
[19:41] greatest desires was to express himself
[19:44] and so to be known and expressed as
[19:46] Redeemer and healer and father and all
[19:48] of these attributes that were in him had
[19:50] to be expressed so the fall came in to
[19:53] set the backdrop to where he can begin
[19:56] the cycle of redemption and he can be
[19:57] known as the great healer and Redeemer
[20:00] and savior and all of these great
[20:02] attributes that were in him but we see
[20:04] originally when God Amen had put man on
[20:07] the earth his son the Son of God Adam
[20:10] the Son of God on the earth to rule and
[20:12] Reign Over the Earth amen he saw that it
[20:14] wasn't good that he should be alone so
[20:16] he made a help meat for him amen and and
[20:19] it's impossible to preach on Father's
[20:22] day without preaching about mothers
[20:24] because there's no you not a father
[20:27] unless there's a woman that you can make
[20:30] mother so the two go hand in hand they
[20:33] go together but but uh we just wanted to
[20:37] read this account to have this in us our
[20:38] minds because this is going to be God's
[20:40] original intention and uh and we find uh
[20:44] brother B says uh what is fatherhood he
[20:48] said it is an attribute of God so
[20:51] fatherhood is an attribute of God that's
[20:54] why we thank God for the fathers that
[20:55] are among us because they're expressing
[20:57] an attribute of God they're portraying
[20:59] to the world part of what is inside of
[21:02] God is now being reflected Amen in
[21:04] Christian fathers the same thing with
[21:06] christian mothers but he goes in in the
[21:09] message Christ is the mystery of God
[21:10] revealed he says but what he wanted to
[21:13] do he loved fatherhood for he was a
[21:16] father and the only way that he could
[21:18] express it was to become a son of man
[21:21] and that's the reason Jesus kept saying
[21:22] the son of man see they didn't know what
[21:24] he was talking about many of them but
[21:27] now you get it see he wanted to express
[21:29] himself that was his one of his great
[21:32] three-fold purposes was to express
[21:34] himself identify himself with human
[21:36] beings to reveal himself in Christ and
[21:39] so because he loved fatherhood because
[21:43] he was a father he wanted to be known as
[21:45] a father amen and so in order to be
[21:48] perfectly known as a father amen he had
[21:50] to become a son of man because now the
[21:52] son of man Jesus Christ was reflecting
[21:55] the fatherhood and referring back to the
[21:57] father and was the son and the son was
[22:00] the reflection of the father he was the
[22:02] visible of the
[22:04] invisible he was The Offspring or
[22:07] attribute and we know that he was the
[22:10] attribute that contained all the
[22:11] attributes of God was fully expressed he
[22:14] was the expressed image or the stamped
[22:16] likeness the exact uh uh uh reproduction
[22:20] in flesh of what the invisible God was
[22:23] now was molded into a flesh being and he
[22:25] was that exact image amen amen and so
[22:30] because he was a father-in Lov
[22:31] fatherhood he became a son so that he
[22:33] could express fatherhood amen but
[22:37] because he's also a husband he's going
[22:39] to need a wife amen amen and and then
[22:42] God is continually expressing himself
[22:45] then that was the first phase of his
[22:46] three-fold purpose then it says secondly
[22:49] to have preeminence in his body of
[22:50] Believers that is his bride that he
[22:53] might live in people so the first part
[22:55] was to be expressed as a father so he
[22:57] came as a son of man to get preeminence
[23:00] in flesh in a human being in Jesus
[23:03] Christ to express himself Amen to
[23:05] express fatherhood through the sunship
[23:08] amen and then next to get preeminence in
[23:10] a body of Believers a bride a people
[23:13] Amen to express himself as husband amen
[23:17] and
[23:18] wife
[23:20] amen so so when we go to the church age
[23:24] book we look at the pergam and church
[23:26] age we just covered this in the last uh
[23:28] Church age book bible study this past
[23:30] Thursday but I'm just going to read a
[23:32] section uh out of the pergan church age
[23:36] and it starts off with brother brandom
[23:37] explaining the background behind what
[23:39] we're going to read says one night as I
[23:41] was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit
[23:43] told me to pick up my pen and write as I
[23:45] grasped the pen to write his Spirit gave
[23:48] me a message for the church I want to
[23:50] bring it to you it has to do with the
[23:52] word and the bride so then here's the
[23:55] message this is the holy spirit giving a
[23:57] message through the prophet to the
[23:58] church so this is a message to
[24:01] us from the Holy Spirit here's what I'm
[24:05] trying to say to you the law of
[24:07] reproduction is that each species brings
[24:10] forth after its own kind even according
[24:12] to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the
[24:15] Earth bring forth grass and the herb
[24:17] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[24:18] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[24:21] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[24:23] so whatever life was in the seed came
[24:27] forth into a plant and then into Fruit
[24:30] the very same law applies to the church
[24:32] today whatever seed started the
[24:34] church will come forth and be like the
[24:37] Original Seed because it's the same seed
[24:40] in these last days the true bride Church
[24:43] Christ's seed so what is the true bride
[24:45] church it's Christ seed he's the
[24:48] Original Seed amen so it must come forth
[24:50] in the lik likeness of the Original Seed
[24:52] because every species must bring forth
[24:54] after its own crying so the cry seed
[24:56] must reproduce Christ again
[24:59] amen so the bride Church Christ seed
[25:02] will come to The Headstone and she will
[25:03] be a super Church a super race as she
[25:06] nears him they and the bride will be so
[25:08] much like him that they will even be in
[25:11] his very image praise God this is in
[25:15] order to be United with him they will be
[25:16] one they will be the very manifestation
[25:19] of the word of the Living God
[25:20] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[25:24] seed they will produce their Creeds and
[25:26] their dogmas mixed with the the word
[25:29] this mongrelize brings forth a hybrid
[25:32] product the first son Adam was the
[25:34] spoken seed word of God he was given a
[25:36] bride to reproduce himself that is why
[25:39] the bride was given to him so now why
[25:42] did Adam why did he receive a bride it's
[25:44] not good that he should dwell alone I
[25:45] will make a help meet for him that that
[25:47] brother brenham's now not brother
[25:49] Brenham the Holy Spirit now is telling
[25:50] us in the message to the church amen
[25:53] that he was Adam was given a
[25:55] bride uh so that he could reproduce
[25:58] himself amen amen so let's read that
[26:02] again he said the first son Adam was the
[26:05] spoken seed word of God he was given a
[26:08] bride to reproduce himself that is why
[26:11] the bride was given to him to reproduce
[26:13] himself to produce another Son of God
[26:16] but she fell she fell by hybridization
[26:19] she caused him to die so the very
[26:22] purpose when God looked down and said
[26:24] it's not good that man shall dwell alone
[26:26] I will make a help meat for him she was
[26:27] given to him so that he could reproduce
[26:30] himself upon the Earth again because he
[26:32] was a Son of God and God wanted an earth
[26:34] full of Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[26:38] and so that's that's what God wanted to
[26:40] do and that was her original purpose
[26:44] amen but when she received seed from
[26:46] another source and hybrid herself amen
[26:50] now she corrupted that original purpose
[26:53] and brought death instead of life and
[26:55] now instead of God's original intent and
[26:57] purpose the have the Earth inhabited
[26:59] with sons and daughters of God now it
[27:01] would be inhabited by more than that
[27:03] because now there would be another seed
[27:06] line introduced into the Earth and a
[27:08] mongrelize and a mixing and a
[27:10] hybridizing of the seed and so now the
[27:13] original plan amen now moves into the
[27:16] the that moves into the uh mystery
[27:20] plan where God can express
[27:23] himself
[27:25] amen then he goes on in this message
[27:29] from the Holy Spirit to the church he
[27:31] says the second son Jesus also a spoken
[27:35] seed word of God was given a bride like
[27:37] was was Adam but before he could marry
[27:40] her she also had fallen she like Adam's
[27:42] wife was put to the test whether she
[27:44] would believe the word of God and live
[27:46] or doubt the word and die she doubted
[27:48] she left the word she died so now we're
[27:51] speaking of the first church now as
[27:53] Christ came and laid down his life for
[27:55] the church a as he was pierced in his
[27:58] outflowed blood and water amen the
[28:00] ingredients to make the church and now
[28:02] the church sprung forth on the day of
[28:04] Pentecost amen but already in the first
[28:06] age she was a fallen woman because she
[28:09] had taken the pure word that was given
[28:11] amen through the apostles and she began
[28:13] to adapt it amen to her own thinking and
[28:15] receive seed from man so she did the
[28:17] same thing that Eve
[28:20] did she left the word she died but God's
[28:24] purpose is not defeated he goes on to
[28:26] say from a little group group of the
[28:29] true seed of the word God will present
[28:31] Christ with a beloved bride she is a
[28:34] virgin of his word she is Virgin because
[28:36] she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas
[28:39] buying through the members of the Bride
[28:41] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[28:44] of God to be made manifest in the Virgin
[28:47] The Word of Promise came to the Virgin
[28:49] Mary now he's saying what what now all
[28:53] will be fulfilled in what the end time
[28:56] bride amen from a little seed of the
[28:58] true word of God the bride God will
[29:01] raise up a bride for Christ and all will
[29:02] be fulfilled in her that was promised to
[29:05] the Virgin amen and so here's what he's
[29:07] going to type it with the Virgin Mary
[29:09] The Word of Promise come to the Virgin
[29:11] Mary but that Word of Promise was he
[29:15] himself so what was the promise that
[29:17] came to Mary The Word of Promise the
[29:20] prophecy that came to Mary was he
[29:23] himself came into Mary amen so that Mary
[29:26] could reproduce What men God in flesh
[29:29] amen Jesus
[29:32] Christ
[29:34] amen oh praise
[29:37] God but the Word of Promise was he
[29:39] himself to be made manifest God was made
[29:42] manifest he himself acted at that time
[29:44] and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in
[29:47] the Virgin it was an angel that had
[29:49] brought her the message but the Angel's
[29:52] message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6
[29:54] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[29:57] written of him because she accepted his
[29:59] word to
[30:01] her oh my goodness that what was the
[30:05] Word of Promise that came to Mary that
[30:07] was he himself the word came to Mary and
[30:09] the Word was he himself now that came to
[30:12] manifest himself through who through the
[30:15] Virgin now this little group of the true
[30:18] seed of the word will be presented to
[30:20] Christ a virgin bride so that all that
[30:22] was promised of the Virgin shall be
[30:24] fulfilled in her amen amen praise be to
[30:27] God
[30:29] so although it was the Angel's message
[30:31] it was the word of God you see the same
[30:33] thing repeated in our day it says the
[30:36] members of the Virgin bride will love
[30:38] him and they will have his potentials
[30:40] for he is their head and all power
[30:43] belongs to him they are subject to him
[30:45] as the members of our bodies are subject
[30:47] to our heads so this is becomes really
[30:51] an important and he goes on but I just
[30:53] want to take this little section and
[30:55] begin to talk about he goes on just
[30:58] before this when he talks about the word
[31:00] coming to the Virgin Mary which was he
[31:02] himself he said he acted at that time
[31:06] and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in
[31:08] the Virgin he acted it didn't say she
[31:12] acted he acted
[31:15] himself and fulfilled his own Word of
[31:18] Promise in the Virgin it was an angel
[31:20] that had brought her the message but the
[31:22] Angel's message with the word of God
[31:24] Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all
[31:27] that was was written of him because she
[31:29] accepted his word to her he listen he
[31:35] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[31:39] word he fulfilled at that time all that
[31:43] was written of him he did it she didn't
[31:45] do it the only thing that she did amen
[31:49] was accept his word to her all that she
[31:51] did was say be unto me according to the
[31:53] word all she did was lay down her life
[31:56] and surrender and say that ain't nothing
[31:58] but the truth let that be according to
[32:00] your word Let It Be according to me she
[32:02] didn't have the power to produce or do
[32:04] or manufacture or make anything happened
[32:06] she couldn't the only thing she could do
[32:08] is wait for the angel Messenger to come
[32:10] to her to tell her the mystery of her
[32:12] life amen in the secret of the timing of
[32:15] God's promise and then all she had to do
[32:17] was accept it and believe it and he
[32:19] fulfilled at that time his Word of
[32:21] Promise because she accepted his word
[32:24] God's going to be Christ is going to be
[32:26] presented with a virgin Bride of the
[32:27] world word and what is she going to need
[32:29] to do she's only going to need to do
[32:31] what the Virgin did to say be that unto
[32:33] me according to your word I can't
[32:35] produce it I can't be that she will be a
[32:37] super race a super seed we can't how are
[32:40] you going to become a super race how are
[32:41] you going to be the super seed how are
[32:43] you going to do the mighty works you
[32:45] can't do any of that in your own power
[32:47] and strength neither can you work it up
[32:49] or pump it up or use religious means the
[32:51] only thing that we can do is say that's
[32:53] nothing but the truth brother brandom I
[32:55] believe what you said to come from God I
[32:58] believe that this is the time and I
[32:59] believe I'm the
[33:02] one amen it's not a doing it's a
[33:06] surrendering sometimes in religion we
[33:08] get so things so backwards we think that
[33:10] God needs us to do some things amen God
[33:13] doesn't need us to do he supplies the
[33:15] power to do he needs us to yield to his
[33:18] headship he is the head we are the
[33:23] body praise be to
[33:26] God Amen amen and amen and
[33:29] amen
[33:31] So
[33:33] Adam was given a
[33:35] bride to reproduce himself on the
[33:39] earth Christ was given a bride for the
[33:42] same purpose but she fell but that bride
[33:45] will be restored because in the
[33:46] restoration of the Bride tree Amen
[33:49] brother bandam keeps going through this
[33:50] line over and over he says over and over
[33:52] the phrase I will restore I will restore
[33:55] I will restore who will restore the
[33:57] church isn't restoring herself he said I
[34:00] will restore all that the cankerworm all
[34:02] that the Locust all that the caterpillar
[34:05] all that they I will restore why because
[34:07] it's his word it's his prophecy it's his
[34:09] desire from before the foundation of the
[34:11] world to present Christ with a virgin
[34:13] brde so he's going to restore the bride
[34:15] tree amen so that she can produce the
[34:17] fruit amen amen so he needs her because
[34:22] he's willed it that way but she can do
[34:25] nothing in herself she must receive the
[34:27] head headship amen it doesn't matter
[34:30] listen how much a a woman wants to be a
[34:33] mother she can desire it she can crave
[34:35] it she can want it but she can never
[34:37] produce that on her own she needs the
[34:40] headship of the male she needs the seed
[34:42] that comes from the male amen she can
[34:44] beg for it desire it want it crave it
[34:47] dream about it talk about it but she has
[34:49] no power in herself to produce it amen
[34:52] she's going to have to lay down her life
[34:54] and surrender herself to the will of her
[34:56] husband and when she does she can
[34:58] receive the seed amen that will bring
[35:00] forth life and she can become a mother
[35:03] amen not by her works but by her
[35:05] husband's Works amen praise God the
[35:09] spiritual and the natural type one
[35:11] another so perfectly God's given brother
[35:13] B said my first Bible was
[35:16] nature amen so so there's no way to talk
[35:20] about fatherhood without talking about
[35:21] motherhood you can't talk about
[35:22] motherhood without talking about
[35:23] fatherhood and God Amen is a great
[35:25] father and all of this is reflecting
[35:29] him
[35:31] Amen in
[35:33] the in the message presuming the prophet
[35:36] of God says but the female is dainty
[35:38] pretty that's where Satan lays right
[35:41] there that's where he chose an Eden
[35:43] that's where he's got to in Eden that's
[35:45] what he's used ever since you tell me
[35:47] one nation in history some of you school
[35:50] kids uh a fall of a Nation as soon as
[35:53] motherhood was broke and Womanhood that
[35:56] nation's backbone was was broke brother
[35:59] man makes this statement so many times
[36:02] it's shocking uh it's multiple times in
[36:04] the message he said that motherhood is
[36:06] the backbone of a
[36:08] nation and and it's I mean it's it's
[36:12] it's actually a shocking statement and
[36:14] motherhood is the backbone because if
[36:16] you talk about the human body and the
[36:18] significance of your
[36:19] backbone your backbone is what holds
[36:22] everything together you stand because of
[36:24] your backbone amen your head is where it
[36:26] is because of your backbone all the
[36:27] nerves and neurological Pathways run
[36:30] through your spinal cord amen your
[36:32] backbone is so essential to everything
[36:34] it's what holds the skeletal structure
[36:36] together it's all built off the backbone
[36:38] amen and now he's saying motherhood is
[36:40] the backbone of the nation amen she's
[36:42] the one holding everything together say
[36:44] when you broke motherhood you broke the
[36:46] nation amen it's like how could brother
[36:48] B say such things and he can show all
[36:50] kinds of types and all kinds of ways in
[36:52] which during World War II when the
[36:54] mothers went to work and started leaving
[36:55] the home and the Great Migration out of
[36:57] the how everything morally began to
[36:59] deteriorate and he he has all kinds of
[37:01] examples for this but the reality is it
[37:03] goes right back to Eden when you broke
[37:07] motherhood you broke the whole
[37:09] civilization of
[37:11] humanity so motherhood becomes this
[37:15] instrument this essential instrument to
[37:17] bring forth the plan of God Amen when it
[37:21] was broken in the woman when it was
[37:23] broken in Eve I mean we we all now come
[37:26] broken because that back backbone was
[37:28] broken and so we're all
[37:32] handicapped because of
[37:34] that so motherhood becomes
[37:38] essential a man can never
[37:41] express what is in him and express his
[37:44] seed without a
[37:47] woman that's why God chose to use the
[37:49] same method the same example brother B
[37:53] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[37:55] Christ he says this he says that's Comm
[37:58] that's committed to Her Sacred virtue
[38:02] sacred Womanhood and sacred
[38:05] motherhood honor her husband three
[38:07] things that a woman is entrusted with
[38:10] sacred virtue sacred Womanhood and then
[38:14] sacred
[38:15] motherhood sacred virtue is keeping
[38:18] herself virgin sacred Womanhood is
[38:21] keeping her body amen veiled keeping her
[38:24] femininity intact amen and not becoming
[38:27] love for allowing others to lust after
[38:29] her and then sacred motherhood is
[38:31] keeping her womb pure Amen to bring
[38:33] forth life amen amen this is why there's
[38:36] so many themes in the Bible that match
[38:39] this there's the there's there there's
[38:41] the theme of progyny Amen a father
[38:44] bringing forth children and everybody
[38:45] going back to their fathers for their
[38:47] identification amen they always go back
[38:50] my fathers I mean even even uh uh even
[38:53] Jacob is saying I worship the god of My
[38:55] Father Abraham and of my father Isaac
[38:58] they're always referring back to their
[38:59] father's Faith their father's lineage
[39:01] who their father was the tribes were
[39:03] broke out the 12 tribes all took the
[39:05] name of the original patriarchal fathers
[39:08] that's why the bi whole Bible set up on
[39:09] a patriarchal system amen that's why we
[39:12] still today when a woman marries she
[39:13] takes her husband's name she comes under
[39:15] his headship comes under his
[39:18] identification so the whole thing is is
[39:20] set up this way under this fatherhood
[39:24] amen it's such a theme in the Bible amen
[39:27] but another them that runs through to
[39:28] the Bible is the the the need for
[39:31] virginity amen it's not just listen it's
[39:34] not just for
[39:36] Morality although it is for Morality but
[39:38] it's not just for Morality because what
[39:41] was the first thing that was broken in
[39:43] Eden is Eve lost her virginity and now
[39:46] corrupted the very womb That was
[39:48] supposed to bring forth life to manifest
[39:50] sons of God and now it falls into
[39:52] corruption because she lost virginity
[39:55] virginity is not just it's not just a
[39:58] way to control actions of people or to
[40:01] have a better morality or to have a
[40:03] better life amen it goes all the way
[40:05] back to the fundamental cause of the of
[40:07] the reason that we're in the condition
[40:09] we're in now and so this virginity runs
[40:12] as a theme because virginity is a way
[40:15] amen for the the way to preserve the
[40:19] heritage of the
[40:21] father that's what it is all through the
[40:23] Bible amen it's a preser it's a
[40:26] preservation of the the heritage of the
[40:28] father he wants to marry a virgin
[40:30] because he doesn't want any other seed
[40:32] to corrupt his seed but he wants to
[40:34] reproduce himself upon the Earth or
[40:36] bring forth his offspring his children
[40:39] and it was so fundamental to the ancient
[40:42] Nations amen this whole thing because
[40:44] it's a concept that comes from
[40:47] God so so now I mean it's been
[40:50] absolutely polluted and corrupted in the
[40:52] world that we live in today and been
[40:54] treated with such disdain amen that it
[40:56] it's acted as if it doesn't mean
[40:58] anything whether or not you keep
[40:59] yourself from marriage or not but
[41:01] they've lost the whole intent and
[41:03] purpose in it all I thank God that he's
[41:06] opened our eyes and given us
[41:08] understanding amen so that we know what
[41:10] God wants of us because the natural
[41:12] types the spiritual what does God want
[41:14] amen he wants a virgin bride he wants an
[41:16] uncorrupted unpolluted womb where he can
[41:18] sew his seed to do what to reproduce his
[41:21] own
[41:22] life comes all the way back so these
[41:25] themes run through the entire Bible amen
[41:30] and so when we started looking at
[41:32] bringing forth this Royal seed my wife
[41:34] and I were sitting at the breakfast
[41:35] table with brother Alistair one morning
[41:37] we were just talking we're just having a
[41:38] conversation and brother Alistair
[41:40] started talking about uh lions and we
[41:43] just were just chatting and he started
[41:45] talking about and he and he mentioned
[41:47] this scripture here see if this works
[41:49] praise God Revelations 55 and one of the
[41:53] elders saith unto me weep not Behold The
[41:54] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[41:56] David hath prevailed to open the book
[41:58] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[42:00] he starts talking about the nature of
[42:02] Christ as a lion and he started because
[42:04] he lives in South Africa he loves nature
[42:06] he loves lion so he was just relating
[42:08] some things and he started talking to us
[42:09] about the objective of the whole Pride
[42:12] amen is to is to move forward the
[42:15] progeny of the male the whole purpose
[42:18] amen the lionesses they they hunt to
[42:20] feed they they they they breed they
[42:22] reproduce the the the lineage of the
[42:25] male amen then they protect them they
[42:27] raise them up they feed them they give
[42:28] their whole lives Amen to to raise up
[42:32] the seed of this male lion amen and they
[42:35] keep out all unwanted uh um other male
[42:39] lions and all their Lions amen because a
[42:41] male lion will come and he will first
[42:44] thing he'll do is he'll kill all the
[42:46] Cubs so that he can put a female back in
[42:49] Ester so that he can sew his own seed
[42:51] because even the animal kingdom is all
[42:52] set up on this sewing seed and progyny
[42:55] and protecting progyny it's all set up
[42:58] on the same thing bringing forth life
[43:00] protecting that life bringing that life
[43:02] to maturity amen the Bible is the same
[43:04] thing bringing forth the life of God in
[43:06] human beings protecting that life and
[43:08] bringing it to adoption
[43:10] maturity praise God so we see it all
[43:12] through nature is what one of the
[43:13] reasons brother B said uh God is in
[43:16] nature and his first Bible was in
[43:18] nature so we see then I started thinking
[43:22] about this as far as uh Father's Day and
[43:24] the purpose of the bride and all of
[43:26] these things and I had this picture here
[43:29] I was thinking of pictures that I could
[43:30] use as a nice big black main African
[43:32] lion but this is actually a picture that
[43:35] my wife and I took when we were in
[43:36] Krueger National Park and so um I was
[43:40] thinking of doing this PowerPoint my
[43:42] wife said we've got those pictures from
[43:44] Krueger I said well praise the Lord that
[43:46] was a mission trip then it was a
[43:49] Ministry trip that wasn't just
[43:51] vacation so I should get a tax write off
[43:54] for that or something
[43:57] but but no it's not the case but so
[44:00] anyways you see this big male lion and
[44:03] the pride is structured Amen to bring
[44:06] forth his seed line and to protect his
[44:09] seed line and feed his seed line and and
[44:11] keep all other Predators away and
[44:14] anybody that would inhibit their lives
[44:16] until they can come into their own
[44:17] maturity amen and and the the church is
[44:20] very much the same way he's the lion of
[44:22] the tribe of Judah amen but we are we
[44:25] are the church we are here to reproduce
[44:27] his life his seed not any other thing
[44:30] and we're here to to protect those
[44:32] progyny from false doctrines and from
[44:35] the Predators that are out there from
[44:37] demon lying spirits and all the things
[44:39] that are around there that's the goal of
[44:40] the church is just to bring forth his
[44:42] life and nurture that life and bring it
[44:45] into adoption
[44:46] maturity
[44:48] amen it says in the breach between the
[44:51] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[44:53] and when the lamb slain walked forward
[44:55] from eternity out of the the father's
[44:57] throne and took his rights it was a
[44:59] judgment seat then he became not a lamb
[45:02] but a lion king and he calls for his
[45:05] Queen to come stand by his side amen
[45:08] when he comes to take the book amen it
[45:10] wasn't time he did the overcoming
[45:13] himself amen he overcame his own self he
[45:16] laid down his life he won back the book
[45:18] he took the book he loosed the seals but
[45:21] when he thundered and when he roared as
[45:22] when a l line Roars and seven Thunders
[45:25] uttered their voices brother B said he
[45:27] was calling for his Queen to come stand
[45:29] by his side now at the opening of the SE
[45:31] seals was time amen for his Queen to
[45:34] come and Unite with him amen and that's
[45:37] the day that we live in yes amen
[45:39] Revelations 10 1:3 and I saw another
[45:42] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[45:43] clothed with the cloud brother R said
[45:45] none other than Christ it could be and a
[45:48] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[45:49] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[45:51] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[45:54] little book open and he set his right
[45:55] foot upon the sea his left foot on the
[45:57] earth and cried with a loud voice as
[45:59] when a lion roared and when he had cried
[46:02] seven Thunders had uttered their voice
[46:04] question is have you heard him Roar Amen
[46:06] in this day have you heard the sounding
[46:08] of the seven Thunders he's calling his
[46:11] Queen to come stand by his side praise
[46:14] be to
[46:15] God in the breach message he says now
[46:18] see he's done his Kinsman work you you
[46:21] know what the Kinsman work was to
[46:23] testify before the elders you remember
[46:25] Boaz kicked off his shoes and so forth
[46:27] he's done all this now he comes to take
[46:30] his bride amen he comes now as a king
[46:32] he's looking for his Queen Amen in this
[46:35] book is the whole secret of it wrapped
[46:38] up around Seven Seals old brother Seven
[46:41] Seals waiting for him to come he comes
[46:43] as a king looking for his queen and the
[46:45] whole book has the secret of it wrapped
[46:47] up in those Seven
[46:49] Seals in the breach again he says when
[46:52] the lamb slain walked forward from
[46:53] eternity out of the father's throne and
[46:55] took his right it was a judgment seat
[46:58] then he become not a lamb but a lion
[47:00] king and he calls for his Queen to come
[47:02] stand by his side so at the time he
[47:05] takes the book and Loos the seals and
[47:06] Roars and the Seven Thunders utter is
[47:09] the time that he's calling for his Queen
[47:10] to come stand by aside that's when we
[47:13] move into the bride age because now it's
[47:14] the calling from the bride out of the
[47:17] denominational age out of Lea to come
[47:19] and Unite with him the Capstone that's
[47:21] come
[47:22] down
[47:24] amen and so she must be a queen Queen
[47:27] amen and because he's calling for a
[47:29] queen what he's wanting to do is
[47:31] reproduce himself he wants to bring
[47:33] forth his seed upon the Earth and he
[47:34] needs a queen and he needs a Virgin
[47:36] Queen that's why he had to restore the
[47:38] word through a prophetic Ministry so
[47:40] that we can be washed by all the filth
[47:42] of these denominational prostitutes and
[47:44] washed away all that was unlike him to
[47:47] bring us back to a virgin condition
[47:49] Washed by the bleeding bloody word so
[47:51] that we can be presented back to Christ
[47:53] as a virgin of the word
[47:57] and a Virgin by the word so that we
[47:59] could receive that word so that we could
[48:01] reproduce the word amen praise
[48:05] God Amen and some some things that that
[48:10] oh the the the Bible is so terrific amen
[48:13] the message is so wonderful but you find
[48:15] out if if you just let your mind go I
[48:18] mean the problem is sometimes we try to
[48:20] intellectualize things and sometimes
[48:22] that's my problem I'm trying to
[48:24] understand too much and it's not about
[48:26] comprehension intellectually it's about
[48:28] comprehension spiritually it's about a
[48:30] spiritual truth that's Awakening inside
[48:33] of us that's why amen we could describe
[48:35] Christ as the lamb and his wife is the
[48:37] wife of the Lamb so he's the lamb she's
[48:39] the lamb but he's also the lion and know
[48:42] she has to be the Lioness I mean you you
[48:44] see all these types and shadows coming
[48:46] down through amen they're all trying to
[48:48] dispel truth to us it's not so that we
[48:50] get hung up and say well is he a lion
[48:52] now or is he a lamb now he's no longer
[48:55] the lamb now he's the lion so am I
[48:57] supposed to be a lamb listen forget
[48:58] about all of that God is trying to take
[49:01] some symbol that you understand and
[49:03] teach you a truth he's not trying to
[49:05] divide himself up and say now I have
[49:07] this nature and now I have this nature
[49:09] it's not like that friends we get all
[49:11] boggled down by details and now is he
[49:13] this or now is he that he's a lamb is he
[49:15] a lamb he's always a lamb he'll always
[49:16] be the lamb when he takes the Throne of
[49:18] David he'll be the Lamb of God but he's
[49:20] also the lion of the tribe of Judah and
[49:22] he's always been the lion and will
[49:24] always be the lion
[49:27] so people get confused with details
[49:29] brother brandham doesn't get confused
[49:31] with details that's why he's a perfect
[49:33] Prophet because he can take the same
[49:35] scripture and use it two different ways
[49:37] because it's all about the revelation of
[49:40] the truth it's not about the details of
[49:42] keeping the words lined out
[49:46] correctly so people get confused and
[49:48] think brother B's contradicting himself
[49:50] one time he makes Noah those Noah and
[49:52] those in the ark are the 144,000 Jews
[49:55] that are saved through the time of
[49:56] tribulation one time he makes them the
[49:58] elect seed that's saved from destruction
[50:00] another time he makes them part of the
[50:02] foolish virgin that are saved from
[50:03] destruction amen when was he right and
[50:06] when was he wrong he's always
[50:09] right because it's the truth that's
[50:11] being inseminated by the word and so now
[50:14] we try to say I mean you take any type
[50:16] if you take a type of The Lion and the
[50:18] pride of lions you take that type and
[50:19] you run it too tight you're going to
[50:21] find a place where it falls apart and no
[50:23] longer expresses the nature of Christ
[50:25] because these are still beasts and
[50:26] Fallen World and a fallen condition and
[50:28] sometimes they eat their own
[50:30] young that's not the point don't get
[50:33] hung up on the details catch the
[50:35] Revelation that he's bringing to us this
[50:38] day he wants us he's calling for his
[50:41] bride his church his seed the the the
[50:44] the female version of him to unite with
[50:46] him in this day so that he can reproduce
[50:49] himself upon the
[50:51] Earth how's he going to reproduce
[50:53] himself she's not going to birth out
[50:55] another Jesus Christ like Mary did 2,000
[50:57] years ago she's actually going to
[50:59] receive the word which is he himself the
[51:02] promised word for this hour which is he
[51:05] himself manifesting himself in the form
[51:07] of a bride Jesus Christ in the bride
[51:10] form and she is going to now surrender
[51:13] to the headship of the word and live
[51:15] that word to the letter by the power of
[51:18] the Holy Ghost that's been released by
[51:20] the fullness of the word coming back and
[51:22] that will be him reproduced through the
[51:24] womb of the Bride
[51:27] amen don't let your mind get B well what
[51:29] child what baby and when and all of that
[51:31] it's you it's in you it's in
[51:33] collectively in the bride it's Christ
[51:35] coming forth from the womb of his his
[51:38] his church that has been
[51:40] redeemed
[51:42] amen praise be to
[51:45] God some of the things that causes
[51:47] arguments and confusion needs to just
[51:50] fade out of our minds and we've all been
[51:53] guilty of it I'm as guilty as any human
[51:55] being so I'm not pointing a finger I've
[51:57] been boggled down in this type and and
[51:59] that type and how do they all mingle
[52:01] together amen you know how to get them
[52:03] to mingle together it's fly a little
[52:05] higher and you see how they're all
[52:07] connected amen I like that picture
[52:10] brother Simon
[52:12] Drew looking at the walled City I mean
[52:14] you got to get a little higher to get
[52:17] the perspective and see how it all fits
[52:20] together
[52:22] amen praise be to
[52:25] God now he is calling for his Queen to
[52:29] come stand by his
[52:30] side what does it mean to go stand by
[52:33] his
[52:35] side does it mean that I have to wait
[52:38] for him to physically manifest and
[52:40] appear and then I walk over to a certain
[52:43] location and I stand next to a to Christ
[52:47] who's now been appeared in whatever
[52:50] realm or whatever Dimension that would
[52:53] be I don't believe that's what it means
[52:55] to come stand by his side
[52:57] I think what it means is to come to his
[52:59] side the side of the word come stand
[53:03] with the word the anointed word that's
[53:06] been revealed in this day leave your
[53:08] position leave your denominations leave
[53:10] your ideas leave your Traditions leave
[53:12] it all and come and stand by his side
[53:15] who is he the revealed word amen he is
[53:18] the manifested revealed word Christ the
[53:20] anointed word for this day that's who he
[53:23] is come stand by him this is the spirit
[53:26] position it's not a physical location
[53:29] amen he's calling for his bride to leave
[53:32] the realm of carnal to leave the
[53:34] hybrization of religion and move up
[53:36] spiritually in her Revelation amen and
[53:39] come and align herself with the word and
[53:41] stand shoulder Tosh shoulder to be what
[53:44] to be his
[53:47] helpmate what the woman was originally
[53:50] intended to
[53:52] be praise
[53:54] God in the restoration of the Bride tree
[53:57] says but what he was God's perfect
[53:59] Prophet tree the example tree the
[54:01] bridegroom tree amen glory going to say
[54:04] something directly he is the bridegroom
[54:07] tree do you believe it from the Garden
[54:10] of Eden then the bridegroom tree without
[54:12] the female tree don't bear fruit so he's
[54:16] got to have a bride tree she has got to
[54:18] be born of the same material the word
[54:21] made flesh in the tree hope you get it
[54:24] it's the same life in this female Tre
[54:26] this bridegroom as it is in the bride
[54:28] The Works that I do shall you
[54:31] also what is it it's his life now in her
[54:36] amen and brother B said the bridegroom
[54:38] tree without the bride tree don't bear
[54:40] fruit so where is the fruit going to
[54:41] come in the end time the fruit which
[54:44] comes from the seed which is a product
[54:46] of the seed life the fruit comes on he
[54:49] says on the top of the tree there's been
[54:51] a topping or a treetop time coming to
[54:54] the bride tree it got ate down by these
[54:56] four insects he said these Roman insects
[54:59] they got in through the corruption amen
[55:01] of denominationalism the corruption of
[55:04] man's ideas and desires and being mixed
[55:07] in with the pure word amen and it ate
[55:09] the tree down through four stages but
[55:11] through four stages he's bringing it
[55:13] back to life and he's showing through
[55:15] through Luther amen through his message
[55:17] it was coming back and he and brother
[55:19] brandom goes on to say and those same
[55:21] Roman insects went to eating on those
[55:23] new shoots that came out
[55:26] he said but God says I will restore his
[55:29] purpose is not going to be defeated in
[55:31] the restoration of the brid tree so what
[55:33] does he do he just trims off the
[55:35] Lutheran branches and lets the life keep
[55:37] coming up they don't eat it back down
[55:39] again friends they only attack the new
[55:43] growth brother B explains all this and
[55:46] the restoration of the brid tree and now
[55:48] they come out to the next level under
[55:51] Wesley it's growing a little higher
[55:52] putting forth shoots amen started
[55:54] bearing a life of sanctification amen
[55:56] and then after Wesley dies those insects
[55:59] those Roman insects start creeping away
[56:01] again but God's purpose is not going to
[56:03] be defeated he already said I will
[56:06] restore all the years that the
[56:08] cankerworm palmerworm caterpillar and
[56:10] Locust have eaten I will restore and so
[56:13] now amen he he starts to bring it up and
[56:16] then when they eat it back all he does
[56:17] is prune off the Wesley and branch and
[56:20] brings the new growth out of the top
[56:22] what's he doing he's bringing it to a
[56:24] treetop he's bringing it to where the
[56:26] full sun can shine Amen to bring forth
[56:29] the predestinated
[56:31] fruit same thing through Pentecost comes
[56:33] up denominationalism Creeps in he prunes
[56:36] it off but the fourth stage Hallelujah
[56:40] said he ate it down through four bug
[56:42] bugs but it came back through the fourth
[56:43] and when brother Ram gets to this he
[56:44] goes oh how I'd like to go into Ezekiel
[56:47] and read about ezekiel's dry bones amen
[56:50] where the Prophet prophesied and they
[56:52] came together through three stages bone
[56:54] to bone and senu and skin and now they
[56:56] were standing there on their feet amen
[56:58] but there was not life yet amen so now
[57:01] he says the fourth stage is speak to the
[57:03] wind amen which is the spirit amen to
[57:05] come back into this Army that's the
[57:07] fourth stage that's the latter Reign
[57:10] that's this
[57:11] message prophesied by William brandham
[57:14] to do what to bring the spirit The Life
[57:16] of Christ back into a body of Believers
[57:19] amen what was lost after Pentecost amen
[57:22] has been lost and ate down through these
[57:24] Roman bugs but he's brought it back
[57:26] through four stages and the fourth stage
[57:29] is the message the opening of the seals
[57:31] the revealing of the mystery of God Amen
[57:33] it's the Life coming back into the
[57:37] church praise God I just how i' like to
[57:41] get them dry bones
[57:45] hallelujah oh my goodness what was it it
[57:48] was a mighty Army but that Mighty Army
[57:51] had went down through four stages they
[57:53] lost the life they lost the skin they
[57:55] lost the Senus and the bones were
[57:57] separated and it was a valley full of
[57:58] dry bones Amen in the Dark Ages but
[58:01] after the Dark Ages he started bringing
[58:03] the bones back together amen then he
[58:05] brought the the the the senu back
[58:07] together in the muscle then he brought
[58:09] the skin back on and Pentecost that's
[58:11] why Pentecost looked like the real thing
[58:13] cuz it had skin and it was standing
[58:15] there but it wasn't finished yet there
[58:17] had to be a fourth stage of life amen to
[58:19] come back and that four stage of Life
[58:22] came when the former rain and latter
[58:23] rain were falling together at the
[58:25] opening of the the
[58:26] seals that's why those messages from the
[58:29] seals on 63 on are so Dynamic he starts
[58:33] preaching about son of man Ministry he
[58:35] starts showing C Gene of God all of
[58:37] these things are coming forth why it's
[58:39] the message of life amen bringing the
[58:41] spirit of Christ right back into your
[58:46] life to have a
[58:48] treetop and what's supposed to happen to
[58:49] the treetop when the full sun of the
[58:51] word is shining supposed to produce the
[58:53] fruit again the original
[58:57] predestinated
[58:59] fruit same
[59:01] life in this female tree the bridegroom
[59:05] as it is in the
[59:07] bride this is why brother B says so many
[59:11] difficult things if we're trying to go
[59:15] intellectual and we're trying to
[59:17] categorize and uh scholar eyes the
[59:21] message so many difficult things cuz he
[59:24] says this Holy Ghost has been bound by
[59:26] these denomination of waters for nearly
[59:28] 2,000
[59:30] years and how is the Holy Ghost
[59:33] Bound by these denominational Waters or
[59:36] Rivers he's talking about Euphrates
[59:38] being the barrier to the promised land
[59:40] and coming back into the land and all
[59:42] these things he's typing all of this
[59:46] remember brother M was taking all these
[59:48] Old Testament figures and characters and
[59:51] examples and rivers and Waters and kings
[59:54] and he's all trying to to reveal to us
[59:56] what's happening
[1:00:00] spiritually not so that we could go back
[1:00:02] and study the Euphrates and figure out
[1:00:04] the
[1:00:05] bins not the physical but the
[1:00:09] spiritual so
[1:00:11] now the Holy Spirit has been
[1:00:14] bound by
[1:00:16] these denominational Waters these Rivers
[1:00:19] for nearly 2,000 years said he couldn't
[1:00:21] get into the church you think the Holy
[1:00:24] Ghost can go anywhere he wants
[1:00:26] but no because the because the Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost the the spirit and the word
[1:00:31] brother B said are one and the
[1:00:34] same and when they rejected the word
[1:00:36] they rejected the spirit they could
[1:00:38] never get the full Spirit brother B said
[1:00:40] they had a dip in the spirit because God
[1:00:42] would always bring a measure of Truth
[1:00:43] and when they receive that measure of
[1:00:44] Truth they would receive the life that
[1:00:46] came with that truth so when they reive
[1:00:48] justification they received that portion
[1:00:50] of life with justification
[1:00:51] sanctification they receive that portion
[1:00:53] of Life same thing with the restoration
[1:00:55] of the gifts
[1:00:57] but brother brandom says that the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost in its full measure was bound it
[1:01:01] wasn't that the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:01:02] working through the church ages it
[1:01:04] wasn't that the spirit wasn't moving it
[1:01:05] wasn't that they didn't have life and
[1:01:07] didn't have the Holy Spirit it wasn't
[1:01:09] any of that but the full measure of the
[1:01:11] Holy Ghost was bound by these
[1:01:13] denominational Waters amen for nearly
[1:01:16] 2,000 years but is loosed in the evening
[1:01:19] time by the evening time
[1:01:22] message the messenger comes and brings
[1:01:25] the message and what does it do it
[1:01:27] loosed the Holy Ghost what was tying up
[1:01:29] the Holy Ghost amen he was tied up it
[1:01:32] wasn't that he was bound and tied up he
[1:01:34] he could not move in where the word was
[1:01:37] not accepted and when the word was not
[1:01:39] revealed amen so now at the revealing of
[1:01:41] the word the opening of the word amen
[1:01:43] when that little virgin says be it unto
[1:01:45] me according to Thy word the life of the
[1:01:47] word comes right in with the
[1:01:50] word
[1:01:52] amen because she's rejected and
[1:01:54] denounced all her denomination of ideas
[1:01:56] she's been Washed by the Water of the
[1:01:58] bleeding word and now she says that
[1:02:00] ain't nothing but the truth so be it
[1:02:02] unto
[1:02:03] me amen and so all of these things uh
[1:02:10] that they're odd sayings until you get
[1:02:12] the context of what he's saying and why
[1:02:15] he's saying these things and what he's
[1:02:18] trying to get us to see he's trying to
[1:02:21] break us out of denominationalism he's
[1:02:24] trying to break us out of traditional
[1:02:26] thinking he's trying to break us out of
[1:02:29] sitting here and just going to church on
[1:02:30] Sunday and going to church on Wednesday
[1:02:32] and waiting someday for when Jesus comes
[1:02:34] back and we all see him and we all go to
[1:02:36] a paradise and everything will be
[1:02:37] wonderful then he's trying to break that
[1:02:39] out of our minds so that we recognize
[1:02:41] he's here he's present tense he is come
[1:02:44] and he's calling for his Queen to come
[1:02:46] stand by his side he wants to finish
[1:02:48] what wasn't finished with the first
[1:02:50] church that came fresh out of Pentecost
[1:02:52] because before they before he came to
[1:02:54] her to reproduce himself fully upon the
[1:02:56] Earth she was already a fallen woman
[1:02:58] amen that now he's restored that Fallen
[1:03:01] woman so he can go so they can go back
[1:03:03] to Pentecost not to stay at
[1:03:06] Pentecost remember not Pentecost Revival
[1:03:09] but when they came through the Feast of
[1:03:11] Pentecost and they Spilled Out with the
[1:03:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and The Life
[1:03:14] of Christ now living in them that's what
[1:03:16] he brings us back to but but not to stay
[1:03:19] there because they were supposed to move
[1:03:21] from there to the marriage and they
[1:03:23] never got to the marriage they never
[1:03:25] never got to the consummation they never
[1:03:27] got to the conception and they never got
[1:03:29] to the
[1:03:30] reproduction God so we don't want to
[1:03:33] just go back to being the church it was
[1:03:35] at Pentecost and stop we're just being
[1:03:37] brought back to a virgin condition so
[1:03:40] that we can complete what they didn't
[1:03:44] complete Amen brother B even said in one
[1:03:47] quot I don't have it with me but you'll
[1:03:48] just have to go look for it he said in
[1:03:50] one quote he says not not Pentecost he
[1:03:53] said the Pentecostals represent that
[1:03:56] yes going back the restoration of the
[1:03:58] gifts was going back to the supernatural
[1:04:00] things but it's not just that we're
[1:04:02] going back the that was been restored
[1:04:04] absolutely the gifts of the Spirit have
[1:04:06] been restored but to bring us into a
[1:04:08] virgin condition to bring us to the
[1:04:11] marriage that's what was
[1:04:15] missed
[1:04:17] amen this is what brother bram's trying
[1:04:19] to get us to see the great event that's
[1:04:22] taking place in our day Christ coming as
[1:04:25] the fullness of the word the full
[1:04:28] revelation of what's been hid down
[1:04:30] Through the Ages what was in the back
[1:04:32] God of God's mind his great desire was
[1:04:34] to live in
[1:04:37] people and he's come to say this is the
[1:04:40] time for the manifestation of that in
[1:04:42] the small measure that's on Earth at the
[1:04:45] time that's why they without us are not
[1:04:49] yet made perfect they're waiting for
[1:04:51] this Perfection to come through adoption
[1:04:53] this Union of Christ and the
[1:04:54] reproduction of the life of Christ and
[1:04:56] that will literally bring them out of
[1:04:58] the
[1:04:59] graves praise be to
[1:05:02] God so
[1:05:05] now he's a king cuz he took the
[1:05:09] book and he loosed the
[1:05:11] seals and now he's calling for a queen
[1:05:15] to come stand by his side
[1:05:18] amen you know when the lion roars who
[1:05:22] can but
[1:05:24] prophesy it's amazing when you uh I can
[1:05:27] only imagine I've never been a hyena or
[1:05:31] a jackal or anything like that but I can
[1:05:33] imagine when the lion
[1:05:35] roars that if it's nearby and he sounds
[1:05:38] angry if I'm a hyena or a jackal or any
[1:05:41] kind of competition I think I'd run
[1:05:46] away there's some that run away from the
[1:05:48] Roar of the
[1:05:51] lion but there's others that run to the
[1:05:53] Roar of the Lion and it depends on what
[1:05:56] species you are and what Pride you're
[1:05:59] part of whether you run to the roar or
[1:06:01] you run away from the roar when the lion
[1:06:04] roars amen when did he Roar he Roar when
[1:06:07] he came down with an open book in his
[1:06:09] hand and then seven Thunders uttered
[1:06:11] their voices amen and then there was a
[1:06:13] people on the Earth that run away from
[1:06:16] that Roar because they don't understand
[1:06:17] Mysteries and they don't it's too
[1:06:19] mystical and I don't know about this
[1:06:21] Prophet thing and I it's not like what I
[1:06:23] was taught all my life and they run away
[1:06:25] but those who are of the same species
[1:06:28] and of the same Pride they run to that
[1:06:30] Roar of a line what scares some brings
[1:06:33] joy to another what is awkward for one
[1:06:36] ears is a homecoming to another Amen to
[1:06:38] one it's fearful and mysterious and
[1:06:40] scary to another it's a welcoming sound
[1:06:43] it's home it's home it's my father it's
[1:06:47] my husband it's whatever is in me it's
[1:06:50] the eagle screaming through the eagle in
[1:06:51] the chicken yard it's not a foreign
[1:06:53] sound I've never heard it before but
[1:06:55] when I hear it I'm attracted to it
[1:06:57] there's something in me that loves that
[1:06:59] eagle
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:01] scream praise be to
[1:07:04] God
[1:07:06] Amen so now he's calling for his Queen
[1:07:10] to come stand by his
[1:07:14] side and she comes to the
[1:07:18] roar brother M makes this statement he
[1:07:21] says you understand that did you see the
[1:07:24] Earth is cursed the whole earth is
[1:07:26] cursed because of Adam's sin but when
[1:07:28] this little seed now the woman doesn't
[1:07:30] have a seed she is a field that the seed
[1:07:33] lays in not a seed because there's not a
[1:07:35] germ see seed has to have life in it if
[1:07:38] it isn't it's just a material the life
[1:07:40] isn't there so the seed is in the
[1:07:43] man now I also want to let you know
[1:07:45] brother br's not talking scientifically
[1:07:48] here don't try to take this
[1:07:51] scientifically there's another place
[1:07:52] where brother R said see the woman has a
[1:07:54] seed too because those two have to come
[1:07:56] together 23 chromosomes and 23
[1:07:58] chromosomes and they they come together
[1:07:59] in matching Pairs and we we know we know
[1:08:02] the science but don't be overly
[1:08:04] intelligent right
[1:08:05] now let's just get the
[1:08:08] point what he's showing is life comes
[1:08:10] through the father because the mother
[1:08:13] can never produce life without the
[1:08:15] father and neither can the father
[1:08:17] without the mother but he's showing that
[1:08:20] life that's why the Bible is patriarchal
[1:08:23] that's why the F the Bible runs from
[1:08:24] father a son the lineages are
[1:08:27] patriarchal because he's showing I had a
[1:08:29] nurse one time who's in the message amen
[1:08:31] she absolutely believed the message had
[1:08:32] no doubt she said brother Chad I've
[1:08:34] looked at the science behind it and the
[1:08:36] hemoglobin and the life and the and and
[1:08:39] and she goes I I can't understand it I
[1:08:41] said the point is not to understand that
[1:08:43] the point is to understand that life
[1:08:45] comes from the
[1:08:47] male that's what we must understand
[1:08:50] because that's what the whole Bible is
[1:08:52] showing us
[1:08:55] you understand I'm not saying ignore
[1:08:57] science and act like we're that's not
[1:09:00] the point we're not talking about how
[1:09:01] the chromosomes match up we're not
[1:09:03] talking about amen fertilized egg and an
[1:09:05] egg and a spr we're not talking about
[1:09:07] any of that what we're talking about is
[1:09:08] the very thing that the Bible shows us
[1:09:11] is shows us that life comes from the
[1:09:13] father from the father to the mother and
[1:09:15] then they're born and they give
[1:09:16] attribute all the they give it all back
[1:09:18] to the father I'm the son of Abraham I
[1:09:21] worship the god of My Father Abraham and
[1:09:23] this and this it's always back to to the
[1:09:26] father why because everything in US goes
[1:09:29] back to the father because only the male
[1:09:31] father word has
[1:09:33] life we're supposed to be the field to
[1:09:36] receive
[1:09:38] life
[1:09:41] amen sometimes you find that the
[1:09:44] greatest unbelievers of the message are
[1:09:46] message
[1:09:49] believers they claim they believe
[1:09:51] Malachi 4 they claim they believe
[1:09:52] brother B's a prophet they claim they
[1:09:54] believe this and then they want to go to
[1:09:55] Scientific books and proving wrong about
[1:09:57] life comes from this the greatest
[1:09:59] unbelievers in the message are message
[1:10:01] so-called message Believers because God
[1:10:04] sent us a perfect interpretation of the
[1:10:06] word with Divine
[1:10:08] Vindication he gave us the truth of his
[1:10:10] mind not scientific details the
[1:10:14] truth the truth that supersedes
[1:10:17] everything the mystery revealed in the
[1:10:19] back part from the back part of God's
[1:10:20] mind that supersedes
[1:10:24] everything look it's a shame that
[1:10:26] sometimes the greatest unbelievers of
[1:10:28] the message are so-called message
[1:10:30] Believers that don't even believe what
[1:10:32] the prophet told
[1:10:34] us
[1:10:37] sad Ephesians 6:4 it says and your
[1:10:40] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:10:42] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[1:10:44] and admonition of the Lord and so this
[1:10:47] is a a commandment given to fathers this
[1:10:49] is the Apostle Paul says his father's
[1:10:52] day we might as well talk about it a
[1:10:53] little bit he says nurture bring them up
[1:10:56] in nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:10:59] but just as Adam in order to reproduce
[1:11:02] himself needed a help meat every man
[1:11:05] needs a help
[1:11:06] meat and if I'm given the task of
[1:11:09] bringing up my children the nurture and
[1:11:12] ammonition of the Lord then I need for
[1:11:16] one to bring forth my seed I need a
[1:11:20] womb I need a woman and I need a wife in
[1:11:23] order to reproduce my myself to bring
[1:11:26] forth my progeny my seed I need a wife
[1:11:28] and now in a in a holy Union with that
[1:11:31] wife amen I can bring forth the seed
[1:11:33] that is in me and that seed comes up and
[1:11:35] I have a commandment from God to bring
[1:11:37] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[1:11:39] the Lord but I need the very partner who
[1:11:42] helped me create this child I need them
[1:11:44] to help me in my task to nurture uh to
[1:11:48] bring up the child in the nurture and
[1:11:49] admonition of the Lord so I need a help
[1:11:53] meat amen we still need help meets
[1:11:56] Brothers we still need a woman we still
[1:11:58] need a wife Amen to reproduce ourselves
[1:12:01] amen we still amen we still need a wife
[1:12:03] to help us in our task to raise these
[1:12:06] children to serve God and if that's true
[1:12:09] then that means it's very important who
[1:12:12] we select to be our
[1:12:15] wife
[1:12:18] amen and I'm choosing of a
[1:12:20] bride actually I'm not going to read
[1:12:23] that yet stop I'm going to read this one
[1:12:25] I've got a longer one that wouldn't fit
[1:12:26] on the slide I want to read that first
[1:12:28] brother Venom says now now now remember
[1:12:31] we're typing natural and spiritual
[1:12:33] brother B's doing the same thing in
[1:12:34] choosing of a bride so these what we're
[1:12:36] talking about now are principles amen
[1:12:38] that move in every facet of Life
[1:12:40] everywhere you have a what's
[1:12:42] symbolically a man and a woman amen
[1:12:44] Christ and his bride a a husband and a
[1:12:46] wife amen wherever you have that these
[1:12:48] principles lay
[1:12:50] true he says in choosing of a bride now
[1:12:53] we are here see plainly the spirit
[1:12:55] spiritual plan of God's planning for his
[1:12:57] future home with his future bride comes
[1:12:59] into view now if a man marries a sex
[1:13:02] Queen you see what he's looking for for
[1:13:04] the future if a man marries a woman that
[1:13:07] won't stay home you see what he's
[1:13:08] looking for in the
[1:13:10] future this sounds awful says I just
[1:13:13] feel to say it he's getting ready to say
[1:13:15] something and he says it's going to
[1:13:16] sound awful I just feel to say it and
[1:13:17] usually if I feel to say a thing I ought
[1:13:19] to say it and it's usually God's way I
[1:13:23] used to go with a Ranter that I worked
[1:13:24] with to buy cattle and I noticed the old
[1:13:27] fell always looked right in the face of
[1:13:28] a heer before he went to bidding then he
[1:13:31] turned her head and looked back and
[1:13:33] forth I followed him along watching him
[1:13:35] and he looked her up and down if she
[1:13:37] looked all right the stature then he
[1:13:39] turned and looked her in the face and
[1:13:41] sometime he shake his head and walk away
[1:13:44] I said Jeff I want to ask you something
[1:13:46] he said say on Bill I said why you
[1:13:49] always looking that cow in the face I
[1:13:51] said she looks all right good heavy cow
[1:13:54] said I want to tell you boy you got a
[1:13:55] lot to learn and I realized that after
[1:13:58] he told me he said I don't care how she
[1:14:00] made up she might be beef Plum to the
[1:14:02] hoof but if she's got that wild stare in
[1:14:05] her face don't you never buy
[1:14:07] her said why so Jeff said well said the
[1:14:11] first thing is said she'll never stay
[1:14:13] put he said the next thing is she'll
[1:14:15] never be a mamy to her calf and said
[1:14:17] they put her in a pen now the reason
[1:14:19] she's fat you turn her loose with that
[1:14:21] wild stair she'd run herself to death I
[1:14:24] said you know I kind of learned
[1:14:26] something I believe that applies to
[1:14:28] women
[1:14:30] too I'm so glad brother Brown said these
[1:14:32] things amen cuz I would never use
[1:14:34] analogies like that in the pull
[1:14:37] pit
[1:14:38] amen I believe that applies to women too
[1:14:41] right the wild stary rietta look better
[1:14:44] stay away from her boy all that their
[1:14:46] blue stuff over the top of her eyes I
[1:14:49] didn't I wouldn't want that I don't
[1:14:51] think that's becoming to a Christian I
[1:14:53] don't care how much the television and
[1:14:55] paper says it's pretty it's the most
[1:14:56] horrible looking hideous sight that I
[1:14:58] ever seen in my
[1:15:00] life he goes down a couple paragraphs
[1:15:02] further he says but you know you have to
[1:15:05] plan look Pray when you're
[1:15:09] choosing amen this is for all the
[1:15:11] unmarrieds now hey hey you're getting a
[1:15:13] free lesson from the prophet now just
[1:15:15] judge her like you would a good beef
[1:15:19] cow she might be beef don't tell her she
[1:15:22] looks like beef Plum to the hoof I I
[1:15:24] would suggest you don't use that quote
[1:15:27] exactly that way you may lose your
[1:15:32] chance
[1:15:34] amen but he says you have to plan look
[1:15:37] Pray when you're choosing for we see by
[1:15:39] this the Word of Promise she the bride
[1:15:42] that a man would choose is going to
[1:15:43] reflect his character it reflects what's
[1:15:46] in
[1:15:47] him now could you imagine a man filled
[1:15:50] with the Holy Ghost take something like
[1:15:51] that to be a wife I I just don't see it
[1:15:55] brother now maybe I'm just an old crank
[1:15:57] but you know I just can't understand
[1:15:58] that see notice for it's going to
[1:16:00] reflect what's in him she's going to
[1:16:02] help him make his future home now when
[1:16:05] brother brandham now is talking about
[1:16:06] the choosing of a bride he's he's he's
[1:16:09] talking now about the lesson he learned
[1:16:11] in ranching because it doesn't matter
[1:16:12] the outward appearance it matters the
[1:16:14] character of the creature and when it
[1:16:17] comes down to a woman amen she may be
[1:16:19] ever so beautiful and put together so
[1:16:21] well and able Amen to to make herself
[1:16:24] look nice am amen but that's not the
[1:16:26] part that you're looking for amen you
[1:16:28] want to find out who's going to help you
[1:16:30] raise your children in the fear and
[1:16:31] admonition of the Lord because you need
[1:16:33] a help me to help you take what's inside
[1:16:36] of you and bring it to life and nurture
[1:16:39] that up to the fear and ammonition of
[1:16:40] the Lord to be amen something that came
[1:16:43] from you your Offspring that's now
[1:16:45] serving the
[1:16:46] lord brother Ben said that's what you
[1:16:49] ought to be looking for amen so many
[1:16:52] times we have disasters because uh good
[1:16:54] because everything was motivated by lust
[1:16:58] yes then down the road you end up with
[1:17:01] with a
[1:17:02] disaster because the whole thing was
[1:17:05] lust amen but he's saying you should
[1:17:08] pray because she's going to help make
[1:17:12] your future home it's not about just
[1:17:15] fulfilling your desire for
[1:17:17] today it's for what will happen in the
[1:17:23] future now then when we change back down
[1:17:26] for a moment to the spiritual side and
[1:17:29] when you see a church that's in the
[1:17:30] world acts like the world anticipating
[1:17:33] in the world partaking of the world
[1:17:36] counting God's Commandments as if he
[1:17:37] never had wrote them then you can just
[1:17:40] imagine Christ ain't going to take a
[1:17:41] bride like that could you imagine taking
[1:17:43] the modern church today for a bride not
[1:17:46] my Lord I could hardly see that no
[1:17:48] remember now a man and his wife are one
[1:17:51] would you join yourself to a person like
[1:17:53] that if you would it would serve
[1:17:54] certainly kind of disappoint my faith in
[1:17:57] you brother man is showing us that now
[1:18:01] just as a man shouldn't choose a woman
[1:18:03] with that that that that wild stare in
[1:18:07] her
[1:18:08] eye let's just talk about that wild
[1:18:10] stare in her
[1:18:11] eye that one that doesn't want to stay
[1:18:14] put she doesn't want to sacrifice her
[1:18:16] life she's not wanting to yield she's
[1:18:18] not wanting to give up her career she's
[1:18:20] not wanting to give up uh uh her ideas
[1:18:22] or her advancement or her money
[1:18:25] or or her idea of what she wants for her
[1:18:27] family if she's not willing to lay all
[1:18:30] that down that's the one that you don't
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:35] want amen that's the one you don't want
[1:18:38] because you want the one that's going to
[1:18:40] help you reproduce yourself and raise
[1:18:42] your children in the fear and ammonition
[1:18:44] of the Lord you want the one that's
[1:18:46] going to sacrifice herself for your
[1:18:50] seed you want the one that'll give her
[1:18:52] life amen give up herself give up her
[1:18:55] time give up her sleep give up her
[1:18:57] career give up her advancement give up
[1:18:59] her titles give up everything even give
[1:19:02] her body over to another seed that will
[1:19:05] give herself completely up to do what to
[1:19:07] unite with you to fulfill your purpose
[1:19:09] in this life to reproduce yourself and
[1:19:11] raise your children in the fear and
[1:19:13] ammonition of the Lord you're looking
[1:19:14] for that kind of a wife not not just one
[1:19:17] that that makes your heart Thump Thump
[1:19:19] and not just one that makes your eyes
[1:19:21] glisten and glow you want one that's
[1:19:23] going to help youing bring forth what's
[1:19:25] inside of you and help you nurture it
[1:19:28] along to become amen a child of
[1:19:31] God that's the most important thing to
[1:19:34] look for why because that's what Christ
[1:19:36] is looking for brother Brenham is
[1:19:38] teaching this whole this whole sermon to
[1:19:40] teach is what Christ is looking for he's
[1:19:42] looking for a bride to help him
[1:19:44] reproduce himself upon the Earth she
[1:19:46] can't have her own ideas her own agenda
[1:19:49] her own Doctrine her own way of doing
[1:19:51] things she's got to surrender herself
[1:19:53] and take his head ship completely amen
[1:19:56] and lay down her life and give up her
[1:19:58] body her ideas amen her Traditions her
[1:20:01] family church give it all
[1:20:04] up and surrender to
[1:20:07] him one that's gentle and meek and kind
[1:20:10] and
[1:20:12] submissive listen this this so many
[1:20:15] things that the prophet taught blasting
[1:20:18] modern the modern feminism and the woman
[1:20:20] of the day man that doesn't have
[1:20:22] backbone enough the the the to take
[1:20:24] leadership in his home he's blasting all
[1:20:26] of these things and it sounds like well
[1:20:28] you know people can get the idea well he
[1:20:30] was just in another generation he was an
[1:20:32] older man and he had his own ideas it's
[1:20:35] not that he's actually preaching the
[1:20:37] very theme of The Bible he's actually
[1:20:39] showing you that this Modern leodan Way
[1:20:42] amen is not God's way it's not the way
[1:20:45] that God Amen attended in the beginning
[1:20:48] it's not the way God wants it to run now
[1:20:50] amen he's blasting those things because
[1:20:52] those are anti- word conduct
[1:20:55] amen amen and listen brother bham is not
[1:20:58] a legalist he's not hammering these
[1:20:59] things out and saying you have to do
[1:21:01] this and you can never do this that's
[1:21:03] not the point he's trying to get us the
[1:21:05] vision of what Christ bride is supposed
[1:21:07] to be like amen and it's supposed to be
[1:21:09] reflected in our lives and in our
[1:21:12] homes cuz we're supposed to be a
[1:21:14] reflection of the word it's not just a
[1:21:17] man blasting stuff he doesn't like he's
[1:21:19] caught the mind of God he has caught the
[1:21:22] very mind of the word amen he may not
[1:21:25] know his Bible real well but he knows
[1:21:26] the author really
[1:21:29] well he's not just saying things don't
[1:21:32] take the things the prophet said lightly
[1:21:33] and just dismissed them as if that's for
[1:21:35] a previous generation that's for another
[1:21:37] day no he's he's actually got God's mind
[1:21:40] amen he knows the author real
[1:21:44] well and he's looking for a bride that's
[1:21:48] not going to continually take her own
[1:21:52] way if a man is looking for a wife he's
[1:21:56] got to find the one that reflects what's
[1:21:58] inside of
[1:21:59] him because what's inside of him is also
[1:22:02] his
[1:22:03] progeny his
[1:22:05] seedline and he's got to find something
[1:22:07] that matches the inside of him so that
[1:22:10] he can bring forth listen it's so
[1:22:13] important to find a
[1:22:16] match I don't I hope I hope this gets
[1:22:20] home I don't exactly know how to explain
[1:22:22] it but it's so important to find the
[1:22:25] right
[1:22:26] match because the right match has to be
[1:22:29] she has to be an extension of what you
[1:22:32] are
[1:22:33] inside because it's her very body that's
[1:22:36] going to bring what's inside of you to
[1:22:39] manifestation and then you guys are
[1:22:41] going to partner together as a help meet
[1:22:43] to bring your desire for your Offspring
[1:22:46] to fruition to a
[1:22:48] manifestation now listen this is the
[1:22:50] principle and you can say brother Chad I
[1:22:52] did that and there's ones who've left
[1:22:54] not what we're talking about the world
[1:22:55] is fallen in a fallen condition and
[1:22:57] there's sin everywhere you can do
[1:22:58] everything right and still have a
[1:22:59] wayward child that's not what we're
[1:23:00] talking about I'm talking about the
[1:23:02] principle that matches Christ and his
[1:23:04] bride catch the principle because the
[1:23:06] principle Works sin is still sin and
[1:23:08] free moral agency is still free moral
[1:23:10] agency things will go wrong amen don't
[1:23:12] let the principal bring condemnation or
[1:23:14] feel like your pre against just say amen
[1:23:16] that's the
[1:23:19] truth so a man has to find his match
[1:23:26] amen he's got to find what reflects
[1:23:29] what's inside of
[1:23:31] him so that she can help reproduce him
[1:23:35] on the
[1:23:36] earth now I know it's in a perverted way
[1:23:38] and I know it's corrupted I know all of
[1:23:40] that but the principle's still true
[1:23:43] there's hybridization and and can still
[1:23:45] produce a black sheep in a family I mean
[1:23:47] brother B explains all of these things
[1:23:49] to us but I'm I want to show the
[1:23:51] principle is sound and true
[1:23:54] because Jesus Christ wants to reproduce
[1:23:57] himself on the earth and he's got to
[1:23:59] find a bride that matches what's inside
[1:24:01] of
[1:24:04] him brother B
[1:24:07] says choosing of a bride again the kind
[1:24:10] of woman that a man would choose will
[1:24:11] reflect his ambition and his character
[1:24:15] if a man chooses the wrong woman it
[1:24:16] reflects his character and what he ties
[1:24:18] himself to shows truly what's in him a
[1:24:22] woman reflects what's in the man when he
[1:24:25] chooses her for wife it shows what's
[1:24:27] down in him no matter what he says
[1:24:30] outside watch what he
[1:24:33] married if he married for lust it'll
[1:24:36] show if he married for character it'll
[1:24:39] show
[1:24:41] amen and praise God some of us didn't
[1:24:44] even know these things when we got
[1:24:45] married and it was the grace of God that
[1:24:46] watched over us anyhow amen at the end
[1:24:49] of the day it's God's grace amen it's
[1:24:51] not what we can accomplish or what we
[1:24:53] can learn amen does change the principle
[1:24:55] being true but I thank God when I knew
[1:24:57] nothing God was watching over
[1:24:59] me amen but you all know different now
[1:25:05] this generation coming up you're without
[1:25:07] excuse because to much is given much is
[1:25:09] required don't just say I'm depending on
[1:25:12] the grace of God God's grace is to give
[1:25:13] you the word that's his
[1:25:17] grace so now now a man must find what
[1:25:22] reflects the inside of him he says what
[1:25:27] say if I would marry a coarse girl what
[1:25:29] if I would marry a sex queen or just a
[1:25:31] pretty modern Retta it reflects it shows
[1:25:34] what he has in his mind of what his
[1:25:36] future home is going to be because he's
[1:25:38] took her to raise his children by and
[1:25:40] whatever she is that's the way she'll
[1:25:42] raise those
[1:25:44] children so it reflects what's in the
[1:25:47] man a man that takes a woman like that
[1:25:49] shows just what he's thinking of the
[1:25:51] future and many times it shows he's not
[1:25:53] thinking of the future he's thinking of
[1:25:55] the present he wants to fulfill his own
[1:25:57] lustful desires he wants to have what
[1:26:00] he's craving and he's not even thinking
[1:26:01] of the
[1:26:02] future amen so I want to highlight this
[1:26:06] bolded here because he took her to raise
[1:26:08] his children by and whatever she is
[1:26:10] that's the way she'll raise those
[1:26:13] children so many times that's not what's
[1:26:16] thought of in the
[1:26:18] beginning but it's what should be
[1:26:20] thought of it's important it's certainly
[1:26:23] what Christ is thinking of
[1:26:26] I want to go down and I want to show
[1:26:27] some examples through scripture so I'm
[1:26:29] going to go through several scriptures
[1:26:30] really fast from
[1:26:31] Genesis Genesis 20 and aimc said unto
[1:26:34] Abraham what what sawest thou that thou
[1:26:37] Hast done this thing and Abraham said
[1:26:39] because I thought surely the fear of God
[1:26:41] is not in this place and they will slay
[1:26:42] me for my wife's sake and yet indeed she
[1:26:45] is my sister she is the daughter of my
[1:26:48] father but not the daughter of my mother
[1:26:50] and she became my wife so who did
[1:26:52] Abraham marry his half
[1:26:55] sister now don't start saying yuck
[1:26:59] gross it's amazing when we get into the
[1:27:01] Bible how many times we we judge the
[1:27:03] Bible based off our emotions about the
[1:27:06] world we live in
[1:27:08] today we got to stop that God wrote this
[1:27:10] Bible intentionally show us spiritual
[1:27:13] truth stop saying yuck and I couldn't
[1:27:16] never do listen God God wrote his Bible
[1:27:20] exactly the way he wanted it
[1:27:23] wrote don't judge what happened 4,000
[1:27:26] years ago based off your emotions about
[1:27:28] the culture you live in today because
[1:27:31] what you'll be doing is you'll be saying
[1:27:32] yuck about the word of
[1:27:36] God so he married his sister brother
[1:27:40] teaches us the genetic pool was much
[1:27:41] stronger back then the law of Moses
[1:27:43] hadn't come and the law of Moses forbid
[1:27:45] it to at least the second cousin or
[1:27:47] Beyond so we know all that God had a way
[1:27:49] of bringing things down after he spoke
[1:27:51] what he needed spoke after it was
[1:27:52] written needed written then he come down
[1:27:53] and brought protection measures through
[1:27:55] the law amen so god is perfect in all of
[1:27:58] his
[1:28:00] ways so now we said and Abraham said
[1:28:03] unto his eldest servant of his house
[1:28:05] that ruled over all that he had put I
[1:28:07] pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I
[1:28:09] will make thee swear by the Lord the god
[1:28:11] of Heaven and the god of the earth that
[1:28:13] thou should not take a wife into my son
[1:28:14] of the daughters of the Canaanites among
[1:28:17] whom I dwell but Thou shalt go into my
[1:28:19] country into my Kindred and take a wife
[1:28:22] into my son Isaac
[1:28:25] this has always been through the Bible
[1:28:27] it mattered who they
[1:28:29] married this was a natural type but now
[1:28:32] it's a spiritual
[1:28:35] type in in Genesis 11 he says in tra
[1:28:38] that's Abraham's dad lived 70 years and
[1:28:40] beg got Abram nahor and Heron so
[1:28:43] remember Abram nahor and Heron those are
[1:28:46] the three brothers uh three sons of Tara
[1:28:49] Genesis 24 and the servant took 10
[1:28:51] camels of the camels of his master and
[1:28:54] parted for all the goods of his Masters
[1:28:56] were in his hand and he arose and went
[1:28:58] to Mesopotamia into the city of nahor
[1:29:01] where did he go he went right back to
[1:29:04] the city of Abraham's
[1:29:06] brother nahor is Abraham's
[1:29:09] brother and it came to pass before he
[1:29:12] had done speaking that behold Rebecca
[1:29:13] came out who was born to Bethell son of
[1:29:16] milka the wife of nahor Abraham's
[1:29:19] brother with her pitcher over her
[1:29:21] shoulder so here comes a granddaughter
[1:29:25] of nahor Abraham's brother his great
[1:29:29] niece Isaac's first cousin once
[1:29:34] removed this is what Abraham wanted he
[1:29:37] did not want a Canaanite he didn't want
[1:29:39] he wanted to go back to his
[1:29:41] Kindred because it mattered this was
[1:29:44] going to be the promised seed line it
[1:29:46] mattered how the seed came
[1:29:49] forth God wrote these things
[1:29:52] intentionally Genesis 24:2 9 and Rebecca
[1:29:54] had a brother and his name was laan and
[1:29:56] Laban ran out into the man un the well
[1:29:59] so Rebecca had a brother named laan
[1:30:02] laan oh my goodness laan all right let's
[1:30:07] back up for a minute see this born
[1:30:09] Bethell son of milka milka was the
[1:30:11] mother the wife of nahor nahor is
[1:30:14] Abraham's brother he takes a wife milka
[1:30:17] milka is the daughter of Haron do you
[1:30:20] know who Haron is the other brother
[1:30:25] amen this is a family
[1:30:28] affair amen I was going to say something
[1:30:30] mean about West Virginia but I
[1:30:33] won't because I have brothers I love
[1:30:40] here you have to forgive me anyways
[1:30:42] Brothers I love
[1:30:44] you and Rebecca and his brother and his
[1:30:46] name was laan and laan ran out into the
[1:30:48] men unto the well now this is laan
[1:30:51] Rebecca's brother but now we find
[1:30:54] as Jacob now Isaac's son is sent back he
[1:30:57] goes back to laan Rebecca his mother's
[1:31:00] brother and laan said unto Jacob because
[1:31:02] Thou Art my brother shouldest thou
[1:31:03] therefore serve me for not tell me what
[1:31:06] shall be thy wages so we know he asked
[1:31:08] for Rachel and Rachel is laan's daughter
[1:31:11] so he marries his first
[1:31:13] cousin don't say
[1:31:16] yuck this is the word of
[1:31:20] God why because this was the lineage of
[1:31:24] Abraham it mattered who they married it
[1:31:27] mattered that that wound was virgin it
[1:31:29] mattered that it was of the same family
[1:31:31] it mattered that they found a match that
[1:31:33] Rec could reproduce the life of Abraham
[1:31:35] reproduce the life of Isaac do you
[1:31:37] understand what I'm saying this is all
[1:31:39] typology but but we want to type it but
[1:31:42] when we get to the Song of Solomon he
[1:31:44] says Thou Hast ravished my heart my
[1:31:46] sister my
[1:31:48] spouse what is this this is a Love Song
[1:31:50] of Solomon it's typing the relationship
[1:31:52] between Christ and his bride thou has
[1:31:55] ravaged my heart my sister my spouse
[1:31:58] thou has ravaged my heart with one of
[1:32:00] thine eyes with one chain of thy neck
[1:32:03] amen who was he ravaged by his sister
[1:32:06] who was his spouse amen what did Jesus
[1:32:09] say when he resurrected from the dead he
[1:32:11] told him he said go tell Peter and my
[1:32:13] disciples amen that I go into Galilee
[1:32:15] and I meet them that I go unto my father
[1:32:18] and to your father you mean you have the
[1:32:21] same father he's Christ the husband
[1:32:23] you're the bride who's your father you
[1:32:26] have the same father just like Abraham
[1:32:28] and Sarah had because it matters who
[1:32:31] brings forth this life it matters the
[1:32:33] womb it matters that there's a match
[1:32:36] there has to be a match amen so I'm
[1:32:38] telling you Brothers you need to find
[1:32:40] for yourself a match one that matches
[1:32:42] your desire to serve the Lord one that
[1:32:44] matches your nature one that reflects
[1:32:46] what's on the inside of you because
[1:32:48] that's exactly what Jesus Christ was
[1:32:50] doing that's what God did Through the
[1:32:51] Bible to protect the seed that's what
[1:32:53] he's doing right now to bring forth the
[1:32:55] seed of Christ he has to find his match
[1:32:59] amen and listen you young Brothers amen
[1:33:01] find your match don't just find a pretty
[1:33:03] face you talk to that girl till you
[1:33:05] found someone that reflects what's
[1:33:07] inside of you amen who is your
[1:33:09] reflection on the inside because why
[1:33:11] she's not only going to bring forth your
[1:33:13] children she's going to help you nurture
[1:33:15] them children Amen to be your preny upon
[1:33:18] the Earth that God has commissioned you
[1:33:20] to raise in the nurture and ammonition
[1:33:22] of the Lord and if she disrespects the
[1:33:25] word if she disrespects her father if
[1:33:27] she disrespects headship if she has her
[1:33:29] own ideas and she wants to have the
[1:33:31] glory and she's the one who's always
[1:33:33] talking about herself and she's got to
[1:33:35] have the greatest story and look the
[1:33:37] prettiest and be the best then you run
[1:33:39] away from that girl because she's not
[1:33:41] going to Humble herself down to raise
[1:33:43] your children your way according to your
[1:33:47] idea the whole idea of submission is not
[1:33:50] about men dominating female it's about
[1:33:53] the the very type and natural of what
[1:33:55] God is doing the life comes through the
[1:33:57] mail amen and it has to be according to
[1:34:00] his desire his mind his wishes his home
[1:34:03] has to come under his leadership because
[1:34:05] the life is passing through him she has
[1:34:07] to surrender her ideas to come in line
[1:34:10] with his idea for a family amen to match
[1:34:13] the
[1:34:14] Bible it's not just saying women be
[1:34:17] submissive to your husbands my goodness
[1:34:18] that's a good way to build a whole pile
[1:34:20] of frustration is try to force that it's
[1:34:22] better to catch the V vision of what
[1:34:24] God's doing and what you're doing as a
[1:34:26] woman you're reproducing your husband on
[1:34:28] the
[1:34:29] earth and in doing so you get loads of
[1:34:33] benefits because those children will
[1:34:35] rise up and call you blessed they will
[1:34:37] become your caretakers amen they will be
[1:34:40] they're part of you also and they will
[1:34:42] be your strength in your old
[1:34:46] age don't look for the one that has to
[1:34:49] have her own way and is always right and
[1:34:52] has to shop for hours on Amazon to find
[1:34:55] the newest fashion and the greatest
[1:34:56] thing and look the best when she comes
[1:34:57] to church her focus is in the wrong
[1:35:01] place you want one that reflects unless
[1:35:04] that's what you really
[1:35:08] are unless you're not submissive to the
[1:35:11] word unless you want your own way unless
[1:35:12] you like your own then maybe that's the
[1:35:15] right one for you sir remember brother
[1:35:17] brandham did two weddings that he talked
[1:35:19] about and in those two weddings one was
[1:35:21] the rich couple that they married and
[1:35:22] the other was a poor couple and he talks
[1:35:24] about they're married by the same
[1:35:26] ceremony and he goes to visit them and
[1:35:27] when he goes to the rich couple they're
[1:35:29] fighting they're jealous of one another
[1:35:32] she was a beauty queen they were both
[1:35:34] Rich spoiled children they had
[1:35:35] everything handed to them meaning they
[1:35:36] had no character they had no
[1:35:38] self-discipline they had an overinflated
[1:35:40] value of
[1:35:42] themselves they were the ones that got
[1:35:45] all the participation trophies for no
[1:35:49] reason no character
[1:35:54] and brother R comes and sees them
[1:35:55] fighting because they were at a dance
[1:35:57] and she's a pretty girl and she danced
[1:35:59] with another boy or he did or something
[1:36:01] or another they were arguing with each
[1:36:03] other amen and and when brother renam
[1:36:05] came to the door they put on a facade a
[1:36:07] show that they were fine and happy but
[1:36:08] he'd already heard him fighting but then
[1:36:10] he slips up to those in the Box car and
[1:36:13] he finds them to in a discussion and
[1:36:16] he's saying oh honey I wanted to buy for
[1:36:17] you so bad she goes that's all right
[1:36:19] I've got a dress and he discerns that
[1:36:22] they they were counting out their money
[1:36:23] looked through the crack in the door and
[1:36:24] they were counting so much for insurance
[1:36:26] so much for gas so much for groceries
[1:36:28] they didn't have enough money left over
[1:36:30] but he saw a dress in a department store
[1:36:32] window and he wanted to buy it for
[1:36:35] her what is this man
[1:36:38] self-sacrificing putting her first
[1:36:41] wanting to please her and do something
[1:36:43] special for her with this limited amount
[1:36:45] of money amen and now listen she goes
[1:36:49] she goes that's all right I've got a
[1:36:51] dress I don't really need one praise God
[1:36:55] what was she doing she was reflecting
[1:36:57] what was inside of him he chose a bride
[1:37:00] that reflected his character then
[1:37:03] brother brand looked up on the hill
[1:37:04] where those two were fussing and
[1:37:05] fighting he said William brandham who's
[1:37:08] the rich man anyways where would you
[1:37:10] rather be which one would you take he
[1:37:12] said I would take this character down
[1:37:13] here in the Box car before that beauty
[1:37:15] queen up there why that man up there
[1:37:18] married the one that reflected what was
[1:37:20] in him the one down in the Box Car
[1:37:22] married the one that reflected what what
[1:37:23] was in him and Jesus Christ is only
[1:37:26] going to marry the bride that's
[1:37:27] reflecting what's inside of him not the
[1:37:30] beauty queen not the know- it all not
[1:37:33] the one who's bambas and argumentative
[1:37:35] and proud he's going to marry the one
[1:37:37] that reflects what's inside of
[1:37:40] him praise be to God the natural types
[1:37:42] the spiritual
[1:37:44] friends
[1:37:46] so he's going to marry Jesus is going to
[1:37:50] marry his match
[1:37:53] you should marry your
[1:37:57] match oh my goodness this is so
[1:38:00] important all of these things brother B
[1:38:02] said they now they're so
[1:38:04] significant and they're so
[1:38:09] important he says now in the Masterpiece
[1:38:11] notice the bride if the bride in the
[1:38:13] beginning was the word or the bridegroom
[1:38:17] and then if the bride is taken from the
[1:38:18] bridegroom it must be the word also know
[1:38:22] the bride must be why why must the
[1:38:25] bridegroom be the word manifested made
[1:38:26] plain is because the bride and the
[1:38:28] bridegroom are one she is just a smitten
[1:38:31] piece off of him there is the
[1:38:35] Masterpiece praise be to God there is
[1:38:38] the Masterpiece what is it it's she's
[1:38:40] part of him part of his life part of his
[1:38:43] nature what was his nature I only do
[1:38:46] that which the father shows me he was
[1:38:48] absolutely submissive to his headship
[1:38:50] the father what's he looking for he's
[1:38:52] looking for a bride that is just like
[1:38:55] him who's absolutely submissive to her
[1:38:57] headship Christ the word he's not going
[1:39:00] to take one in Rebellion that's why he
[1:39:02] cannot take a denominational bride she's
[1:39:04] in Rebellion to the word she has taken
[1:39:06] her own idea on how to raise these
[1:39:09] children amen called The Church the
[1:39:13] converts she takes her own idea on
[1:39:15] what's right and not right on what we
[1:39:17] should and shouldn't do and what's
[1:39:18] allowed and not allowed this is a this
[1:39:20] is a woman the denominational woman is a
[1:39:22] woman whose husband lays down the law
[1:39:25] says how he wants his home we want to be
[1:39:27] submissive to the word of God we do this
[1:39:29] we don't do that and as soon as Dad gone
[1:39:31] to work mother G gathers the children
[1:39:33] around and says listen I know that Dad
[1:39:36] doesn't understand but I understand so
[1:39:38] I'm going to let you do this let's just
[1:39:40] not tell Dad it'll be okay I'll talk to
[1:39:43] Dad it'll be okay that's the
[1:39:45] denominational spirit and and sisters if
[1:39:48] you've got that in your home that's a
[1:39:49] denominational Spirit and the Very seeds
[1:39:52] of Jezebel
[1:39:56] Catholicism so wrong that's why I thank
[1:39:59] God Amen to live in a midst of sisters
[1:40:02] and brothers who model Christ in his
[1:40:04] church you see the families coming to
[1:40:05] church you see the homes in harmony you
[1:40:07] see the husbands and wives listen it
[1:40:09] doesn't mean we don't have problems
[1:40:10] we're in flesh we're in hybridized flesh
[1:40:12] we have sticky culber nature but we keep
[1:40:15] surrendering to the word and keep
[1:40:16] surrendering to the word and keep
[1:40:18] reflecting the right kind of life and
[1:40:20] that's why I love to be in fellowship
[1:40:22] with brothers and sisters to surrender
[1:40:23] to the word and he'll take this very
[1:40:25] image of Christ and his bride and flesh
[1:40:27] it out every
[1:40:29] day Christ sacrificing for his bride the
[1:40:32] bride laying down her own will and life
[1:40:34] for
[1:40:35] him
[1:40:37] amen a husband who will sacrifice
[1:40:40] himself for his family and give of
[1:40:42] himself give the best that he has give
[1:40:45] all the time and a and a wife who will
[1:40:47] surrender herself to the headship of her
[1:40:49] husband where they're both giving both
[1:40:52] sacrificing both
[1:40:54] loving that's a picture of Christ in his
[1:40:57] bride remember we love him
[1:41:00] because he first loved
[1:41:03] us you can't demand love you only give
[1:41:07] love and love
[1:41:09] reciprocates Husband must tenderly care
[1:41:12] for his wife and she'll
[1:41:15] reciprocate love his children they'll
[1:41:18] reciprocate you don't get submission by
[1:41:20] force you don't get it by quoting
[1:41:21] scriptures
[1:41:24] you don't get it by brow
[1:41:26] beating you get it by acting the part of
[1:41:29] Jesus
[1:41:30] Christ so that your wife can play the
[1:41:32] part of the
[1:41:34] Bride that's how it
[1:41:36] works we want to demand listen sometimes
[1:41:41] sometimes those will want to
[1:41:43] demand everything that a church should
[1:41:46] be to Christ they want their wives to be
[1:41:48] to them but they're nothing that Christ
[1:41:50] is to the church they're none of that to
[1:41:51] their wife amen how is that right how
[1:41:55] can you demand that your wife is
[1:41:58] everything the church is to Christ but
[1:42:00] you're nothing that Christ is to your
[1:42:02] wife listen Christ died for his wife
[1:42:05] when she was guilty when she was in sin
[1:42:07] before she repented he gave his whole
[1:42:10] life for her he was spit on for her
[1:42:12] mocked for her ridiculed falsely accused
[1:42:15] and he did it all for her then he gives
[1:42:17] her and showers her with blessings and
[1:42:19] pours out his life for her and
[1:42:20] continually keeps her in everything that
[1:42:22] she needs
[1:42:25] and she in return lays down her life for
[1:42:28] him you see and and wives you we can't
[1:42:31] you can't ask your husbands to be
[1:42:33] everything that Christ is to the church
[1:42:34] unless you're also what the bride is to
[1:42:37] Christ submissive and humble and and
[1:42:40] taking the headship of the word and
[1:42:42] yielding your life and your ideas and
[1:42:44] all your con and surrendering it to
[1:42:47] him it works both ways because the
[1:42:50] spiritual and the natural type one
[1:42:52] another
[1:42:54] and the principle just
[1:42:56] works so we see this lioness this queen
[1:42:59] of the
[1:43:01] lion and she's interested in something
[1:43:04] now this is this is real pictures this
[1:43:05] really happened we were really parked
[1:43:07] here on the road and we saw her looking
[1:43:10] back and she was she had an interest
[1:43:13] we'll find out what her interest is
[1:43:17] shortly marriage and divorce brother
[1:43:19] then said now look in the final analysis
[1:43:21] look there is one Jesus Jesus Christ is
[1:43:24] that right one man God Emanuel do you
[1:43:26] believe that but the members of his wife
[1:43:29] are many see thousand times thousands of
[1:43:31] thousands is that right his wife the
[1:43:33] bride the church you understand now
[1:43:36] that's why he said to Adam before sex
[1:43:38] was ever induced or introduced
[1:43:40] multiplied to replenish the earth when
[1:43:42] he was yet in the beginning when he was
[1:43:44] yet both male and female in himself
[1:43:46] there shows then that the bride was has
[1:43:49] got to come from the word by spiritual
[1:43:52] multiplication
[1:43:54] multiplications see replenish the earth
[1:43:57] now now don't let your mind wander and
[1:44:00] try to piece together things that we're
[1:44:02] not talking about right now how things
[1:44:04] happen everything happened exactly the
[1:44:05] way it was intended to
[1:44:07] happen then you could say I we I talked
[1:44:09] to you this before but listen don't
[1:44:13] dispute over genealogies that bring
[1:44:15] nothing but
[1:44:16] Strife there's no point in talking about
[1:44:19] it everything happened exactly as it was
[1:44:22] intended to happen
[1:44:23] in the mind of God so we can speculate
[1:44:26] all we want on what would have happened
[1:44:27] but all that's still going to do is
[1:44:29] gender Strife CU somebody else will have
[1:44:31] another idea and all that we do know is
[1:44:33] what happened brother R says a lot of
[1:44:36] things and I've read them all amen and I
[1:44:38] believe them all I just don't know how
[1:44:39] they all fit together but that's okay I
[1:44:41] know what happened and that's what was
[1:44:43] important to us to know what happened so
[1:44:46] that we know where why we're here so now
[1:44:48] brother bandham is going back to the
[1:44:49] original command that was given to Adam
[1:44:52] and that original command man was given
[1:44:53] while he was in spirit form amen before
[1:44:56] he was in flesh and that Spirit form
[1:44:58] said multiply and replenish while he was
[1:45:00] in spirit form before he came to flesh
[1:45:02] and that's why brother bam picks that up
[1:45:04] and he says shows then that the bride
[1:45:06] has got to come from the word by
[1:45:09] spiritual multiplication multiplication
[1:45:11] see what's he doing he's bringing it now
[1:45:14] to our age of spiritual
[1:45:17] birth listen this is not a discussion or
[1:45:19] an argument on how things were supposed
[1:45:21] to happen and what happened back there
[1:45:22] everything happen just fine it was wrong
[1:45:24] but it was
[1:45:26] right and and brought about God's
[1:45:28] permissive will okay are we are we agree
[1:45:31] that it was wrong but it was
[1:45:32] right all right but what brother bram's
[1:45:35] doing is going back to the original
[1:45:37] command and showing that it was a
[1:45:38] spiritual command in spiritual form now
[1:45:41] we're fast forwarding all the way
[1:45:43] thousands of years and now we've come to
[1:45:45] the time of not natural birth and
[1:45:47] natural lineage now we've come to the
[1:45:49] time of spiritual birth and spiritual
[1:45:52] lineage and spiritual bloodline and when
[1:45:55] you come to the spiritual you go back to
[1:45:57] the original command which is what
[1:45:58] brother bandham said and said now the
[1:46:00] bride's not coming forth because two
[1:46:02] bride members get married and they
[1:46:04] produce more bride that's not how
[1:46:06] they're coming forth they're coming
[1:46:07] forth by spiritual multiplication by the
[1:46:10] word by receiving the word and
[1:46:12] conceiving on the word and bringing
[1:46:14] forth the word now this is spiritual
[1:46:17] birth this is the new
[1:46:20] birth amen
[1:46:23] praise be to God so now what's bringing
[1:46:27] forth the seedline now what's bringing
[1:46:29] forth the bride now what's bringing
[1:46:32] forth the progeny now it's the word amen
[1:46:35] it's the word that's bringing forth the
[1:46:37] spiritual multiplication of God's seed
[1:46:39] upon the Earth right now by what by the
[1:46:42] bride taking the word carrying the word
[1:46:44] preaching the word brother brandom said
[1:46:46] will the bride have a Ministry in the
[1:46:47] end time he said yes have a great
[1:46:49] ministry it's going on now it consists
[1:46:51] of Apostles prophet pastors evangelist
[1:46:53] teachers what is that preaching the word
[1:46:56] what is the great ministry in the end
[1:46:58] time preaching this revealed word
[1:47:00] because now the children of God are
[1:47:02] being born by spiritual New Birth by
[1:47:05] spiritual
[1:47:07] multiplication by the
[1:47:09] word that's how Jesus came through Mary
[1:47:12] that's how the children are coming
[1:47:14] now prise
[1:47:17] God praise be to God this message is not
[1:47:21] to argue over and prove how much you
[1:47:22] know and fight with quotes catch the
[1:47:25] principle what is he trying to tell us
[1:47:28] he's trying to tell us that we've come
[1:47:29] to spiritual birth why what by the
[1:47:32] spoken word the word has been restored
[1:47:35] the word is being preached the word is
[1:47:37] being spoke and that word is reproducing
[1:47:40] the seed of Christ on the earth in Bride
[1:47:43] form the many membered
[1:47:45] bride so remember this lius was looking
[1:47:48] at something all we had to wait was a
[1:47:51] few minutes and see what she was
[1:47:52] watching
[1:47:55] she was watching for the
[1:47:58] seed watching over the seed protecting
[1:48:02] the seed feeding the seed guarding the
[1:48:06] seed what is the job of the Bride
[1:48:09] now to replicate Christ upon the Earth
[1:48:13] amen by what by spiritual
[1:48:16] multiplication by how by preaching the
[1:48:18] revealed word of the hour which is
[1:48:22] Christ
[1:48:24] that's sowing the seed of Christ and
[1:48:27] then what does it do it brings forth
[1:48:31] another
[1:48:32] Christ another child of God another word
[1:48:36] made
[1:48:37] manifest and now what does the church do
[1:48:40] the same thing the lionist does she's
[1:48:42] there to guard protect feed nurture and
[1:48:48] bring this
[1:48:49] seed to maturity
[1:48:52] what are we here for we're here to
[1:48:56] reproduce Christ on the
[1:48:58] earth how do I reproduce Christ on the
[1:49:01] earth amen by sowing the seed of the
[1:49:04] word first by surrendering myself to his
[1:49:06] headship and letting him come in and
[1:49:08] Unite with him and impregnate me and
[1:49:09] bring his life out of
[1:49:11] me and then I take that life that comes
[1:49:14] from his word and I preach the the
[1:49:17] word and when the word Goes Forth and
[1:49:20] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:22] the Spirit of the word strikes the seed
[1:49:24] in the soul and New Birth takes place
[1:49:27] what is that that's another of the
[1:49:29] Christ seed coming
[1:49:31] forth then now as his bride what are we
[1:49:33] here to do we're here to raise those
[1:49:35] children in the nurture and admonition
[1:49:37] of the
[1:49:38] Lord why how the same way a good wife
[1:49:43] does to her husband by forsaking our
[1:49:45] ideas our Ambitions our wants our
[1:49:49] thoughts on the word and what do we do
[1:49:51] we stay with our husband our bridegroom
[1:49:54] the revealed word this is how he wants
[1:49:57] it done this is what daddy said this is
[1:49:59] how daddy wants us to live this is what
[1:50:01] he said about this situation that's how
[1:50:03] we bring them up not by taking our own
[1:50:06] church
[1:50:07] idea that's
[1:50:09] denominationalism but by surrendering
[1:50:11] all of our ideas and staying true to the
[1:50:14] word creating a nurturing atmosphere
[1:50:16] where people can grow into the very
[1:50:19] stature of a perfect man into the
[1:50:21] likeness of Jesus
[1:50:23] Christ that's what we're supposed to be
[1:50:25] doing in this end
[1:50:27] time
[1:50:31] amen this little
[1:50:35] guy is the seed coming
[1:50:38] forth choosing from a bride he said the
[1:50:40] True Church of Christ the bride is so
[1:50:42] sold out to him in his promised word
[1:50:44] till the very mind that's in Christ is
[1:50:46] in you what a different when we find
[1:50:50] today that the modern Church a modern
[1:50:52] World Church Church the modern world
[1:50:53] church and also the spiritual church are
[1:50:56] both pregnated to give birth to sons and
[1:50:59] one of them a denominational birth is
[1:51:00] going to be give one day to these days
[1:51:03] at the World Council of churches which
[1:51:05] will produce the world to the world the
[1:51:07] Antichrist through a
[1:51:09] denomination that's exactly the truth I
[1:51:12] may not live to see it I believe I will
[1:51:14] but you young people remember that you
[1:51:15] heard a minister say that that'll
[1:51:17] finally wind up and that is the mark of
[1:51:19] the beast when she forms the World
[1:51:21] Council of churches and she'll give
[1:51:23] birth to her son Antichrist so now
[1:51:25] there's been two impregnations of two
[1:51:27] different women one the denominational
[1:51:29] systems and one the bride of Christ the
[1:51:31] denominational system is going to bring
[1:51:33] forth what the
[1:51:35] Antichrist but he says the other is
[1:51:38] pregnated by the word of God and will
[1:51:40] bring forth the body the finished body
[1:51:43] of Jesus Christ which is the
[1:51:46] bride the body of Christ how will she
[1:51:48] come forth by spiritual
[1:51:50] multiplication by nurture in the Lord by
[1:51:53] bringing him up in the word amen which
[1:51:54] is the bride the body of Christ isn't
[1:51:57] finished yet how many knows that a man
[1:51:59] and woman is one in Christ and Christ is
[1:52:02] one body the word the bride will have to
[1:52:04] be the rest of the body and the two
[1:52:06] together makes one body again like Adam
[1:52:09] was at the beginning man his wife are
[1:52:11] one now she the true bride so sold out
[1:52:14] to him that she uses no mind of her own
[1:52:17] his mind of course is his will and his
[1:52:19] will is his word so how do we bring
[1:52:22] bring forth the seed amen by spiritual
[1:52:24] multiplication by speaking the word and
[1:52:26] living the word then how do we nurture
[1:52:29] those children bring them up by the
[1:52:31] revealed word that's been restored in
[1:52:33] our hour by keeping the atmosphere in
[1:52:36] the church true to the word by
[1:52:39] surrendering all of our own
[1:52:42] ideas and that little seed one day will
[1:52:44] grow up to be another male lion this was
[1:52:47] another young one just coming into
[1:52:49] adolescence amen fathers this is what
[1:52:52] you're trying to do you're trying to
[1:52:54] reproduce yourself if there is another
[1:52:57] generation you want a son that can lead
[1:52:59] his family and serve God and raise his
[1:53:01] children in the fear nurturing
[1:53:03] ammonition of the Lord this this that
[1:53:06] young male lion one day is going to have
[1:53:08] to go make it on his
[1:53:09] own spoken words the original City he
[1:53:12] said that's what's the matter today you
[1:53:13] want you want some kind of a phony
[1:53:15] makeup with screaming jumping speaking
[1:53:17] in tongues or something instead of
[1:53:19] waiting for the real word of God to be
[1:53:21] made manifest through to the bride them
[1:53:24] kind that takes the word is God's true
[1:53:26] bride bringing forth children they can't
[1:53:30] die a child the bride brings forth on
[1:53:33] the word can't
[1:53:35] die because it's the word amen did you
[1:53:38] get it she can't die that child can't
[1:53:41] die because he's a word child he's a
[1:53:44] seed child he's an eternal child
[1:53:47] Hallelujah that's exactly what Jesus
[1:53:49] Christ was a spoken Eternal child
[1:53:53] what was Jesus he was a spoken word
[1:53:56] spoken where into the womb of the Virgin
[1:53:58] Mary he was a spoken word seed of God
[1:54:01] Adam was a spoken word seed of God but
[1:54:03] now brother bram's bringing it all the
[1:54:04] way back here and saying through
[1:54:06] spiritual multiplication they're
[1:54:08] becoming they're becoming a word child
[1:54:11] he's a seed child he's an eternal child
[1:54:14] amen by what by the
[1:54:16] word praise
[1:54:18] God who's our husband the revealed word
[1:54:23] who are we true to the
[1:54:25] word who do we live for the word who
[1:54:28] would he surrender to this
[1:54:32] word this little guy not so little
[1:54:34] anymore but he's going to have to go
[1:54:37] start his own family he's going to have
[1:54:39] to find luses that match what's inside
[1:54:41] of him so that he can do again what was
[1:54:44] done oh I say God help us to continue to
[1:54:48] do what he started in this earth Lord
[1:54:53] am then the family caught them as they
[1:54:56] wandered off the road and went walking
[1:54:58] away to do what what were they going off
[1:55:01] to do to keep the seed line coming
[1:55:04] forth to keep the seed of the male
[1:55:07] coming to keep it strong and healthy and
[1:55:09] fed and protected
[1:55:11] and what are we here
[1:55:13] for the exact same purpose we're here to
[1:55:18] manifest Christ we're here to preach the
[1:55:21] true word we're here here to bring forth
[1:55:23] Children of the word because a child
[1:55:27] that's brought forth on the word can't
[1:55:30] die it's a seed child it's an eternal
[1:55:34] child not
[1:55:36] hybridization but the true word that's
[1:55:38] been restored back into our hands in
[1:55:40] this generation it'll bring forth seed
[1:55:43] children of
[1:55:45] Christ I'd like to finish with this
[1:55:48] scripture Psalms 128 1-4
[1:55:52] blessed is everyone that feareth the
[1:55:54] Lord that walketh in his ways for Thou
[1:55:57] shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy
[1:55:59] shalt thou be and it shall be well with
[1:56:01] thee thy wife shall be as a fruitful
[1:56:03] Vine by the sides of thine house thy
[1:56:06] children like Olive plants round about
[1:56:08] the table behold that thus shall the man
[1:56:11] be blessed that feareth the
[1:56:14] lord it's a principle of God it's a
[1:56:18] principle natural it's a principle
[1:56:20] spiritual you know what I want to be I
[1:56:23] want to be the bride that says be it
[1:56:25] unto me according to your
[1:56:27] word I really really don't want my own
[1:56:31] ideas you know what I'm trying to do
[1:56:32] every day is die out to myself I'm
[1:56:35] trying to let the word wash out every
[1:56:38] bit of wrong understanding I've picked
[1:56:39] up through science and education and
[1:56:41] church tradition because what I want to
[1:56:44] be is a bride that reflects the inside
[1:56:47] of Christ that's the bride that he's
[1:56:49] choosing I don't want my own ambition
[1:56:52] ition in this life Lord please help me
[1:56:54] get rid of
[1:56:56] ambition please help me get rid of want
[1:56:59] for anything except Christ amen listen
[1:57:02] it's a struggle friends because we're
[1:57:03] born hybrid and have a sticky cocko bur
[1:57:05] nature but that's my struggle my
[1:57:07] struggle is I want to get rid of self
[1:57:10] yes Lord so that I can be the right kind
[1:57:11] of bride that I can be submissive and
[1:57:14] yielded and I can be a help
[1:57:16] meet that Christ can use to manifest
[1:57:20] himself it's not what we can do we can't
[1:57:23] do anything any more than Mary could do
[1:57:25] it but he's promised that he would
[1:57:27] fulfill in this day all that was spoken
[1:57:29] in the Virgin Mary he's going to do the
[1:57:31] same thing today and he will come in the
[1:57:34] appointed time and he will fulfill his
[1:57:36] promise why because she believed amen
[1:57:40] the word Lord Lord I believe your word
[1:57:44] come and fulfill your word in me in this
[1:57:48] promised hour and use these lips to keep
[1:57:51] sewing the seed of the word to bring
[1:57:54] spiritual multiplication somewhere to
[1:57:57] your seed line God bless you friends
[1:57:59] let's
[1:58:01] stand
[1:58:03] amen praise be to
[1:58:06] God
[1:58:08] oh so many truths are revealed musicians
[1:58:13] if you'll come brother John if you'll
[1:58:14] come so many truths have been revealed
[1:58:17] to us the great mystery that was in God
[1:58:21] now all the pr preaching and the
[1:58:22] doctrines and the and the and the
[1:58:24] scoldings of the Prophet they all make
[1:58:27] sense they all now we're understand why
[1:58:29] why submission why humility why was he
[1:58:33] preaching on a woman's place and I mean
[1:58:35] he would say such harsh things that when
[1:58:36] a woman gets out of the kitchen she's
[1:58:38] out of her place I mean it seems so
[1:58:40] harsh why was he talking about how
[1:58:42] degradating it was to have women on the
[1:58:44] police force in a certain city taking a
[1:58:46] man's job taking a man's Place why was
[1:58:48] he screaming against the fashions that
[1:58:50] that that would bring a woman to look
[1:58:52] like or dress like a man in any way why
[1:58:55] was he screaming about the haircuts why
[1:58:57] what was he screaming about he was
[1:58:59] trying to show us amen that what's
[1:59:01] happening naturally is happening
[1:59:02] spiritually that it's not right
[1:59:04] according to the
[1:59:07] word it's not about checking a check
[1:59:10] boox I'm submissed to my husband it's
[1:59:12] about living the word it's about
[1:59:14] fleshing out the role of the
[1:59:16] Bride it's not about a man just taking
[1:59:19] leadership so I can say I took
[1:59:20] leadership in my home and you know I I I
[1:59:22] worked hard for them and I and I won
[1:59:24] bread no it's it's about fulfilling the
[1:59:27] word in your home
[1:59:29] amen now this whole thing what the
[1:59:31] prophet taught us was right it wasn't
[1:59:33] right for 1950 19 it was right for the
[1:59:36] bride it was right for the word it was
[1:59:39] right for those who were progeny of the
[1:59:40] word it was right for those who were
[1:59:42] going to flesh out and live the word and
[1:59:44] manifest the word it was right for the
[1:59:46] word it wasn't right for a
[1:59:50] generation what he says about marriage
[1:59:53] and marriage and divorce and interracial
[1:59:55] marriage and what he says about a role
[1:59:57] of a wife and a role of a woman and
[1:59:59] dress and conduct it was right because
[2:00:01] it was right in line with the theme of
[2:00:04] the whole
[2:00:05] word it wasn't right for his day it was
[2:00:09] right for the bride if I'm part of the
[2:00:12] Bride it's still right for my
[2:00:15] day why cuz I don't want to take my own
[2:00:17] idea and my own thought and I don't want
[2:00:21] to be the kind of woman that when dad's
[2:00:23] not looking says it's okay I
[2:00:27] understand I understand I was born in
[2:00:30] flesh too I understand I got a C ber I
[2:00:33] understand but what I understand more is
[2:00:35] the only right way is the word way and
[2:00:38] that's our headship and we're staying
[2:00:39] with the
[2:00:40] word amen let's bow our heads and pray
[2:00:44] together there Heavenly Father we thank
[2:00:47] you
[2:00:48] Lord cuz you are so
[2:00:50] amazing you're word runs so deep Lord
[2:00:54] deeper than we ever
[2:00:56] imagined what we saw Lord as
[2:00:58] Commandments or maybe
[2:01:00] Corrections it was actually your mind it
[2:01:04] was your desire it was actually you
[2:01:08] wanting to be fleshed
[2:01:10] out God and we're so sorry Lord for what
[2:01:13] we've done with the word we're so sorry
[2:01:16] Lord for the way we've rejected what
[2:01:18] you've brought us through a prophet
[2:01:20] we're so sorry for the excuse es we've
[2:01:22] made and the compromises I'm sorry Lord
[2:01:26] sorry for
[2:01:27] questioning Lord I I truly was
[2:01:31] ignorant Lord and I didn't understand
[2:01:35] but oh God as you rub the eyes saav and
[2:01:37] our eyes were beginning to see like
[2:01:38] we've never seen
[2:01:40] before this goes so much deeper than we
[2:01:43] thought God this wasn't a prophet who
[2:01:46] was born in a different age crying out
[2:01:48] against
[2:01:49] modernism that wasn't it it was your
[2:01:52] voice calling your bride into action to
[2:01:55] be your reflection on this Earth it was
[2:01:58] you Lord sharing what was inside of you
[2:02:01] to see if there was a woman that would

[2:05:07] amen man just before we sing I'd like to
[2:05:10] say you
[2:05:13] know the message sometimes is
[2:05:16] rough it's raw it's straight it's honest
[2:05:20] yes
[2:05:22] talks about like I said the degradation
[2:05:24] of society when women entering the
[2:05:26] workforce wearing pants cutting their
[2:05:28] hair wearing makeup wearing uh uh scant
[2:05:33] being scantily clad and the fashions
[2:05:35] that were taking place in the 60s it was
[2:05:38] all screamed about and screamed about in
[2:05:39] a harsh way and it was said straight and
[2:05:42] it was said bold and it was said without
[2:05:46] apologies he screaming against
[2:05:48] denominations and against taking your
[2:05:50] own idea and against false doctrines and
[2:05:53] I mean just blasting
[2:05:56] it and if I had it to say and had use my
[2:05:59] own nature and I would probably try to
[2:06:01] soften it and I would probably I would
[2:06:03] probably try to doctor it up and that's
[2:06:06] why God didn't use me for that job amen
[2:06:08] cuz I would have
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:12] failed but what was God
[2:06:16] doing he was looking for a bride that
[2:06:19] would reflect what was inside of him
[2:06:22] am what was he what kind of bride did he
[2:06:24] want he wanted a bride that would hear
[2:06:27] Brother bham scream
[2:06:29] out that if you dress yourself that way
[2:06:32] and cause a man to commit uh uh uh
[2:06:35] adultery in his mind with you then
[2:06:36] you're going to stand at the Judgment
[2:06:38] with you and be guilty of adultery he's
[2:06:40] looking for somebody to say forgive me
[2:06:41] God I'm
[2:06:42] sorry not say how dare he say that it
[2:06:45] was not my fault it was that man's
[2:06:47] fault cuz what was he looking for he was
[2:06:50] looking for somebody that reflected what
[2:06:51] was inside of him he would scream out
[2:06:54] about women becoming more masculine and
[2:06:57] taking on masculine roles in society and
[2:06:59] he wasn't looking for somebody to said
[2:07:01] well I have to I have to make ends me
[2:07:03] and I have to and this is a different
[2:07:04] age he wasn't looking for that he was
[2:07:05] looking for somebody to say I'm sorry
[2:07:07] Lord I didn't understand if that's what
[2:07:08] you want I'm going back home I'm
[2:07:11] changing my dress I'm changing my
[2:07:12] attitude I let my hair grow what's he
[2:07:14] looking for he screaming it out straight
[2:07:16] and bold through the mouth of a prophet
[2:07:18] why he's looking for his counterpart
[2:07:22] he's looking for the one that will
[2:07:23] surrender to the word not argue with it
[2:07:26] debate about it make excuses try to find
[2:07:29] loopholes or workarounds he's not
[2:07:31] looking for that kind of bride he's
[2:07:33] looking for a bride who will see a
[2:07:35] Vindicated Prophet who is the mouthpiece
[2:07:37] of God screaming against modernization
[2:07:40] and he was looking for somebody to say
[2:07:42] I'll take that as the truth I'll take
[2:07:44] that as from the Lord and I'll surrender
[2:07:46] and submit to it how a church should be
[2:07:48] conducted they'll say that's not the way
[2:07:50] I was raised but that's the truth and
[2:07:52] I'll take it that
[2:07:54] way that's why there's no apologies for
[2:07:57] the message being straight and bold and
[2:07:59] honest and true it was the very voice of
[2:08:02] God in our day what was he doing he was
[2:08:04] calling for a bride to come forth to
[2:08:07] come out of the filth to come out of the
[2:08:09] world Amen the one one who has the
[2:08:11] capacity to be like him what was it mean
[2:08:14] to be like him to only do that which my
[2:08:16] father shows me only what pleases the
[2:08:19] father is the only thing he'll do
[2:08:22] and he's looking for a bride who will
[2:08:23] take the same nature only what pleases
[2:08:26] my God is what I'll do if it's more
[2:08:29] pleasing for him that I do this versus
[2:08:31] that then I'll do what's more pleasing
[2:08:33] to
[2:08:34] him no
[2:08:36] apologies for the harshness of the
[2:08:38] message I won't apologize for it it was
[2:08:42] the voice of God no apology for the
[2:08:45] straightness no
[2:08:47] apologies it was needed to call out a
[2:08:50] bride the one who can say it's not the
[2:08:53] way I learned it and I don't always
[2:08:56] understand it but I'll surrender to
[2:09:00] that that's the ones he'll marry that's
[2:09:03] the ones that he'll impregnate that's
[2:09:05] the one that he'll entrust with his word
[2:09:06] to bring spiritual
[2:09:08] multiplication that's what he's looking
[2:09:10] for we don't need to make excuses for
[2:09:13] the message or the
[2:09:15] messenger what we need to do is say Lord
[2:09:18] be it unto me according to your word
[2:09:22] make me the reflection of what's on the
[2:09:25] inside of
[2:09:27] you listen young Brothers when you're
[2:09:29] looking for a
[2:09:30] wife look for the one that reflects
[2:09:33] what's inside of
[2:09:35] you you know I was talking the other day
[2:09:38] with my wife I think yesterday we're so
[2:09:42] different in so many
[2:09:43] ways she has different ways of handling
[2:09:46] situations different ways of reacting
[2:09:48] and I do it's like how can she be the
[2:09:51] reflection of me if we're so
[2:09:54] different but the reality is she's the
[2:09:57] feminine of
[2:09:59] me she is what is in me but that I can't
[2:10:03] produce on the outside of me but but I
[2:10:06] love it when it's produced in
[2:10:09] her amen she's the Fulfillment of me
[2:10:12] she's the completion of me she's the
[2:10:14] expression that I can't express in male
[2:10:17] but she can express in the gentleness
[2:10:19] and daintiness and femininity of a woman
[2:10:22] the nurturing and the caring and the
[2:10:24] tenderness that I as a man cannot seem
[2:10:26] to express but it's in me I love it I
[2:10:29] appreciate it I want it amen but God
[2:10:32] gave me a male expression but he gave me
[2:10:34] a female expression in my wife cuz the
[2:10:36] two have become one
[2:10:39] fles so don't look for your copy look
[2:10:43] for your
[2:10:44] reflection look for the girl amen who
[2:10:47] takes what's in your heart and makes it
[2:10:49] live the part that you can't she can't
[2:10:52] because Jesus Christ left a portion of
[2:10:54] his word that he didn't fulfill in his
[2:10:56] day he left a portion to be fulfilled in
[2:10:59] and through the bride the portion he
[2:11:01] didn't do which is bride form now he's
[2:11:03] doing in his reflection the bride form
[2:11:07] God Amen the natural types to spiritual
[2:11:10] if we just follow the truth of this
[2:11:12] message it'll guide us in every facet of
[2:11:15] Our Lives if we can just
[2:11:18] surrender and let the message be the
[2:11:21] truth truth yes stop fighting it or
[2:11:24] making just let it be true it'll change
[2:11:27] your whole
[2:11:28] life it'll bring forth the Life of
[2:11:32] Christ amen God bless you brother
[2:11:36] John here is
[2:11:39] love vast as the
[2:11:43] ocean loving
[2:11:46] kindness as the
[2:11:49] flood when the the
[2:11:52] Prince of Life our
[2:11:55] ransome shed for
[2:11:58] us his precious
[2:12:02] love who his
[2:12:05] love will not
