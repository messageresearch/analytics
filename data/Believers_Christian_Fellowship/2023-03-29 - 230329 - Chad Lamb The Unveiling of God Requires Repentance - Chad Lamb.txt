ourselves more to that than ever before may we see it grow in US Lord and may there be a greater manifestation in our lives than we've ever had before while we're looking to you and for your leadership in all things we pray you would provide it for us tonight tonight Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may God bless you while we're standing let's turn to the book of Acts if you don't mind and and I'd like to take for a subject the unveiling of the word requires repentance kind of a lengthy title the unveiling of the word requires repentance and this is something that came to me as I was uh I was I was actually I Was preparing for the water baptism message and something out of the book of Acts just struck me in a different way out of Acts 2 38 and I want to share that with you and it just began to open up for me and so I'm really excited to share it with you this evening so let's look at Acts chapter 2 verse 14. we know this is the day of Pentecost this is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost strikes the church amen and they spill into the street and and all those that were gathered for the Feast of Pentecost they were dwelling in Jerusalem and they began to hear them speak in their own language in multiple languages are mentioned there and it's a great sign and to the Jews but they they misunderstand they don't understand what this sign is so Peter stands up to preach the first message that was ever preached for a New Testament Church and this is what he says in verse 14. but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams amen God bless you as you take your seeds so the very first thing that happens when Peter full of the Holy Ghost amen stands up he stands up to address the crowd that is confused about the sign they're seeing and the first thing he begins to do is tie prophecy to Modern events amen so so Peter is preaching modern events made clear by prophecy so he says this is not what you suppose this is not what you're thinking this is what the prophet Joel spoke about this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears praise God so that's what he's doing and it's amazing that that's what the Holy Ghost would lead them to amen and and one of the one of the errors in uh the Pentecostal movement which brother Branham said they thought they had received the long-awaited uh Holy Ghost the return of the Holy Ghost but it really was the outpouring of the gifts amen because the Holy Ghost comes with the latter rain which was the message that was preached to us at the opening of the seals amen and the Holy Ghost comes and when he comes he does the same thing the Holy Ghost empowers a church to say this is that amen this is the Fulfillment of scripture amen so this is what Peter is doing on this great inaugural day of the church and then we'll skip down to verse 22. I just want to highlight a few portions here in Acts 2 22 he says ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God you have taken by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it for David speaketh concerning him now he's saying amen now you know Jesus Christ you know what happened amen because you men who are gathered here now you were gathered here under the Feast of unleavened bread amen because Moses had laid down a law that that all the males of Israel needed to present themselves to the Lord in Jerusalem at his Tabernacle or now the temple three times in a year amen in the Feast of Passover the Feast of unleavened bread and that's when Jesus was crucified and then now at the Feast of Weeks or the Feast of Pentecost Pentecost means we it means 50 means it's the Feast of Weeks seven weeks 50 days and then the Feast of Tabernacles so here now he's speaking through the crowd that was that was most likely would have been gathered amen under the Feast of 11 bread the Passover and he's speaking of Jesus Christ whom you know the Miracles the things that were done whom you know amen that he was crucified and raised again on the third day and we Are Witnesses and it was not possible that he should lay in the grave why because David said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption amen what's he doing he's taking modern events and tying it right back to the prophecy and he's once again saying this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what a message Peter is preaching he's bringing the he's bringing the Jews up to date with prophecy all the things that had been fulfilled was taking place that day and had taken place at the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ he's tying it all together with the Old Testament prophecies and then we we come over here he keeps talking about David and what David's prophecy what David said and Jesus fulfilling that and we come over here to verse 36. he says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so this is the scripture uh Acts 2 38 that you know is so fundamental to the teaching of water baptism and this is what I was spending some time meditating on when we preached on that last Friday but when I when I began to meditate on it it began to open and I begin to realize the crowd that Peter was speaking to because Peter was speaking to Devout Jews he was speaking to the the the the the chosen nation of God the people of God who had the word of God who were to be the Oracles of God to hold the word and show it forth and they were gathering together an obedience to the word that they had received and so these were religious Jews that had come together for the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost amen and they were coming to offer offerings of the Lord and to Worship the Lord and the place where the Lord told them to worship these were god-loving God-fearing Jews amen these were people who wanted to serve God and I think it's amazing that Peter says repent and be baptized he wasn't speaking to prostitutes gamblers he wasn't speaking to Liars he wasn't speaking to Chief he wasn't speaking when we think of repent and be baptized in Jesus name we're often thinking of the Harlot the the the the the liar amen the violent man the the the the the the promiscuous woman we're thinking of all of these things and of course anyone in that condition must repent also but when I looked at who he was speaking to amen and what then I began to ask myself what is repentance really amen because for us it's always turning from sins turning from Bad Deeds stop doing horrible things and be sorry for the horrible things you did but in this day I believe Peter was pointing to something else when he said repent so so uh I I pulled up the word here in the in the concordance and we're going to look at this the word repent so the title again is the unveiling of the word requires repentance so what was Peter doing in that day he was unveiling the word and the unveiling of the word required repentance so when he was preaching modern events made clear by prophecy when he's preaching the message for his hour amen he he was telling them these things that you've seen and heard and all these events that have taken place today and have taken place they're all prophecy being fulfilled Peter is preaching the message of the hour and he's unveiling the prophecies that we're laying in the Old Testament and he's peeling the veil off of them and saying this is that and this is that this is what David was talking about when he said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that's what David meant when David says I mean they said the Lord on his right hand amen now we see Jesus Christ ascended on high at the right hand of the father this is what David was talking about amen when you see amen this this tongues when you hear us all speaking in your own tongues this is what Joel was speaking about so in the unveiling of the word when they ask when when their hearts were pricked at the preaching of the word amen they asked what shall we do and the first thing he said was repent I don't think they needed to stop smoking stop drinking stop committing adultery they were coming to worship these were worshipers of Jehovah they were very religious and they were devout doing their Duty under the law of Moses they were bringing sacrifices and offerings to the Lord so when we look at this scripture this is a scripture that we just read we look at the word repent in the Concordance and this word repent is a combination of two you can see there in that second line under the definition of a combination of the word three three two six that's just a reference to a Greek word and three five three nine it's a combination of these two roots it's it's interpreted repent 34 times and it means to change one's mind to repent to change one's mind for better heartily to amend with abhorrence of one's past sins so the real the real basic definition of repentance is a change of mind [Music] that's why he looked at these religious Jews and says you know what Jesus was and you know what happened to him and this is all the prophecy being fulfilled now you need to repent you need to change your mind about what you think you know about the law and about Moses and about the prophecy and about the day and age you live in you need to repent and you need to accept this that I'm preaching to you which is the word that was their repentance not to stop swearing but to have a change of mind now we look at this next slide I highlighted there in yellow that were three five three nine like I said there's two words that come together to make this Greek word the first word three three two six is a word that's translated after 88 times so it's after this after two days after this event so it's just it's it's a word that means after something happens afterwards but this word 3539 means to understand to perceive to consider to think that's how it's translated the definition to perceive with the mind to understand to have understanding to think upon heed Ponder consider so what does it mean to repent it means to have a different thought a different understanding a different way of thinking to think differently after this praise God brother Bennett said the key to the door but I believe that Peter said repent first water don't remit sins the Church of Christ preaches it that way but I believe that repentance Godly sorrow repent means turn around go back you missed the mark start over again you missed something you need to understand something better you've missed something there's something you don't understand now I don't I don't want you to get me wrong I mean I'm not saying if they're your smoking drinking swearing committing adultery that you don't need to repent from those but a change of mind to understand the word for your day will change your thinking to where you no longer want to do those things so of course everybody knows that if they're going to come to the Lord they have to stop smoking stop drinking stop swearing stop you know for Jim the general population knows that you you need to have somewhat of a holy Sanctified life in whatever definition that is to come to the Lord but what good would it do you to stop smoking stop drinking stop running around stop all these things and never know Christ never know that Jesus Christ that's here today amen you can be reformed and you can stop all the bad activities of life and still be lost and go to hell so repentance is not stopping bad activities repentance is a change of mind a new understanding amen these these Jews on the day of Pentecost they were hearing amen they were hearing the word preached the veil was taken off the word the message for their hours being priests and under that preaching their heart was pricked their brain wasn't pricked their heart was pricked there is something in them and 3 000 men were able to come to baptism in Jesus Christ's name amen and now this begins so it makes baptism in Jesus name so fundamental so clear amen that you first first you must have a change of understanding that's why Oneness Pentecostal baptism won't work even if they baptize in Jesus name because it's the wrong Revelation amen it's the wrong understanding of who Jesus is amen but under the message of the hour the right interpretation and understanding of who Jesus is has been unveiled in this day and that's why in this day with the right word has come the right baptism the baptism has been restored with the right teaching so now I'm in the importance of water baptism just went through the roof for me because I began to understand that it has to do with a change of mind a change of understanding when we come to the message we could have went to a a pilgrim Holiness Church and and got as many morals we could have went to a conservative old-fashioned Baptist and got just as much moral teaching we could have went to a a good old-fashioned UPC Pentecostal church and got just as much instruction and how to dress but it would have done us absolutely no good to understand Christ today so it wasn't it wasn't the the the changing of behavior that was our repentance our that all came with repentance but the real repentance that came in this day is a change in understanding from a denominational view of Jesus Christ to the reality of the word so so praise be to God this changes this this understanding this this little meditation on this one scripture we've quoted so many times changes so many things for me that's why that's why so many times you see somebody who will they'll reform but not repent they don't really change their thinking about the word they hold on to certain things and certain understandings and certain ideas amen and they may even accept water baptism in Jesus name but unless they drop all their old ideas and come to the word for their day amen it's not going to have the effect and that's why amen you can baptize in Jesus name in Jesus name in Jesus name and there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost because the prerequisite is repentance amen a change in understanding then taking his name in baptism with the right understanding guarantees the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not the phraseology amen it's the revelation [Music] and boy that just takes the mystery out of that scripture doesn't it so if you'll repent like they did that day when Peter preached and came to the word for their hour and how to change his mind a change of understanding to understand the word for their day and under that they took Jesus name and baptism according to the scriptures then there was a promise that they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen praise God I say God is so good Acts chapter 17 let's look at this scripture together if we could turn to Acts chapter 17. Acts chapter 17 . and verse 22. we'll read this together acts 17 verse 22 then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you what is Paul about to do he's about to unveil the word for their day they knew that there was an unknown God he's here to declare the unknown God to them verse 24 God that made the world and all things there and seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and that determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord of Happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being a certain also of our own poets have said for we are also his offspring so there's much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone Graven by Art and man's devices and the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent what's Paul talking about repent from what smoking drinking no repent from your wrong understanding of the godhead amen you thought that you could fashion Fashions of stone of silver of gold of idols and them and worship him through temples made with hand and through Idols amen and God winked at this temporarily but now the truth the unknown God I am now declaring to you and now God winked at that temporarily but now he's calling you to repent from your wrong understanding of God and come to the Declaration that Paul is declaring come to the God Amen who is declaring himself whom you called unknown who you build a an idol to who you build a temple to and worship in your ignorance now Paul's here to take away your ignorance now to repent is to change your mind about how you thought you should worship God and come to the true worship of God that was Paul's call to repentance he didn't say anything about sinful activity he didn't say anything about bad lifestyles it was about wrong worship a wrong understanding and the true revelation of God boy I don't know about you but my whole understanding of repentance is different We Don't Preach Reformation We Don't Preach amen we're not here just to clean up people's lives we're here to introduce people to a living God we're not here just to make people obey rules we're not here just make people look good and have Good Conduct and have good families we are here to introduce a living breathing Jesus Christ who's alive today and revealed in his word we're here to present him to the people so that they can repent from whatever understanding they had of Jesus Christ before and come to this revelation that's the word that we present that's our call to repentance repent from your misunderstanding repent from your traditional ideas repent repent repent and come to Christ what about my smoking drinking but brother Branham didn't worry about people who were addicted to cigarettes he introduced them to Christ knowing that that would take care of the cigarettes amen praise be to God we're not back in the days of sanctification we've come through that but the Holy Ghost still brings sanctification amen the the Holy Ghost that's here still brings a Sanctified life it still Wills a work of sanctification it's one of the works of Grace has never went away but we're not in the age where we stop at sanctification we're here Amen to present the unknown God we're here to present the Misunderstood Jesus Christ so that now in the opening of the seals he can be understood and the great mystery that was in God's mind which Christ is the mystery of God revealed now that Christ is being represented to the people and now we're calling them to repent but do I have to quit smoking don't worry about quit smoking come to the word amen come to Christ be joined with the Living God Amen the real Jesus Christ not an idea not an old hangover tradition but the god of today come to him and see what happens to your addictions amen praise be to God I want to look at this scripture here in John 16. this is Jesus speaking to his disciples he said nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you which is the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of Truth but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come now brother Jesus said later I will come to you so when he says he he's meaning me in another form and another dispensation but he but when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me the the Holy Ghost is going to reprove the world of sin because they didn't believe on Jesus Christ not because they had a committed adultery not because they lied not because they cheated their neighbor that the Holy Ghost was going to reprove the world of sin because they didn't believe on Jesus Christ the word the anointed word for the day and the Holy Ghost has always been reproving the world for not believing the present tense Jesus Christ whether it was in the restoration amen of the truth of justification or sanctification under Wesley or the gifts of the Spirit under the baptism Holy Ghost every age the Holy Ghost has been reproving the world of sin because they didn't believe the present tense Jesus Christ praise God I love the word brother bam says now look sin is not lying I'm so glad the prophet said this sin is not lying stealing drinking committing adultery that's not sin that's the attributes of unbelief the only sin there is is unbelief the only righteousness there is is faith so you cannot obtain righteousness by Good Deeds that's not righteousness that's filthy rags amen but true righteousness is the righteousness of God so the only sin there is is unbelief the only righteousness there is is by faith faith and unbelief that's the only two sources it comes from the Bible says he that believeth not is condemned already all right if you'll turn with me uh to Philippians let's turn to Philippians chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3. and verse 9 the Apostle Paul says and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law so Paul's own righteousness was keeping law so his obedience to the law was his righteousness but that's not when he wants to be found in him with his own righteousness but that which is through Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith oh praise God Paul did not want the righteousness of law keeping he didn't want to be found in him with that kind of righteousness but he wanted to be found in another kind of righteousness that came by faith in Christ Jesus which is the righteousness of God by faith the righteousness of god is perfect righteousness okay this is the righteousness of God not towards God the rights of God how did he get the righteousness of God not by rule keeping but by faith in Christ so the only sin we believe the prophet right amen I I allow you all kinds of allowance to disbelieve me but we believe what the prophet of this age brought amen and when it matches so perfectly to the scriptures now we can see in depths that we've never seen before simple basic truth this is what became so fun when I started going through water baptism again simple basic repent blew up simple basic be baptized in Jesus name it goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper so now there's no no the sin is not lying but the distance you can have sins those are wrong Deeds yeah there's no problem with that but the real Sin is unbelief so the real issue we have to deal with is unbelief when unbelief is dealt with amen then there's a promise of the Holy Ghost that will make the word live the real issue is unbelief and we want to have the righteousness that comes by faith not the righteousness that comes by Deeds praise God amen God is so good let's go to Matthew 19. and look at this in Matthew chapter 19. Matthew 19 and verse 16. and behold one came unto him and said good Master what good things shall I do that I have that I may have eternal life look what he wants he wants righteousness that is of the law and he wants to earn eternal life by doing good deeds verse 17 and he said unto him why call us down me good there is none good but one that is God but if that will enter into eternal life keep the Commandments now this statement is interesting in verse 17. why call us thou me good there is none good but one brother Branham alludes to the fact that that Jesus is testing his Revelation do you know who I am [Music] do you know are you catching the Revelation he why because if he caught the Revelation he would repent amen and he would be saved [Music] why call us down me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments now now we know that there'll be more who enter into life than just the elect than just the bride because of the white Throne judgment there'll be many that enter into life and they're all entering into life on the same basis every one of them it's the it's how they treated Christ the word that's the same basis for every one of them so now he's saying just keep the Commandments if you want to enter into life keep the commandments so there is a way remember at the white Throne judgment when the books were open amen when the book was open and the books were open and they were all judged out of the books according to their deeds according to what they did with the word whether it was in flesh or whether it was a portion of the written word they received well however they treated Christ amen is written in the book of Deeds and that's where they're rewarded from and can enter into life so now there's a couple things going on in this passage but if that will enter into life keep the Commandments he says unto him which Jesus said thou shall do no murder thou shall not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet what do I need to repent of he wasn't this would be it the parents he wasn't lying about his neighbors he was keeping all the Commandments What did this young man need to do to have eternal life it wasn't to go and do good deeds he could enter into life but to be bride need something else the young men say unto him all these things have I kept from my youth of what lack I am Jesus saith unto him if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell what thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions so now we realize Jesus opening statement why call us thou me good The Man by his own conduct proved that he never caught the revelation he didn't know who was standing before him because he could turn his back on God he could turn us back on God and flesh the word made flesh and he could walk away from the word for his day because he he could not value this more than he valued his possessions that man we find later in hell but he didn't need to repent of bad conduct he didn't need to repent of not keeping Commandments we found him later in hell because he rejected the Living Word and turned his back on Jesus Christ and chose the things of the world more than the word of God so when when he tells Jesus I've done all this what like I yet Jesus didn't say no remember Tuesday you said this and no this man was a he was keeping the Commandments but the problem was no Revelation nothing pricked in his heart nothing come to life and the presence of the Living Word nothing sparked amen nothing caused him to bow at his feet nothing caused him to drop his Nets something moved on Peter the fisherman amen when he says come follow me he dropped his net something stirred within him he didn't need logical explanation he said come follow me and he dropped his Nets he says the same thing to the Rich Young Ruler so your possessions come follow me and he couldn't drop his possessions to have the word so he was lost there was no repentance for him amen so this whole concept of repentance we don't want to carry with us a denominational understanding of repentance an old understanding we want a Bible Understanding amen there's two prophecies in the Old Testament speaking of the Gathering end of Israel again and the end times and I'm just going to read them quickly to you one is Zechariah 12 10 says I will pour upon the House of David and upon the habitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for the only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn and then down in Chapter 13 Verse 6 is that in one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hands then he shall answer those those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends so we know this is speaking of the revelation of Christ to the 144 000 Jews and the end time under the ministry of Moses and Elijah amen and brother Graham says this and recognizing your day and its message now they have been scattered blinded gathered and are far into the third day so the Jews under the Jews they were scattered blinded and now they've been gathered and under the ministry of two Prophets The Veil is going to be taken off the word their blindness is going to be removed amen you see they were scattered from Palestine throughout the world they were blinded to reject the Messiah and now they have been gathered in their Homeland ready for the trumpets to recognize the atonement as the Bible said when they receive it and find him with nail scars after the church is taken then they say where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends and he said they would separate each family and who cry and weep for days like a family that lost their only son remember the Feast of trumpets was to do that to wheat mourn for the killed sacrifice they had rejected it the the the the seventh trumpet introduces Christ to them amen and moving them to the Feast of atonement which they realize that the atonement was already made and they rejected it and it's a feast of mourning and of weeping over what they missed and in The Sixth Seal the prophet says the preachers them to prophets speaking Moses and Elijah they preached like John the Baptist the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent Israel repent repent from your sins and your unbelief and turn back to God so the message of Moses and Elijah is like the message of John the Baptist repent repent from one brother Branham said these are real Orthodox Jews the real religious serving God according to the Commandments that they had received they were religious they were worshipful they were clean living amen the call to repentance is not a call to clean up their life it's a call to repent for missing the Messiah and listen friends the 144 000 that will be at their end time not one of them cried out on that day at the Passover feast crucify him crucified it was their ancestors that done it amen but because God deals with the nation of Israel as a nation amen they're mourning for what their ancestors did and they recognized we missed it that was the word we missed the word and walked away from the word and all of this that's happened to us is our fault and they repent what do they do they have a change of mind they're understanding opens the darkness and blindness that was open has peeled back the word is unveiled amen now all the modern events for them are made clear by prophecy under two Prophets and they come to a true repentance and Israel is saved in a day they didn't have to stop their sinful activity they they had to change from a wrong understanding under blindness and come into the correct revelation of Jesus Christ this is Bible repentance with that go sorrow for your wrongdoings with that goes everything you did against the word which is Christ and you're sorry for everything you've done against the word adulteries against the word defiling your temple is against the word dividing your body all of those things are against of course you're remorseful for other things that are against the word amen but the thing that you repent of the most is not receiving and believing the word in due time amen and rejecting and walking away and trampling over the word Jesus Christ our repentance is a change of understanding a change of mind this is why you see so many times people go to the water to get baptized without the right change of mind they struggle and struggle and struggle and struggle and struggle where they have the baptism Legos when the baptism Legos is promised promised I say first have a change of mind come to the revelation of this hour come to the truth unveiled do I have to understand it all you don't have to understand it all what you have to recognize is this is absolutely nothing but the truth this is God this is God's way and this is the only way [Music] amen amen we still don't understand it all friends we can't wait for that to get baptized in his name we have to know enough to understand that this is Christ this is his word this is the truth and I want to be identified with the correct word by taking the correct name in water baptism and show that I belong to Jesus Christ not the Jesus Christ of the lutherans not the Jesus Christ is the Wesley is not the Jesus Christ amen of the one is Pentecostals but the Jesus Christ of the word that's been unveiled in this day the Lord Jesus Christ the word made manifest in my day that's the one I want to be identified with remember you can be marrying and joining to the wrong concept and I wonder how effective that is but when we go into the Waters of baptism we want to die to our own thing and die to ourself and come forth in Christ but we have to know who Christ is and where to find him and where Christ is in our day and if we're baptized in the wrong concept are we baptized unto Jesus Christ just because the name was used or must we be joined to a person wants to be baptized and United with the person of the word in this hour like I said we don't have to understand it all we have to know that we have to know enough to know that this is him that this is truth praise God amen both of them says in the Sixth Seal just exactly like them reformers could not understand this word I want you to focus on that statement them reformers could not understand this word because that was the spirit of the man sent to them it's the eagle age that gets the word and the revelation so listen the man-age anointing which goes all the way through the Pentecostal Revival up into the ministry of the Prophet The Eagle anointing which points us to Revelation 10 1-7 all the way through that man anointing they could not get the word I want that to lock in they could not get the word but under the eagle age they get the word and the revelation this is really important we have to understand this because it has everything to do with repentance because repentance is a change of mind to what mind the mind of Christ so the mind of Christ has been revealed on this day under the eagle age when the word has been revealed has been opened and revealed and now we can repent of the wrong understanding and come to the right understanding becomes super important now it goes on to say now see if you can get back here under these seals then you can ever get when they're open you can see exactly what God isn't doing what he has done what he's going to do here it is exactly and that's the reason men acts that way because that's the spirit that's predicted for that age to be on them they couldn't do nothing else so we can't be upset with the reformers they were under a man-age anointing to be reformers they did exactly what they were supposed to do but they couldn't get this word because they could only operate under the anointing they were under so there's no fault in them we don't we're not upset at them amen for the things that they didn't see I mean they could only do what they were anointed to do but that's not our anointing [Music] it says in the physio I'm bouncing back and forth between the fifth and The Sixth Seal as he describes this God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them now we'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else now the first was that lie on that Roar that pure unadulterated word the second and thigh attire was the ox and it was a burden a beast of burden and it was also a sacrificial Beast he's showing now through the church ages the the the anointings that have been at the opening of the seals it shows the anointing upon each one and then that anointing is the only thing they could operate by notice after it went in the Dark Age of the tribulation what was it I don't want to miss my spot after it was in the Dark Age of the tribulation what was it there was nothing they could do Rome owned had the religious power and had the political power wasn't nothing they could do but just labor to stay alive and give themselves for sacrifice it was an ox that's all they could do that's the kind of spirit they had the spirit of God the ox so the ox anointing was part of the spirit of God it was a manifestation of the Holy Ghost Then There came the reformers the head of a man shrewd wise Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth Calvin Finney knocks the rest of them here they came forth and when they did they were reformers they came forth reforming bringing the people out I want you to show that the work of the man age was a work of reformation it was the Protestant movement to bring the people out of Catholicism so there had to be a certain anointing to break the Yoke of Catholicism coming out of the thyatyrian church age because they had all the power wrapped up amen so God would anoint men with wisdom the wisdom of God and they would begin to translate in the Bible into languages that could be read instead of keeping it from the people away from the people now they were giving it to the people and they were giving the word back to the people and showing the false teaching of the Catholic church was breaking the power of the Catholic church and setting the people free all right praise God the physio again he says now notice the Beast the third Beast now was the cunningness of a man and he represented the reformers that went forth from the idol of pagan now jumped down to paragraph 178 notice idolatry brought the man Beast went forth with the power of God by wisdom that God gave him and brought the church from idolatry back to God that was the anointing of the man age and that was what the man age was supposed to do break the power of idolatry the Catholic church and bring them out of that system and then God would use their cunningness Amendment and and all of a sudden there would be in this age all kinds of inventions and printing press and and works of translation taking place and and a great uh a great move to get the word out to get the Bibles out to people amen and they did this and with the cunningness that they had the ability to debate and to write they would write books and distribute books and distribute material showing the fallacy of the church that's true but I think that anointing lingered a little bit long because they kept coming out and coming out and coming out and coming out and coming out until we have how many denominations now because that anointing remained and they were there Amen to use their intellect and wisdom to find fault and remove the people and they kept finding fault and removing the people that's why I don't think we should have a manage anointing in this message Define fault and pull people aside and start another church and start another movement that should have died in the Reformation but I'm afraid that Spirits moved over people operating under the wrong anointing so they use their wisdom to find a problem in the doctor finally knew something and they analyze and all of a sudden they they get a little group of people pulled off to the side and they break the power of the local church and pull people out that's protestantism friends we're beyond that [Music] praise God at least we should be beyond that the bride must be because there's a different anointing on this Edge praise be to God so now that was the three anointings the lion the ox the man now in the fifth year I'm going to read it from you it's a lengthy one from the fifth seal he says now notice now the fourth Beast that was sent fourth to combat the Antichrist and the last Beast are you ready the last Beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat the Antichrist who was against the teaching of God the Antichrist was an eagle the fourth living Beast was an eagle now you just studied the ages study the scriptures it's an eagle and in the Bible the last age was an eagle age and God Likens the eagle To His prophets now watch the last stage the eagle age a revealer of the true word what's the eagle age it's a prophetic age ego is typed with Prophet amen and it's a revealer of the true word which is what the man age could not do right before God moves into action like he did in the days of Noah he sent forth an eagle when he brought Israel on Pharaoh's Army was ready to go he sent an eagle every time he sends an eagle at the last end of it and here he sends an eagle again that's exactly with the word so how can you make it anything else he sends an eagle why a revealer of the truth that's been Fallen all through the age so how in the world could the ox or the the man or whatever Beast was riding how could it ever be revealed until the Eagles come we know this but I just want to reinforce it the the true revelation of the Bible could never come until the eagle anointing they had their place they were Godly sent beasts just the same as anybody else was the lion that was the original there's where the Antichrist come up in combat then he raised up another Power he sent a power to meet it then he raised up another power and he sent another power to meet him and then at the last power he brings down the eagle to restore the children back to the original Faith again of the fathers the eagle age then did you notice there's no more beast that's all of it that's the end now if you will take now Revelations 10 1-7 he's going to attach its right to Revelation 10 1-7 remember in the last messenger's age what was to happen all the mysteries of God would be revealed the eagle praise God I want to look at this next quote from thirst everyone says we always say today people try to say we compare we've got to compare Bible leaf with Bible leaf scripture with scripture that isn't the truth I'm glad brother Branham said it not me because you'd be scratching our head listen if I believe with my belief scripture with scripture that isn't the truth no it isn't the truth this Greek word means this and this means that the Greeks themselves way back in the Nicene Council and them writers back in there they had different forms one believed this way this Greek scholar meant this and the other one said this one minute this way and they fussed over it we don't need interpretation of Greek Scholars or Greek words to know him is life the person Christ himself not comparing when he says not comparing he means not comparing scripture with scripture it's a revelation that God built his church upon and it won't and if if we don't if we don't build upon that same church the Bible said Abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right the this whole thing is built upon the Revelation then and unless this is revealed to you Jesus said I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of this world and revealed it to babes such as we'll learn oh I really like this quote I really like this because we are not to use what we learned in the man age to understand the Bible sounds so odd but I want you to realize every piece of written material that you find in a Bible bookstore was written under the manage anointing and the man age cannot get this word or the correct revelation of the Bible you cannot walk into a Bible bookstore and find the correct interpretation of the word now many men they got some things right they weren't all wrong they did it's not like everything they said was an error God was bringing truth up and restoring truth but they couldn't get the full word amen they couldn't get the word or the Revelation the man age anointing was not anointed for that work they were anointed to break the Yoke of Catholicism and pull the people out that's what they were anointed for amen they were not anointed to get the true revelation of the whole book so I don't believe that you're going to go in there and I I won't walk into the Bible bookstore and say every word and here's a lie because there's some Bibles in there but the point is that anointing is not the anointing we rely on to get the revelation of the word that is not the anointing we turn to that is not the source for us every Bible school every single Bible school is under the manage anointing there's not one Bible school that's not under the management right there is no Bible curriculum are you hearing me there is no Bible curriculum that is not under the manage anointing because the ox didn't come up with it the manage did but the manage could not come the manage could not understand this word they could translate it from one language to another they could understand what the original Greek was and get the word that is as close to that meaning as possible and they could understand by the the surface reading of the Bible what the Bible was telling us on the surface amen but we know that they didn't understand it because they couldn't even get water baptism in Jesus name right which doesn't take a revelation it just takes reading the Bible so the mayonnaise anointing cannot see the word only the eagle anointing can that's why we must be operating Under The Eagle anointing amen and we must be careful over where we get our information because the man age could not get this word period so you're not going to find a Bible curriculum that has the right interpretation of the word it doesn't exist it's under the manage anointing you're not going to find a bible school that is under the right anointing it doesn't exist it's under the manage anointing and we are not in the man age this is the eagle age that's why God sent a prophet to us with the son of man Ministry working in his lives Amen to give us the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and that's why God sent a man with a seventh grade education who would stand in the pulpit and and get his words wrong and mispronounce and use the wrong word in the wrong place and get it wrong and try to fix it next time he comes to the pulpit and this is the man who is not able to stay on his nose this is the man who doesn't know always know how to read the words out of the Bible and he has somebody stand up Jack Moore read it for him used to have his fiance read it for him amen and then he says I I can't explain it I don't have uh he goes I don't have education enough to preach he goes I can't explain it to you but I know what I'm talking about [Music] why would God use that because it's coming back to the basis of Revelation not education amen man wanted it education under a man-age anointing but this age is not education this age is revelation that's why when the prophet preaches he'll drop something here he goes in all kinds of stories and all kinds of Parables and he moves all the way around then he hits it the next Sunday or that evening or later in the service amen and you don't catch it when you read it the first time you don't catch it when you when you listen to it the first time but all of a sudden you're driving down the road or you're sitting and reading and all of a sudden it's like a lightning bolt hit you in the head and says aha that's it that's what he meant because we're not under a man-age anointing an eagle anointed supposed to be by revelation praise God so I think it behooves us to go to the right source for all of our information I think all of our information should come from the Bible and the message because what is the message it is the correct interpretation of the Bible under a prophetic Ministry so I I think it behooves us to not operate under a manage anointing to not allow those things to creep in keep them at Bay and stay with the eagle anointing the eagle of our age it's very important brother random goes to tell us that there's time for a former and a lot of rain there's a teaching rain there's also a harvest rain a former and a ladder and brother Branham brings both the former and the latter rain he restores the correct teaching that was lost through the church ages and he brings the latter rain which was the Revelation that was sealed in the book and if we want the true understanding of the Bible we have to get the latter rain we have to get the opening of the seals he says and recognize your day's message he said the Bible God God is not this is just not someone trying to press something into you but to reveal to you the very spiritual application of this hour and then the next message that opened up the Seven Seals which undone all the hidden mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and so forth where do you get the correct Doctrine where do you get the doctrine just means teaching where do you get the correct teaching it opened up under the seals the seals was the evidence that the teaching was right he says but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just beyond the mountain Yonder this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it so brother Branham says after the opening of the seals after them angels and all that experience happened and you come and preach to see us he said this has become a new book even brother Branham amen was working back under a mayonnaise anointing when he was reaching out to the Pentecostals and even his understanding of many things changed is that right and even he didn't even know what the seals were until the Angels Came to him one by one every day and gave him the revelation of that he didn't know he didn't get that from the man age this was something that was beyond the man-aid this was the inter correct interpretation of the great mystery of the Bible and it came at the opening of the seals so even brother Branham he says this became a new book it even read different for him it should definitely read different for us under the full opening of the word we can't go back and read scriptures the same way we read them before amen there's many scriptures I could never read again go back and read Genesis I mean I read them again but I can't read them with the same understanding go back and read Genesis when they ate of the fruit of the tree and where does your mind go amen when they made themselves coverings of fig leaves and and hid from the Lord where does your mind go amen now when you see the story of Esther where does your mind go when you think about Ruth cleaning in the field and Ruth laying at boaz's feet and Boaz doing the Kinsmen Redeemer work and coming back and sowing in her a mysterious sea the hidden mysterious seventh portion of seed where do we get that from by the revelation of the open book amen that's where those things come from you don't get it from a surface reading and understanding the Greek words it's the hidden Mystery that's been hidden in the book amen remember and Junior Jackson's dream there was a great pyramid of stone there and brother Branham there was there was writing all around the stone and he was walking around this Great Pyramid and he was interpreting all the writing on the outside amen that's when the prophet was tying together the Loose Ends all the doctors of the seven Church ages but after he had finished interpreting all the writing on the outside amen there was something inside this rock in this pyramid that no light had ever shined on before amen so he raised his hand in the air he got a sharp instrument peeled the top off said there was White Rock with nothing written on it what is he talking about he's talking about Revelations 10 1-7 where the seven Thunders were never written in the Bible they're all through the Bible but what the seven Thunders uttered was not written Thunder one said this thunder two said that it's a revelation a White Rock that's inside the Bible amen that's never had light shined on before no man-age anointing could ever tell you what those Thunders uttered it was going to take a prophet who can get it from God himself and bring it and no amount of teaching will get you to believe that we can get you to intellectually agree with it we can get you to pass the message test on it but there's going to take something Supernatural to drop that into your heart to actually believe that there was a mystery in this whole Bible a white stone laying in the midst of this throughout from Genesis to Revelation that nobody understood no Bible teacher no Bible school until one little Prophet with a seventh grade education come and in the little room the angel comes to him day by day and tells him what John heard but could not write amen you can say you agree with that but the time is coming when the squeeze will come down we'll find out whether we believe that or not because it can only be received by Revelation not by education we can repeat it back but you go and try to sell that to a theologian he wants to know what what verse was that where did it say that just exactly like that for us we see it everywhere it's all through the Bible this great mystery of the seventh seal it was always there it was Adam and his wife it was Boaz and Ruth it was King Isaiah and Esther it's been there the whole time but we didn't see it until the end time it took the Eagle's anointing to give us the I salve in the last age to open our eyes and move us from denominational man age anointing into an ego Vision where we could fly high and see remember you can only operate under the anointing that God has put in your age and this is not the Pentecostal age this is the bride Age and what is the bright age anointing it is the eagle anointing what does the eagle do the eagle flies high and can see afar off and see clear and the higher it goes the clearer it sees amen so there was a great prophet Eagle in our day amen who who was the revelation of the son of man through his flesh a son of man revealing the son of man amen and he brought the correct interpretation of the word amen and now all the little eaglets by Revelation are flying high and they're seeing the open book they're seeing what was veiled in the veiled book all along how by revelation at the opening of The Seven Seals this has become a new book nothing a theologian could touch nothing anybody under the man age could touch and still today under a managed anointing you can't see it and souls that are in prison now he says but one day he rose from there came forth where was the book at it was still in the abstract owner God Almighty and John looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden Mystery was the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals when these Seven Seals was opened that opened up the entire Bible you mean to tell me that this Bible was closed closed a locked and sealed with Seven Seals no matter how many volumes were printed it was closed no matter how too many translations there were made it was closed no matter how many commentaries they made on the Bible it was closed you could have a volume of commentaries on the book of Romans and the commentaries are way longer than the book of Romans you can go to a good man age under a manage anointing and he's got a volume on the book of Romans and the Book of Romans is only this big in your Bible and his commentary on the book of Romans is this big and he was reading from a closed book when the book is open what should the commentary look like then if he can talk that much about a closed book what can we see in an open book how one scripture can open and go from Genesis to Revelation and it can open again and open again and open again because the book is not closed but the seals have been taken off and now the book is open and we can read like no Theologian has ever read before in his lives [Music] amen so we don't condemn these men they did what they were anointed to do they were called of God and anointed and they were under that anointing and we say praise God and bless them but they could never see what you and I can see because we've been given Eagle Vision in this end time and the next morning at 10 o'clock sitting in there in my room about 10 o'clock the angel Lord came down he said go to Tucson you'll be Northeast of Tucson and there will come seven angels in a cluster that will shake the whole Earth around you and said it'll be told you from there and how many remembers that is way before it happened there is men sitting right here in the building tonight with standing right there when it happened and said the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened and fulfill Revelations 10 that in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes and I say repent repent from whatever we believe before and come to this repent from whatever understanding we had before and come to this repent from the nominational thinking traditional understanding repent and keep repenting I've been repenting since I came through this message [Music] and I believe I probably got some more repenting to do not because I plan on taking up smoking and not because I plan on doing evil things but because this book is open and the more I look into an open book under an eagle anointing the more I recognize my understanding was wrong I I was under a traditional thinking under my upbringing as a boy and every time I come in contact with this I must repent and have a change of mind yes the bride that repented but she's been repenting for 60 years amen stay with the word as it's been revealed this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes this day this scripture is fulfilled I say repent praise be to God it's such a treasure friends it's such a joy we know how to repent [Music] how many repentance messages are preached throughout the United States in the world how many altar calls how many people are called to give their heart to the Lord Jesus and they know Jesus being presented not the present tense Jesus a historical Jesus is being presented but not the Jesus of today not the Jesus that's present how many people are called to repent and told that if you quit smoking quit drinking do this and come to church that's not the repentance that the Bible's talking about you have to turn from your thinking you have to turn from your tradition just like those Jews at the day of Pentecost had to turn from their understanding of the law of Moses and come to the revealing of the law of Moses the law of Moses made manifest and that's the same repentance this world needs now to turn from church thinking and come into the true understanding of Christ to turn from from church to nominational understanding of repentance to come to the one the Mighty God who has been unveiled before us how through a prophetic Ministry it wasn't brother Branham standing there with his back to the crowd that was Jesus Christ in America amen it isn't Seminary teaching and education that keeps opening the word to you and I it's the spirit of Christ the spirit of truth that would lead you into all truth that's the anointing that's here as he was promised to give us if we repent and be baptized in his name he would give us the spirit of truth that would lead us into all truth and I say he's here according to the promised word praise be to God let's turn to Revelation chapter 3. finished with the scripture and maybe a quote Revelation chapter 3 verse 14. the laodicean church age and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans write these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked he is not speaking to Bootleggers alcoholics drug addicts he is speaking to the church people who are trying to live holy people trying to walk a Christian walk that's who he's speaking to their condition is not sinful by unrighteous Deeds their action is sinful because they think they're right but they're wrong they're disbelieving the word for the hour because they think that they're fine and they don't need it so they're in sin they're wretched miserable blind and naked they have no covering they have no eyes to see they have no true wealth they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked he says in verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment the thou Mays be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy lies with I said that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent repent from what repent from your religious blindness repent from no covering of the word repent from holding your gray piece of paper before you like a hula skirt repent repent from a laodicean condition where we think we're right in church but we're wrong because we haven't received the true word the true interpretation of the Bible repent and to call in the laodicean church ages be zealous therefore and repent as many as I love I rebuke and I chase him and he's saying I'm correcting you and I'm teaching you amen be zealous therefore and repent repent where where do you repent in the laodicean church age do you repent of smoking no you repent of the wrong understanding and come to the revelation of this message that's the repentance in laodicea come to him the person of the word [Music] and the full revelation so he says be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock say I'm not in the church anymore I am outside be zealous and repent I'm not there come to me [Music] leave your condition buy of meat gold white Raymond I save repent and laodicea repent repent of what gaming all night from no repent from the wrong understanding of who Christ is and have a change of mind and come to the open book to the unveiled Christ to the Christ the mystery of God that's revealed come to him repent and come to him amen brother Branham says in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ the apostles then them who set forth the Bible here come Luther out in Reformation his word that his church his word his church won't work today Wesley's won't Pentecost won't it won't it worked in their day but it's another day this is the opening of The Seven Seals I know it sounds strange to you but God has Vindicated it so perfectly this is a different day friends this isn't day this isn't the day for the man age anointing this is the day for the eagle anointing if we want to repent and please God then we must come to the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication we must come to the one that's been unveiled amen Christ has been unveiled the book has been opened we have what they never had in the church ages now we have him open to us we can repent like nobody has ever been able to repent before and in laodicea he says be zealous therefore and repent we should be zealous to repent because we can repent like nobody else amen God bless you let's all stand musicians if you can make your way up please brother Ben as well amen I believe that this Eagle anointing is the only way to understand the word you know in every age under every anointing there was a messenger for that age and that messenger was operating under a certain anointing and he under that anointing would bring a word for that age in that day but that the messenger wasn't the only one preaching in that day amen there was always a five-fold Ministry is that right and that faithful Ministry to be a true faithful Ministry for their day must be operating under the same anointing as that messenger and under the messenger amen and then this day we have to be under our messenger and under our messenger we become the final voice to the final age amen and our messenger was William Branham he was amen the prophet of the age of the seventh angel amen but today there's a five-fold ministry that's preaching and that five-fold Ministry cannot be operating under a man-age anointing we can't be bringing mayonnaise Doctrine and reading our Bible with man-age study helps the fivefold ministry today must be operating under the same anointing as the messenger of the age because that's the anointing for the age so the fiful ministry must operate by an eagle anointing and preach from an open book and not from the closed book of the reformers no matter how nice their material is written and know Muhammad how nice they put it together amen the book wasn't open there it's open here so we must be preaching we must be operating under the right anointing I don't want to preach from a closed book I want to preach from an openness say God help us to stay open help keep our channels as ministers that keep our channels as Believers as a church keep our channels open to the right spirit and close to all other voices and operate under the eagle anointing amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we recognize Lord that we need you in this hour that we live Lord God you have sent us such a great gift such a great voice such a great word God everything we have need of to overcome you have given to us Lord your Prophet said that what we have before when he comes to the preaching of the seals he said what we've got now is not enough it wouldn't get the Rapture done there's something in those seven Thunders that'll bring the faith for rapturing Grace God we recognize that there's no other place that this bride is going to get in position outside of this Eagle anointing and outside of this interpretation of the word help us God to stay in the presence of the son bake all the greenness out of us and and Lord let us operate under this anointing Lord open our eyes to see and help us to be zealous to repent as you continually reveal yourself to us God we love you we thank you for what you're doing in this day we thank you for allowing us to be here and giving us isaf so that we can see Lord our hearts burn within us as you speak to us day by day as you open to us the scriptures and open our understanding to understand the scriptures God we love this Eagle anointing that you've sent in this hour on May operate through us may we be free channels for that operation we love you Lord forgive us for our unbelief forgive us for our misunderstandings forgive us for holding on to tradition help us to turn loose of it all Lord and receive this message in his fullness we love you God we ask for your blessing now as we go use us Lord in this end time day by day may we shine the right light live the right life that all that's preached and all that's taught and all we see would manifest into a life live it through each of us we pray Christ's name amen God bless you all better than I give my mind [Music] fill me with your
