TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When he says, "I'm called to be a light unto the Gentiles." &gt;&gt; Man, that really sounds like you really think a lot of yourself, Paul. &gt;&gt; BUT PAUL PAUL'S not the one who came up with that plan. &gt;&gt; Paul's not the one who decided that. When David said, "God's anointed me to be a king." And you look at him, you little shrimp, you're a king. Haha. Listen, it wasn't David's idea. David wasn't doing anything wrong. For David to say, "God's anointed me to be a king," is speaking the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; FOR FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL TO SAY, "GOD WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL. I'M A LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." GOD HAS CALLED ME, AMEN, TO TAKE THE GOSPEL to the Gentiles. HE'S NOT BRAGGING. HE'S NOT LIFTING HIMSELF UP. HE'S just telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND GOD LET HIM FAIL SO MISERABLY AND SO BAD THAT WHEN IT COME TIME TO DECLARE he's apostle, an apostle of God, HE SAYS, "HEY, LISTEN. I'm not even worthy to be an apostle, but by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When Moses says, "I've come down to deliver you out of Egypt. I'VE COME DOWN AND GOD HAS CALLED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK." AMEN. AND GOD IS GOING TO DO MIRACLES through me. Listen. Listen. He wasn't bragging. He was only telling THE TRUTH. AND FOR US TO SAY, "I BELIEVE BY FAITH AND BY GRACE. I'M PART OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST." THAT'S NOTHING BUT DECLARING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And we DON'T DO SO WITH PRIDE or arrogancy, but in humility, saying, "I MESSED MY LIFE UP. EVEN AFTER BELIEVING, I'VE MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'VE MESSED EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE MESSED UP HAS BEEN MESSED UP BY ME. &gt;&gt; But I still believe." &gt;&gt; I believe what he said about me. I believe what that prophet said about me. I believe the word. And why do I believe? Because I can't help but believe. &gt;&gt; I didn't believe because I CHOSE TO BELIEVE. I JUST BELIEVED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. IT WASN'T THAT YOU CALCULATED EVERYTHING OUT AND LAID IT ALL OUT and says, "hm, you know, the Baptists say this and the Pentecostals and but I've been reading my Bible and I talked to a few theologians and listen, I put together a flowchart &gt;&gt; and THE MOST REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE GOSPEL IS BROTHER BEN. SO, I DECIDED TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." THAT IS NOT HOW WE COME TO THE MESSAGE. WE COME TO THE MESSAGE BEFORE WE UNDERSTOOD IT. WE STILL HAD A MILLION QUESTIONS. PEOPLE WOULD ASK US, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT?" YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW." WELL, WHAT ABOUT this scripture? I don't know. Well, this scripture proves Trinity. How do YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. UH, BUT I STILL BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; We didn't come when WE FIGURED IT OUT. WE DIDN'T START PROCLAIMING IT BECAUSE WE had all the answers. something down inside of us, a seed gene OF GOD BY PREDESTINATION WAS ALREADY pre-programmed that when they heard the word like they did in the book of Acts WHEN PAUL AND BARNABAS CAME, those that were ordained to eternal life, they believed. And you were chosen to believe this message. &gt;&gt; You didn't believe it because you decided to. &gt;&gt; If you decided to believe it, you'll be one of those who will leave it one day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I promise you that. But if against your will and beyond YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT AND AGAINST ALL AGAINST ALL OF YOUR RESISTANCE and intellectualism and ALL OF YOUR UH PUSHING AGAINST IT, YOU STILL BELIEVE. AMEN.
