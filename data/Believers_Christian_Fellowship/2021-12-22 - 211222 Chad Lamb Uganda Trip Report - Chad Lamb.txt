good to me amen amen i missed you all and it's good to be back i was really excited to be back for the service and all the flights worked out just perfect so i could get here i just showed up at the church at 6 30 my wife brought me a fresh change of clothes i got a shower in the office and walked over here so this is my first stop amen after being home but thank god we're here together and i've got a report that i want to give you and some good things happen and the lord was really good to us god bless you brother bob it's so good to see you amen it's good to see you in church amen let's just bow our heads and pray as we get started lord jesus we thank you for the privilege to be together lord when there's been an absence lord it means so much to us to be able to gather again and see one another's faces and worship together lord as we are your children sitting at your feet lord basking in your glory lifting our voices to seeing of your greatness lord god i pray that you bless us tonight as i share lord the things that have been going on the last two weeks and the blessings that we've had with our brother abraham and lord may you just give us inspiration out of your word to keep moving forward and pressing forward and that each one of us will take our position and take our place and do as you've called us to do and god we just thank you for the privilege of once again opening your word and reading out of it together and blessing your name bless us lord and guide us in jesus christ's name we pray amen while you're yet standing let's turn to the book of proverbs proverbs chapter 25. we'll read one scripture and let you have your seat proverbs 25 verse 25. i may cough a little bit tonight don't worry about me i went from lima ohio to tropical along the equator back to lima ohio amen so my sinuses don't know what to do but that's okay and as i keep preaching to keep speaking it'll blow it out and they'll get clearer and clearer so it doesn't bother me don't let it bother you but it seems like whenever i travel i have a little bit of trouble those air air conditioning on the plane first they fry they roast you and then they freeze you and when you're ball headed you know you get hot sitting there waiting and then you lit little beads of sweat on your head and then as soon as they're ready to take off they blast cold air right across your head and i thought mom i'm gonna have to start wearing a toupee so i don't get horses amen so i know what brother branham was talking about but let's look here proverbs 25 25 as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country amen god bless you you may have your seats may the lord refresh you with good news from a far country i start off by just thanking everybody for your prayers we certainly needed it amen it's a long tiring trip but god is good excuse me when we got there it was like i said it was hot and humid and dusty and my it was just it's rough and i don't know if i'm starting to get older or what but i don't do as good as i used to i used to be like a boy scout none of that stuff bothered me but now my i just it is a hot car with no air conditioning with the windows down on a dusty road for seven hours bumping along and dust blowing all over you and my goodness i'm not i'm not as hardy as i used to be that's what i found out i haven't traveled overseas for two years so i guess you get out of practice a little bit but i appreciate your prayers it was needful and i was a beneficiary of that and i appreciate that and all of you who checked on my family while i was going i really appreciate that that's real real blessing to me so thank you for that and and those who are checking on one another and i just thank god that everybody's doing well also angie told me that there's a lot of christmas cards waiting for me to read when i get home and treats and cookies and gifts and all kinds of good stuff so i can't wait to get home amen so god bless you thank you all for that that means a lot to us your thoughtfulness for our family always means a lot we're always blown away by how good you are to us and we really appreciate it it means a lot to us so i'm looking forward to sitting down and reading through the cards and looking through the pictures and all of that also want to really thank the brothers who ministered for us while i was away i think brother kyle brother kyle pulled double duty he had service here sunday then he took care of the outreach service over at the yoders in the amish country for us the following sunday so we appreciate that and brother ben took the wednesday service we appreciate that and also brother nathaniel cyrus for coming down that was a real blessing and then brother ben had probably the worst job of all because he was emergency on deck in case my flights didn't work out he was going to have to preach tonight so i mean it's rough when you know you got to preach to catch inspiration but it's worse when you're trying to study not knowing if you're going to preach or not amen so that's a hard spot to be in and you can get a call last minute that you're on go so i appreciate that brother ben thank you for sacrificing for me and i appreciate that and i'm glad it worked out we could be here also brother abraham and sister rachel uh brother abraham's wife they wanted me to send special greetings to the church they really love you all and brother abraham's hoping to come back the first part of next year and so i'm hoping that we can get him here by spring and have some services together so that looks like the door might be opening and so we we hope that that will work out also uh i want to let you know i'll try to remember to announce it again at the end but uh i tried to find a little bit of candy or something for uganda to bring to the kids i always like to bring something for the kids if i can but uganda doesn't make their own candy and so whatever they have for candy you probably don't want but so when i was in amsterdam i found some chocolates made in amsterdam so you got the best amen you got good chocolate so all the kids after service there's a basket out at the welcome desk with chocolates freshly imported from amsterdam made in amsterdam freshly imported so grab one of those on your way out and we just want to say we love you and i hope that you enjoy that also we'll let you know we won't have prayer time this saturday it'll be christmas day and then we'll be going through the schedule for watch night we'll be having watch night next friday and no service that wednesday a week from today we won't be having any service i'd like to get into this powerpoint and show you some pictures of uganda excuse me so when we look at uganda uganda is called the pearl of africa i think they call themselves the pearl of africa i don't know if anybody else calls them the pearl of africa but it's on the sign as you come out of the airport the pearl of africa so i guess if that's what they want to be called but uh this is my second time being there i think i was there five or six years ago and uh not much has changed but you know it's a beautiful country you can see here that it's it's beautiful it still has some ruggedness to it it's still a bit wild in places and it's really beautiful but it's it's contrasted by poverty it's a very poor country and you can see here this is the big market in kampala so sisters if you want to go buy some glows are some shoes this is where you would do your shopping in kampala and you'd be on the street bartering for what you wanted so this is just kind of the way it is in uganda there's people everywhere and any of the brothers who traveled overseas in a third world country especially in africa or haiti you know what this scene is like but uh you can see here you can get fruit and watermelons and all kinds i mean anything you can get at this market so when you go to the market this is what the market's like they don't have much in the way of supermarkets like we would have and if you want fresh chicken for dinner this is how you get your chicken take it home and fix it up fresh so yeah so we see all kinds of motorcycles and bikes and stuff going by with chickens tied by their feet hanging off the sides like saddle bags going down the road or they'll be a pig across the back or something like that you know somebody's going to eat good tonight and they got some chicken going home or some pork or something so these are the scenes you get used to and i got a picture later on a video driving that you'll you'll see what it's like so it's it's so interesting when you travel and i thank god i've had the privilege to go see our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world just to get perspective because life is different life is difficult life is hard amen but you can see there's such a contrast in the way that we live our daily lives but when you go to fellowshipping on the word it's the exact same there's no difference at all so from across the world from different cultures and different lifestyles and and differences of all kinds when you sit down to fellowship on the word it's like you've known each other all your lives amen and you can sit and talk about the word you have such a common denominator across brethren around the world something that unites us stronger than any family bond any national bond any other bond and that bond is the word it's christ that's glued us together and so that's that's one of the greatest privileges of getting to travel next i want to show you brother abraham's new house he just finished a new house and it's very nice i looked at this house when i pulled up when we pulled in i said brother abraham and he just laughed because i was at his old house previously and brother abraham didn't have any facilities with which to take care of us um so it was really rough the the house that he was in was rough and he couldn't keep guests and and it was difficult so we had actually sent him some money when we knew he was going to try to build another house and we sent him some money and some other brother sent some money and it wasn't going to be this kind of a structure but um he started building it and he wanted a place really where he could host people at least have dinner in his home or when he has guests and things like that and there was a brother from somewhere i don't even know the brother wished to remain anonymous so i don't know who it is but the brother heard a testimony of a sister in norway the sister in norway was born mute and she was born blind and when brother abraham was in norway many years ago he prayed for her and god gave her the ability to speak she could now speak she was still blind but she could communicate she could speak and then after several years god just planted in her heart that if he can pray for me to speak he can pray for me to see and she had confidence that if she went to brother abraham and and prayed something lodged in her heart that kindness she went to uganda and had him pray that she would see and so she did she couldn't get anybody to go with her she went by herself this is a a blind woman who'd just been able to speak for a few years traveled by herself and went to see brother abraham and brother abraham prayed for her at the end of the service she sat through the service he called her up at the end he prayed for her then they went back to the to his house and they were eating around the in the living room there and uh she still couldn't see you know and her eyes were hurting her actually after the prayer and so she laid down she wasn't feeling very well then they were going to eat so she got up to eat and then when she was sitting there all of a sudden she screamed out because she could see she couldn't see much but she could see she could see that there was something on a plate and she began to scream and rejoice but she had just got it opened her eyes for the first time her whole life and it was so painful that next couple of days she laid down she stayed in the dark because the light hurt her eyes so bad so she went back to norway and she gradually improved and she's got uh she's got some degree of sight i don't think it's perfect side but she now can see she can now speak and she gave that testimony and that testimonies went out from norway so there was a brother who got intrigued about this and he made plans to travel to uganda and he went to uganda to see brother abraham because he wanted to see what kind of man this was and whether this was real or not i guess so he spent some time with brother abraham but brother abraham can't keep guests in his home so he has no facilities for gas no way to keep guests so every evening he has to drive it's about 30 minutes of look 30 minutes or a little over to the nearest city that has a hotel to put guests up in a hotel then he drives home and the next morning he goes and picks up his guest and comes back so he's driving two hours a day just to take care of his guests and the roads are rough it's not like 30 minutes going down i-75 but it's it really beats you up especially the first half of the trip really jostles you about and beat you up i don't know how many times my head slammed against the window when we hit a pothole and things like that so it's not an easy trip so this brother he stayed in the hotel so brother abraham was driving him back and forth and his brother happens to be an engineer and the brother said i want to finish building your house i want i want you to have a house where you can keep company i want you to have everything you need and the man took it upon himself to design the house and pay for everything to finish this house because he saw what brother abraham was doing because brother abram gets a lot of guests a lot of people come and see him from around africa from there in uganda and visitors from overseas so this this brother took it upon himself to finish this house and it's very nice for the standards there amen so to the right hand side now he has guest quarters which is where i got to stay and he's got two little bedrooms on the side of the house that are isolated by a door from the house two little bedrooms and a bathroom just for keeping company it's got its own outside door and it's got another door separated from the rest of the house you could go into to the dining room and so he's got a perfect place for keeping company now he doesn't have to do all that driving back and forth and it's much easier for the guests it's much easier for him but god bless that man that's what i say god he took it upon himself and he says you must have it this way this way this way this way and he wanted it to be just right and he saw the project all the way through to the end and so i'm really really thankful for that when i pulled in i said praise the lord because i knew this was where i'm going to be sleeping so my rejoicing was a little bit selfish you know but i was just i was just happy he's he's not on the grid he's on complete solar power also um all of the rain collection off the roof goes into some storage uh big water tanks in the back and for forever he's relied completely 100 on rainfall for water that's where he gets all of his water for washing for cooking for cleaning he gets it from the rain and so when he built this house he was able to dig a well there was a place out back that he could dig and he dug down just a little bit and he hit solid rock and they chiseled through the rock and they found a cavern between two layers of rock that has gushing water clean gushing water so he doesn't have to rely on the rainfall only anymore so he's got a place where he can really keep guests where he can really tend to the church where he can really take care of all the things that he needs to take care of and i was really so happy for him and so happy for that brother that that had a vision and wanted him to have a place that he could use for the glory of god so it was wonderful we really appreciated being there this next picture is out back this is brother abraham's barn with a yard full of chickens and turkeys and cows and when you eat it brother abraham's because he's really a farmer he lives out in the village he's you know 30 minutes from the city and he's really a farmer and when you sit down to a meal brother abraham bought almost nothing on that table everything came from his farm you have mangoes you have papayas you have pineapples you have chicken you have beef you have all kinds of i mean you eat good you get corn meal and what i call cornmeal they've got another name for it but what we call organic is all that he eats amen and so we get organic meals every day and and so uh i was outside one day in the morning just reading my bible i think it was on a tuesday there and just studying and just sitting outside and i saw some of the younger girls that were helping sister rachel there they were running around with a stick chasing a chicken around the yard trying to catch a chicken i said oh i wonder if we're having chicken for lunch and sure enough we had chicken for lunch so so it was fresh chicken and it's the real he called brother abraham calls it original chicken not like what he said not like what you be you people eat this one you have to have a good set of teeth to eat this chicken you really have to tear it apart and then you know then it sticks between your teeth and you have to have a toothpick or else you wake up in the night with a toothache because you got a piece of meat lodged up in there but it's it's the original so we had good food the entire time and so it was just really nice to be there but abraham's home another thing that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed is brother abraham's family altar every night and every morning and he never misses it and so family altar would be whenever the the rest of the guests would leave because he had people in for special meetings whenever the rest of the guests would leave you know whoever was staying in his house that night we would gather for family altar and brother abraham would play the guitar and he said he taught himself how to play the guitar he'd play the guitar and sing and then he would open up the bible and read through a portion of scripture if we were reading through matthew at the time and then he would expound on it and i enjoyed him expounding on the word so much and then he would sing another song and we would go to prayer and after we all prayed the whole family after we prayed we'd go to bed and many times we were having family altar because it was a really busy time for them with having the wedding we'd be having family altar at 11 11 30 12 o'clock and wouldn't you know it 5 a.m every single morning we have another family altar and the the first morning or two i could hear him out there singing i'm like oh lord i have to get up i can't just lay here amen so every morning at 5am no matter when you went to bed if you went to bed at 1am 5am you get up for family altar and the same thing you start seeing you'd hear him and his wife and they're singing and that was the wake-up call we'd come to family altar and the same thing expound on the sing expound on the scriptures have prayer and then i would sneak back to bed for an hour or two praise god luckily the breakfast comes late like at 10. but i was really blessed by that and really encouraged by that and inspired by that to be more diligent even in our own family altar you know because it was really a wonderful time of worship it wasn't just reading through a scripture but it was worship the family worshiped together not just prayed together and i that was a benefit to me and i really enjoyed it so there was another brother that was there for the same duration of the trip with me sorry this this uh the tall brother there the white brother there is brother de vet engelbracht i practice saying that a lot ingobracht but he's from south africa so his name is comes from the dutch blend of whatever is blended in south africa but this brother sent me a watch that message a few days before i left and he let me know that we would be he would be traveling to uganda and be there with me at the same time brother um alright robertson was going to come my brother already couldn't make it so he asked this brother to go instead and so this brother is a young pastor he's 32 years old i believe either 32 or 34 and he pastors a group there just outside johannesburg the brother's like six foot seven six foot eight he's a big brother and uh when i met him we got the dog excuse me we got the talking and i thought he looked familiar there was something really familiar about him so when i we started talking he says yeah he says when you remember when you came to the camp for brother gideon and brother willie ratif and that would have been excuse me easter time 2018. i went to do easter meetings for their camp and i took uh the whole weekend of services there and he says i was the song leader so i knew this brother i met this brother uh almost three years ago and i didn't know his name i don't think we were formally introduced but he was the one leading songs every time i came to the pulpit and so now when i meet him two years later i thought wow god this is a small world amen so i didn't even know who it was that i was meeting but he was part of brother william brother gideon's church for a long time a song leave there for a long time and then they moved a little bit out of johannesburg and they started to work there and now excuse me now they're gathering like 60 70 people in a church and he's been pastoring there now for two years so it was really wonderful to get to know this brother from south africa and he we had a really good time of fellowship and it was really beneficial and i can say this trip for me was was really fruitful in many ways i could see the hand of god i felt like i was supposed to go but and really the main reason that i went because brother abraham really asked me to come and do the wedding for his oldest daughter and it was something that sister mercy had shared with my wife that that wasn't something to take lightly because brother abraham's very very serious on who prays a blessing over a wedding that he wouldn't ask anybody that it's it's it's an honor but it's something he's very serious about so i really felt to do it for him he's been a good friend to me and he's been a good brother here for the assembly and a friend of many of us so i traveled to do that but i can say it was fruitful on many many avenues and it was fruitful also for this brother david because we had some deep discussions on the messages and things that that god was we had some time together and as we begin to fellowship some things were really opening up and blowing up and and he he told me one time we were talking he said brother you have to quit he goes i'm going to explode he goes i can't take no more he said i'm going to go home and he goes i'm going to preach i don't know he said i don't know how many sermons he said he was going to preach and i could tell just that time together i enjoyed the fellowship with him but things were really opening up and god was really doing a work and it was it was really wonderful because he had some questions and he would ask some questions and we would just go into the message and you could see i just love to see the light bulb go off for somebody and you can see it's almost like fireworks were coming out of his head amen and he would just i mean he would he goes i'm about to run around and shout brother he said this is so exciting and it was it was so it was so rewarding for me so i enjoyed that kind of fellowship and we had a wonder wonderful time so i would love to get his tapes when he gets back home and and listen to him preach i would enjoy that i might ask him if they'd do any kind of streaming or archive if i could slip in and take a peek because we had a wonderful time of fellowship he took a couple of the services while we were there he was there the whole time i was there he flew in the day i flew in and he flew out the day i flew out this is brother abraham's church you can see the church in the distance and then the foreground is some tents brother abraham's congregation hasn't fit into their church for many years and so they've had to meet outside it to the left you'll see a mango tree there's a lot of people under there actually a lot of women and young children are sitting in the mango tree and there's people there's other shade trees around there's people there and there's people under the tents but this is the mango tree that brother abraham tried to eat from when he was a boy he was rejected from his family and chased away and when he would come to try to get mangoes from this tree they would throw stones at him and chase him away and later we were sitting under it last time we were here six years ago and a mango fell and he goes just think he goes they used to throw stones at me and chase me away from this tree and now god's given me the tree he said now it's my tree and he said this is a blessed mango tree because mangoes usually ripen in a certain season he said this tree is not like any other mango tree he said if you look there's some flowers there's some fruits there's some ripening and some falling he said it produces mangoes year round all the time he said it's not like any other mango tree so this is a blessed mango tree and so many of the congregations sit under that mango tree yet because they're required to do some form of social distancing and so when they could gather back to church they had asked us if we could help them with some tents so that they could have the believers so we were able to send some funds to help them buy these tents so they could social distance and still have the believers they needed some of the tents anyhow because they outgrew the the building but you can see the tents go to the right and down the right hand side and this is a picture from the right hand side looking back and you can see some church excuse me chairs even under this little overhang and then people all the way down the tents and all the way around so they packed that place out and they don't even have the tents aren't sufficient the building's not sufficient they're under the mango tree and all the other shade trees so i was able to take some funds to abraham to help them start on a church building we're going to try to help them expand their church building they want to make it wider and a little bit longer and they want to be able to get everybody they're hoping to be able to get everybody into the church and so they're going to start that project hopefully this this coming year so this is inside the church with brother abraham at the pulpit and this is me this is when we we got there we we arrived i think 11 10 30 or 11 p.m friday night we stayed in the hotel right there in entebbe and the next day we drove and it was an all-day drive to get to his house from entebbe like i said that's a rough hot dirty drive it's just not easy and so we made it all day and so we went right into meetings on sunday so we had two services sunday two services on wednesday and i took three of the services brother moses actually took this picture for me he sent it to me brother moses was out in the congregation there and he snapped that picture and this isn't brother david he took one of the services he took the sunday evening service for us one of the highlights of the trip was seeing moses and mercy and their children there there this is in brother abraham's house they stopped my excuse me for a visit and they were so happy to be home they hadn't been home i think sister mercy hadn't been home in five years they meant to see their family when she left all she left to go um to come over to be with moses when she left she had a little baby she had jeremy when she went back she had four babies so that was quite a visit i said sister next time you come back you may have eight she just smiled yeah i don't know what she thought about that but i don't know how they'd get ate across the plane so they had quite an ordeal getting in because you have to have everybody you know has to be tested before they leave then you have to excuse me you have to go through a covet test before within 72 hours of leaving you have to have a negative covet test to fly over there when you land at the airport they test you again and so then it's it's it's hectic everything is hectic in uganda it's organized chaos so they give these resemblance of being organized but then once you get past the placards and signs it's just chaos every man for himself find a line get in get a test and hopefully they got your name on your test bottle and who knows what happens but so we we went through that so they had to go through all of that it was quite a challenge but they made it through and so they're going to be there for a month though i think they come back i think either the 7th or 8th of january so just pray for them they're having a really good time and it was good to see them there and see them happy and see their children playing with all their cousins and all the relatives so we that was one of the highlights of the trip for me to see them over there and you know i i've i've had three negative results on covet tests in the last two weeks i do not have coven that's one thing i'm sure of and each time i mean they violate your sinus cavity so bad they shove that thing so far back in your nose and some of them are a little nicer than others but some of them just get the job done you know they slam it back there and they pull it out the last test i did was in in tebay in uganda and you go into a clinic they call it a clinic i i thank god i didn't need any medical treatment well i was there going to the clinic to get the test so i'm sitting in one plastic chair and brother david's and the other one he's to get tested too and she comes through and she wants to do one in each nostril i don't know why in america we can just do one but they got to do two so this stuff went in and she shoved it so far back i coughed then she did the other one and i looked at brother david i said i can't believe it she hit my tonsils i didn't know you could hit tonsils from your nose so we were yeah i don't want to take any more covet tests i hope we can get past beyond that but i thank god the lord took care of it every time was a negative result i could travel everything worked out just perfect you know one positive test would have been so complicated so complex and but god worked it all out and i really thank him for that so i've been well tested i i have failed every kova test i've ever taken praise god i've never been so happy about failing tests so i got a negative result i think that's either four or five i've taken now so we had services on wednesday so we had services sunday and monday we had special meetings and invited some of the other area churches there was a couple visiting ministers from the area that were there services monday and two are i'm sorry sunday and monday tuesday we had off wednesday we had service and then thursday i got to spend the whole day with brother moses and sister mercy it was really nice because brother moses drove me around to see where he went to school he showed me where the first group was meeting in a school where he first come in contact with the message brother moses is the only believer in his family he was the first one to come in contact some other members of his family been baptized but they're not they walked away right now so he's the only believer in his family but he showed me the little school room where they met where he first come in contact with the truth showed me a little school where he went to primary school and showed me the road he walked to go to school it's quite a walk and so i really enjoyed you know he's part of us he's part of the family here but it was really good to go see where he grew up see his family where they're from so i really enjoyed that so brother moses took us out for a drive and so this is a little clip of what it's like driving down the road this is the secondary roads in a town a city called embale which this general area is the area where brother moses who grew up so i'm in the front seat i'm on the left side but i'm not driving they drive on the right side there so i'm shooting video but this gives you a feel what most of the roads are like and if you watch the dash bouncing up and down that's how you drive you bounce all over the place so those are what the majority of the roads are like they do have some asphalt roads between the cities and in a couple main thoroughfares in the cities and this is what it's like to be on one of those if you're a nervous passenger you just have to close your eyes and you just pray the first few times i was overseas that's all i would do i'd close my eyes and pray i wouldn't even watch them drive because i'm the kind of person who likes to have a little bit of control and when you're sitting over there you have no control and i mean there's people everywhere there's kids running across the road there's people motorcycles and bicycles and and vegetable stands and and trucks and parked cars and there's no lines there's chaos everything everywhere i used to just close my eyes and pray and now i just keep my eyes open and pray i'm advancing in my faith amen i'm doing better but but it's just normal it's so normal and what was interesting is brother moses is learning how to drive on the right-hand side of the car on the left-hand side of the road he learned to drive in america he didn't learn to drive there so when he went back he's learning to drive on the left-hand side on the right side of the car for the first time he says you know i'm learning to drive down i said oh praise god thank you praise the lord what a good place to learn i mean so i mean it's not like you can do anything wrong there's no traffic law so it's not like you can violate a traffic law you just drive you know it's funny because they even have traffic police but i do not know what they're there for i have no idea what they do i think they just stand there and every once in a while pull somebody over and talk to them that's what it looked like to me and then let them go so this is a brother moses sister mercy's house in uganda brother moses had sent some funds home to build a house it's not complete he told me it's about 60 percent complete but this is where they're staying when they went back home so this is mostly mercy's home we got to stay there this is moses's garden that you can see the banana trees some corn plants a papaya plant all of this is in his garden so this brother moses has his own his own vegetables and fruit there his own bananas and i asked him who keeps the garden he said his parents his parents live in the house just behind him they keep the garden for him so that was really neat to see that i don't know if you can see you see how blue the sky is in the background it's beautiful this was a real treat for me this was jeremy's sixth birthday so we got to go for jeremy's birthday party jeremy turns six he's got all his relatives there those are all some aunts and some cousins of brother moses family so he turned six we were there for his birthday party and it was interesting because jeremy was born there he's the only one of their four children that was born there he was born there and he went back to celebrate his sixth birthday so we had good time there this is brother moses is dead and so brother moses dan is a he's an anglican so he's been in the anglican church i believe all of his life and he's a very intelligent man he's been a schoolteacher for 40 years he just recently retired he's been teaching school in kenya and he's really really bright and he had some questions about the bible so this this man loves geography he loves to talk about geography around the world and ask questions and you tell him where you're from and he starts telling you rivers that are near you because he studies geography and mountain ranges and asks us all kinds of questions about united states but moses prompted him a little bit he said remember that you had a question about water baptism and so he asked us the question and we sat and witnessed this man for i mean i don't know how long we were talking to him talking about the creation of the world and talking about uh water baptism in jesus name and all kinds of stuff so that was a real treat and it was a real blessing and i could tell moses was excited because moses was wanting to get more truth to his dad and so we were there we were able to talk about water baptism we talked about the rapture we talked about some things in revelation talked about creation we just i bet we spent an hour or more maybe two hours just sitting talking and witnessing and so we just pray that god will bring some fruit from that so this is brother moses living room over there then we got to see sister mercy's mom this is sister mercy's mom's house so this is where her mother lives and we got to visit with her this is inside of her house and you can see it's just a teeny tiny little house this is the living room which would make up probably one third one third to half of the house and so we're in there visiting and this is sister mercy and her mom so it was really nice to get to see her mom to meet her and and so i was giving them good reports of how we all love sister mercy and we love brother moses and their parents were so happy that they're doing well here that they have friends and that people love them and that they're really part of a body and so it was really a blessing it was a blessing for me to get to meet them and carry a good report back to their parents and their parents were really blessed by that so it was like i said there was many different things that took place on this trip that i wasn't expecting and it was kind of out of the normal for me for a trip to go minister but it was really good this uh is again of course me and brother david but to the left-hand side of me is a brother named brother evans this is brother evans i'm going to see if i can get his name here and pronounce it correctly brother evans evans osumba evan zasumba all the way to the right is his wife evelyn and the sister next to her is catherine one of the sisters from the church they came down from kenya to be part of the meetings they came in as special guests for abraham for the wedding and for the services after and uh brother evans and i got a chance to talk and visit and and he began to share with us that he's been streaming our services for quite a while and in kenya they really went through an ordeal of people falling away from the message and really starting to really blaspheme and really speak evil the prophet and created quite a bit of confusion and he said while that was going on he said god led them to our services and he began to watch some things that he said really gave him a breakthrough like it totally he said it changed everything for me it gave me the strength to stand and and he was really thanking us for our services he wanted to send greetings to you guys as well he said greet the church for me tell him thank you for standing true he said it's been so exciting to see a group of people stand for the message and he wanted to send special greetings to all of you and so the brother was he he watches a lot of our services like he was telling me all kinds of stuff that we preached he preached as he preached this he preached this i said well there's no point for you to come to church on sunday because you know everything i can possibly preach and so but you know they they're tuned in and he's a minister also they've got a group there in kenya they have a church and a pastor and they're well established they're doing really well the group is standing strong and they're doing really well but it was excuse me it was a few years ago they went through that shaking and he said the word of god just grew and magnified in them and then they're they're able to really stand and and he was just really uh blessed but through watching the services here he saw brother abraham minister then he found abraham's testimony so they live he's about an eight hour drive eight to nine hour drive away in kenya so he drove um several months ago i think earlier in the year drove down to be part of a services there to meet brother abraham and they got acquainted they became friends and so when he knew that we were coming he came back down so now he and brother abraham are acquainted they've invited brother abraham up to kenya and it looks like he may be able to go up there and minister sometime so it was really neat just sometimes you just don't know what's going on on the other end you don't know i mean we know how god's blessing us we know how wonderful the word is for us and how we've grown and how god has established us in the truth and keeps establishing us in the truth but you really don't know that that's having an effect on somebody else as well you don't know that just standing for the truth gives somebody else courage to stand for the truth and so i just i just want to share that appreciation with you because the brother was really thankful that there was a group of people in america standing for the truth and it really blessed him and gave him the courage to stand so for me it was a real treat just to hear his testimony to hear the things that he said the things that blessed him it was a real real deep encouragement for me and so it's it's easy the devil's a really good discourager he's even easy to get discouraged but when you go and you meet a brother that you didn't know existed you know you had no idea who he was and where he was on earth and you didn't know anything about him and you sit across the living room from him and you just fell a ship and you find out he's in love with the same word you're in love with and he's growing just like you're growing and he's been benefited by anything that you were able to do and it just it's a great encouragement and god really blessed us that way and made it nice for us so that was a real special treat for me and we got to spend several days with this group from kenya and so it was it was quite a blessing the main event then started coming on friday thursday i spent the day with brother moses sister mercy friday is what they call introduction so i was introduced to all kinds of new things that i'd never seen or heard before and one thing i realized is weddings were a big deal everywhere on the planet i thought i thought i thought we were over the top on weddings boy was i wrong i'll never complain about our weddings anymore the armed weddings are great amen i've had the feeling you know we should simplify our wedding make it simple just get married after church i mean what's the big deal but when i traveled over there boy it's different the real big event to the wedding is the introduction the introduction took place at brother abraham's house these are the tents this is the brother abraham's front yard they bought with the tents from the church and strung them out for the guests and the introduction is interesting because you don't marry somebody in your own clan your clan would be like your family group so a tribe can be broke up into clans different extended family groups and you don't marry somebody from your clan you marry from another clan in your tribe or you can marry from another clan and another tribe and this happened to be a brother from another tribe and another clan but because you're from separate clans what they do is they have what they call introduction so when the boy and the girl decide that they're going to get married they talk to the parents they make all the arrangements then the parents of the bride will invite the family part of the clan or representing party from the clan of the groom over to meet pretty much the whole clan there was like 400 people at brother abraham's in his front yard so so they come and they meet the clan and this is a big deal this is actually bigger than the wedding itself because what they're doing is this i'm sharing this with you because i found it absolutely fascinating i was sitting there the whole time like this is amazing they're coming to take her and take her back to be part of their clan so the whole meeting is they're actually coming to fetch a bride they're coming with the groom they're represented as a family and they're coming to take her from this clan to their clan so the whole thing's deeply rooted in tradition that goes way back i mean way back before cell phones before uh any of that stuff and that's where this gets started and so what they do is they this representing party i think there was about 40 or 50 of them came and so we're sitting there waiting and as we're sitting there waiting um you know one thing i realize is nothing happens on time brother moses looked over at me one time i said i thought this started at 10 it was like 2 o'clock no 11 i think it was like 1 30 or 2. he goes he goes yeah you know moses he's quiet he goes time keeping is a bit of a problem for us i said yeah you don't say oh my goodness i said when we got to the next day to the wedding the wedding started four hours late and i was the one conducting the wedding i was preaching the wedding i was doing the vows i was doing the whole wedding and so for me i mean this is like i i work my schedule i like things regimented i like schedules and so i asked the night before what time does this start i asked the bride in the groom they had very specific he says we're going to start at 10 he goes and we'll not we know that some people will be late but 10 30 11 at the latest i said well that sounds like africa okay i can deal with that so i get up in the morning i get all my notes repaired i got the sermon online i get showered i get dressed i got my tie on and i and i come to breakfast i think 9 30 i think nine there we eat we'll go because we got to drive to in bali they had it at a hotel so you go to this hotel and then we just sit there and we just sit there and nobody else is dressed i mean the bride's in the house i mean so i know there's no wedding because it's not like we're missing anything and so i asked them well there's been a delay and then there was another delay and then there was another delay and then another delay and i i'm sitting here just like lord you've got to help me this is god did this to me because i need to be changed a bit i need to be less regimented i need to take things in stride i need to learn to let people be what they are and just smile and be a happy person so here i am dressed for a wedding for five hours i mean i don't mind dress clothes all that bad but no i don't like them that well so yeah it was interesting but back to introduction so this you can see is the bride and the groom brother abraham's second-born child but his oldest daughter her name is rebecca her future husband is brian they're married now so it's her husband brian and if you look at the sign and excuse me in the background it says rebecca introduces brian because her clans never met brian so they're coming and rebecca's going to introduce brian to the whole clan and everything has ceremonies i mean everything is is so interesting i mean this is a i can't stress how big a deal this is so we're sitting there and i mean i'm sitting here this is another one of those all day deals it's supposed to start at something it doesn't start and the key word is delay because now the groom's family was delayed okay so we're sitting there in the delay so they come and they make a little gate they make like a little hoop with some greenery and there's a gate and they come to the gate and they can't come in the gate until uh the bridesmaids have to go inspect and make sure they have an invitation to the right people and all this so there's a big ceremony back and forth and then they come and they say what are you here for and they give a microphone to the man and so the key spokesman for the clan that's coming says i'm here to pick a flower i said oh you want a flower this is no flower garden go home you know and they make it intentionally hard and this is all in good fun it's ingest but what they're trying to do is make the clan work for the girl they can't just come in and get her so they try to drive them away they try to discourage them they tell them we have no flowers go away and they have to be persistent i'm telling you if we had introductions like this i don't know who would get married i it's a lot of work so i was fascinated by the whole thing i'm sitting here thinking i have never seen anything like this in my life but it's also really interesting because it's deeply rooted in tradition and everything has a lot of meaning and so the groom comes and the groom is kind of hidden in the in the company and they go sit in chairs and they have their honor and guest so they have premium seating there as a family and he's kind of hidden in the back and at some point i mean there's all kinds of stuff that goes back and forth questions and they want to pick a flower so they said you want to pick a flower so they give them a flower he said that's not the flower i'm looking for this flower speaks this flower can talk and we were told if we could come we could get this flower and so they said oh so they march out like five girls from the tribe they're all dressed up march them out and they say any of these your flower and they said no this isn't the flower we're looking for and they go and they march in seven more and no and there's this whole ceremony that's not them and and the whole thing is set up to to make them really work for the one that they came for and so finally back and forth and back and forth and it's interesting because i was just cracking up because they really make them work they say okay i need transportation money to get some more so you can see some more flowers so the groom's family has to pay them and he pays them to go get seven more girls [Laughter] and then none of those oh he says well now we're going to have to take an airline it's going to be more money so he has to pay to go get more girls and and finally it all climaxes with rebecca coming out with her bridal party and it's a big hoopla and everybody's cheering and all of these things it was just super interesting i mean this has nothing to do with anything i'm just sharing it with you because i thought it was fascinating so finally rebecca then she'll go at one point and she'll go pull out of the crowd brian and then she brings brian out and introduces this is the formal introduction of brian to her family so i thought it was interesting i i like the traditional part of it but i mean a whole day ceremony like that i'm just glad we get married the way we do i mean keep it simple friends the vowels were the exact same i promise you i use the exact same vowels so the binding wedding is the same so so it was it was fun to see it anyways i got a lesson in ugandan culture and then i had to wear a traditional outfit this was really important to the family so they bought brother devitt and myself this is brother david myself and brother moses they bought us these i was calling them dresses but you probably shouldn't call them dresses they probably should be called i think they're called robes or something or gowns i don't remember what they said but it was very interesting i mean i'm not used to wearing anything like that so i was like i was i have sympathy from my girls you know you gotta gather this up to go up and down steps so you don't step on it and things like that i was learning all kinds of things i've never experienced before in my life so you wear you know you wear this and you wear a suit jacket over it that's the traditional thing and we were honored guests we were part of the household guest so we were part of the receiving party of the household so we were dressed like elder klans members i'm an elder member of the clan so he goes you're an elder in the cla i said yeah i blend right in i mean nobody can tell i'm a visitor i'm a clan elder now so i would like for you guys to call me elder elder lamb because i'm a clan elder so but i sat there and at one point i had my handkerchief in my front pocket and i leaned over to brother david i said is it bad manners to lift your dress to get something out of your pocket or would that be offensive or i'm not sure what i should do like what's protocol so i just snuck my hand up under my seat and got my handkerchief out so i don't know if i'm going to do something wrong or not so basically i just sat still and just watched the proceedings and i was just so glad i didn't have to do anything like i i was so glad i didn't have to take part so here here i am sitting as a member an elder clan member in uganda so praise god i'm an honorary clan member of the new title and if any of you would like to see it they gave me the robe so i have it you know i thought about wearing it tonight but i didn't think my family would go for that so but i'm telling you this was an experience and it was interesting and i was glad to be part of it but it was a long ordeal the time we were done i was exhausted and then we get up the next day and we go for the wedding the wedding is at a um hotel and it's outside under these tents this tent on the left is for the guests and this tent here is where the bride and groom and their best man and their maid of honor will be for the wedding and then there's a picture of moses and mercy and three of their children they were there at the wedding so it was good to spend some time with them again at the wedding this is brother abraham walking his daughter up to the tent and the the wedding ceremony is actually very similar to ours the ceremony itself is not a whole lot different it's it's pretty similar this is me i was doing the service there and we had a nice service i mean it was a nice pool it was it really went nice and i thank god for that and then this is brother abraham and i both of us had to sign the marriage certificate and the bride and groom signed it so this is the signing of the marriage certificate so the wedding went really well it was very nice wedding and uh it was um like i said brother i'm sorry brother brian the groom he's also the only believer in his family none of his members of his family are message believers at all so you know i just it was a golden opportunity for me to preach i preached about 45 minutes or so and i preached on god's masterpiece and how god developed his masterpiece through creation and we went into marriage and we went into all kinds of stuff and when i went to my seat and sat down one of his one of brian's aunts tapped me on the shoulder she goes that was the best preaching i've ever heard i've never heard marriage like that before and then two members of brian's family got in contact with brother abraham and said we've never heard the word like that we've never heard a message like that before and one one man come to brother abraham and said can i talk to you and he stepped aside and he says i've never heard anything like that you people have something different would you please lay your hands on me and pray for me that i could have god's blessing and they exchanged contact information with two different or three three different men there that wanted to know more so i just thank god and just pray that some fruit comes from that but it was it was really really interesting and they were captivated by the word you you know that they're not believers so about half of the crowd as believers about half of the crowd is not believers but they were so captivated by the word they're all nodding and they're all saying amen and you would think it was a room full of believers and i was just really blessed by that and i thank god for it for open hearts so we just pray that god will do something permanent there this is back at brother abraham and then on sunday we had a one service on sunday these are two ladies who bring in their babies to be dedicated i just thought that was interesting i never seen him do a dedication service before that so he was praying for the children this is the service that sunday morning i preached the you they're they're still under social distancing and mass mandates so you come to the pulpit with a mask and take it off and the congregation wears a mask but this uh translator the one who's interpreting for us is brother enoch this is brother abraham's oldest child his oldest son enoch and enoch was a good interpreter and we had a good time with enoch and he stuck with us the entire time i mean every service we we preached he he took the service and this last day was a long one but abraham said we're only going to have one service he says take your time you can preach three hours or more and so we did we end up preaching three hours because with an interpreter it just takes a long time and brother enoch was young and energetic and he stayed right with us it was funny because you know i'm preaching like i normally do but brother enoch's bouncing up and down like a kangaroo one point when he's interpreting because he's so excited about the word i thought man he's getting me all fired up and this is really good i mean you want to get me fired up and get you to preach just come stand next to me and bounce up and down like and get excited about the word because it was it was exciting and it was just a really really wonderful atmosphere a really wonderful service and god really blessed the word and i mean it was just tremendous i mean it was like it was like the atmosphere was swelling you know by the end of the service it would it would swell to an uproar and everybody on their feet it would crescendo and come back down and then you go to another part of the world and it was like ebbing and flowing and it was just a wonderful atmosphere and but abraham himself said that it was a tremendous blessing and i was so thankful but i was wiped out at the end of that and so we had that on sunday monday morning we woke up excuse me the long hot dusty drive all the way back to kampala when i got back to kampala i was so tired uh and i went to into the hotel and i went to wash my face they had a hand towel there and i washed my face and i wiped it off and it was just brown streaks all the way down from all the dust you pick up from the road and the sweat and no wonder i'm coughing this is the last slide i'm going to show this is the brother abraham brother abraham when he comes up after you preach i told him i said the only reason i preach is to hear you do the wrap up i'll come and preach just to hear you wrap up because he calls it the wrap up but what it is is another sermon and it's my favorite part of the trip to hear brother abraham do the wrap up but then he'll take the microphone and sing and believe abraham always says he goes really i'm a better song leader than a preacher and you know i don't believe that but he's a very good song leader and it's just amazing to see the way the people respond when he leads the worship so here's just a little sample of their worship here at the end this is a last day sunday [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] oh believe it or not i shuffled my feet a little bit and i enjoyed it it was such a good atmosphere it's amazing how people with nothing can worship so freely and be so happy i mean we would look at what they have and it'd be very hard for us to live a week the way most of the believers in that church live very very difficult but they're happy people the word has made them happy they rejoice and they sing with their whole heart and i enjoyed it it meant a lot to me i'd like to wrap up i just want to read a couple scriptures as we wind down and go to a close if you could take your bibles and turn with me to james just talk a little bit about why we do what we do james chapter 2 and verse 14. what does it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit so james is telling us if you see a brother in need and you say lord bless you and he says but you have means to help them and you don't help them what does it profit what is the good of saying the lord bless you be warmed and be filled but if you have an ability to do so do good i want to look at this in romans i'm just going to look at three more scriptures let's look at romans chapter 15. romans chapter 15 and verse 24. he says whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way to their word by you if first i'd be somewhat filled with your company but now i go into jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it has pleased them in macedonia and achaea to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem it hath pleased them verily that they're debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister into them in carnal things when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you unto spain now let's turn to first corinthians 16. there's several descriptions we can go to but i just want to read enough to get a context first corinthians 16 and 1. first corinthians 16 and 1. now concerning the collection for saints as i've given order to the children of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week excuse me let every one of you lay by him in store as god has prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come and when i come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters then will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem and if it be meat that i go also they shall go with me both in romans and and first corinthians here and somewhere else in the epistles too he's talking about they're making a gathering and he he's encouraged the churches in macedonia and that's all through greece there they decided to set money aside for the poor saints that are in jerusalem and so you can see all the way back in the apostle paul's day they were gathering money for other brothers that had needs and the brothers in jerusalem were the poor brothers the poor saints that were in need so so paul's admonishing them and encouraging them save up and he's even telling them how to lay it aside so they don't gather up when he gets there and there'll be one appointed to carry it out carry it through and and paul said even he could take it himself when he talked to the romans so you can see that this kind of missionary work and also relieving the needs of others has been going on since the bible time has been going on since the time of paul and let's read one more in galatians if we could galatians chapter 6. galatians chapter 6 verse 9 and let us not be weary in will doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so the apostle paul is encouraging us to reap to sow and we'll reap don't grow weary and well doing but when you have opportunity to let us do good unto all men especially them that are of the household of faith and i say we've had a blessed opportunity to do something for our brothers abroad it's been a real blessing to be able to help some brothers we've helped with all kinds of different needs over the years you know brother lonnie was a real missionary and he really kind of got this church set with a missionary mindset and i'm thankful for that because it's good sometimes to look outside our own walls and to recognize what's going on elsewhere in the world and get a feeling for brothers in other parts of the world and for the work that they're doing and if there's something we can do to help them if it's a motorcycle if it's the help of the building if it's to help print books if it's to help pay for a plane ticket for them to go minister if there's something that we can do and it's and it's in our power to do it i say it's a blessing for us to be able to do that because that's been happening since the time of the apostle paul he even speaks in the epistles where a brother and a group in macedonia sent by a brother of funds to help paul out and paul the apostle paul says they came to support me for your lack you didn't give me but they came from far away to support me so even even the apostle paul is getting support from other churches not the church he's at but other churches are supporting his missionary works so and then the traveling around and ministering to the brothers if you read the epistles paul's always sending this brother go to that church and once you go there come by here and i'll send this brother there you take a letter to this brother and you guys receive this brother and and paul is sending brothers out to encourage the churches and send this one here and you take my greetings and you come to me and when you come to me bring this and bring this brother and leave that brother there and have you read the have you read the epistles and read the book of acts so this going to encourage our brothers in other cities has been going on since the time of paul missionary work has been going on since the time of paul supporting the needs of other brothers have been going on since the time of paul supporting the minister who's going out has been going since the time of paul so really when we do these kind of works we're just supporting a long-standing christian tradition that started in the ministry of the apostle paul in the first century christians and i say it's a privilege it's a privilege to be able to do something and see god bless it and see the people and then to be able to follow up and go and see the work let's see the people are happy the work's establishing the work's growing brother abraham does a radio ministry once a week every week he preaches for two hours he preaches one hour in english and one hour in his native tribal language and he sees many results from that people are coming to the church people are going to other churches in the area he's always getting contacts and calls and so the brother is always out and always working and it's been a privilege to be able to help him i thank god that somebody put it on the heart of a brother to give him a house that he could use for the ministry that would really support him and his household and give him an ability to keep it i think god god put that on somebody's heart i thank god we've been able to help him somewhat in the past and hopefully we can help him with a building here in the future maybe to expand the church i thank god for that and then the other brothers we haven't been doing as much as we had because coveted shut down a lot of the mission work excuse me a lot of the traveling but if things begin to pick up i want to pick up with it amen i want to be able to do what we can do amen i want to i want to follow in the tradition of the of the elders and the tradition of the apostle paul i want to keep doing the work that god's given us to do as long as we can i say you know with these experiences that we've had and seeing the brothers around the world and have them come visit us and some of our brothers go visit them it makes our experience richer deeper and it and it gives us a better understanding to me seeing these brothers in other lands gives me a better understanding of the message their perspective and their understanding and then it gives us a chance to share brotherly love brotherly love is right next to charity to perfect love if you can't have brotherly love how will you ever come to capstone love and god gives us opportunities to share that and i'm thankful that that brother lonnie started us down this track and i'm thankful that the work continues to go it's a blessing to be part of it and i thank god for a church body that has the same vision i say god bless you thank you for your support for supporting the brothers that out there supporting missions thank you for praying for us praying for our family thank you for supporting the local work i say i just want to say god bless you we love you it's good to be home i'm looking forward to being home i'm looking forward to seeing my family spending some time with them my plane landed at 5 pm in dayton i drove straight here grabbed a shower saw my family over there and come to see you and i feel like now that i've seen your faces and we've had a chance to talk to one another now i can go rest amen and my rest will be sweet because i really wanted to see and i really wanted to give you this report and tell you what a blessing time it was and so many things that took place that were unexpected you know the the fellowship of brother david the the brothers from kenya the time with moses and mercy these are things that i really wasn't my main target i was going to do a wedding but i found there was just as much fruit in these other things and when you just let god lead your footsteps you don't always know you know it's hard to go this was a hard trip to go on you don't know what's going to happen you don't know for sure that coming back is secure you don't even know they're getting in the country secure traveling is not as easy as it used to be and it has certain amount of risks but but i went because i felt like i i ought to go i felt like god wanted me to go and i'm so glad i did and i was going for one objective and that objective was a real blessing to brother abraham and his family and i'm glad that we could bless them that way but in return there was other tremendous things that were going on all around and i thank god for that so the footsteps of the righteous are truly ordered to the lord i wasn't expecting all these other fruitful events and things to take place i wasn't expecting to get the witness to brother moses's dad for an hour and a half i wasn't expecting to meet these brothers from kenya this brother from south africa and get to have a deep fellowship with him and encourage him in the word some i didn't expect all that i didn't expect to be a tribal clan elder that was a bonus but i'm going to see if i can get a plaque and put it on my wall it'll make me feel better this one say i love you god bless you thank you for praying may god continually bless us and help us to be focused on his business his work let's all stand musicians if you can come and brother ben as we part i just pray that the lord will give you a blessed weekend this weekend with the christmas weekend coming up you get to spend a lot of time with family and i hope you enjoy your time with the family and you know many of us will meet with unbelieving family as well and may god just prosper that may something good come from that time may god use it just to drop another seed just to create another little opportunity and maybe we won't even see the fruit of that for some time but but let's go with that in our hearts and in our minds that god will do something time is drawing short the world's in chaos but we've got something that the world needs and you can't force feed it to somebody you can't make them take it but but when you're there just i'm always cognizant i'm always paying attention god what would you want me to say is there's something i can say is there some opportunity to say something because you're sitting there with people you love and you know they need what you've got and you would love to share with them so may god bless you in all your family gatherings and in your time together in your homes and your families and may god be with you and for all the children don't forget you have some imported chocolate from amsterdam may may you enjoy it down at the welcome desk and if you consider yourself a child you can have it i should have set up a camera to see how many children we have in the assembly amen we love you and we appreciate you so much appreciate your care for our family appreciate your support of the ministry and may god just richly bless you let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of being able to come here and give this report tonight we're so thankful for the things that you've done lord the unexpected blessings along the way the conversations the encouragement lord the fruit that came from conversations from ministry from your word from unexpected places go on i just pray that you would allow that those seeds that were planted to bring forth them much fruit may you prosper them along the way lord bless this congregation for their sacrifice or sacrifice in their pastor lord giving of their resources their prayer i just pray you restored to them a hundred fold what they gave out i thank you for their kindness to me and my family lord and i pray you'd replenish repay and overflow with blessings god bless us as we go from here lord as we look to a christmas season lord may our hearts be full of worship lord the rest of the world they do what they do but lord we have a different understanding a different vision a different desire may we not forget lord what a precious gift that you've given to us and what a precious thing you've done for us and may our hearts be full of worship bless us bless us in our gatherings you let that light shine through us lord if there's any gathering with unbelieving family i pray god that you would shine the light brighter than ever may it take an effect upon the people for god we want to see our family saved we want to see lord them come to the knowledge of truth go on we want it so bad but we don't know what else to do but apply the token and live the life and we're asking you to do the rest lord do the part that we can't do we love him we
