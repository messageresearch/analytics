========================================

you remember when the Rich Young Ruler come to Jesus Christ and he says what must I do to gain eternal life to inherit eternal life and he says you know the Commandments you know don't steal on her father and mother and he starts to go through some of the Commandments that Moses gave and he says I've done all of these from my youth this is a picture of a Pharisee he he had lived clean he had lived pure he had done him from his youth amen and so he he felt pretty good about his condition and he was able to answer in the affirmative to Jesus when he gave him some requirements to meet he said I've met all of these requirements from my youth so he did not have a defiled body amen and he was obedient to the law of Moses and and he was walking in the statutes and the judgments of the Lord amen and right there in the midst of the the religion of the day amen but Jesus said to him if thou will be perfect if that will be perfect sell all thou has and given to the poor and come follow me and and the man went away sorrowfully for he hadn't much goods and Jesus wept after him because Jesus loved him amen Jesus statement was not a statement of condemnation because he didn't love him it was an opportunity for this man to go past the religion and come to the reality past the form past the ritual pass the respect of people amen what would have happened to this man if he sold all of his guns where would he have been in society what would the religious leaders of the day thought of him well he would have been a fool he would have been mocked he would have been an outcast then he would have been nobody all the friends that he had with him no longer been friends if he had sold all of his wealth given to the poor and come follow Jesus he would be just as much Outcast as everybody else that followed Jesus was and this man wasn't willing he he wanted eternal life but he did not want to have a perfect heart Jesus wasn't looking for those who just wanted a reward he was looking for those who wanted him
