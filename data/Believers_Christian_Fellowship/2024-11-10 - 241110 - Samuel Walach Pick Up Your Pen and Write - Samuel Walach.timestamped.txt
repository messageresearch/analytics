[16:57] then when we are in his presence then we
[17:01] see glory in each face amen we can see
[17:04] his power we can see his glory we can

[17:10] so thankful for that for for those that
[17:12] are bought with the with the blood of
[17:14] the Lamb amen for the purchased amen for
[17:19] those that are included in the book The
[17:21] Book of redemption amen we are so glad
[17:23] to be a part amen it's good to see all
[17:26] of your faces uh most of you you I know
[17:29] at least by faith and hopefully like
[17:33] brother brother Chad said that we are no
[17:35] strangers to each other amen even if we
[17:38] hadn't seen each other before we know
[17:41] that we've seen each other before before
[17:43] the foundation of the world Amen so if
[17:46] we do not recall seeing each other let's
[17:48] just look further back amen amen and we
[17:53] we were all found in the back part of
[17:54] God's mind amen amen so we are so
[17:58] thankful that the word put us together
[18:01] amen the word let us recognize our
[18:04] family amen praise the Lord so I'm so
[18:08] thankful to be here thank you for the
[18:10] invitation BR Chad and it's an honor to
[18:12] stand before you amen not just before
[18:15] you because I I like you I like your
[18:17] pastor you know but uh it is an honor to
[18:19] stand before the Bride of Jesus Christ
[18:22] amen to serve each other amen because
[18:26] it's not only uh the vessel that
[18:28] standing behind the pulpit that's
[18:30] serving the people in the audience but
[18:32] it goes from the audience back to the
[18:34] pulpit you know it's God everywhere it's
[18:37] God not only behind the pulpit but it's
[18:39] God in the pews amen it is the response
[18:42] of the word it is the Deep calling to
[18:44] the Deep amen not only calling but there
[18:48] is an answer back there's a response
[18:50] amen so I I believe that it is a time to
[18:53] move into the depth of the message amen
[18:56] we've covered the length we've covered
[18:58] the width we've covered the height of
[19:01] the message amen but you know with the
[19:04] width the the length it is only as far
[19:07] as you can go amen sometimes there are
[19:10] limits to that but when you enter into
[19:12] the deep amen that's where the limits
[19:15] are off amen you think you've reached uh
[19:18] the the bottom of the ocean but then you
[19:21] keep diving you keep diving and there's
[19:23] an another place a de deeper pocket that
[19:25] opens up to you amen and that's what we
[19:28] we we came here for Amen to discover the
[19:31] depth of the word amen not to be just
[19:34] shallow Believers amen I believe I
[19:37] believe there there aren't any shallow
[19:39] message Believers amen if you're a true
[19:42] message believer amen you you've
[19:45] recognized that four dimension amen the
[19:47] depth of the word the depth of the
[19:49] message praise the Lord amen so we want
[19:53] to cast to The Deep this morning amen
[19:56] praise the Lord so while you're standing
[19:58] Let's uh turn thank you musicians I
[20:01] appreciate you amen music uh we'll turn
[20:05] to Ephesians chapter 1:
[20:11] 3-2
[20:22] amen you know it's it's good to relax in
[20:25] the presence of the Lord amen actually
[20:28] that's the only
[20:29] way how we can receive blessings from
[20:31] the Lord is when we are relaxed amen and
[20:34] be being relaxed as uh in the fact of
[20:37] who you are amen that brings such a
[20:40] comfort amen uh you know uh I can do
[20:44] myself best you know I cannot replicate
[20:47] anybody else I may try we as humans we
[20:51] try to replicate we try to copy each
[20:53] other uh but if you stay you that's how
[20:56] God likes you best amen amen because he
[20:59] purchased you amen exactly how you are
[21:03] he thought of you before the foundation
[21:04] of the world and he liked you that way
[21:07] amen so don't try to be somebody else
[21:10] amen you are ruining the plan of God
[21:14] Amen praise the Lord so Ephesians
[21:17] chapter 1:
[21:20] 3-2 blessed be the God and father of our
[21:23] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[21:26] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[21:29] places in Christ according as he has
[21:32] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[21:34] of the world that we should be holy and
[21:38] Without Blame before him in love having
[21:42] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[21:45] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[21:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[21:51] will to the praise of the glory of his
[21:54] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[21:57] in the Beloved
[21:59] in whom we have Redemption through his
[22:01] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[22:04] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[22:08] hath abounded towards us in all wisdom
[22:10] and Prudence having made known unto us
[22:13] the mystery of his will according to his
[22:17] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[22:20] himself that in the dispensation of the
[22:23] fullness of times amen he might gather
[22:26] together in one all things in Christ
[22:29] both which are in heaven and which are
[22:31] on earth even in him in whom also we
[22:35] have obtained an inheritance being
[22:38] predestinated according to the purpose
[22:40] of him who worketh all things after the
[22:43] counsel of his own will that we should
[22:47] be to the praise of his glory who first
[22:50] trusted in Christ amen and another
[22:54] scripture found in 2 Corinthians chapter
[22:57] 3
[22:58] verse
[23:00] 2 through
[23:11] 6 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verses
[23:20] 2-6 so Paul writes ye are our Epistles
[23:25] written in our hearts known and read of
[23:28] all man
[23:29] for as M for as much as ye are
[23:33] manifestly declared to be the apost the
[23:35] Epistles of Christ ministered by US
[23:38] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[23:40] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[23:44] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[23:47] such trust have we through Christ to God
[23:50] word not that we are sufficient of
[23:53] ourselves to think anything as of
[23:55] ourselves but our sufficiency our
[23:58] ability is of God Amen who also hath
[24:02] made us able Ministers of the New
[24:04] Testament not of the letter but of the
[24:07] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[24:11] giveth life amen I'm so glad for the
[24:15] balance in the teaching of Paul amen he
[24:18] he he points to our position and then he
[24:21] writes but our sufficiency is of God
[24:24] Amen our ability comes from God Amen let
[24:28] us remember that as we bow our heads for
[24:31] a word of prayer Heavenly Father we want
[24:34] to stand here father appreciate you for
[24:37] who you are father appreciate your love
[24:40] appreciate your mercy appreciate your
[24:42] grace father appreciate father what
[24:44] you've done in our day and age Lord that
[24:47] you stoop down father that you made your
[24:50] presence known to your people father
[24:53] what what we could do father without
[24:55] your presence we couldn't do much Lord
[24:57] we could guide here we could gather here
[25:00] around a a word of a man father maybe
[25:03] have a good feeling about it but Lord
[25:06] your presence does the difference Lord
[25:08] your presence is here to heal every
[25:11] broken heart father M every situation
[25:14] Lord give us a better perspective of
[25:17] your word father give us a better
[25:19] perspective of the Plan of Redemption
[25:21] that you have for our lives Lord so let
[25:23] us just come Lord and relax in your
[25:25] presence because we know that we are in
[25:28] the presence of our bridegroom Lord we
[25:30] don't want to be tense Lord we don't
[25:32] want to uh put up a show Lord we don't
[25:35] want to uh try to be somebody else we
[25:38] just want to be ourselves Lord in your
[25:40] presence Lord having the confidence that
[25:43] you've chosen us before the foundation
[25:44] of the world Lord and we thank you for
[25:47] that we want to commit ourselves into
[25:49] your hands with the scriptures that
[25:51] we've read may you open the depth of the
[25:53] word to us Lord may we dive in today
[25:57] Lord and just be found immersed in your
[25:59] presence Lord in the name of Jesus
[26:01] Christ we pray amen amen you you can
[26:04] take your seats praise the
[26:07] Lord amen so you know what it's it's
[26:11] it's it's a wonderful thing the time
[26:14] that we live in the end times amen for
[26:18] some people that's a dreadful thought to
[26:20] even think that we are at the end of
[26:22] time that uh these are the the end times
[26:26] you know and people even in the world
[26:29] people that have nothing to do with the
[26:31] Bible with with religion or or with the
[26:34] message they just recognize that it's
[26:36] the end time amen that something is
[26:39] coming to a close amen and they are
[26:42] fearful and they should be fearful amen
[26:46] because if you are not right with God
[26:48] the end times should be a dreadful day
[26:50] of the Lord amen but in the same time at
[26:54] the time of the Dreadful day of the Lord
[26:57] it is the most glorious time revealed
[26:59] for the Believers amen so God works in
[27:02] the law of contrast there is always a
[27:05] contrast on one hand the end times are
[27:08] Dreadful to the unbeliever but they are
[27:10] the GL most glorious time for the
[27:12] believer amen so it is so wonderful to
[27:15] be found on the right side of the end
[27:18] times Amen to be in the Glorious part of
[27:21] the end times because that's a glorious
[27:23] bride that's a glorious Church you know
[27:26] and we've been observing serving we've
[27:28] been watching The Plan of Redemption for
[27:31] so many years we look at the Bible we
[27:33] look at the scriptures we see the Plan
[27:36] of Redemption being unfolded before our
[27:38] eyes you know but the thing is that we
[27:42] don't want to just observe it we don't
[27:44] want to watch The Plan of Redemption
[27:46] because if you are a theologian maybe
[27:49] you are a scholar maybe you are going to
[27:51] see parts of the Redemption of the Plan
[27:53] of Redemption throughout the Bible and
[27:55] see and observe what God has been doing
[27:58] throughout history but you know what
[28:00] it's something different to be a a

[29:14] excited for your friend for somebody
[29:16] that's close to you amen but then you
[29:19] know after after you leave after two
[29:21] days you don't remember anything about
[29:23] the blueprint of the house amen you are
[29:26] not that excited about the plan of your
[29:29] friend's house amen he may have the best
[29:31] materials that he's going to use but you
[29:34] know that's just his blueprint that's
[29:36] his plan amen but is something different
[29:40] if that's your own plan amen if that's

[30:01] you're not just observing the plan
[30:03] you're not watching somebody else
[30:05] getting excited but you are a
[30:08] participant you are a partaker amen and
[30:11] the scripture uh was written not to be
[30:15] just a book not to just be a good
[30:17] concept A Plan of Redemption but it it
[30:20] it always stresses The Importance of
[30:23] Being a partaker amen of having even
[30:26] Jesus in the time of the Comm union he
[30:29] told Peter that if you do not uh do
[30:32] these things you will have no Parton me
[30:35] amen you will not be a partaker of the
[30:37] plan of God you will not be involved
[30:40] amen but we are so thankful that we are
[30:43] involved and included in the Plan of
[30:46] Redemption praise the Lord you can be
[30:48] excited about the Minor Details but you
[30:51] can be excited about where the the
[30:53] electric Outlets will be how you will
[30:55] run your cables what type of isolation
[30:58] you'll use what kind of you know sound
[31:01] system you'll use in the church amen if
[31:03] you are invested in that that changes
[31:06] your perspective amen I'm so thankful
[31:09] for the message of this hour that gave
[31:12] us a new perspective on the word of God
[31:15] a fresh look on the word of God Amen and
[31:19] and perspective in the Greek is the art
[31:22] of seeing amen and we've had somebody
[31:25] who came in our day and age he was the
[31:27] prophet of this age he was the eyes for
[31:30] Our Generation amen and so we received
[31:34] the art we saw the art art of seeing
[31:37] amen seeing from another perspective
[31:40] from from another Viewpoint from a
[31:42] different position amen because the
[31:45] message of this hour revealed our
[31:47] position in Christ amen it put us on a
[31:51] higher pedestal it put us on a higher
[31:53] position that's why we look at things
[31:56] differently praise the Lord
[31:58] amen so we know about the Plan of
[32:00] Redemption that uh we saw God in the
[32:03] very beginning he was The Great I Am he
[32:05] was the alls sufficient one the the one
[32:09] that was so glorious so in inaccessible
[32:12] that the Angels they had to cover their
[32:14] faces because of the glory that was
[32:16] involved the the glory that was in
[32:19] heaven amen it was so distant it was so
[32:22] powerful that was so awesome and So
[32:25] Glorious amen and we knew that God had a
[32:29] certain plan amen once things were going
[32:33] uh bad and everything uh just collapsed
[32:37] during the fall amen we knew that God
[32:39] was in control we knew that God had a
[32:42] plan that's been uh that's been in his
[32:45] mind a a plan to fix the situation amen
[32:49] he already had that plan before the
[32:51] problem arose amen that's so wonderful
[32:55] that God is a good parent he's always
[32:57] prepared he's always prepared for every
[33:00] kind of situation amen because he gave
[33:03] us the free will to choose amen he gave
[33:06] us options and you know what he's
[33:08] prepared for every option that you take
[33:11] amen he's always been prepared for a
[33:13] human being to choose whatever he likes
[33:16] whatever was in his heart but God had a
[33:19] plan amen he had a plan to bring the the
[33:23] elect back to the line with the word
[33:26] amen praise the Lord you know so we knew
[33:29] God he was inaccessible we knew that he
[33:32] had a plan and we didn't understand his
[33:34] plan amen we just knew that he was in
[33:36] control that he was going to take care
[33:39] of the situation amen but you know if
[33:42] you are not if you're just watching God
[33:44] fixing something or or watching watching
[33:47] how God plans a certain route for your
[33:50] life or for somebody else's life you
[33:52] know you're just an observer amen and
[33:55] and so that's why you cannot be excited
[33:58] about the word if you're just an
[33:59] observer this morning amen but the word
[34:02] calls us to be partakers Amen partakers
[34:06] to Take A Part A an active part in the
[34:09] plan of God Amen not just being passive
[34:12] about it not just coming to church and
[34:15] watching What will what will come out of
[34:17] it what the preacher has in store
[34:20] whether he's uh he's in a good mood or
[34:22] in a bad mood whether he's on fire or
[34:24] he's Less on fire brother and sister you
[34:27] need to to be on fire amen you need to
[34:30] be in the same Plan of Redemption as the
[34:33] preacher is amen we are working in it
[34:36] together there is no place for an
[34:38] observer in the kingdom of God Amen
[34:41] there is only place for somebody who is
[34:44] a an adopted son of God that means there
[34:47] is a son in its position ready to be
[34:50] active ready to be used of the Lord
[34:53] praise the Lord so you know we see God
[34:56] that from this in visible God he became
[34:59] a visible God in the form of Jesus
[35:02] Christ amen it was the same God he he he
[35:06] he told the people that before Abraham
[35:08] was I am amen so he revealed that there
[35:12] is not something new that it is not a a
[35:15] different God it is the same God just in
[35:17] a human form amen so we saw God that
[35:21] from this being that was inaccessible he
[35:24] became tangible he became accessible for
[35:27] from somebody that was far away he
[35:29] became somebody close to us amen and
[35:33] that's that makes such a difference amen
[35:35] from the god in the heavens uh the the
[35:38] the object of worship there where he was
[35:41] worshiped by the angels and by the by
[35:43] the Heavenly beings and so on it was so
[35:46] glorious but God was not satisfied with
[35:49] the state of being amen he wasn't
[35:52] satisfied with this glorious Arrangement
[35:55] that that was happening in heaven amen
[35:58] he needed something more amen he needed
[36:01] something more than than just to be
[36:04] praised and worshiped and adored amen
[36:06] praise the Lord so that's why he
[36:09] implemented his Plan of Redemption
[36:11] praise the Lord so and you know uh the
[36:15] Mysteries the Mysteries all of the
[36:17] prophecies everything that was spoken in
[36:19] the Old Testament was revealed in Jesus
[36:22] Christ amen he was the exposition of the
[36:25] mystery he was the revelation of all of
[36:27] the prophets all of the seers all of the
[36:29] Scrolls that were written amen all of
[36:32] the scriptures that pertained to Christ
[36:35] they they were embodied in that man of
[36:37] Galilee amen praise the Lord so that was
[36:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ and it
[36:42] turned out that these crws these
[36:45] prophecies that were written about him
[36:48] he that was the Fulfillment of the law
[36:50] he was the Fulfillment of the law he was
[36:52] the Fulfillment of this cross praise the
[36:55] Lord amen but the secret was unveiled to
[36:58] just a few amen he made himself known
[37:03] just to the elect just to the few amen
[37:06] he had a public Ministry in Israel yes
[37:09] amen but his revelation of who he truly
[37:12] was was just to the very elect amen so
[37:16] there are people in our ranks in in in
[37:19] denominations that know the prophet that
[37:21] know the know the message because it is
[37:24] public it is available amen but there
[37:26] are there is just a handful of people
[37:29] who are able to receive uh what the
[37:32] message is truly what what what the
[37:34] message is truly about amen praise the
[37:37] Lord you know so when when when the
[37:40] disciples like the two disciples on the
[37:43] road to EMAs they were traveling there
[37:46] and they talked with a stranger that's
[37:50] at least what they thought there was a
[37:52] stranger that joined to them and they
[37:54] started to have Fellowship Fellowship
[37:56] around the world and Jesus uh being
[38:00] revealed in another form that's what the
[38:01] scripture tells us he he was the same
[38:04] Jesus but he was in a different form
[38:05] that was the same God but he had a
[38:07] different mask on and the people that
[38:09] were following him the people that were
[38:12] uh just around him every day for three
[38:16] and a half years they weren't able to
[38:18] recognize him that's right amen wow
[38:21] that's that's that's something amen that
[38:24] shows us the nature of God how he would
[38:26] hide himself
[38:28] amen even from the elect it seemed but
[38:31] he knows that the elect they've got
[38:33] something on the inside of them that
[38:35] eventually they'll they'll recognize him
[38:38] amen and that's what God expects of us
[38:41] today to eventually recognize him
[38:44] despite the mass despite the form
[38:47] despite the uh how odd or weird it seems
[38:52] to recognize God behind human skin Amen
[38:55] to recognize God in a certain situation
[38:58] that comes your way to recognize God in
[39:01] a problem amen we wouldn't associate God
[39:05] veiling himself in a problem but that's
[39:08] usually what he does Amen if there is a
[39:11] problem if there is a challenge coming
[39:13] your way and coming my way Amen Let us
[39:16] be still and see the salvation of the
[39:18] Lord let us see what's in that problem
[39:22] amen we need to enter our storm Amen
[39:26] brother Bram during the manifestation of
[39:28] the third pole God didn't you know he
[39:31] taught the people that once you see the
[39:34] snowflakes coming and the wind blowing
[39:36] head to Camp go back to Camp that was
[39:39] the teaching of the prophet of that hour
[39:42] he taught it to his brothers to the
[39:44] brothers that were with him go back to
[39:47] safety amen Whenever there are problems
[39:50] come back to church maybe go and talk
[39:52] with the minister talk with your pastor
[39:54] we'll fix it amen you'll be all right
[39:57] don't
[39:59] worry but then God came to the prophet
[40:02] when he was about to to to agree and to
[40:05] follow H his instructions and he was
[40:08] heading to the camp like he taught the
[40:10] brothers but then God stood in his way
[40:13] and he told him go back to the storm you
[40:16] see that problem coming your way don't
[40:18] run away from it you used to run away
[40:20] from it you used to teach the people
[40:23] that it's the best possible solution to
[40:26] run away from your problem
[40:28] amen come to church come to a place of
[40:31] safety but God wanted to deal with the
[40:34] prophet individually not in the camp
[40:37] amen Camp is all right amen Fellowship
[40:40] is fine it's all good it's all there for
[40:43] a purpose but there comes a time when
[40:46] you need to have an individual walk with
[40:49] God Amen you need to have a relationship
[40:52] you need to have a change in your
[40:55] life amen
[40:57] and change won't happen in the
[41:00] camp amen you need to go back to the
[41:03] place where God asks you to go amen
[41:07] where it's him and you alone amen that's
[41:11] the fellowship between you and the
[41:13] almighty God Amen so B Brown was
[41:16] reluctant because it it went against all
[41:19] of his teaching all of his experience as
[41:21] a guide yes everything that he was used
[41:24] to amen it went against it but anyways
[41:30] there was something on the inside amen
[41:32] there was something at first he didn't
[41:33] recognize God in the storm but then
[41:37] eventually he recognized that it was the
[41:39] form of God God veiled himself in a
[41:41] storm in a big huge problem amen
[41:45] something that was that was ready to
[41:47] kill him amen but he entered the storm
[41:50] amen and that's when God told him don't
[41:53] you want want to walk with me amen don't
[41:56] you want to have Fellowship sh with me
[41:58] and that's when the prophet he he was
[42:00] transformed he said my body it became
[42:03] new in every aspect of the word amen I I
[42:07] not only looked like a boy I I felt like
[42:10] a boy I thought as a boy amen praise the
[42:14] Lord so that's where the change is when
[42:17] you recognize God and he may be veiled
[42:21] you know he may be veiled in your
[42:22] brother he may be veiled in a situation
[42:25] in a problem he may be veiled in your
[42:27] enemy amen he can do it amen and every
[42:32] time he expects you to recognize him
[42:36] amen not only in a brother it's very
[42:38] easy to recognize him in a brother or or
[42:41] in a brother that you like amen because
[42:43] they're are different Brothers amen
[42:45] sometimes we have brothers that we have
[42:47] a you know uh we know they are brothers
[42:50] right but we don't think there is much
[42:53] behind that
[42:54] mask but God expects us to to look
[42:57] Beyond The Mask amen he doesn't make it
[43:01] easy he didn't make it easy for the two
[43:03] disciples that were on the way to EMAs
[43:06] amen that's right it wasn't easy but
[43:09] there was a little pattern amen there
[43:11] was a little something that they could
[43:13] tell by the breaking of the bread how
[43:15] the word was being shared they said
[43:18] that's God Alone amen that's the same
[43:20] God that we've witnessed for three and a
[43:22] half years amen praise the Lord you know
[43:26] and once they saw God not only in the
[43:29] Jesus of of Galilee or or or Jesus of
[43:33] Nazareth they they saw him in a stranger
[43:36] that was passing their way amen they saw
[43:39] him in a different form that's when the
[43:41] Scrolls came alive amen because they
[43:44] were fellowshipping they were
[43:46] fellowshipping around the word around
[43:48] the Scrolls but during that Journey from
[43:51] Jerusalem to to to EMAs amen these crws
[43:56] became a new book to them amen these
[44:00] craws contained something more than they
[44:03] ever had a chance to read in amen they
[44:06] read something in those crws that they
[44:10] hadn't seen before praise the Lord and
[44:13] so the next time they opened this cross
[44:15] they opened the law of Moses they opened
[44:18] Jeremiah they opened Isaiah all they
[44:20] could see was Christ amen because they
[44:24] met him face to face they recognized his
[44:27] presence and that changed their whole
[44:30] perspective praise the Lord amen you
[44:34] know that was the same Jesus that they
[44:36] touched that they uh had fellowship with
[44:39] that they ate bread and ate fish and so
[44:41] on but now that was somebody else
[44:44] somebody more than that praise the Lord
[44:46] and once they saw the unveiling of God
[44:50] they couldn't unse see it amen once they
[44:52] saw this the Scrolls uh made a new they
[44:55] couldn't see it in the old pattern amen
[44:59] they they couldn't I mean they could
[45:00] sympathize with the with the people in
[45:03] the synagogue they could relate to them
[45:05] because they've been that way but they
[45:07] couldn't have the same kind of
[45:09] Fellowship amen because once you see the
[45:12] word that's that's been revealed to you
[45:15] you cannot unsee it amen and I'm not
[45:18] talking just about a quote that's been
[45:20] revealed to you amen that you like or
[45:23] that makees sense to you or or you put
[45:26] or you could attack some logic to it
[45:28] amen that's seeing the word made flesh
[45:32] amen bam tells us in the sermon the
[45:36] Masterpiece he says now for nearly 2,000
[45:40] years God has been again making a
[45:43] masterpiece because he struck Adam to
[45:46] get a masterpiece off of him part of him
[45:49] a rib to make a wife for him and now
[45:52] that perfect Masterpiece that he struck
[45:55] at Calvary he he got a piece off of him
[45:59] it's just the New Testament that's all
[46:02] he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's
[46:05] the New Testament another piece to be
[46:08] fulfilled see the old and the new is
[46:11] husband and wife see and it taken the
[46:15] new the all to foreshadow the new Christ
[46:18] come the Masterpiece to fulfill that
[46:22] listen now now his bride will fulfill
[46:25] everything that's in the New Testament
[46:29] another Masterpiece in the making amen
[46:33] praise the Lord so the pattern repeat
[46:36] heal amen Christ he he he came to
[46:39] fulfill the the Old Testament amen the
[46:43] Masterpiece but again we are living in
[46:46] the time of the second coming amen
[46:48] praise the Lord and the prophet tells us
[46:51] that now the bride will fulfill
[46:53] everything that's in the New Testament
[46:56] amen praise the
[46:58] Lord amen how how will she do it amen
[47:03] how by being a a a strong independent
[47:06] woman like leysia is today amen that the
[47:11] image of a a strong independent woman is
[47:14] being glorified today amen that's the
[47:17] ideal for a woman you know uh but she's
[47:21] not that way the Bride of the of the
[47:23] last age though he has a she has a great
[47:26] ministry though she has the word that
[47:29] speaks volumes of her amen how does she
[47:32] do it not as as a dominant woman amen
[47:36] but a woman that has a Meek and gentle
[47:39] spirit amen that's how God likes it amen
[47:44] she understands the word that's been
[47:46] spoken of her but it doesn't make her
[47:49] proud it doesn't make her independent
[47:52] from her bridegroom amen because we have
[47:55] that balance amen amen the same balance
[47:58] that Paul had in the very beginning
[48:00] where he would tell us all sorts of
[48:02] things that we are partakers of his
[48:04] divine nature and tell us that we are
[48:07] the Fulfillment of scripture and then he
[48:09] would tell us but remember Saints our
[48:12] ability our sufficiency is from Christ
[48:16] amen so if you're married Amen in the
[48:19] natural or in the spiritual you need to
[48:22] recognize that your sufficiency comes
[48:25] from your husband amen your ability if
[48:28] not for him if not for his presence we
[48:31] would be nobody amen we would try our
[48:34] best we would maybe read the scriptures
[48:37] in a carnal way and become an arrogant a
[48:40] dominant church amen puffed up people
[48:43] amen reading the message without the
[48:46] Revelation without that relationship
[48:48] with Christ will make you arrogant will
[48:52] make the church rough and dominant and
[48:56] and taking a on itself the the masculine
[48:58] spirit amen but God separated these two
[49:02] Spirits amen they are part of that one
[49:05] Spirit but they have a different work to
[49:08] accomplish amen so if the masculine
[49:11] Spirit accomplished the work for the Old
[49:13] Testament now the prophet tells us that
[49:16] the feminine amen is supposed to fulfill
[49:20] the the the things that were spoken in
[49:22] the New Testament praise the Lord and
[49:26] God's power to trans transformed 1965
[49:28] brother Brown tells us now it's hard to
[49:32] say this it's very hard he says because
[49:35] I'm speaking to people who feel the same
[49:37] way I do and the way I have been for
[49:41] many years amen so that is a tra a a
[49:44] thing of tradition amen a a thing that's
[49:46] been taught to the church for years and
[49:49] that's how we all feel amen we we all
[49:52] feel as you know more or less uh like uh
[49:55] the mainstream of Christian Christianity
[49:57] amen but BR Bram goes on and he says
[49:59] it's very hard because I'm speaking to
[50:02] people who feel the same way I do and
[50:04] the way I have been for many years but
[50:08] since the opening of those Seven Seals
[50:11] of them Angels just behind the mountain
[50:14] Yonder this has become a new book amen
[50:19] so he had his feelings he he he knew
[50:22] that he he saw the book in a different
[50:25] way from a different perspec itive four
[50:27] years and he says it's hard it's
[50:29] difficult because now you see everything
[50:32] in a different light amen but he tells
[50:35] us that it was the opening of those
[50:39] seals that made this book become a new
[50:42] book is the things that's been HD is
[50:45] being revealed as God promised in
[50:48] Revelation 10 he would do it and we are
[50:51] the privileged amen people that God has
[50:54] chosen of the earth that do we might see
[50:57] and understand these things amen which
[51:01] is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a
[51:04] person trying to make it up it's the
[51:06] word of God made manifest proven that
[51:09] it's right proven not by science amen
[51:13] but by God praise the Lord science is
[51:15] all right if it proves God then we are
[51:18] glad for it but we do not trust science
[51:21] amen the world outside they say trust
[51:24] the science amen you know dur dur during
[51:27] the times that we've experienced in
[51:29] recent years they stressed out trust the
[51:32] science we tell you what to do trust the
[51:35] science that's right and they thought we
[51:38] are science whatever we tell you we are
[51:40] science trust us amen but there is
[51:43] something more than just science there
[51:45] is science that proves God Amen because
[51:48] he is the one who who developed of the
[51:51] laws the law of gravity the the laws
[51:53] that guide the universe that guide our
[51:55] natural
[51:57] uh human existence here on Earth amen
[51:59] but there is something more than that
[52:01] amen that's the word of the
[52:05] Lord God as I have said before in the
[52:07] message God doesn't need anyone to
[52:09] interpret his word he is his own
[52:12] interpreter he says it will happen and
[52:15] it happens he confirms it and that
[52:19] interprets it praise the Lord you know
[52:23] so brother Bram he puts a thick dividing
[52:27] line between the times where the seals
[52:30] were not open amen and the times where
[52:33] the seals became open to him amen that
[52:36] was a a thick dividing line as how he
[52:40] looked at the book as as at how he
[52:43] looked at the word of God Amen it is a a
[52:46] a separating line it is a dividing line
[52:50] it is a line that will that will just uh
[52:54] uh distinguish you from any other amen
[52:57] if you understand what God did in our
[52:59] day and age amen you are you've crossed
[53:02] the line amen you are on the other side
[53:05] you may look at the others you may
[53:07] sympathize with them amen but on the
[53:09] other hand they are not able to
[53:12] understand you amen because they haven't
[53:14] crossed the line because they are in in
[53:16] the old thought pattern in the old way
[53:19] of looking at the word amen praise the
[53:22] Lord so the opening of the seals the
[53:25] opening of the word and you know what uh
[53:28] the opening of the word is not a matter
[53:30] of argumentation right amen it is not
[53:33] not up for debate praise the Lord amen
[53:36] because we we can we can look at the
[53:38] word we can look at the message we can
[53:40] have all sorts of quotes amen we can
[53:43] pull out quotes that say that the the
[53:46] the the seals are not open yet amen that
[53:49] the that the book is closed amen we can
[53:51] have all sorts of quotes and then we can
[53:54] pull out quotes that say that the the
[53:56] word is open the the seals are loosed
[53:59] amen but it's not a matter of
[54:01] argumentation amen it's not that
[54:04] somebody has 500 quotes that say that
[54:06] the seals are not open and somebody has
[54:10] 5001 amen and that's how we win
[54:12] arguments amen it God's word is
[54:15] something more than than debate than
[54:17] argument praise the Lord it is not a
[54:20] matter of Doctrine that's right amen the
[54:23] seals the word for theour that's
[54:26] something more than Doctrine praise the
[54:28] Lord I'm so glad for it amen it's not
[54:31] about Doctrine Hebrews 810 and 11 maybe
[54:35] we'll we'll just quickly turn to
[54:38] it
[54:39] amen Hebrews 810 and 11 tells us for
[54:45] this is the Covenant that I will make
[54:47] with the house of Israel after those
[54:49] days says the Lord I will put my laws
[54:52] into their mind and write them in their
[54:54] hearts and I will be to them a God and
[54:58] they shall be to me a people and they
[55:01] shall not teach every man man his
[55:03] neighbor and every man his brother
[55:05] saying know the Lord For All Shall know
[55:08] me from the least to the greatest amen
[55:12] praise the Lord so there is a a a time
[55:16] where the law is not only written
[55:19] somewhere but is put in the mind of a
[55:22] believer that means that it transforms
[55:24] his thinking the way he thinks about the
[55:27] word is different amen and I believe
[55:30] that we are not going to fight over
[55:32] Doctrine on the other side amen so and I
[55:36] believe that maybe we should quit
[55:38] fighting about Doctrine on this side as
[55:40] well amen because that's just not
[55:43] productive amen you you you cannot force
[55:46] anybody to believe something you cannot
[55:49] convince somebody to believe the opening
[55:51] of the word amen we are not here to to
[55:54] to just have proales Amen to proelite to
[55:58] them to the church to ask them in and
[56:00] just talk nicely and convince them that
[56:03] the opening of the word is Right amen
[56:06] praise the lord we are not followers of
[56:08] a Doctrine that's right amen we are not
[56:10] followers of a certain Movement we are
[56:13] not followers of a certain Camp praise
[56:15] the Lord amen you know Doctrine is very
[56:18] important and brother Brown tells us
[56:20] that the doctrine is the wall around it
[56:22] is the fence it is something that
[56:24] protects the church amen that's the
[56:27] doctrine amen but I believe that the
[56:29] doctrine is here H it is like a map a
[56:32] road map here on this side of glory amen
[56:35] that will just give you a detailed look
[56:38] upon things amen it will let you go from
[56:42] here to glory in the in the shortest
[56:45] shortest ways possible amen it it won't
[56:48] let you go on a detour here a and to go
[56:51] to a dead end and then you'll have to
[56:53] reverse and lose time and so on if
[56:55] you're Doctrine is Right amen and I
[56:58] believe that the doctrine that the
[57:00] prophet of of the Lord restored amen
[57:03] that's the right way to follow amen
[57:06] praise the Lord but but Doctrine these
[57:09] are not laws written in the book that's
[57:11] not a law that's not regulation amen
[57:15] that's not something written down the
[57:18] that that we look at you know for
[57:21] guidance we need to be guided by the
[57:23] spirit of the Lord amen praise the Lord
[57:27] amen so the word is not just debates
[57:30] over terminology amen the word is
[57:33] something more than just a dictionary
[57:35] amen because a dictionary will give you
[57:38] the the the exact definition of a word
[57:41] amen and that's what people are good at
[57:44] today they they they know everything
[57:46] about every subject they they hear the
[57:49] seventh seal they'll give you a
[57:50] definition of what the seventh seal is
[57:53] amen they they hear about the Thunders
[57:55] they will give you a definition amen but
[57:57] the word of God is something more than
[57:59] just a definition amen it is something
[58:02] more than just a letter amen it's
[58:05] something more than just a reference
[58:07] book that you can go into and and pull
[58:10] out of a COR condence or or a table or
[58:13] something like that it's more than that
[58:15] we use all of these things amen but we
[58:18] do not trust these things we trust the
[58:21] spirit of the Lord amen to show us in
[58:23] the right direction amen so so that's
[58:26] why you know it's it's something more
[58:29] than just Doctrine amen because on the
[58:31] other side I don't believe that we'll
[58:33] fight over Doctrine amen when we are
[58:37] there we we see the reality we are in
[58:40] that reality amen the doctrine will be
[58:43] redundant we'll see face to face amen we
[58:46] can touch we can talk amen we can have
[58:48] full relationship amen praise the Lord
[58:52] because that's how marriage works you
[58:54] know before you are married you can read
[58:56] about marriage amen you can talk about
[58:59] marriage you can you can ask this
[59:01] brother or that brother and you'll get
[59:02] all sorts of responses amen all sorts of
[59:05] Lookouts upon marriage
[59:07] amen amen but then when you are married
[59:12] amen it's not like when there is you
[59:14] know there is an issue coming up or you
[59:16] need to talk to your wife you go back to
[59:18] your reference book you you Google what
[59:20] to say you ask chat GPT what to say next
[59:24] amen how to respond to my wife in a
[59:26] loving way but in in in a way that will
[59:30] show that I also have needs I also want
[59:33] this not to be too dominant but and not
[59:36] to be too polite how to do it amen but
[59:39] then if you're in a relationship amen
[59:41] you grow in it you learn you learn how
[59:44] to fix stuff amen you you you you know
[59:47] the other the your spouse you know the
[59:50] partner amen praise the Lord amen so I'm
[59:54] so thankful that the word is something
[59:56] something more than just a book amen
[59:58] more than a physical book more than a a
[1:00:00] reference point more more than a
[1:00:02] dictionary amen because otherwise it is
[1:00:06] just dead letter amen and that's how
[1:00:09] people die today they have they know the
[1:00:11] text of the message they know the the
[1:00:14] text of the Bible and they are dead as
[1:00:16] that can be amen but what we need to
[1:00:19] know is the context amen something more
[1:00:23] than text text is very shallow it is it
[1:00:26] is it seems plain amen it's it's black
[1:00:30] black letters on white paper it seems
[1:00:32] plain and it couldn't be pler amen but
[1:00:35] if you don't know the context you know
[1:00:37] nothing at all amen if you don't have
[1:00:40] the relationship amen that guides you
[1:00:42] the depth of the word that is there to
[1:00:45] strengthen you to give you the anchor
[1:00:47] that you need text will be very very
[1:00:52] difficult for you amen it will get you
[1:00:54] in all sorts of troubles
[1:00:56] if you don't know the context amen it
[1:00:58] will be just another religion amen but
[1:01:02] the bride has the mind of Christ she has
[1:01:04] the context for the text that she hears
[1:01:07] amen when you hear the word there is a
[1:01:10] certain context amen there is something
[1:01:12] underlying that text amen there is there
[1:01:16] is a reference point but not a reference
[1:01:18] point in a book but the reference point
[1:01:21] in the back part of God's mind praise
[1:01:23] the Lord amen so everything everything
[1:01:26] changes when you see Christ there is a
[1:01:28] thick dividing line from the from the
[1:01:31] way you used to look at things and and
[1:01:34] now the things that that you see now
[1:01:36] amen praise the
[1:01:39] Lord and everything changes when the
[1:01:41] word tells you who you are amen and
[1:01:45] Christ is the the anointed word for the
[1:01:49] day amen he's been anointed especially
[1:01:52] for this day amen but I'm so thankful
[1:01:55] that not only the word not only what was
[1:01:58] spoken what was preached was anointed
[1:01:59] amen but there are people under the same
[1:02:02] anointing amen so there is a match in
[1:02:05] anointing amen praise the Lord so the
[1:02:08] anointing can flow not only not only on
[1:02:11] the head not it doesn't only stop on the
[1:02:13] head but it covers the entire body it
[1:02:15] runs runs down down the beard of the
[1:02:18] high priest and all over His Garment
[1:02:20] everything is Anointed with the same
[1:02:22] anointing oil amen and you know Paul
[1:02:26] tells us and and quoting the Old
[1:02:28] Testament I believe in Psalms he said
[1:02:31] then said I lo I come in the volume of
[1:02:35] the book it is written of me to do thy
[1:02:38] will oh God Amen praise the Lord that is
[1:02:42] so profound amen that is so profound
[1:02:45] that it was used in the Old Testament
[1:02:47] amen and then it was used in the New
[1:02:50] Testament amen by Paul he quoted the Old
[1:02:53] Testament we know Christ came to fulfill
[1:02:55] the Old Testament amen so this scripture
[1:02:58] pertained to
[1:02:59] Christ lo I come because in the volumes
[1:03:03] of the book it is written of me to do
[1:03:05] thy will oh God but then comes Paul and
[1:03:09] he repeats the same thing in the New
[1:03:11] Testament pointing that there is
[1:03:13] somebody who needs to fulfill that new
[1:03:16] testament amen you have to fulfill that
[1:03:19] word in the scripture amen that you need
[1:03:23] to come because you recognize that in
[1:03:26] the volume of the book it is written of
[1:03:29] me and you come to do what to do thy
[1:03:32] will oh God Amen praise the Lord amen
[1:03:37] and yeah like we've uh read in the
[1:03:41] Masterpiece Christ come in the Old
[1:03:44] Testament the Masterpiece to fulfill
[1:03:47] that now his bride will fulfill
[1:03:50] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:03:52] another Masterpiece in the making right
[1:03:56] amen praise the Lord
[1:04:00] amen you know so there is a great uh
[1:04:05] division between being an observer and
[1:04:07] being a participant a partaker amen you
[1:04:11] know it's it's not about Doctrine it's
[1:04:14] it's it's something more it's about you
[1:04:17] amen about you being a partaker amen you
[1:04:21] know you can observe Doctrine you can
[1:04:23] learn about Doctrine you can study
[1:04:25] Doctrine am amen but to be a partaker
[1:04:27] that that means that's something uh
[1:04:30] something personal praise the
[1:04:33] Lord amen 1 Peter 51 tells
[1:04:39] us amen I'll just give you a chance to
[1:04:43] turn to it amen
[1:04:55] first Peter
[1:04:57] 51 the elders which are among you I
[1:05:00] exhort who am also an elder and a
[1:05:03] witness of the sufferings of Christ and
[1:05:06] also a a partaker of the glory that
[1:05:10] shall be revealed amen Peter says I am a
[1:05:14] partaker amen not only in the sufferings
[1:05:18] amen but there there there there is
[1:05:21] something that continues from the
[1:05:22] sufferings to the Glorious part amen I I
[1:05:25] am a partaker of the glory that shall be
[1:05:28] revealed praise the Lord you know
[1:05:30] brother Branham at the time of the of
[1:05:33] the opening of the seals when we know
[1:05:36] that he was in the sunset on Sunset
[1:05:38] mountain and you know there were these
[1:05:42] angels there was this Supernatural Cloud
[1:05:44] there were these angels that came down
[1:05:46] and told him to go to Jeffersonville and
[1:05:49] open the seals amen we know that it
[1:05:51] wasn't brother Bram opening those seals
[1:05:53] amen we know that it was the lamb taking
[1:05:56] the seals off of the book amen but you
[1:06:00] know the it goes alongside amen it is
[1:06:03] not BR Bram was here the lamb was there
[1:06:06] it was the lamb in the person of BR
[1:06:08] branam the lamb who was veiled behind
[1:06:11] human skin amen RI ripping those seals
[1:06:15] off of the book amen that's why brother
[1:06:17] Bram he was not he saw that glorious
[1:06:20] thing he described it but he was not
[1:06:22] just an observer at sunset Mountain amen
[1:06:26] baham tells us that he was caught up in
[1:06:28] that constellation of the seventh Angels
[1:06:31] amen so he was a partaker amen of what
[1:06:34] was going on in our day and age amen
[1:06:38] that's why he could preach the seals
[1:06:40] that's why he could open them amen that
[1:06:42] was the lamb taking off the seals from
[1:06:45] the book amen bra Braham could not have
[1:06:48] done it if if he was just an
[1:06:51] observer he had to be a partaker in that
[1:06:54] amen praise the Lord so like Jesus was
[1:06:58] lifted up Amen in the Old Testament he
[1:07:01] was lifted up and he said that when I am
[1:07:04] lifted up I will draw you nigh unto
[1:07:06] myself amen the prophet of this hour
[1:07:10] Amen in the ministry of that son of man
[1:07:12] amen who was he he was veiled behind
[1:07:15] human skin he was caught up in the
[1:07:17] constellation of the Seven Angels amen
[1:07:20] that's why we can be drawn to the same
[1:07:23] Cloud we can enter into the same hatch
[1:07:26] the same revelation of Christ amen we
[1:07:29] can also become partakers of his
[1:07:31] glorious mystery amen partakers of his
[1:07:35] divine nature not just observers amen
[1:07:39] there are a lot of observers here on
[1:07:40] this Earth amen but they are going to
[1:07:44] stay here that's right because there is
[1:07:46] nothing that will catch them up amen but
[1:07:49] once you've been caught up to that
[1:07:50] Revelation once you've seen yourself
[1:07:53] reflected in that cloud amen your
[1:07:56] representation that came from Heaven it
[1:07:58] matches your being your inner being amen
[1:08:02] praise the Lord then you can be a
[1:08:04] partaker in the catching away amen
[1:08:07] praise the
[1:08:09] Lord amen you know because he was a
[1:08:13] participant he's he he could say that's
[1:08:15] a totally new book to me amen I used to
[1:08:18] be an observer of the book and I liked
[1:08:21] it BR Brown said but now it's something
[1:08:24] totally different now I recognize that I
[1:08:26] am a a partaker and I've always been a
[1:08:29] partaker of the book Amen in the volumes
[1:08:32] of the book it Is Spoken of me amen and
[1:08:35] I recognize it and therefore I come to
[1:08:37] do thy will oh God Amen praise the Lord
[1:08:41] once brother Bram saw it the opening of
[1:08:43] the word he couldn't unsee it he
[1:08:45] couldn't return back to to the previous
[1:08:48] ages to the previous reformer messages
[1:08:51] amen he recognized that it is a time of
[1:08:54] restoration
[1:08:56] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord in
[1:09:00] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:09:02] brother Bram tells us look Christ in you
[1:09:05] makes him the center of life of the
[1:09:07] Revelation that's a very known uh quote
[1:09:09] but I'll read it anyhow Christ's life in
[1:09:12] you makes him the center of the
[1:09:14] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:09:17] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:09:21] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:09:24] revelation of the whole thing amen amen
[1:09:28] see what God is trying to do the prophet
[1:09:30] says amen you need to see what God is
[1:09:33] trying to do amen it's not only Christ
[1:09:36] who's the center of Revelation but
[1:09:38] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:09:40] revelation of the whole thing amen bream
[1:09:45] tells us that God without you is
[1:09:47] incomplete amen you know before the
[1:09:50] foundation of the world when uh we we
[1:09:54] could see that that glorious arrangement
[1:09:56] of Heaven everybody was worshiping
[1:09:58] everybody was praising the the Lord God
[1:10:01] he was Elohim he was the all sufficient
[1:10:04] one amen so he could sustain himself
[1:10:08] without any help from anybody else amen
[1:10:11] he didn't need anybody amen and that's
[1:10:14] how you know forgive me for the types
[1:10:16] sometimes that's how we feel as
[1:10:18] Bachelors you know we are single people
[1:10:20] single young people you know and many
[1:10:23] times we think I'm all sufficient you
[1:10:25] know I'm I'm very young I'm all
[1:10:27] sufficient I don't need anybody why
[1:10:29] would anybody want a wife why would you
[1:10:32] amen but then once you're married amen
[1:10:35] you realize that you've been incomplete
[1:10:37] all along amen there is a part of you
[1:10:40] that just matches you exactly amen amen
[1:10:44] and the same thing was with God he was
[1:10:46] complete amen he felt complete amen the
[1:10:50] Elohim the all-sufficient one the
[1:10:52] self-existing one amen he didn't need
[1:10:54] any body else but then when he started
[1:10:57] to reveal himself in flesh amen bar
[1:11:00] Brown tells us that he is not complete
[1:11:02] without you amen God made it in such a
[1:11:06] way that he is not complete without you
[1:11:09] he needs you to be complete amen praise
[1:11:13] the lord we should be happy about it
[1:11:16] amen that he needs you to be
[1:11:19] complete amen amen what a thought amen
[1:11:24] praise the Lord
[1:11:25] that means that for sure you're not just
[1:11:28] an observer you need to be a participant
[1:11:31] you need to be a part you are the
[1:11:33] missing part of God yeah amen amen but
[1:11:37] you are not missing any anymore amen
[1:11:40] you've been found by the end time
[1:11:42] message amen the message called you out
[1:11:44] and you've responded there was a deep
[1:11:47] that called that used to call for ages
[1:11:50] but there was no deep to respond amen
[1:11:53] because that deep that is the missing
[1:11:55] part of God that's the missing part of
[1:11:58] God that he placed inside of you amen
[1:12:00] that's the seed Gene of God that
[1:12:03] responds just to the word just to the
[1:12:06] right kind of frequency
[1:12:08] amen praise the
[1:12:12] Lord then I said lo I come in the volume
[1:12:16] of the book it is written of me to do
[1:12:19] thy will oh God Amen we know in
[1:12:23] Revelations 5 we recognize this
[1:12:25] situation there we see John uh the
[1:12:28] Revelator the type of the Bride you know
[1:12:32] standing there in wonderful conditions
[1:12:35] amen standing in in in Heavenly places
[1:12:38] we would say standing there and seeing
[1:12:41] the everything that transpires amen
[1:12:44] seeing the book in the hand amen seeing
[1:12:47] the seals he saw the seals amen am but
[1:12:52] they were on the book that's right they
[1:12:54] were not loosed amen what we actually
[1:12:57] cherish is is not just the seals but the
[1:13:00] book that's been released because of the
[1:13:02] seals that were taken off amen praise
[1:13:06] the Lord so we see beneath the seals
[1:13:09] amen what's inside there is it's not
[1:13:11] just the the event of the breaking of
[1:13:14] the seals but there is a message that's
[1:13:16] been released to the bride of Christ
[1:13:18] amen so we remember John he didn't have
[1:13:21] he was John the Revelator but he didn't
[1:13:23] have Revelation at this Point amen he
[1:13:26] was standing there and he was weeping
[1:13:29] because he was just an
[1:13:31] observer amen he was looking at the
[1:13:33] entire scene and he knew that nobody was
[1:13:35] worthy amen he didn't know whether he he
[1:13:38] was accepted or he was not accepted
[1:13:40] that's why he wept because he was an
[1:13:43] observer amen but then he heard a voice
[1:13:46] there was an elder that came to him amen
[1:13:49] he heard a voice from from behind him
[1:13:52] amen he he heard that still small voice
[1:13:55] voice that told him amen you are part of
[1:13:58] that plan amen you are a partaker your
[1:14:01] name is in the book and there is
[1:14:03] somebody worthy to take the book amen
[1:14:06] not only to take the book to to to show
[1:14:09] you the seals but to break the seals for
[1:14:11] you amen so there are many people who
[1:14:14] who can accept the seals you know and
[1:14:17] and then and they can preach the seals
[1:14:19] amen but they preach the seals that are
[1:14:22] still on the
[1:14:23] book right but what what we want to
[1:14:25] preach and what we want to hear back is
[1:14:28] what's behind those seals amen we want
[1:14:31] to break the seals Amen in our lives
[1:14:35] amen sir that was personal for John the
[1:14:38] seals were broken personally for John
[1:14:41] amen because that was a personal
[1:14:43] revelation John wasn't weeping because
[1:14:45] of the state of the entire world the the
[1:14:48] the the the entire age he wasn't
[1:14:50] consumed with that he was consumed with
[1:14:52] the fact that I don't know if I'm I'm
[1:14:55] going to make it amen because I'm
[1:14:57] standing here in the presence of the
[1:14:58] Lord I have nothing to show for myself I
[1:15:01] have no merits of my own I have nothing
[1:15:04] you know he had a Ministry behind him
[1:15:06] amen he walked with Jesus Christ amen he
[1:15:09] was sent to to the a of patmas he had
[1:15:12] everything to show for
[1:15:14] him at least that's what we humans
[1:15:17] think that he had a a good resume amen
[1:15:21] his resume he didn't even pull out his
[1:15:23] resume in the presence of the Lord amen
[1:15:26] so whatever you think of yourself
[1:15:28] whether you think you have a bad resume
[1:15:30] or a really good resume amen don't pull
[1:15:32] it out before the Lord amen if you find
[1:15:35] yourself in the presence of the Lord
[1:15:37] amen right that won't even cross your
[1:15:41] mind to go on your own merits amen
[1:15:45] praise the Lord because our own merits
[1:15:47] they they they condemn us amen Braham
[1:15:50] says it's the record that con condemns
[1:15:53] us it's what we've done that condemns us
[1:15:56] and many times we want to bring it as
[1:15:59] evidence amen I'm so glad that we are
[1:16:02] not representing ourselves in court amen
[1:16:05] that we've got somebody who represents
[1:16:07] Us Praise the Lord he's not only the the
[1:16:12] the judge but he's also our Advocate
[1:16:15] amen he represents our case yeah we
[1:16:18] would be really bad at showing our case
[1:16:21] amen we would pull out our records what
[1:16:23] we've done amen and that would actually
[1:16:26] prove that we are
[1:16:28] guilty amen but what happened with John
[1:16:31] he from a state of being an observer
[1:16:34] over everything he became a partaker
[1:16:36] because he saw his name in the book amen
[1:16:40] he saw that I am a partaker of divine
[1:16:43] nature amen because it's not just the
[1:16:46] book of life it's the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:48] Life
[1:16:49] Meaning included in the book are names
[1:16:52] of the people who live the life of the
[1:16:55] lamb amen that's right that do not live
[1:16:58] a a life of their own amen they don't
[1:17:00] come because they can present God a a
[1:17:04] wonderful resume amen they come to God
[1:17:07] because they can they can display the
[1:17:10] resume of the Lamb amen they can say I
[1:17:13] live the the the life of the Lamb amen
[1:17:16] praise the Lord and when he saw himself
[1:17:18] in the book amen praise the Lord once he
[1:17:23] saw his name in the book he couldn't
[1:17:25] unsee it amen he couldn't look at the
[1:17:28] book differently he he he couldn't look
[1:17:31] at the seals in a different way because
[1:17:34] not only did he see the the the seals
[1:17:37] being broken of the book but he saw his
[1:17:39] name in the
[1:17:40] book amen praise the Lord so it was the
[1:17:44] word that changed the position of John
[1:17:47] from a mere Observer to a participant
[1:17:50] praise the Lord amen hallelujah he
[1:17:54] looked in in the volumes of the book
[1:17:56] yeah amen and he saw himself right
[1:17:59] that's why he could come and do the will
[1:18:02] of God Amen praise the Lord it had to
[1:18:06] become a new book Amen to John so what
[1:18:10] we've
[1:18:11] read uh what we've read actually I
[1:18:14] didn't give you the title I'm sorry pick
[1:18:16] up your pen and write amen that's the
[1:18:19] title for for today if we get to that
[1:18:22] amen
[1:18:25] amen I'm not a long-winded preacher at
[1:18:28] least that's what I want to think of
[1:18:29] myself
[1:18:31] amen uh but BR Brown tells us in the
[1:18:34] unveiling of God he says as it is
[1:18:37] written see ye are written Epistles the
[1:18:41] Bible said now what is epistle it is a
[1:18:45] written word and you are the written
[1:18:48] other words you are read like this you
[1:18:51] could read it like this you are written
[1:18:54] epistle you are the word says that has
[1:18:57] been written and made manifest right
[1:19:01] nothing can be added to
[1:19:04] it let it sink in amen nothing can be
[1:19:08] added to the epistle the written
[1:19:11] epistle you can't say I'm a written
[1:19:14] epistle and living some other kind of a
[1:19:16] something but what this has already
[1:19:19] wrote right amen so you can live what's
[1:19:23] been written about you amen you are a
[1:19:25] written epistle because nothing can be
[1:19:27] added or taken away amen oh wow that's
[1:19:31] deep amen ye are written Epistles and
[1:19:35] nothing can be added or subtracted from
[1:19:37] that written epistle amen praise the
[1:19:40] Lord you know in the beginning there was
[1:19:42] the word and it was with God and God was
[1:19:46] that word amen and then it became flesh
[1:19:48] and dwelt amongst us amen that's that's
[1:19:51] John John chapter 1 the the first few
[1:19:53] verses but I believe that's also our
[1:19:55] scripture amen that in the beginning
[1:19:58] there was the word amen that in the very
[1:20:01] beginning there was the word and we were
[1:20:02] part of that word amen we are the word
[1:20:06] that was written and manifested amen
[1:20:08] it's being manifested right now
[1:20:11] Hallelujah you cannot add or subtract
[1:20:13] anything from your
[1:20:15] life from the life of the Lamb amen if
[1:20:18] you are part of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:21] there is nothing to add to the life of
[1:20:23] the Lamb or SE ract from the life of the
[1:20:26] Lamb amen praise the Lord there is
[1:20:29] nothing to to change there is nothing to
[1:20:32] to improve upon amen that's the life of
[1:20:34] the lamb praise the Lord and we've been
[1:20:37] we've been made written Epistles
[1:20:39] hallelujah praise the Lord and that's
[1:20:42] the good pleasure of his will that's
[1:20:44] that's that's how God wanted it amen and
[1:20:47] it it brings joy to God when he sees
[1:20:50] that you accept his plan amen praise the
[1:20:53] Lord that's the secret of his will and
[1:20:56] we've read it in the very beginning
[1:20:58] having made known to us the mystery of
[1:21:00] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:21:04] which he hath purposed in himself that
[1:21:07] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:21:09] times amen this our time he might gather
[1:21:13] together in one all things in Christ
[1:21:16] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:21:18] on earth even in him in whom also we
[1:21:21] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:21:24] destinated according to the purpose of
[1:21:26] him who worketh all things after the
[1:21:29] counsel of his own will that we should
[1:21:33] be to the praise of his glory who first
[1:21:36] trusted in Christ
[1:21:39] amen and another quote from the
[1:21:41] unveiling of God baram says he relates a
[1:21:45] story he says now someone has been many
[1:21:49] has been saying to me and theologians
[1:21:51] said BR branam if the Lord God said with
[1:21:55] your experience that the Lord has given
[1:21:57] you for his people humbly saying this
[1:22:01] said you would be eligible to write a
[1:22:05] Bible yourself your word if God has
[1:22:08] manifested I said that might be true see
[1:22:12] he was trying to catch me see I said but
[1:22:14] you see I couldn't do that he said why
[1:22:18] couldn't you you have all the
[1:22:20] qualifications amen wow what a statement
[1:22:23] he wasn't like that wasn't just
[1:22:25] opposition that came to brother Braham
[1:22:27] that was a the Theologian but he he
[1:22:30] would Elevate the ministry of brother
[1:22:31] Brown he would Elevate his position amen
[1:22:34] right but the prophet knew where he
[1:22:36] stood amen I said but you look one word
[1:22:40] cannot be added or taken away see and he
[1:22:43] said well then then seven tunders you
[1:22:45] see amen that was a theologian he he was
[1:22:48] up to date amen he knew the lingo he
[1:22:50] knew everything amen he just didn't have
[1:22:53] the revelation
[1:22:55] amen but he was talking to somebody that
[1:22:57] had
[1:22:59] amen wouldn't them seven Thunders
[1:23:02] blasting out won't that be a revelation
[1:23:04] to give to some man I said no sir it
[1:23:08] would be adding something to it or
[1:23:10] taking something from it it's all
[1:23:13] revealed in there and the Seven Seals
[1:23:15] opened up the revelation of what that
[1:23:17] was that's what it was see see it's
[1:23:20] still in the word you see you can't get
[1:23:23] out of that word it won't leave the word
[1:23:26] and God's spirit will never leave that
[1:23:28] word it'll stay right with the word
[1:23:31] blinding some and Open the Eyes of
[1:23:34] others it'll always do that amen and now
[1:23:38] that's that's paragraph 280 that's the
[1:23:40] very next paragraph BR Bram says after
[1:23:43] the the encounter with the Theologian
[1:23:45] that proposed BR Brown to write another
[1:23:47] word to add something add to the
[1:23:49] Revelation because he he he had that
[1:23:52] revelation of bar Bram it seems in high
[1:23:54] esteem he would regard it as something
[1:23:56] great something that would be the
[1:23:58] extension the continuation of the word
[1:24:00] but then brother R says that would be
[1:24:02] off the word and but then he adds ye are
[1:24:05] written Epistles read of all men I
[1:24:08] translate that turn around this away see
[1:24:11] just turn it around your epistle that
[1:24:13] has been written cuz you can't add
[1:24:16] nothing to it that's read of all men
[1:24:20] manifested God word word of God in other
[1:24:23] words a amen so brother Bram had the
[1:24:27] right kind of perspective amen with the
[1:24:29] amount of Revelation with everything
[1:24:31] that happened in his ministry and and
[1:24:34] the seals and the Thunders amen he
[1:24:36] wouldn't add nothing to the book amen
[1:24:40] because he knew that everything that God
[1:24:43] wanted to tell us is included in the
[1:24:45] book amen it is included in the written
[1:24:48] Epistles amen you are written Epistles
[1:24:51] amen everything that God wanted to tell
[1:24:54] us he included in his Epistles written
[1:24:57] Epistles read of all men amen they are
[1:25:00] written they're they are not being
[1:25:02] written amen they are written already
[1:25:04] praise the Lord amen so there is nothing
[1:25:07] that you can add to it or subtract from
[1:25:10] it amen amen praise the Lord
[1:25:15] hallelujah you know that was a nice idea
[1:25:19] you know if somebody comes and he
[1:25:21] appreciates the ministry and everything
[1:25:22] and he wants to lift you up but but you
[1:25:24] know you need to know where you stand
[1:25:26] amen it is not a further Revelation
[1:25:29] that's off the book that's that's a part
[1:25:31] two of the book amen it is within the
[1:25:34] book amen and you are not just a a a a
[1:25:38] good quote that's right amen you're not
[1:25:41] just a good leaflet amen a good summary
[1:25:45] something short a onepage review of the
[1:25:47] word amen you are the word amen amen you
[1:25:51] are that book you you don't have to add
[1:25:53] anything you don't have to subtract
[1:25:55] anything from it amen it's just a
[1:25:58] perfect word amen you're not an addition
[1:26:01] to the book you're not an addition to
[1:26:03] the word you are the word amen amen but
[1:26:06] then on the other hand you know we as
[1:26:09] people we we like to be humble amen
[1:26:11] because the religion told us to be
[1:26:13] humble amen if you want to be a
[1:26:14] Christian if you want to be a servant of
[1:26:17] God if you want to be a child of God you
[1:26:19] need to be humble amen and and and what
[1:26:21] people do being humble they disagree
[1:26:25] with the word amen they say okay that's
[1:26:28] a wonderful quote but yet let's balance
[1:26:30] it out let's say you know I'm so sinful
[1:26:33] and I do mistakes and so on Amen but the
[1:26:36] word expects you to be humble and accept
[1:26:39] the word of God that's how you are
[1:26:41] humble amen praise the Lord that's how
[1:26:44] Mary was humble amen she said amen to
[1:26:47] the word of the Angel amen she didn't
[1:26:49] reason with it amen praise the Lord you
[1:26:52] know Zachariah in
[1:26:54] when when the angel came to him you know
[1:26:57] he reasoned with the word maybe he tried
[1:26:59] because he was religious right he was
[1:27:01] brought up in the religion of the day he
[1:27:02] tried to be humble he tried to you know
[1:27:04] he he didn't say well yeah thank you
[1:27:07] let's do it he wanted to he wanted to be
[1:27:10] polite to the angel and he wanted to
[1:27:12] strike a conversation with the angel and
[1:27:14] give a a a sense of humility that you
[1:27:17] know I'm not worthy but if you explain
[1:27:19] it to me maybe maybe you'll convince me
[1:27:21] that it's that way amen the angel didn't
[1:27:24] play games with him amen he expected
[1:27:27] humility but not the the human kind of
[1:27:30] humility that's right amen today your
[1:27:33] human and my human humility won't stand
[1:27:36] before the Lord that's not a good thing
[1:27:39] on your resume amen if you want anything
[1:27:41] on your resume it should be the humility
[1:27:44] of the Lord that's right which would be
[1:27:46] when you hear the word that has been
[1:27:48] spoken you say Amen Lord amen you do not
[1:27:51] reason you don't fall back on your
[1:27:53] experience you do not fall back on on
[1:27:56] what you've read because there are so
[1:27:57] many good quotes there there are so many
[1:27:59] good scriptures and you know your your
[1:28:02] religious mind your carnal mind will try
[1:28:04] to form a nice response that's right yes
[1:28:08] but on the other hand you know and all
[1:28:10] these filler words amen God doesn't use
[1:28:13] filler words amen he's sure of his word
[1:28:16] amen if he said says it's like that it's
[1:28:19] like that he doesn't have to make it
[1:28:22] nice and polite and then anything why
[1:28:25] because he is not hunting for people
[1:28:27] that are religious that like this sort
[1:28:29] of language you know that like being
[1:28:32] convinced to the truth amen and and that
[1:28:35] somebody would talk them into it amen
[1:28:38] the word comes for its own that's right
[1:28:41] meaning that when he comes and speaks
[1:28:43] the word amen he is sure and he is
[1:28:46] positive that there is a response based
[1:28:48] on the word amen not some religious
[1:28:51] response not not a a a big thank you
[1:28:54] letter to the word of the Lord but
[1:28:55] saying amen that's
[1:28:57] enough praise the Lord amen so being
[1:29:00] humble is accepting the will of the Lord
[1:29:03] for your life that's right amen the word
[1:29:05] of the Lord praise the Lord being humble
[1:29:08] is being subject right
[1:29:11] amen when Mary said yes to the word of
[1:29:14] the Lord it wasn't boastful it wasn't
[1:29:17] well I was expecting that no she didn't
[1:29:20] expect it but when the angel came and
[1:29:23] and spoke to her something said yes in
[1:29:26] her heart and she just she she didn't
[1:29:29] have reservations to speak it out amen
[1:29:31] when there was the word of the Lord when
[1:29:33] there was the encounter that even the
[1:29:35] deacons of bar branam would question a
[1:29:37] little bit or or they were not sure
[1:29:40] about it about the squirrels being uh
[1:29:42] being created they're in the house of
[1:29:44] sister hatti amen they had reservations
[1:29:48] because they they've been brought up
[1:29:49] maybe religiously as all of us have been
[1:29:53] or most of us have been amen when many
[1:29:55] times we come to church we are just you
[1:29:57] know we accept the word we accept the
[1:29:59] message but what we accept is that
[1:30:01] intellectual Faith which is religious
[1:30:03] Faith amen it is a faith that that you
[1:30:06] know that will try to be humble that
[1:30:08] will put up a mask you know of a good
[1:30:11] Christian a good message believer amen
[1:30:14] because we have you know we we we have
[1:30:17] like an image of what a a good message
[1:30:19] believer should look like amen and being
[1:30:22] humble is on the list yeah amen it's in
[1:30:26] top three priorities amen but when the
[1:30:29] word comes don't be too humble and
[1:30:31] reason with the word amen if it strikes
[1:30:35] a cord in your heart if it strikes the
[1:30:37] right kind of frequency amen just let it
[1:30:40] out amen sister heide just let it out
[1:30:43] amen she said amen there's nothing but
[1:30:45] the truth amen she wasn't very Bal she
[1:30:48] she wasn't very a an outspoken woman she
[1:30:51] she didn't give a a huge spe
[1:30:54] and then you know rebuking the deacons
[1:30:56] for not believing that amen she didn't
[1:30:58] do it that was just very very simple
[1:31:01] very subtle very quiet she would say
[1:31:04] there nothing but the truth amen praise
[1:31:07] the Lord so being humble is to be
[1:31:10] subject amen and being subject means to
[1:31:15] be a wife of the Lamb amen you're
[1:31:17] subject to the lamb praise the Lord
[1:31:21] hallelujah you're not reasoning with the
[1:31:23] lamb
[1:31:24] amen you are not dominating the lamb
[1:31:27] you're subject to the lamb praise the
[1:31:30] Lord amen
[1:31:33] so topic for this morning amen pick up
[1:31:36] your pen and write amen and we've been
[1:31:40] dealing with the will of the Lord lo I
[1:31:43] come because I've read of myself I've
[1:31:46] seen myself in the volumes of the book
[1:31:48] that's why I come to do thy will oh God
[1:31:51] Amen and you know and I was looking
[1:31:54] recently at the definition of the will
[1:31:57] you know when there's a a will written
[1:32:00] amen and that really blessed me I I'll
[1:32:02] read you the
[1:32:04] definition or the description of the
[1:32:06] will when it comes to drafting the last
[1:32:09] will there are no concessions when it
[1:32:12] comes to two
[1:32:13] conditions a handwritten will in order
[1:32:16] to be valid must be entirely written in
[1:32:20] handwriting for it is difficult to
[1:32:22] falsify the
[1:32:24] handwriting and the other concession is
[1:32:27] it has to be
[1:32:28] signed if in drawing up such a will for
[1:32:32] example one forgets to sign it or writes
[1:32:34] it down in whole or in part on a
[1:32:37] typewriter or on a computer or signs a
[1:32:40] will written in whole or in part by
[1:32:43] another person's hand it will be
[1:32:45] completely
[1:32:47] invalid and will not have the intended
[1:32:51] effect amen that's the natural will
[1:32:54] amen but I really like the fact that it
[1:32:56] has to be done in handwriting amen not
[1:33:00] partly in handwriting amen entirely in
[1:33:04] handwriting amen it has to be
[1:33:06] handwritten and signed
[1:33:09] amen you know and the writer of the will
[1:33:12] it cannot be just anybody amen it cannot
[1:33:15] be somebody else amen it it has to be
[1:33:18] the E exact same person amen it has to
[1:33:21] be the exact same handwriting the will
[1:33:24] from the beginning to the end amen
[1:33:26] praise the Lord and brother Brown tells
[1:33:29] us in the perian church age he says one
[1:33:32] night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy
[1:33:35] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[1:33:38] write as I grasp the pent toite his
[1:33:42] Spirit gave me a message for the church
[1:33:45] I want to bring it to you it has to do
[1:33:47] with the word and the bride amen praise
[1:33:51] the Lord so the Lord he he he he he he
[1:33:54] came to BR rown and he told me pick up
[1:33:57] your pen and write I need a handwritten
[1:34:01] letter to my bride amen I need to State
[1:34:05] my will for the bride amen pick up your
[1:34:08] pen and write and you know that's that's
[1:34:11] a lengthy letter and I encourage you to
[1:34:13] read it when you get back home but that
[1:34:16] was his will recording the bride amen he
[1:34:19] said that she will reach the headstone
[1:34:22] amen he said that she will be a super
[1:34:25] Church in other words my will for the
[1:34:27] bride is that she be a super race that
[1:34:31] she be so similar that she will be in
[1:34:34] His image that they together the
[1:34:37] bridegroom and the bride they will be
[1:34:38] one amen she will manifest the word of
[1:34:42] the Living God Amen she will love him
[1:34:46] amen that's written down in the will of
[1:34:48] God Amen she will have his potential
[1:34:52] amen and then later on he says also
[1:34:54] paman Church age he says those in the
[1:34:57] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:35:01] them to do otherwise they have thus
[1:35:04] sayith the Lord or keep still amen
[1:35:08] there's an option amen it's not just
[1:35:10] that sayth the lord it's also to keep
[1:35:12] still and be comfortable with that amen
[1:35:15] they know that it has to be God in them
[1:35:17] doing the works amen we've read it
[1:35:20] through Paul our sufficiency our ability
[1:35:23] is from God Amen fulfilling his own word
[1:35:28] he did not complete all his work while
[1:35:30] in his Earthly Ministry so now he works
[1:35:34] in and through the bride amen she knows
[1:35:37] that for it was not yet time for him to
[1:35:40] do certain things that he must now do
[1:35:44] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:35:46] bride that work which is left for this
[1:35:50] specific time amen praise the Lord Lord
[1:35:54] pick up your pen and write amen hand
[1:35:58] write my will hallelujah amen praise the
[1:36:02] Lord the bride she is the new book amen
[1:36:06] she is the living epistle amen she is
[1:36:10] she like like we've read from the
[1:36:12] prophet you cannot add or subtract from
[1:36:14] it amen that is a perfect living epistle
[1:36:18] amen she is the Fulfillment of the will
[1:36:20] of the father amen and it is the
[1:36:24] Father's will amen that's right it's not
[1:36:27] our will that's right that's the
[1:36:29] father's will but it has to be written
[1:36:31] in handwriting there has to be a hand
[1:36:35] amen and brother Ram tells us that God
[1:36:38] in our day and age he doesn't have any
[1:36:40] other hand but yours he doesn't have any
[1:36:43] other feet but yours he doesn't have any
[1:36:45] other eyes or ears or any members of the
[1:36:48] body but yours amen that's why the
[1:36:51] prophet for this age Who was the the
[1:36:53] first fruit amen he was the the example
[1:36:56] for our day he got a voice there was a
[1:37:00] voice that came to him and told him pick
[1:37:02] up your pen and write amen it wasn't it
[1:37:06] it wasn't uh like in the Old Testament
[1:37:08] that God would hand down the tables of
[1:37:10] stone to Moses they were already already
[1:37:13] written but there was a human being now
[1:37:15] on Earth that had to pick up his pen
[1:37:18] amen it wasn't a a Heavenly pen it
[1:37:20] wasn't a Heavenly hand it was an Earthly
[1:37:23] hand an Earthly pen an Earthly piece of
[1:37:26] paper but the will of God Amen praise
[1:37:30] the lord we remember Jesus in The Garden
[1:37:33] of of Gethsemane amen he said not my
[1:37:36] will but yours be done which is very
[1:37:39] profound and I I I I really like it
[1:37:41] because that that just tells us that
[1:37:44] Jesus had his own
[1:37:46] will Jesus had his own idea Jesus had
[1:37:50] his own perspective amen not a carnal
[1:37:54] not a sinful perspective not a carnal
[1:37:57] idea not well I'm going to the world or
[1:38:00] I'm going to do or I'm going to join the
[1:38:02] Pharisees and the Sadducees he was the
[1:38:04] word he knew the word amen he looked in
[1:38:07] the volumes of the book that's why he
[1:38:10] came amen that's why he came and he
[1:38:12] wanted to do the will but you know he he
[1:38:15] he was the scriptures you know he he
[1:38:18] read all of these scriptures and
[1:38:20] maybe I presume that he had another idea
[1:38:23] a of how to achieve the same goal but in
[1:38:26] a different
[1:38:29] way if he didn't have his own will why
[1:38:31] would he say that amen why would he
[1:38:34] struggle what why would he content to
[1:38:36] the point that his perspiration turned
[1:38:38] into blood amen that was the greatest
[1:38:41] battle ever fought amen that it it
[1:38:44] wasn't a physical combat amen he wasn't
[1:38:47] struggling physically but he was
[1:38:49] struggling in his mind amen that was the
[1:38:51] greatest battle ever fought praise the
[1:38:54] Lord amen that speaks of our day and age
[1:38:58] B tells us that the the age that we live
[1:39:01] in we are in the midst of the battle
[1:39:03] that the greatest battle that's ever
[1:39:04] been fought why why because there there
[1:39:08] is this contention amen between our own
[1:39:11] will and the will of the father amen
[1:39:13] like in the Garden of
[1:39:15] Gethsemane uh it was the greatest
[1:39:18] victory that was achieved not on the
[1:39:20] cross of Calvary that was a consequence
[1:39:22] of that victory amen but he had to fight
[1:39:25] himself he had to he had to uh
[1:39:28] acknowledge the will of the father and
[1:39:30] esteem it higher than his own amen and I
[1:39:34] believe that his own will was quite
[1:39:39] good probably as Jesus of Galilee he
[1:39:42] thought that his will would be
[1:39:48] better you know many times we stress so
[1:39:51] much the
[1:39:55] the godhead of of of Jesus and how he
[1:39:58] was God you know he was not only human
[1:40:00] but he was God but for us knowing that
[1:40:03] we also should stress the opposite side
[1:40:06] amen because he he was also he was God
[1:40:09] made flesh amen that was a different
[1:40:11] body than ours amen that's for
[1:40:15] sure but he also learned obedience by
[1:40:17] what he suffered amen amen he was
[1:40:19] growing in Statue yeah amen and favor
[1:40:23] yes amen that's right when it comes to
[1:40:26] man and God Amen so he was growing he he
[1:40:29] was tired and you know and and and and
[1:40:32] then he had his own
[1:40:34] will right
[1:40:38] amen if that was just God you know
[1:40:40] without the the the the the human part
[1:40:44] the fleshly
[1:40:45] part what could we do how could we ever
[1:40:49] achieve anything how could we think of
[1:40:51] ourselves as something more than just
[1:40:53] mere flesh amen but we see our example
[1:40:57] amen we see Jesus Christ who was
[1:40:59] fighting until the point of death
[1:41:02] between his own will and the will of the
[1:41:04] father amen but what made him Victorious
[1:41:07] was that he acknowledged the will of the
[1:41:09] father over his own amen many times we
[1:41:11] come up with a very good idea a very
[1:41:14] very scriptural a very quote-based a
[1:41:17] very message likee answer to our
[1:41:20] problems or answerers to the challenges
[1:41:23] of today amen but then we need to
[1:41:25] recognize that maybe that's just our own
[1:41:28] will amen and we need to lay it as
[1:41:30] sacrifice amen that's the ultimate
[1:41:33] sacrifice something that we've been
[1:41:35] working for something that we've thought
[1:41:38] of that something the best that we've
[1:41:40] we've brought up amen but we need to
[1:41:43] still lay it on the on the base of the
[1:41:45] Altar and just slay it amen and just
[1:41:48] acknowledge and glorify the will of the
[1:41:50] father amen praise the Lord
[1:41:55] Hallelujah so the father couldn't force
[1:41:58] him to do anything that's right amen God
[1:42:01] will not force you to do anything right
[1:42:04] that's very far from how God runs his
[1:42:07] plans
[1:42:08] amen true he put men in the Garden of
[1:42:11] Eden on the basis of free Mor moral
[1:42:13] agency amen he could choose amen God was
[1:42:16] prepared for anything amen but then
[1:42:19] because he knew amen because he fornew
[1:42:23] because he predestinated you he knew
[1:42:25] there was something in you he knew the
[1:42:27] power that he placed on the inside amen
[1:42:31] he knew that there would be a certain
[1:42:33] frequency that when he calls you will
[1:42:35] answer according to the same frequency
[1:42:38] amen praise the Lord and that will give
[1:42:40] you the power to withstand amen that
[1:42:43] will give you the power to sacrifice
[1:42:45] your own achievements your own
[1:42:47] experience your own position your own
[1:42:49] will amen your own Ministry or whatever
[1:42:52] amen bam says whatever Ministry needs to
[1:42:55] be ruined if my Ministry needs to be
[1:42:57] ruined let it be ruined amen if my will
[1:43:01] everything that I've been working for
[1:43:03] needs to be ruined let it be ruined amen
[1:43:06] because it's it's nothing amen comparing
[1:43:09] to the will of the Lord amen to the will
[1:43:11] of the father so Jesus was not forced to
[1:43:14] go to the Cross amen that was his
[1:43:17] decision yeah amen he did it amen he
[1:43:22] took that pen and he wrote on that piece
[1:43:25] of paper amen praise the Lord he wrote
[1:43:29] the will of the father he didn't write
[1:43:31] his own will amen we are not writing our
[1:43:34] own will friends
[1:43:36] amen Lord the word tells us pick up your
[1:43:39] pen and
[1:43:41] write
[1:43:43] Hallelujah but he knows already what
[1:43:45] you're going to write amen that you are
[1:43:48] going to write the will of the father
[1:43:49] for your life amen you're not going to
[1:43:51] write your own will hallelujah praise
[1:43:54] the Lord why because you know that is
[1:43:56] already written of you amen it is
[1:43:58] written in the volumes of the book
[1:44:00] that's why you cannot add you you're not
[1:44:02] writing another another book another
[1:44:05] Bible another section a followup nothing
[1:44:08] else like that but you understand also
[1:44:10] that you are living Epistles written and
[1:44:14] read of all men amen amen nothing can be
[1:44:18] added or taken away isn't that wonderful
[1:44:20] amen because that's not your will if
[1:44:22] that was your will that you would have
[1:44:24] to scribble all over it you would have
[1:44:26] to cross out a sections and write
[1:44:28] different sections and and use all sorts
[1:44:30] of colors and then throw it away then
[1:44:33] write a new one amen but once you re you
[1:44:36] write the will of the father it is final
[1:44:40] amen It's the final word of the Lord but
[1:44:43] many times it is uh is a struggle amen
[1:44:47] it will be a struggle it is a struggle
[1:44:49] for me it will be a struggle for you it
[1:44:50] was a struggle for Jesus Christ in the
[1:44:52] god Garden of Gethsemane it won't be as
[1:44:55] easy you know oh give me a piece of
[1:44:57] paper I'll write it no it takes it it
[1:44:59] took years it took the entire Ministry
[1:45:02] of Jesus Christ here on Earth to be able
[1:45:05] to finally sacrifice his own will
[1:45:09] yeah do you think will be any different
[1:45:12] amen I believe that we are here still
[1:45:14] for a purpose because we we still keep
[1:45:17] writing our own Wills amen good Wills
[1:45:20] message Wills amen logical Wills amen
[1:45:24] everything everything is nice and smooth
[1:45:26] and we've scribbled all over it we've
[1:45:28] come up with the best of the best amen
[1:45:31] we came with our own fruits of our labor
[1:45:33] amen but then we need to sacrifice it at
[1:45:36] the foot of the of the altar amen and
[1:45:38] agree with the will of the father praise
[1:45:41] the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord it
[1:45:44] must be your writing it must be your
[1:45:47] will amen you have to acknowledge amen
[1:45:52] you you need to have the desire God will
[1:45:54] not force you to write anything
[1:45:56] amen praise the
[1:45:59] Lord
[1:46:00] amen you know the reward
[1:46:03] comes the reward came for the prophet to
[1:46:06] the prophet you
[1:46:08] know the the great victory in love
[1:46:11] divine amen the voice said because that
[1:46:15] was your decision yeah it wasn't
[1:46:19] forced because you've chosen this narrow
[1:46:22] path yes and because of your own
[1:46:25] choosing amen there is a tremendous
[1:46:27] Victory awaiting for you amen tremendous
[1:46:30] victory in love Divine Praise the Lord
[1:46:34] amen and that victory that reward is for
[1:46:36] you amen it it was for Jesus Christ amen
[1:46:40] it was for brother brandham when they
[1:46:42] they would sacrifice their own will and
[1:46:45] write the will of the father
[1:46:47] amen there is a reward for you amen if
[1:46:52] you disre guard your own flesh your
[1:46:54] fleshly desires your religious desires
[1:46:57] whatever your desires are whatever your
[1:46:59] will is for your life amen just seek the
[1:47:02] will of the father amen and write it
[1:47:05] down praise the Lord hallelujah let's
[1:47:09] stand to our feet
[1:47:12] amen I'm so
[1:47:14] thankful you know when Esther she became
[1:47:17] Queen amen the king told her write what
[1:47:21] you think is best yes write it down and
[1:47:24] sign it amen that will be my will it
[1:47:27] will be in handwriting it will be signed
[1:47:29] amen these are the two concessions that
[1:47:32] need to happen for the will amen but
[1:47:34] what what he knew that what Esther would
[1:47:37] all right she he didn't tell her write
[1:47:40] this write that sign it this way he had
[1:47:43] the confidence amen because they were
[1:47:46] one amen Esther and the King they were
[1:47:49] one amen amen so that's why whatever she
[1:47:52] wrote
[1:47:53] she knew my sufficiency my ability is
[1:47:57] from the King amen it's not my kingdom
[1:48:02] amen I'm not hijacking the rulership of
[1:48:05] the king I'm not I I'm not uh having a
[1:48:08] spirit of rebellion amen cuz that's how
[1:48:11] people they want Power amen people want
[1:48:14] Power
[1:48:15] today if they get the chance they want
[1:48:17] to write something something new
[1:48:19] something extra something uh that seems
[1:48:22] wonderful
[1:48:24] but we need to sacrifice amen our will
[1:48:28] and choose the father's will praise the
[1:48:30] Lord BR Brown tells us that power
[1:48:32] without character is
[1:48:34] satanic right it is devil like yeah amen
[1:48:39] but you know if you have the character
[1:48:40] of Christ if you have the nature if
[1:48:42] you're partakers with him in his divine
[1:48:45] nature amen and everything is different
[1:48:48] praise the Lord amen then you can escape
[1:48:51] corruption amen amen then your body can
[1:48:54] be changed amen because you are
[1:48:57] partakers of this divine nature H
[1:48:59] Allelujah praise the
[1:49:01] Lord so this morning everybody I believe
[1:49:05] that we are here we have our own will we
[1:49:09] have our own
[1:49:10] idea but you've been given this pen amen
[1:49:15] you have a hand of Faith
[1:49:19] amen so this is the time to override
[1:49:22] your own way will amen and write the
[1:49:25] will of the father amen fulfill the the
[1:49:28] the will of the father for your life for
[1:49:32] this time for this specific time as the
[1:49:34] prophet said praise the Lord let's bow
[1:49:37] our heads for a word of
[1:49:39] prayer Heavenly Father we just love you
[1:49:42] we appreciate you Lord for who you are
[1:49:46] Lord not what you have given us Lord but

[1:49:50] world seeking your hand father seeking
[1:49:54] what you're going to give us or how
[1:49:55] you're going to bless us but we have a
[1:49:58] different kind of relationship with you

[1:50:03] you came down lord you uh you revealed
[1:50:06] your presence to us Lord and we can just
[1:50:09] immerse ourselves in that presence Lord

[1:50:19] time that we live in Lord we thank you

[1:50:24] Bible in the message Lord that point to
[1:50:26] our day and age Lord that tell us who we
[1:50:28] truly are Lord and what you expect of us
[1:50:32] father you don't expect of us more than
[1:50:34] what you have given us Lord and you have
[1:50:36] given us the fullness the fullness of
[1:50:38] the word has been restored Lord may we
[1:50:41] just during this greatest battle that
[1:50:43] has ever been fought may we just seek
[1:50:47] the will of the father may we seek your
[1:50:49] will father may we be in such a
[1:50:51] communication with you father may we
[1:50:54] have such a close relationship with you
[1:50:56] that we know exactly what you want to do
