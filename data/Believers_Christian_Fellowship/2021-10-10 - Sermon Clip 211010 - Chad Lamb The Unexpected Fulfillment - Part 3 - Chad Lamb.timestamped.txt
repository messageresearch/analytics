[0:00] and the angel came in unto her and said
[0:02] hail thou art highly favored the lord is
[0:04] with thee blessed art thou among women
[0:08] listen
[0:09] before this visitation of the angel she
[0:11] did not know she was highly favored and
[0:13] she didn't know she was blessed among
[0:15] women
[0:18] she didn't know who she was
[0:19] i mean like she knew who she was but she
[0:21] didn't know who she was
[0:23] like she knew her birth record and she
[0:25] probably could go back a few generations
[0:26] and she knew the city she lived in and
[0:28] the name they called her and you know
[0:30] the house that she dwelt in she knew who
[0:32] she was but she didn't know who she was
[0:36] it took the visitation of an angel with
[0:38] a message from god to awaken her to who
[0:40] she really was by calling her hey hey
[0:43] you know you're highly favored
[0:47] and you're blessed arthel among women
[0:50] you know
[0:51] the first time she heard that i'm sure
[0:53] she was a little startled and she might
[0:54] have been like
[1:00] you're talking to me
[1:05] brother branham in the first seal he
[1:06] looks at a group of people and he says
[1:08] i'm going to i'm no longer going to call
[1:10] you church but i'm going to call you
[1:12] brides so that you'll understand
[1:15] there was a group of people there and
[1:17] some may have been they'd all rejoice
[1:19] some may have understood some didn't but
[1:21] when i heard the tape something called
[1:23] me bride amen
[1:25] amen and it wasn't the man from kentucky
[1:28] amen it was the voice behind that man
[1:30] that was saying i'm going to call you
[1:31] bride so that you'll understand that
[1:33] this prophecy is for you amen
[1:36] amen had to come to mary so she would
[1:38] know this prophecy is for you and you
[1:40] have to know that you're the bride to
[1:42] know that these prophecies in the end
[1:43] time are for you you have to know who
[1:45] you are amen not not the birth record
[1:48] not going back a few generations not
[1:51] being able to say i live here my address
[1:52] isn't here you can send me mail here my
[1:54] phone number here that's not the true
[1:56] identity but the true identity is coming
[1:58] through the messenger of the age he's
[2:00] here to tell you i'm not going to call
[2:02] you church anymore because we're done
[2:04] with churches
[2:05] this is right now with the preaching of
[2:08] the seals we're finishing the
[2:09] dispensation of churches amen and we're
[2:11] moving into the dispensation of bride
[2:14] so i'm going to call you no longer
[2:17] church but i'm going to call you bride
[2:19] so that you'll understand this prophecy
[2:21] is for you and it's for now
[2:24] [Applause]
[2:26] because if i'm going to continue calling
[2:28] you church like i did through the church
[2:29] ages you'll not understand you'll you'll
[2:32] hear me preaching the seals you'll hear
[2:34] me talking about the lamb taking the
[2:35] book but if we're still in the church
[2:37] ages
[2:40] we're still under church dispensation
[2:43] you won't know you'll still be thinking
[2:45] future future future but i've got to
[2:47] come and give you your true identity so
[2:49] that you know you're the bride
[2:52] this is the time
[2:54] now all these scriptures are culminating
[2:56] today
[2:58] i no longer call you church i will call
[3:00] you bride
