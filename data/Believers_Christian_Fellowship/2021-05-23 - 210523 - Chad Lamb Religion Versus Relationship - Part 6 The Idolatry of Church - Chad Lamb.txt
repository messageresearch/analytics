TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i am thinking of a rapture in my blessed home on high when the redeemed we're gathering in oh i will reign like oh there will be a great procession over on the streets of gold when the readings are gathering oh what music from [Music] like oh you hear that invitation are gathering hallelujah oh give it to me oh this joy that i have the world didn't give it to me this joy that i had oh the world didn't give it to me oh it didn't give it so it can't take it away and this peace that i had the world didn't give it to me oh this peace that i had the world didn't give it to me yes this peace that i had oh the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it so the world can't take it away this long and this love that i had the world didn't give it to me so it can't take it away and it's joy the world did give it to me the world the world didn't give it to me lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy name you deserve the glory [Music] lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy name for you are great you do miracles so great there is no one else like you there is no one else like you you are so great there is praise the lord it's good to know that you serve a great god he said to us jesus said to the disciples he said i am the vine and you are the branches without me you can do nothing when you realize without him you can do nothing and then having a great god becomes more important amen having an all-sufficient one having a mighty god an all-knowing one one who is not ever limited in this power ability becomes everything to us because without him we are nothing amen god is good we sure appreciate him this morning i appreciate the worship amen let's turn to the word let's turn to john chapter 3 as we continue on with the subject of religion versus relationship i believe we're on part six if i have that correct and i'd like to take a subject for a subtitle here the idolatry of church and i just pray that you bear with me don't jump to any conclusions but just bear with me and let me share what's on my heart as we move forward and see what the prophet has to say on these things let's look at john chapter 3 verse 19. john chapter 3 verse 19 and this is condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for this goodness that you've given to us for your mercy and your grace lord that in this day of great deception lord you brought a message lord god you brought your seal of approval and your vindication so that we would know god that this word is you and that you've showed us through your word to the opening of the word all that we have need of in this day god you've given us everything your spirit is here lord to quicken the word in your bride to prevent the cycle of failure that's been in the past for you've determined that this is the day that there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle by the washing of the water of your word god you sent your word you're washing your bride now help us to stay under that flow lord that cleansing flow of your revealed word that's washing all the spots of the prostitute spirits away from us god may we stay here and be cleansed unto your word and may you get glory in us lord and god may your strength lord be sufficient for us may your strength undergird us and guide us and lead us and direct us for we're trusting in you and you alone we ask you bless us now this morning that you would take control and have preeminence over this vessel and speak your eternal word lord may you be glorified and may we be equipped in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seat but i want to read a quote that i've been reading all along out of god hiding himself in simplicity said in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion so we find all the way back in the time in the fall in the garden of eden adam he went to sew fig leaves together because he wanted to make himself a covering and brother bam says this is the nature of man that he's always hiding from god but trying to make himself a way that he can feel justified not necessarily be justified but feel justified and and i said before it doesn't matter how much you feel justified it only matters if you are justified you can feel justified and be wrong but we have to be justified amen and god has given us a way that we can be justified amen and that justification comes by faith and by faith and his word brings the bring us into contact with the atonement and the atonement brings us back into fellowship with god and the message the super sign he says adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he is still trying to do it but god's provided way was an atonement and it'll never work no other way it has to come back to an atonement this is this is so important and so crucial we've been talking about this but i i hope that it doesn't become redundant to you that i'm reviewing some of these things as we move forward but it becomes so important to realize that that everything god everything god did for his children the devil would come along and try to pervert that very thing and bring deception by the very thing god brought so god god brought them a prophet moses he brought them a law he brought them a structure he brought them in order by which they could approach unto him i mean through the tabernacle through the temple and through the the rituals through the feast through all of that and all of these things were to to be a school master to bring them unto christ to teach them about the plan of redemption and the cycle of redemption and atonement and all of these things until it would bring them unto christ but the devil got into the very thing that god provided and he perverted the thing that god provided so that when the so that when god deemed it was time for the school masters completed his work it's time now for christ to come when christ came they rejected the very thing that the word of god was to bring them to because the very mechanism that god put in place to bring them unto christ was the very thing that the devil perverted and used to to prevent them from coming in contact with christ and eventually would be the reason by which they rejected christ and and it would become the the reason why they killed christ so you see the very thing that god used what would use to bring them as a schoolmaster to bring them unto christ is the very thing that the devil used in a perverted way amen to to move them away from christ until when christ would come in the scene in full manifestation that they wouldn't just reject him that they would murder him and so we have to be very very careful that we take the right approach an attitude to the things of god because the devil is not just say like we've been saying the devil is not trying to use the prostitute in the alcoholic amen to trip up the elect he's using religion he's using the very the very place god is working is the very place the antichrist spirit is working and so we've got to be very diligent and be very careful that that man is always wanting a covering in the beginning he tried to make himself a covering so he could feel righteous so he could feel justified that is and so now uh the devil knows the nature of man so what's the devil going to try to do if that's in the nature of man for a man to try to build himself a fig leaf covering a something of his own hands of his own making that he can use as a covering to hide from god amen and to feel justified then all the devil has to do amen is provide amen by reasoning a way for men to have a covering so that he can feel justified and the nature of man will jump on it every time because that's what man wants man is so desperately man so desperately wants to find security a place where he can feel comfortable and fine and everything is all right that's what we're always seeking that's what that's what retirement accounts are for that that's why the institute of social security that's why we help health insurance and that's what what is all of that it's man desperately seeking security he wants to be secure he wants to be safe that's why he builds hurricane proof houses and you know it's the nature of man he wants to secure himself he wants to know that he's safe and that's why nimrod was so successful amen and and joining the world together because man wants to be secure and nimrod was was telling them that the only way to be safe and secure was to come into a unity agreement of purpose and unified purpose amen to build a city and a tower amen the unification of church and state amen the ecclesiastical horn and the civil horn bring it together that they can build themselves a tower that would withstand the judgment of god lest then also unify them lest they be scattered upon the earth and god desired for them to be scattered upon the earth but they nimrod convinced them that being scattered about the earth would make them insecure or unsafe amen so now the devil is playing on the need of man to have security amen so he provides a way for man to feel secure to have his own security to provide for himself a security when there's nothing that you can do yourself to secure yourself there there every security that you have is a false security i just saw a news article the other day that either 5 000 or 50 000 i don't remember the number insurance policies were canceled ahead of a hurricane season people have been paying in the and the insurance house insurance for their home homeowners insurance and they live in a hurricane area and the insurance companies have been so devastated lately because of hurricanes they've lost so much money and because the insurance company is not there for you to prosper they're there for themselves to prosper they exist to have profits and to prosper they're not in it for you because the devil is not in it for you the securities offers is not really for you it only looks like it's for you so ahead of hurricane season when it looks like it's potentially another season like we had last year as the science is saying they meant just ahead just this month amen they canceled either 5 000 or 50 000. i don't remember policies for homeowners and now homeowners have to scramble and find another policy what are they looking for they're looking for security but the security that that man often looks for is a false security because your insurance company cannot pay the claim they can find something down in the teeny writing on page 27 of the document that you scrolled to the bottom of and said i accept why because the because the insurance company is trying to secure themselves that's what that document's for not for your security it's for their security and you buy the insurance claim for your security and i'm not saying don't buy insurance don't this has nothing to do with insurance this is everything to do with the devil playing on the nature of man who wants to feel justified and he wants to be secure and he's willing man is willing to leave the word of god like in nimrod's day leave the word of god to multiply and replenish and replenish abundantly upon the earth they they were willing to leave the word of god and unify themselves to have security and man today is still willing to leave the word of god to find security and jesus says he will who will find his life will lose it but he who will lose his life for my sake shall find it why is it like that because god is requiring that we operate by faith and god god's mechanism for separating amen his righteous seed from the false vine is faith that is the requirement amen so we're saved by grace through faith amen and that not of ourselves it is a gift of god so the mechanism that would cause imputed righteousness amen would it would would be an indication of the grace that's in your life would be the the very thing that god has given to you that is placed within you before the foundation of the world which is the seed of god which is the capacity to believe the word of god and not just any word of god but the word of god for your day and when you believe the word of god for your day for the moment in time in which you're traveling this earth amen it's a signal amen that you're part of that grace and that you're an elect child of god and so god made the mechanism faith not a false security but faith is security but it's not a human mental security it's a different kind of security because faith is the evidence of things hoped for faith is the substance i'm sorry of things hoped for so faith is substance faith is evidence but man cannot without the seeding of god cannot rely on faith so he's looking for security and so now he's like brother brenham said he's trying to find a a super religion which is a super covering or a great covering or powerful covering or whatever kind of covering a super covering a super religion that he could he could be justified without coming to the atonement now we know that the atonement the atonement uh was the substitute or the covering amen the the the blood of an innocent substitute that would cover for you so in order to come to an atonement you have to first come to a judgment and this is the thing that's being avoided by mankind you have to come to a judgment and when you come to the judgment amend then god will pass judgment through his word that you are wrong and you are condemned and your actions are contrary to the word and you your fig leaves are not a good enough covering you're naked before the lord you're exposed and you're guilty amen and for most people that that traumatic experience is something they're not willing to go through but for the children of god god will bring them into judgment so that he can restore fellowship through the atonement so when father god come down in the garden of eden he came down to bring a judgment upon his children and as he brought a judgment upon the children he immediately slayed a lamb to give them a covering to cover their sins so that he could restore back fellowship because he's not just a judge he's a judge to all the world but he's a judge and a father to the elect and the father will bring us to atonement so the devil can easily make a religion appealing because you don't have to come to a judgment and you don't have to come to an atonement amen because it's not about restoring fellowship and unity with god it's about feeling justified and so the psychology of man the nature of man is comfortable with this and we'll go along with it but let's turn to first john chapter 1. first john chapter 1 and verse 5. this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him has no darkness at all remember we read out of the book of john when we opened up here that john was jesus was saying this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light for their deeds were evil what does that mean that means they did not want to come into the light because the light would have exposed their deeds they didn't want their deeds exposed because they were fine with their deeds as long as they could feel justified that's what happened with the jewish religion amen when jesus came as he spoke he was uncovering the fig leaves they're fig leaves that they had taken the law of moses and they had added to and they had altered and they'd fit in they'd sown they had taken the word and sown themselves a pattern of fig leaves that now was their covering but as jesus came and did the works which no man had done before and began to expound upon the word of god and answer their questions and not answer their questions and all the things he did all of a sudden their fig loose was turning translucent and then became transparent and then instead of saying oh judge me oh god and give me a covering they said let's get rid of this guy he's taking away our security he's making us uncomfortable praise god now they won't kill him they'll just change churches [Music] because it's it's beginning to make the fig leaf covering translucent and it's becoming transparent and i feel a spiritual pressure and i've got to get rid of that spiritual pressure and so and so many times a changing church there's righteous reasons for changing a church and god will have people change churches all the time and there's nothing wrong with changing a church depending on the motivation why the reason why if god leads and it's perfect amen but if all we're trying to do is find a church order that i can keep and remain comfortable and still be in the message see we're all susceptible to this there's no finger pointing here we're everyone's susceptible to this amen and all of a sudden a spiritual pressure will come and the question is is that the word or not the word amen not how do i feel and i don't like this pressure and i don't like feeling uncomfortable when i come to church but the question is is this the word of god amen is this the judging word of god amen trying to judge my deeds that are in darkness trying to bring me to the light amen are am i am i changing churches by the leadership of god and following the word or am i trying to get away from light so that a part of me can remain in darkness so that i can remain i can dress the way i want to dress and listen to the music i want to listen to and participate in the entertainment and have a little bit of the world without the exposing pressure of that light that's making me uncomfortable because what i'm looking for is comfort not judgment not atonement i'm looking for comfort and so you know churches are different and every church has its own kind of order amen and so sometimes what we do is we shop for an order that we feel comfortable keeping and we've got to the place in the message where we're changing our ladder like the baptist i'm moving my letter from this church to this church but i'm still baptist i'm moving from this church to this church so i can still be in the message but that the word won't make me uncomfortable anymore now it's not true for everybody it's only true for some and i have no idea who it's true for and not true for because it's an individual affair but we're all susceptible to this kind of thinking this nature of man and we have to get away from that denominational thinking that thinks i can just move my letter or move my membership from one assembly to another at my own will for my own comfort and my own peace and my own this and that and everything's okay because i'm still in the message you may have never been in the message to start with because the message is christ it's not a group of people it's not a building it's not a church it's not a it's not a common understanding it's not a set of doctrines even amen the message is christ it's a living breathing jesus christ present today that is the message and so many people want to get free from an uncomfortable feeling and stay in the message and the question is were you ever in the message because you can't join into the message you can't become part of the church and be in the message amen only way you're in the message is by a new birth you have to be born into christ [Music] amen and then when the preaching makes you uncomfortable then there's a question to say is that the word or not the word not how comfortable i am is is it the word or is it not the word if it's the word we say god judge me if it's not the word we say god help my brother that still doesn't mean that you have to leave until that's god leads you away but you definitely don't have to swallow down what's not the word and say god help my brother so let's go back to first john chapter 1 verse 5. i read the first verse 5 but i'll read it again this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light present tense light walk in the light as he is in the light not where the light was shining but where the light is shining we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin walking in the light will bring us into the atonement that's why brother branham said they believe they're getting people to the blood but they've rejected the very plan to get to the blood the word what word the word for your day amen is the walking in the light as he is in the light and if you walk in the light as he is in the light that's the only way he had to have fellowship with one another amen having a fellowship meeting doesn't equal fellowship having something labeled fellowship is not fellowship the only way to have fellowship one with another is to walk in the light as he is in the light and then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin but if we choose to remain in darkness how are we going to get to the blood amen that brings an atonement and at one that with god that brings us back into fellowship with god see we have to walk in the light and there's no darkness in him at all so the light will expose all the dark cracks of us the it'll the light will shine down and believe you me amen the light of this gospel will find a way to find the crack that you didn't know was there and it will find the dark spot that you had no clue that you had and it will begin to shine the light in that amen so that it can be purged so that we can be clean now in the message satan's eden the prophet of god says dear dear god he's in prayer now dear god on this platform there's this desk tonight where the gospel has been laid lord here lays handkerchiefs and little parcels that go into sick and afflicted let the prayer of faith lord fall from our hearts now in our sight and your sight then lord if there be any unclean thing in us lord take take us to judgment now what's brother brandon praying for make me feel okay i want to be all right he says he's coming amen he's coming in prayer and he says take us to judgment now and we plead for mercy if you're going to ask god to judge you you better plead for mercy reveal to us what we're doing wrong lord so we can ask to take the blood and cleanse us in christ is the mystery of god revealed brother says notice in this last day lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building a hybrid church a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of born again men building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ's little bitty flock see what is it that did that fallen angels the bible said it was fallen angels who listened to lucifer instead of christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close fallen angels what kind of angels luther wesley catholic pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the angels did and has fell into organization like lucifer's main hold at nicaea and what have they done organized the great ecumenical association of ministers to make an image unto the beast as the bible said and and building a christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like it see lucifer at his work i'm trying to bring you the threefold revelation or mystery of god what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like eve did fallen angels did wesley was a man of god but what followed him fallen angels got into him what was the angel's first creative beings of god but fell for lucifer's wisdom fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from men of god who has went forth to establish truths in the earth before that truth could go on and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of christ fallen angels came in and took it over and made a denomination made denominations out of it that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded what did he just say he said the reason the mystery of the seventh seal the reason the revelation of the seventh field mystery had to be unfolded is because fallen angels are out there constantly getting into every move of god what are the fallen angels getting into the bar room and the prostitute and the sports arena no the fallen angels were getting into every move of god and the fallen angels were now coming and they were convincing the people to stop moving with the light and to take this truth of god and fashion it by your own fashioning into a covering that's what the fallen angels have done and they've done it all the way through and they keep doing it all the way through but that's why brother branham said the revelation of the seventh mystery had to come why why would it come now because he prophesied that he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle the prophecy oh get this friends the prophecy of having a bride without sprout or wrinkle is the reason there had to be a prophecy of malachi 4. the reason there had to be a prophecy of luke uh of luke 7 uh elected luke 17 30. the reason had to be a prophecy of revelations 10 7 amen is because all the way back in the beginning adam was presented a bride fresh from his side and that bride fell in god's original plan amen went into ruin and he's been rebuilding the masterpiece amen so he's got to come to a time when he has a bride that won't fall the same way the bride has always fallen how has it fallen because the two vines intertwine and come together and the false vine begins to build a system around every truth of god and the elect of god get trapped into that system but god at the end time they brought the revelation of the seven seal mystery and peeled back amen that veil of denominationalism amen he peeled back he took the sword of the word and he ripped that veil from top to bottom amen so that you could see christ and you could see the mercy seat which is christ and he unwound those two vines why did the seven seal mystery have to be revealed in this day because of what happened all the way down through the bible fallen angels got in but praise god after the opening of the seals he killed all the fallen angels and they're not on earth anymore and they're not trying to influence where god's working no more they quit all their tactics they surrendered and said i give up that revelation was too much for me and i'm not even going to try anymore praise god brother brahm says in the message going beyond the camp more and more i'm made to believe that people are not getting to christ now i'm here to try to help in every way that i can and make my statement as clear as i know how to make them and you suffer with me if you will as i look and i preach across the nation and watch people i am fully persuaded that people are not getting to christ and i believe that it's the enemy that's throwed this hindrance because the reason i believe this he's not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a dogma or a doctrine or a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to christ the word if we're pointing people to anything but the word we're not pointing them to christ and i'd like to be careful and that we we make sure that we understand that we also know that pointing them to the word is pointing them to the light as he is in the light not where the light was but where the light is so as time progresses through a day and the sun moves through the sky if i want to point people to the light i must point to where that sun is in the sky so at nine o'clock in the morning i would say right there's the sun do you see it but if we get to noon time and i keep saying back there's the sun it was there i know it was there just keep looking there then you're no longer pointing them to the sun then you might catch up and say oh it's right there oh i i'm sorry but then six o'clock in the evening amen you can't point there anymore and you can't point there anymore but you've got to point over here and say this is where the sun is that's he's right there you see too many people are being pointed to the glare of a previous age and thinking that's light and not finding an atonement and not finding a restoration of fellowship with god so because they're not finding a restoration of fellowship with god satan is always the perverter who moves in and he's trying to take god's proper place of worship amen and so now when you point somebody to the glare of a previous age and you point them to a place where the sun's not shining amen because the sun was there and the sun's still shining there's some light left there so there could be a deception there could be a reflection there could be i mean there's still some light there somebody may not understand and they they go to walk in that light amen but because christ has moved on and you must come to him in present light to find atonement amen in restoration of fellowship with your father now you go back and you'll be brought into fellowship with the church and if it's the wrong kind of church you'll be brought into fellowship with satan himself because he's the head of the false church he said how can this be it's the way it's always been it is today like it's always been he said i'm still in going beyond the camp that's why i think that people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma or some sensation like said i danced in the spirit i spoke with tongues i felt fire run over me and do you know all those things can be impersonated by the devil there's just one thing that he cannot impersonate that's the word in the debate between he and jesus each time jesus defeated him it is written the word and i believe today that the reason the people are not coming to christ is because they're pete pointed many of them to a denomination you come join our church or you read our catechism or believe our doctrine or some system of some sort they're appointed in the wrong way and their action and the life that they live without christ proves in their own life is vindicated by that very thing for instance i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but back and forth across the nation i have condemned women wearing short hair that's the bible i've condemned women wearing shorts using makeups and every year it gets worse it shows that there is another finger pointing somewhere pointing them some other way and they're not getting through to christ and they say we belong to a church our church don't don't make no any difference what your church believes and i say whether right or wrong it don't make any difference what makes the difference is what you believe now you want to go to a church that believes right but the real question is what do you believe you can believe wrong in a right church you can believe right in the wrong church but a right church doesn't make you the right believer and the wrong church doesn't make you the wrong believer necessarily this is about the individual now let's go to mark 16 and take a look at a few scriptures mark chapter 16 and verse 15. mark 16 and 15. and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt thee they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover them so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following the reason that i read this a very specific reason is this is jesus's commission to his church and when he commissions them the believers there he tells him to go preach the gospel and he promises that he'll back up the gospel with signs following as a vindication that what they're preaching is the truth but jesus did not set up the order of the church first what he told him was to go preach the gospel he would send paul along later to set the order of the church so the bible pattern has laid out a very specific pattern amen the first thing that you do is preach the gospel not get somebody to church because there's an order and a structure to church paul set it up if paul set it up it's correct so what paul god sent paul along and paul was there to establish the church and set the order of the church amen but when when christ first sent out the disciples he didn't start by setting up the order of the church and inviting people to come into the order of the church he told them to go and preach the good news preach the gospel preach the present day truth and as many as believe they would be baptized and that didn't believe they would be damned and after the message after the message was getting out and getting spread the apostle paul would come along and establish the church so we make sure that we have to get the right order and they have to get the right thing in the right order the first thing to do is preach the gospel of jesus christ and then plant and establish the church in the order of the church but many times we get things backwards and we tried to bring people or even ourselves tried to get into the order of the church in order to receive the gospel but you can come to the order of the church and never receive the gospel you can be raised in the order and structure of the church and it can be a correct order and a correct structure amen but unless you've heard the gospel and repented and be baptized the order of the church does it come first amen the gospel comes first that's why if we invite somebody to church we invite them to hear the word we don't invite him to become part of the church amen because it's it's ingrained in the nature of man to want to find security and if now a man or a woman has confidence in another man or a woman and they have confidence in spiritual and they have confidence when they tell them that this church is right this is right doctor in the right order the right truth we've had a prophet it's all right come to our church you can convince somebody to join the church that hasn't even received the gospel yet because of their confidence in you and that where you're at it's correct and so they're taking your experience and then when they become part of the church now they get ingrained into the church become part of the worship come every sunday pay their tithes amen start even helping out in the church and participating in fellowships and they become part of the church life and never yet have come to the gospel that's what brother brown's talking about and so when jesus sent them out he established preach the present day truth first and then he'll send paul along to establish the church i i'm going to try to be careful today because the truth of god is a razor's edge one step to the right is the same as a mile million miles away one step to the left and brother bam said god can get you off on the left or to the right you can decide that you know churches are problems and ministries are a problem and people mess up the message so i'm going to stay home and listen to tapes all by myself but that's contrary to what the prophet is contrary to what paul established so that would be wrong but then to think well well you know you know i know that god is now manifesting his bride amen this is a church where the bride is i'm going to go join myself to the church to be part of the bride and that's just as wrong although you're all you're performing the commandments of the apostle paul and you're gathering together for church and and your all the order and structure of the church and submitting yourself to the elder although you're you're performing the commandments of paul amen you haven't even come the right way amen you're not even walking in the light as he is in the light because you want to be joined to it amen but you can't be joined to it you have to be birthed in it and so men can get the wrong concept so when i start to talk about church i i i'm i'm referring to the wrong approach to church and when i say the adult thy idolatry of church i know there's a true church but brother branham many times in his language at the end he's trying to separate church and bride the bride is a church a called out people that's absolutely right but then the rest of the church brother branham is painting in a very negative light because he's trying to bring the bride out of the church amen and there is a bride church the bride is a church but the whole church let's say a local assembly that believes the message the whole church is not bright is that fair that's not nice to say but brother branham said it in every group you have believers make believers and unbelievers and you cannot attend the right assembly and to be bright and then right the right attendance in the right assembly does not guarantee brideship even the even though the bride should gather to a local assembly see the fine line you can't do away with it but neither can you overemphasize it i'm still wanting to read here and going beyond the camp he said now i know there's some reason that people are not getting through to christ if they would they wouldn't act like that jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood sanctification comes from a greek word compound which means cleaned and set aside for service and when god cleans his people with the blood of jesus he cleans them from the filth of the world and sets them aside for service wherever jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate even to the full gospel people has come right back into the rut that they come out of what was the pentecostal church 40 or 50 years ago they cursed and damned and ridiculed the churches they come out of them denominations what did they do just like a dog to its vomit and a sow to its wallow they turned right back in the same place that they were hewed from from now and now their churches is just as filthy as the rest of them brother bannon is standing here and he's in 1960 whatever is preaching this and he's looking back at the revival of 1906 and now he's just a little over 50 years after that and he says they they curse the very thing they come out of and they've come right back why fallen angels got in and brought them right back to what they were and they're just as filthy he says it was something as i said this morning like the people are like peter said in in saint matthew 17 4-8 where he said it is good to be here let's build three tabernacles but the spirit bade the spirit made them not to do it said this is my beloved son hear ye him and he is the word that's who we're to look to the word not our enthusiasm or something else he is my word hear ye him and what did they see after his voice spoke to them even moses and elijah wasn't present neither was there a creed neither was there anything left but jesus only and he is the word that's all they seen now going without the camp so now when they were up on mount transfiguration and they they saw on a vision moses and elijah speaking with jesus and moses and elijah represented the the old testament represented the law and the prophets and when they saw this that peter says let's build three temples and he's saying no you don't understand all that was to bring you to this let's not go back and build a temple to moses moses was pointing you to christ let's not go back and build a temple to the prophets the prophets were pointing you to christ let's not go back and erect any edifice or build anything amen to show glory for a former life all the former light was trying to bring you to present tense light and he said this is my beloved son hear ye him what is that the word what word the revealed word for your day hear ye him and satan's eden he says now let us look now to this great for a few minutes this great sinful day that we're now living in i don't believe there was ever a day that i've ever read in history there's been greater days of persecution when the children of god was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're now living what's the most deceitful age this is the most deceitful age and why did the revelation the seven seals mystery have to come open because of what happened to the church ages and down through history amen it had to come open because this is the most deceitful age amen but this is the age that he's going to have victory and he's going to rise a bride out of this egg and lift her up by his word and she's not going to fall in the same trap of the devil she's fell in before that's what the opening of the seals did for us it took the veil away so this thing could be exposed he said there's been greater days of persecution when the children of god was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're now living it's the most cunning deceitful day and when i see that it brings this that the christian has to be more on his toes today than he ever was in any age so don't get comfortable because i've got a good church and we've got we know we've got a message we've got a good church and we've got all that this is not the time to relax and get comfortable and say all is well with me everything is fine this is the time for the christian to be more on his toes than ever before now back in the days of the persecution of rome to the church a christian make a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to the lions or something like that when they found him of being a christian for his testimony but his soul was saved because he was a purely unadulterated believer in god and gladly sealed his testimony with his blood as the veins let loose through the holes in his body and the blood bled out he would scream up with real royal faith and say receive my spirit lord jesus but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe that they are christians when they're not there is the thing you don't have to see oh it's more cunning day than it would be than when you had to seal your life away with your testimony the devil has said every cunning trap that he can he's a deceiver and jesus told us in matthew 24 how this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day that ever lived so close that it would deceive the very elected of god of god if it were possible for him to deceive again in satan's in he says the god of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan but it's satan impersonating himself as the church satan impersonating himself as the church see as the church they worship satan thinking they are worshiping god through the church but it's the way satan has done it oh you say but wait a minute we preached the word look back here at my text satan was the one that preached the word to eve first god has said see it's that misconstruing the part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know all jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they give for this day then that was applied to another age let's turn to numbers 21. numbers 21 and verse 6. and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died therefore the people said to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray on pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he look looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man then when he lit when he believe beheld the serpent of brass he lived let's go to second kings chapter 18. we're all very familiar with the brazen serpent it's it's actually a foreshadow of jesus christ paying the price of atonement for our fiery bite that we received to the serpent in the garden of eden and so it's a foreshadow of jesus christ it's a good sign it was a it was a good serpent on a good pole and it brought real healing it brought an actual atonement for that day it was the word of god manifest in that day and the word of god manifest in that day was bringing life from the bite of the fiery serpent is that right so it was the light it was the life it was the word the prophet had brought it amen according to what god's word was that he made the serpent on a pole and and he and they lifted it up and and it's just it's pointing to christ being lifted up and and dying on a cross to pay the price for the fiery bite of the serpent or the bite of the fiery serpent so it was a good sign it was it was a it was a good um it was a good piece it was the word of the lord for that day and it was correct but let's look at second kings 18 when we come into the kingdom of hezekiah hezekiah becomes king and he starts to do many things and in verse 4 it says he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the groves and break in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made same brazen serpent why did moses make it because god told him to what was the purpose to save life so the servant that moses had made for unto those those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nahushtan they began to worship the brazen serpent and god never wanted them to worship the brazen serpent god wanted them to worship him god gave the commandment to have a brazen serpent and that was the manifested word for that day the the the bite of the fiery serpents was because of the murmuring and complaining it was a judgment of god but when god brought a judgment he also brought an atonement to save their life and that was the brazen serpent and so now when they would get bit if they would look to that they would live and it was a great thing that was done in that day and if you were bitten in that day and you looked and you lived you would have admiration for god and thanksgiving for god and for a moses who would listen to god and for whoever it was that crafted that pole and set it up there you would be thankful for the whole lot but that you would know it wasn't the man who made the poll wasn't the man who set it up there it wasn't moses but it was god but a few generations later they get to the place where they make an idol out of the very thing that god commanded to be built and they they begin to burn incense and they begin to worship the idol and now the thing that god had put in place to save them becomes the thing that diverts their worship from god and diverts their worship to idolatry which under idolatry satan is always the one being worshipped because he's the father of idolatry what is idolatry idolatry is worth worshiping something you make with your own hands that you believe represents god so what is idolatry idolatry is something that you make you craft amen that you believe represents god and you worship it so now they crafted this according to the word of the lord but it was crafted by a man or men put up and then they had saved it afterwards like because who wants to destroy it i mean it was wonderful so it was the problem was never the brazen serpent the problem was their approach to the brazen serpent the brazen serpent was never evil oh i hope you catch this it's going to mean so much to you you can't fault the brazen serpent the problem wasn't the brazen serpent the problem was the heart of the people who wanted to worship the brazen serpent brother bam says and the god who is rich in mercy first i'd like to make this note it just comes to my heart there was a group of people that were beginning to worship brother branham as jesus christ baptizing in his name praying in his name worshiping him it was never brother branham's fault he was commissioned by god his gifts were ordained by god the works in his life were the vindication of god amen he was in his place in his supposed duty doing what god was supposed to do he struck out against that he condemned it but it continued going on it was not his fault it was the fault of the worshiper just like it wasn't moses's fault for making the brazen serpent it wasn't uh uh the brazen serpent's fault and it wasn't god's fault it was the worshiper's fault because they approached it with the wrong attitude with the wrong amount of reverence with the wrong approach and the wrong mental thinking they were deceived into worshiping the brazen serpent in in in this generation they were deceived into worshiping brother branham and that spirit continues on because spirits don't die spirits don't die so there's still those out there that worship william branham and so i also like to say this because it just comes to me if you listen to dawson reilly's testimony dawson reilly it says that one day brother branham was talking to him and explaining that there was people that were baptizing in his name and and brother branham was coming against that he was just sharing that with dawson reilly and this isn't dawson's testimony and dawson said he says you know i thought oh wow how could they do that and brother branham looked at him and says dawson they're not as far off as you think. and dawson said well i thought they was pretty far off see it's a razor's edge because it was jesus christ the son of man in that son of man but it wasn't the son of man the flesh of that son of man amen it was jesus christ himself in that son of man so i believe to me that's why brother abraham could say they're not as far off as you think amen they found the place of jesus christ but they've mistook the vessel that he's using for him they got it confused and what they did is they entered into idolatry and they began using the vessel that god they began worshiping the vessel that god was using instead of worshiping the god that was using the vessel and so that's the spirit of idolatry and like i said satan is behind all idolatry he's the one who's actually being worshipped because jesus christ cannot receive that kind of worship worshipping a man the devil's the only one who can receive that so let me keep reading here and the god who is rich in mercy now that's just the same thing i think that's happened to our church ages god sent us a message of martin luther with his message john wesley the pentecostal message but what did we do with it the very same thing that they did with the brass serpent we idolized it i belong to this and i belong to that listen we made it an idol by membership you see you belong to something without the sincerity that's connected with genuine godly worship of the word i'm going to repeat that phrase because it's god that's the phrase that's got to sink in you belong to this i belong to that you see you belong to something without the sincerity that's connected with genuine godly worship of the word what happened the bible we are told in the bible that the prophet took that idol and destroyed it hallelujah what we need on the scene today is a prophet that will destroy the idol of denominations that thinks they're going into heaven upon belonging to some creed or denomination needs to be destroyed and burn up throw it away god is full of mercy he is rich in mercy in the day that when we would have all been in that chaos of darkness out there but god rich in mercy has sent us the real genuine holy ghost with his own interpretation to it right here in the building every night god rich in his mercy how wonderful we find him to be yes sir now all they thought they could do was just to go to the snake or this little thing that god had made out there and moses to make and hang on a pole and they could be healed without any sincerity they stood and looked at it and they got to idolizing it and god sent a prophet along and destroyed it now all that refused to look at that serpent in the wilderness they perished now god makes a way but if you refuse to look at it if you will sit across the street if you hold on to some creed or refuse to look straight into the word and see whether it's right or not all that refuses to look they perished and god is never changing a never-changing god and all who refuse to look perished so is it today the same thing then the people sinned later and as they always did and made the idol out of it making it trying to get healing without sincerity and they belong to something and the way we do it today and now we see then the difference of it was see it was a good atonement and a good sign for that time that time it was all right but it was just to be for that time for that journey that's all it would work for that journey and the message that martin luther brought of justification was all right for luther's age that's as far as it went sanctification was fine in wesley's age that's as far as it went then we come into the pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing it was fine in the age but we are going beyond that now we are beyond that just as sure as there's a world we've got to become beyond this thing because we have done the same thing with it that they did before make an idol out of it i belong to this order of it i belong to that order of it i don't want you to think denominations now i want you to think what's gone on in the deception all around us when people take the wrong approach the wrong approach to the things of god i belong to this order of it i belong to that order of it god will send somebody that will smash the thing and tear it to pieces and confirm his word the full word praise be to god now we see that's the true god rich in his mercy this is the thing we have to guard against in ourselves taking what god set up and what god's structuring what god gave and make an idol out of it in satan's eid in 1965 and that's why satan has done this and he has worked through the ministry to do it as god promised he would do now he began by a religious deceit in eden and has continued ever since not by setting up a bunch of communist communists has nothing to do with this it's the church that's where you have to watch see it's not the communists that would deceive the very elect it's the church that'll deceive the very elect see it isn't communist we know they deny god and their antichrist sure they are in principle but they're not the antichrist the antichrist is religious very religious and can quote the scripture and make it look so plain let's go to second corinthians together god in this day has spared us from denominationalism and he is he has exposed denominationalism and he has separated us from denominational spirits but we have to be wary that those spiritual influences don't creep back in on us that we allow the word to keep them at bay and don't let those attitudes and approaches brother chad we would never start a denomination we wouldn't start a denomination with a headquarters and a title and a charter and all of this but that same approach that same attitude that same spirit that would cause us to look upon the things that god has done and the things that god has said in order and look upon them wrong and we could fall by the same trap in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 3 paul says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them this this is where brother ben takes his text for the god of this evil age in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe lot lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus saying for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us this is a religious day and in this religious day satan is the worship person of this age and he is blinded the mind the god of this world has blinded the minds of the people so that the light of the gospel won't penetrate and how has he done it he has done it through religion that's how he's done it that's the tactic brother there says and satan's eaten again now by unbelief in no taking all the word of god has brought a seed of unbelief unholy sinful hatred and eternal death in this sinful intellectual church age now you got it in this day what when the world is religious do you know the whole world is religious and in this religious age big churches on every corner everything the whole thing winds up in satan being worshipped and all the religion it winds up in satan being worshiped i don't want that kind of religion i want to come through the judgment of the word through the atonement of the blood into a restored relationship and fellowship with my god i don't want religion i don't want formalism i don't want all the traps of the denomination i want all of that stripped away by the word of the word of god that he's brought to us in this hour to strip it all away so see it doesn't matter i'd say it this way i don't know how to say it without saying it but try to get what i mean because i'm going to say things that are wrong if you take it the wrong way but it doesn't matter what church you sit in now you say that brother chad it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what church you said in i mean you got to go to a good church you've got to go where they believe the truth i mean you know what i mean but you you'd say you got the best church with the perfect doctor and everything's right which none of that exists but i mean but let's just say we have it somewhere we all go to that church it's it doesn't matter what church you go to if your approach to that church is wrong you can make that church your idol and you can begin to worship the church and not the truth just like their approach to william branham he was the right messenger for the age he was correct but sitting there didn't do them any good because they had a wrong spirit and the wrong spirit gave him the wrong approach to that man and his gift and it pushed him into idolatry and so that's why i want to say the idolatry of the church i don't want you to think i'm talking about i mean the truth there's a true church the bride the called out ones amen but i'm talking about the whole structure amen that paul set up and that brother branham confirmed attending church having a song service having preacher closing songs there's a structure right gathering on the first day of the week even a midweek service reading the prayer requests from the platform so all of that's fine paul was the one who was first established at church brother branham came in and confirmed it amen and we want to be correct to that but if you come to that with the wrong approach amen because the devil used the brazen serpent that he told moses to build amen to bring a deception and idolatry in the hearts of the people and this devil got into the law of moses and he got into the priesthood that god established with the law that god had brought and he turned it into idolatry where they began to worship the religion and not worship the god who gave the the form and structure and order they began to worship the temple and not the god in the temple because when god left the temple at the crucifixion or at the baptism i believe at the baptism of jesus christ there was no longer a shekinah glory back there because because john the baptist saw it come upon jesus so when he finally ripped that apart when jesus christ was on the cross it showed that there was no shekinah glory there but they weren't interested in worshiping the shankara glory they had so idolized the temple in the jewish religion that the priests could go secretly and stitch up that curtain knowing god's not there and continue worshiping that's the power of idolatry that so formed a structure and a system that god had said god set the feast days god set the calendar god set the proper sacrifices god sent the priesthood god instituted all of these things god gave the word god brought moses god vindicated moses god did all of these things he anointed the priesthood he did all of that but then the devil got in where god was working and began to bring a perversion that doesn't mean there wasn't still truth there that doesn't mean there wasn't still elect there but again to bring a perversion because these vines are intertwined and when he brings a perversion in then he diverts worship from god to the thing that god ordered see how deceptive see how close they begin to worship the tabernacle but the tabernacle was a reflection of one in heaven and they were to worship the god who was making his presence known among them through the existence of a tabernacle he was trying to bring himself into their midst so that they would look at that tabernacle and they would recognize god is in our midst and they would worship the god in their midst but they the satan under idolatry convinced them to stop worshiping the god in her midst and start worshiping the temple to where god can remove his presence and it doesn't stop the worship because the worship wasn't about any more worshipping the present god it was about worshiping the thing that god ordered see if you look at our whole structure of church which is nothing don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong we're not doing anything wrong but you even look at we have a consecrated place that we don't allow anything to take place in this sanctuary there's no running around no frolicking not even loud talking between services we keep the doors shut and keep it keep it reverent reverence secretary brother graham taught us to do that there's nothing wrong with that referencing the secretary because this is the place we come together to worship god and we want to keep the atmosphere correct but we can move from referencing the sanctuary to almost idolizing the sanctuary like this then becomes the only place to talk to god or the best place to talk to god you understand what i'm saying we can begin to take the wrong approach amen to even you know we'd lower our voice we don't talk when we're in here we stay focused even the way the seats are arranged look at where the seats are arranged there's a central focal point and that the central focal point is an elevated platform that's not wrong brother branham had it said the same way so i'm it's not i'm not saying it's wrong but our approach to it can be wrong we can come with the wrong attitude in the wrong spirit and come down and quiet and reverent and we see require then we start the worship we raise our hands and we're all focused to the elevated platform then all of a sudden the man with the message the man god's called anointing for that day he's not he's off site and we're in and we're we're building and worshiping but now it's time for the word to come and the man emerges from around behind the curtain and comes to the focal point and you can see without the right spirit amen you can begin by the nature of man to elevate those on the platform it's why when you you're sometimes when you're raised in truth and you're raised around all this and you don't have any other uh um thinking or anything to break up that thing it's become so normal and so routine that then we begin to we begin to take the wrong approach even to the ministry or the wrong approach even to the pastor not that we're not supposed to have a pastor and not that we're not supposed to stay in the back room until we come out brother bam told us to do that so it's not wrong but you can come down and you can see how the devil can pervert that to where you begin to where you begin to over value that human being standing behind that desk not the gift of god not the presence of god operating through a gift but you begin to overvalue that human being it's a dangerous place for the minister and the congregation i can tell you as i've started preaching this amen i start realizing that that i don't want to do this it's put the fear of god in me because somebody could take the wrong approach to you and it's not even your fault like they did brother branham or you could present yourself in such a way to encourage them to take the wrong approach and have the wrong estimation in the wrong value it's such a dangerous place to be that we're utterly dependent on the spirit of god because as human beings we will fail we will ruin everything and what is this this is what god established this is what paul set in place what brother branham confirmed amen we're doing the best that we know how to do what what has been brought to us through the message of the hour and through the scriptures so we're trying to follow the order that god gave but but very quickly you can begin worshiping the order and the structure and not the god who ordained it because the worship person of this age is satan and how is he being worshipped as the church and we're going to say well that's baptist that could be somebody who's raised in the message has never had an experience and views coming to church is worshiping god now do we worship god we come to church yes but coming to church isn't automatically worshiping god they're not the same thing but we worship god when we come to church at least that's our desire but coming to church is not worshiping god singing the songs is not worshiping god sitting quietly following along in our bible reading the scriptures is not necessarily worshiping god we could do all of that and just be worshiping the structure and form of the church and finding our security in the church why because it's a message church and the wrong approach towards that could be completely wrong we have to keep christ in focus all the time through our songs through the way we worship the way we approach and the way we come in and the way we go out the way we treat one another the way that we view the gifts the way that we even view the elevated platform there's an elevated platform so you can see me i can see you and you can hear me and i i can hear your feedback it serves a function and there's nothing wrong with the function but you realize the devil can pervert the function and bring the wrong approach and the wrong approach will start to bring spiritual death not life because we can start depending on the great man who hides in the back and comes out with the perfect word and because at that man he's my ticket to salvation i believe everything he says we've got to be careful friends you've got to be careful and i've got to be careful we have to be dependent upon god the devil can make everything god makes for right and he can turn it for evil he's a perverter not a creator he perverts he doesn't create god creates god orders and he perverts god's order we have to make sure that our mental approach is right that our worship is directed in the right place that our confidence is placed in the correct thing now we should have confidence in one another but not over confidence in one another we should respect and honor one another but that respect and honor for one another should never supersede the word of god never at any time our respect and reverence for the ministry for the gifts for the office of pastor and every other ministry gift song leader musicians and all that there should be a respect and a reverence and a thanksgiving for those gifts that god has sent to the church but never over the word of god all of our devotion all of our worship all of our praise is to christ and christ is the word the word takes preeminence over everything and we have to make sure that those old denominational spirits don't try to slip back in in the right order the right structure the right place done the right way and bring the wrong results brother ben says in the revelation of jesus christ out of the church age book he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights them he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church there it is friends that's what god has given us through the opening of the seals a revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as thor definitely thwarted today is when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them praise god i want to read a quote out of a message from 1960 the 10 virgins and 144 000 jews it says all right now during this church age oh there's something so beautiful i like this so well during these church ages there is two spirits working almost alike right down through here one is the denomination the other is the holy ghost and jesus said they were so close that they would deceive the very elect if possible these two spirits are marking their people for future judgment satan promises that that he would have more than christ and he has now watch this real real close now as we get to this more than it we would we would be marking the people many are like eve eve just stopped long enough to be deceived if she hadn't stopped there'd have never been no deceiving i want you to catch what he's saying now she stopped long enough to listen to the serpent she stopped amen and whatever she was doing whatever progress she was making in the garden whatever life god had called her to she stopped long enough just to listen and he said she stopped if she hadn't stopped there'd never been no receiving but eve stopped and when she stopped that's where she got her deceiving instead of pressing on do you follow follow me close now now listen what he's saying he's not just talking about just stopping to stop moving long enough to hear but he said if she would have been pressing on pressing on in the word pressing on in the commandment pressing on in the place she was amen because pressing on into the real revelation of the word she didn't press on to the real revelation come from god amen she was there was a commandment to multiply and replenish and before the real revelation come from god on what to do the serpent came in and he began to give her his own interpretation and instead of pressing on she stopped that's what he says and instead of pressing on do you follow me follow me close now the reason that eve was deceived let's say it together so i'll be sure you get it the reason he was deceived she never kept the full word of god satan quoted it to her but he never told her all the truth neither does his denomination see but she stayed long enough to get part of the word and didn't take all the word and that's what's the matter today the sleeping virgin stayed long enough to get part of the word but not all the word the deceived church stays long enough to get part of the word but not all the word and they were sincere and honest about it eve was deceived the bible said she was deceived see the sleeping virgin stayed long enough to get part of the word but not all of the word they didn't press on to the full revelation that god was going to bring in this day and gone through a prophet brought the full revelation of the full word and and i'd like to um i'd like to just share from my heart my concern my concern is that that today some are not somewhere stopping with part of the word but not pressing to the full revelation of the full forward because we're very versed in the fact that god sent a prophet according to malachi 4 in revelation 17 30 and that the seals were open remember we realized that that was the forerunner ministry and the forerunner ministry has something that follows the forerunner ministry and and brother branham came in a four month ministry and he was four running and he was forerunning the bride coming of christ he was forerunning the bride age amen the calling out of laodicea in the bride age and he was bringing us into an eagle age into a bright age and he was forerunning the bride coming of christ but if we don't push all the way into the full revelation we can stop part way into the revelation and come to the forerunner ministry and be like the disciples of john now there was two disciples of john and it was andrew and john who when they saw john say this is him this is the lamb they left john and they begin to follow christ just like in our day there was some people who when brother branham when he says the the angel of the lord told me turn it to the right and i turned it and said what is it that's our lord it's our lord up there there was some people who would leave the forerunner ministry and come to the lord [Music] i'm not talking about leaving behind brother banham but but we didn't come to mary brother branham he was the friend of the bridegroom he was eleazar who was going to bring us to meet isaac amen and he began to show us that in the air between heaven and earth because isaac where did isaac meet rebecca between heaven and earth so in the air between heaven and earth amen there's a cloud amen that represents the coming of the son of man and in that cloud is the face of jesus christ and and you could look and say who is that what is that but eliezer said that's my master and she slid down off of the camel and she went running to isaac but if we're not careful we can get inoculated by enough truth that we don't look for the rest of it that we don't keep pressing for god to continually be unveiling himself to us so that we can seem clearer and clearer and clearer we can come to the ministry of john because because john was here to point us amen to christ but after christ had come and he had left and now he was working in and through his disciples amen paul met some disciples of john who were going around and talking about jesus christ coming talking about christ and see they were still clinging to the gospel of john because they had they they had missed his coming and they had to get re-acquainted with him in the apostle paul because that's where he was then he was working in and through the apostles in his church and see you can see how deception can come all around us when we can we can mentally acknowledge that god's improvement we can see those works and we can testify that no man can do that and he must have been malachi 4 and he must have been the fulfillment of scripture and that must be right because nobody can do that and we like the order and the structure of the church and we can come in under that truth that's absolutely truth amen that we can sit down and we begin we can we can begin to worship under that truth but reject the rest of the word and i don't mean not understand it because there's many days the rest of us we didn't understand it they mean there was more to it that we didn't understand and there's still more there i believe there's more that god's revealing all the time but i'm talking about rejecting i'm going to hold this and reject that and all it is is a further unveiling of the same thing the message that was given to us and we can we can turn our church and our worship into idolatry because we refuse to move on with christ and we refuse to walk in the light as he is in the light and what we can do under that status is we can become religious i don't want to be religious i don't want to church walk i want him i want him unveiled and i want him more unveiled tomorrow than he was today and i want to see more of him and more of him and more of him and all that he wants to show me i want to see i'm not satisfied already amen if there's more to be had is there's more to know if there's more he wants to reveal then there's more that i want it's as if god says there's more i want to show you and you say i'm satisfied with the portion that i have like you get married and after the honeymoon amen you sit down and you start to talk to your wife and you start to say oh man i remember back when i was five years old me and my dad said uh i don't want to hear that why don't i want to reveal myself to you no we're already married i don't need to know anything else you know this flesh is so deceptive you know what your flesh wants to do find a place to settle down quit reaching forth in the spirit because it takes a lot of spiritual energy that's where the first church age failed they stopped reaching forth in the spirit your flesh i'll just say not your flesh i'll tell you what my flesh wants i want a good pastor and a good church and i want a good job and i want to play with my kids every evening in the backyard and have prayer at bedtime and come to church on sunday and go back home and that's what i want do you understand what i'm saying because i want to rest under somebody else's responsibility that's a temptation of the devil to come to a place of rest under the banner of the church because the church is in order we've got all the officers we've got a pastor i'm coming under rest under the order of the church we're never to come under rest we're walking with him we have to walk with him as he's in the light we have to daily walk with him we have to seek after him like like i was preaching on wednesday amen we have to pursue after him if there's more to be found i want to see more if there's no more to show i certainly don't want to make up more you can overreach the wrong way i mean you can go over on one side you can the other but if there's more to be revealed and i know there's more to be revealed because there's an eternity of discovering god so how have we come to the end of it friends how we even come to the end of the message because the message is christ how have we come to the end of christ i want to keep reaching forth in the spirit and not what my flesh wants what the outer man wants to find a comfortable place to pitch my tent and start raising my crops that was what that's how the israelites failed they drove enough demons out to get security but they didn't drive them all out just enough to feel secure and then those demons that were left those religious spirits that remained around them they put them under tribute and made a deal with them and put them under subjection and said you religious spirits you can only go so far you can't raise up anymore but the very thing they put in a tribute tribute became a prick in their flesh and a thorn in their eye amen it came back to be the very thing that destroyed them they should have never stopped until every thing that god told them to do was done until every enemy force was gone but what did they wanted they wanted to get down to the business of finding rest and they wanted to raise their crops they wanted to go ahead and plant because they wanted to get a big crop next year i'm going to go ahead and get my sheep established i'm going to get my barn built i want to secure this i'm going to start raising my family and i just want a place to settle down many times that's what a fellowship of believers has become just a place where somebody just wants to settle settle down under a good pastor and we have good deacons and the church is in order and everything is everything is just the way i'm comfortable with it i feel secure and i just want to settle down and just start going to church you don't even realize it but that's the very day you stop gaining ground it's not wrong to not like your church and not enjoy the fellowship but if it causes us to stop pressing forth stop seeking him stop wanting to know him more the very thing that god uses and god is using today for his glory can be the very thing that becomes an idol we can start worshiping the fellowship of the believers we start worshipping the church and now we're not worshiping the word let's turn to matthew 24 24. just a couple more scriptures and we'll close matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible say it should deceive the very elect so these false christs and false prophets they can show great signs and wonders so the great signs and wonders great signs and wonders come from god and they're part of the experience of christianity and part of the true church but they can also be used to deceive they're right but they can be used for wrong and it says if it was possible they shall deceive the very elect so what is it that we're supposed to be looking for what is it that god's given us to protect us what is it to keep us from deception what is it that god's given us and brother brown begins to speak of this in the message see the seed is not there with the shuck he says no to see how close it looks matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people i'd like to say this you could have church people and bride people sitting on the same road make sure we're careful about that the the spirit of the church people the spirit of the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close read this one more scripture with me first john i don't know if it'll be the last one or not probably not but let's read one more i didn't mean to be deceptive that was an accident first john first john 4 and verse 1. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is present tense today is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world the anointed ones at the end time brother ben says these trees the true vine and the false vine you've heard me preach on that since from years ago how they've grown up together brought them in individuals and showed that from cain and abel the two vines that met at an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them desiring life catch this both religious both anointed both desiring life it wasn't like cain's worship was dry and dead he was anointed like abel was anointed and brother branham even said they had the same anointing anointed both of them desiring life and worshipping the same god and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that the one was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the bible said by faith hebrews 11 chapter by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified that he was righteous jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say i the son of man am so peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church what the true revelation of the word there is the true vine again abled by faith further down in the same message he says the true vine and the false vine both had the same anointing so you can't go by feeling or anointing so the true vine and the false vine both had the same anointing the water fell on both of them no wonder he warned us it would deceive the very elect if it was possible brother branham said that the the wheat and the tares grew up together and he saw the rain coming and then they were both in a drought and they needed the word amen and their heads were drooped over and when the rain came the water of the word came he said the wheat raised up their head and said praise god and the tares raised up their heads and said praise god they both went home that day and said that was a good service amen notice they look the same they're anointed the same but notice by the fruit how do you know it how you know that isn't an orange because it's bearing grapefruit that vine is all right it's living in the tree but it's bearing a grapefruit it isn't like the first one and if a church says they believe jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever and deny his power deny his works deny his word the church that believes in jesus christ will do the works of jesus christ it'll have the life of jesus christ and if it isn't no matter if the life is pouring into it if it isn't predestinated from the roots it'll bear grapefruit every time or something different but if it's the predestinated life and the roots it'll bear jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if it's the word coming up through the root which he is the root the beginning of time notice but it's what they produce that tells you the difference by the fruit jesus said you shall know them man does not gather grapes off of a thistle even though the thistle be right in the grapevine they could be possible but the fruit will tell it what is the fruit the word for the fruit for the season what is the fruit remember the false anointed ones can do mighty signs and wonders now is it true that the church will have the same work same spirit of christ yes same work same spirit same life of jesus christ but the false vine can do signs and wonders but brother branson said what is the fruit the word for the fruit for the season that's what it is their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the season what time it is man's doctrine denominational doctrine but or god's word for the season where can you tell the difference the word for the season the teaching the anointing's the same the worship can be the same the desire to worship god worshipping the same god can all be the same but abel had the revelation of the word for his season cain couldn't catch that and when abel expressed it cain became angry and began to persecute abel and even killed him because he had to stop the voice that exposed his nakedness because abel had caught the revelation of the word for his day cain couldn't catch it but but cain neither could he conform to it so he had to kill it let's look at matthew 16. matthew 16. and 13 matthew 16-13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith in them but whom say ye that i am simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it what was the revelation the revelation of who the present tense christ is that's what he built his church upon that revelation which didn't come from flesh and blood but came from the father who's in heaven brother ben said christ the mystery of god revealed he's not saying my church now my church has nothing to do with it he said it brother branham said it my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching what's it against it's against the teaching of an individual one person individually connected to christ by a revelation of the word for their day all hell is against that teaching what does hell want another system i'm going to say it and i hope that you i just pray you understand my heart but the devil can turn your church here into a system in your mind and it's no longer me in christ but it's us in christ and the revelation of this hour is not us in christ the revelation this hour is you in christ and if the devil comes and starts to bring comfort in the group and brings comfort into conformity of the church order i can act like everybody look back everybody attend all the services participate in all the functions that can be an idol to you but the real revelation of this hour is the revelation of jesus christ to you as an individual you and christ as the self-same persons together as one not us but him and i the devil is constantly trying to bring it back into us bring security in us bring us back into form so that we feel secure and everything's okay because of all of us but god does not want it to be in us he wants it to be a me i've met christ i know him as my savior he's revealed the message to me i know who he is i know where he is i know the proper place of worship i know how to i know how to come to the atonement how not because some man explained it to me but god quickened it in my heart i know it's the truth i'm not just going along because i'm afraid if i don't i'll be lost amen amen that is formalism that is denominationalism i'm not just coming to the message because i don't know what else is right that's the same problem i'm not just going along with the message because i can't find something better because it can't be topped because it's the best all of that is back to denominational thinking and i'm not going along with what's said and what's taught because i'm afraid if i don't i'll be wrong that's not it either i'm doing what god wants me to do because i know this is what he wants me to do not just because the man in the pulpit said it when the man in the pulpit said it god in my heart quickened it like that i saw him in the word and said that's the truth that's why i do it not just because he said it if i do it just because he said it i could be making an idol out of the minister but i do it because it's the word of god and god's given me a revelation that it's the word of god and i know this is the message for the hour and i know what he's called me to and i know who he is not because i figured anything out or was taught unto me but god amen because god when he looked at peter peter the rest of the disciples their first response was well you know we think some experts say this and some experts say that and i heard a preacher say this and i heard a brother over here say that and sister so-and-so says this my mom and dad always said and i've always believed and we teach in our church let that language leave your vocabulary it's got to come down to this is christ i know this is him and i'm joining to him in an invisible union because he came to me and he can look at you and say blessed art thou insert your name for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you and upon this rock i will build my church the revelation personally to you the devil would love to take the message and move it back into a group but the message is christ you can't denominate christ that doesn't mean people around the message can't take it the nominational spirit absolutely without a doubt but you can't denominate christ and this message is christ you can denominate some man's idea of the message you can denominate a group's idea of the message but you cannot denominate the message because the message is christ it's the full revelation of the full word even the parts you don't yet understand it's still true i'm going to read this again of christ is the mystery of god revealed my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth jesus never said now peter you and john and all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally i say unto thee thee not them to thee thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means a stone stone means the confessed one or the separated one upon a certain stone upon a certain thing see it called out the church called out upon this stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it to you but upon this revelation called out group i'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it why will the gates of hell not withstand it because you're super special and you're really bright you got a strong willpower no the gates of hell will never be able to withstand the revelation because you've got a capacity a god-given predestinated capacity to catch the revelation of the word and the devil can't interrupt that he can't stop it amen he can't block the transmission amen it comes in a frequency he can't stop and the word goes forth and revelation clicks and revelation clicks and you hear the message you read your bible and click click click click click and the revelation is leading you and guiding you into all truth and the gates of hell cannot withstand that because the gates and hell try to infiltrate amen try to move in systemize shut down and stop the progress of revelation but now the gates of heaven cannot prevail not because of your strength your brightness your your education your ability or whatever that's no match i mean you are no match for the devil and any of the the gifts or abilities that you have yourself but the ability to receive revelation is the secret key that the devil cannot stop and be with revelation in our lives the gates of hell will never prevail against us but we will prevail over them because it will be god one step at a time revelation upon revelation not we but me you as an individual me as an individual god leading us by his word and what's going to be amazing is you as an individual me as an individual and others as individuals are going to wind up in the same plot spot someday not because we did it together not because we relied on one another not because we got comfortable in the group or we all went together but because individually he led us all and we all went to the same place i don't want religion i don't want a comfort that comes from participation is participation required if you believe the word can you forsake the assembling and together yourselves no that's the word can you assemble for the wrong comfort and make an idol out of your assembly participation if you believe the word you participate you believe the word you pay your tithes if you participate you come to church and show your support what brother ben said you respond to the word you we do all the things that we're told to do but the deception of the devil will try to come in and make participation equal to an experience and make participation in the order of the church equal to salvation and you can't draw that equal sign because by grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god and works is faith expressed works can't produce faith you can't get it backwards jesus didn't say go build a church and invite everybody into the church he said go preach the gospel those that believe will be baptized and i'll send paul later to set up the church you've got to come to christ first and repent you've got to come by faith and then the order of the church you begin to express your faith by obedience to the word of god but your obedience to the word of god will never produce faith faith produces your obedience you can obey but that won't guarantee faith works is faith expressed grace is what god did for me works is what i do to show my love for him amen let's all stand musicians if you come brother john if you make your way up i pray that god will place into your heart what he was dealing with me on and that you won't misunderstand what i'm saying because it's a razor's edge friends you could find yourself saying things too harshly and being against the very thing that god established and that god wants to use he wants us to gather in fellowship he wants us to have a church he wants an order and structure to service he wants everything to be done decently and in order so you can strike too hard against something and be absolutely against the word of god but you can take it the other way and you can have all the order without christ and you can be absolutely on the wrong road there we've got to come to an individual revelation jesus christ revealed personally to you a relationship that nobody else can share with you you have to have a relationship your spouse can't share with you it sounds horrible but it's the truth you have to have a relationship with christ your spouse can't share that relationship with you because it's an individual you can worship together you can serve god together but that spouse can't share that personal intimate in your soul relationship with you and god that's what god wants he wants the relationship he's not after the religion he created angels to worship him he doesn't need your religious service what he wants is your fellowship what he wants is the relationship of his attributes back together again the seals came open to strip the nominational spirits away to reveal the error so that this bride won't fall into the same trap and i say thank you god thank you god and it's going to be his strength and his word and his revelation that keeps us we won't keep ourselves stay under the washing of the water of the word and let the washing of the water of the word wash all of the stain of the prostitute spirits away and all that's been picked up through carnality and life and 2000 years of christianity let it all be washed away to all that's left is you and him let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this day father i pray and i trust lord that you know my heart you know the desire and the things that you laid on my heart to say god if i've said any of them wrong forgive me lord you know my heart and i don't want to i don't want to be too strong one way or too strong the other i don't i don't want to trouble anybody in their mind lord but i want to present your word the way you presented it to me i want to be faithful to the calling wherewith you called me and i want to speak the truth and love god i pray you take these words no matter how they were said i pray that you plant them correctly in the hearts of your people that you would keep us from religious spirits that you would keep us free from idolatry lord that we would never be guilty of taking something you've given for our benefit and allow it to be perverted to something else god keep us our focus centered on you god may we find our satisfaction in that quiet time in our relationship with you and the revelation you give to us personally may we be satisfied with the portion you've given us may we look forward to more of you may every other distraction be laid aside and every perversion of the devil be exposed may we come to a reality lord past all the fake past the pass the religiousness past everything and may we get to the reality lord the truth that you're trying to give to us in this day the restoration of a relationship between a bride and a bridegroom an invisible union a marriage a conception on the word and a bringing forth of the son of man may it all lord take place in us as individuals may we lay ourselves bare may we come to you in a real genuine way may we find you when we seek you with all of our hearts god i pray that you would touch your children should bring personal individual revelation to each one every young person who's been raised in this church or raised in the message i pray you come to them in an individual way lord that they would have an experience where they've connected with you and they know it lord that something inside of them would change in a way that they would know it lord that they would know that this is not mom and dad's religion anymore this is not we this is me i've received i believe god i pray you do it for each one every seed that's out there lord that has not come to a birth i pray lord that you would bring them to a new birth lord that you would quicken them to life that they would have that experience lord that will sustain them and carry them through lord we love you we thank you for this hour that we're alive you've been so merciful and so good to us you've made a way you've provided everything we need of to to come through to overcome you have called us the overcomers in this age you've already predestinated us to overcome you've already said that this bride wouldn't fall and for that we thank you lord help us to say surrendered to you into your word for you are the vine and we are the branches without you we can do nothing but lord if we can stay connected to you all of your life and all of your word and all of your promises can be made manifest through these branches i say god help us to stay connected and surrendered and let that life flow through us lord that it might bear the right fruit the right word the right light for this day we give you glory and honor we praise your name and ask you go with us guard our hearts keep us as a good bridegroom as our husband we lay our confidence in you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you listen
