[0:00] he called you to have fellowship with
[0:02] him he created you
[0:03] amen to for his purpose amen to yield
[0:06] yourself to him
[0:07] to walk in his presence to be yielded
[0:09] unto him to be sacrificed yourself unto
[0:12] him
[0:12] and be in a relationship with him that
[0:14] gives him the fellowship that he desires
[0:16] and through that walk he will do
[0:19] everything that he has promised that he
[0:20] will do in your life
[0:21] he has done everything that he has
[0:23] already determined that he will do in
[0:24] your life
[0:27] but i think sometimes we get so fixated
[0:29] on the outcomes
[0:31] and the fruit abraham for a period of
[0:34] time
[0:35] was fixated on producing a son because
[0:38] god said
[0:38] you'll produce a sign so now he had to
[0:41] produce a sign
[0:42] and that pressure got into sarah and
[0:43] then sarah thought of the a whole scheme
[0:45] of haggard
[0:46] and all of those things it all came from
[0:48] pressure to perform the word
[0:54] but god comes down and he takes all the
[0:56] pressure away and says i'll confirm the
[0:58] covenant
[0:58] i have said i have made you a father
[1:01] nation so now i will make you fruitful
[1:03] i am confirming my covenant you're not
[1:05] abraham you're not abram you're abraham
[1:07] i never promised to do this for abram i
[1:09] promise to do it for abraham
[1:12] and i never was going to do it for a
[1:14] church member amen i was never going to
[1:16] make a church member fruit florida
[1:17] nominational member
[1:18] or just another good person i was only
[1:21] going to do it for my bride
[1:22] so i've got to come down in a covenant
[1:24] and say why don't you just walk before
[1:26] me
[1:26] amen walk in my presence and be perfect
[1:28] i'm coming to confirm the word
[1:30] you're not a church member you're not a
[1:32] member of bcf amen you're not part of
[1:34] the message
[1:35] your bride
[1:40] because your bride i promise that
[1:43] through you will fulfill everything
[1:44] that's promised of the virgin in the
[1:46] last day
[1:47] so now i will make you have faith i will
[1:50] make you believe i will make you
[1:51] surrender i will make you yield
[1:56] praise be to god friends see this is why
[2:00] i love this message
[2:02] this message takes me and puts
[2:06] me in my flesh my my carnal being as
[2:08] helpless and hopeless it is and puts it
[2:10] in the right spot
[2:12] instead of trying to force that guy
[2:15] to be something it will never be it lets
[2:18] it be what it is
[2:19] hybrid lost amen in need of a total
[2:21] transformation
[2:23] [Music]
[2:24] and it allows the that attribute of god
[2:27] that's down in me that seed of god
[2:28] that allows that to be the true
[2:30] identification that identify with
[2:32] and it allows me to surrender to god and
[2:34] believe that all things are possible
[2:36] because i'm not looking at this anymore
[2:37] i'm looking down at this
