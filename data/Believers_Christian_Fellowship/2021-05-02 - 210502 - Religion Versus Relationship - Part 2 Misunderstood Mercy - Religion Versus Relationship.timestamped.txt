[0:28] [Music]
[0:39] amen praise the lord it's good to be
[0:42] with you this morning and while we're
[0:44] here together standing let's go ahead
[0:45] and take our bibles and turn to genesis
[0:47] chapter 3.
[0:51] i want to share a real brief testimony
[0:53] with you brother
[0:54] john kadima came around back just to
[0:56] share a testimony
[0:57] that comes from sister susanna bondo and
[1:00] she wanted him to share it because she
[1:01] doesn't speak english but
[1:03] apparently she i remember she came up a
[1:06] couple weeks ago to have prayer and
[1:07] there was something that
[1:08] she needed from the lord and she told
[1:11] brother
[1:12] jean to share with me to say that i told
[1:15] her
[1:16] i believe when we were down here i said
[1:17] stay focused on god
[1:19] and do not fear god will answer and she
[1:23] said as soon as her daughter was
[1:24] translating
[1:25] as soon as i said that she said the lord
[1:28] she heard a voice inside
[1:29] say that is thus saith the lord
[1:33] do not fear and keep focused on god and
[1:36] do not fear
[1:37] and she had a real serious situation
[1:39] we're seeking the lord for
[1:40] and god supernaturally absolutely this
[1:43] past
[1:44] week delivered her from that situation
[1:47] what an amazing god we serve amen it's
[1:50] exciting god can do what he wants
[1:52] amen when he wants he works individually
[1:55] and in the people that god is even using
[1:58] have no idea what's happening because
[2:00] it's not man it's god
[2:02] amen praise be to god
[2:06] i want to remind you also that we've got
[2:07] communion this
[2:09] afternoon we'll come back for that amen
[2:13] all right genesis chapter 3
[2:16] verse 6. we're going to continue on with
[2:19] religion
[2:20] versus relationship part two and the
[2:23] subtitle for this one is
[2:25] misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust
[2:30] misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust
[2:33] i told sister amy when i wrote down the
[2:36] title for her this morning i said i feel
[2:37] like a real preacher with a long title
[2:40] amen genesis chapter 3
[2:44] verse 6 and when the woman saw that the
[2:47] tree was good for food and that it was
[2:49] pleasant to the eyes
[2:50] and a tree to be desired to make one
[2:52] wise she took of the fruit thereof
[2:54] and did eat and gave also into her
[2:56] husband with her and he did eat
[2:58] and the eyes of them both were open and
[3:00] they knew that they were naked and they
[3:02] sewed fig leaves together
[3:03] and made themselves aprons and they
[3:06] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[3:08] in the garden in the cool of the day and
[3:10] adam
[3:10] and his wife hid themselves from the
[3:12] presence of the lord god amongst the
[3:14] trees of the garden
[3:15] and the lord god called unto adam and
[3:17] said unto him
[3:18] where art thou and he said i heard thy
[3:21] voice in the garden and i was afraid
[3:22] because
[3:23] i was naked and i hid myself
[3:26] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[3:30] lord jesus we thank you father
[3:32] that we can come like this once again
[3:35] for lord your grace and your mercy has
[3:36] brought us here you've sustained us
[3:39] you've given us life and health and
[3:41] strength to bring us back
[3:42] again to worship you and fellowship
[3:44] together around your word
[3:47] we pray god that you would have
[3:48] preeminence among us that you would
[3:50] speak
[3:50] and that we would hear that you would
[3:52] anoint the speaker and you would anoint
[3:54] our ears to hear
[3:56] god that you would give us a gift of
[3:58] revelation lord that we might see you
[4:00] in your word and we might see what it is
[4:02] you're doing in this day
[4:04] god that we might see your program and
[4:06] that we might enter in your program
[4:08] according to your will
[4:09] and then your program find you lord find
[4:12] relationship with you there
[4:14] we ask your blessings on everything
[4:15] that's said and done may you move among
[4:18] us lord in jesus name we pray
[4:20] amen you can all have your seats
[4:25] um i said we're continuing on with the
[4:27] same thought religion versus
[4:29] relationship
[4:30] we may be on it for some time i'm not
[4:32] really sure but there's just very very
[4:34] uh uh it's been very rich and very deep
[4:37] for me and there's a lot here that i'd
[4:38] like to share
[4:39] just as the lord leads because it's
[4:41] impossible when you come
[4:43] when something opens like like it did
[4:46] for me
[4:46] it's almost like god takes another layer
[4:48] off of the bible
[4:50] and you got to chase it through the
[4:51] whole bible and it becomes overwhelming
[4:53] because there's no way that
[4:55] that i can take what is in my heart by
[4:57] revelation
[4:58] and through the the fallacy the
[5:00] foolishness of preaching
[5:02] amen be able to take it exactly like
[5:05] it's in here and plant it in your heart
[5:06] the same way
[5:07] so there has to be the in the mediator
[5:09] of the holy ghost amen
[5:11] it's the only way that god can can do
[5:13] this because human language is so
[5:15] limited
[5:16] amen in human language cannot convey a
[5:19] revelation
[5:20] human language can only give the
[5:23] mechanism or the words or the
[5:24] information
[5:25] that god can take then and quicken to a
[5:28] revelation amen
[5:30] so we're dependent on god we see here
[5:33] that from the very beginning
[5:35] we know brother ham told us that that
[5:37] genesis is the seed
[5:38] chapter the seed book of the entire
[5:40] bible that everything that we find
[5:42] every cult every clan everything begin
[5:44] in genesis
[5:45] and the more that we study the word of
[5:47] god and the more revelation comes the
[5:49] more we realize
[5:50] that that prophet knew what he was
[5:52] talking about and we always believed it
[5:54] we always said yes that's true
[5:56] i mean we would we would never deny that
[5:58] we say it's true we believe it that's
[6:00] that's absolutely the truth but it's
[6:02] becoming more and more real more vivid
[6:04] more colorful more
[6:06] tangible that that prophet of god knew
[6:08] exactly what he was talking about
[6:10] amen even when he we made the statement
[6:12] he says uh
[6:14] somebody said you just don't know your
[6:15] bible somebody told him that brother
[6:18] you just don't know your bible he says
[6:20] yeah but i know the author real well
[6:22] and that becomes evident and apparent
[6:24] amen because the man
[6:26] and the man the human side would take a
[6:28] scripture and he wouldn't
[6:29] he could actually even misquote the
[6:32] scripture
[6:33] and maybe get the words jumbled or even
[6:35] the characters wrong
[6:37] and maybe get moses in place of noah or
[6:39] no we replace of moses
[6:40] and he could he can maybe even get the
[6:42] number of people
[6:43] that were killed or the events out of
[6:46] sequence i hope you understand what i'm
[6:48] saying
[6:50] but because he knew the author of the
[6:53] word he was
[6:54] always correct in what he was portrayed
[6:57] amen the point that he was driving the
[7:00] the goal that he had and what he was
[7:02] saying
[7:02] the truth that he was preaching was
[7:05] every time
[7:06] always correct even if he said moses
[7:08] instead of noah he was still correct
[7:12] not correct in a way of of making every
[7:15] word
[7:16] he said infallible that's not what i'm
[7:17] talking about brother ben would even go
[7:19] back and say i got that wrong i made a
[7:20] mistake
[7:21] amen so not every word that the prophet
[7:23] spoke was infallible
[7:25] but the truth that he was bringing was
[7:27] true amen
[7:28] it was the truth because he knew the
[7:29] author amen and when he knew the author
[7:31] he knew the intent he knew the mind
[7:33] behind the bible he knew what the bible
[7:35] was written for amen he knew what the
[7:37] mystery of the whole word was
[7:39] amen and when he says my bible has
[7:41] become a new book
[7:42] and he comes back and he begins
[7:43] preaching amen from that time on
[7:46] he's preaching the revelation the
[7:48] mystery of god amen
[7:50] and he's preaching the mystery of god
[7:52] revealed and he knows
[7:54] exactly what he's talking about
[7:58] god so i don't think any of us are
[8:00] foolish enough to believe that
[8:02] that that when brother branham when he
[8:04] actually said
[8:05] you know moses uh built the ark then now
[8:08] i'm going to say moses built the ark
[8:09] because the prophet said it
[8:10] come on
[8:14] come on and he said 700 didn't bow the
[8:18] knee to baal
[8:19] but then he come back said i was wrong
[8:21] and seventh down but because under the
[8:22] inspiration he said
[8:23] i'm going to say 700 from now on that
[8:26] that's that's a religious
[8:27] demon trying to move you off the word of
[8:30] god
[8:34] but the point was under that seal that
[8:36] was broken to elijah that day
[8:38] was a revelation of predestination and
[8:41] election
[8:41] that god had even though the prophet
[8:43] couldn't see god had those who had not
[8:45] bowed to need the baal
[8:47] and that's nothing but the truth
[8:51] so that prophet knew exactly what he's
[8:54] talking about
[8:56] amen and so that's why he makes these
[8:59] statements
[9:00] and as we go on the things that we've
[9:02] believed and the things that we've known
[9:04] to be true
[9:05] if i could say it this way they become
[9:07] more true
[9:08] i don't know if that's even makes any
[9:10] sense but but we begin to see it more
[9:13] clearly and in more color
[9:16] and in the beginning we see that
[9:20] the the devil began to anoint a vessel
[9:22] and that vessel was the serpent
[9:24] and the serpent was something that was
[9:26] similar to man but was not
[9:27] man and this is what the the devil is
[9:30] always doing he's always coming
[9:32] amen he's always getting to the closest
[9:34] thing he can to god
[9:36] and he uses the closest thing he can to
[9:39] what god
[9:39] uses and he uses it for deception
[9:43] does that make sense this is the way the
[9:44] devil is always working amen and so
[9:47] the closest angel to god amen was
[9:50] was lucifer and in that position as
[9:53] close as he get to god
[9:54] he begins to mimic god and mirror god
[9:57] through the closest thing that he can
[9:59] get to go on
[10:00] and what god's using and by that he
[10:03] brings a deception
[10:04] and so now god is using man he has set
[10:07] man up to be a reflection of his image
[10:09] and that reflection is now on the earth
[10:11] and he set him up to be a god on the
[10:12] earth
[10:13] amen and the closest thing to man was
[10:16] the serpent
[10:18] so now the devil comes in and he uses
[10:20] the closest thing to what god is using
[10:23] to bring deception and when he brings
[10:25] deception now
[10:26] he actually brings a hybridization and
[10:29] that hybridization
[10:30] actually allows and permits the devil to
[10:33] get
[10:34] closer because
[10:37] now it's all mixed together
[10:40] and through that integration and that
[10:42] mixing amen now
[10:44] he begins to weave his way in amen and
[10:48] he's working
[10:49] in parallel to where god is working
[10:53] i hope that that makes sense
[10:56] in the message conference brother bam
[11:00] said oh the
[11:01] hour the tremendous time that we're
[11:03] living
[11:04] when menace told her their error instead
[11:06] of trying to come back and say father
[11:08] i'm wrong forgive me
[11:09] they still hide behind the fig leaves
[11:12] fig leaves is what they sow together
[11:13] themselves
[11:15] and that the word religion means a
[11:16] covering and they try to make themselves
[11:19] a handmade covering and man hasn't
[11:22] changed yet today
[11:24] so in the fall when when when she did
[11:27] partake of the sin
[11:29] and gave him to her husband and he ate
[11:30] also then their eyes were open and they
[11:33] saw that they were naked and
[11:34] and they sewed themselves together fig
[11:36] leaves and made themselves aprons and we
[11:38] talked about this wednesday how they
[11:40] made a religion for themselves a
[11:43] religion means a covering
[11:45] and so now they're trying to cover their
[11:47] own sins
[11:48] or they're trying to re create their own
[11:50] atonement or if i could say the way
[11:52] brother graham said it they're trying to
[11:54] have
[11:54] a covering with no atonement there's no
[11:57] bloodshed there's nothing
[11:58] amen that will substitute for them amen
[12:01] to restore a relationship
[12:03] now what they've done is they've created
[12:04] a covering for their sin it's a man-made
[12:07] covering that they have made themselves
[12:09] and so what they're seeking is they're
[12:11] seeking an atonement or a covering
[12:13] without an atonement
[12:15] and this covering amen is not to bring
[12:18] him
[12:18] back in fellowship with god this is the
[12:20] shocking statement that i made last time
[12:22] but i still stand true
[12:24] to it that religion amen the purpose of
[12:26] religion because religion began
[12:28] amen right here with this with this fall
[12:31] amen men sowing fig leaves together it
[12:33] was propagated by cain it was carried
[12:35] out further by nimrod
[12:36] when we look at this kind of religion
[12:38] this man-made religion
[12:40] religion is not intended to bring man
[12:43] back into fellowship with god
[12:46] it's the the devil's purpose i mean in
[12:49] what's so deceptive
[12:50] if the devil sells it with the premise
[12:53] of this religion is intended to bring us
[12:56] back to god
[12:57] and then the religion is not intended to
[12:59] bring us back to god
[13:01] religion is intended to create a
[13:03] covering that will actually
[13:04] keep us from god it's the barrier to god
[13:08] and because the religion amen the
[13:10] religion is to bring a
[13:12] sense of security a false justification
[13:16] a false covering so under the religion
[13:19] you do not
[13:20] need god you need the religion because
[13:23] the religion becomes the covering
[13:30] because without religion you're naked
[13:35] and cain did not want to say adam did
[13:38] not want to face god
[13:40] naked amen so he made himself a covering
[13:44] and that covering amen he was somehow
[13:47] comfortable with the covering until he
[13:50] heard the voice of god
[13:51] come walking in the garden in the cool
[13:53] of the evening and when the
[13:54] when he then it says when he heard the
[13:57] voice
[13:58] he see he hid himself from the presence
[14:00] of god
[14:01] because the voice amen denotes his
[14:04] presence
[14:07] his voice denotes his presence
[14:11] and so when the voice he had to hide
[14:14] from that presence because when he heard
[14:17] the voice
[14:18] he knew he was naked but he was still
[14:21] had his fig leaves on he still was
[14:25] behind his religion
[14:27] amen which he felt comfortable with
[14:29] until he heard the voice
[14:31] because he wasn't hiding amen until he
[14:33] heard the voice
[14:34] when he heard the voice he began to hide
[14:36] so so
[14:37] he realized the voice amen the voice
[14:41] uncovered pierced through the religion
[14:43] and still left him bare and naked
[14:48] so god came to him and god amen now gave
[14:52] another kind of a covering
[14:53] and this covering was going to come by
[14:55] the shed blood of an innocent one
[14:57] a type of the coming of jesus christ he
[14:59] was going to offer a lamb and the blood
[15:01] of the lamb
[15:02] amen would atone for their sins and he
[15:04] would cover them
[15:06] amen with the with the remnants of the
[15:08] life of that lamb he would cover them in
[15:09] the garment made from the slain lamb
[15:12] and in covering them he would he would
[15:14] make a way
[15:16] to restore relationship and restore
[15:18] fellowship
[15:21] so god's provided way
[15:24] god's provided way is always the way of
[15:28] his word
[15:30] the word is always the path to the
[15:33] atonement
[15:34] and the purpose of the atonement is
[15:36] reconciliation with god
[15:40] without the word you cannot get to the
[15:43] blood
[15:44] brother branham said they say they're
[15:46] they're getting to the blood they're
[15:48] getting people to the blood but they've
[15:49] rejected the very path to the blood
[15:51] the word so without the word
[15:54] you cannot get to the blood without the
[15:56] blood there's no reconciliation of
[15:59] relationship
[16:00] [Music]
[16:01] so now you understand clearly what the
[16:04] purpose of relate
[16:05] religion is religion is to keep you
[16:08] from the word path to the atonement the
[16:11] religion is a false covering
[16:13] that will not restore relationship that
[16:15] the discovering
[16:17] is a barrier to relationship and a
[16:19] separation from atonement
[16:25] that's why when brother ben was
[16:26] preaching he finally gets to the point
[16:28] says
[16:28] now i understand why i've always been
[16:30] against the nominations
[16:33] the spirit in him was striking against
[16:35] it but then under the revelation he
[16:37] began to see what was behind it
[16:41] praise god so now
[16:44] god made a way of reconciliation
[16:48] and the message god hiding himself in
[16:50] simplicity he says in the beginning
[16:52] when man sinned it showed the nature of
[16:54] man he's always trying to hide from god
[16:56] and make himself a way
[16:58] that he can feel justified a religion
[17:01] that's been a religion means a covering
[17:03] so he tried to make his own religion
[17:06] and the message fellowship he says then
[17:08] god made a remedy for that
[17:09] in closing i might say this in the
[17:11] garden of eden when god saw that his
[17:13] children had sinned
[17:14] and had gone from him god himself who is
[17:16] the supreme judge
[17:18] made a reconciliation so he could
[17:20] restore that fellowship to his creatures
[17:23] by the shed blood of an animal and the
[17:26] shed blood lasted for many
[17:28] years speaking of the coming of christ
[17:31] so god so so god
[17:35] say it this way adam made a covering to
[17:38] hide himself from god
[17:41] or to hide his sin from god
[17:44] god exposed to sin and brought an
[17:48] atonement for the purpose of being
[17:51] reconciled back to fellowship with his
[17:53] creatures
[17:56] so the religion what we were saying
[17:58] wednesday
[17:59] that religion is an attempt
[18:03] to to to cover or hide
[18:07] ourselves from the judgment of god
[18:12] it's an attempt to keep ourselves from
[18:15] the judgment of god
[18:16] so we create our own covering that
[18:18] covers our sin
[18:19] so that now we don't need to pass
[18:22] through the fire of
[18:23] judgment and there's no reason to pass
[18:25] through the fire of judgment
[18:26] because now my sins are covered but
[18:29] they're covered by a religion or they
[18:31] are and the religion can be any form of
[18:34] religion i mean you just
[18:35] you can make up your own religion
[18:39] and under my religious order keeping my
[18:42] own religious order
[18:44] i now have a uh uh i'm now
[18:47] self-justified by my own
[18:49] actions so now i
[18:52] don't really i don't need god
[19:00] because through my actions and my my
[19:03] beliefs and my
[19:04] order i am now covered
[19:08] but then god is so gracious that in
[19:11] every age he has sent a voice
[19:15] and that voice he speaks of his denotes
[19:18] his presence amen and when it denotes
[19:20] his presence
[19:21] then it makes all the religion as
[19:23] nakedness
[19:24] and that is why the false vine always
[19:27] hated the true vine
[19:28] because when that true vine had the word
[19:30] of god they became the living voice in
[19:33] their day
[19:34] and when they became the living voice in
[19:36] their day it was
[19:37] it was showing the presence of god the
[19:39] presence of god
[19:40] was making bear naked totally uncovering
[19:44] everybody under the religious order in
[19:45] that day
[19:46] and then the religious order had to stop
[19:49] that voice
[19:49] amen and because they can't stop the
[19:51] word they try to destroy
[19:53] the vessel that is carrying the word
[19:57] and so now we begin to understand the
[20:00] whole bible
[20:02] this has been the whole bible
[20:05] so god's purpose
[20:09] in bringing his voice and his presence
[20:13] in the in in the face of sin
[20:16] is always to to
[20:20] uncover our false covering
[20:24] that's what the prophet of god did in
[20:26] this day he absolutely laid bare
[20:28] all the false coverings
[20:31] that's why the denominations at first
[20:33] liked him and then they hated him
[20:36] because at first in the beginning of his
[20:38] ministry
[20:39] oh friends this is going to get so good
[20:43] in the beginning of his ministry because
[20:45] of the camaraderie and the fellowship
[20:47] and the mighty signs and the mighty
[20:49] wonders and all the works
[20:50] amen the prophet of god originally and
[20:53] when he launched down into his ministry
[20:56] it looked as though he was justifying
[20:59] the denominations
[21:04] because of the mighty signs and the
[21:06] wonders and the works and the
[21:07] camaraderie and the fellowship
[21:09] amen it looked as if you know methodists
[21:11] were sponsoring baptists were sponsoring
[21:13] the catholics were even coming
[21:14] everybody was coming and rallying around
[21:16] this gift and god was doing mighty signs
[21:18] and wonders
[21:19] it looked as though it was a
[21:21] justification
[21:22] for the systems and all the systems
[21:25] embraced him
[21:29] but when he began to be the voice
[21:34] by sharing the revealed word then
[21:37] instead of justifying the systems he was
[21:40] laying it bare and making their system
[21:43] their nakedness
[21:46] and then they turned their opinion
[21:50] through the 50s they turned from loving
[21:54] this
[21:54] this man with this gift and accepting
[21:56] him to beginning to
[21:58] reject him and the more he was rejected
[22:00] the more of the voice that he spoke and
[22:02] the more the voice he spoke the more he
[22:04] was rejected
[22:07] because he was laying bare the systems
[22:12] in the message the super sign
[22:16] said adam he tried to make a super
[22:17] religion without an
[22:19] atonement they're still trying to do it
[22:21] a super religion make a religion so
[22:23] he could live any way he wanted to
[22:25] without an atonement
[22:26] and still have a covering he tried to do
[22:29] it in the beginning and he's still
[22:30] trying to do it
[22:32] but god's provided way was an atonement
[22:34] it will never work no other way it has
[22:36] to come back to an atonement
[22:39] and if you write down this word
[22:40] atonement
[22:42] if you have a piece of paper and a pen
[22:44] and you write down
[22:45] if you write down the word atonement a t
[22:50] o n e m e
[22:53] t atonement
[22:56] then draw a line between the t
[23:00] and the o
[23:03] and the e and the m
[23:08] you have a t line
[23:11] o n e line m e n t
[23:15] and what you have is at one
[23:18] mint that was god's desire
[23:22] with the blood sacrifice is at one
[23:25] meant that's the purpose of an atonement
[23:28] is to bring reconciliation
[23:30] at one minute with god and man
[23:33] when man cindy had to have an atonement
[23:35] to bring at
[23:36] one minute
[23:39] and so the religion does not bring
[23:42] atonement
[23:43] cannot bring atonement amen only the
[23:46] word can bring you
[23:47] to the atonement which is the price that
[23:49] was paid to bring a reconciliation back
[23:52] to god
[23:52] because god wanted atonement
[23:56] man wanted a covering god wanted
[23:58] atonements
[24:00] this is the difference between religion
[24:02] and relationship
[24:06] now let's look at genesis chapter four
[24:08] together let's just keep moving on
[24:14] i'm gonna there's a lot i want to say
[24:17] and there's a
[24:17] certain distance i want to get to but
[24:19] i'm not willing to skip over anything
[24:22] so we can preach wednesday and sunday
[24:26] and
[24:26] we'll just keep going because i just
[24:28] want to catch i want to pull
[24:29] all that god has for us out of this and
[24:31] i don't want to get in a hurry
[24:34] genesis chapter 4 verse 3
[24:37] and in process of time it came to pass
[24:39] that cain brought of the fruit of the
[24:40] ground and offering unto the lord
[24:42] and abel he also brought her the first
[24:44] things of his flock and of the fat
[24:45] thereof
[24:46] and the lord had respect and to able
[24:48] into his offering but unto cain and his
[24:50] offering
[24:50] he had not respect and cain was very
[24:53] roth and his countenance
[24:54] fell so we went through this last time
[24:57] i'm not going to go back through
[24:58] everything that we said but
[25:00] but brother says in the message
[25:02] indictment he says
[25:03] and that's the only place he meets with
[25:05] man today is under the shed blood
[25:08] that's what abel produced by faith with
[25:10] by faith abel
[25:11] offered a more excellent sacrifice amen
[25:14] and his in
[25:15] his gift testifying that he was
[25:16] righteous amen so
[25:18] the fact that he could by revelation
[25:20] bring the right gift he could only bring
[25:21] the right gift if he had the right
[25:23] revelation
[25:25] and faith is a revelation so by faith by
[25:27] revelation
[25:28] he offered a more excellent sacrifice
[25:30] and his works testifying that he was
[25:32] righteous
[25:33] amen he was righteous
[25:37] because he could believe
[25:40] he wasn't just righteous just because he
[25:43] could perform
[25:46] i hope he can catch this it wasn't just
[25:49] the performance or the
[25:51] act amen that made him righteous because
[25:53] he did the right thing
[25:54] he could only do the right thing when he
[25:57] had the revelation by faith
[26:00] so what proved his righteousness was his
[26:02] ability
[26:04] to receive revelation by faith
[26:07] [Music]
[26:09] so his works amen were an
[26:12] outcropping of his faith and they
[26:14] testified that he was righteous
[26:16] it wasn't it wasn't the works of his own
[26:19] mind
[26:20] it wasn't the works that he conjured up
[26:22] he didn't just do something that was a
[26:24] little bit nicer than what cain did
[26:27] what cain did was nicer than what abel
[26:29] did what cain did took more work more
[26:31] effort it was more beautiful
[26:32] what abel did was more some a simple
[26:34] more humble it was actually dirty and
[26:36] gruesome in many ways
[26:39] not appealing at all to the flesh amen
[26:41] so it's not that he he offered
[26:43] a more excellent sacrifice in the way
[26:45] that human reasoning would think he
[26:47] offered a more excellent sacrifice
[26:48] nobody with human reasoning and a human
[26:51] mind
[26:52] and carnality would look and say he
[26:54] offered a more excellent sacrifice
[26:55] what made it more excellent is he had
[26:58] caught the mind of god
[26:59] and what god wanted and god wanted
[27:02] atonement because god wanted fellowship
[27:04] with his children
[27:07] and he had caught the mind of god amen
[27:09] and that's why hebrews says without
[27:11] faith it is impossible to please him
[27:15] so he came without faith could not
[27:18] please god
[27:18] amen but abel by faith could please god
[27:22] and his in his in his offering his gift
[27:25] would testify
[27:26] that he was righteous he didn't become
[27:28] righteous by offering the gift
[27:31] he was righteous because he was of the
[27:34] seed of god
[27:36] and because he was of the seed of god he
[27:38] had the capacity to receive revelation
[27:42] and the revelation produced the right
[27:45] understanding
[27:46] on how to please god and when he pleased
[27:49] god
[27:50] his works testified that he was
[27:53] righteous
[27:56] praise god friends
[27:59] god is not looking down at us and we've
[28:02] not
[28:03] we're not bribed because we made the
[28:05] right choice
[28:08] we're not his bride because we've done
[28:10] the right works
[28:14] you've not become righteous
[28:17] because you realized i was doing wrong
[28:20] and now i'm going to start doing right
[28:21] and now that made me righteous
[28:26] you were bribed before the foundation of
[28:28] the world if you're elect a c gene
[28:30] of god you were chosen to be bribed
[28:31] before the foundation of the world
[28:34] and inside of you was a crystal
[28:38] brother behind said that could pick up
[28:40] on the waves moving through the air
[28:44] and you could somehow you were tuned in
[28:48] to a certain frequency already and when
[28:51] all of a sudden you came in contact with
[28:52] that wave as it moved through the
[28:54] revelation that came through the
[28:55] messenger in our day
[28:56] all of a sudden it hit the crystal you
[28:58] could pick it up and it said this is the
[29:00] way walk you in it
[29:02] and you could say amen and when you when
[29:04] you saw that by
[29:06] faith this is what god wants
[29:10] now you threw away everything you had
[29:12] before
[29:13] and you went running and embraced this
[29:15] truth and embracing this truth you found
[29:17] out what was pleasing to god but without
[29:20] faith it's impossible to please god
[29:22] and so now by faith by love
[29:25] you begin to do the things out of the
[29:27] word that god has showed us by
[29:29] revelation
[29:30] are the things he wants us to do amen
[29:32] why because you're
[29:34] righteous you're not
[29:37] trying to become righteous
[29:40] your works are testifying that you are
[29:42] righteous
[29:48] brother rem said we're back in
[29:50] indictment again
[29:52] i'll read the first sentence again
[29:53] that's the only place he meets with man
[29:54] today is under the shed blood of the
[29:56] sacrifice
[29:57] i don't care if you're methodist baptist
[29:59] presbyterian if you can
[30:01] forget your differences roman catholic
[30:03] whatever you might be and will come
[30:05] under the shed blood god will meet with
[30:07] man both of us there
[30:08] that's where we can all meet and
[30:10] fellowship on the same grounds but
[30:11] otherwise
[30:12] he will not meet just because you're a
[30:14] methodist he'll not meet just because
[30:15] you're
[30:16] a pentecostal he'll meet with you under
[30:18] one condition that's under the shed
[30:20] blood
[30:21] when your sins has been confessed and
[30:23] expelled in his presence
[30:24] then by the blood and the blood is
[30:26] always before him
[30:27] and therefore he only he only can see
[30:30] you through that shed blood
[30:31] and your whitest no when you've
[30:33] confessed your sins
[30:34] otherwise you're not there you cannot
[30:36] fellowship
[30:38] that's the reason that you don't see
[30:40] things happening in the churches
[30:41] they confess that they believe the blood
[30:44] but they reject the very plan to get to
[30:46] the blood
[30:47] the word and god in this day has given
[30:51] us
[30:51] his word and his word in this day is the
[30:54] path
[30:54] back to the blood because
[30:58] the blood the chemistry of the blood
[31:01] amen
[31:01] purchase redemption of all creation that
[31:04] exchange price was already paid
[31:06] and then it was paid at calvary but
[31:08] brother man said the chemistry of that
[31:10] blood
[31:11] went into back into the judean soil from
[31:13] whence it came
[31:14] that's what the prophet says so it's not
[31:18] that blood amen that you can get a fresh
[31:21] application of today that blood was shed
[31:23] and was the purchase price
[31:25] it was an exchange rate paid for the
[31:27] redemption of the word
[31:28] but now to come in contact with that
[31:30] blood amen is to come in contact with
[31:32] the life that was in that blood
[31:36] and the life that was in that blood was
[31:38] christ amen
[31:39] and that when the blood cell was split
[31:42] when it was spilled amen that life was
[31:44] released and now that life could come
[31:46] back into the believer
[31:47] and the only way to access that life
[31:50] is by the word because that's the life
[31:53] of the word
[31:55] so if we reject the word you can't get
[31:58] the life of the word
[31:59] rejecting the word
[32:02] so when we hear water baptism in jesus
[32:04] name and we reject
[32:06] that word how do you get to that life
[32:09] rejecting the word
[32:10] and that's the life of the word
[32:14] so god in his mercy he has made sure
[32:17] that he's had a voice
[32:18] amen in each age and each dispensation
[32:20] of time
[32:21] and that voice will give the word for
[32:23] that day
[32:24] and the word for that day is the path
[32:27] back in contact
[32:28] with the life of that word amen which
[32:30] will become an atonement for you
[32:32] and bring you back in reconciliation
[32:34] with god
[32:39] praise god luther came with the just
[32:42] shall live by faith
[32:43] that was the word of god and under that
[32:45] word of god when that word was lifted up
[32:48] it became a path back to reconciliation
[32:51] with god
[32:53] and in that day under that revival i
[32:55] mean people were awakening to the fact
[32:57] that
[32:58] that i'm justified by faith and they
[33:00] were moving back into a relationship
[33:02] with god
[33:03] amen so what did the devil do he said
[33:06] fallen name brother
[33:06] said fallen angels that had left their
[33:10] first estate
[33:11] amen what did they do they went into the
[33:14] lutheran church
[33:15] amen and they took and obscured that
[33:17] path back to god
[33:19] by making it a religion now
[33:25] so god raised up a wesley and wesley
[33:27] began to bring sanctification amen
[33:30] as a second work of grace and
[33:31] sanctification by the spirit
[33:33] and what he was doing is he was opening
[33:35] a path of reconciliation back to god
[33:37] where the children of god were coming
[33:39] back into fellowship with god
[33:41] by the word
[33:45] but then what happened fallen angels
[33:47] came in
[33:49] and they turned it into a religious form
[33:51] in a religious order
[33:53] and when they did now the whole purpose
[33:56] was to
[33:57] keep people from reconciliation under
[34:00] that word for their day
[34:01] not to bring them to reconciliation
[34:07] so they reject the very plan to get to
[34:09] the blood
[34:11] the word that's why the word being
[34:14] restored in our day
[34:15] is so critical the word brings the life
[34:21] until that seals were broken and opened
[34:24] under the
[34:25] the seventh church age messengers
[34:26] ministry the seventh angel
[34:28] amen the brotherhood the holy ghost was
[34:30] bound
[34:31] by these rivers and denominations
[34:35] he was bound the holy ghost is the life
[34:37] of christ amen
[34:38] it's the life of the word and the life
[34:40] of the word was bound because the word
[34:42] was limited by denominations
[34:46] so the limiting of the word amen was
[34:48] binding of the holy ghost but under the
[34:50] opening of the seals
[34:51] amen and now it's the holy ghost back in
[34:54] the church again
[34:55] because the full word is here the
[34:57] denominational veil has been rent
[34:59] amen the chains have been taken off amen
[35:01] and the word has been restored
[35:03] and it's a path back only this time it's
[35:05] not to partial life
[35:07] it's to the full life
[35:11] for what what's the purpose why were the
[35:14] seals open
[35:17] because you can't have a marriage
[35:20] without a reconciliation
[35:23] god can't marry a system
[35:27] he can't marry a denomination he can't
[35:30] marry
[35:30] amen he can't marry he can't unify he
[35:33] can't be united back to come back and
[35:35] fellowship
[35:36] until there has been an atonement amen
[35:39] and after an atonement then there can be
[35:41] a reconciliation
[35:42] amen in a unification back to god but in
[35:45] this day
[35:46] god did just he wasn't just restoring a
[35:49] deeper level
[35:50] of fellowship what he was trying to do
[35:52] was bring a union
[35:53] a marriage in order to bring this
[35:55] marriage he had to bring the fullness of
[35:57] his
[35:58] word to bring the fullness of his life
[36:00] so that there'll be a full atonement
[36:01] made for the children of god
[36:03] so that he can be married to you
[36:08] it was a path back a reconciliation
[36:14] a path to the atonement that's why
[36:17] brother branham said
[36:19] i believe it was an invisible union he
[36:21] said if you're standing with this word
[36:23] and own this word
[36:25] i'm trying to tell you where you're
[36:26] standing
[36:28] you're standing totally justified as if
[36:30] you've never
[36:31] done it in the first place now
[36:35] under that condition you don't need
[36:38] a religion you don't need a covering
[36:41] because
[36:41] under the revealed word of this day
[36:43] there was a door open in heaven
[36:45] a path back to reconciliation a
[36:48] unification of god and man
[36:50] that would not amen would not just bring
[36:53] another level of fellowship or a greater
[36:55] understanding of god
[36:56] it would actually bring a condition to
[36:58] where you have never done it in the
[36:59] first place
[37:00] it brings you back to the original
[37:02] intent god had in his mind
[37:06] it brings you to a virgin condition
[37:11] what for why was this path open because
[37:14] he
[37:14] he the heart purpose of god was to have
[37:17] a bride of his own choosing
[37:18] it's been the purpose from the very
[37:19] beginning he was shown to us all the way
[37:22] back in the creation in the garden of
[37:23] eden amen it was defiled it was broke so
[37:26] god could bring a restoration
[37:27] so he could portray all of his
[37:28] attributes of savior and the healer and
[37:31] deliver
[37:31] he wanted he wanted a people who would
[37:34] know him
[37:36] and so this this whole cycle of
[37:38] redemption
[37:39] has brought an understanding a full
[37:41] understanding of god
[37:42] but god is the one who wants
[37:44] reconciliation
[37:45] he's the supreme judge and when the
[37:47] supreme judge came down in eden
[37:50] the supreme judge now judged his
[37:52] children wrong
[37:53] but the supreme judge was also a father
[37:56] and the father
[37:57] brought an atonement so that he can
[37:58] reconcile the relationship
[38:01] but in our day at the opening of the
[38:02] seals we saw the white wigged one come
[38:05] down
[38:05] who is what the supreme judge of heaven
[38:08] and earth
[38:09] and the supreme judge of heaven and
[38:10] earth came down to
[38:12] judge denomination and religion and lay
[38:15] you naked amen but he came down
[38:18] he is the sacrificial lamb he is the
[38:21] word that bled for you and died for you
[38:22] he is the atonement he is your husband
[38:25] he is your bridegroom and now you're not
[38:27] believing in an atonement
[38:29] you're united with your atonement you
[38:32] are
[38:32] one with your atonement amen the word
[38:34] that bled for you
[38:36] is your bridegroom amen the reward that
[38:38] died for you and bled for you and atoned
[38:40] for you
[38:41] is also your bridegroom
[38:46] and so the supreme judges come down amen
[38:49] the supreme judge came down in eden
[38:52] to have fallen children to judge
[38:56] their religion to judge their heir
[38:59] but he provided an atonement
[39:04] an innocent life that would go in
[39:07] exchange for their life
[39:09] so he could bring back a restoration of
[39:12] fellowship
[39:14] but now in satan's eden the supreme
[39:16] judges come again
[39:18] it's another eden visitation
[39:21] we've had another eden visitation in
[39:23] this day
[39:24] when man has made his own coverings and
[39:26] coverings of every flavor and coverings
[39:28] of every style
[39:29] and coverings of every shape and size
[39:31] amen and he's come down
[39:32] as a voice in this day and what he's
[39:34] done is he's destroyed all coverings
[39:37] and made it naked and the supreme judge
[39:41] comes with the atonement
[39:46] which is the bleeding bloody word
[39:50] and he has a way to wash you from all
[39:53] the filth of these prostitutes
[39:56] which is what the religious order of the
[39:58] day
[39:59] of the world and how does he wash you
[40:01] from the religious prostitutes
[40:02] by the washing of the water of the word
[40:07] and he is the word so who's washing you
[40:11] your bridegroom
[40:15] who's perfecting your bridegroom who's
[40:17] cleansing your bridegroom
[40:18] who's atoning for your bridegroom amen
[40:20] what has happened he has come a supreme
[40:22] judge in this day
[40:23] amen to bring the path back to the
[40:25] atonement and he is the atonement
[40:29] to bring back fellowship
[40:33] what his purpose was from the beginning
[40:36] you see what a day we live
[40:38] in friends there's never been a day like
[40:40] this day
[40:44] oh praise god i feel like i can't even
[40:48] preach anymore
[40:50] that's enough friends that's enough
[40:53] to sustain us for for everything that's
[40:55] it that's the whole picture that's the
[40:56] whole
[40:57] that's what's happened in our day that's
[40:59] the whole thing
[41:01] you're free you're absolutely free
[41:03] you're as free as any human being has
[41:05] ever been before
[41:06] the only thing you're waiting for is for
[41:08] the last one to come in so your atoms
[41:10] can change amen
[41:11] but you're free you've been freed by the
[41:13] supreme judge
[41:15] you've been freed by the presence of of
[41:17] the one who atoned for you the atonement
[41:19] himself the bleeding word
[41:24] free from the filth of the prostitutes
[41:26] free from the ideas of men
[41:28] free from everything that would separate
[41:30] you from fellowship with god
[41:32] and by that atonement he's brought you
[41:34] back into your ought to be conditioned
[41:40] you're just waiting for your body to
[41:41] catch up
[41:45] he says and three kinds of believers
[41:50] i'm still reviewing from wednesday
[41:54] three kinds of believers now look god
[41:57] had testified the bible said hebrews the
[41:59] fourth chapter the 11th chapter god
[42:00] testifying of his gifts
[42:02] that he was righteous god vindicated his
[42:04] offering
[42:05] god made proof that that was what he
[42:07] accepted he's speaking of abel now
[42:09] that was his word his plan
[42:12] so god when he testified of abel's
[42:15] offering
[42:16] what he was is abel had found the word
[42:18] for his day
[42:19] and when he found the word he found the
[42:21] way back to reconciliation
[42:23] and god was testify that he found the
[42:25] word
[42:27] and and the word is his plan
[42:30] and told cain do the same thing and live
[42:32] but do you think that he would
[42:34] forfeit his idea no sir
[42:38] see that's why the apostle paul said and
[42:41] the way it is considered heresy
[42:43] worship by the god of my fathers it has
[42:46] to look and be in such a way
[42:48] that it's so not appealing to the
[42:52] unbeliever it's so not appealing
[42:54] to cain's line or to the false vine that
[42:56] they don't want anything to do with it
[42:57] and even when they when cain in mercy is
[43:00] given an
[43:00] opportunity just to repeat the process
[43:02] without faith
[43:06] without faith he is given the
[43:08] opportunity to repeat the process
[43:10] but because he doesn't have no faith he
[43:12] doesn't have a love for god
[43:13] amen he doesn't have the seed of god he
[43:15] won't give up his idea
[43:17] even to repeat the process
[43:21] and because god always brings man to a
[43:24] warning before he brings in the judgment
[43:26] and he gave cain a warning and when cain
[43:28] failed he brought him to judgment
[43:32] so now i would i want to continue on i
[43:35] don't want to get hung up but
[43:37] the god of this evil age notice what he
[43:39] will do
[43:40] his thoughts he thought god dwelt in
[43:42] worldly beauty
[43:44] he did that in heaven said never began
[43:45] the garden of eden it began in heaven
[43:47] when lucifer the son of the morning
[43:50] exalted himself in beauty and wanted a
[43:51] more beautiful kingdom than that of
[43:53] michael
[43:54] and he thought that god dwelt in beauty
[43:56] and notice cain
[43:57] he didn't want no blood sacrifice he
[43:59] came down and offered the fruit
[44:00] or the fields of beauty upon his altar
[44:03] very religious
[44:04] done everything that just exactly like
[44:06] abel done offered a sacrifice
[44:08] fell down before god in worship obedient
[44:10] in every way
[44:11] but without the revelation of the word
[44:15] he was obedient in every way except the
[44:18] revelation of the word
[44:20] he couldn't go by revelation
[44:23] and the word was from the beginning
[44:26] god's plan
[44:28] so what was his plan from the beginning
[44:30] the word
[44:33] the word was from the beginning god's
[44:35] plan and if
[44:36] if you could just hang this in your mind
[44:39] for a minute and let's explore this for
[44:40] just a minute
[44:41] from the beginning god's plan was the
[44:43] word what was his plan his plan of
[44:45] reconciliation his plan of redemption
[44:46] his plan of salvation
[44:49] was always the word and that way when
[44:52] god now would begin to save
[44:55] from the save his children amen from the
[44:58] destruction of the world
[44:59] he would bring a word to a prophet he
[45:02] would bring it to noah
[45:03] and no one now would be a preacher of
[45:05] righteousness testifying of that word
[45:07] and that word became the way of
[45:10] salvation
[45:12] noah's ark in his day
[45:15] that word was the plan of salvation
[45:20] because i i want us to catch this
[45:22] because if
[45:23] you'll catch it it'll it'll expose the
[45:26] fallacy of denominations
[45:29] because the denominations are looking
[45:31] back to a previous day
[45:32] to a previous dispensation and they're
[45:35] looking back and accepting what is
[45:37] true and what is right amen but because
[45:39] they refuse the word for this day
[45:42] amen they don't get any benefit from
[45:44] what god did before
[45:47] so they're looking back amen and we find
[45:50] out in moses's day
[45:51] amen the word was always the plan so the
[45:54] word came to moses and moses came and
[45:57] brought the word
[45:58] and this word was a fulfillment of a
[46:00] prophecy given to abraham
[46:01] and under that dispensation in that day
[46:04] of a word
[46:05] through moses there was going to be amen
[46:07] an
[46:08] exodus out of egypt the salvation a
[46:10] restoration
[46:11] back into the land it was going to be
[46:13] god's plan god's plan is always the word
[46:16] he always sends the word and by the word
[46:18] he executes his plan
[46:21] and outside of that word that is sent
[46:23] for that day
[46:25] it is impossible for you to be in the
[46:27] plan of god
[46:28] because his word was his plan from the
[46:30] beginning
[46:31] so people want to have a redemption and
[46:33] they want to have a salvation
[46:35] without the word but it was the word
[46:39] that bled for you the word was made
[46:41] flesh
[46:43] jesus christ when he came on earth it
[46:45] was the word made flash
[46:47] and that word made flesh was a word that
[46:50] bled for you
[46:51] a word that died for you the atonement
[46:53] was the bleeding word
[46:57] so now now the link to that atonement to
[47:01] a bleeding word
[47:02] is to receive the word in your day
[47:04] because it's the same one it's the same
[47:07] person who bled for you and died for you
[47:10] it's christ the revealed word of god
[47:13] so in your day now moses was the plan in
[47:16] that day
[47:18] amen then then david became the plan in
[47:20] his day
[47:21] and all the prophets were the plan in
[47:23] their day and jesus christ was the plan
[47:25] in his day
[47:26] amen do you see what i'm saying the word
[47:28] for that day was always god's plan
[47:31] [Music]
[47:33] luther's message was the plan in that
[47:34] day wesley's message was to plan
[47:36] on that day the pentecostal message was
[47:38] the plan in that day
[47:42] and so we we have sometimes individuals
[47:45] who want the benefit of the word
[47:49] without the person of the word
[47:54] and the person of the word is the i am
[47:58] and the i am is the present tense god
[48:01] and the present tense god
[48:03] is the person amen and how can you have
[48:05] the benefit of the word
[48:07] and reject the person
[48:12] so the word has always been god's plan
[48:16] let me read this again this out of the
[48:17] god of this evil age the word was from
[48:19] the beginning
[48:20] god's plan but god revealed by
[48:22] revelation
[48:24] the very thing that he vindicated and
[48:26] punctuated
[48:27] that that was right not religion
[48:30] not an altar not belonging to church not
[48:33] making a sacrifice
[48:35] not being sincere but by the revelation
[48:38] of the word of god
[48:40] that was god's plan
[48:43] not by all of those works there's
[48:46] nothing wrong with those works amen
[48:48] those works are an outcropping of faith
[48:50] amen but without faith the works are
[48:52] dead
[48:56] not religion i want to read it again not
[48:58] an altar not belonging to church not
[49:00] making a sacrifice
[49:01] not being sincere but by the revelation
[49:04] of the word of god so my brother ben
[49:06] said above all else pray
[49:08] for revelation
[49:12] let's look at genesis chapter 4 verse 8
[49:14] again
[49:18] and cain talked with abel his brother
[49:20] and it came to pass
[49:21] when they were in the field that cain
[49:23] rose up against abel
[49:25] his brother and slew him from here last
[49:28] time we went to first
[49:30] john 3 11 and i'll read that same
[49:31] passage for you it says for this
[49:33] is the message that you have heard from
[49:34] the beginning that we should love one
[49:36] another
[49:37] not as cain who was of that wicked one
[49:39] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[49:41] he him
[49:41] because his own works were evil and his
[49:44] brothers
[49:45] righteous marvel not my brethren
[49:49] if the world hates you now
[49:53] he slew his brother why did he slay his
[49:55] brother because his own works were evil
[49:58] and his brothers were righteous and his
[50:00] brother's
[50:01] faith was declaring his righteousness
[50:06] and cain's lack of faith amen
[50:09] produced evil works and and listen the
[50:12] hebrew says by faith abel offered a more
[50:15] excellent sacrifice
[50:17] it didn't mean that cain didn't offer an
[50:19] excellent sacrifice
[50:21] because the sacrifice that cain brought
[50:23] would be would would actually be
[50:24] established by moses
[50:26] as the offering of first fruits
[50:29] so he brought the offering of first
[50:31] fruits which was going to be under the
[50:33] law under moses law
[50:34] an offering and a commandment amen to
[50:36] bring that offering to god so it wasn't
[50:38] the offering
[50:40] that was evil so what did cain do what
[50:44] was his works that was so
[50:45] evil amen because you know he made this
[50:48] he built an altar he made a beautiful
[50:49] sacrifice he knelt down and worshiped
[50:52] god
[50:54] but he could not operate by faith
[50:57] everything he did was for his own
[50:58] purpose by his own choosing by his own
[51:01] reasoning
[51:01] and declared all of his works to be evil
[51:06] and abel's were righteous because abel's
[51:08] were done by faith
[51:12] now all of a sudden all the religious
[51:14] orders and
[51:15] all the good things and and all the nice
[51:17] to your neighbor stuff and all that
[51:19] brother man said no fault against it
[51:21] that's fine nothing wrong with it
[51:23] but without revelation it just comes
[51:26] back to being evil works
[51:29] what do you mean build a hospital and
[51:31] and feed the poor and
[51:33] and send books to missionaries that's
[51:35] all evil works
[51:36] it's evil when it becomes a covering
[51:38] that separates you from the path back to
[51:40] the true atonement
[51:42] when it's the intellect of man amen
[51:44] producing a works that makes him feel
[51:47] justified because he's keeping an order
[51:49] of a church
[51:51] and because he's keeping the order of a
[51:53] church amen
[51:54] and he feels like this is his covering
[51:56] amen all of those works become
[51:59] evil because all of those works are
[52:01] reinforcing the same
[52:03] false message that without revelation
[52:06] you're fine
[52:10] so it's not feeding the poor as evil but
[52:13] feeding the poor believing that somehow
[52:15] it is atoning for you and making you
[52:17] right with god is evil
[52:24] oh i hope it goes down deep
[52:28] and i hope we don't leave it out there
[52:32] because we can come into a religious
[52:34] order called the message
[52:39] when luther brought a revelation what
[52:41] followed
[52:43] false angels fallen angels got in
[52:47] to take the truth and make a religious
[52:50] order out of it
[52:53] to make a religion wesley same thing
[52:56] pentecostal same thing
[52:58] and don't think just because you say
[53:00] message that all those demons are afraid
[53:02] and run away
[53:06] in the beginning lucifer the satan came
[53:10] to the closest thing he could find
[53:14] to where god was working
[53:18] and he began to work through the closest
[53:19] thing until he brought a hybridization
[53:21] and now he could twist the two vines
[53:26] together
[53:30] so you can say baptist is wrong all you
[53:32] want
[53:34] but the deception has to be so close it
[53:36] would deceive the very elect
[53:38] if possible so the deception has to be
[53:41] all around the bride
[53:43] not in the bride she's not going to be
[53:47] deceived she's predestinated not to be
[53:48] this time
[53:50] but all around and that's why we could
[53:53] have religious orders in keeping an
[53:55] order of a church
[53:57] and and you know there's a certain order
[53:59] that comes to the word of god even abel
[54:01] abel he had to offer a sacrifice that
[54:04] was in order the church and his faith
[54:06] amen his faith is what moved him into
[54:09] action
[54:10] amen in his offering testified he was
[54:11] righteous he couldn't just believe
[54:13] his believing put him in action and he
[54:15] had to offer the lamb
[54:18] and our faith in the message of the hour
[54:20] puts us in the works
[54:21] and by faith in the message of the hour
[54:23] recognizing the word
[54:24] amen it begins to produce a work in us
[54:27] to where now we clean up the outside we
[54:29] don't dress like we used to dress
[54:30] we don't we don't cut our hair we don't
[54:32] wear makeup we don't watch the movies we
[54:34] don't
[54:34] go to the places of entertainment we
[54:36] don't tell the same jokes we don't
[54:37] believe the same false doctrines
[54:41] because abel by faith he still
[54:44] he believed but he still had to offer
[54:46] the sacrifice because that's what the
[54:48] word was for his day
[54:51] i hope you understand so there is an
[54:54] order of worship that still remains
[54:57] but that order of worship is by faith
[55:02] a woman should not cut her hair by faith
[55:07] she should not wear revealing clothes by
[55:09] faith
[55:10] a man should not watch worldly
[55:12] entertainment or tell their by faith
[55:16] it's an outcropping that he believes
[55:18] this is the word of god i see it in the
[55:19] word i believe it this is what god wants
[55:21] and i want to do it
[55:24] and then he receives a power in him and
[55:26] that power in him begins to do it
[55:35] you can have somebody come into a group
[55:38] of believers
[55:41] come into a church and they can
[55:44] see the order
[55:47] they can see don't cut your hair
[55:50] and there's a certain reasonability to
[55:52] that
[55:53] and you can reason the word and a
[55:56] certain modesty
[55:57] and a certain staying away from the
[55:59] world and
[56:03] and you could have somebody
[56:06] that can come into the order of the
[56:09] message
[56:12] and not come into christ
[56:20] i'm trying to be so careful how i say
[56:22] this
[56:24] because the truth is a razor's edge
[56:27] between right and wrong so i'm trying to
[56:30] be super careful so if you just allow me
[56:32] to be careful
[56:36] that's why it's dangerous
[56:42] oh how am i going to say this
[56:46] it can be dangerous to start saying
[56:52] i go to a message church
[56:56] now that term in itself is not evil i
[56:59] mean it's not wrong don't get scared if
[57:00] you say that this
[57:03] but the mentality that can follow
[57:06] [Music]
[57:08] can become very dangerous
[57:12] as if if i go to the right church and do
[57:15] the right things
[57:16] i will be right
[57:21] and this goes for every church
[57:26] so it becomes dangerous to say i go to a
[57:28] message church
[57:32] and it also becomes dangerous to say
[57:35] it can become dangerous to say i'm in
[57:37] the message
[57:38] depending on what you mean by saying i'm
[57:40] in the message
[57:43] because the message is christ so if that
[57:44] means i'm in christ you're fine
[57:48] but if i come into the message and i've
[57:50] come into a
[57:52] order of beliefs in a certain number of
[57:55] doctrines
[58:01] and then all of a sudden that becomes my
[58:04] new covering
[58:10] this is why god doesn't have
[58:11] grandchildren
[58:15] you're not raised in the message
[58:20] the message is christ how do you get
[58:22] into the message how do you get into
[58:23] christ
[58:23] by new birth not by natural birth to
[58:27] parents who
[58:28] are in christ
[58:32] so the terminology and now don't be
[58:35] don't be like when i'm around brother
[58:36] chad i can't say they go to a message
[58:37] church
[58:39] i don't care about the terminology i'm
[58:41] just telling you that it can begin
[58:43] after generations and after time to
[58:45] bring a mentality
[58:47] and that mentality is wrong
[58:51] [Music]
[58:55] i've had people say you know i had one
[58:57] minister say to me one time one pastor
[58:59] says
[59:00] you know sometimes i have people leave
[59:01] the church but as long as they go to
[59:03] another message church i'm fine with
[59:04] that
[59:06] and i agreed with him i said yeah i feel
[59:08] the same way
[59:11] but even that mentality
[59:14] that verbiage if it doesn't carry the
[59:16] right revelation
[59:19] can become dangerous because now all
[59:22] we've done is moved our letter from one
[59:24] baptist church to another baptist earth
[59:26] but i'm still part of the baptist church
[59:37] what we need is an experience with jesus
[59:40] christ himself
[59:42] and we need an individual revelation
[59:45] like abel
[59:46] god and that revelation will give us an
[59:48] open eye that said
[59:49] this is truth this is god this is the
[59:52] atonement
[59:53] this is what cleans me
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:56] not my ability to recognize that this is
[59:59] probably right and my fear of being
[1:00:01] wrong that sticks me with
[1:00:02] a certain set of beliefs
[1:00:11] what we need is to get into christ
[1:00:17] it was hard to be more closely
[1:00:19] associated and aligned with jesus christ
[1:00:22] than for judas iscariot
[1:00:26] who tell me who who was
[1:00:29] closer to him and more closely aligned
[1:00:32] to him in his earthly ministry
[1:00:34] than judas iscariot
[1:00:38] but it did not equal salvation for judas
[1:00:41] iscariot
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:43] because he had no predestinated seed and
[1:00:45] when it come to the end
[1:00:47] he could believe almost everything but
[1:00:49] when it come to the end he just couldn't
[1:00:50] accept that man being god
[1:00:57] sometimes close association is dangerous
[1:01:03] being close to the truth sometimes can
[1:01:05] be more dangerous than being far away
[1:01:08] from
[1:01:11] oh god help us i hope you catch the
[1:01:14] heart of what i'm saying
[1:01:17] i'm trying so hard to not inject myself
[1:01:23] let's go to genesis chapter 4.
[1:01:26] still many many things we want to share
[1:01:29] genesis chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:01:36] and the lord god said king unto cain
[1:01:39] where is
[1:01:40] abel thy brother
[1:01:43] where is abel thy brother and he said i
[1:01:46] know not am i my brother's keeper
[1:01:48] and he said what hast thou done the
[1:01:49] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[1:01:51] me
[1:01:52] from the ground and now art thou cursed
[1:01:54] from the earth
[1:01:55] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[1:01:57] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[1:02:00] when thou tilt us to ground it shall not
[1:02:02] henceforth yield unto thee her strength
[1:02:04] a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be
[1:02:06] in the earth
[1:02:07] and cain said unto the lord my
[1:02:08] punishment is greater than i can bear
[1:02:11] behold thou has driven me out this day
[1:02:13] from the face of the earth and from thy
[1:02:15] face shall i be hid
[1:02:16] and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[1:02:18] in the earth and it shall come to pass
[1:02:20] that every one that findeth me shall
[1:02:22] slay me
[1:02:24] and the lord said unto him therefore
[1:02:27] whosoever slayeth came vengeance shall
[1:02:29] be taken on him sevenfold
[1:02:31] and the lord set a mark upon cain lest
[1:02:33] any finding him should kill him
[1:02:35] and cain went out from the presence of
[1:02:37] the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on
[1:02:38] the east of eden
[1:02:40] and cain knew his wife and she conceived
[1:02:42] and bear enoch
[1:02:43] and he builded a city and called the
[1:02:45] name of the city after the name of his
[1:02:47] son
[1:02:48] enoch now i know we read the scripture
[1:02:50] before but i didn't get to go into it
[1:02:51] the way i would
[1:02:52] i i would like to today
[1:02:55] cain he refused to take god's act of
[1:02:59] mercy
[1:03:00] and god and mercy said just do as thy
[1:03:02] brother just just if you do well want to
[1:03:04] be well with thee and
[1:03:05] and and and he refused that and then
[1:03:09] in the conversation with abel he rose up
[1:03:11] and he slew his brother and then
[1:03:12] he confronted god and god he lied right
[1:03:16] to god's face where's thy brother he
[1:03:18] said i know not am i my brother's keeper
[1:03:21] he did a pretty bad job of keeping him
[1:03:24] he had just killed him
[1:03:27] and god now says you're going to be
[1:03:28] cursed you're cursed
[1:03:31] you'll be sent off in the face of the
[1:03:32] earth you're going to be sent out from
[1:03:35] sent out and you're going to be a
[1:03:36] fugitive and a vagabond
[1:03:39] and i'm going to look at this word
[1:03:40] fugitive in vagabond
[1:03:42] the word fugitive means to quiver
[1:03:45] totter shake reel stagger
[1:03:48] wander move sift uh
[1:03:52] wave or tremble so
[1:03:55] the whole the whole essence of this word
[1:03:58] fugitive
[1:03:59] is instability
[1:04:03] tremble waver wave wonder
[1:04:06] instability and
[1:04:09] and i would i would say it this way just
[1:04:11] because it serves my purpose
[1:04:14] a lack of stability
[1:04:18] and a lack of security
[1:04:21] okay oh because so god says you're going
[1:04:24] to be a fugitive in a vagabond
[1:04:26] so that's fugitive a vagabond is a very
[1:04:29] similar word
[1:04:30] image to shake to waver to wander to
[1:04:33] move to and fro
[1:04:36] it meant to move to and fro to wander
[1:04:38] aimlessly
[1:04:40] so god says you're going to be trembling
[1:04:43] and shaking and faltering
[1:04:45] and you're going to be wondering
[1:04:49] and so that is the curse that is given
[1:04:54] upon cain and cain does not think
[1:04:57] that this is a fair curse in
[1:05:01] in verse 13 and cain said unto the lord
[1:05:02] my punishment is greater than i can bear
[1:05:05] this man has no sense of who god is
[1:05:10] he has absolutely no respect for the
[1:05:13] supreme judge
[1:05:16] he's looking at him saying my punishment
[1:05:18] as if
[1:05:19] god is unjust as if god is not
[1:05:22] not fair as if god somehow has made a
[1:05:25] mistake in an inappropriate judgment of
[1:05:27] cain
[1:05:28] and cain is so exalted within himself
[1:05:31] because he has the spirit of lucifer
[1:05:33] within him he is so exalted within
[1:05:36] himself
[1:05:36] that he believes that he can tell god
[1:05:39] you're unjust and you're unfair
[1:05:42] and cain in making a statement like that
[1:05:46] is trying to put himself on an equal
[1:05:48] basis with god
[1:05:51] because god is the supreme judge he
[1:05:54] knows best
[1:05:55] if god says you know if god looks at you
[1:05:57] and says you're a purple monkey you say
[1:05:59] i'm a purple monkey
[1:06:02] who are you to rile against god who are
[1:06:05] you to say that god is wrong
[1:06:06] who are you to say that his word somehow
[1:06:08] has faltered or failed
[1:06:10] and his judgment is incorrect but this
[1:06:13] is cain's mentality amen
[1:06:15] he's so exalted and so bright with his
[1:06:17] deceit in his own brightness
[1:06:19] that he believes that that this is not
[1:06:21] fair
[1:06:23] and then just follow that thought my
[1:06:25] punishment is greater than i can bear
[1:06:27] behold thou has driven me out this day
[1:06:29] from the face of the earth
[1:06:30] and from thy face shall i be hid and i
[1:06:33] shall be a fugitive and a
[1:06:35] vagabond in the earth he repeats the
[1:06:36] statement that god made
[1:06:39] and it shall come to pass that every one
[1:06:41] that findeth me
[1:06:42] shall slay me now like we said wednesday
[1:06:46] cain was not so much worried
[1:06:50] he was not heartbroken that he was
[1:06:51] leaving the presence of god
[1:06:55] because he was not worried about
[1:06:57] reconciliation because he didn't desire
[1:06:59] the atonement even when he was given an
[1:07:01] opportunity to reconcile he rejected the
[1:07:03] reconciliation
[1:07:04] because the only way to reconciliation
[1:07:06] was through self-judgment
[1:07:09] through humility through needing
[1:07:12] god and cain
[1:07:16] did not want to need god
[1:07:19] and he did not want to humble himself
[1:07:21] and he did not want to omit
[1:07:23] what kind of condition he was in
[1:07:27] so now he says i'll be sent out of your
[1:07:30] presence
[1:07:31] and here's the part that he's really
[1:07:32] worried about
[1:07:34] and whoever finds me will slay me
[1:07:38] i won't get to continue with my plans
[1:07:42] my goals my objectives my life
[1:07:47] he was going to live a life without the
[1:07:50] presence of god
[1:07:52] and he wanted to preserve that
[1:07:55] yes life right this is religion
[1:07:59] this is the heart of religion
[1:08:03] now listen what's said next this is so
[1:08:05] important
[1:08:06] and the lord said unto him therefore
[1:08:08] whosoever slave cain vengeance shall be
[1:08:10] taken on him
[1:08:12] sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon
[1:08:14] cain this is the mark of the beast
[1:08:17] lest any finding him should kill him
[1:08:20] and cain went out from the presence of
[1:08:22] the lord which he was fine with
[1:08:25] and dwell in the land of not on the east
[1:08:26] of eden and cain knew his wife
[1:08:29] and she conceived and bear enoch and he
[1:08:31] builded a city
[1:08:33] and called the name of the city after
[1:08:35] the name of a son enoch
[1:08:37] now here's really what i want to drive
[1:08:38] into because my subtitle
[1:08:40] was titled misunderstood mercy
[1:08:46] cain is told by god you're going to be
[1:08:50] a fugitive in a vagabond
[1:08:53] and cain repeats it this is not fair for
[1:08:56] i will be sent out from the face of the
[1:08:57] earth and from thy presence and i will
[1:08:58] be a fugitive of the vagabond
[1:09:00] and whoever finds me will slay me and so
[1:09:03] if you just follow with me it looks as
[1:09:06] if
[1:09:07] god yielded to cain
[1:09:11] it looks as if god yielded to cain's
[1:09:14] wisdom
[1:09:17] because he says no
[1:09:20] no i won't let that happen it's as if
[1:09:23] god said
[1:09:24] you're right
[1:09:27] i whoever slays cain i will take
[1:09:30] vengeance on him sevenfold
[1:09:32] and he put a mark and the mark of the
[1:09:35] beast
[1:09:36] was to protect cain
[1:09:42] because cain was going to still serve
[1:09:43] god's purpose
[1:09:46] so he put a mark on him and with cain's
[1:09:50] understanding the mark
[1:09:54] was his protection
[1:10:00] oh now you see the world council of
[1:10:03] churches and the mark of the beast
[1:10:04] it's going to believe that the mark is
[1:10:06] the protection
[1:10:09] it'll be believed by the false vine that
[1:10:11] the mark of the beast
[1:10:15] is going to be their protection amen to
[1:10:18] believe this false system and unify
[1:10:19] under this false system of world
[1:10:21] religions
[1:10:21] will actually be a protection
[1:10:26] when brother vance said everything
[1:10:27] started in genesis he was absolutely
[1:10:29] right it
[1:10:30] all started right here friends so the
[1:10:32] mark that god put on him
[1:10:34] and cain you have to think like cain and
[1:10:36] cain cain just protested to god this is
[1:10:38] not fair this will happen this will
[1:10:39] happen this will happen
[1:10:40] and whoever will fire me will slay me
[1:10:41] and god says i'm not going to let that
[1:10:43] happen
[1:10:43] amen whoever slays thee i'll take
[1:10:45] vengeance on them now he's standing up
[1:10:47] for cain
[1:10:48] and now he puts a mark on cain to
[1:10:50] protect cain
[1:10:53] and then cain goes out and he has any
[1:10:56] any any
[1:10:57] and he has uh a son and then he buildeth
[1:11:01] the city
[1:11:02] in this term to build at first he goes
[1:11:06] to the land of nod and nod means
[1:11:07] wondering
[1:11:09] so he's a fugitive he's unstable him and
[1:11:12] no security
[1:11:13] he's he's a vagabond he has no stability
[1:11:16] amen he's a wandering and he goes to the
[1:11:18] land of wandering
[1:11:19] and in the land of wandering amen
[1:11:22] he he has a son and he builds a city
[1:11:27] and it said uh
[1:11:30] let me read this again and cain knew his
[1:11:34] wife and she
[1:11:34] verse 17 and conceived and bear enoch
[1:11:36] and he builded a city
[1:11:39] this word builded means to establish
[1:11:43] to cause to continue
[1:11:47] cain is working in his own intellect and
[1:11:51] reasoning
[1:11:52] opposite to the judgment of god
[1:11:56] because god says you'll be a fugitive
[1:11:58] wandering waving
[1:12:00] teetering tottering and a vagabond
[1:12:02] moving to and fro
[1:12:06] and cain protested all of that
[1:12:09] got god to stand up for him and give him
[1:12:12] protection
[1:12:14] and then he went out and he established
[1:12:18] us he builded a city
[1:12:19] to build means to establish our cost to
[1:12:23] continue
[1:12:24] and now what he's doing is the opposite
[1:12:27] of what god said would happen to him
[1:12:36] i i hope this i hope what i'm saying
[1:12:39] begins to sink in
[1:12:41] we always look at things a certain way
[1:12:44] but then god comes and opens the word
[1:12:46] and we see it a different way
[1:12:50] you could see now how cain could be
[1:12:52] justified
[1:12:53] by the mercy of god
[1:12:56] cain could feel justified like he was
[1:12:59] correct
[1:13:02] because god agreed with his protest
[1:13:07] gave him protection put a mark upon him
[1:13:10] to protect him
[1:13:11] and then he goes out and seemingly the
[1:13:14] curse
[1:13:15] takes no effect because
[1:13:18] now he begins to establish civilization
[1:13:21] in cities
[1:13:24] and now it looks as though what god said
[1:13:27] now it looks as though his protest
[1:13:29] changed the entire mind of god
[1:13:33] but god was not looking at stability and
[1:13:36] security in the carnal sense the same
[1:13:38] way
[1:13:38] cain was looking at it he was looking at
[1:13:40] security and stability coming from those
[1:13:43] by revelation would be attached to his
[1:13:44] word
[1:13:45] and that would be their security and
[1:13:47] that would be their steadiness and that
[1:13:49] would be their protection
[1:13:50] and cain would never have that stability
[1:13:53] he would always wonder from doctrine to
[1:13:55] doctrine and man's idea to man's idea
[1:13:57] and knew god to new god another idea to
[1:13:59] other idea
[1:14:00] amen but the children of god would have
[1:14:02] the word of god as stability and
[1:14:04] security
[1:14:05] because they would have it by revelation
[1:14:07] so he was a vagabond
[1:14:09] amen and he was a fugitive and a
[1:14:11] vagabond outside the presence of god
[1:14:13] amen where where seth's line they begin
[1:14:16] to call on the name of god
[1:14:19] says line at the same time they begin to
[1:14:22] call upon the name of god
[1:14:23] amen they were not listen they were not
[1:14:26] just
[1:14:27] saying there's a god amen it wasn't as
[1:14:29] though cain continued to worship
[1:14:31] cain continued to be religious cain
[1:14:33] continued to worship
[1:14:35] god but he worshiped god
[1:14:38] his way and he became
[1:14:42] unstable in that worship he became
[1:14:44] faltering and teetering and wandering
[1:14:47] and now he would incorporate other gods
[1:14:49] and begin to worship son
[1:14:50] and worship moon amen and worship other
[1:14:52] things and then he began to make idols
[1:14:55] what was he he was unstable he was a
[1:14:58] fugitive in a bag of vagabond outside
[1:15:00] the presence of god
[1:15:02] and he continued to worship god but he
[1:15:04] worshiped the god of his own heart his
[1:15:06] own imagination of his own design
[1:15:10] but seth began to call upon the name
[1:15:14] of the lord he didn't want to worship
[1:15:18] god
[1:15:19] he wanted to know god
[1:15:23] he didn't it wouldn't begin to call on
[1:15:25] the name of the lord and when you speak
[1:15:27] name you start to speak of a person or a
[1:15:29] personal
[1:15:30] contact or a personal presence
[1:15:33] and now as a cain cain went off creating
[1:15:36] his own stability
[1:15:38] his own security
[1:15:41] amen and he moved off in the mercy of
[1:15:43] god that allowed him to continue on the
[1:15:45] earth and under that mercy
[1:15:46] god let him go and now god lets him do
[1:15:48] his own thing
[1:15:50] and now carnally he brings security and
[1:15:53] he brings stability because that's what
[1:15:55] religion does
[1:15:58] religion carnally brings stability
[1:16:02] and brings security outside the presence
[1:16:04] of god
[1:16:09] but that religion is always
[1:16:12] teetering wondering
[1:16:18] now cain he
[1:16:21] worships god but seth calls upon the
[1:16:24] name of the lord
[1:16:27] now seth knows he has a lord but he
[1:16:31] wants to know that lord
[1:16:32] personally by name by presence
[1:16:37] this is the difference in the two vines
[1:16:41] now let's go on and keep reading here
[1:16:44] let's go down to verse 19.
[1:16:46] we're in the linea lineage of cain this
[1:16:48] is king's line
[1:16:50] and and lamech took unto him
[1:16:53] two wives the name of the one was ada
[1:16:56] and the name of the other was zela and
[1:16:58] the aid aboard jabel
[1:17:00] he was the father of such as dwell in
[1:17:01] tents and of such as have cattle
[1:17:03] and his brother's name was jubal he was
[1:17:06] the father of all
[1:17:07] such as handle the harp and organ in
[1:17:10] zealous she also bore tubal kane an
[1:17:12] instructor of every artificer and brass
[1:17:14] and iron
[1:17:14] and the sister of tubal kane was naama
[1:17:17] and lamech said unto his wives ada and
[1:17:19] zela
[1:17:20] hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken
[1:17:22] unto my speech for i have slain a man to
[1:17:25] my wounding
[1:17:26] and a young man to my hurt if cain shall
[1:17:29] be avenged sevenfold truly lamech
[1:17:32] seventy and sevenfold
[1:17:36] now lamech is looking back
[1:17:39] at cain who killed abel but had the
[1:17:40] protection of god and when cain kills a
[1:17:45] man he feel
[1:17:46] or when lamech kills a man he feels
[1:17:47] justified in his killing
[1:17:49] because he i killed a man to my wounding
[1:17:52] this man wounded me and i kill him he
[1:17:54] feels justified
[1:17:56] and in his self-justification he points
[1:17:59] back to cain
[1:18:01] and the protection that god gave cain
[1:18:04] and said if he give
[1:18:05] cain protection seven fold he will give
[1:18:08] it to me
[1:18:08] seventy times or seventy-four
[1:18:12] now i want to ask you do you think
[1:18:14] lamech thought cain was wrong
[1:18:18] do you think lamech thought cain was
[1:18:20] cursed of god
[1:18:21] do you think lamech thought that they
[1:18:23] were in the wrong line and then the
[1:18:24] wrong seed doing the wrong thing
[1:18:26] or do you think under deception of
[1:18:28] devils that lamech thought he was in the
[1:18:30] right line
[1:18:32] and the rice's look at what they were
[1:18:34] accomplishing friends
[1:18:35] they were supposed to be fugitives and
[1:18:36] vagabonds and now just a couple
[1:18:38] generations later
[1:18:39] they are those who play the harps and
[1:18:41] play the ark uh the organs they are
[1:18:43] those who
[1:18:43] are artificers of metal and brass all of
[1:18:46] a sudden they are building a tremendous
[1:18:47] civilization and they are bringing
[1:18:49] stability in walled cities they are
[1:18:52] bringing
[1:18:52] science and arts
[1:18:55] and they could look at poor seth lineage
[1:18:58] out there
[1:18:58] and they're just humble farmers and
[1:19:00] herdsmen and they're just
[1:19:01] out there you know they're just they're
[1:19:03] separated by a little groupie here a
[1:19:05] little family group over there and
[1:19:06] little this
[1:19:07] and they're still doing the same thing
[1:19:08] they've been doing for generations they
[1:19:10] haven't advanced
[1:19:11] amen and seth's line looks like the
[1:19:14] wanderers
[1:19:18] seth's line looks like the fugitives and
[1:19:21] the vagabonds
[1:19:23] because they just follow the herd from
[1:19:25] place to place
[1:19:30] when lamech says if cain is even
[1:19:34] they should have been ashamed at what
[1:19:35] happened
[1:19:37] but now he's looking back at that as a
[1:19:39] blessing
[1:19:42] and he's invoking the same blessing
[1:19:44] tenfold upon himself
[1:19:52] seth line were now seemingly the ones
[1:19:55] under the curse
[1:19:59] didn't have a big church building then
[1:20:00] have a big city
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:03] didn't have any power didn't have any
[1:20:05] might
[1:20:07] they were following the herds around
[1:20:10] living in caves and tents
[1:20:14] of whom the world was not worthy
[1:20:18] humble submissive to god
[1:20:21] they were wandering upon the earth
[1:20:24] but they were established in their
[1:20:26] relationship with god
[1:20:29] they were secure they were solid
[1:20:33] they had the atonement for their day
[1:20:35] they knew what abel offered and why abel
[1:20:37] offered it
[1:20:38] they were secure with god they were
[1:20:40] seeking and calling upon the name of the
[1:20:42] lord
[1:20:43] amen they were they were secured by god
[1:20:48] but cain's line was secured by intellect
[1:20:51] and reasoning and wisdom
[1:20:56] i want to ask you do you believe more
[1:20:57] now than you did before that everything
[1:20:59] started in genesis
[1:21:02] and then brother branham knew what he
[1:21:03] was talking about
[1:21:05] the same spirits that were there are the
[1:21:07] same spirits working today there's not
[1:21:08] new spirits
[1:21:12] so now lamech even in his testimony
[1:21:16] he's testifying that that
[1:21:19] that blessing that's on cane i'm
[1:21:20] bringing that same blood that blessing
[1:21:22] is
[1:21:22] following this line
[1:21:27] and they're in the b system this is the
[1:21:30] trail of the serpent
[1:21:32] as it's moving through genesis and
[1:21:35] they're
[1:21:35] in this they are the trail of the
[1:21:37] serpent they are
[1:21:38] the the beast system that's moving down
[1:21:40] through
[1:21:42] but they believe they're right and now
[1:21:46] my first part of my subtitle was
[1:21:47] misunderstood mercy
[1:21:50] and now the mercy that god granted unto
[1:21:53] cain and the mark that he put on him
[1:21:55] and then the seemingly the blessings
[1:21:57] that were heaped upon them in science
[1:21:59] and art and his civilization
[1:22:02] became a misunderstood mercy because god
[1:22:05] sends the reign on the just and the
[1:22:08] unjust
[1:22:10] god says the rain on the just and the
[1:22:12] unjust amen and just because the rain
[1:22:14] comes and just because there's blessings
[1:22:16] that come
[1:22:16] is no indication that you're wheat
[1:22:19] because the blessings from god
[1:22:21] come on the tares too and make them grow
[1:22:26] so now there's there's a misunderstood
[1:22:29] mercy
[1:22:30] and that mercy that god granted and that
[1:22:32] mark that he put
[1:22:33] and the civilization that they built and
[1:22:35] the blessings that are coming from that
[1:22:37] civilization
[1:22:38] hey listen friends there was blessings
[1:22:40] that came from civilization
[1:22:42] farming and crops and trade and all the
[1:22:45] goods and all the sciences and all the
[1:22:47] arts
[1:22:47] it was improving life upon the earth for
[1:22:49] them and
[1:22:50] they were becoming more stable and more
[1:22:53] secure
[1:22:56] but they were vagabonds and and
[1:22:58] fugitives
[1:22:59] from the presence of god so now
[1:23:04] they they continued to move on down
[1:23:06] through until
[1:23:07] lamech now is evoking the same blessing
[1:23:11] but he's in sin he's in violence
[1:23:15] he's in murder and because he's in the
[1:23:19] system
[1:23:20] that he thinks is right he believes god
[1:23:23] will protect him
[1:23:29] praise god
[1:23:33] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:23:34] revealed
[1:23:36] see what's the denomination trying to do
[1:23:38] exalt itself
[1:23:40] like lucifer they so called themselves
[1:23:44] the church
[1:23:45] the bride which they are in revelation
[1:23:47] 17 as i spoke of the false bride
[1:23:50] above christ's little flock the bride
[1:23:51] lucifer thinks and exalts himself above
[1:23:53] the humble word of god's truth
[1:23:55] by the knowledge of the revelation and
[1:23:58] has placed himself by a seminary
[1:24:00] education and theology
[1:24:01] until they have got themselves up and if
[1:24:03] you don't belong in their group then you
[1:24:05] are an outwash
[1:24:07] right back to genesis again
[1:24:15] see he says lucifer i want to repeat
[1:24:18] this statement lucifer thinks and exalts
[1:24:20] himself above the humble word of god's
[1:24:22] truth
[1:24:23] by the knowledge of the revelation the
[1:24:26] simple
[1:24:27] word of god's truth is revealed by the
[1:24:28] knowledge of the revelation and he
[1:24:30] exalts himself above that by his own
[1:24:33] wisdom in schools
[1:24:34] like lucifer did in the beginning to the
[1:24:36] people just exactly what lucifer said to
[1:24:38] eve
[1:24:38] surely god will receive us we feed the
[1:24:41] poor that's good
[1:24:42] surely he will receive us we are a great
[1:24:43] denominational we are a beautiful church
[1:24:46] why look at our great buildings look at
[1:24:48] our great membership we stand in
[1:24:49] millions
[1:24:50] surely god will not turn that group down
[1:24:54] this is cain's line building cities
[1:24:58] and what do you think they had in those
[1:25:00] cities
[1:25:02] temples places of worship
[1:25:06] seth and seth's line had no temple
[1:25:12] they had no beautiful building with
[1:25:14] embroidered artwork with gold
[1:25:17] they had none of the the beautiful
[1:25:19] things that keynes line
[1:25:21] built for the worship of god they didn't
[1:25:24] have
[1:25:24] the they didn't have all the metals and
[1:25:27] the crafts that metals could produce
[1:25:29] and the cutting instruments and the
[1:25:30] tools that would come from metal so they
[1:25:32] could build
[1:25:32] beautiful walled cities but inside the
[1:25:34] beautiful walled city would be a
[1:25:36] structure for worship amen and so you
[1:25:38] can see how cain's line
[1:25:40] would very quickly begin to believe that
[1:25:42] they are
[1:25:43] righteous that they are okay with god
[1:25:46] that god's blessings are upon us and
[1:25:47] that we are fine
[1:25:50] and they can look at seth's line and
[1:25:52] seth has no temple he has no beautiful
[1:25:54] altar he has no
[1:25:56] nothing visible that would show you that
[1:25:59] he is stable with god
[1:26:08] surely he will receive us we are a
[1:26:10] beautiful church why look at our great
[1:26:11] buildings look at our great membership
[1:26:12] we stand in the mirror and surely god
[1:26:14] will not turn that group down
[1:26:16] the same thing that cain did brought in
[1:26:18] the pretty fruits from the ground that
[1:26:19] he had tilled
[1:26:20] and toiled and worked and brought in the
[1:26:22] fruits and rejected the humble blood of
[1:26:23] the lamb
[1:26:25] god have mercy that men and women will
[1:26:27] not think i'm saying this to exalt
[1:26:28] something or some personal revelation or
[1:26:30] something
[1:26:31] i'm only telling you the truth can't you
[1:26:33] see what they're doing
[1:26:34] i speak it loud and harsh but you've got
[1:26:36] to drive a nail till it clenches
[1:26:38] if it's going to do any good see till
[1:26:40] you see it
[1:26:42] now saying to the people surely you mean
[1:26:45] to tell me that our great catholic
[1:26:46] church has stood all this time our great
[1:26:48] methodists and all
[1:26:49] look at our forefathers see but they
[1:26:51] broke the word of the lord
[1:26:52] and eve was god's one of his she was a
[1:26:55] byproduct of adam and because she
[1:26:57] doubted one word of god's word
[1:26:58] it did it and here is lucifer at his job
[1:27:02] again today listen lucifer's at his job
[1:27:05] again today
[1:27:06] but i want you to find out what his job
[1:27:08] is because he's going to tell us
[1:27:09] and remember the antichrist is not
[1:27:11] communism
[1:27:12] the antichrist is so close like the real
[1:27:14] thing to deceive the very elective
[1:27:16] possible
[1:27:17] jesus said matthew 24 the elected if it
[1:27:20] was possible
[1:27:20] lucifer again lucifer
[1:27:24] again is breaking god's unity in man
[1:27:29] that's lucifer's job to break the unity
[1:27:32] between god and man
[1:27:34] and god brought a revelation to bring an
[1:27:38] atonement
[1:27:39] that would bring an at one minute with
[1:27:40] man
[1:27:42] and this is why lucifer is trying to
[1:27:44] keep man away from the atonement
[1:27:46] and the only way to the atonement in
[1:27:48] this day is by divine revelation
[1:27:50] so he's trying to keep man from the
[1:27:52] atonement because he's breaking god's
[1:27:54] unity with man
[1:28:00] lucifer again is breaking god's unity in
[1:28:03] man by his
[1:28:04] limiting the word of god to his
[1:28:06] reasonings what he thinks that's right
[1:28:08] and what he thinks
[1:28:09] he breaks the word of god and the same
[1:28:12] thing he did in the days of jesus and
[1:28:13] jesus said you by your traditions has
[1:28:15] made the word of god of no effect
[1:28:17] and the denominations by their organized
[1:28:19] intellectual reasonings
[1:28:21] has made god's word of no effect upon
[1:28:23] the people that's right
[1:28:24] they just can't see it then they say
[1:28:27] where is the god of the bible
[1:28:28] he's right here he's the bible that's
[1:28:31] what he is
[1:28:33] where is god he's the word
[1:28:36] they want to see another red sea parted
[1:28:38] amen and they failed to see
[1:28:40] that the god who parted the red sea is
[1:28:42] the god who took off the seals
[1:28:47] and where is the god of the bible he is
[1:28:49] right here he is the one who wrote the
[1:28:51] bible he is the one who come down to
[1:28:53] reveal the bible amen
[1:28:55] it's god of the bible he is the word
[1:28:57] where is god
[1:28:58] can you not see him in the revelation of
[1:29:01] this hour
[1:29:01] do you not see the mighty god unveiled
[1:29:06] where is god i i want to see another ark
[1:29:09] i want to see
[1:29:09] another fire come down upon the altar
[1:29:12] on on a mount showdown
[1:29:16] i want to see another parting of the red
[1:29:17] sea i want another see this i want to
[1:29:19] see another that when god is standing
[1:29:21] right in our midst
[1:29:22] and he's breaking the word open amen and
[1:29:24] he's breaking it open day by day by day
[1:29:27] by revelation amen and now you say where
[1:29:29] is god i want to see
[1:29:30] god
[1:29:34] when the lamb takes the book he breaks
[1:29:36] the seal
[1:29:39] now do you see god
[1:29:44] hey amen let's go to genesis chapter six
[1:29:49] and i'm not even halfway through friends
[1:29:52] we're gonna have to save some for
[1:29:53] wednesday i believe
[1:29:58] genesis chapter six
[1:30:05] and it came to pass when men began to
[1:30:07] multiply on the face of the earth
[1:30:09] and daughters were born unto them but
[1:30:11] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[1:30:13] that they were fair
[1:30:15] they took them wives of all they chose
[1:30:18] the lord said my spirit shall not always
[1:30:19] strive with man
[1:30:21] for he is also he also is flesh yet his
[1:30:24] day shall be a hundred
[1:30:26] and twenty years
[1:30:29] now all of a sudden god
[1:30:34] puts a mark upon cain this is the mark
[1:30:37] of the beast
[1:30:39] that's why brother branham said this is
[1:30:41] very very
[1:30:42] critical brother branham says when you
[1:30:45] refuse the holy ghost you've already
[1:30:46] received the mark of the beast
[1:30:49] because that's exactly what cain did
[1:30:53] cain refused the holy spirit what's the
[1:30:54] holy spirit it's the life of god god was
[1:30:56] standing there talking to him
[1:30:58] do this and he refused the holy ghost
[1:31:02] he refused god and so you take the mark
[1:31:05] of the beast
[1:31:05] and now to refuse the holy ghost is to
[1:31:07] take the mark of the beast
[1:31:11] but under this mark because
[1:31:14] he had in his mind a wisdom that put him
[1:31:17] on an equal level with god
[1:31:19] you know if you're going to debate with
[1:31:21] somebody
[1:31:22] then you feel like you're on an equal
[1:31:24] level with them
[1:31:26] if you come in contact with somebody
[1:31:28] who's an absolute expert on a situation
[1:31:30] on a
[1:31:31] on an issue and they tell you this is
[1:31:33] the problem you say okay let's fix it
[1:31:36] but if you have another idea that you
[1:31:39] think is better it shows that you're
[1:31:41] operating on a position of some sort of
[1:31:43] equality
[1:31:46] because then you begin to debate like if
[1:31:50] the mechanic looks at me and says you
[1:31:51] know this is the problem with your car i
[1:31:52] say fix it i mean he could be ripping me
[1:31:54] off but
[1:31:55] i'm not going to argue with him but if
[1:31:58] he comes to fix my air conditioning unit
[1:32:00] and he says i think this is
[1:32:01] i then we're going to go toe to toe and
[1:32:03] say i know i think you're wrong
[1:32:06] because that's the work that i used to
[1:32:07] do so you can see cain now
[1:32:10] he he believes now now
[1:32:13] he believes that he's got a justifiable
[1:32:17] uh right of protest
[1:32:20] that something's not right in what god
[1:32:22] said and god
[1:32:24] seemingly capitulates
[1:32:28] i hope you can see this in the word
[1:32:31] and and sticks up for him gives him the
[1:32:33] mark sends him out
[1:32:35] and promised he'd be a fugitive in a
[1:32:36] vagabond but every measure he and his
[1:32:38] descendants take
[1:32:40] are an absolute contrast to what was
[1:32:42] looked like the curse of god
[1:32:45] and begin to establish themselves upon
[1:32:47] the earth and establish civilization in
[1:32:49] walled cities and temples and
[1:32:52] strict forms of worship and all of these
[1:32:54] things and trade and commerce and goods
[1:32:56] and the moving of commerce and
[1:32:58] they established they established
[1:33:00] themselves upon the earth
[1:33:02] and it looked like now god perhaps
[1:33:05] has changed his mind about cain
[1:33:09] i hope that makes sense so they begin to
[1:33:12] believe that they're the right line the
[1:33:14] correct line
[1:33:18] and it's so deceptive that
[1:33:22] the sons of god begin to get attracted
[1:33:25] by this
[1:33:28] and they begin to see the daughters of
[1:33:31] man
[1:33:32] that they're beautiful but they're fair
[1:33:36] and they begin to take unto them wives
[1:33:40] now cain cain could make all the
[1:33:44] scientific achievements he wanted to
[1:33:46] and god let him go is that true
[1:33:51] cain could build all the cities he
[1:33:53] wanted to
[1:33:55] he could create metallurgy he could
[1:33:57] create music
[1:33:58] he could do anything that they wanted to
[1:34:01] do and god left him alone
[1:34:05] but the minute that deception began to
[1:34:08] creep into the righteous line
[1:34:11] now god is going to take action
[1:34:15] and they begin to misunderstand the
[1:34:17] mercy of god and the blessings
[1:34:19] god they went out from the presence of
[1:34:20] god god no longer dealing with them
[1:34:22] but there's certain laws established in
[1:34:24] the earth there's certain things that
[1:34:25] god has set up and they begin to work in
[1:34:27] those laws and they begin to work in
[1:34:29] that earth they begin to dig into the
[1:34:30] soil and they begin to
[1:34:32] excavate and they begin to create and
[1:34:34] god leaves them alone because his
[1:34:36] presence is no longer with them
[1:34:37] and as long as they do their own thing
[1:34:39] amen god lets them go
[1:34:43] but the minute this deception begins to
[1:34:46] suck
[1:34:46] in his children amen and the
[1:34:49] hybridization
[1:34:50] starts to come in amen and the righteous
[1:34:53] line becomes
[1:34:54] gets polluted and now there's a mixing
[1:34:56] together now god comes on the scene and
[1:34:58] says i will not let
[1:35:00] this continue amen
[1:35:03] i tell you there was such a deception
[1:35:05] upon the earth through the church ages
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:08] such a mixing such a beautiful form of
[1:35:10] worship and
[1:35:11] intellectualism in schools and books and
[1:35:14] bibles and seminaries there is such a
[1:35:16] beautiful form of worship that the
[1:35:18] children of god amen
[1:35:19] they kept getting sucked back into this
[1:35:21] thing
[1:35:23] they kept getting they kept getting
[1:35:24] pulled back in amen
[1:35:26] and it looked right amen it looked like
[1:35:28] it was blessed of god
[1:35:29] i mean how else could you build a school
[1:35:32] and have so many converts
[1:35:33] and how could you sweep through a place
[1:35:35] with a revival and totally change the
[1:35:37] inhabitants over
[1:35:40] and the children of god are always
[1:35:41] confused by this
[1:35:44] but in the end of the ages god has come
[1:35:46] down and he says
[1:35:48] no more amen this is the time that my
[1:35:51] children are not going to get sucked
[1:35:52] into that thing anymore
[1:35:53] amen because brother branham brother he
[1:35:55] starts speaking he starts saying
[1:35:57] now you see what happened in luther you
[1:35:59] see what happened in wesley
[1:36:00] fallen angels come in they took it to a
[1:36:02] form of religion god
[1:36:03] they died god turned to this one they
[1:36:06] died god turned to this one
[1:36:07] amen they died and then he says now you
[1:36:09] see why the seals had to come open
[1:36:15] because god's going to rescue his
[1:36:17] children
[1:36:18] from this system
[1:36:21] the whole purpose of the opening of the
[1:36:23] seals friends
[1:36:24] was to rescue you and i from this system
[1:36:29] in this system it's more listen the
[1:36:32] system is
[1:36:33] more than baptist and catholic and
[1:36:35] pentecostal and blah blah blah
[1:36:37] it's more than that it's a mentality
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:40] it's a mode of thinking it's an
[1:36:42] intellectual approach
[1:36:43] amen it is a covering that'll cover us
[1:36:46] from the judgments of god
[1:36:47] it's a form of worship it's an order
[1:36:50] that we can step into
[1:36:51] in stepping into that order we can
[1:36:53] become to feel secure
[1:36:55] so secure that we can be outside the
[1:36:57] presence of god
[1:36:58] and be fine
[1:37:04] and the seals come open to free us from
[1:37:06] that system
[1:37:09] the bridegroom is here himself to make
[1:37:12] sure the bride doesn't go into this
[1:37:18] system
[1:37:20] if we make the message another system
[1:37:25] we fall into the same error
[1:37:31] if we if we find comfort
[1:37:36] in the fact that i believe god sent a
[1:37:39] prophet
[1:37:41] and that he wants us to have some
[1:37:43] semblance of holiness but my definition
[1:37:44] could be different than your definition
[1:37:49] and then he wants us baptized in jesus
[1:37:51] name
[1:37:54] and he wants us to go to church and pray
[1:37:56] our tithes and
[1:38:01] all of those things are good and those
[1:38:04] are works of righteousness
[1:38:10] but true righteousness is by
[1:38:14] imputation by faith
[1:38:19] not by just repeating
[1:38:25] if we're if we're not careful we can
[1:38:28] make the message
[1:38:30] a church order
[1:38:34] and our children can take the message as
[1:38:36] a church order
[1:38:40] and they begin to dress right
[1:38:43] talk right come to church pay the tithe
[1:38:46] and believe god sent a prophet
[1:38:48] get baptized in jesus name
[1:38:51] but when it comes to
[1:38:54] let's say this way when it comes to
[1:38:57] calling on the name of the lord
[1:39:01] they're too comfortable in the system
[1:39:04] to need to call on the name of the lord
[1:39:09] there's a security that has come
[1:39:12] a stability a security
[1:39:16] that has come because i can do all these
[1:39:19] things
[1:39:22] but seth was not secured in a walled
[1:39:25] city
[1:39:27] seth was not secured in arts and
[1:39:31] sciences and in advancement
[1:39:34] he wasn't secured in an army he wasn't
[1:39:36] secured in all that
[1:39:38] seth security was calling on the name of
[1:39:40] the lord
[1:39:43] our security can only come
[1:39:46] from a personal individual
[1:39:49] one-on-one relationship with god
[1:39:54] what is the new birth it's jesus christ
[1:39:57] revealed personally to you
[1:39:59] it's an experience where you have
[1:40:01] connected with the living god and you
[1:40:03] know that you've connected with the
[1:40:04] living god
[1:40:06] and now systems don't matter
[1:40:10] churches rise churches fall ministries
[1:40:12] come ministries go
[1:40:15] you understand not that those things
[1:40:17] don't grieve not that those things don't
[1:40:18] hurt
[1:40:19] not that not that separation then people
[1:40:21] come in and people go out and people
[1:40:22] stay awhile people leave people come
[1:40:24] they
[1:40:24] show up church grows church shrinks
[1:40:30] you understand that's none of that is
[1:40:32] our stability
[1:40:35] a minister believes a minister doesn't
[1:40:36] believe
[1:40:39] loves the message hates the message
[1:40:43] if your stability was in the system
[1:40:49] when the head of your system walks away
[1:40:51] and says no it's all false
[1:40:52] you walk away too because you were in
[1:40:54] the system
[1:40:59] see what we're trying to do is take the
[1:41:02] cover a lot off
[1:41:04] so that the devil's exposed
[1:41:11] if we expose him in the catholics how do
[1:41:14] i
[1:41:15] where's the deception that's all around
[1:41:17] the bride
[1:41:19] that's so close i could see the elect if
[1:41:21] possible
[1:41:25] see the beast system
[1:41:28] we say rome is the b system and it began
[1:41:31] the rome became the b
[1:41:32] system and there's going to be an image
[1:41:35] made unto the beast
[1:41:39] now the image made unto the beast
[1:41:41] doesn't have to wear a robe with a sash
[1:41:43] and a funny hat and wave incense
[1:41:49] it doesn't have to be a replica of all
[1:41:52] the works
[1:41:54] but an image of the beast is something
[1:41:56] that's made in its likeness
[1:41:58] and the image to the beast can be a
[1:42:00] false system of worship that brings a
[1:42:03] false security
[1:42:04] outside the presence of god
[1:42:09] and you could be in the b system sitting
[1:42:11] in this
[1:42:12] church
[1:42:17] how's that possible i go to a message
[1:42:19] church
[1:42:23] it's not necessarily the condition of
[1:42:25] the church although you can have a wrong
[1:42:27] church
[1:42:28] but it's the condition of the worshipper
[1:42:35] now you can have a church that's totally
[1:42:36] off an error i'm not denying that
[1:42:39] but you can have a church in a ministry
[1:42:40] that's preaching the truth of god by
[1:42:42] revelation
[1:42:43] and you yourself and your own mind and
[1:42:45] concept can be
[1:42:46] in the system
[1:42:50] and this is why the seals came open
[1:42:56] this is why that god sent a prophet
[1:43:00] not though you can say i believe god set
[1:43:02] a prophet and now that becomes my
[1:43:03] security
[1:43:06] and now my stability is on the fact that
[1:43:09] all of us believe the same
[1:43:13] and i can look and see i know god's in
[1:43:15] your life and your life in your life in
[1:43:16] your life
[1:43:17] so this must be the right place so i'm
[1:43:19] in the right spot and i'm doing
[1:43:20] everything that i'm told to do
[1:43:22] and so i'm okay too
[1:43:30] that is the wrong system in the mind
[1:43:35] our only security comes from him
[1:43:41] our husband our bridegroom the word that
[1:43:45] has come to us in this day to unite with
[1:43:47] us
[1:43:47] as an individual not as a church
[1:43:53] christ came you we can say christ came
[1:43:55] to unite from the bride that is the
[1:43:56] truth
[1:43:58] christ came to unite with his bride but
[1:44:00] when it really comes down to it if
[1:44:01] you're a bride
[1:44:02] christ came to unite with you
[1:44:06] personally individually
[1:44:10] and that becomes your security
[1:44:16] let's not make anything else our
[1:44:18] security
[1:44:20] all you could be surrounded by wonderful
[1:44:22] people you could be surrounded by the
[1:44:24] elect of god
[1:44:27] and you yourself could have a system in
[1:44:29] your mind
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:31] and you could be sitting in the system
[1:44:36] feeling safe and secure
[1:44:45] and being blessed
[1:44:49] and receiving mercy
[1:44:53] and being healed
[1:44:57] i hope you know i'm speaking the truth
[1:45:01] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:45:03] the unjust
[1:45:05] you could be blessed and have a new home
[1:45:08] and get a promotion at work
[1:45:09] and have your little baby healed and all
[1:45:12] of those things
[1:45:13] and now the mercy of god can be
[1:45:15] misunderstood to equate to a
[1:45:17] relationship with god
[1:45:20] and to equate to me being seed of god
[1:45:26] and i hope you understand i'm not here
[1:45:28] to take away your security
[1:45:30] i'm here to take away a false security
[1:45:34] so i hope you don't think brother ted's
[1:45:35] preaching he's putting us all out no
[1:45:37] i i think you're all in i hope you're
[1:45:40] all in
[1:45:42] but you're only in as an individual
[1:45:44] you're only in as one unit connected to
[1:45:46] god
[1:45:46] that you're in when you as an individual
[1:45:49] have been baptized into the body into
[1:45:51] christ
[1:45:53] by a personal revelation by an
[1:45:55] experience with god
[1:45:57] so this preaching i am not trying to
[1:46:00] unsettle anybody
[1:46:01] unless you're in a system then i hope
[1:46:03] you're naked right now
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:06] if you've grown up and it become a
[1:46:08] system if if you're born into the
[1:46:10] message if you just go to a message
[1:46:12] church
[1:46:14] i hope that you are so naked right now
[1:46:18] that you say god would you clothe me
[1:46:20] amen i need that garment that comes from
[1:46:23] the atonement amen i need to be clothed
[1:46:25] in the word by revelation
[1:46:27] i am naked i thought i was right but i
[1:46:29] now realize today i'm wrong amen
[1:46:31] i was only going through the motions but
[1:46:33] i really have no security down in my
[1:46:35] heart
[1:46:38] my security was in my conduct
[1:46:42] my security was in the conduct of those
[1:46:44] around me
[1:46:45] my security was being in the right
[1:46:48] church
[1:46:50] or being in the right form of belief
[1:46:54] i don't even know if you're supposed to
[1:46:55] use those then i don't know that
[1:46:58] it just felt good
[1:47:04] you see systems over there and systems
[1:47:08] over there and systems over there
[1:47:10] no listen the system's all around
[1:47:16] your corrupt mind wants a system
[1:47:22] your fallen nature desperately desires a
[1:47:26] denomination
[1:47:30] that's why we've received the mind of
[1:47:31] christ to free us from that mind
[1:47:34] that's why we've been converted because
[1:47:37] your fallen nature
[1:47:38] desperately wants a denominational
[1:47:41] system
[1:47:42] that i can plug myself into
[1:47:45] and if i plug into this i'm now okay
[1:47:51] i it goes back to man wants to find the
[1:47:54] formula
[1:47:56] where's the formula where 1
[1:48:00] plus 1 equals 2 so that i can just plug
[1:48:03] numbers in the formula to get a
[1:48:05] guaranteed outcome
[1:48:10] but this day this is not what god wants
[1:48:15] god has laid that whole thing bare
[1:48:17] because god
[1:48:18] wants you
[1:48:22] as an individual free from the beast
[1:48:25] system
[1:48:27] out from under the mark of the beast
[1:48:30] with
[1:48:31] no security and numbers and no security
[1:48:34] and forms of worship
[1:48:35] and no security and and doctrines and no
[1:48:37] security in sets of beliefs but in an
[1:48:40] absolute security that i have met the
[1:48:42] living god and he is my father
[1:48:44] and he's my husband and i've been united
[1:48:46] to him amen
[1:48:48] that the revealing of this word has
[1:48:49] opened the door to me and i have escaped
[1:48:51] out of this earth i have escaped out of
[1:48:53] laodicea i've went through the open door
[1:48:55] i'm now seated in heavenly places
[1:48:57] in christ jesus that is my security and
[1:49:00] i may be a fugitive and a vagabond
[1:49:02] wandering in the eyes of carnality on
[1:49:04] this earth
[1:49:05] with no stability and nothing set up and
[1:49:07] no denomination
[1:49:10] but i am so secure
[1:49:14] earthly amen i may lose this and i may
[1:49:17] lose debt and i may get sick and then i
[1:49:19] may recover and then
[1:49:20] and then i may lose a job and economics
[1:49:23] may go up for me economics may go down
[1:49:25] we may have church troubles and church
[1:49:27] splits and pastors leave the message and
[1:49:28] blah blah blah
[1:49:29] and it looks like fugitives and
[1:49:32] vagabonds
[1:49:39] but if you've been calling on the name
[1:49:41] of the lord
[1:49:44] you're the one who's stable steady
[1:49:48] and secure
[1:49:51] a believer's security when he's united
[1:49:53] with christ moves with him from one
[1:49:55] tragedy to the next
[1:49:59] one disaster to the next disaster one
[1:50:02] heart egg to the next heart egg
[1:50:04] one one valley to the next valley what
[1:50:07] what is it what's brought me through
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:09] my security moves with me through every
[1:50:11] valley
[1:50:12] my security goes with me through every
[1:50:14] trial amen it may look rough to you but
[1:50:16] it's not rough inside of me because i
[1:50:18] know whom i believed in
[1:50:20] and he is able to keep that which i
[1:50:22] committed unto him
[1:50:24] my salvation is secure my eternal
[1:50:26] destination is secure
[1:50:27] i don't care if i die tomorrow i'm
[1:50:30] secure i'm not here to preserve my life
[1:50:32] i'm not here to advance my life i'm not
[1:50:34] here to build my city
[1:50:35] i'm not here to build a form of worship
[1:50:37] i'm just here to know him
[1:50:44] all of our desire should be to seek the
[1:50:46] name of the lord
[1:50:50] god will see to it that we have
[1:50:51] opportunities for our system to get
[1:50:53] shaken
[1:50:56] and if you've served the lord around
[1:50:58] this word for any length of time
[1:51:00] god has given an opportunity for the
[1:51:02] system to get shaken
[1:51:05] so you can find out where your real
[1:51:06] security is
[1:51:12] it's not even going to come from your
[1:51:13] family
[1:51:16] not even going to come in the works of
[1:51:18] your hands but your security will come
[1:51:21] from your relationship
[1:51:23] with him security is not in my religion
[1:51:29] my security is not in my works my
[1:51:32] security is not in my blessings
[1:51:36] all of those things can be wrong
[1:51:40] but my security is found in my
[1:51:43] relationship
[1:51:44] with the bridegroom
[1:51:48] and i hope that your security is found
[1:51:51] in your relationship with the bridegroom
[1:51:54] because he has come into this eden
[1:51:57] satan's eden and he's come as the white
[1:52:01] wig
[1:52:02] one the supreme judge of all heavens and
[1:52:04] earth
[1:52:06] and he has come to judge your sin
[1:52:13] he's actually coming this day to judge
[1:52:16] your
[1:52:16] hybridization
[1:52:20] and in judging it he'll bring you to a
[1:52:22] true atonement
[1:52:25] and that atonement will free you from
[1:52:28] the effects
[1:52:28] of hybridization
[1:52:32] and so free you until someday your atoms
[1:52:36] will change
[1:52:38] that's how free this judge has made us
[1:52:40] and that's how pure this atonement is
[1:52:44] let that be our security
[1:52:48] amen musicians if you'll come if you all
[1:52:51] stand with me
[1:52:52] i just don't feel to go any further
[1:52:55] we lord willing we have more services if
[1:52:58] not we'll talk about it in heaven
[1:53:02] in the millennium will know these things
[1:53:07] oh i tell you i love him friends
[1:53:10] i love him that he's freed us he's freed
[1:53:13] us from ourselves
[1:53:16] he's freed us from the deception that
[1:53:18] lays all around us
[1:53:20] he's freed us from from the things that
[1:53:22] are so enticing and looks so good
[1:53:24] he has solely set us free because why
[1:53:27] why has he freed us
[1:53:29] i want to ask you why would god even
[1:53:31] come and bring a word like this today
[1:53:34] because he's jealous
[1:53:38] over you
[1:53:42] why would he come and rip away a false
[1:53:44] security
[1:53:45] because the false security is keeping
[1:53:47] you from him
[1:53:50] religion is not here to bring you in
[1:53:52] contact with him religion is to keep
[1:53:54] you from him
[1:53:58] religion will keep you from the white
[1:54:00] wig one
[1:54:02] because the white wig one is the supreme
[1:54:04] judge and lays you bare
[1:54:06] but that white wig one that came a
[1:54:09] supreme judge of heaven and earth
[1:54:11] he came down to marry somebody
[1:54:19] there are people around the message that
[1:54:22] want to stay away from that white wigged
[1:54:24] one
[1:54:27] you understand friends claiming to be in
[1:54:30] the message and message believers but
[1:54:31] they want to stay away from that white
[1:54:32] wigged one
[1:54:35] don't want to talk about the cloud don't
[1:54:37] want to talk about the opening of the
[1:54:38] seventh seal don't want to talk about
[1:54:40] the eighth day and the bride agent
[1:54:44] all that is the same subject we're
[1:54:46] trying to stay away from the white
[1:54:47] wigged one
[1:54:50] and now a religious order
[1:54:54] is keeping us from the white wigged one
[1:55:00] but the white wig one came so that you
[1:55:03] would realize
[1:55:04] without him you're nothing
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:10] and he came down to be your everything
[1:55:14] your husband you're a toner your judge
[1:55:17] your deliverer
[1:55:18] your healer your friend your maker
[1:55:21] your lover he came down to free you
[1:55:26] because he's jealous over you and he
[1:55:30] wants you
[1:55:30] just to himself
[1:55:34] so i say this morning let's run to the
[1:55:36] white wig one
[1:55:38] let's run to him and embrace him and say
[1:55:41] judge me
[1:55:41] amen judge this wrong thinking judge the
[1:55:44] system in my mind
[1:55:45] i i realize that i'm naked before you
[1:55:48] but god
[1:55:49] only you by revelation can bring me to
[1:55:51] the atonement and bring me back into
[1:55:52] fellowship
[1:55:53] god give me true revelation
[1:55:57] run to the white wig one who opened the
[1:55:59] seals run
[1:56:00] through this word because the word is
[1:56:01] the path to the blood
[1:56:03] to the life that will reconcile us back
[1:56:07] to god
[1:56:09] oh i i hope i hope i hope i believe
[1:56:13] god will make these things real in your
[1:56:15] heart
[1:56:16] that what's so heavy in my heart will
[1:56:18] become a reality in your heart
[1:56:21] that we will have him in him only
[1:56:26] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:56:29] we thank you father
[1:56:31] that you are so good to us lord
[1:56:35] god you're exposing every hindrance
[1:56:38] every trap every while of the
[1:56:42] devil that would keep us from you
[1:56:45] god i pray that you would help us to
[1:56:47] keep seeking your name
[1:56:49] to keep seeking your faith to stay in
[1:56:51] your presence
[1:56:52] your presence is here lord you sent a
[1:56:55] mighty prophet in our day to prove that
[1:56:57] you're here
[1:56:59] and you are here you're still here
[1:57:02] you can be found if we will seek for you
[1:57:05] with all of our heart
[1:57:07] help us lord to drop every form of
[1:57:09] ritual
[1:57:10] every wrong idea and every wrong
[1:57:13] security
[1:57:14] anything that makes us secure outside of
[1:57:16] a relationship with you
[1:57:17] may we drop it right now and may we run
[1:57:21] to you because you're the
[1:57:22] toner you're the sacrifice
[1:57:27] you're the redeemer let us unite with
[1:57:30] you
[1:57:31] almighty god oh lord let us come into
[1:57:34] your presence now
[1:57:37] may all the filth of the prostitutes be
[1:57:39] washed away from us
[1:57:41] under the washing of the water of the
[1:57:42] word and may you almighty god
[1:57:46] set us free set us free from the bondage
[1:57:50] of walled cities and wrong
[1:57:52] thinking and false worship set us free
[1:57:55] from
[1:57:56] misunderstood mercy
[1:58:00] lord help us to unite with you
[1:58:03] for your prophet told us that your bride
[1:58:06] stand on the word
