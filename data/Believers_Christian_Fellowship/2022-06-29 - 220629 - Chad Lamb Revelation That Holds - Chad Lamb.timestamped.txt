[17:42] find nothing when god so moves on the
[17:44] scene that there's no longer anything to
[17:46] be found
[17:47] and they is a good clean bill of health
[17:49] thank god for that
[17:51] amen john chapter 13 and let's read
[17:53] verse 1.
[17:56] now before the feast of the passover
[17:58] when jesus knew that his hour was come
[18:01] that he should depart out of this world
[18:02] and to the father having loved his own
[18:05] which were in the world he loved them
[18:07] unto the end and supper being ended the
[18:09] devil having now put into the heart of
[18:11] judas iscariot simon's son to betray him
[18:14] jesus knowing that the father had given
[18:16] all things into his hands that he was
[18:18] come from god and went to god he rises
[18:21] from supper and laid aside his garments
[18:22] and took a towel and girded himself
[18:25] after that he poured water into a basin
[18:27] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[18:29] to wipe them with the towel where with
[18:31] he was girded men god bless you as
[18:33] you're seated
[18:35] may the lord bless his word
[18:37] amen
[18:39] keep your finger on the scripture i want
[18:41] to look at this again but i also want to
[18:43] say that many of you know and are aware
[18:46] that there was
[18:47] an accident
[18:48] sunday night for
[18:50] thomas sproles jr and his family were
[18:53] driving home from the wedding from the
[18:55] mcdivitt wedding
[18:56] sunday night and they were in an
[18:58] accident and
[19:00] thomas sproles jr lost his life in that
[19:02] accident so i know many of you are
[19:03] already aware of that but it's yet
[19:05] another
[19:07] difficult situation for the assembly
[19:09] there at true word and
[19:10] and we know that god is in all things
[19:13] and i expect to hear testimonies even
[19:15] from this but we know it's been a
[19:17] difficult time for the assembly there
[19:20] for the believers in that church after
[19:22] losing the collins and having that
[19:24] funeral
[19:25] and so it's not been an easy time so we
[19:27] want to remember them in prayer i know
[19:29] that there was a gofundme page set up
[19:32] for the family and then they're going to
[19:34] have some needs some
[19:36] expenses for the funeral they want to
[19:37] cover and also a vehicle because now the
[19:40] grandparents are going to take the
[19:42] children into the home and thomas's wife
[19:44] and they're just there's some needs
[19:46] there so if you could get that
[19:48] information from somebody i know several
[19:50] here already have it and that gofundme
[19:52] page and help out with that we don't
[19:54] have any details as yet for the funeral
[19:56] service or memorial service or how
[19:58] they're going to do that but when we do
[19:59] we'll we'll get the word out and let
[20:01] everybody know but i just really want to
[20:03] stand together with our brothers and
[20:05] sisters in prayer and hold them up in
[20:07] prayer and ask that god would bless that
[20:09] family
[20:10] bless those children and their wife and
[20:11] the grandparents and the entire assembly
[20:15] amen there's
[20:16] it's hard to understand and hard to
[20:18] explain but god knows what he's doing
[20:21] there were testimonies that came out of
[20:23] what some would call a tragedy god knew
[20:27] to us it's a tragedy to god it's a plan
[20:30] and the same thing i believe will be
[20:31] true that we'll hear testimonies come
[20:33] forth that what is to us a tragedy to
[20:36] god is a plan
[20:37] and god knows what he's doing so let's
[20:39] just remember them in prayer as an
[20:41] assembly and and stand by them and if
[20:44] there's anything that we as an assembly
[20:45] can do to help i would love to be of
[20:47] help so we'll just stay in touch and see
[20:49] if there's anything if there's something
[20:50] comes up that we can be helpful with
[20:53] we'll get the word out and see if we can
[20:54] do something to help them out amen
[20:58] so remember to be in
[21:00] prayer amen for tonight i'd like to go
[21:03] back and look at this scripture again
[21:05] while we've got our bibles opening on
[21:07] this page
[21:08] and i want to talk about a revelation
[21:11] that holds
[21:13] and
[21:14] we know that the world is not getting
[21:18] more stable
[21:20] is that right i mean how many beliefs is
[21:21] becoming more stable
[21:23] things are becoming less stable all the
[21:26] time
[21:27] we thought covert would be a cycle and
[21:29] that cycle would come and go and and for
[21:31] the most part it seems like it's tapered
[21:33] off and it's going away but right on the
[21:35] heels of that is something else and
[21:37] something else and something else and i
[21:39] think we're just in the cycle of
[21:41] destruction which brother branham said
[21:44] started the judgment began on the west
[21:46] coast
[21:47] that judgment is still rolling on
[21:49] throughout this world they rejected a
[21:52] prophet they rejected the word of god
[21:54] amen and there's no there's nothing else
[21:56] that can come but this cycle of judgment
[21:59] is is is and the birth pains are
[22:01] increasing in intensity and in frequency
[22:04] amen so as we see
[22:06] amen the end drawing nigh we've been
[22:08] believing that i've been believing that
[22:10] for the majority of my life i mean since
[22:12] we come into the message 20 some years
[22:14] ago i thought that i barely slipped in i
[22:17] slid under the wire right before the
[22:19] thing shut down
[22:20] and here we are 20 years later so we've
[22:23] been seeing the cycles as the cycles
[22:25] increases as things get worse but we can
[22:28] definitely see an uptick amen the world
[22:31] is in chaos things are uncertain
[22:34] and they may get much much worse we
[22:36] don't know
[22:38] but yet there's a revelation that holds
[22:40] us
[22:41] in every hour through every circumstance
[22:44] in our lives both in as individuals as
[22:47] families as churches as the bride as a
[22:49] whole there's a revelation that has to
[22:52] hold us because as we're here for the
[22:54] wrapping up of all things as
[22:56] civilization crumbles in this earth
[22:58] groans and travail ready to bring forth
[23:01] a bright new millennium we're not
[23:03] expecting things to get better but they
[23:04] must get worse amen the contractions
[23:07] must get harder the birth planes must be
[23:09] get more intense and the frequency must
[23:11] come closer together
[23:13] everything else must continue to fall
[23:15] apart amen because everything has to
[23:17] completely fall apart amen so christ can
[23:20] come and set up his kingdom every
[23:22] kingdom has to be destroyed
[23:25] amen so we don't expect
[23:28] large improvements amen
[23:30] we but what we expect is to see things
[23:32] continue to become chaotic
[23:34] but praise god there's a revelation that
[23:37] holds amen
[23:39] the one thing that we don't know is
[23:42] we look at we know things the prophet
[23:44] said we've been looking at them for
[23:45] years we know that between where we
[23:48] stand now and the change in our bodies
[23:52] we know several statements that the
[23:54] prophet made things that must transpire
[23:56] and must take place but what it will
[23:58] exactly look like and and how intense
[24:01] things will be to us as individuals or
[24:03] certain individuals and what exactly how
[24:06] exactly this is going to manifest
[24:08] there's question marks we don't know i
[24:10] mean we don't know how quickly these
[24:12] things will unfold how long that it will
[24:14] take we don't know how intense things
[24:16] will get but praise be to god we know
[24:19] one thing for sure that we are his bride
[24:22] that he has his eye on us amen he will
[24:25] not lose a one for we are in in his hand
[24:28] amen
[24:30] so there's a revelation that holds
[24:33] and here we see jesus
[24:35] he's coming to the point of crucifixion
[24:38] he's coming to
[24:40] in many ways he's coming to the climax
[24:43] of his purpose of coming in flesh the
[24:45] first time and that was to pay the price
[24:47] of redemption for all of the elect of
[24:49] gone
[24:50] and so now he's coming down to what
[24:53] looks like a terrible time but yet it's
[24:55] a great time amen it looks like it's
[24:58] going to be horrible but yet it's going
[25:00] to be wonderful because the scripture
[25:02] says concerning god it pleased him to
[25:05] bruise him
[25:07] and you look at this scripture and it
[25:09] says it pleased him to bruise him and
[25:11] and
[25:12] sometimes it doesn't compute in our
[25:14] minds but god is always looking at
[25:16] something so much bigger he is not like
[25:19] us his thoughts are so much higher than
[25:21] our thoughts we we would come like the
[25:23] disciples we would be with if we didn't
[25:26] have the understanding we have now on
[25:28] the day of calvary we would be exactly
[25:30] like the disciples we would be
[25:31] distraught we would be destroyed we
[25:33] would think all is lost that this is the
[25:35] worst thing that's ever happened to us
[25:37] not knowing that it was the best thing
[25:39] that ever happened to them
[25:41] it was by and far the greatest thing
[25:43] that could ever happen to them but at
[25:45] the moment they thought it was the worst
[25:47] thing that could ever happen to them
[25:50] amen so jesus now is moving to this and
[25:53] we know by the scriptures he knows
[25:55] what's coming
[25:57] and and verse 1 says now before the
[25:59] feast of passover when jesus knew that
[26:01] his hour was come
[26:03] that he should depart out of this world
[26:05] and to the father
[26:07] having loved his own which were in the
[26:08] world he loved them unto the end
[26:12] supper being ended then the devil having
[26:13] now put into the heart of judas iscariot
[26:15] simon's son to betray him
[26:17] jesus knowing that the father had given
[26:20] all things into his hands that he was
[26:22] come from god and he went to god
[26:26] so jesus had a revelation of who he was
[26:30] he comes to this part knowing that he
[26:32] must depart out of this world and to the
[26:34] father
[26:35] knowing now he spoke to simon he told
[26:39] him do what thou must do so judas
[26:41] judas son of simon he took off
[26:43] everything was set in motion amen and he
[26:46] knew that he come from god
[26:49] look it says jesus knowing that the
[26:51] father had given all things into his
[26:53] hands and that he was come from god and
[26:56] went to god
[26:57] so we see now jesus coming to the
[26:59] crucifixion he had a perfect
[27:01] understanding of who he was
[27:04] he knew who he was he knew god had given
[27:06] all things into his hands he knew he
[27:08] come from god he knew he was going to
[27:09] god he knew that this was the hour's
[27:11] departure he knew all things amen and
[27:14] there was a revelation amen that was
[27:16] going to keep him through dark hours
[27:19] let's turn to
[27:20] luke chapter 18.
[27:30] luke chapter 18.
[27:36] and verse 31 luke 18 31
[27:40] then he took unto him the twelve and
[27:42] said unto them
[27:44] behold we go up to jerusalem and all
[27:46] things that are written by the prophets
[27:48] concerning the son of man shall be
[27:50] accomplished
[27:51] for he shall be delivered unto the
[27:53] gentiles and shall be mocked and
[27:54] spitefully and treated and spitted on
[27:57] and they shall scourge him and put him
[27:59] to death in the third day he shall rise
[28:02] again
[28:03] so you think jesus knew what was going
[28:04] to happen to him
[28:06] i think he had a pretty good indication
[28:08] of what was going to happen to him
[28:10] verse 34 and they understood none of
[28:13] these things
[28:15] and this saying was hid from them
[28:18] neither knew they the things which were
[28:20] spoken
[28:21] that's an amazing this is a
[28:24] verse 34 is an amazing scripture to me
[28:26] because when we read verse 31 through
[28:28] verse 33 it's plain english there's no
[28:31] mincing words he's not speaking in types
[28:34] he's telling them plainly what's going
[28:36] to happen to them and it was as if he
[28:39] spoke nothing amen they understood not
[28:42] amen none of these things they
[28:43] understood none of these things and the
[28:46] saying was hid from them neither knew
[28:48] they things which were spoken it was as
[28:50] if he didn't say anything
[28:52] like it completely they completely
[28:54] missed it amen and and you know for
[28:57] years that has been sections of the
[28:59] message for you and i yeah
[29:01] we've been listening to tapes amen for
[29:03] some of you have been listening to tapes
[29:05] for 40 50 years amen you've been reading
[29:08] books amen and listening to the
[29:09] prophet's message amen but some parts of
[29:12] it was as if you you understood none of
[29:15] it as if nothing had even been spoken
[29:17] amen and then all of a sudden you go
[29:18] back through and you read that and
[29:20] you're like where did that come from
[29:22] amen then you i mean if i don't know if
[29:24] you're like me i'll read something and
[29:26] go whoa
[29:28] then i'll flip it over to read the cover
[29:29] and to see if i've read this message
[29:31] before
[29:32] and i've read it before amen like i've
[29:35] read it a lot
[29:37] but praise be to god amen god has a way
[29:40] of holding things back until the time
[29:43] amen god can close eyes god can open
[29:46] eyes in fact god is the only one who can
[29:48] open eyes we come to this earth with
[29:49] closed eyes amen he's the only one that
[29:52] can open our eyes and here he's speaking
[29:54] to his disciples plainly what is going
[29:56] to happen and i'd like to say the
[29:58] prophet of god has spoken plainly to us
[30:00] what is going to happen amen but but
[30:03] maybe we're still missing parts
[30:06] i mean we would be foolish to say you
[30:09] know we missed some things before but we
[30:10] got it all now
[30:13] the fact that we missed things before
[30:15] amen should lead us to believe that
[30:16] there's a possibility we could be
[30:18] missing things now
[30:20] right that's the logical way to think
[30:21] amen but somehow we're so self-deluded
[30:24] that we think no no no no i mean there
[30:26] were some things yeah there were some
[30:28] things i missed but i caught those now
[30:29] now i got it all
[30:31] right
[30:32] god help us
[30:34] god help us to stay humble
[30:37] brother madam when he comes to the
[30:38] seventh seal amen he says now don't try
[30:41] to figure anything out
[30:44] just live a state he said don't
[30:46] interpret anything
[30:48] just live a simple humble christian life
[30:51] and if he wants you to know anything
[30:52] he'll reveal it to you
[30:55] how easy that is
[30:57] but boy if there's anything that we've
[30:59] ever messed up
[31:00] it was those instructions amen
[31:03] if there's anything we as a people have
[31:05] have
[31:06] failed on it was to do exactly what he
[31:08] said but but brother branham said he
[31:10] goes you're not getting it you're not
[31:12] supposed to get it
[31:14] he knew somehow he knew that it wasn't
[31:17] going to be these people sitting here
[31:20] maybe some of them but as a whole amen
[31:22] that the revelation of this was coming
[31:24] lord that was coming down the pike
[31:26] things were going to open and be
[31:27] revealed and if he wants you to know
[31:29] anything he'll reveal it to you and when
[31:32] he reveals it to you it's plain it's
[31:34] simple it stands out it's absolute it's
[31:36] not this uh it's not this spooky hocus
[31:39] pocus putting odd things together and
[31:41] and maybe it fits no when god reveals
[31:44] something he reveals it you got it you
[31:45] see it
[31:47] and he told us not to do this odd
[31:49] piecing things together and make this
[31:51] complicated way of the word coming to
[31:53] pass and this fits and the thunders are
[31:55] this and this and that no he said just
[31:57] live a simple
[31:58] humble christian life if he wants you to
[32:00] know anything he'll reveal it to you and
[32:02] i say he has done that for his friends
[32:05] he has absolutely revealed things in
[32:07] that word that we never saw before amen
[32:09] and we read it but we didn't see it amen
[32:11] we read it but it wasn't open just like
[32:13] the disciples heard jesus here in luke
[32:15] 18. they he told him plainly but it was
[32:18] as if they he didn't speak i mean they
[32:19] didn't hear anything and we were told
[32:21] plainly what the third pool was plainly
[32:24] what the thunders were but it was as if
[32:26] we didn't hear it remember when when the
[32:28] time came god begins to open it amen and
[32:30] he doesn't open it to everybody at the
[32:31] same time i know some saw it long before
[32:34] others but but praise god when god
[32:36] wanted to open it he opened it amen
[32:40] and he still has that ability
[32:43] so it's not for us to get nervous
[32:47] not to try to figure something out
[32:50] but also we have to be careful that we
[32:54] don't allow our ignorance on a subject
[32:58] to cause us to fear
[33:02] to cause us to doubt
[33:06] just because we don't understand it or
[33:08] don't see it or don't know how this fits
[33:10] into the picture amen things come amen
[33:13] and they happen and maybe we don't know
[33:15] how this fits into what brother venom
[33:17] said we have a an event or something
[33:19] transpires in our life or in a church or
[33:21] in the world and we don't know exactly
[33:23] how to place it amen
[33:26] we've got to be careful that we don't
[33:27] start trying to shove it into spots
[33:29] where it doesn't fit
[33:33] we've got to be very careful we don't
[33:34] start saying drawing conclusions and say
[33:36] well this is that and this is this
[33:39] because that's what's happened with
[33:41] every major conflict in crisis since the
[33:44] prophet left the scene
[33:49] have you been around for a while
[33:54] the gulf war
[33:56] was the rise of babylon crossing
[33:59] the
[34:02] the great river to go and destroy israel
[34:05] it was the beginning of of armageddon
[34:10] did anybody hear that one
[34:12] back in the 90s
[34:14] and we found out it wasn't
[34:16] is that right
[34:19] don't try to figure anything out
[34:21] if god wants to reveal anything he'll
[34:23] reveal it
[34:25] it's not trying to piece things and
[34:27] figure things out and
[34:29] just live a simple humble christian life
[34:32] and the thing that god gives you he will
[34:33] give you at a time to build faith in you
[34:35] to go through whatever you need to go
[34:37] through
[34:38] but when we see things happen we don't
[34:40] know exactly where to fit them and we
[34:41] don't know exactly where to place them
[34:44] then it's time to leave it alone but
[34:45] don't let that don't let our ignorance
[34:48] cause doubt or a fear or a scare i mean
[34:52] sometimes i think there's a temptation
[34:54] to figure this out amen to figure it out
[34:57] so it will bring some level of security
[34:59] for us and the message and blah blah
[35:01] blah my security isn't that i was known
[35:03] by god before the foundation of the
[35:05] world amen and nothing will change that
[35:07] security a true revelation will bring a
[35:10] security that will not that that doesn't
[35:12] have me needing to interpret modern
[35:15] events amen to bring security i already
[35:18] have security there's nothing that can
[35:20] change that security
[35:24] what's happening brother chad i don't
[35:26] know
[35:29] it's birth pains
[35:33] what will happen next
[35:36] more birth pains
[35:38] [Laughter]
[35:43] amen
[35:44] amen but there's going to god is giving
[35:47] a revelation that will hold us through
[35:48] it all amen an understanding that no
[35:51] matter what happens amen we will we will
[35:54] know amen that we are his and that all
[35:56] is under control all is fine and i tell
[35:59] you there's still a lot of material in
[36:01] the message
[36:03] there's still a lot of things in there
[36:05] to be discovered friends there's still a
[36:07] lot that god can unfold amen because
[36:09] it's the word that's why amen how many
[36:11] believe you've come to the end of
[36:13] understanding of your bible
[36:16] i'm glad you didn't raise your hand
[36:19] the bible is the word the message is the
[36:21] word
[36:23] we haven't come to the end of it yet
[36:24] thank god
[36:26] so whatever we have need of the word is
[36:28] there
[36:30] it's in the word and god will reveal it
[36:32] as we have need of it
[36:35] so here
[36:36] he tells them plainly
[36:38] but they understood none of these things
[36:41] and
[36:42] neither knew they the things which were
[36:44] spoken
[36:45] and and god had told them
[36:48] later they could go back and say he told
[36:50] us this
[36:52] amen and it would bring him
[36:53] understanding
[36:55] but jesus himself
[36:57] he had a revelation of who he was
[37:01] now the revelation of who he was was
[37:03] going to have to carry him through
[37:06] amen some difficult times
[37:08] in the message adoption
[37:10] from 1960 brother brahm says when he
[37:13] last cried
[37:15] eli eli my god my god that was a man why
[37:18] hast thou forsaken me speaking of jesus
[37:21] he said in the garden of gethsemane the
[37:23] anointing left him you know he had to
[37:25] die as a sinner he died a sinner you
[37:27] know that not his sins but mine and
[37:29] yours
[37:30] that's where that love came in how he
[37:33] took mine oh hallelujah how he took mine
[37:37] amen let's look at john 19 together
[37:40] let's go back to the book of john
[37:42] and look at john chapter 19.
[37:45] then i'm going to get back to this
[37:47] thought
[37:49] john chapter 19
[37:52] verse 9.
[37:59] john chapter 19 verse 9
[38:01] and when again into the judgment hall
[38:03] and saith unto jesus whence art thou
[38:06] but jesus gave him no answer
[38:08] then said pilate and him speakest thou
[38:10] not unto me knowest thou not that i have
[38:12] power to crucify thee and i have power
[38:15] to release thee jesus answered thou
[38:17] could have us no power at all against me
[38:19] except it were given thee from above
[38:22] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[38:24] hath the greater sin
[38:27] this is an answer from somebody who's
[38:29] confident
[38:30] and who they are
[38:33] he's been
[38:34] captured
[38:35] he's been arrested
[38:37] he's been taken he's been he's been
[38:40] through one trial already uh in caiaphas
[38:43] house he's been beaten he's been carried
[38:45] off and delivered to the romans he
[38:48] everybody who swore they would stay with
[38:50] him has left him
[38:52] he's all alone nobody to send him nobody
[38:55] to stand with him he's in the hands of
[38:57] enemies amen he's standing before pilate
[39:01] and pilate is asking him to defend
[39:03] himself and he won't say anything he's
[39:06] asking him questions he won't answer
[39:07] amen because he already knows what needs
[39:10] to happen he doesn't need to get himself
[39:12] out of this situation this is the
[39:14] situation he was ordained for
[39:17] he doesn't need to bypass this amen he
[39:19] already wrestled that out in gethsemane
[39:21] with the with the human side he was
[39:24] wrestling out lord is there another way
[39:26] amen and when he when god would show him
[39:28] no other way he already surrendered and
[39:31] yielded to god's way and he already knew
[39:33] it was god's way
[39:35] he had already spoken luke 18 what was
[39:37] going to happen he already knew he was
[39:39] going to be turned over he was going to
[39:40] be scourged he was going to be spitted
[39:42] upon and crucified he already knew that
[39:44] he was going to be killed amen but in
[39:46] the garden of gethsemane he begins to
[39:48] ask god is there any other way amen and
[39:50] god is allowing us to see that when he
[39:53] came in human flesh he came in human
[39:55] flesh amen to feel amen what we would
[39:58] feel and he begins to wrestle this out
[40:00] with his own will and saying god is
[40:02] there any other way and when no other
[40:04] way was present he yielded to the way
[40:06] that he knew was the only way and he
[40:08] said not my will but thy will be done
[40:11] and when he surrendered to god's way now
[40:13] he's in the channel now amen he's being
[40:16] swept into the fulfillment of prophecy
[40:18] and they come and they arrest him and
[40:20] they scourge him and they do all of
[40:21] these things and he's standing before
[40:23] pilate and he knows what his father
[40:25] wants he knows he's in the will of god
[40:27] he know that all things are in his hand
[40:30] that he he told peter he says no you not
[40:33] that i could call for legions of angels
[40:35] to deliver me
[40:39] but he wouldn't do it because he knew it
[40:41] wasn't the will of god he had the power
[40:43] to do it but he had not been given
[40:45] permission by god to do it
[40:48] see to me this is this is real
[40:52] power with character that's fit to rule
[40:55] he had the power to call for legions of
[40:57] angels to deliver him but he had the
[40:59] character to stay with the
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:03] [Music]
[41:05] the word told him there's no other way
[41:07] he wasn't going to exercise any of his
[41:09] power or authority to bring another way
[41:13] even though all things had already been
[41:14] delivered into his hands
[41:17] and so he's going he's following after
[41:20] the word
[41:22] and he's a and he's in obedience to his
[41:25] father and now instead of answering
[41:27] there's nothing for him to answer
[41:29] because he
[41:31] is he defendable yes
[41:34] is he innocent yes
[41:36] could he give a good testimony
[41:38] absolutely could he unravel the trial
[41:40] without question
[41:43] without question
[41:44] he's not guilty he could defend himself
[41:47] he he has a right to answer for himself
[41:50] because he's done nothing wrong amen but
[41:52] he forfeits his right to take the will
[41:54] of god and he stands there in silence
[41:56] because he doesn't want to change the
[41:58] outcome because the outcome is god's
[42:00] will
[42:03] i said god help me to grow into this
[42:06] kind of character
[42:08] to where i want your his will and his
[42:10] word more than i want anything else in
[42:12] my life
[42:13] [Music]
[42:14] and so he he says you know why won't you
[42:17] answer don't you know now pada says
[42:19] don't you know i have the power
[42:23] he doesn't even know who he's talking to
[42:26] you know i have the power to say the i
[42:28] have the power to crucify thee and he
[42:30] says you have no power unless it was
[42:33] given to you from above
[42:36] and then he pronounces his own judgment
[42:40] the one who delivered to me to you is in
[42:41] greater sin than you
[42:44] because the judge was on the scene
[42:47] and he knew what was happening
[42:49] so jesus
[42:51] had a revelation
[42:53] that would hold him
[42:55] he wasn't looking for a way out wasn't
[42:58] looking to be rescued
[43:00] he was willing to walk every step god
[43:04] wanted him to walk
[43:07] in the message it is the rising of the
[43:09] sun he says
[43:10] now notice this quickening power zoe
[43:12] bring the word the mind that was in
[43:14] christ was in you then
[43:16] i'm trying to show you that when you
[43:18] raised when god raised jesus from the
[43:20] dead he raised up you also and also
[43:23] quickened the life with him you are now
[43:25] quickened to life although then you were
[43:28] but an attribute in his thoughts but god
[43:30] had saw all in him at the finish see
[43:34] when god looked down upon the body
[43:36] the spirit left him in the garden of
[43:38] gethsemane he had to die a man remember
[43:40] friends he didn't have to do that that
[43:42] was god god anointed that flesh which
[43:45] was human flesh and he didn't if he had
[43:47] went up there as god he'd have never
[43:49] died that kind of death can't kill god
[43:51] but he didn't have to do it jesus chose
[43:54] the will of god
[43:56] but remember he went there with you in
[43:58] him see god had never separated the
[44:00] bride from the groom yet so when god
[44:02] looked down upon the body of christ he
[44:04] saw both male and female it was all
[44:06] redeemed in that one body see they are
[44:08] one same same word the same word spoke
[44:11] of the groom speaks of the bride
[44:14] so now he's going to tie the the bride
[44:17] in here she was with him when he went to
[44:19] calvary amen and
[44:22] he held his peace and didn't say
[44:24] anything because he had to pay the price
[44:25] of redemption amen and he was not alone
[44:29] he was the fullness of the word so all
[44:31] the attributes all the thoughts of god
[44:33] was wrapped up in that body of flesh
[44:35] which means there's a portion of that's
[44:37] in you today that was there then
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] and i'm standing here today so glad he
[44:43] yielded so glad he didn't speak so glad
[44:46] that he took it amen and didn't try to
[44:48] maneuver a way out and didn't use the
[44:50] power of gifts that were in his hands
[44:52] but he submitted himself to the will of
[44:54] the father because i was there amen and
[44:57] i do not have to go through tribulation
[44:59] because he endured tribulation for me i
[45:01] do not have to shed my blood in
[45:03] tribulation like the foolish version of
[45:05] 144 thousand because i already paid for
[45:07] my sins when i was with him at calvary
[45:10] [Applause]
[45:11] so i get to bypass that in the flesh
[45:13] because i was there in that flesh
[45:16] i'm so glad he was yielded i'm so glad
[45:19] he was obedient i'm so glad he was
[45:21] surrendered
[45:24] amen
[45:27] amen
[45:29] but
[45:30] the very fact
[45:32] that we were there
[45:35] makes it possible
[45:37] for us to endure now
[45:41] jesus went there with a tremendous
[45:44] revelation of who he was
[45:46] he knew that all things were given to
[45:49] him by god all things were in his hands
[45:50] and he came from god and he went to god
[45:53] i'm telling you that's a tremendous
[45:54] revelation
[45:56] and if we can catch that same revelation
[45:58] we can endure anything amen
[46:01] let's turn to ephesians chapter one
[46:10] i want to take our time and go through a
[46:11] few scriptures here
[46:13] together ephesians chapter 1
[46:22] see we see
[46:25] all through the scriptures
[46:27] really
[46:28] if we take the scriptures as our
[46:30] textbook
[46:32] for life
[46:34] how many believe we should take the
[46:35] bible as our textbook for life
[46:42] god never came
[46:44] to bring a revelation to a people
[46:48] to give them
[46:50] so much peace
[46:52] that they entered into frolic and play
[46:56] where do you see it in the scriptures
[46:58] but god always brings a revelation to
[47:01] the people at a time that they need a
[47:03] revelation to go through his plan and
[47:05] through his will
[47:07] they have to pass through difficult
[47:09] waters and go through difficult things
[47:11] amen
[47:12] and god gives them a revelation that
[47:14] will sustain them amen
[47:16] and let's look at ephesians chapter one
[47:18] verse three
[47:21] said blessed be the god and father of
[47:22] our lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[47:24] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[47:26] places in christ
[47:28] according as he has chosen us in him
[47:30] before the foundation of the world
[47:33] that we should be holy
[47:34] and without blame before him in love
[47:37] having predestinated us unto the
[47:39] adoption of children by jesus christ
[47:41] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:43] of his will
[47:44] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[47:46] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[47:48] beloved in whom we have redemption
[47:51] through his blood the forgiveness of
[47:52] sins according to the riches of his
[47:54] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[47:57] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[47:59] known unto us the mystery of his will
[48:01] according to his good pleasure which he
[48:03] hath purposed in himself
[48:05] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[48:07] of times he might gather together in one
[48:09] all things in christ both with both
[48:11] which are in heaven and which are on
[48:13] earth even in him
[48:15] in whom also we have obtained an
[48:16] inheritance being predestinated
[48:18] according to the purpose of him who
[48:20] worketh all things after the council of
[48:23] his own will
[48:24] that we should be to the praise of his
[48:26] glory who first trusted in christ
[48:30] so we have been predestinated amen
[48:33] god has elected us and chosen us before
[48:35] the foundation of the world according to
[48:37] the good pleasure of his will
[48:40] for his purpose amen that's why everyone
[48:42] was elected that's why we were
[48:44] predestinated for his purpose not for
[48:46] ours but for his
[48:49] amen in in the message israel in the
[48:52] church from 1953
[48:54] he says now before you can become a
[48:56] christian god called you not you calling
[48:58] god
[49:00] god called you now he called abraham and
[49:03] he's the father
[49:04] of us all
[49:06] the faith notice now he said abraham now
[49:10] now it's election i want to get on that
[49:13] election strong because it's the truth
[49:15] now you didn't you didn't become a
[49:17] christian just coincidence because you
[49:19] became a christian before you was in
[49:20] this world
[49:24] what
[49:24] you became a christian before you was in
[49:26] this world
[49:27] before you was born as a baby
[49:30] you were ordained to be a christian
[49:34] before you were born god ordained you to
[49:36] be a christian from the garden of eden
[49:38] from before the foundation of the world
[49:40] all you say is that right brother that's
[49:42] the truth god before there was ever you
[49:44] knowed anything
[49:46] there was a time
[49:47] that you knew
[49:49] now listen what he's saying
[49:50] before you knew anything he before you
[49:53] knew anything god called you to be a
[49:54] christian from the garden of eden before
[49:56] the foundation of the world god ordained
[49:58] you to be a christian now listen he says
[50:00] there was a time that you knew
[50:04] your mind is darkened to that now
[50:09] there's only been one man on the earth
[50:10] that knew that he was before and that
[50:12] was jesus he said glorify me father with
[50:14] the glory that i had with you before the
[50:16] foundation of the world he was the
[50:18] incarnate god he could move back there
[50:20] and know what it was but our minds are
[50:22] blackened there
[50:24] but we were ordained predestinated you
[50:26] know what predestination means the
[50:28] destination of anything was pre-sold by
[50:30] god amen that's not skilled milk now
[50:33] notice i believe that stumped you
[50:35] we better go over there just a minute
[50:37] turn over with me to ephesians the first
[50:39] chapter and let's just read just a
[50:41] little because i'm afraid you're missing
[50:43] that and just think that that i'm saying
[50:45] that i'm not listen closely now we get
[50:48] down to the church in a few minutes a
[50:50] few moments or after a bit
[50:52] now paul is speaking addressing
[50:54] ephesians 1 directly straight to the
[50:55] shoulder to the church that's what we're
[50:57] doing tonight this is not for babies
[51:00] this is for grown-ups not for babies
[51:02] little babies i got a little one back
[51:04] there just learning to walk he'd boop
[51:06] and fall down and get back up and he
[51:08] thought he was doing something great i
[51:10] was that way one day but now i'm a man
[51:12] i'll put away childish things now we got
[51:15] to come to full doctrine i like good old
[51:18] shout meetings where we just clap our
[51:19] hands and shout and have a good time
[51:21] have great powerful services and things
[51:23] dance on the bubble as it were but wait
[51:26] then when the showdown time comes you
[51:28] don't know where you're standing
[51:30] let's get back and find out let's find
[51:33] out what's making us do that let's get
[51:35] back to the foundation see where we're
[51:37] at
[51:39] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[51:41] will of god and he's reading right now
[51:43] the beginning of ephesians
[51:45] he goes i just love that no seminary
[51:47] sent me out the will of god to them
[51:49] which are at ephesus now watch he
[51:51] addresses it to the faithful in jesus
[51:54] christ watch addressing it straight to
[51:56] who not to center not to babies but to
[51:59] them that's grown up
[52:02] you see
[52:03] god
[52:04] never asked paul if he wanted to be the
[52:06] first church age messenger
[52:09] you remember when brother abraham was
[52:10] here he was talking about brother
[52:11] branham being a victim amen he said
[52:13] leave the man alone he's a victim
[52:16] because abraham never asked to be the
[52:18] father of faith
[52:20] abraham wasn't praying and said god make
[52:22] me the father of faith god choose me and
[52:25] bring a nation out of my life and
[52:27] abraham never prayed that it wasn't in
[52:29] abraham's mind it wasn't abraham's
[52:30] desire it was the will of god that came
[52:32] down and called abraham and told him to
[52:34] come and separate from his people it
[52:36] wasn't it wasn't abraham's idea and you
[52:39] can see abraham didn't even want to
[52:41] separate from his people
[52:43] it wasn't like abraham was sick of his
[52:45] country and wanted to get out of here
[52:46] and say god can i leave and god comes
[52:48] down and says yes
[52:51] abraham took his father along and took
[52:52] lot along amen and we understand the
[52:55] story but abraham didn't pick himself
[52:57] god chose abraham from before the
[52:59] foundation of the world
[53:01] amen david never asked to be a king
[53:06] amen
[53:07] david
[53:08] i mean we don't know what david's
[53:09] ambitions were in life i mean he was
[53:11] just a young lad keeping his father's
[53:13] sheep amen tending the sheep worshiping
[53:16] god on the backside of the desert i
[53:18] don't know what his dreams or ambitions
[53:20] were i mean i don't know what if he
[53:22] wanted to keep tending sheep inherit his
[53:24] father's inheritance get married live in
[53:26] bethlehem who knows what he wanted amen
[53:29] but it didn't matter what he wanted what
[53:30] mattered is what god wanted for him amen
[53:33] and he sent a prophet one day to say
[53:35] you're the next anointed king over
[53:36] israel without asking him if he wanted
[53:38] to do it or not
[53:42] [Music]
[53:43] god never asked brother abra brother
[53:45] branham if he wanted to be the seventh
[53:47] angel
[53:48] would you like to be the seventh angel
[53:51] no he never asked him he just called him
[53:54] that's what he was amen and god called
[53:56] him and ordained him and anointed him
[53:58] for such a work and let him amen and he
[54:01] never asked you if you wanted to be
[54:02] bride
[54:05] right
[54:06] no matter how much we want to be the
[54:08] bride of jesus christ our great desire
[54:10] what gratitude we have amen it was never
[54:13] originated with our idea it originated
[54:16] with god and god designed it this way
[54:18] god ordained it this way god called you
[54:21] you didn't call yourself you never asked
[54:23] to be the bride he called you bride
[54:28] amen
[54:31] and so when we come to this
[54:32] understanding it brings us this
[54:34] revelation brings us a strength amen i
[54:37] wasn't my idea to be bright it was god's
[54:40] idea i didn't call myself to this he
[54:42] called me to this and when you come to
[54:44] that understanding there's a revelation
[54:46] that settles in amen and whatever god
[54:48] wants me to do to portray my portion of
[54:51] the bride of jesus christ then that's
[54:53] what we'll do amen because he ordained
[54:55] it before the foundation of the world
[54:57] nothing can stop that expression and i
[55:00] don't want to alter it in any way
[55:07] so you see
[55:11] the elect
[55:12] predestinated c gene of god
[55:16] are different
[55:18] others might get to choose
[55:21] those who come at the white throne
[55:23] judgment they may choose to do good and
[55:25] choose to align with it
[55:27] but you didn't get the pick
[55:30] he chose before the foundation of the
[55:32] world
[55:33] is that right
[55:37] in the message adoption 1960
[55:41] he said
[55:42] so beautifully displayed in the prodigal
[55:45] son i was lost this is my son
[55:48] he was lost and now he's found he was
[55:50] dead and he's alive again bring forth
[55:52] the fatted calf and the best robe a ring
[55:54] and put it on his finger
[55:55] no wonder when the morning stars sing
[55:57] together and the sons of god shout her
[55:59] for joy
[56:01] when they seen the plan of salvation
[56:04] god putting your name on the book before
[56:06] the foundation of the world amen
[56:12] brother branham said you knew once
[56:16] but you're darkened to that now
[56:18] is that right
[56:20] and he said
[56:21] no wonder and he's typing it with the
[56:23] prodigal son returning no wonder when
[56:26] the morning stars staying together and
[56:27] the sons of god shouted for joy
[56:30] when they seen the plan of salvation so
[56:33] that means before the foundation of the
[56:34] world they seen the plan of salvation
[56:37] was god putting your name on the book
[56:40] before the foundation of the world
[56:43] and it caused a shouting and it caused a
[56:46] rejoicing
[56:47] is that right
[56:50] let's look at a couple more quotes
[56:52] 1955 beginning and ending of the gentile
[56:55] dispensation
[56:56] see we come out of eternity we was
[57:00] before there was a world did you know
[57:01] that god made man in his own image where
[57:04] was you he said to job when job thought
[57:07] he had some wisdom he said where was you
[57:09] when i laid the foundation of the world
[57:10] before i laid it when the sons of god
[57:12] sang together and the morning started
[57:14] shout out for joy the morning star
[57:16] shouted for joy them shining ones
[57:19] listen to this them shining ones shouted
[57:22] for joy when they seen that someday they
[57:25] would tabernacle here on earth
[57:29] what a quote
[57:31] them shining one shouted for joy when
[57:34] they seen that someday they would
[57:36] tabernacle here on earth
[57:39] and the king melchizedek would come in
[57:41] the righteousness of god and give his
[57:43] life to redeem us to god back again
[57:46] and outshine the stars forever
[57:48] and ever
[57:50] amen
[57:53] brother madam is in 1960s and preaching
[57:56] the rejected king and he was in the
[57:58] hospital for some tests and the nurses
[58:00] speaking to him and
[58:02] and she asked him a question about a
[58:04] denomination and here's what he said i
[58:06] said oh i belong to the oldest
[58:08] denomination there is.
[58:11] and she said what denomination is that i
[58:14] said it's the one that was organized
[58:16] before the world was ever organized
[58:19] oh she said what i don't believe i know
[58:21] just that she said i belong to a certain
[58:23] church is that is it that organization
[58:26] i said no ma'am
[58:28] that was only about 200 years ago that
[58:30] organized but this organization started
[58:33] when the morning star sang together and
[58:34] the sons of god shouted for joy when
[58:37] they seen the coming of a savior to
[58:38] redeem mankind
[58:41] amen are you part of that organization
[58:44] hallelujah the oldest one that was
[58:46] organized before the world was organized
[58:48] amen that's the one brother ben said he
[58:50] was a part of that's the one the true
[58:52] elector a part of amen
[58:56] amen let's look at romans chapter 8.
[59:03] romans chapter 8
[59:05] verse 28.
[59:14] romans 8 28
[59:15] we know that all things work together
[59:17] for good to them that love god to them
[59:19] who are the called according to his
[59:22] purpose
[59:24] for whom he did for no he also did
[59:26] predestinate to be conformed to the
[59:29] image of his son that he might be the
[59:31] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[59:33] whom he did predestinate them he also
[59:35] called whom he called then he also
[59:37] justified whom he justified them he also
[59:40] glorified
[59:42] what shall we then say to these things
[59:44] if god before us who can be against us
[59:49] all things
[59:51] work together for good
[59:53] to them
[59:54] that love god to them who are the
[59:58] called
[59:59] that little v is so important in that
[1:00:01] scripture
[1:00:03] to them that are the called according to
[1:00:06] his purpose
[1:00:08] we are the called but remember we're the
[1:00:10] called according to his purpose
[1:00:12] and we're here to fulfill his purpose
[1:00:15] not our purpose his purpose
[1:00:20] and
[1:00:21] and i'd like to just say this say this
[1:00:25] we have no right to complain
[1:00:29] we have no reason to fuss about
[1:00:31] circumstances in our lives no right to
[1:00:33] complain about things that are happening
[1:00:35] oh we're guilty of it i'm guilty of it i
[1:00:38] i'm ashamed of myself sometimes how
[1:00:39] quickly i start spouting off at the
[1:00:41] mouth and have to go back and say god
[1:00:43] forgive me for that amen so we're guilty
[1:00:46] but we need to come to a higher
[1:00:47] revelation amen we need to climb just a
[1:00:50] little bit higher and say god ordained
[1:00:52] my life before the foundation of the
[1:00:54] world and god already showed a movie
[1:00:59] and i already watched the movie
[1:01:04] is that true
[1:01:06] god showed the plan of salvation
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:11] the sons of god shouted for joy when
[1:01:13] they solved the plan of salvation
[1:01:15] are you a son of god
[1:01:18] i mean that means at some point he
[1:01:20] showed you the plan of salvation
[1:01:23] and you rejoiced and shouted over you
[1:01:25] thought it was a great plan
[1:01:29] praise god that's wonderful that's
[1:01:30] exactly perfect it's just right amen so
[1:01:33] now we come into the world in spiritual
[1:01:35] amnesia that part is blocked off to us
[1:01:37] we don't remember that amen so now we're
[1:01:39] down here crying why are you crying you
[1:01:41] already watched the movie you already
[1:01:43] said that's a good plan that's the right
[1:01:45] way to do it i agree praise god
[1:01:47] wonderful hallelujah and down here we're
[1:01:49] going why is this happening to me
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] we need the revelation that's been given
[1:02:01] in this hour no church age ever knew
[1:02:04] this amen they never been given what
[1:02:06] we've been given amen they never
[1:02:08] realized to what extent we're
[1:02:10] predestinated they've never realized
[1:02:11] what god had done before amen and where
[1:02:14] we were before and how we've come to
[1:02:16] this amen and that's not just uh to
[1:02:19] tickle our ears that's not to give us
[1:02:20] something exciting to talk about or a
[1:02:22] point of differentiation to
[1:02:24] differentiate us between the
[1:02:25] denomination that was given to us to
[1:02:27] give us a higher revelation to live a
[1:02:29] higher life amen
[1:02:31] just like jesus was given a clear
[1:02:33] understanding of who he was amen he was
[1:02:35] given a clear revelation of who he was
[1:02:38] and what god's plan was and what purpose
[1:02:40] he was fulfilling so that when the time
[1:02:42] got tough he could just surrender and
[1:02:44] move right in with god's plan never
[1:02:46] speaking back to pilate never answering
[1:02:48] for himself never accusing those who are
[1:02:50] accusing him but just walking in
[1:02:52] submission to the plan of god a higher
[1:02:55] revelation held him through it all
[1:02:58] and there's a reason we've been given so
[1:03:00] much in this day not so that we can
[1:03:02] complain not so that we can uh run to
[1:03:05] and fro every time circumstances get
[1:03:07] tough
[1:03:08] so we could settle down and say i don't
[1:03:10] know what's happening but i know it's in
[1:03:12] the plan of god i know it's for his
[1:03:15] purpose and i know that i was happy
[1:03:17] about this at some point
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:23] when god first revealed to me the plan
[1:03:26] of salvation when i was an attribute in
[1:03:28] his mind i said good plan father
[1:03:32] so now i don't want to say anything
[1:03:34] different
[1:03:37] in the message spiritual amnesia from
[1:03:38] 1964
[1:03:40] brother branham says now to be a true
[1:03:42] christian you have to be the same we
[1:03:44] don't want to forget that all that he
[1:03:47] was i'm identified with him i'm
[1:03:49] identified with him
[1:03:51] notice and he is in me and i in him
[1:03:53] notice then every christian that's a
[1:03:55] real genuine christian was with him when
[1:03:58] the morning star sang together and the
[1:04:00] sons of god shouted for joy were you are
[1:04:02] you a real christian
[1:04:05] let's read this again
[1:04:08] every christian that's a real genuine
[1:04:10] christian was with him when the morning
[1:04:13] stars sang together and the sons of god
[1:04:15] shouted for joy before there was a
[1:04:16] foundation in the world we were
[1:04:18] identified in the immortal realms with
[1:04:20] god 10 million years before the world
[1:04:22] was ever formed i was back there with
[1:04:25] him if i got eternal life i was there
[1:04:27] with him i was identified with him when
[1:04:29] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:04:31] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:04:35] amen brother branham brings it on down
[1:04:36] the line and says i was with him when
[1:04:39] abraham was manifesting i was with him
[1:04:41] when jacob he goes through all the
[1:04:43] characters of the bible and joseph and
[1:04:45] all of that and moses
[1:04:46] then he comes out and says what every
[1:04:48] christian has been
[1:04:50] what every believer has been
[1:04:52] every believer now is identified with
[1:04:54] the same person
[1:04:57] so when the word was coming through the
[1:04:59] bible is a record of the word of god
[1:05:01] coming into manifestation
[1:05:03] through the lives of people
[1:05:06] when it was in moses i was there because
[1:05:08] i'm part of the word that was the word
[1:05:11] all right i'm identified with that
[1:05:13] because that was word and i'm word
[1:05:17] so what are the words in the book
[1:05:20] the believers
[1:05:22] what is the book the record of christ
[1:05:25] what are the words in the book the
[1:05:27] believers
[1:05:28] so it's one book
[1:05:30] and i'm part of that book
[1:05:33] so if you flip to the to the beginning
[1:05:35] of the book and you say there's moses
[1:05:36] it's the same book that i am amen we're
[1:05:38] the we're in the same thing together
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] he says
[1:05:47] i'm identified with that same person
[1:05:48] whatever it is you must be identified
[1:05:51] don't forget that when you do you've got
[1:05:54] spiritual amnesia you've forgotten who
[1:05:56] you are
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] we start going through trials and
[1:06:02] tribulations amen that's been out of
[1:06:04] this book before amen you can say the
[1:06:07] word that's in me amen this word that
[1:06:10] i'm a part of has already conquered this
[1:06:13] already conquered it in moses already
[1:06:15] conquered into three hebrew children
[1:06:17] already conquered it here and conquered
[1:06:19] it there conquered it there i'm part of
[1:06:21] that same word the word has already
[1:06:23] overcome this there's nothing for me to
[1:06:25] worry about i can look at the book and
[1:06:27] i'm identified with that victory so
[1:06:29] today there's nothing different there's
[1:06:31] no problem amen
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] praise be to god
[1:06:36] and if we forget that
[1:06:38] then we got spiritual amnesia
[1:06:41] we forgot who you are
[1:06:45] sometimes i'm surprised in me
[1:06:47] at the lingering effects of amnesia
[1:06:51] i get surprised at my own self how on
[1:06:54] sunday we remember it all
[1:06:57] right during the preaching of the word
[1:06:59] when brother was laying it out you were
[1:07:00] in god before the foundation of the
[1:07:02] world you're a part of god you can no
[1:07:04] more be lost and god can be god and
[1:07:05] you're amen hallelujah you sound just
[1:07:07] like you did before the foundation of
[1:07:09] the world when he showed you the plan of
[1:07:10] salvation
[1:07:12] and then monday morning you go to start
[1:07:14] the card it won't start and you forgot
[1:07:15] you're a son of god and you forgot
[1:07:17] you're in the mind of god and you forgot
[1:07:18] all things work together for good
[1:07:23] i hope i'm not the only one because i'm
[1:07:24] this is very exposing if i'm the only
[1:07:26] one
[1:07:29] and all of a sudden we we slip right as
[1:07:32] soon as it goes click click
[1:07:35] spiritual amnesia creeps right back in
[1:07:39] the lingering effects of spiritual
[1:07:40] amnesia instead of allowing a higher
[1:07:43] revelation to stop and say god's doing
[1:07:45] something it's all under control i don't
[1:07:48] have to fret it's going to be okay
[1:07:51] and and you know what you don't even
[1:07:53] have to be a son of god to know it's
[1:07:54] going to be okay the battery's dead or
[1:07:56] starters i mean it's going to be fine
[1:07:59] it's good don't worry
[1:08:00] it's going to be okay
[1:08:02] but how quickly we slip in to you know
[1:08:05] grumbling complaining moaning and
[1:08:07] groaning and and we went from having the
[1:08:09] most wonderful existence on this earth
[1:08:11] on sunday to now our life is miserable
[1:08:13] nothing ever works out for me and
[1:08:16] but sunday you were a son of god and
[1:08:18] then the whole thing plan was
[1:08:19] orchestrated for you amen
[1:08:22] and now your car won't start or somebody
[1:08:23] else got the promotion or there's going
[1:08:25] to be a layoff and your life never works
[1:08:27] out it works out for everybody else
[1:08:28] never works out for me and why doesn't
[1:08:30] god like me and
[1:08:35] i said we got to have a higher
[1:08:37] revelation amen the word that came in
[1:08:39] this day was to bring us higher than
[1:08:41] that amen it was to bring us out of that
[1:08:43] if we can't take that how are we going
[1:08:46] to take squeeze pressure things binding
[1:08:48] or tying up or our brother bam said
[1:08:50] they'll close your churches amen and
[1:08:52] they'll prevent the ministers from
[1:08:54] preaching when i don't know how i don't
[1:08:56] know for how long i don't know i mean
[1:08:59] what will we see what we don't see i
[1:09:00] don't know but how will we ever endure
[1:09:02] that if we can't take all these little
[1:09:04] things in our life and cause us to come
[1:09:07] down from a higher revelation back to
[1:09:09] carnal thinking back to being
[1:09:12] troubled and bound by the things of the
[1:09:14] world amen this message has been given
[1:09:16] to us was for the eagles to fly higher
[1:09:19] and in the higher realm all of a sudden
[1:09:22] everything in the carnal starts coming
[1:09:23] into perspective
[1:09:27] and so we have the message to lift us
[1:09:29] above this amen we've got the word of
[1:09:30] god to give us a vantage point that the
[1:09:33] rest of the world doesn't have so that
[1:09:35] we don't forget who we are so that the
[1:09:38] lingering effects of spiritual amnesia
[1:09:40] don't creep back in with every trial in
[1:09:42] every circumstance so that we can stay
[1:09:45] sons of god all the time
[1:09:52] so
[1:09:54] let's look at john 15 together
[1:09:58] i just want to reinforce this idea of
[1:10:00] the sons of god shouting for joy
[1:10:03] seeing the plan of salvation
[1:10:13] this is why
[1:10:14] there's nothing i'm telling you today
[1:10:16] you haven't heard before but this is why
[1:10:17] we'll preach this over and over and over
[1:10:20] again because we've got to fly higher
[1:10:23] we've got to break out of the cardinal
[1:10:25] we've got to get past our flesh we've
[1:10:27] got to start seeing things the way the
[1:10:29] message paints them for us
[1:10:32] john 15
[1:10:34] 26
[1:10:36] but when the comforters come whom i will
[1:10:38] send unto you from the father even the
[1:10:40] spirit of truth which proceedeth from
[1:10:42] the father he shall testify of me
[1:10:45] and he also shall bear witness because
[1:10:47] you have been with me
[1:10:48] from the beginning
[1:10:51] the question is what beginning
[1:10:54] hallelujah
[1:10:58] brother branham says in the message
[1:10:59] serpent seed from 1958 dear god the
[1:11:02] great and mighty god who formed all
[1:11:04] things by the power of his spirit and
[1:11:06] has brought jesus christ his only
[1:11:07] begotten son who freely died for sinners
[1:11:10] the just for the unjust to reconcile us
[1:11:12] back unto his marvelous fellowship that
[1:11:15] we have again with god as we are taught
[1:11:17] in the blessed word that we had
[1:11:19] fellowship with him before the
[1:11:20] foundation of the world
[1:11:22] so brother said we're taught in this
[1:11:24] blessed word that we had fellowship with
[1:11:26] him before the foundation of the world
[1:11:30] where did jesus say that
[1:11:35] you have been with me from the beginning
[1:11:39] he tells him you'll be witnesses because
[1:11:41] you've been with me from the beginning i
[1:11:43] want to ask you why are you a witness
[1:11:44] today amen
[1:11:47] i think for the same reason
[1:11:50] it says as we are taught in the blessed
[1:11:51] word that we had fellowship with him
[1:11:53] before the foundation of the world when
[1:11:54] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:11:56] sons of god shouted for joy way back
[1:11:59] before the foundation of the world how
[1:12:01] do we know that that wasn't at the same
[1:12:03] time that the lamb was slain
[1:12:05] that when god in his great thinking seen
[1:12:07] us shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:12:09] salvation through jesus
[1:12:11] praise be to god
[1:12:13] later in the same message he says
[1:12:14] further down he says he never said he'd
[1:12:17] done it in the shadow he potentially
[1:12:18] done it the bible said he paid tithes
[1:12:21] amen he's talking now about levi paying
[1:12:23] tithes and
[1:12:24] abraham then if we come through the
[1:12:26] right seat when paul preached the gospel
[1:12:28] i was there and you were there
[1:12:31] is that right
[1:12:34] maybe that's why we can believe paul's
[1:12:36] gospel when others have rejected it
[1:12:41] we're going to get into that just in a
[1:12:43] minute plumb up to our ears notice
[1:12:45] that's what the scripture claims to us
[1:12:47] it even went way back just think levi
[1:12:50] then jacob his father than isaac his
[1:12:52] father then abraham his father his
[1:12:54] great-grandfather when levi was in the
[1:12:56] loins of his great-grandfather he paid
[1:12:58] ties to melchizedek
[1:12:59] i want to ask you who is this job
[1:13:02] 27 38 when he said where was you when i
[1:13:05] laid the foundation of the earth when
[1:13:06] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:13:08] sons of god shouted for joy who were
[1:13:10] those sons of god that was shouting for
[1:13:12] joy jesus told them that i had joy with
[1:13:15] you before the foundation of the world
[1:13:17] we're not creatures of time we're
[1:13:19] creatures of eternity
[1:13:21] no man can come to me except my father
[1:13:23] draws him and all that comes to me i'll
[1:13:25] give him them eternal life and raise him
[1:13:27] up at the last days no one can pluck
[1:13:29] them from my father's hand he gives them
[1:13:31] to me how are you going to lose see
[1:13:34] you're scared you're afraid you'll run
[1:13:36] around and that's one of the best
[1:13:38] evidences in the world that you haven't
[1:13:40] been nowhere yet
[1:13:42] that's right
[1:13:44] when you get scared you get afraid and
[1:13:47] you run around
[1:13:49] that's the best evidence in the world
[1:13:51] that you haven't been nowhere yet
[1:13:54] i said god take me a little further
[1:13:57] than what i've been
[1:13:59] go to john chapter 6.
[1:14:09] verse 44.
[1:14:11] it's amazing how the message came to
[1:14:14] reveal the bible
[1:14:19] now we have to
[1:14:21] allow the message
[1:14:23] to teach us the bible
[1:14:25] because if we don't let the message
[1:14:27] teach us the bible we're still letting
[1:14:28] the baptist teach us the bible
[1:14:33] we have to be careful or we're still
[1:14:35] letting the pentecostals teach us the
[1:14:36] bible or we're still letting the
[1:14:38] methodist teach us the bible
[1:14:40] because remember they they in each in
[1:14:43] each of those uh ages they would get
[1:14:46] another glimpse of light another nugget
[1:14:48] but everything else was still obscure
[1:14:51] they would get one truth amen and that
[1:14:53] truth would break them into another
[1:14:55] revival amen and bring them higher in
[1:14:57] the things of god but we have to stop
[1:15:00] reading the bible with the baptist
[1:15:03] understanding or a pentecost or a
[1:15:04] methodist understanding of the bible and
[1:15:06] we've got to allow the message to teach
[1:15:09] us the bible
[1:15:11] and that's why it's so foolish for
[1:15:13] somebody to try to use the message or
[1:15:16] the bible to correct brother branham
[1:15:20] it's it's ludicrous in ways because god
[1:15:23] sent the message to teach us the bible
[1:15:25] to illuminate the word to show us what's
[1:15:27] been hiding in this word for thousands
[1:15:30] of years he brought up he brought a
[1:15:32] prophet to be an interpreter of the word
[1:15:36] to show us even brother branham would
[1:15:38] tell us in his day the contemporaries
[1:15:40] were saying brother ben was a good man
[1:15:41] he has a good gift amen we believe he's
[1:15:43] a prophet of god and he says when he's
[1:15:45] and when he's discerning and he's
[1:15:46] praying for the sick you can go but when
[1:15:48] he starts teaching leave because he's
[1:15:49] off the word and brother man said you
[1:15:51] don't even know you don't even know what
[1:15:52] a prophet is you don't even know what
[1:15:54] i'm here for
[1:15:56] so we we have to
[1:15:58] we have to let the
[1:16:00] we have to let the prophet of god the
[1:16:02] message of the hour
[1:16:03] give us the correct interpretation of
[1:16:05] the word
[1:16:08] because if not we won't understand what
[1:16:10] brother brahm's saying
[1:16:13] he makes these statements and we don't
[1:16:14] understand what he's saying because
[1:16:16] every time we read the word our mind is
[1:16:18] adjusted to a formal understanding
[1:16:21] of what we're reading
[1:16:23] and we have to let the message keep
[1:16:25] breaking that away from us
[1:16:28] john chapter 6 verse 44.
[1:16:34] no man can come to me except the father
[1:16:36] which has sent me draw him and i will
[1:16:37] raise him up at the last day
[1:16:40] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:16:41] shall be all taught of god
[1:16:44] every man therefore that hath heard and
[1:16:47] hath learned
[1:16:48] of the father cometh unto me
[1:16:52] don't read that like a baptist
[1:16:57] let's read verse 45 again it is written
[1:16:59] in the prophets and they shall be all
[1:17:01] taught of god
[1:17:04] every man therefore that hath heard
[1:17:07] already heard
[1:17:09] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:17:12] unto me
[1:17:13] so you cannot come to jesus unless
[1:17:16] you've already been taught of the father
[1:17:19] and you've already heard the father and
[1:17:21] been taught of the father if you haven't
[1:17:24] previously heard from god and been
[1:17:25] taught by the father you don't come to
[1:17:27] jesus
[1:17:29] is that what the bible says
[1:17:31] we're not changing the words we're
[1:17:33] reading exactly what's written
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] not that any man hath seen the father
[1:17:40] because you never saw him as a man
[1:17:43] in your flesh body
[1:17:45] not that any man has seen the father
[1:17:47] save he which is of god he hath seen the
[1:17:49] father
[1:17:51] so if you're of god you've seen the
[1:17:53] father
[1:17:58] let's turn quickly over to first john
[1:18:00] chapter 4.
[1:18:11] first john chapter 4.
[1:18:17] first john chapter 4 verse 4
[1:18:20] ye are of god little
[1:18:24] children this is the same john who wrote
[1:18:27] the gospel of john
[1:18:29] is that right
[1:18:31] and he said ye are of god little
[1:18:33] children and have overcome them because
[1:18:34] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:18:37] that is in the world
[1:18:38] the heir of the world therefore speak
[1:18:40] they of the world and the world heareth
[1:18:42] them
[1:18:43] we are of god he that knoweth god
[1:18:45] heareth us he that is not of god hereth
[1:18:48] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[1:18:50] truth and the spirit of error
[1:18:52] so john the apostle john
[1:18:55] says year of god little children said we
[1:18:58] are of god
[1:19:00] back in the gospel of john
[1:19:01] of john when he's recording jesus
[1:19:04] he says those who are of god
[1:19:07] have seen the father
[1:19:09] let's go back to john chapter 6 and read
[1:19:10] that again one time
[1:19:16] john chapter 6
[1:19:19] verse 46.
[1:19:26] not that any man has seen the father
[1:19:27] save he which is of god
[1:19:30] he hath seen the father
[1:19:34] john said you are of god little children
[1:19:36] are you of god
[1:19:38] then you've seen the father
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] and you have heard from him and been
[1:19:44] taught by him when
[1:19:46] i don't know maybe when he showed the
[1:19:47] movie in heaven
[1:19:50] maybe when i watched the plan of
[1:19:52] salvation unfold in a mysterious way how
[1:19:55] i don't know i don't think it was a
[1:19:56] projector in a big screen i mean
[1:19:59] we're not carnal i don't know how but
[1:20:01] but god alone with his attributes amen
[1:20:04] began to show his plan of salvation and
[1:20:07] the sons of god begin to shout for joy
[1:20:09] amen the mechanics of how that happened
[1:20:11] i don't even care all i know is i was
[1:20:14] there i saw it i heard from the father
[1:20:16] i've been taught father father i'm of
[1:20:18] god amen and that is why i could come to
[1:20:21] jesus amen because i've been taught of
[1:20:23] the father
[1:20:26] because this message didn't come to
[1:20:27] quicken your mind to quicken your body
[1:20:29] to quicken your human spirit it came to
[1:20:31] quicken the seed that was in the soul
[1:20:33] amen and that seed is part of god
[1:20:37] it's more than these ears
[1:20:40] it's more than this mind
[1:20:43] it's that part of god that god is
[1:20:45] calling back to himself
[1:20:49] he said in the message
[1:20:51] god who is rich in mercy
[1:20:53] now we are a part of god you always was
[1:20:55] you don't remember it because you were
[1:20:57] only an attribute in god you were only
[1:20:59] in this thinking your very name if it
[1:21:01] ever was on the book of life it was put
[1:21:03] there before the foundation of the world
[1:21:04] he knew what you were
[1:21:06] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:21:08] doctrine but to straighten it out that
[1:21:09] we might get away from this fear and
[1:21:11] scare
[1:21:13] you don't know who you are
[1:21:14] you are not going to be but now you are
[1:21:17] the sons of god see you always were the
[1:21:19] sons of god see so who was shouting in
[1:21:22] glory before the sons of god
[1:21:25] and you always were the sons of god see
[1:21:28] for when god had you in his thinking at
[1:21:30] the beginning you have to be some part
[1:21:32] of you your life that's in you now had
[1:21:35] to be with god before there well then he
[1:21:38] before he even became material here on
[1:21:40] earth before there was anything but god
[1:21:43] you were one of his attributes he knowed
[1:21:45] what your name would be he knowed the
[1:21:47] color hair you would have he knowed all
[1:21:49] about you
[1:21:54] in 1965 the rising of the sun he says no
[1:21:57] wonder he said fear not
[1:21:59] for now notice we are redeemed by him
[1:22:00] and now risen with him that's what
[1:22:02] easter means to the people risen with
[1:22:04] him notice now we have his spirit in us
[1:22:07] the abstract title the abstract deed
[1:22:09] fully paid
[1:22:11] no you don't say well i hope i make it
[1:22:13] you've already made it
[1:22:16] not i will make it i've already made it
[1:22:20] there's not
[1:22:21] i'm going to make it you're
[1:22:23] that you've already made it i mean that
[1:22:25] that's a given amen i'm gonna make it
[1:22:28] and you know brother chad i'm gonna make
[1:22:29] it if you're ever going to make it you
[1:22:31] already made it you made it before you
[1:22:33] started
[1:22:36] i like this kind of race
[1:22:39] the one that's already determined you're
[1:22:40] a medal winner
[1:22:41] before you run
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:48] then he goes on to say
[1:22:51] i've already made it i never made it he
[1:22:54] made it for me
[1:22:57] so then it was absent from my effort
[1:23:02] it was void of my determination and will
[1:23:07] he already made it for me without my
[1:23:10] perseverance
[1:23:12] he already made it for me
[1:23:15] so how do i think that by my will and my
[1:23:18] perseverance and my trying harder that i
[1:23:20] will attain to anything
[1:23:22] no he already did it for me
[1:23:25] he made it for me not me him well
[1:23:28] brother branham i don't care what they
[1:23:30] say there he made it for me that's all i
[1:23:33] want all i'm caring about
[1:23:35] i just want to see him manifested how
[1:23:37] can you do it call him down no
[1:23:40] he's in you
[1:23:43] he's in you well then lord if i can get
[1:23:45] myself out of the way you can manifest
[1:23:49] so now
[1:23:52] all this effort in achieving
[1:23:55] all this effort and
[1:23:57] and and running harder listen he's
[1:23:59] already made it for us amen but brother
[1:24:02] man said i just want to see you manifest
[1:24:04] how will you do it call him down no he's
[1:24:07] in you what you're going to do is move
[1:24:09] out of the way and give him preference
[1:24:13] relax your thinking move your will aside
[1:24:16] your plans and your ambitions separate
[1:24:18] from them and let he who is already in
[1:24:21] you come and manifest himself through
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:28] i want to look at just a one or two more
[1:24:30] scriptures but let's turn to luke 22
[1:24:32] real quickly
[1:24:33] because i want to i don't want to
[1:24:35] stop until i lay this in
[1:24:38] luke 22
[1:24:40] and verse 31.
[1:24:48] this is really important at least
[1:24:50] in my heart right now
[1:24:52] luke 22 31 and the lord said simon simon
[1:24:55] behold satan hath desired to have you
[1:24:57] that he may sift you as wheat but i have
[1:24:59] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[1:25:04] how many
[1:25:06] times
[1:25:07] did peter look back on the incidents of
[1:25:09] his life
[1:25:11] at this stage he didn't know what was
[1:25:12] going to happen next
[1:25:14] he had no inkling that he would deny the
[1:25:16] lord
[1:25:17] that he would run away and abandon him
[1:25:19] and leave him in curse
[1:25:21] as he tried to prove that he didn't know
[1:25:24] even know him
[1:25:26] but how many times would he look back
[1:25:28] and say
[1:25:29] i'm so glad he prayed for me
[1:25:32] it was his prayer that kept me it was
[1:25:35] jesus doing amen
[1:25:37] he
[1:25:38] said amen but i have prayed for thee
[1:25:42] that thy faith fail not
[1:25:44] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:25:46] thy brethren
[1:25:47] and he said in them lord i am ready to
[1:25:49] go with thee both into prison and to
[1:25:51] death.
[1:25:52] and he said i tell thee peter the
[1:25:54] shall not crow this day before that thou
[1:25:56] shalt thrist deny that thou knowest me
[1:26:01] peter could never in himself imagine
[1:26:03] denying the lord
[1:26:05] he believed he was ready to die he was
[1:26:07] ready to go to prison he was ready and
[1:26:09] we know that peter had a revelation of
[1:26:11] who jesus christ is
[1:26:13] a revelation not from his intellect but
[1:26:15] a revelation given to him by the father
[1:26:17] that he knew he was the son of the
[1:26:19] living god that he was christ the son of
[1:26:21] the living god and so he had a
[1:26:23] revelation of who jesus was
[1:26:25] and jesus
[1:26:27] you know is telling him
[1:26:29] you're going to be sifted satan has
[1:26:31] desired a city but i've prayed for you
[1:26:32] that your faith failed not
[1:26:35] that you don't lose faith and and peter
[1:26:38] says you know it's okay i'm going to
[1:26:40] i'll give all for you
[1:26:43] and just a short time after this he's
[1:26:44] running away cursing and claiming that
[1:26:46] he never knew him
[1:26:48] thank god that he prayed
[1:26:53] in the message christ is the mystery of
[1:26:54] god revealed he says
[1:26:56] the new birth is christ
[1:26:58] is a revelation
[1:27:00] god has revealed to you this great
[1:27:02] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:27:05] now what are you going to do when you
[1:27:06] get all that grouped together where the
[1:27:08] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[1:27:11] god expressing it through his word by
[1:27:12] the same actions the same things that he
[1:27:14] did making the word manifest oh if the
[1:27:17] church only knew its position
[1:27:19] it will one day
[1:27:21] then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:27:23] what it is
[1:27:25] what is it a revelation
[1:27:28] knowing what it is
[1:27:30] see peter
[1:27:32] knew who jesus was
[1:27:36] but peter didn't yet know who he was
[1:27:40] when peter gets to this place peter has
[1:27:42] a revelation of who jesus christ is but
[1:27:45] peter yet does not have the revelation
[1:27:47] of who he is
[1:27:49] because peter is still in arguments with
[1:27:51] the disciples wondering who's going to
[1:27:53] be the greatest in the kingdom and you
[1:27:55] know even the the mother of james and
[1:27:57] john come to jesus and say oh lord will
[1:28:00] will you answer my request and he said
[1:28:02] what's your request well my sons one sit
[1:28:04] on your right hand and one on your left
[1:28:05] he says it's not for me to give but for
[1:28:07] my father to give and you can see that
[1:28:09] they don't even yet know who they are
[1:28:11] they don't understand the plan of god
[1:28:14] amen they've got carnal ideas of who
[1:28:16] will sit on the right hand who will sin
[1:28:17] and what the kingdom of god is even
[1:28:19] going to be like and
[1:28:21] peter's in arguments with the disciples
[1:28:22] of who's going to be the greatest they
[1:28:24] have no revelation of who they are but
[1:28:27] they know who he is
[1:28:29] and by knowing who he is they're trying
[1:28:31] to find who they are in relation to who
[1:28:34] he is can i be the greatest can i sit on
[1:28:36] the right hand can i sit on the left
[1:28:38] hand but if they had a revelation of who
[1:28:40] they are which we know john got because
[1:28:42] john's a type of the bride when he went
[1:28:44] to the heavenly realms he saw 24 thrones
[1:28:47] round about the throne amen they already
[1:28:49] had a position they already had a place
[1:28:51] but they were blind to who they were
[1:28:56] so peter
[1:28:58] knowing who jesus was
[1:29:01] but he lacked the revelation of who he
[1:29:03] was
[1:29:08] he ran away he forsook the lord
[1:29:12] he cursed
[1:29:14] but in an upper room he was going to
[1:29:15] receive a revelation
[1:29:18] this was a change in dispensation
[1:29:20] it was moving from jesus christ and the
[1:29:23] flesh body of the man from nazareth and
[1:29:25] now he says i will come to you
[1:29:27] and now the spirit of god was going to
[1:29:29] come back to them and he was going to
[1:29:31] indwell them and become one with them
[1:29:33] and now peter was going to know that
[1:29:36] christ was not amen somebody he could
[1:29:39] get close to but christ was going to be
[1:29:40] somebody that dwelt inside of him
[1:29:43] and that he and christ would be one and
[1:29:45] now
[1:29:47] now with this revelation
[1:29:49] peter is ready to face the sanhedrin
[1:29:51] he's ready to be crucified upside down
[1:29:53] he's ready to be mocked and spit upon
[1:29:55] and laughed at and ridiculed amen he's
[1:29:58] ready to stand because he got a greater
[1:30:01] revelation on the day of pentecost than
[1:30:03] the revelation he had before jesus died
[1:30:07] why because he had come to him
[1:30:09] personally
[1:30:11] and he'd become one with him
[1:30:14] and now when he goes to the gate
[1:30:16] beautiful
[1:30:18] and the man's begging he says gold and
[1:30:19] silver have i none but such as i have
[1:30:24] now peter's no longer worried about
[1:30:25] who's going to be greatest in the
[1:30:26] kingdom now they're not asking who's
[1:30:28] going to sit on the right hand and sue
[1:30:29] says on the left hand they've been
[1:30:30] unified with christ he's returned amen
[1:30:33] he's dwelling in them amen by the
[1:30:34] baptism of the holy ghost and now he's
[1:30:36] walking out with a higher revelation of
[1:30:39] where he fits into the program of god
[1:30:41] and now when they come to crucify him he
[1:30:44] doesn't resist he doesn't run he doesn't
[1:30:46] hide he doesn't slander and speak swear
[1:30:49] words and try to hide like he's not a
[1:30:51] believer he says could you just do me a
[1:30:53] favor
[1:30:55] could you crucify me upside down because
[1:30:57] i'm not worthy to be slayed like my lord
[1:31:00] the revelation carried him through every
[1:31:02] other trial and tribulation
[1:31:05] it was a greater revelation
[1:31:10] first john 5 4 says
[1:31:12] for whatsoever is born of god overcome
[1:31:14] with the world and this is the victory
[1:31:17] that overcometh the world
[1:31:19] even
[1:31:20] our
[1:31:21] faith
[1:31:22] and faith is a
[1:31:25] revelation
[1:31:27] how are we going to overcome the world
[1:31:29] by revelation
[1:31:31] how will we
[1:31:33] pass from where we stand now
[1:31:35] and to the change of the body through
[1:31:36] whatever we pass through to get there
[1:31:39] how will we get from here to there
[1:31:42] by
[1:31:42] revelation because this is the victory
[1:31:44] that overcome with the world even our
[1:31:47] faith
[1:31:48] our
[1:31:49] revelation
[1:31:51] i want to read one more quote and then
[1:31:53] we can go
[1:31:55] in the church age book and the
[1:31:57] revelation of jesus christ now remember
[1:31:59] this
[1:32:01] christ in the true church is a
[1:32:02] continuation of the book of acts
[1:32:05] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:32:07] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:32:08] into the church and defile it making it
[1:32:11] lukewarm formal powerless
[1:32:14] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:32:17] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:32:19] and the discrediting of god's word so
[1:32:22] what is the works of satan
[1:32:24] the attempted destruction of god's
[1:32:26] people
[1:32:27] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:32:31] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:32:33] the lake of fire he fights that he
[1:32:35] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:32:37] people get the true revelation of the
[1:32:39] true church
[1:32:40] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:32:43] and that she can do the greater works
[1:32:45] she will be an invincible army
[1:32:48] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:32:50] spirits within the framework of the
[1:32:51] christian church
[1:32:53] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:32:54] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[1:32:57] will be powerless before her
[1:33:01] listen what's the antichrist spirit if i
[1:33:03] could just say it this way the
[1:33:04] antichrist spirit is the anti-word
[1:33:07] spirits
[1:33:09] anything that's contrary to the revealed
[1:33:11] word of the hour is antichrist
[1:33:15] so if it's denying the revealed word of
[1:33:17] the hour is taught by a prophet it's an
[1:33:19] antichrist spirits
[1:33:22] so antichrist is anti-word because
[1:33:24] christ is the anointed word so anything
[1:33:27] that stands against the word for our day
[1:33:29] the anointed word of this the revelation
[1:33:31] of the message is the antichrist spirit
[1:33:34] if by god's spirit they can discern and
[1:33:37] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[1:33:40] will be powerless before her
[1:33:42] listen satan was powerless before eve
[1:33:47] until eve amen took that antichrist
[1:33:50] spirit amen and deviated from the word
[1:33:52] of god and then he overcame her amen
[1:33:56] this bride has been given back the pure
[1:33:58] word of god and as long as she stays
[1:34:00] with that amen he is powerless over her
[1:34:03] his power will come by getting her to
[1:34:06] deviate away from the revealed word
[1:34:11] that's why this revelation of who we are
[1:34:13] is so important
[1:34:15] satan will be powerless before he will
[1:34:17] be as definitely thwarted today as when
[1:34:20] christ withstood his every effort to
[1:34:22] gain power over him in the desert don't
[1:34:24] forget how christ overcame him in the
[1:34:26] desert
[1:34:28] it is written
[1:34:30] it is written
[1:34:31] not his gifts
[1:34:34] not his power
[1:34:35] he overcame him with it is written
[1:34:39] yes satan hates revelation
[1:34:42] but we love it
[1:34:44] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:34:47] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:34:50] but we will prevail
[1:34:52] over them
[1:34:56] there's been a revelation given to the
[1:34:58] people of god in this hour
[1:35:00] and i say it's a revelation
[1:35:03] there's been things open to us that have
[1:35:05] never been opened before
[1:35:09] they've been open to us in the opening
[1:35:11] of the seals that have never been opened
[1:35:13] before
[1:35:15] and that wasn't so that we can have a
[1:35:18] another
[1:35:19] move like we've had moves before
[1:35:22] it wasn't so that we can like i said
[1:35:24] before have a point of differentiation
[1:35:26] that makes us different than
[1:35:27] denominations that's not why this was
[1:35:30] open it was open to give us eyes to see
[1:35:32] amen to give us eagle vision to bring us
[1:35:35] out of the man age and bring us into the
[1:35:38] eagle earth to fly higher to see clear
[1:35:40] so that we would have the revelation to
[1:35:42] overcome all things that are coming in
[1:35:44] this day
[1:35:46] so what do we need to overcome the
[1:35:48] message of the hour amen
[1:35:50] and what revelation do we need we need
[1:35:52] to know who we
[1:35:54] are
[1:35:57] so many people know who brother branham
[1:35:59] is
[1:36:00] and that's wonderful
[1:36:02] but who are you
[1:36:05] peter knew who jesus was but who's peter
[1:36:10] amen
[1:36:11] we know who the prophet of god is we
[1:36:12] know who the seventh angel is but who
[1:36:14] are you
[1:36:16] that's my question today as we close who
[1:36:18] are you
[1:36:19] you know who the seventh angel is you
[1:36:21] can you can recite all of the church age
[1:36:23] messenger you know all seven angels in
[1:36:25] the hand of christ amen you know who
[1:36:27] christ is in this day and how he
[1:36:28] returned but who are you amen that's the
[1:36:32] revelation that we need in this hour is
[1:36:34] who am i amen and what is my purpose
[1:36:37] amen and now we've got to come to a time
[1:36:39] that we know that god has called his
[1:36:42] bride amen he's put the word in her
[1:36:44] hands amen and she knows now she's come
[1:36:47] from god and she goes to god
[1:36:50] now she doesn't need to defend herself
[1:36:51] protect herself run from danger she just
[1:36:53] needs to say god not my will but thy
[1:36:56] will be done whatever you want in my
[1:36:58] life is what you'll get but let me stand
[1:37:00] like a believer and face every trial
[1:37:02] amen and say all things are working
[1:37:05] together for good today amen all things
[1:37:08] are working together in this situation
[1:37:09] amen nothing shall defeat me nothing
[1:37:12] shall hinder me because god has a
[1:37:14] purpose for my life
[1:37:19] this too
[1:37:21] shall work together for god
[1:37:24] we need a greater revelation
[1:37:27] to bring us
[1:37:28] through
[1:37:30] we need a revelation that holds in the
[1:37:32] hour of trial i say god
[1:37:35] give us eagle eyes
[1:37:37] to see
[1:37:38] let's all stand together
[1:37:46] musicians if you'll come blake if you'll
[1:37:48] come
[1:37:51] you know we said earlier you didn't ask
[1:37:53] to be bride
[1:37:56] at least
[1:37:57] in the carnal remembering i have now i
[1:37:59] don't remember that i may have
[1:38:01] in the mind of god
[1:38:04] but i don't remember asking to be bride
[1:38:06] and i don't remember asking to come in
[1:38:08] laodicea
[1:38:10] but god chose me elected this portion of
[1:38:13] himself to come in this body of flesh
[1:38:15] and come in this age
[1:38:18] and he didn't put me here to be defeated
[1:38:20] by laodicea
[1:38:22] to be overwhelmed with the world to fall
[1:38:24] at every trial and test that is not why
[1:38:27] i'm here
[1:38:28] i've got a revelation that climbs higher
[1:38:30] than that and i'm not here to exhaust
[1:38:33] myself with my own efforts finding sin
[1:38:35] i'm here to say god you placed me here
[1:38:38] god you've got to carry me through i'm
[1:38:40] one of yours and i'm here for your
[1:38:41] purpose
[1:38:43] and let god
[1:38:44] bring his manifestation what am i here
[1:38:46] to do get out of his way
[1:38:50] and let him do
[1:38:52] what he always intended to do
[1:38:54] in this body of flesh in this hour that
[1:38:57] we're alive
[1:38:59] listen when you hear news reports
[1:39:02] don't break a sweat
[1:39:05] when chaos breaks out
[1:39:07] don't lose sleep
[1:39:11] you were ordained to be here now
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:16] nothing happens in the life of a
[1:39:17] believer that doesn't first cross god's
[1:39:19] desk and he signs off on it
[1:39:22] nothing is to destroy you or hurt you
[1:39:24] everything is for your benefit and for
[1:39:27] the good for god's plan
[1:39:29] and so now it's time
[1:39:33] it's time to grow up
[1:39:35] if i've ever felt anything in my heart
[1:39:37] it's this it is time to grow up and act
[1:39:39] like the bride of jesus christ
[1:39:42] and stop acting
[1:39:44] it's time to awaken to the fact that
[1:39:46] we're eagles not chickens
[1:39:50] it's time remember brother branham saw
[1:39:52] that eagle that got blown down in that
[1:39:54] storm and he was in the blow down and he
[1:39:56] was there and and and and he was there
[1:39:58] drying off his wings and stretching his
[1:40:00] wings and brother venom encounters this
[1:40:02] eagle and says you know i could shoot
[1:40:04] you and
[1:40:05] he has this dialogue
[1:40:09] but the eagle didn't really worry about
[1:40:11] the hunter and he got annoyed with the
[1:40:13] chatter chatter chatter
[1:40:15] and he just set his wings and flapped a
[1:40:17] few times and set him and he went back
[1:40:19] into the heavenlies
[1:40:21] listen that's the solution to every
[1:40:23] problem
[1:40:26] you know when when trials come and
[1:40:28] difficulties come and and circumstances
[1:40:30] that we don't really know the answer to
[1:40:32] i i encourage you stop worrying and
[1:40:35] wringing your hands and walking around
[1:40:37] in circles just play a tape
[1:40:40] just read your bible just come back to
[1:40:42] church for fellowship amen let just just
[1:40:45] flap those wings a couple times and set
[1:40:47] them in the word amen and just get above
[1:40:50] that thing and realize this isn't going
[1:40:52] to hurt me this won't destroy me god
[1:40:54] hasn't planned for me to be here for a
[1:40:56] millennium then all of a sudden show up
[1:40:58] and i fail and fall apart god knew this
[1:41:00] was going to happen and god has me where
[1:41:02] he wants me so he can do something to
[1:41:05] display this word in this flesh
[1:41:09] so then every trial becomes an
[1:41:11] opportunity every circumstance becomes a
[1:41:14] way for the word to be
[1:41:15] manifest in your flesh
[1:41:18] and let let the let the winds
[1:41:21] set your wings and let the winds carry
[1:41:24] us a little bit higher above these
[1:41:26] things so that we can get away from all
[1:41:28] the carnal and away from all the threats
[1:41:30] and realize there is nothing that can
[1:41:33] threaten me
[1:41:36] nothing outside of god's will
[1:41:39] is going to be successful
[1:41:41] and if it's god's will
[1:41:43] why would i want to avoid it
[1:41:47] so nothing outside god's will is going
[1:41:49] to be successful
[1:41:51] but if it's in god's will why would i
[1:41:53] want to change it when it will work for
[1:41:55] good
[1:41:58] see god has done something special in
[1:42:00] this day
[1:42:01] not in the denominational ages where
[1:42:04] we had to make excuses you know every
[1:42:06] time something bad happened to a
[1:42:07] believer
[1:42:08] you know i grew up in a pentecostal
[1:42:10] church and everything is spiritualized
[1:42:13] so if something bad happened well you
[1:42:15] know
[1:42:16] you weren't clapping your hands last
[1:42:18] sunday and you've lost your praise and
[1:42:20] luck
[1:42:24] just say god's ordained it
[1:42:26] and allowed it to happen
[1:42:28] maybe i do need to learn something
[1:42:29] that's fine but god's ordained it he's
[1:42:32] brought it for good amen not for evil
[1:42:36] say god
[1:42:38] have your way
[1:42:39] in this trial and you have me
[1:42:42] as a yielded vessel to surrender to you
[1:42:45] that whatever you want you'll get
[1:42:48] right i think it's so much better than
[1:42:50] worrying and wringing our hands and
[1:42:51] trying to find our own solutions listen
[1:42:53] i have chased my tail time and time
[1:42:55] again trying to fix a problem and all
[1:42:57] i've ever done is make it worse
[1:42:59] but the times i did nothing were the
[1:43:01] times that they worked out the best
[1:43:04] praise be to god and that goes totally
[1:43:06] contrary to my nature
[1:43:09] but god knows what he's doing friends
[1:43:12] no matter what happens next in the world
[1:43:15] it's okay
[1:43:16] no matter what news report comes out no
[1:43:18] matter what natural disaster is next no
[1:43:20] matter what what what crisis hits next
[1:43:23] it's okay
[1:43:25] don't you worry a drop god has a plan
[1:43:28] and it's all okay
[1:43:30] man let's just bow our heads in thinking
[1:43:32] lord jesus
[1:43:34] we thank you lord for the message
[1:43:37] god what kind of people would we be
[1:43:41] without this message
[1:43:43] what kind of neurotics would we be in
[1:43:45] the age of neurosis
[1:43:48] if it wasn't for this message
[1:43:50] how many of us lord would be on
[1:43:53] antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills
[1:43:56] if it wasn't for this message
[1:44:00] god you have spared us
[1:44:02] we know that the men's hearts are
[1:44:04] failing for fear
[1:44:07] god help us lord to see your word
[1:44:10] and see the reality of the day we live
[1:44:12] in
[1:44:13] and recognize who we really are
[1:44:17] god for that revelation will bring us so
[1:44:19] much higher than the carnal things of
[1:44:21] life
[1:44:23] god i pray if there's anybody here who's
[1:44:25] still struggling with doubts
[1:44:28] about their personal identity
[1:44:30] i pray you'd quicken it to them now lord
[1:44:33] that you would come personally to them
[1:44:36] and bring them a new birth experience
[1:44:38] where that they would know
[1:44:40] who they really are
[1:44:43] god i praise that you allow them to
[1:44:45] rejoice like they rejoiced before when
[1:44:47] they saw the plan of salvation
[1:44:49] may they rejoice now in the plan of
[1:44:51] salvation like they did there
[1:44:54] may god you comfort our hearts to know
[1:44:56] that all is well
[1:44:57] that everything's under control
[1:45:00] gone that we are your expressed
[1:45:03] attributes on this earth in this day
[1:45:05] forgive us father help us to act like it
[1:45:08] lord
[1:45:09] we give you glory and praise and
[1:45:11] thanksgiving
[1:45:13] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:45:18] amen
[1:45:20] i want to make one final statement
[1:45:24] i want to say
[1:45:25] quit whining
[1:45:29] when you saw the movie before you said
[1:45:31] it was good
[1:45:33] you said that's a good plan
[1:45:35] that'll work
[1:45:37] and now it's not time for us to go back
[1:45:39] on what we originally thought was great
[1:45:42] but it's time for us to let spiritual
[1:45:44] amnesia be clipped away by the word
[1:45:46] until we can go back to saying it's a
[1:45:48] good plan
[1:45:50] it's a good plan oh i don't understand
[1:45:53] it in my carnal mind i know that the
[1:45:55] devil can't even figure this one out and
[1:45:57] all his wisdom and intellect it's a good
[1:45:59] plan
[1:46:01] let's go back amen we may not be able to
[1:46:03] that still may be darkened to us in ways
[1:46:05] we may not still see what we saw that
[1:46:07] day and understand this clearly amen but
[1:46:10] remember there's something in you that
[1:46:11] saw it there amen
[1:46:13] there's an attribute of god a thought of
[1:46:15] god inside of you that knew it amen and
[1:46:17] let that thought carry you through every
[1:46:19] trial let that thing that bubbles up and
[1:46:22] says all is well amen when the when the
[1:46:24] when the shunamite woman had her baby
[1:46:26] die and she was making her way back to
[1:46:28] elijah he said is all well she said all
[1:46:30] is well that didn't come from her brain
[1:46:33] friends that didn't come from her
[1:46:34] emotions that came from something much
[1:46:36] deeper amen
[1:46:38] and let's stay connected to that part of
[1:46:40] god by his word that says in every
[1:46:42] circumstance all as well
[1:46:45] all is well
[1:46:47] amen god bless you
