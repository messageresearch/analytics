[0:00] you'll only get this character by the
[0:02] word
[0:03] and your mind molds your character
[0:08] this is why Satan
[0:11] is the
[0:13] is so polluting
[0:17] the entertainment dimension
[0:21] and
[0:22] he is so taken over
[0:26] and
[0:28] afflicting the people with screens
[0:32] everywhere
[0:34] I can't even pump gas without there
[0:38] being a scream there
[0:41] everywhere you go
[0:44] there is a screen
[0:47] why
[0:50] because Satan knows what God's tactics
[0:54] are he knows how God he knows the plan
[0:57] of God brother Brandon said this he
[0:58] openly declares this not all of it he
[1:00] said there was one portion he didn't
[1:02] know and it's a good thing he didn't
[1:03] know that but he knows how God works
[1:07] and he knows that God is going to use
[1:10] the Mind remember the Battleground was
[1:11] the mind he knows God is going to come
[1:14] through the mind to mold the portion
[1:16] with his word to mold the character of
[1:18] the people so how is he going to mold
[1:20] the character of his people
[1:22] and how is he going to
[1:25] uh delay
[1:28] the people of God coming to their
[1:30] appropriate position he has got to get
[1:32] into a spiritual position
[1:34] and infiltrate and afflict them in their
[1:38] mind to bother their character coming to
[1:40] full fruition
[1:44] so how does he do that he enters that
[1:46] dimension
[1:47] whatever the dimension that is I don't
[1:49] know I always get them wrong so I'm not
[1:50] even going to say anything
[1:53] whatever Dimension that is to where
[1:54] there's screens everywhere
[1:56] and he has to constantly
[1:59] constantly have an image before the
[2:03] people to make them be thinking about
[2:05] something to be seeing something to be
[2:07] entertained by something
[2:08] and again I'm not even saying it's all
[2:10] bad or all what we would say sinful or
[2:13] dirty or smutty it's just I've got to
[2:15] tie up the cogs of their mind because
[2:17] what if by perchance they would start
[2:20] wondering about their Eternal
[2:21] destination and wondering where they
[2:23] come from and wondering about where they
[2:25] stand before their creator don't let
[2:28] them think those kind of thoughts let
[2:29] them think anything else
[2:31] don't let them think those kind of
[2:32] thoughts
[2:35] praise the Lord your mind makes your
[2:38] character this is why young people
[2:41] you have to guard against these things
[2:43] and we can sit here and I can go down
[2:45] the list if you want me to of what what
[2:47] they all are but it doesn't matter
[2:49] I'm not here to preach against social
[2:51] media and name them all I don't even
[2:53] know half of them but it's out there
[2:55] it's there and if one's not going to
[2:57] catch your attention he'll get another
[2:58] one
[2:59] I mean I don't even know how many social
[3:01] media platforms there are right now why
[3:03] isn't one good enough I mean how many
[3:05] social media lives do you have to have
[3:09] it's not about how many you have to have
[3:11] it's about keeping your mind tied up
