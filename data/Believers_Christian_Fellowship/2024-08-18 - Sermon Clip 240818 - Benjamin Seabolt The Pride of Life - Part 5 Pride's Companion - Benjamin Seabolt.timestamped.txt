[0:00] the blind
[0:02] man that is
[0:04] healed this is a blind man from his
[0:07] birth he's healed and the only thing the
[0:10] scribes and the Pharisees can say is
[0:13] that's clearly not of God because he did
[0:14] it on the Sabbath and who is that guy
[0:20] anyhow were they really concerned about
[0:23] who he was and what he was doing or were
[0:26] they concerned about their position
[0:27] being threatened
[0:30] why were they asking the question who
[0:32] made you whole who healed your eyes how
[0:35] did he do it was it because they really
[0:37] wanted to know so that they could
[0:39] duplicate that or was it because they
[0:41] were concerned that you know what this
[0:44] guy's kind of got something we don't
[0:46] have and there is a lot of people
[0:49] interested in it right and we really
[0:52] need to put that new addition on the
[0:56] temple and we came up 20% short on the
[0:58] offerings this month because they were
[1:00] out with this
[1:05] guy what was their motivation what were
[1:09] they concerned about by asking their
[1:12] questions
[1:15] this the lame man that was healed same
[1:20] thing they couldn't even be happy for
[1:22] the poor guy
[1:24] right this is a man who hasn't walked in
[1:27] years and now he can walk and he can
[1:29] rejoice and and they can't even say
[1:31] praise the Lord we're happy for you who
[1:33] did this when did he do it he did it on
[1:35] the Sabbath he's clearly not of God he's
[1:37] a
[1:43] devil why would why did he have to be of
[1:46] the
[1:47] devil they hadn't even talked to him
[1:50] they hadn't even figured this out they
[1:51] haven't even say why did you do this
[1:53] why' you
[1:54] do there is no investigation but there's
[1:57] a verdict why because they needed that
[2:01] to be
[2:04] true you have Mary come with the
[2:07] alabaster
[2:08] box break it Judas says that's a
[2:12] waste we just lost all that money that
[2:15] we could have given to the
[2:17] poor we don't even have to wonder about
[2:19] the interpretation of this because it's
[2:21] written right in the scripture he said
[2:23] it because he was a thief at heart not
[2:24] that he cared anything about the poor
[2:31] there's two men possessed of
[2:33] devils Jesus casts them out and they go
[2:35] into a herd of swine run off a
[2:38] cliff there is no focus on the neighbor
[2:42] in the neighborhood about these two men
[2:44] who've been possessed of devils for year
[2:46] are now free clothed sitting in the
[2:48] right mind listening to a man talking
[2:50] about the gospel praise God let's have a
[2:53] party no the only concern is we ain't
[2:57] going to have no more bacon
[3:00] our pigs are gone our livelihood is
[3:03] threatened
[3:07] right
[3:09] pigs versus two sons of
[3:12] God right
[3:18] pigs
[3:22] livelihood livelihood is what those pigs
[3:26] were rubber meat in the road am you may
[3:31] not be a pig
[3:35] seller but how many
[3:38] times have we taken and chose our
[3:41] livelihood not being threatened over
[3:44] something that God's doing
