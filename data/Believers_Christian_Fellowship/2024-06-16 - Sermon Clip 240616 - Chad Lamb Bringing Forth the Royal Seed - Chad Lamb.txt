TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is sometimes we try to intellectualize things and sometimes that's my problem I'm trying to understand too much and it's not about comprehension intellectually it's about comprehension spiritually it's about a spiritual truth that's Awakening inside of us that's why amen we could describe Christ as the lamb and his wife is the wife of the Lamb so he's the lamb she's the lamb but he's also the lion and know she has to be the lionness I mean you you see all these types and shadows coming down through amen they're all trying to dis s truth to us it's not so that we get hung up and say well is he a lion now or is he a lamb now he's no longer the lamb now he's the lion so am I supposed to be a lamb listen forget about all of that God is trying to take some symbol that you understand and teach you a truth he's not trying to divide himself up and say now I have this nature and now I have this nature it's not like that friends we get all boggled down by details and now is he this or now he's that he's a lamb is he a lamb he's always a lamb he'll always be the lamb when he takes the Throne of David he'll be the Lamb of God but he's also the lion of the tribe of Judah and he's always been the lion and will always be the lion so people get confused with details brother brandham doesn't get confused with details that's why he's a perfect Prophet because he can take the same scripture and use it two different ways because it's all about the revelation of the truth it's not about the details of keeping the words lined out correctly so people get confused and think brother B contradicting himself one time he makes Noah those Noah and those in the ark are the 144,000 Jews that are saved through the time of tribulation one time he makes them the elect seed that's saved from destruction another time he makes them part of the foolish virgin that are saved from destruction amen when was he right and when was he wrong he's always right because it's the truth that's being inseminated by the word and so now we try to say I mean you take any type if you take a type of The Lion and the pride of lion you take that type and you run it too tight you're going to find a place where it falls apart and no longer expresses the nature of Christ because these are still beast in a fallen World in a fallen condition and sometimes they eat their own young that's not the point don't get hung up on the details catch the Revelation that he's bringing to us this day he wants us he's calling for his bride his church his seed the the the the female version of him to unite with him in this day so that he can re produce himself upon the Earth how's he going to reproduce himself she's not going to birth out another Jesus Christ like Mary did 2,000 years ago she's actually going to receive the word which is he himself the promised word for this hour which is he himself manifesting himself in the form of a bride Jesus Christ in the bride form and she is going to now surrender to the headship of the word and live that word to the letter by the power of the Holy Ghost ghost has been released by the fullness of the word coming back and that will be him reproduced through the womb of the Bride amen don't let your mind get B well what child what baby and when and all of that it's you it's in you it's in collectively in the bride it's Christ coming forth from the womb of his his his church that has been redeemed amen
