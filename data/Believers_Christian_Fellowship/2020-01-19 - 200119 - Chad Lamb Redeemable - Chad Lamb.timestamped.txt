[3:51] amen that's what we're here for god
[3:53] bless you what we're standing is we turn
[3:54] to the book of luke chapter 19.
[4:00] i want to look at uh
[4:03] a thought i thought god's been dealing
[4:06] with me on for quite a while but
[4:07] i'd like to take it from the angle
[4:09] redeemable just the one word title
[4:12] redeemable
[4:13] luke 19 and verse 10
[4:17] for the son of man has come to seek and
[4:19] to save
[4:20] that which was lost oh hallelujah
[4:25] have you been found that means you were
[4:28] lost
[4:29] if you've been found it's because you
[4:30] were lost if you were lost it means you
[4:33] were in somebody's possession before
[4:36] that you had been found before your loss
[4:37] so that you can be found again
[4:39] hallelujah that should do us a whole
[4:41] world of good friends just that one
[4:43] scripture right there
[4:44] amen you can't lost what you you can't
[4:47] lose what you didn't already have
[4:50] so we were already somewhere amen and
[4:52] fell from that place
[4:54] amen and we're in a lost condition and
[4:55] the son of man came to seek and to save
[4:57] that which was lost
[4:59] not just so that he could find and say
[5:01] oh there it is
[5:04] i'm looking for all there it is you know
[5:06] if you lose something of great value to
[5:08] yourself you go to seek
[5:10] amen and find that which was lost amen
[5:12] and when you find it you don't say oh
[5:14] there it is and turn around and walk
[5:15] back home
[5:16] that wasn't the purpose he came to find
[5:18] it to redeem it back to its original
[5:21] place
[5:23] hallelujah let's just bow our heads and
[5:25] ask the lord's blessing over the word
[5:27] lord jesus we thank you god for this
[5:29] wonderful day
[5:30] for this opportunity to gather lord let
[5:33] it not be a traditional gathering
[5:35] lord let it not be a habit lord my god
[5:37] let us come with earnest sincerity
[5:40] and dedication lord to worship you in
[5:42] spirit and in truth
[5:43] in order to hear what you have to say
[5:45] for us not a routine in our life
[5:47] but a predestinated meeting with you
[5:49] lord we pray that you would take control
[5:51] of this service have preeminence lord
[5:53] take control of this earthly vessel that
[5:55] you might speak eternal words through
[5:57] these lips
[5:58] and god that you might strike us lord
[6:00] with your word and
[6:01] bring us into a greater life than lift
[6:03] us into a greater manifestation
[6:05] that we might see you more clearly and
[6:07] see our position in you
[6:08] more clearly we ask your blessing over
[6:11] everything that would be said
[6:13] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[6:16] you can be you can be seated sorry i've
[6:20] got a quote here out of the mighty gun
[6:21] unveiled before us that i'd like to read
[6:25] this is from 1964 and as always i have a
[6:28] lot of quotes to read
[6:29] and we might get to him we'll see we'll
[6:31] see how the lord leads and
[6:32] how the congregation pulls amen amen
[6:36] because we know this is the joint effort
[6:38] but you know i was thinking i've got a
[6:40] lot of quotes and some long quotes to
[6:42] read and i
[6:42] i see ministers preach and they're so
[6:44] smooth and they're so good and they
[6:46] hit a quote and they go on and they
[6:48] don't spend all this time reading and
[6:50] they don't have
[6:51] 25 quotes and i thought man they're good
[6:53] they're smooth
[6:54] i like to do it like that but i can't do
[6:57] it like that i can only be what i am
[6:59] so i just pray that you bear with me i
[7:01] read a lot of quotes but i can't be
[7:03] anything other than what i am
[7:04] so just bear with me and the mighty god
[7:07] unveiled before us
[7:09] 1964 he says so god in the beginning was
[7:12] life
[7:13] the eternal one and him was attributes
[7:15] and those
[7:16] attributes became words and the word
[7:18] became flesh
[7:19] jesus was the redeemer and to redeem
[7:22] means to bring back
[7:24] if he has to bring it back it had to be
[7:26] somewhere to be brought back
[7:27] to how many of you believe you're
[7:30] redeemed
[7:31] oh that's enough right now we should
[7:33] close the service and go home rejoicing
[7:35] because if we've been redeemed it means
[7:37] we would somewhere to be redeemed back
[7:39] to
[7:39] there's been a position before there's
[7:41] been a placing before
[7:42] we've fallen from some position in some
[7:45] place that he came to seek and to save
[7:47] that which was lost
[7:48] to take it back to that place in that
[7:50] position
[7:51] hallelujah so you see all people will
[7:55] never be able to see it because all
[7:57] people wasn't in the beginning in god's
[7:59] thoughts
[8:00] see look at the priest when they see him
[8:03] express himself exactly with the word
[8:05] that he was they said it's beelzebub
[8:08] that shows where their nature was
[8:10] it was in the modern thought of the day
[8:13] oh praise god that shows where their
[8:16] thought was
[8:16] when he came to express the word amen
[8:19] they were in the modern thought of the
[8:20] day
[8:21] and so when he was expressing the word
[8:23] amen it was a
[8:24] true expression of a true word amen but
[8:27] because their thinking was carnal on the
[8:29] thoughts of today
[8:30] amen they rejected him and called him
[8:32] beelzebub because they
[8:34] they weren't from the thoughts of god
[8:36] and couldn't tap back
[8:37] to way before the thoughts of the modern
[8:39] day
[8:42] it was in the modern thought of the day
[8:44] but when the little prostitute that he
[8:46] met at the gate and told her expressed
[8:48] his
[8:48] messianic sign by telling her what she
[8:51] had done
[8:52] why she said sir i perceive that you are
[8:53] a prophet you know the messiah when he
[8:56] comes he will tell us all these things
[8:58] she was recognizing him as the messiah
[9:00] the anointed one
[9:01] because he met the scriptural
[9:03] qualifications don't you see
[9:05] the two pieces of paper were coming
[9:07] together
[9:08] she we know that when the messiah cometh
[9:12] now he's saying the two pieces were
[9:13] coming together i mean i'm going to
[9:15] spend some time on this today
[9:17] because if i take the laundry men's
[9:19] ticket you know brother bam told us
[9:20] about the chinese laundromat
[9:22] we know this really really well but he
[9:24] couldn't speak their language
[9:25] amen so what he did is when they came
[9:28] and took their laundry to the chinese
[9:29] laundry room and he took the ticket
[9:31] and he tore it in such a way
[9:36] then now you have two matching halves
[9:40] and to redeem your clothes
[9:45] to redeem back what's yours
[9:48] to put it back in its right spot these
[9:51] two pieces have to come together
[9:55] and when there's a perfect match
[9:57] redemption can take place
[10:00] amen so you see now that the chinese
[10:04] men's ticket if you take this ticket and
[10:05] you look at our lives amen
[10:07] there was there was a portion and there
[10:09] was a separation that took place
[10:11] and one part were carry but there's
[10:13] another part out there
[10:15] amen and when these two parts come
[10:17] together
[10:18] redemption can take place because
[10:20] remember these aren't two tickets
[10:24] these aren't two separate tickets this
[10:27] is one
[10:28] ticket tore into a mailpiece and a
[10:31] female
[10:32] piece and when the male and female come
[10:34] back together they're one
[10:36] they had one origin they were one in the
[10:38] beginning amen they
[10:39] only match each other they don't match
[10:42] anything else
[10:47] that's the elements to redemption that's
[10:49] the needed peace to redemption
[10:51] amen let's read on and you'll see what
[10:53] i'm talking about by the grace of god
[10:57] we're in the same quote now god might
[10:59] have had to interbreed this and that to
[11:01] get this certain king of the bell
[11:03] like the motor he's talking about your
[11:05] natural life he made your grandma and
[11:07] grandpa and the different personalities
[11:09] and
[11:09] different ones moved around and got in
[11:11] place to get you the certain way he was
[11:13] because he was going to allow a portion
[11:15] of his self
[11:16] his attribute his life to come into a
[11:18] fleshly condition
[11:19] and he molded around that something that
[11:22] he can use to express what was going to
[11:24] be in the inside
[11:25] to get that certain thing
[11:28] hallelujah
[11:32] like like the motor but when jesus turns
[11:34] said i am he that speaks with you
[11:36] there was no such expression as
[11:38] beelzebub
[11:39] she left her water pot ran into the city
[11:41] and said come see a man who told me the
[11:43] things that i've done
[11:45] isn't this the very messiah now what did
[11:48] what did this putting the old scripture
[11:50] with the experience that jesus was
[11:52] giving to her
[11:53] what did it do it made the messiah and
[11:55] did you notice
[11:56] quickly her sins were forgiven
[12:01] she never looked at him and said please
[12:03] forgive me of my sins
[12:05] but brother brennan says when she
[12:07] recognized the word made flesh for her
[12:09] day
[12:10] amen what was happening the two pieces
[12:12] were coming together
[12:14] when the two pieces come together that's
[12:16] the necessary amount
[12:17] elements for redemption and her sins
[12:20] were forgiven her
[12:22] how could the prophet say something like
[12:24] that he said it
[12:27] heard quickly her sins were forgiven
[12:29] because
[12:33] i know the next part that's why i'm
[12:35] excited
[12:37] her sins were forgiven because at the
[12:40] beginning
[12:41] she was redeemable because she was in
[12:43] god's thinking
[12:45] at the beginning because she was in
[12:48] god's thinking at the beginning
[12:50] part of god an expression of god she was
[12:53] redeemable
[12:54] and when she come in contact amen with
[12:56] the other half of the chinese ticket
[12:59] amen all the sudden she was redeemed
[13:02] amen and her sins were forgiven her
[13:08] she could have went to the synagogue
[13:10] over and over
[13:11] and over amen in that synagogue was that
[13:15] that old form amen looking back to what
[13:18] moses had done
[13:19] was not able her to deliver her out of
[13:21] her sinful condition
[13:25] but now something was coming amen
[13:27] because she had something inside of her
[13:30] amen that didn't match the way the
[13:32] priest explained the scriptures
[13:36] but she had something in her that was
[13:38] waiting for the scriptures to be made
[13:40] manifest in a word
[13:42] that matched the way she was made
[13:47] there was nothing wrong with the
[13:48] scriptures
[13:50] but they had been filtered through the
[13:51] mind of man and she couldn't find a
[13:54] match in the synagogue
[13:57] not because moses was wrong not because
[13:59] the scriptures were wrong
[14:01] but because the way the men were
[14:02] explaining it
[14:04] but when when the messiah came and he
[14:07] showed her the sign of the messiah
[14:09] and he began to answer her question
[14:11] about worship
[14:12] who worships where worship is the kind
[14:14] of true worship
[14:16] all of a sudden there was something that
[14:18] word that that moses had spoke was
[14:20] standing in front of her
[14:22] the word made flesh in her day and she
[14:25] had a matching piece
[14:27] down in the soul and when those two came
[14:29] together
[14:30] her sins were forgiven she had power to
[14:33] overcome
[14:34] something that the synagogue couldn't do
[14:36] something the priest couldn't do
[14:38] but when the two pieces came together it
[14:40] accomplished the goal
[14:43] quickly your sins were forgiven because
[14:45] at the beginning she was redeemable
[14:46] because she was in god's thinking at the
[14:48] beginning so
[14:50] it redeemed her or brought her back
[14:54] when she seen the express scripture
[14:56] manifest
[14:57] of jehovah what he was what he is
[15:01] what did it do it redeemed her
[15:04] praise be to god i just want to tell you
[15:08] this was before calvary
[15:14] what's what's wrong with the prophet
[15:16] does he not know this was before calvary
[15:18] he knows it's before calvary because
[15:20] calvary paid the price of redemption
[15:24] but the price of redemption and the act
[15:26] of redemption are not the same thing
[15:28] there on calvary he paid the price of
[15:30] redemption
[15:31] amen i can you know i you remember the
[15:34] story brother yatzik told about the
[15:36] little boat
[15:38] now your mind your double mind amen the
[15:40] little boat
[15:41] amen he lost and and the little boy made
[15:44] the boat he lost the little boat
[15:45] amen he loved it he found it in the pawn
[15:47] shop and he wanted to get it
[15:49] and the man was holding claims to it so
[15:51] he had to pay the price of redemption
[15:53] he paid the price of redemption is not
[15:56] the
[15:56] act of redemption remember you could
[15:59] lose an item and you can find it online
[16:01] in an online auction or on an online
[16:05] pawn shop and you can send
[16:09] your money through paypal
[16:13] you've paid the price of redemption
[16:16] but the act of redemption is when you
[16:18] take that item back to yourself
[16:23] so this woman had come to the act of
[16:25] redemption before the price of
[16:26] redemption was paid
[16:28] but that's no problem with god because
[16:30] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[16:31] of the world and the mind of god
[16:33] so god already knew the price was paid
[16:35] amen the price wasn't paid at calvary
[16:38] the price was paid in the mind of god
[16:40] before the foundation of the world
[16:42] but it was manifest or played out in
[16:45] time
[16:45] on calvary that's why god could redeem
[16:49] abraham and he could redeem isaac and
[16:52] jacob he could
[16:53] redeem all of them by what by faith in
[16:56] his word
[16:57] [Applause]
[16:58] but there had to be a price paid for
[17:01] redemption
[17:02] but that price was paid before the
[17:03] foundation of the world but in this
[17:05] dimension it had to be acted out it had
[17:08] to be portrayed
[17:09] it had to be manifest
[17:12] see it redeemed her or brought her back
[17:20] further on now when jesus come if he had
[17:23] come with noah's message
[17:24] it wouldn't have worked to build an ark
[17:26] and float out it wouldn't have worked
[17:28] but that noah was a portion of god he
[17:30] acted a peculiar way because he was
[17:32] peculiar
[17:33] and his message was peculiar because it
[17:35] was the word being made manifest
[17:37] he could not have come with moses
[17:39] message because it wouldn't have worked
[17:42] that was the problem at the synagogue
[17:45] doesn't
[17:46] fit good word
[17:50] but not manifest in the right age
[17:54] truth but not manifest in the right way
[17:57] she could never find the matching piece
[18:00] at the synagogue
[18:02] oh praise be to god now you know why
[18:06] nothing made sense till you found the
[18:07] message
[18:09] nothing made sense that you found christ
[18:11] the word made manifest today
[18:16] he was the word expressed for that hour
[18:18] but jesus
[18:20] could not come in that the bible never
[18:22] said he would come in that way
[18:23] but when he come expressed exactly like
[18:26] the testament had said he would be
[18:27] expressed
[18:28] then all those who was redeemable
[18:30] believed
[18:33] all those who were redeemable believed
[18:35] it because they were the thoughts of god
[18:38] the attributes of him at the beginning
[18:40] was made flesh and redeemable
[18:42] and was brought back to god and amen so
[18:44] to be redeemable you had to be his
[18:46] thought from the beginning
[18:48] and was brought back to god as many as
[18:51] receive him to them gave he power to
[18:53] become sons of god
[18:55] because they were redeemable they were
[18:57] from the beginning
[18:58] in the expression now
[19:02] in the message it is the rising of the
[19:03] sun he says and god knows hallelujah
[19:06] he's got a predestined for ordained
[19:08] church he knows he's got sons and
[19:10] daughters and a bride waiting somewhere
[19:12] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[19:14] at that wave sheath oh my
[19:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[19:17] forever not some mythical story
[19:20] but a reality no matter how many tried
[19:22] to tell him an ego
[19:24] he didn't know what an ego was yet he
[19:26] was an eagle
[19:27] he could not understand it until he seen
[19:29] something that reflected him
[19:30] that he reflected rather and when he's
[19:33] seen not a denomination not a phd not an
[19:36] lld
[19:38] not a good neighbor but a son of god
[19:39] molded in the image of god
[19:41] with that dynamic power of god to answer
[19:43] the request of this day
[19:45] that he's the same yesterday today and
[19:47] forever there ain't no hen going to hold
[19:49] you
[19:50] he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to
[19:52] begin with
[19:53] he recognizes this real eagle recognizes
[19:56] the call of god's word why
[19:58] he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle
[20:03] who screamed eagle what herd
[20:07] eagle the same thing
[20:10] calling is the same thing responding
[20:14] if there's a deep calling there's a deep
[20:16] to respond
[20:17] deep to deep eagle to eagle
[20:22] amen an eagle to an eagle the word from
[20:25] the foundation
[20:27] get this the word before the foundation
[20:30] the word
[20:31] to the word the word predestinated
[20:35] to the word written for the hour you
[20:38] realize your position
[20:39] he hunts for it so he says the word to
[20:42] the word
[20:43] he says the word predestinated the part
[20:46] that was in that little woman
[20:48] amen to the word written for that hour
[20:50] being expressed in that hour
[20:52] and when those two pieces came together
[20:55] that was it
[20:56] she was redeemed her sins were forgiven
[20:58] she was brought back to god
[21:02] oh hallelujah friends amen it's not
[21:04] another portion that doesn't fit
[21:06] but it's got to be the portion made
[21:09] flesh
[21:09] the portion revealed the portion made
[21:11] manifest in this day
[21:13] amen not a previous age this age not a
[21:16] previous day
[21:17] this day and when the word is made
[21:19] manifest this day the scripture is
[21:20] written for this
[21:21] hour that we're living in brother bram
[21:25] says what is the word bride
[21:26] the manifestation of this hour
[21:31] amen the manifestation of this hour not
[21:33] previous dispensations
[21:35] but what is the manifestation of this
[21:36] hour the word bride
[21:39] when that portion of the written
[21:40] scripture is made manifest
[21:42] it is the other part of the line through
[21:44] men's ticket amen and all we have to do
[21:46] is express
[21:47] the bride amen made manifest fleshing
[21:50] out this word
[21:51] living the word living what the prophet
[21:53] taught not reading what the prophet
[21:55] taught
[21:55] living what the prophet taught not not
[21:58] just pointing somebody to what he taught
[22:00] but manifesting it living it
[22:02] being the word made flesh in a
[22:04] mini-membered body
[22:05] that's the other part of the
[22:06] laundryman's ticket
[22:09] and there's pieces that are laying out
[22:11] there that's got to come in contact with
[22:13] the word made
[22:14] manifest for this day for this
[22:17] hour they have to see what the word
[22:20] is not what the word was
[22:24] but the what the word is
[22:27] brother brahman said in the message what
[22:29] shall i do with this jesus called christ
[22:31] 1963
[22:33] and all these things that he prophesied
[22:35] to be in this day something has to bring
[22:37] that to life
[22:38] but when it's brought to life it'll be
[22:39] so much different than the people thinks
[22:41] it is
[22:43] it'll only be the elect we'll see it
[22:46] always just the elect is the only thing
[22:48] that'll see it because it is elected and
[22:51] ordained
[22:51] to see it therefore it cannot
[22:56] no other way but i said who is this
[22:59] melchizedek
[23:02] god vindicates that that's always been
[23:04] right god vindicates it
[23:06] to be true shown plainly
[23:10] the predestinated is the only one that's
[23:12] considered in redemption
[23:16] did you get it let me say that again the
[23:20] predestinated is the only one that's
[23:22] considered in redemption
[23:23] people might make like think they are
[23:25] but the real redemption is those that
[23:27] are predestinated
[23:28] because the very word redeem means to
[23:31] bring back
[23:32] is that right the redeem is something to
[23:35] redeem anything
[23:36] is bring it back to its original place
[23:38] hallelujah so it's only the
[23:39] predestinated will be brought back
[23:41] because the others didn't come from
[23:43] their sea bring back
[23:45] bring eternal with him at the beginning
[23:47] the eternal life that you had
[23:49] his thought of what you was only he
[23:51] wanted you
[23:52] he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say
[23:55] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[23:58] we were his eternal thought from before
[24:00] but his eternal thought wanted to find
[24:02] expression
[24:03] in time in this dimension and he wanted
[24:05] to find expression
[24:06] with me standing in the pulpit tonight
[24:08] and you sitting in the sea
[24:09] or today we might still be here tonight
[24:12] i don't know
[24:14] praise god
[24:19] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[24:23] and the one that left home only come to
[24:25] the earth to serve his purpose
[24:27] i like that language the one that left
[24:29] home
[24:31] only come to earth to serve his purpose
[24:34] i mean have we recognized this world is
[24:36] not my home
[24:38] i come from home and i'm going back to
[24:40] home and i come
[24:41] home to home i come from home to earth
[24:44] amen
[24:45] to serve his purpose is that right all
[24:47] right then after it's finished it's
[24:49] brought back in a glorified state
[24:51] it's matured and brought back again
[24:54] no wonder paul could say when this was a
[24:56] building
[24:57] a block to chop his head off death wears
[25:00] your sting
[25:00] oh grave where is your victory but
[25:02] thanks be to god who gives us the
[25:04] victory he said death
[25:05] tell me where you can make me holler
[25:07] grave tell me how you're going to hold
[25:08] me
[25:09] for i'm a possessor of eternal life he's
[25:12] recognized that death hell grave
[25:14] nothing could hold him and nothing can
[25:16] hurt us got eternal life
[25:18] he realized he was blessed with eternal
[25:20] life
[25:21] just like a little dewdrop it
[25:24] understands i don't know how to
[25:26] how to too much about i don't know too
[25:28] much about chemistry
[25:29] it must be that the congealing of
[25:31] humidity or atmosphere
[25:33] and when the night gets cold and dark it
[25:35] falls from heaven and drops upon the
[25:36] ground
[25:37] it fell from somewhere i talked about
[25:39] this a couple weeks ago
[25:40] and another and another message from
[25:42] birth pains but here he's bringing it up
[25:43] and who is this melchizedek
[25:45] he's trying to get us to understand we
[25:47] came from home
[25:48] we're down here serving his purpose and
[25:50] we're going back home and so he starts
[25:52] to tell the story of a dew drop
[25:54] [Applause]

[25:56] trying to get us to understand
[25:58] we've come from home we're going back
[26:00] home

[26:04] night amen there was a congealing of
[26:06] atmospheres

[26:09] visible
[26:12] something in the heavens amen which was

[26:22] us he's trying to tell us where he came
[26:23] from
[26:24] and where we're going
[26:28] the congealing of humidity or atmosphere
[26:30] and when the night gets cold and dark it
[26:31] falls from the heavens and drops upon
[26:33] the ground
[26:34] it fell from somewhere but the next
[26:37] morning before the sun comes up it's
[26:39] laying there the little fellow shivering
[26:41] he just let the sun come up watch it go
[26:43] to shining

[33:56] foundation of the world i was in the
[33:58] mind of god and the thoughts of god i
[34:00] was already saved already redeemed
[34:02] already that but then he come to this
[34:04] dimension to act out his
[34:06] thoughts to display to manifest the
[34:09] thoughts of god
[34:10] in the element of time and everything's
[34:12] taking place in time
[34:13] amen so i say that day i got saved no

[34:37] in time the manifestation of the
[34:39] thoughts of god the word of god
[34:41] amen now has come down to manifestation
[34:44] in the element of time which god created
[34:46] and doesn't exist in
[34:50] but he's dropped down brother said this
[34:52] little hickey out of eternity
[34:54] called time and he's manifesting
[34:56] something he's doing something he's
[34:57] accomplishing a work we're doing this
[34:59] according to his purpose amen
[35:00] but we're here by his placing according
[35:03] to his purpose to accomplish something

[35:14] of god
[35:15] in the thoughts of god all the works
[35:17] were finished before
[35:20] so they were already accomplished in the
[35:22] mind of god his thoughts are eternal
[35:24] they are real amen and now what we're
[35:26] doing is in time
[35:28] now we're fleshing out in this dimension
[35:30] what has
[35:31] already taken place in the mind of god
[35:33] when jesus was nailed amen to the cross
[35:35] at calvary
[35:36] he was just fleshing out in this
[35:38] dimension what had already taken place
[35:40] in his mind
[35:44] we are as secure as secure can be when
[35:47] there comes a revelation amen
[35:48] faith that gives you a substance that
[35:50] gives you evidence there's no more being
[35:52] tossed about
[35:53] no more being afraid all the time no
[35:55] more afraid i'm not going to make it
[35:57] will i make the rapture
[35:58] am i good enough will god accept me this
[36:00] way he already accepted you if you'll
[36:02] ever be accepted you were already
[36:04] accepted before the foundation of the
[36:06] world when your name was put in the
[36:08] lamb's book of life
[36:09] that cannot be erased what is the
[36:12] message trying to do in this day
[36:13] it's trying to bring a security to the
[36:15] bride that makes her unshakeable
[36:17] unstoppable an invincible army because
[36:19] she's already made it the works are
[36:21] already finished she's just acting out
[36:23] for god's purpose what god once done
[36:26] in you this day
[36:29] and if god wants me arrested then i want
[36:31] to be arrested
[36:32] paul and silas amen and chains they
[36:35] could sing amen they could rejoice
[36:37] why because nothing is out of the plan
[36:39] of god everything's ticking right on
[36:41] time
[36:42] when you're talking about a
[36:43] predestinated seed of god
[36:45] nothing's out of kilter nothing's a
[36:48] mistake
[36:50] they could be in jail and bonds being
[36:53] bitten beaten
[36:54] being strapped being chained they could
[36:55] begin to sing and begin to rejoice
[36:58] because if i'm in a prison and i'm in
[37:00] chains i'm
[37:01] here because god thought it before the
[37:03] foundation of the world
[37:07] hey a real revelation of the truth amen
[37:10] is going to absolutely change our
[37:11] behavior
[37:13] we're going to stop walking around
[37:15] afraid of our own shadow
[37:16] amen scared of what's going to happen
[37:18] next worried about everything in life
[37:22] that's normal in a human condition
[37:24] things will happen your initial reaction
[37:26] will be fear
[37:27] anxiety amen that's just the human
[37:30] element
[37:31] that'll always be there but there's
[37:33] something in the watchtower now
[37:35] amen there's a life on the inside that
[37:37] has been there before
[37:38] that knows amen was in the thoughts of
[37:40] god before and that control tower will
[37:42] raise up and say
[37:43] hold it all as well
[37:48] everything's fine
[37:51] don't be afraid it is i
[37:57] there's nothing to be afraid of friends
[37:59] there's nothing to be nervous about
[38:01] there's nothing to be scared about
[38:03] everything is fine
[38:10] see people so timid so afraid all the
[38:14] time
[38:15] so worried that can be a natural
[38:17] condition
[38:18] some of us get more of that through the
[38:20] family genetics than others
[38:22] but there's a revelation that'll conquer
[38:24] that thing
[38:26] there's a real revelation that comes
[38:28] from god that'll start to push that
[38:29] thing down
[38:30] say i'm not going to be controlled by
[38:31] fear anxiety
[38:33] from the family tree from depression
[38:35] what do i have to be depressed about
[38:37] what do i have to be anxious about what
[38:39] do i have to be nervous about amen
[38:41] there's a substance in me there's an
[38:42] evidence in me that says i was there if
[38:46] i was there
[38:46] the footsteps of the righteous are
[38:48] ordered to the lord
[38:50] that's either true or not true that's
[38:52] not one of those halfway statements it's
[38:54] either ordered or it's not ordered and i
[38:56] and i believe by faith they're ordered
[39:01] amen
[39:06] brother ben says again and who is this
[39:07] melchizedek
[39:10] now we find him at the beginning his
[39:11] attributes and now you were with him
[39:13] then
[39:14] oh i hope that sinks in you were with
[39:17] him then
[39:21] then is when the book of life comes into
[39:23] view
[39:24] now we read over here in revelation 13
[39:26] the chapter 8 verse
[39:28] that the beast that comes up of the
[39:29] earth in the last days will deceive all
[39:31] whose
[39:31] people who on earth whose names were not
[39:33] written in the lamb's book of life
[39:34] before the foundation of the world
[39:36] think of it before jesus was ever born
[39:38] four thousand years before he came on
[39:40] earth and several thousand years before
[39:41] you came on earth
[39:42] jesus in god's mind died for the sins of
[39:45] the world
[39:46] and the book of life was made and your
[39:48] name was put on the book of life before
[39:50] the foundational world
[39:51] that's the bible truth see your name was
[39:53] ordained of god and placed on the book
[39:55] of
[39:56] life before the foundation of the world
[39:58] you were there in his
[39:59] attributes you don't remember it no
[40:01] because you're just part of his life
[40:05] you're just part of his life so my
[40:07] brother said you can no more be lost
[40:09] than god can be
[40:10] lost you
[40:13] you don't get eternal life you've always
[40:14] had eternal life because you're part of
[40:16] his life
[40:22] sir we see jesus in 1964 in the
[40:24] beginning god was not even god he was
[40:26] the great eternal
[40:27] and then there was attributes attributes
[40:29] was his thoughts
[40:30] and then he become a word like this and
[40:32] a word expressed well a thought
[40:34] expresses a word
[40:35] a word expresses a thought and then
[40:37] remember if you ever was in god's
[40:39] thinking you'll always be there
[40:44] if you've got eternal life you are the
[40:46] expression or the attribute
[40:48] of his thought for this age
[40:53] get that god thought when he thought
[40:57] he thought of all the ages
[41:01] you realize that you're not in this age
[41:04] by accident
[41:06] you've not showed up in the last day in
[41:08] the end time
[41:09] in the closing hours of of this earth in
[41:12] this
[41:13] time as we know it you've not arrived
[41:15] here by chance or by accident but you
[41:17] were his thought
[41:18] you were his thought of this age
[41:22] that means you've been precisely placed
[41:24] in the right spot for the right
[41:26] expression
[41:28] that means no matter you say this is
[41:30] satan's eating it's so hard
[41:32] amen it's so hard to grow up in satan's
[41:34] eden
[41:35] no it's not
[41:40] it's so hard why it's only hard
[41:44] if you're stuck in spiritual amnesia and
[41:46] don't realize
[41:47] who you are then it's hard yes there's
[41:50] temptations all around
[41:51] it's come to saints in the peak amen
[41:54] he's exerting the greatest power amen
[41:56] he's had over the earth and the greatest
[41:57] influence is everywhere
[41:59] but don't forget you're a thought of god
[42:01] an attribute of god
[42:02] an expression of god that he thought of
[42:05] being expressed
[42:06] in this hour that means you you have in
[42:09] you
[42:10] the potential amen everything that's
[42:13] needed to overcome
[42:14] satan's eating is already in you because
[42:16] god placed you here
[42:18] in this expression in this age before
[42:20] the foundation of the world
[42:21] you will not be overcome by satan's
[42:23] eating but you will overcome
[42:25] satan's eden
[42:28] what about our children and what about
[42:29] that oh man just get them to the lord
[42:32] amen let the holy ghost quicken that
[42:33] seed inside and let them get a
[42:35] revelation of who they are
[42:36] where they come from where they're going
[42:38] what their purpose is
[42:40] and they'll overcome satan's eating they
[42:42] will absolutely
[42:44] overcome because god has ordained
[42:47] that they will overcome
[42:50] we're not afraid of the age we've been
[42:54] predestinated to this
[42:56] age and we've been predestinated to
[42:59] overcome in this age
[43:01] so there's no fear in this age i'm
[43:03] looking forward
[43:04] to overcoming this age i
[43:08] inside of me amen not my mental
[43:10] capability
[43:11] not the earthly human spirit not this
[43:13] flesh but inside of me
[43:15] amen is an attribute a life of god a
[43:18] portion of god himself that he ordained
[43:21] to be expressed in this age
[43:23] i'm looking forward to living in this
[43:25] day it's going to get worse
[43:26] praise god i've got something already
[43:29] ordained to overcome the worst
[43:31] of the worst of the worst
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:36] the prophet talks about a persecution
[43:38] coming on the brine they'll try to stop
[43:39] her from preaching they'll close these
[43:41] churches
[43:41] she'll be a hunted persecuted little
[43:43] group praise god
[43:45] something in me is already
[43:47] pre-programmed to meet that challenge of
[43:49] that day
[43:49] if i'm alive in this body when those
[43:52] things begin to unfold it's because god
[43:54] already saw me overcoming those
[43:56] conditions
[43:58] i'm not afraid of that amen if i fear
[44:02] those things
[44:03] then i pray god give me a greater
[44:05] revelation so that i realize
[44:07] i'm not here by accident i'm not placed
[44:09] here the prophet didn't say those things
[44:11] to scare us
[44:14] there's no fear it's the final
[44:16] destruction of our enemy
[44:17] it's the final blow it's putting the
[44:19] enemy finally under the feet of the
[44:21] bride and it's
[44:22] eden god built in eden
[44:25] satan slipped in to destroy god's eden
[44:29] so satan now has taken six thousand
[44:31] years to build need
[44:33] and god has slipped in
[44:37] god slipped in how did he slip in
[44:43] god slipped into satan's eating his age
[44:46] how did he slipped in
[44:47] he slept he slipped in in the form of
[44:49] his bride
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:53] and just as when satan slipped in in the
[44:56] serpent
[44:57] and began a deception the bride has
[45:00] slipped in
[45:02] and now she's going to uncover the
[45:03] deception
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:06] and just as god's eden was destroyed
[45:08] satan's eden is going to be destroyed by
[45:10] what
[45:11] by god's secret commando army
[45:18] do you realize you're not just a mom
[45:20] raising babies
[45:22] you're not just a kid in school you're
[45:24] not just a man making a living for your
[45:26] family
[45:28] you're an elite fighting force
[45:34] you know you would have never been happy
[45:35] in luther's day
[45:38] you'd have never been happy in wesley
[45:40] day you say oh if i could have lived
[45:42] back if i could live back where you just
[45:45] took a prairie schooner and
[45:46] you got a couple horses together and got
[45:48] your family and just clip-clop
[45:49] down the trail to go you'd have never
[45:51] survived there because you were
[45:53] pre-programmed for this day
[45:55] you're designed by god to overcome these
[45:58] conditions overcome
[45:59] this day does it destroy the works of
[46:02] the devil
[46:02] and he will god will put them under your
[46:05] feet
[46:06] shortly you're god's elite fighting
[46:08] force that he saved
[46:10] for the last that he saved for the worst
[46:14] condition
[46:16] oh you've got what it takes
[46:19] you already got what it takes it's
[46:21] already designed it's already
[46:23] happened that's why amen that's why
[46:27] a prophet could see it because god's
[46:29] already seen it he could show it to a
[46:31] prophet so that means it's already
[46:32] happened
[46:35] now we're just now we're just going
[46:36] through the motions as it's going
[46:37] manifest in this time element
[46:40] now it's being completed here but it's
[46:42] already been completed there
[46:44] that's how god could show the prophet
[46:46] things that will happen in the future
[46:47] amen if if god shows him things that'll
[46:49] happen in the future that means it's
[46:51] already happened
[46:56] so when it happens it's just happening
[46:58] again
[47:00] remember brother branham when he would
[47:01] get amen when he would get a vision of a
[47:03] healing
[47:05] and he would go into a room and he says
[47:07] no this person's got to be sitting there
[47:09] and this hat has to be sitting there and
[47:11] the kid why he's already seen it it's
[47:13] already happened
[47:16] so when it happens it's happening again
[47:20] when you overcome you're overcoming
[47:22] again
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] when you face a trial you're facing a
[47:28] trial again
[47:31] it's already been in the thoughts of god
[47:33] now it's made manifest in flesh
[47:37] we're not afraid of what comes next not
[47:40] afraid of the doctor's report
[47:41] not afraid of a new government official
[47:44] not afraid of new laws that are coming
[47:46] down the pipe people get
[47:47] so worried about politics they're
[47:49] changing the rules and you know
[47:51] you just get something they change and
[47:53] all of a sudden
[47:54] it hits you know uh whatsapp or text
[47:57] message or emails
[47:58] and it goes everywhere let's all pray
[48:00] they're trying to change this and
[48:01] they're trying to change that law
[48:02] let them change the laws what are they
[48:06] going to do
[48:06] circumvent god's plan do you think
[48:08] they're going to change what god's
[48:09] ordained
[48:10] forget about politics politics has
[48:12] nothing to do with us
[48:14] the world's falling apart brother man
[48:16] said let it fall apart
[48:17] don't try to prop it up the faster it
[48:19] falls apart the better it is for you and
[48:21] i
[48:23] i'm not here to prop up the government
[48:25] and prop up the i'm just here to live
[48:27] the life god's ordained me to live
[48:29] according to what he's already seen
[48:33] let it go let politics go let policy go
[48:36] let government officials go it's not
[48:38] going to get any better
[48:42] oh they're going to change the laws and
[48:43] restrict churches and you're going to
[48:45] have
[48:45] hate speech laws and perfect
[48:51] if that's what god wants that's what i
[48:53] want
[48:55] if that's what god ordains that's what i
[48:57] want
[48:59] why because god has chosen us to express
[49:02] him in this age and in this day
[49:05] you're his thought let me read this
[49:08] again
[49:14] you are the attribute of his thought for
[49:17] this age
[49:19] so there's no more longing for another
[49:21] age
[49:22] oh i wish i was here when brother
[49:24] branham was here no sir
[49:27] i would have missed my whole purpose oh
[49:30] i wish i would have been here to be in
[49:32] the prayer lines i don't like to see in
[49:33] a prayer life i'd
[49:34] like to be an eyewitness but god wants
[49:35] me here i want me here
[49:39] i want my thoughts to start matching
[49:40] god's thoughts amen not carnal ideas or
[49:42] carnal thoughts not longing for another
[49:44] day
[49:45] not longing for a previous age not long
[49:47] for another time
[49:48] but i want to be right here doing what
[49:49] he's ordained for me to do in this hour
[49:52] and i want to do it with boldness and i
[49:53] want to do it with confidence and i want
[49:54] to do it with
[49:56] joy
[49:59] we're not afraid
[50:03] we're still in search we would see jesus
[50:06] there's only one eternal life
[50:07] and it always existed and you in his
[50:10] mind existed before there was a world
[50:13] you and his mind existed before there
[50:15] was a world that's the reason he said he
[50:17] chose you before the foundation of the
[50:19] world
[50:19] it's not what we think what somebody
[50:21] else thinks it's what god eternal you
[50:23] always was see
[50:25] in his thinking
[50:30] who is this melchizedek again now in the
[50:32] beginning
[50:33] god dwelt alone with his attributes as i
[50:35] spoke of this morning
[50:36] that's his thoughts there was nothing
[50:38] just god alone but he had thoughts
[50:41] just like a great architect can sit down
[50:43] in his mind and draw what he thinks
[50:45] he's going to build create he cannot
[50:46] create he can take something that's been
[50:48] created and make it in a different form
[50:50] because god is the only
[50:51] way only one can create but he gets in
[50:54] his mind what he's going to do and
[50:55] that's his thoughts and that's his
[50:57] desires now it's a thought then he
[50:59] speaks it it's a word then
[51:01] a thought when it's expressed it's a
[51:02] word a thought expressed as a word
[51:05] but it has to be a thought first so it's
[51:08] god's attributes then it becomes a
[51:10] thought
[51:10] than a word i want to read something out
[51:14] of the church age book that i think will
[51:15] help us right now
[51:18] in the smyrnan church age out of the
[51:20] church age book
[51:23] he says the eternal thoughts of god let
[51:24] me ask you are the thoughts of god
[51:26] eternal
[51:28] are you one of those thoughts
[51:32] if you can see this you can see many
[51:34] things
[51:35] here's a brother so he's honing us in
[51:37] he's trying to get us to dial in
[51:39] the eternal thoughts of god let me ask
[51:40] you are the thoughts of god eternal if
[51:41] you can see this
[51:43] you can see many things god is
[51:45] unchangeable on both essence and
[51:47] behavior
[51:48] we have studied that and proven that
[51:50] already god is infinite in his
[51:52] abilities so that therefore he as god
[51:54] must be omniscient
[51:55] if he is omniscient then he he is not
[51:58] now learning nor
[51:59] is he taking counsel even with himself
[52:02] nor is he at any time adding to his
[52:04] knowledge
[52:04] if he can add to his knowledge and he is
[52:06] not omniscient the best we could say is
[52:08] that
[52:09] sometime he will be but that is not
[52:11] scriptural
[52:12] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[52:14] thought about anything because all his
[52:16] thoughts he has always had
[52:18] and always will have and knows the end
[52:20] from the beginning because he is god
[52:23] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[52:26] they are
[52:27] real this is the part if we can hone in
[52:30] on
[52:31] just just lock in on this for a minute
[52:33] and pray for revelation
[52:35] because this isn't going to come by
[52:36] carnal understanding
[52:39] the thoughts of god are eternal they are
[52:40] real they are not simply like a man with
[52:43] a blueprint
[52:44] he has drawn up which one day will be
[52:45] translated into substance and form
[52:47] but they are already real and eternal
[52:50] and part of god
[52:52] you realize the thoughts of god are not
[52:54] like ours we cannot draw a parallel
[52:56] between these two
[52:57] you say that was in the thoughts of god
[52:59] that doesn't mean that god was just
[53:00] having a thought like you and i will sit
[53:02] and think
[53:02] and then we'll draw it out on paper and
[53:04] someday it'll become real
[53:06] no god's thoughts are already eternal
[53:08] they are already
[53:09] real they are already a real
[53:12] real thing they are a real substance
[53:14] they already exist
[53:16] so we can't equate god's thoughts to our
[53:19] thoughts we can't draw an equal life
[53:20] it is totally different god's thoughts
[53:22] are eternal attributes of himself
[53:24] god's thoughts are already his family
[53:28] they are real and they are eternal not
[53:31] will be real
[53:32] they're real when something comes
[53:35] manifest into this dimension
[53:37] doesn't make it real brother ben said
[53:40] this dimension is a vapor
[53:42] the scripture said this is a mist
[53:45] brother ben said this is the negative
[53:46] that's the positive this is a negative
[53:50] reflection of a positive somewhere else
[53:52] so this isn't the real this is a
[53:54] reflection of the real that's the real
[53:57] so when brother man said god's thoughts
[53:59] are real they're eternal
[54:00] they're not like our thoughts it's not
[54:03] like
[54:03] i think this and someday i'll do it and
[54:06] then it'll be real
[54:08] no he's already thought it it's already
[54:09] done it's already real
[54:12] now the positive is reflecting in the
[54:16] negative
[54:17] and this is a reflection of what's
[54:19] already
[54:21] in the positive
[54:24] so we have to stop thinking of god's
[54:26] thoughts as a fairy tale or a myth or a
[54:29] vapor this is the vapor
[54:31] that's the reality we got it absolutely
[54:34] backwards
[54:37] that'll help us as we move forward
[54:44] let's turn to job chapter 38.
[54:58] you know i could say it like this
[55:03] david when he became king
[55:07] he was already ordained to that position
[55:09] he's already told he'd be that position
[55:11] he's already god's choice
[55:14] when david moved into that position and
[55:16] began to lead his armies in the battle
[55:19] david wasn't hoping he'd win
[55:26] when david met goliath on the
[55:27] battlefield he wasn't hoping it would
[55:29] work
[55:33] why because he was already in the
[55:35] thoughts of god and god had already
[55:36] ordained him to be king
[55:40] he was going to lead the armies he was
[55:43] going to be
[55:44] the king of israel so when he went on
[55:47] the battlefield
[55:48] david began to run towards goliath
[55:53] he wasn't you know he didn't get five
[55:56] stones and
[55:57] he didn't say you know oh man i hope i i
[56:00] hope i didn't make a mistake
[56:03] i hope everything's going to work out
[56:05] all right at the end of the day
[56:06] i hope i see my dad again it wasn't that
[56:10] attitude because he had faith in what he
[56:12] was doing because he believed what he
[56:13] had been told
[56:14] he knew his position he knew what he was
[56:16] called to he had a purpose he had a
[56:18] calling
[56:18] and so now he was that was driving away
[56:20] all fear and all anxiety
[56:22] his purpose and his position was moving
[56:25] him into action
[56:27] then we become the king i mean he wasn't
[56:29] he wasn't leading his men in the battle
[56:31] hoping they win he knew that they would
[56:33] win
[56:34] because that was his position that was
[56:35] his calling
[56:37] and friends we're not walking through
[56:38] this life hoping we'll overcome
[56:41] we're not hoping everything will be all
[56:43] right we're not hoping we'll win
[56:45] hoping we'll overcome it's already
[56:47] prophesied we win
[56:49] we overcome the enemy is defeated
[56:52] there's no
[56:52] no weapon formed against you that shall
[56:54] prosper nothing is going to defeat god's
[56:57] purpose in our lives there's no reason
[56:59] to be afraid
[57:00] there's no reason to worry there's no
[57:01] reason to hope it'll work out
[57:03] it's working out right now it's working
[57:05] out perfect
[57:06] all the plans are perfect everything's
[57:09] set in order and you say oh
[57:11] russia's got a new nuclear weapon that
[57:13] we can't stop that's what the prophet

[57:46] general now everybody's getting upset
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:53] if everything falls apart
[57:56] and everything around me goes to chaos
[57:59] it's part of the plan of god
[58:04] it's something god wants to accomplish
[58:06] it's something god wants to manifest
[58:08] it's something he's already seen
[58:14] this message came to break spiritual
[58:16] amnesia
[58:18] this message came to break us out of
[58:20] carnal thinking
[58:22] out of a laodicean condition came to
[58:24] break us
[58:25] out amen of amnesia to get us to realize
[58:29] who we actually are and where we came
[58:32] from and where we're going and what
[58:33] we're doing here on this earth
[58:35] there's nothing to be afraid of friends
[58:38] job 38
[58:40] verse 4
[58:44] where was thou when i laid the
[58:46] foundations of the earth
[58:48] declareth thou hast understanding who
[58:50] hath laid the measures thereof with thou
[58:52] knowest
[58:52] or who has stretched the line upon it
[58:55] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[58:57] fastened
[58:57] or who laid the cornerstone thereof when
[59:00] the morning stars sing together and all
[59:02] the sons of god
[59:03] shouted for joy let's look at what the
[59:06] prophet says about this
[59:08] passage of scripture in 1958 in the
[59:12] serpent seed
[59:13] it says dear god the great mighty god
[59:15] who formed all things by power of his
[59:17] spirit and has brought jesus christ
[59:19] his only begotten son who freely died
[59:21] for we sinners
[59:22] the just for the unjust to reconcile us
[59:24] back to his marvelous fellowship that we
[59:26] had again with god
[59:28] as we are taught in the blessed word
[59:29] that we had fellowship with him before
[59:31] the foundation of the world
[59:32] when the morning stars sang together and
[59:35] the sons of god shouted for joy
[59:37] way back before the foundation of the
[59:39] world
[59:41] look what the prophet saying we already
[59:43] had fellowship with him
[59:46] but we don't remember it we come with
[59:49] spiritual amnesia we had to come with
[59:50] spiritual amnesia to be proved to be
[59:52] tested amen so that the attribute of god
[59:54] could be proved and manifested
[59:56] amen but we were there
[59:59] we were in the thoughts of god now
[1:00:01] remember the thoughts of god
[1:00:02] are not like our thoughts they're real
[1:00:05] you were really there you weren't kind
[1:00:08] of there
[1:00:09] amen sometimes people try to poo poo
[1:00:10] this idea by saying well that was just
[1:00:12] in the thoughts of god oh yeah just in
[1:00:14] the thoughts of god
[1:00:17] the thoughts of god are more real than
[1:00:19] this world the thoughts of god are more
[1:00:21] tangible in this world it's more of a
[1:00:22] reality than this reality right here
[1:00:24] this isn't reality the thoughts of god
[1:00:26] are reality
[1:00:28] it wasn't well that was just in the
[1:00:29] thoughts of god well praise god i was
[1:00:31] there with fellowship with him and the
[1:00:33] thoughts of god
[1:00:33] that's more solid than this is right
[1:00:36] here now
[1:00:36] that's more of a confirmation that's
[1:00:38] more powerful than this right here
[1:00:42] praise be to god i'm so thankful that
[1:00:45] was just in the thoughts of god
[1:00:46] because that can't break that can't bend
[1:00:49] that can't melt away
[1:00:50] that can't be changed that can't
[1:00:52] deteriorate with time that can't change
[1:00:54] its form
[1:00:56] that's the thoughts of god they're
[1:00:58] eternal and they are real
[1:00:59] that means if i was there i was real
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:03] this isn't real that's real and that's
[1:01:06] really me
[1:01:07] [Applause]
[1:01:09] praise be to god you're more solid than
[1:01:12] you ever thought
[1:01:12] you're more secure than you ever dreamed
[1:01:14] of your position is not moving
[1:01:17] unflinching unwavering you were already
[1:01:19] there
[1:01:20] real eternal nothing's going to change
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] you were there not as a flesh man you
[1:01:26] were there as an attribute of god
[1:01:28] a son or daughter of god to be expressed
[1:01:31] to be made manifest down here but you're
[1:01:33] already there
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:37] you're so solidly placed that nothing
[1:01:40] will move you
[1:01:45] it says we are taught i'm going to read
[1:01:47] this again we are taught in the blessed
[1:01:48] word
[1:01:49] that we had fellowship with him before
[1:01:50] the foundation of the world
[1:01:52] when the morning stars sang together and
[1:01:54] the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:01:55] way back before the foundation of the
[1:01:57] world how do we know that wasn't at the
[1:02:00] same time that the lamb was slain
[1:02:05] well the lamb wasn't really slain he was
[1:02:07] slain in the mind of god
[1:02:11] if he was slain in the mind of god he
[1:02:12] was really slain
[1:02:16] then the negative had to show the
[1:02:18] positive
[1:02:19] we put too much stock on the negative
[1:02:22] and we don't realize the negative is
[1:02:23] reflecting the positive
[1:02:25] if he was slain before the foundation of
[1:02:26] the world he was
[1:02:28] really slain
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:31] and then in time amen then in time what
[1:02:34] had happened had to be reflected in time
[1:02:37] and a time element in the ages and in
[1:02:40] time
[1:02:40] was a negative reflection of the
[1:02:42] positive that it was taken off of
[1:02:46] we've got it completely backwards in our
[1:02:48] carnal thinking
[1:02:49] and denominational instruction has
[1:02:51] reversed the whole thing
[1:02:54] well that was just in his thoughts
[1:02:57] please don't say that anymore
[1:02:59] don't say it that way please don't like
[1:03:02] well that was just in his thoughts
[1:03:04] if it was in his thoughts i would rather
[1:03:06] say well that was just manifest in time
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:13] that well that just happened here in
[1:03:15] time
[1:03:19] if it was in those thoughts it's real
[1:03:22] it's the real real
[1:03:24] this is not the real real that's the
[1:03:26] real real
[1:03:30] praise be to god that's why brother ben
[1:03:32] said you've never seen me
[1:03:35] you've never really seen me you've never
[1:03:38] really seen me
[1:03:39] well i take that back if you're an
[1:03:42] expressed attribute of god you did see
[1:03:44] me and i seen you and we had fellowship
[1:03:46] together with him before
[1:03:48] but we've come in spiritual amnesia into
[1:03:50] another form into this body
[1:03:51] to reflect and express that so you've
[1:03:53] seen me before
[1:03:54] amen but you not with your mental
[1:03:56] understanding and your human eyes has
[1:03:58] ever really seen me
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:01] but that attribute of god down inside
[1:04:02] you saw me and i saw you
[1:04:05] and we sang together
[1:04:09] you think what we're singing here is so
[1:04:11] special what do you think it was like
[1:04:12] then
[1:04:13] all we're doing is reflecting back to
[1:04:15] then you're rejoicing now over the plan
[1:04:17] of god
[1:04:18] it was because you rejoiced before over
[1:04:20] the plan of god this is just a negative
[1:04:22] reflecting the positive
[1:04:23] amen that was real worship that was real
[1:04:26] revelation
[1:04:26] we saw the plan of god and we rejoiced
[1:04:29] and we sang
[1:04:32] all of the singing at the end of service
[1:04:34] all the rejoicing during the preaching
[1:04:36] of the word
[1:04:36] is a reflection hey what's already taken
[1:04:39] place
[1:04:43] hallelujah
[1:04:46] how do we know that that wasn't at the
[1:04:48] same time the lamb was slain
[1:04:53] i'm so glad god sent a prophet friends
[1:04:55] to absolutely
[1:04:56] tear down carnal human thinking and try
[1:05:00] to lift us
[1:05:00] out of this condition of a hybrid mind
[1:05:03] and back into the real realities of god
[1:05:07] how do we know that wasn't the same time
[1:05:08] that the lamb was slain that when god
[1:05:10] and his great thinking
[1:05:11] seen us shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:05:14] salvation
[1:05:15] through jesus
[1:05:19] further in the serpent seed he says i
[1:05:21] want to ask you
[1:05:22] who is this job 38 when he said
[1:05:26] where was you when i laid the foundation
[1:05:27] of earth when the morning stars sang
[1:05:28] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:05:30] joy
[1:05:32] who were those sons of god that shouted
[1:05:34] for joy jesus told them that
[1:05:36] jesus told them that
[1:05:40] i had joy with you before the foundation
[1:05:42] of the world
[1:05:44] jesus talking to his disciples but them
[1:05:47] said
[1:05:47] i enjoyed you before the foundation of
[1:05:49] the world
[1:05:53] we're not creatures of time we're
[1:05:55] creatures of eternity
[1:05:57] no man can come to me except my father
[1:05:59] draws him and all that comes to me i'll
[1:06:01] give them eternal life
[1:06:02] and raise them up at the last days no
[1:06:04] one can pluck them from my father's hand
[1:06:06] he gives them to me how are you going to
[1:06:10] lose
[1:06:12] what a good question how are you going
[1:06:15] to the next person that comes to you
[1:06:16] ringing their hand
[1:06:17] oh i've got a prayer request say sister
[1:06:19] that's already a testimony
[1:06:22] brother that's already in the mind of
[1:06:23] god that prayer request is already a
[1:06:25] testimony
[1:06:26] stop wringing your hands and start
[1:06:28] looking around for the solution
[1:06:29] because there's a solution there's an
[1:06:31] overcoming amen don't be downtrodden
[1:06:33] don't be downcast
[1:06:34] get excited because if something bad's
[1:06:37] happening something good is on its way
[1:06:39] [Applause]
[1:06:42] praise be to god
[1:06:46] he said no man can come to me he said
[1:06:48] we're not creatures of time or creatures
[1:06:50] of eternity
[1:06:51] no man look at the scripture he goes to
[1:06:53] no man can come to me except my father
[1:06:55] draws him
[1:06:57] and all that comes to me i'll give them
[1:06:58] eternal life and raise them up at the
[1:07:00] last days no one can pluck them from my
[1:07:01] father's hand
[1:07:02] he give them to me how are you going to
[1:07:05] lose
[1:07:06] see you're scared you're afraid you'll
[1:07:09] run around here and that's one of the
[1:07:10] best
[1:07:11] evidences in the world that you haven't
[1:07:13] been nowhere yet
[1:07:16] what a rebuke remember
[1:07:20] fear anxiety that's all part of the
[1:07:21] human condition that's the human spirit
[1:07:23] and human mind
[1:07:24] don't get all upset if the first
[1:07:26] reaction you have is fear and anxiety
[1:07:28] but you take that fear and anxiety you
[1:07:29] bring it subject to the word of god
[1:07:32] and you say i'm not going to let fear
[1:07:34] i'm not going to let anxiety i'm not
[1:07:35] going to let worry
[1:07:36] amen trump the word of god and the
[1:07:38] revelation in my heart
[1:07:39] there is nothing going to defeat me
[1:07:41] there is no weapon to form that to
[1:07:42] destroy me
[1:07:43] satan's eden will never have victory
[1:07:45] over me none of his diseases none of
[1:07:47] his complexes will ever take a hold of
[1:07:50] me because god
[1:07:51] already saw me a finished work before
[1:07:52] the foundation of the world
[1:07:58] let's turn to ephesians chapter one
[1:08:17] ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 blessed
[1:08:20] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:08:22] christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:08:24] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:08:26] in christ

[1:08:29] to get blessed
[1:08:33] are you waiting to be glorified are you
[1:08:34] already glorified
[1:08:40] those who he predestinated
[1:08:43] four knew he predestined those who
[1:08:44] predestinate he called those equally
[1:08:46] justified those who be justified
[1:08:48] he hath glorified
[1:08:53] now you can say exactly like jesus
[1:08:55] christ said
[1:08:56] father glorify me with the glory i had
[1:09:00] with you
[1:09:02] before the foundation of the world well
[1:09:05] that was just in his thoughts
[1:09:07] amen that means i've already been
[1:09:10] glorified
[1:09:11] now we're just going through the action
[1:09:13] to display in this dimension what's
[1:09:14] already been done
[1:09:16] the negative is now reflecting the
[1:09:17] positive he hath
[1:09:19] already glorified me i can say like
[1:09:22] jesus christ said
[1:09:23] father glorify me with the glory i had
[1:09:26] where in your thinking
[1:09:28] amen his thoughts are real they're

[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:42] hallelujah all right
[1:09:45] let me get back to my text blessed be
[1:09:48] the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:09:49] christ who has blessed us with all
[1:09:51] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:09:52] in christ
[1:09:53] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:09:55] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:57] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:09:59] before him in love
[1:10:02] i hope someday i can be holy and without
[1:10:04] blame no he already chose you and him
[1:10:06] before
[1:10:06] so that you could be holy and without
[1:10:08] blame there is now therefore no
[1:10:10] condemnation
[1:10:12] brother bam said you're the sinless
[1:10:14] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:10:16] you never did it in the first place
[1:10:19] because you were there
[1:10:20] and that's real
[1:10:24] oh the devil's losing friends he's
[1:10:27] losing
[1:10:27] amen if we can stop thinking like humans
[1:10:30] and start thinking like sons and
[1:10:31] daughters of god
[1:10:32] the devil will lose if we can if this
[1:10:34] word will take us
[1:10:35] back to the mind we had the mind of
[1:10:37] christ the devil will lose
[1:10:45] where in the world am i praise god that
[1:10:48] we should be holy and without blame
[1:10:49] before him in love
[1:10:50] having predestinated us unto the
[1:10:52] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:10:54] himself
[1:10:54] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:10:56] will
[1:11:00] let's go to john 15 now
[1:11:05] the gospel of john
[1:11:12] 15.
[1:11:20] i hope all these scriptures start to
[1:11:21] take on more depth
[1:11:24] more color a deeper reality we've read
[1:11:27] through them
[1:11:27] we've read through them we've read
[1:11:29] through them but we can read through
[1:11:31] them with a carnal understanding
[1:11:33] but all of a sudden when the eyes begin
[1:11:34] to get focused amen
[1:11:36] all of a sudden when we read through
[1:11:37] them it's like i got it
[1:11:41] john 15 26
[1:11:46] john 15 and 26 but when the comforters
[1:11:49] come
[1:11:49] whom i will send unto you from the
[1:11:51] father even the spirit of truth which
[1:11:53] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:11:54] testify of me
[1:11:55] and he also shall bear witness because
[1:11:57] you have been with me from the
[1:12:01] beginning
[1:12:04] i wonder which beginning he's talking
[1:12:06] about it
[1:12:10] brother branham said in the message the
[1:12:13] serpent see
[1:12:14] he said he told his disciples i had joy
[1:12:16] with you before the foundation of the
[1:12:18] world
[1:12:21] you're my witnesses because you've been
[1:12:22] with me
[1:12:24] from the beginning
[1:12:27] brother says 1955 beginning and ending
[1:12:30] of the gentile dispensation
[1:12:32] see we come out of eternity we was
[1:12:34] before there was a world
[1:12:36] did you know that god made man in his
[1:12:38] own image
[1:12:39] where was you he said to job when job
[1:12:41] thought he had some wisdom
[1:12:42] where was you when i laid the foundation
[1:12:44] of the world before i laid it
[1:12:46] when the sons of god sang together in
[1:12:47] the morning started shout out for joy
[1:12:49] the morning stars shouted for joy them
[1:12:51] shining ones
[1:12:52] shouted for joy when they seemed that
[1:12:54] someday they would tabernacle here on
[1:12:56] earth
[1:13:01] did you rejoice that's why you're
[1:13:05] rejoicing
[1:13:06] because you've already rejoiced if you
[1:13:09] weren't rejoicing there then you won't
[1:13:10] be rejoicing here
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] them shining one shouted for joy when
[1:13:15] they seen that someday they would
[1:13:17] tabernacle here on earth
[1:13:18] and the king melchizedek would come in
[1:13:20] the righteousness of god and give his
[1:13:22] life to redeem us
[1:13:23] back to god back again and outshine the
[1:13:26] stars forever and ever
[1:13:28] 1964 spiritual amnesia
[1:13:32] he says now be a true christian you have
[1:13:34] to be
[1:13:35] to be a true christian you have to be
[1:13:37] the same we don't want to forget that
[1:13:39] all that he was i'm identified with him
[1:13:42] i'm identified with him notice and he is
[1:13:45] in me
[1:13:46] and i in him notice in every christian
[1:13:48] that's a real
[1:13:49] a real genuine christian
[1:13:52] who wants to identify with that every
[1:13:55] christian that's a real genuine
[1:13:56] christian
[1:13:57] was with him when the morning stars sang
[1:13:59] together and the sons of god shot up for
[1:14:01] joy
[1:14:02] before there was a foundation of the
[1:14:03] world we were identified
[1:14:05] in the immortal realms with god 10
[1:14:07] million years before the world was ever
[1:14:09] formed
[1:14:10] i was back there with him if i got
[1:14:12] eternal life i was there with him
[1:14:14] i was identified with him when the
[1:14:15] morning stars sang together and the sons
[1:14:17] of god shouted for joy
[1:14:20] if you're a genuine christian you was
[1:14:22] there
[1:14:23] and if you was there you're only here to
[1:14:25] reflect what was already over there
[1:14:30] let's go to john 17.
[1:14:36] let's read these scriptures with eyes
[1:14:38] that can see
[1:14:40] john 17 6 i have manifest thy name unto
[1:14:43] the men which
[1:14:44] thou gavest me out of the world thine
[1:14:47] they were
[1:14:51] thine they were
[1:14:54] and thou gave us to me and they have
[1:14:56] kept thy word
[1:14:59] when matthew was a tax collector
[1:15:02] when peter was a fisherman when andrew
[1:15:05] james and john were washing their nets
[1:15:11] what's he talking about he's not talking
[1:15:12] about when they were washing the nets
[1:15:15] he was theirs before they washed the
[1:15:16] nets he was there before they were born
[1:15:19] he was there before they were in the
[1:15:20] womb of their mother and they were his
[1:15:22] before
[1:15:23] said thine they were
[1:15:26] thine they were and thou gaveth to me
[1:15:29] and they have kept thy
[1:15:36] word
[1:15:38] john 6
[1:15:47] john chapter 6 and verse 63.
[1:16:00] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:16:02] flesh prophet of nothing
[1:16:04] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:16:06] spirit and they are life
[1:16:07] but there are some of you that believe
[1:16:09] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[1:16:11] who they were that believe not and who
[1:16:12] should betray him
[1:16:14] and he said therefore said i unto you
[1:16:16] that no man can come unto me
[1:16:17] except it were given unto him of the
[1:16:20] father
[1:16:21] why because it happened before
[1:16:25] it's not just happening it's already
[1:16:32] happened brother branham
[1:16:35] well let's let's look in revelation
[1:16:37] chapter 4.
[1:16:44] you know that john is caught up through
[1:16:46] the open door
[1:16:47] after chapter three he's caught up
[1:16:50] through the open door
[1:16:52] brother ben said he's in the vision and
[1:16:54] he's caught through the open door
[1:16:56] let's let's read from verse one
[1:17:00] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:17:02] was open in heaven and the first voice
[1:17:04] which i heard was as it were of a
[1:17:05] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:17:07] up hither
[1:17:08] and i will show thee things which must
[1:17:10] be hereafter
[1:17:11] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[1:17:13] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:17:14] one side on the throne
[1:17:16] and he that was to look upon like a
[1:17:18] jasper and sardine stone and there was
[1:17:20] a rainbow round about the throne in
[1:17:21] sight like into a nim room
[1:17:23] and around about the throne were four
[1:17:25] and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw
[1:17:27] four and 20 elders sitting
[1:17:28] clothed in white raiment and they had on
[1:17:30] their heads crowns of gold
[1:17:32] and out of the throne proceeded
[1:17:34] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:17:36] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:17:37] burning before the throne which are the
[1:17:39] seven spirits of god
[1:17:41] and before the throne there was a sea of
[1:17:43] glass like under crystal and in the
[1:17:44] midst of the throne and around about the
[1:17:46] throne
[1:17:46] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:17:48] behind
[1:17:50] and and the first beast which i saw
[1:17:53] i'm going to stop right there
[1:17:56] i want to go back to verse 4 now
[1:17:59] so he sees he's caught up in the vision
[1:18:01] he's caught through the open door
[1:18:02] he sees heaven open and he sees a scene
[1:18:05] that is set
[1:18:06] but when he looks at the scene in verse
[1:18:07] 4 he says around about the throne were
[1:18:09] four
[1:18:10] and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw
[1:18:12] four and 20 elders
[1:18:15] you see that so he sees 24 seats
[1:18:20] and on the seats are 24 elders
[1:18:23] are there 23 24.
[1:18:27] who are the 24 elders the 12 patriarchs
[1:18:31] and the 12 apostles
[1:18:36] let me ask you a question who's john
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:42] who's john and where's john
[1:18:48] john is one of the twelve apostles if
[1:18:52] john is one of the twelve apostles
[1:18:53] where is he sitting in one of the 24
[1:18:57] seats
[1:18:58] he doesn't see 23 seats he sees
[1:19:02] 24 seats so when john's standing there
[1:19:06] looking at the 24 seats and the 24
[1:19:07] elders
[1:19:08] one of those elders is john
[1:19:12] himself why because it's eternal in the
[1:19:15] thoughts of god
[1:19:16] it's already happened he's already there
[1:19:20] john was living on life on earth john
[1:19:23] was an old man on the isle of patents
[1:19:25] but john was already there overcoming
[1:19:28] sitting in one of the 24 seats as one of
[1:19:30] the 24 elders
[1:19:32] what do you think that did to john
[1:19:37] praise be to god let's go down to
[1:19:38] chapter 5.
[1:19:41] and i saw on the right hand of him you
[1:19:43] know what if i was
[1:19:44] john oh praise be to god if i was john
[1:19:47] and i saw that you're not going to get
[1:19:48] me to come back and grumble and complain
[1:19:51] amen if i already caught the vision if i
[1:19:53] was already seated there
[1:19:54] on one of those seats amen don't tell me
[1:19:56] it was in the mind of god amen if i was
[1:19:59] john i'd be rejoicing every day of my
[1:20:01] life
[1:20:01] because it was a finished work it was
[1:20:03] already done he was already sitting
[1:20:05] there
[1:20:07] god wasn't going to come along amen and
[1:20:09] john come back to earth and john make a
[1:20:11] mistake
[1:20:11] and god go back and rearrange the vision
[1:20:16] god was not going to come back and say i
[1:20:18] need a do-over john i didn't realize you
[1:20:20] would make that mistake so now i've got
[1:20:21] to pull you off of one of these 24 seats
[1:20:23] and put somebody else that i got to redo
[1:20:26] it
[1:20:26] [Applause]
[1:20:28] there's no redo in the mind of god
[1:20:30] there's no do-overs there's no
[1:20:32] i mean got to do it again there's no
[1:20:34] mistakes it was perfect
[1:20:36] already set in the mind of god and john
[1:20:38] saw it in the vision what you need to
[1:20:46] see is
[1:20:47] you need to see yourself seated in
[1:20:49] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:20:50] an heir a joint heir to the throne and
[1:20:53] if you can see yourself there
[1:20:55] oh what a rejoicing time amen that'll be
[1:21:00] revelation chapter 5
[1:21:04] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:21:05] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:21:07] and on the back side sealed with seven
[1:21:09] seals
[1:21:09] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[1:21:11] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:21:14] book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:21:16] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[1:21:18] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:21:20] the book neither to look thereon
[1:21:22] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:21:24] worthy to open
[1:21:25] to read the book neither to look thereon
[1:21:31] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:21:35] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:21:36] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[1:21:39] to open the book and to loose the seven
[1:21:41] seals thereof
[1:21:44] now when you go to chapter one this is
[1:21:46] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:21:48] gave to him which he sent and signified
[1:21:50] by an angel unto his servant john
[1:21:52] so everywhere along this book of
[1:21:54] revelation you have an
[1:21:56] angel talking to john angel talking to
[1:21:58] john
[1:21:59] angel talking to john but not when it
[1:22:01] comes to the opening of the seals
[1:22:03] when it comes to the opening of the
[1:22:05] seals and the revelation of redemption
[1:22:07] it says in one of the elders
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:12] one of the 24 elders
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:17] let's see issacra no
[1:22:21] god no judah
[1:22:25] peter matthew
[1:22:28] which elder was most interested in john
[1:22:30] getting this revelation
[1:22:33] which of the 24 elders was most
[1:22:35] interested in john
[1:22:38] this is just me i can't show you a quote
[1:22:41] but i got a feeling i know which elder
[1:22:43] was most interested in john
[1:22:45] amen i think it was john i think it was
[1:22:48] one of the 24 hours was interested in
[1:22:50] john
[1:22:51] rejoicing don't weep john for the lion
[1:22:53] of the tribe of judah
[1:22:55] has prevailed
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:58] look what brother branham says in the
[1:23:00] breach what a jubilee going on in heaven
[1:23:03] when the lamb leaves the intercessory
[1:23:05] box to come here to possess his claim
[1:23:07] you know that got next to john he must
[1:23:10] have saw his name
[1:23:11] wrote there when them seals broke he
[1:23:13] must have got real happy
[1:23:16] because the scripture says everything in
[1:23:18] heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:23:19] earth
[1:23:20] heard me rejoicing
[1:23:23] he must have got real happy listen what
[1:23:24] he said and every creature which is in
[1:23:26] heaven on earth and underneath the earth
[1:23:28] such as her in the sea and them as in
[1:23:31] heard me saying
[1:23:32] blessing honor glory power be to him
[1:23:34] that sits upon the throne unto the lamb
[1:23:36] forever
[1:23:36] amen and amen and amen the four beasts
[1:23:40] said amen and the four and twenty elders
[1:23:41] fell down and worshiped him
[1:23:42] that lives forever and ever talk about a
[1:23:45] jubilee
[1:23:46] talk about a time when the lamb walked
[1:23:48] forth see the books even sealed in
[1:23:50] heaven the mysteries are
[1:23:52] is my name there i don't know i hope it
[1:23:54] is but if it is i was put on the book
[1:23:56] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:58] but the first thing that represented
[1:24:00] that redemption come from the lamb
[1:24:02] that had been slain from the foundation
[1:24:03] of the world and he took the book
[1:24:05] glory opened the book and tore off the
[1:24:07] seals and sent it down to the earth
[1:24:09] to a seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:24:12] people
[1:24:13] there you are oh my what happened the
[1:24:16] screams the shouts the hallelujahs
[1:24:18] the anointed the power the glory the
[1:24:21] manifestations
[1:24:22] and old john who had been standing there
[1:24:24] our brother crying
[1:24:25] why he said everything in heaven
[1:24:27] everything in earth everything in the
[1:24:28] sea
[1:24:29] heard me holler amen blessings honor and
[1:24:32] might and power be him that lives
[1:24:34] forever and ever
[1:24:35] talk about a happy time when the seals
[1:24:37] broke john must have looked in and seen
[1:24:40] past the current of time and said
[1:24:42] there's john
[1:24:46] he must have looked in beyond the
[1:24:47] current of time and said there's john
[1:24:49] yes sir that's exactly what he saw
[1:24:53] he knew he was there he knew he was
[1:24:55] included he knew his name on that lamb's
[1:24:57] book of life he came to
[1:24:58] begin to rejoice because when he was sad
[1:25:01] and downtrodden
[1:25:02] and didn't know that the lamb had
[1:25:03] prevailed and was going to open the book
[1:25:05] and loose the seals amen there was an
[1:25:07] elder that came to him not the angel
[1:25:11] the elder came to him
[1:25:15] one of the 24 you pick which one you
[1:25:17] think it was
[1:25:19] he said don't weep john
[1:25:22] the lion of the tribe of judah there was
[1:25:25] an elder who was
[1:25:26] interested in john
[1:25:30] what a happy time when them seals broke
[1:25:32] john must have looked in and seen past
[1:25:33] the current of time and said
[1:25:35] there's john oh he was so happy he said
[1:25:37] everything in heaven
[1:25:38] he must have really cried out didn't he
[1:25:40] everything in heaven
[1:25:41] everything in earth everything beneath
[1:25:43] the earth every creature everything else
[1:25:45] heard me saying amen blessing and glory
[1:25:48] and wisdom and power and might and
[1:25:50] riches belong to him why
[1:25:55] because he saw redemption
[1:25:58] why did brother branham say the sons of
[1:26:00] god were singing for joy
[1:26:02] because so they saw the plan of
[1:26:03] redemption
[1:26:05] now when you come to revelation chapter
[1:26:07] 5 john is a type of who
[1:26:09] the bride and john is the type of the
[1:26:12] bride has an elder amen that he already
[1:26:14] seen sitting on the throne
[1:26:16] amen he has an elder come to him and
[1:26:17] tell him weep not
[1:26:19] amen and then he begins rejoicing amen
[1:26:21] when he sees that the lamb can take the
[1:26:23] book
[1:26:27] that's why brother brenham says and who
[1:26:28] is this melchizedek paragraph 88
[1:26:32] then after you recognize the very word
[1:26:33] of god was eagle food
[1:26:36] then you left the other thing you have
[1:26:38] then been formed into the living image
[1:26:39] of the living god
[1:26:41] you heard from your
[1:26:45] you heard from your theophany
[1:26:48] if this earthly body be dissolved we
[1:26:50] have one
[1:26:52] waiting eternal in the heavens
[1:26:55] when you recognize this message with
[1:26:57] eagle's food and you left the others
[1:26:59] what was he talking about just before
[1:27:00] this the story of the little eagle being
[1:27:02] brought down as an egg and hashed out in
[1:27:04] the chicken yard
[1:27:05] and then the denominational chicken yard
[1:27:06] and not knowing what it was
[1:27:08] but an eagle came over crying to an
[1:27:12] eagle below and the chinese ticket was
[1:27:15] coming together
[1:27:16] and when the chinese ticket come
[1:27:18] together you heard from your theophany
[1:27:23] if this earthly body be dissolved we
[1:27:25] have one waiting
[1:27:28] praise be to god let's look at that in
[1:27:30] second corinthians chapter five
[1:27:32] we'll just wrap up here with this
[1:27:34] thought praise be to god
[1:27:37] i don't know about you but i know what
[1:27:39] they were rejoicing about now in chapter
[1:27:40] five
[1:27:41] i know why john got so excited it's the
[1:27:43] reason i'm so excited amen because
[1:27:46] i recognized this eagle scream there was
[1:27:48] an eagle screamed to an eagle
[1:27:50] and then there was word that connected
[1:27:51] with words in my life
[1:27:53] i already saw this happen
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:27:58] i was down here i didn't understand i
[1:28:00] didn't know why
[1:28:01] nothing ever fit i tried i went to
[1:28:03] church i loved the lord i prayed but
[1:28:05] there was no overcoming power
[1:28:07] there was no real life of christ
[1:28:08] everything was a misfit but i
[1:28:10] when i heard the eagle scream one day
[1:28:14] and i recognize how did i recognize not
[1:28:16] by my mental capability
[1:28:18] but there was something down inside was
[1:28:20] the same thing that this was
[1:28:22] the word predestinated to the word
[1:28:24] written for that hour
[1:28:27] and when i got to that point all of a
[1:28:29] sudden there was a connection
[1:28:31] because i heard
[1:28:34] not from the angel
[1:28:37] john didn't hear from the angel that the
[1:28:40] lamb had taken the book
[1:28:41] he heard from one of the elders that the
[1:28:42] angel took in the book and when you
[1:28:44] recognize this eagle scream and you left
[1:28:46] the others you were formed into the
[1:28:48] living image of the living god
[1:28:49] you heard from your theology
[1:28:56] and you can say that's just in the mind
[1:28:57] of god you want but praise god i'll
[1:28:59] dance just the same
[1:29:01] i'll shout just as loud because it's
[1:29:04] real
[1:29:07] it wasn't my mind it wasn't my emotions
[1:29:09] it wasn't my mother
[1:29:10] it wasn't my father it wasn't a family
[1:29:12] tradition it was
[1:29:13] me the real me on the inside contacting
[1:29:16] the real matching part
[1:29:18] amen it can happen at an altar it can
[1:29:20] happen in your car
[1:29:21] it can happen at home it can happen
[1:29:22] during service it can happen in a prayer
[1:29:24] line
[1:29:25] it doesn't matter but there's got to be
[1:29:26] a connection from word to word
[1:29:29] eagle to eagle life to life holy spirit
[1:29:31] the holy spirit
[1:29:32] that life of god has got to come
[1:29:34] together again
[1:29:38] you can describe it any way you want
[1:29:40] with any emotions you want attached to
[1:29:42] it but that's what's got to happen
[1:29:46] and when that happened you heard from
[1:29:48] your theophany
[1:29:50] i didn't say it the prophet said
[1:29:54] second corinthians 5.
[1:29:58] i'm not even in second corinthians right
[1:30:00] now i don't even know where second
[1:30:01] corinthians is
[1:30:03] praise god i'm losing my carnal mind i
[1:30:06] can't read no more
[1:30:08] amen all i want is to know this
[1:30:12] this is everything to me i don't need to
[1:30:13] know any more math i don't need to know
[1:30:15] any more science
[1:30:16] i don't even know this is all that i
[1:30:17] need to know because this is the light
[1:30:19] that is taking this moisture
[1:30:21] back to the atmosphere where it came
[1:30:22] from it's moving me
[1:30:24] changing me the molecules are moving and
[1:30:27] one day
[1:30:27] it's going to go back to where it was
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:32] second corinthians i'm in first
[1:30:34] corinthians praise god
[1:30:36] second corinthians 5 and 1. for we know
[1:30:39] that if our earthly house of this
[1:30:40] tabernacle we're dissolved we have one
[1:30:42] we have a building of god a house not
[1:30:44] made with hands eternal
[1:30:47] in the heavens
[1:30:50] for in this we groan earnestly desire to
[1:30:52] be clothed upon
[1:30:53] with our house which is from heaven if
[1:30:55] so there be
[1:30:56] that being clothed we shall not be found
[1:30:59] naked your soul won't just go
[1:31:03] and be naked it's got to be housed and
[1:31:06] if it leaves this
[1:31:07] earthly tabernacle there's another one
[1:31:09] eternal
[1:31:10] in the heavens it's already there
[1:31:14] let's go to matthew 18.
[1:31:18] praise be to god i want to ask you a
[1:31:22] question did you hear the eagle scream
[1:31:26] did you recognize it was eagle's food
[1:31:30] did you leave the others were you formed
[1:31:32] into the living image of the living god
[1:31:35] then you have a theophany
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:40] then you have something eternal in the
[1:31:42] heavens a representation
[1:31:44] in heaven eternal in the heavens god's
[1:31:46] not going to change it out
[1:31:48] just like if john would have went back
[1:31:50] after the vision amen after he wrote the
[1:31:52] book of revelations
[1:31:53] and fell he was not going to pull john
[1:31:56] off of that seat and put somebody else
[1:31:57] in
[1:31:58] he's not going to take your eternal
[1:32:00] representation in heaven and crumple it
[1:32:02] up and toss it away and do another one
[1:32:04] if you heard the eagle scream and you
[1:32:06] left the others and recognized it as
[1:32:08] eagle food and you've been formed into
[1:32:10] the living image of the living god
[1:32:11] you heard from your theophany you're
[1:32:14] secure
[1:32:15] you're steady you're unmovable you're
[1:32:18] unshakeable
[1:32:18] you can no more be lost and god can be
[1:32:21] lost
[1:32:22] you're as eternal as god is eternal not
[1:32:25] this part but the real you the attribute
[1:32:28] of god on the inside
[1:32:29] amen has come from god is going to god
[1:32:32] it has a house
[1:32:33] already built to house it if you lose
[1:32:35] this house there's another one waiting
[1:32:37] because you've got representation
[1:32:38] already in heaven
[1:32:40] that woman at the well when she come to
[1:32:42] jesus amen
[1:32:44] he says why could she believe it and the
[1:32:46] pharisees couldn't
[1:32:47] because she had representation in heaven
[1:32:49] and they didn't
[1:32:51] it wasn't ability it wasn't mine it
[1:32:54] wasn't good works
[1:32:55] it wasn't a good raising it had nothing
[1:32:57] to do with nothing on the earth
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:01] it had to do with what taken place in
[1:33:03] the mind of god before the foundation of
[1:33:05] the world
[1:33:05] amen she already had representation
[1:33:09] in heaven she already had a body
[1:33:12] eternal in the heavens
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:16] and when she come in contact with the
[1:33:19] living word
[1:33:24] the word predestinated
[1:33:27] met the word written for that hour
[1:33:30] and when it came together
[1:33:33] all her sins were forgiven
[1:33:38] and she and what did it do it redeemed
[1:33:41] her
[1:33:42] she was brought back what did it do to
[1:33:46] you
[1:33:47] the same exact thing
[1:33:53] people are trying to point people back
[1:33:55] to things that have happened ages ago
[1:33:59] to have their sins forgiven
[1:34:06] sure sins were forgiven
[1:34:09] when these two pieces came together
[1:34:14] what did it do when these two pieces
[1:34:16] came together
[1:34:17] it redeemed her what did it do for you
[1:34:22] the same
[1:34:25] let's go where did i say matthew 18. i
[1:34:28] just started turning then i get excited
[1:34:31] quit turning praise be to god
[1:34:36] matthew 18 and 10
[1:34:41] take heed that you despise not one of
[1:34:42] these little ones for i say unto you
[1:34:44] that in heaven their angels do
[1:34:46] always behold the face of my father
[1:34:49] which is in heaven
[1:34:51] let's read again take heed that you
[1:34:53] despise not one of these little ones for
[1:34:54] i say unto you
[1:34:56] that in heaven their angels do always
[1:34:58] behold the face of my father
[1:35:00] which is in heaven nineteen sixty one
[1:35:03] questions and then
[1:35:05] answers now he said take heed that you
[1:35:08] don't despise
[1:35:09] if you'd really take interpretation the
[1:35:11] word is mistreat to mistreat one of
[1:35:13] those
[1:35:14] mistreat a child you should never do
[1:35:15] that their children they don't know
[1:35:18] and notice because their angels always
[1:35:19] behold my father's face which is in
[1:35:21] heaven see other words their angels
[1:35:23] their messengers their bodies angelic
[1:35:25] bodies that they go to if they die
[1:35:27] are always before my father's face in
[1:35:30] heaven
[1:35:32] brother man calls these in another place
[1:35:33] theophanies
[1:35:35] angel bodies that they go to if this
[1:35:37] one's dissolved and he says
[1:35:39] only the redeemed have angels
[1:35:42] not everybody only the redeemed have
[1:35:45] these angels and he calls them
[1:35:46] theophanies
[1:35:49] he says now i'll read it again they're
[1:35:52] angels they're messengers
[1:35:54] they're messengers
[1:35:58] their angels are their messengers
[1:36:03] that means you can get a message from
[1:36:06] one of these angels
[1:36:09] i don't know maybe if you heard the
[1:36:11] eagle screamed and recognized
[1:36:14] and left the others recognized as eagle
[1:36:16] food
[1:36:17] maybe you heard from your messenger
[1:36:22] their messengers their bodies angelic
[1:36:24] bodies that they go to if they die
[1:36:26] are always before my father's face in
[1:36:28] heaven see now if this earthly
[1:36:30] tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:36:31] already waiting
[1:36:32] is that right that's a body
[1:36:41] brother brahm says in the message
[1:36:43] jehovah jireh 1964
[1:36:46] then there's only 12 was left he said
[1:36:49] unless you
[1:36:50] drink my eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:36:53] all these other things they started
[1:36:54] leaving
[1:36:55] only 12 was left and he turned around
[1:36:57] and looked at them and said i've chosen
[1:36:58] 12 of you
[1:36:59] and one of you is a devil he said do you
[1:37:01] want to go too
[1:37:02] then peter said these great words to
[1:37:04] whom shall we go lord for we are sure
[1:37:06] that thou has the word of life they had
[1:37:09] seen it so clearly vindicated no matter
[1:37:11] what the priest said what anybody else
[1:37:12] said
[1:37:13] they knew right there that that he had
[1:37:16] the word of life
[1:37:18] you have the word of life and now we
[1:37:21] notice no matter what the others done
[1:37:23] how they walked away those disciples
[1:37:25] were predestinated
[1:37:27] they were ordained to eternal life no
[1:37:29] they couldn't explain it they couldn't
[1:37:31] explain it no more than the rest of them
[1:37:32] could
[1:37:33] but there was something in them that
[1:37:35] representation in heaven
[1:37:38] a thought that god had of them before
[1:37:40] the foundation of the world had
[1:37:41] manifested itself here
[1:37:43] and they were connected with god and was
[1:37:44] sure that was god's promise vindicated
[1:37:47] and nothing is going to change it from
[1:37:49] them that's real
[1:37:51] genuine christianity that's the real
[1:37:54] genuine article
[1:37:55] a connection to god that goes back to
[1:37:58] the mind of god
[1:38:00] their representation in heaven the woman
[1:38:02] at the well had representation in heaven
[1:38:04] the priest had no representation in
[1:38:06] heaven
[1:38:10] if you heard the message if you heard
[1:38:13] the eagle scream and recognize it was
[1:38:14] eagle food and left the others
[1:38:17] you hurt from your
[1:38:21] that must mean you have some
[1:38:22] representation somewhere
[1:38:25] it's eternal in the heavens
[1:38:30] man said in the message it is the rising
[1:38:31] of the sun
[1:38:34] and one day when i was weary myself
[1:38:37] if you boy you'd better go ahead you're
[1:38:38] 50 years old if you're going to do
[1:38:40] anything for that the lord you better
[1:38:42] hurry up and do it you're getting old
[1:38:43] see
[1:38:44] and there that morning that quickening
[1:38:45] power come and he let me look over the
[1:38:48] curtain of time
[1:38:49] and i seen all of you over there
[1:38:56] what did he say
[1:38:59] he's looking at living people they were
[1:39:02] very much alive they weren't dead yet
[1:39:06] he said i i looked beyond the curtain of
[1:39:08] time the quickening power come on me i
[1:39:09] look beyond the curtain of time
[1:39:11] and i've seen all of you over there
[1:39:15] question is did he see you over there
[1:39:19] i've got a substance in my heart i've
[1:39:22] got an
[1:39:22] evidence inside of me that says i was
[1:39:25] there
[1:39:26] he saw me there i mean i don't know the
[1:39:29] mechanics of it
[1:39:30] i don't know how it works i can't
[1:39:32] explain to you this that or the other
[1:39:33] mechanical i don't know the mechanics of
[1:39:35] it i don't understand the mechanics
[1:39:37] i don't know how it works but there's a
[1:39:38] substance in me says i was there too
[1:39:41] the reason i shout nor i shout and
[1:39:43] rejoice and sing
[1:39:45] in revelations chapter 5 is because when
[1:39:47] i saw revelation chapter 5 before the
[1:39:49] foundation of the world
[1:39:50] i was one of those morning stars i was
[1:39:52] one of those sons
[1:39:53] of god that shouted for joy and saying
[1:39:56] that's why now
[1:39:57] when i see the book taken in the hands
[1:39:59] of the of the
[1:40:00] the king and i see him tear the seals
[1:40:03] open
[1:40:04] amen i rejoice just the same because
[1:40:06] i've already rejoiced over my redemption
[1:40:09] and now i'm rejoicing again when i begin
[1:40:12] to sing the songs of glory
[1:40:14] remember brother yatzik said there was a
[1:40:16] mystery in the song of solomon
[1:40:18] there was six songs where's the seventh
[1:40:20] song the mystery song the complete song
[1:40:22] it's over in revelation chapter five
[1:40:25] when they begin to sing thou hast
[1:40:26] redeemed us
[1:40:27] from every nation and peoples and
[1:40:29] tongues amen thou has redeemed us
[1:40:31] who's singing that song i'm telling you
[1:40:34] right now
[1:40:34] if you're singing that song of the
[1:40:36] redeemed it's because you
[1:40:38] sang it before in the mind of god before
[1:40:40] the foundation of the world
[1:40:41] because only the elect are catching
[1:40:43] what's happening in this day
[1:40:45] only the elector catching the fullness
[1:40:47] of redemption that is coming this day
[1:40:49] only the elect are recognizing chapter
[1:40:51] five has already happened
[1:40:54] and they're singing the song because the
[1:40:56] lamb's taking the book
[1:40:57] and loose the seals thereof because they
[1:41:00] sang it before
[1:41:02] are you singing in now are you singing a
[1:41:04] new song amen it says in revelation 5
[1:41:06] they sang a new song
[1:41:08] not the same song they sang to the
[1:41:09] denominational ages
[1:41:11] but now we've come to the end of that
[1:41:13] and they sing a new song
[1:41:14] of the lamb taking the book
[1:41:20] and i'm singing and shouting and oh i
[1:41:22] just wish that i had the same freedom i
[1:41:24] had back then
[1:41:25] because who knows what it looked like
[1:41:26] then but i'm telling you something
[1:41:28] inside of me is changing
[1:41:30] it's going to start looking a whole lot
[1:41:31] like it looked before because we're
[1:41:33] coming
[1:41:34] right back into that same image
[1:41:37] that's why you wave your hand that's why
[1:41:38] you shout that's why you say amen
[1:41:40] that's why you sing that's why you
[1:41:42] praise the lord that's why you wave your
[1:41:44] hand
[1:41:45] because you were there before and it's
[1:41:48] just awakening something inside that has
[1:41:50] already seen this act today
[1:41:53] praise be to god friends this isn't our
[1:41:55] first time around
[1:41:59] but maybe that was just in the thoughts
[1:42:00] of god
[1:42:05] it's the thoughts of god that are
[1:42:06] ensuring you get it right now
[1:42:10] it is what took place before the
[1:42:11] foundation world is making sure it's
[1:42:13] acting out right
[1:42:14] now it's not him that will us
[1:42:17] him that around us by the will of god
[1:42:21] and by the spirit of god
[1:42:24] see he made sure it's going to happen
[1:42:27] and he made sure you're going to be
[1:42:28] there
[1:42:29] because you were already there
[1:42:33] i sang i shouted
[1:42:38] oh but chad explain the mechanics i
[1:42:40] can't explain the mechanics
[1:42:42] i don't care about the mechanics i got
[1:42:44] the dynamics the mechanics will take
[1:42:46] care of itself
[1:42:47] i don't have to worry about that but i
[1:42:50] know it's true and i know it's real and
[1:42:51] i know it's genuine
[1:42:56] something come to me
[1:43:00] a messenger come to me
[1:43:04] i said it's all right the lamb's taking
[1:43:07] the book
[1:43:10] oh what's singing what's shouting what
[1:43:13] rejoicing
[1:43:15] because of redemption praise god let's
[1:43:18] all stand
[1:43:19] may god be with you friends musicians if
[1:43:21] you could come
[1:43:23] to the gym
[1:43:27] can you say from the bottom of your
[1:43:30] heart
[1:43:31] that inside of you this has happened
[1:43:37] if you don't know this if you don't know
[1:43:39] what this is like
[1:43:41] i wouldn't spend any time doing anything
[1:43:43] else
[1:43:46] i wouldn't waste my time on any other
[1:43:48] endeavor on any other project on
[1:43:50] anything else
[1:43:51] so many times we try to live a christian
[1:43:53] life
[1:43:54] cut this out and cut down out and cut
[1:43:56] and we preach cut this out because
[1:43:58] that's the gospel
[1:43:59] it has to be preached because the
[1:44:01] children of god have to wake up to the
[1:44:02] age of living
[1:44:03] and move away from deception it's got to
[1:44:05] be preached brother brennan preached
[1:44:07] he preached on clothes and hair and
[1:44:08] makeup and all of those things
[1:44:10] and tv and entertainment and worldliness
[1:44:13] he preached and all that we'll preach on
[1:44:14] all of that
[1:44:17] but you can be trying
[1:44:22] but if you really want to overcome
[1:44:25] let this down here and this up here
[1:44:30] come together and when it does
[1:44:34] all your sins will be forgiven and it'll
[1:44:36] redeem you
[1:44:38] and the revelation of who you are will
[1:44:40] change your conduct
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:44] we'll always preach holiness we'll
[1:44:46] always preach the right
[1:44:47] and will always say what's the wrong but
[1:44:50] if you're not sure that this has
[1:44:51] happened
[1:44:54] don't invest any more time in trying to
[1:44:55] be good
[1:44:58] don't invest any more time and trying to
[1:44:59] find another church that'll do it for
[1:45:01] you
[1:45:02] another church will do it for you if
[1:45:03] you're not sure that this has happened
[1:45:05] i would lay before the lord and say god
[1:45:08] i need
[1:45:08] something from you to where i've got an
[1:45:11] evidence in my heart
[1:45:12] amen i've got i mean i've got a
[1:45:14] substance amen i've got an evidence by
[1:45:16] faith that tells me
[1:45:17] i have connected to the unseen i have
[1:45:20] connected to something
[1:45:22] that that i was before the foundation of
[1:45:24] the world
[1:45:25] something real something genuine has
[1:45:27] come together in my life
[1:45:28] and i know it and i'm rejoicing over it
[1:45:33] sometimes you see people they act a
[1:45:35] little bit
[1:45:36] perturbed that they have to believe the
[1:45:39] message
[1:45:41] because of all the requirements for
[1:45:43] living a clean life and a moral life and
[1:45:45] cleaning the face and not cutting the
[1:45:47] hair getting rid of whirling
[1:45:49] and it's a little bit irritating
[1:45:50] sometimes because we want to keep a hold
[1:45:52] of a few things
[1:45:54] why couldn't that just be you know just
[1:45:55] a little bit easier
[1:45:58] the problem is you just don't know who
[1:46:00] you are yet
[1:46:03] because when you catch a revelation of
[1:46:04] who you are that thing on tv don't
[1:46:07] matter
[1:46:09] i mean it has no pain that makeup has no
[1:46:13] attraction
[1:46:14] a hairdresser those friends all of a
[1:46:17] sudden when you catch a revelation when
[1:46:18] there's a real awakening of the real you
[1:46:20] on the inside
[1:46:21] those things just lose their attraction
[1:46:23] they're just not attractive anymore
[1:46:26] there's not another church that'll fix
[1:46:28] that there's not a different style of
[1:46:30] preaching that'll fix that
[1:46:31] the only thing that'll fix that is when
[1:46:33] those two pieces come together
[1:46:36] and there's a real genuine new birth
[1:46:38] experience
[1:46:39] that brings a revelation of who you are
[1:46:41] where you came from
[1:46:43] what you're doing and where you're going
[1:46:46] then everything else is pure joy
[1:46:49] serving him is pure pleasure
[1:46:53] amen let's sing that song joy
[1:46:56] unspeakable
[1:46:57] and full of glory i have found his grace
[1:46:59] is all complete let's start with that
[1:47:02] i have found his grace
[1:47:17] i am
[1:47:34] is
[1:47:49] me
[1:48:16] oh
[1:48:30] oh is
[1:49:39] amen i believe how many believe that
[1:49:41] half has never yet been told
[1:49:43] why because there's something in me
[1:49:44] that's saying there's more there's more
[1:49:46] how do you know there's more because i
[1:49:48] was there when more was given out
[1:49:51] oh and something in me wants it all
[1:49:54] i want more and more and more of this
[1:49:56] great revelation
[1:49:58] more of the unveiling of god
[1:50:01] do you realize when brother bennett
[1:50:03] preached the unveiling of god or the
[1:50:04] mighty god unveiled or masterpiece or
[1:50:06] all of these
[1:50:07] you know what else he's unveiling you
[1:50:13] he's not just unveiling a mystical being
[1:50:15] somewhere
[1:50:16] far away he's unveiling god in
[1:50:19] all of his attributes which includes you
[1:50:24] when he becomes unveiled you become
[1:50:26] unbalanced
[1:50:28] when the book was loosed you were loosed
[1:50:30] because what is the believer
[1:50:31] the words in the book when the seals
[1:50:34] were open
[1:50:35] you were open when the seals were loose
[1:50:37] you were loosed
[1:50:38] no longer bound we're free people
[1:50:43] just catch that revelation you're free
[1:50:44] whatever's binding you now you're free
[1:50:46] from it
[1:50:48] doesn't matter what it is you're free
[1:50:49] because god didn't see you bound before
[1:50:52] the foundation of the world he saw you
[1:50:53] free
[1:50:54] he saw you redeem he saw you rejoicing
[1:50:56] amen so that's what you really are
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:01] everything that's happening now is just
[1:51:02] expressing god and moving us back to
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:05] praise be to god they're stepping stones
[1:51:07] friend they're expressions of god
[1:51:09] amen they're testimonies of the word
[1:51:12] amen so be it
[1:51:13] let him be expressed in me let's bow our
[1:51:16] heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank
[1:51:18] you father
[1:51:20] god how happy we are to know your
