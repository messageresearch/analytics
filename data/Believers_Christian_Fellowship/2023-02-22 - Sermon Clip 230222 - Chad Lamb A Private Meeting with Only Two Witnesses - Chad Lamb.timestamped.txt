[0:00] the false church and the true church
[0:02] have both been pregnant they've both
[0:04] received seed and they've both been
[0:05] impregnated by two different sources
[0:08] one from Christ and one from Antichrist
[0:12] amen and how in the world are we going
[0:15] to know amen which one is the and
[0:19] which one is the Virgin everybody says
[0:21] I'm virgin amen I mean the Catholic
[0:23] Church says they're virgin amen the
[0:25] Protestant churches say they're virgin
[0:26] we say we're a virgin amen the only way
[0:29] we can do it is show the tokens that we
[0:31] have received and what have we received
[0:33] we received the true revelation of the
[0:35] word
[0:36] we receive the very spirit of God we
[0:39] have his life and we have his word with
[0:42] the correct interpretation of the word
[0:44] and when it comes time to present and we
[0:46] could say we could say it this way amen
[0:48] the one that I'm pregnant by amen gave
[0:51] me this word this is his word this
[0:54] Revelation this word this opening of the
[0:56] seals this revelation of the seven
[0:58] Thunders this this interpretation of
[1:01] serpency this interpretation of water
[1:03] baptism this interpretation of godhead I
[1:06] got this from the one who pregnated me
[1:10] and this life that's in me that's not my
[1:13] life but his life in me I got that from
[1:15] him too when I received this word
[1:18] that's the man who pregnated me
[1:21] and then the false Vine amen when they
[1:24] go to show their staff their bracelet
[1:27] whatever they show however it works amen
[1:30] I'm just showing it as a Time amen when
[1:32] they go to show they say Amen this is my
[1:34] interpretation of the scripture the one
[1:36] impregnated me show me baptism and
[1:38] titles amen show me a piece of fruit in
[1:41] the Garden of Eden amen show me that the
[1:43] the the seals are not open they'll be
[1:45] open later amen that's who impregnated
[1:47] me and by the tokens proves where the
[1:51] seed came from and it testifies that
[1:54] this bride is not a harlot she's not
[1:56] been in Harlot she's been keeping the
[1:58] pure word she's kept herself virgin to
[2:01] one man and that one man is Jesus Christ
[2:06] you realize you have a token to present
[2:08] concerning the life inside of you
[2:11] it's the evidence of the man who
[2:14] impregnated you
