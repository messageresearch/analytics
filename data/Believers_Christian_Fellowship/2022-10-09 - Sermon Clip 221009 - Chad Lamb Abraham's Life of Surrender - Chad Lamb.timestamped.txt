[0:00] nobody wants difficult situations nobody
[0:03] wants fusses and fights nobody wants a
[0:06] hard situations the Apostle Paul did not
[0:09] want a thorn in his flesh
[0:11] that was not his choice that was the
[0:13] choice of God who knew what Paul needed
[0:15] so that he wouldn't become puffed up so
[0:16] they can in humility and Minister the
[0:18] word and God Did It for Paul and God Did
[0:21] It for the people that would hear Paul
[0:22] Paul didn't want it amen but once he
[0:25] realized it was the will of God he
[0:27] surrendered himself to it it was not
[0:29] angry about it was not bitter over it
[0:31] did not get hurt till God tow towards
[0:33] God Amen all of a sudden he began to
[0:35] glory in his he said now therefore glory
[0:38] in my infirmities for when I am weak
[0:40] then am I made strong
[0:43] ball began to learn to to yield and even
[0:46] brother Branham he had a problem with
[0:48] tension all of his life amen and there
[0:51] towards the latter part of his ministry
[0:52] he said you know this tension's bothered
[0:55] me all my life I get the blues I get the
[0:57] feeling like nobody loves me and I know
[0:59] that's not the truth that's just me
[1:00] doing that and he starts to describe the
[1:03] tension that he gets under and the
[1:04] anxiety and and the depression that he
[1:07] goes through and he starts to explain
[1:08] this amen and then he says but I got to
[1:11] thinking about this tension it's this
[1:13] tension that drove me to Christ
[1:16] he said what would I be without tension
[1:18] he said it's good for me
[1:22] instead of cursing the thing and getting
[1:25] upset about it and getting angry amen he
[1:28] began to realize that God was using this
[1:31] for me
[1:32] this is a blessing of God it drove me to
[1:35] Christ it keeps me dependent on Christ
[1:36] amen it keeps it keeps us in the right
[1:40] State of Mind many times and and I've
[1:42] seen so many times where people go
[1:44] through very difficult situations very
[1:47] difficult family situations difficult
[1:49] marriage situations a difficult work
[1:52] situation whatever kind of situation
[1:54] Church situations
[1:55] and you realize after talking to them
[1:57] for a little while they're hurt
[2:00] but they're hurt towards God
[2:04] because they said God could have
[2:05] prevented it God could have stopped it
[2:07] why could God allow it to happen why why
[2:10] am I going through this and why is this
[2:12] happening in my life and they're hurt
[2:14] over the situation but the more you talk
[2:16] to them to realize they're actually hurt
[2:18] at God Amen and there's a little bit of
[2:21] hurt they're harboring towards the
[2:23] almighty God because they know God could
[2:25] have stopped it God could prevent it and
[2:27] I don't understand why God allowed it
[2:29] and I just want to I want to live the
[2:30] life of Abraham and say God allowed it
[2:33] for my purpose there's some benefit in
[2:35] it somewhere I'm not going to be hurt at
[2:37] God I'm not going to be offended at God
[2:39] I won't be a hurt or offended towards my
[2:41] brother I'll just recognize that God is
[2:43] working something in my life and I
[2:46] needed another layer of separation
