[9:09] standing let's take our Bibles and let's
[9:12] go ahead and turn to Matthew 26
[9:14] and just want to say I appreciated that
[9:17] testimony Brother Kyle shared and it was
[9:20] such a blessing to see God touch
[9:22] people's lives when there's an Awakening
[9:24] that happens and it's like something
[9:26] fresh comes in my heart again and I
[9:28] remember when I heard the truth and what
[9:30] it did to me and it's just so exciting
[9:33] to see that God is still calling his
[9:35] elect and appreciate that and so we pray
[9:38] that the Lord will continue to use
[9:39] Brother Kyle as he goes down there next
[9:41] Sunday so pray for him as you know I'm
[9:44] going to be heading to Oregon I've got

[10:15] you could just be remembering those
[10:17] Brothers in prayer come expecting pull
[10:20] amen and see what God will do also uh
[10:23] when I get back we'll be just a couple
[10:25] days from going into the uh the look at
[10:28] the stars that we're going to do out of
[10:29] brother Elmer and sister Emily's and I'm
[10:31] so looking forward to that amen it'll be
[10:33] a good time where we just look at the
[10:36] the Bible in the Stars amen that God
[10:38] wrote and and it's just for fun this is
[10:40] not preaching we're not having a service
[10:42] a preaching service we're just going to
[10:44] go and enjoy ourselves and have
[10:45] fellowship and enjoy looking up a little
[10:48] bit
[10:49] amen amen so let's look at Matthew
[10:54] 26 and I'd like to read from verse
[10:57] 6 Matthew 26 and:
[11:01] 6 and when Jesus was in Bethany in the
[11:04] house of Simon the leper there came unto
[11:07] him a woman having an alabaster box of
[11:09] very precious ointment and poured it on
[11:11] his head as he sat at
[11:13] meat but when his disciples saw it they
[11:15] had indignation saying to what purpose
[11:17] is this waste for this ointment might
[11:20] have been sold for much and given to the
[11:22] poor when Jesus understood it he said
[11:24] unto them why trouble ye the woman for
[11:27] she hath wrought a good work upon me for
[11:29] you have the poor always with you but me
[11:32] you have not always for in that sheath
[11:35] poured this ointment on my body she did
[11:37] it from my burial verily I say unto you
[11:40] where wheresoever this gospel shall be
[11:41] preached in the whole world there shall
[11:44] also this that this woman hath done be
[11:46] told for a memorial of her those words
[11:49] still ring true because we're telling of
[11:51] it this morning as a memorial of what
[11:53] she did amen God bless you as you take
[11:55] your
[11:57] seats amen
[12:01] so the
[12:04] disciples uh were watching what this
[12:06] woman was doing and it seemed uh
[12:09] exorbitant it seemed like it was over
[12:12] the top too much it wasn't necessary and
[12:15] and uh and we know brother R speaks much
[12:17] of this and we're going to get into that
[12:18] in a few other scriptures as well but
[12:20] but when they looked at that they had
[12:22] indignation and we know the main culprit
[12:24] here is Judas we'll find that out later
[12:27] that Judas was not liking what he was
[12:29] sing because he had the idea that that
[12:31] this could be taken and sold and given
[12:33] to the poor and that seemed so righteous
[12:36] but we know down deep inside it wasn't
[12:38] righteousness that was moving him or
[12:40] motivating him to say that but uh and
[12:42] we'll get into that in a minute also but
[12:45] we see that what this woman was doing
[12:47] she was doing out of a pure heart she
[12:49] was doing by inspiration she was moved
[12:52] Amen to do something that was
[12:53] unreasonable she moved to do something
[12:56] that was not choreographed she was moved
[12:58] to do something that
[12:59] and and and like we were saying before
[13:01] she was doing something she didn't have
[13:03] to do there was no commandment nobody
[13:06] had come to her no no religious leader
[13:08] showed up to her and say hey you need to
[13:10] do this there was nothing she could uh
[13:12] find written in the Bible that says if
[13:14] you ever come and see the Messiah
[13:16] unwelcomed in a house you should go buy
[13:19] ointment you understand there was
[13:21] something that motivated her something
[13:23] that moved her something from within
[13:25] that was pulsating and she went and did
[13:27] something which to others looked
[13:28] ridiculous ulous amen even in her own
[13:31] mind she she may not have understood
[13:33] exactly what was going on she was just
[13:34] pushed from within amen and she was
[13:37] doing something she had to do there was
[13:38] something driving her and it was also
[13:40] something she wanted to do amen it
[13:43] wasn't something she had to do because
[13:45] it wasn't a commandment it wasn't
[13:47] something she had to do it wasn't like
[13:49] she was going to to fail the Commandment
[13:51] it wasn't she was going to be kicked out
[13:53] of church if she didn't do it it wasn't
[13:55] that kind of action it was an action
[13:57] that was motivated by the spirit of God
[13:59] it was another leading from within there
[14:01] was something motivating or pulsating in
[14:03] her and she didn't not cuz she had to
[14:05] but because she wanted
[14:07] to amen and so we want to look at that
[14:09] and we're very much uh I I want to uh uh
[14:12] Preach Today in the very much in the
[14:13] same lines that we've been ministering
[14:15] the the last few services and and I just
[14:18] pray that God will just take me and take
[14:19] me wherever he wants because uh as it
[14:22] usually goes you know you get so many
[14:24] things and so much inspiration and so
[14:26] many thoughts I have no idea how things
[14:29] are going to go I have no idea we can go
[14:31] two different directions well we're
[14:32] probably more than that in my mind I'm
[14:34] looking at two different directions but
[14:36] there's probably a multitude of
[14:37] directions we can go in but I don't care
[14:39] which direction we go as long as it's
[14:41] Direction he leads
[14:42] amen and so I'm just praying that God
[14:45] will have his way and I'm doing all I
[14:46] know to surrender to
[14:50] that and so brother bandham says in the
[14:53] unwelcomed Christ speaking of this same
[14:55] story says but I see her go up and she
[14:58] looks over over there and she sees him
[15:01] oh she said that can't be
[15:03] surely that must be him well it is him
[15:07] and he's not welcome he's got dirty feet
[15:10] and he's unano and nobody's paying
[15:11] attention to him she said surely
[15:14] somebody's got to do
[15:15] something and I see her pull her little
[15:18] shawl up around her and down the street
[15:20] she goes as hard as she can she goes up
[15:22] in the little old creaky steps in her
[15:24] little room and she goes into a little
[15:26] chest and gets out her little sock or
[15:28] something there with some money in it
[15:30] and she said no no I I can't do this I
[15:33] can't do it and she started weeping she
[15:35] rolled those eyes how he looked over at
[15:38] me and brother brandom starts
[15:39] dramatizing this story about the the the
[15:42] woman uh the Harlot woman The Prostitute
[15:45] and she saw Jesus in Simon's house
[15:48] unwelcome unano and me with unwashed
[15:51] feet and it did something to her and she
[15:54] she couldn't let it stay that way and
[15:56] and and it's amazing how right in the
[15:59] house was Jesus Jesus had come because
[16:02] he was invited but he was
[16:08] unwelcome it's
[16:10] amazing he came because he was invited
[16:14] but when he came he was
[16:15] unwelcome because those who invited him
[16:18] had ulterior motives they had other
[16:20] motives for inviting him so he was
[16:22] invited in but he was invited in for
[16:25] another
[16:26] motive and he was unwelcomed when he
[16:31] came brother BR taught us that Jesus
[16:33] keeps his appointments and he comes
[16:36] where he's
[16:38] invited and it's it's
[16:42] interesting that Jesus could be right in
[16:45] our
[16:47] midst he could come because he keeps his
[16:51] appointment he could come because he's
[16:53] invited he could be right here in in
[16:58] Simon could take some sort of Pride
[17:01] maybe in saying Jesus is in my
[17:04] home the prophet the one the campaigns
[17:06] are all about he's right
[17:08] here but in
[17:10] actuality it wasn't a blessing for Simon
[17:13] that Jesus was there it end up being a
[17:17] condemnation he could be proud about it
[17:19] but there was no reason to boast because
[17:21] Jesus was there yes Jesus was there
[17:23] Jesus came cuz you invited him there but
[17:25] just having Jesus in the house is no
[17:28] reason to boast it could be your
[17:30] condemnation because if he's invited and
[17:32] he comes but he's not
[17:37] welcome
[17:40] amen it's amazing we could take pride in
[17:43] Jesus was at my
[17:45] house but was he welcome was he kissed
[17:49] was he embraced was he anointed were his
[17:51] feet
[17:53] washed so the very presence of Jesus in
[17:56] my house and the way way I treat Jesus
[17:59] in my house may not be my blessing it
[18:03] may be my
[18:07] condemnation
[18:09] amen and so this is where she finds
[18:12] Jesus now and he's in this situation and
[18:14] there's something in her that she she
[18:17] she can't stand to see him unwelcomed
[18:20] she can't stand to see him unano she
[18:22] can't stand to see him unkissed and his
[18:24] feet unwashed and there's something in
[18:26] her if if nobody else will do it I've
[18:29] got to do it but she's having so many
[18:31] second doubts second thoughts and doubts
[18:33] about herself how can I can't I can't go
[18:35] into that place they know what kind of
[18:37] woman I am then she goes and runs
[18:38] upstairs and she goes to get her money
[18:40] but she saids no I I can't do that and
[18:44] then she
[18:45] says but oh how he looked over at
[18:50] me brother says nobody could ever look
[18:52] at Jesus and ever be the
[18:55] same she said that I must be beside
[18:58] myself look I know he's a prophet and he
[19:01] know where I got this
[19:02] money he know how I got it I can't take
[19:05] this to him I just can't do it she puts
[19:08] it back she's weeping said oh think of
[19:11] it nobody wants him I've got to do
[19:13] something about it and she takes her
[19:15] little sock out again her little uh
[19:17] chest and she looks at it and she said
[19:18] oh surely but it's all I got it's all I
[19:21] can do surely he will understand and I
[19:25] see her tuck that little money down in
[19:27] her bosom and throw her Shaw over over
[19:28] her and down the street she goes and she
[19:30] goes into a little jeice store down
[19:32] there where where they're selling some
[19:34] nerd and stuff in a perfume shop
[19:36] and she goes in and some old fell
[19:38] sitting there grouchy counting all his
[19:40] money my it's been a bad day didn't
[19:42] hardly make the rent oh my and the first
[19:45] thing you know this prostitute walks in
[19:48] well look what come in he didn't go out
[19:50] as a polite salesman or a gentleman
[19:52] should be and say what could I do for
[19:54] you he said well what do you want she
[19:56] said sir I want the best Alabaster box
[19:59] you got in the house not just anyone I
[20:01] want the
[20:03] best look she was giving everything she
[20:06] had every
[20:08] penny she had to give the best she could
[20:11] you you and I we just give a little side
[20:13] thing are you giving your best if you're
[20:16] not giving your best don't make fun of
[20:18] her she was giving her best and and her
[20:20] oil she had she said I want the best
[20:22] Alabaster Box you got of ointment well
[20:25] he said let's see how much money you got
[20:27] of course the clinking the money changed
[20:29] his idea he counted out 280 pieces of
[20:32] Roman daer and and just enough he gives
[20:35] her the alabaster
[20:37] box and man I I looked up just to try to
[20:41] find out what sum of money that she paid
[20:43] for this Alabaster Box and I don't know
[20:46] that anybody knows for sure but the
[20:47] estimation that I heard they came up
[20:49] with was about a equivalent of a year's
[20:53] salary so it's it and you know and
[20:56] inflation's going crazy so I don't know
[20:58] when these numbers were posted they
[20:59] number if they were posted 3 years ago
[21:01] you can add maybe 20 25% but it was
[21:04] approximately 54 to
[21:08] 55,000 54 to
[21:12] $55,000 this was special ointment that
[21:14] was imported from India and she didn't
[21:17] get an ounce of it she got the alabaster
[21:19] box will H from whatever quantity that
[21:22] was and so I don't know that that's an
[21:25] accurate number it's just what I found I
[21:28] don't know how they determined that but
[21:30] take it for what it's worth it was it
[21:32] would the Bible says very
[21:35] costly very
[21:37] costly brother bam tells us it was all
[21:39] her
[21:40] living she had earned it in a
[21:43] distasteful
[21:44] way she had earned it but brother B
[21:48] begins to tell us he begins to give us a
[21:49] backstory on this woman that she didn't
[21:51] want to be that way but she was turned
[21:53] out of a child and and this is the only
[21:55] thing that she could do but what she was
[21:57] saving this money for is she was saving
[21:59] it to get herself out of this life she
[22:02] was saving it up to get out of this
[22:05] cycle of prostitution to get out of this
[22:07] work she she didn't like it she didn't
[22:09] want it she didn't want to be there amen
[22:12] and so what she had done is scraped
[22:13] together every penny she could she had
[22:15] even brother bam talked about skipping
[22:17] meals and that's why she was attracted
[22:19] to the fragrance coming from the feast
[22:21] because she was hungry and she was
[22:22] trying her very best to purchase for
[22:25] herself a way out of this lifestyle a
[22:28] freedom from this bondage that she was
[22:30] in so she had labored she had worked and
[22:32] she had she had she had sacrificed and
[22:34] she had scraped together all of this and
[22:36] here in a moment she's willing to give
[22:38] to the last scent yes to
[22:42] Christ something in her this listen she
[22:45] doesn't have to do this but she has to
[22:49] do
[22:50] this oh that's when we get down to the
[22:53] reality of something amen when we don't
[22:55] have to do it but we have to do it I
[22:58] don't have to do it to satisfy anybody
[23:00] else I don't have to do it to satisfy a
[23:02] law I don't have to do it to make it to
[23:04] heaven but inside I have to do this
[23:07] there's something driving me I can't
[23:08] hold back I have to do this it's
[23:11] something pushing me pulling me I'm
[23:13] motivated by something I have to give
[23:15] more I have to give all I have to
[23:17] surrender
[23:18] more that's when we get to reality
[23:21] friends that's what God's looking
[23:23] for he's not looking for her money it
[23:26] wasn't the money amen it was her desire
[23:28] it was what the reality was that was
[23:30] moving
[23:32] her now when we look at this what what
[23:35] possibly is the sum of money that she
[23:37] had spent on this amen and and and and
[23:40] the scripture tells us that she broke
[23:42] the alabaster box listen I don't know
[23:45] about you but if I took got some perfume
[23:47] and I got a box of alabaster box full of
[23:50] perfume however many ounces that would
[23:51] be amen and and I had spent nearly
[23:55] $55,000 on this perfume I'd be careful
[23:58] in the the way I carried it and I would
[24:00] I would be tempted as a human being to
[24:02] open that up and break the seal and
[24:04] maybe just dip my fingers in it and
[24:06] maybe sprinkle a little bit on his feet
[24:08] because you know I I mean it's the same
[24:10] thing
[24:13] right right I'm I'm anointing amen I I I
[24:17] I need to anoint his feet I'm going to
[24:18] anoint his feet that wasn't what was in
[24:21] her heart it wasn't in her heart just to
[24:23] do something halfway and just still
[24:25] preserve herself and preserve her money
[24:27] and say sa something of herself when she
[24:30] got there listen it said she broke the
[24:32] alabaster box amen that's a point of no
[24:35] return that's no going back when she
[24:37] broke it she can't put it back in it's
[24:40] gone 54
[24:42] $555,000 and that's not just money it's
[24:44] her chance for Freedom it's her hope for
[24:47] an escape out of bondage Breaking Free
[24:49] from a lifestyle she could never get
[24:51] free from she what she poured out on
[24:53] jesus' feet was not a fragrance of an
[24:56] oil she pulled out the fragrance of of a
[24:58] life she gave up her life she gave up
[25:01] her hope she gave up every chance that
[25:03] she had to finally get free she gave it
[25:06] up to pour it out on Jesus's
[25:11] feet and Simon sat there gloating that
[25:14] he was a Pharisee and Jesus was in his
[25:21] house wouldn't welcome him wouldn't
[25:24] anoint him wouldn't serve him cuz he
[25:28] didn't want to lose face with the other
[25:30] Pharisees didn't want to be an
[25:34] extremist didn't want to look like he
[25:36] was part of the
[25:38] group but had him in his
[25:44] house
[25:47] my with all my heart I want to break my
[25:50] box with all my
[25:53] heart I'm tired of
[25:55] Dipping yes tired of tired of taking my
[25:59] life and just trying to pour a little
[26:01] out and preserve a little I'm tired of
[26:04] that all my heart I want God to give me
[26:07] the
[26:08] strength something inside of me pushing
[26:10] me from behind not because I have
[26:15] to with all my heart I want to break
[26:17] that
[26:18] box my hopes my dreams my
[26:22] self-preservation my reputation my
[26:25] everything God helped me to break my
[26:28] body
[26:28] box to shatter my own life and my own
[26:32] hopes and my own dreams and my own
[26:34] everything else everything that's
[26:36] me let it be broken At His
[26:40] Feet let me anoint him not with not with
[26:44] a little bit of change in an offering
[26:46] plate but let me anoint him with my
[26:48] whole life poured out at his
[26:51] feet and that will be a sweet Savor
[26:55] that'll fill the house
[26:58] Jesus goes on in the message Jesus keeps
[27:01] all his
[27:04] appointments says she went and brother
[27:06] Ben's making kissing sounds you can hear
[27:07] in the
[27:08] microphone as he's dramatizing her down
[27:11] there weeping pouring out the water
[27:13] flowing from her eyes in
[27:16] Repentance washing his feet and kissing
[27:20] them kiss his feet and cry and wash and
[27:23] wipe and kiss his feet again you know
[27:26] Jesus if he had moved one foot she'd
[27:28] have jumped up and ran out of there but
[27:31] you know he just sit there and let her
[27:33] do
[27:36] it you know if you want to do something
[27:39] he lets you do
[27:41] it it may be all out of order but he'll
[27:43] let you do it
[27:47] anyhow amen the the disciples didn't
[27:50] understand what was going on Jesus had a
[27:52] greater understanding he knew that he
[27:54] was being anointed for his burial but
[27:55] how was he being Anointed with a life
[27:58] that was being poured
[28:00] out and and another thing that's
[28:02] fascinating is brother Ben said he let
[28:04] her do this amen he knew this and he let
[28:08] he let her give her whole life he let
[28:10] her sacrifice everything he let her give
[28:13] up every penny that she had he let her
[28:16] do
[28:17] that and if you want to pour your life
[28:19] out he'll let you
[28:22] too he'll let us he won't stop us he's
[28:25] not like us where we say now listen
[28:26] sister that's okay just a little bit
[28:29] will
[28:32] do oh she poured it out and nobody
[28:37] instructed her
[28:38] to no nobody made her feel guilty for
[28:41] having the
[28:42] money nobody preached a hard sermon on
[28:46] giving that
[28:47] day nobody made her feel bad that she
[28:50] had a big savings of
[28:52] nobody pushed her persuaded her coerced
[28:56] her right but she was driven by another
[29:00] Force let's turn to Luke chapter 7 and
[29:03] let's read about some of this in Luke
[29:05] chapter
[29:23] 7 Luke chapter 7 and verse 36 if we
[29:26] could turn to 36
[29:30] and one of the Pharisees desired him
[29:32] that he would eat with him and he went
[29:34] into the Pharisees house and sat down to
[29:36] meet and behold a woman in the city
[29:38] which was a sinner when she knew that
[29:41] Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house
[29:43] brought an alabaster box of
[29:45] ointment I want you to notice in verse
[29:49] 37 there's one important word
[29:52] there Behold a woman in the city which
[29:56] was
[29:58] a
[30:00] sinner she was making a
[30:03] transition right
[30:05] now that was her condition but she's
[30:08] moving from sinner to
[30:13] Saint amen she was a
[30:16] sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at
[30:18] meet in the Pharisees house brought an
[30:20] alabaster box of ointment and stood At
[30:22] His Feet behind him weeping began to
[30:24] wash his feet with tears and did wipe
[30:26] them with the hairs of her head and
[30:28] kissed his feet and anointed them with
[30:30] the ointment now when the Pharisees
[30:32] which had bidden him saw it he spake
[30:34] within himself saying this man if he
[30:36] were a prophet would have known unto
[30:37] whom not what man or woman this is that
[30:40] toucheth him for she is a sinner and
[30:42] Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I
[30:45] have somewhat to say unto thee he said
[30:47] Master say on Jesus now wants to teach a
[30:53] lesson this
[30:55] Pharisee he begins to condemn Jesus for
[30:58] allowing this woman to touch him because
[31:01] in the Pharisees mind she's a
[31:05] sinner in jesus' mind she was a
[31:12] sinner how long does it take to work
[31:15] your way out of Sinner to not
[31:18] sinner doesn't take very long
[31:21] friends
[31:24] right and so he begins to talk to him
[31:27] about a a parable about a credor and who
[31:30] loveth much but I want to move down to
[31:33] verse
[31:34] 44 and he turned to the woman and he
[31:36] said unto
[31:37] Simon seest thou this woman I entered
[31:41] into thine house and thou gavest me no
[31:43] water for my feet but sheath washed me
[31:45] my feet with tears and wiped them with
[31:47] the hairs of her head thou gavest me no
[31:50] kiss but this woman since the time I
[31:52] came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
[31:55] my head with oil thou do not anoint but
[31:57] this man hath anointed my feet with
[31:59] ointment wherefore I say unto thee her
[32:01] sins which are many are forgiven for she
[32:05] loved much but to whom little was
[32:07] forgiven the same loveth little and he
[32:09] said unto her thy sins are
[32:13] forgiven she didn't go to
[32:15] church she didn't go to an
[32:18] altar she didn't put anything the
[32:21] offering plate she didn't make a
[32:22] confession she didn't shake the
[32:23] preacher's hand she didn't decide what
[32:26] church she was going to attend right
[32:29] amen she gave everything to
[32:32] Christ she served him with her whole
[32:35] life he said thy sins are
[32:38] forgiven and they that sat at meat with
[32:40] him began to say within themselves who
[32:43] is this that forgiveth sins also and he
[32:45] said unto the woman thy faith has saved
[32:48] thee go in peace what she was doing was
[32:51] an expression of an inward faith that
[32:53] she had not a commandment but a faith
[32:57] she was moving by faith she was
[33:00] operating by faith she was led by an
[33:02] inward something telling her this must
[33:05] be done and her faith expressed in the
[33:08] action and it wasn't the action that
[33:10] saved her it was her faith that saved
[33:12] her but her faith produced the action
[33:15] and the action testified to everybody
[33:17] around why she was saved amen but but to
[33:20] her G was saved by faith amen but it was
[33:25] that same faith that moved her to give
[33:27] all to go into complete
[33:30] action brother bam said in the voice of
[33:32] the sign he makes this uh statement
[33:34] which I love he said like the little
[33:36] woman with a pure heart and a defiled
[33:39] body and the Pharisee with a pure body
[33:42] and a defiled
[33:43] heart it condemned one and saved the
[33:46] other
[33:47] one he had Jesus in his house but his
[33:50] heart wasn't right he had a position in
[33:53] the church and he had maybe some of his
[33:55] colleagues there and he had the great
[33:57] Messiah he had him there but his heart
[34:00] wasn't right and when Jesus says her
[34:04] sins which were many are all
[34:07] forgiven and and and he looked at her
[34:09] and says thy sins are forgiven thee and
[34:11] and he says thy faith has saved
[34:14] thee listen it's such a a
[34:18] contrast between the Pharisee and what
[34:21] other religious leaders were there they
[34:24] believed that they were saved they
[34:25] believed their security came because
[34:27] they were in good standing with the
[34:29] church and they had kept certain rules
[34:31] and regulations and they had kept
[34:33] certain orders and and they had certain
[34:35] positions and Prestige and acceptance in
[34:37] a certain category or group of people
[34:40] and they they felt secure in that but
[34:42] here is Jesus amen the very word of God
[34:45] made manifest amen the message of the
[34:47] hour is sitting right there and because
[34:49] he's in the house amen and because of
[34:52] all these other things they feel pretty
[34:54] good about it yeah
[34:59] I want more than having the message in
[35:01] my
[35:04] house I want to give my whole life to
[35:06] anoint it and serve it and worship it
[35:10] bear the reproach and wash and kiss this
[35:14] beautiful Christ that been delivered to
[35:18] us she had a defiled body but a pure
[35:22] heart so I ask you which one worked the
[35:25] pure body or the Pure Heart
[35:28] was the Pure Heart amen
[35:31] amen in John chap 12 if we could just
[35:34] flip quickly flip over there John
[35:36] chapter
[35:45] 12 John
[35:53] 12:4 then said one of his disciples John
[35:56] 12:4 then said one of his disciples
[35:58] judas's scariot Simon's son which should
[36:00] betray him why was not this ointment
[36:02] sold for 300 p and given to the poor
[36:05] this he said not that he cared for the
[36:07] poor but because he was a thief and had
[36:10] the bag and bear what was put
[36:15] therein we we looked at Simon and we
[36:17] looked at this prostitute woman but I
[36:20] want to look a little bit at Judas
[36:22] now the Bible said he was a
[36:25] thief and had the bag
[36:28] and bear what was put therein this is
[36:31] really interesting
[36:33] language because he had the
[36:36] bag and it didn't say that he be the
[36:40] bag he bear what was put there
[36:43] in that means to Bear means to carry or
[36:46] to lift that means that Judas wasn't
[36:49] just carrying the bag he was carrying
[36:51] what was in the bag Judas was a thief he
[36:54] was robbing out of the treasury of
[36:56] Christ Ministry
[36:58] right cu the Bible said he was a thief
[37:00] he was a thief and he had the bag and he
[37:02] bare what was put there in he was
[37:04] skimming off the top we could say yeah
[37:10] yeah Psalms 51:6 said behold thou
[37:13] desirest truth in the inward
[37:16] parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt
[37:18] make me to know
[37:22] wisdom
[37:23] Judas if we look at the life of Judas
[37:28] Judas
[37:29] was chosen by Jesus Christ to be a
[37:34] disciple Judas did not ask can I be your
[37:38] disciple and he didn't send an
[37:39] application in and he didn't show up one
[37:41] day and say I'm your
[37:43] disciple but Jesus said unto them have I
[37:46] not chosen you
[37:48] 12 and one of you is a
[37:52] devil see when did he say this he said
[37:55] it in John chapter 6
[37:58] and in John chapter 6 Jesus is dealing
[38:01] with the Pharisees and he starts to deal
[38:03] with the Ministerial Association and he
[38:06] the word is coming so hard without
[38:08] explanation people are walking away and
[38:10] walking
[38:12] away and Jesus said in John 664 but
[38:16] there are some of you that believe not
[38:18] for Jesus knew from the beginning who
[38:19] they were that believe
[38:23] not and who should betray him
[38:27] listen he's not speaking of just Judas
[38:29] now he's talking of those in the 70 in
[38:31] the Ministerial Association that are
[38:33] going to walk away Jesus knew from the
[38:35] beginning who believe
[38:37] not but he let them be part of the
[38:40] campaign
[38:41] Ministry he even sent them out two by
[38:44] two Amen to go preach the gospel in the
[38:46] cities amen and they went ahead of him
[38:49] preaching the gospel they had part of
[38:50] the ministry they were ministering the
[38:52] word and they came back saying the
[38:55] devils are subject to us yeah right they
[38:59] had healing they had manifestations they
[39:02] were in the ministry of Jesus Christ
[39:04] they were in the campaign they were in
[39:07] what God was doing for their day they
[39:09] weren't Outsiders they were insiders
[39:12] am and it
[39:15] said Jesus knew from the beginning who
[39:19] they were that believed
[39:21] not if Jesus knew from the beginning why
[39:23] did they let them have part of the
[39:25] ministry why did he let them go from
[39:28] Village to Village why did he let them
[39:30] speak on his behalf and go be as a
[39:33] forerunner before he came into those
[39:34] Villages and start to testify of the
[39:37] Gospel the good news and the day and
[39:39] hour they were living in why did he let
[39:41] them do that he already
[39:45] knew furthermore he knew who would
[39:47] betray him he knew Judas was a devil but
[39:51] yet he says have I I chose you
[39:53] [Music]
[39:54] 12 Jesus picked Judas Judas didn't pick
[39:58] Jesus
[40:01] amen when I look at this sometimes I
[40:05] just I just
[40:07] think how how can these things
[40:13] be when when we think about what causes
[40:17] so much
[40:19] strain so much trouble in the church and
[40:22] people's
[40:24] lives you know how many people reference
[40:27] false
[40:28] Ministry I'm all tied up because I saw
[40:31] hypocrisy I saw somebody leave the
[40:33] message I saw false Ministry they
[40:35] preached the word but then they
[40:37] left what about everybody in the village
[40:39] that heard these men
[40:41] preach
[40:43] right what about the people that were
[40:46] healed by Judas laying hands on them and
[40:48] praying for them yeah
[40:53] right you know people would have had
[40:55] confidence in Judas because Judas had
[40:57] gifts yeah right god-given gifts y
[41:02] people would have confidence in Judas
[41:04] because Judas was always sitting at meat
[41:06] with
[41:07] Jesus they would have confidence with
[41:09] him because of his close proximity to
[41:12] Christ yeah and furthermore Jesus chose
[41:15] him to be the treasurer yeah right well
[41:19] if Jesus chose him to be a disciple one
[41:23] of the 12 and Jesus chose him to be a
[41:26] trustee
[41:28] then
[41:30] surely he's God's choice is God's man
[41:35] there's not going to be any problem
[41:37] here but his heart was a thief and Jesus
[41:40] knew it yeah and who did Jesus give the
[41:43] money bag to the
[41:47] thief everybody else would be confused
[41:50] by this but Jesus isn't
[41:55] confused he say why why would God allow
[41:58] that why would God allow false Brethren
[42:01] why would God allow Judas to Fall Away
[42:04] think about the people that were
[42:06] confused by what but Jesus made him a
[42:09] Treasurer and Jesus was always talking
[42:11] to him and Jesus sent him out and when
[42:13] they prayed we were all
[42:16] healed and now they say that this isn't
[42:19] the Messiah and they've run away and now
[42:21] Judas betrayed him and went and hung
[42:23] himself what am I supposed to
[42:25] believe yes what am I supposed to do how
[42:29] can I
[42:30] trust how can I ever trust a minister
[42:33] again how can I ever trust this message
[42:36] how can I trust how can I trust
[42:40] Jesus that's not what people say but
[42:44] that's actually the problem yeah no
[42:47] one's going to say how can I trust Jesus
[42:50] how can how can Jesus allow that man to
[42:54] become pastor of the church when he has
[42:56] that thing hidden in his life and then
[42:58] later it all comes out and WS havoc and
[42:59] it wrecks the whole church how could
[43:02] Jesus let you can't tell me that was God
[43:07] how now how am I supposed to ever trust
[43:10] another Minister how am I supposed to
[43:12] yes and the reality is it's not the
[43:15] minister you're not trusting it's the
[43:17] one who picked the minister right amen
[43:19] it's the one who put him in that
[43:20] position it's the one who let him be
[43:22] your pastor or the Evangelist who led
[43:23] you to the Lord or or the close brother
[43:25] you were associated with that shared the
[43:27] message with you and then later fell in
[43:28] adultery and ran away or denounced the
[43:33] message how could God do a thing like
[43:35] that he's always done a thing like
[43:40] that why because God has got to get to
[43:44] the heart he's got to find out what's
[43:47] inside amen and he gives everybody an
[43:51] opportunity so just because Jesus comes
[43:53] to your house doesn't mean everything's
[43:55] fine and just because you have a
[43:57] Ministry and just because you pray for
[43:58] the sick and they're healed and just
[43:59] because he makes you the treasur sorry
[44:01] brother
[44:02] Dean we love you brother sorry brother
[44:05] we believe in
[44:06] you but we're
[44:17] watching see you understand people ask
[44:20] questions legitimately so they were hurt
[44:22] legitimately so wounded absolutely
[44:25] confused without a doubt amen amen amen
[44:28] but where is that outside the scope of
[44:30] the Bible where is that contrary to the
[44:32] way Jesus acted when he was on earth
[44:36] right it's not ex an excuse to pull away
[44:40] amen from the word that God laid out in
[44:42] our day it's not an excuse to pull away
[44:44] from church it's not an excuse to pull
[44:45] away from fivefold Ministry it's not an
[44:47] excuse to pull away from the Brethren
[44:49] right it's a reality
[44:51] yes it's it's true is it wounding it's
[44:54] hurtful it's all of those things but
[44:56] it's it's not contrary to the Bible and
[44:59] it's not contrary to the nature of Jesus
[45:01] Christ
[45:07] amen so many people I imagine were quite
[45:11] confused by
[45:15] Judas I think the disciples
[45:19] themselves were quite confused with the
[45:22] 70 who walked away yeah probably quite
[45:25] discouraged yeah
[45:33] Jesus goes on to say in John 665 and he
[45:35] said therefore said I unto you that no
[45:37] man can come unto me except it were
[45:38] given unto him of my father from that
[45:41] time many of his disciples went back and
[45:43] walked no more with him then said Jesus
[45:45] unto the twel will you also go away then
[45:49] Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom
[45:50] shall we go thou Hast the words of
[45:52] eternal life and we believe and are sure
[45:55] that thou art that Christ the son of the
[45:57] Living God Jesus answered them have not
[46:01] I chosen you 12 and one of you as a
[46:12] devil je Peter says and we
[46:15] believe who was standing there the 12
[46:19] who is included in we Judas
[46:22] amen and we believe and are sure that
[46:25] thou art the Christ the son of the
[46:26] living God and Jesus answered them not I
[46:29] chosen you 12 and one of you is a
[46:35] devil what an statement for a loving God
[46:38] to
[46:41] make see God doesn't he's not a man like
[46:45] we are and thinks like we are he thinks
[46:47] different than we
[46:49] do if somebody made a statement like
[46:53] that we would we would absolutely feel
[46:57] so like that was so unjust and so unfair
[47:01] how can you look at 12 who just said
[47:03] that they believe you to be the Christ
[47:04] the son of the Living God that you alone
[47:06] have the words of eternal life and you
[47:08] with no heart no feeling no love turns
[47:12] around and says yeah but one of you is a
[47:14] devil and doesn't explain who it is and
[47:17] leaves all 12 of them to wonder and to
[47:20] pray and to agonize and have
[47:25] self-doubt right Jesus doesn't do
[47:29] that yes he does but he doesn't do it
[47:33] anymore he only did with the
[47:41] disciples see the situations are always
[47:44] going to be
[47:45] such that the elect seed is going to
[47:48] have to pop out and manifest
[47:52] itself has
[47:54] to it has to God knows that there's
[47:57] something planted in the soul of the
[47:59] predestinated that'll you pour concrete
[48:02] on it it'll come around you put it in
[48:04] the middle in the bottom of a bog it'll
[48:06] push its way up like The Lily to the
[48:07] sunlight it's going to go through the
[48:09] mud and the murky water why because
[48:11] there's a life inside that will Express
[48:13] itself and God knows it and he's not
[48:15] afraid that it won't happen he's not
[48:17] afraid to let you go through church
[48:18] splits and heartbreaks and have people
[48:20] lie about you be rejected have your very
[48:23] close Associates and turn their back on
[48:25] the message and condemn you for still
[48:26] believing it amen he he he's not afraid
[48:29] to let all of that happen because he
[48:31] knows there's something in the seed
[48:33] that'll grab that word and will give out
[48:35] their life and pour out that fragrance
[48:37] and not hold back and go all the
[48:40] way and it's got to be made
[48:46] manifest I said
[48:48] before Jesus says
[48:51] this and when you really just stop and
[48:53] think about it
[48:58] Peter just says Thou alone have the
[49:01] words of eternal life Thou Art Christ
[49:03] the son of and thou alone there's no
[49:05] place else for us to go we're trusting
[49:08] you we're loving you you're everything
[49:09] to us and you speak
[49:12] truth he turns around and says yeah but
[49:14] one of you is a
[49:18] devil and I'm not telling you
[49:21] who I don't know about you but if I was
[49:24] standing in the group he said that too I
[49:25] wouldn't have slept that night yeah mhm
[49:29] I may not have slept for a few
[49:35] nights we have to be
[49:37] careful that we don't make the
[49:39] righteousness of God
[49:41] unjust and condemn it and say things
[49:44] about God we ought not to
[49:46] say he knows what he's doing he knew
[49:49] what he was doing here with these
[49:50] disciples he knew what he was doing with
[49:51] the 70 he knew what he was doing in
[49:53] Simon's house and he knew what he was
[49:55] going to do for that prostitute yeah
[49:57] amen she had to have an opportunity to
[49:59] express so that she could have
[50:03] life she had to push her way through
[50:06] muck she had to work her way around the
[50:09] concrete the life had to come out am
[50:13] amen God's going to God may allow a
[50:16] little concrete to get poured over our
[50:20] lives he may allow the seed to drop into
[50:23] muck and M and dirt and dark stagnant
[50:26] water
[50:30] but he knows if he just shines the light
[50:33] the life will come to the
[50:35] life and it'll all be all right in the
[50:38] end friends heartache
[50:41] sure scars
[50:44] absolutely but in the end it'll be all
[50:47] right
[50:56] Jesus in John 7 17 you don't have the
[50:58] term it's going to quote quickly he's
[51:00] praying he says while I was with them in
[51:02] the world I kept them in thy name those
[51:05] that thou gavest me I have kept and none
[51:07] of them is lost but the son of predition
[51:10] that the scripture might be
[51:12] fulfilled so then we find out that not
[51:15] only did Jesus choose Judas Judas was
[51:18] given to Jesus by the
[51:24] father my goodness
[51:28] my
[51:31] goodness let's turn to John chapter 12
[51:34] I'm sorry John Chapter
[51:44] 13 John Chapter 13 and let's go to verse
[51:50] 26 Jesus answered and he it is to whom I
[51:54] shall give a sop when I have dipped it
[51:57] and when he had dipped the soop he gave
[51:59] it to judas's scari the son of Simon and
[52:01] after the soop Satan entered into him
[52:04] then said Jesus unto him that thou doest
[52:07] do
[52:10] quickly we know that Judas was ordained
[52:13] to a certain
[52:15] position but Judas also was part of the
[52:20] ministry he says uh in the church age
[52:23] book we just went through this this past
[52:25] Thursday at the Bible study so it's
[52:27] really fresh to
[52:29] me in uh the sardan church age brother
[52:33] Brenham says Judas was numbered with the
[52:36] 12 and actually had a part with them in
[52:38] the ministry previous to
[52:41] Pentecost and he he quotes acts uh 1:
[52:44] 16- 17 men and Brethren this scripture
[52:46] must needs have been fulfilled which the
[52:48] Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
[52:50] before concerning Judas which was guide
[52:52] to them that took Jesus for he was
[52:55] numbered with us and had a obtained a
[52:57] part of this
[52:59] ministry the part that Judas obtained
[53:01] this is Brother brandham again the part
[53:02] that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and
[53:04] then lost was neither inferior to the
[53:07] ministry of the other 11 nor was it a
[53:09] devilish foreign Ministry interjected
[53:11] amongst the ministry of
[53:13] others it was part of the ministry of
[53:15] Christ it was a true Ministry with true
[53:21] results because the disciples knew that
[53:23] somebody else must take that Ministry
[53:25] that's where they drew lots and and they
[53:26] chose Mias but that was man's Choice it
[53:28] was actually supposed to go to Paul so
[53:31] it wasn't like the ministry he had was
[53:35] devilish it wasn't false it was true
[53:39] just because he was a devil didn't mean
[53:41] the ministry he took part off was
[53:43] devilish right just because he was an
[53:46] error and would fall away doesn't mean
[53:47] the ministry of Christ that he partook
[53:49] of and had a part of was any less than
[53:51] the other
[53:53] 11 and it doesn't mean the Miracles were
[53:55] less and it doesn't mean the truth was
[53:57] less
[53:59] truth it means he was
[54:03] false he goes on in in Acts 125 the
[54:06] prophet quotes that he may take part of
[54:08] this ministry and apostleship from which
[54:10] Judas by transgression fell that he
[54:12] might go to his own place Judas a devil
[54:16] lost a god-given holy ghost
[54:19] Ministry there we go could God do it
[54:24] again I believe he can Judas the devil
[54:28] lost a god-given holy ghost Ministry and
[54:30] killed himself and went to his own place
[54:33] his name was even uh in the book of life
[54:35] but his name was blotted
[54:38] out so we find out now that that Judas
[54:43] of course was ordained to a certain
[54:45] position but he had his name in The Book
[54:46] of
[54:47] Life he had part of the ministry of
[54:50] Jesus Christ you can't get much closer
[54:53] in proximity and in position and even
[54:56] preaching and even manifestation of
[54:59] gifts it doesn't get much if you could
[55:01] say it doesn't get much better it
[55:02] doesn't get much better or closer than
[55:06] Judas but when he comes to verse uh
[55:10] chapter 13 and he said when he dipped
[55:12] the S and he handed it to Judas and the
[55:15] devil entered into Judas and he says
[55:17] what thou doest do quickly listen you
[55:19] can say you know what could Judas do the
[55:21] devil entered into him or the devil just
[55:23] entered into him he went and did what he
[55:25] did but when we go go back and we
[55:27] recognize what was in Judas all along
[55:30] when Judas saw this woman give her whole
[55:32] life and sacrifice everything she had to
[55:35] anoint Jesus Christ he had indignation
[55:37] in his heart and he said why wasn't this
[55:39] this is a waste amen what was he calling
[55:41] a waste a pure worship where somebody
[55:43] gave their whole life to Christ yeah
[55:46] said this is a waste amen why wasn't
[55:48] this sold and given to the poor but he
[55:50] said that because he was a thief and he
[55:52] was dipping out of the bag amen and and
[55:54] listen I don't I I I know Judas was
[55:57] ordained to a certain role but somewhere
[55:59] along the way Judas knew he was
[56:03] wrong Judas knew it wasn't just one day
[56:06] all of a sudden whmo he he he's he's uh
[56:09] incarnated with the Devil the Devil
[56:11] comes and takes him over it didn't
[56:13] happen like that somewhere along the
[56:15] line in Jesus Judas he would have a
[56:17] healing campaign then would go out and
[56:19] he would realize he need a little extra
[56:20] money but they won't miss this little
[56:22] bit off the top and he pulled it out of
[56:24] the bag and he put it in his own pocket
[56:26] amen and he went along or I have a
[56:27] little need or my wife this and and and
[56:29] and it's okay I'll make it up later I
[56:32] I'll I'll I'll I'll return it later I'll
[56:34] do this and and and it maybe it got out
[56:36] of hand and maybe it got worse and maybe
[56:38] it didn't I don't know but at some point
[56:40] he was lusting for more money and the
[56:42] fact that he wished that we could have
[56:43] sold this for 300 p and give to the poor
[56:46] not that he wanted to give to the poor
[56:47] but he wanted part of that money
[56:51] yeah it probably didn't start with
[56:54] outright handfuls of money on it
[56:56] probably started with I need little need
[56:58] I need just a little bit of this and and
[57:00] and I'll make it up or I'll tell him
[57:02] about it later I don't have an
[57:03] opportunity yet and and it goes
[57:06] on somewhere along the line Judas knew
[57:09] he was wrong and he didn't do anything
[57:10] about
[57:13] it he knew he wasn't living true he knew
[57:16] he wasn't being honest he knew he wasn't
[57:18] what that he was projecting to everybody
[57:21] else and guess what he could do steal
[57:25] from Jesus Christ
[57:27] and go heal the
[57:32] sick take money out of the
[57:36] bag and go preach the
[57:44] gospel there's a statement in first
[57:46] Timothy that says they have their
[57:47] conscience seared with a hot
[57:53] iron some point
[57:58] Judas maybe he was under some sort of
[58:02] self-deception that thought well I'm in
[58:04] the ministry and Jesus never said
[58:06] anything to
[58:07] me so I must be okay I haven't been
[58:12] called out during the
[58:15] service nobody's preached against it I
[58:18] was listening to brother Bren on a tape
[58:20] one time or just this week and he was
[58:22] saying some woman came up to brother
[58:23] Brenham and he was really really
[58:25] preaching a hard message in an
[58:26] Evangelistic message and she goes well
[58:28] thank god brother BR you never touched
[58:30] me tonight he said oh good go God bless
[58:32] you
[58:33] Sister and then he asked somebody next
[58:35] to him he says uh who is that that must
[58:37] be a Godly sister and the person next to
[58:39] him said that's the biggest gossip in
[58:41] town brother bman forgot to preach about
[58:46] gossip but she knew what she
[58:49] was and she knew he didn't touch her why
[58:53] did he have to call it out
[58:56] right yeah
[58:59] right there was a woman who come to
[59:01] brother bandam she was going crazy and
[59:03] she kept wanting prayer and want in
[59:04] prayer and he prayed for her one time at
[59:06] a meeting and they prayed at a a
[59:08] Methodist Church in local area and she
[59:10] wasn't getting any better finally she
[59:12] asked one day when you're under the
[59:13] anointing can I come to your house and
[59:15] she stayed in contact with with sister
[59:16] MAA and it worked out she come to the
[59:18] house and she couldn't get free she was
[59:20] nervous and having a nervous breakdown
[59:23] and come to find out that she had failed
[59:25] her
[59:27] husband broke her marriage vow so long
[59:29] ago but never confessed it kept that
[59:32] thing hidden said I confessed it to
[59:35] God and she was a Sunday school teacher
[59:39] teaching Sunday school and her pastor
[59:41] had a good impression of
[59:48] her and she was in church and in service
[59:53] and teaching kids and she was falling
[59:57] apart because somewhere along the line
[59:59] she wasn't
[1:00:01] honest she wasn't
[1:00:03] honest she was keeping something hidden
[1:00:06] Judas was keeping something hidden yes
[1:00:09] he was he was a
[1:00:12] thief and he was keeping it
[1:00:16] hidden brother Braham said the most
[1:00:18] dangerous the not dangerous he said the
[1:00:21] fastest place a log rots is when it's in
[1:00:23] the stream of water
[1:00:26] talked about going and jumping up on a
[1:00:27] old beach log it looked like a solid log
[1:00:29] and he jumped on it was rotten and there
[1:00:30] had been a little Branch a little bit of
[1:00:32] water that had been running underneath
[1:00:33] of it and it was rottening out from
[1:00:35] inside and and brother Brenham types
[1:00:37] that to the church you can sit in church
[1:00:39] and rot faster than anywhere else amen
[1:00:41] because we're not he says because there
[1:00:43] was no life in it had fallen and there
[1:00:45] was no life in it and it had rotten out
[1:00:56] the woman who washed jesus' feet knew
[1:00:58] what she
[1:01:00] was the Pharisee should have been
[1:01:04] honest in his heart he was critical
[1:01:07] towards Jesus he was mocking him in his
[1:01:10] heart and he was had false interior
[1:01:12] motives for having him there at his
[1:01:15] house should have been
[1:01:18] honest this woman was
[1:01:20] honest but he's in my house but I'm in
[1:01:24] the church but I'm in the
[1:01:30] message but I prayed for my wife and she
[1:01:33] got better I prayed for my husband and
[1:01:35] he was
[1:01:36] healed I teach Sunday school I preach I
[1:01:39] witness to my neighbor and they came to
[1:01:41] the
[1:01:43] message but are you a
[1:01:49] thief are you an adulterer with your
[1:01:53] eyes looking upon a woman lust after
[1:01:57] her at some point we got to be honest
[1:02:00] and not feel like we're okay because I'm
[1:02:02] in good standing in the
[1:02:05] church can't keep things hidden all the
[1:02:08] time and expect that it's going to work
[1:02:11] out amen I have a problem with tobacco I
[1:02:15] have a problem with lying I have a
[1:02:16] problem with
[1:02:20] stealing but God blesses me and I feel
[1:02:22] his presence in the
[1:02:24] church Simon felt his presence in his
[1:02:28] house his presence was
[1:02:31] there but it didn't make Simon
[1:02:34] right no doubt Judas felt something
[1:02:37] under the anointing of preaching the
[1:02:38] gospel no doubt he felt something when
[1:02:40] he laid hands on the sick and they
[1:02:44] recovered but he was still a
[1:02:49] thief wasn't just one day a a good boy
[1:02:52] serving Christ serving the word doing
[1:02:54] the best he can and all of a sudden WHL
[1:02:57] he's taken over by the
[1:02:59] devil doesn't happen like
[1:03:02] that it happens because something comes
[1:03:04] in and we don't deal with
[1:03:07] it we're not honest about it we allow
[1:03:11] bitterness to grow in our heart and
[1:03:12] blame everybody else for our
[1:03:14] bitterness we lie to protect ourselves
[1:03:17] and we never expose it we do this we do
[1:03:20] that we do the
[1:03:23] other but I want to be real from the
[1:03:25] bottom to the top all I can say is God
[1:03:29] help
[1:03:29] us help us Lord this Human Experience is
[1:03:33] a is is dangerous this Human Experience
[1:03:36] is horrible amen there's always this
[1:03:38] self-preservation there's always self-
[1:03:40] protection there's always want these
[1:03:41] lust that we're fighting with all the
[1:03:43] time but God give me more of your spirit
[1:03:45] to overcome this
[1:03:49] flesh somewhere along the line Judas
[1:03:53] conscience was seared with a hot iron
[1:03:56] yes to where he could see a woman
[1:03:58] worship Jesus Christ with pure worship
[1:04:01] with all of her heart with everything
[1:04:02] she has and he can criticize
[1:04:05] it because he wanted more
[1:04:08] money that he was stealing out of the
[1:04:13] treasury I don't know about you but
[1:04:15] that's that's a pretty seared
[1:04:19] conscience right that's a conscience
[1:04:22] that's really seared
[1:04:29] and so we find his
[1:04:31] destination is to be taken over by a
[1:04:35] devil why it's because he was playing
[1:04:38] with
[1:04:40] Devils so he was opening himself to
[1:04:43] devils and that Spirit he played around
[1:04:46] with began to sear his conscience to he
[1:04:49] actually believed everything was going
[1:04:51] to be okay he got to the point where he
[1:04:53] believed he could sell out Jesus but
[1:04:55] Jesus take care of himself and somehow
[1:04:57] Escape like he's escaped before and I
[1:04:59] can take the money and move on and
[1:05:00] everything will be
[1:05:02] fine sear his conscience that bad that
[1:05:04] he could believe that he could he could
[1:05:06] he could do something like that and it
[1:05:08] would still work out
[1:05:13] okay our conscience gets
[1:05:16] seared we don't pay tithe well because
[1:05:20] we're having a little bit of a hard time
[1:05:21] at home right now we don't give an offer
[1:05:24] and we make more excuses more excus and
[1:05:25] then it's been a year 2 years 3
[1:05:27] years we haven't done the most basic and
[1:05:30] simplest of
[1:05:32] things but we feel excused about it
[1:05:35] because by the way I still feel good in
[1:05:38] service and I still feel the presence of
[1:05:39] the Lord and when I sing I
[1:05:44] still God help us not to have a
[1:05:46] conscience so seared that we can violate
[1:05:48] the word of God Monday through Saturday
[1:05:50] and come in in Sunday raise our hands in
[1:05:52] worship and feel something and think
[1:05:53] we're okay amen
[1:05:59] have a heart that criticizes everybody
[1:06:01] have bitterness in my heart have hate
[1:06:03] and contempt towards somebody have a lie
[1:06:06] I told about somebody else have
[1:06:07] something I'm taking that's not right be
[1:06:09] corrupt in some way at
[1:06:11] work be seeing doing talking about
[1:06:14] things I ought not and come to church
[1:06:16] and it's okay because I still feel the
[1:06:18] presence of the Lord listen he comes
[1:06:20] where he's invited
[1:06:29] amen I'm sorry that this is heavy I just
[1:06:32] don't know why I can't help it
[1:06:34] friends it's not my intention and not
[1:06:37] what I intended to
[1:06:41] preach let's go to Second Timothy 4
[1:07:00] second Timothy chapter
[1:07:04] 4 verse
[1:07:08] 9 2 Timothy 4:9 do thy diligence to come
[1:07:12] shortly unto me for demoth has forsaken
[1:07:15] me having loved this present world and
[1:07:17] has departed into
[1:07:20] thessalonica Deus has forsaken me having
[1:07:23] loved this present world
[1:07:26] brother bam starts to talk about this in
[1:07:28] present stage of my
[1:07:30] Ministry and he says see the time comes
[1:07:33] friend and I want people in the land
[1:07:35] that tapes to go out to remember that
[1:07:37] the separating time has to come it must
[1:07:39] do it I don't know how far I am from the
[1:07:42] end time my end of the road I don't know
[1:07:44] that's up to God I don't know what
[1:07:46] tomorrow is I don't know what it holds
[1:07:48] but I know who's holding it so that's
[1:07:50] where my faith is built on now I imagine
[1:07:54] Deus didn't forsake Him and start off
[1:07:55] into
[1:07:57] nightclubs I don't imagine Deus did that
[1:08:00] cuz Deus was a Spirit-filled man he was
[1:08:02] a great helper if you ever took the
[1:08:04] history of deus he was a notable
[1:08:05] preacher a fine culture man a highly
[1:08:07] polished educated he was a smart man but
[1:08:10] why would he forsake Paul that's the
[1:08:12] thing what made him do it forsake Paul I
[1:08:15] don't believe he wanted to go to the
[1:08:16] nightclub or anything but I believe it
[1:08:18] was God separating
[1:08:20] Paul further on he says and why would he
[1:08:23] turn his back on such a person as that
[1:08:25] and be had been Vindicated that he was a
[1:08:27] servant of Christ do you notice Paul
[1:08:29] here loving this present world I don't
[1:08:31] think Deus
[1:08:34] backslid further now says Deus loving
[1:08:37] this present World popularity of men
[1:08:40] hello Dr
[1:08:41] Deus further D says Deus said I ain't
[1:08:44] associating with this guy like that he's
[1:08:46] a low class of a person I'll go up with
[1:08:49] the denomination on bre I'll go up where
[1:08:51] I'll be somebody
[1:08:57] Deus left Paul because he saw Paul
[1:09:00] Ministry diminishing he saw it going
[1:09:02] down and now Paul only had one coat and
[1:09:05] Paul had left a friend sick in another
[1:09:07] city and and brother R goes into all of
[1:09:09] this in present stage of my Ministry and
[1:09:11] Paul gets chased out of the city by the
[1:09:13] copper Smith in one place and it looks
[1:09:15] like Paul's all washed up he's he's a
[1:09:17] fugitive he's on the Run he doesn't have
[1:09:19] any more power like he used he used to
[1:09:21] Smite blind he used to cast out Devils
[1:09:24] but he left his buddy sick
[1:09:27] he's only got one code and he he
[1:09:30] couldn't just stand in the face I was in
[1:09:32] but he got chased out of the city by the
[1:09:33] copper
[1:09:35] Smith and
[1:09:37] Deus somehow got to the place in his own
[1:09:40] pride and his own arrogance and his own
[1:09:42] desire for
[1:09:44] popularity that Deus would be willing to
[1:09:47] forsake Paul the messenger of the
[1:09:49] hour and walk away from Paul and stop
[1:09:52] helping him and supporting him and turn
[1:09:54] his back on Paul and feel totally
[1:09:56] justified because because of course you
[1:09:58] know Paul's failing now amen and Paul
[1:10:01] there's something there's something
[1:10:02] wrong with
[1:10:04] Paul so I'm turning my back on Paul and
[1:10:07] the justification is there's something
[1:10:08] wrong with Paul obviously God's not
[1:10:10] blessing his ministry like it used to so
[1:10:12] something's wrong with
[1:10:14] Paul but the reality is the problem was
[1:10:17] inside Deus yeah right the promise
[1:10:20] wasn't inside Paul the problem was
[1:10:22] inside
[1:10:23] Deus Deus want to know variety Deus
[1:10:26] wanted popularity Deus didn't want to go
[1:10:28] to a nightclub to a bar he didn't want
[1:10:30] to start drinking he didn't want to
[1:10:31] start smoking he stayed in church he
[1:10:33] went to the denominations he wanted to
[1:10:35] be
[1:10:37] somebody that was the problem with
[1:10:40] Deus and he was willing to reject Paul
[1:10:43] and walk away from
[1:10:45] Paul because he wasn't being honest with
[1:10:51] himself said God help me to be honest
[1:10:53] with myself
[1:10:55] stop making excuses for myself stop
[1:10:59] passing over
[1:11:00] infractions stop saying it's because of
[1:11:03] this happened or because I have this
[1:11:04] tendency and I have a temper because my
[1:11:08] mom you know that may be true you may
[1:11:11] have you may have inherited a temper
[1:11:12] from your mom but that's no excuse to
[1:11:15] let it lay there expose that thing talk
[1:11:18] about it pray about it push against it
[1:11:20] fight again don't don't don't just say
[1:11:22] it's my mom I got this because of my mom
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] so it's your mom's fault you just to off
[1:11:28] everybody in the
[1:11:29] room right it's mom's fault you just
[1:11:33] spoke that way to your husband or to
[1:11:34] your children that that was mom's fault
[1:11:36] no that's your
[1:11:40] fault sometimes we got to be honest I
[1:11:42] spoke with a brother one time I was
[1:11:43] speaking with talking to a ministering
[1:11:45] brother and he told me when he was a
[1:11:47] young man he was struggling with lust
[1:11:48] and he couldn't get over it and and how
[1:11:51] he had been to the altar he had been to
[1:11:52] the prayer line he had prayed he had he
[1:11:54] had read his Bible he had listened to
[1:11:56] the message he had talked to God he
[1:11:58] wanted to be free and he couldn't break
[1:12:00] free and he told me where his freedom
[1:12:03] came said I was sitting outside a
[1:12:05] brother's house and I confessed my
[1:12:06] faults to
[1:12:09] him I humbled myself and exposed where
[1:12:12] sin was hiding in my life and he said I
[1:12:15] had prayed and I went to The Altar and I
[1:12:17] went to meetings and I went to this but
[1:12:19] my Deliverance came on a porch when I
[1:12:21] told my brother what I was going through
[1:12:24] and he prayed with me and I've been free
[1:12:26] ever since
[1:12:29] God or we could say it must be okay cuz
[1:12:32] he's still blessing me I I I'll get
[1:12:35] better later I'll
[1:12:39] just better be careful that we don't
[1:12:41] leave those things lay yes because Judas
[1:12:44] left it lay Deus left it
[1:12:47] lay won leave those things lay but
[1:12:50] expose those things say listen I I'm
[1:12:52] ashamed of this but I'm having trouble
[1:12:54] with this now I don't suggest you write
[1:12:56] it down for the whole church to read I
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] mean but don't stuff it don't hide it
[1:13:04] don't act like it's okay and don't don't
[1:13:07] know in your heart you're wrong amen and
[1:13:09] wait for well if if it's wrong the
[1:13:11] preacher will say something about it you
[1:13:12] already know it's wrong why do you need
[1:13:14] the preacher to say something about it
[1:13:16] you've got a seat of God on the inside
[1:13:18] and if you've got the Holy Ghost you've
[1:13:19] got the teacher that'll teach the word
[1:13:21] to you when that woman said brother
[1:13:23] brandham you didn't touch me tonight
[1:13:25] amen where was the holy ghost in her
[1:13:27] that would take the word and find the
[1:13:28] application in her life because the
[1:13:29] teacher should be in you not just in the
[1:13:31] pull pit that'll say well he didn't say
[1:13:34] exactly this he do need to say exactly
[1:13:37] this amen there's a teacher inside of
[1:13:38] you that'll say I'm
[1:13:41] guilty he didn't say my name and he
[1:13:44] didn't say the exact circumstance but
[1:13:46] all of a sudden I have a witness that I
[1:13:47] need to make that thing right I need to
[1:13:49] get rid of this I need to expose this in
[1:13:51] my
[1:13:52] life amen
[1:13:56] man the danger is if we
[1:13:59] don't and we have another service next
[1:14:01] week and it's a good service and you're
[1:14:07] blessed somebody asked you to pray for
[1:14:09] them and you pray for them and they get
[1:14:15] healed that's dangerous
[1:14:17] friends that's
[1:14:20] scary I don't want to be in that
[1:14:23] spot say God help me I don't want to be
[1:14:26] like Demus I don't want to wind up like
[1:14:28] Demus I don't want to wind up like
[1:14:31] Judas I want to be like the little woman
[1:14:34] she knew what she was but she had to
[1:14:36] give it all to him
[1:14:38] anyways and he blessed her and changed
[1:14:40] her
[1:14:43] life Judas couldn't give up or Deus I'm
[1:14:47] saying couldn't give up popularity Deus
[1:14:49] couldn't give up Prestige and and
[1:14:52] deus's the problem with Deus was was not
[1:14:55] Paul losing his ministry and not Paul
[1:14:58] failing in his ministry the problem with
[1:15:00] Deus is deus's
[1:15:03] pride he couldn't suffer himself as long
[1:15:06] as the meetings were good and as long as
[1:15:08] they were casting out devils and as long
[1:15:10] as Paul was popular Deus was
[1:15:13] there so the problem wasn't Paul the
[1:15:16] problem was with
[1:15:18] Deus and Deus had to go to preserve
[1:15:21] deus's reputation so they could Preserve
[1:15:24] deus's uh
[1:15:26] promotion but I want to look at the
[1:15:28] attitude of Paul now if we can go to
[1:15:29] Acts chapter 21
[1:15:38] together Acts chapter
[1:15:49] 21 Acts 21:10
[1:15:55] and as we Terri there many days there
[1:15:57] come down from Judea a certain Prophet
[1:15:59] named agabus and when he was come unto
[1:16:01] us he took Paul's girdle and bound his
[1:16:03] own hands and feet and said thus sayith
[1:16:05] the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at
[1:16:07] Jerusalem bind the man that onth this
[1:16:09] girdle and shall deliver him into the
[1:16:11] hands of
[1:16:13] Gentiles and when we heard these things
[1:16:16] this is uh Luke is writing the this book
[1:16:18] of Acts when we heard these things Luke
[1:16:21] and the other
[1:16:22] Brethren both we and they of that place
[1:16:25] sought him not to go up to
[1:16:27] Jerusalem then Paul answered what mean
[1:16:30] ye to weep and to break Mine Heart for
[1:16:32] I'm ready to go I am ready not to be
[1:16:35] bound only but also to die at Jerusalem
[1:16:37] for the name of the Lord
[1:16:39] Jesus I love this because I to me I see
[1:16:43] the way God works it it starts to stand
[1:16:45] out to me that agabus a prophet comes
[1:16:49] down and he begins to prophesy that
[1:16:51] there's Terrible Things heading for you
[1:16:53] uh uh Paul there's some danger coming
[1:16:55] your way and and and he gives the
[1:16:57] prophecy of it and then and then now uh
[1:17:00] everybody that's there everybody that's
[1:17:02] where they're visiting and everybody
[1:17:03] that's traveling with Paul all Paul's
[1:17:05] Close Associates and all the church he's
[1:17:07] visiting they all agreed together don't
[1:17:09] go to
[1:17:11] Jerusalem and just think of the
[1:17:13] temptation of this it wasn't it wasn't
[1:17:15] that somebody just said don't go to
[1:17:17] Jerusalem there was a holy ghost
[1:17:19] operated gift that come and said if you
[1:17:22] go to Jerusalem this danger is fallowing
[1:17:24] you the Holy Ghost spoke through agabus
[1:17:27] and demonstrated was trouble then all
[1:17:28] the Holy Ghost filled Brethren are
[1:17:31] saying now don't go to Jerusalem but
[1:17:33] there's Paul who's also a holy ghost
[1:17:36] filled Brethren that say why do you make
[1:17:38] me weep and why do you break my heart
[1:17:39] with your weeping I'm ready to give my
[1:17:41] life I'm ready to die I'm ready to give
[1:17:43] everything up yeah amen amen let's look
[1:17:47] at another scripture here
[1:17:51] um where's this other one
[1:17:55] uh verse 22 yeah let's go down to verse
[1:18:02] 22 what is it therefore the multitude
[1:18:05] must needs come together for they will
[1:18:06] hear that thou art come do therefore
[1:18:09] this that well where am I at what in the
[1:18:11] world am I doing I'm in the wrong
[1:18:13] chapter chapter 20 verse
[1:18:16] 22 chapter 20 verse
[1:18:20] 22 and now behold I go Bound in the
[1:18:24] spirit unto Jerusalem what was moving
[1:18:28] Paul it was the spirit of God moving him
[1:18:30] to Jerusalem he said I go Bound in the
[1:18:32] spirit he knew what God was leading him
[1:18:34] to do he knew what God was asking of him
[1:18:37] I go Bound in the spirit into Jerusalem
[1:18:38] not knowing the things that shall Beil
[1:18:40] befall me there save that the Holy Ghost
[1:18:43] witnessed in every city saying bonds and
[1:18:46] affliction abide me but none of these
[1:18:48] things move me neither count I my life
[1:18:50] dear unto myself so that I might finish
[1:18:53] my course with joy and the Ministry
[1:18:55] which I have received of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:56] to testify the gospel of the grace of
[1:19:00] Jesus read verse uh grace of God verse
[1:19:04] 25 and now and now behold I know that
[1:19:07] you all I I know that you all among whom
[1:19:10] I have gone preaching the kingdom of God
[1:19:12] shall see my face no
[1:19:15] more this is what he says in chapter 20
[1:19:18] chapter 21 agabus comes and confirms
[1:19:20] everything yet in another city and he
[1:19:22] says the Holy Ghost spoke in every city
[1:19:24] that bonds and affliction abide me there
[1:19:27] and he says but but that doesn't move me
[1:19:29] none of these things move me none of
[1:19:30] these things change me CU I'm Bound in
[1:19:32] spirit amen and and you think this is
[1:19:35] this is the thing that just amazes me
[1:19:37] you think God moved an inspiration upon
[1:19:40] Paul's heart and Paul is now willing to
[1:19:42] give up everything and go to Jerusalem
[1:19:43] and he's Bound in the spirit to head to
[1:19:45] Jerusalem amen but God allows gifts to
[1:19:49] operate in the church that would begin
[1:19:51] to tell Paul hey if you go to Jerusalem
[1:19:54] back bad things are going to happen to
[1:19:58] you then he goes to another city if you
[1:20:01] go to Jerusalem bad things are going to
[1:20:02] happen to you and he's not telling
[1:20:04] anybody what's in his heart amen God had
[1:20:06] spoke to him but everywhere he goes the
[1:20:09] Holy Ghost speaking through the gifts in
[1:20:11] the church says Paul if you go to
[1:20:13] Jerusalem bad things are going to happen
[1:20:14] to you next city Paul if you go to
[1:20:16] Jerusalem bad things are going to happen
[1:20:18] to you the next city Paul if you go to
[1:20:20] Jerusalem bad things are going to happen
[1:20:21] to you and now they come to this city
[1:20:23] and agabus stands up takes his girdle
[1:20:25] binds his hands and said so will it be
[1:20:27] to the man that owns this girdle amen
[1:20:30] when he goes to Jerusalem and now all
[1:20:32] everybody in that church and everybody
[1:20:34] traveling including Luke amen starts to
[1:20:36] say don't go Paul don't
[1:20:41] go I look at this and I say why does God
[1:20:44] do
[1:20:45] this what if that was you people under
[1:20:49] discernment that don't know people begin
[1:20:51] to prophesy and say if you go amen God
[1:20:54] loves loves to test his children God
[1:20:56] knows what he put inside God's willing
[1:20:58] to pour concrete himself on top of
[1:21:03] it I don't know about you but if that
[1:21:05] was me I start thinking well maybe I
[1:21:07] shouldn't go to Jerusalem I mean maybe
[1:21:09] God's trying to speak to
[1:21:12] me and then all the people you trust
[1:21:14] start to persuade
[1:21:16] you may Paul don't don't do it Paul Hey
[1:21:20] listen you got a minist no who knows
[1:21:22] what kind of uh uh excuses they gave or
[1:21:24] what kind of persuasion they use Paul
[1:21:26] listen you still got your ministry that
[1:21:28] not everybody's heard the gospel yet
[1:21:30] they're still Gentile remember that
[1:21:31] invitation from that
[1:21:34] church surely God doesn't want to take
[1:21:36] you off the scene
[1:21:40] now Paul said I already know in my
[1:21:43] heart I'm Bound in the
[1:21:45] spirit to
[1:21:47] Jerusalem in fact none of these things
[1:21:50] move me cuz I count not my life dear to
[1:21:53] myself because I broke the alabaster box
[1:21:56] long ago and I poured it out I'm not
[1:21:59] here to save
[1:22:00] myself it was the Holy Ghost that led
[1:22:03] him to Jerusalem and it was the Holy
[1:22:04] Ghost that kept warning him about
[1:22:08] Jerusalem what's God trying to
[1:22:14] do I think God's allowing the life in
[1:22:17] Paul to shine
[1:22:20] forth
[1:22:22] amen it's amazing how
[1:22:26] different things are the way we think
[1:22:30] they should be
[1:22:33] yeah I wouldn't have done it that way I
[1:22:36] would have used the Holy Ghost gifts and
[1:22:38] I would have used the prophet to say
[1:22:39] this is what's going to happen Paul but
[1:22:41] that's okay you go on ahead I'm with you
[1:22:44] but nobody said that right nobody said
[1:22:49] that they just said you're going to be
[1:22:51] in trouble and then that's what the
[1:22:53] spirit said you're going to be in
[1:22:54] trouble then everybody else tried to
[1:22:56] persuade him not to
[1:22:58] go you want to talk about a
[1:23:00] Temptation what if that was
[1:23:04] you man is he going to follow the
[1:23:06] leading of the Lord or is he
[1:23:08] going but yet what about all the
[1:23:11] Brethren do they not have the leading of
[1:23:12] the
[1:23:13] Lord what about every church that
[1:23:16] confesses the same thing isn't this the
[1:23:18] mouth of two or three
[1:23:20] Witnesses you talking about mind battles
[1:23:23] friend this is where you get mind
[1:23:28] battles but we have to serve God from a
[1:23:31] pure
[1:23:34] heart Paul if Paul wanted to save
[1:23:38] himself he had all the justification in
[1:23:41] the world he needed right
[1:23:43] there I mean I could imagine if you had
[1:23:45] a little bit of self-preservation still
[1:23:47] buried in there and and you had a little
[1:23:49] bit of Pride that thought you still God
[1:23:51] couldn't take you because he still needs
[1:23:53] me to preach God doesn't need us to do
[1:23:58] nothing God doesn't need me to pastor
[1:24:01] this church he can get anybody else to
[1:24:03] do it he doesn't need me to preach the
[1:24:06] gospel there there's droves of people
[1:24:08] that can preach the gospel and he can
[1:24:09] supply a super duper anointing to the
[1:24:11] smallest of smallest and make him the
[1:24:14] best preacher in the
[1:24:15] world he doesn't need
[1:24:19] me he doesn't need your pretty voice to
[1:24:22] sing a song
[1:24:25] understand if Paul start think well he
[1:24:26] still needs me I can't go
[1:24:30] yet what do you mean he still needs you
[1:24:35] right when God was done with Peter Peter
[1:24:38] died on a cross yeah Peter couldn't say
[1:24:42] well you still need me I have the
[1:24:46] keys this is where we get in trouble
[1:24:49] thinking he still needs me I can do I
[1:24:53] there's nobody
[1:24:55] there's nobody that can do this the way
[1:24:56] I can do
[1:24:57] it well you know what that's true for
[1:24:59] Peter nobody could do it like he could
[1:25:00] do it and for Paul nobody could do it
[1:25:02] like he could do it and the same thing
[1:25:04] for brother Bram there ain't a soul who
[1:25:05] could do it like he could do
[1:25:07] it but God took him out in a car
[1:25:10] wreck on his way for Christmas back in
[1:25:14] Jeffersonville and he wanted to preach a
[1:25:16] message called trail of certain couldn't
[1:25:17] wait to get home to preach
[1:25:19] it and God would take him like
[1:25:23] that you know how many people thought
[1:25:25] that because God took him that way that
[1:25:27] that God was done done with his ministry
[1:25:29] and it was a Vindication that he was
[1:25:30] getting
[1:25:34] off was Peter getting off was Paul
[1:25:38] getting
[1:25:41] off if Peter if Paul wanted to save
[1:25:45] himself the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost gave him all the chances he needed
[1:25:57] so it is God who will give a holy ghost
[1:26:00] Ministry to false Brethren and let them
[1:26:02] preach the gospel tell the truth lay
[1:26:05] hands on the sick have discernment and
[1:26:07] and and sell out Jesus Christ to the
[1:26:10] Romans God chose him and he was given to
[1:26:13] Jesus of the
[1:26:17] father then the same God who who tells
[1:26:21] Paul to go to Jerusalem the same God
[1:26:23] will say we warn him in every city you
[1:26:26] know if you go to Jerusalem it's going
[1:26:27] to be bad you know if he's going to go
[1:26:28] to Jerusalem and then all the Brethren
[1:26:30] that love him try to get him not to go
[1:26:31] to Jerusalem I tell you we don't think
[1:26:33] God will act this way God will act
[1:26:35] exactly this way because he has no fear
[1:26:37] about the life that's on the inside of
[1:26:39] the sea he knows that's his own life and
[1:26:41] it'll manifest the word amen if it
[1:26:43] doesn't do it day one it'll do it it's
[1:26:45] going to manifest the
[1:26:50] word he also knows that everything's
[1:26:52] that's not the SE
[1:26:55] seed has to Fall
[1:26:58] Away has
[1:27:01] to let's look at Acts chapter 20 while
[1:27:04] we're
[1:27:06] here and I want to look at verse
[1:27:13] 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:27:15] and to all the flock he had just told
[1:27:17] them that I'm not going to see your face
[1:27:19] anymore I want you to understand the
[1:27:21] context of this take heed therefore
[1:27:24] yourselves into all the flock over which
[1:27:26] the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers
[1:27:28] now I stop right there quit reading
[1:27:33] look he's speaking to his fellow
[1:27:38] ministers that he's worked with some of
[1:27:41] them he's ordained no doubt and put them
[1:27:43] in position as Elders he's traveled from
[1:27:46] City to City preaching in their churches
[1:27:48] having meetings Fellowship many of them
[1:27:50] gathered together at Ephesus to talk to
[1:27:52] him and and he says you're the ones the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost has made overseers of the
[1:27:59] flock but look what he says next to feed
[1:28:03] the Church of God which he hath
[1:28:05] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:28:07] this that after my departing shall
[1:28:08] Grievous wolves enter in among you not
[1:28:11] sparing the flock also of your own
[1:28:15] selves shall men arise speaking perverse
[1:28:19] things to draw away disciples after them
[1:28:24] Paul just said to every one of
[1:28:27] them you're the overseers the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] has played over the to feed the flock
[1:28:32] the Holy Ghost has put each one of you
[1:28:35] in position but I know that among some
[1:28:38] of you are going to raise up false
[1:28:41] Brethren with wrong motives to lead away
[1:28:45] some of the
[1:28:50] flock if I had been sitting there that
[1:28:52] day I don't know what I would have
[1:28:53] thought have probably been in
[1:28:55] shock these are Paul's friends the
[1:28:58] ministers he worked with the ones maybe
[1:29:01] he put in position or
[1:29:06] recommended if I were there I'd be like
[1:29:09] Paul tell me which
[1:29:15] ones so that I can be
[1:29:18] careful you know what Paul didn't do he
[1:29:21] didn't tell them which ones yeah he just
[1:29:24] told them they were there and it was
[1:29:26] going to happen
[1:29:29] y but that can't happen in the
[1:29:34] message this was the
[1:29:42] message Paul knew it was going to happen
[1:29:44] he prophesied it was going to
[1:29:46] happen Paul knew they were
[1:29:52] there Paul can't you tell us warn us
[1:29:55] don't leave us like this Paul how can
[1:29:57] you leave us like this how can you say
[1:29:59] something like that and not tell us who
[1:30:00] how can you say that and walk away and
[1:30:02] leave
[1:30:06] us maybe Paul had more faith in God than
[1:30:10] we
[1:30:11] do maybe Paul had more faith in the C
[1:30:14] Gene of God and the power of the word of
[1:30:16] God to bring the sea to life than many
[1:30:18] of us
[1:30:20] do cuz we think we've got to make it
[1:30:23] easy we don't have to make easy amen we
[1:30:25] think that we got a baby and pet and we
[1:30:28] don't God never has right he never
[1:30:34] did the seed comes through and God knows
[1:30:38] how to bring the seed
[1:30:41] through the shepherd wouldn't lead his
[1:30:43] sheep through danger oh yes he
[1:30:46] does he just doesn't leave
[1:30:49] them he leads them right into the valley
[1:30:53] of The Shadow of death but he doesn't
[1:30:55] leave
[1:30:58] them God wouldn't take us through
[1:31:01] separation he wouldn't take us through
[1:31:02] that he wouldn't let that happen to my
[1:31:04] house he wouldn't let that happen to my
[1:31:06] home he wouldn't let that happen in my
[1:31:09] church are you
[1:31:12] sure well it would be obvious he would
[1:31:14] explain
[1:31:17] it yeah somewhere among
[1:31:22] you false brother is going to rise up
[1:31:26] and by the way I got to go and you're
[1:31:27] never going to see me
[1:31:29] again Jesus turns to the 12 and one of
[1:31:32] you is a
[1:31:35] devil everything will manifest
[1:31:39] itself don't have to figure it out you
[1:31:41] don't have to know ahead of time God
[1:31:43] knows how to create the circumstance
[1:31:45] where every seed begins to manifest
[1:31:47] what's inside that seed
[1:32:01] let's turn to the book of
[1:32:07] Jude honestly friends I have no idea why
[1:32:10] I'm preaching these
[1:32:12] things but I'm going to keep preaching
[1:32:22] them Jude chapter
[1:32:27] 1 Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all
[1:32:30] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:32:32] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:32:34] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:32:36] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:32:38] faith which was once delivered unto the
[1:32:39] Saints for there are certain men crept
[1:32:42] in unawares who were before of old
[1:32:44] ordained to this
[1:32:47] combination where did they creep in into
[1:32:50] the
[1:32:52] church and they were ordained to do
[1:32:57] so ungodly men turning the grace of our
[1:33:00] God into lasciviousness and denying the
[1:33:02] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ verse eight likewise also these
[1:33:09] filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise
[1:33:12] dominion and speak evil of dignities Yet
[1:33:15] Michael the Archangel when contending
[1:33:16] with the devil he disputed about the
[1:33:19] body of Moses D not bring him bring
[1:33:21] against him a railing accusation but
[1:33:23] said the Lord rebuke thee but these
[1:33:25] speak evil of those things which they
[1:33:26] know not but what they know naturally as
[1:33:29] brute beast and those things they
[1:33:30] corrupt themselves woe unto them for
[1:33:32] they have gone in the way of Cain they
[1:33:34] ran greedily after the heir of balam for
[1:33:37] reward and perished in the gain sayings
[1:33:38] of
[1:33:40] core these are spots in your Feast of
[1:33:43] Charity when they Feast with
[1:33:46] you feeding themselves without fear
[1:33:49] clouds they are without water carried
[1:33:51] about with the winds trees whose fruit
[1:33:52] withereth without fruit twice dead
[1:33:55] plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of
[1:33:56] the sea foaming out their own shame
[1:33:58] wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[1:34:00] Blackness of Darkness
[1:34:03] forever when he reads through the
[1:34:04] description of these brothers they sound
[1:34:08] horrible do you agree they sound
[1:34:11] horrible where are these brothers in the
[1:34:14] church where are they they're in your
[1:34:17] love Feast they're in your meetings yeah
[1:34:20] they're taking communion with you y
[1:34:27] having their conscience seared they can
[1:34:29] violate the word of God and stand and
[1:34:31] take communion they can raise their
[1:34:33] hands and sing songs and and know that
[1:34:36] that know know absolutely that we
[1:34:39] weren't taught to do it this way brother
[1:34:41] B said something different but I've got
[1:34:42] my own idea about it but I'll stand here
[1:34:44] and worship and feel
[1:34:45] good I'll come down and take communion I
[1:34:48] know I've got a hidden sin in my life
[1:34:49] that I haven't exposed I just whispered
[1:34:52] a prayer to God and said God please
[1:34:53] forgive me of that but I never exposed
[1:34:55] it to the one I sinned against I never
[1:34:57] made it
[1:35:03] right conscience seared yes with a hot
[1:35:08] iron these things this list when I when
[1:35:11] I I I've read this so many times I've
[1:35:13] read this the majority of my life I've
[1:35:16] known the scripture was here and read
[1:35:17] through it multiple times in my lifetime
[1:35:20] but it then began to strike me that he's
[1:35:22] not talking about horrible people that
[1:35:24] are attacking the church he's talking
[1:35:26] about horrible people that are in the
[1:35:29] church partaking of the events in the
[1:35:32] church uh worshiping with the church
[1:35:35] involved in the things of the
[1:35:39] church surely God would not do
[1:35:46] that and you realize this is the very
[1:35:49] justification people have for not going
[1:35:50] to
[1:35:52] church there's Hypocrites in the church
[1:35:54] there's false Believers there's people
[1:35:56] who do this and they say one thing they
[1:35:57] do something else and that's their
[1:35:59] justification for not being in the
[1:36:03] church I don't see where Paul makes it a
[1:36:05] justification or
[1:36:09] Jude in
[1:36:12] fact the question is should we expect it
[1:36:15] to go
[1:36:17] away should we expect it to not be among
[1:36:20] us should we expect there then be no
[1:36:22] more false Brethren is that what we
[1:36:25] should
[1:36:28] expect well I don't know maybe we should
[1:36:31] look closer with the
[1:36:33] scriptures if Jesus had it in his church
[1:36:36] and Paul had it in his church and
[1:36:38] brother brandham had it in his
[1:36:42] church we've come to such a level in our
[1:36:45] spiritual discernment and our ability to
[1:36:47] know everything that it's not going to
[1:36:48] be in our church
[1:36:53] question is how do I card against
[1:36:56] it all I know is to be
[1:36:59] honest not hide I'm not going to hide
[1:37:03] anything say God help me not to hide
[1:37:06] help me not to just gloss over help me
[1:37:08] not to sweep under the
[1:37:10] rug because I don't want my conscience
[1:37:12] seared I don't want I don't want
[1:37:15] backbiting and bitterness and hatred and
[1:37:17] I don't want these sins the foxes that
[1:37:19] spoil the vine the things I look at and
[1:37:21] the places I go the things I do in
[1:37:23] secret I don't want those things to sear
[1:37:25] my conscience where I can go on Saturday
[1:37:28] and do something and come on Sunday and
[1:37:29] say praise the Lord and feel a presence
[1:37:31] and feel like I'm okay cuz I felt a
[1:37:34] presence God help us not to go down that
[1:37:37] path that's a dangerous path to go down
[1:37:39] friends but we've got to be real with
[1:37:40] what's going on inside of our heart and
[1:37:42] say God I failed you I failed you you
[1:37:45] got to help me I can't go on I don't
[1:37:47] want to be like this I'm not going to be
[1:37:49] a hypocrite amen I may be the biggest
[1:37:51] fool in the church I may expose myself
[1:37:53] over and over but I'm not going to be a
[1:37:56] hypocrite amen I I want to get to the
[1:37:59] place where I can do all the Christian
[1:38:02] things but in my heart's in
[1:38:04] turmoil and every time an evangelist
[1:38:06] comes over and he starts going down the
[1:38:08] line and nailing these things and then
[1:38:09] and these things and when he skips over
[1:38:11] the thing I'm dealing with all of a
[1:38:12] sudden I feel a little bit of relief
[1:38:14] where I was all tensed up amen don't
[1:38:16] feel relief amen get relief at the altar
[1:38:18] get relief at exposing your sin get
[1:38:21] relief not because it wasn't mentioned
[1:38:22] and it wasn't preached again find relief
[1:38:25] in
[1:38:25] Repentance find relief in exposing your
[1:38:28] sin find relief in opening the door and
[1:38:30] giving the devil no Hiding Place not
[1:38:33] being grateful he didn't touch that or
[1:38:35] he didn't touch this or he didn't get
[1:38:36] hard on
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:40] that God help us to be real genuine help
[1:38:47] us to tell the truth to God and to
[1:38:51] ourselves Judas knew knew he stole from
[1:38:55] Jesus and he kept in the
[1:39:05] ministry Deus
[1:39:07] knew he couldn't go along with
[1:39:10] Paul because it was costing him too
[1:39:13] much so he made it Paul's
[1:39:17] fault not the wickedness of his own
[1:39:19] pride of his heart
[1:39:24] God help us not to hide
[1:39:29] sin Jesus says to the Pharisees in
[1:39:32] Matthew 23 he says woe unto you scribes
[1:39:34] and Pharisees
[1:39:35] Hypocrites if you are like unto Whited
[1:39:38] sepers which indeed appear beautiful
[1:39:40] outward but are within full of dead
[1:39:41] men's bones and of all
[1:39:43] uncleanness even so you also outwardly
[1:39:46] appear righteous unto men but within you
[1:39:48] are full of
[1:39:49] hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:39:55] there's a couple examples and stories
[1:39:58] that are through the Bible through the
[1:40:02] message I'm just going to reference them
[1:40:04] as we wind
[1:40:06] down in Mark 12 Jesus begins to show his
[1:40:10] disciples an example and the example is
[1:40:13] the widow woman who gives two mites into
[1:40:15] the
[1:40:17] treasury she's contrasted by the
[1:40:19] Pharisee who blows a trumpet
[1:40:23] and draws
[1:40:24] attention and has pump and ceremony and
[1:40:28] goes in and he has a lot of money and he
[1:40:30] and he goes and he takes a lot of money
[1:40:32] and he and he drops it in the treasury
[1:40:35] and no doubt you know what he probably
[1:40:37] doesn't do is he probably doesn't take
[1:40:39] the bag and set it down in quietly he
[1:40:41] probably like shakes it so all the coins
[1:40:43] start rattling so you can hear how much
[1:40:44] is falling
[1:40:48] in that man was not giving to God
[1:40:53] that man was giving to
[1:40:55] himself to build or preserve his
[1:40:58] reputation in front of the
[1:41:01] people he can say well I gave that money
[1:41:03] to God and technically he gave the money
[1:41:05] to God cuz it's no longer in his pocket
[1:41:08] but he gave it in a way that he would
[1:41:09] get something in
[1:41:12] return and that was the look good in the
[1:41:15] eyes of the people but his heart was
[1:41:17] corrupt it was Pride on the inside that
[1:41:20] caused him to do it that
[1:41:21] way then we had a little widow woman who
[1:41:24] all she had was two mites and she didn't
[1:41:26] blow a trumpet there was no Fanfare I
[1:41:28] don't know how many people noticed or
[1:41:29] didn't notice but she slid in and she
[1:41:31] dropped those two minds probably
[1:41:33] silently into the
[1:41:36] treasury but Jesus noticed and Jesus
[1:41:39] Drew attention to it and Jesus says this
[1:41:41] woman gave more than everyone else who
[1:41:45] put in the offering plate
[1:41:48] today you know why because she gave all
[1:41:51] she had
[1:41:54] it didn't matter the
[1:41:56] quantity it wasn't the quantity it was
[1:41:59] the ratio
[1:42:03] yeah I don't know how much that Pharisee
[1:42:06] that might have been 10% of his monthly
[1:42:09] earnings maybe a little more maybe he
[1:42:11] gave
[1:42:12] 20 it's probably a large sum of money
[1:42:16] but in proportion it wasn't a tremendous
[1:42:19] sacrifice but this little woman when she
[1:42:22] gave that money she didn't give that
[1:42:24] money for herself she gave it to God no
[1:42:27] Fanfare no recognition nobody noticed
[1:42:30] and she didn't get praise accolades or
[1:42:33] even
[1:42:34] respect because of what she did but
[1:42:37] Jesus noticed so he begins the contrast
[1:42:40] and show us the contrast between a pure
[1:42:43] heart and a Pharisees
[1:42:46] heart the pure heart was willing to give
[1:42:50] all she
[1:42:51] had Simon would have Jesus to him house
[1:42:55] Simon would even feed him good
[1:42:58] food but it was The Prostitute who gave
[1:43:02] everything
[1:43:06] yes Judas would give his time and his
[1:43:09] money he would give give up whatever it
[1:43:12] was that he was doing to go into the
[1:43:16] ministry at the end of the day he
[1:43:18] wouldn't give
[1:43:20] all he set kept something back for for
[1:43:28] himself brother bham says in the message
[1:43:30] leadership he said but I remember a
[1:43:32] little story I want you to know one day
[1:43:34] there was a widow woman she had a bunch
[1:43:36] of children perhaps them little
[1:43:38] children's Papa was gone and she only
[1:43:40] had two pennies and she come down the
[1:43:42] street and was tithing money just
[1:43:44] pennies like you all saved and threw it
[1:43:46] into the treasury of God Jesus was
[1:43:48] standing there watching her and I
[1:43:49] wondered what would I have done if I had
[1:43:51] been standing there I'd probably run up
[1:43:53] and said no sister no don't do that we
[1:43:56] don't really we really don't need
[1:44:00] it you need it for them children now I
[1:44:03] wouldn't have let her I wouldn't have
[1:44:05] let her done it but Jesus let her do
[1:44:09] it see he let her do it why he knows
[1:44:12] it's more blessed to give than it is to
[1:44:14] receive he knowed what he would do for
[1:44:16] her see
[1:44:23] I wouldn't let
[1:44:24] people I wouldn't let people get stuck
[1:44:27] in a church with false Ministry and I
[1:44:28] wouldn't let them get mistreated by
[1:44:30] ministers I wouldn't let them get abused
[1:44:32] by parents I wouldn't let anybody do
[1:44:34] that I wouldn't let false Brethren take
[1:44:37] people in the message of wrong I
[1:44:38] wouldn't do that if I was in
[1:44:42] charge because I don't want them to
[1:44:45] suffer I don't want them I don't want
[1:44:47] him to lose out I don't want him to
[1:44:50] hurt just like Jesus wouldn't let the
[1:44:52] little woman give all her money cuz he
[1:44:54] didn't want those children to suffer he
[1:44:55] didn't want her to hurt but Jesus let
[1:44:58] her do
[1:45:00] it because he knew what he would do for
[1:45:02] her in
[1:45:05] return Jesus lets us go through some
[1:45:08] things some hard things some terrible
[1:45:11] things but he knows what he's going to
[1:45:14] do in return he knows what it's going to
[1:45:16] mean at the end of the road he knows
[1:45:18] what the reward
[1:45:19] is and he's looking for the heart that
[1:45:22] loves him
[1:45:23] more than anything
[1:45:27] else brother M said
[1:45:30] oh we who give one little prayer a day
[1:45:33] 10 cents oh goodness this is a rare and
[1:45:36] special occasion when we meet Jesus he
[1:45:38] just don't want you to be a member of a
[1:45:40] church he wants the best you
[1:45:43] got he wants
[1:45:45] you not lip service not religious Duty
[1:45:49] he just wants all of you
[1:45:53] amen he gave us all of him so he can
[1:45:55] have all of
[1:45:57] us brother bam starts talking about
[1:46:00] sister Hatty right and he says what
[1:46:02] would she have asked what would she
[1:46:04] asked for the healing of her sister what
[1:46:06] if she had asked the little girl would
[1:46:07] have been healed but her two boys lost
[1:46:09] what if that poor Widow who had just
[1:46:11] told me that she tried to give to this
[1:46:13] church $50 on a pledge to help build a
[1:46:16] new church and brother Roberson wouldn't
[1:46:18] take it would only let her give 20 of it
[1:46:21] here's this woman brother man begins to
[1:46:22] talk talk about she barely made she only
[1:46:24] made I think a couple hundred dollar a
[1:46:25] year in income she was a widow she was
[1:46:28] scratching out a living on an old
[1:46:29] hillside farm anden she was in poverty
[1:46:31] and only had a little bit of money and
[1:46:33] she had made a pledge Amen to brother
[1:46:35] Roberson in the church that she was
[1:46:37] going to give $50 to the building of the
[1:46:39] new
[1:46:41] church but brother Roberson wouldn't let
[1:46:43] her do it so he told her only
[1:46:45] 20 and she had given the 20 and brother
[1:46:48] brandham had a 20 and he was going to
[1:46:50] give her $20 back that's what is in his
[1:46:53] mind and that was what his intention to
[1:46:55] not let her sacrifice and not let her
[1:46:57] give because she can't do it others can
[1:46:59] give but she can't she can't give all
[1:47:01] she can't she can't suffer we can't let
[1:47:04] her
[1:47:12] suffer see that's how we think that's
[1:47:16] how the prophet was thinking that's not
[1:47:19] that's not that you know that's not
[1:47:21] abnormal that's what the prophet was
[1:47:23] thinking yes but God was thinking
[1:47:27] different he said then he said I said to
[1:47:30] myself when she's speaking I will give
[1:47:33] her back the
[1:47:35] 20 but God said to me in my heart now
[1:47:38] not by Vision in my heart when Jesus was
[1:47:40] standing watching the Widow put the
[1:47:42] three pennies there there was thousands
[1:47:43] of dollars laying what would you have
[1:47:45] done I said well if I'd been standing
[1:47:48] around I said we don't need it sister we
[1:47:51] got plenty of money but Jesus never said
[1:47:53] it he let her go on and do it because he
[1:47:55] know that was down the road so help me
[1:47:58] God is my solemn judge God knew that
[1:48:01] what God knew that was down the road for
[1:48:07] her what was down the road for Hatty
[1:48:10] rright the salvation of her two
[1:48:15] boys God is never unfair unloving unjust
[1:48:19] in any way
[1:48:21] whatsoever in human perspective we see
[1:48:23] the events in people's lives and we see
[1:48:26] how could God let them lose a child how
[1:48:29] could God let her be a young Widow how
[1:48:31] could
[1:48:34] God we just don't see like God
[1:48:39] sees how could we take $20 from poor
[1:48:42] Hatty Wright for the building of the
[1:48:43] church we got we got plenty of people
[1:48:45] that'll donate I we can't let this
[1:48:49] happen God was willing to take it yeah
[1:48:52] God was happy to take it
[1:48:56] yeah that's why God doesn't ask me I
[1:48:59] would never let you be sick if he asked
[1:49:00] me I would never let your husband or
[1:49:02] your wife die I would never let your
[1:49:04] child go go Wayward I would never let
[1:49:06] any of that happen because I couldn't
[1:49:07] stand to see you
[1:49:10] suffer but God's got a broader Vision
[1:49:13] than we have he sees more than we see
[1:49:16] and everything he does is perfect
[1:49:19] perfect perfect perfect
[1:49:25] he
[1:49:27] says and I had and after he's thinking
[1:49:30] this God knew that was down the road for
[1:49:32] her and I had run my hand in my pocket
[1:49:35] to get my pocketbook to get her $20 back
[1:49:38] and say sister Hattie but he said don't
[1:49:41] do it brother B already had his money on
[1:49:43] his wallet or his hand on his wallet but
[1:49:46] he said don't do it then in a few
[1:49:48] minutes when the question was brought up
[1:49:49] about Jehovah D she said that's nothing
[1:49:51] but the truth and it come from a poor
[1:49:54] widow's heart God knowing she had asked
[1:49:56] the greatest thing could be done and
[1:49:57] brother bam said the angel of the Lord
[1:49:59] said stand to your feet give her
[1:50:01] whatever she asked
[1:50:03] for listen you may think you've suffered
[1:50:05] but your suffering is nothing compared
[1:50:07] to the Glorious reward that lays ahead
[1:50:10] you may think it was unfair and not
[1:50:11] right and shouldn't happened to this
[1:50:13] church shouldn't happened to the message
[1:50:14] shouldn't happened in my family amen
[1:50:16] when you get on that side you're never
[1:50:18] going to say it shouldn't have happened
[1:50:19] you'll not one time say it was too much
[1:50:22] I had to give too much I had to do too
[1:50:24] much I had to sacrifice too much that'll
[1:50:26] never be language that comes out of our
[1:50:28] mouth when we get out of these bodies
[1:50:29] and out of this Consciousness and we can
[1:50:31] see clearly from the other side we'll
[1:50:33] say I didn't give enough I should have
[1:50:35] given more I'm sorry I complained I I
[1:50:37] feel bad that I doubted God I'm so
[1:50:39] ashamed of myself that I didn't
[1:50:41] understand that he's perfect in every
[1:50:42] way and all of these things are working
[1:50:44] together for his glory and my
[1:50:49] good nobody's going to say Lord it was
[1:50:51] too much you asked of me
[1:50:57] Jesus who let the woman put all her
[1:50:59] living in the
[1:51:02] treasury is the same Jesus who Let The
[1:51:05] Prostitute give everything she had saved
[1:51:09] for to save her life and spill it all on
[1:51:12] his feet and on the ground in a moment
[1:51:14] her life was
[1:51:16] gone Jesus let that
[1:51:19] happen it was also Jesus who let Judas
[1:51:23] steal and knew it was going on and
[1:51:24] didn't say a word about
[1:51:34] it see he'll let us do what we want to
[1:51:39] do to show what we
[1:51:44] are sometimes we deceive ourselves and
[1:51:46] thinking well if it's wrong then
[1:51:49] something bad will happen or because we
[1:51:52] don't say it that way but we we begin to
[1:51:54] justify our mind because judgment hasn't
[1:51:56] come and something bad hasn't happened
[1:51:58] then it must be
[1:51:59] okay but just because God lets you do
[1:52:02] what's in your heart doesn't mean that
[1:52:04] what you're doing is right and just
[1:52:06] because he doesn't call it out from the
[1:52:08] pull pit or somebody didn't have a dream
[1:52:10] or somebody pre doesn't preach on your
[1:52:11] exact issue doesn't mean that it's
[1:52:21] okay and just because everything in life
[1:52:23] goes
[1:52:24] wrong doesn't mean we're
[1:52:28] wrong just because God's requiring not
[1:52:31] even requiring he's giving me the
[1:52:33] opportunity to give more than anybody
[1:52:35] else gives doesn't mean it's
[1:52:38] wrong and others may tell me sister you
[1:52:42] don't have to give that much brother you
[1:52:43] don't have to God doesn't expect you you
[1:52:45] don't have to do that you don't have to
[1:52:47] go through that you don't have to endure
[1:52:48] that you don't have to just because
[1:52:50] everyone around me reassured me that God
[1:52:53] loves me and he doesn't want me to
[1:52:54] suffer and I don't have to go through
[1:52:55] this amen something in my heart says
[1:52:58] this is what I want to give to him in
[1:52:59] return for service I want to give my all
[1:53:02] not just a partial I want to give my all
[1:53:09] amen oh my
[1:53:14] goodness remember we talked
[1:53:18] about Rebecca and watering the camels
[1:53:21] she didn't have to
[1:53:23] too but she
[1:53:25] did and what she did was a Monumental
[1:53:28] task what she did was above and beyond
[1:53:29] what she did was more than I would have
[1:53:31] ever asked a maiden to do for
[1:53:33] me but remember Eleazar didn't ask her
[1:53:37] she
[1:53:38] volunteered she didn't have
[1:53:41] to Jesus never asked the woman with the
[1:53:44] alabaster box to spill on his feet she
[1:53:46] didn't have to Jesus never had asked the
[1:53:49] woman with two mites to put an offering
[1:53:50] she didn't have to Jesus never asked had
[1:53:53] he right to to pledge $50 she wanted
[1:53:57] to he never asked her to give the 20 she
[1:54:00] wanted
[1:54:04] to he'll take
[1:54:07] it the the the Rebecca who watered the
[1:54:12] camels she's trip after trip after trip
[1:54:14] after trip and Eleazar just lets her do
[1:54:19] it he just lets her do it why because
[1:54:22] she's expressing what's inside of her
[1:54:25] when she does another trip she's
[1:54:26] expressing when she does another trip
[1:54:28] she's expressing when she bears under
[1:54:30] the load when she keeps her word when
[1:54:31] she serves others amen she's expressing
[1:54:34] what she is and he just sits back and
[1:54:36] waits to see whether his journey is
[1:54:37] prosperous or not not saying okay sister
[1:54:41] that's enough you showed me enough
[1:54:42] that's okay I can see you're working up
[1:54:44] a sweat and you're a little bit out of
[1:54:45] breath I feel bad
[1:54:48] now no he let her do another 50 trips or
[1:54:52] however
[1:54:53] to express what was in her heart and
[1:54:56] when all the camels had done drinking
[1:54:59] then he rushed to her and gave her the
[1:55:01] gifts the the bracelets and the
[1:55:05] earring she didn't have to she wanted to
[1:55:09] the effort wasn't small it was great and
[1:55:12] he let her do
[1:55:15] it
[1:55:16] amen we talked about last time the drink
[1:55:20] of water David longed for and the three
[1:55:22] Mighty Men Who went and got it they
[1:55:24] didn't have to nobody asked them to
[1:55:27] nobody asked them nobody even suggested
[1:55:29] it they just knew David wanted it and if
[1:55:31] David their lord wanted it then that was
[1:55:33] in their heart to go give it and they
[1:55:34] were willing to sacrifice their lives
[1:55:36] and when they brought back the cup David
[1:55:37] said I I read to you out of 2 Samuel but
[1:55:40] when you read out of Chronicles it's
[1:55:42] even more striking he said can I drink
[1:55:44] the cup that is the blood yes of these
[1:55:47] men what was it what did they give David
[1:55:50] they gave David their lives they gave
[1:55:52] David their blood that's what he said
[1:55:54] you've this cup is their blood I can't
[1:55:56] drink this it's too sacred it's too holy
[1:55:58] because they gave their life to give me
[1:56:01] what I wanted amen showing that there's
[1:56:03] going to be some Mighty Warriors on this
[1:56:05] Earth that'll give their life just for
[1:56:07] what he wants not what I have to
[1:56:10] do see listen it's no more about getting
[1:56:13] to Heaven amen if all you want to do is
[1:56:16] go to heaven that's okay I mean God will
[1:56:18] take care of that and you could have a
[1:56:19] reward I want more than to go to heaven
[1:56:21] I want a love my maker I want to give
[1:56:23] him all I want to pour out the alabaster
[1:56:25] box I want to drop my two mites give my
[1:56:27] $20 water all his camels whatever it is
[1:56:30] that brings pleasure to him that's
[1:56:32] what's in my heart that I desperately
[1:56:34] want to
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:36] do it's not about being in the message
[1:56:39] you can be in the message and go to
[1:56:42] hell question is whether you are the
[1:56:46] message you can be a part of anything
[1:56:48] you want sit in a good church and dress
[1:56:50] right and have a nice family and and
[1:56:52] thank God for all the blessings and they
[1:56:53] true blessings and God blessed you you
[1:56:57] can feel the Holy Ghost anointing your
[1:56:58] life and it can be a true Holy Ghost
[1:56:59] anoint and you can thank God that
[1:57:01] there's gifts operating in your life and
[1:57:02] it can all be true but the question is
[1:57:04] not what has God done for you the
[1:57:06] question is have I given
[1:57:10] everything or if I'm still
[1:57:12] holding secret things in my
[1:57:19] heart Jesus said in Luke 17:10 so
[1:57:22] likewise ye when you shall have done all
[1:57:24] these things which are commanded you say
[1:57:27] we are unprofitable
[1:57:29] servants we have done that which was our
[1:57:32] duty to do remember a long time ago
[1:57:35] brother Bob Brooks pach a message on
[1:57:37] this and I can never forget it brother
[1:57:39] Bob when you've done everything that was
[1:57:41] commanded you to
[1:57:43] do you're yet an unprofitable servant
[1:57:47] cuz you only did what you had to do
[1:57:51] that's what Jesus is saying
[1:57:55] I don't want to do what I have to
[1:57:58] do I want to do what he
[1:58:06] wants remember when the Rich Young Ruler
[1:58:08] came to
[1:58:09] Jesus he asks Rabbi what must I do to
[1:58:13] inherit eternal life and he begins to
[1:58:15] tell him keep the Commandments and do
[1:58:17] these things he said I've done it all
[1:58:17] for my youth I've done what was required
[1:58:20] of me
[1:58:24] Jesus said if you want life Everlasting
[1:58:27] there's one thing you're lacking sell
[1:58:30] everything you
[1:58:31] have take up your cross follow
[1:58:35] me that man went away sad because he had
[1:58:39] great
[1:58:41] possessions question is what did he
[1:58:43] really want
[1:58:46] most he could make whatever Choice he
[1:58:48] wanted what he chose is what he wanted
[1:58:51] the most
[1:58:52] and that was his
[1:58:54] possessions he wanted his possessions
[1:58:56] and eternal
[1:58:59] life I I pray God helps me not to have
[1:59:02] my way and eternal life my wants and
[1:59:05] eternal life I just want eternal life
[1:59:08] because eternal life is a person it's
[1:59:11] Jesus Christ I want him
[1:59:24] Luke 19 let's turn there I'm going to
[1:59:26] wrap up with this thought Luke
[1:59:41] 19 Jesus gives the Rich Young Ruler an
[1:59:45] opportunity and the Rich Young Ruler
[1:59:48] walks
[1:59:50] away but then Jesus comes to zaki's
[1:59:54] house Luke 19 and5 and when Jesus came
[1:59:58] to the place he looked up and saw him
[2:00:00] and said unto him zakus make haste and
[2:00:03] come down for today I must abide at thy
[2:00:06] house and he made haste and came down
[2:00:08] and received him joyfully when they saw
[2:00:10] it they all murmured saying what that he
[2:00:13] was gone to be guessed with a man that
[2:00:16] is a sinner and zakus stood and said
[2:00:18] unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my
[2:00:21] goods I give to the poor if I've taken
[2:00:24] anything from any man by false
[2:00:26] accusation I restore him
[2:00:28] fourfold and Jesus said unto him this
[2:00:31] day is salvation come to this house for
[2:00:34] as much as he also is a son of
[2:00:37] Abraham zakus didn't become a son of
[2:00:40] Abraham zakus was a son of
[2:00:43] Abraham when Jesus Come into his house
[2:00:45] you know Jesus never said zakus you know
[2:00:48] you stole from people zakus you haven't
[2:00:51] be exactly honest zakus you probably
[2:00:54] should make it right Jesus never said
[2:00:57] anything about it but when zakus had
[2:01:01] Jesus in his house it wasn't like when
[2:01:05] Jesus went to Simon's
[2:01:07] house because this was a son of Abraham
[2:01:10] yeah and when Jesus comes to the house
[2:01:13] of a son of Abraham zakus of his own
[2:01:16] account with no persuasion with nobody
[2:01:18] commanding him he stands up and said
[2:01:20] Lord I've been wrong and I'm going to
[2:01:21] make it it all right and I'm not just
[2:01:24] going to give back what I took I'm going
[2:01:25] to restore it fourfold amen if I've
[2:01:27] taken any if I've been dishonest I'm
[2:01:29] going to do all this and Jesus said
[2:01:30] salvation this come to this house this
[2:01:32] day not because he gave the money back
[2:01:35] amen but because he testified of what
[2:01:37] was inside of him by his willingness to
[2:01:39] repent with no
[2:01:43] coion Jesus didn't have to sit and
[2:01:45] through discernment start exposing the
[2:01:47] other night you did this and remember
[2:01:49] that little deal you and remember
[2:01:51] remember this time and remember that
[2:01:53] time and I can see the receipt right now
[2:01:55] in a in a vision zakus did not need that
[2:01:58] level of discernment for him to discern
[2:02:00] himself when he got in the presence of
[2:02:02] the Lord he discerned himself he knew
[2:02:03] what he was and he was honest about
[2:02:06] it and he didn't give what he had to
[2:02:08] give he gave what he wanted to give all
[2:02:12] of a sudden zachus didn't re make
[2:02:14] retribution so that he could be a son of
[2:02:16] Abraham he stood up to make that
[2:02:18] retribution because he was a son of
[2:02:20] Abraham am
[2:02:23] hady Wright never gave 20 bucks to get
[2:02:25] salvation for her two boys she gave it
[2:02:27] because she wanted to yeah
[2:02:31] right my
[2:02:35] goodness my
[2:02:39] goodness I want
[2:02:42] to I want to just as I close I just want
[2:02:46] to
[2:02:48] share about the life of Peter
[2:02:53] the life of Peter is one that really
[2:02:56] resonates with
[2:02:58] me because Peter loved
[2:03:01] Jesus but Peter also loved
[2:03:05] Peter Peter was conflicted on the inside
[2:03:08] because Peter I genuinely believe Peter
[2:03:10] loved the Lord I believe it with all my
[2:03:12] heart but Peter couldn't get over
[2:03:16] himself when when Jesus told him that I
[2:03:19] we have to go to Jerusalem and I've got
[2:03:21] to be crucified and and mistreated and
[2:03:23] crucified and he says far be it from
[2:03:25] thee for a thing like that to happen and
[2:03:27] Jesus turns around and rebukes him
[2:03:28] saying get behind me Satan for thou
[2:03:30] carest about the things that be of man
[2:03:32] and not the things that be of
[2:03:33] God and it looked like that that Jesus
[2:03:36] rebuked Peter that Peter would change
[2:03:38] his mind the problem is Peter never
[2:03:40] changed his
[2:03:43] mind Peter still thought that Jesus
[2:03:46] doesn't need to be
[2:03:49] crucified and he manifest that fa Faith
[2:03:52] because when they come to arrest Jesus
[2:03:53] amen he takes out a sword and he tries
[2:03:55] to kill and tries to fight to defend
[2:03:57] Jesus showing that he never changed his
[2:03:59] mind about what he confessed long ago
[2:04:01] and though he rebuked from the Lord he
[2:04:02] may have went quiet on the surface but
[2:04:04] in his
[2:04:06] heart he still didn't believe that Jesus
[2:04:10] needed to die and because he never
[2:04:13] exposed that and he never repented and
[2:04:14] he never made it right when it come down
[2:04:16] to the end of the road you find him
[2:04:18] still fighting for what he believes is
[2:04:20] right even though he was already told he
[2:04:21] was wrong
[2:04:23] God help
[2:04:26] us Peter is one of those who were
[2:04:28] fussing and arguing about who's going to
[2:04:30] be the greatest in the Kingdom or who
[2:04:31] was the greatest among the disciples and
[2:04:33] and he he's getting caught up in all of
[2:04:35] this
[2:04:36] stuff because Peter Peter's in turmoil
[2:04:39] he loves the Lord but Peter Still Loves
[2:04:45] self so all of these things happen in
[2:04:48] Peter's life and he's part of the
[2:04:50] ministry he loves the Lord but yet he's
[2:04:53] rebuked by the Lord he he tries to
[2:04:57] murder a man and cuts his ear off and
[2:04:59] then he goes to the to the the trial and
[2:05:02] in the trial he begins to deny that he
[2:05:05] knows Jesus the one who just boldly
[2:05:08] proclaimed just a short time before that
[2:05:10] the th though I'll go to prison I'll go
[2:05:12] to death but I'll never forsake you now
[2:05:16] he's asked he's questioned by a maiden
[2:05:18] are you one of them no I'm not one of
[2:05:20] them and the final time he begins to
[2:05:22] swear he begins to
[2:05:24] curse immediately the crows and he
[2:05:27] knows what he did and the scripture says
[2:05:29] Peter went out and wept bitterly wept
[2:05:40] bitterly you
[2:05:42] know those circumstances were
[2:05:46] hard the whole the whole sequence of
[2:05:50] events was so hard for people Peter to
[2:05:51] deal with
[2:05:53] emotionally great campaign Peter drops
[2:05:57] his Nets and walks away from his
[2:05:59] business to serve in this ministry he
[2:06:02] leaves his home and his family for long
[2:06:05] periods of time to go join this ministry
[2:06:08] everything's going right and then all of
[2:06:10] a sudden it begins to go wrong Jesus
[2:06:11] says some confusing things and people
[2:06:13] walk away there's now criticism and and
[2:06:15] now the whole political scene is
[2:06:16] building there's tension all around and
[2:06:18] Peter as a human being is stuck in the
[2:06:20] middle of this he loves the Lord but yet
[2:06:22] he can't get over
[2:06:23] himself says the wrong thing rebuked of
[2:06:26] the lord caught in all kinds of stuff
[2:06:28] and finally it comes down to where now
[2:06:29] there's soldiers Marching In in into the
[2:06:32] in in into the uh garden and they're
[2:06:34] going to go take Jesus away and he and
[2:06:36] he can't take it anymore and he reacts
[2:06:37] and he tries to listen it looks like
[2:06:40] he's trying to save the Lord but I
[2:06:41] believe there's a mixture of trying to
[2:06:43] save the Lord and trying to save himself
[2:06:46] to save his position to save the
[2:06:47] ministry to save all the things that he
[2:06:49] believed he was heading to they were
[2:06:51] heading to a millennium this is going to
[2:06:53] be the king we're going to drive out the
[2:06:55] Romans we're going to set the kingdom of
[2:06:57] God on Earth he had all this
[2:06:58] understanding and now he's not fighting
[2:07:00] because he loves Jesus he's fighting
[2:07:02] because he loves his own
[2:07:04] understanding because of what where it
[2:07:06] places him and Jesus even told his
[2:07:10] disciples he said if you L me you would
[2:07:14] be happy because I said I go to my
[2:07:19] father they were all grieving cuz he
[2:07:21] said said I had to leave but Jesus said
[2:07:23] if you actually loved me you would be
[2:07:25] happy that I'm going
[2:07:27] away because I go to my father showing
[2:07:30] that the grieving was for self not for
[2:07:35] Jesus so Peter goes out and weeps
[2:07:40] bitterly you know before that Jesus says
[2:07:44] Peter Satan has
[2:07:45] asked that I SI that you be sifted like
[2:07:48] wheat
[2:07:51] I've said this before but to me it have
[2:07:53] been an easy answer be like yeah Jesus
[2:07:55] tell him
[2:07:57] no he's asking you he's asking
[2:08:00] permission says Satan has asked to sift
[2:08:03] you like wheat well tell him
[2:08:07] no tell reassure me tell me it's not
[2:08:10] going to
[2:08:11] happen all Jesus says is but I've prayed
[2:08:15] for you that your faith fail not amen
[2:08:23] really Jesus would give the devil
[2:08:26] permission to sift Peter like
[2:08:31] wheat but he said I've prayed for you
[2:08:35] that your faith fail
[2:08:36] not you know one of the most loving
[2:08:39] things that Jesus ever did for Peter was
[2:08:42] make Peter face
[2:08:45] himself let Peter's thinking lead him
[2:08:47] astray let his own desires send him down
[2:08:50] the wrong path until he's willing to
[2:08:52] kill for what he believes in to where
[2:08:54] he'll deny the Lord Jesus and run out
[2:08:56] and weep bitterly you know that weeping
[2:08:58] bitterly was the best thing that ever
[2:09:00] happened to
[2:09:02] Peter we look back sometimes friends and
[2:09:05] we mourn over our failures where we
[2:09:07] failed God and it still causes us grief
[2:09:10] but you know when we have to fail and be
[2:09:12] honest with ourselves and reckon what we
[2:09:14] really were without him and what we were
[2:09:15] going and doing and what we were
[2:09:17] thinking and where we were and we have
[2:09:19] to be honest about it and weep bitterly
[2:09:21] that's the best thing God ever did for
[2:09:24] us is force us to face ourselves in
[2:09:27] what's going on
[2:09:31] inside Peter would have never got there
[2:09:33] without that trial he'd have never got
[2:09:36] there without the sifting he would have
[2:09:37] never got there without the trouble but
[2:09:39] when he was there oh he was I don't
[2:09:42] think Peter was happy with himself
[2:09:45] anymore I don't think Peter thought well
[2:09:47] of himself I don't think Peter was happy
[2:09:48] about his choices I don't I think Peter
[2:09:51] was having a raw moment of
[2:09:55] reality but we see the graciousness of
[2:09:57] God because he also is the son of
[2:09:59] Abraham and he comes to him and gives
[2:10:01] him opportunity of repentance Jesus
[2:10:03] comes to him he doesn't wait for Peter
[2:10:05] to find him he comes to Jesus comes to
[2:10:07] Peter to bring him repentance because
[2:10:09] Peter needed to see what Peter was so
[2:10:12] that Peter can be transformed into what
[2:10:14] God wants Peter to
[2:10:16] be he had to face the reality of his own
[2:10:19] failure amen and then God begins to
[2:10:21] restore him amen and he he goes up to
[2:10:24] the upper room and then God comes and
[2:10:25] fills him with power amen and now he can
[2:10:27] go off and live a life L like he's lived
[2:10:29] before but now under the power of God
[2:10:31] under sacrificing himself and surrender
[2:10:33] we see a Peter after completely unlike
[2:10:36] the Peter was before when he was born
[2:10:38] again by the spirit of God he denied
[2:10:40] himself he took credit for nothing and
[2:10:42] even wanted to be crucified upside down
[2:10:44] because he wasn't even worthy to be
[2:10:46] crucified in a manner like the
[2:10:49] Lord when he healed the lame man amen by
[2:10:52] his prayer he said why look at us as
[2:10:53] though by our strength this man walth we
[2:10:55] haven't done anything it was the name of
[2:10:57] the Lord Jesus that did it Peter was a
[2:11:00] changed man and Peter ended up giving
[2:11:05] everything Peter thought he gave
[2:11:07] everything before because he asked Jesus
[2:11:08] what about us we've gave up homes and
[2:11:10] we've gave up land and we've gave up
[2:11:12] wives and we've gave up children Jesus
[2:11:14] said don't worry there's a
[2:11:18] reward but it was after his conversion
[2:11:21] that Peter really starts to give
[2:11:24] all he he had to be honest with himself
[2:11:27] and he had to deal with who he really
[2:11:30] was
[2:11:32] am let's turn to Psalms 51
[2:11:51] Psalms
[2:11:53] 51 and verse
[2:11:57] 6 says behold thou desirest truth in the
[2:12:01] inward parts and in the hidden part Thou
[2:12:04] shalt make me to know
[2:12:06] wisdom where does God want
[2:12:08] truth in the inward
[2:12:10] Parts not what we display but what we
[2:12:13] are
[2:12:14] inside but I love the next
[2:12:18] verse Purge me with hisp yes and I shall
[2:12:22] be
[2:12:22] clean wash me and I shall be made whiter
[2:12:26] than
[2:12:27] snow what does God want he desireth
[2:12:31] truth in the inward
[2:12:32] part in the hidden part he wants me to
[2:12:35] know wisdom he wants me to be true on
[2:12:37] the inside and live truth on the inside
[2:12:40] but you know what I need I need him to
[2:12:42] wash me inside and
[2:12:44] out I need him to deal with the parts of
[2:12:47] me that are still getting in the way I
[2:12:50] need to send his spirit so that I can
[2:12:52] overcome the things that I couldn't
[2:12:54] overcome before I need the spirit of God
[2:12:56] to live in me I need to be honest I need
[2:12:58] to face it I need to be genuine I need
[2:13:00] to be real I need to expose it I I can't
[2:13:03] hide it anymore but I need God I need
[2:13:06] him to come down with
[2:13:08] hisp and make me clean on the inside
[2:13:12] can't do it by willpower it's already
[2:13:13] failed I can't do it by My Own Strength
[2:13:15] that's already failed but I need to come
[2:13:16] and recognize that I need to be
[2:13:19] clean I need God to purify my heart I
[2:13:23] need God to wash me inside and out to
[2:13:26] where I'm willing to give him all not
[2:13:28] because I have to and not to go to
[2:13:30] heaven and not to be accepted in a
[2:13:32] church but because I want to please
[2:13:35] him God let that flow from our lives
[2:13:38] that's our desire is it not friends
[2:13:40] that's what we
[2:13:42] want God you want a Pure Heart Lord
[2:13:44] here's my heart would you wash me with
[2:13:47] hisp and make me clean
[2:13:52] I want to share just this one little
[2:13:53] story from Brother
[2:13:55] bham as we
[2:13:58] close in the message life
[2:14:01] story brother
[2:14:04] brandham he's he's talking about his
[2:14:07] wife when he finds his wife and he she
[2:14:09] had passed on but he called her back
[2:14:11] from the dead and he's talking to his
[2:14:12] first wife
[2:14:13] hope and she begins to tell him some
[2:14:16] things and she comes to this
[2:14:18] part said you remember that time when we
[2:14:21] was in Louisville and you was going on
[2:14:23] that hunting trip and you wanted to buy
[2:14:25] that little 22
[2:14:27] rifle I said yes he said you didn't have
[2:14:30] enough $3 to make the down payment I
[2:14:32] said yes I'm very fond of rifles and
[2:14:34] things it's just a sport to me and a
[2:14:36] recreation I and I should say and she
[2:14:39] said remember
[2:14:41] that she said honey I've tried my best
[2:14:43] to save our nickels and things to get it
[2:14:45] for
[2:14:46] you she said after I'm gone you go home
[2:14:49] and right on top of that that little
[2:14:51] folding bed where brother Ryan slept she
[2:14:53] said right up on top of there under the
[2:14:56] newspaper you'll find the money that I
[2:14:58] saved she said I've cut out I've cut
[2:15:01] that out of the allowance for my clothes
[2:15:03] and things that you let me have she said
[2:15:06] to save it so I could get enough for a
[2:15:08] down payment to get you that
[2:15:11] rifle she
[2:15:13] says she made him promise promise me
[2:15:17] you'll take that money and go buy that
[2:15:19] rifle this is a woman on her
[2:15:22] deathbed looking at her
[2:15:24] husband begins to tell him brother R
[2:15:27] tells us that he goes home and right
[2:15:29] where she said up under the paper and
[2:15:31] felt those coins there was dimes and
[2:15:33] nickels laying there that she had saved
[2:15:36] over weeks and weeks and weeks by
[2:15:38] cutting out the allowance he had given
[2:15:40] her for the household items and her
[2:15:42] clothing she had been sacrificing and
[2:15:44] cutting corners and doing what she could
[2:15:47] because she wanted him to have that 22
[2:15:49] rifle
[2:15:52] and brother bam goes on and says ou'll
[2:15:53] never know how I felt when I looked in
[2:15:55] there and seen
[2:15:57] $2.70 and nickles and dimes to buy the
[2:16:02] rifle I can't imagine how he felt his
[2:16:06] wife was
[2:16:07] dead she died and she was
[2:16:11] gone you know she didn't have to do
[2:16:14] this he never asked her
[2:16:17] to he may not have even wanted her to
[2:16:21] it wasn't his requirement it wasn't even
[2:16:24] a
[2:16:25] need it wasn't like he needed medicine
[2:16:27] or an operation it wasn't a requirement
[2:16:31] so that he would still treat her like a
[2:16:32] wife and love her she had no reason that
[2:16:35] she had to do
[2:16:37] this she did this because she wanted
[2:16:41] to I read this and I began to cry in my
[2:16:44] office and I said God I want to be that
[2:16:46] kind of wife to you not because I have
[2:16:49] to dress a certain way not because I
[2:16:51] have to pay ties not because
[2:16:59] I soon as a husband and wife starts to
[2:17:02] get into argument it starts to slip to
[2:17:04] some foolishness I've always paid the
[2:17:06] bills around here I wash your clothes
[2:17:08] who cares about all that where's the
[2:17:10] love behind it all where's the
[2:17:11] self-sacrifice where's not doing what
[2:17:13] you have to do to be considered a good
[2:17:15] husband or what you have to do to be
[2:17:16] considered a wife so that you can make
[2:17:18] everybody else how about being a real
[2:17:20] husband and sacrificing a real wife and
[2:17:22] giving
[2:17:23] everything how about real genuine love
[2:17:26] from your heart not because you have to
[2:17:29] but because you want
[2:17:32] to I read this and just wheeled around
[2:17:34] in my chair I was looking outside and
[2:17:36] just crying and say God I've done so
[2:17:39] many things to be a good Christian I've
[2:17:42] done so many things to meet the
[2:17:43] requirement I said done so many things
[2:17:45] so if people question me I can give them
[2:17:47] an answer out of the Bible so that I can
[2:17:49] prove that I'm still a
[2:17:55] but that's not the kind of wife I want
[2:17:57] to be to
[2:17:58] Christ I want to be the kind that
[2:18:00] doesn't have to cut nickel and dimes out
[2:18:03] of my allowance I want to be the one
[2:18:05] that'll lay aside because there's
[2:18:06] something I knows that's pleasing to him
[2:18:09] amen that's the kind of wife that I want
[2:18:11] to be not because I have to but because
[2:18:15] I want to
[2:18:21] I I don't
[2:18:24] want
[2:18:26] church I want
[2:18:32] Christ I'm tired of
[2:18:34] pleasing others in myself I want to
[2:18:37] please
[2:18:38] him I know that's what you want that's
[2:18:40] why you're
[2:18:42] here but we got to be honest friends
[2:18:45] about where we
[2:18:46] are honest about the things we've said
[2:18:51] honest about the actions we've taken
[2:18:54] honest about what the true motive is in
[2:18:57] our heart at the end of the
[2:18:59] day we can give a religious answer
[2:19:02] that's fine you can justify it by a
[2:19:04] quote or an example you can you can
[2:19:07] justify it by an action somebody else
[2:19:08] take and this is my you can do all of
[2:19:10] that you
[2:19:11] want and you may convince everybody else
[2:19:14] in the room and that's fine
[2:19:17] too but isn't there a greater reality
[2:19:19] than all of that
[2:19:21] isn't there a reality of what's in your
[2:19:23] heart not not the excuse for acting the
[2:19:26] way I no the reality of what's in your
[2:19:28] heart isn't there a reality of our love
[2:19:30] for the Lord isn't there a reality of I
[2:19:32] must give this guy up so that I can
[2:19:35] serve
[2:19:36] him can we have the reality of breaking
[2:19:39] the alabaster box can we have the
[2:19:41] reality of bringing the cup back to
[2:19:44] David and that cup is the blood of those
[2:19:48] men what I want the cup that I give to
[2:19:51] Jesus not to be
[2:19:54] 10% I want the cup that I give to Jesus
[2:19:56] to be my
[2:20:00] life I want to give him my
[2:20:04] life let's all stand
[2:20:10] together I feel so much like
[2:20:13] apologizing for preaching a heavy
[2:20:15] message but I can't apologize for this I
[2:20:18] cannot say I'm sorry because God God
[2:20:21] wouldn't say he's
[2:20:22] sorry he wasn't sorry for allowing Peter
[2:20:26] to be sifted like weed he wasn't sorry
[2:20:28] for all the trials he wasn't sorry the
[2:20:30] Widow gave all and The Prostitute gave
[2:20:31] all he wasn't
[2:20:34] sorry you know what he's not sorry that
[2:20:37] we've suffered cuz he knows what's
[2:20:39] coming
[2:20:41] ahead I don't want to be sorry that I
[2:20:44] suffered I want to be grateful that I
[2:20:47] had an opportunity to prove my love to
[2:20:49] him I I want to look at my trials
[2:20:51] differently I want to look at life
[2:20:53] differently I want to look at my heart
[2:20:56] differently and I want to worship God
[2:20:58] out of a pure heart with a pure motive
[2:21:02] for the right reasons and more than
[2:21:05] anything I want to break the alabaster
[2:21:07] box of my life and I want to let it all
[2:21:10] go
[2:21:11] out I don't not tip not dip but shatter
[2:21:17] I want him to have all of me let's bow
[2:21:20] our head
[2:21:22] together Lord
[2:21:24] Jesus what can we say
[2:21:29] Lord all I know to say is I Love You
[2:21:34] Lord when you came to Peter after he
[2:21:38] realized how he failed you denied you
[2:21:42] swore ran
[2:21:47] away he came to him and said Peter does
[2:21:49] thou love us me more than
