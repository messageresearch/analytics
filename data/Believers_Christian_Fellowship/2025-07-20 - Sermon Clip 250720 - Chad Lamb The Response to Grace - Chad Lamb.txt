TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now, there's a reason the prophet tells us to put on your spiritual thinking anointed jacket &gt;&gt; because he wants us to understand something more than what happened in the book of Zachchariah and what happened hundreds of years ago. He wants to bring it right up to what's going on right now. &gt;&gt; And he says now he laid the foundation. And as we read on farther, we find out that God said Zerubbabel has laid the foundation with his hands. He also shall bring forth the headstone. I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone. He shall bring forth the headstone. And we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone. And he's also the headstone. Now, if we will think for a few minutes, the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit. He's quoting Zechariah. By my spirit, sayith the Lord, not by organization, not by denomination, but by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth the church in the last day. Zerubbabel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone. He had laid the foundation. He had to took the people back to the foundation in type. Brother Re's telling us now the seventh angel is going to do the same thing that Zerubbabel is doing. He's tying the ministry of Zerubabel to the ministry of the seventh angel. and the ministry of the seventh angels, the seventh church age messenger which is William Brham and he came to do what? Bring us out of Babylon which was denominationalism &gt;&gt; and bring us back to a restoration of the temple of God. What is the temple of God? The church is the temple of God. You are the habitation of God. You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. And he goes back to the foundation because Paul says, "I laid the foundation." And he brings us back to the foundation that Paul laid. That's why brother Brennham taught what Paul taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tied together the loose ends. And so he brought us back. Amen. And begin to build on that. But at the end of his ministry, he's going to bring forth. Amen. What? Christ again. The headstone's going to come down to cap off this church, to cap off this temple in the end time under the ministry of the seventh angel. And what is going to be crying? Amen. Unto that unto that that that headstone that's coming down, the headship that's coming to the church. is going to be crying out grace, grace unto it. Amen. Because this building realizes it's your grace. Your grace. A double emphasis on grace. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a church, a bride at the end time. And she's going to know she had nothing to do with it. It's purely by the grace of God. And we've come to the capping of the the pyramid, the capping of the temple, the headship of Christ to unify with his body. And what is the what is the major declaration at that time? Grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
