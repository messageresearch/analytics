[0:00] if you don't have the correct revelation
[0:02] of the spoken word you will manifest
[0:05] Christianity according to man's
[0:08] idea sec in Corinthians Paul says it's
[0:11] impossible for a man to understand the
[0:13] things of God if he has the spirit of
[0:16] man you cannot understand the things of
[0:18] God unless you have the spirit of God is
[0:21] that right that's where the Holy Ghost
[0:23] comes in I always use this uh this
[0:25] analogy I'm not sure if I mention it
[0:27] here but it's like it's like this you
[0:30] have man and you have a
[0:32] chimpanzee and they both look alike
[0:34] right somewhat a little bit more ha and
[0:37] he's not wearing clothes right but he
[0:39] has he can walk around he's got five
[0:41] fingers he's got five toes he's got a
[0:43] head he's got eyes facing forward his
[0:44] nose like ours his ears and you can put
[0:47] a suit on him you can put a tie on him
[0:51] you can teach him how to drink from a
[0:53] cup you can give as long as you keep
[0:56] giving him peanuts he'll do exactly what
[0:58] you what you want him to do you just
[1:00] keep giving him snacks and he's going to
[1:02] keep he will wear the suit for more
[1:04] peanuts yeah right right right y but
[1:08] does he know why he's wearing a
[1:10] suit the suit has no meaning to him he
[1:13] actually hates it he doesn't know how
[1:16] why should it can you imagine a
[1:18] chimpanzee lip on a cup how difficult
[1:21] that must be and and what's he going to
[1:24] do with a tie it's choking
[1:26] him to put his feet in a shoe he's not
[1:29] going to climb a tree
[1:30] yeah you're removing the meaning from
[1:33] him by trying to put human things on him
[1:37] right there's only one way you can get
[1:40] this chimpanzee to think like a human
[1:42] yes sir you have to become a
[1:49] chimpanzee you have to go down to his
[1:51] level you have to explain so what what
[1:54] happens if you become a chimpanzee and
[1:56] you walk in the tribe and say we need to
[1:58] build a house we can be better let's
[2:01] become civilized let's stop biting each
[2:03] other's faces off you know let's share
[2:06] the
[2:08] berries this is we can become better
[2:10] people we can become you have to become
[2:12] a chimpanzee it's funny but this is what
[2:15] God did for us that's right but the
[2:19] church wants
[2:20] peanuts right blessings I'll be a
[2:23] Christian as long as he heals
[2:25] me I'll be this as long as he blesses me
[2:29] but are you finding meaning or you just
[2:31] want
[2:32] peanuts but he became
[2:35] man he showed us how to be better he
[2:38] brought his the concept of God into
[2:40] flesh the word was made flesh for you
[2:43] and I he died for you and I and he could
[2:46] show us that we don't have to be this
[2:48] immoral human race we can be
[2:51] Godlike he brought that down to us I
[2:54] don't want
[2:55] peanuts I want his word I want the
[2:58] meaning praise be to God
