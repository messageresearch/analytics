TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know we we think these things all the time you know why do i have so many scars from living in sin why did i do so much why did i go so far well god could have stopped me anytime why didn't he stop me before maybe god wanted to show how deep he could pull a center out of sin maybe you're just displaying how his ability to save is stronger than anybody can imagine that god is a deliverer of every circumstance why did he let me go this way why did i have to go that far why did why didn't he stop me when this happened why did he stop me when that happened amen maybe god amen is just showing how mighty he is and how able he is to deliver and how able he is to save he so he says he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness that he might be a healer he let there be hate that he might be love sure he did he's god and that's his attributes and he has to have something to display his attributes how would you ever know there was a night how would you ever know there was any if it was all day light how would you ever know there was a night there's a night so it could prove daylight sure there is and christ is the mystery of god revealed he goes on and he says now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my this is rich to me just even think of it see god had see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that is true but also he's a savior how do you know he is he is because i've had the experience see he is a savior and he had to express that my question is is he still a healer does he still need to express it it's still a testimony to the devil that and then there's got to be sickness to prove that he's a healer is he still a delivery man is there still many are there still many afflictions for the righteous but there's still a god to deliver them out of them all then there must still be many afflictions so that he can prove he can deliver from them all not just some but all amen and how is god going to prove that who's he going to use if god still wants to prove his world to this word his word to this unbelieving world and he still wants to defeat dev the devil in every one of his uh every one of his lies he's going to have to lift his word up and prove his word where is he going to do that through what kind of flesh through which individuals will god prove that he's a deliverer that he's a healer amen that he's a savior where will god prove that amen he'll prove it and you and i so let's not allow the devil to bring confusion when troubles happen amen but let's allow amen the eagle anointing in this day to lift us above the carnal to get where the prophet of god has explained these things to us so that we can have proper understanding and say god has not forgotten me amen god has not forsaken me but god is perfecting me he's showing himself he is defeating the devil right now
