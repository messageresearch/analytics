my heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] no won't you come inside just you and him lord my heart is open [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] praise god amen let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to job chapter 38 i'm going to greet you in the name of the lord it's certainly good to be with you this morning we don't ever want to take these things for granted amen this privilege of being together with brothers and sisters has become such a common part of our life amen i don't ever want it to be taken for granted amen i want to come with expectation and i want to come ready to hear the word amen amen we have such an opportunity in this day you know when jesus looked at his disciples and say prophets and many wise men have longed to see this day i say oh what a day is this day long to see this day to know these things but we thank god for the privilege of being here now let's look at job 38 and verse 6. job chapter 38 and verse 6. whereupon are the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy i want you to notice that all the sons of god shouted for joy not just some or just a portion but all the sons of god shouted for joy let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord it means so much to us god we pray now that you would come like only you can lord that you would break the bread of life lord with your own hand may our eyes be opened to see you lord as you break that bread and feed it to us your sheep and may we take that food lord may we gain strength and may we be pleasing to you in all that we do have your preeminence among us we pray in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i'm going to read a few quotes uh for a title i just titled this the cycle of reconciliation the cycle of reconciliation and i just hope you bear with me as we as we go into this i've got several quotes to read and we just want to see what the lord will show with show us and reveal to us through the prophet's message and and i'm going to uh share from my heart some things that are that are hearing the message that i see and it's amazing how how the the by the grace of god things we've looked at for years it just gets clearer and clearer and clearer things we've scratched our heads at things we've pondered over it gets clearer and clearer but i would say this the more clear it gets and the more things we see there's still some things we're scratching our heads about amen we're still and we're just trusting the lord to bring clear clarity and greater revelation all the time so we just want to look at this and uh the message christ is the mystery of god revealed prophet of god says so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and and when they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i've tried to explain it and break it down and now when when angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule on the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun or no moon nor stars nor nothing when he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shot up for joy see now where were you see that that was way back before the earth so i want you to see brother when he refers to this that was way back before the earth and he says several more quotes that we're going to read in the message serpent seed from 1958 he says i want to ask you who is this job 27 38 when when he said where was you when i laid the foundation of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that was shouting for joy jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give them eternal life and raise them up at the last day no one can pluck them from my father's hand he give them to me how how you going to lose amen if you were there if all the sons of god shouted for joy i tell you what i'm a son of god are you a son of god if all the sons of god shouted for joy then i must have been shouting for joy there because i can't be excluded from all the sons of god and praise be to god let's turn to john 15. i just want to read this with this understanding that the prophet of god just gave us because so many times we can read the scripture john chapter 15 and we can and we know scripture be can can be can have a dual meaning uh especially prophecy but all scripture can have a dual meaning a multiple fulfillment and a revolving history it can have a natural type and a fulfillment and a spiritual fulfillment and so you know brother bannon will even use the word of god that way in fact and when we're speaking here of job 38 brother branham will use this context two different ways and job he says where were you when i laid the foundation of the lord when the when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy he says where were you and brother benham will use it to to as in reference to where were you job reminding job where were you were you one of those sons of god but brother branham will also use it as god humbling job and say where were you where did you lay it can you count it do you know where the bounds of the sea are and brother ben will take the same scripture and use it two different ways he'll he'll do the same thing with with the ark amen sometimes the ark was a a type of the 144 thousand and may carried over in tribulation sometimes the ark of the of the redeemed amen that were carried away and never saw tribulation so so so sometimes the scripture will have dual meaning and we look at here at john 15 in light of what brother brahm just said let's look at verse 26. john 15 and 26 but when the comforters come when whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and you also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning which beginning amen the beginning of his ministry or from the beginning of the beginning amen and brother branham when he refers to this in the serpent in 1958 and he's showing us he's telling his disciples i had joy with you in the beginning you were with me in the beginning and therefore you'll be my disciples because you were with me from the beginning the question is what beginning amen i say they're both true they were with him from the beginning amen has attributes in the in the thoughts of god but they were with him from the beginning of the ministry amen they're both true so we don't want to exclude one other because of a revelation we don't want to exclude the other meaning as well again in serpent seed he said this is actually the first paragraph in serpent seed from 58 he says dear god the great and mighty god who formed all things by the power of his spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back into his marvelous fellowship that we have again with god listen reconcile us back to the marvelous fellowship that we have again with god as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain how do we know that that wasn't the same time the lamb was slain that when god and his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus we were there amen we were there with god we were there attributes with god the thoughts of god but brother man tells us his thoughts are not like our thoughts amen god's thoughts are real god's thoughts are literal amen they're true they they they are not just something that fleets through his mind and they're there for a moment and they're gone but the thoughts of god amen the thoughts of god are literal the thoughts of god are real and we were there let's turn to ii thessalonians 2 thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 13 second thessalonians 2 and 13. we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brother and beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you from the beginning which beginning god is from the beginning chosen you amen which beginning the beginning of your journey on in life or has he chosen you from the beginning beginning beginning beginning beginning amen god hath chosen you from the beg god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto he he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of glory of our lord jesus christ so why is it that you believe why is it that you can believe because he chose you from the beginning amen to believe amen to be sanctified by the spirit and it chose you into salvation through sanctification and spirit and belief of the truth if that's how he chose you then you have to believe the truth because we were chosen that way from the beginning acts 15 18 says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so if god knows and god knows all his works he knows who he'll save and we were with him right in 1964 brother brandon preached a message called spiritual amnesia and then that message says now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice and he's in me and i in him notice that every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy amen he goes on in 1960 in the message the unfailing realities of the living god he says let me say one more thing creeds does not satisfy a hungry heart creeds won't satisfy if a man's hungering for god you tell him say say the apostles creed join the church put your name here be sprinkled or immersed or whatever you want to that'll never satisfy a hungry soul because they were predestinated of god to search for life i mean you realize folks it's not it's not anything we in our humanness have ever done amen seeking for god or finding god or wanting god amen he had already put the wanting in us he put the seeking why because we were back there before his attributes and his thoughts parts of god collected together and gone but in his thoughts god in his thoughts saw us separated out to become sons and daughters of god to be a family to have fellowship with him upon the earth that was his design that was his desire in his mind and he's been working everything to that desire into that design and so that's why we we are a hungry soul that's why we're never satisfied with theology or religion or just church attendance will never be if we were there before if we were an attribute in his mind if you were one of those sons that shouted for joy when you saw the plan of salvation that's what brother man said when he showed you the plan of salvation you shouted for joy that's why you shout now you shout now because you shouted then amen because that that thrilled you then it thrills you now amen that's why we search for life now listen here here's what he says he's going to say something interesting whatever you wanted that'll never satisfy a hungry soul because they were predestinated of god to search for life they was once the angels that was once an angel who did not fall two-thirds of the angels heaven fell that's these evil spirits working among people very religious you know the bible says that you was just not always right here you were once somewhere else remember sin didn't begin on earth sin began in heaven when lucifer taken and made he said i want a denomination make a great big thing went on the north country and set up a bigger thing than michael had and he was kicked out of heaven and those angels back there them spirits when that's the reason when this earthly tabernacle was dissolved we have one already waiting see and that's the reason our name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world all the father has given me will come to me but i'm saying you know we were there in the thoughts of god we were there as attributes of god we were with god we saw the plan of redemption we shouted with joy god's thoughts are real they are literal and brother brenham said how do we know that's not the same time the lamb was slain because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world it was slain in the mind of god amen when god saw the whole plan of redemption and he shared that plan with his attributes and we were those attributes and when he shared that plan we rejoiced we shouted we were excited about the plan of salvation amen now i i want to skip to something and come back but brother bam tells a story but it's the same story tells over and over and over but i'm going to pick it up as in the message as the eagle stirs her nest in 1960. and he's speaking about when he was in mishawaka when he went on that fishing trip when he first come among the pentecostal people and and he was enthused by what he was seeing and he starts to tell the story about the old preacher and he said i felt sorry for the man he could barely get up there and i said and brother man said i thought why are they letting this old man preach and now listen he says now all the brethren had been telling what had been going on down here on earth brother ben was talking about all the preachers they had different preachers preaching in the meeting and brother man was enjoying the meetings he was enjoying the preaching he was joining the manifestation of the spirit and and a manifestation of the spirit and and he comes to this old man and brother branham starts thinking his mind why are they letting that old man up there and they had to lead him to the pulpit they said he was feeble and he said he everybody else was telling what had gone on down here on earth he started back there about ten thousand years before the world was ever formed when the sons of god was shouting for joy and the morning stars were singing together i tell you every time brother ben tells this story this is the text he refers to that this this old man that he felt sorry for was preaching he said that morning when the stars were singing together he brought it across the skies and down the horizontal rainbow in about five minutes directly he jumped up in the air and said whoopee skipped his feet together tipped around there and said you you got you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach and walked off the platform i said brother that's what i want if it'll make an old man act like that what would it do for me and i'm not just 25 years old i tell you it renews is you say amen is that right when the holy spirit comes in it makes the old act young yeah they're become eagles and brother man tells the story over and over and over again but he always referred to this text the man is preaching about what went on thousands of years ago in heaven amen when the sons of god when the stars sing together the morning stars and the songs of god shouted for joy amen and he got so enthused and so excited he it rejuvenated him it refreshed him amen he jumped up and brought him i said clicked his heels you ain't got room for me to preach why they was all talking about in denominational terms what went on down on earth about salvation jesus christ and jesus died but this man was able to go back before that amen he was able to go back in the mind of god by revelation to before what happened on earth amen to to our position before when the sons of god were shouting amen in in the holy ghost struck him amen struck him not during the song service amen the holy ghost struck him why did he strike him he strike him when he was preaching about what went on amen in heaven in the heavenly realms and was reflected down on earth when he could go back and he could find a position for the sons of god way back before the foundation of the world and bring it right down i tell you that's the thing that rejuvenates us that's what brings eagles to renew their strength amen when we when we don't delve in just what's going on on earth we see beyond just what's happening here but we can go back and say this started a long time ago with me friends amen i may have not realized that amen i may have come with spiritual amnesia my soul may have come forth amen when it come forth in this body and i came without knowledge of that amen but there was something in me ingrained embedded in my soul that was there there was a life a portion of life zoe life a germ of life a seed of life something amen was part of me amen that was back there that was shouting for joy and right now when god by revelation opens that up amen there's nothing that can make a son of god more enthused amen not a not a song not a ball game not a anything else that can be as exciting as the revelation of i was with him before the foundation i come from god i go to god i was shouting when i saw the plan of redemption that's why when we come to the message and brother brenham starts breaking these things down amen it's the first time we've ever heard it and it sounds so strange to our ears but so familiar in our souls there's a familiarity to what's being said and it's as if you always knew it but you know intellectually you never heard it before with these ears and in this mind had read the bible never conjured those thoughts it didn't come intellectually it wasn't that you knew it amen but something in you knew it because the first time you heard it you were able to say amen before you comprehended what you were amending before you could understand and piece it together and explain it in detail something in you is saying that's the truth [Applause] oh my gosh god help us help us to see it lord help us to be rejuvenated help us to be excited about the plan help us to be excited about the great plan that you showed us that you revealed to us when we were attributes in your mind let us be excited about that because that's the only thing to be excited about praise god friends praise god i say god help me help me to never allow laodicea in a laodicean condition to blind my eyes again from what god has opened them to if it'll do that for that old man what will it do for you and i it'll renew our strength i want to read another quote from brother branham from 1953 all the way back in 1953 and questions and answers on genesis says when god created me william branham i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i was i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of i was there i don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me orman neville and the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of that i think that the people today that are possessed with his spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic being spirits which rotated off of god that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven that's what the prophet says amen says all the way back in 1953 and he makes several statements like this and and and there's there's things here that i can't comprehend and mechanically can't work it out but i know that there's a truth laying here amen that the prophet knows what he's talking about and and i want to i want to address something that he says in the church age book right now so just give me your attention in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book brother bennett says before i close this subject i know there is a question in your mind you will want to know if i believe in the doctrine of pre-existence good question good question he said i don't believe in the mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls be careful what he says he didn't say i don't believe in pre-existence he said i don't believe in the mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls i hope you catch that because if you have zoe life if there's zoe life in you if you were born with that germ of life that germ of life pre-existed because it's god it always existed he says i don't believe in the mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls but he didn't say that that germ of life in you wasn't somewhere before he never said that he didn't say that germ of life and brother ben said germ of life was to be you from the beginning it was predestinated to be you it was predestinated coming down in manifestations amen amen in that germ of life amen if it come from god if it's part of god if it's zoe life the same life god is that portion of life that attribute that germ whatever term you give it had to pre-exist because it's eternal life i don't believe in the mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than i believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed jacob have i loved but esau have i hated romans 9 13 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and god bought back jacob because jacob alone was seed jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and the covenant of god if you are true seed you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age if you're seed so brother branham says i don't believe in the mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls but he does believe in the pre-existence of seed the germ of life the seed of god the zoe life of god the attribute of god we have all kinds of terms for we have all kinds of ways that brother brown labeled it and you have to understand too brother ben will even interchange his language sometimes because i mean we're dealing with human language trying to explain something that is not very explainable and we have human terms trying to use human terms to understand god amen and god transcends amen the language i mean he was before language so brother men will use terms and interchange terms and things like that but we must ask god to give us a revelation of what he means and not get bogged down in the exchanging of terms there was some part of me that was there i was one of the sons of god that was shouting i was there in the mind of god when i saw the plan of salvation and it might have been the same time the lamb was slain praise be to god and we shout it for joy so just because brother brahma doesn't believe in the pre-exist the mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls does not mean he doesn't believe in pre-existence be careful let's see before i was a soul before i was a human before that soul was embedded into a tabernacle of flesh at my birth before that i i was somewhere i was part of god i was somewhere and i was something because i was a thought okay you're a thought of god but thought god's thoughts are literal god's thoughts are real so i was something somewhere amen before amen this germ of life was in my soul in this tabernacle of flesh and so sometimes what for me has been difficult to understand this is just me personally is when brother branham makes this statement and i'll read it again when god created me william branham i was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know i was there i don't believe you're getting it but now just in a minute jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me orman neville and the rest of you all here that's in christ jesus before the world ever began and here's to my analysis of it i think that the i think that the people today that are possessed with the spirit or the spirit of god part of these angelic being spirits which rotated off god that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven for me i was having problems coordinating that with brother brahm doesn't believe in pre-existence of souls but he never said anything about a pre-existing soul he said it was just a little spirit little something that spun off of god amen then i began to realize i began to ask myself the question if there's a part of me that's eternal which is god which is the seed which is the word which is the thought which is the germ which is the gene which is the attribute do we agree in that and that attribute was a portion of god that he determined to be me if there's that portion amen my my question then became it can god take that portion and can there be other expressions of that portion before it became a soul in me why not amen why couldn't god express himself here and express himself there and now amen he's expressing himself in this tabernacle there's a germ of life amen but that germ of life was before before there was a foundation in the world before that germ of life was there and so if god wants to take that germ of life and he wants an expression here with that german life an expression here and an expression here amen god is god so now i'm not going to argue with the prophet anymore i'm just going to believe him amen there was some part of me some attribute of god some portion of light attribute that did not fall in the deception in heaven how it works i don't know the mechanics behind it i can't comprehend i don't have the language to explain it but i can tell you one thing's for sure amen i will not fall amen i will not be deceived i will not fall by the deception here if i was there and if i was shouting with the sons of god and singing praises before the foundation of the world amen and i was there in an expression that resisted the devil's lie i'm here as another expression of the same life to resist the devil's lie again and i'll ask you another question how many times has this happened how many times i don't know i'm not trying to say that i know but i know one thing there was there was attributes of god that resisted a devil's lie in heaven because sin started in heaven the war broke out in heaven and then spilled through the earth but between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 we find the earth in a state of judgment why is the earth judged what was judged and why was it judged was it just birds and rabbits and trees and then they got judged why was it judged what went wrong that required a judgment why did he have to destroy it with water and that way he would come and know his day and he says i'll no longer destroy it again with a flood because that was the second time as far as we know you see what i'm saying friends there was a another cycle of of something going wrong and something being judged as brother branham comes in the seals and he says and he starts to preach and i believe it's the seals i believe it's the fourth seal many ways he begins to say now when god began to brood over the earth and the holy ghost brewed over it he said let there be light and he said it was bringing them there was seeds that was already there from a previous civilization or something like that what what happened why was the earth in a state of judgment between genesis 1 1 when god made it in genesis 1 2 when we find it judged what happened what was the cycle what went wrong i don't know but i do know about the cycle in heaven and i do know about the cycle from from from the garden of eden to now and we realized that there there's this warfare that's going on and we know that it'll continue into the future because we're in that great final battle now amen of warfare but there'll be there'll be a destruction before the millennium but there's going to be another battle after a thousand year reign how many cycles are there i hope you understand what i'm saying friends there's so much more going on than just what we see there has been so much more going on than just what humans have have collected in the history of mankind there's so much more going on friends and we were there before at all before the falling away in heaven we were there before whatever took place on earth between genesis 1 1 and just 1 2 we were there we were in god we were an attribute of god we were there i don't know why all these things have to be this way but there's something to it friends there's a cycle there's a cycle of falling away a cycle of redemption a cycle of reconciling and we know at the end of these cycles we can see we're in a cycle now we can see after the millennium there'll be another cycle when when there's a resurrection when when the devil is loose from his chains of circumstances and he goes out to deceive the people again and they gather again in the battle of gog and magog and then holy fire from god comes down to destroy the whole thing there's another cycle there's a cycle now that'll end in the destruction in the battle of armageddon before the thousand years but after the thousand years there'll be another cycle again a cycle of deception and falling away in judgment so there's all these cycles but as the cycle cycle as the cycle cycle god is proving his word god is redeeming his attributes and god is judging sin how many times he has to cycle it i don't know but when he's done cycling there is no more sin there is no more devil there is no more unbelief there are no more attributes of unbelief amen and you understand understand what i'm saying god doesn't do anything by happenstance god doesn't do anything just to do it if god does it it's for a purpose and it needs to be done that way god's not playing games god's not just toying around if he's if he set it up and it must go this way and he knew the end from the beginning and he declared all his works from the foundation of the world if he knew it had to be this way then it has to be this way to accomplish his purpose so whatever it takes this is the cycle that it takes to come to a perfect harmony in a unity that was broken because the unity and the harmony in heaven was broken and god is working to bring it back we know that the unity and harmony in eden was broken but eden is only a reflection of heaven so if the unity and harmony in eden was broken and god's working these six thousand years to bring back the eden heart the the unity and harmony in eden then he must also bring back the unity and harmony in heaven because one's reflecting the other and that's what these cycles are doing and that's what we're part of accomplishing something for god brother brahm said in the greatest battle ever fought he said this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven i did not originate in earth i'm not talking about this part of eye this is the temporal part this is the carnal part but this is not the real me but the part of me that was with god from the beginning that was meant to be me the attribute of god that part was there before sin originated in heaven see that's really important to understand because if god is going to restore something back to its former state if you want to be there in the restoration you should have been there in its former state if you weren't there in that form or state then when god restores it back to that former state you're excluded but if god's going to bring something back to what it was before then you better hope that you were there before praise god this is what made that old man click his heels i don't even know if he realized the full revelation of it but the portion he got enthused him so much it renewed his strength it renewed his vigor it got him joyful again and i tell you friends if this can't make us joyful what will make us joyful this can't renew our strength amen what will renew our strength we're not here to be losers we're not succumbing to the trials that are around us we're not here to just be beat up and tossed around amen we are here for a cycle of redemption we are here for a cycle of reconciliation we are here to bring about the harmony that was lost in heaven says sin did not originate earth that originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings see that's why oh praise god my microphone's not working and i don't care if i have to i'll grab a handheld anyways that's why friends because the battle went from heaven down to earth and we're now fighting the battle the reason we're fighting the battle and overcoming is because we fought the battle before the battle the battle came from heaven to earth so the soldiers came from heaven to earth i hope you understand what i'm saying the army that was fighting the battle because the arm the armies were first facing off in heaven when the battle moved from heaven to earth the armies must also go from heaven to earth and it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation which what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and began in us and has been raging ever since now on the fourth seal brother branham says in paragraph 280 god had his children all fortified up by his word and he stuck her neck out and said i believe it's right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since then god come down and now he's got to he come down to redeem those that would come down have you kissed that from the four seal god come down to redeem those that would come down that's what he showed them back when they the sons of god were shouting for joy he showed him the plan of salvation he come down to redeem them that would come down god was showing them he was having a conference with his attributes we could just turn it this way he was having a conference with his attributes and he was going to show them what they would do and he was showing i'll lead the way i'm going to come down to redeem them that would come down amen and i believe those attributes were saying we'll go down we'll go down because there's something that has to happen there's something in god's economy that has to take place to fulfill god's purpose and all of his attributes will work for the same purpose because it's all him it's him it's not me and you and you and me and this and that one it is all him it is all one god all of his attributes collectively is just god the family of god is god the attributes of god are god the germ of god is god the spirit of god is god the word of god is god and we are that word we're a portion of that word we're one of those thoughts we're one of those attributes we are part of that germ so they're all working for the same purpose and it has always been working for the same purpose in whatever form and whatever manifestation and whatever display that that that the word of god has been in it has all been working for the same purpose and that's why brother benham said when christ was here amen when he went to the cross i paid for my sins there [Applause] because that was the word made flesh and i'm part of the word and if all the word was there made flesh i'm there [Applause] amen i hope we can see that that's why he said when they crossed the red sea i was there why that was the word when the word was in action amen i was represented there because i'm part of the word when god said let there be i was there i don't know in what form i don't know what it would have looked like i don't know what you would have touched or see i can't answer that question but when he said let there be i was there let that tangle the human mind and not and i say who cares i don't care if we can't explain it i don't care if we sound like a kindergartner trying to make it make sense amen i know i know that i come from god i know that i'm a part of god i know that germ of life amen that was to be me from the beginning was part of god however he choose to express it in whatever expression and if that expression changes in different parts amen of the redemption cycle that's fine with me even if i can't comprehend it or understand it amen i am part of it and forever will be a part of it i was a part of it in the beginning in the conference when he had a conference with his own thoughts and he began to show them the plan of redemption and he began to tell him that i will come down to redeem those that will come down [Music] what else would you say if you were there i'd ask you what else would you say if he showed you the plan of redemption and you know that plan of redemption see the plan of redemption was to accomplish something for god to display god to show off his attributes to purge unbelief it was all there to accomplish something and when god showed you his great plan of salvation in the conference with his attributes and he said i will come down to redeem those that will come down if you were standing there with the same revelation you have in your heart now with the same portion of god what would you say i'd say i'll go down i'll go down i volunteer amen what was this conference about i oh praise god i don't know what it's about but i know the end result and the end result is i'm here now taking my portion amen living out my portion for whatever god wants amen this is the degree this is the portion this is the way he saw fit for this portion of himself to manifest himself and i don't know what i said then but if it's any reflection of what i say now i say i'll go down praise god let's turn to ezekiel 28. like i say as we get into this there's so many things that are beyond a human mind so many questions so many things because for the for you for us humans in our human experience we have always we have always known everything by uh time space and matter so for us to think outside of that is so complicated for us everything we refer to everything we talk about has a place and a time and a substance like i'm coming to your house after church that is a time of place and a substance i'm going to the store to pick up this i work there my name is this i have this many children i live in this home i go to church everything we refer to friends has a time place and substance but god is not bound by that he created time space and substance and he's not bound by that he transcends all of that and then he can be here there and everywhere how by his infinite knowledge he transcends all of those things that bind us and bind our thinking so things that are impossible to us are not impossible to god that's why god god is only a miracle-working god by our perspective because for god it's not a miracle it's not hard it's not complicated it's not difficult to open a red sea it's not difficult to change somebody's life it's not difficult to take away an addiction or or to change a heart or bring two people together or heal a sickness that's not difficult for god that's impossible for us and so when it's impossible for us we say when it's done it was a miracle it was supernatural it was supernatural but we say it was a miracle and to god it's not a miracle [Music] praise be to god friend we see how limited we are in our small thinking as human beings and we've got to let the revelation that is in our souls say that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth how does it work i don't care how it works it works it's working in me whatever that conference was that we had in his thinking before the foundation of the world it's still holding me to my purpose ezekiel 28 and 11. moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou see list up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty ezekiel now is writing a prophecy uh uh against the king of tyrus but the king of tyrus is being influenced by a demon spirit and power and the the god is not going to speak to the king of tyrus he's speaking to the spirit within and we know that this is lucifer he says verse 13 thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering this artist the topaz the diamond the burl the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle the gold the workmanship of thy taberton of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thou was walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude i merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee that was defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them that behold thee so we find out here that lucifer in heaven committed the first sin he by reason of his own brightness he deceived himself into thinking he could have a greater kingdom than michael's humble little kingdom and he began to create a deception in heaven and in the deception he would gather uh some of the angels that were caught up in his deception and he would he it says he thou has defiled thy sanctuaries he says he was told thou art the covering cherub that covereth and i have said thee so the covering chair that covers was one of the covering terms that covered over the mercy seat over the throne of god and the very holy of holies so in the holy of holies the holy place of all there was corruption set in and sin began and he says thou has defiled thy sanctuaries and sanctuaries means holy temple or holy place see in our human thinking we think heaven can't be polluted heaven can't be defiled heaven has to be perfect but that's not what the scripture says and i can show you i'm gonna we're gonna read some more scripts i'm gonna show you that heaven had a need stay with me it sounds odd chad what do you mean everybody wants to go to heaven but there was a reason we were willing to leave heaven if everybody wants to go to heaven why were we willing to leave heaven why did god have a conference why did god say i'll come down and redeem those that will come down what was the purpose of coming down why come down if heaven was perfect why leave i think the scriptures let's go to hebrews chapter 9. just look at the scriptures with me carefully hebrews chapter 9 verse 21 brother bannon said sin didn't start on earth sin started in heaven if sin started in heaven then wow that's interesting hebrews chapter 9 verse 21 now in hebrews he's starting to type the apostle paul is typing the old testament tabernacle and showing that it was a shadow it was a reflection it was made off the pattern that moses saw in heaven and moses was told to instruct the tabernacle in the wilderness off the one that he saw in heaven so it means that there's a tabernacle in heaven that means there's a holy place in heaven there's a throne of god in heaven and so now he's replicating that but when we come down here to verse 21 it says moreover he's sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things that are by the law purge with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission so he's showing us that when when moses when he would commission the tabernacle and he would uh commission all the vessels in the tabernacle he would take blood and he would mix it with water and hyssop and the ashes of a red heifer and he would take the hyssop and he would sprinkle the tabernacle and he would sprinkle the vessels and there was a reason that he did that and let's keep reading it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified with these so what was the pattern of the things in heaven the tabernacle in the wilderness that moses made was the pattern of the things in heaven and it was necessary that the pattern was sprinkled with the blood for purification but listen what it says it was necessary that the pattern of these things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these for christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest and earth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end time of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself the scripture's saying if the pattern of the heavenly had to be purged by blood then the heavenlies had to be purged by better than those it couldn't be the blood of bulls and ghosts it could only be the blood of the high priest and jesus christ the high priest he shed his own blood and took his own blood behind the veil amen to do what the only reason was to show what moses was typing out and patterning out on earth was showing that there must be a purging of the tabernacle and of the vessels because if the ones on earth the pattern of the heavenlies must be purged with these then the heavenly must be purged by better than these which means the heavenly must be purged did you catch that the heavenlies must be purged why must the heavenly sanctuary be purged because sin defiled it this is interesting because we all our lives we grew up thinking heaven's perfect heaven's perfect heaven's perfect but there was something that god had to do he was reconciling he was restoring he was correcting something amen when he come to earth amen he shed his blood but he resurrected he wouldn't let the women touch him he said touch me not for i've not yet went and sent it to my father he had to take the fresh blood before it was touched before the sacrifice was touched by polluted men and had to present it into the throne room of god then he could come back that night what brother branham said that night and he could ask thomas come and touch me why because if the pattern of the heavenly must be purged then the heavenly must be purged with better than these ashes of a red heifer blood of bulls and goats that wouldn't cut it meaning there was a purging that needed to take place now i hope that you can catch this and i don't fully understand it so don't i'm just going to say it in order to purge the heavenlies sin started in heaven lucifer defiled the holy place we understand that the pattern showed a purging because the heavenlies needed a purging but couldn't use the same sacrifices had to have the blood of the high priest that means the only way to purge heaven was for god to create his own lamb the cycle of reconciliation went from heaven to earth back to heaven do you understand why did it have to be that way i don't know but it has to be that way how do you know it has to be that way because that's the way god did it and if that's the way god did it it has to be that way then there was no other way so the cycle of reconciliation amen would go with god said i would come down to redeem those that would come down but the coming down wasn't just wasn't just taking place on earth but he would come down and shed blood upon the earth to redeem the earth right his blood spit on the earth to redeem the earth he paid the price of sin upon the earth to redeem back what was lost in eden but it also did something else not just fix what went wrong in eden not just purge to falling away in eden amen not just purge the earth but it also went up to heaven to purge the sanctuary in heaven [Music] so the cycle is from heaven to earth back to heaven you caught that cycle now let's go to another scripture let's go to colossians i hope you're catching what i'm saying and catching my meaning because this is this is amazing to me it is anyways colossians chapter 1. colossians chapter 1. i'm just going to read a portion but we'll read more of it in just a minute colossians chapter 1 verse 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth are things in heaven we knew that earth needed reconciled but he wasn't just reconciling earth he was reconciling heaven at the same time let's read and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh you see there your bible will break that into two different verses but there is no punctuation between the word reconciled and in the body of his own flesh the eye should not be capitalized that is one sentence where were you reconciled in the body of his flesh that's why when brother benham said when he was on the cross i was there that's exactly what colossians says but somebody who wrote a bible and divided in the verses separated that making it look like two sentences it's not two sentences it's one sentence yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight now i want you to catch this we're going to read this you stay in the bible there and follow along because brother ben is going to read this and when he comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed right in the beginning he takes this for uh an opening scripture for his context and you know and he starts from verse 15. so you can follow along he said who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible invisible whether they be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he's before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that all things he might have the preeminences for it please the father that in him should be all fullness dwelt should all fullness dwell he said let me put a little emphasis on that again this 19th verse i'm reading it right out of the message for it please the father then in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and brother benham stops reading the bible and he says watch where that reconciliation went he's trying to draw attention to the fact that when jesus christ was here in flesh amen when he was the sacrifice of god when he was god made flesh he wasn't just reconciling earth he was reconciling heaven and then he goes on to read and you that were sometimes alienated and he's been your mind by wicked works you now has he reconciled he goes on to read all the way down to the end of the chapter he says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want us to thus title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed not then he says he took it in a sunday school class now he's saying now in the body of his flesh he reconciled all things and brother bam tells us i was in the body of his flesh because the word was made flesh and that's what colossians tells us so brother branham isn't making something up he's reading it right out of colossians then he gets to this place where he reconciled all things both things that are on earth and things that are in heaven brother branham doesn't want us to miss it he says see look where that reconciliation went so if more than anything i want us to catch the pattern from heaven to earth back to heaven is necessary for reconciliation because what's the pattern of your life from heaven to earth to back to heaven and i want to ask you why and i say for the same purpose for reconciliation let's go to second corinthians chapter 5. ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 17. second corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation so where is the ministry of reconciliation now we were reconciled in his body and now the ministry of reconciliation is in his body don't separate things out don't do time-space matter to this truth amen we were in him he was the word made flesh amen the word is made flesh now in his body the body of the bride which is the body of christ in the body of jesus christ he was reconciling all things both heaven and earth and now in his body is the ministry of reconciliation praise god i love the bible let's read it again therefore if any banned me of christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world and to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ we're ambassadors we're christ representatives we're ambassadors of christ as though god to beseech you by us so we're we're christ's ambassadors and god is speaking to you by us that's the reason god is beseeching you by us god is talking to you by the ambassadors god did beseech you by us and we pray you in christ's dead now he says now oh catch this friends catch it catch it catch it he says now you are christ ambassadors and god did beseech you by us god is speaking to you by us and we speak to you in christ said we are here instead of christ in christ's place that'd be a better way to say we are here in christ's place we are here in christ's dead and we pray you and christ said be ye reconciled to god what are they saying we're here in the place of christ telling you be reconciled to god we have the word of reconciliation we have the ministry of reconciliation we all the attributes were reconciled in the body of jesus christ but now jesus christ is in his body and in his body is the ministry of reconciliation that's why the bride has the word of reconciliation she has the word by the revelation that will will reconcile all the attributes of god back together and there's nothing else that will bring them back together friends amen they had to be there before amen they had to be in that conference but the only way that they're going to know that they were in the conference is that they start to hear some of the same things they heard there a denominational doctrine won't touch it a watered-down gospel won't touch it amen they've got to hear the same thing that they heard in the conference and when they hear the same thing they heard in the conference they will be reconciled back to god amen because this is the ministry of reconciliation it is the word of reconciliation and we beseech you amen god is beseeching you by us we're here in christ's place saying be reconciled back to god how because the word will reconcile you the word will come to the word the word will quicken the word the word will find the word [Applause] why do you think we had a conference before so we would be listening for a certain sound [Music] now listen when i say that i'm not talking about your ears or your brain i'm talking about that seed gene of life down on the inside it has ears it has a memory that seeding of god that germ of life it has memory it remembers what i heard and that's why i trump it if a trumpet doesn't give a certain sound who will come to war amen that i don't recognize that sound but all of a sudden when the trumpet blasts a certain sound amen there's a recognition in the seats i've heard that before that's a call to battle i heard that because i battled before amen i heard the trumpet sound before and i resisted the devil's lie before and i'm hearing that same trumpet sound again [Applause] praise be to god amen yes sir brother baby said in the bergamian church age in the church age books that those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry what was his work to reconcile heaven and earth to fix the problem on earth and fix the problem in heaven oh i hope you understand that i hope it's coming in this is bigger than you amen this is bigger than your earthly life this is bigger than your 70 80 90 years this is bigger than your job and your heartbreak and your upsets and your and your blessings this is something the plan of god from before the foundation of the world and he has designated attributes to take their place in this plan and this is a plan of reconciliation amen he is fixing everything that went wrong amen all the way back from luther's lucifer's rebellion in heaven he is also fixing that and we are part of that reconciliation that ministry of reconciliation i was there when he was reconciling it in the body of his flesh and i'm here now when he's here and me with the ministry of reconciliation praise god let's keep reading he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time i wonder if we heard that in the conference the message proving his word he says so he god come down after going through this and now every son that you eat and born of natural sex birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism the holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down at the first baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him that's what happened when the dove came down it claimed that portion of the earth that made up the body of jesus christ and now at the holy ghost baptism he's doing the same thing he's coming down and claiming this portion of the earth the holy ghost and god is to say well let me read that again the holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down at the first baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him the holy ghost in god is the same spirit see it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all that the father has given me will come not one will be lost i'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of its head will even perish that is the beginning of the creation of god there at jordan this is the continuation of the creation of god that was the beginning this is the continuation god is claiming this portion of the earth to do what to finish his ministry what does god what does god care about more than reconciling reconciling what's fallen to fixing what's happened to displaying himself in the fullness of his attributes and to bring back what has fallen away that's the purpose that's the ministry that's why we're here colossians 1. let's go back to colossians 1. colossians 1 and verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory i'd like to leave it the way it's phrased and not change it at all which is christ in you it doesn't say the hope of your glory because you've already been glorified let's just leave it the way it's written which is christ in you the hope of glory mean glory has a hope glory the heavenly was corrupted by sin was polluted there was war in heaven christ came to purge the sanctuaries he came as the high priest from heaven to earth to spill blood on earth and then to carry that blood beyond the veil into the heavenlies amen to purge the sanctuary and now he's given us the ministry of reconciliation and he continues his work in and through the bride and it is christ it's the same life it's the same christ it's not another christ it's not christ part two it's the same life the same christ the same power the same word the same spirit is now christ working in you the hope of glory all of heaven is depending on you and i they without us are not yet made perfect friends amen heaven is they're depending on you and i to run our race to finish our course to hold the word to have the ministry of reconciliation to call out to the last predestinated seed to come and be reconciled to god to come and drink of the water of life freely amen that's christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah brother rahm said in 1965 the god who is rich in mercy so now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there is only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are part of god and god is the only thing that's eternal and like as melchizedek received tithes from abraham and it was allotted to his great-grandson levi who was yet in the loins of abraham pay tithes for he was yet in the loins of abraham when he met melchizedek i want to speak on that over at another place one morning who is this melchizedek now now notice that way back god knew this boy coming down he knowed all things god knew what brother said is god knew that levi the tribe of levi would be the priests so in order in order to allow levi to receive tithes he made abraham pay ties to melchizedek and so it could be accounted to levi who was in his loins and that's in the natural dissension from a natural man i'm telling you friends everything is linked we're linked to the age before amen we're linked we're linked to everything that's been done by the word and for the word on this earth we're linked to heaven we're linked to the things on earth we're linked now to all the word he says next next paragraph now we are part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you're only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now are you the sons of god and you always were the sons of god so when all the sons of god shouted for joy i was there because i'm now a son of god i've always been a son of god and if all the sons of god were there i was there [Music] and i heard the conference i saw the plan of salvation i saw a god who would come down for those who would come down and i'm happy that i've come down to take my place amen for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well when he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then it didn't that little form of life didn't come into you at the new birth it was already in you it was always in you it was always the portion of god that was predestinated to be you it was always the predestinated word thought of god the portion that was to be you amen it was always that and it was in you as part of your soul when you were born and became a living soul amen that part of eternal life was there and we say it you know it had to be quick and it was dormant it wasn't dead because brother bam says it was in you there and it was affecting you but it had to be quick and it had to be sparked to life what had to happen amen there had to be a chinese laundry ticket he had to tear he had to tear something from something but before he tore something from something it was one something [Music] do you understand brother ben's parable of the laundry ticket you were always the son of god you were always part of god you were always in his thinking but at a certain time he had to take a portion from a portion now does this make this two different things oh hallelujah friends oh if we could see this we'll skip across the platform like that old brother did in his 90s amen because i was in the conference amen i come from god i go to god i belong to god i've always been a son of god amen i just didn't know it i was trapped in amnesia the devil had me under all kinds of confusion amen but something inside of me always belonged back here no matter how long it was separated no matter where it went it was carried in a vessel a man a dirty vessel of the earth fallen and doing dirty filthy things it didn't change the seed the seeds never been corrupted the seeds never been dirtied by all the dirty activity of the flesh and of the mind can't dirty the perfect seed all the filth that we got caught and all the confusion all the wrong thinking all the bad decisions it couldn't change this portion of god it can't dirty it can't corrupt it it can't pollute it oh praise god if that doesn't make you shout what will friends when you realize that that's me mama in the bible that's me i'm seeing me [Applause] god tore me from himself and he decided that this portion would come down and there being a soul that soul would be me and that soul would need to be purged but this wouldn't need to be purged the soul that it was in was part of would need to be purged so that this could come forth in life and take over so god would make sure that he would send another portion this was the word this was the holy spirit it's all the same thing it's the holy spirit coming to the holy spirit brother man said this holy spirit is nothing more than the seed of life this seed of god coming to life it's the holy ghost life in you and it's the holy ghost anointing coming through the holy ghost life in you and sparking it to holy ghost life it's god it's the life of god it's not i need a different portion of the life of god to waken up this portion of the life of god amen i was already part of the life of god amen this is part of the life of god when the life of god comes to the life of god in word and spirit and whatever term you give it when life comes to life it springs back to life and it says i know where i come from i know who i am but the amnesia is melting away and i'm realizing i was always part of god i was always with god what quickens this seed to life it's the baptism of the holy ghost so what is the baptism of the holy ghost it must be the other part of me you understand it was all one thing in the beginning the chinese laundrymen ticket he didn't give you two different tickets say i hope these go together he knew they would go together because they were one substance in the beginning and he took a portion off of this substance so that it would be an exact match and you were tore off the word for this day the bright age the manifestation of jesus christ in brideform that was the portion that was tore off of god that's the part of the word that is in you if you're a predestinated sea gene of god living in this day the part of god that's in you the part of the word that was broke off out of the book what is the book of life what are the believers the words in the book so one of those words had to come out of the book so he tore the word out of the book and he put it in you and what word is that it is the word it is the word for this day [Music] and the only way that he can wake up that word and get into action is to bring the word for this day to the word for this day no other word would work no teaching from a previous age no other doctrine no other theory no other philosophy will work only the word for this day coming to the word for this day and when they match it comes back to itself the prodigal son has come to himself and he's run to his father and his father's wrapped his arms around him brother man was teaching us to take the scare away you don't know who you are i hope i have the baptism the holy ghost i hope that it's almost like i just hope that if i get a sensation or experience then i'll have enough confidence to believe that i'm a child of god the baptism of the holy ghost wasn't to give a sensation or or some feeling that you could put your uh put your stock in and put your hands around because every sensational experience every experience you have the devil will be able to make you question it but the badge of holy ghost wasn't to give you a sensation or a feeling that you could lock on to the baptism of the holy ghost came to wake up the seed the portion of god that was laying there waiting to go into manifestation that is the purpose of the baptism of the holy ghost and the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost is that this seed word precedent predestination for this day comes to the word and says that's nothing but the truth and begins to live it and manifest it [Applause] [Music] not i had a feeling someday and i had something a dream and something this that may very well be how he came to you but it's it's it's christ coming to christ it's the holy ghost coming to the holy ghost it's spirit to spirit life to life word to word amen so he may come in a dream and a sensation that may be how he comes and that's wonderful but the thing that gives us the evidence that has taken place is that this life comes back to the word it was tore off and said that's the truth i received the word for my day i know it's right because i was in the conference somehow this is the second time i'm hearing this [Applause] somehow there's a familiarity in me that i've never heard it before i know intellectually i've never heard it before but something in me has heard this before where did i hear this where did i know that when i must have when i was a little boy i must have had a grandpa or something tell me the message how many has had that thought that i must have heard this somewhere because it's all so familiar because you're always you're always part of god and though it's tore off an inner soul waiting to be quickened it's still god it's still a son of god it's still a daughter of god it's still the word for this age it's just there waiting to be put back together [Music] in what the marriage union the bridegroom and the bride coming back together now that we understand what brother brenda's been talking about the whole time not even talking about something else going on here and this experience and that he's talking about god putting himself back together god calling his attributes back to himself to manifest the portion for this hour and the ministry of reconciliation to fix and repair everything that's went wrong it's christ in you the hope of glory [Music] i'm going to read another quote out of the submergent church age out of the church age book now when there here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus what all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son so we understand that and jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily god was manifest in the son that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we he's making a comparison even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many-membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken there must be this inside before this will have any effect understand the holy ghost can come the word can be preached with the with the spirit behind it and it can touch and touch and touch and touch nothing duck duck duck duck duck duck goose and that's why you get up and run [Music] because you've come back to yourself again you've had an awakening on the inside you may not have fully comprehended it that day but you knew something well you knew this is real there's something to this this is the truth and i'm part of it and that begins to grow in you nazi there is nothing to quicken hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specie you didn't change from a conquerable to wheat even though you were living a cockapoo life you may have been living a pig life but you never turned from a pig to a sheep you were a sheep acting like a pig you were a wheat acting like a cockle brewer but down inside the gene of life on the inside was wheat from the beginning and when it come to the right condition in the right season the right rain the right sun the right conditions amen it'll it'll spring back to being what it always was on the inside it says now you you never changed in species as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and in hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us why how did he call adam when he was lost by his voice he called him by name and in this day how does he reveal our names how does he call our names by revealing the mysteries and by revealing the mysteries he's calling our name what's he doing in this age with the with the full revelation of the full word given by the seventh angel what's he doing he is calling adam adam where are you he's here adam he's looking for this adam where are you and how's he calling he's saying serpent see that's what happened in the garden he said denominations is not of god amen it's the trail of the serpent he's saying cain was of the wicked one and water baptism is in jesus name and there's only one god not three what's he doing adam adam where are you he's saying you've been caught out of laodicea caught into a bright age this is the eagle time the eagle anointing to lift up the eagle it's above the things of this earth what's he doing adam adam where are you you're no longer a pentecostal you're no longer allowed to see it but i've called you up amen there's an open door in heaven come up higher what's he saying adam adam where are you [Music] and eventually he connects and you say here i am save me here i am save me redeem me back make me yours help me to fulfill my purpose whatever whatever you showed me in that commission is what i want to do i may have gotten sidetracked i may be discouraged in my mind but in my heart i heard a voice i was part of a conference amen in that conference would take me from there to here back to there and a cycle of reconciliation because it's christ in you the hope of glory this ministry of reconciliation is not finished and it's been given to the bride so now he says there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognized that we are sons of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i'm returning to thee the prodigal son didn't go find a place to be saved the only salvation for the prodigal son was to go back to the father because that's where he come from the only place for us to go is back to the word amen back to the full revelation of the word because the word was with god and the word was god we've got to go back to the word let's turn to revelation 22. we've hit on this several times lately but we're going to end here musicians if you'd like to come and come and blake if you'd like to come revelation 22 17 in the spirit and the bride say come what is this the voice of god in this day how's the bride saying come she's sharing the truth she's giving the word when the word is going forth it's the father calling to the lost sheep and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely this is the end time ministry this is the end time ministry for the gentiles it's in the bride and it's the ministry of reconciliation she has got to find that last part that last that last part that was in the conference the last attribute the last see gene of god that was in that conference amen the bride is here with the word and the word is the father hunting out that last sheep that last seed and bringing it back to himself and and it's christ in you the hope of glory the work isn't finished he's finishing it now and i say god i'm here i'm here i may i may not have recollection of that conference and all the details and all the words but there's something down inside of me that knows that i was there i heard what was said and i agreed with it all he showed him the plan of redemption that plan of redemption included you being here now is that true so he must if he showed him his plan of redemption he must have showed you here now in this age and you shouted for joy if you shouted for joy i think you agreed that that's a good plan so don't start disagreeing now why am i here with so much trouble the world is falling apart the government's changing amen you already saw it friends and you said praise god hallelujah that's a good plan so if the world falls apart and everything runs in the chaos and they shut things down amen you already shouted when you saw it amen when you saw the trouble when you saw the persecution when you saw the pressure amen you saw it because you were looking at a plan of redemption and when the attributes saw the plan of redemption you said praise god that's a good plan so don't start complaining today just keep shouting it's a good plan amen it's a good plan and all these things has to be this way but god give me the voice to keep saying come and drink come and drink come to the water of life freely it's flowing clean it's flowing pure from the throne of god i say god help us to give a clear voice in this day because whatever was said at the conference has to be said now to attract that same gene let's all stand i pray that you've had this experience but if you haven't there's something stirring in your heart something's just pulsating saying that's true how could i be how could it be me i've done this and that don't worry about what you've done that's the flesh that's not the seed don't worry about your conduct your behavior your sin don't worry about the condition of your mind don't worry about the condition of your body don't worry about your addictions don't worry about your failures forget all of it but if something inside says it's true then say father save me i'm coming back to you because the only thing that will recognize that is true is a seed of god if that's you just say father open up your arms i'm coming back father come and save me i'm coming back lord because i know it's the truth i'm unworthy amen what did the prodigal son realize i'm incapable i'm unworthy i'm a waste of a life i've ruined everything so if you find yourself in that position just do what the prodigal dead run back to the father say father save me i belong with you you're my father i come from you i'm coming back to you save me god save me and let him put you back together the right way let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus god we thank you for your word lord for the revelation in this hour the things that you have taught us the things that you have shown us lord god prophets and mighty men and wise men have longed to see this day but god back in that conference you showed us the plan and we saw it and we said it was a good plan we shouted we rejoiced we sang we clapped our hands god i still say it's a good plan and god you've got seed out there lost sheep prodigal children i pray god as this word goes out that you would prick their heart i pray god that they would begin to recognize i'm not who the world says i am i'm not what my actions say that i am but there's something deeper than my thinking something deeper than my anger or bitterness or addiction or whatever there's something deeper there's something real there's something at the core that says i belong to god i pray you'd prick their heart now that you would peel away the layers of dirt lord that has plugged up the fountain and i pray god that you'd pour the water of life in and bring forth your seed god no man can do that work it's something only you can do but we've been faithful to do what you told us to do to preach the word we've preached the word and the fullness of his revelation with the power of the holy ghost to reveal it we've preached it as true as we know how to preach it as honest as we know how and god we've done what you asked us to do now we're asking you to do what no human can do what no man can do we're asking you to call a son back lord call a daughter back put the seed back together where it belongs lord let the pieces match i pray god that your spirit would connect that life would come to life word would come the word and you would bring forth that seed of eternal life i ask that you would do it father do it according to the promise in your word go do it according to the way the prophet told us to do it by preaching the word god we pray to have your way with us let us not grow weary and well doing let us not get tired lord of our commission lord no matter how much we're buffeted no matter how many things go wrong let us never grow weary of the calling in our life lord to declare that there's a fountain of life here that you can drink from freely god let us be a light to others let our life be an example let us draw attention to the word lord let people be connected back to you use us god for lost souls use us any way that you can use us oh god we yield ourselves to you afresh let us finish our course the apostle paul said i finished i've run my race i finished my course but god he was depending on us he finished his part he's depending on us to finish ours help us to run with patience the race that is set before us help us god by your spirit if we would do wrong correct us lord if we would get out of the way straighten us back up lord help us to stay true to the calling for it's you and us that's the hope of glory finish your work finish the ministry of reconciliation lord reconcile all things in heaven and earth redeem back fix what's been wrong purge lord for we know as the prophet told us that when this bride when she goes up when every member comes in and goes to the open door finds their place in the revelation the accuser of the brethren is cast down as we take our position completely he loses his position eternally help us god to take our positions as individuals before you help us to be faithful to the calling we're with you calls as
