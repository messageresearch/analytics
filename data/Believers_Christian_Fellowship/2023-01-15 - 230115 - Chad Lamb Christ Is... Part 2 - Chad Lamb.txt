I'd like to continue on the same thought we were on on Wednesday and that was the title Christ is and like we said before that's a uh I mean that's such a statement Christ is you can finish that with so many things there are so many phrases that would fit so many things that you could say because Christ is all and in all amen but I just want to take another look at this like we did on Wednesday Hebrews 13 and 8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever now let's look at Colossians chapter one together Colossians chapter 1 verse 25 Colossians 1 and 25. wherever I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen God bless you as you have your seeds Christ in you the hope of glory Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if the great mystery is Christ in you amen and we know that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then where is Jesus Christ working amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen I tell you I was in the back working feverishly because I don't know I don't know why it is like this but you study all day you study for days you you put so many things and you got so many things in your mind you write things down I got things on notes but it seems like always you're waiting for that vein where it all lines up all this stuff that's all over and there's so many thoughts that are scattered throughout my mind and if you could just imagine your mind like a desk and you've got pay piles of papers everywhere amen and that's what it was like as as I was meditating on this subject and preparing and I'm like God I don't know how to put all these piles together I don't know how to make them one sermon and so when I was in the back there or really this morning it all started lining up and I wanted to do a PowerPoint and I love and hate PowerPoints at the same time I love them because it's so nice for us to read through quotes at the same time I hate them because I I hate putting them together amen so I was working feverishly back there and I couldn't get it to work right and I just thought well praise God anyhow the word is the same we're going to preach the word so I got myself all out of sorts and I got myself nervous and I said Lord I'm just going to relax and trust in you how many will trust him with me amen that God himself will come and Minister through a gift he's placed there so if you see me stumbling my notes or in my PowerPoint I got it out of order just don't worry about it just keep pulling God has a way of delivering amen he can use whatever means he wants he can use media he can but what he's going to use is a gift that he's placed in a human vessel and so we're going to have to rely on that and trust him Amen to do what he's promised to do for us so I'm going to look at the uh the PowerPoint brother Frank yeah okay it's a I want to look at a few quotes here and I've got some things that that I'd like to share and some things on my heart that I might pull out of my notes and not use the powerful Point exclusively but I'd like to start with this quote he says God's word come only by the Bible God's Bible is the printed form of the Son of God because the Bible said that is the revelation of Jesus Christ is God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word remember it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so this is the printed form of the son of God but when you go to read through this this is also a record of people's lives right so we read when we read from beginning to end in this Bible we're we're reading about human beings is that correct we start off reading about Adam and his wife and then we read about Abel and Cain and we read about Seth and and Cain's lineage and we're going to Noah and then we go you know on to uh Abraham and Moses and we're reading as we read down through this Bible we go from one person to the next to the next to the next you have the children of Israel you have David you have the prophets you you have all of this then you know you come into the New Testament and you've got Peter and you've got Paul and James and John the disciples and you've got the New Testament Church and then you've got the saints that are gathered in Corinth and the saints that are gathered in Ephesus and the saints that are gathered in uh the thessalonica and and you're reading what really when you're reading this Bible you're reading about people but it's the written record of the son of God so where is Jesus Christ manifesting himself it's through people it's it's it's he's manifesting himself through human beings and so we see that this is the printed form of the Son of God it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word now remember we talked about on Wednesday and I don't want to I'm trying my best not to repeat repeat everything that we said on Wednesday but I just want to labor and in a minute in a minute and move forwards with some other thoughts and um but remember we talked about gone uh and and this is some strange statements brother Brenner makes some strange statements that makes us think like nobody else has ever made us think he said way back in the beginning before there was time before there was anything before God was really God and you think how was was there a time when God he said he was Elohim the self-existent one the great Eternal being and men and that Eternal being became God when he created a heavenly host that would worship Him amen because God is an object of worship is that right so he became God Amen but we know that God is eternal he has no beginning and no end is that correct also but yet before he was God Amen he was Elohim amen and then Elohim was manifest as God when there was those that would begin to worship him so we see it's the same God he hasn't changed nothing's changed it's just manifestations or ways of expressing himself amen and we know that when God was alone when that great Elohim was alone he was alone with his thoughts amen is that right and he's alone with his thoughts and and and he uh uh he he desired for these thoughts which were his attributes which were parts of himself so when we think about the thoughts of God we're not thinking about uh like us who can have a trivial thought that'll come and it'll be silly or or it won't make sense and we'll forget it these were gone when God had these thoughts they were thoughts about himself about him expressing himself amen and these thoughts are Eternal these thoughts are real these thoughts are his attributes he was thinking of you and I he was thinking of his family and he was thinking of he was thinking of the written record of the son of God amen and so as he began to express these thoughts and he began to express himself amen he began to take on many different titles in that expression amen he was he became from Elohim he's now expressed as God because he's an object to worship he's expressed as the word when the word comes out now it's an expression of God and because the word was with God and the Word was God and that expression amen when when that word started to manifest he called that Christ and we're going to get to that in a minute and Christ is the word and Christ is the word the anointed word for the hour amen but that was still God expressing himself and and we'll say it I'll say it oh man I don't know how to say it but just say it just bear with me and help me that was before he was Jesus in the beginning was the word amen and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made and he is the head of all things and we know all of these things but but we know that that if we go to Genesis it says God made the heavens and the Earth is that right but God made the heavens and the Earth but when we go to Colossians when we start talking about the Son of God we're talking about Jesus Christ he says by him all things were made which are in heaven and were Earth all things were made by him and for him and without him was not anything made that was made and he is the head over it all so you say who made it God or the word and the answer is yes who made it God of the word and because God is the word the word is the way of God expressing himself amen so so so and but when that word is expressed it calls it Christ it's also his son because the word came out from him and what came out from him was the son so he is he is the son the Son of God Christ amen and that was back before he had a name but later when that full word that full thought of God the word of God was modeled and confined in the body of Flesh he took on a name and that was Jesus Christ and that was his name past present and future so you think about Adam and his and the woman in the beginning with the original when the woman was formed and you could say where did the woman come from the woman was already there do we understand this when Adam was in spirit form before he was made flesh the woman was there there come a time that the woman had to be expressed and as she was expressed it was a further expression of Adam but she was there already in Adam amen So Adam then was taken from Spirit he was put in a body of Flesh so that he could he could intermingle with the creation that he was ruling over and he was put on a body of Flesh and the woman was there is that right we believe that so God separated out a portion of Adam and he separated out the feminine Spirits from Adam and he formed the woman amen this is not this is not when the uh I don't even know how to use English words I don't know this was not when the woman this is when the woman came into manifestation but it really wasn't her start because her start was already an atom but it's when she came into manifestation in which she came into manifestation you can say this is the manifestation of the woman that's true but you can also say this is Adam is that true it was a further manifestation of Adam it was Adam's Spirit Adam's flesh it was Adam so you could say you could call it woman but it was still Adam so that's why when he created the male and female he called their name Adam there was no separation and identification they were the same two parts of the same or two vessels containing the same I don't know how to describe it amen there's so many things in the spirit world world that we try to relate to with with our carnal understanding with a language that has been developed to understand things we see taste feels touching here is that right But but so our language is limited to this creation and so it's so hard to find adequate words to describe amen things that that that that are go far beyond the tangible in this life so you could call her a woman but you could call her Adam and that's what she was called Adam now she did not get a name until she separated from her husband and adultery and as she did she she conceived and she received a name and their name was Eve is that right until that point she was called woman or Adam but once she was given a name she was given the name Eve now you can use that name past present and future now so so in the day that God laid Adam down and pulled a rib out of Adam and and made the woman in that day no one would have looked at her and said eve makes sense I don't even know why I'm going this way just keep pulling okay please help me out no one would have said eve they would have said Adam all right later amen she would get a name and we know that name is not really a good thing that she got a name but once she got that name now you can go back and say uh back in the beginning God laid Adam down and he pulled Eve out of Adam you can say that now because now we know it because now we know the name that's been associated with that expression but back then you would have never said Eve so that's why you know we we looked at the scriptures on Wednesday that Moses amen he forsook Egypt to Bear the reproach of Christ and Christ was that rock that spiritual rock that followed them through the Wilderness and so we we talk about uh that was Christ nobody in that day would have said Jesus Christ because he hadn't been formed yet he hadn't taken a name he hadn't come into flesh uh uh the flesh body and so nobody would have said Jesus Christ nobody said Jesus Christ amen but afterwards when he received the name now you can go back and say that was Jesus Christ all the way through past present and future and so uh there's a scripture that I want to look at I believe it's Ephesians let me let me go there Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 14. Ephesians 3 and 14. for this cause I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named so now the whole family in Heaven and Earth has a name and that name is Jesus Christ amen and what is Jesus Christ he is the word he is the Son of God he is the thought of God declared and expressed that is Jesus Christ so that is why the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ because the whole family is the expression of God and he's the head of all of that and that is the name that's why in this day when the bride has been identified as part of Christ she doesn't take on a name she doesn't take on Blasphemous names like Eve did amen her name is Jesus Christ she is Mrs Jesus Christ so she recognizes that she is a further expression of Christ okay praise God let me get back to it let me get back on track in the message well I had to be Shepherds he said in Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest and now we're looking at Christ is Christ is and so I I say this and and there's some statements that that we make sometimes that we don't know how to make a better one we we when we say Jesus Christ is uh the denominational understanding our carnal mind goes to just that vessel amen that God was in reconciling the world unto himself amen the one that came out of Nazareth the one that was born in Bethlehem the one that was nailed to the cross and so sometimes we limit Jesus Christ to that figure of Flesh but before that that Christ took on a human name he was the same person he was Christ and since amen that body has left the Earth the spirits come back it's the same spirit it's the spirit of Christ which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so what is Christ who is Christ he's the anointing he is the word the the word May the anointed word may manifest these two quotes are from Wednesday can you receive the word all the word of Christ Christ is the anointed word he is the word anointed Christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest so that Christ is the word anointed that's why brother Branham said that that if you are an attribute of God you are a siegene of God you are part of the word and that means there's something in you that is part of the thought of God Amen that's expressed in this hour so there's something in you that is part of the word amen but there must come an anointing upon that word to make it live and when that anointing comes on that word which is the spirit of God it takes the word that's inside and quickens it to life and makes it live and now it becomes the manifested word which is expressing Christ the word made manifest is Christ so now whereas Christ expressed where the words expressed where the anointed word is expressed that's where Christ is being expressed praise God so in this message we we went through Wednesday as well Christ has identified the same in all generations now when Moses come he could not have to know his message neither could Moses have took or no it took Moses's message neither could Joshua have took any of their message see each one Isaiah could not have took another's each message is for that age and with the AIDS that we're living in uh when that word is interpreted God's speaking that word out and making the word for that age live giving the interpretation of it that is God in Christ manifesting see because Christ is the word and when the word is made manifest that is Christ in every age all right we're all on the same page he says God will judge the world not by any certain group he will judge the word by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made Flash and dwelt Among Us so he is the expressed word of God in every age he makes him the same yesterday today and forever so now when we go to that statement Jesus Christ and we know this was a major theme of brother Branham he quoted this this verse we've talked about it before but I don't know how many times I never went to find out how many times because you would have to search it in different ways he phrased it but I would say hundreds maybe thousands of times he he expressed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it was the theme of his ministry and what is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not the body of Flesh that was back there with Moses it was the word that was back there with Moses it wasn't the body of Flesh that was nailed to the cross that was back there in Jeremiah's day or back there in David's day it was not that was not it was Jesus Christ of course it's Jesus Christ but then he was only known as the word amen as it was coming through prophets now the word takes on body receives the name and that's Jesus Christ and will always be Jesus Christ so now you can look back and say that was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he is the expressed word of God in every age makes him the same yesterday today and forever on the wings of a snow white dove he says now what God is showing him here is this on these sacrifices is speaking of Christ that how God took Jesus to Calvary and tore him apart and received the body up into heaven and sent the spirit down upon us that the same Spirit was on him has to be on you to dovetail with the body to be the bride at the end time see that's right won't be a denomination now it'll be the word what he was so you have to have the same Spirit upon the word the bride will have to be the word this is why in our age no denomination will work I mean there's no way a denomination will work this has to be the end of denominational systems because the nominational systems are adding to or taking from the word amen so there's no way this could be a denominational bride she must be separated from denomination to be United with Christ because Christ is the word she must be all of the word so the whole denominational thing will not work in this day so let's read Romans 8 again so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any men have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his I don't read any further I know it's up there please don't read I want to look at verse 9. you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you so you're still in flesh but you're not in the flesh you're in the spirit that's what I'm telling you human language is pathetic to try to understand God because you're not in the flesh but you're in the spirit but you're living in the flesh but you're not living by the spirit of the flesh or living by the desire of the flesh you're living by the spirit because the spirit of God is in you so you're not in the flesh but you're in the flesh but now you're in the spirit why how are you in the spirit because God's spirit's in you so am I in the spirit is the spirit in me or is it both you see Cardinal Minds never going to get this there has to be something deeper taking place in the soul I mean that goes beyond language this has to become a reality not words this has become a reality because language will never express this reality it's got to be something that's living inside each one of us so you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you so you're correct that the spirit of God is in you right now if any men have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so I have to get the spirit of God and the spirit of Christ is that what the scripture I'm not in the flesh but in the spirit if the spirit of God is in me now if no man I'm not the spirit of Christ I'm none of his so I've got to to be right I've got to have the spirit of God but I'm also going to have to have the spirit of Christ so how do I get the spirit of God in the spirit of Christ and Lester the self-same thing unless it's just other ways of expressing the same thing maybe it's just other words attached to the same thing amen and it's not confusing at all the spirit of God is the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is the spirit of God that's why we get so bogged down by language you know we we talk about receiving Christ as our savior and then needing to receive the Holy Ghost as if it's something different I know it's a greater experience I'm not talking about that we receive Christ as our savior we acknowledge that he died on Calvary for us but now we've got to go on and receive the spirit so I've got Christ and now I need the spirit of God no Christ is the spirit of God the spirit of God is the spirit of Christ it is the word it is it's everything it's all the same they're just different ways of expressing the same thing it goes on in verse 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness so so the Christ is in me is that right question is this Christ in you so Christ can be in me and you at the same time also when Jesus Christ resurrected God took the body up to heaven and he and he took the spirit and he sent it down to man is that right so the question is is that flesh body laying up there dead and Limp like a ragdoll just flopped over a chair somewhere or is it have life I don't think the body's just laying there a dead mutilated body flopped over I believe Jesus Christ has life so how did he take the spirit out of him and send it down to us and he still has spirit and how can his Spirit be in me and be in you still being him it's because the carnal mind will never understand the things of the spirit so Christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so now the spirit is or the flesh is dead because of sin this flesh is dead I've died to it because of the sin that's in it but now I'm alive by the spirit of Christ that's come in me which is also the spirit of God that's come in me and quickened me to life and now the spirit if the same spirit that raised him from the dead be in me it'll raise this body from the deadness of sin and Quicken it into newness of life so that it'll begin to manifest the life that's on the inside so it's not just a dead body laying there but now there's a spirit that's come to Quicken it to Life to Live to manifest the word amen so are you dead yes Paul says I'm dead and my life is hidden Christ he's dead but he was alive amen dead to the flesh but alive in Christ and Christ alive in him was making his flesh live the word praise God and the message the world is falling apart he says but when God come and was manifested Among Us he handled him we handled him with our hands he said God first Timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh so who was that in flesh was it Christ or was it God the answer again is yes I'm telling you this is an easy test to pass all you have to put is yes on every answer was it God or was it Christ the answer is yes you see wow the trinitarian doctrine was formed by the mind of human beings they didn't understand even the language of the Bible it looks like he'll say that God and then Jesus Christ is separate and then the spirit is a separate person altogether and then and they're looking at this and and the human mind has no option but to try to rationalize it with the world it understands but that's the wrong way to understand God or an interpret his word so without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh scene of angels believed on in the world received up in the glory see now that was God With Us God over us God With Us now God in us all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me so it's been God all along you see his same works the church is ordained to carry on his work with the same Spirit you couldn't carry on the same work without the Same Spirit That's right The Same Spirit comes on The Same Spirit Carries On the work in perfect places and I declare to you that Christ is the Holy Ghost I love this quote brother man makes it so simple he said God is his word say Christ is the word is that right he said God is spirit and Christ is the spirit and now he says I declare to you that Christ is the Holy Ghost amen so if you receive the Holy Ghost you receive Christ amen whose life is in you it's the life of Jesus Christ in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I declare to you that Christ is the Holy Ghost the word Christ means the anointed one just a person that's anointed that is the Christ the anointed one and the reality is as we talk about this we all know this but we don't know it amen we know it amen in our heart but in our mind things get discombobulated and look at first John 5 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one they're not like one these three are one but they're different ways that God is manifesting himself or expressing himself so the Father the word and the Holy Ghost well I guess that leaves Jesus Christ Plum out I don't see mentioned in the scripture unless you see him mentioned in the scripture presidents do you see him mentioned in the scripture yes he's the word amen so the father of the word and the Holy Ghost but we know Christ is the Holy Ghost Jesus says the father and I are one so how are we going to divide them all up and separate them they are one amen just ways of expressing in Ephesians in the church age it says to be anti-word is to be anti-jesus to be anti-orders to be Antichrist because the spirit and the word are one if your anti-word you will have to be Antichrist so if you're anti-word you're anti-jesus because Jesus Christ is the word praise God let's turn to numbers 11 read something together I am so trusting and depending on God to help us as we move forward here numbers 11 verse 10. in numbers 11 the people are crying out and murmuring because they want meat to eat they're in the wilderness journey and they're murmuring and it says in verse 10 of chapter 11 and numbers then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger the Lord was kindled greatly Moses also was displeased and Moses said unto the Lord wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy servant and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have I conceived all this people have I begotten them that thou should have say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father bearth the suckling child into the land which thou swearst into their fathers um it's worse unto their fathers When shall I have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may that we may eat I'm not able to Bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of hand if I have found favor in thy and let me not see my wretchedness and the Lord said to Moses gather unto me 70 men of the Elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the Tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee and I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and I will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone so God is going to do something wonderful for Moses Moses is a man amen he is he is struggling under the burden of caring for the people and he says go get 70 men true Elders princes and he bring them around the Tabernacle and I will take the spirit that's in you and put it upon them now let's go over to verse 24. and Moses went out and told the people the words of the of the Lord and gathered the seventy men of the Elders of the people and set them round about the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease but there remained two of the men in the in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other was me Dad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out into the Tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told Moses and said eldad and me dad do prophesy in the camp and Joshua the son of nun the servant of Moses one of the his young men answered and said my Lord Moses forbid them and Moses said unto him envious thou for my sake would God that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them so now this is a tremendous passage of the scripture for me because now we see that Moses under the burden cries out to God and God says gather 70 men and I'll take the spirit that's on you and I'll put it on them now when we speak logically as human beings if we would say something like that we would believe that God took the spirit that was on Moses put it on them and now it's not on Moses anymore it's on them because if I'm going to take this controller from here and I'm going to put it over here or I'm going to take it out of my pocket and I'm going to give it to Anthony's pocket you'll see something move but that's not how this works God can take this put it in Anthony's pocket and leave it in my pocket at the same time the ministry of Moses diminished not one centimeter after God made this move amen I don't know how the spirit can divide itself I don't know how it can be here and there and everywhere at the same time and work in full capacity I don't comprehend it intellectually but I believe it by faith that whatever amen whatever Christ is he is in me whatever is in you he's in me whatever he is here he's on the other side of the planet amen whatever wherever amen God his spirit is in US thank you amen that's why so many times we think carnally about all these things even about the coming of the Lord that now he can't come unless we see a nail prince and a hand but but he sent his word and he is the word is he the word amen so he sent his word and we live in the time where the word has been fully revealed and given back to the bride so if you receive the full revelation of Jesus Christ I mean how can you have the full word and not have him and when the full word came back the spirit it unlocked the fullness of the Holy Ghost back into the church again how can you get the Holy Ghost and not have Christ not have him you see it we live in a day we know it through the church ages there's been a limitation because of the doctrines of man because of the the limiting of the word there was limiting of the outpouring of the spirit or the expression of the word but now we're not living in the limited time now we're living in the full measure of the full revelation of Jesus Christ Christ is here amen he has unveiled himself the seals have been taken off the book he has returned to his church amen how is it all work I don't know where is this and where is that I mean it's like we want to take beakers and we want to take a vessel that's Christ this is Christ this is the spirit and he's poured a little bit in here and a little bit in here and a little all around the world until until that you know this one's got more than this one and there's none in here and I ran out there's no running out this is Spirit it doesn't work like natural it doesn't work by the same laws it doesn't work by the by the same methods amen I don't know how it works I don't look at me and say brother Ted how does it work I don't know how it works I don't know if there's a measurement at all I have no idea but I know that Christ is in his bride amen all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured in the church that didn't mean there was no other expression anywhere else at any other time in heaven it means whatever he is he in full measure of that full capacity full life of that he put in Christ whenever the full capacity full measure Full Life of Christ he put into his church amen praise God so now God takes the spirit that's upon Moses and he puts it in the 70. and as soon as that Spirit comes in then they begin to prophesy and they do not see say Amen they weren't prophesying before remember how brother Branham said if the spirit of Beethoven coming to you you would compose music is that right and so he said as the spirit of Christ come in you'll live the life of Christ amen he said if John Dillinger's Spirit came in me he goes I'd go rob banks because that Spirit Well now the church has received the spirit of Christ which is the word how could she do anything but manifest the word how can she take denominational understanding how can she limit God's word how can she stay Amen in her own desires contrary to the god word of God how can I God how how in the world can we say we receive the spirit of Christ and continue on Amen and some of the things of the world that we did before no we now we receive the spirit of Christ Christ will live his own word and that's the whole point of receiving the spirit of Christ so that his word will live in bodies of Flesh amen so now there was a dilemma because God said Gather them up into the Tabernacle amen and so there was 70 and the scripture says their names were also written there's two names eldad and me dad I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right but but you get the point I don't know if you can pronounce it any better they weren't at the Tabernacle so there were 68 in the Tabernacle and there was two outside the Tabernacle and God said bring them up to the Tabernacle and I'll take the spirit off you and put it on them and when God poured out the spirit of Moses upon them amen those outside the Tabernacle in the camp it hit them at the exact same time and these in here are prophesying these two out here in the camper prophesy but but I thought you had to be at the Tabernacle and I thought God was going to take physical stuff and put physical stuff on physical people and they were going to begin to prophesy so you would have to be here to get the physical stuff but it's not physical it's spiritual and when God designated that that Spirit that's in Moses will come to these seventy it didn't matter where they sat it came to the seventy and they begin to prophesy amen and now I mean now a young man comes in and tells Moses he's going to tell on them they're in trouble for prophesying in the can and even Joshua says forbid them and he says why forbid them amen wood to God God wants all of his people to be Prophets God wants this Spirit upon everybody not at just upon one amen that's what God desired I mean Moses is expressing God's desire God would want everyone to have this Same Spirit upon them amen but they refuse to unite with God at Sinai and God's now working through Moses but but God would want everyone to receive this spirit and so nobody was upset that they got it outside the Tabernacle see how the spirit world works you've got to come up here to get it but they got it how did they get it because there was a point in time that God was going to take what was on Moses and give it to the 70. and it wasn't working in physical dimensions in physical ways and when that same spirit that was on Moses was only 70 it hit those in the Tabernacle we hit those outside the Tabernacle why because their names were written down because their names were written down so at the time so the names of the seventy were recorded and that recording showed who would receive that spirit is that right these are the ones that will receive the spirit so when God released the spirit that was on Moses to come unto those who are written down amen it didn't matter where their physical location was when God released that Spirit it hit everybody whose name was on the book thank you praise be to God why because they were eligible to receive the spirit that was in Moses and when the spirit of Moses hit them amen they begin to prophesy both in the Tabernacle and outside and I'll tell you this bride in the end time her name is written down it's been recorded in a book and when God designates that this is the time for the spirit of Christ to be released in full measure amen it doesn't matter amen where you're at you can be anywhere in the world but that spirit will come and hit you and it also doesn't matter on time you can say well that was released maybe in 1963. I wasn't born for myself till 1977. it's not bound by time amen it was released to the names that are written in the book and my name is written in the book and now there's upon me the same spirit that was upon Christ only my expression is portion my personal what God wants to do in this Tabernacle of Flesh there's a portion of deity taking up resonance and this amen and brother Branham when he when he begins to describe this now realize he's trying to use English he's trying to use the same uh the the same flawed principle that I'm trying to use that's why it's the foolishness of preaching that city of Souls but brother remember says you ought to the ocean and you dip your spoon into the ocean and pull out all the chemicals that are in the entire ocean is in the Spoonful only in a portion so what do you have how much of Christ do you have you have all of Christ if you have a portion of Christ you have all of Christ oh I I don't know how to make that sink in I hope to God that it sinks into every one of us amen that if you get the Spoonful you can say well I've only got a portion amen you've got a portion with everything that's in the word is in you the full life of the word amen with the thought of God behind it is now poured unto you you say but I just got a little piece are you you've got everything that was ever in the Bible is in you every healing is in you every word is in you every manifestation is in you but we're by the thought of God and by the word of God we're here to express a certain expression so Moses is a spirit was poured out on the 70. and all of those whose name were written down got it when God released it but it's not like Moses fell over dead Moses was still moving and not like Moses Ministry ended Moses was still ministering Moses was still performing Miracles Moses was still giving the word of the Lord Moses was still leading the children of Israel Moses was still doing everything that Moses did before the moment from what I can tell in the scripture Moses didn't lose anything but they also got the spirit because it was going to take the spirit of Moses for them to carry the burden of Moses to help the people so what spirit is it going to take at the end time for the bride to manifest Christ it'll take his spirit in full measure I tell you I'm so glad I can say my name was written down and that when God in this end time took the denominational barriers and chains that was holding back the spirit of God and released it to come back upon the people my name was included in that list who can receive that spirit and I thank God for it he said now we noticed that God began to make him a bride for Christ and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it is part of him now the brightest part of him she is part of him the word for that day the bride becomes part of the word for it's Christ now you believe that we have to be in Christ in Christ we have to be of Christ in Christ part of Christ so the bride becomes part of the word for it's Christ it's Christ expressing through bride form in this day but how much of Christ I'd say all of Christ you know when those those 70 got a a portion of the spirit of Moses God was going to take the spirit that was on Moses and put it on the 70. so this is just how human brain works all right I take one whole divide it 70 times and you each get apart is that right sorry Moses you don't have anything left I don't want to do that so I'll leave half with Moses and I'll take half and I'll cut that up into 70 parts and you get no whatever Spirit Moses has they had what the first one had the 17th had it was not portioned out like that it was given unto them the spirit that was in him was given unto them amen and it was the same it was the same in characteristics it was the same in power it was the same in everything only they had a certain they had a certain manifestation that they were going to do in helping to Bear the burdens of the people they may not be writing the law they may not be amen the final judge in all matters but they were bearing the same burdens so they received the same Spirit not a partial Spirit not a not a piece off the corner of the end that's left over for the 70th but whatever Moses had they had foreign so whatever Christ had this bride has and who gets it those whose names were written down let's go to revelation 10. I'm gonna read it here I've got it on the screen revelation 10. I wrote down 8 to 11 but I'm just going to take verse 10. we know Revelation 10 is when the mighty Angel comes down with a book in his hand and and seven Thunders utter their voices and the seventh angel when he begins the sound the mystery of God will be finished as he declared to the servants the prophets we know all this then we come to Revelation 10 and 8 and John is told to go and take the book and eat it and John's the type of the Bride it says and he took the little book out of the Angel's hand and he ate it up and it was in in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings here we see brother Branham said Elijah and Elisha Ministry was just the same as Jesus Christ and the bride male and female and we saw Christ working amen through Elijah Ministry in our day amen but there's a little bride he's going to take and eat the open book but she's told to prophesy Again by what spirit will she prophesy again whatever Spirit prophesied the first time she'll prophesy again and and you know what you know uh uh that we've talked about this so many times even the term prophesy again shows that she doesn't have her own prophecy I think this is so important to recognize in the end time it's not like amen the bride can go off like a Loose Cannon and come up with anything she wants to come up with no she's here to prophesy again which means she's prophesying what's already been prophesied because this bride under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age so that means in order to be the final voice to the final age the voice of God in this day she must be under her messenger not equal to and not above she must be under her Messenger to be the final voice to the final life but what is it it's the voice of God where's the voice of God coming through coming through his bride why because she's eaten the book she's become one with the word she's received the word and the spirit of the word and now she is through prophesy again whatever has been prophesied shall prophesy again so we look at this word prophecy because sometimes many times we think well if we're going to prophesy then the bride's got to be getting New Revelations she's got to give something she's bringing the bride doesn't have to bring one new revelation to prophesy again she's prophesying what's already been given us through the prophet messenger so the word prophesy means to speak forth by divine inspiration it also means I'm going to skip down to the bottom one to utter forth declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation praise God not everybody will catch this message she has to eat the book she and and I love I mean this is just so in the theme of what we're talking about tonight what does it mean to eat the book I mean can you're not ripping Pages out but neither is just listening to a tape eating the book neither is just walking through the store eating a meal cooking the service is not a cooking a meal is not the same as eating a meal but to eat the book to take the book and eat the book is she has received the word into herself and she has become United with this word and now this word is in her more than just say I'm I know where to go get the food I know where the storehouse is I know where the canned goods are I can turn on the stuff but you see we've got to eat the book we've got to take the word that was preached amen not just listen to it but we must take it into ourselves brother Brandon says you say I believe the message brother Branham I believe the message he says that's good but that's still not it yet you must take it take it unto yourself we got to become one with it you must identify with it let it identify us and we'd be identified with it so we know just to prophesize to speak forth by divine inspiration you can or this one um definition 1B the idea of foretelling future events pertaining especially to the kingdom of God but one sea to utter forth declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation amen and that is this message it can only be known by divine revelation and the bride is the only one who can get the revelation of it so who else can prophesy again only she who has eaten the book and has Christ on the inside can prophesy again nobody else can if not we're just going to repeat what somebody else says amen we're not here to repeat what somebody else says we're here to take it take it into ourselves digest it let it become one with us and then whatever it is in US Amen Let it speak out from us and you say well brother Chad I'm not a preacher oh oh there's so many ways to speak the message there's so many ways to prophesy and you can declare your message by living your message [Music] what does it do it declares it speaks you know the the Bible talks about the heavenly host the the Stars where God wrote his first Bible the Heavenly Host is is spilled out there and it's placed in divine order and it speaks of the word of God the whole Plan of Redemption is in the stars and and and the Bible says that their language their voice goeth out and speaketh Night by night they utter his speech is that what the Bible says about the Stars why because it's the first Bible it's on display every Star positionally plays shining with the brightness God gave it in the position that God put it in amen shining night after night right where God put it not moving around where God put it shining the amount of light God gave it to shine in conjunction with the other stars that are around it all make up a sign in the Zodiac that tells a story of redemption and God says their voice goeth through the ends of the Earth night after night they utter his speech there's not a language there's not a place where their language is not known that's not audible words coming out of your mouth that's the word manifested on display when each of us get in our position that God has placed Us in this end time shining with the light that God's given us in the place that God's given us there is a there is a light an illuminance a revelation that's coming out of our life and it's speaking Revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and you say them to me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy what's this Spirit it says prophesy again what's the spirit of Prophecy what's prophecy supposed to do the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy what is this testimony it's translated witness 15 times and the bottom definition is one who testifies a testimony as in before a judge what is the spirit of Prophecy it's the testimony or the witness of Jesus Christ what are we supposed to do as we live our life we are supposed to witness the life of Jesus Christ we are his Witnesses our lives are testifying that he lives brother mem says in the rising of the son the son has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day the quickening power that's the the life of Jesus Christ the quickening power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God we read this last time the sun has got to be revealed he's got to be revealed where in the bride and the last day in you and me who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and the spirit of Prophecy to live the life for this day it says in the message I have heard but now I see he came around he said now as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the time when the son of man is being revealed now watch the son of man was revealed to Abraham's group as a man a prophet in the form of human flesh an ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him Elohim now Jesus Promised here that in the last days the son of man will be revealed again to that same type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls I wonder I want to pay a little bit of attention to this for a few minutes we've been through this many times so we know that on the planes of memory that Abraham received the visitation and that visitation was God in the form of Flesh and that's what brother Branham says here in the time when the son of man is going to be revealed it'll be as it was in the days of lot it'll be like it was in Sodom and over and over brother Branham says we're in a Sodom condition these are the days of lot and the son of man is to be revealed to Abraham's group as a man a prophet and a form of human flesh an ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him Elohim an ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him the self-existent one the almighty God amen and we know that God had taken the element of the earth and he made a temporary body for him to dwell in amen so Abraham wasn't speaking to the temporary body he was speaking to the life inside and the life inside that body was Elohim and had dust on his clothes and it ain't and it ain't me and it ain't me the calf the goat that was fixed for it drank milk ate butter amen we know that what was it it appeared to be a man but what it was was Elohim in the man it looked like a man but it was God in the man is that right it looked like a man I tell you when brother Branham was standing on the platform amen when he was talking and and he was having conversation and talking about his day it looked like a man amen but when he turned his back to the crowd and began to discern the thoughts in their heart amen there was another life inside that man there is something else there we could recognize that's not just a man amen that's not just a man in a suit that's not just a man who told us about hunting and where he's been and he traveled from this city to that City there's more to that man than what I see that was God in that man that was Elohim in that man that was Christ in that man that was the Holy Spirit in that man that was the word the person of the word in that man you can pick any title you want you can use them but it was God and a man he said now Jesus Promised here that in the last days the son of man will be reviewed again to that same type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls and I want you to watch what brother Banner says this is so important this is really the heart well one of the hearts of what I want to say one of my piles of paper on the desk now we'd say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word here said it they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man would be made manifest remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty now this is interesting brother Branham says that that that was the revealing of the son of man that was the son of man being revealed amen back in in Abraham's day but it was Elohim come in a body of Flesh and it was God speaking to Abraham and he says he shows right back to that time just like it was in the days of Sodom Jesus Christ says the son of man will be revealed but we know that the son of man is Jesus Christ is that right you believe the son of man is Jesus Christ yes he called himself the son of man over and over and over again the son of man is Jesus Christ but brother Branham says that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there he says that is not Jesus he had not yet been born brother Branham is talking about the manifestation of the man of Flesh Jesus the flesh man hadn't been born yet what was it the same life that was going to come into Jesus amen was there that day and another body of Flesh what was it it was Elohim in a body of Flesh and Elohim and a body of Flesh was revealing a mystery to Abraham amen and in doing so he was Discerning the thoughts of Sarah and the tent behind him and also speaking of the destruction of Sodom at the time of Sodom brother bam said we've come back to all of these conditions amen what is it it's God again when Jesus Christ was standing here and he was Discerning the thoughts that were in the heart of the people that was the sign of the Messiah it was done to Abraham so long ago what was it the same Elohim that was in that body that went back to the elements was now in Jesus Christ is that right and now that word took on its name and so now it's Jesus Christ to say so you can say that wasn't Jesus it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but it wasn't that one expression of that body of Flesh that was that was given 33 years upon the Earth but it was the same life that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but what was it it was Elohim what was he doing he was manifesting Christ was it Christ yes but it wasn't Jesus The Man from Nazareth yet he would get that name when he became a body of Flesh when he was born and Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together that the son of man come down in human flesh and brother Banner's Ministry amen what was he coming to do the bridegroom call will come through this what's the bridegroom call come out and meet him amen the bridegroom cometh the Midnight Cry amen we've heard it amen now it's the son of man revealing himself through a son of man and when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to do what to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us what's he typing it with back on the planes of memory but he said that wasn't Jesus he he's not saying that wasn't Jesus Christ the word what he's saying is it's not that body that was hanged on a cross it was another form it was Elohim prefiguring what would come later in another day that's why brother Ben said we don't look for nail prints we look for the word made manifest we don't want to get hung up and wait for another dispensation and miss our dispensation because who was it who was it standing on the platform Discerning the thoughts and hearts of the people it was Christ it was Christ it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it was Elohim in another form it was the almighty self-existing God who was who was there before he was God then he became God but he was still Elohim then he became the word he was still Elohim amen as the word was expressed he was still Elohim and it was Elohim in that body of Flesh and it was still Elohim revealing himself to Abraham and now it was Elohim and Jesus Christ he's still Elohim he's expressing himself and now that same life amen that took on the name of Jesus Christ is there on the platform working in that Prophet to show us he's the same yesterday today and forever he will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper she's already United said we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage so you fill your flesh self of the Flesh of the Mighty Men because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again the son of man was manifest in William Branham who was it it was Jesus Christ it was Elohim in a form manifesting himself so you would see whatever was on the plans of memory is here whatever was there in Jesus Christ when he walked by the Sea of Galilee is here it's the same person whatever form he takes it's the same one it's God and he's revealing himself showing the sign of the Messiah so that we would know who's present and he come to make his word so real that it'll unite the body and the head together as one to do what to manifest the son of man again Jesus Christ through you and I not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing now this manifestation has come to unite the bride body you and I with the headship the person of the word to do what to manifest the son of man again which is what the life of Jesus Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory was he supposed to live what am I supposed to do am I supposed to get a tent am I supposed to go on a campaign I'm supposed to do healing Services no you're supposed to stay in your position and shine light you're supposed whatever amount of light he's given you whatever job and whatever correlation of the stars in whatever order whatever position you stay there and you shine the light of this word amen and Jesus Christ will be making himself appear unto people as he lives in you and I same one it's the same person it's the same Spirit that's been poured out without measure all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's poured into his church and in the end time whatever is held back the full fullness of the Holy Ghost has been released by the opening of the word to come back in the church so it's the full life of Jesus Christ it's Elohim in another form expressing himself that's the day that we live in and some people we we sometimes get hung up on the physical but he's there and he's not here and I haven't seen the nail Prince and and listen this is spiritual friends this is not like dividing up 70 parts of Moses spirit and put it on them I don't know how it worked but it worked amen I don't know how they got Moses spirit and prophesied like Moses amen because their names were written down but Moses still had Moses spirit and he still prophesied I don't know how it all works but I know one thing it works because we saw it work in that man and God's provided a place of worship he says but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and God himself that was God and the Bible said it was now he come down and he manifests himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent that's right Jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons where is Christ he's in his bride where is his bride well she's in Christ let's go to a scripture I don't feel like I'm doing a fair job to express this but let's go to a scripture in John John Chapter 3 The Gospel to John chapter 3. John chapter 3. and I'm going to go John chapter 3 verse 1. foreign there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said in him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so now Jesus is speaking a spiritual terms but Nicodemus being a regular human being like you and I he is absolutely confused by this term born again Nicodemus saying unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee accept a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee thou must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou Hearst the sound thereof but cast not tell whence it come and whether it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit the spiritual birth is invisible it doesn't work like the physical birth and he says You must be born again and Nicodemus said he says how can a man when he's old be born again and through the second time in his mother's womb he says no be born of the spirit and it's like the wind the wind comes from somewhere and it goes somewhere you have no idea where it started and where it ended and you try to go go ask a meteorologist to tell you the starting point of wind on the earth and the ending point that wind started here on the map and it ended here on the map it works totally different than anything we understand I I don't know how it started I don't know where it ended but one thing we know is that when it blows through the tree I see the effect of it I see that the wind and you can say there is the wind you're not seeing the wind you're seeing the effect of the Wind and the effect of the wind lets you know that's where the wind is so he says so is everybody that's born of the spirit he that's born of the spirit you don't know where he came from you're not seeing where he's going because his life didn't start on this Earth his life started before and will continue beyond but what you're seeing in the spiritual birth amen is the birth has come to him amen and quickened the seed the part of him that was meant to be him from the beginning has come to life by coming encounter with the word for his day and now that part has started somewhere before and when it's like the wind and you can't see where a man starts and where he finishes but you can see the rustled of the leaves and say that's the wind right there and you can see the life that a person lives and say that's Jesus Christ in my brother and my sister that's the word so you must be born of the spirit and then verse 9 Nicodemus answers and saying unto him how can these things be Jesus answering is said unto him art thou master in Israel knoweth not these things listen Nicodemus to be a master in Israel knew some pretty complicated stuff he knew with timelines he knew genealogies he knew prophecies he knew he studied and he knew some pretty complicated stuff but but Jesus marveled that he didn't understand this simple thing now he must be born it's easy just be born of the spirit verse 10 Jesus answered and said in him our thou master in Israel knoweth not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and you then testify that we have seen and you receive not our Witness if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of you Heavenly things and no man hath Ascend it up to heaven but he that comes down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven let's think about this for a minute Jesus Christ is the son of man is that right called himself son of man where was he he was on Earth no he was in heaven let's read it again I'm confused no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man oh okay so he came down from heaven which is in heaven so did he come down from heaven or is he in heaven the answer again is yes you're all passing the test the spirit doesn't work like the natural the reason we're confused on the coming of the Lord is we are trying to understand it naturally physical by physical things and it's spiritual Jesus Christ is the son of man he says no man's ascended into heaven but he that's come down from heaven the son of man which is in heaven so has the son of man come down yes where was he he was there where was he in heaven how can he be there in heaven at the same time because heaven is not a physical Place Heaven is a dimension amen say brother explain it to me I can't explain it to you I don't understand but I know that Jesus was in heaven and standing on Earth but but we know that he come down from heaven he did he come down from heaven he said he come down from heaven we sing songs that he came down from heaven but he's telling you that though he came down from heaven he's still in heaven how can he be in heaven and come down from heaven because Jesus he's not worried about language and your understanding of language he just says it and by Revelation you have to catch it that it's true not only that but let's go to Colossians let's go to Colossians oh my God help us we are in so far over our heads because none of us can comprehend this intellectually but this is the reality this is the real reality what we've thought as reality is only a vapor a Mist a mirror it is not the reality this is only the negative not the positive we this is our reality but it is not the Ultimate Reality there's a greater reality than this reality and we're trying to understand the message in the Bible only by this limited reality you've got to tap into something that goes beyond the veil Amen to catch a revelation from God it's so much more than physical it's spiritual Colossians 3 and 1. Colossians three and one if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so Christ is in heaven but he promised to live with the Believers in the Believers and he tells us here that you're dead and your life is hid with Christ and God so Christ is in heaven and my life is hid with Christ so maybe I'm not even here maybe I'm in Christ in heaven or maybe I'm here is my life here or is my life in heaven the answer is yes let's go to Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4. for God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath he quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen so where are you at where is your life at my life is hid in Christ with God Amen and Christ is sitting on the right hand of the father and my my life is hidden him and I have resurrected with him and raised with him and I'm seated with him in Heavenly places right now but brother Chad you're crazy I'm looking right at you you're only looking at a physical thing that your eyes are picking up amen this is all frequency it's all moving amen at a certain frequency if you were if if you were moving at a different frequency you wouldn't even see me I know I'm blowing so many Minds I'm blowing my own mind if I was I mean there's there's all kinds of ultraviolet there's all kinds of rays in the light spectrum that's moving through this and you can't see it because it's moving at a different speed but if you move at the same speed that that's moving then you see it it becomes visible to you so what we think is reality is not reality God's word is reality God is reality all those things that go beyond human comprehension are your ability to touch it taste it feel it that's why it has to be apprehended by faith and that faith can only come by God so the question is am I here or am I there and it's funny because when I say there I point like this but I don't know exactly where there is [Music] but the I want to ask you am I here expressing The Life of Christ through a c Gene that God's quick in their life yes I am here manifesting in this dimension the next question is am I in heaven seated with Christ Jesus the answer is yes so I am here and I am there and I don't know if here and there is the same exact place I don't know but all I know is there's more to me than what you see and we are not limited by physical laws physical properties all these that's only the limitation that this body is under in a certain dispensation in a certain period of time to express a certain part of God's character so it's limited it's bound but the life on the inside is not bound it's free so I am here and I am there Jesus was here and he was there and the question is where is Jesus Christ now if it's been true and every other day it can be true he can be there and here is that right he can be there in here praise God I don't know how else to describe it may God give greater revelation and the choosing of a bride he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together make one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one so Christ is uniting with his body they are becoming one body amen where is that body Apostle Paul says ye are the body of Christ that body is here present he's present with the body it's his body a further expression of himself amen well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride read that again how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come so the is the groom coming did the groom come did the ministry of the son of man in the end time what was the son of man to do to make the word so real that it will unite the two together the bridegroom and the bride did the groom come and and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride so when the groom comes what does he look like when the groom comes what are we looking for when the groom comes to unite when the head comes to the body and the groom comes to unite with the with the bride what does he come like he comes and he wouldn't be the bride what is he Jesus Christ and the formation of the Bride things that are to be if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living how could the groom come and not be the bride I says why brother Benham said we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest where is Jesus Christ is he there yes is he here yes explain it I don't know I can't but he's poured all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he's poured into this end time bride I can't explain it but I want to live it I may not be able to comprehend the intellectual I may not be able to graph it on a piece of paper but I want the full effect of that to take effect in my life I want the fullness of the word to manifest through me and I want to be changed by the life that's here to change me and I want to display whatever he is I want him to be that through me in future home brother Adam says if you are the bride the bride is part of the husband and the only place that you ever recognize is to recognize what part of the husband that word you are or you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you have to recognize your position but the man says there's a he's telling telling us that you have to recognize your position you have to know where you are we're not a denomination we're not stuck in denominational understanding we're not in the church ages as far as living that kind of church-aged life and church age dispensation where are we we're all the way up into the headship the very mind of Christ has been given to us and when you know what part you are amen it brings an identification to who we are and that identification brings a life remember before Moses you know knew what he was he thought he was something but then he kind of lost that what his mother had taught him he lost it but when he come in contact with the Living God the pillar of fire that Pillar of Fire reconfirmed and told him who he really was and who he really was had to be made manifest and now that life began to live he began to live the life of the Redeemer Mary she thought that she was a regular person living a regular life amen but an angel came and gave her identify a different identification when she got that identification she received the Life of Christ and when she did it manifest Christ understand the day we live in and we recognize our then there's a power that comes with position and God can live his life through us let me read one quote out of Christ as the mystery of God revealed and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they're flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of a spirit amen how do you know it Bears the same record same fruit same word same manifest same manifest Christ see manifest Christ same life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same signs things that I do show you also oh Hallelujah my notice the Vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death think about it why did Christ die to redeem the lost to redeem what was Fallen what was separated from why did he die to bring back to God the attributes of God that were separated out why did he have to do that I mean because all the way back in the Garden of Eden amen Adam was but part of himself was put into the woman and that woman fell and he went with her to redeem her causing all of mankind to be lost so what what was Calvary all about Calvary was all about redeeming back what was Fallen to United with the bridegroom again to return it back to Eden that's why when we receive the life of Jesus Christ and let that life through flow through US amen that is his victory and think about think about Moses when Moses now knew his position and he stepped into his god-given position amen there was nothing on earth that could stop Moses Moses was Unstoppable because he was in his position because how can you stop God it was God and Moses that's why when brother Brandon was here showing the sign of the Messiah he seemed Unstoppable amen nobody could nobody could stand in that presence without being exposed amen it worked night after night after night why because he was in his position doing what he had to do to call out a bride so there's power in position and power and understanding when we get into our position there is nothing in this world that can stop us from manifesting the portion of the Life of Christ that's in your life that's why when we know who we are we know our position this is the hour that he's living in a many-membered body this is Jesus Christ in the form of his bride and God has given me a portion of this life to live and anything that would hinder me from living that Life of Christ has got to go it cannot stop God from coming forth that's why whether it's a husband a wife a mother a father an employee whatever it is that you're doing if you're in if you're in the channel of God living the life that God's called you to live and there's something there to stop that expression that thing has got to go nothing could stand before Moses amen as Moses was doing what God wanted him to do and nothing could stand before you and I if we stay in our position and manifest the life of God we have faith to pray for our healing how do you have faith to pray for your healing because if it's hindering me expressing Christ I can pray for my healing because I'm not here just for myself I'm not here just by myself and I'm not here just for myself but by a revelation God's given this hour I've been planted here by the Eternal will of God and the predestinated plan of God and I'm here for a purpose and I must live that purpose and if anything would stop that purpose I I just I just believe it's got to go because I'm not here for myself I'm here to be an expression of Christ man let's all stand I pray that God will just put those pieces together there's so much there that I just can't just can't get my fingers around it's Beyond The Human Side there's a living reality but I pray that God would open up to you the possibilities musicians if you could come Blake if you could come I just pray that we no longer view things through natural eyes anymore that we don't limit just what we see there is no limitation what is the limitation there is no limitation because it's God now living his life through us we're not limited by what we can touch we're not limited by what we can see I mean when when Philip was expressed in Christ he wasn't even limited by the distance he could travel on horse or Chariot or foot why he wasn't living for himself he wasn't living by himself he was there to express a portion of the Life of Christ amen and when God had need of him to go from here to there there was no limitation don't be limited in prayer life don't think now I've got to go I've got to walk over to a certain place and I've got to kneel down and fold my hands a certain way listen you're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ is in you and you're in Christ where are you I don't know I'm in him where is he at the right hand of the father he's in heaven I'm in heaven but I'm here and he's here so there must be a link behind this veil of Flesh between me and Heaven there must be a conduit an Open Door a channel there must be a portal between two dimensions now we're talking science fiction amen if any of you ever grew up with the science they're they're in the soul of the children of God there there's a portal I don't know what else to say listen I can't tell you if I got it right or wrong all I know is there's a reality here there's a portal down inside of you amen that that is a doorway in the heaven you're in heaven and you're here you're straddling two Dimensions at the same time you're not doing it with your shoes and the leather and the clothes but something spiritual is there something natural is here and that's spiritual from there is living in the natural here and moving it in the plan of God and I want to stop thinking about one day I'll get over there and I'm here and he's there and I hope that he can come here you know so many times we want to call God on the scene when we get into trouble and say oh God come from heaven and help me he's in you he's only as far away as we place him amen and you can see how this mentality makes it so hard for us to overcome because we started thinking that I'm way down here and God's way up there and I'm in the pit in the middle of trouble and I need a God from a far-off distance to travel a long ways and come down and help me out and what we do is we start damaging our own faith because we're believing for the wrong thing but when we tap into this reality and recognize that it's him that's in me amen even if it's a teaspoon of God it has all the ingredients of God inside of me and whatever he was he always is he's the same yesterday today and forever and if Jesus Christ is in me if yesterday he could part water if he could walk on water if he could break bread he can still do it I don't want to put him far away I don't want to put him in the past and I don't want to put him in the future where is Christ he's in me is he in you is he in you is he in you the spirit that was in Christ has been pulled out in full measure into his bride did that leave him anything he's still Christ he's still the person of Jesus Christ but she's the fullness of his word the full expression the full life is in her I don't know how it works but I believe it and I want to live like I believe it I want to live in the midst of tragedy that I can just say God help me and see the supernatural work around me I want to live in faith where I know that wherever he takes me wherever he leads me wherever life takes me that I know everything will work out because I'm not here of my own and I'm not here for myself that there's somebody else that's living through me and if I can keep surrender to that and he can move me in his path then everything that would hinder that has to get out of the way and every time I come into an obstacle now it's either it's another way for God to manifest his word it's another way for God to either turn me display him he's doing something I haven't lost God every time I get in trouble I want to live with faith in who I am and who he is so many things Jesus speaks that are absolutely so contrary to understanding I mean he begins to speak in the Book of John he says if I go away I must go away and I will send you another comforter I have to go so he can come but I'll come to you so is the comforter going to come or is Jesus going to come and then Jesus will say Amen if you believe in me then my father and I will take up our Abode in thee yeah so now I mean you you've got three Spirits in you the spirit of Christ the spirit of God and the spirit of the comforter unless they're all the same so have you received the spirit of the word or the spirit of Christ or have you received the spirit of God it's the same and whatever it's done before it can do today I listen I am here Made Alive by the spirit Quicken this flesh has been quickened to live the word by the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead I'm here something in my soul is alive but I'm also somewhere else at the same time God help us help us to break out of the natural into the Supernatural and live Supernatural lives in human flesh let's bow our heads your lord Jesus I pray God that you would come on the scene in each of our hearts and Quicken this word to a reality Lord God I as a human being have failed completely failed to express the fullness of this thought the depth and the reality of this true revelation God I don't know that any man can but God you can bring the reality alive in each of us God I pray that you would help everybody that's here today myself included help us to stop the limited thinking help us to stop putting you off putting you far away putting you in the future but God help us start living [Music] as if eternity is now for it truly is God lived through each one of us manifest yourself in US God I'm not I don't want to be guilty of waiting for something to come when it's already come I don't want to be waiting for something to open when it's already open God I don't want to live below my privileges and I don't want to live as though I'm not a believer God I want to live to the full life of this word with the full expression that's available God we can live you've called us to live above sin above the desire of the world above the desire of this flesh you've called us so much higher God come and help us to live that God I pray that you would just flow through us and to others that we can boy be that final voice to the final age that you can use our lips however frail they may be that you can use our bodies however whatever they may be male or female young or old it's inconsequential it's not the body we're looking at it's the life on the inside God live your life through these vessels of clay and help us to express you day by day and to prophesy again help us to be witness Lord that you're alive for your living in US God I pray that you would do the final work that you've left for this time that you would do it through each one of us but I love him I thank you for your word it is so rich these things in the spiritual that we've tried to explain there's no way we can but God I pray you'd Quicken a reality inside each of us that even though it's not comprehendable Lord we say Amen anyhow because something in US understands what's being said there's something deep inside that says I know it I know it and it's true let it be real in US Lord we pray we love you God we ask for your blessings and our lives bless us as we go from here help us to live a greater manifestation than we've lived yesterday may we continue to yield to you and you have a greater preeminence in this day by day in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen will I look back in history I see I see Mighty God in vain proving over and over that his word will never fail but I'm not just dwelling on a past few [Music] for the same God [Applause] [Music] who spoke to you [Music] [Applause] sing your heart to me
