========================================

you were the tiny little baby when she when she was hanging her clothes out on the backyard and all at once the house caught fire and here comes the fire anes to put it out and the house was full of flames you were screaming from the upstairs no one would go in and pierc those Flames but a little mother your little mother wrapped herself up and in there she ran through those flames and she grabbed you she took off she took the clothes from off of her face and wrapped you all up in in it and put you in her arms and and and placed her face to the flames and Through the flames she came to rescue you that's why you're pretty today and that's why she so scarred you are ashamed of those scars that's the way Jesus has done for us when we were Sinners ugly before God cast down and turn away he came and that the lovely Son of God from his Ivory Place palaces he came down to earth and he took upon the shame and the humiliation upon himself and the sin upon himself and he died there on Calvary crying out should I be ashamed of a gospel Christians on the street are ashamed to stand for the gospel but he was marred and he was made ugly so that I could be made free and so in considering that uh you know I'm so glad those those scars were a testament of a mother's love for a baby she was willing to endure the scars for somebody else's sake and when we consider Jesus Christ he was willing to endure the rejections rure the pain endure the embarrassment the humiliation for somebody else's sake now I think the question is coming to all of us what are we willing to endure are you willing to endure the rejection you willing to endure the criticism are you willing to endure all of these pains that you're going to have to handle for somebody else's sake if we're living our life for ourselves we haven't arrived if we're living our life for somebody else we're looking Heaven heavenward we're pointed the right direction and that's the reality of it in Hebrews 12 it says um looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross there's a time where you just have to endure the pain you just have to go through it it's painful when they ripped open that scar tissue it's painful but it had to be ripped open to set me right so I could walk right act right scripturally or spiritually speaking there's wounds in me had to be ripped apart I had to have some spots that I've been covering over ripped to shreds so that I could start walking right talking right acting right treating people right it's not fun it's painful amen maturing is painful
