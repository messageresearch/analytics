[0:01] so Joseph now is
[0:03] forgotten and he's still in
[0:10] prison God
[0:12] knew that this man in order to fulfill
[0:15] the vision had to know how to rule and
[0:20] Reign so he started training them in
[0:23] Piper's
[0:26] house you know what he would have picked
[0:27] up in Piper's house potier was an
[0:30] Egyptian the Bible's careful to tell us
[0:32] he was an Egyptian and he was at a
[0:34] captain in the guard do you know what he
[0:36] would have picked up in Piper's house
[0:38] Egyptian culture Egyptian customers
[0:41] Customs Egyptian
[0:44] politics cuz he was in the house of a
[0:46] high-ranking official he would have
[0:48] figured out quickly how things work in
[0:54] Egypt you know what he would have picked
[0:56] up in
[0:57] prison All the gossip
[1:00] from the king's Palace because the the
[1:03] prison he went to was the one where they
[1:05] keep all the king's
[1:09] prisoners so he would have picked up all
[1:11] the political undercurrents oh
[1:16] yeah that was the best training he could
[1:18] have ever had to ascend to the right
[1:20] hand of
[1:21] pharaoh he had seen it on both sides he
[1:24] had heard it from both sides and in both
[1:26] places he was given responsibility as a
[1:28] ruler to rule and Reign and God and be
[1:30] in control of people and God was
[1:33] absolutely working an absolute beautiful
[1:36] plan it was probably more perfect than
[1:38] we could imagine he probably overheard
[1:40] things in that cell and that prison that
[1:42] saved him trouble when he got to the
[1:46] throne I don't know I but can you
[1:50] imagine so God's plan was absolutely
[1:54] perfect amen and God's going to work his
[1:55] plan in us he's going to have a perfect
[1:57] plan and he's going to work it in our
[1:58] lives and he's doing the same same
[2:00] things with us
[2:01] today you have to believe that he's
[2:03] doing the same things with us today he's
[2:05] bringing us in an ordained plan he's
[2:07] bringing us an ordained way because he
[2:09] has a goal in mind he has an objective
[2:11] in mind and he's trying to bring us into
[2:13] Christlike character so why so that we
[2:15] can rule and reign with
[2:18] him and in so doing he's got to put us
[2:21] in places and in situations where we
[2:23] have to learn how to handle situations
[2:25] and we have to hear things and
[2:27] experience things and see things amen
[2:31] that we didn't want to hear and we
[2:32] didn't want to experience and we didn't
[2:34] want to see because we would if we
[2:35] planned Our Lives my life would be so
[2:38] cream puff cake eating sweet as honey
[2:41] every day of my life I would never learn
[2:44] anything if I got to
[2:51] pick I'm glad he doesn't let me pick cuz
[2:54] I mean I'd still be a little baby on the
[2:56] floor Kicking and Screaming every time
[2:58] he didn't answer my prayer
[3:01] immediately I'd be throwing a 2-year-old
[3:03] temper
[3:06] tantrum so God In His abundant goodness
[3:10] and Grace he's got an objective in mind
[3:13] and everything's moving to that
[3:16] objective and faith in that is what
[3:19] gives us the right attitude in the midst
[3:20] of
[3:21] Trials
