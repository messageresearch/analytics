[12:28] for the grand privilege Lord of being
[12:30] gathered like this
[12:32] well we just ask now as we turn our

[13:13] us to manifest in this hour We're
[13:16] depending on you Lord and asking for
[13:18] your help
[13:19] in Jesus Christ and we pray
[13:21] amen
[13:23] amen
[13:24] while we're standing we're going to have
[13:26] you turn your Bibles to Genesis but just
[13:28] before we read our scripture brother
[13:30] John alluded to an announcement
[13:33] and I thought he was going to take the
[13:35] announcement and run with it because he
[13:36] has every right to
[13:38] but it's a privilege for me to announce
[13:41] the birth of a new little baby boy so
[13:44] brother Aaron and sister Samantha small
[13:46] wants to welcome Lucas Mateo small amen
[13:49] isn't God good
[13:51] amen
[13:57] we had the privilege of going up and
[13:58] seeing him the other day and he's a cute
[14:00] little guy some anxious to get him here
[14:02] in the church for everyone to see amen
[14:04] God is good we appreciate his goodness
[14:06] and we appreciate a healthy delivery and
[14:09] they're they're all doing well they're
[14:11] back home now so we thank God for that
[14:12] also wanted to remind you that brother
[14:14] Ben siebold is up in Michigan preaching
[14:16] for brother Dan so remember him as he
[14:19] travels back home today and I'd like to
[14:21] say happy Mother's Day amen it's such a
[14:24] privilege to see Godly mothers amen
[14:27] especially amongst our sisters who have
[14:29] given themselves over to the word of God
[14:31] and surrendered their lives to serve
[14:33] their children and their families say
[14:35] God bless you you're an encouragement to
[14:37] us and we love you all and thank God for
[14:40] each one of you amen and I hope you have
[14:42] a wonderful day today amen
[14:44] let's look at Genesis chapter one
[14:46] together just before receding
[14:50] okay
[14:52] Genesis chapter 1
[14:58] and verse 26.
[15:03] and God said let us make man in our
[15:05] image after our likeness
[15:07] and let them have dominion over the fish
[15:09] of the sea and over the foul the air and
[15:10] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[15:12] and over every creeping thing that
[15:14] creepeth upon the Earth
[15:15] so God created man in his own image in
[15:18] the image of God created he him male and
[15:20] female created he them now let's go over
[15:24] to chapter 5 of Genesis
[15:27] read verse 1 and 2.
[15:33] Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 this is the
[15:36] book of the generations of Adam and the
[15:38] day that God created man and the
[15:40] likeness of God made he him male and
[15:43] female created he them and blessed them
[15:45] and called their name Adam and the day
[15:47] when they were created may God bless you
[15:50] as you take your seats
[15:52] amen this this morning I I would like to
[15:55] take for a subject the great value of
[15:58] the feminine attributes
[16:00] the great value of the feminine
[16:03] attribute amen and we want to take a
[16:06] look at this we start off with a very
[16:08] familiar portion of scripture because
[16:10] we've read this I don't know how many
[16:12] times amen and and we've opened we use
[16:15] it as opening scriptures I can't count
[16:17] how many times amen but it's a pertinent
[16:20] theme to us in the day we live in
[16:21] because this is the bride age and we see
[16:24] in the very beginning that God created
[16:25] man in his own image and and as he made
[16:28] man in his own image he made him male
[16:30] and female
[16:31] so we've been through this many times we
[16:33] understand this but but they were they
[16:35] were one they were always intended to be
[16:37] one and even when they came forth in two
[16:40] manifestations or two expressions they
[16:42] were two expressions of the same thing
[16:45] they were two parts of the one unit two
[16:47] parts of the same thing so there's man
[16:49] and the woman he made them male and
[16:50] female and called their name Adam and
[16:52] the day that they were created so we see
[16:54] that they amen were created to be
[16:57] singular Adam amen so it's it's a
[17:00] beautiful picture and we're going to get
[17:01] into that later as we go but we know
[17:04] that that with within Adam amen was the
[17:07] woman she was there with him in spirit
[17:10] amen and she had the masculine and the
[17:12] feminist spirit and God would take and
[17:15] separate that and he would bring them
[17:16] back together
[17:17] and so we see that part of the attribute
[17:20] or the expression of gone is male and
[17:23] female because man was made in the image
[17:26] of God male and female made he him so
[17:28] the expression of God can be expressed
[17:30] in male and in female and I would like
[17:32] to turn quickly to Proverbs chapter 8
[17:34] just to take a quick look at something
[17:36] here
[17:38] Proverbs chapter 8.
[17:47] Proverbs chapter 8 verse 1.
[17:54] in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 1 it says
[17:56] doth not wisdom cry
[17:58] and understanding put forth her voice
[18:01] she standeth in the top of high places
[18:03] by the way in the places of past she
[18:05] crieth at the gates at the entry of the
[18:07] city at the coming into the doors unto
[18:09] you o men I call my voice to the sons of
[18:12] man so now we're being introduced to a
[18:15] person called wisdom amen that this is a
[18:18] a a manifestation or portrayal of wisdom
[18:22] and wisdom that is expressed and
[18:24] feminine she cries she calleth and if we
[18:28] go over to verse 22 we'll pick up more
[18:31] of this understanding of who this wisdom
[18:34] is
[18:35] uh chapter 8 verse 22 the Lord possessed
[18:39] me in the beginning of his way this is
[18:41] the same the same one Speaking the same
[18:43] voice the Lord possessed me in the
[18:45] beginning of his way before his works of
[18:47] old I was set up from Everlasting from
[18:50] the beginning wherever the Earth was
[18:51] when there was no depths I was brought
[18:53] forth when there was no fountains
[18:55] abounding with the wall with water
[18:57] before the mountains were settled before
[18:59] the hills was I brought forth while as
[19:02] yet he had not made the Earth nor the
[19:04] fields nor the highest part of the Dust
[19:06] of the world when he prepared the
[19:08] heavens I was there when he set a
[19:10] compass upon the face of the death when
[19:12] he established the clouds above when the
[19:14] strength in The Fountains of the deep
[19:16] when he gave the sea is decree that the
[19:18] water should not pass his commandment
[19:20] when he appointed the foundations of the
[19:22] earth then I was by him as one brought
[19:25] up with him and I was daily his Delight
[19:28] rejoicing always before him this is the
[19:30] scripture brother Brennan refers to when
[19:32] he says I could see that little logo
[19:33] it's like a polar fire playing at the
[19:36] feet of God like a child
[19:38] and you look at this scripture in in the
[19:41] scripture he's actually referring to
[19:43] this person called wisdom
[19:45] which we can see is a is a manifestation
[19:48] of the word amen
[19:50] amen so let's keep reading here
[19:52] let's read verse 30 again then I was by
[19:55] him as one brought up with him and I was
[19:57] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[19:59] before him rejoicing in the habitable
[20:02] parts of his Earth and my Delights were
[20:04] with the sons of men now therefore
[20:06] hearken unto me owe you children for
[20:08] blessed are they that keep my ways hear
[20:11] instruction and be wise and refuse it
[20:13] not blessed is the man that heareth me
[20:15] watching daily at my Gates waiting at
[20:17] the post of my doors for who so findeth
[20:20] me findeth life
[20:22] and shall obtain favor of the Lord but
[20:24] he that sinneth against me wrong with
[20:26] his own soul all they that hate me love
[20:29] death
[20:30] so this is this is a an expression of
[20:33] the word of God Amen and it's called
[20:35] wisdom and wisdom is referred to in the
[20:37] feminine and we see that this wisdom
[20:40] comes from God it's actually an
[20:42] expression of the word of God and so
[20:44] there's an expression here that's in
[20:46] feminine amen but it's wisdom it's the
[20:48] one that was with God that was there to
[20:50] establish all the deep that was there
[20:52] before anything else was there
[20:55] so God is expressed in both male and
[20:58] female and here comes an expression of
[20:59] the word called wisdom and it's in the
[21:02] form of she amen not a second person not
[21:05] a different person but just an
[21:06] expression
[21:08] amen because we see in the Christ and we
[21:10] see with Adam amen that which comes out
[21:13] of the mail is a female amen what come
[21:15] out of Adam was feminine what come what
[21:17] come out of Christ is his bride and here
[21:19] when the word comes forth he's
[21:21] expressing it in feminine and then he'll
[21:23] take that word and he'll put it in body
[21:24] form of a son and express it masculine
[21:27] but within the masculine is also the
[21:29] feminine and when he brings out of the
[21:31] masculine in another expression it's
[21:33] feminine
[21:34] so God can be expressed in male and
[21:37] female
[21:38] God is expressing himself amen by that
[21:41] which comes out of him United back to
[21:43] him and all of these things are
[21:44] expressing God so the things that we see
[21:47] are here to express or they're Shadows
[21:49] of greater things greater truths amen
[21:52] so God is expressed in male and female
[21:54] let's go back to Genesis 17.
[22:01] just want to keep establishing this this
[22:04] understanding as we move forward
[22:06] Genesis 17
[22:10] and verse 1 Genesis 17 and 1 and when
[22:14] Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[22:16] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[22:19] the almighty God walk before me and be
[22:22] thou perfect
[22:23] this word almighty God is actually El
[22:26] Shaddai
[22:28] and here's what brother Brown says about
[22:29] El Shaddai he said in Genesis 17 he is
[22:32] Abraham's nursing breast
[22:35] El Shaddai but when his life was gone
[22:37] from him God said a man a hundred years
[22:39] old how will this thing be I am old my
[22:42] wife is old how can these things be he
[22:45] said I am El Shaddai
[22:47] now L is the and the Shaddai is breast
[22:50] and Shaddai is plural which means I am
[22:52] the breasted God like a baby that's
[22:55] fretting and sick and his strength is
[22:57] gone from it lean upon the mother's
[22:59] bosom and nurse his strength back sure
[23:02] when it's nursing it's not fretting no
[23:04] more at the mother's breath it's
[23:05] satisfied while it's getting its
[23:07] strength so we see now God is is is
[23:10] referring to himself as the breasted God
[23:13] because God is expressed in male and
[23:15] female
[23:16] amen now in the message thirst brother
[23:19] Graham says notice Jerusalem the word
[23:21] Jerusalem is from above he's speaking of
[23:23] New Jerusalem and the Bible said which
[23:25] we are is the mother of us all and
[23:27] Christ is our mother we realize that God
[23:29] is our mother for we are born of him
[23:32] so God is both father and mother amen
[23:35] he's expressing himself in these he
[23:37] tells Jerusalem I would have how often I
[23:40] would have hovered you as a hen does her
[23:42] chicks amen he's speaking as a mother
[23:43] hen guards over text that's what I would
[23:45] have done for you he's expressing
[23:47] himself both in masculine and in
[23:49] feminine
[23:51] amen
[23:52] so this is this is important to
[23:54] understand as we move down through the
[23:56] Bible and actually get into the subject
[23:58] that we want to get into the value amen
[24:00] the value or or I don't know if I said
[24:03] value or what did I say the great value
[24:06] of the feminine attribute
[24:08] so I want to look at a couple quotes
[24:10] here brother Brown says and questions
[24:12] and answers on Genesis back in 1953 so
[24:15] when God took from his side a piece of
[24:17] him a rib and made a woman now where did
[24:19] he get the spirit woman he said in
[24:22] Genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in
[24:24] our image after our own likeness created
[24:27] he he them man male and female he made
[24:31] the Burly spirit for the man he made the
[24:33] tender little delicate finished spirit
[24:35] for the woman and when you see a woman
[24:37] acting like a man she's got out of her
[24:39] place you see and in the beginning she's
[24:42] supposed to I think it's a shame that a
[24:43] woman has lost her dainty feminist place
[24:45] it's a disgrace
[24:47] further down in Jehovah Jireh from 1964
[24:50] he says God's spirit Cuts see the body
[24:53] the bride of Christ has to come right
[24:55] back to the first
[24:57] now what was Eve her and Adam were the
[25:00] same they were called Adam they were
[25:02] Spirit when he formed man the first time
[25:04] he made him in his own image and God is
[25:06] a spirit
[25:07] in the image of God created him male and
[25:10] female created he them he said and then
[25:13] still there was no man to till the soil
[25:15] and God formed Man Out of the Dust of
[25:17] the earth and put his dual spirit in him
[25:19] and that was the first Adam so we know
[25:21] that Adam had both masculine and
[25:24] feminine in him amen but God was going
[25:26] to separate it out into two expressions
[25:29] that were to be unified and be won
[25:32] expressing male and female amen
[25:35] so I want to go on just a little bit
[25:37] further with a couple more quotes he
[25:39] says now and then when Adam come and
[25:42] then Adam looked Lonesome so he took a
[25:44] rib from his side and made Eve a
[25:46] byproduct for him
[25:48] and and he'd taken the finished Spirit
[25:50] out of Adam and put it in the woman the
[25:52] love Spirit feminist kind gentle and he
[25:55] left the masculine spirit in Adam now if
[25:57] there's anything different there's a
[25:58] perversion somewhere now and then the
[26:00] two was one
[26:02] so when God when God had a main man in
[26:06] his own image male and female he created
[26:08] to them this dual Spirit was within Adam
[26:11] amen but but God said it's not good that
[26:14] man shall dwell alone I will make a help
[26:15] meet for him so he pulled out of him
[26:18] amen a rib to make the the Flesh of the
[26:21] woman but he pulled and separated that
[26:23] spirit that feminist Spirit from Adam
[26:25] amen and put it in the woman and then he
[26:27] United the two back together and he said
[26:30] it was very good and so we see that God
[26:33] intends for the feminist Spirit the
[26:36] feminist nature to be expressed
[26:39] God wants it to be expressed God
[26:42] intended for it to be expressed amen
[26:45] that's why and and the day we live in
[26:47] there's been such an attack on what
[26:49] truly is feminine what truly uh does it
[26:52] mean to be a woman the lines have been
[26:54] blurred and brother Ben said that's a
[26:55] perversion that's not what God wanted
[26:57] when God separated it he wanted a
[26:59] masculine expression and a feminine
[27:01] expression he did not want them to melt
[27:04] into one
[27:05] he did not want them to move nearer to
[27:08] one another where a woman would become
[27:09] masculine and a man would become
[27:11] feminine that's not God's intention
[27:13] God's intention was to make man after
[27:16] his image and then that man would
[27:17] Express God upon the Earth and in that
[27:20] expression God would see to it that he
[27:22] would separate the feminist out into a
[27:24] form called woman and the masculine in a
[27:27] form called man and God wanted it to be
[27:29] that way and he wants them both to be
[27:31] expressed
[27:34] so that's why the male has to be
[27:37] expressed and the female has to be
[27:39] expressed
[27:40] and that's what I want to get into as we
[27:43] go on this expression of the feminine
[27:46] and so that's why he says there's a
[27:48] perversion there's a mix up something's
[27:50] wrong God this this laodicean age this
[27:53] perversion that we walk in amen it's
[27:56] absolutely contrary to the nature of God
[27:59] Amen but it's perfectly come to Satan's
[28:01] Eden because Satan is trying to distort
[28:03] everything that's God so nobody gets a
[28:05] clear image of God anymore
[28:07] and then it becomes wrong to stick with
[28:10] God
[28:11] now you become wrong if you if you
[28:13] really believe that there's a
[28:15] distinction in the Sexes and and that
[28:17] they're meant to be separated and remain
[28:19] separated and not to blend back into one
[28:22] another amen and and tell a girl you can
[28:24] be anything you want to be you can do
[28:26] this and a boy you can do anything you
[28:27] want to be and no that's not what God
[28:30] wants
[28:32] that's not what he intended from the
[28:34] beginning it's not God's desire he
[28:37] wanted a woman to be feminist loving
[28:39] dainty kind gentle all these things the
[28:42] prophet uses and he wants the man to be
[28:45] burly
[28:46] not brutish but rugged early a masculine
[28:50] man
[28:51] that's what God wants
[28:53] and I just want to I don't have this in
[28:55] my notes but I just want to go on and
[28:56] say the world we live in everything in
[28:59] the world is structured to deform this
[29:03] all right not just the social uh
[29:06] constraints and the social the the
[29:07] common thinking of the day the education
[29:10] system and all of that it's not just
[29:12] that but brother Branham was very clear
[29:14] to tell us amen that men are becoming
[29:17] sisified I'll just use his language
[29:20] and women are becoming more masculine
[29:23] and brother Branham tied it to the
[29:25] hybridization of food
[29:29] that's amazing to me
[29:31] but if I'm tied it to the hybrid he said
[29:33] it's mixing up the genes the cells are
[29:36] changing
[29:37] because of food and that's why when we
[29:39] bow our heads to pray it's not just a
[29:41] ritual it's not just a tradition because
[29:42] this world is perverted in every way the
[29:46] Earth has been perverted farming has
[29:47] been perverted why has it been perverted
[29:49] because of lust because of greed
[29:53] farming practices have perverted
[29:55] everything's perverted amen everything's
[29:57] marketing everything's for profit and
[29:58] all greed is driving all of these things
[30:01] and it's driven by an evil spirit
[30:05] so what are we going to do I I don't
[30:07] know what else to do but go to the store
[30:09] and buy the food and go to the
[30:10] restaurant do what we do but I know one
[30:12] thing I can bow my head and say God I'm
[30:14] going to need help with this meal that
[30:15] I'm eating because this world has been
[30:17] perverted by mankind
[30:19] because it's actually changing something
[30:22] in the natural side of man
[30:26] that's why I think when we see those
[30:29] things creep up amen where where you see
[30:31] a little bit of a feminist nature and a
[30:33] boy or a little bit masculine a girl I
[30:36] would be careful not to hammer on that
[30:38] too hard
[30:39] because it may be the perversion of food
[30:43] I say what that needs is some prayer for
[30:45] deliverance and say God
[30:47] maybe maybe there's an effect here of
[30:51] the of the natural world around us God
[30:53] we need a healing we need a deliverance
[30:55] we need you to come on the scene and
[30:57] make what you called masking and masking
[30:59] what you call feminist feminists
[31:02] amen
[31:03] so when some people say I just can't
[31:05] help but I feel this way they may be
[31:07] speaking the truth
[31:09] that may be true according what the
[31:11] prophet told us
[31:12] but what we need to realize is it
[31:14] doesn't have to stay that way he's still
[31:16] the great healer the I am the deliverer
[31:18] the one who can change all circumstances
[31:22] he's the god that healeth all your
[31:24] diseases
[31:25] if food creates a perversion he can he
[31:28] can take care of that
[31:30] amen
[31:31] so the world is all structured to to
[31:34] corrupt this image of God expressed as
[31:38] male and female
[31:40] amen but God has really uh preserved it
[31:44] and he's restored it in our day
[31:46] he says in the message choosing of a
[31:49] bride
[31:50] now we find in the beginning man and
[31:53] woman were put on co-equal terms they
[31:56] were to be one they were to rule and
[31:58] Reign together as one
[32:01] but then uh but then the woman was
[32:05] brought brother bear says as a byproduct
[32:07] right he explains to us how she came
[32:09] differently than every other woman in
[32:11] creation and she came from the rib she
[32:13] was made out of what was already made
[32:15] and she was fashioned now that that's
[32:17] what he means by byproduct and then
[32:19] within her spirit amen she's got the
[32:22] original part of Adam's Spirit which was
[32:24] meant to be female but the flesh was the
[32:27] byproduct for him
[32:28] and brother Brown says she was made this
[32:30] way because God knew there would be a
[32:32] fall and he made her in such a way that
[32:34] she was capable of falling
[32:36] we understand this
[32:38] and so that fall began to change
[32:40] something and the co-equal status as far
[32:43] as flesh is concerned
[32:45] I really want to be clear on that I'm
[32:48] speaking as far as flesh and Earthly
[32:50] walk and Earthly existence is concerned
[32:52] I'm not talking about the soul
[32:57] amen
[32:59] and there's reason I want to get into
[33:01] that because I feel like sometimes
[33:03] because of misunderstandings about
[33:06] headship and misunderstandings about
[33:08] masculinity and feminine what God wants
[33:11] to be feminist because of that amen
[33:14] there's there's there can be a
[33:17] legalistic strict structure and when the
[33:19] actual the feminist spirit is actually
[33:21] suppressed under the male spirit
[33:24] but God wants that feminine Spirit to
[33:27] express
[33:27] he meant for it to be so the only reason
[33:30] that she was placed under headship she
[33:32] was placed under headship for this life
[33:34] because of the Fall
[33:37] that's what brother bear says in the
[33:38] message choosing of a brine she was not
[33:41] in the original creation all other
[33:42] females is in the original creation bird
[33:45] male female animals male and female but
[33:48] in human life God only made a man and he
[33:50] took from him and a woman is the
[33:52] byproduct of a man because God did not
[33:55] Institute such a thing search the
[33:57] scriptures exactly right God no sir in
[33:59] his original creation she was put out
[34:01] there
[34:02] but then listen what he says but if she
[34:05] can hold herself right
[34:07] what a greater reward she has than a man
[34:11] why because God knows the structure of a
[34:15] woman in this Earthly form in human form
[34:17] she was the byproduct made in a way that
[34:20] could be deceived and could be
[34:22] susceptible to the fall so now if she
[34:25] can hold herself being born in this
[34:26] flesh under this corruption if she can
[34:28] hold herself in the right way she can
[34:31] have a greater reward than the man can
[34:33] because the man wasn't built that way
[34:35] that makes sense
[34:37] so she can hold herself right what a
[34:40] greater reward she has than man she
[34:42] she's put on a testing ground through
[34:44] her come death she's guilty of all death
[34:47] but then God turned around and used one
[34:49] to bring life back again
[34:52] brought his son through the woman an
[34:54] obedient one so though the woman was
[34:57] what was in the fall brought the
[34:59] transgression and the degradation of
[35:01] humanity through hybridization amen one
[35:04] was used Amen to the to the the
[35:07] degeneration in the fall of Man but
[35:10] praise God God would use another woman
[35:12] amen born in flesh a woman and he would
[35:15] use her for the restoration process
[35:18] so God now when God placed the woman
[35:21] under man's headship he's no longer
[35:24] saying I'm only going to use the mail
[35:26] I'm only going to use the male
[35:27] expression I'm only going to uh express
[35:29] myself through mail no he's still going
[35:31] to use the female to express himself
[35:34] and he's still going to use one to bring
[35:36] forth the promised son
[35:39] praise God
[35:41] let's look at First Corinthians chapter
[35:43] 11.
[35:53] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[36:04] First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 9.
[36:14] foreign
[36:16] in First Corinthians 11 9 says when
[36:19] no I'm sorry I'm in second Corinthians
[36:22] let me go to First Corinthians
[36:24] chapter 11 verse 9.
[36:27] neither was the Man created for the
[36:29] woman but the woman for the man for this
[36:32] cause ought the woman to have power on
[36:33] her head because of the Angels
[36:35] nevertheless neither is The Man Without
[36:37] The Woman neither the woman without the
[36:39] man in the Lord
[36:41] for as the woman is of the man even so
[36:44] is the man also by the woman but all
[36:47] things of God so God now has created a a
[36:51] a a a
[36:53] relationship where the woman come from
[36:55] the man but now in this earth man has
[36:57] come from the woman and God is still
[36:59] using the woman to bring forth amen his
[37:02] children upon the Earth right
[37:04] so so God God is still using both
[37:07] expressions
[37:09] I'd like to look at a few examples in
[37:11] the Bible and then I want to tie this
[37:12] together let's go to First Samuel
[37:14] chapter one
[37:15] and I'm just going to hit a couple of
[37:17] examples out of the Bible
[37:22] first Samuel
[37:24] and there's so many examples we
[37:26] certainly won't try to get to them all
[37:27] we may reference a few and not read the
[37:29] scriptures but we're going to read a
[37:30] couple scriptures of a couple
[37:32] of these and in first Samuel
[37:35] chapter 1
[37:37] verse 9. We're The Story of Hannah
[37:40] says so Hannah rose up after they had
[37:43] eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk
[37:44] now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by
[37:47] the post of the Temple of the Lord
[37:49] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[37:52] prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and
[37:54] she vowed a vow and said O Lord of hosts
[37:56] if thou will indeed look on the
[37:58] Affliction of thine handmaid and
[38:00] remember me and not forget thine
[38:02] handmaid but will give unto thine
[38:05] handmade a man-child then I will give
[38:07] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[38:09] life and there shall no razor come upon
[38:12] his head
[38:13] and it came to pass as she continued
[38:15] praying before the Lord that Eli marked
[38:17] her mouth now Hannah she spake in her
[38:20] heart only her lips moved but her voice
[38:22] was not her therefore Eli thought she
[38:24] had been drunken
[38:26] and Eli said unto her how long will thou
[38:28] be drunk and put away thine wine from
[38:31] thee and Hannah answered and said no my
[38:33] Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit I
[38:36] have drunk neither wine nor strong drink
[38:38] but have poured out my soul before the
[38:39] Lord count not thy hand made for a
[38:42] daughter of Belial for out of the
[38:44] abundance of my complaint and grief have
[38:46] I spoken hitherto then Eli answered and
[38:48] said go in peace and the god of Israel
[38:50] Grant thee thy petition that thou has
[38:53] asked of him and she said let thine
[38:56] handmaid find Grace in thy sight so the
[38:58] woman went her way and did eat and her
[39:00] countenance was no more sad
[39:02] so we see Hannah now is struggling with
[39:05] barrenness and in the struggle with
[39:07] baroness she goes into the temple and as
[39:09] she goes into the temple she is now
[39:11] praying and pouring her heart out to God
[39:13] and she makes a vow to God that if God
[39:16] would give her this man child she would
[39:18] give it back to him amen and she does
[39:20] all of this amen and then comes in
[39:23] contact with Eli and you realize that
[39:25] God is expressing something through
[39:27] Hannah Hannah has a husband but God's
[39:29] not going straight to the husband he's
[39:31] expressing something through Hannah
[39:34] we see this all the way through the
[39:36] Bible and let's look at verse 19. let's
[39:39] read a little bit further
[39:41] and they arose up in the morning early
[39:43] in worship before the Lord and returned
[39:45] and came to their house in Rhema
[39:47] and elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the
[39:50] Lord remembered her
[39:52] wherefore it came to pass when the time
[39:54] was come about after hanac conceived
[39:57] that she bear a son and called his name
[40:00] Samuel saying because I have asked him
[40:01] of the Lord and the man elkana and all
[40:04] his house went up to offer unto the Lord
[40:06] the yearly sacrifice and his vow but
[40:09] Hannah went not up for she said unto her
[40:12] husband I will not go up until the child
[40:15] be weaned and then I will bring him that
[40:17] he may appear before the Lord and there
[40:20] abide forever and Elkin her husband said
[40:24] unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry
[40:26] until thou have weaned him only the Lord
[40:28] establish his word so the woman Abode
[40:31] and gave her son suck until she had
[40:33] weaned him
[40:34] I love this story because we're planted
[40:36] right in the Old Testament right under
[40:38] the patriarchal system right under the
[40:41] headship through the tribes and
[40:42] everything in Israel but in this story
[40:44] Hannah is is crying out to God to
[40:48] deliver her for bareness and she's she's
[40:50] vowing a vow to God and this is all
[40:52] taking place between Hannah and God now
[40:54] Eli the priest the high priest sees it
[40:57] he puts a blessing upon her she goes to
[40:59] her home amen and and and she conceives
[41:02] because God remembered her
[41:06] and then when it comes time to worship
[41:08] amen when it comes time to go she told
[41:10] her husband I'll not go until the child
[41:13] is weaned then I'll take the child and
[41:16] deliver him deliver him there amen she's
[41:19] the one decreeing she's the one saying
[41:22] she's the one with the vision she was
[41:24] the one with the prayer she's the one
[41:25] who got the blessing she's the one God
[41:27] remembered
[41:30] but then her her husband Elkin in his
[41:32] wisdom amen he could have stopped that
[41:34] because he's the head but in his wisdom
[41:36] he recognized that this is God he
[41:39] recognized that this thing is of God and
[41:41] he says amen he says do all that is in
[41:44] your heart
[41:45] let's see what he says verse 23 in Elk
[41:47] and our husband said unto her do what
[41:49] seemeth thee good
[41:51] tarry until thou have weaned him only
[41:53] the Lord establishes word so the woman
[41:55] Abode so now elkana he recognizes that
[41:59] there's something going on here that's
[42:00] God Amen he could assure usurp his
[42:03] authority he could say though that's my
[42:05] child you can't give my child away oh
[42:08] Hannah did all of this amen and when
[42:11] Hannah expressed it all her husband says
[42:13] do what seemeth good
[42:16] I think I find these things amazing
[42:18] friends because sometimes they twist up
[42:20] our understanding
[42:22] because God God you know when it comes
[42:25] to the soul realm amen there's no dis
[42:29] equaling between the male and female
[42:32] when it comes to God it's only in this
[42:34] Natural Life
[42:36] amen God has put a woman under
[42:38] protection
[42:40] I want to go to first Samuel 25.
[42:45] I said I just want to hit a couple of
[42:47] examples
[42:49] and we know them well but I want to read
[42:51] through just a couple
[42:53] first Samuel chapter 25.
[42:57] and we'll read verse 23 and and and
[42:59] first Samuel amen nabel is a wicked man
[43:03] and he refuses David's request and
[43:05] David's going down he's strapping a
[43:07] sword he's going down to wipe out the
[43:09] household of nabel and he's coming down
[43:10] in righteous judgment but the wife of
[43:13] nabel is Abigail and she's a righteous
[43:15] woman and she's going to approach unto
[43:17] David and look at what she says here in
[43:19] verse 23. and when Abigail saw David she
[43:22] hastened and lighted off the ass and
[43:24] fell before David on her face and bowed
[43:26] herself to the ground and fell at his
[43:28] feet and said upon me my Lord upon me
[43:31] let this iniquity be and let thy
[43:33] handmaid I pray thee speak in thine
[43:35] audience and hear the words of thine
[43:37] handmaid let not my Lord I pray thee
[43:40] regard this man of Belial even nabel for
[43:43] as his name is so is nabel his name
[43:45] means fool
[43:47] is he is his name and Folly is with him
[43:50] but I I thine handmade Saul not the
[43:53] young men of my Lord whom thou did Sin
[43:55] now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth
[43:58] and as thy Soul liveth seeing the Lord
[44:00] hath withholden thee from coming to shed
[44:02] blood and from avenging thyself with
[44:04] thine own hand now let thine enemies and
[44:07] they that seek evil to my Lord be as
[44:10] Nable
[44:10] and now this blessing which thine
[44:12] handmaid hath brought unto my Lord let
[44:15] it even be given unto the young men that
[44:16] follow my Lord I pray thee forgive the
[44:19] trespass of thine handmade for the Lord
[44:21] will certainly make my Lord a sure house
[44:23] because my Lord fighteth the battles of
[44:26] the Lord and evil hath not been found in
[44:28] thee all the days
[44:30] yet a man has risen to pursue pursue
[44:32] thee and to seek thy soul but the soul
[44:35] of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle
[44:37] of life with the Lord thy God listen she
[44:40] is absolutely speaking the truth
[44:43] she is speaking the word amen
[44:46] so that but the soul of my Lord shall be
[44:49] bound in the bundle of life with the
[44:50] Lord thy God and the soul of thine
[44:53] enemies them shall he sling out as out
[44:55] of the middle of a sling and it shall
[44:58] come to pass when the Lord shall have
[44:59] done to my Lord according to all the
[45:01] good that he has spoken concerning thee
[45:03] and shall have appointed the ruler over
[45:06] Israel that this shall be no grief unto
[45:08] thee nor offensive heart unto my Lord
[45:11] neither that thou has shed blood
[45:13] causeless or that my Lord hath Avenged
[45:15] himself but when the Lord shall have
[45:17] dealt with with my Lord then remember
[45:20] thine handmade and David said to Abigail
[45:23] blessed be the Lord God of Israel which
[45:26] sent thee this day to meet me
[45:29] well now David is recognizing this isn't
[45:33] just this woman God sent you here
[45:35] let's read the skin and David said to
[45:37] Abigail blessed be the Lord God of
[45:39] Israel David is a prophet
[45:42] David is ordained to be a King David is
[45:45] wise he's the great Psalm writer amen
[45:47] and here he recognizes that God is
[45:50] speaking to him through this woman
[45:52] let's read on
[45:54] David uh reads 32 again and David said
[45:57] to Abigail blessed be the Lord God of
[45:58] Israel which sent thee this day to meet
[46:01] me
[46:02] and blessed be thy advice
[46:06] I love this who's giving advice to David
[46:09] a woman
[46:11] and blessed be thy advise and blessed be
[46:13] thou which has kept me this day from
[46:16] coming to shed blood and from amending
[46:18] myself with my own hand
[46:23] when she begins to speak she begins to
[46:25] recognize in the wisdom that God had
[46:27] granted her she began to recognize that
[46:29] David surely is coming to be king amen
[46:32] and God will take care of all David's
[46:34] enemies but don't let this be an offense
[46:36] and don't let this be a grief that you
[46:38] came and you shed blood amen you realize
[46:40] up to now David has shed no blood of his
[46:43] Israelite Brethren only Philistines this
[46:45] would be the first time that Abigail had
[46:47] not stood in the Gap and not preserved
[46:50] him his reputation and his kingdom
[46:54] God was working through her Amen to save
[46:58] David though there'd be no grief and no
[47:00] offense to David when he comes into his
[47:02] kingdom
[47:04] and David recognized it he said God be
[47:07] blessed the God who sent you to speak to
[47:09] me this day amen and and thank God for
[47:12] your advice
[47:15] amen I love when this pops up in the Old
[47:18] Testament we find all the way through
[47:20] the Bible God has used both the male and
[47:23] female expression
[47:25] it's never been one-sided with God God
[47:27] is not ashamed to speak through the lips
[47:29] of a woman God is not ashamed to give
[47:31] wisdom to a woman amen God and why
[47:34] because in the end time we know God is
[47:36] going to raise up a woman and she's
[47:37] going to have something to say
[47:40] so God has been expressing it all down
[47:42] through the Bible
[47:44] now let's go to second Samuel 20.
[47:53] joab has come and encompassed about a
[47:55] city and he's going to destroy a city
[47:57] because a rebel a rebel from the house
[48:00] of Saul who's rebelling against David
[48:02] had entered in
[48:03] and we see that there's going to be a
[48:04] woman who saves the city second Samuel
[48:07] 20.
[48:09] verse 19.
[48:13] this woman begins to call to joab from
[48:16] the wall and she says I am one of them
[48:18] that are Peaceable and faithful in
[48:19] Israel thou seek us to destroy a city
[48:22] and a mother in Israel why wilt thou
[48:25] swallow up the inheritance of the Lord
[48:27] and job answered and said far be it far
[48:30] be it from me that I should swallow up
[48:32] or destroy the matter is not so but a
[48:35] man of Mount Ephraim Sheba the son of
[48:37] bikrai by name hath lifted up his hand
[48:40] against the king even against David
[48:42] deliver him only and I will depart from
[48:44] the city and the woman said to joab
[48:47] behold his head shall be thrown to thee
[48:49] over the wall
[48:50] then the woman went into all the people
[48:52] in her wisdom
[48:54] and they cut off the head of Sheba the
[48:56] son of Vikram and cast it out to joab
[48:59] and he blew the trumpet and retired from
[49:01] the city every man to his tent and job
[49:04] returned to Jerusalem unto the king
[49:06] now here they come into a city was there
[49:08] was there no wise man in there but God
[49:11] allowed it that there was a woman with
[49:12] wisdom begins to cry out say joab why
[49:15] are you destroying the inheritance of
[49:17] God why are you doing this and joy
[49:19] begins to tell and she says his head
[49:21] will be thrown over the wall before she
[49:23] speaks to anybody
[49:25] then it says she goes in her wisdom
[49:30] my I thought everything had to come
[49:33] by the Kings by the governor no here's a
[49:36] wise woman that is saving the city
[49:40] it goes to show God's not only going to
[49:43] use the mail God's going to use the
[49:45] female also he did All Through the Bible
[49:48] he used both
[49:50] praise God
[49:51] remember Naomi when it came time for
[49:54] Redemption Naomi was the one who came up
[49:56] with the plan
[49:57] Naomi instructed Ruth Ruth followed
[50:00] Naomi's instructions and then Boaz was
[50:03] the only one who can bring Redemption
[50:05] amen but but Naomi knew how to move Boaz
[50:08] to get the Boaz to take his place and it
[50:10] came through the wisdom of Naomi
[50:13] so Naomi gave the instructions Ruth
[50:15] acted out the instructions Boaz played
[50:17] the part of the Kinsmen Redeemer
[50:19] we see this all through the Bible
[50:21] remember when abimelech amen the the son
[50:23] of Gideon he raised up through deception
[50:26] and became a judge who was it the
[50:28] destroyed a Bimal act it was a woman and
[50:30] a tower who cast a piece of millstone
[50:32] out of the tower amen and broke his
[50:34] skull
[50:35] Deliverance come by a woman
[50:38] praise God
[50:39] I love how all these things are in the
[50:41] Bible
[50:42] when we come to the New Testament we
[50:45] enter into the New Testament and God now
[50:47] begins to deal amen through the New
[50:50] Testament Church the confirmation of the
[50:52] promise amen when he comes to Mary a
[50:56] angel visits Mary and speaks the word to
[50:58] Mary and Mary receives the word and then
[51:01] when she runs over to tell amen when she
[51:04] runs over to tell her cousin Elizabeth
[51:05] immediately when she gave a salutation
[51:08] to Elizabeth the Babe jumped within her
[51:10] she was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[51:12] she begins to prophesy
[51:15] amen the first recorded prophecy we have
[51:18] in the New Testament is Elizabeth
[51:19] prophesying
[51:22] and then as soon as she's done
[51:24] prophesying Mary begins to prophesy
[51:28] praise God
[51:30] God is good
[51:32] let's look at Luke chapter 2.
[51:43] Luke chapter 2.
[51:53] and verse 36.
[51:56] foreign
[52:01] chapter 2 verse 36 and there was Anna a
[52:05] prophet is the daughter of fanuel of the
[52:08] tribe of Asser she was of a great agent
[52:11] and lived with a husband seven years
[52:12] from her virginity and she was a widow
[52:14] of about four score and four years which
[52:16] departed not from the temple but served
[52:18] god with fastings and prayers night and
[52:20] day and she came in that instant giving
[52:22] thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake
[52:25] of him to all them that looked for
[52:27] redemption in Jerusalem
[52:29] amen when Jesus was brought into the
[52:31] temple Simeon amen the priest he comes
[52:34] and he knew the Lord would not let him
[52:36] depart till he sees the Lord's the
[52:38] salvation and deliverance but there was
[52:39] another one there there was a woman a
[52:41] prophetess by the name of Anna she was
[52:43] led by the spirit brother Branham says
[52:45] to come and find Jesus and also to
[52:47] Proclaim to all who wanted redemption in
[52:49] Israel
[52:50] she was proclaiming the prophecy now was
[52:53] fulfilled not just Simeon but Anna as
[52:55] well
[52:56] amen so we can see that God is being
[53:00] expressed in male and female let's go to
[53:01] Genesis 16.
[53:04] there's so many things in each one of
[53:06] these stories we could elaborate on but
[53:07] I just don't want to take the time
[53:09] because I want to keep moving with the
[53:10] thought that I have
[53:17] foreign
[53:21] you see when God now he wants to express
[53:24] himself in male and female and this is
[53:27] God's Design This is God's desire amen
[53:30] and you'll find that's why when God
[53:32] through his we know through his uh not
[53:35] his perfect will but his permissive will
[53:37] when he allowed children to be born the
[53:39] way they are I mean it's even perfectly
[53:41] timed and God's permissive will because
[53:43] you have to have two parts to bring life
[53:46] you have to have male and female a male
[53:49] alone can't do it a female alone can't
[53:51] do it but when the male and female come
[53:53] together amen even in God's permissive
[53:55] will it can produce life amen so so the
[53:58] man has the life he has the seed he has
[54:01] the the the the the gene of life but
[54:03] there must come in contact with the
[54:05] female also so that the she becomes the
[54:08] betting ground of life and then life can
[54:10] come forth
[54:11] so so God Is So structured it that way
[54:14] and then God wants an expression in this
[54:17] holy Union in this marriage of male and
[54:19] female that's why God didn't make us the
[54:22] same that he didn't put two of the same
[54:24] together he put a male and a female
[54:26] together because together it's an
[54:28] expression when they come together in
[54:30] unity it's an expression of God it's a
[54:32] better expression
[54:34] it's a richer more full expression
[54:36] that's why when you see the that the
[54:38] enemy has worked so hard to break apart
[54:40] families through divorce and separation
[54:42] why because it's never right
[54:45] it's never right and some people find
[54:47] themselves in circumstances because of
[54:50] sin because of the Fall now there's a
[54:52] this plague has broke out among human
[54:55] beings and death now is set in so some
[54:57] people were raised in a single parent
[54:59] home because of death some because of
[55:01] divorce some because of all of these
[55:03] other circumstances but it's never right
[55:06] amen it's never exactly right and I know
[55:08] because I grew up that way my parents
[55:10] were divorced when I was five years old
[55:12] so I know what I'm talking about amen
[55:15] it's not exactly right
[55:18] because God wants to bring two together
[55:21] to express one and that expression
[55:23] together in unity is a fuller expression
[55:26] of God it takes both sides it takes the
[55:29] masculine and the feminine side
[55:32] to raise up children to be balanced
[55:34] healthy children amen it doesn't that's
[55:36] that's just the natural course of life
[55:38] and if you find yourself in that way God
[55:40] can help God can intervene God can
[55:41] deliver but just a natural course of
[55:43] life God brought together a male and a
[55:46] female to express masculine and feminist
[55:48] to nurture up and raise these children
[55:53] and that's why we have such issues we
[55:55] have because that picture is broken so
[55:57] often in a home
[55:59] so often that is destroyed and you have
[56:03] people like myself and others
[56:05] generationally now we've grown up
[56:07] without this picture
[56:11] and it's taken an effect on society
[56:14] people are not balanced and I'm not
[56:16] talking spiritual I'm talking just
[56:17] natural things just a natural human
[56:20] being they're not balanced even in their
[56:22] understanding of the world they're not
[56:24] logically thinking they're not they
[56:26] don't have what we used to call Common
[56:28] Sense
[56:30] and it's not just the broken home it's
[56:32] so many things that mix in together but
[56:34] it all goes to paint the picture but
[56:36] what God wanted he wanted an expression
[56:38] of male and female and these children to
[56:40] be raised in that kind of home that's
[56:42] under his permissive will that's what he
[56:43] set up
[56:45] whenever you break what God has set up
[56:47] whatever you break it it's going to be
[56:50] deformed it's going to have problems
[56:55] so
[56:56] we we have to recognize that God Did It
[56:58] for a reason God wants it that way
[57:00] so that means also in the home
[57:03] there must be an expression of masculine
[57:06] and feminist
[57:07] I mean it makes sense it's so easy to
[57:11] see but but sometimes if we don't
[57:14] respect one another
[57:16] if the if the husband doesn't respect
[57:18] his wife and the wife doesn't respect
[57:20] his husband you can have one that'll
[57:22] trample over the expression of the other
[57:26] or limit or quiet the expression of
[57:29] another
[57:30] you can have a dominant woman and a
[57:33] dominant woman brother Branham says a
[57:35] dominating female he said is the
[57:36] greatest curse the Earth has ever seen
[57:39] that's what he says
[57:41] and you can have a woman that would
[57:42] Dominate and dominate her husband her
[57:44] husband would check out that's his fault
[57:45] he should have never done and he should
[57:46] have held his place but now amen you've
[57:49] got a perversion of female and you've
[57:51] got an absence of true masculine
[57:54] and that's not going to work
[57:56] but then you can also have a man who
[57:58] becomes too dominant in his role of
[58:00] headship and he silences his wife
[58:04] she has no right to protest she can't
[58:06] question his authority she can't ask him
[58:08] anything and all of a sudden he quiets
[58:11] her amen and now limits her and she
[58:13] becomes withdrawn under his uh
[58:16] domineering legalistic not a not a true
[58:18] masculine man but an overbearing man who
[58:21] who doesn't respect the feminist spirit
[58:23] and pulls back now that's going to have
[58:26] problems in that home as well
[58:29] because God wants both to be expressed
[58:33] those little kids need to see both
[58:34] expressed just like the world needs to
[58:36] see both expressed
[58:39] so we see we have to respect one another
[58:43] and we have to respect what God made one
[58:45] another in in Who We Are
[58:48] let's go to Genesis 16.
[58:52] let's look at verse one I want to look
[58:55] at Abraham and Sarah
[59:03] in Genesis 16 1 now Sarah Abram's wife
[59:06] Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children
[59:09] and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose
[59:12] name was haggar and Sarah I said unto
[59:14] Abram behold now the Lord hath
[59:16] restrained me from bearing
[59:18] I pray that you go into my maid it may
[59:20] be that I may uh I may obtain children
[59:23] by her and Abram hearkened to the voice
[59:26] of Sarah
[59:28] so he listened to his wife
[59:31] let's go over to Genesis 21 now
[59:35] just 21 verse 9.
[59:43] now in Genesis 21 verse 9 it says and
[59:46] Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian
[59:49] which he had borne unto Abraham mocking
[59:51] wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out
[59:54] this Bond woman and her son for the son
[59:57] of this Bond woman shall not be Heir
[59:58] with my son even with Isaac and the
[1:00:01] thing was very Grievous in Abraham's
[1:00:03] sight because of his son
[1:00:05] all right let's think about this now
[1:00:08] Sarah gave advice before and she advised
[1:00:12] him to take Hagar he hearkened to the
[1:00:15] voice of Sariah's wife and now Ishmael
[1:00:18] was born but now that Isaac is born amen
[1:00:21] there's been a transformation in Sarah
[1:00:23] Isaac now is born and and now as she
[1:00:27] sees the son of the Bond woman Ishmael
[1:00:29] mocking and now she makes another
[1:00:32] suggestion she makes another decree to
[1:00:35] Abraham and said cast out the son of the
[1:00:37] Bond woman
[1:00:39] let's read it again
[1:00:41] cast out this Bond woman and her son for
[1:00:44] the son of this Bond woman shall not be
[1:00:46] Heir with my son even with Isaac and
[1:00:49] when Abraham first heard this advice he
[1:00:52] didn't like it
[1:00:54] do we agree
[1:00:56] and the thing was very Grievous in
[1:00:58] Abraham's sight because of his son and
[1:01:00] God said unto Abraham let it not be
[1:01:03] Grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[1:01:05] and because of the Bond woman and all
[1:01:08] that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken
[1:01:10] under her voice for an Isaac shall thy
[1:01:13] seed be called
[1:01:15] now God comes down and backs up Sarah
[1:01:20] has caught something amen and she begins
[1:01:23] to express it and says this will not be
[1:01:26] this son will not be heir of my son amen
[1:01:30] and the thing was Grievous to Abram
[1:01:31] Abraham didn't want to cast him out
[1:01:33] Abraham didn't want her to be right
[1:01:35] Abraham didn't want to listen to her
[1:01:38] but God came down and said hearken to
[1:01:41] the voice of Sarah
[1:01:42] she's right amen she was wrong before
[1:01:46] but she's right now
[1:01:48] and just because she was wrong before
[1:01:50] doesn't make her right now
[1:01:54] is that true
[1:01:57] it's gone
[1:01:58] and so right that the Apostle Paul in
[1:02:02] Galatians chapter 4 verse 30 he would
[1:02:05] pick up this phrase and in Galatians 4
[1:02:07] 30 it says never let us watch saith the
[1:02:11] scripture
[1:02:13] what saith the scripture cast out the
[1:02:17] Bond woman and her son for the son of
[1:02:19] the Bomberman shall not be Heir with the
[1:02:21] son of the free woman
[1:02:23] who spoke that scripture Sarah did all
[1:02:26] the way back here in Genesis
[1:02:29] so the the son of the Bond woman now
[1:02:32] Paul picks it up and God recognized
[1:02:35] Sarah told the truth God recognized that
[1:02:37] Abraham listened to it and even
[1:02:39] confirmed it all the way in the New
[1:02:41] Testament when the Apostle Paul picked
[1:02:42] it up and called it scripture saying
[1:02:46] so God God is not afraid to express
[1:02:51] himself in male and female
[1:02:54] just because he put the man in headship
[1:02:56] doesn't mean he's afraid to express
[1:02:58] himself through the woman
[1:02:59] and it doesn't mean the woman never has
[1:03:01] anything to say
[1:03:04] Abigail had something to say
[1:03:06] Hannah had something to say Sarah had
[1:03:08] something to say the wise woman that
[1:03:11] saved the city had something to say Amen
[1:03:13] Tamar had something to say something to
[1:03:15] do because Tamar was the one who saved
[1:03:17] Judah
[1:03:19] God is not ashamed to work through both
[1:03:23] praise God
[1:03:25] now
[1:03:27] I I don't want anybody to get the wrong
[1:03:30] impression that somehow we're trying to
[1:03:32] uh over over evaluate the women and get
[1:03:35] the women to take leadership that's not
[1:03:37] God's way
[1:03:39] but neither do we want to ignore God's
[1:03:41] way
[1:03:43] we want to walk in the middle of the
[1:03:44] road
[1:03:45] it would stay balanced in everything we
[1:03:47] do
[1:03:48] and the message marriage and divorce
[1:03:50] brother member says notice why did she
[1:03:52] do such a thing being in that high order
[1:03:54] he's speaking of Eve she was right with
[1:03:56] man co-equal with men but we all know
[1:03:58] now that she lost her co-equaleness with
[1:04:00] man when she sinned
[1:04:03] and God said man will be your ruler from
[1:04:05] here out now that's the scripture if you
[1:04:07] want to we could read it but remember
[1:04:09] saying now because of the Fall she's not
[1:04:12] co-equal in this life with man she is
[1:04:14] now under headship amen but it doesn't
[1:04:17] change the fact that she is within her
[1:04:19] expressing a nature and part of God
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] let's look at First Timothy chapter 2.
[1:04:31] see this in the scripture that brother
[1:04:33] Ben was referring to
[1:04:38] First Timothy chapter 2.
[1:04:45] verse 11.
[1:04:50] the scripture says let the women learn
[1:04:52] in Silence with all subjection
[1:04:54] but I suffered not a woman to teach nor
[1:04:56] to serve authority over the man but to
[1:04:59] be in silence for Adam was first form
[1:05:01] then Eve and Adam was not deceived but
[1:05:03] the woman being deceived was in the
[1:05:05] transgression and I was standing she
[1:05:07] shall be saved in childbearing if they
[1:05:09] continue in faith in charity and
[1:05:10] Holiness with sobriety
[1:05:12] so now the scripture is very clear
[1:05:15] brother Ben referred to this she is not
[1:05:17] to usurp Authority that's why a woman
[1:05:19] cannot handle the word cannot preach the
[1:05:21] word
[1:05:22] she cannot hold an office in the church
[1:05:24] amen because because those roles because
[1:05:27] of the Fall because she was deceived in
[1:05:29] the transgression she has been put
[1:05:31] underneath the headship of man for
[1:05:33] protection in the things of natural life
[1:05:36] and and for the order of the church amen
[1:05:39] God called for men to take leadership
[1:05:42] and headship in the church never a woman
[1:05:44] amen because that is contrary to God's
[1:05:46] Will and contrary to God's word because
[1:05:48] why because she was made in a way she
[1:05:51] could be deceived
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:55] so because of that she's put under head
[1:05:57] she said amen that's why like I said A
[1:06:00] woman can't handle the word she cannot
[1:06:01] preach those those roles are more
[1:06:04] masculine roles giving out seed giving
[1:06:06] out leadership and then the church now
[1:06:09] is receiving it that's a female role
[1:06:12] and when a man and a woman come together
[1:06:14] the man has the seed amen the woman is
[1:06:17] the receptor of the seed he sows the
[1:06:18] seed she receives the seed but then what
[1:06:20] does she do then she manifests the very
[1:06:23] seed she received
[1:06:25] because she's impregnated and she gives
[1:06:27] birth to a son or a daughter amen so
[1:06:29] this is the process amen the man is
[1:06:31] giving the seed the church the bride the
[1:06:33] woman is receiving the seed and
[1:06:35] manifesting what she's received
[1:06:38] amen that's why that's why every Church
[1:06:41] must be under a pastor there must be
[1:06:43] headships she can't be on her own
[1:06:46] amen but but under that hedge if there's
[1:06:49] Ministry there's a fightful Ministry
[1:06:51] that comes which is the ministry of
[1:06:53] Christ it's not just Menace the ministry
[1:06:55] of Christ Christ's now giving out his
[1:06:56] seed word now the church receiving it
[1:06:58] and manifesting it that's why we don't
[1:07:01] look to the ministers to do all the
[1:07:02] manifestation it's the manifestation
[1:07:05] comes through the bride body
[1:07:07] because the natural types the spiritual
[1:07:10] but the bride doesn't have seed to sow
[1:07:14] she receives it
[1:07:16] amen Christ is deceiving does Christ
[1:07:19] come through the body yes that's what
[1:07:20] preaching is all about
[1:07:23] but everything's a shadow a shadow a
[1:07:25] shadow a shadow
[1:07:27] that's why women don't use serp
[1:07:29] Authority
[1:07:31] but I'll say this
[1:07:33] this because a woman was commanded not
[1:07:35] to a serp authority over man doesn't
[1:07:37] mean she never has a valuable
[1:07:39] perspective
[1:07:42] hope we can catch this just because
[1:07:45] she's not to lead just because she
[1:07:47] cannot break the word just because you
[1:07:50] cannot preach the gospel does not mean
[1:07:52] that she should be silenced because she
[1:07:55] wasn't all through the Bible
[1:07:57] it doesn't mean she doesn't have
[1:07:59] valuable perspective
[1:08:01] now remember when brother Benham told us
[1:08:03] that God in the beginning he separated
[1:08:06] out the masculine and feminist Spirit
[1:08:08] from Adam amen and he made any and he
[1:08:11] made a male and female amen then now
[1:08:14] Adam Adam now doesn't have within
[1:08:17] himself what God separated it is now in
[1:08:20] this other body
[1:08:22] so the only way for Adam to get it is to
[1:08:25] have fellowship with the woman
[1:08:28] does that make sense
[1:08:30] I hope you see what I'm saying
[1:08:32] now he's got to now this was all in one
[1:08:36] vessel but that's not in one vessel
[1:08:38] anymore now he separated it out and he's
[1:08:40] placed it within the woman now he's got
[1:08:42] to come in contact with the woman and
[1:08:44] have fellowship with the woman to get
[1:08:46] that part that now he no longer has
[1:08:50] so just because God has called men to
[1:08:53] lead the church doesn't mean there's no
[1:08:55] value in the women in the church because
[1:08:57] we're still if I could say this way
[1:08:59] we're still lacking some perspective
[1:09:04] every man who's honest he understands
[1:09:06] this in his own home if he really wants
[1:09:08] to have a successful home he's going to
[1:09:10] pay attention to his wife he can't
[1:09:12] always listen to his wife and I don't
[1:09:15] mean listen he can't always do what she
[1:09:17] says because sometimes she's right and
[1:09:19] sometimes she's wrong
[1:09:20] I think that's fair as it goes for all
[1:09:22] of us
[1:09:23] the man sometimes right and sometimes
[1:09:25] he's wrong
[1:09:26] so the man can never just say well my
[1:09:28] wife's got a valuable point of view
[1:09:29] she's got something to say so I'm not
[1:09:31] even going to make the decision we'll
[1:09:33] let her make the decision you're wrong
[1:09:34] if you do that
[1:09:36] and I don't know any Christian women I
[1:09:38] don't know any sisters that want to take
[1:09:40] authority and want to take the headship
[1:09:43] I don't know and he says they want to be
[1:09:46] submissive it's in their nature amen
[1:09:48] they're expressing that nature they
[1:09:49] don't want to be dominant they don't
[1:09:50] want to be bold they don't want to be
[1:09:52] loud they don't want to argue they don't
[1:09:54] want to force an issue
[1:09:55] they want to be under subjection but I
[1:09:58] think sometimes what where we fail and I
[1:10:01] some sometimes where you'll see a woman
[1:10:03] become more dominant or start to argue I
[1:10:06] think she's being silenced and she has
[1:10:07] no voice
[1:10:10] I don't think she's afraid to be under
[1:10:12] headship I think she's afraid of having
[1:10:14] no voice
[1:10:16] because if we take away the voice of the
[1:10:19] feminist Spirit we are missing something
[1:10:25] God is expressed in male and female
[1:10:30] God wants a man to be masculine and have
[1:10:33] that Burly nature and that masculine
[1:10:35] wants him to lead wants him to watch
[1:10:37] over and protect and guard his wife and
[1:10:39] cherish her and protect her and the
[1:10:41] children but he wants the woman not to
[1:10:43] be Burly and he wants the woman to be a
[1:10:46] nurturer
[1:10:47] and have a sweet spirit and so she the
[1:10:51] the dad and the mom and the husband and
[1:10:53] the wife they have a different approach
[1:10:56] even to the children
[1:11:00] and if we learn to let God work through
[1:11:02] both we're going to have a good home and
[1:11:04] we're going to have well well-balanced
[1:11:06] and raised children
[1:11:08] but if one or the other is eliminated
[1:11:10] we're destined for trouble
[1:11:13] praise God
[1:11:15] so so God
[1:11:18] has set it up this way
[1:11:21] it's good for us if we recognize what
[1:11:23] God has done
[1:11:25] and not take our own ideas and and push
[1:11:28] one side too far one way and one too far
[1:11:31] the other way
[1:11:33] but we know Sarah even though Sarah
[1:11:35] spoke to Abraham Sarah was in submission
[1:11:37] to Abraham
[1:11:39] even though she had she had the right
[1:11:42] word let's look at this in First Peter
[1:11:45] First Peter chapter 3
[1:11:53] .
[1:12:01] First Peter chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:12:10] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[1:12:13] your own husbands that if any obey not
[1:12:15] the word they also May without the word
[1:12:18] be one with the conversation of the
[1:12:19] wives while they behold your Chase
[1:12:22] conversation coupled with fear who's
[1:12:24] adorning let it not be the outward
[1:12:26] adorning of plating of hair and of
[1:12:28] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:12:29] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:12:32] heart
[1:12:33] and that which is not corruptable even
[1:12:34] the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[1:12:36] which is in the sight of God a great
[1:12:39] price God likes the feminine nature
[1:12:42] and he likes a feminine a woman to
[1:12:44] express the feminine nature I want to
[1:12:46] read that again
[1:12:47] he says Let It Be The Hidden man of the
[1:12:49] heart and that which is not corruptable
[1:12:51] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:12:53] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:12:55] great price
[1:12:58] for after this manner in the old time
[1:13:00] the holy women also who trusted in God
[1:13:03] Adorn themselves being in subjection
[1:13:05] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[1:13:08] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[1:13:10] daughters you are as long as you do well
[1:13:12] and are not afraid with any amazement
[1:13:15] likewise you husbands
[1:13:18] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:13:21] I love this scripture
[1:13:24] this scripture is all about subjections
[1:13:26] subjection the woman subject herself to
[1:13:28] her own husband even as Sarah amen
[1:13:31] called her husband Lord and and I I for
[1:13:35] years had come in contact with people
[1:13:36] who resented that scripture I come in
[1:13:39] contact with some women at some times
[1:13:41] who resented that and they said I've
[1:13:43] heard it preached so many times and then
[1:13:45] and you being subjected to your husband
[1:13:47] and call your husband Lord the way Sarah
[1:13:49] called her husband Lord and and I began
[1:13:52] to question why would anybody get so
[1:13:55] frustrated with the Bible verse
[1:14:00] unless there's a misunderstanding or a
[1:14:02] misapplication of the verse
[1:14:04] how could anybody get so frustrated with
[1:14:07] the scripture or hear a scripture read
[1:14:09] and have a repulsion
[1:14:11] but we've all had that if you've been
[1:14:13] beat down in the wrong way or had
[1:14:15] scripture misused against you've been
[1:14:17] manipulated by a scripture whatever then
[1:14:19] you can have repulsion when you hear it
[1:14:21] read
[1:14:22] but I used to question why am I why am I
[1:14:25] meeting resistance and why are people
[1:14:27] I'm recoiling when you say you know call
[1:14:30] your you you be a Sarah who called her
[1:14:33] husband Lord
[1:14:34] you say am I supposed to call him Lord
[1:14:38] I mean I just read the Bible
[1:14:40] it's not me I didn't say you should say
[1:14:42] this or that I'm just reading the
[1:14:44] scriptures and it's not what title you
[1:14:46] give it's the attitude
[1:14:49] it's the reverence it's the respect it's
[1:14:51] the attitude why because this is what
[1:14:54] God wants
[1:14:56] but I began to find sometimes the
[1:14:58] problem is on the flip side
[1:15:01] and find it here in verse 7 likewise you
[1:15:04] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:15:06] knowledge there's something you need to
[1:15:09] understand as well with your wife
[1:15:12] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:15:13] giving honor unto the wife
[1:15:16] as unto the weaker vessel
[1:15:19] and as being heirs together heirs
[1:15:22] together this this inheritance is not
[1:15:25] one over the other this is Joint heirs
[1:15:29] being heirs together of the grace of
[1:15:32] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:15:35] now he flips it over to the husband to
[1:15:37] say now now listen you need to dwell
[1:15:39] with your wife according to knowledge
[1:15:41] yes she must be in submission yes she
[1:15:44] must have the attitude of calling you
[1:15:46] Lord like Sarah did in the women of old
[1:15:48] absolutely that's the scripture but this
[1:15:50] is also the scripture to dwell with them
[1:15:52] according to knowledge
[1:15:56] understanding understand your wife amen
[1:15:59] giving honor
[1:16:01] I love this
[1:16:02] giving honor
[1:16:05] where am I I've lost my verse seven
[1:16:07] giving honor unto the wife as unto their
[1:16:11] weaker vessel this weaker vessel is an
[1:16:13] interesting term because it it initially
[1:16:17] it looks like inferior
[1:16:19] right
[1:16:20] so if two guys are standing next to each
[1:16:22] other and one guy says I'm stronger
[1:16:24] you're weaker that seems to be inferior
[1:16:27] but this is not what we're talking about
[1:16:29] in weaker vessel this weaker vessel
[1:16:32] means fragile or delicate
[1:16:35] and most everything we have of Great
[1:16:37] Value is fragile or delicate
[1:16:40] and why is she fragile or delicate
[1:16:42] because she's a byproduct she was made
[1:16:44] in such a way that she could be deceived
[1:16:45] she was put under the headship of man
[1:16:47] and man is to give her honor to dwell
[1:16:49] with her according to knowledge and give
[1:16:50] her honor as unto a weaker vessel she is
[1:16:53] more delicate than you you can't treat
[1:16:56] her like another man
[1:17:00] and I find that so many times amen us
[1:17:03] men we make mistakes and I made mistakes
[1:17:05] early in my marriage and truth be known
[1:17:07] I still make mistakes
[1:17:10] because I I think my wife should think
[1:17:14] like me
[1:17:17] and I don't understand why she doesn't
[1:17:18] think like me
[1:17:20] and when she's not thinking like me I'm
[1:17:22] thinking what is wrong with you
[1:17:25] you're not thinking like me
[1:17:28] and she's over here thinking what is
[1:17:30] wrong with you
[1:17:32] like for me the picture's so clear
[1:17:35] for me over here the picture's so clear
[1:17:38] because we have two different
[1:17:40] perspectives based off the nature that's
[1:17:42] been placed within us
[1:17:46] and and because man is given to rule
[1:17:49] over the woman
[1:17:50] he's given the rule over here but
[1:17:52] according to knowledge
[1:17:55] giving honor unto her as unto the weaker
[1:17:58] vessel
[1:17:59] how do we honor a week of vessel well if
[1:18:01] you have a vase that's worth a lot of
[1:18:02] money you honor it by putting it on a
[1:18:04] pedestal you keep it safe you put it in
[1:18:05] a case you put it up High where the kids
[1:18:07] can't break it that's giving honor to
[1:18:09] one as a weaker vessel
[1:18:10] and this is how we're supposed to care
[1:18:13] for our wives giving honor to them as a
[1:18:15] weaker vessel means we protect them we
[1:18:17] guard them we shelter them we protect
[1:18:18] them amen we're not too harsh with them
[1:18:20] amen we're not too rugged amen I I can
[1:18:23] talk to another man
[1:18:25] rough
[1:18:28] I've done it with my friends before I've
[1:18:31] had a conversation and it's just been
[1:18:33] straightforward I mean not me nobody was
[1:18:35] mad we're straightforward I'd say no I
[1:18:37] disagree with you if you see two men
[1:18:39] working amen and you guy calls all those
[1:18:41] buddies ever they're going to build a
[1:18:42] shed and all of a sudden they're
[1:18:43] standing around well I think you should
[1:18:44] do it this way I said no I'm not going
[1:18:45] to do it that way I want to do it this
[1:18:46] way but what about this I think you're
[1:18:48] going to have a problem later you say
[1:18:49] leave me alone I know what I'm doing
[1:18:52] and all those guys can work on that
[1:18:54] project and they're fine at the end of
[1:18:55] it amen they go eat some pizza they pat
[1:18:57] each other in the back they had a great
[1:18:59] day
[1:19:03] you throw one woman into the mix and
[1:19:04] she's in tears in the house wondering
[1:19:07] why everybody's so mean
[1:19:08] and why do you talk to each other like
[1:19:10] that
[1:19:15] the problem is she's of a nature that
[1:19:17] God wants her to have
[1:19:19] and a man's of a nature God wants him to
[1:19:22] have
[1:19:22] neither one or wrong
[1:19:25] but when I begin to if I don't dwell
[1:19:27] with my wife according to knowledge and
[1:19:29] I expect her to act like me view
[1:19:31] everything like me respond to everything
[1:19:33] like me
[1:19:35] then what I'm doing is because I have
[1:19:37] the headship and I'm giving headship
[1:19:39] that way I'm pushing her down and
[1:19:41] pushing her down and pushing her down
[1:19:43] and all of that feminine nature that God
[1:19:45] wants to be expressed is being hindered
[1:19:48] inhibited Limited
[1:19:51] right I don't think that's what God
[1:19:53] wants
[1:19:54] I don't think that's what he wants in
[1:19:56] his marriage I don't want to think
[1:19:57] that's what he wants out of his bride I
[1:19:58] don't think God Amen I don't think God
[1:20:00] wants a Ministry so harsh and so hard
[1:20:03] and so legalistic that the bride has no
[1:20:05] expression she's hindered she's hampered
[1:20:07] she has nothing to say she hasn't
[1:20:10] she's never right she doesn't know what
[1:20:11] she's talking about
[1:20:14] I don't think that's what God wants
[1:20:16] I think God wants both expressed male
[1:20:18] and female I think he created it so I
[1:20:20] think he's expressing male and female I
[1:20:22] think he wants an expression of male and
[1:20:24] female
[1:20:25] so when when Abraham now is hearing from
[1:20:28] Sarah her next piece of advice about the
[1:20:31] son that she was responsible for and all
[1:20:34] of a sudden he's confused God comes in
[1:20:36] and sorts out the confusion
[1:20:38] and Abraham now knows what to do amen
[1:20:40] and it goes to show that that that none
[1:20:44] of us are always right
[1:20:46] none of us are always right
[1:20:49] but I'll say it this way
[1:20:51] the man has a right to be wrong
[1:20:55] because he's the one who has to make the
[1:20:57] decision somebody has to make this
[1:20:59] somebody has to take leadership
[1:21:01] at the end of the day it's his choice
[1:21:03] and if it's wrong he's got the right to
[1:21:05] make the wrong choice but also he's the
[1:21:08] one who Bears the responsibility for the
[1:21:10] wrong choice
[1:21:11] he's got a right to make that wrong
[1:21:12] choice in the home dad's got a right to
[1:21:15] make the wrong choice
[1:21:17] and mom's not going to go to
[1:21:18] manipulation tactics to force the
[1:21:20] screaming to to refusing no that's not a
[1:21:23] Christian home
[1:21:24] he's got a right but he's got the
[1:21:27] responsibility to take care of the
[1:21:29] consequences of that choice
[1:21:33] and if that be so
[1:21:35] I think it would behoove us all to
[1:21:38] recognize it certainly would be me and
[1:21:39] behoove me to recognize that there is
[1:21:42] another voice here and there's another
[1:21:43] perspective on the same situation that
[1:21:46] might help me get a clearer picture of
[1:21:48] what I'm looking at before I make my
[1:21:50] decision
[1:21:52] it might
[1:21:55] at least I want to hear before I make my
[1:21:58] decision
[1:22:02] let's look at this in the scripture
[1:22:03] let's go to Matthew 27.
[1:22:16] thank you
[1:22:25] Matthew 27
[1:22:28] verse 19.
[1:22:32] this is the trial of Jesus
[1:22:36] this is pilate when he was set down on
[1:22:39] the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him
[1:22:42] saying have thou nothing to do with that
[1:22:44] just man for I have suffered many things
[1:22:46] this day in a dream because of him
[1:22:49] but the chief priests and Elders
[1:22:51] persuaded the multitude and they should
[1:22:53] ask Barabbas and Destroy Jesus
[1:22:56] hear the wife of Pilate
[1:22:59] comes and gives him the best advice he
[1:23:02] has received in this whole situation
[1:23:05] and she was right
[1:23:09] and she was a pagan
[1:23:12] she wasn't even
[1:23:13] a Jewish believer she wasn't even
[1:23:15] believing the true word
[1:23:17] but
[1:23:19] she says the wife sentenced him saying I
[1:23:21] have have nothing to do with this just
[1:23:24] man she declares him just which pilate
[1:23:26] was already figuring out
[1:23:28] she confirmed what he already knew have
[1:23:30] nothing to do with this just man for I
[1:23:32] have suffered many things this day in a
[1:23:34] dream because of him
[1:23:36] it's amazing that Pilot's Wife got the
[1:23:39] dream
[1:23:40] not Pilate
[1:23:42] but pilate's wife and pilate were one
[1:23:45] according to the workings of God
[1:23:46] according to the way God set it up and
[1:23:48] it's amazing how many times that God
[1:23:50] will work through one or the other amen
[1:23:52] and one nature may be a little more
[1:23:55] sensitive than the other nature and one
[1:23:57] may be a little more I don't know I
[1:23:59] don't know all the terms to use but they
[1:24:01] have different different approaches or
[1:24:03] different aspects or different
[1:24:04] perspectives on the same issue and and
[1:24:07] she was able to pick up on something
[1:24:10] is that fair pilate's wife was able to
[1:24:13] pick up on something and she dreamed it
[1:24:15] in a dream and she came to pilate and
[1:24:17] what she said was right have nothing to
[1:24:19] do with this just man but pilate was
[1:24:21] already caught in the Trap and he was in
[1:24:23] the political web and he was going to be
[1:24:24] used Amen to fulfill the word of God
[1:24:26] regardless but she still was picking up
[1:24:29] on something
[1:24:31] and her perspective was right and when
[1:24:33] she picked up on it if if he would have
[1:24:35] been able to if it wouldn't have been
[1:24:36] the will of God if he had been able to
[1:24:38] heed her advice he would have saved
[1:24:39] himself trouble for the rest of his days
[1:24:43] so you can see that there's value
[1:24:47] to the expression of feminine
[1:24:49] and masculine
[1:24:52] I mean we want to keep everything in its
[1:24:54] order but we don't want to miss out on
[1:24:57] what God's given us we don't want to
[1:24:59] miss the picture
[1:25:01] because God wants to express himself in
[1:25:03] both
[1:25:05] I know I know there's many times that my
[1:25:08] wife will catch something
[1:25:10] she'll catch it in her spirit and she'll
[1:25:13] be right she doesn't know how to express
[1:25:15] it and I have no idea what she's
[1:25:16] catching
[1:25:18] and trying to express it it's just like
[1:25:20] a little warning and I'll watch and I've
[1:25:23] seen that thing be perfect before
[1:25:26] I've seen that be perfect she picked up
[1:25:28] on something not even understanding it
[1:25:30] all the way picked up on something
[1:25:31] shared it with me and I just watched I
[1:25:34] just sat and watched I couldn't make a
[1:25:36] decision because I didn't have enough
[1:25:37] information but I sat and watched and it
[1:25:39] ended up playing out perfect
[1:25:41] I've also seen her pick up on something
[1:25:44] and then be twisting in an emotional way
[1:25:46] because she got emotionally entangled in
[1:25:47] something and it not be exactly right
[1:25:52] is that right
[1:25:54] so we have to pay attention
[1:25:57] I can't say because my wife's more
[1:26:00] sensitive to me than whatever she says
[1:26:01] that's of the Lord we're going to do it
[1:26:03] no that's me giving over my headship
[1:26:05] that's me that's me actually not
[1:26:08] protecting her
[1:26:10] but if she knows she can express
[1:26:12] anything she feels to me and then I'm
[1:26:14] going to be prayerful and I'm going to
[1:26:16] take responsibility and I'm going away
[1:26:17] and I'm going to listen and I'm going to
[1:26:19] make the right decision now she's free
[1:26:21] to express
[1:26:25] but if I quickly say whatever you say
[1:26:27] whatever you say whatever you say what's
[1:26:28] she going to do she's going to get quiet
[1:26:30] because she doesn't want the
[1:26:31] responsibility of leading the family
[1:26:34] so I'm going to lose the opportunity to
[1:26:37] hear
[1:26:38] I'm going to lose the opportunity if I
[1:26:41] lay down my position and say you're
[1:26:43] right you're right you've been right the
[1:26:45] last 10 times so we're just going to go
[1:26:46] over you say from now on
[1:26:49] if we do that that woman with that
[1:26:51] gentle nature who doesn't want to be
[1:26:53] bold and doesn't want to be in charge
[1:26:54] she's going to regress and we're going
[1:26:57] to lose something
[1:26:59] but if we as husbands can stay in the
[1:27:02] right spot and say thank you for sharing
[1:27:04] that with me I don't know what to do but
[1:27:05] I'm going to be praying about this and
[1:27:06] she sees that you're listening and
[1:27:08] you're understanding even I mean I don't
[1:27:11] think there's any woman in here will
[1:27:12] admit that she's right 100 of the time
[1:27:16] nobody's right 100 of the time but
[1:27:18] there's something valuable to be
[1:27:20] expressed you see things that I can't
[1:27:22] see
[1:27:23] and if we share with one another and the
[1:27:26] man takes his position then the family
[1:27:27] will be better off
[1:27:29] I say thank God
[1:27:31] let's go to First Timothy
[1:27:33] chapter 3.
[1:27:43] First Timothy chapter 3
[1:27:55] First Timothy chapter 3 verse 2.
[1:28:04] I'm sorry yeah verse two
[1:28:08] a bishop then must be blameless the
[1:28:11] husband of one wife Vigilant sober of
[1:28:14] good behavior given to hospitality apt
[1:28:17] to teach so the bishop must be a husband
[1:28:19] of one wife let's go down here to First
[1:28:21] Timothy 3 12.
[1:28:24] let the deacons be the husbands of one
[1:28:27] wife ruling their children in their own
[1:28:29] houses well
[1:28:31] brother Ben comes to this scripture in
[1:28:33] verse 12.
[1:28:34] and the message placing of Deacons
[1:28:37] brother bam says somebody was presented
[1:28:39] to him by the Deacon board amen and he
[1:28:41] says now the scriptures requires a
[1:28:44] deacon to be married
[1:28:46] he's referring to this scripture and the
[1:28:48] man was disqualified because him and his
[1:28:50] wife weren't in harmony she wasn't a
[1:28:51] Believer she didn't believe the truth
[1:28:54] and and then you begin to look at what
[1:28:56] brother Bram said and you begin to look
[1:28:57] at the scriptures and begin to say why
[1:29:00] in order to hold a position of authority
[1:29:03] in the church as a bishop or as a deacon
[1:29:06] you have to be married you wonder why
[1:29:08] maybe because it will help
[1:29:12] maybe because what you need is a full
[1:29:15] picture of male and female maybe you
[1:29:17] need a greater understanding than you
[1:29:19] would have just as a single man
[1:29:21] but brother Branham said clearly he says
[1:29:23] the scriptures require a deacon to be a
[1:29:26] married man
[1:29:27] why because he's got to lead people he's
[1:29:30] got to help people Bishop has to lead
[1:29:32] people and help people and have a
[1:29:33] greater understanding and if everybody
[1:29:35] just LED from male perspectives male
[1:29:38] male male male male male male you would
[1:29:40] have I mean you would have a a group of
[1:29:43] rough Burly guys who are having a good
[1:29:45] time but nobody else will be having a
[1:29:47] good time
[1:29:48] nobody else would understand that we
[1:29:50] would lose a whole aspect of the nature
[1:29:53] of God
[1:29:55] I looked at the scripture and I said huh
[1:29:58] God knows what he's doing
[1:30:00] he knows what he's setting up and he
[1:30:02] knows why He's setting it up the way he
[1:30:03] is and God's way is the right way
[1:30:10] and so we see
[1:30:12] that the two becoming one
[1:30:15] gives the right expression
[1:30:18] the two in harmony the two in unity
[1:30:21] the two and each one playing the role
[1:30:23] correctly but the two together gives the
[1:30:27] right expression
[1:30:28] if we if we push one too far one way one
[1:30:32] expression the male or we push one too
[1:30:33] far the other way then we're not giving
[1:30:35] the right picture
[1:30:37] but when God can express himself through
[1:30:40] male and through female they can come
[1:30:42] together in unity according to the word
[1:30:44] they can come together in unity and
[1:30:46] mutual respect and love and care amen
[1:30:49] then they can begin to express
[1:30:51] because that's what Christ is doing with
[1:30:53] his bride in this day
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] brother brim says in the message it is
[1:30:59] the rising of the Sun so but remember he
[1:31:02] went there with you and him see he's
[1:31:04] stung into Calvary
[1:31:05] God had never separated the bride from
[1:31:07] the groom yet so when God looked down
[1:31:10] upon the body of Christ he saw both male
[1:31:12] and female
[1:31:13] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:31:15] they are one same same word the same
[1:31:18] word spoke with the groom speaks of the
[1:31:21] Bride so there at Calvary he hadn't yet
[1:31:24] separated the bride from the bridegroom
[1:31:25] they were all one just like Adam was one
[1:31:28] it was all in Adam it was all in Christ
[1:31:30] amen there are Calvary hadn't separated
[1:31:32] it but God was going to separate it and
[1:31:34] God was going to separate it to give
[1:31:36] more expression
[1:31:39] and the message the restoration of the
[1:31:41] Bride tree he says but what he was God's
[1:31:43] perfect Prophet tree the example tree
[1:31:46] the bridegroom tree amen glory going to
[1:31:49] say something directly he is the
[1:31:51] bridegroom tree do you believe it from
[1:31:54] the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom
[1:31:56] tree without the female don't bear fruit
[1:32:00] he wanted another expression to express
[1:32:02] something else
[1:32:04] he wasn't just done he wanted to express
[1:32:07] more amen
[1:32:09] so the bridegroom tree without the
[1:32:11] female don't bear fruit so he got to
[1:32:13] have a bride tree she's got to be born
[1:32:15] of the same material the word made flesh
[1:32:17] in the tree I hope you get it it's the
[1:32:20] same life in this female tree the
[1:32:21] bridegroom as it is in the bride The
[1:32:24] Works that I do show you also is that
[1:32:26] right he was the bridegroom remember now
[1:32:28] let's go back all the way to Genesis
[1:32:30] chapter 2.
[1:32:34] okay
[1:32:44] Genesis chapter 2 verse 22.
[1:32:54] in verse 22 in the rib which the Lord
[1:32:56] God had taken from man made he a woman
[1:32:58] and brought her unto the man and Adam
[1:33:00] said this is now bone of my bones and
[1:33:02] flesh in my flesh she shall be called
[1:33:04] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:33:06] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:33:08] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:33:10] wife and they shall be one flesh
[1:33:14] all the way back in the beginning this
[1:33:16] was God's program
[1:33:17] that God would take the feminist out of
[1:33:20] the the man take the feminist nature out
[1:33:24] form it into another form and unite the
[1:33:27] two back together and in uniting them
[1:33:29] two back together he would have the
[1:33:31] expression that he was wanting
[1:33:34] and God now when he looked down at
[1:33:36] Calvary he saw Christ like he saw Adam
[1:33:38] in Christ was everything the fullness of
[1:33:41] the word but he was going to separate
[1:33:42] out the bride and the bride was going to
[1:33:45] come into manifestation because God
[1:33:46] wants the bride to be made manifest
[1:33:49] it's a manifestation he wants in this
[1:33:51] hour
[1:33:53] he says in the message Oneness
[1:33:55] says if you'll notice now that Eve was
[1:33:58] United with Adam she became part of him
[1:34:01] God did you notice in Genesis 1 27 he
[1:34:04] created man male and female created he
[1:34:06] them
[1:34:07] now both male and female when it come to
[1:34:09] being in the spirit of feminist and
[1:34:11] masculine then God took from his side a
[1:34:13] rib did you notice the body part was a
[1:34:16] byproduct but not the spirit
[1:34:18] the body part of the woman was a
[1:34:20] byproduct after the creation had been
[1:34:22] finished God took from the side of Adam
[1:34:24] a rib and made a woman but not the
[1:34:26] spirit it was original Adam's spirit
[1:34:30] the spirit was part of Adam for he was
[1:34:32] both man and woman spiritually speaking
[1:34:34] both masculine and feminist
[1:34:36] now don't you see the great picture we
[1:34:39] in flesh are different we're like a
[1:34:41] byproduct a created being by holy
[1:34:43] wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and
[1:34:46] Daughters not some other Spirit but the
[1:34:48] spirit of the Living God
[1:34:49] we are in his likeness in his unity in
[1:34:52] the perfect image of the Living God
[1:34:53] because we become Sons and Daughters not
[1:34:56] separated but the Same Spirit the same
[1:34:59] God the same person joined in wedlock to
[1:35:01] the Eternal see how God planned it that
[1:35:04] way should be not not a different but
[1:35:07] him not some other being of some other
[1:35:09] tribe but a real Union offspring of the
[1:35:12] almighty done by the holy union now the
[1:35:15] body comes from mother and father but
[1:35:16] the spirit comes from God God separated
[1:35:19] himself as Adam was separated
[1:35:21] on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy
[1:35:24] Spirit the pillar of fire separating
[1:35:26] itself and setting upon each member of
[1:35:28] the church God putting his self together
[1:35:30] then when that group of God together
[1:35:33] what does it do brings back the unified
[1:35:36] body of the Lord Jesus coming together
[1:35:40] what does that do when we come to the
[1:35:42] end time and we come to the spirit of
[1:35:44] God dwelling in full measure back in a
[1:35:46] bride upon the Earth it brings the
[1:35:48] unified body back together as one and
[1:35:51] that's what God wants to display in our
[1:35:53] day
[1:35:54] two
[1:35:56] becoming one
[1:35:58] amen he was here we were here
[1:36:02] but we didn't know anything about it now
[1:36:04] there comes an expression and down
[1:36:06] through seven Church ages there's come
[1:36:07] an expression of feminine of Bride and
[1:36:10] that bride expression comes to a
[1:36:12] culmination amen at the end time and to
[1:36:14] express Jesus Christ in the formation of
[1:36:17] the Bride it's a female expression and
[1:36:19] now when he comes as a headstone to cap
[1:36:22] this body to dwell in fullness in the
[1:36:24] body it's a unification of the body
[1:36:25] together now back together as one
[1:36:29] giving the right kind of expression in
[1:36:33] our time
[1:36:34] brother Brett says in the laodicean
[1:36:36] church age from the church age book
[1:36:39] it says a momentary consideration of
[1:36:41] church history will prove how accurate
[1:36:43] this thought is
[1:36:44] in the Dark Ages the word was almost
[1:36:46] entirely lost to the people but God sent
[1:36:49] Luther with the word and the Lutheran
[1:36:51] spoke for God at that time but they
[1:36:53] organized and again the pure word was
[1:36:55] lost by organization tends towards dogma
[1:36:58] and Creeds and not simple word they
[1:37:00] could no longer speak for God then God
[1:37:02] sent Wesley and he was the voice with
[1:37:05] the word in his day the people who took
[1:37:07] his Revelation from God became the
[1:37:09] living Epistles read and known of all
[1:37:10] men for their generation
[1:37:12] when the method has failed God raised up
[1:37:14] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:37:16] years until in the last day there is
[1:37:18] again another people in the land who
[1:37:20] under their Messenger will be the final
[1:37:22] voice to the final age
[1:37:25] God will speak through his bride
[1:37:28] but she'll be the she'll be I love how
[1:37:31] he says this
[1:37:32] again another people in the land who
[1:37:34] under their messenger this bride will
[1:37:37] speak but never usurp Authority shall
[1:37:39] never rise above the headship of the
[1:37:41] word
[1:37:42] and she'll never rise above the
[1:37:45] messenger of the age that God gave to
[1:37:47] her she won't become equal to she won't
[1:37:49] use of authority but there's already
[1:37:51] been an expression and now there's
[1:37:52] another expression and this expression
[1:37:54] is under the messenger
[1:37:57] this bride amen now is is told as John
[1:38:00] was told to go take the book and eat the
[1:38:02] book she's taking the book and eating
[1:38:04] the book and told that you must prophesy
[1:38:06] again amen she's going to prophesy again
[1:38:08] but not her own prophecy not her own
[1:38:10] words not her own ideas prophesy again
[1:38:13] means prophesy what's already been
[1:38:15] prophesied
[1:38:16] prophesy again shall stay under the
[1:38:18] messenger for the age she'll stay under
[1:38:20] the headship of the word but she will be
[1:38:23] the final voice to the final age amen
[1:38:26] everybody expressing but staying in line
[1:38:29] to their calling
[1:38:34] under their Messenger will be the final
[1:38:36] voice to the final age why will God do
[1:38:38] this because God wants to be expressed
[1:38:42] in the bride form
[1:38:45] he wants to
[1:38:46] he started it in Genesis it was
[1:38:48] disrupted by the Fall he's been working
[1:38:50] to bring it back and he wants it to be
[1:38:52] expressed and it'll be expressed in
[1:38:54] perfection in the millennium
[1:38:58] I'm looking forward to that time
[1:39:02] God never tells his bride to be quiet
[1:39:06] I'm tired of you talking
[1:39:11] but he says
[1:39:13] he says ask
[1:39:15] seek you should find knock
[1:39:18] God looks at his disciples Jesus is
[1:39:21] standing there with the disciples all
[1:39:23] around and he's saying the field is wide
[1:39:26] into Harvest pray to the Lord of the
[1:39:29] Harvest and he'll send laborers into the
[1:39:30] Harvest and brother Branham says he was
[1:39:32] the lord of the Harvest
[1:39:34] why would he knowing it's ready telling
[1:39:37] them it's ready ask them to pray he he
[1:39:40] could just take care of it and brother
[1:39:41] said he does nothing without man he's
[1:39:44] working through his body God has put
[1:39:45] himself on partnership with man God
[1:39:48] wants to express himself in all of these
[1:39:50] ways
[1:39:51] so he's got to have a people what he's
[1:39:53] expressing to the disciples he's got to
[1:39:55] have a people on Earth that'll voice
[1:39:57] back to him what they see needs done
[1:40:00] Lord look at the Harvest Lord send
[1:40:03] laborers to the Harvest he already knows
[1:40:05] but he's waiting for his bride to say
[1:40:07] something to him
[1:40:11] amen we've got to be seeing and praying
[1:40:14] and seeking and asking amen come like
[1:40:17] Abigail amen come come like like Moses
[1:40:20] did Moses comes to to God when he's
[1:40:24] standing in the Gap and he's reminding
[1:40:25] God of God's promise
[1:40:29] God doesn't say be quiet Moses I was the
[1:40:32] one who said it why are you reminding me
[1:40:34] of what I said
[1:40:36] no but it was Christ in Moses there was
[1:40:39] an expression that he was expressing and
[1:40:40] God was pleased that Moses was standing
[1:40:42] in the game expressing another part of
[1:40:45] God
[1:40:46] and he's telling God God don't do this
[1:40:49] your enemies will think this don't you
[1:40:50] remember the promise you made to Abraham
[1:40:52] amen and God listens to Moses
[1:40:56] was it he was he listening to Moses or
[1:40:58] was he listening to himself in Moses
[1:41:06] and then and and now I mean God's never
[1:41:09] told us to be quiet you have nothing to
[1:41:10] say just follow orders
[1:41:12] that's not that's not the bride the
[1:41:15] bride's the one on earth expressing
[1:41:16] she's his eyes and his ears and she's
[1:41:19] saying gone amen you promised this but
[1:41:21] look at my child look at this one look
[1:41:23] at this in the church God do you
[1:41:25] remember when you said do you remember
[1:41:26] when your Prophet said I'm trusting in
[1:41:28] you amen and God is listening to his
[1:41:31] wife speak back to him and he's saying
[1:41:33] that's good honey that's good yeah we'll
[1:41:35] do that
[1:41:39] because God wants us to ask
[1:41:43] God wanted the disciples Jesus wanted
[1:41:45] the disciples to ask although he already
[1:41:47] knew he wanted the nest he was depending
[1:41:49] on them getting into action so he could
[1:41:52] respond to their request
[1:41:54] I say the bride has an important role in
[1:41:56] the end time
[1:41:58] men she used to stand her headship
[1:42:00] absolutely I don't think she has a
[1:42:01] desire to get out of headship
[1:42:03] it's only deception that that tries to
[1:42:05] make us do that but the true bride has
[1:42:07] no desire to get out from headship she
[1:42:09] has no desire to be above the messenger
[1:42:12] of the age
[1:42:13] I don't know about you but I'm happy
[1:42:14] being under the messenger very content
[1:42:17] being under the messenger and very
[1:42:20] content having Christ watching over me
[1:42:24] so under their Messenger will be the
[1:42:26] final voice to the final age yes sir the
[1:42:29] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:42:31] God it is its own mouthpiece
[1:42:33] so God is turning on her he will
[1:42:35] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:42:37] bride for the voice of God will be in
[1:42:40] her
[1:42:41] yes it is for it says in the last
[1:42:43] chapter revelation 22 verse 17 the
[1:42:46] spirit and the bride say come
[1:42:50] God is going to express himself in all
[1:42:53] of these Avenues
[1:42:54] and we should understand God's
[1:42:56] expression even in even in our families
[1:42:59] in the church all around us we could
[1:43:01] understand God wants to express himself
[1:43:02] male and female
[1:43:04] hey let's not be too proud as men when
[1:43:07] your wife has the best idea you've ever
[1:43:09] had on that subject
[1:43:12] it's happened to me multiple times and
[1:43:14] every time it's like oh
[1:43:16] yeah you're right
[1:43:21] but thank God Amen God's put somebody
[1:43:24] there to partner with you to help bail
[1:43:26] you out and give you another vision and
[1:43:28] give you more insight
[1:43:30] if we would take the right approach to
[1:43:31] the things have gone I think we would
[1:43:33] get the right benefit out of it
[1:43:36] praise God God was to express himself
[1:43:38] male and female and there is a great
[1:43:41] tremendous value in the expression of
[1:43:44] the feminine attribute of God and I say

[1:44:05] headship but in the natural God's called
