[0:00] because he hates the spiritually
[0:02] revealed word
[0:04] and the one that he hates the most is a
[0:06] spiritually revealed word to the
[0:08] individual
[0:10] that's the thing that he hates make it a
[0:12] church system please make it a church
[0:14] system
[0:15] make it a group make it all of us let's
[0:17] just say
[0:18] everybody who walks in these doors this
[0:19] sunday we're all bride
[0:21] we're all okay we're all part of it we
[0:22] got our stamp on our card we came to
[0:24] church we came in this building this is
[0:26] the right place with the right doctrine
[0:27] and the right teaching
[0:28] we're all okay that's that is the
[0:30] teaching that he loves
[0:32] [Music]
[0:33] he loves that teaching because if we all
[0:35] settle down in that teaching
[0:37] all he's got to do is bring an anointing
[0:39] to one or two at the top of that ladder
[0:41] and he can sway the whole group into
[0:43] deception
[0:45] but the truth that he hates is that this
[0:47] revelation is to the individual
[0:49] to the end i know myself i mean i don't
[0:52] need a group i don't need another
[0:54] teacher i don't need a priest i don't
[0:55] need anybody to tell me because god
[0:57] himself has told me
[0:58] i met him in the backside of the desert
[1:00] and he told me who i
[1:01] am and all hell is against this
[1:05] revelation
[1:05] amen he wants to make it a group he'll
[1:07] try to do it in the message make it a
[1:09] group we hold this doctrine we hold this
[1:11] doctrine this group this group
[1:12] don't be part of any group amen it's an
[1:15] individual connected to christ
[1:16] and satan is fighting that revelation
[1:22] well we all believe like this group
[1:23] we've all been like this group i don't
[1:24] want to believe like any group i want to
[1:26] believe by revelation that he gives me
[1:28] personally
[1:28] that i see it in the word that i'm not a
[1:30] parent repeating a preacher but i've got
[1:32] my own revelation
[1:34] of who i am and what the word is for
[1:36] this day and where i fit into the
[1:37] picture
[1:39] all hell is against that revelation
[1:45] that's why amen if you preach that
[1:48] revelation teach that revelation and
[1:50] bring that revelation
[1:51] you better be ready for trouble
[1:54] because satan hates that
[1:58] trouble comes in all kinds of forms to
[2:00] bring discouragement to bring
[2:01] disappointment
[2:02] amen to bring exhaustion
[2:06] but what's he trying to do he's trying
[2:08] to stop that truth from being expressed
[2:10] and catching the individuals because he
[2:12] has no power over individuals with an
[2:14] individual connection to the throne of
[2:16] god
[2:17] because god can make a move amen and all
[2:20] the believers in the whole world will
[2:21] catch it
[2:24] because they don't have to wait they
[2:25] don't have to wait for a certain group
[2:28] or a certain
[2:28] teaching to come out or a certain man to
[2:30] say it amen they're catching their own
[2:32] revelation from god they have their own
[2:34] connection with god
