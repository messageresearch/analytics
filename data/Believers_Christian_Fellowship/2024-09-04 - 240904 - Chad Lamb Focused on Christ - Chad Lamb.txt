she's here with two of her children visiting from the Philippines so it's nice to have her she's here visiting sister Anna Hans and her son Edward and Troy and said they came up with her and also sister Lucy's sister Lisa from Louisiana is here so God bless you all it's good to have you here today and all our other visitors I Saw Linda wood sisters here God bless you it's good to have you with us again man I want to let you know that brother Emanuel sent me a text just a few hours ago and said he's heading out tomorrow and should be back in Ohio Friday evening and should be in service on Sunday so just pray he has a very relaxing uneventful trip home amen that he has peace and he can rest also brother Gabe Smith will be traveling up to Cleveland to minister for Nathaniel sias this Sunday he'll be up there for the weekend so pray for him and his family as they travel up together also I wanted to uh say thank you to um the seab bolts brother Ben and sister Amanda for the picnic on Monday we had a wonderful time and we enjoyed that and we're always thankful that they're so generous and open up their home and property for us to crash their place for hours on them and also thank you for everybody who helped I know Elizabeth Brooks helped quite a bit and there was a team helping with that so we really appreciate that it was perfect I told brother Ben whatever he does to order the weather every year he's got to keep doing it he's doing a good job amen but God was certainly good to us so we're thankful for that before we went to prayer I wanted to give you an update on brother Mike Bower uh we've got a prayer request in here that turned in from his family but uh brother Mike was admitted to the ER last night and he's been fighting a deep fungal infection in the lung so it's a deep tissue fungal infection and actually U he was referred to an infectious disease Doctor Who's up in Finley so they sent him to the Blanchard Valley Hospital fin so he could be near that doctor so he's currently in ICU there uh right now but they tried a couple weeks ago to start him on a drug to to try to get rid of this fungal infection and he had a ton of negative side effects to that drug it was an oral drug and it was actually he was uh couldn't eat lost his appetite had all kinds of other side effects and he's been getting worse and worse and worse and weaker and weaker so he talked to the doctor they discontinued the medicine last week but he continued to get weaker so they they wanted to send him up there and they're going to try uh uh the same medicine only they're going to try it through an IV and see if he can tolerate that better so our brother needs her prayers they they told him originally if the fungal infection would entered the bloodstream it could be lethal and so we just need to hold our brother up in prayer I went up to see him this morning though and he's in good spirits amen he's he was really good he's at peace he said I'm at peace he's trusting the Lord believing the word and it's so amazing to see some somebody who's in such a weak condition and the doctors tell him in a dangerous condition and they've not been able to help him but he's at total peace and he's trusting God and I left there very much encouraged we had a chance to pray together and talk for a little while but I was really encouraged but just pray for him pray that the doctors the staff there have wisdom that God will supernaturally give him wisdom for what he needs what they can do to help him I pray that those all the staff are tools in the hand of God that God would use them to help our brother and also pray pray for sister Elsie and the rest of the family because it's quite trying for all of them as well so I'd like for us to stand together and take this request to the Lord together as a congregation and ask the Lord to intervene let's just bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus that in the time of trouble you're the Strong Tower that the righteous run into and are safe Lord all the things that have happened to our brother Mike he's he's undergone it Lord but there's a peace in his heart there's a Joy that's about him there's a light that's still emanating from him even in a physically weakened condition his Spirit he says his spirit is growing Lord I'm so thankful for that for his testimony I'm so thankful that you're a friend that Stith closer than a brother that you're so dependable in times of trouble that you never step away but you're always there Lord we're asking as a congregation that you would come on the scene for by your stripes our brother is healed you purchased for us our healing you bought back our Redemptive rights Lord and God I just pray now that you would give to my brother that healing that you purchased that you would move in his body and bring that body subject to your word and may it line up to your word and to the confession of our brother and to our faith God I pray that you would move on the scene that you would use the doctors the nurses and all the staff use them as Tools in your hand to help our brother get him the help that he needs Lord and I pray that you'd watch over his family that you'd strengthen them especially sister Elsie you'd watch over she travels back and forth on the roads and that you would strengthen her and put your peace in her heart and give her joy in the midst of the trial God I pray that you'd let the light that shines from our brother affect all that are around him and may he walk out of there with a tremendous testimony that you are the same yesterday today and forever that your power is not diminished and there's nothing that you can't heal and there's nothing that you can't deliver from oh God let your glory be seen in this trial we love you we ask that you'd bless us now this evening as we look into your word I pray God you'd open our ears to hear and our eyes to see the word that you have for us in this hour God I pray you take this vessel of mine under your control and may you use these lips Lord For Your Glory and may you speak the right word the the the pure word and season Lord may it have an effect in our lives and change us and equip us and strengthen us that we might serve you better we love you and we ask for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and while we're standing won we turn to the book of Deuteronomy and we'll read a scripture there before we seated also want to thank sister Lucy for the special brother Tom it was always always good to hear Brother Tom sing a special always enjoy that amen God is so good praise the Lord Deuteronomy 5 Deuteronomy chapter 5 and we're going like to read just one verse while we're standing verse 32 Deuteronomy 5 and verse 32 ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God has commanded you you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left God bless you as you take your seeds I'd like to take for a subject this evening just preach on focused on Christ just a a simple thought a thought that I had um actually since Sunday since I preached Sunday right after I preached this this came to me and I started uh ruminating on it and and you know we look at Deuteronomy they were commanded just to do as the Lord your God has commanded you and don't turn to the right or to the left but they wanted to straight stay straight with the word amen let's turn to Matthew 24 together Matthew 24 and verse 24 Matthew 24:24 says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect and brother benam picks up this scripture and he he tell he goes over this over and over again and he tells us that the deception in the end time is so great that if it were possible would deceive the very elect and the anointed ones at the end time he says it only lets the wheat be known to the elected which are part of it notice how beautiful this is brought in here now notice the anointed ones will be able the true elected predestinated Ephesians 51 or 15 rather will be ordained elected they are the only ones that will not that will not be deceived notice the anointed Prophet false the anointed prophets will be false and there among it will be true anointed how are you going to tell it by the word amen so so he says that the the elected predestinated ordained elected they're the only ones who are not going to be deceived but the deception is going to be so great that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect if it were possible so that means it's not possible to deceive the very elect and it's not that the elect are wiser than anybody else because that's not true true amen but the elect has been given something to inoculate them against the deception in this hour and what they've been given is the word they haven't been given a brighter intellect they haven't been given a stronger willpower that's not what they've been given they've been given the word and if you'll just trust in the word and not turn to the right or the left but just believe the word that's been given she's inoculated against deception amen and so when we when we talk about the bride can't be deceived we can talk about you know we can't be deceived and we can't be deceived and the truth is I can be deceived all day long because I'm a human being and I'm gullible and I tend to fall for deception I tend to take people at face value and believe what they say and I can be taken for a ride any day of the week but the word can't be deceived the word can't be taken for a ride the word can't be deterred from its course and if I'll stay with the word and if the word in me will stay with the word that's brought to me we're going to make it to the destination so we make statements like the bride can't be deceived but we got to be careful and we recognize that has nothing to do with your and I brain and our abilities and us as human beings we can be deceived as much as anybody else can be deceived you can have somebody scam you out of thousands of dollars on a telephone scam and you can still be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen you can you can get a bad car deal and still be the Bride of Jesus Christ but you can't be deceived off this word why because he brought a true word Amen to inoculate against deception but we got to stay with the word and so we want to look at that today and and when I say that I also don't say it in a way that somehow we've got as human beings the ability to to determine ourselves whoever is right and whoever is wrong and we just start calling out right and wrong all over the place that's not our job either our job is just to stay with the word it's not it's not my job is not to come up here and tell you everybody else in the world who's a deceiver because somehow I'm bride and I can't be deceived so I can call everybody out amen that's not my job my job is here to keep pointing to the word keep pointing to the word keep pointing because if we keep walking through the word it's going to keep us from falling to the right or to the left amen so it to me it comes down to some of these things come down to attitude they're true statements but we can take a humanistic attitude to a true statement and we can get ourselves Tangled up in all kinds of knots but if we keep the right attitude towards the right thing it'll produce exactly what he said it would right amen so in the message trying to do God a service he says and the Kings dressed themselves and set before him to impress the prophet and he's talking about Jehoshaphat and Ahab when they came together and Ahab said would you go up with me to take this land from Syria it's our land according to uh what Moses had divided for us and they were sitting there and they they had a discussion and Jehoshaphat said shouldn't we consult God and Ahab said absolutely I got a whole team of prophets so they were going to call the prophets in to find out they were going to inquire the Lord whether they should go up to take this land or not so they dressed themselves and set before him to impress the prophet and here come I believe it was zedekiah come up and the great chief of the district councilmen or ever what he was came up there among them he made himself two big horns he said I have heard from God th thus sayith the Lord with these horns you'll push the syrians plum out of the land Oh Glory everybody thought that was wonderful fine watch how close it gets to that Razor Edge now between right and wrong and remember it'll fall on one or the other side till it comes down sometime like a honed razor between the difference of right and wrong it's got to be every word of God not just almost every word but every word and it's got down today not to Lutheran not to Methodist not to Pentecostals but to that honed age in this age where the Antichrist anointing is so perfectly it would deceive the very elected they'll fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it like a wedge it's so now's coming it's come down to the home down time like like a razor he said like a wedge to where everything is going to fall to one side or to the other and when he's talking here about uh Ahab and Jehoshaphat SE ing uh uh the Lord through the prophets amen what zedekiah did is zedekiah took what Moses had said and he had got an inspiration but that inspiration wasn't according to the word for his day right it was according to the word he could look where Moses had divided raymon Gilead he divided this portion of Syria they the syrians had taken it but that was a portion that was allotted to them and the original breaking up of the land so that they could look at the word and look back at the Bible and say I've got a scripture for this inspiration and yes we should go up and take it and the Lord's going to deliver it the problem is there was another Prophet who had just been there in that generation and that Prophet said no Ahab you're under a curse you're under condemnation you're not going up to take anything you're coming down yeah amen and although this Prophet had a scripture he could go to and he could say did not Moses say did not I get inspired and did not I have a sensation and didn't I have a strong feeling didn't I have a dream and I had all of this but it was contrary to the word for that day and that's why brother said it comes down to a hones razored edge it's so it's so sharp amen everybody was rejoicing and the reason they were rejoicing is because what zedekiah told them is what they wanted to hear what what Elijah had told them is not what they wanted to hear but what zedekiah told him is what they wanted to hear and so now they had gotten to themselves uh prophets having itchy ears and they wanted a prophet to come scratch their ear to tell them the thing they wanted to hear and use inspiration and use the word and use all of that just to deliver a message that was already something that they desired amen but but now there was another prophet in the land Micaiah and Micaiah was a true prophet of God and Jehoshaphat brother B said had just enough God about him to know there was something not right about this he said isn't there another one he said yes but I hate him why did he hate him why was it that he loved these 400 and he hated this other voice because that other voice amen didn't tell him what he wanted to hear but told him the truth oh God I pray that you'd give me an ear for the truth even if I don't want to hear it even if my flesh doesn't like it even if it makes me cringe even if it makes me feel exposed amen God just tell me the truth and give me an ear to hear the truth so Micaiah comes and he gives his report and and it was exactly contrary to zedekiah's he even told him where zedekiah's anointing come from but brother B said how did zedekiah know that his vision was right how did God Micaiah know his vision was right and zedekiah was wrong he said he checked it with the word what word did he check it with the word that had just come from that prophet in that generation from Elijah amen he said it had to align with Elijah's prophecy for it to be right yeah right praise God so both of them could talk about inspiration both of them could talk about Visions both of them could talk about feelings both of them could talk about scriptures but Micaiah his anointing was in line with the word for the day what God was doing in that generation this is where brother B starts talking this is how this is how the deception works it's not deception between you know the Bible and a bar that's not the whole Razor's Edge that's not the wedge where it falls on one side of the other but it's between the Bible and the Bible yeah right my goodness between A Gifted Man and A Gifted Man amen and so he says it comes down here to this Razor's Edge between right and wrong and so now he says I'm referring right back to what brother B said remember it'll fall on one or the other side till it comes down sometimes like a hone Raisor between the difference of right and wrong and it it's a wedge now that's going to drop you off one side or the other and it's it's pretty tight he said it means be the difference between right and wrong is not very far apart that's right interesting so the question then is how are we going to make it it's a good question because when I start hearing quotes like this and I start thinking about myself and my Human Condition I start realizing listen I I loan people money that I shouldn't have loan money to cuz I believed them I believe things that the news said or somebody at work told me I believed it with on my heart there later to find out it wasn't true at all what am I going to do I say God you're going to have to help me that's all I can do is God you sent a prophet in this day and you put something in me to believe that prophet and you've got to carry me through because I can't rely on myself but I've got a promise in this word and I've got to rely on the promise because it's really tight between right and wrong it's really close it's not as far away as we would imagine sometimes let's turn to the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1:4 he says according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's it friends that's our consolation that's our hope that's our faith that's our life that's our guarantee it wasn't me who decided it's him who decided it wasn't my efforts that made it he already determined that I'm going to make him and we read this again he says according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen that's my promise that's my scripture that's what I have stalk in amen it wasn't because it's dependent upon me but it was dependent on his choosing before the foundation of the world and he already predestinated me unto adoption what is adoption in this age adoption is the destination that's the goal we're coming un adoption Amen to the bride will come into the full stature of Jesus Christ and she'll receive a body change she's coming into the fullness of adoption that's the goal that's the target that's what we're striving for and how am I going to make it when the deception is the greatest that it's ever been and it's the deception in the word it's the deception with gifted men it's the deception all around how am I going to make it the only way way I'm going to make it is if I'm included in this scripture is the only way that I can make it there's no other way for me to make it I have to believe that I'm included in this because if I'm not included in this my case is hopeless amen and you can't put yourself in you can't make it happen you can't will it to happen you just have to receive it by faith and say that's me when you look in the mirror you say that's Mama that's me me that's me the Bible's talking about he's predestinated us into adoption that's me I believe it's me amen I don't have evidence or proof it's me but inside my soul I believe that I'm included in that and he chose me in him before the foundation of the world and that's the promise that I'm holding to because if I don't have that promise what do I have Amen brother B says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said denominations won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah she's ordained not to fall she won't fail fail she is predestinated not to when I read that my heart rejoices and I say amen that's got to be the truth because if we weren't predestined not to fail guess what you and I would do fail Eve was Eve was chosen she was set in perfection and she she had the word and she fell amen but this one this eve of the last day this last day bride she won't fail why won't she fall she's ordained she's ordained not to fall she won't fail she's predestinated not to that's our promise amen that's the promise we have to look to that's our strength that's our source of comfort that's the only thing that can give our souls rest if not we're going to be nervous wrecks there's a story brother Brenham tells and I he tells it in several places but I'm going to pick it up out of the message Investments and Investments he says this he says ER Baxter ER Baxter was uh one of his campaign managers for some time said ER Baxter one of my colleagues a very fine culture man many of you know er a very fine able minister of Canada he was telling me a little story one day he said brother brandham we ride bicycles and said when I was a kid we could we could go downtown get a sack of groceries for my mother and never touch the handlebars on the bicycle he said and this company came up here named Schwin was going to give a bicycle for any kid who could ride a foot wide board standing 2 feet high in the air for 30 yards and he said every one of us knew that we could do it and said there was one little boy there we never would even fellowship with him because he didn't look like he know too much he said so we thought we were just a little a little better class than he was and he qualified or he wanted to enter the race too and said you know what every one of us fell off that board but him and he said he rode it right out to the end and got off and bowed picked up a swin bicycle and started to ride away and said we boys met him down at the corner and said John we want to know how did you do it he said well now boys I'll tell you what happened said I watched what you all done and I went another way he said you see when you got on that when when you got on and they gave you that push you were better all of you are better Riders than I am you know that said because I can't ride without holding the handlebars a little further down he picks up the story he says he said I'm not the rider that you fellas are he said I see where you made your mistakes you were looking down like this and trying to balance it said that made you nervous and you fell off he said when I got on there they pushed me I just kept watching the end of the road and held steady amen I love that story because they wanted they all wanted to get across the board they all wanted to get the prize they all wanted to win the prize the newwin bicycle so they everyone got determined and and it was amazing that the one who won was the one who was the least skilled amongst them all I love the way brother R tells stories because it's so much like when Jesus was speaking to his disciples just using Parables to explain and he begins to to build on this story and we begin to find out the one who is the least skilled the one who is the least qualified the one who is the least likely to make it across he's the one who got across and won the prize because it wasn't based off raw skill raw talent and gifts so they said what was it they were so curious how did you do that when we couldn't do that and he said you made your mistake because you you tried to balance yourself and you kept looking down and you were trying to stay on the board he said so I didn't even try to look down and stay on the board what I did is I looked towards the goal I looked towards the end of the line I looked towards the promise and the prize and I just rode fixed my eyes on that and when I rode that way I stayed straight and I stayed on the board listen this is our goal what is our goal my goal is that adoption promise my goal is the change in the body my goal amen is the marriage supper with the Lord and I'm just fixing my eyes on that goalen writing because I don't have the skill to keep it on this board many of them fell to the right and many of them fell to the left hey guess what if you've been writing on this board for any length of time you've seen a lot of people fall to the right and fall to the left why because they're focusing on trying to stay on the board trying to stay right trying to trying to focus on what's right and what's wrong and but I wonder if sometimes we can miss the objective get so fixated on making sure making sure I'm staying on the board correcting every infraction and and what they start doing is overcorrecting right getting nervous and then anxiety starts to enter and fear starts to come along and maybe a little bit of pride is mixed in and and they they start overcracking start wobbling and they can't hold it on anymore and they flop off and I don't know about you but that's been my experience not just correcting overcorrecting because I'm afraid afraid to fall off afraid to be wrong afraid to be found wrong afraid of all of this stuff when when when I was so fixated on uh uh is this right or is that right or what's this look like or what's somebody think about this and I'm not staying on and I'm going to I'm so fixating I can't even ride down the road amen what I need to do is quit looking down and start looking up and find out where's my destination and just fix my destination because I believe by predestination I'm destined for that destination amen there's this is a treacherous Journey we're on and you know who's going to make it to the other side only the predestinated you know who's going to you know who's going to ride we just use the analogy the parable of riding the bike across the board you know who's going to be the only ones that get off on the other side and win the prize the only ones were those who were for ordained before the foundation of the world and so we need to relax under a promise and focus on the goal and just set our face like flint and move towards the goal amen and the the problem too is when we see so many people fail can you imagine those boys who got on there and the best boy in town the one who could do two sacks of groceries and never touch the handlebars he makes it about 10 feet and boom he's gone and everybody else in Line's thinking there's no way I can do it there's no way I can make it and the second best Falls and the third best Falls and then the stranger from out of town who claims to to do it with a Willie you know he falls the most gifted fail the most talented fail the most skilled fail how long's been how how long have you been serving the lord 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years some times the most gifted fail they fall the most talented those that do it the best they fall off because it's not it's not what matters what matters is what I'm ordained to be hey you and I may be the boy who nobody thought had a chance hey if that's the case then we don't have anything to prove to anybody they expect us to fall off anyways so let's not worry about it let's just fix our eyes on the prize which is Christ and just keep pedling towards him see we've got a little secret that everybody else doesn't have he predestinated me to come out on the other end he ordained it so it may not be the prettiest it may not be the flashiest I may not be able to do it with no hands I may not have all the skill and talent I may not be the best bike rider in the world Amen but I have been predestinated to make it to the other side and I'm not on this a I'm not on this board to put on the best show because I know I can't do it and if I start putting on a show I'm going to wind up in the ditch I'm here to make it to the other side amen I know to make it to the other side I can't rely on myself or my ability or my skill or even my eyesight or even my handon eye coordination because that's what those boys were trying to do they were trying to rely on their ability and their ability began to fail why because they weren't relaxing they weren't just moving forward they were they were attempting to do it they were managing it themselves they were trying even harder than they had ever tried before amen and I'm not here to try harder just to fail worse I'm here just to set my focus on the promise that he gave me and just move forward and I trust that he's going to bring me there because he promised to he said in Hebrews 12:1 if we could turn there together there's a couple scriptures I want to look at together real quick Hebrews 12 Hebrews 12 and one says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your mind let us look into Jesus the author that means he's the originator and the finisher of our faith who do I want to look at when I'm running this race who do I look at when I'm trying to navigate through life and make it from one end of life to the other without falling in the ditch to the right hand or to the left where should I put my eyes amen it shouldn't be on the right hand or on the left I tell you I I I'm not known for being the most U focused driver in the whole world cuz I like to see the deer in the fields in the house and this and that and this and that and every once in a while we feel the rumble strips thank God for rumble strips they' probably saved Our Lives amen because as soon as I start looking over here guess where I drive over here and when I start looking over here guess where I drive over here and for years I would get so frustrated because I would tell my wife I'd say hey look at that deer out there and I would look over and I would tell she's not looking and I get more animated look look look but she's staring down the road because she knows one of us have to be watching the road or we're going to wind up in the ditch so she started she made a deal with me she says you look at the road and I'll look at the deer I still don't think she looked at the deer I think she was just faking me out but the reality is yes people fall away yes there's D in the ditch yes there's train wrecks all over the place amen this isn't like this is a clean Journey with no wrecks it's not like everybody who come into the message is going to make it to the destination there's many people who identify with the word for many different reasons amen and we have to be we have to be willing to accept that it doesn't always work the way we think it's going to work and and not everybody is who they think that they are who claim to be and there's train wrecks everywhere and the longer that you serve the Lord the longer you walk this you'll find train wrecks all over the place but if I focus on the one who just fell in the ditch I'm going to feel the rumble strips in just a few minutes amen and worse I may go beyond that amen I've got to keep my Focus On Christ the author and finisher of my faith for he's the one that's drawing me to himself he's my destination he's my goal if 10,000 fall on my right and thousands fall on my left amen it's not going to change his word for me and I can't let that amen distract me and I can't let that frighten me because he's got a purpose in my life and there's a destination in my life and unless I F focus on that I'm going to find up I'm going to find myself derailed somewhere along the way now let's go to Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 Hebrews 3:4 says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end you know what that means you got to get on the board and you got to ride all the way to the other end amen that's what we got to do let's turn back to Matthew 24 Matthew 24 Matthew 24:13 but he that shall endure unto the the end the same shall be saved and was he saying again I've got to make it to the end I have got to make it to the end he who maketh to the end shall be saved he who maketh to the end gets the promise I've got to make it to the End Amen how am I going to make it to the end the only way I know of is the example brother B gave us in this little Parable is I've got to set my eyes Amen on the author and finisher of my faith and I've got to keep riding towards the promise that he promised me amen or I'm never going to win this surprise there's distractions all along the way and there's wrecks all along the way brother B said there's several quotes I'm going to read that says the same thing in different ways he says this is from 52 he says so you can just get a little too far on either side of the road don't you believe so I believe in an old-fashioned gonet message right straight down the middle of the road the isms is on both sides that's right he said there'll be a highway and a lot of people says that's the Highway of Holiness he says the Bible said there shall be a highway and he says and is a conjunction and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness not the highway the way of Holiness that's the middle of the road the way in the highway so that comes from Isaiah 358 and Isaiah 358 says and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness so brother M's telling us that that way he said there'll be a Highway and a way that should be the way of Holiness and he says people often say the Highway of Holiness but he said it's not the Highway of Holiness he says there's a highway and a way and he said the way is the middle of the road so now he's going to tell us what is this way of Holiness the way of Holiness is dead centner in the word of God Amen that's what he begins to teach us and tell us let's go to Matthew 7 while we're here in Matthew Matthew chapter 7 let's look at verse 13 says enter you in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth into life and few there be that find it men the middle of the road he says in this next message in 54 God who has provided away says friends I've always tried to keep a balance of the road you get way off on formalism you're just as formal and ritualistic as they can be people grab for that a lot then if you don't watch you'll get Plum off over on the other side and just as fanatic as you can be but there's a middle of the road where the true sound s gospel is preached and God moves in there vindicating the truth straight As the gate and narrow is the way but few there be that find it brother B's going to start talking as I go through this he's going to start talking about how we get off the road on the right and to the left and and he's not talking about sinful things like drinking and smoking and gambling that's not what he's talking about he's talking about cold formalism and fanaticism he's talking about taking the word and going either way with the word of God and we get off this road and we get wrecked up and we fall off but he said the true the way of of Holiness is the middle of the road right in 1955 Redeemer Redemption he says look stay where you are every man that's born of the spirit of God when he's set in Christ his eyes is on Calvary right in the middle of the road if he's just a little bit emotional the first thing you know he'll work out over here to a side and the first thing he'll become a fanatic if he don't watch and if he's just a little bit starchy educated he'll work over on this side and be so cold and stiff and starchy take all the spirit out of him if the devil can't keep you from seeing the truth he'll push you off the deep end with it which deepen either if he can't stop you from recognizing that this word and this message is the truth what he'll try to do is push you off the road one way or the other right e the cold starchy formal has no spirit in it or all spiritual moving into fanaticism and Sensations and get off the word and either way you wind up train wrecked along the way amen because if he can't get you to deny the word he'll get you to go too far in one of these two directions now in the message Hebrews chapter 1 from 57 now he says now on this side when people get converted their minds is set right on Christ and if they're just a little scholarly and don't keep under prayer they'll get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent and then if they're just a little bit nervous if you you don't watch they'll just get radical and Wild on this side see they go into Sensations and everything now but the real church is a real saying gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism now listen to this sentence listen to this sentence it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides amen it's not wild and following every passion and every sensation and every dream and every vision and everything whether it's in the word or not in the word or can be confirmed and validated or not we just follow after it anyways neither is it so stiff and so formal that we don't allow God to move and we don't believe anything that we don't see but the truth the way of Holiness is right down the middle of the road and it's a it's a good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God it isn't this cold side that says I believe the message I know the doctrines I got it right I'm part of the Bride but has no good warm heartfelt love for God Amen we got to go right down the middle of the road calling from both sides oh I love this friends because what happens is both sides leave the word one way or another yes we we we either leave the word to follow after whatever feels good are we leave the word because we have no more feeling no more compassion no more feeling for people no more desire for Souls no and we can become super legalistic and rigid and have no more love and no more desire and no more tears streaming down our face yes but somewhere in the middle these two things come together you stay with the word and you have the truth and your heart is warmed by the love of God Amen let's turn together to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 in verse 12 Philippians 3 and 12 says not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Apostle Paul was pressing towards a Mark that word Mark is a goal or a destination and he was had a mark fixed and he was pressing towards the mark and that Mark was the high calling of God in Christ Jesus amen he was predestinated for it he was moving for it amen he was destined for it and around Paul all kinds of travesties happened all kinds of backslidings and grumblings and fightings and disputings and and and all kinds of things happened all around him but he had already set his Mark amen and he was already pressing towards that Mark and none of these things could stop him from pressing towards that Mark because he had already set his goal there is a ton of distractions let's just say this way there's a lot of distractions around the Apostle Paul yeah a lot of discouraging things happened around the Apostle Paul amen he was discouraged by Fallout from Brethren he was discouraged by the judaizers coming from Jerusalem following him everywhere he went and then talking behind his back and trying to pull disciples away he was discouraged by Deus who left him he was discouraged by his split with Barnabas he was discouraged by a whole lot of things but he set them he set his face towards the mark of the High Calling of God and he kept moving on Amen I mean we can get discour wores about a lot of things and there's a lot of things to get discouraged about and there's a lot of things to get distracted with am mean we have Brethren who fall away we have other things that we disagree with we have doctrinal issues and listen Doctrine is not a dirty word it's a gospel word amen Doctrine is the covering of the tree that holds the life inside without Doctrine you can't hold the life in so Doctrine is glorious Doctrine is God's Gift amen the word is given for Doctrine amen and instruction in righteousness we need doctrine we love Doctrine Doctrine is Godly Doctrine is good but Doctrine wasn't given to us to divide us so we can fight it was there to keep the life in the tree right Doctrine was there to protect and guard The Life of Christ it wasn't something to argue about and it wasn't something for strife and it wasn't something for debate and it wasn't given for separation it was actually given to hold the life in so we love Doctrine yeah but I'm not going to take something So Glorious and turn it into a sword just to fight another brother I'm going to leave Doctrine as the covering for the tree and thank God for it amen and keep moving forward and if somebody else has different Doctrine that's okay that's not a problem amen but what God has given me is holding the life inside amen right keeping the little suck sap sucker from getting in and sucking the life out of it amen but we've had different doctrines and disputes and all kinds of things that get but that's not why God gave it Doctrine is something that's God given was Doctrine restored in the end time yes the truths were restored the doctrine came back the true teaching of the Apostles was here amen why to bring back the brid tree it wasn't given to us to separate and fight over it was given to hold the life in so we should be thankful for the doctrine God's given and not use it as a club amen we've had trials and difficulties but those trials and difficult these were never meant to knock us off the road amen they were actually probably given us to keep us going down the middle of the road we get distracted by our trials we get discouraged by bad things that happen and we don't understand why this happened to me and why that happened to me and why I find myself in this conflict and and this negative thing happened to me and the trials start to become a distraction to keep us from moving down the road and that's also not what God gave the trials for the trials were there Amen to bring character into our lives and keep us moving forward in Christ because we need him more than anything else amen I'll tell you something else with trials trials are a great motivation to just keep moving towards Christ because I want to get to the destination faster anyways I'm not excited about sticking around here any longer in the midst of my trials don't let me get distracted by that and fall to the right or left but oh God I want to press towards the mark of the high calling because I've got a destination and that destination is not in this world in this condition but I've got a destination that'll get me out of this condition May the trials of life and the pressures and the disappointments and the discouragements and all the bad things that happen may it be a motivation to keep me moving down this road because my exit is not to cause people to stop disputing with me that's not going to change anything my exit is forward on the other end of the board praise God you imagine the little boy riding down somebody over here says you ain't no good you can't do anything anyway and he turns over to yell at him that's not nice you shouldn't talk to me that way some point you just got to turn blinders on and say I'm going on I got to go on somebody doesn't like me I got to go on they don't understand understand me I don't got to they falsely accuse me I got to go on cuz that's not my destination in the right or to the left my destination is Straight Ahead there's all kinds of things the devil will try to use he'll try to use our own Ambitions and our own uh propensity to look for things that please ourselves so all along this path are shiny things shiny things that we like and shiny things we like to have and shiny things we like to possess amen and those can become distractions but that's not our goal we need to set our face on the destination there's all kinds of things that would like to knock us off but God's called us to press towards the mark of the prize for the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus there is a price to be won we have to keep that in mind in the message Escape hither come quickly from 1958 the prophet says you don't want do anything's wrong there's where the two great schools went off on the deep end the Armenian Doctrine you've got to do a certain thing and do a certain thing that's works and the other side the calvinist went bless God I'm saved I do what I want to see but the middle of the road is it if you love him you won't do anything wrong he's going to show that now there's there's two sides on this road that you can get off one's Armenian Doctrine one's calvinistic Doctrine The Armenian Doctrine is if you mess up you're back at square one you're done you got to repent you got to start over again it's Works based the other one calvinistic and it's all by grace and no matter what I do I'm going to make it to the destination so I can live any way I want and do whatever I want and both of these things are wrong brother Venom said the truth is right down the middle of the road amen and it's not there's a truth to Grace amen absolute truth to Grace amen there's a truth to works that God wants us he's ordained us to good works but we bring these two things together and all I want to do is please the one that I'm focused focused on so I'm not focused on the works and I'm not focused on the grace I'm focused on Christ and if I'm focused on Christ the grace and the works come together because that's who I'm focused on I'm here to please him I'm here to serve him I'm destined to move this direction towards the word amen and if I focus on that and move towards that the grace of God and the works of God will come together in the middle of the road I'm not focused on either I'm focused on him the problem is we lose our focus and we get derailed on one side or the other of debates and arguments and doctrines when we if we focus on him he's the source of all Doctrine he's what all Doctrine is about he's what every Bible verse is pointing to he's what every teaching is teaching about he's the one he's the source so let's focus on him and let everything pull together towards what we're focusing on we get focused on too many other things and it's just a distraction of the devil again brother B says it this way when a man is converted his eyes are set towards Calvary if he's just a little bit nervous if you don't watch him he'll he'll go over on the fanatic side if he's just a little scarly he will go over on the starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the same sensible Born Again spirit-led endowed Church of the Living God going straight down the road to Christ that's the real coming from both the sides one went one way one went the other shows fanaticism or either scholarly or just are too stiff to Bow they know more about the word than they know about the author oh man that's a statement they know more about the word than they know about the author oh God help us not to follow this path to know the words not life but to know him is life to know him you don't have to be a scholar you have to be a submitted person and when you submit yourself to Christ Christ is obligated to fill that vacancy that you poured out on the altar to him he's obligated to his word to do it and he will not fail you amen amen when we focus somewhere other than the destination than Christ we start to move towards what we focus on so many times we we can get into discussions and disputes and disagreements and and all of a sudden the only thing we're focused on is our our point because there's a disagreement on the message disagreement on Doctrine disagreement on a decision disagreement on whatever the disagreement is amen and we got then as soon as we get into a disagreement we take our eyes off of Christ and we put our eyes on the point that's in dispute that was never the point for the word that's never why God gave us the word not for disput D he gave us the word to point us to Christ that's right and the devil can distract Us by we've got to get something make some point get something right and get distracted what we need to do is just keep our eyes focused and keep riding down this board I want to turn to the book of numbers together Numbers Chapter 13 I think we're all probably familiar with the story takes place at ktie spia when Moses had sent 12 Spies into the land to spy out the land they came back and they started giving a report of the land numbers 13 verse 28 I want to begin at verse 28 said nevertheless the people be strong this is the report of 10 of the spies when they come back they they acknowledge that it was everything that Moses said it would be a land that floweth with milk and honey and all of these things but they said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anch there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwelt on the mountains and the Canaanites dwelt by the sea by the coast of Jordan and Caleb Steed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it Caleb was looking at something different than the 10 spies were looking at verse 31 but when the but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched un the children of Israel saying the the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it were men of great stature now let's uh verse 33 and there were there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which came of the Giants and we were in their own sight as Grasshoppers and we were in their sight as we were in their sight verse 14 chapter 14:1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be appr prey were it not better for us to return unto Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before for all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jeffan which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding exceeding good land if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into his land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for for they are bread for us their defenses is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not we come back they come back from searching out the land with two reports one report is the land is good but there is no way that we can ride from this across this board and get on the other side it's too high it's too narrow the bike's too wobbly the tires are this and the air pressure is that and and be besides we saw everybody else who tried fall off do you understand there's no way we can take the land there's Giants there's walled cities there's there's strong people there's no way that we can take the land and so what they were looking at is they were looking at the challenge amen of trying to take the land but Joshua and Caleb were looking at something different they weren't looking at the challenge of taking the land they were looking at the promise that God had given them to give them the land what were they looking at the destination the mark of the prize of the High Calling they weren't looking down at the board trying to cross they were looking at the word trying to cross and they realized according to the word we can ride right across this board why how are we going to do it how are we going to take down the wall cities how will we def fight the Chariots there's there's more men than us they have armor than us they weren't looking at any of those things they were looking at one thing one thing they set their Vision on and it's God who said I will give you that land amen and we realize that those were the only two who made it in they set their focus on that and as they focused on it they kept pressing to it and what did they have to endure the next 40 years they had to endure falling off on the right and the left and falling off on the right and the left in their Journey from Egypt till they finally entered into the promised land amen there was the failure at the golden calf there was the failure with the fiery serpents there was the failure at at Bale peor amen there was the failure amen with daythan and abam and Kora amen there was the failure now at ktie Baria and they would walk through the Wilderness for 40 years and they would watch all of their friends that they came out of Egypt with die one by one by one but you know what that didn't stop them or deter them because what they were looking at never changed the focus in the journey never changed and when it came time for the punishment to end and the 40 years were over guess who was ready to ride across that board and take the land the same too with the same vision they knew if the Lord Delight in us they're bread for us amen you talk about two men who saw a whole lot of falling away they saw Millions Fall Away Fall by one trap Bale peor 70 some thousand di now they murmured against God and the fiery serpents and thousands of them died they they they they thought Moses was lost they needed a God to worship to take him back to Egypt to bring him up further in the journey and and they fell at the golden calf you know discouraging that is you know how many family members or friends but what got them to the promised land because they set their face for the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you know what we're on a journey through a Wilderness but we've got a destination friends amen there was those who disputed Moses there was those who tried to get power and position there was everything imaginable was going on they tried to hybrid the religion they tried but you know what those who focused on the word and on the promise they made it to the promised land amen there's a bride in this day that's predestinated to make it she's not going to fall she's not going to fall off of this board why because she's the best riter in town she's not the best writer in town she's not the most skilled or the most gifted or she's got one thing going for her she's got a promise and she's got a focus yeah and if we focus on the promise I guarantee we'll pedal right across this board because this bride won't fall she's predestinated not to listen distractions come they're going to come tomorrow they'll come somebody else you love will do something wrong somebody else will fall somebody else will fail another dispute will come up another misunderstanding I encourage you don't look to the right or the left don't look to the right or to the left but look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith look to him he was the one who looked beyond Calvary to the promise that laid ahead and he walked to Calvary looking Beyond Calvary to the promise and endured the shame and was despised and rejected because he had set his face on another focus and he could walk the impossible of rejection and persecution and pain and suffering and he could walk it and not fall off because of the glory that lay ahead he endured the cross how is it that that we can walk in this world with so much disappointment how can we walk when all around us there's people falling to the right or the left how can we walk maybe we should set our focus on things that lay ahead amen amen and just forget about it put the blinders on and say I know where my destination is listen it can't last much longer it's not going to last forever whatever you're going through it can't last much longer just think about it life is only 80 90 years it won't last forever whatever you're going through it'll end the trial you're in and I don't know anybody who's been through an 80 90e trial they start and they end they start mysteriously sometimes they end mysteriously but no matter where you are in the journey it's going to end it's this is not going to last forever and we're at the end time when for all of us it's going to end there's an end there's a there there's a goal there's a mark there's a prize there's something to win there's a prize that at the end of this board we just need to write down it and don't worry about who all fell off before but they were better Christians than me and they fell they were better Riders than me they were fell they were more skilled and they couldn't make it it doesn't matter none of that matters there's a goal and I'm predestinated to make the goal so what am I going to do every day I'm just going to keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you know what Joshua and Caleb didn't know they didn't know how they were going to knock the walls down yeah they didn't know how to kill Giants and they didn't know where they were going to get armor and weapons yeah they didn't know how they were going to fight when they were outnumbered they didn't know how they were going to supply the army they didn't know there was a million things they didn't know but the things they didn't know didn't matter the thing they did know is the only thing they needed to know and I don't know how we're going to cross obstacles that we have yet to cross as a bride I don't know how I'm going to cross obstacles have to cross as an individual or my family will have to cross or this church will have to cross I don't know how we're going to cross it I don't know how we're going to overcome it I don't know how we we move Beyond it I don't know but one thing I know is the only thing I need to know that there is an author and a finisher of my faith and he predestinated me to cross that line and if I didn't believe that I should just quit now because there's no way I'm going to make it I just have to believe it I have to believe that I was in his mind before the foundation of the world and he wants me to make it to the goal because he wants me he's on the other end pulling me cuz an invisible string tied around my handlebars and he's over there and just keep focused to the one who altered our faith and is finishing our faith brother Bram says there's a thousand ways to die there's only one to live and that's Christ there's a million things that take your time and attention there's one worth focusing on that's Christ there's all kinds of ways to fall off of this road but there's only one way to stay on it and that's keep focused on Christ this message is a person it's the person of Christ all the doctrines are about a person that's the person of Christ the seals were Christ the unveiling of the seals the uncovering of the Mysteries it was all unveiling Christ the whole goal is the person of Jesus Christ where should I set my eyes and my affection on the destination amen how are we going to get there I don't know but if I just keep focused and if I just keep pedaling I believe I'm going to get there amen praise God let's all Stand Together musicians if you come please do you believe that the promise is yours can you believe like Joshua and Caleb regardless of what they saw regardless of the obstacles and the unsurmountable obstacles and the inability in themselves regardless of all of that they looked at the promised word listen we I don't know if you believe this or not but in the flesh we're the little boy I'm not talking about spirit in the spirit God sees us totally different but in the flesh we don't have anything going for us no big Financial backing no political support no no defense no great wisdom no we don't have anything the only thing we have is the only thing we need we have faith to believe the word of God and if we have faith in the word of God and can stay focused on that we don't need anything else we don't need supports we don't need props we don't need defenses we don't need all of these things we need one thing we need faith in the word of God and we need to stay focused on that and if we can stay focused on that and keep moving towards Christ it's all going to come out the way he predestinated it to come out amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank thank you Father for this day God you known before the foundation of the world what you were going to do you knew who would make it and who would not you've predestinated a people God you've come through all kinds of messages through all kinds of word examples in the Bible to show us Lord that your word is all always all that's needed your promised word is always enough it's always sufficient you just need somebody that will believe it that'll receive it and that'll walk towards it God we want to be those people we want to be your calebs lord those who will take you at your word and believe the promise regardless of what everyone else says we want to be Caleb we want to be the Apostle Paul who who pressed towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling Lord though he was distracted and Shipwrecked and rejected and every manner of horrible things happened to him but he yet stayed focused Lord and you brought a prophet in this day his life Lord wasn't easy he went through so many difficult things personal trials and heartbreaks and heartaches rejection and criticism strife Lord he stayed focused on the calling with you called him for God now it's our turn it's come our time Lord to walk down this highway in the middle of the road to ride down this board as it was Lord God there's train wrecks on both sides there's obstacles but God we believe you've ordained us for this hour we believe that we're part of the people that you've called to make it to the Finish Line to come to the goal of adoption to be your very representation upon this Earth and a many membered body that will become the people that you can reflect yourself through completely and that we'll take a body change and we'll leave this world in a glorified body we believe that's the goal that's the destination and God we don't know how to get from here to there we don't know how to overcome the obstacles but God I know that you already know you've already ordained it you've already made a provision Lord give each of us Faith to keep pressing on to keep you in focus and keep striving Lord I pray you'd forgive us for the distractions that we've allowed to come along to knock us from one side to the other oh God I'm thankful for your grace that keeps pulling us down the road yes god without you there's no way we would have made it this far there's no way we'll make it one bit farther but God we know it's you who kept us and you who preserved us you're guiding us and you're leading us and you're drawing us to yourself God I pray that you would equip us with the word like we've heard tonight to put the blinders on to let whatever happens happen Lord but to stay focused on you for you're our bridegroom you're our husband you're the love of our Al you're the focus of all of our attention you are the goal you are the destination you are the prize God I pray Lord It's become about so many things that it shouldn't be about but God this message is you presenting yourself to us it's you making yourself available to us it's you revealing yourself to your bride and coming in Union with her God I pray that you'd help us to make that the primary objective of Our Lives is to connect with you L we love you we thank you for this message you've given us we thank you for the word and a desire in our hearts to follow after you I pray Lord that you continue to draw us and use us For Your Glory ask that you bless your people as we leave here Lord may we go with renewed vision and focus God may we press towards that Mark of the prize of the high calling in you Lord Jesus we love you father we ask your blessings on
