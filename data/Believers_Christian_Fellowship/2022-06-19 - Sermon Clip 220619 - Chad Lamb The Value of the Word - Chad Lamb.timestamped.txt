[0:00] he's giving us a clear understanding he
[0:02] says they're talking about revivals amen
[0:04] and in his day they were trying to
[0:06] revive the azusa street revival the the
[0:09] outpouring of the gifts from 1906 and
[0:11] they were looking for that kind of
[0:12] revival that there'd be a pentecostal
[0:15] revival again and brother branham says
[0:17] there hasn't been a revival amen there
[0:19] hasn't been a stirring yet we've had
[0:21] millions and millions but no revival yet
[0:25] so what is revival revival then is not a
[0:29] crowd revival is not a week-long sermons
[0:31] we're not revival is not an avengers in
[0:33] the pulpit none of that is revival
[0:35] because brother brahm they the
[0:36] pentecostals had all of that amen
[0:39] during those revivals they would have
[0:41] manifestations they would have
[0:42] enthusiasm they would have good
[0:44] preaching they would have ecstatic
[0:46] worship they would have but brother bam
[0:47] said none of that's a revival yet
[0:51] here's what he goes on to say
[0:53] the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[0:59] there's been no revival there no
[1:01] manifestation of god to stir the bride
[1:04] yet
[1:06] so that means all of those things that
[1:08] through the 50s and 60s they were
[1:10] calling revivals
[1:12] weren't revivals that would stir the
[1:15] bride
[1:17] and he said there's been no revival
[1:19] there no manifestation of god to stir
[1:22] the bride yet
[1:24] see we're looking for it it'll take
[1:27] those seven unknown thunders back there
[1:29] to wake her up again
[1:32] he will send it he promised it
[1:35] probably now is bringing some clarity
[1:38] to the pentecostals in that day and he
[1:41] even begins and we'll read a quote in a
[1:42] minute he even has good friends and
[1:44] saying revival in our time revival in
[1:46] our time we'll read that quote next and
[1:48] he says but but that's there's been no
[1:50] revival there's been no revival for the
[1:52] bride there's been no stirring of the
[1:54] bride there's been no manifestation of
[1:56] god to wake her up yet although there's
[1:59] been all kinds of exciting things take
[2:01] place even in brother bannon's ministry
[2:03] there was like five exciting things that
[2:05] took place but nothing to wake up the
[2:07] bride yet
[2:09] first and second paul didn't wake her up
[2:12] it attracted her attention but didn't
[2:14] wake her up amen there had to come
[2:16] something and brother venom said it'll
[2:18] take
[2:18] those seven unknown thunders back there
[2:21] to wake her up again what is those seven
[2:24] thunders a revelation of the word
[2:26] there's a mystery in the word that has
[2:28] to come and when the word comes it'll
[2:30] wake her up that's the revival she's
[2:32] waiting for amen not a revival of a
[2:35] stirring not a revival of noise not a
[2:37] revival of a crowd not a week-long
[2:39] services she was waiting for the word to
[2:42] come back and when the word came back
[2:44] that's what would bring the bride back
[2:48] the word is everything friends
