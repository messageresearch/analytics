[0:00] god said let there be light and there
[0:02] was light and it come to pass but you
[0:04] remember before earth and all this come
[0:06] into existence it was all in god's mind
[0:09] but now it's just being played out and
[0:10] it being manifested amen so satan had
[0:14] thoughts also in his mind
[0:16] what he wants to do amen satan thought
[0:19] did not start here on earth
[0:22] satan thought started when he was in
[0:24] heaven
[0:25] is that right and that's what we
[0:27] actually just read satan telling what
[0:30] i'm going to do but what's so
[0:32] interesting when when you look at the
[0:35] scripture and you go to the message
[0:36] satan's eden the prophet said god eaten
[0:40] was established in righteousness
[0:42] satan eden is established in sin because
[0:46] satan is sin
[0:49] god is righteous and god's kingdom was
[0:52] established in righteousness and peace
[0:55] and life and satan establishment is in
[0:59] sin and religious sin i like how he just
[1:02] added it in in sin religious sin he said
[1:06] now notice how he deceived
[1:09] his deception as he said he would then
[1:13] he said he promised
[1:16] to do this
[1:19] then he refers to isaiah
[1:21] so what satan was saying in isaiah i'm
[1:24] going to be like the mohawk satan was
[1:26] making a promise
[1:27] otherwise i promise you
[1:29] this is what i'm gonna do
[1:32] god got promises and the devil got
[1:34] promises but the only difference is is
[1:36] god promises this to bless you
[1:38] satan promises to bless himself
[1:42] that's the only difference can we say
[1:44] amen even when you look in the scripture
[1:46] satan say i will be like the most high i
[1:49] will ascend it to heaven i will exalt my
[1:51] throne i will sit upon the mountain all
[1:54] of those are satan's eyes
[1:56] but then when you go to the book of
[1:58] ezekiel god got eyes
[2:01] god said i will take away your stony
[2:03] heart i will give you a new spirit
[2:06] god said i will do this i will call you
[2:08] from the nation but the only difference
[2:10] satan eyes is for himself
[2:13] but god eyes is for you
[2:16] god said i'm gonna do this for you i'm
[2:18] gonna take care of you i'm gonna change
[2:20] you but satan said all of my eyes is for
[2:23] me
