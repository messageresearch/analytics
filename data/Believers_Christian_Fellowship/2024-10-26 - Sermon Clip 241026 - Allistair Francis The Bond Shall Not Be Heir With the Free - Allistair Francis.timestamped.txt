[0:00] there's only one way to be a Christian
[0:03] the word Christian means Christlike and
[0:05] you can't do
[0:09] it you can't work it in yourself if
[0:13] you're trying that's a Bond woman and
[0:17] that's a bond woman's son right there
[0:19] there's no way at all you can do it you
[0:22] have to forget yourself die out to
[0:25] yourself and let Christ come in and Live
[0:27] the Life of Christ in you that's a
[0:30] foundational thing that we as people who
[0:32] believe in the open book need to
[0:34] realize I just
[0:37] rest just stop
[0:40] fighting know that Isaac is the son of
[0:42] the free
[0:43] woman I don't want to fight with myself
[0:46] anymore Lord I just want you to produce
[0:49] that life within me I want to just feed
[0:51] on the word I want to get more of that
[0:53] word I want to immerse myself in that
[0:55] word I want the life to come out from
[0:57] that that feminine Gene seed yes I'm
[1:00] tired of fighting with churchianity and
[1:03] trying to prove myself to people I just
[1:05] want to soak myself in there I just want
[1:08] to live the life that you predestinated
[1:09] me to be I want to live without reproach
[1:12] I want to live without feeling like
[1:14] everyone's watching me that I have to
[1:16] perform for them that I have to do what
[1:19] they think is right I just want to live
[1:21] by the genc that is inside I want to
[1:24] live by that which it can produce I
[1:26] don't want it to be my abilities or
[1:28] someone else teaching me about about
[1:30] something or asking me or forcing me to
[1:32] be some way I don't want to be a rule
[1:34] follower I don't want to be pleasing
[1:37] people by following rules and then
[1:39] because rules are always adjusting am
[1:42] right and you can just never attain just
[1:45] when you follow a rule they increase
[1:47] something or adjust something or change
[1:49] something and then we're going on for
[1:51] decades and decades and no one's getting
[1:53] it
[1:54] right I want to be what you want me to
[1:57] be let us realize we cannot do this by
[2:00] our strength of our own human character
[2:02] that is so affected by pride and
[2:04] arrogance I can't tell you how much this
[2:07] means to me how much it helps me because
[2:10] I I I know when I when I assess myself
[2:13] every single day I know when it's my
[2:15] ability when when I'm trying to do
[2:18] something where I'm trying to circumvent
[2:20] the word in some way where I'm trying to
[2:22] say something or do something for some
[2:24] kind of attention or to be right about
[2:27] something or to be more right than
[2:29] someone else you just know that Holy
[2:31] Spirit checks you in there and you know
[2:33] it's not about you it's not about the
[2:36] flesh it's not about recognition it's
[2:38] about what God wants it's about his
[2:41] purpose for me for today amen we must
[2:44] have his life come alive in us when we
[2:46] can produce this predestinated life we
[2:48] cannot go in the Rapture with our Bond
[2:53] woman produced life we have to have the
[2:56] revelation of the free woman and live in
[2:58] that that is our hope that is our stay
[3:01] that is our solid rock that is our part
[3:03] in the Rapture the bond shall not be air
[3:07] with the free amen praise be to God
