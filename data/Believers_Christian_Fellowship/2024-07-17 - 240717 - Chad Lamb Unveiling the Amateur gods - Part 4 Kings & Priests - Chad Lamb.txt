may you be pleased with all we say and do and may you find welcome in this place and in our hearts and in our lives we love you we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you thank you musicians amen um amen we're going to continue on with the unveiling of the amateur Gods this will be part four I believe if you'd like while you're standing turn to First Peter with me and and we'll begin reading a verse out of First Peter uh I just want to let you know that um uh many of you probably got the email we sent an email out today that this coming Sunday will be our first summer Fellowship dinner in the fellowship hall after the service so all the information is on the email or on the bulletin board so you can review those also I forgot on Sunday to mention that uh it was nice to be at the graduation open house for our two high school graduates sister Heidi bird and brother Keat Hatfield God bless you it was good to be your graduation and we want to say congratulations for that achievement also we had some college graduates that graduated this year we forgot to mention them as well sister Martha saasu graduated brother Gabriel golden brother Zachary golden and brother Samuel pittsenbarger all graduated college this year so congratulations God bless you all and may God uh guide you in your next stage of Life in The Next Step amen we're all rooting for you and we're all pulling for you amen all right let's look at First Peter together while we're standing Now 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 1 Peter chapter 2:9 says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light man God bless you as you have your seat praise God so as we continue on here we're going to take the thought tonight of um the subtitle of Kings and Priests and we see Peter's writing here that you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and so I'm I'm going to be emphasizing a lot on the uh priest that we've been called to be priest a royal priesthood and priest and kings and uh we'll just see how the Lord leads let's turn from here over to Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 we'll pick up another scripture as we begin Romans 8: 29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and so now we recognize that we have been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son and so Jesus Christ was the god man on Earth amen he was God Amen formed into the form a flesh he was God man and he became an example for us now we're the amateur Gods he was fullness we're not fullness and brother B says it this way in the message as the eagle stirs her nest said he is messiah messiah is the anointed one and we are his children which have a lesser anointing so we as Jehovah Eagle is a great eagle and we are eaglets he's Messiah and we with the same anointing are Messi hates amen anointed Messiah means the anointed one are are you anointed amen what with the same spirit that he was anointed with we have it in measure he has it without measure he was God manifest In the Flesh and we're sons of God parts of him come on yes sir the very works that I do shall you do also I might take a spoonful of water out of this ocean out here and you never miss it in the ocean but remember the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean is in the spoon same water that's just more of it out there so that's what it is so now he comes and he calls us he was Messiah he was the Great Eagle we're eaglets he was the Messiah we're messet amen he was the anointed one we're also anointed ones he had it without measure he had means he had a full portion we have a measure of the same life that was in Jesus Christ is in Us by measure and then brother I'm uses the analogy of taking a teaspoon and dipping it into the ocean that's a measure but in the measure is all the quality that is in the whole ocean is in the measure so there's potential laying in there that everything that is in an ocean is in the spoon so it's not the whole thing but it's it partial but partial doesn't mean that it doesn't have all the capabilities and capacity to be the same thing what is it ocean water there ocean water in here life of God in him life of God in us and we've been con we've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son meaning that's what we reflect we'll reflect that life Jesus Christ was the reflection of God on Earth and this bride in the end time is supposed to be the reflection of Jesus Christ amen so let's turn to Revelation now Revelation chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1 and uh I'd like to read verse 5 and 6 Revelation 1 15 and6 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness in the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever so if you look here brother B highlights this but he says the scripture says and hath made us Kings and Priests that means this isn't something that's going to happen in the future this is something that Christ has already done he hath made us Kings and Priests and in the church age book he says he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he ha he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon on the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom so now we are Kings and priest he hath made us my brother so clear to tell us that that's a spiritual Kingdom we ruling now and in the Millennium that spiritual Kingdom will be both spiritual and natural because we'll be ruling and reigning with him for a thousand years but try to be a king naturally now just go up to the government and say you know I'm a king try to cut in line at the MV and see see how that works for us but now we're spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom the same quote further down he says right now we reign with Christ having Dominion this is where we have our Dominion this is where we rule having dominion over sin as unbelief and all the attributes thereof we can rule over that over sin the world that's the cosmos that's this world order that influences us the wrong way we can have dominion over that wrong influence over sin the World the Flesh that's our own bodies that we dwell in and the devil amen praise God so I read that again right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and Kings unto our God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are UL your people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father so that is what we're supposed to be doing now the New Birth has come and recreated Us in to uh we we we have been recreated in him to be children like our father so we're here to reflect his life so part of this this this royal priesthood part of him making us priests already is that we offer him spiritual praise and through Sanctified lips we're spending our lives as a sweet offering so our sacrifices our s uh giving it as a sweet offering un him worshiping him in spirit and truth but also interceding and petitioning now that interceding and petitioning is part of the priesthood that's actually not for us but it's for others interceding and petitioning on behalf of others and so we are already Kings and Priests as priests we worship Him in spirit in truth we offer to him a sacrifice of our Lives we worship Him and praise him with Sanctified lips but we are also interceding and petitioning before him because that's what the priesthood on Earth was doing the priesthood had established through the Levites and through the sons of Aaron they were there to intercede on behalf of Israel before God they were interceding on behalf of God and petitioning God Amen to to to bring his favor upon the people to forgive their sins Amen to to to for whatever they were interceding and petitioning that was the role of the priest and now we've been made priests amen praise God let's turn together to Luke chapter 9 now remember we have to be conformed to His Image we have to do this in his likeness or in his nature so when we're unveiling the unveiling of the amateur Gods means the amateur Gods should look like God yeah it should be a reflection of God the the the the priesthood should be a reflection of his priesthood our our our kingship be should be a reflection of his kingship everything should be in a reflection of God if we're the amateur gods or a portion of God or a part of God it should be a reflection of what God is not something that's we've conjured up in our own minds not our own desires not our own will being exort exerted or hybrid or mingled in with the will and word of God but but it's something that we surrender ourselves to and his life comes in and lives through us and it has to be a reflection of his life so in Luke 951 Luke chapter 9 we're going to read verse 51 says and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his face and they went and entered into the village of Samar of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though it would go to Jerusalem and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit you are of for the son of man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to another Village so here we reflect the the ministry of the son of man and remember the ministry that's continuing on is the son of man Ministry continue on in Bride form because he left a part of his work that he didn't didn't finish he left it to be finished in and through the bride so now there's a continuation of his ministry and here they are in the day where Jesus Christ is rejected in this Village of the Samaritans and and and they don't receive him and James and John they get the idea like the Old Testament prophet let's just let's just call fire down from heaven and the and and they they feel like they're doing a good thing bringing judgment amen upon these people who rejected the Messiah rejected Jesus Christ and Jesus says you don't know what Spirit you're of for the son of man I have not come here to destroy life but I have come here to save life and so then if that was the purpose of the son of man what is the son of man's Ministry in you what's the purpose of that Ministry in you and I not here to destroy but here to save sa amen so salvation is part of the purpose amen of us being sons of God amateur Gods upon the Earth amen it's part of the continuation of the life of Jesus Christ let's go to Hebrews chapter 2 remember we we are a a royal priesthood we've been called we he has made us Kings and Priests but we want to know what kind of priest and after what order because it's not going to be after the order of Aaron because that was the Jewish order after the sons of Aaron that that has that has run its course but we have to find out what kind of priest we are so let's go to Hebrews chapter 2:14 now for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same but through death he uh that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to secure or to help them that are tempted now here's what's really important Jesus Christ came to be our high priest amen but how did he come he came in flesh why did he come in flesh he came in flesh so that he would have an understanding of what it's like for you and I to live in flesh so that he could be a faithful high priest so he took on not the nature of angels but the Seed of Abraham that means he came in flesh amen so I'm going to read 17 Again therefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be why did he do that so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself s has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted he was tested he was tested in the wilderness he was tested with all kinds of rejection and affliction and he un he come in flesh so that he would understand so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest so that means god came into flesh to become a high priest and he took on not the not the seed of angels not the likeness of angels but the Seed of Abraham to be made like his Brethren to be a merciful and faithful high priest and that he's tempted he's able to help those that are tempted he came down to be like us only he was sinless but he came down to be like us to taste of a fleshly experience so that he can be the right kind of priest and now think about this friends now we have been called into this this flesh we've come down in the flesh only we've come in the hybrid flesh and what kind of a priesthood should we be we should be able to be merciful and faithful because we've been tempted and we've been tested and we know what it's like we have understanding of what it's like to live in this world we have understanding of what it's like to be born hybrid we have understanding of what it's like to have a mind darkened we know what it's like so that we can help those when they're tempted God never put us here so that we could sit in an elevated position and call out the people why are you like this and why are you like that and why are you doing this and why are you doing that but God in his Mercy allowed us to come through hybridization through Fallen man incorruption with a mind alienated from the things of God having our conscience darkened and hating the things of God and having to be converted so that we would know what it's like to be in the world trapped in darkness with no understanding because we have to be a hyp we have to be a priest under our high priest Jesus Christ amen so we should have a degree of understanding now let's go to chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 4 we're going to keep looking at this priesthood of Jesus Christ because he's the high priest he's the Messiah we're Messiah amen he's the high priest we're priests chapter 4:14 says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin he that means he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities why because he was in all points tempted like as we are yet he never sinned he never fell but he felt the Temptation he was tested he was tried he come into a corrupt world and he know what it's like to deal with people he knows what it's like to get tired he know what it's like to be exhausted he knows what it's like to be hungry he knows what it's like to be a child he knows what it's like to be a teenager he he knows what it's like and he came that way so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest and we've come this way and been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and we've been awakened to who we really are but what kind of priesthood should we be having come this way we should be a priesthood with compassion and understanding and mercy Hebrews chapter 5 now for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things pertaining to God that may he had offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity why did God pick amen the sons of Aaron to be the high priest to be priest why because they're Afflicted with infirmities and they can have compassion amen this word compassion here where it says who can have compassion on the ignorant that means they can bear with them and deal with them amen with the those who are ignorant that they're able to bear with them and deal with them because uh on them that are out of the way for that he himself was also is compassed with infirmity so God now had drawn a man as a high priest Aaron and Aaron's sons as high priest and they can bear with the sins of the people they can deal with those who are out of the way because they are Encompass themselves with infirmities they understand they can intercede before God and say God I know what it's like he doesn't understand what he's doing would you forgive him Lord and now we've come to some way same way we've been encompassed with infirmities amen and it should put us we should have compassion for those who are out of the way amen we should be able to deal with those amen who don't understand and don't see and are doing wrong and making mistakes amen so that we can be merciful and faithful priests that's why we're here it's what I believe to reflect his priesthood in us he was a priest after the order of MDC MDC was not if we go on and read Hebrews he says he didn't come after the sons of Aaron he was he sprung up out of Judah where there's no priest he's not after the same order of priesthood of Aaron but but he's after the order of melkisedek what is melkisedek melkisedek was Priest of the most high God uh king of peace and and king of righteousness he was the theophany of God that come down and met Abraham after the slaughter of the Kings and he served in communion and Abraham paid him tithes of all amen and and that was was the order of melchisedec he was Priest of the most high but that priesthood moved into flesh that melchisedec that theophany of God was made into the Flesh of Jesus Christ he was Jesus Christ in a prefigure now he came down Amen to what to have the feeling of our infirmities to come flesh like we're flesh that that that now that malisic priesthood must come down and the malistic priesthood isn't after carnal ordinances but it's the priesthood that's after an eternal life an everlasting ing life amen because he had no beginning of days no ending of life no father no mother it was eternal life it was God's life amen that was moving down now it moved down into this priesthood it's a priesthood of life not conal ordinances but eternal life the life of God Amen and that high priest had to have blood for sanctification so he offered his own blood and that blood amen represented the life what life the very life that God had put into flesh amen that life now amen was given as a ransom for you and I so that the life that was in the blood can come back upon you and I and that's what brings us into Sons and Daughters of God and Kings and Priests so now what order of mzed do we have what is that order what do we have we have life it was an order of Life what did the blood represent all the time when the when the the ironic priesthood they were slaying lambs and slaying lambs and slaying lambs and they were carrying it behind amen the T into the Tabernacle and putting it on the Altar and and now taking it once a year into the holy of holies what were they doing they were showing that there's life there has to be life as a substitute for our fallen failed life amen the the whole thing was about life perpetually about life they had to offer a life for a life and the blood represented there was an innocent victim that was my substitute it was all about life but now Jesus Christ comes and sheds his blood to do what to purchase for us life and now his life comes into us and now we're a priesthood that's carrying blood amen because without the shedding of blood is no remission of sins and the priests are constantly offering blood where is our blood if we're a priesthood who's interceding and petitioning we have to intercede and petition with blood where is the blood that we intercede in petition with it's the very life that was in the Blood The Life of Christ the melchisedek life is in us in a portion making us a priesthood after the order of melchisedek after the order of our high priest so that when we petition we petition with a token with the life not just saying God would you forgive but God Amen I'm bringing to you your life amen I'm presenting back to you the blood that was shed the life that's in me I'm standing in the gap for this individual and I'm presenting to you your own life your own blood yes why can we do that because we were born in affirmity we were born in flesh we come after this order we understand or at least we should understand because we ruined the priesthood when we fail to forget that we were born in infirmity God still has inter ceders on the Earth yes God still has a way he's got a bride on this Earth who's part of a priesthood a royal priesthood she's got blood she's got a token she's got an offering she can approach into the holy of holies she can make intercession on behalf of others we shouldn't take this position lightly friends pray praise God let's go to First John I want to read a scripture that we went through a bit in detail on Sunday but I'd like to just review it if we could 1 John chapter 4 start at verse 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love an amateure God should be like God and God is love so an amateur God should have love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hear in his love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if we if if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us and so God is love and and those that love are of God and so when he says uh verse 10 here in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son unto the world that he might live through him and God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it was love that caused God to extend mercy first to extend a propitiation first God led the way because love goes first and and this is love here in his love not that we loved God but that he loved us so now we're learning about love real love which is God and this is the kind of love that we have to emulate so the kind of love that we have to emulate is a love that goes first This is Love not that we love God but that God loved us you know what love is not that my neighbor loves me but that I love my neighbor that's God's love God's love sent a propitiation a price paid before we ever asked for it before we acknowledged we had a need before we could love him thank him or give him any credit he did it first he stood in the Gap first he made a provision first he shed his blood first he went first This is Love not that we love God that but he loved us this is the kind of love we're supposed to emulate yes in verse 16 he says and we we have known and believe that love that God ha to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him verse 19 we love him because he first loved us and now hold on to that and don't lose it we here is love not that we love God but that God loved us and gave his son and and we love God because he first loved us now we think about that with our relationship to God but now we are the amateure Gods on Earth we are the priesthood on Earth how should we love the world how should we love everyone around us how should love be projecting from us in what Manner amen should it be projecting from us and how will anybody ever love us if we don't first love them because it says we love him because he first loved us so when love projects Sovereign Grace takes its place love true love has to go first the love of God goes first let's go to Matthew 22 we're going to read quite a few scriptures but they should be easy to get to close together instead of just keep your Bibles handy or your notebooks if you want to jot them down because we're going to go quickly through several Matthew 22:35 Matthew chapter 22 verse 35 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets yes so he asked him what's the greatest commandment he says well I'll tell you the greatest commandment you shall love the Lord thy God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind that is the first and greatest commandment so if you want to know the greatest commandment that's the greatest commandment and the second is like to it it's similar it's the same Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets if you can get this if you can Master this then you fulfilled the whole law Jesus mastered it and he fulfilled the whole law and Mark in The Book of Mark we won't turn there but in the Book of Mark it refers to the same statement somebody asking what the greatest commandment he says virtually the same thing but at the end he says Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these there's nothing you can do greater than this there's nothing that you can accomplish there's nothing you can do there's no deed done there's no commandment greater than these the greatest is to love God with everything you have and love your neighbor as yourself that's it amen praise God so let's turn to Luke 10 now Luke chap 10 now somebody comes to Jesus and starts asking him a question about uh what do you have to do to inherit eternal life and he said keep the Commandments do these things he said I've done them all from the beginning but then verse 29 he says but he willing to just ify himself said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor so he had to keep these Commandments and love thy neighbors thyself and but he he wanted to justify himself so he said well can you define to me who my neighbor is yeah so this is Jesus's explanation of who his neighbor is verse 30 and Jesus answered and said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to the in and took care of him and on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever he neighbor he wanted a definition of who the neighbor was so he knew who he had to be nice to and who he didn't have to be nice to so that he could have eternal life by keeping a few Commandments and but but Jesus then broke it down and he he didn't tell him he didn't tell him who his neighbor was he told him who to be a neighbor too cuz he asked which three was a neighbor to the man that was wounded he said the one that took care of him the one that extended love amen the one that did what that loved the man when the man couldn't love back he was conscious he was beaten he had naked he had no money he had nothing he had nothing that he could offer in the relationship but the the but the man amen the Samaritan man he went first and he gave first and he loved first and he did everything with no expectation of anything in return that's the right kind of love that's God's love that's loving your neighbor as yourself amen remember on these two Commandments hang the whole law and so there's a statement in here that I'd like to look at he said in verse 33 let's go back and read verse 33 but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him now this word compassion is used in the New Testament uh 12 times and it's translated to have compassion or to be moved with compassion and it means to be moved as to one's bowels hence to be moved with compassion having compassion and in the parth says for the bows were thought to be the seat of love and pity so when the man when he saw the man beaten and wounded and naked he he it he was moved with compassion it wasn't that he thought well Jesus said that I have to be nice to my it wasn't an intellectual thing he said it's the movement of bows meaning the Cent of emotions for the Jews where where love and pity comes from he was stirred on the inside and had compassion on this man and that compassion that love that was a very real love to him that was flowing out of him that love was extended to this man and that's what Jesus called being a neighbor it wasn't a duty it wasn't religion it wasn't it wasn't ticket to eternal life it was an outflow of something real that was in the man and so I want I want you to take note of what that what that uh uh compassion is compassion wasn't a thought compassion wasn't compassion was a move he was moved with Compassion or he felt it deep inside amen so now let's go to Acts chapter 10 Acts chapter 10 verse 37 he says says that word I say you know which was published throughout all Judea and began From Galilee after the baptism which John preached how God anointed Jesus at Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him what did Jesus do what did Jesus do in his lifetime he went about doing good and Healing The Sick who are we supposed to emulate Jesus he went about doing good and Healing The Sick and John first John says that he that saith he abideth in him ought also to walk even as he walked we should walk just like Christ walked let's go to Galatians now over to Galatians 6 Galatians 6 and9 the Apostle Paul now speaking to the church in Galatians he says in Galatians 69 and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so God has called us to go about doing good and Healing The Sick why because love must be projected in order for Sovereign Grace to take its place love has to be projected when Sovereign Grace took its place in us love was projected God went first he loved for we love him because he first loved us here in his love not that we loved God but that God loved us and gave his son sent his son So This is Love we must we must love first let's go to Matthew now back to Matthew Chapter 5 Matthew chapter 5 verse 43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect what are we supposed to do bless them that curse you you're supposed to love our enemies has it been said love your neighbor but but I say love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that spitefully use you and persecute you that you may be children of your father isn't that the goal yes to be like God isn't that what an amateur God should be like he should be like God well God sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust the ones that curse him and the ones that love him they both get blessed amen and so what what what what kind of life should we live one that emulates him and there's a reason I'm going into this so just read these scriptures and understand that this is the example that's been given to us this is the Commandment of the Lord this is what we've been taught in the way we should act love should be projected but there's a reason a very important reason why I'm laying this out when we go to to Luke 7 we're going to look again at Jesus Luke chapter 7 Luke 7 and: 11 and it came to pass the day after that he went to a city called Na and many of his disciples went with him and much people now when he came nigh through the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came and touched the buyer and they that bear him Stood Still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother and there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying that a great prophet has risen up among us and that God hath visited his people here comes Jesus into a city and as he's coming into a city he sees he sees a funeral buyer going by there's a man laid out there and and very quickly he discerns the situation and we have it here it says that he was uh the only son of his mother and she was a widow now Jesus lived Jesus lived 33 years upon this Earth I I would have a hard time believing this is the only buyer he ever saw it was the only time somebody was carried through a city or out of a city and off to a burial but but and this one something particular struck him because now he sees a widow following behind and this is her only son and she's a widow that means she has no means of support whatsoever she's absolutely destitute her husband has died and now her only son which is her Redeemer her future everything to her the one that will take care of her now he's dead she's left with nothing and it said Jesus I want to I want to read it exactly the way he said it and verse 13 and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her this is the same exact scripture that we looked at before with the definition that said to be moved as to one's bows hence to be moved with compassion to have compassion so Jesus when he saw this scene he you know this this Jesus was God in flesh amen he was here upon the Earth and he's walking on this Earth and he's not walking sterile he's not walking amen separated from everything around him like a robot only doing God said this go do that no he was moved with compassion amen something inside of him moved in his bows and and and and he saw this situation and he felt for the Widow and when he felt for the Widow he moved out with compassion and touched the buyer and he stopped and he said young man arise what was it there was something he he took on flesh God came down in flesh and in flesh he had movement inside of him a compassion for another human being amen another one that had no way to make a means of living for herself she was a widow with no husband her only son was now dead and it moved him and when it moved him he went into action because there was something in him that could change the situation that's the Son of God that's God in flesh that's not an amateur God that's God and his son what should the amateur Gods be like there should be things that move us remember brother brandham he was moved for the sick people he had a feeling for them and remember when he got upset in the whole sermon and standing in the Gap and he says I got upset with the people because they didn't hear my message and and he went he wanted to go you know run away and God stopped him and and then there was a brother who had a a vision or a dream and saw him coming down like Moses sitting at the table and he went and he come back and he was changed and he said now brother brother br's interpretation see Moses on the back side of the desert he had run away because his people rejected him and he lost the feeling for the people that's what he said he lost the feeling for the people and and he's on the back side of the Desert god comes to him and says now go deliver your people and he had so been rejected and hurt and wounded and ran away on the backs side of the desert his his bows of compassion no longer moved for his people who were in bondage and he said I can't go I stutter I won't go they won't accept me and all these excuses amen and and brother said he had long forgot the feeling for his people and brother R said that's what happened to me and then God corrected him and and he took his correction and he preaches standing in the Gap but remember at the end of the standing in the Gap he said I can't go out feeling this way he said I've lost the feeling and tell he goes I still feel like they ought to have heard it and he called him Ricky and ricettas and he says until I can have the feeling for the people there's no point in me going listen this was a man that was commissioned by an Angel and had a gift of healing to take to the peoples of the world but if he couldn't feel for the infirmities of the people there was no point in him going it doesn't mean he didn't have a gift it doesn't mean that the Angel's commission wasn't still right but it took somebody to stand in the place of a priesthood that would have feeling for the infirmities of the people because he knows his own infirmity somebody had to stand in the Gap somebody had to pray the prayer of faith somebody had to have feeling for the people say God help us not to lose feeling for people it's part of being a priest it's part of the priesthood Matthew 14:14 Matthew 14 and verse vers 14 it says and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick when Jesus saw the multitude was hungry he was moved with compassion and that's what caused him to break the bread and the fishes when he saw their sick he was moved with compassion and healed their sick when he saw the Widow with the dead son he was moved with compassion see in order to be a priest we have to be a priest that can be touched with the feeling of infirmities we were born in sin We've Come Through This World we've had a lot of Hard Knocks and many of us have different stories different things we've been through but why did we come in flesh and why did we come the way we came May maybe so we could have a feeling for the infirmities of people there's certain things that'll move you to compassion because you've been through it there's certain things that that that when you hear you you intercede you go to prayer you understand you have a feeling you can't get it off your mind you want to pray for that person because you know the feeling amen because your compassion your bows are moved and you go into action and start moving and what do you do you move into a priesthood of intercession and say say God would you heal would you deliver would you comfort I know what it feels like Lord I moved with compassion and now I'm presenting to you the the life of melkisedek your life back would you please God would you move on this situation what is that that's a royal priesthood on Earth today that's what we've been called to brother B said in the message why he said we've got to love one another though we different you got to love anyhow you can't Bluff it you got to really do it you got to and that's the greatest power they found in healing is love when you have sympathy and love for people trying to help them that's what brother BR said was one of the secrets he says by love he cast out demons by loves he heals the Sick by love that was one of his secret weapons was he loved people brother R says in 1959 from the beginning it wasn't so in this message he said you know you have to enter into suffering of a person to have feeling for them if it ever gets to a place that I can't feel sorry for the sick then it's time for me to leave the platform praying for them it's when I get to a place that I can't feel the burden of sin on people then it's time for me to get away from here because I could never do no good for God it's the feeling you have for people you know it's a love that you can project to the people that they know you love them and they love you and you can feel it and there's something that happens then oh don't don't don't miss this I'm going to read this last sentence you know it's a love that you can project to the people that they know you love them and they love you and you can feel it and there's something that happens then when love projects Sovereign Grace can take its place brother B said one time love is the most powerful force on Earth where should love be in the end time brother Brenham said in the end time it'll only be in one place it'll be in the bride there should be love to project there should be C compassion for our fellow man for our neighbors amen the guy who frustrates the Daylights out of you at work he needs an interceder when Jesus was nailed to the Cross there was an intercession taking place from a priesthood because as they walked by and wagged their hands and said he healed others couldn't he he delivered others couldn't he deliver himself he said he could do this and he said he could do that why doesn't he come down off the cross and nailed to the cross with them mocking them he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what is that that's intercession that's a priesthood calling out to the father father God would you please would you please forgive them they're not even asking forgiveness the priest is asking forgiveness that's intercession that's intercession and petition he's interceding and petitioning God on their behalf they's too ignorant to what they're doing to even know that they're doing wrong but there's one who's got understanding love and compassion and he's nailed to the cross dying for their sin and saying oh Father for my sake would you forgive them they don't know what they're doing what about like I said the guy at work that drives you nuts amen can you ever say God would you forgive him he doesn't understand what he's doing look at how he was raised look at his understanding look at the pain he's been through look at his home God please forgive him and let him go and open his eyes and heal him and bless him and help him God that's intercession what's a priesthood for a priesthood is here to intercede and petition on behalf of others why can we petition on the behalf of others because of my own infirmity and my own Affliction and my own Temptations amen I I know what it's like yes to be in that position brother B says in the paman church age when he preached it in 1960 he says let me walk like he walked let me speak like he speaks let my motives be like his motives let others find Jesus in me let me lose myself and find it Lord in thee that's it let me just lose myself and find it in thee just so enshrouded in Christ till there's no room for No Doubt just what he says now don't go out here and say glory to God hallelujah praise God you see what I can do glory to God you haven't got it yet that's not the way he did it no stick his chest out and say see what I can do yes sir I'm so no he never taken praise for nothing he gave it to God and walked humbly and sweetly with such an air around him till people just love to be around him once loved them enough till even he prayed for them constantly all the time and that was your example my example to do to others as he did to us so now I'm I'm getting down to the part that I really want to get to so we'll finish up with this but he had such an air around him till people just loved to be around him brother B said I can't help people unless I can love them and I love them and then they love me and then you can feel it listen that's where things can really begin to happen that's where intercession can really begin to take place and I want to I want to look at it in Matthew 25 so let's go to Matthew 25 and I pray that the Lord will help me to take what's in my heart and be able to share it remember when we talked on Sunday about creating an atmosphere to atmosphere around Jesus Christ CHR was love and he says wouldn't it have been amazing to be around him to feel his atmosphere and he go that it must have been one great big bundle of love and respects and godly fear there was something about him that people loved that the children Lov there was something about brother Brenham that people loved to be around people in his community and his neighbor and old buddies and and there was love that was projecting love was projecting here and love was projecting there and and if I could brother Brenham he didn't make every one of his friends believe like he believed to love them there was many that never come to the full revelation of the message they believed him they loved him they believed what he said was true and they believed the Miracles he did was right but they stayed in their Methodist Church and in their Catholic Church they stayed where they were they didn't leave where they were and come to his church but they believed him and they loved him and they believed he was even a prophet they believed the things that he said were true but they never understood the message to where they would come out of her my people they never heard that call but they loved the man I'll ask you a question now brother bram's friends in town Dr Adair and and and Jimmy p po and and I don't even know I mean the the mayor who was his buddy and all of these other ones who was friends and ones that hunted with him and they never come to the revelation of the message and they they never understood uh who he really was and they but they just loved him and respected him the question is did he fail in his friendship because he didn't get them to see the light of the hour did Brother Brenham fail I don't think he failed one drop neither do I think we fail when we love people and we project love and they love us even though we may try to drop seeds we may try to give them the message but there's something in them they love us anyhow they just don't understand what we're talking about they just can't grasp it I've had family members that loved me dearly and then they just couldn't grasp what I was saying they never spoke evil they never condemned me in fact they respected me all the time and they loved me dearly but there was just nothing inside that could go ding I get it because you have to have a seed to believe with and the question is am I failing my family am I failing my friends because I can't make them see the message and I can't get them to repeat it and I can't them that come here to church I'm not failing them because if they're seed they'll come any more than brother Brandon failed his own family and failed his friends and failed all all his buddies in Jeffersonville but you know what I believe he did for them I believe there was a priesthood on Earth an intercession and I believe he opened a door for them and made a way for them to come anyhow that's just me and I'll show you why I believe that Matthew 25:31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall he gather all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the Sheep on the right hand and the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was a hungered and he gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily verily I say or verily I say unto you in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me here we have people that brother R tells us clearly this is the white Throne judgment after the thousand years is ended the general resurrection of the dead has come we're standing at the white Throne judgment and his bride is Seated on his throne with him the bride doesn't come into judgment she's passed from condemnation he's passed under from Death un life and now we come and seated on his throne with him and he's judging Amen in the white Throne judgment and he's separating as sheep from goats not sheep and goats cu the Sheep are in the fold they've already been resurrected and raptured but as a Shepherd separates these two categories and he's separating them and one is going to enter into eternal life one is going to go into damnation and what is the dividing line what is he basing this judgment on this judgment is based on how they treat his Brethren who are his Brethren amen you find that you've got three categories of people here you have those on the right hand those on the left hand and his Brethren those on the right hand are the ones that are like the Sheep they're the ones that are going to go into uh uh the righteous that are going to go into eternal life the ones on his left are are typed with the goats they're going to go into a damnation Everlasting damnation amen so where are his Brethren his Brethren are sitting on the throne with him you've got three groups of people in this judgment so when you've done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me what did they do what did they do to receive entrance into eternal life they loved back Christ didn't have a revelation of to the message or they wouldn't be at the white thr judgment didn't have a c Gene of God to believe with but in some way they had contact with the elect of God they came in contact with the elect of God they had some sort of contact or relationship at some way and they come into eternal life why is it they enter into eternal life at the white Throne judgment this is Brother Chad because loved back and we love him because he first loved us why is it we want to project love because in projecting love I create an opportunity to love back and loving first and loving the way God loved and loving and giving and loving and sacrificing and and loving amen This is Love not that we love God but that he loved me that's love love is not that my neighbor loves me but that I love my neighbor that's love and if I can project love Sovereign Grace can take its place Mercy can come on the scene if I can project love I give an opportunity for somebody to love back and if somebody can love back they may not have a c Gene of God they may have nothing to believe the word with they may have no ability to receive Revelation because you've got to have the crystal on the inside to pick up the waves amen if you don't have the crystal on the inside it's just fuzz you can't pick it up and you can't blame them for that amen but why can they get into eternal life how can they enter in because they came in contact with Jesus Christ in flesh in you and they loved back this is why you don't hate your neighbor this is why you're not contener to the guy on the other side of the fence this is why the guy who irritates you at work you don't write him off and you don't send him down the road amen because if you do you cut him off from an opportunity for eternal life but what we have to do is Project love the way God projected love remember brother Bram said God doesn't send anybody to hell man sends himself to hell he fights his way the love of God has given an opportunity and man has refused the opportunity amen I want to be that opportunity and I want somebody to refuse the opportunity I don't want to refuse to give it by being hateful and contener and and self-willed and and and totally reserved to myself and pulled back from all Humanity but I'm a priest I'm a priest with life the blood remember the blood represents the life I'm a priest with life what life the life of the high priest is in me the the life that's went behind the veil the life that's purchased everything back that life is in my hand that life is in me and I can intercede oh God forgive forgive them for that they didn't mean [Music] iten sometimes we don't realize what we are I mean like we talk about it but then when our neighbor parks on our side and he got tire marks in our grass and yes sir yes I mean we we want a gospel that works on Monday amen when The Neighbor on a rainy day missed his driveway got in your lard and left a big rut and pulled out never even apologized for her never even had the audacity say I'm sorry I was in your yard amen what do you want to do you want to say God you know that neighbor would or say God forgive my poor neighbor he doesn't even know what he done he doesn't know how hard he made it for me oh and and you know you don't want to go give him a piece of your mind when he pulls back in because if you give him a piece of your mind and what if he turns around and gives you a piece of his mind and what is his opportunity for life if he's not a seed of God if he doesn't have the crystal on the inside how what's his Open Door how Hey listen sometimes we got to be reminded of what we are who we are where the royal priesthood where the intercession and and and and where where this is on this Earth it's right here and you and I amen let's not be blind to what God's put us in in this day we're here in flesh so why why why has has anybody here messed up unanimous why did you mess up why do you keep messing up why is it so hard why is it a struggle why does things slip out of your mouth and you wish you didn't say it why do mean why do you say mean things and why do you why do you do wrong things all the time maybe so that you can be touched with the feeling of the infirmities of everyone around us amen so that we can have compassion that means the compassion to bear with the sins of all of those who sin against us somebody somebody went around behind my back and said something to to my boss about me and made me look bad we'll get them you know what the reality is I've done that before [Music] amen I said something to somebody I shouldn't have said yes so I can have the feeling of the infirmity if I want to be forgiven why don't I want others to be forgiven in Matthew chap 10 remember we're talking about unveiling the amateur Gods Matthew chapter 10 verse 40 he that hath received you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward that means if he only gives just a disciple just somebody who believes in Jesus Christ gives him a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple just because he's a disciple he's not going to lose his reward amen if somebody can receive a prophet in the name of prophet he can get a prophet's reward but if all they can receive is a disciple and do that deed for a disciple he'll not lose his reward here's what brother B says uh I'm sorry I want to go to Mark no no I don't sorry that's the same it says the same thing in Mark 9:41 but it words it this way for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward now let's go to Revelation chap 20 Revelation 20 and: 11 Revelation 20 and 11 and I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works this is the white Throne judgment same thing we saw in Matthew 25 and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire it's amazing that when this judgment comes the books are opened and the book so the book of life either has your name in it or not in it but the books that were open amen he says and they're judged according to their works it's hard to believe but this is a works-based judgment at the white Throne judgment they're judged according to the works what works well what did Matthew 25 tell us the works were when I was naked you clothed me when I was hungry you fed me when I was in prison you visited me you know um let me read this sorry I'm going to read from the sardan church age out of the church age book the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the Judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the Judgment John 5:24 says verily verily I say un to he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into the condemnation shall not come into judgment is what it really says but is passed permanently from death into life but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the bride that's this group we're talking about further down he says now we do not need to guess about those who in the second Rec Resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the Brethren those who are raised and cast into the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the Brethren since this is the word of God we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact yes I love it next paragraph to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew 25:31-46 it does not say that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from ghats but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep from ghats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white thrown judgment the Sheep are in his fold they heard his voice the word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the Judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would make them joint heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share No Throne Etc with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved I'm going to read that again because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gia they stood for the children in a time of trouble we love him because he first loved us us we are the Lesser Gods the Messi hates the little Gods the amateur Gods the reflection of God and we love him because he first loved us these who receive life at the white thr judgment because of their love of the people of God and we love him because he first loved us why do these people love us maybe because we first Lov them maybe because we acted like our father and we loved first and our love went first and our love went before and our love was sacrificial and our love gave of ourselves and maybe that opened the door for them to love us back and because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved you know what I want to be loving I want love to project I I don't want Chad to get in the way anymore I don't want my own temperament and my own feelings I want to recognize that he has called me here to be a messiah he's called me here to project the love of God Amen to love sacrificially and to love first and to go before so that somebody can love me back and they can stand there at the white Throne judgment and when Jesus says enter you into to the joys of the Lord prepare they said why why are we going in what did we [Music] do cuz you fed me when I was hungry you clothed me when I was naked you visited me when I was in prison you'd come to me when I was sick Lord I I don't ever remember seeing you when you did it you remember your neighbor you remember that little old lady that lived next to you that that loved you and always was talking to you and you you couldn't help but love her back and remember remember that time amen and all of a sudden it'll Dawn on somebody I'm going in because of that I remember when sister lann's husband passed away and she had a neighbor that started mowing her grass shoveling her driveway and always watched out for her garage door got stuck come over that neighbors moved away says do you think God won't bless that neighbor for taking care of of himself in a form of a widow woman and why did he loves sister lanne so much because she was contener and mean and nasty and hard to deal with I don't think so when love projected he had some means to love back oh God and now here's something else that we have to notice why are they going in because when I was sick you visited me when I was sick you visited me when I was in prison you came to me when I was naked that means that you and I have to go through some things to give somebody else an opportunity to do something for us so we shouldn't go into the depths of Despair every time we have a need and we get sick or we get lonely or something happens or death in our family and there's a death in our family and a coworker comes and they bring a meat tray and send flowers and they come to the funeral and they say so many nice things about you care about you amen what happened we had to have a death in the family to create an opportunity for somebody to show love to the Brethren so that on the white Throne judgment he can say enter you into the joys of the Lord prepared before you because when I was hurt you comforted me when I was lonely you came to me yes man it changes the perspective of our life doesn't it we have to have sickness we have to have death in our family we have to have tragedy we have to lose jobs we have to do all of this to give somebody else an opportunity to care for the Brethren say God help us to be priests help us to stay engaged and loving and project love at every chance we get listen I've had people in my life that were hard to deal with I had a neighbor that was just particularly hard and he didn't like me and almost didn't like anything I I did and everything I did was wrong but every time I saw him I was as nice to him as I possibly could be and I prayed God please help help me to help me to find a way to be nice to this neighbor he hated almost everything I did but and it was funny because he started liking me and you could tell he didn't like the fact that he was liking me he wanted to be contener he wanted to be mean he wanted to be accus and he didn't like it when he when he yelled at me because there was a stick off of our tree Laying across his fence I said I'm sorry sir I didn't notice that I apologize we'll clean it up right now and he's like well well see that you do couldn't handle not fighting back but I realized the stakes are high friends the stakes are high it matters the way we treat people matters because it matters the way they treat us and if I want them to love me back I've got to project love first amen I've got to love the way God loves God so loved the world he gave God loved us first we love him because he loved us and they come into eternal life because they love the Brethren how is it they love the Brethren cuz the Brethren loved them first amen God help me to be like you on this earth like we said Sunday there'll be people that you'll never win over but if you tried you never sent anybody to hell they s themselves because they hated love and didn't want but it's not don't don't let it be our fault God please help it let let me not let it be my fault it's not going to be God's fault that anybody goes to hell cuz he sent love first people rejected it I don't want it to be I don't want it to be my fault either I want want to be like God on this Earth I want to love even the unlovable how could you love the unlovable because there was a day in my life I was unlovable I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies that hateful disposition was mean and contener what right do I have to hate somebody Who's acting like I used to act say God help me to be a priest that can feel the feeling of the infirmities that can have compassion and bear with somebody because I understand because I'm also tempted and living in carnal flesh and brother B said in the message the Messiah said now that is true God called Messiahs God called us and we become Kings and Priests and God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become lesser priests God and fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some messes oh my do you see it the same thing he did is in his church the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his Dominion he's King over his dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name amen men oh my there you are messes messes little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed of what the the main one anointed off of what the main one anointed off the great one that's what I want to be in this world a little Messi at so when the widow woman lost her son I want compassion to come out of me I want to pray and intercede I want to project love I want to love others so that they have an opportunity to love me back because who knows what that'll equal in eternity am we have no idea what the white Throne judgment will be like I don't know we don't know how it will transpire how it will happen so our little finite Minds just falled apart trying to understand but can you imagine seeing people that you fellowed with that you knew that you worked with that was your family in this life can you imagine what it would feel like to see them going into eternal life because they loved you back now can you imagine what it would be like to see them going into Everlasting damnation say God give me a heart to extend love give me a desire put your whole life inside of me so that I love the way you loved help me to love to be kind to be tenderhearted to go first help me God because I need your help when I'm done wrong help me to forgive because they don't know what they're doing help me to act like you acted when you were on this Earth and to be like you would be if you were in my flesh because I believe you are in my flesh amen let's all Stand Together sometimes it's jarring to realize by Revelation who we are what we are on this Earth it's a little bit jarring I don't think we've grasped the magnetude of it I don't think we fully understand the consequences for it but oh if we could just have our eyes opened to the possibilities and if we could just relax ourselves and allow God to take more and more control so that he can live through us and he can love through us and he can serve through us I I'm excited for what God can do because there's still life available on this Earth there's still an intercession going on there's still something happening for others and I'm excited about that then let's bow our heads together pray dear heavenly father so thankful Lord for all that you've given to us Lord so thankful God for the message that you sent to open our eyes and give us understanding and God you've placed us on this Earth for a purpose you have a bride on this Earth for a purpose we're here Lord to finish the commission to do the work that you left for this day to be lights in a dark World help us go we can't do it without your spirit Lord living in us God we just pray that you help us to surrender in a greater way God you have presented opportunities to this world in the form of your bride God help us to stay out of the way and allow you to work God we want to see salvation take place oh we want to we want to intercede for others and we want to intercede in petition on behalf of others help us God we pray Lord Those whom we love God help us to Project Life love so that your grace can take its place do a mighty work through each one of us as your priesthood on this Earth may we intercede and petition and may we see lives change and things move God we love you Lord we want to take as many with us as we can oh we want to have Fellowship in the worlds that come Beyond in the new heavens and the new Earth Lord we want those whom we love those whom we fellowship with those who we interacted with we want to take them in with us Lord God help us help us to project your love not a just a human emotion but a reality Lord that comes inside as compassion for the Wayward and the lost has feeling for those who don't know what we know Lord that our eyes have been open we understand what serpent seed has done what hybridization is done to humanity what religion has done to the minds of human beings God we should have maximum compassion Lord because we understand God help our compassion and our love to be projected because of the understanding you've given us may we stand in the gap for others we love you father we ask that you'd
