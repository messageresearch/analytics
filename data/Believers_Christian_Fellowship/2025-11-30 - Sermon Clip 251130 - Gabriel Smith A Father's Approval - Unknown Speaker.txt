========================================

When the Lord Jesus was on earth, he was very particular about even in the Old Testament in Exodus 22, he says, "Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child if thou afflict them in any wise." Watch what? Watch how God was so protective of a child that didn't have a father's protection. Not just not just a child but a widow. &gt;&gt; He would say, "Thou shalt not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and they shall cry out unto me, look, cry at all." &gt;&gt; Even &gt;&gt; God is so particular. He says, "If they say the least little thing," &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I will surely hear their cry, &gt;&gt; AND MY [screaming] WRATH &gt;&gt; SHALL WAX HOT, &gt;&gt; AND I WILL KILL YOU WITH THE SWORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S [screaming] TALKING TO HIS ELECT RIGHT HERE, &gt;&gt; HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE. AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU DO, IF YOU TOUCH A HAIR ON THEIR HEAD, &gt;&gt; MY WRATH &gt;&gt; IS COMING DOWN." &gt;&gt; He says, "AND YOUR WIVES SHALL BE WIDOWS AND YOUR CHILDREN FATHERLESS. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET ME see you lay hands." &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Be-c because God listen, God knows that if there's a child that don't have a daddy, &gt;&gt; there's going to be lacking in that child. &gt;&gt; That it's not that child's fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND GOD REALIZES THAT. &gt;&gt; AND SO GOD TELLS HIS PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE GET EXTRA SPECIAL CARE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE VOIDS IN THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES. That's not their fault. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's good. &gt;&gt; Look, he says this even in the New Testament. He says pure religion and undefiled before God is the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows and their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world. That visit is just not go see him every once in a while, but it actually means to look after &gt;&gt; to to look upon in order to help or benefit, to look after, to care for, provide for. So God is telling us that if there if there's a child that's lacking fatherhood &gt;&gt; and the dad is not there, we as the people of God &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; are called to fill that void. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's things that's going to be in that child that they're going to deal with that your children won't deal with.
