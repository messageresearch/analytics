[0:00] he hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[0:03] if you've been accepted in the Beloved
[0:04] then you're secure amen why did he do
[0:07] that because he predestinated you to the
[0:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ why
[0:12] because he chose you before the
[0:13] foundation of the world in him all of
[0:15] this goes back to God's desire and
[0:17] that's where our security comes from
[0:19] amen we live in a day where we've been
[0:21] returned back to what Paul taught back
[0:23] to the true security and that security
[0:25] goes all the way back to the mind of God
[0:27] before the foundation of the world
[0:29] before any anything was spoken to
[0:30] existence before anything was created
[0:32] your security today is linked back to
[0:37] them and you're just as secure today as
[0:40] you were as an attribute in his thought
[0:43] am this is what it means to they going
[0:46] to be in Ephesians again in leoda what
[0:49] does that mean there's a church that's
[0:50] coming back to what Paul taught coming
[0:52] back to the security of eternal security
[0:55] not in a false way where I'm eternity
[0:57] secure and I can do whatever I want
[0:58] where the Baptist ruined it but through
[1:00] the real genu genuine revelation of who
[1:03] you actually are who you are in the
[1:05] depths of your soul and what God had
[1:07] planned for you from before the
[1:08] foundation of the world so that we don't
[1:11] get tossed about like
[1:13] children so that we don't get moved by
[1:16] everything that happen where we can keep
[1:18] our feet planted on the rock of Jesus
[1:20] Christ the revelation of who he is in
[1:22] this generation and not run and not move
[1:25] and not get scared and not look for
[1:27] salvation from anywhere else but from
[1:29] the Lord
[1:31] that's what this Revelation is to do to
[1:33] us amen it's not for puff up it's not
[1:36] for knowledge it's not for argument it's
[1:37] to keep your feet planted on the word so
[1:41] that you don't move in every trial in
[1:42] your life because God knew this before
[1:44] the foundation of the world he knew I
[1:46] would be here he planted his seed within
[1:48] me he sent the water of the word to
[1:50] bring this seed to life I've been in the
[1:52] sunlight of this message growing into
[1:54] His Image what do I have to be afraid of
[1:57] and why do I have to run around scared
[2:00] he's known this before the foundation of
[2:02] the world that's what this Revelation in
[2:04] the end time is supposed to do to us
[2:06] bring
[2:08] security not insecurity not not you have
[2:11] to do this to be a believer and you have
[2:13] to do that to to be in the message and
[2:15] you have to have this that all breeds
[2:17] insecurity but the word brings security
[2:19] that I am who I am by the grace of God
[2:22] and he's called me he's drawn me I'm in
[2:25] his hands he knew me before the
[2:27] foundation of the world he planted my
[2:28] feet upon a rock the rock of this
[2:30] Revelation and now I cannot be moved not
[2:33] because of what I've done but because of
[2:35] what he determined before the foundation
[2:37] of the world when he made me accepted in
[2:39] the
[2:40] Beloved I don't have to perform things I
[2:43] don't have to accomplish things I don't
[2:45] have to manifest things
