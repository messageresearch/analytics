[6:55] house of the lord
[6:57] good to see everybody this evening
[7:02] we just like to get on into the word
[7:03] amen
[7:05] and uh that's what we come for to hear
[7:07] the words of life
[7:08] appreciate brother chad uh giving us
[7:10] opportunity to be here this evening
[7:13] it's good to have my wife with me and
[7:16] it's been a long time since we traveled
[7:19] bus
[7:20] that road pretty long
[7:23] we both about died with some woof
[7:27] this is just you know you're getting
[7:29] older
[7:31] amen but we are grateful to be here
[7:34] by the grace of the lord and see
[7:36] everyone's faces
[7:37] i would like to uh turn to genesis
[7:40] chapter 12
[7:43] and uh we'll read the verse of scripture
[7:50] i asked for the chad how long he
[7:51] preached so
[7:54] he said sometimes an hour and a half
[7:56] whoa
[7:59] i don't feel so bad dear
[8:03] amen but uh we i was just studying some
[8:06] things
[8:08] yesterday
[8:11] i prayed that it'd be a blessing to you
[8:12] i just couldn't stop studying
[8:15] and uh i just kept on reading and
[8:17] reading more kept coming
[8:19] that's what it's gonna be a long service
[8:25] but we ain't going to drag you to death
[8:28] they say the word death is being drugged
[8:29] to death so we ain't going to drag you
[8:31] to death
[8:32] amen genesis chapter
[8:36] 12. i want to go to verse 5.
[8:40] so abram took sarah his wife lot his
[8:43] brother's son
[8:45] and all their sustenance that they had
[8:46] gathered
[8:48] and the souls that they had gotten in
[8:50] haran
[8:51] and they went forth to go into the land
[8:53] of canon
[8:54] and into the land of canon they came
[8:57] and abraham passed abram passed through
[8:59] the land to the place of cycle
[9:02] and the plane of mora and the canaanite
[9:04] was there
[9:05] in the land and the lord appeared unto
[9:08] abram and said unto thy seed will i give
[9:11] this land
[9:12] and there bill he in an altar unto the
[9:15] lord
[9:16] who appeared unto him let us just pray
[9:19] father we just thank you for the reading
[9:21] of your word
[9:22] and we just asked and prayed that oh god
[9:24] you just come and speak to our hearts
[9:26] we ask these things father in the name
[9:28] of jesus christ
[9:30] amen you may be seated
[9:34] i have a uh
[9:38] subject tonight you have to kind of
[9:43] listen to the way it's worded and
[9:46] by the help of the lord we'll just try
[9:49] to
[9:51] get to it the best that we can
[9:54] the title is it's lots
[9:57] measures landmarks
[10:01] shows position amen
[10:04] lots measures landmarks
[10:08] shows position we understand that
[10:13] about what we get ready to read in
[10:15] several scriptures
[10:16] that god gave the children to israel the
[10:18] land
[10:20] which is canaan and that land have to be
[10:23] divided in lots
[10:25] which although each one will have a
[10:27] section
[10:28] that's actually been predestinated to
[10:30] them
[10:32] and a lot is a section but you can't
[10:35] have a lot
[10:37] know what it is if it's not measured
[10:40] so you have to measure it and then
[10:44] a lot actually have landmarks
[10:47] to show its boundaries so
[10:51] you got landmarks to show you the
[10:53] boundaries
[10:54] and then by having landmarks it shows
[10:57] you the position
[10:59] amen just like in the natural we have
[11:02] uh somebody gonna sell a lot of land
[11:06] that say this lot is for sale but when
[11:09] you go out there and look at it
[11:10] there have landmarks they'll show you
[11:12] how far it is
[11:14] how wide it is and so forth and that had
[11:16] to be measured so you would know that
[11:19] are you with me so that's why it's
[11:22] lots measures landmarks and it shows
[11:26] position so we're just going to show
[11:29] the process that it takes for these
[11:32] things to be
[11:33] and we're actually very familiar with
[11:36] the message adoption
[11:37] and pretty much that's what we're
[11:39] ministering on is adoption
[11:41] because uh we know that there's each
[11:45] believer in the body of jesus christ
[11:47] has a position amen
[11:51] so we just want to talk about those
[11:53] things how that god
[11:55] in this scriptures and in the message
[11:58] laid these things
[11:59] out amen because i believe that we're in
[12:02] a crucial time
[12:04] amen and we probably share some things
[12:06] with you
[12:07] and uh i know you know my heart
[12:11] i just like preaching the gospel
[12:14] amen i don't get into the uh
[12:17] emotions i just like preaching the word
[12:22] amen because the word is the word and
[12:25] jesus said blessed is he that is not
[12:27] offended in me
[12:28] so we are blessed when we are not
[12:30] offended in the word
[12:32] can we say amen if you really look at
[12:34] that scripture
[12:35] when he said blessed is he that is not
[12:37] offended in me
[12:38] he was actually referring back to john
[12:40] baptist
[12:41] if you look we'll see what the prophet
[12:43] god said uh
[12:45] you remember when they when jesus
[12:46] explained when john saw his disciples
[12:49] there
[12:50] and asked him he's the one shall we look
[12:52] for another jesus went down the line
[12:54] you go show john this and you should go
[12:56] sean how the i
[12:58] did that they could see the deficit here
[13:00] and then he dropped it right in blessed
[13:02] is he that is not offended in me
[13:05] the prophet god said john was offended
[13:10] i mean think about it the devil come to
[13:13] his mind
[13:14] why are you in jail john
[13:18] for preaching for jesus christ
[13:21] has he came to see you john has he came
[13:23] to visit you
[13:25] you are in jail he's outside preaching
[13:27] but you in jail because you preach for
[13:29] him
[13:30] see that's how the mind can mess with
[13:32] you when you get
[13:34] in the flesh and you remember john's
[13:36] eyes his ego eyes had gotten dim
[13:39] let me say man i promise you when your
[13:41] ego eyes get dim
[13:45] you get offended on things that's
[13:48] exactly right
[13:49] so i pray that the lord would just help
[13:51] us
[13:52] it's going to take a moment but i i just
[13:56] want to go through the scriptures
[13:57] amen you know i want to read a quote
[14:00] it's in the message adoption
[14:02] and i like to first listen to what the
[14:05] prophet of god is saying
[14:07] he says here so ephesians here
[14:11] sets us like joshua positionally
[14:14] you notice joshua after crossing over
[14:17] the land
[14:18] and taking the land then he divided the
[14:21] land
[14:22] he from here manasseh here and this one
[14:25] here
[14:25] gad here benjamin here he divided
[14:29] the land and notice oh this just burns
[14:33] our heart
[14:34] each one of those hebrews mothers giving
[14:36] birth
[14:37] to those children she spoke the very
[14:40] place
[14:41] in her labor pains where they would be
[14:44] positioned in the promised land
[14:46] oh it's a great study and i promise you
[14:48] you'll have to go back to genesis
[14:50] when they give me when they conceive
[14:52] they gave the name of each one of the
[14:55] the patriarch you just had to look up
[14:57] their name
[14:58] look up their name what it means because
[15:01] many years in the message
[15:02] i say i i don't see him telling i don't
[15:05] see that you know
[15:06] i believe what he's saying but i don't
[15:08] position the place in them
[15:10] but when i began to look up their names
[15:12] and then not only in genesis when you go
[15:15] to deuteronomy
[15:16] and then when you go to chronicles it
[15:18] start talking about positioning so
[15:20] that's why you have to run
[15:22] scripture meet scripture to get the
[15:24] whole picture
[15:25] can you say man you know i'm so
[15:27] convinced of this message
[15:29] when brother branham say things and i
[15:31] don't understand it
[15:32] i always know keep the right attitude
[15:34] the answer will come
[15:37] and it could take years can we say man
[15:39] it could take years for god revealed
[15:41] because
[15:42] you got to remember god reveals when he
[15:44] wants to reveal
[15:46] and no one can give you revelation but
[15:48] god and you can't make him give you
[15:50] revelation
[15:51] he gives it when he wants to give it so
[15:54] ain't no need to get mad why
[15:55] i don't understand lord no the best
[15:57] thing to do lord would you reveal it to
[15:59] me
[16:00] and he'll do it in his time amen
[16:04] many things i'd be wanting to know quick
[16:06] and it don't happen like that sometimes
[16:07] god revealed quick
[16:09] sometimes he don't he just wait but it
[16:12] always come
[16:13] god is never late he's always on time
[16:17] but his own time is not your time
[16:21] can we say man sometimes you when he
[16:23] shows up you say wow
[16:25] i wish you would came a little quicker
[16:26] lord but no he was on time on his time
[16:29] not yours
[16:30] and you say wow how could he do that
[16:32] because he's god
[16:34] he can do whatever you want to do
[16:37] because he's god
[16:38] amen and we can't say there's no
[16:40] unfairness in him because it's not
[16:43] because paul picked that spirit up when
[16:45] he was talking about the potter
[16:46] can we say there's unfairness with the
[16:48] creator no the power can do whatever he
[16:51] wants to do
[16:52] with the clay is that right you know a
[16:54] lot of times people talk about they
[16:56] don't believe god they don't believe
[16:57] god you know what i'ma tell you right
[17:00] now there would be
[17:01] no unbeliever in hell
[17:06] there ain't going to be no atheist in
[17:07] here they're going to believe that there
[17:10] is a god
[17:11] so i want to believe him now i want to
[17:14] serve him now can we say amen
[17:16] praise the lord and this is what he says
[17:18] here
[17:20] each one of those hebrews mother giving
[17:22] birth to those children
[17:24] she spoke the very place in her labor
[17:26] pains where they would be positioned
[17:28] in the promised land oh it's a great
[17:30] study if we could only get in details
[17:33] which would take hours after hours
[17:36] someday when we get the church fixed
[17:38] i just like to come and take solid month
[17:40] or two just to stay right in it
[17:42] watch when they each of those mothers
[17:44] when they she called out
[17:46] ephraim when she was in labor police
[17:48] positionally
[17:49] placed him where his feet were setting
[17:51] in oil just
[17:52] exactly every one of them where they
[17:54] were at and
[17:55] joshua and i like this part he said and
[17:58] joshua
[17:59] not knowing this amen because joshua
[18:02] wasn't born
[18:04] you're talking about hundreds and
[18:05] hundreds and hundreds of years later
[18:07] joshua wasn't born
[18:08] he said joshua's not knowing this but by
[18:12] inspiration
[18:14] led of the holy spirit after being into
[18:17] the promised land
[18:18] gave each man his promise exactly what
[18:21] the holy spirit
[18:22] promised through the birth back there
[18:25] can we say amen
[18:26] so it goes to joshua wasn't there but
[18:29] joshua under inspiration
[18:31] but we're going to find out in the
[18:33] scripture
[18:34] when joshua was giving them their
[18:36] inheritance it was
[18:38] actually more than joshua
[18:41] we'll finally see it in the scripture
[18:43] the priest had to be with him
[18:46] the urine thurman had to be there
[18:49] all of those things was involved with
[18:52] positioning
[18:53] are you with me and he says here
[18:57] how that god i want you to just really
[18:59] listen to this part
[19:02] how that god has sent some in the church
[19:06] through labor pains
[19:10] we're talking about positioning
[19:13] everybody wants one
[19:14] some try to make themselves fit in one
[19:17] some
[19:17] try to create some but
[19:20] he says here through labor
[19:24] pains we are being positioned
[19:28] people want position but they don't want
[19:29] that they don't want pain
[19:32] but according to what the prophet is
[19:33] saying here labor
[19:36] pains and he says right here
[19:40] oh they get tremendous sometimes
[19:43] when the church is groaning under the
[19:45] persecution of the outside world
[19:48] believing on the lord jesus that the
[19:50] promise of the holy ghost is just as
[19:52] real as to us
[19:53] as it was to pentecost how they groan
[19:57] cry under labor pains but when they are
[20:00] born
[20:01] and positionally born into the kingdom
[20:03] of god
[20:04] then the holy ghost has set in the
[20:07] church
[20:08] some apostles some prophets some
[20:10] teachers
[20:12] and some uh evangelists then
[20:15] he give into their speaking with tongues
[20:18] interpretation of tongue
[20:19] knowledge wisdom gift of healing all
[20:22] kinds of miracles we consider
[20:24] listen to the language that he's talking
[20:26] about there's all types of positions
[20:30] it's not just one it's all types he even
[20:34] talking about knowledge wisdom gifts all
[20:36] of these things
[20:37] are positions but god has to put them
[20:42] in their proper position you see
[20:45] pentecost
[20:46] had the gifts but they had no order
[20:49] so god had to send a prophet to this day
[20:51] to get the gifts
[20:52] and put them in order and he put the
[20:54] gifts in order
[20:55] by the word and we understand pentecost
[20:58] didn't want the word
[20:59] so they could not be positioned but god
[21:03] has a bride
[21:04] she's going to have her rightful place
[21:07] she's going to come to her rightful
[21:09] place
[21:09] and it's going to be done by the
[21:11] inspiration of the holy spirit
[21:13] and by the word but every individual is
[21:16] going to have to be obedient to the holy
[21:18] spirit
[21:18] because it ain't the position you want
[21:22] is what he has already ordained for it
[21:24] to be
[21:25] so we'll have to catch the mind of god
[21:27] and the prophet god said that's why each
[21:29] individual would need
[21:30] to pray to god so that god would show
[21:32] them his will
[21:33] for their life and many of us probably
[21:35] don't even do that we want the pastor to
[21:37] show us
[21:38] we want mama to show us we want daddy to
[21:40] show we want friends to show
[21:42] there's only one if it's god's kingdom
[21:45] he
[21:46] and he got positions put there he's the
[21:48] only one i can show you where it's
[21:49] supposed to be
[21:50] you see there's been too many problems
[21:52] down through the years even in the
[21:54] message ranked
[21:55] people want to position people where
[21:57] they think they should be
[21:59] can we say man i'll be hearing all sorts
[22:01] of things so i'm going to try to
[22:03] position the minister
[22:04] well disabilities have got a certain
[22:05] spot and dismiss the god all those
[22:07] things are true
[22:08] but god has to put him there and when
[22:11] god puts a person there it'll be
[22:13] publicly known
[22:14] nobody has to push themselves into
[22:16] nothing
[22:18] because god does it amen and he says
[22:21] right here
[22:22] now uh we understand
[22:25] what we read here in genesis 12 just
[22:27] follow along with me
[22:29] i read genesis 12 just for the simple
[22:31] fact
[22:32] to show where the promise was that the
[22:35] canaan was promised to them
[22:37] amen god gave the promise to abraham and
[22:39] told him thy seed is going to actually
[22:42] have this land belongs to them and we
[22:45] know the story
[22:46] all down through the book of genesis how
[22:47] things happen the children of israel
[22:49] wind up in egypt
[22:51] amen and they wind up in egypt pretty
[22:53] much for rejecting joseph they rejecting
[22:55] spiritual things
[22:57] the brother and rejecting joseph and so
[22:58] forth and uh
[23:00] every time you reject spiritual things
[23:02] it always going to put you in a worldly
[23:04] egypt condition
[23:06] can we say amen so but then i want to
[23:09] jump over here to exodus chapter three
[23:12] exodus chapter three and verse eight and
[23:15] he says
[23:15] i am come down to deliver them out of
[23:17] the hand of the egyptians
[23:19] and to bring them up out of that land
[23:22] into a good land and large
[23:25] into a land flowing with milk and honey
[23:28] into the place of the canaanites and the
[23:30] high tides
[23:31] and the amorites notice what he's saying
[23:33] i'ma bring them out of
[23:35] that land into a good land otherwise i'm
[23:38] gonna bring them out of egypt
[23:39] into the land that belongs to them which
[23:42] is canaan
[23:43] amen now we understand very well that
[23:46] israel the things that god did through
[23:48] israel he actually do
[23:50] it types you and me in the spiritual
[23:52] realm so he took them from a natural
[23:55] land
[23:56] to a natural land but he don't brought
[23:58] you and me
[23:59] out of a spiritual condition a bad
[24:01] spiritual condition
[24:02] and to the right spiritual condition so
[24:05] we need to keep the parallels how that
[24:07] what god did to israel he'd do the same
[24:10] thing
[24:10] to you and me amen so let's just keep
[24:14] going here for a moment
[24:16] he said now i want to go back into
[24:18] adoption two
[24:19] he says did you notice moses that great
[24:22] miracle performer
[24:24] that brought down israel down through
[24:26] the land brought them up to the promised
[24:28] land land
[24:29] but did not place their inheritance to
[24:32] them in other words
[24:33] moses could only take them so far and we
[24:36] know that joshua had to take them over
[24:39] he said he did not give them their
[24:41] inheritance
[24:42] he led them up to the land but joshua
[24:46] divided the land to the people now he's
[24:49] going to bring that
[24:50] parallel to what christ did he said is
[24:53] that right
[24:54] christ brought the church up to the
[24:56] place
[24:57] to where the possession was made to them
[25:00] was given to them just to jordan to
[25:03] cross
[25:04] but the holy spirit did you realize even
[25:06] jesus
[25:07] when he was even in a body of flesh he
[25:10] could not give us a position
[25:15] couldn't do it how could he do it in the
[25:18] body of flesh
[25:20] when it takes the holy spirit to give
[25:21] you your position
[25:23] he couldn't chop his piece body up in
[25:25] little bitty pieces and send it down to
[25:26] the agent and say here's a little paul a
[25:28] little
[25:29] no he couldn't do that he said but it's
[25:31] expedient to you that i leave
[25:33] because if i don't leave the comforter
[25:35] won't come and it's the holy spirit that
[25:37] puts us in play
[25:38] that's why jesus took them only so far
[25:41] he talked about
[25:42] positions and so forth but on the day of
[25:44] pentecost when the holy spirit come down
[25:46] it was the holy spirit now positioning
[25:49] the believers
[25:50] but we're going to have to understand
[25:52] about positioning
[25:53] in the book of acts that was the holy
[25:55] ghost reckoning the apostles and the
[25:57] believers there
[25:58] but you got to understand something even
[26:00] though the holy spirit
[26:01] was working in their lives there was no
[26:04] church order until paul came
[26:08] paul had to set the church in order
[26:11] so a prophet has a lot to do even with
[26:14] the adoption process
[26:15] that we go through we have to have a
[26:17] prophet to place these positions
[26:19] the way that they're supposed to be many
[26:21] don't agree with that that's fine but
[26:23] i'm just telling you what i believe
[26:26] amen and listen what he says he says
[26:32] christ brought the church up to the
[26:33] place to where their possession was made
[26:35] to them
[26:37] was given to them just the jordan to
[26:39] cross
[26:40] but the holy spirit is the one who sets
[26:42] the church in
[26:43] order the joshua of today puts the
[26:46] church
[26:46] in its order giving to each one gifts
[26:51] places positions
[26:54] and he is the voice of god speaking to
[26:57] the inner man
[26:58] that christ has saved the holy ghost
[27:01] notice now that goes to show you back
[27:03] and forth what i said
[27:04] is the holy spirit that positions you
[27:07] but god
[27:08] has an order and i believe every member
[27:11] of the bride of jesus
[27:12] christ is going to have their position
[27:14] know their place
[27:15] before we leave here i believe that
[27:19] praise the lord because god has allowed
[27:22] us to go down through the years
[27:24] a lot of mistakes misinterpretation
[27:27] misunderstandings
[27:28] he allowed those things to happen down
[27:30] through the years there's not one
[27:31] preacher that i don't know of
[27:33] don't have to have to go back and say
[27:34] church i was wrong
[27:38] that don't make the preacher small it
[27:41] makes him that he loves god
[27:42] he want to be right but you got some
[27:46] preachers won't admit they're wrong
[27:48] because of pride hello
[27:51] can we say amen there's i got some
[27:54] respect for brother branham a man
[27:56] in that office of a prophet visitation
[28:00] straight from the angel of god but is so
[28:03] humble enough to get up in the pulpit
[28:05] and say i was wrong
[28:06] not meaning to do that today because of
[28:08] pride you can ask my church i got no
[28:11] problem saying i'm wrong when i'm wrong
[28:13] i got no problem saying i'm right when
[28:15] i'm right either
[28:18] praise the lord it's that just the way
[28:20] that it goes
[28:22] amen but notice now let's just keep
[28:24] going down here
[28:26] the holy spirit is the one who sets the
[28:29] church in order
[28:30] that joshua of the day put the church in
[28:32] order
[28:33] giving each one gifts now i want to go
[28:37] over here to numbers 26 because
[28:41] we got to understand something brother
[28:42] says the children of israel
[28:45] they have been taught through their
[28:47] fathers that we're going to have a land
[28:50] flowing with milk and honey they knew
[28:52] that
[28:53] but getting to the land is one thing
[28:56] they knew that
[28:57] but they had to it had to be divinely
[28:59] revealed to them
[29:00] what their lot was we know we're the
[29:03] bride of
[29:04] christ we believe we're the bride of
[29:06] christ but it hasn't been revealed to
[29:08] you
[29:09] what your life is your place is
[29:13] what your purpose is because there's
[29:15] power
[29:16] in position when you know your position
[29:19] it's a power
[29:20] there it's an authority there something
[29:23] you ain't got to push yourself into
[29:25] make yourself get into it automatically
[29:27] works
[29:29] because you're in your place can we say
[29:31] amen
[29:32] amen that's why uh uh people today
[29:36] in the christian world even the
[29:38] denominational world
[29:40] they talk about the things of god we
[29:42] listen to certain things they say
[29:43] we know they don't have a clue what
[29:45] they're saying because they have not
[29:47] recognized their day
[29:49] in this messenger we're not recognizing
[29:51] your day in this message you never can
[29:53] even know your
[29:54] place in the age that you're in so god
[29:56] has to set
[29:57] us see when it comes to adoption it goes
[30:00] a long way
[30:01] it places us in the age it places us in
[30:05] the land
[30:06] it places us in the family it places us
[30:08] as an individual
[30:10] and it also places you in the church
[30:15] praise the lord and uh don't worry i
[30:18] ain't gonna preach all of the night but
[30:19] it's just
[30:20] it's just a real uh a big area you know
[30:23] it really is amen but we
[30:26] i'm more interested in now uh uh
[30:29] to just bring some things up how the
[30:31] holy spirit works
[30:33] versus the way we think it's supposed to
[30:36] be
[30:37] amen now i want you to notice in numbers
[30:40] chapter 26
[30:43] it said and we want to go to verse 52 it
[30:46] says and the lord speaker to moses
[30:48] saying of the deeds the land shall be
[30:51] divided
[30:52] for an inheritance according to the
[30:54] number of names now you remember when
[30:56] he's talking to moses they ain't got
[30:58] there yet
[30:59] they're they're on their way there so
[31:02] even
[31:03] according to the name the land is going
[31:05] to even be divided by names
[31:07] names have something to do with it and
[31:09] he says from here
[31:13] verse 2 i'm sorry verse 54
[31:16] to many thou shalt give them more
[31:18] inheritance
[31:19] and to few thou shalt give the less
[31:21] inheritance
[31:22] to everyone shall his inheritance be
[31:25] given according to those
[31:27] that were numbered of him god is laying
[31:30] everything
[31:31] he let you know some gonna have a few
[31:33] land so i'm gonna have a lot of land
[31:36] it's gonna depend on the tribe what the
[31:38] needs are
[31:39] and how god wants them to be positioned
[31:42] because what we have to remember
[31:43] when the children of israel was put into
[31:46] their position in that land by them
[31:50] being in a rightful position
[31:51] they was able to benefit the other
[31:53] tribes being in your position
[31:56] is just not your personal benefit god
[31:58] put you in a position
[32:00] so it'll be a benefit to the body of
[32:02] jesus christ
[32:03] that's what the purpose is for that's
[32:05] why we ain't got our little private
[32:07] little thoughts our private little
[32:08] ministry
[32:09] our private little ways no we're called
[32:12] to be a blessing one to another
[32:15] can we say amen that's why you know he
[32:17] says to some big
[32:18] some little i look at that even in
[32:21] churches
[32:22] every church is not ordained to be big
[32:25] every church is not ordained to be small
[32:28] there's all different churches
[32:30] amen you got some small some big it
[32:32] don't matter it's still the bride of
[32:34] jesus christ
[32:35] and whatever god has positioned that
[32:37] ministry
[32:38] if god called that man to have a small
[32:41] church he will
[32:42] never have a large congregation if you
[32:44] call the man they have a large
[32:46] congregation
[32:46] it'll always grow and never be small god
[32:49] chooses those things
[32:52] he ordains those things can we say man
[32:55] because you know even amongst sometimes
[32:56] uh people say well i wish our church
[32:58] would be
[32:59] if god didn't dainty to be big it ain't
[33:00] gonna happen
[33:02] what your problem is you got your eyes
[33:04] looking at other places you need to be
[33:06] focused on
[33:06] what's going on in your assembly and see
[33:09] where you can be a blessing
[33:10] there can we say amen praise god
[33:13] now notice what he says here verse 55
[33:17] notwithstanding the land shall be
[33:19] divided
[33:20] by lot according to the names of the
[33:23] tribes of their fathers
[33:25] shall they inherit it so now god now
[33:27] it's a big land
[33:29] but it's lots within the land
[33:32] and notice what he's saying here it
[33:34] shall be divided by
[33:36] lot so we understand here uh we got you
[33:39] got to remember it's a big land and it's
[33:42] 12
[33:42] tribes how it worked each
[33:45] what most what joshua would do they
[33:48] would take the father of the tribe
[33:50] and show them the lot amen
[33:54] then the father of the tribe will go
[33:57] down to the families
[33:58] and show them their portion in the lot
[34:02] and then the family the husband the
[34:04] father he makes sure he lets his
[34:06] children know
[34:07] where your lot is where your inheritance
[34:10] is he let
[34:11] that's how it comes down are you with me
[34:14] so
[34:14] no so it's 12 tribes and they all be
[34:17] separated in their own position just the
[34:20] same as the bride of jesus christ the
[34:21] bride is all around the world
[34:24] different churches different churches
[34:25] but we look that in the sight of god
[34:27] as one but each one of us has a how many
[34:30] of you know
[34:31] each church has an anointing each church
[34:34] has a spirit
[34:36] and i'm not talking about well we got
[34:38] good and bad spirits i might always just
[34:39] be honest
[34:40] but you but you're understanding what
[34:42] i'm saying but
[34:43] here's the problem i find around the
[34:46] message
[34:48] and you find the same thing even in is
[34:51] in israel you remember the prophet god
[34:53] would say ephraim can't
[34:55] take manasseh's corner he can't take
[34:58] manasseh's place
[35:00] he needs to stay in his place can we say
[35:03] man
[35:03] and i believe that it's the same thing
[35:05] we have to respect
[35:06] one another of what god has positioned
[35:10] us to be that's what brings unity
[35:13] but i find today many want to complain
[35:16] about this one
[35:18] this church and that church that that
[35:20] turns me off can we say amen
[35:22] it shouldn't be that way brother and
[35:23] sister we got to respect
[35:25] one another for what we are
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] man i tell you if you really want the
[35:31] church position real nice
[35:33] get get families in the church position
[35:37] that helps the church right there when
[35:39] families know
[35:40] where their position who they are we'll
[35:43] get to that
[35:45] hopefully about 10 o'clock
[35:48] amen can we go on but i want you to
[35:51] notice
[35:53] verse 56 according to the light
[35:57] shall the possession death of be divided
[36:00] between
[36:00] many and few god is laying all of these
[36:04] things out
[36:05] they ain't even got there yet but when
[36:08] joshua comes and the inspiration strikes
[36:10] when it's time to start dividing these
[36:12] things he will not
[36:14] deviate from what moses said and it
[36:16] would not take away what god promised
[36:18] them in genesis
[36:20] it's going to all work together that
[36:22] goes to show you no man can do that
[36:25] only god the holy spirit can keep
[36:28] everything
[36:28] running in the proper channel that he's
[36:31] supposed to run in
[36:33] can we say praise the lord amen now i
[36:36] want to go to uh
[36:39] real quickly turn to deuteronomy chapter
[36:52] 19.
[36:55] so we must and we must understand
[36:59] the land was divided by a lot but we
[37:02] also
[37:02] understand a lot is defined by landmarks
[37:07] and landmarks are defined by measures
[37:11] and when they all these are combined
[37:13] together it marks a position
[37:17] praise the lord now i'm just reading
[37:20] from my definition i want to make
[37:22] because as you turn it there a lot is a
[37:24] measure
[37:27] a land was given to israel as a body
[37:30] as a nation it take 12 tribes to make
[37:33] the nation of israel
[37:35] when they went to possess the land it
[37:36] was broken down to a tribe
[37:39] family individual the same as we are the
[37:42] bribe
[37:43] there are many different churches that
[37:45] make the bride
[37:46] every church has a spirit every home has
[37:49] a spirit
[37:50] and every individual has a spirit but
[37:53] if we're all leaning on the holy spirit
[37:56] letting the holy spirit lead and guide
[37:58] us it'll all work together
[38:01] can we say amen now knowing your
[38:04] position
[38:05] is power and authority amen
[38:09] how was abraham able to take out five
[38:12] kingdoms to rescue lot
[38:14] amen because he knew his position
[38:17] is that right moses wiped out a whole
[38:19] nation
[38:20] because he knew his position but it took
[38:23] god
[38:23] to reveal to moses his position
[38:26] his drama talked about it amen the
[38:29] prophet god said his mama taught him
[38:31] but it took the anointing to strike
[38:32] moses so god can put him in action
[38:35] because moses
[38:36] was going by intellectual faith
[38:39] but when he went back to israel i mean
[38:41] to egypt he went back by
[38:42] revelation knowing is calling
[38:46] that he's supposed to deliver the people
[38:47] of god you know there's a lot of times
[38:50] you can know what to do but there's no
[38:52] anointing there to do it you best stay
[38:55] still
[38:57] can you say ma'am and people always want
[38:59] to give you advice
[39:00] what to do but i'm here to tell you one
[39:03] thing i learned about advice
[39:05] when it's anointed of god there'll be an
[39:07] agreement in your spirit
[39:09] because it'll be god speaking to that
[39:11] person talking to you
[39:13] how many of you know the story you
[39:14] remember the story jethro
[39:16] jethro he he he knew uh politics
[39:20] jethro knew uh maintenance jethro knew
[39:23] order jethro knew how to position on job
[39:25] jethro knew all of that because he was a
[39:27] king
[39:29] but then he come to moses and tell moses
[39:32] what you're doing is not good
[39:35] you're going to wear yourself out moses
[39:37] what you're doing is not good
[39:39] don't that sound real nice that sounds
[39:42] so good or the advice
[39:44] just throws giving moses he said put
[39:46] some over 100 some over 50.
[39:48] he said then you deal with the heavy
[39:50] matters
[39:51] that was good advice but you know it
[39:54] didn't work
[39:57] because if it were to work moses
[40:00] wouldn't have went back to god later on
[40:03] and saying it is hard i can't bear these
[40:06] people by myself
[40:08] moses had the same situation after
[40:11] jethro instructed him
[40:12] he had the same situation of pressure
[40:15] but this time
[40:16] moses went to god and god
[40:20] took the spirit off of moses and
[40:22] anointed the 70.
[40:24] jethro gave good advice but it was never
[40:27] an anointing put to it
[40:29] so when god called moses an anointing
[40:32] was put to it
[40:33] and then the prophet god said and moses
[40:35] didn't even get no weaker
[40:37] because now god is in it so people can
[40:40] give you
[40:41] advice but until an anointing strikes
[40:43] that's just good advice
[40:45] it take god to move us into the position
[40:49] that he needs us and one thing about it
[40:52] moses had to come
[40:53] himself his father father-in-law told
[40:56] him it wasn't good
[40:57] but moses got to a place i need help
[41:00] i can't do this by myself can we say man
[41:03] so god had to get you in places
[41:05] sometimes did you realize
[41:07] i need help people can give you advice
[41:10] all day long you still go in the same
[41:12] circle
[41:13] but when you get to a place i need help
[41:16] now god said all right now we let's
[41:18] anoint some things
[41:21] exactly right amen in deuteronomy
[41:25] chapter 19
[41:26] uh verse 14 thou shalt not remove thy
[41:31] neighbor's
[41:32] landmark which they of all
[41:36] which they of all time has set in thy
[41:38] inheritance
[41:39] which thy inheritance in the land that
[41:41] the lord like god
[41:42] gives thee to possess it now i want you
[41:44] to notice
[41:45] when moses is talking about this they're
[41:48] not even in the land
[41:52] so he's talking about don't you move
[41:54] your neighbor's landmark that goes to
[41:56] show you
[41:57] later on down the road when they do get
[41:59] that land they're gonna be some problem
[42:01] with people
[42:02] moving landmarks she's all in prophecy
[42:07] right now
[42:07] that probably is going to be some
[42:09] problems and we find the same thing
[42:11] today
[42:12] that's what happening people want to
[42:14] take somebody else's landmark or move
[42:16] somebody else's landmark
[42:18] according what god said that is a curse
[42:20] to do that
[42:24] praise the lord amen let me just
[42:28] now you when you got your own house
[42:32] how many of you know where your
[42:34] landmarks are
[42:38] and if the neighbors start doing
[42:40] something
[42:42] you look out the window that's a little
[42:45] too close
[42:47] how do you know it's a little too close
[42:49] because you know your land market
[42:51] you can walk right outside so neighbor
[42:53] can we talk
[42:54] uh that's my landmark right there see i
[42:57] don't know how it is here in south
[42:59] carolina
[43:00] if you put a fence at your house you
[43:03] can't put it on your landmark
[43:05] you got to put it three feet away from
[43:08] the landmark
[43:10] can you say man you have to know your
[43:12] boundaries and if you don't know your
[43:14] boundaries
[43:15] people can just jump on your land and do
[43:16] whatever they want to do
[43:18] so you'll have to know where your
[43:20] landmark
[43:21] is if you look the word up landmark
[43:24] it also means the same word as a lot
[43:27] and it also means a lot to it
[43:30] can we say amen so god got landmark he
[43:33] said
[43:34] don't move your landmark with your
[43:36] father's notice what it says
[43:38] what your fathers have given amen other
[43:41] words what the father's going to
[43:42] establish
[43:43] he put the lamb out there don't let
[43:44] nobody take that from you
[43:46] you see the message of the hour is a
[43:48] landmark
[43:50] can we say man because we are under the
[43:52] teaching
[43:53] the hearts of the children is turned
[43:55] back to the teaching of the father
[43:57] that is a landmark the message is the
[43:59] landmark
[44:00] for somebody to say the message is wrong
[44:02] it's a curse to them because they're
[44:04] trying to move a landmark
[44:06] that god had established
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:11] all right i ain't preaching landmark yet
[44:14] but we're gonna get down let's turn to
[44:15] numbers 33.
[44:26] numbers 33 verse 50.
[44:30] and the lord speaking to moses in the
[44:32] plain of moab by jordan new jericho
[44:34] saying
[44:36] speak unto the children of israel say
[44:38] unto them
[44:39] when you are passed over jordan into the
[44:41] land of catan
[44:42] you know i like how positive god is
[44:44] saying it ain't that you might not make
[44:47] it
[44:48] no he said when you get there other word
[44:50] it's definitely going to happen
[44:52] can we say man when god says something i
[44:55] don't care how long it takes but it's
[44:56] definitely it's going to happen
[45:01] verse 52 then you shall drive out the
[45:03] inhabitants of the land
[45:05] from before you and destroy all their
[45:07] pictures
[45:08] destroy all their motion images quite
[45:10] pluck down all their high places
[45:12] now listen now he said you got land
[45:16] you got an inheritance but you got
[45:18] things setting on it
[45:19] so that goes to show you even with our
[45:21] position
[45:22] god has to give it but there are
[45:24] sometimes
[45:25] things that are trying to get in the way
[45:27] they have to be removed
[45:29] because if they did not remove all these
[45:31] things god telling them to move
[45:33] he wants them to get out of the way so
[45:34] it won't be no influences
[45:37] if they leave up certain pictures it's
[45:39] influence it can influence
[45:40] the children of israel or a certain
[45:42] thing that's why you know sometimes
[45:44] people might get mad
[45:45] i'll be honest with you that's not a
[45:46] good thing you got children got all
[45:48] these
[45:49] sports heroes still hanging up in the
[45:50] house
[45:54] actually what they become is idols they
[45:57] will idolize that person that's why they
[45:59] got them hanging up there
[46:02] can we say amen now some song because
[46:04] there's so much going on now
[46:05] this i could have been asked a question
[46:07] lately but why you got a picture of the
[46:08] heart from the head of christ
[46:10] why do you have a picture of william
[46:11] branham there and blah blah blah
[46:13] i said friends i don't worship him
[46:16] i said if i had that picture the hoffman
[46:17] had to cry and a picture of brother
[46:19] branham if i'm doing like this
[46:21] now i'm worshiping that person to an
[46:23] idol
[46:24] i said this picture is something that i
[46:26] appreciate
[46:28] can we say praise the lord so many don't
[46:30] have the bell i had somebody kind of
[46:32] i got into it with them about this so
[46:35] amen
[46:35] i asked him a question i said so god
[46:37] don't want us to have no idea no
[46:39] god no no no no i said well answer this
[46:41] for me why did god tell them make a
[46:43] brazen serpent god told him to make a
[46:45] brazen serpent
[46:46] not only make it but look up to it
[46:50] i just really tell you an action is not
[46:52] to have these things i said friend
[46:54] you got to understand motive and
[46:56] objective and reasons
[46:59] can we say praise the lord because there
[47:00] are some teachings especially that come
[47:02] from catholicism people that don't come
[47:04] out of catholic churches
[47:06] they won't even have a picture of their
[47:07] family in their house
[47:10] not one well
[47:13] i just kind of be a little smart with
[47:15] him i said you don't want a picture on
[47:16] you hanging on the wall in your house
[47:18] no no no no that's why you got facebook
[47:23] did you put pictures up on facebook
[47:25] because there's a wall that you're
[47:26] posting on
[47:31] heaven's lord let me get back to this
[47:38] verse 53 you shall dispossess the
[47:41] happiness of the land
[47:43] and dwell therein for i have given you
[47:45] the land to possess it
[47:47] and you shall divide the land by lot
[47:51] for an inheritance now i'm just reading
[47:54] all these scriptures
[47:56] they have substance to them but i'm
[47:57] going to jump for a moment here
[47:59] because i'm reading a lot and i'm i'm
[48:02] finna skip a lot because we can't
[48:04] there's no way i've just studied this a
[48:07] long time
[48:08] and it was real good to me but now let's
[48:10] get a little more
[48:11] slower now come with me to joshua 14.
[48:27] i want to go to joshua 14 and i want to
[48:29] go to verse 1.
[48:34] no excuse me go to numbers 34 first then
[48:37] we'll go to joshua 14.
[48:40] number 34 verse 16.
[48:44] i want you to listen and then lord
[48:47] speaking to
[48:48] moses saying
[48:51] these are the names of the men
[48:56] i want you to make sure you read what
[48:57] i'm reading verse 17
[48:59] these are the names of the men which
[49:02] shall divide
[49:03] the land unto you
[49:07] eliezer the priest and joshua
[49:10] the son of none
[49:13] now we know the land going to be divided
[49:15] but now we
[49:17] we we we we it's more than just joshua
[49:21] doing it but notice it put joshua
[49:25] and a priest are you with me
[49:28] why is the priest there because of the
[49:31] urine and family
[49:33] because when a lot is actually when
[49:35] joshua under inspiration
[49:38] gives a person the lot and the priest
[49:41] being there
[49:42] it's going to light up on the human
[49:43] thumb and that this is your place
[49:46] it's gonna light up in the word this
[49:48] belongs to you
[49:49] so in other words if somebody wants to
[49:51] come up
[49:52] and say i believe this is supposed to be
[49:55] the me
[49:56] this is my life and i want it now you
[49:58] got to preach there
[50:00] and the word is not lightened up they
[50:03] say brother you can want it all you want
[50:04] and you got good reasons for having it
[50:06] but
[50:06] the word ain't lining up what you're
[50:08] saying so you it can't be yours
[50:12] so that's why the same thing today when
[50:15] people want a position
[50:16] they want a lot they want this but if
[50:18] the word is not
[50:20] backing up what they're saying they're
[50:21] in the wrong spot
[50:26] the word have to be there are you with
[50:28] me let me just read now let's go to
[50:30] joshua
[50:31] 14.
[50:35] verse one these are the countries with
[50:38] the children of israel inherited
[50:41] in the land of canaan which eleazar the
[50:43] priest
[50:44] joshua the son of none and the heads of
[50:47] the fathers
[50:48] let me read that again verse one and
[50:50] these are the countries with the
[50:52] children of israel
[50:53] inherited in the land of canaan
[50:57] which elies are the priests and joshua
[51:00] the son of nun
[51:02] and the heads of the father of the
[51:04] tribes of the children in
[51:05] israel it for an inheritance to them see
[51:10] now
[51:10] notice it bringing the heads of the
[51:13] fathers in there too
[51:15] i'm reading that to go about to tell you
[51:17] what i said amen
[51:18] it comes from 12 tribes to the head of
[51:22] the tribe
[51:23] to the father of the tribe to the family
[51:26] down to the individual
[51:27] so otherwise in all of this positioning
[51:30] it involves
[51:31] every one of us in every aspect of life
[51:36] but it's going to take the holy spirit
[51:39] yeah we go through years of wiggling and
[51:41] moving ups and downs
[51:43] not mistakes and fall but it had to come
[51:45] to a time
[51:46] amen we get into position with the holy
[51:49] spirit and say
[51:50] i know my place
[51:52] [Music]
[51:54] we're not in the age 9 time being
[51:56] children
[51:58] it's time to press on can we say amen
[52:02] all right let's go a little bit further
[52:08] wow
[52:13] i'm trying my best ain't no way in the
[52:15] world i preach all this but
[52:22] i'll tell you what i'll do and i'll just
[52:24] get with individuals here
[52:25] let's deal with something here
[52:29] tell me the first chronicles chapter 5.
[52:46] speaking of positioning and placing
[52:49] placings
[52:50] i know you all studied the message it's
[52:53] just
[52:54] so amazing i'm just thankful how the
[52:57] lord
[52:59] never never we would have taught
[53:01] adoption
[53:03] a placing of a mama being a housewife
[53:07] without god sending a prophet to bring
[53:09] that even out
[53:11] we we won't think of stuff like that
[53:15] and that should be encouraging some
[53:16] mothers
[53:18] that are housewives
[53:22] because if god ordained that for you to
[53:23] be guess what
[53:25] ain't nothing else you gonna do you you
[53:27] try to do anything else you ain't gonna
[53:28] be comfortable
[53:31] you're gonna feel miserable
[53:34] you are cause it's easy even being a
[53:37] housewife you ain't careful
[53:39] the four walls of the house close in on
[53:41] you
[53:42] you be like man i i can't be i i need to
[53:45] get out
[53:46] i need to do something it's and we have
[53:49] sometimes sisters
[53:51] well i just got to be honest every woman
[53:53] is not a housewife
[53:57] it just don't work and i'm telling you
[53:59] this because of experiences i've been
[54:01] through
[54:01] i know incident sister had a problem
[54:05] a real bad problem but to begin to
[54:08] notice
[54:09] every time she got a job things went
[54:11] okay
[54:12] i'm not talking about her to want to do
[54:14] something wrong or something bad
[54:16] but it was something it was a release
[54:18] agent when she didn't have a job it
[54:20] released
[54:20] pressure because when pressure is in the
[54:23] house
[54:24] y'all all know this is true if there's
[54:26] anything you want a woman to break down
[54:28] on you when there's pressures in the
[54:29] house
[54:30] things are not being met finances are
[54:32] not being met that put pressure on the
[54:33] wife
[54:36] it puts pressure there but i'm so
[54:38] thankful we had a prophet in this day to
[54:40] balance it
[54:41] say if the man is a little rough for him
[54:44] if the wife want to go out and get a job
[54:46] to relieve that
[54:47] there's nothing wrong with that she took
[54:50] a profit to balance these things
[54:51] it's not barely will but for a woman to
[54:53] do that to go relieve it that don't mean
[54:56] you already got two brand new cars now
[54:57] she got a job go get a third one
[55:03] especially when the children are little
[55:07] so i come to the conclusion when i talk
[55:09] to people about these things i said
[55:10] brother
[55:11] it's your house you're gonna have to
[55:14] know
[55:15] you and your wife gonna have to know
[55:17] what to do in your
[55:19] house and if anything is out of cater
[55:22] causing problems in the house you need
[55:23] to fix it and just be honest
[55:27] can we say man because i am not the
[55:30] pastor going to tell you how to run your
[55:32] house i can only tell you what the
[55:33] prophet said
[55:34] it gives you some understanding of
[55:36] scripture but when it comes to the end
[55:37] of the day
[55:38] that man is the priest of his house
[55:41] but brother if you don't know your
[55:42] position in your own house blue is going
[55:44] to lead your family
[55:47] sister if you don't know the position of
[55:48] y'all how look what's going to happen in
[55:50] the family it's going to always be
[55:51] arguments confusion
[55:54] until you know your place
[55:57] all right y'all get a little tight on me
[55:59] now but that's okay cause when they get
[56:01] tight i preach harder
[56:04] amen these things are facts if i'm
[56:07] preaching something false that's
[56:08] different but this is my fault
[56:10] this is facts because something to tell
[56:11] you brother and sister what's going on
[56:13] all around this world we can get our
[56:15] focus on covet and all of these diseases
[56:18] and stuff going on
[56:19] but yet forget who we are in the
[56:21] position we're supposed to be in
[56:23] [Applause]
[56:26] that's exactly right
[56:29] but it's so beautiful how the body of
[56:32] christ supposed to work together
[56:34] i mean be honest brother sister i i see
[56:36] so many things special about south
[56:38] of disunification because of little
[56:42] petty things and disagreements and
[56:44] i see it in it and it and it saddens my
[56:47] heart
[56:49] it don't supposed to be that way is it
[56:51] going to take the squeeze to make us get
[56:53] unified
[56:57] you're probably going to talk about that
[56:58] too
[57:00] but let not let it take a squeeze to do
[57:02] it let's do it now
[57:03] [Applause]
[57:04] [Music]
[57:06] amen you have to recognize
[57:09] a person where god put that person what
[57:12] god is doing to that person
[57:13] respect it i'm gonna go right now
[57:17] through the scripture
[57:18] this is respected can we say amen i mean
[57:21] even my own self i might be critical
[57:24] about something down through the years
[57:26] but now i don't culture i don't come to
[57:28] your terms now
[57:29] by the grace of god make no difference
[57:32] who it is
[57:32] i want to see how like the prophet of
[57:35] god preached a massive discern in the
[57:36] spirit
[57:37] i want to see what is in that person's
[57:39] heart so i know how to understand them
[57:45] is that right the bible even tells us
[57:49] don't compare yourself among yourself
[57:52] sometimes we do that brother i see so
[57:55] much and it just hurts
[57:56] but i want to be a voice to let the
[57:59] bride of jesus christ
[58:00] know we're supposed to be in unity by
[58:03] the word and it's going to take the holy
[58:05] spirit in our lives
[58:06] we drop down our own personal feeling
[58:08] and let god have his way
[58:12] watch how beautiful this is
[58:16] a blocks of children of israel
[58:19] when you study them each one of them had
[58:22] different qualities
[58:23] each tribe had different qualities in
[58:26] life
[58:27] god put it that way
[58:30] one tribe i believe is it's a one tribe
[58:33] i find the scripture in the moment
[58:35] they were good at fishing two of them
[58:38] actually they were good by the sea you
[58:41] can't
[58:41] you can't outfish them but they didn't
[58:44] get that fish just for their tribe
[58:47] they got that fish for the whole nation
[58:49] of israel
[58:50] but all of the other 11 tribes had to
[58:52] recognize
[58:53] these are the brethren that brings in
[58:55] the fish
[58:56] [Applause]
[58:58] now if vanessa's going out there and
[59:00] fish he ain't gonna catch nothing
[59:04] cause god didn't annoy him to do it he's
[59:06] gonna catch nothing
[59:08] but that might be the one that can cook
[59:09] real good the one that catches the fish
[59:12] might can't cook so he can catch the
[59:16] fish give it to the one that can cook
[59:18] and everybody eat
[59:19] [Applause]
[59:22] but they have to recognize what their
[59:23] place is
[59:26] because it got to be one purpose we come
[59:30] together we fight together we fight for
[59:32] the right principles and the right
[59:34] purpose
[59:34] for one purpose is to glorify god
[59:38] give god the glory that's what the
[59:42] purpose is
[59:44] for
[59:46] first chronicles 5.
[59:52] and from there we're going to go to
[59:54] first chronicles 12.
[1:00:01] let's go to verse 5 18.
[1:00:05] the sons of reuben and the gadites
[1:00:09] have to travel with manasseh a valid man
[1:00:13] men able to bear buckler and sword
[1:00:17] and to shoot with both skillful in war
[1:00:21] with 40 and 40 703 score
[1:00:25] that went to war now i like how the lord
[1:00:28] allowed this to be written in scripture
[1:00:30] it shows you what their expertise is
[1:00:35] able to bear a buckler and a sword and
[1:00:38] shoot with the bow
[1:00:39] that was their specialty
[1:00:43] let's go to chapter 12.
[1:00:47] you know in first chronicles chapter 12
[1:00:52] as we keep reading we're going to see
[1:00:55] something
[1:00:56] it's going to start naming all of the
[1:00:58] different tribes
[1:00:59] and all of their specialties but it's
[1:01:02] going to show you the reason why
[1:01:04] it's so that's what i like about the
[1:01:06] scripture it'll show
[1:01:07] the reason why it is so
[1:01:11] hold on one second let me flip
[1:01:16] let's go to verse one
[1:01:22] these are they first chronicles 12 1.
[1:01:25] these are they that came to david to
[1:01:28] ziklag
[1:01:30] where he yet kept himself closed because
[1:01:32] of saul
[1:01:33] the son of kish and they were among
[1:01:36] the mighty man helpers of
[1:01:40] war verse two they were armed with balls
[1:01:44] they could use both the right hand and
[1:01:47] the left
[1:01:48] in hurling stones shooting owls out of a
[1:01:51] boat
[1:01:52] even some even of saul's brethren
[1:01:56] of benjamin now notice it's just talking
[1:01:58] about
[1:01:59] they come to david but we're going to
[1:02:01] find out in a moment
[1:02:03] why they come to david but it's pointing
[1:02:05] out what they could do
[1:02:07] first in other words their gift
[1:02:10] their lot their position
[1:02:14] of what they can do to contribute to who
[1:02:18] david cause we're gonna find out in this
[1:02:20] chapter
[1:02:21] it's the purpose is getting david on the
[1:02:24] throne
[1:02:25] david making david king is the purpose
[1:02:28] for all of this
[1:02:30] all right now let's skip down
[1:02:34] i'll tell you right now verse two again
[1:02:36] they were armed with bows it could use
[1:02:37] both the right hand
[1:02:39] and the left other word that's some
[1:02:40] dangerous man
[1:02:44] it made no different what hand they had
[1:02:45] that weapon in they're gonna equally use
[1:02:47] it on you
[1:02:48] can we say amen that's why we need to be
[1:02:50] them type of soldiers to be able to use
[1:02:52] the old testament and the new testament
[1:02:56] can we say man we got to be able to use
[1:02:58] both and bring everything
[1:03:00] that we get a punch to the devil
[1:03:05] amen i tell you what if you if you
[1:03:07] search history
[1:03:08] or archers they're not bowman's
[1:03:11] like you actually think if you search
[1:03:14] the history on the bowmans and archers
[1:03:16] they back in them times they were able
[1:03:19] if somebody shoot an arrow at them
[1:03:21] they was able to even snatch it and get
[1:03:24] the enemy out
[1:03:25] put it in their boy and shoot it back at
[1:03:26] them
[1:03:28] that's how good they were with archers
[1:03:31] do you research i did it
[1:03:32] you can look it up exactly right it was
[1:03:36] a man doing a documentary
[1:03:38] proving how it was so and he proved it
[1:03:40] was so he did it himself
[1:03:42] had people to shoot arrow he was just
[1:03:43] jump up and snatch them
[1:03:47] and they wouldn't like you and me would
[1:03:48] put one bow in your put one hour in your
[1:03:50] bow
[1:03:51] they'll have a couple of them and they
[1:03:53] didn't know how to use them
[1:03:56] that's skill
[1:04:02] i tell you to get a guy like that he's a
[1:04:04] hunter out in the woods
[1:04:05] animal got it bad he'll knock the whole
[1:04:08] family off
[1:04:13] you know hundreds a day you hoping to
[1:04:14] get one
[1:04:21] got him
[1:04:27] i would not want to fight a person like
[1:04:28] that
[1:04:30] but look at the position they have who
[1:04:32] made them like that
[1:04:34] god for what purpose to
[1:04:37] put david on the throne
[1:04:40] that's what the gift is for that's what
[1:04:42] the position is for
[1:04:44] let's go on down let's just talk about
[1:04:47] let's go to verse 29
[1:04:52] and the children of benjamin the kindred
[1:04:54] of saul
[1:04:55] three thousand for here the two together
[1:04:58] greatest part of them that had kept the
[1:05:00] ward of the house
[1:05:02] of saul now their gift is keeping the
[1:05:05] ward
[1:05:07] otherwise staying at home
[1:05:11] they was happy you got some people never
[1:05:14] leave church
[1:05:16] but they're always in church just
[1:05:19] staying in church
[1:05:20] always at the door greet somebody
[1:05:22] there's nothing wrong with that so you
[1:05:23] can't be like i wish i could go out like
[1:05:25] some other brother did it god had called
[1:05:27] you to do it it ain't gonna happen
[1:05:29] but the people that are like that god
[1:05:32] anoints them
[1:05:33] they actually don't even have a problem
[1:05:35] going nowhere they just fit
[1:05:36] right in they be helpers
[1:05:41] they don't force themselves in it it
[1:05:42] just happens
[1:05:48] verse 30. and under children of eve from
[1:05:51] 20 000
[1:05:52] 800 mighty men of valor famous
[1:05:55] throughout the house of their fathers
[1:05:58] and of the hash tribe of manasseh 18 000
[1:06:02] which expressed my name to come
[1:06:07] and make david king
[1:06:11] uh oh we're gonna keep reading more
[1:06:13] gifts but out of all of the gifts out of
[1:06:16] all of the position
[1:06:17] out of all of the expertise expertise
[1:06:20] that they have
[1:06:21] it's for one purpose to make
[1:06:24] david king that's why god got his bride
[1:06:28] he wants her to be in the position
[1:06:30] that he wants us to be so he can be
[1:06:32] glorified
[1:06:33] that the world will know jesus christ
[1:06:36] it's the same yesterday and forever
[1:06:38] he's a god of order he's a god of
[1:06:40] promises he takes care of
[1:06:42] everything and people need to be in
[1:06:45] order
[1:06:48] what impressed the queen of shiva
[1:06:51] out of all of solomon's gifts what
[1:06:54] impressed her
[1:06:55] is the order she's seen of his service
[1:06:58] and so forth
[1:06:59] order is impressive but it takes the
[1:07:02] holy spirit
[1:07:03] to keep us in order and put us in order
[1:07:10] notice verse
[1:07:13] and under children of issachar which men
[1:07:17] that had understanding of the times
[1:07:20] to know what israel ought to do the
[1:07:22] heads of them were 200
[1:07:24] and all their brethren were at their
[1:07:27] commandment now that's interesting
[1:07:31] it's pineal it's a car they know the
[1:07:33] times
[1:07:35] amen understanding times and it says
[1:07:39] i all their brethren were at their
[1:07:41] commandment
[1:07:46] so you might know how to make weapons
[1:07:49] you might know how to use weapons
[1:07:52] but if you don't know the time in the
[1:07:54] season to do it you might be shooting
[1:07:56] the wrong person
[1:07:59] so it's a call over the tribe of the war
[1:08:04] they can let them know when to go in
[1:08:06] battle when not to go in battle
[1:08:09] freeze that is beautiful amen
[1:08:12] other words some of them got my buckler
[1:08:15] man i got my spear
[1:08:16] dude ready just go out there and fight
[1:08:20] it's a call be like
[1:08:24] it ain't time brother oh
[1:08:27] put it back up put it back up i'll let
[1:08:29] you know
[1:08:32] see that's the holy spirit tells you
[1:08:34] when to open your mouth when you shut
[1:08:35] your mouth
[1:08:38] but we want to do what we want to do say
[1:08:40] what we want to say
[1:08:41] make no difference who it hurt who it
[1:08:43] offends
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:51] verse 33 zebelin
[1:08:55] such as with forced to battle expert
[1:08:58] experts in war instruments of war
[1:09:02] 50 000 which could keep rank they were
[1:09:05] not double hearted
[1:09:06] there goes another key
[1:09:09] they could keep rank and they was not
[1:09:12] double
[1:09:13] hearted that's what we have to keep
[1:09:15] ranked know our place
[1:09:17] know our position and not be
[1:09:19] double-minded
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:24] these things are very very important
[1:09:28] but we want to hear the seals i'm
[1:09:30] preaching them to you
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:39] all right
[1:09:43] keeping that rank they were not
[1:09:46] of a double heart expert in war
[1:09:50] in other words we're going to fight for
[1:09:52] one purpose
[1:09:53] and one purpose only we ain't going to
[1:09:56] change teens
[1:09:58] can we say amen that's the way it's
[1:10:00] supposed to be for you me
[1:10:01] i think it's in the hebrew series the
[1:10:02] prophet of god said we don't mind
[1:10:04] fighting
[1:10:06] for the right principle
[1:10:09] so you got to have the right principle
[1:10:11] for when we have a fight
[1:10:13] and that principle is not i'm gonna get
[1:10:15] my steam off
[1:10:18] because they offended me and now i'm
[1:10:19] gonna let it off that ain't the right
[1:10:20] principle
[1:10:22] the principle should be for brain unity
[1:10:24] expose that which is wrong
[1:10:25] and then bring back unity bring can we
[1:10:28] say man
[1:10:29] this goes from every level friends down
[1:10:32] through the house it goes all the way
[1:10:36] verse 35 well it's been an hour now
[1:10:43] i tell you what
[1:10:46] and the children of ephraim 20 800
[1:10:49] mighty man of valor
[1:10:50] famous throughout the house of their
[1:10:52] fathers
[1:10:54] i'm sorry let's go to verse 33
[1:10:57] and i'm sorry verse 34. nathalie
[1:11:01] thousand captains with them with shields
[1:11:03] and spear
[1:11:04] 37 000 and the dynaits expert in war
[1:11:08] 20 and 8 000 and asher such
[1:11:11] us went forth to battle expert in war
[1:11:14] uh forty thousand and on the other side
[1:11:17] of jordan the rubinites
[1:11:18] gaddites and of the half trial of
[1:11:20] manasseh with all
[1:11:21] manner with all manner of instruments of
[1:11:25] war for battle
[1:11:27] 120 000. if you notice
[1:11:31] it's talking about this tribe they got
[1:11:34] all
[1:11:34] manner of instruments of war
[1:11:38] but then you got certain tribes got a
[1:11:41] certain
[1:11:41] expertise in a weapon
[1:11:45] but they all work together
[1:11:50] that's why every church got a different
[1:11:52] ministry
[1:11:54] you might got a church they stay
[1:11:57] anointed and preach
[1:11:58] faith all the time
[1:12:01] and that's their life amen
[1:12:05] you got a minister he can just preach
[1:12:07] faith it's a gift that god gave him
[1:12:10] that's his life then you might got a
[1:12:13] minister got all the instruments he can
[1:12:15] preach revelation he preached
[1:12:17] faith hey man he can just go up and down
[1:12:20] he got them all
[1:12:21] god made that man that way you can't
[1:12:23] change today
[1:12:26] but brandon was that man also he had all
[1:12:29] the instruments
[1:12:32] but you have to respect the ministry
[1:12:35] where it is
[1:12:36] at i hate it when i hear ministers call
[1:12:40] another minister
[1:12:41] shallow how in the world can somebody be
[1:12:44] shallow
[1:12:44] if that is a true gift from god and they
[1:12:47] are full of the holy ghost
[1:12:49] let them grow brother we all have to
[1:12:52] grow
[1:12:53] but in this time
[1:12:57] shouldn't be that way
[1:13:07] verse 38 all these men of war
[1:13:12] that could keep rain came with a perfect
[1:13:16] heart
[1:13:17] to hebron to make david king
[1:13:20] over all israel and the rest also
[1:13:23] israel were of one heart to make david
[1:13:27] king that's what's the purpose
[1:13:31] for god in our case for god to be
[1:13:34] glorified
[1:13:37] and what's so beautiful about first
[1:13:39] chronicles
[1:13:41] chapter 12. that's natural
[1:13:46] but it's the parallel first chronicles
[1:13:50] 12.
[1:13:51] let's deal with spiritual.
[1:13:56] god placed it so beautiful in the bible
[1:13:58] because in first chronicle
[1:14:00] notice let's turn to first chronicles
[1:14:01] 12. but notice
[1:14:03] all of these i keep saying this it's to
[1:14:06] make david king
[1:14:10] that's the purpose now let's go to first
[1:14:12] chronicles 12.
[1:14:15] well we was reading these brother
[1:14:17] positions and places that god gave them
[1:14:19] and they didn't have to push in if
[1:14:23] another scripture
[1:14:24] we won't get to at night i could show
[1:14:26] you where they made
[1:14:27] weapons they would have tried that's
[1:14:30] what they did
[1:14:31] made weapons but they couldn't use them
[1:14:35] but they knew how to make them
[1:14:39] they just make them because they know
[1:14:40] they're gonna somebody gonna be able to
[1:14:42] use them
[1:14:43] now what is the one that make them get
[1:14:45] out of here play i want to use it
[1:14:48] he gonna get out there in that battle
[1:14:49] and ain't gonna come back
[1:14:51] that's why he need to respect the other
[1:14:53] one amen
[1:14:55] i'm making this take it brother can we
[1:14:58] say man
[1:14:59] that's why everybody's not missionary
[1:15:01] but you might have
[1:15:02] funds to send someone in the field you
[1:15:05] are a part of that
[1:15:09] praise the lord
[1:15:15] everybody in ministry
[1:15:21] would not have the same faith to even go
[1:15:24] deal with witch doctors
[1:15:29] because you get out there playing with
[1:15:30] that you can get yourself in trouble
[1:15:33] you better know but there are some
[1:15:35] brothers
[1:15:36] it don't phase them at all of the faith
[1:15:40] that they have
[1:15:43] i'll respect that i'm not gonna get out
[1:15:46] there gonna chase
[1:15:47] and face a witch daughter and god and
[1:15:49] inspire me to do it i know what my faith
[1:15:51] level is i know
[1:15:52] i'm not going to do that oh i'll make a
[1:15:54] show but i'm letting them
[1:15:55] catch the spirit out that's right
[1:15:59] spirit gonna get on berlin
[1:16:02] that's right you don't play with stuff
[1:16:04] like that and then you got mothers
[1:16:08] same faith but the children can be sick
[1:16:10] she can get under and
[1:16:12] lay her hands on her and take care of
[1:16:13] the situation in her faith
[1:16:16] it's still faith but each one of us has
[1:16:19] a measure
[1:16:22] you have to respect the measure of the
[1:16:23] other because you can only go you can't
[1:16:25] go no father what god give it
[1:16:28] so don't never feel like well he prayed
[1:16:32] that person
[1:16:33] they start walking i can't do that don't
[1:16:37] you worry about that
[1:16:39] if god didn't inspire you to do it don't
[1:16:41] leave it alone just be thankful
[1:16:43] give god the glory the man can walk
[1:16:46] don't give it to the person oh he'll
[1:16:48] hear me today will the problem come
[1:16:50] you glorify the man not looking at the
[1:16:53] gift god put there
[1:16:57] now brother branham said
[1:17:01] earlier about birth pains
[1:17:05] labor pains to get into positions and he
[1:17:09] started talking about gifts
[1:17:10] so we go back to gifts also
[1:17:14] we what we read in the old testament
[1:17:16] natural gifts with the stars and weapons
[1:17:19] but all of these things in first
[1:17:20] corinthians 12 are also weapons
[1:17:23] that are used amen to defeat the enemy
[1:17:26] and glorify the kingdom of god
[1:17:29] it says now verse 4 first corinthians 12
[1:17:32] 4
[1:17:33] now there are diversities of gifts but
[1:17:36] notice what it says
[1:17:37] but same spirit
[1:17:40] just like all them brother and different
[1:17:42] diversities of gifts
[1:17:44] but there was under the same anointing
[1:17:46] to make david king
[1:17:51] there are difference of administrations
[1:17:53] but the same
[1:17:55] lord there are diversities of operation
[1:18:00] but it's the same god which workers all
[1:18:03] in all
[1:18:06] positioning everything letting us know
[1:18:09] it's the one spirit that does it
[1:18:12] because when you try to do it yourself
[1:18:14] you're going to get out of order you're
[1:18:15] going to cause problems
[1:18:17] listen what he says verse 7 but the
[1:18:20] manifestation
[1:18:21] of the spirit is given to
[1:18:24] every man to prophet with all
[1:18:30] for to what is given by the spirit the
[1:18:32] word of wisdom
[1:18:34] to another the word of knowledge but the
[1:18:37] same
[1:18:38] spirit
[1:18:41] god said i'm the one doing the dividing
[1:18:44] you got some medicine can take an ariel
[1:18:46] in this message and they can preach it
[1:18:50] and you'll feel like you never studied
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:53] and you'll sit there even as a preacher
[1:18:56] man
[1:18:56] i couldn't preach that
[1:18:59] god didn't tell you
[1:19:03] you had to respect one another where
[1:19:05] they're at
[1:19:11] the prophet of god said the man got the
[1:19:13] ball
[1:19:15] protect him folks take it from him
[1:19:18] protect him
[1:19:22] see in my immature days
[1:19:25] especially when i was an evangelist
[1:19:28] growing
[1:19:30] when i hear a teacher i hear a teacher
[1:19:32] teach
[1:19:34] in my mind
[1:19:37] she hit that a little harder
[1:19:46] then a teacher can sit there and listen
[1:19:48] to an evangelist
[1:19:50] he need to break that down
[1:19:54] a little bit more make it plainer for
[1:19:55] the people
[1:20:00] then another this is too soft no you
[1:20:03] don't have the ball
[1:20:05] protect the one that got it stand behind
[1:20:08] him
[1:20:09] because that could push the holy spirit
[1:20:14] but today
[1:20:18] because in any way i think it should be
[1:20:20] it shouldn't be
[1:20:22] that's pride it's wrong
[1:20:26] respect every brother for what they are
[1:20:28] now i'm not talking about nonsense now i
[1:20:29] hope you know me better than that
[1:20:31] i'm not talking about nonsense
[1:20:34] it need to be dealt with something just
[1:20:36] straight up nonsense need to be dealt
[1:20:37] with by the word of god
[1:20:43] verse 8 for the one is given by the
[1:20:46] spirit the word of wisdom
[1:20:48] to another word of knowledge by the same
[1:20:51] spirit
[1:20:52] to another faith by the same spirit to
[1:20:55] another gifts of healing
[1:20:56] by the same spirit to another working a
[1:21:00] miracle
[1:21:01] to another prophecy to another
[1:21:03] discerning of spirits
[1:21:05] to another diver kinds of tongue to
[1:21:08] another
[1:21:09] the interpretation of tongue for all
[1:21:11] these
[1:21:12] worketh that one in itself same spirit
[1:21:16] divided lot to every man
[1:21:19] severally as the man wanted
[1:21:23] no as he will
[1:21:28] so work on the holy spirit
[1:21:32] today is just the work of feelings
[1:21:34] emotions
[1:21:35] oh i feel like i think we ain't gonna
[1:21:39] get nowhere like that
[1:21:42] even in in the family in the family home
[1:21:44] you just you just it's like i'm happy
[1:21:48] this ain't gonna happen i think i better
[1:21:50] quit
[1:21:52] but it's been an hour and it's
[1:21:55] pretty long that i've been gone pretty
[1:21:57] long
[1:21:58] my wife and my sign posing
[1:22:03] if i asked somebody how long have i been
[1:22:04] preaching now look at her
[1:22:08] she can tell me she won't do it in the
[1:22:10] service but when we get home now
[1:22:12] berlin
[1:22:14] she shocked me the other day sunday
[1:22:16] morning i preached to paul
[1:22:19] i'm done she said never quit
[1:22:22] it's what yeah that was quick
[1:22:28] she said and i know you had some more
[1:22:30] gas in that tank
[1:22:33] i didn't get offended not at all you
[1:22:36] know
[1:22:36] when a preacher you have to be a
[1:22:38] preacher to understand dude when your
[1:22:40] wife compliments you
[1:22:46] that's just the way that it goes but i
[1:22:49] better quit brothers because it's too
[1:22:51] much
[1:22:52] it really is but i tell you
[1:22:55] this is such a thought because you deal
[1:22:58] with
[1:22:59] church ages families it goes all the way
[1:23:02] down you can take
[1:23:03] a service on each section
[1:23:08] and they're going to be all lined up the
[1:23:09] same way
[1:23:11] and it's beautiful you cannot
[1:23:17] when god doesn't designed something to
[1:23:20] be
[1:23:21] especially the landmark because that
[1:23:23] shows where the position is
[1:23:24] at to remove that whoa
[1:23:29] to remove that i will read one more
[1:23:31] scripture
[1:23:32] if i can find it right quick
[1:23:38] go to proverbs 22.
[1:23:49] proverbs 22 28
[1:23:54] to remove not the ancient landmark
[1:23:58] with thy fathers have set
[1:24:01] and what we've been reading in the book
[1:24:03] of joshua
[1:24:05] that's when the landmarks were set but
[1:24:07] back in genesis that's when it was
[1:24:10] god told abraham where it's going to be
[1:24:11] in canaan
[1:24:13] that's why naboth knew exactly where his
[1:24:17] land was
[1:24:19] he knew his land he knew and that's why
[1:24:21] he told them this is
[1:24:22] my inheritance from a father and you
[1:24:25] can't take this from me
[1:24:27] when they did it that's why they got
[1:24:29] cursed
[1:24:30] because they broke the scripture
[1:24:36] flip over to proverbs 23.
[1:24:44] verse 10 remove not the old landmark
[1:24:50] enter not into the fields of the
[1:24:52] fatherless
[1:24:54] what was happening back then when a
[1:24:57] father
[1:24:58] died he could know
[1:25:01] his land marks it but people were so
[1:25:04] wicked in the time of israel
[1:25:06] they might want a little more land for
[1:25:08] themselves
[1:25:10] so they want to slip over there and
[1:25:11] slide landmark
[1:25:14] over a little farther so they can have
[1:25:15] more room for their cattle
[1:25:18] doing it to the followers because the
[1:25:20] father's not there then they would do
[1:25:22] things like that
[1:25:24] they got in trouble for those things
[1:25:27] this is what it says for the redeemer
[1:25:30] is mighty he shall free
[1:25:34] their cause with thee
[1:25:37] amen this message
[1:25:41] is a landmark god has allotted for this
[1:25:44] day
[1:25:46] and the speaker gets it the redeemer i
[1:25:49] ain't got to go fight against nobody
[1:25:51] god's going to plead the cause he's
[1:25:53] going to take care of it
[1:25:55] because he allotted a word
[1:25:59] for each age why do you think the
[1:26:01] prophet god was saying
[1:26:02] jesus couldn't preach no a message moses
[1:26:04] couldn't preach jesus
[1:26:06] moses couldn't preach noah because that
[1:26:08] was there a lot
[1:26:10] and they had to stay in their lot for
[1:26:12] the word that day
[1:26:13] and you can't change it so he allotted
[1:26:17] but we're in the age he didn't just
[1:26:20] allotted the word
[1:26:22] he gave it all
[1:26:25] and people want to move that landmark
[1:26:30] i'm sorry
[1:26:35] there's one more let's see
[1:26:44] i really don't know when i get into the
[1:26:45] seals
[1:26:47] that's exactly where i'm going i just
[1:26:49] know brother i'm going
[1:26:51] it's been an hour and 40.
[1:26:55] 15 minutes i better quit god bless you
[1:26:58] but do you get the thought
[1:27:00] lot measure landmark
[1:27:04] defines the position
[1:27:07] they actually all work together what god
[1:27:10] had to do in this day
[1:27:13] how many of you ever been riding down
[1:27:14] the road and you see land clear it off
[1:27:19] then also you see a bunch of little pink
[1:27:20] buildings
[1:27:22] everywhere what is that
[1:27:25] it's separating lots
[1:27:29] but did you know it so much goes with
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:34] when they're developing that subdivision
[1:27:36] separating them a lot
[1:27:38] they got to record every bit of that
[1:27:42] into the city system they have to record
[1:27:46] it
[1:27:47] but they can't record it
[1:27:50] without a surveyor
[1:27:54] a server a job is very important but he
[1:27:58] has to be
[1:27:58] accurate on his measurements
[1:28:02] or he can be giving somebody else land
[1:28:03] away
[1:28:06] so what would a surveyor do
[1:28:09] not a new adjustment i mean a new
[1:28:11] development but an old development what
[1:28:13] would that surveil do
[1:28:14] what would he do he go to the courts
[1:28:18] and look in the records
[1:28:22] and he'll look at the records
[1:28:25] that he would be able to know go out
[1:28:27] there on that property and walk it
[1:28:29] and find that landmark
[1:28:32] but when he find that landmark he'll be
[1:28:35] able to
[1:28:36] to get a transit follow that thing down
[1:28:40] he can start marking it but he's going
[1:28:42] by old records
[1:28:44] that was already put there
[1:28:47] can we say amen
[1:28:50] see the preaching of the seven seals
[1:28:54] had to go all the way back
[1:28:57] to what was in the mind of god but god
[1:29:00] had to send a surveyor
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:05] to let us know what i'm spot so yeah but
[1:29:08] you know what's so beautiful
[1:29:10] in the new development sometimes
[1:29:13] people move quick
[1:29:17] and they will have their house and a
[1:29:18] bunch of bushes come around and
[1:29:20] like nobody's gonna move out there
[1:29:24] and they would decide ain't nobody
[1:29:25] moving there i could use a little extra
[1:29:27] room
[1:29:29] i'm gonna go ahead and put some stuff
[1:29:30] here put some stuff here make people do
[1:29:32] that
[1:29:33] but then all of a sudden they know that
[1:29:36] the land is being cleared off and they
[1:29:39] walk out what are you doing
[1:29:41] somebody's gonna move here they say um
[1:29:45] well you can't come here they say
[1:29:48] yeah that's where their land is no this
[1:29:50] is my land see they don't make claims
[1:29:54] but the record ain't going to show up
[1:29:55] that is there
[1:29:58] so what to do all he has to do is say
[1:30:01] look i ain't even going to argue with
[1:30:03] you
[1:30:04] i'll be back go back to the records
[1:30:08] get the plaque go out to that person
[1:30:11] see that little stick right there
[1:30:14] listen yeah so according to my transit
[1:30:18] and according to the record you moved it
[1:30:21] over
[1:30:21] four feet yes you did you moved it over
[1:30:26] i got the records could we say man
[1:30:30] see that's what god were doing through
[1:30:32] the prophet then let you know
[1:30:35] you got gifts you got that but the word
[1:30:38] want to move you back here
[1:30:40] you don't went too far that's what
[1:30:42] you're doing with the pentecostals
[1:30:44] can we say man positioning everything in
[1:30:48] the book of joshua jeremiah
[1:30:50] why when he bought that property they
[1:30:53] sealed everything
[1:30:54] up can we say amen put everything sealed
[1:30:57] it up
[1:30:58] so when they came out of babylon
[1:31:01] squatters don't get on their land
[1:31:02] but they got the evidence and they can
[1:31:06] prove
[1:31:07] this belongs to me can we say amen
[1:31:11] that's why god gave us the opening of
[1:31:12] the word
[1:31:14] so you'll know your boundaries you know
[1:31:16] what the devil don't supposed to be
[1:31:18] what the devil trying to be i don't give
[1:31:20] all of that to you
[1:31:26] but just think he just go back to the
[1:31:28] records of the court
[1:31:30] where he's been recorded and say
[1:31:33] you're out of place that's the only
[1:31:34] thing the prophet was doing
[1:31:37] letting him know because you got to
[1:31:38] remember the two full parts of his
[1:31:40] ministry
[1:31:42] he first had to go to the pentecostals
[1:31:45] he had to and they had to reject them
[1:31:49] that's why he said i i gotta go to the
[1:31:52] bride
[1:31:53] it's a bright age if i'm not born again
[1:31:56] i'm a liar to see it
[1:31:58] but i'm born again that brings me and
[1:31:59] ushered me into the bright edge
[1:32:02] some people said i don't really agree
[1:32:04] with that i said simple brother
[1:32:06] it's simple jesus said we're in this
[1:32:09] world
[1:32:10] but not of this world this is a legacy
[1:32:13] in age but we're not of this age
[1:32:16] it's simple
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:22] come on chad god bless you i'm going to
[1:32:24] stop i'll just stop
[1:32:27] but every one of us has a measure and we
[1:32:30] have to respect one another
[1:32:33] what god has done in their lives let's
[1:32:35] get the lord ahead
[1:32:38] god bless you god bless you god bless
[1:32:41] you son
[1:32:42] good to see everybody amen
[1:32:54] let's all stand i was eating good and i
[1:32:57] was enjoying it all amen
[1:33:00] i kept hoping he would keep going and we
[1:33:03] pulled a little extra i think amen
[1:33:05] praise the lord god is good amen
[1:33:08] god is good how many is thankful that
[1:33:11] there was a prophet in this day that
[1:33:12] told us
[1:33:13] this all belongs to you amen the
[1:33:16] squatter's been on it but it all belongs
[1:33:18] to you
[1:33:18] and every promise in the book is mine
[1:33:22] why because there's been a surveyor come
[1:33:24] out and says nope it was promised to you
[1:33:26] your name's on the book now you have an
[1:33:28] abstract title deed it's cleared
[1:33:30] all the way back amen god bless brother
[1:33:34] burley
[1:33:34] i wish we had a weekend of services so
[1:33:36] he could finish
[1:33:38] i wish we had three days in a row
[1:33:39] because i'd like to hear all of that
[1:33:41] i'd like to spend some time shouting
[1:33:43] amen and pulling every piece out
[1:33:45] that god put in there amen just pray for
[1:33:48] brother burley
[1:33:49] and god will continue to bless him and
[1:33:50] use him for him and his wife and his
[1:33:52] family
[1:33:53] and his church back home man it's been
[1:33:55] good to have him here it's been good
[1:33:57] to be reminded that we have a position
[1:34:00] we have a place we weren't just born
[1:34:04] haphazardly because two people decided
[1:34:06] to get married god knew you would be
[1:34:08] here
[1:34:08] he knew what channel you'd come through
[1:34:10] he knew when you would arrive here and
[1:34:12] he knew what your makeup would be and
[1:34:13] what your temperament would be and he
[1:34:14] saw to it
[1:34:15] to get you just the way you are just
[1:34:17] where you are in this end time because
[1:34:19] he already had a position for you and i
[1:34:22] and he's placing us in that bias word
[1:34:25] and i said god let me stay in my
[1:34:27] position and be all that you called me
[1:34:29] to be
[1:34:30] if you call me to fish i'll fish i like
[1:34:33] that one anyway
