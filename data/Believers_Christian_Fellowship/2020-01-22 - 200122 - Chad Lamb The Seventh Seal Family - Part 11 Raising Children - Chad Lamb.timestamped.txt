[3:49] in this time of grief bless the church
[3:52] lord the whole church has gathered there
[3:54] i prayed you blessed them and encouraged
[3:56] them now
[3:57] we give you glory lord and praise you
[3:59] and thank you for the life of our
[4:00] brother john
[4:01] for what he's meant to us for how he's
[4:03] blessed us lord and we pray god that you
[4:05] pour blessings upon his family
[4:08] well we ask that you would bless us as
[4:09] we look into your word that you would
[4:11] anoint us lord for the preaching of the
[4:13] word
[4:13] give us ears to hear all you have for us
[4:16] in this day
[4:17] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[4:21] and while we're standing let's talk to
[4:22] turn to the book of psalms
[4:25] and we'll look at chapter 127 in the
[4:28] book of psalms
[4:29] also i got a message from brother steve
[4:31] hollander today sister marcia had a hip
[4:33] replacement surgery
[4:34] this morning that went very well she was
[4:37] out of surgery quickly
[4:38] the doctor said everything went
[4:39] excellent and she's already been up on
[4:41] her feet and walking with a walker
[4:43] so praise the lord so we're expecting
[4:45] god to give her a quick recovery
[4:47] and to see her hear her here again soon
[4:51] man so keep praying for her as well
[4:55] psalms 127
[4:59] verse 3 lo children are at the heritage
[5:02] of the lord and the fruit of the womb is
[5:04] his reward
[5:05] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[5:07] man sore children
[5:09] of the youth happy is the man that had
[5:11] this quiver full of them
[5:13] they shall not be ashamed but they shall
[5:15] speak with the enemies
[5:16] in the gate amen let's bow our head or
[5:19] we've already prayed never mind go ahead
[5:20] and sit down
[5:21] oh you never prayed too much the prophet
[5:23] said that so we can read a scripture and
[5:25] pray
[5:26] and never pray too much amen i'm such a
[5:29] creature of habit when i get out of
[5:30] order i confuse myself
[5:33] amen if we can bring the powerpoint up
[5:35] we'll
[5:36] we'll continue on here so it says
[5:39] children are in a heritage of the lord
[5:42] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[5:45] so children are never meant to be a
[5:47] burden
[5:50] they're a reward so they
[5:53] they're a heritage of the lord so they
[5:55] come from the lord
[5:57] and they're a reward so sometimes in
[5:59] raising children we've got to start with
[6:01] the right mental approach
[6:03] to raising children because if we see
[6:05] children as a burden or
[6:07] if we see you know multiple children
[6:09] because it says happiness and man has
[6:11] this quiver
[6:12] full and if we begin to see multiple
[6:15] children somehow a burden or a financial
[6:17] strain or
[6:18] or you know something that's going to
[6:20] hold us back in life or
[6:22] limit us in what we can do we've missed
[6:24] the point
[6:26] right and so now it says children are a
[6:30] heritage of the lord
[6:31] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[6:34] as arrows in the hand of the mighty man
[6:36] so are children of the youth
[6:38] happy is the man that had this quiver
[6:40] full of them they shall not be ashamed
[6:42] but they shall speak
[6:43] with the enemies in the gate so having
[6:45] children is a good thing
[6:47] having a quiver full of them is a good
[6:49] thing it's a blessed it's a heritage of
[6:51] the lord and
[6:52] it's god's reward so we want to we want
[6:54] to have the right mental attitude when
[6:56] we come to raising children
[6:57] we want to have a scriptural approach
[6:59] and a scriptural attitude
[7:00] if god has blessed us with children not
[7:03] everybody gets that blessing
[7:06] not everybody has the privilege of being
[7:08] married not everybody has the
[7:10] privilege of having a child amen and if
[7:12] you've been privileged that way
[7:14] you should thank the lord for that and
[7:16] it should be something that we take very
[7:17] seriously that god
[7:18] has allowed in his great plan and his
[7:21] great purpose he's allowed
[7:22] us a meant to raise children for him
[7:25] so we should never take it lightly we're
[7:27] going to go over a couple
[7:28] quotes just to refresh ourselves on this
[7:31] notice the great masterpiece of the
[7:33] family
[7:34] the husband and wife cannot be truly a
[7:37] family unless they are one
[7:39] they have to be if they're not they are
[7:40] not a good family wife pulling one way
[7:43] the husband another
[7:44] that would make an awful family but in
[7:47] agreement with one love
[7:48] with love one to another that's a family
[7:51] and now that was god's masterpiece
[7:53] and now all the true family here
[7:56] portrays that
[7:57] so we want to that's why we're preaching
[7:58] on the seventh seal family
[8:00] amen the true family here is actually
[8:03] portraying god's masterpiece
[8:05] and so we want to have masterpiece
[8:07] reflecting families
[8:08] amen as we live in this life
[8:12] in the message oneness he says any man
[8:15] in his family a correct good
[8:17] noble obedient family is one with
[8:19] another
[8:20] any family and if there's something in
[8:22] the family that moves them apart
[8:24] then it's not right the family's broken
[8:27] somewhere
[8:28] they should all be one father with
[8:30] mother mother with father children with
[8:32] parent
[8:32] parent with children all in agreement
[8:35] and when you see that
[8:36] you'll see one lovely picture
[8:40] amen that's a lovely picture we agree so
[8:43] that's our goal that's our target amen
[8:45] that's what we're aiming for
[8:47] we look here in joshua 24-15 says and if
[8:50] it seemed evil unto you to serve the
[8:52] lord choose you this day whom you will
[8:54] serve
[8:54] whether the gods which your father
[8:56] served that were on the other side of
[8:58] the flood or the gods of the amorites
[9:00] and whose land you dwell but as for me
[9:02] and my house
[9:04] we will serve the lord when we were over
[9:06] we went over the scripture last
[9:08] time but i want to refresh you because
[9:10] when we start off
[9:11] raising children the first thing we need
[9:14] to do is get the right mental approach
[9:16] we need to see it as a
[9:17] blessed heritage of the lord and his
[9:19] reward and we need to be happy if our
[9:21] quiver is full of them
[9:22] but then we also need to start off with
[9:24] a determination and a vision
[9:27] we don't do anything haphazardly in life
[9:29] we're not
[9:30] coming into this life and just hoping
[9:32] things are going to work out
[9:33] but we need to set our focus we need to
[9:36] if we're ever going to hit the target
[9:38] amen you've got to line things up right
[9:40] on the back end if you're ever going to
[9:41] hit the target
[9:42] and you've got to know what the target
[9:44] is what is the goal what are we trying
[9:46] to accomplish
[9:46] i mean we're just hoping to have a
[9:48] couple children so we can say we have
[9:50] children and we can gather them around
[9:52] and wrestle in the floor with them and
[9:54] have children
[9:54] that's wonderful but that's not the goal
[9:57] that's not the target that's not the
[9:59] purpose
[9:59] amen if god gave his children he gave
[10:01] his children to raise
[10:02] for his glory and for his honor to know
[10:05] his name
[10:06] and for his purpose and so
[10:09] so joshua sets the course for his family
[10:12] he says you can serve whomever you will
[10:14] but as for me and my house
[10:16] we will serve the lord and so when
[10:20] when when you know the the baby's born
[10:23] and the doctor hands that baby to you
[10:26] amen you should already have joy in your
[10:28] heart because god has
[10:29] given you a great reward but also you
[10:32] should also have a goal in mind
[10:34] what am i going to new now that god has
[10:36] blessed me with this child
[10:38] am i just going to you know hope things
[10:41] work out and
[10:42] and you know life is kind of like a roll
[10:44] of the dice and sometimes it works
[10:46] out and sometimes it doesn't work out
[10:49] no i don't believe that and i don't
[10:51] believe that's the way we should
[10:52] approach it we should approach it
[10:53] with god's word in mind what does god's
[10:55] word want
[10:56] what is my goal what is what my target
[10:59] what am i aiming
[11:00] for and as for me and my house we will
[11:02] serve the lord
[11:03] that's for me and my wife we will raise
[11:05] this baby to know god's name
[11:07] to fear the lord to serve him
[11:10] amen if we start off right we can hope
[11:14] to end up right
[11:15] but if you start off wrong it's hard
[11:19] it's much harder let's look at this here
[11:22] in
[11:23] a couple quotes here brother ben said
[11:24] what is fatherhood
[11:26] is an attribute of god he said and
[11:29] parenthood originated in god
[11:32] because he was the first parent so what
[11:35] we're doing
[11:36] as as a parent we're actually
[11:39] demonstrating to the world
[11:40] characteristics and natures of god
[11:43] because he's the first parent
[11:45] so every parent should model themselves
[11:47] after the first parent
[11:50] so we like like i've been saying we
[11:52] don't just do things haphazardly but we
[11:54] do them intentionally
[11:55] we do them deliberately and we do them
[11:57] with revelation
[11:59] and so we see god as the first parent
[12:02] he's the model parent
[12:03] so we need to model ourselves after the
[12:06] model parent
[12:09] so we don't want to model ourselves
[12:10] after laodicea
[12:13] we don't want to model ourselves over
[12:14] the current you know understanding or
[12:16] the current conditions or the
[12:18] or the current accepted way for raising
[12:20] children we don't want to do that
[12:21] we want to look at the scriptures and
[12:23] look at the model parent and model
[12:25] ourselves after the model parent and
[12:27] that will be the word
[12:28] made flesh
[12:32] he also says and that's the backbone of
[12:35] the nation
[12:36] you break motherhood and you and you
[12:38] broke the nation right then
[12:40] that's one thing that helps hold it
[12:42] together real
[12:43] genuine parenthood amen schools will
[12:47] never compensate
[12:49] programs will never come and say
[12:50] psychiatrists never compensate
[12:52] for this so as we go through this i'm
[12:55] going to hit a lot of scriptures
[12:57] they're going to be on here i'm going to
[12:58] go through fast so if you want to jot
[12:59] them down jot them down
[13:00] but they'll also be on the website in
[13:03] the archaic archives
[13:04] my notes are always there so you can go
[13:06] in and download them you can go copy
[13:07] them but we're going to hit quite a few
[13:09] scriptures
[13:10] and we'll probably move pretty quick
[13:12] brother baby says the
[13:14] in the great coming revival in the
[13:15] outpouring of the holy spirit
[13:17] all the way back in 1954 he said oh it's
[13:20] a disgrace that our american woman ever
[13:22] put on a pair of overalls and went into
[13:24] a war plant to work
[13:25] i don't care how much that hurts but
[13:27] it's a disgrace it's breaking the
[13:29] backbone of this nation
[13:30] this little baby of yours needs you god
[13:33] gave you that baby to raise yourself
[13:35] not some babysitter that's right here
[13:38] not long ago they had some of these
[13:40] doctors that said let the baby lay and
[13:42] cry
[13:42] you nurse it at a certain time you don't
[13:45] pick it up if it cries let it cry it out
[13:47] they did that 25 years ago that was a
[13:50] great belief amongst the doctors
[13:51] come to find out it hatched out a bunch
[13:53] of neurotics
[13:54] let nature have its way god knows what's
[13:57] best the baby needs love
[13:59] if you take a love away from it you'll
[14:02] make a brute out of it
[14:03] that baby's got to have love you've got
[14:06] to take care of it
[14:09] so when we start at the beginning i want
[14:10] to start all the way back at the
[14:12] beginning
[14:13] what does this little infant baby need
[14:15] more than anything else it needs love
[14:18] the foundation for raising children is a
[14:21] revelation
[14:22] that god gave that child to you that's
[14:24] the heritage of the lord and a reward
[14:26] from the lord
[14:27] that's the starting point and blessed is
[14:30] the man that has a quiver for that's the
[14:31] starting point
[14:32] and then a determination as for me and
[14:34] my house will serve the lord
[14:36] but what is the foundation for raising
[14:38] children the foundation is
[14:40] love they need love
[14:44] brother ben makes this really clear i'm
[14:46] so glad to have a prophet
[14:52] says what brought on juvenile
[14:54] delinquency was parent delinquency
[14:57] the parent failing to take care of the
[14:59] children you remember a few years ago
[15:01] and stop reading i'm going to go back so
[15:03] you can't read
[15:05] i hate when you read ahead in my quote
[15:08] but but he says the problem is parent
[15:11] delinquency
[15:13] and and i want to say it this way then
[15:15] and every
[15:16] single one of us can be guilty of this
[15:20] the problem is laziness
[15:25] and selfishness and that's been my
[15:28] problem
[15:29] every one of my failings as a parent has
[15:32] been laziness and selfishness
[15:34] i won't use anybody else as an example i
[15:36] could use myself as an example
[15:38] all night long and my children say amen
[15:42] i just don't want to amen too loud
[15:47] but but the problem is selfishness and
[15:50] laziness
[15:52] because it's not really it's not really
[15:55] child discipline it's actually parental
[15:58] discipline
[15:59] because in order to administer child
[16:00] discipline you're going to have to be
[16:02] disciplined
[16:03] you're going to have to be consistent
[16:05] you're going to have to be steady
[16:07] you're going to have to get up when
[16:09] you're tired you're going to have to go
[16:11] into action when you don't feel like
[16:12] going to action
[16:13] you're going to have to not pretend you
[16:15] didn't just see that
[16:19] and everybody can say amen because
[16:21] everybody who's raised children have
[16:22] always every one of us have had that
[16:24] time when
[16:25] we pretended we didn't see that
[16:29] and you hope nobody else saw it either
[16:32] because you just don't feel like dealing
[16:34] with it right then
[16:36] you're tired you're frustrated the end
[16:39] of the day
[16:40] you just sat down you don't want to go
[16:42] through the whole
[16:43] rigmarole of chastisement and training
[16:45] and discipline
[16:46] and you know what that that laziness and
[16:49] that selfishness is what destroys
[16:51] children
[16:53] so we have to realize that i am going to
[16:56] make a personal sacrifice to do what god
[16:59] wants me to do it's not child
[17:01] delinquency it starts with parental
[17:03] delinquency
[17:04] and it becomes child delinquency now we
[17:07] go back to the quote
[17:09] the parent failing to take care of the
[17:11] child you remember a few years ago when
[17:13] my boy was born
[17:14] that's been about i think he's about 19
[17:16] now i remember the doctor told my wife
[17:18] said just let that kid squall
[17:20] said it ain't going to hurt him and if
[17:22] grandma comes along to pick him up
[17:24] keep her tell her to keep her hands off
[17:26] of him said he ought to be in a crib
[17:28] broke at six months old
[17:30] now you know better than that sounds
[17:32] like talking of a witch doctor instead
[17:34] of a real doctor
[17:36] we got some grandmas here i'd just love
[17:38] to see some people pull that statement
[17:39] on a few of you grandmas out there
[17:41] take your hands off that baby there'd be
[17:43] a real good discussion going on
[17:48] but see the the thought of the day was
[17:51] too regimented
[17:53] back in that day regiment the child
[17:55] nurse at a certain time
[17:56] lay it down don't interact too much with
[17:58] it you'll spoil the child
[18:00] don't cuddle it too much just nurse it
[18:02] and lay it down leave it by itself
[18:04] train it to cry it out
[18:08] brother ben said don't do that the only
[18:10] way the baby's got
[18:12] to to call for anything is to cry out
[18:14] for it
[18:15] that's nature's little bell he put in it
[18:18] cry
[18:18] and brother brahm told us don't do that
[18:20] that doesn't mean you don't teach him
[18:21] how to lay down and sleep that's not
[18:23] what he's talking about but this whole
[18:24] concept of
[18:25] don't overdo it don't call them too much
[18:27] don't hold them too much
[18:29] don't love them too much you'll spoil
[18:30] them you can't spoil an infant
[18:35] they say you can't spoil an infant
[18:40] you know he said now you know better
[18:42] than that sounds like a talking of a
[18:43] witch doctor instead of a real doctor
[18:46] and then you know that it hatched out
[18:48] and hatched out a bunch of neurotics and
[18:49] a bunch of gangsters listen
[18:51] god gave you that baby to love i don't
[18:53] care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow
[18:57] now the grandmas can use this quote
[19:04] amen grandmas amen there you go sister
[19:07] janet you got a quote
[19:10] i don't care how bad you spoil it love
[19:12] it anyhow what brother branham is
[19:14] telling us is the base the foundation
[19:16] for child training
[19:17] on uninterrupted unconditional uh
[19:20] unmerited love love and affection love
[19:24] and affection love and affection
[19:26] spoil that infant you're not gonna spoil
[19:28] the infant love it
[19:29] love it the pieces you do some more
[19:32] training as it gets older but not as an
[19:34] infant
[19:34] you're not training the child as an
[19:36] infant you're loving it
[19:39] he says god gave you that baby to love i
[19:42] don't care how bad you spoil it love it
[19:43] anyhow
[19:44] that's right love it if you don't love
[19:46] it now it'll grow up in a cold home
[19:48] and indifferent and it'll seek love
[19:50] somewhere or something
[19:52] it'll make it'll make an outline for
[19:54] somewhere
[19:55] mother take that baby and give it
[19:57] fellowship and love now
[19:59] make it a part of you which it is and
[20:01] act like it and hug it
[20:03] and kiss it and love it don't be too
[20:05] cold with the things of the world
[20:07] god gave you that as a treasure raise it
[20:09] right
[20:10] amen how many can say amen
[20:13] love it kiss it hug it
[20:16] cuddle it rock it sing to it
[20:20] what are you doing you're building
[20:21] security into that
[20:23] infant it's secure amen it's loved
[20:26] amen and when you start with security
[20:29] and unconditional love
[20:30] from then you can build to training but
[20:33] start by putting security into that
[20:35] infant
[20:37] you let a little baby just scream it out
[20:39] and cry it out you're going to build
[20:41] insecurity into that infant
[20:43] because they have no other way to get
[20:45] what they need than to cry for it
[20:49] but the english would say now the
[20:51] blessed thing here
[20:53] the reason i'm starting with this is
[20:54] because we're going to wind up with
[20:55] spanking
[20:58] so i bet i figured this was a good
[21:00] starting point if we're going to wind up
[21:01] with spanking
[21:03] i told my children i figured the best
[21:05] what would be best today is a live
[21:06] demonstration i want to know if one of
[21:08] them would volunteer
[21:13] they were willing to volunteer each
[21:14] other
[21:17] amen no live demonstrations
[21:21] i would also be in trouble with the
[21:22] grandmas
[21:25] all right now the blessed thing in here
[21:29] was talking to a young lady just a few
[21:31] moments ago that was suffering from a
[21:33] nervous condition
[21:34] and the nervous condition said she said
[21:37] now how she had tried to overcome it
[21:39] i'm not much of a christian science or
[21:41] unitarian i don't believe that
[21:43] there's anything like mind over matter i
[21:45] believe god is a healer
[21:47] that lady was born in that nervous
[21:48] condition her mother and father died
[21:50] when she was a child
[21:52] baby and raised up just tossed about
[21:54] everywhere and never had the proper love
[21:56] and care that a baby
[21:58] has and what did it start in her
[22:01] a nervous condition that she is going to
[22:03] need healed and delivered from
[22:07] you know mother i want to tell you
[22:08] something i know i got a little boy back
[22:11] there and he's really
[22:12] rankly spoiled he wasn't talking about
[22:16] the 19 year old this time
[22:18] he was talking about the infant
[22:21] he's really rankly spoiled but i would
[22:24] rather have him that way
[22:25] i believe it will make a better man out
[22:27] of him if god lets him live than to let
[22:29] him scream and cry
[22:31] and upset his little self listen a few
[22:33] years ago some normal modern witch
[22:35] doctor said that
[22:36] let that baby cry don't pick it up
[22:38] that's all all things like that
[22:40] don't let grandma touch it and you know
[22:42] what that hatched out you see what it is
[22:44] a juvenile delinquency a bunch of
[22:46] neurotics
[22:47] god made a baby to be loved that's why
[22:50] he made a mother to love a baby
[22:52] that's why we're supposed to be this way
[22:54] god made it that way and any time that
[22:56] you upset god's program
[22:58] you must remember you're wrong and will
[23:00] be wrong and as long as you're upsetting
[23:02] god's program
[23:03] following follow god's program do it the
[23:06] way
[23:06] god said do it amen
[23:09] love that baby love that infant you got
[23:11] that nathan and natalie
[23:13] i don't think you actually needed the
[23:14] quote but
[23:17] love it love that baby
[23:20] that security that bond is going to pay
[23:23] off for years to come
[23:25] there's got to be a bond that brings us
[23:27] security
[23:28] between mother and infant and father and
[23:31] child and mother and father
[23:33] and when there's that love that
[23:34] unconditional love that
[23:36] that that overwhelming secure
[23:39] love where the child is secured held
[23:43] comforted amen when it's whenever
[23:45] whenever it's distressed it's comforted
[23:47] whenever it has needs they're met
[23:49] amen you're building a security in the
[23:51] child and you're starting from a
[23:53] foundation of security
[23:54] and a foundation of love and from there
[23:57] you can begin
[23:58] training but if you start them insecure
[24:02] amen and without the right kind of love
[24:03] and affection you're gonna have
[24:05] you're gonna have difficulty down the
[24:07] road
[24:08] a lot of people have difficult situation
[24:11] oddities in their emotions emotional uh
[24:14] uh frailties and oddities because they
[24:16] didn't get the right kind of love as an
[24:18] infant
[24:19] but guess what we still believe god's a
[24:21] healer
[24:22] if you find yourself in that situation
[24:24] amen god's a healer
[24:27] he can heal that if mama didn't give you
[24:29] what you needed
[24:30] he can give you what you need if daddy
[24:32] didn't give you what you needed he can
[24:34] give you what you need
[24:35] if you recognize maybe tonight is the
[24:37] first time you recognize
[24:39] i struggle emotionally and i struggle in
[24:41] my nerves
[24:42] and now i recognize it goes all the way
[24:44] back i never had a mother that was an
[24:46] affectionate with me
[24:47] i never had a dad who called on me and
[24:49] loved me amen if that just hit you
[24:51] tonight
[24:51] he's still a healer tonight he's still
[24:54] the original parent
[24:56] and he can give you whatever you lacked
[24:58] from your earthly parent
[25:00] your heavenly parent is more than able
[25:03] to make up for it
[25:04] and once you recognize what the problem
[25:07] is all you have to do is say god you're
[25:09] the original father you're my original
[25:11] mother
[25:11] amen and my dad and mom may have failed
[25:14] me for whatever reasons may not even
[25:16] been that they knew what they were doing
[25:18] but i recognize they failed me and i
[25:20] need you
[25:21] to heal me from this condition i believe
[25:24] if you approach him that way with an
[25:26] understanding of what happened with
[25:27] faith as him as a healer that god is
[25:29] going to resolve that
[25:30] issue in your life and take away the
[25:32] effects of what was left out when you
[25:34] were a baby
[25:37] sometimes you don't even know what it
[25:38] was until something like this and all
[25:40] sudden something begins to trigger
[25:42] and if it just triggered for you there's
[25:44] a solution
[25:45] you don't have to go on the way you're
[25:47] going on
[25:50] and ephesians 6 and 4 says and you
[25:52] fathers provoke not your children to
[25:54] wrath
[25:55] but bring them up in the nurture and
[25:57] admonition of the lord
[25:58] i want to look at this scripture again
[26:00] now we're going to get into child
[26:01] training
[26:02] child rearing moving from infant to
[26:04] toddlers
[26:05] and on up we're not going to talk about
[26:07] teenagers or young adults we'll do that
[26:09] some other time but we're just talking
[26:10] about those young children
[26:11] we're moving from infant to toddler
[26:13] training them on up through the young
[26:15] child phase
[26:18] this word nurture means the whole
[26:20] training
[26:21] and education of children which relates
[26:24] to the cultivation of the mind and
[26:25] morals and employs for this purpose
[26:28] now commandments and admonitions now
[26:30] reproof
[26:31] and punishment so nurture it it's the
[26:35] full instruction
[26:36] which includes instruction teaching
[26:39] reproofs
[26:40] punishment admonitions
[26:43] and admonition or or exhortation
[26:48] which means counsel or warning against
[26:50] fault
[26:52] so so it's got the full instruction with
[26:56] teaching and correction but also the
[26:59] counseling the coaching the
[27:00] the warning the the preaching
[27:04] that goes along with it
[27:07] second timothy 3 16 says all scripture
[27:09] is given by inspiration of god
[27:11] and is profitable for doctrine teaching
[27:15] for reproof proving or convicting
[27:19] for correction which is restoring to a
[27:22] right state
[27:24] and for instruction in righteousness
[27:26] which is training nurture
[27:28] that includes the punishment as well
[27:31] punishing into righteousness correcting
[27:33] into righteousness
[27:35] so all scripture is given by inspiration
[27:37] of god is it profitable for doctrine
[27:39] for reproof for correction for
[27:41] instruction and righteousness
[27:42] if you want to bring up a child right
[27:44] bring them up on the word
[27:46] have a word reason for why we do the
[27:48] things that we do
[27:50] have a word explanation for why we make
[27:52] the choices we make as a family
[27:55] i mean it's still appropriate to say
[27:57] because i said so
[27:59] i'm not going to take that away because
[28:00] that's still the word right honor thy
[28:02] father and thy mother that's still the
[28:03] scripture because i said so
[28:05] but as we're training a child we don't
[28:07] want it to always be because i said so
[28:09] because when they're 35 they're going to
[28:11] have to give you a call
[28:13] because they got no spiritual word
[28:16] instruction along the way
[28:17] so as we correct amen as we instruct we
[28:21] do it with the word
[28:22] amen we do it because the word says amen
[28:24] and that doesn't that doesn't mean you
[28:26] always have to give a ten part thesis on
[28:28] your child every time you give them
[28:29] instructions
[28:31] if anybody knows me knows i that
[28:33] frustrates me to no end
[28:34] i'm not going to debate my decisions
[28:38] but still we bring them up on the word
[28:41] on the word and the word is profitable
[28:44] for all of those things
[28:47] now i want to go back to seals trumpets
[28:50] and vials i taught this
[28:51] a couple years ago i went back and i
[28:54] looked at my notes it was
[28:55] 2017 july of 2017. so it's far enough
[28:59] back i can do it again
[29:01] but it's the principle of seals trumpets
[29:03] and vials and if we go
[29:05] and we're going to take this and apply
[29:06] it to child training and it works for
[29:08] more than child training if you're a
[29:09] supervisor at a job
[29:11] i've had some brothers tell me two of
[29:12] them now says hey i took what you said
[29:14] about seals trumples and vials
[29:16] and i used it at work and it works great
[29:19] because this is god's plan this is the
[29:21] way god deals with his children
[29:23] and god deals with his children if you
[29:25] look at the book of revelation
[29:26] and brother brahm types this through the
[29:28] church ages and seals
[29:30] trumpets and vials so we'll look at this
[29:34] in the sixth seal said the messenger the
[29:36] angel come on earth the messenger of the
[29:38] hour
[29:38] like luther's like any of the messengers
[29:40] that we've talked of
[29:42] what does he do he arrives and a seal
[29:44] opened
[29:45] reveals a trumpet sounds war declared
[29:48] and away they go
[29:49] and when the messenger dies he seals
[29:51] away this group
[29:52] they're put in and a plague falls upon
[29:55] those who rejected him
[29:56] so you see a seal a seal opens
[29:59] and reveals a trumpet sounds war is
[30:02] declared
[30:04] and then the messenger dies and then a
[30:06] plague falls on those who reject it
[30:08] so there's three these three things go
[30:11] together seals trumpets and vials
[30:14] seals is a mystery revealed
[30:17] don't forget we're talking about child
[30:19] training
[30:20] it's a mystery revealed
[30:23] and the first theory says here's the
[30:25] plan event the first thing that happened
[30:27] there is an announcement in the heavens
[30:29] first what happened
[30:30] a seal is open what is that a mystery is
[30:33] unfolded
[30:34] and when a mystery unfolds then a
[30:36] trumpet sounds
[30:38] so the first thing that that god does
[30:41] amen
[30:42] and he did this down through the church
[30:43] ages the first thing he does
[30:45] is he reveals something or he he breaks
[30:48] the seal or he opens up
[30:50] something that's in his mind so when
[30:53] we're training children the first thing
[30:55] we need to do to them is break the seal
[30:58] because they didn't come into the earth
[31:00] all knowing
[31:02] they're not born again and they don't
[31:04] know what you know
[31:07] like like sometimes i've had things that
[31:09] happen in our family i'm like
[31:10] what were you thinking why did you do
[31:12] that and i have to remember
[31:14] he's seven you know he's never done this
[31:16] before to me it's obvious
[31:20] but to him it's not so obvious to her
[31:22] it's not so
[31:23] obvious amen instead of just going
[31:26] straight to rebuke
[31:28] amen straight to chastising amen what we
[31:31] have to do first is break a seal and
[31:33] when something happens in
[31:34] immaturity and we realize wait a minute
[31:37] they
[31:37] don't know what's right or what's wrong
[31:40] in this choice they don't know
[31:42] what's godly and what's not godly in
[31:44] this choice the first thing i have to do
[31:46] in child training is first break a seal
[31:49] and reveal to them
[31:51] what's in my mind the way i want them to
[31:53] choose the way i want them to behave
[31:55] how to handle this situation there's no
[31:58] reason to correct
[32:00] unless you first broke a seal so we've
[32:03] got to teach
[32:04] the first thing we have to do is teach
[32:06] our children
[32:07] train them
[32:13] i'll say it this way we are
[32:16] always training our children
[32:20] everything we do every day is training
[32:22] our children
[32:23] we're either training them the right way
[32:25] or we're training them the wrong way
[32:28] but no instruction is still training
[32:32] so we're training and we're going to be
[32:34] responsible for the way we train
[32:36] so we might as well adjust our thinking
[32:38] to the fact that every day
[32:40] every interaction everything i'm doing
[32:42] is training my child
[32:43] i'm either training them to respect and
[32:45] reverent i'm training them to disrespect
[32:50] i'm training them to follow rules i'm
[32:52] training them not to follow rules
[32:54] but we're still training you'll find
[32:58] that some children are a piece of cake
[33:01] they have a compliant nature they're
[33:04] just
[33:04] born happy they're just
[33:07] born like a golden retriever they just
[33:11] want to make you happy
[33:13] and if they know what you want they'll
[33:14] do it if you like it you show them once
[33:16] they do the best they can to do it that
[33:18] way every time
[33:20] but some of them are born like a bulldog
[33:22] you know
[33:24] and they don't have that same nature
[33:30] so what do you do you keep breaking the
[33:32] seal
[33:34] you go to the trumpets you go to the
[33:36] vials
[33:37] you use god's plan some children are
[33:39] easy some children are harder but it
[33:41] doesn't change the fact they're still
[33:42] the children god gave to you
[33:45] and sometimes the easy children are the
[33:47] steps deceptive ones
[33:50] the children that aren't easy are are a
[33:51] piece of cake and one other way
[33:53] is you always know what's on their mind
[33:55] and you always know what they're
[33:55] thinking
[33:58] there's no guess you always know what's
[34:00] happening it's not done in secret
[34:01] it's not sneaky it's wide open right in
[34:04] your face you know what you're dealing
[34:06] with
[34:06] day one the compliant ones
[34:10] sometimes have learned how to make you
[34:12] happy and to make themselves happy at
[34:14] the same time
[34:15] they can be the dangerous ones and
[34:17] sometimes they're the ones that you
[34:19] shower the praise on
[34:20] and the other ones are the ones that get
[34:22] all the criticism but the ones you
[34:23] shower the praise on
[34:24] are making you happy and the preacher
[34:26] happy and grandma happy and they're in
[34:28] the bedroom doing whatever they're not
[34:30] supposed to be doing
[34:31] and keeping the whole show going
[34:35] so don't be deceived sometimes those
[34:37] easy ones are tricky
[34:39] you gotta the whole process is gonna
[34:42] take the leadership of the holy ghost
[34:44] you're gonna have to be discerning and
[34:46] let god lead and let the leadership of
[34:48] the holy ghost
[34:49] work through you as you train those
[34:51] children
[34:53] praise god
[34:59] so seals a mystery is revealed the
[35:02] trumpets a warning of judgment or war
[35:05] and you have to say why war because when
[35:07] brother branham talked about it through
[35:08] the church ages
[35:09] he said as luther broke a seal amen he
[35:12] broke a seal and gave the revelation of
[35:14] justification
[35:16] amen and it created a spiritual warfare
[35:18] amen and then when he was they were
[35:20] sealed away in that generation those
[35:21] rejected and a plague was poured out
[35:24] so i'll say like it is in the bible
[35:28] first he breaks a seal then when you
[35:30] come to trump it's trumpets or warnings
[35:32] of judgments or impending judgments or
[35:34] or warnings but it's also can be war
[35:36] when we come to your child
[35:38] amen not that you have war with your
[35:40] child but they begin to have war with
[35:42] themselves because once you break the
[35:45] seal and you tell them what to do
[35:47] now they've got a little nature that
[35:48] they have to resist
[35:51] and when you told them not to do that
[35:53] all of a sudden you broke a seal
[35:55] and and immediately the next time they
[35:57] face that situation
[35:58] war is breaking out now
[36:02] they're they're warring with that old
[36:03] nature to do the right or do the wrong
[36:05] do it mom said do what i want to do
[36:07] amen and a war breaks out amen but but
[36:10] then
[36:11] if they don't listen if they don't obey
[36:14] that's when you you sound the trumpet so
[36:16] we'll get into that here
[36:19] and god never even brings judgment upon
[36:22] the earth without first giving the
[36:24] people
[36:24] a warning god never does nothing without
[36:28] declaring at first
[36:30] that he's going to do and he gives
[36:32] people a chance and you can
[36:33] do right or wrong god can never change
[36:36] his nature
[36:37] his program can never change from what
[36:39] he started with
[36:40] because he's infinite and his program
[36:42] and his ideas are all perfect
[36:46] so god never brings judgment upon the
[36:48] earth without
[36:50] a warning who's the original parent
[36:55] god so first there's instruction we
[36:58] break a seal
[36:59] and then many times especially when
[37:01] you're dealing with toddlers and really
[37:03] young children
[37:04] there's levels of immaturity you know
[37:06] there's you can't set your expectations
[37:09] too high
[37:10] you got to make sure your expectations
[37:13] match
[37:14] the child and the age that they're at
[37:17] because we can have wrong expectations
[37:19] and all you're going to do is end up
[37:20] frustrating this child
[37:22] because this child doesn't have the
[37:23] maturity to meet the expectations
[37:27] but but when you understand where that
[37:29] child is and their age and their
[37:31] development and
[37:32] who you're dealing with amen and that
[37:34] god gave that child to you
[37:37] for a reason maybe to train you
[37:42] but god didn't make a mistake in putting
[37:44] these two together amen god
[37:46] that means that you're the tool that god
[37:49] is going to use mom and dad you're the
[37:50] tool that's going to shape this child
[37:53] so that means you have to be anointed
[37:55] you have to be led of the holy ghost but
[37:57] you have to believe
[37:58] that i've got what it takes to do this
[38:01] god put them with me because i'm the
[38:03] right one to lead i'm the right one to
[38:05] instruct or else god would have put this
[38:07] life somewhere else
[38:08] but god put this life here because i
[38:11] whatever it is god can use
[38:13] me to shape this child so the first
[38:15] thing we do is break a seal
[38:17] and bring instructions or something from
[38:19] our mind to the trial knows
[38:21] then when you see the child go the wrong
[38:24] way
[38:24] or make the wrong decision you sound a
[38:27] trumpet you blow a trumpet
[38:29] you give a warning that can be verbal
[38:33] or that can be come sit here for a
[38:34] minute and i remember what i told you
[38:36] remember when i broke the seal remember
[38:39] let's go to this room and talk okay now
[38:41] you come out you sound a trumpet
[38:43] amen trumpet is not bickering
[38:47] a trumpet is not nagging a trumpet is a
[38:51] good solid warning
[38:55] and that good solid warning might come
[38:57] with sitting here for a few minutes
[38:58] beside me you need to take a break and
[39:00] think about this you need to go back
[39:02] here and talk with me
[39:03] you need to come over here i want to i'm
[39:05] sounding a trumpet
[39:06] first i gave you the instruction now
[39:08] you're getting the warning
[39:12] the next
[39:18] seal trumpet
[39:21] vials the plague is being poured out
[39:27] brother behind said in this message i
[39:28] believe that the things that you see
[39:30] are taking place now as a preparation
[39:33] god is preparing something
[39:34] just before a climax god always warns
[39:36] the world
[39:37] and then if they will not receive
[39:39] warning then there's only one thing left
[39:41] that's judgment
[39:43] noah warned the world and they would not
[39:45] receive it and all through the age
[39:47] god always warned he sends mercy and if
[39:50] they spurn
[39:51] mercy there's nothing else left but
[39:52] judgment but the but the merciful father
[39:55] will send
[39:56] mercy first who's the original parent
[40:01] who's the model parent who would send a
[40:04] warning first
[40:05] before judgment first he'll break the
[40:08] seal
[40:09] then he'll blow the trumpet and if all
[40:12] of that is ignored
[40:13] then god will pour out the vial when the
[40:16] plague will hit
[40:19] so before we jump to chastisement
[40:22] we've got to go through a couple steps
[40:24] first
[40:25] before the child gets a spanking first
[40:28] there's got to be
[40:29] a breaking of a seal some instruction
[40:32] then there's got to be a good
[40:33] solid warning a trumpet and then if it's
[40:36] still
[40:37] refused then when we pour out the plague
[40:39] by the time we pour out the vial
[40:42] and the plague falls it is well deserved
[40:46] nobody's in question whether it should
[40:48] be administered or not
[40:49] you or the child everybody knows
[40:53] i mean you can even see after you've
[40:55] gone through this process with a child
[40:57] and they know what the process
[40:58] is of breaking the seal sounding the
[41:00] trumpet you can
[41:02] see them grimace as they do what they're
[41:04] not supposed to do because they know
[41:06] that the plague's coming and they and
[41:08] they deserve it
[41:10] is that right but we run into problems
[41:13] when we get out of god's program
[41:15] when we get out of god's program and we
[41:17] just decide
[41:18] to blow a trumpet blow a trumpet blow a
[41:20] trumpet blow a trumpet and we never
[41:22] broke the seal all we do is bicker and
[41:26] yell and bicker and yell
[41:27] and complain and chastise and criticize
[41:30] but we never took the time to patiently
[41:33] explain the behavior we wanted
[41:36] to patiently break what was our desire
[41:38] in our mind and take time to give
[41:40] instruction
[41:40] so that the child understands what is
[41:42] wrong what is right
[41:44] what you want done in this situation
[41:46] amen but you see parents all the time
[41:48] just yell yell yell yell yell but
[41:51] there's no instruction
[41:53] child touches this i meant stop that to
[41:56] just quit that
[41:57] touch this i told you not to touch but
[41:59] does the child know what he's allowed to
[42:00] touch and not allowed to
[42:02] touch has anybody stopped long enough to
[42:06] give an explanation
[42:08] and then you see trumpet trumpet trumpet
[42:10] now everybody's been in the grocery
[42:12] store
[42:14] and all you hear is trumpets
[42:19] i told you not to do that you can't have
[42:20] that i'm going to count to three
[42:22] and my goodness you count the three and
[42:25] you count the three and you count the
[42:27] three
[42:27] and the parents got good exercise and
[42:29] counting and the child has not changed
[42:30] their behavior one drop
[42:33] because all it is is trumpets but
[42:35] there's never a vial
[42:37] there's never consequences there's never
[42:40] the promised punishment
[42:41] it's never they've never gone through
[42:43] the whole process but if we do things
[42:45] god's way and we go through the whole
[42:46] process of breaking the seal
[42:48] sounding the trumpet then pouring out
[42:50] the vial it
[42:51] will absolutely work because that's the
[42:55] way god does it for us
[42:57] so he did it through the church ages
[42:58] that's why he does it in the book of
[42:59] revelation
[43:00] this is the way god does it and if god
[43:02] did it this way
[43:04] and we take his pattern as our own
[43:06] pattern
[43:07] and we do it by faith then we know that
[43:09] it will bring the right results
[43:14] let's go to revelation 16. we'll go to
[43:18] the vials
[43:30] revelation 16 start in verse 4
[43:34] which is under the third vial there's
[43:36] some terminology here i want you to hear
[43:40] now when we get to the vials the world
[43:42] has already had the breaking of the
[43:44] seals
[43:45] signing of the trumpets there's been
[43:47] warnings that have been given through
[43:48] prophets
[43:49] now we come down to the end god's mercy
[43:51] has been spurned
[43:53] all the warnings have been ignored
[43:55] everything that god could possibly do
[43:56] has been rejected
[43:58] so now we finally come to the pouring
[43:59] out of the vials in the tribulation
[44:01] period
[44:02] and he says and the third angel poured
[44:03] out his vial upon the rivers and
[44:05] fountains of waters
[44:06] and they became blood and i heard the
[44:08] angels of the water say thou art
[44:10] righteous
[44:11] o lord thou art and wust and shall be
[44:14] because thou has judged us
[44:18] all of a sudden the angel is declaring
[44:20] god righteous
[44:22] because he pours out the vile
[44:26] the proof of his righteousness is that
[44:29] he does what he'll say he'll do
[44:31] and when he says he'll bring judgment he
[44:33] brings judgments
[44:36] and the angel said thou are righteous
[44:38] because
[44:41] that thou art righteous
[44:45] sorry thou art righteous o lord which
[44:46] art and lust and shalt be because thou
[44:48] has judged us
[44:50] for they have shed the blood of saints
[44:51] and prophets and now has given them
[44:53] blood to drink
[44:54] for they are worthy and i heard another
[44:57] out of the altar say even so lord god
[44:59] almighty
[45:00] true and righteous are thy judgments so
[45:03] by the time we get to the vials
[45:05] the angels declaring you're righteous
[45:07] because you judge this way
[45:08] and this judgment is true and righteous
[45:13] and if we deal with our children this
[45:14] way they'll even have to admit that
[45:17] you're right your judgments are true and
[45:19] righteous
[45:20] because you you you took the time to
[45:23] give the instruction they clearly
[45:24] understood what was wanted
[45:26] you took time and you gave a good
[45:28] sounding trumpet a good warning a good
[45:31] minor judgment a good precursor to
[45:33] judgment
[45:34] and when then that was rejected you
[45:36] poured out the plague
[45:37] and because you judged that way you're a
[45:39] righteous parent
[45:41] how many want to be a righteous parent
[45:43] then that's going to take some
[45:45] self-discipline there's no shortcuts
[45:48] here
[45:49] you know you see all the time when we
[45:51] shortcut this and short circuit this
[45:53] pattern we do a lot of damage
[45:56] we just bicker and yell at the kids but
[45:58] no there was never any time taken for
[46:00] instruction
[46:01] just yell yell yell trumpet trumpet
[46:03] trumpet amen the children becomes
[46:05] frustrated the parents become frustrated
[46:07] the whole loving relationship becomes
[46:09] frustrated
[46:10] remember we're going to build this
[46:12] foundation of child training on love
[46:15] but everybody's frustrated all the time
[46:17] because the child doesn't really know
[46:19] they've never been down this road before
[46:21] they're getting yelled at but they don't
[46:23] really know what they're getting yelled
[46:24] at before because nobody took the time
[46:26] to clearly
[46:27] explain what i'm supposed to be doing
[46:31] parents are getting frustrated because
[46:33] they think somehow the child should
[46:34] automatically know
[46:38] the biggest mistake that i've made in my
[46:40] life is just assuming my children know
[46:41] what i know
[46:45] like they've done things before and i'm
[46:47] like how could they possibly think
[46:48] that's right
[46:51] but i forgot i was seven years old
[46:54] and i didn't know you know so
[46:58] when we short circuit this program we
[47:00] begin to mess things up
[47:03] then when we skip the trumpet and we go
[47:06] from seal to plague what do you think
[47:10] that's going to do
[47:13] will your judgments be righteous will
[47:16] they be true and righteous because those
[47:18] judged this way
[47:19] no we can't go from seal
[47:23] straight to the vial pouring out the
[47:25] plague
[47:26] but if we go seals trumpets vials
[47:30] it'll work i had one man he became a new
[47:34] supervisor
[47:36] on the job and he said he heard this
[47:39] preached and he said he he went to work
[47:43] and
[47:43] he took a supervisor's position first
[47:45] time for him to be in any leadership in
[47:46] any kind of supervisory role
[47:48] and his boss wanted him to read a book
[47:51] on being a manager
[47:53] something like that and he heard this
[47:56] preached
[47:56] and he told his boss he didn't want the
[47:58] book and he applied this
[48:01] and he said it worked perfect
[48:04] because it does because it's god amen
[48:08] it's the way god did us if god's done us
[48:11] this way
[48:12] then it works
[48:13] [Music]
[48:16] look at this quote from handwriting on
[48:18] the wall
[48:19] and i've made this statement if this
[48:21] nation escapes judgment god will be
[48:23] obligated to raise up sodom and gomorrah
[48:24] and apologize
[48:26] for sinking them and burning them up for
[48:28] we are just as wicked as sodom and
[48:30] gomorrah ever was
[48:31] and if he sunk sodom and gomorrah and
[48:33] burnt them up because of their sin
[48:35] he doesn't deal and he doesn't deal the
[48:37] same way with us
[48:38] then he would be unjust and owe them an
[48:40] apology
[48:41] god doesn't have to apologize to nobody
[48:43] or nothing
[48:44] sin will be judged and it'll be punished
[48:47] just as sure as there's a god
[48:48] who can make judgment and god's judgment
[48:51] is holy
[48:52] god is holy and therefore his judgments
[48:55] and his work must be just and holy
[48:57] because sorry because it becomes a holy
[49:00] god
[49:01] for his works and his judgment so god's
[49:04] judgments are holy
[49:05] amen let's follow his pattern and do
[49:07] things the same way
[49:10] amen now
[49:14] i'm going to wrap up this evening we're
[49:15] going to look at a bunch of quotes on
[49:17] chastisement
[49:18] which is punishment which is corporal
[49:21] punishment
[49:22] for no nicer way to say it just a good
[49:24] old-fashioned spanking
[49:26] everybody's favorite topic corinthians
[49:30] 11 31
[49:31] for if we would judge ourselves we
[49:33] should not be judged
[49:34] but when we are judged we are chastened
[49:36] to the lord that we should not be
[49:38] condemned with the world
[49:41] oh there's a key why are we chastened
[49:48] why does god chasten us because we're
[49:51] his children
[49:54] we belong to him we're not somebody
[49:55] else's children
[49:58] you don't chase in the neighbor's child
[50:00] at least you better not
[50:03] you have big big problems that might
[50:05] have worked a hundred years ago it's not
[50:06] going to work today
[50:09] but when we were judged we are chasten
[50:11] of the lord
[50:12] that we should not be condemned with the
[50:15] world
[50:16] god has a goal and god has an objective
[50:20] in chastening
[50:20] us and if we're going to bring any
[50:23] chastisement to our children
[50:25] we have to have a goal and then we have
[50:27] to have a purpose for that chastisement
[50:29] and we have to know ahead of time what
[50:30] is it we're trying to accomplish
[50:32] because these are our children and we
[50:33] don't want them lost in the world
[50:35] we don't want them to go outside of
[50:37] god's boundaries we don't want them to
[50:38] go the wrong way
[50:39] amen this is the right way according to
[50:41] the word and through chastisement we're
[50:43] going to keep them in the right way
[50:44] because this is where the blessings are
[50:47] and then so we know now why we're
[50:49] chastised that's why we chastise
[50:53] in hebrews 12 he says and ye have
[50:55] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[50:56] unto you as unto children
[50:58] my son despise not thou the chastening
[51:01] of the lord nor
[51:02] faint when thou are rebuked of him for
[51:04] whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[51:06] and scourgeth every son whom he
[51:08] receiveth
[51:09] so who gets chastened the one he loves
[51:13] and every son he receiveth who gets
[51:16] chastened the children
[51:18] chastening is a good thing chastening
[51:22] shows love and chastening shows
[51:26] who the one being chastened belongs to
[51:31] the lord whom the lord loveth he
[51:32] chasteneth and scourges every son whom
[51:34] he receiveth
[51:35] if you endure chastening god dealeth
[51:37] with you as with sons
[51:38] for what son is he whom the father
[51:40] chasteneth not
[51:41] but if he be without chastisement
[51:43] whereof all are partakers
[51:45] then are ye bastards and not sons
[51:48] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[51:50] flesh which corrected us
[51:51] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[51:53] much
[51:54] rather be in subjection into the father
[51:56] of spirits and live
[51:58] for they verily for a few days chastened
[52:00] us after their own pleasure
[52:02] but he for our prophet
[52:08] praise be to god who's the model parent
[52:12] who are we modeling ourselves after he
[52:15] chastened us because he loves us
[52:18] he's chasing us because we're sons and
[52:20] he chasteneth us for
[52:22] our prophet for our benefit
[52:28] amen but he for our prophet that we
[52:30] might be partakers of his holiness
[52:32] now no chastening for the present
[52:34] seemeth to be joyous but grievous
[52:36] nevertheless afterward
[52:38] it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[52:39] righteousness unto them
[52:41] which are exercised thereby
[52:44] praise be to god how many's been chasing
[52:46] of the lord
[52:47] how many can say his rod in his staff
[52:49] they comfort you
[52:51] you know if you'll get too far this way
[52:52] too far that way the rod will come down
[52:54] and he'll bring you back and he'll chase
[52:56] in you
[52:56] and you can say thank you god for
[52:58] chasing me it proves i have a father
[53:00] it proves i am a son it proves that he's
[53:02] going to chasten me so that i will not
[53:04] be condemned with the world and he
[53:05] chases me from my prophet
[53:09] let's take the same approach then and
[53:11] bring it to our children so that they
[53:12] can say the same thing
[53:14] my father loves me my mother loves me
[53:16] they're looking out for my best interest
[53:18] they love me and they want me to turn
[53:19] out right and they don't want me to be
[53:21] condemned and they're doing this for my
[53:22] prophet
[53:24] they may not say that when they're four
[53:26] but when they're 40 they may
[53:29] that's why you have to when we're
[53:31] talking about child trading
[53:32] you've got to have a far-reaching vision
[53:36] it can't be about the next five minutes
[53:38] because you're going to get tired
[53:39] because it looks like sometimes
[53:40] nothing's happening especially with a
[53:43] two and three year old
[53:46] you're dealing with a two and three year
[53:47] old and sometimes you do the same lesson
[53:50] five times in one day
[53:53] same lesson same lesson same lesson
[53:57] and you're thinking this isn't going
[53:58] anywhere but you just stick with it for
[54:00] a little while and in no
[54:02] time at all you're over that hump and on
[54:04] to the next one
[54:06] and it doesn't look like progress but
[54:08] it's progress
[54:10] it's progress one step at a time but you
[54:12] can't be
[54:13] focused on the immediate results
[54:16] you have to have a far-reaching vision
[54:18] if we're focused on the immediate
[54:20] results sometimes we come too hard
[54:24] too firm too angry because we want
[54:27] immediate results but really we got to
[54:29] have a far-reaching goal
[54:31] we're looking to the target and our
[54:33] target is not
[54:34] amen just to make life easier for
[54:36] ourselves
[54:37] for the next five ten minutes our target
[54:40] is to raise these children to serve god
[54:43] that at some point if the if the world
[54:45] should continue on and time should
[54:47] continue
[54:47] then i'm gonna take this little boy and
[54:49] this little girl and i'm gonna teach
[54:51] them how to serve god
[54:52] independent of me how to live their own
[54:54] life how to be responsible
[54:56] how to be obedient how to worship the
[54:59] lord and serve the lord how to be
[55:00] husbands and wives and raise children
[55:02] and
[55:03] be part of the church and take the
[55:04] position independent of myself
[55:09] and so we've got to keep that in focus
[55:11] when they're little and all the way
[55:12] through
[55:13] that we're actually raising them to turn
[55:15] them loose
[55:18] but if we do it right we get a lifelong
[55:20] benefit
[55:24] brother member says you're a father and
[55:26] a mother and you tell your children you
[55:28] go over there i'll give you a whipping
[55:30] if you love that child and he
[55:31] transgresses your laws you'll keep your
[55:33] word
[55:36] that's love and
[55:39] funny enough it relates to love in a
[55:41] child
[55:42] they can draw the equation if it's done
[55:45] correctly it relates to love
[55:47] you go over he said you go over i'll
[55:49] give you a whipping if you love that
[55:51] child and he transgresses your loss
[55:52] you'll keep your word that's right but
[55:55] if you let him go on
[55:57] well that's all right do it again see
[55:59] that's what makes all these
[56:01] here little melinda's and rickey's and
[56:03] so forth around
[56:04] that's what makes juvenile delinquency
[56:07] what makes juvenile delinquency
[56:09] parental delinquency giving idle threats
[56:12] with no meaning behind it
[56:14] threatening threatening threatening when
[56:16] nothing happens on the backside
[56:18] amen that creates child delinquency
[56:22] and it's parent delinquency because the
[56:23] parent doesn't have enough
[56:25] self-discipline
[56:26] to follow through with the threat
[56:29] if i can give you this advice this is
[56:30] another one of my failures
[56:34] don't give a threat you're not willing
[56:36] to follow up
[56:41] because i've done it before you do this
[56:43] and this this and this and they do it
[56:45] and all of a sudden i'm like i don't
[56:46] want to do this this and this
[56:49] it's inconvenient for me it's going to
[56:51] take a lot of my time
[56:52] it's going to i wish i wouldn't have
[56:55] said that all right
[56:58] so we've got to be careful that in the
[57:00] heat of the moment we don't just try
[57:01] throw out a bunch of really hard
[57:03] consequences
[57:05] to try to deter behavior because you're
[57:08] not going to deter behavior by just
[57:10] verbal consequences and what we're
[57:12] trying to do sometimes
[57:13] is we're trying to use our mouth to
[57:15] control our children
[57:18] and so we make it really bad you know if
[57:21] you do this
[57:22] you're not going to go anywhere you're
[57:23] going to sit right next to me and stand
[57:24] right next to me
[57:25] and blah blah blah blah blah and for two
[57:28] months
[57:32] and then you realize you've just changed
[57:34] yourself to that child
[57:36] for two months
[57:39] but what we're trying to do is we're
[57:41] trying we we don't really want to go
[57:43] through the process of proper training
[57:46] we're trying to shortcut it somewhere
[57:48] and when we shortcut it we end up
[57:49] frustrating ourselves
[57:50] and we don't follow through with the
[57:52] threat because the threat's inconvenient
[57:53] for us
[57:54] and then we're starting child
[57:55] delinquency
[57:58] because we're teaching them that my
[58:00] threat doesn't mean anything
[58:02] i just say but it doesn't matter maybe
[58:04] 50
[58:05] it happens 50 is not hey a child is
[58:07] willing to take those odds
[58:11] half the time you do it half the time
[58:13] you don't well you know i never know
[58:14] this might be one of those times i get
[58:16] away with it you have some children that
[58:18] will never risk it on those odds those
[58:20] are your careful children
[58:22] you have some children that will always
[58:24] put it all on the table for that odd
[58:27] amen if you've raised more than three or
[58:30] four you know what i'm talking about
[58:33] all right so we got to be careful that
[58:36] we are as righteous as god is righteous
[58:38] in our judgments
[58:40] that we say what we mean and we mean
[58:42] what we say when we give instruction we
[58:44] give good clear instruction
[58:47] then when we follow it up with a trumpet
[58:49] a warning that whatever we threaten to
[58:52] do
[58:53] is something that we are able and
[58:55] willing to do
[58:58] right you're not able to withhold food
[59:02] from them for four days
[59:05] don't threaten to do that now i've
[59:07] threatened to make their life miserable
[59:09] but then i leave it open-ended i can
[59:10] choose whichever
[59:12] whichever method i want to make life
[59:14] miserable
[59:16] so you have to make sure as a parent
[59:18] especially with toddlers
[59:20] that you're always in control and the
[59:23] toddler is
[59:23] never in control i've seen parents
[59:27] you've been who's been in a grocery
[59:30] store you've seen
[59:32] parents who give the control to the
[59:35] child
[59:38] an argument breaks out in the cookie
[59:40] section i want oreos
[59:42] you can't have oreos okay put them in
[59:45] the bag put them in the bag just
[59:47] you be quiet who's in control
[59:53] sit down and be quiet sit down stay in
[59:55] the cart quick comments i told you to
[59:57] stay here take my phone
[1:00:00] here's a little game
[1:00:04] who's running the show the four-year-old
[1:00:07] is running the whole show the
[1:00:09] four-year-old through bad
[1:00:11] behavior and you guess what they're
[1:00:12] taught they're being reinforced every
[1:00:15] day
[1:00:16] that if i misbehave i get a reward
[1:00:19] if i scream and cry and embarrass my mom
[1:00:22] i get oreos
[1:00:24] if i won't stay in the car but i keep
[1:00:26] climbing out i get to play the phone
[1:00:32] you think you're crafty that
[1:00:34] four-year-old's got you outsmarted
[1:00:37] they're way craftier you're using
[1:00:40] intellect and reasoning they're going on
[1:00:41] raw
[1:00:42] beast instincts
[1:00:48] you're not going to out reason them
[1:00:50] they're working by instincts feed the
[1:00:52] flesh feed the flesh feed the flesh
[1:00:54] and you're trying to use reasoning and
[1:00:55] mental manipulation to control them
[1:00:58] it's not going to work don't ever let
[1:01:01] the toddler be in control
[1:01:03] you always be in control and sometimes
[1:01:06] when you're in public
[1:01:07] i mean chastisement doesn't always work
[1:01:09] in public you know what i mean
[1:01:12] you might have people asking you
[1:01:13] questions you don't want to answer
[1:01:16] so always be the adult and always be the
[1:01:19] parent
[1:01:20] and there's sometimes you've got to make
[1:01:21] a compromise in public
[1:01:25] but you say because i'm your parent
[1:01:28] i decided to let you do this this one
[1:01:30] time
[1:01:32] i'm going to allow this right now
[1:01:37] who's in charge sometimes
[1:01:41] you can't whack them right there it's
[1:01:44] not going to work
[1:01:48] but you've got to stay in control and
[1:01:51] there's sometimes
[1:01:53] that it is worth leaving a grocery cart
[1:01:56] full of groceries to take a trip to the
[1:01:58] van
[1:02:01] because you're looking at the future
[1:02:03] because you don't want another trip like
[1:02:05] this
[1:02:06] because i'm going to go through the
[1:02:08] grocery store
[1:02:10] and i'm going to get the groceries i
[1:02:11] want and i'm going to take as long as i
[1:02:13] need to
[1:02:14] and you're going to sit in the seat and
[1:02:16] you're going to behave yourself
[1:02:20] is that i mean is that beyond
[1:02:22] expectation for a toddler
[1:02:24] they should be able to sit in that seat
[1:02:26] and obey and listen
[1:02:28] i remember angie used to go to the
[1:02:30] grocery store with all five of them
[1:02:33] one in the car oh and they had rules i
[1:02:35] mean there's rules you don't touch
[1:02:36] anything you're not good
[1:02:37] you don't just touch it if you want to
[1:02:38] touch them you're asked to touch it you
[1:02:40] know like chaos you'd have the four
[1:02:41] toddlers running around
[1:02:43] grabbing anything that looked good to
[1:02:44] them and when they were real little they
[1:02:46] had to touch the cart
[1:02:48] so we were walking along everybody's got
[1:02:49] their hand on the car and we she'd walk
[1:02:51] by and people would just turn their
[1:02:52] heads
[1:02:56] like this is the most amazing thing i've
[1:02:58] ever seen in my life
[1:03:00] they're not running around they're not
[1:03:01] screaming they're not playing with their
[1:03:02] phone we didn't have smartphones then
[1:03:06] they're not getting their way
[1:03:08] everybody's walking doing what they're
[1:03:09] supposed to do
[1:03:10] when they got older and then she used to
[1:03:12] go down to the list and she'd be like
[1:03:13] you go over there and get that you go
[1:03:15] over get that and they're going to fetch
[1:03:16] and stuff and bring it back to the cart
[1:03:18] and get the next assignment and go and
[1:03:19] fetch it bring it back to the cart
[1:03:23] some mothers have to get a babysitter to
[1:03:26] go to the grocery store
[1:03:29] i mean that's okay if you've got like
[1:03:31] triplets
[1:03:33] that are infants but if you've got young
[1:03:35] children
[1:03:36] you shouldn't need a babysitter to go to
[1:03:38] the grocery store you should be able to
[1:03:39] train your children and take them to the
[1:03:40] grocery store
[1:03:43] you should be able to sit in a
[1:03:44] restaurant and eat a meal
[1:03:49] and the toddler should sit in the
[1:03:50] booster seat the other little ones that
[1:03:52] sit around
[1:03:54] and they should be able to sit there and
[1:03:56] enjoy a meal
[1:03:59] how many times have you been stopped
[1:04:02] in a restaurant and somebody says i just
[1:04:04] really appreciate
[1:04:06] how many times have you had a waitress
[1:04:07] say something to you raise your hand
[1:04:09] if you've had a waitress say something
[1:04:10] to you your kids are so good how do they
[1:04:12] sit here
[1:04:14] like you know they've never seen it and
[1:04:15] they've probably never seen it
[1:04:19] because the world has lost god's concept
[1:04:22] the world
[1:04:22] has so lost the image of god they have
[1:04:25] no understanding of what god's
[1:04:26] like no understanding of god's
[1:04:28] righteousness and that when they see it
[1:04:30] displayed they know it's right but they
[1:04:31] don't know where it comes from
[1:04:34] how many of you have unbelieving family
[1:04:37] yes sir and their kids are wild at
[1:04:39] family gatherings but yours aren't
[1:04:41] and your unbelieving family will say
[1:04:44] you're so lucky
[1:04:48] i love that statement yep it was just by
[1:04:51] chance
[1:04:52] thank god it worked out
[1:04:58] you have people who hate the message and
[1:05:00] hate this word
[1:05:01] but they love the results
[1:05:04] they love what it produces in the family
[1:05:07] and they'll say over and over your kids
[1:05:08] are so good
[1:05:09] you're so proud of you you guys have
[1:05:10] done a good job raising your you and
[1:05:12] your
[1:05:12] your husband your wife you love one
[1:05:13] another and blah blah blah blah blah
[1:05:15] but they but the minute you say well
[1:05:17] it's because of brother brandon
[1:05:19] he's a false prophet and that doesn't
[1:05:21] work
[1:05:23] you enjoy the fruit but you hate the
[1:05:25] tree
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:28] you know it doesn't work but this
[1:05:31] message should produce those kind of
[1:05:33] results
[1:05:34] that's the fruit people can see when you
[1:05:37] sit at a restaurant and eat
[1:05:38] when you go to the grocery store when
[1:05:40] your children aren't running around the
[1:05:42] parking lot and everybody else is
[1:05:43] worried they're going to get run over
[1:05:47] when your children listen when they do
[1:05:48] what you tell them to do when they
[1:05:50] when they obey when they naturally fall
[1:05:52] in line because you've been through the
[1:05:54] seals
[1:05:55] if they've had a trumpet they've had a
[1:05:56] plague poured out and they're not
[1:05:58] willing to go there again
[1:06:01] they're not in danger they're not
[1:06:04] irritating other people
[1:06:08] you know have you ever sat next to the
[1:06:11] kid who's swinging from the chandelier
[1:06:13] at a restaurant
[1:06:15] on the table screaming complaining never
[1:06:17] happy parents giving them
[1:06:18] and bought them special food they don't
[1:06:20] like that giving them their food and
[1:06:21] trying to get them an ice cream quick
[1:06:23] hurry hurry get them an ice cream i
[1:06:24] can't control this child
[1:06:30] are you ever interested in talking to
[1:06:32] that kid
[1:06:34] no way i've leaned over to my children
[1:06:38] before and seen one like that i said
[1:06:39] what do you think we should go over and
[1:06:40] spank him for him
[1:06:42] help that mother out show her what to do
[1:06:47] but you can't enjoy a child like that
[1:06:50] i may have had your children out and and
[1:06:53] it's usually the old people
[1:06:55] they always talk to them
[1:06:59] they want to talk to them why
[1:07:02] because you like kids that are
[1:07:04] well-behaved
[1:07:05] well-mannered in line they're likable
[1:07:08] kids you want to talk to them you want
[1:07:09] to be around them
[1:07:10] you want to spend time with them but the
[1:07:13] brats nobody wants
[1:07:16] nobody wants to be around them nobody
[1:07:18] wants to spend time with them
[1:07:20] and sometimes what we're doing is we're
[1:07:23] setting our children up for social
[1:07:24] problems
[1:07:26] because we're not doing child training
[1:07:29] we're setting them up for rejection
[1:07:32] we're setting them up for social
[1:07:33] problems because we're not doing the
[1:07:34] hard work of child training
[1:07:37] and it's hard work but you get a
[1:07:40] well-balanced
[1:07:41] well-behaved secure independent
[1:07:45] child out of the situation that people
[1:07:47] love to be around
[1:07:49] they're going to advance people are
[1:07:51] going to help them
[1:07:52] people are going to take time you know
[1:07:55] they're as they grow up and they become
[1:07:57] teenagers become young adults
[1:07:58] amen people are going to want to help
[1:08:00] them along people will put in a good
[1:08:02] word for them for a job
[1:08:03] people will help them advance people
[1:08:05] will help them in situations and give to
[1:08:07] them
[1:08:07] i've watched it in my own children i
[1:08:09] mean people pour stuff
[1:08:10] on them i look at them i said nobody
[1:08:13] ever gave me nothing people give you
[1:08:14] guys stuff all the time
[1:08:18] but i was a brat
[1:08:21] i was a latchkey kids parents were
[1:08:23] divorced raised by my mom
[1:08:25] she worked all the time and she was
[1:08:26] overworked and overstressed and me and
[1:08:28] my brother got away with things we
[1:08:29] shouldn't have gone away with
[1:08:31] i was a brat
[1:08:34] thank god for a conversion
[1:08:39] but i was determined not to raise my
[1:08:40] children the same way
[1:08:43] mom and dad together taking our time
[1:08:46] doing what we need to do
[1:08:48] but i've watched it work i've watched it
[1:08:50] pay huge dividends
[1:08:52] people will like your family and like
[1:08:55] your children
[1:08:56] why because the fruit is good fruit
[1:09:00] they don't have to know one thing about
[1:09:02] the bible but they know that's right
[1:09:04] they know what they see is right yes
[1:09:07] we've been in restaurants before
[1:09:09] waitress come up to me one time we were
[1:09:10] in a steak and shake
[1:09:12] and and a waitress come up to me and and
[1:09:16] it was time for the builder i don't
[1:09:17] remember how the conversation went ask
[1:09:18] for the bill and she goes
[1:09:19] no somebody already paid for your meal
[1:09:23] and that happened to us more than once
[1:09:26] people would come up to us and just give
[1:09:27] us a 20
[1:09:28] bill give us something to say we want to
[1:09:29] pay for your meal and they would say
[1:09:31] things like we like your family or
[1:09:33] you've got good kids or something like
[1:09:35] that so it pays
[1:09:46] sometimes you would know who it was
[1:09:48] sometimes you didn't know who it was
[1:09:49] but you know what a tremendous blessing
[1:09:51] what is it it's the gospel
[1:09:54] fleshed out and on display it's god's
[1:09:58] pattern for a family
[1:09:59] and people like it but they don't know
[1:10:00] what it is they like
[1:10:04] see this is the way that our family
[1:10:06] should be
[1:10:07] this is the way we should be raising our
[1:10:08] children mom should be home
[1:10:11] raising her children that's the pattern
[1:10:13] that's what the bible says that's the
[1:10:15] way god said
[1:10:16] mom should be spending her time taking
[1:10:18] care of her children raising your
[1:10:19] children
[1:10:20] dad and mom you can't child train
[1:10:23] toddlers on the road
[1:10:27] you can't be out of the house every
[1:10:29] night
[1:10:30] burning up the roads dragging them from
[1:10:32] pillar to post and train your children
[1:10:33] properly
[1:10:34] when you got little tots you're gonna
[1:10:36] have to shut down your social life and
[1:10:38] spend time
[1:10:39] at home with your children because child
[1:10:42] training
[1:10:43] primarily needs to take place at home
[1:10:46] there are times during a meal that you
[1:10:49] may swat that child
[1:10:50] four or five times during that meal to
[1:10:53] keep them from throwing their fork on
[1:10:54] the floor
[1:10:55] do you know why you do that at home
[1:10:57] because you can't do it at steak and
[1:10:59] shake
[1:11:01] what do you do at steak and shake pick
[1:11:03] up their four give them another four
[1:11:04] say sorry to the people on the table
[1:11:06] next apologize to the waitress
[1:11:10] and if you try to raise your children
[1:11:11] like that you'll never have them keep
[1:11:13] their fork on their plate
[1:11:15] you got to do that at home so as parents
[1:11:18] you've got to make a
[1:11:19] sacrifice we have to sacrifice our
[1:11:21] social life we have to sacrifice all
[1:11:24] our wants we've got you know what you
[1:11:26] know what toddlers need
[1:11:27] they need a good sleep sleep schedule
[1:11:30] they need a good eating schedule they
[1:11:33] need nutritious meals
[1:11:35] so because they're growing they get
[1:11:37] tired they're growing fast they need
[1:11:39] good food
[1:11:40] on time they need a good environment
[1:11:43] and they need to be raised at home
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:48] you can't be busy and raise those
[1:11:51] toddlers
[1:11:52] you've got to shut down the social life
[1:11:54] and spend time at home
[1:11:56] that doesn't mean you don't ever get out
[1:11:58] you don't have to become permits
[1:12:00] but the majority of your title training
[1:12:01] will take you at home
[1:12:03] and if at home you went through the
[1:12:05] lesson of four swats
[1:12:06] five swaths during a meal guess what
[1:12:09] happens
[1:12:10] the next day it might be two the next
[1:12:12] day might be one then you might not have
[1:12:14] to do it then you can take them to
[1:12:15] grandma's house and grandma will say
[1:12:16] that's the sweetest little baby i've
[1:12:18] ever seen
[1:12:21] because you did your child training at
[1:12:23] home
[1:12:25] we've got to make sacrifices to do these
[1:12:27] things right
[1:12:29] can't be gone every night got to be at
[1:12:31] home mama's got to be at home
[1:12:33] daddy's got to come home it doesn't work
[1:12:36] if mama's at home doing all the work and
[1:12:37] daddy's playing around with hobbies all
[1:12:39] the time
[1:12:41] got to be at home it takes a mother and
[1:12:42] a father they got to spend time together
[1:12:44] the family needs to be together
[1:12:46] the family needs to be at home and as
[1:12:48] they get older then you can start
[1:12:50] venturing out more
[1:12:51] and as you go out it gets fun it's it's
[1:12:53] so much fun
[1:12:54] to take your kids places take them to
[1:12:56] the zoo take them to this take them to
[1:12:58] that
[1:12:58] because they walk where you tell them to
[1:13:00] walk they stand where you tell them to
[1:13:01] stand
[1:13:01] they come when you tell them to come
[1:13:03] they'll go that you you can go
[1:13:05] you can set boundaries you can go to a
[1:13:06] playground and say okay you guys can
[1:13:07] play on this you can go on that don't go
[1:13:09] outside of these and you can sit on a
[1:13:10] bench and watch them
[1:13:13] and they're not going to leave that
[1:13:14] they're going to play they're free
[1:13:15] they're having fun
[1:13:16] you're free you're having fun you're
[1:13:18] enjoying your children and everybody
[1:13:20] else is enjoying it too
[1:13:22] so you can go you can do things after
[1:13:25] you've done your training at home
[1:13:28] after they know that your word is true
[1:13:29] after they know that that you'll follow
[1:13:31] up on what you say
[1:13:33] after they know what's right and what's
[1:13:34] wrong in different situations then you
[1:13:36] can begin to go out
[1:13:37] and explore and have some adventures and
[1:13:40] really enjoy those children
[1:13:42] you've got to do the child training at
[1:13:44] home
[1:13:46] when it comes to chastisement you gotta
[1:13:48] have wisdom
[1:13:51] you gotta know there's times when mom
[1:13:54] will go out and have a busy day
[1:13:56] and it happens she's gotta hit some
[1:13:58] garage sales
[1:13:59] go to this store stop by somebody's
[1:14:01] house and and we're gonna go back late
[1:14:04] and the little tot has missed his nap
[1:14:08] hasn't eaten he's two hours late for his
[1:14:11] meal
[1:14:11] missed his nap what do you think that
[1:14:13] child's going to do
[1:14:15] what do you think they're going to do
[1:14:16] when you go to put them in the car seat
[1:14:20] arch their back as hard as they can
[1:14:22] scream at the top of their lungs
[1:14:23] face turn red arms failing
[1:14:27] the temptation is going to be to
[1:14:28] chastise that child
[1:14:30] but the problem is not that the child is
[1:14:32] rebellious
[1:14:33] his child is tired and hungry
[1:14:39] you got to use parent wisdom as parents
[1:14:41] you can't push your toddlers too far and
[1:14:43] expect their behavior to hold up
[1:14:45] they don't have the strength the
[1:14:47] fortitude the emotional maturity for
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:49] you gotta use wisdom
[1:14:53] they need a steady sleep schedule good
[1:14:55] nutritious meals on time
[1:14:57] they need the freedom that they have at
[1:14:58] home and once you establish that
[1:15:01] you can start go start going further
[1:15:05] praise god we ready for more
[1:15:08] chastisement
[1:15:11] here it comes
[1:15:14] proverbs 13 24 he that spareth his rod
[1:15:17] hateth his son
[1:15:18] but he that loveth him chasteneth him
[1:15:20] that be times
[1:15:22] that's many times so that not at bedtime
[1:15:27] sometimes it might happen at bedtime but
[1:15:29] this is many times
[1:15:30] so we're going to go through these
[1:15:32] scriptures and you're going to see that
[1:15:33] this the bible is really clear that
[1:15:37] that chastisement is is the rod the rod
[1:15:41] of correction
[1:15:42] now me myself this is just a personal
[1:15:44] note i always use the rod because the
[1:15:46] bible said rod
[1:15:48] so i'd always go to the hobby section of
[1:15:50] any store and get a little thin dowel
[1:15:51] rod
[1:15:52] when you're dealing with a two or three
[1:15:53] year old you can get a really really
[1:15:55] teeny down rod
[1:15:56] and as they get older you can up size
[1:16:01] and a real sign of growing up is to get
[1:16:03] a bigger spanking stick in our house
[1:16:06] the big kids got the big stick and the
[1:16:08] little kids got the little one
[1:16:11] but you the reason i like a rod is
[1:16:13] because the bible says rod
[1:16:16] and if there's any question i know why
[1:16:19] i'm doing what i'm doing and my kids
[1:16:20] know why i'm doing what i'm doing
[1:16:21] because the bible says wrong
[1:16:23] that doesn't make other forms wrong i'm
[1:16:24] not i'm not i'm not diminishing anything
[1:16:27] else
[1:16:27] brother branham said a a good old mammy
[1:16:29] a good old southern miami will take a
[1:16:30] barrel slat and wear out her girl
[1:16:34] so apparently a barrel slat's okay too
[1:16:37] but i just use the rod because because
[1:16:40] it's scripture
[1:16:42] proverbs 19 18 chasten my son while
[1:16:44] there is hope
[1:16:45] and let not thy soul spare for his
[1:16:48] crying
[1:16:52] these aren't the scriptures you read
[1:16:54] just before chastisement
[1:16:56] it makes each other sound like you're
[1:16:57] enjoying it but anyways
[1:16:59] chasten thy son while there is hope what
[1:17:02] do you mean
[1:17:03] wow they're little
[1:17:06] once they're looking you in the eye too
[1:17:09] late
[1:17:11] it's not going to work you got to catch
[1:17:13] them while they're little
[1:17:15] and i've heard this story told in child
[1:17:17] training i don't know where i heard it
[1:17:18] long ago
[1:17:19] but the story goes that a man was in a
[1:17:21] at a circus and he was walking by an
[1:17:22] african elephant
[1:17:23] and that african elephant was tied with
[1:17:25] a rope around
[1:17:27] its leg tied off to a pin drove in the
[1:17:29] ground
[1:17:30] and the man asked the elephant trainer
[1:17:32] says couldn't that big africa
[1:17:34] that big elephant break that rope or
[1:17:36] pull the pin out
[1:17:37] and he said easily he said well why
[1:17:40] doesn't he do it
[1:17:41] he said because when he was a baby he
[1:17:43] was tied by the same rope to the same
[1:17:45] pen
[1:17:46] and he pulled and he pulled and he
[1:17:47] pulled and he can never break the rope
[1:17:49] and he can never break the pin
[1:17:50] so he doesn't know that he can break the
[1:17:52] rope and he can pull out the pen
[1:17:55] chasing thy son while there is hope
[1:17:59] don't wait when they're two years old do
[1:18:02] this
[1:18:04] all the way through it's so much easier
[1:18:06] young you may feel like
[1:18:08] i mean i've had times i mean honestly
[1:18:10] i've had times when you're dealing with
[1:18:12] teeny little toddlers
[1:18:13] some of them are strong willed than
[1:18:15] others but i've had times when i'm like
[1:18:17] i cannot swap this child anymore today
[1:18:21] and you're not talking about a beating
[1:18:22] you're talking about a little rod with a
[1:18:24] little switch
[1:18:25] it stings it does no damage but i get to
[1:18:29] the point where
[1:18:29] five six seven times but guess what
[1:18:33] a week later you're not doing it
[1:18:37] you gotta stick with it until you get
[1:18:40] the desired results
[1:18:42] and it works what do we chastise for
[1:18:49] we chastise for rebellion if i could
[1:18:52] just
[1:18:52] make it as easy as possible we chastise
[1:18:54] for rebellion
[1:18:56] what is rebellion willful disobedience
[1:19:01] not forgetfulness not immaturity
[1:19:06] not because we're too tired or too
[1:19:08] hungry or sick
[1:19:11] see it takes some discernment as parents
[1:19:13] you have to know your child
[1:19:14] when your child starts to get sick
[1:19:16] sometimes
[1:19:18] my wife would always know before they
[1:19:20] actually broke out in the full-blown
[1:19:22] symptoms of fever and all this
[1:19:23] because of their behavior she says i
[1:19:25] think they're starting to feel bad
[1:19:27] she could probably do the same thing
[1:19:28] with me i don't know
[1:19:33] but you don't chase them if they're sick
[1:19:36] hungry
[1:19:37] tired or scared
[1:19:40] what are we chasing for we got to be
[1:19:42] really deliberate here when we're
[1:19:43] thinking
[1:19:44] because if we don't do this right we're
[1:19:45] going to create problems if you have a
[1:19:47] child who's frightening they're active
[1:19:48] because they're frightened and you spank
[1:19:50] them guess what you just did
[1:19:51] a whole lot of damage
[1:19:56] willful disobedience
[1:19:59] for rebellion willful disobedience
[1:20:04] when they know what they're supposed to
[1:20:06] do and they choose
[1:20:08] not to do it that's willful disobedience
[1:20:12] when they didn't know when they haven't
[1:20:13] been taught yet when they're not feeling
[1:20:15] well
[1:20:16] that's not willful disobedience but is
[1:20:18] when they're old enough to know
[1:20:19] no and what no means they're old enough
[1:20:21] to chastise
[1:20:25] amen chasing thy son while there is hope
[1:20:29] and let not thy soul spare for his
[1:20:31] crying
[1:20:34] that means don't say i just can't stand
[1:20:36] to hear him cry
[1:20:37] that's what that means proverbs 20 30
[1:20:41] the blueness of a womb cleanses the way
[1:20:44] evil so do stripes to inward parts of
[1:20:46] the belly
[1:20:48] it's not talking about your stomach it's
[1:20:49] talking about your emotions
[1:20:51] the blueness of a womb cleanses away
[1:20:54] evil
[1:20:55] so do stripes the inward parts of the
[1:20:58] belly
[1:21:00] brother baby says sometimes i scold and
[1:21:02] go back home and just think lord why did
[1:21:04] i do it for
[1:21:05] i'll give you a little secret i do the
[1:21:06] same thing in the back room all the time
[1:21:08] why did i say it
[1:21:09] why did i say it that way why did i say
[1:21:11] it that hard
[1:21:13] listen what else he says but it's
[1:21:16] because i love them
[1:21:19] if i have to scold my little boy for
[1:21:21] running out on the street
[1:21:22] he'll get killed if i don't get him off
[1:21:24] that street sometimes i have to whip him
[1:21:26] correct him
[1:21:27] say son stay off that street it's not
[1:21:28] because i don't love that child
[1:21:30] it's because i do love him that's the
[1:21:33] way god has to do us scold us and shake
[1:21:35] us and make us real true
[1:21:36] person that lets his child just do
[1:21:38] anything is not a good parent that's
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:40] there's too much of that in america
[1:21:42] today and we need that old-fashioned
[1:21:44] mothers
[1:21:45] in fact i'm going to read this quote to
[1:21:46] you because i really like it
[1:21:50] brother ben says in the lamb and the
[1:21:52] dove from 1960.
[1:21:53] they talk about juvenile delinquency
[1:21:55] it's parent delinquency
[1:21:56] what's the matter then talk about the
[1:21:58] literacy of a kentucky some of them old
[1:22:00] mammies out there
[1:22:01] let their daughter come in the way some
[1:22:02] of them women do five o'clock in the
[1:22:04] morning and messed up over their face
[1:22:06] and their hair pulled out like that
[1:22:08] she'd take a limb off a hickory tree and
[1:22:09] she'd take the rest of her clothes off
[1:22:11] of her
[1:22:13] this is the prophet of the age
[1:22:16] take the rest of the clothes off of her
[1:22:18] and hide wit and the hide with it
[1:22:22] then call that illiteracy god knows we
[1:22:24] need some more memories like that that's
[1:22:26] exactly right
[1:22:29] i think he was a proponent of spanking
[1:22:33] you can't be a christian and not be a
[1:22:35] proponent of spanking it's the
[1:22:38] scriptures
[1:22:40] testimony on the sea and if you had a
[1:22:43] little boy now think of it lady
[1:22:44] you then i scolded a while ago you
[1:22:46] sisters with bobbed hair and things if
[1:22:48] you had a little boy sitting out on the
[1:22:49] street
[1:22:50] and you said junior dear you had better
[1:22:51] come in dear it might be
[1:22:53] i don't know they'll probably drive
[1:22:54] around you you don't love that child
[1:22:56] that's right you will get out there and
[1:22:58] shut the height off of him or make him
[1:23:00] come in that's right
[1:23:01] you love him that's the way the gospel
[1:23:03] is god loves you
[1:23:05] and those that he loves he chastens and
[1:23:06] rebukes every child that comes to him
[1:23:09] if you can't stand chastisement you go
[1:23:11] away and get angry about it
[1:23:13] then you're illegitimate children you're
[1:23:15] not the children of god
[1:23:16] so just remember it's just the scripture
[1:23:20] now say it for a reason because the
[1:23:22] natural types the spiritual and the
[1:23:24] spiritual types are natural
[1:23:26] god loves us and he chastens us and he
[1:23:29] rebukes us so that we won't be lost in
[1:23:30] the world
[1:23:31] and he says it and and i'll read it
[1:23:33] again he chases and rebukes every child
[1:23:35] that comes to him if you can't stand
[1:23:37] chastisement and you go away and get
[1:23:40] angry about it
[1:23:41] then you're illegitimate children i just
[1:23:44] want to inject this
[1:23:46] how is god going to chastise you in this
[1:23:49] day
[1:23:50] he's going to do it through the pulpit
[1:23:54] and then when you get mad because the
[1:23:56] preacher is preaching on something that
[1:23:58] you don't want him touching on
[1:24:00] i'm telling you there's a problem with
[1:24:02] that
[1:24:03] that doesn't mean every preacher ever
[1:24:05] said everything's right about it
[1:24:07] we're not going to give a license that's
[1:24:08] just a blank check
[1:24:11] but when he's talking the scripture he's
[1:24:12] starting to spread spirit
[1:24:14] scriptural principles and he's anointed
[1:24:16] by the holy ghost and says what he says
[1:24:18] you better listen because that's how he
[1:24:20] chastises the church now
[1:24:22] brother branham said in 1955 to seal the
[1:24:25] antichrist
[1:24:26] he said if the pastor is a good solid
[1:24:27] gospel teacher
[1:24:29] that will hold his children down and
[1:24:30] give them a little protoplasmic
[1:24:32] stimulation when they need it
[1:24:34] that's right lay the gospel down and
[1:24:36] spank them right good with
[1:24:37] it
[1:24:41] spank them right good with it you'll
[1:24:42] find a good obedient church that's right
[1:24:45] where people can come and enjoy
[1:24:47] themselves in the gospel
[1:24:50] if he's a good preacher that'll stay on
[1:24:51] the word and stay in the word and say it
[1:24:53] that way and see that his church is
[1:24:55] operated truly by the holy spirit
[1:24:56] not get off on these isms as soon as
[1:24:58] they start something he'll snap it out
[1:25:00] like that
[1:25:01] that's what we need today is some more
[1:25:02] preachers like that
[1:25:04] amen and what we don't need is for
[1:25:07] people to get mad
[1:25:08] at the preacher because the preacher
[1:25:10] preached against their compromise
[1:25:14] or their complex what we need to say is
[1:25:18] lord if that's you chastising me
[1:25:20] i'm a son and you love me and i want to
[1:25:23] be corrected
[1:25:25] like i said that doesn't mean everything
[1:25:26] a preacher says is exactly right
[1:25:29] but but there's got to be enough
[1:25:30] discernment to know if he's preaching
[1:25:32] the word and he's preaching the
[1:25:34] scripture
[1:25:34] amen and he's showing what the prophet
[1:25:36] and he's anointed of the holy ghost and
[1:25:37] he's been right
[1:25:38] all along
[1:25:42] let's not start picking and choosing
[1:25:45] forget chastisement let's take it as
[1:25:47] sons
[1:25:51] god has a rod
[1:25:54] and god uses his rod
[1:25:59] there's a scripture in deuteronomy
[1:26:02] 21 let's go to deuteronomy 21 together
[1:26:16] i just can't get over that take the
[1:26:18] gospel and spank them real good with it
[1:26:21] i thought the gospel was only for love
[1:26:25] chastisement is love sometimes we don't
[1:26:29] understand what love is
[1:26:34] deuteronomy 21 and 18
[1:26:40] if a man have a stubborn and rebellious
[1:26:42] son which will not obey
[1:26:44] the voice of his father or the voice of
[1:26:46] his mother and that when they have
[1:26:48] chastened him will not hearken unto them
[1:26:50] then shall his father and his mother lay
[1:26:52] hold on him and bring him out into the
[1:26:54] elders of his city
[1:26:55] and unto the gate and to the gate of his
[1:26:58] place
[1:26:59] and they shall say unto the elders of
[1:27:01] the city this is our son is stubborn and
[1:27:03] rebellious he will not obey our voice he
[1:27:05] is a glutton and a drunkard
[1:27:07] and all the men of his city shall stone
[1:27:09] him with stones that he die
[1:27:11] so shalt thou put evil away from among
[1:27:13] you and all israel shall
[1:27:14] shall hear and fear
[1:27:19] is rebellion serious rebellion
[1:27:22] is serious in the eyes of god chasing
[1:27:25] your son while there's hope
[1:27:30] proverbs 22 15 foolishness is bound in
[1:27:33] the heart of a child but the rod of
[1:27:34] corrections shall drive it far from him
[1:27:38] they come into the world like this
[1:27:42] i know you don't believe that nathan and
[1:27:44] natalie
[1:27:47] they look so perfect but just give them
[1:27:49] some time
[1:27:50] that old fallen nature will manifest
[1:27:52] itself
[1:27:54] foolishness is bound in the heart of a
[1:27:56] child they come that way
[1:27:58] but the rod of corrections shall drive
[1:28:00] it far from him
[1:28:02] withhold not correction from the child
[1:28:04] for if thou beatest him with the rod
[1:28:06] he shall not die thou shalt beat him
[1:28:09] with the rod and shout deliver his soul
[1:28:12] from hell
[1:28:15] how many want to save your children
[1:28:19] how many want to deliver their
[1:28:20] children's soul from hell
[1:28:24] see when we go to applying the token
[1:28:28] this is part of token life this is
[1:28:31] part of applying the token and if we
[1:28:34] apply the token with faith that it will
[1:28:36] take an effect on our loved ones
[1:28:38] this is fulfilling the scripture this is
[1:28:41] applying
[1:28:42] the token with faith out of the work
[1:28:46] the rod and reproof give wisdom but a
[1:28:49] child left to himself bringeth his
[1:28:50] mother to shame
[1:28:52] that's the mama in the grocery store
[1:28:55] you're embarrassed for her
[1:28:58] it's a child left to himself now
[1:29:01] when you look at at spanking when we
[1:29:03] look at
[1:29:04] the rod of punishment around a rod of
[1:29:06] chastisement
[1:29:08] there's there's something that's
[1:29:09] important that i failed in before
[1:29:12] and god god really rebuked me for this
[1:29:15] i had a time where i was struggling with
[1:29:18] chastisement and i felt like i wasn't
[1:29:20] getting anywhere
[1:29:21] not with my own but with one of my
[1:29:25] family
[1:29:26] i felt like i wasn't getting anywhere
[1:29:28] and so
[1:29:29] i just said i'm not going to do this
[1:29:31] anymore it's not working
[1:29:35] and things got worse
[1:29:38] so one day i was in prayer i was on my
[1:29:40] knees
[1:29:41] and i was in prayer and i was praying i
[1:29:43] said god what should i do
[1:29:45] what do i do about this situation i
[1:29:46] don't know what to do
[1:29:48] and all of a sudden these scriptures i
[1:29:50] just gave you start flooding into my
[1:29:52] mind
[1:29:55] and i realized i had the whole thing
[1:29:57] wrong
[1:30:00] i had messed up chastisement
[1:30:04] because i was i
[1:30:07] was using the rod just to change
[1:30:10] behavior
[1:30:14] and when the behavior wasn't changing i
[1:30:16] lost
[1:30:17] faith in the rod
[1:30:20] but that's the wrong i'm going to say it
[1:30:22] this way that's the wrong reason for
[1:30:24] chastisement
[1:30:27] why do we chasten our children and why
[1:30:29] with the rod
[1:30:31] because god said to
[1:30:36] if it never changed behavior i would
[1:30:38] still do it
[1:30:40] because he said to and all of a sudden
[1:30:42] god smoked my heart and rebuked me and i
[1:30:44] repented right there kneeling at the
[1:30:46] couch and said god forgive me
[1:30:48] i left your word for human reasoning
[1:30:51] because i didn't see the results that i
[1:30:53] expected because i wasn't applying it
[1:30:55] by faith everything that's done
[1:30:59] must be done by faith
[1:31:04] that's why you don't have to spank
[1:31:07] harder
[1:31:08] and harder and harder and it turn into
[1:31:10] abuse to change behavior
[1:31:13] if you're doing that you don't have
[1:31:14] faith in the word of god
[1:31:16] that's how abuse gets started because
[1:31:19] you think this isn't working i have to
[1:31:20] apply
[1:31:21] more force and more force and it becomes
[1:31:23] abusive
[1:31:26] it's not about applying more force and
[1:31:28] more force
[1:31:29] and more force it's not the force that
[1:31:32] we have faith in
[1:31:33] it's the word of god that we believe
[1:31:37] now if we're going to apply the word we
[1:31:40] apply the word with faith
[1:31:41] if we apply the word for our salvation
[1:31:43] we do it by
[1:31:44] faith if we apply the word for our
[1:31:46] healing we do it by
[1:31:48] faith if we apply the word and
[1:31:50] chastisement we do it
[1:31:52] by faith and if you
[1:31:56] fulfill the word of god and believe the
[1:31:58] word of god because
[1:32:00] god said do this god is responsible to
[1:32:03] bring the results
[1:32:05] you don't have to apply more force you
[1:32:06] don't have to become abusive
[1:32:08] you don't have to lock your kids in a
[1:32:10] dungeon you don't have to become a
[1:32:13] tyrant
[1:32:13] you can go through seals trumpets vials
[1:32:16] you can apply chastisement according to
[1:32:18] the scriptures
[1:32:18] and you can rest in the fact that god
[1:32:21] will keep his word
[1:32:22] if he said amen apply the rod he shall
[1:32:25] not die
[1:32:26] they shall beat him with the rod and
[1:32:27] shall deliver his soul from hell
[1:32:29] you can rest that if i do what god said
[1:32:32] for me to do
[1:32:33] then god is responsible to make the word
[1:32:35] work
[1:32:37] and i failed because i was looking
[1:32:39] through reasoning and not by faith
[1:32:42] but by faith chastisement works
[1:32:46] but it's got to be done by faith you
[1:32:48] have to believe that this is right
[1:32:50] this is what god wants and that if i do
[1:32:52] this
[1:32:53] god will do what he promised to do that
[1:32:56] it will save my son
[1:32:59] save my daughter
[1:33:03] first samuel 15 23 for rebellion is as
[1:33:07] the sin of witchcraft
[1:33:08] and stubbornness is as iniquity in
[1:33:11] idolatry
[1:33:13] rebellion is bad
[1:33:17] stubbornness is bad
[1:33:23] proverbs 29 17 correct thy son and he
[1:33:27] shall give thee rest
[1:33:29] yea he shall give delight into unto thy
[1:33:32] soul
[1:33:34] how many believe that let's all stand
[1:33:38] musicians if you could come brother
[1:33:41] tommy if you could come
[1:33:45] whatever we do we have to do it by faith
[1:33:49] correct thy son and he shall give thy
[1:33:50] rest he shall give thy soul
[1:33:53] delight you know what you're going to
[1:33:55] have to do to see that result
[1:33:57] you're going to have to believe it
[1:34:00] everything we do we do by faith we
[1:34:02] chastise
[1:34:03] according to the word of god by faith we
[1:34:05] don't that's why
[1:34:07] if if we really catch the concept right
[1:34:09] that's why you don't have to chastise
[1:34:11] when you're angry
[1:34:14] because it's an act of faith you don't
[1:34:17] have to wait till your blood pressure is
[1:34:18] at a certain level
[1:34:20] before you finally get out the rod but
[1:34:23] we
[1:34:24] stay in control all the time and we go
[1:34:26] through seals
[1:34:28] trumpets vials in control
[1:34:31] according to the word of god when we
[1:34:33] move to chastity
[1:34:34] we do it by faith we're not angry we're
[1:34:36] not trying to use the force of the stick
[1:34:39] to change the behavior
[1:34:40] we're going to we're going to use the
[1:34:42] rod according to the word and let god
[1:34:43] change the behavior because we're doing
[1:34:45] this by faith
[1:34:46] we're doing it because god said to and
[1:34:48] if we do what god said to then we'll get
[1:34:50] the right results
[1:34:52] do we understand amen i hope that's
[1:34:55] helpful
[1:34:56] i hope that clears some things up
[1:34:59] remember the foundation that we build
[1:35:01] child training on is love always
[1:35:05] love if you can handle chastisement
[1:35:08] right
[1:35:09] after you chastise a child you should be
[1:35:12] able to love them
[1:35:14] and they should be able to love you they
[1:35:16] don't have to like the chastisement
[1:35:18] but they can still like you and you can
[1:35:21] still like them
[1:35:23] when everything's done according to the
[1:35:25] word
[1:35:26] and by faith amen let's bow our heads
[1:35:29] and pray
