amen thank you musicians if you guys would like to just take your Bibles now if we'll take our Bibles together and turn to Genesis 5 live so say I'm happy to be back again this morning we're going to continue on with the same thought of unveiling the amateur God's part three and uh just trust that God will just speak and have his way God bless you brother Mike and sister Carolyn it's certainly good to see you guys here amen it's a real privilege to have you back with us and to hear your testimony God is good and for all those who are visiting God bless you you're very welcome and we thank God that you're with us this morning amen as we look into to Genesis CH 5 let's just read the first two verses together this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created and God bless you as you have your seats this morning like I said we're going to continue on uh with the same thought but I'd just like to address one thing as we get started as many of you know that there was an assassination attempt yesterday on the life of former president Donald Trump and I don't know if you saw that in the news yet or not but I heard about it and I I verified that it was true and it was it was shocking absolutely shocking and um and it's a disappointing place that we're at not just in this country in the world it's a discouragement and a disappointment and it's wrong in every which way and um and when I looked at it what was really heartbreaking to me is that this sort of thing would happen and it's it's it's devastating but what began to really affect me was when I realized that it was one person in the crowd there that got killed by a stray bullet one person was killed two others were critically injured former president Donald Trump was injured as well and then the shooter was also killed and I thought what an absolute travesty and and and ironically I don't know if it's ironically but providentially I should say this was tied in very much with what I was studying uh for the last couple days and what was on my heart I actually was having a a bit of a struggle as normal and I normally have a struggle to get things lined up in my own understanding and try to catch the inspiration and line it out and say what was in my heart there was three things that were converging three different thoughts and and I was just uh uh dwelling on them and going back and forth and looking at quotes and scriptures and and I had come to a vein of thought and IID started to to to Really labor in that and when a news came and I and I looked at the report I think it was 11 11:30 last night when I actually looked it up and uh it hit me that this is so tied into to what is on my heart today to talk about not an assassination attempt but what I really would like to speak on is the creative power of the sons of God and and and really when we get down to it we want to talk about the power we have to create an atmosphere and when we think of man man that was made in God's image and we know there's a corruption that came into man through hybridization but nonetheless what God had begun in flesh had continued on and and brother Brenham makes some statements I'm going to read some quotes as we go along and start to maybe just share with you my thought as it develops um it says in uh the message from that time he said he's a great contractor before he ever had a human being on the earth he laid out the material like a Contractor Building A A A subdivision he was going to make man in his own image and give them the Earth to stay and they were lesser Gods than he was so God's desire was to have as we've talked about before to have H an earth inhabited with sons and daughters and he laid out the material for our bodies as he began to begin to form us out of the Dust of the earth and bring us into into life and a manifestation and and the original intent was that they would all be Sons and Daughters of God a reflection of God uh fleshing out reflecting the very life of their father on Earth and we know hybridization threw that off there was a corruption through the through the beguilement of the serpent with Eve and and there was a wrong seed sewn and an intermingling and it brought corruption to God's plan but nonetheless the traces are still in humanity and Brother venham Talks about that he says um if I could find it here yeah he says in the message the Messiah says now he's made in the image and likeness of God when God made him God give him some of his Spirit part of his life and he's in the likeness in the image of God therefore uh man in his in his natural condition the way we are now you can see that he's much more than an animal as they try to say we are because man in his Fallen estate yet being a fallen Son of God he still can better himself he has an intelligence he builds himself a better house living conditions He makes himself better travel conditions he can speed himself through the air now 1900 M hour in a jet plane or a rocket and he starts talking about going into space and the satellites and and and the man going into orbit and all the things that man's achieved and he says he's smart intelligent he's made up in the image and likeness of God and in him is light so he begins to show us that God had originally made man amen to to reflect his image to be in His image he put him in a body of Flesh upon the Earth to reflect God upon the Earth and and and he says you know brother's alluding to the fact that they believe in evolution where man just came as a higher form of evolved animal but he says man is so much different than animal he's different all together because he has a way in which to think and be creative and better himself and create he creates music and he creates art and I'm just talking about Fallen man not not the not the children of God but Fallen man he creates art he creates music uh he builds he constructs in him is in him is to be a a little Creator he wants to create things and build things and make things and invent things and better things and and we know the devil's gotten into that and he's manipulated it and used it to build his own kingdom and now we live in Satan's Eden where he's manipulated this ability and desire and man and bringing a wrong influence he's got man to achieve for his own glorification he's got man to make achievements for himself for pride and for or for pride and for greed and for all of these lust of the Flesh and he's used that and diverted all of that godlikeness that's in man to use it to build Satan's kingdom but yet it it doesn't change the fact that it's there that man is a Creator desires to create and better himself so he's not created in the same fashion as animals it's not a higher evolved State it's a different creation altogether we know in the hybridization it's it's actually been reduced Amen in power and authority but but God is trying to bring that back and so he was made to be a Lesser God upon the Earth and we read this quote before I'd like to read it again referring to the sons of God it says let me before we go any further go back Genesis 1:26 I'll pick it up Wednesday uh before he made man he called himself El Ella Elohim the word means in the Hebrew the self-existent all by himself nothing exists before him he was all the existence there ever was self-existence one Ella Elohim means the alls sufficient all powerful allmighty self-existent one but in Genesis 2 when he made man he he said I am Yahweh Jehovah what did he mean I am the all existent one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur little one of mine Oh Glory Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is a father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family amen Ella uh Elohim now he's Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had a dominion and he Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his Dominion he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so oh there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family his little ones there you are so there was God's intention and as God began to bring his family into Redemption he begins to reveal more of himself and his nature to man and he he brings a name to moses' understanding and that's the name of Jehovah amen and Jehovah is the self-existent one who begins to reveal himself and he reveals himself as a as a God who wants to have a family as a as a Creator who created man after his own image and because his intention was to have a family a god a god race a God's children God's family upon the Earth so now we live in we live in the remnants of that that's been corrupted and polluted and now has been has been taken for 6,000 years in the way of corruption and and degr ation but using the things that God put in man man has a self-will man has an in intellect he has an ability of self-determination he he has a creativity to him and a desire to grow and to create and to achieve and all of these things are there amen because they were they were found in God in some way or fashion and now they're they're here but they're in a perverted form amen and that's what that's what's being manipulated today but I don't want any of those things in me to be manipulated I want God to take control I want God to have absolute control and sway over me and move me and all of the attributes he placed in me and bring about his desired plan he says uh in Blasphemous names but God specially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God he was god of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday the sons of God will again become Gods man lost his right to Dominion to rulership to to godship he lost that amen when he gave up the title deed of redemption he gave up by leaving the word he lost his position amen but God has redeemed it back he's taken back the title deed book amen and he's brought it back into man and and someday we're going to see the fullness of that and we're going to move into a millennial Reign amen which is an Eden restored when the Son of God and his bride will once again Rule and Reign Over the entire Earth they will once again be Gods upon the Earth but we're in the stage now where God is bringing back back he's redeeming it he's bringing it back to full measure and here we stand in this position in the message why he says a man was made to be God to be a god do you know that he's in the image of God he's a Son of God he's like him he was given a domain Genesis 1:26 dominion over the whole earth that's right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God made like God had hands and feet like God he was in the image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's word it sent him right back to shift for himself now God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then you begin to become a Son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you what's he doing he sent his Spirit what to rebuild us to bring us back to bring his kingdom back to bring us back to Sons and Daughters of God Amen we've seen this displayed uh uh we we know where we are in the Redemption cycle because God sent a prophet in this day to begin to unlock and understand we know that there's a lamb that's paid the price of redemption we know that he's taken the book the title deed of redemption amen we know that he's loosed the seals to reveal the Plan of Redemption to the man to bring back Sons and Daughters of God from their fallen State amen and we've seen God take one man under his control a prophet Amen in the name of William brandom and he took him and he displayed what Redemption had purchased back amen there was a man now by the direction of God could speak and when he speak it had creative power it would create squirrels into existence he said from nothing not a reforming or REM a materialization from nothing amen this is creative power that God had it was now back in the hands of man and under the direction of God he could also speak to Nature we talked about this at the storm in Colorado when he could speak to the storm to go away and the sun to come out and and all of these things begin to happen amen he's showing that that Redemption has brought man back the title deed is back amen the title deed did not need to go back to God God was holding it he was the originator of it he's the one who created it to give to man it belonged to man he wanted man to have it so man lost it so God came down as a man so he could take it back for man because God wanted this title deed to be Gods upon the Earth he wanted it in the hands of man who were his children so he came as a man to purchase it back that's why he was the last Adam to redeem all that Adam lost but it's been in obscurity and he's been doing a Redemption work but now in the end time he brings us back to the fullness of redemption and this fullness of redemption will bring us right into the Eden condition once again amen and we're right here at the cusp of it and at the cusp God shows amen this Redemption title deed book is back there's a man on Earth that can direct nature that can speak things into existence amen that that listen I I I'm telling you this is a hard statement but I don't know how else to say it but by the authority that God put in that man that man could give a widow whatever she desired and she desired salvation for who do children he said I give them to you in the name of Jesus [Music] Christ I I don't don't ask me to understand that I don't understand it but I believe it with all of my heart that he he was given Authority amen under the hand of God and he says I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ cuz God told him you give her whatever she asked for and when she asked for he gave it to her so she got the salvation of her two sons why because God had restored he was restoring a title deed book he was bringing man back into position amen and and you know I don't want to take those things lightly or trivially like I don't want to take that as all of a sudden you know well that's restored back I'm going to do this I'm you're not going to do anything right in yourself brother B didn't do anything in himself it was God who had a man under control he had a prisoner in his hand somebody that he could entrust to speak knowing that he would speak the right thing and in fact it wasn't just brother benamy could trust he had a little widow woman on the earth at the same time that he could trust because she could ask for anything she wanted but God entrusted the power to ask for anything into somebody who he knew had a right heart would ask for the most important thing which is salvation for her two boys so this isn't something we just chance at and try at and stab at it's not that it's not that kind of a thing friends this is sure and absolute and powerful and and it's the plan of God of redemption and it's God's desire to bring back his children so he was demonstrating these things to us he gave him the author authority to to to stand he T him to stand on his feet he gave him the authority Amen to speak uh healing to his wife and the tumor that she had he spoke to it he spoke about it and it happened exactly the way he said why God had a prisoner God had a redeemed Son of God one that had come to a place in maturity and growth through the hard knocks of life and the trials and and all of these things he had come to a place where God could entrust the power of the spoken word into his hands and I thank God for that demonstration because if God can do it there he can do it here if he can get a man in the same condition amen and if he's got a purpose to accomplish God can accomplish that in you and I but but with all of that I I want to just take some time and look at the fact that God has never stripped from us the power to be little creators you thinking mankind look he's a little Creator and we know he's not creating something out of nothing what he's doing is taking what God created and he's refashioning and remolding it according to his own desire and his own Vision but but man is a little Creator but God has called us as Sons and Daughters of God to be little creators as well and that's what I want to look at in creating an atmosphere he says and the message here he says did you ever see people who you love to be around just love to be around them because they create an atmosphere a Heavenly and you like to be around them others seem to be good people but you just I have to get away once in a while you know what I mean and yet they seem to be good people it's not creative this is interesting what he's saying a man was made to be a God you know that Genesis 26 and he had dominion over the whole earth and he was made to be an amateur God and now when he receives God he becomes a Son of God he was made in the image of God God had H hands God had feet and so therefore a man was made like him so he is an amateur God now brother Bram ties this together with a man creating an atmosphere around him and some have a certain atmosphere and some have another atmosphere he said one's creative created the right kind of atmosphere but there was another type of person that he just had to get away from couldn't be around he said you know what I mean it's not creative it's not it's not I don't want to correct the prophet but it's not saying it's not creative but it's not creating the right atmosphere it is creative but it's creating the wrong kind of creation amen and so he says in the message hear ye him and it's come down home to the Pentecostals acting and dressing fashioning looking talking blaspheming making fun indifferent that's rough but it's good for you it's the truth but that's the the reason the world can't see nothing genuine when people come to a place that they'll forget all their little differences and the love of God will shed abroad in their hearts by the real teacher the Holy Ghost you'll become salty and the world will want to be like you you create a creation around you you've seen people you couldn't stand to be around yet they were nice people they created that within themselves so this is what I was referring to brother B said there's people nice people you couldn't stand to be around yet they were nice people amen they create that within themselves so that means man is still a little Creator right and we're creating the atmosphere that's around us and and you've SE uh he goes on he says you've seen people you love to be with because they create that atmosphere around them your spirit your soul you can't hide it you can't make believe so brother say they're seemingly nice and maybe the talk is right maybe they the all the religious rhetoric is right maybe the speech is correct and and all of that looks right but there's something that that you just can't connect with there's another atmosphere there amen and who created that atmosphere we're creators ourselves we create an atmosphere around us I think this is really important uh uh as we move forward we're you know we're coming to the place of adoption this is the adoption age and adoption is completion Enoch we preached about on Wednesday he came to adoption he was the seventh from Adam seventh means completion so he had come to a place of adoption with a revelation of the word of God and a relationship with God that was changing him and and and and and he became the reflection of the word for his day he was moving into red uh adoption to the fullness of adoption for that age he was the type the foreshadow of what we're doing in our day and as we come into adoption we come into a place where where we begin to be like our father that's what adoption is we we've talked about it many times but when brother bam talks about adoption Through the Bible the way he he explains and teaches it to us he said a son is a son he's born a son he's born of his father he's a son right then but God is going to bring him into adoption where he can bring him to a place where he has power and authority and he's just almost equal to his father this is the way brother bam teaches us and he says now uh uh he puts him under good tutors and then a Christian gets under the tutor of the Holy Ghost but a man will greet good tutors and that that tutor will bring lessons and instruction and teaching and all kinds of things uh to this young boy as he's coming up to adoption so that the father can give the inheritance over to his hand so he can entrust him amen and so as he's building up there's all kinds of test and brother bam starts to he he speaks about this so many places and so many different ways but he he says the uh uh he says can you imagine the tutor coming to the father and saying your son won't listen to anything I tell him he won't heed your words and and he's not diligent in this and he won't do this and he won't do that and and he has to bring an evil report amen but how good it is to hear when the father can hear the report from the tutor he says oh he's just like you you should have seen the other day the way he handled the Sheep he did it just the way you would do it amen that's what adoption is bringing us into to where we have this this growth this maturity and then we begin to reflect the Father the father is now reflected in the son and coming to a place where the father can trust the son now we've seen this Amen in the prophet of God in this day we've seen God do this and listen I I I want to also uh uh if I could share my heart this way we've seen this on display we've absolutely seen God take a human being and give him the authority and power to speak what he would say and what he would say would absolutely come to pass and materialize amen this is this is absolutely fantastic power it's unbelievable when you really think about it amen and God had had if you look at brother brenham's life and the difficulties and the struggles and the rejection and the growth and and God was growing him and training him through all of that to get a place where he had a son that he could UST but even after God could trust him with these things it didn't mean brother renam was no longer a human being and didn't make mistakes he would even come and confess it he would be corrected in the pull Pit by God he would go to say something and he and he and he said something too sharp about an individual oh how I'd like to take the word and just tie this brother and NS and immediately the Holy Ghost checked him and said I shouldn't have said it that way that wasn't right I should have phrased it this other way amen so here you have a son that's under control he's still in a sticky culber nature he still I mean he still has his own ways about him he can still make a misstep amen but he's under the control of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost can bring him to correction and he can come back and be corrected and yield and surrender and submit so I don't want us to look at this and say uh uh you know well I still make mistakes brother bam still made mistakes that's right I don't want to come to this place where we kick everything way down the road and say well no today is the day today is the day and as we come through adoption there's a there's an adoption age we're in adoption age where the church comes into an adoption but we are individuals going through the same process individually just because the whole Church agees moved into adoption doesn't mean you automatically get there you got to go through your own process of birth and growth and positional placing and ups and downs and lessons and teachings and chastisements and praise you got to go through all of that so we we're all still in that Journey but as we go we if we move in if I could if we move into this as we move into this place we should be growing in his likeness day by day more and more moving higher and higher that's the whole point of the process that's right and and we talk about creative power uh we talk about the power of the spoken word and the manifestation of the spoken word the manifestation of the third pool as brother B spoke to squirrel spoke to storm spoke to uh uh uh the uh his wife's tumor these things the power of the spoken word and we look at that as creative power and it was creative power but don't wait to get there to exercise creative power because God has already placed in our hands creative power we have the power to create an atmosphere around us and if we're not taking the proper dominion and control of this creative power why would he put in our hands other creative power amen you know I I I'm going to make a statement because I believe it I'm thankful God has not placed in my hands the power of the spoken word and creative power CU I don't know that I had the character to handle it I'm glad he hasn't done it till now and I don't even know that I have it now you realize it's so dangerous that power is so dangerous that it takes character remember power without character is satanic but Power with characters fit to rule so God is working on our character but he's given to us Dominion he's given to us certain Authority certain Dominion he's given to us the power of free choice he's given to us in some ways listen we we man is like God upon the Earth because he has the power of choice man can choose animal acts by Instinct you think animal has choice but he's moving by Instinct man can reason man can man can can sit back back and reflect and look at things and he can make a choice and those choices have consequences and God allows that whole cause and effect to work out for our education but the the point of the matter is that God has placed in our hands free choice we don't just act by Instinct because if we just acted by Instinct none of us would follow the word of God cuz we were born with the wrong Instinct but he gives us the Power of Choice to override the natural lustful fleshly Instinct and choose the word of God Amen that that is power that has been placed in your and our hands anden we need to exercise that power Faithfully if we want to come to another Power then we have the the the power to create an atmosphere and and let's exercise that power and create that atmosphere around us we also have the power over our tongues over what comes out of our mouth and we know that that's a a huge power and I think we underestimate the power that we have to speak amen and that should shouldn't be taken lightly and we're going to talk about that here in a little while but but let we've been given a dominion and and your Dominion we all have dominion we all have different positions and different authorities but when it all comes down to it to the basic fundamental basis principle you all have dominion over the flesh you dwell in you have the dominion over the thoughts you allow to entertain in your mind and brother M said you can't stop the thoughts from coming but don't let them build a don't let them Roost don't let them build a nest you take every thought captive to The Obedience of Christ so you have you have control over your mind you have control over your actions you have control over what you look at you have control over the atmosphere you create you have control over what you speak and God has given us a dominion and as as amateur Gods we need to take control over this and create the right atmosphere amen and that atmosphere will continue to grow those responsibilities will continue to move amen but we got to realize I I am in an adoption cycle that I'm being tested I'm being trained by the tutor I've been given more and more responsibility to come to a higher and a higher level because what does God want God wants an earth inhabited with sons and daughters of God he wants a millennial Reign where his son and his son's bride are giving back Dominion as Gods upon the Earth again and that's what he's growing me to that's what my everyday life is about that's right that's what my going to work is about that's what my getting sick is about that's what my little offenses are about that's what the rubs with my brothers and sisters are about that's what that's what my coworker deal is all about that's what that's what all of this is all about is teaching us to be Gods to be gods and take Dominion by the word amen to be gods and act out and flesh out the very nature of Our Father God to be amateur Gods right now amen not saying I'll be an amateur God when I want to be like God right now in this little Tabernacle God please help me to come into your image and display your attributes amen and follow your leading amen I think sometimes we try to overreach try to reach for because we know this is the age we know this is the time we know he once manifested sons of God but I wonder if we're not trampling over the very things that bring us into that position trying to get to something amen and leaving all the other things undone Amen in the message Awakening Jesus he says now in Jesus was God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and these people believe his testimony and them that did truly believe it could draw God's blessing from him and when they did so he said virtue went out from him virtue is strength in other words if we'd say it today he got weak when the people draw it off of him well if it worked that way in that human body it'll work in another human body sir yeah we saw that with brother Bon he would stand in the pulpit and they would draw virtue and the Visions would make him weak and I don't think he's talking only about his body either I think it can happen in your body amen amen I think it as Sons and Daughters of God that we've been restored by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the New Birth has brought us back into our birth as Sons and Daughters we're growing into his likeness there's virtue inside of us and that virtue can go out to others that's what creating the atmosphere is where people can come and draw virtue and Jesus had virtue in him that woman could draw from the prophet of God had virtue in him somebody could draw from and I want to have virtue inside of me that can affect somebody else's life that they can draw from what an amateur God being in their presence a representation of Jesus Christ on the earth God's bride and me standing here should have something for somebody else we should have something there should be a virtuous strength amen I I I don't believe God's called us Amen to barely be a Christian and to barely make it and to barely have a act together and barely I believe God's put inside he's restored the word to us he's brought us back to a true identification of who we are he has taught us he's instructed us he's displayed it through example so that we can come back to a place where we can be Sons and Daughters of God upon this Earth creating an atmosphere of Faith and Healing and love where there's virtue to be drawn from others that are around us and and brother says and we create our atmosphere around us each one of us listen it's not just sons of God remember the person that want to get away from they created an atmosphere themselves so man has a an ability to create create this atmosphere but as Sons and Daughters of God we are supercharged by the spirit of God and been restored by the word of God we've got something to line too we've got something to empower amen our desire because we know what pleases him we know what he wants and he's got his spirit of God is here to back up his word and bring it to pass in our lives now it's not our human effort anymore now it's a a yielding to him and him coming in and empowering us there should be virtue in US amen and we create around our at uh our atmosphere around us each one of us you've been with people that were nice people but you just couldn't hardly be around them then you've been with other people that you just love to be around them you create that atmosphere and oh wouldn't you love to have been around Jesus just a little wonderful see what the atmosphere he created would have been I imagine it was just one great big bundle of love and respect and godly fear you know Jesus was accused of a lot of things of being beb and and having a devil and the but these were religious leaders who hated him for the truth that he spoke but Jesus had a good atmosphere around him a good atmosphere so much so that the mothers wanted to bring their little children to Jesus and the it in no way in the scripture do we get the idea that these children were afraid of Jesus that they were recoiling when they come into His presence that that that he says he took them up in his arms amen and he blessed them the whole imagery we have is an atmosphere that these children are comfortable in the the the picture that's portrayed remember the Bible condenses his truth it doesn't go and explain everything but the the fact that mothers wanted to bring their children uh to him to be blessed amen and and the disciples you know they had their own high fluting ideas and they were missing the whole point and they were trying to to to hold them back but he says they suffer the little children to come unto me for such is the Kingdom of Heaven and the mothers brought them and he took them in their arms and he blessed them amen and it and it shows me that there was a good atmosphere around Jesus that even the little children were comfortable coming to him and climbing up in his arms and being held by the Lord Jesus and being blessed and the mothers wanted their children in this atmosphere see Jesus sometimes I don't know how to say things good but I'll just say the way it's coming to me Jesus was not a religious nut am who was so spiritual nobody liked to be around him you see what I'm saying that wasn't the atmosphere around Jesus that wasn't the atmosphere around brother brandham the unbelievers like to be around brother Brandon he had a hunting buddy who was Snake Eyes the cruelest hearted man he had ever known I mean listen I I don't want a hunting buddy who Snake Eyes is the cruelest man I've ever been but brother brandham had a hunting buddy and that buddy Amen lik to be around brother brandham and brother Bram said he was the crul cruel cruel heartest man I ever know but he was a good Hunter I mean at least he had something nice to say about him the the people in the neighborhood the little children the neighbors they like to be around brother brandham I love I so thankful God sent an example is my is as religious as we've ever tried to be and super spiritual none of us can hold a candle to the life of that prophet in his spirituality and the supernatural in his life none of us the most spiritual of us all are a fraction of what God had done in that man but in that man he was common he had an atmosphere around him it was good it was pleasant he could be friendly friends could talk to him he could have conversations I mean he he had people who would come to him for prayer who never believed that he was a prophet or believ the message that he preached anyways and who would never come to the message but they would come to him for pray because they had confidence in him because they knew the atmosphere around him was right see if if we if we in our religious Zeal and our super spirituality create a negative atmosphere around us that pushed people away where people don't want to be near us and people don't want to be our friend and and no coworker at work wants to talk to us and and nobody will sit with us at lunch because all they get is condemnation and criticism and the Bible and and scriptures lacing them slicing them the bits and pieces and leaving them brother BR wasn't like that when he talked to somebody he would drop a little seed and if it went nowhere he didn't push it and he wouldn't run away and never talk to them and say they had their chance I'll never talk to them again he wasn't a religious nut although he was accused of all kinds of things along those lines just like Jesus was but the little children weren't afraid of brother Brandon you see what I'm saying I I hope this is coming across there should be sons of God upon the Earth not weirdos and zealous nuts that people don't want to get around that's not what the children of God should be and you realize if you take a stand for the word there's going to be people who hate you and people who don't want to be around you but that's for religious regions that's for there's there's evil spirits and religious spirits and they'll hate you and they won't like you and they won't want to be around you you can't do a blessed thing about that because that's that spirit in them hating the spirit that's in you but that's somebody giving over to a religious spirit amen and we're giving over to the Holy Spirit those two will never merge together amen but there's people caught in the crossfire amen there should be virtue in us we should create an atmosphere there should be a created atmosphere whatever was in Jesus should be in US amen we're not in full measure you know we don't believe that but in a portion and I believe if I had a portion of what was in Christ that would be a good portion amen a little drop would be great amen I would take it and love it and relish it I want to reflect amen what's been reflected to us in this day I want to reflect back amen and and so I I wanted to create around me an atmosphere like brother Benham said there must have been a wonderful atmosphere around Jesus he says I imagine it was one great big bundle of love and respect and godly fear amen it's amazing Jesus never railed against the Romans he never entered into Political rhetoric and he never was hateful and he but he said some really hard things he told a group of people one day that they're of their father the devil so I I I'm I when I talk about this atmosphere I'm not talking about an atmosphere that's a pushover and will never stand for truth and never will speak what's right brother brandham wasn't that way either he would preach some hard things he would preach against the Pentecostal women who were moving away from Holiness and morality and allowing cutting hair and wearing these clothes and and letting fashion slip and and he would say it he would say say it hard and he would say it straight but at the end he says now you know I didn't mean that in any way he says that's because I love you that I said that and if I didn't say it I wouldn't love you and somehow when you hear him say it you believe him you believe him because there's an atmosphere there's a life behind it so Jesus said although it was one great big bundle of love and respects and godly fear amen it wasn't like he was so so nice he couldn't be honest or he was so nice that he could no longer be a Son of God upon the Earth it's not about being nice it's about having the right atmosphere it's about creating a Godly atmosphere and and Jesus could I mean he could beat the money changers out of the temple I don't know what that atmosphere felt like I I don't know but do you realize what I'm saying there's things that you can't control there's things that you have to say there's stands that you have to take and there's people who won't like the atmosphere around you not because you have a bad atmosphere because it's contrary to the atmosphere they live in but what we don't want to do is create the wrong Atmosphere by our own creation we want to stay with the word and the nature of the word till it creates the right kind of atmosphere around us amen our neighbor neighbors should like us I believe you should be one of the favorite Neighbors on your block I mean not just because you don't play loud music and you don't have parties but that that that too I believe that our co-workers should want to be around us extended family members should like talking to us and and remember my disclaimer there's always those that will never like you no matter what you try to do they can't because of a religious spirit that's not what I that's the outlier you can't do anything about that but in general if people like to be around brother brandham if people like to be around Jesus they should like to be around us brother mam says in the invisible Union you're standing completely you never sin at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God may this understanding gives us freedom to become what we were always meant to be it takes the condemnation throws it away positionally places us and now we can move forward in the position God's put us in he said you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love what is Jesus that great attribute of God Called Love what should is redeemed Blood Washed restored virtuous bride be she should be just like him for she came out of him and she's here reflecting his life he's supposed to be here at the end time in Bride form in the formation of his bride so that great big attribute called love should be in Bride form amen he says in the spoken words Original Seed and a real seed of God is an absorbent for the spirit all denominationalism is took out all unbelief is out and when the Holy Spirit comes into that germ of life that's laying there it produces another seed just exactly another Son of God is born amen another amateur God Son of God so the seed of God laying in there's an absorbent to the spirit when the spirit comes in it's born again it produces what another seed another son another amateur God and as we absorb that Spirit it should bring life to the word that we're feeding on and it should bring that it should bring virtue and strength and love and respects and all the things that were in Christ should start to flow out of us amen God help us let's turn to First John together now I've got several scriptures I want to turn to so keep your Bibles handy or your notebooks you just jot them down if you don't have time to turn but I want to read through quite a few here 1 John 4 verse 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us God is love let's go to verse 16 and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him amen that's not hate that's not that's not con condemnation that's not contention that's not Strife that's love amen now Love sometimes says hard things sometimes love says straight things sometimes God says love is corrective but it's not critical it's not full of strife it's not malicious has no bitterness mixed in with it it's love let's go to verse 19 says we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he ha not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also so you should see there should be an atmosphere of Love Around The Believers love for one another but in general an atmosphere of love and we love him because he first loved us amen so that means that means when God loved he loved first before it was reciprocated is that right well what should amateur Gods be like what should am if we're to reflect if we're minor Gods if we're lesser Gods if we're amateur Gods trying to reflect the very nature of our father he loved us first and he gave himself for us amen before we ask for forgiveness before we apologize before we said we I love you he demonstrated his love by a sacrificing of himself for us amen is there is is there any capacity in us to love first to love those around us amen not in a reciprocating way but re just to love first that's what God did and besides that he he loved the whole world God so loved the whole world that He Sent His only begotten son amen love should emanate from the amateur Gods it's my opinion but I believe the word matches it love should emate from the amateur Gods when you know when we first start talking about the unveiling of the amateur Gods we start showing how uh faith in the word in your day begins to peel back and unveil who the amateur gods are that's the way it's always been and the ability to hear from God and walk with God but but when you begin to peel back and unveil the amateur Gods it should be an unveiling of the attributes of God that are in his people and mean we think of uh amateur gods and we we begin to think of the destination we begin to think of the goal and we begin to think of uh standing on the earth at some time and and and speaking to Nature to stop and and and to give rain to these crops and to withhold rain from this from this nation but but that's that's true that's what the the manifested son of Gods are going to sons of God are going to do amen but I don't believe that's the only thing they're going to do I believe manifested sons of God are going to be manifested sons of God and begin manifesting even now today manifest the the attributes of God the nature of God the character of God begin to create a character of godliness around us amen and and love all around us and the message why the prophet says if if we can't love one another how are we going to love God whom we haven't seen we must find the vein we've got to love one another though we different you got to love any you can't Bluff it you got to really do it you got to and that's the greatest power that that they found in healing is love when you have sympathy and love for the people trying to help them what brother B he had love and compassion for the people Jesus when he saw the multitudes fainting with Hunger he had compassion upon them amen that that that is something that's in the Son of God that is something that are in the sons of God Amen he says in this message Divine love now there's one there's only one thing the church has to do if you want somebody to come to Christ you be salty salty makes a thirst you be salty and the world will get thirsty that's right for in a man he is he is in one sense a miniature Creator if he's a child of God because the spirit of God is in him who controls him who operates him what's he talking about being a miniature Creator he's talking about being salty to the world being Christlike man creating the atmosphere and the message is is your life worthy of the Gospel he says and did you know you you you are a little Creator yourself you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just a kind they're you like to be around them they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation I love this this is what I want to begin to speak on now is the power of the spoken word they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation then You' seen those that every time you shun them all the time they want to talk about something evil or talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about a woman or something like that you just hate to get around them they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on and the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere I want the atmosphere of the word all around me so that means I need to think about the word I need to talk about the word I need to be in the realm and the atmosphere of the word that creates an atmosphere around me amen and brother B says in the most in the message token he's talking about the token now which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the life of God inside he says apply it and create that atmosphere around you and they'll just drop right into he's talking about the loved ones and the ones you desire to see save the ones that you're praying for they'll just drop right into it oh you are you if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it see that's it man how many of you will have people at work that even sometimes will laugh at you a little bit because of the stand you take or even family members they'll they'll be a little bit critical of your Holiness or the the fact that you know you're too religious or whatever it is amen but when they hit a crisis where do they come when sickness strikes their family when something's going wrong the very person that they they made a little bit of fun of they want to get over close to and ask you some questions and they want to say well what do you think about what's going on and and this or that and and and they want you to pray for them they want you to talk to them because they know that something in you is real and in the time of Crisis they know where it's at because they felt it you created the atmosphere around you sometimes we don't even know the effect that we're having on people by creating that atmosphere but when the time of Christ is hits sometimes you see amen how did they know where to come when they were sick how did they know where to come when their marriage was falling apart or when they had a son or daughter that was getting caught up in worldly things and running astray how did they know where to come and why are they talking to me about their personal problems why am I the workplace counselor anybody ever felt that way it's the atmosphere that's in you it's it's God that's dwelling in you it's the atmosphere you create it's the word it's the love it's something that's reaching out there's virtue that they can draw from there's a well there that they can tap into and in the time of Crisis they begin to realize amen when everything's well and they don't want to change and they don't like the conflict of The lust spirit with the the the holiness mean they may say away they may make little comments not nasty not mean but just a little bit oh I know you wouldn't go for that or I know you wouldn't go there but the minute they have a need they come right up to you and say Hey listen I got this and my wife and my son and this and that and the other and you're standing here like why are you telling me all of this listen I'll tell you why they're telling you all of that they need the god that's inside of you they need an amateur God right then on the earth they need some place to draw virtue from somebody that can give them something more than rhetoric something more than talking points something with substance a real life somebody that can say the word but more than say the word say I will pray for you if you if you believe this I can pray for you and God can move on your behalf those are amateur Gods on the Earth today amen let's turn to Proverbs together go to Proverbs chapter 18 Proverbs chapter 18 and let's look at verse 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof I want us to to catch that and we've heard it before but really grasp it death and life are in the power of the tongue and then that love it show eat the fruit thereof let's go back to Proverbs 15 if you turn with me back to Proverbs 15 verse 4 15 verse4 says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit it matters what we speak the atmosphere that's created around us is based on what we think on what we meditate on what we feed on and what we speak in our conversation and let's turn together to Matthew if you could with me like I said there's quite a few I want to read here right close together in the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 12 verse 34 Matthew chap 12 Matthew 12:34 oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things that means if you want to speak good things you must have a treasure of it already in your heart we must be feeding on good things dwelling meditating talking about good things so our heart is full of good things for a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned this is this is a heavy statement friends but God created man and he gave him a mouth placed him on Earth and one of the first things that we know of that Adam was doing was naming the creatures he was using his mouth to express something and the economy of God because he was catching the characteristics and Natures of the animal and he was positionally placing them by giving their name and he was taking dominion and how was he taking Dominion by his mouth brother B said he could say wind stop blowing tree be plucked up what was he doing he was commanding it by his mouth why because his father commanded creation by his mouth and creation moved to the spoken word of God and so now God put in the mouth of his son spoken word and that spoken word amen when Adam was on the earth speaking the Earth obeyed Adam amen and when Jesus was here speaking the Earth obeyed Jesus and when brother benam was speaking when God commissioned him to speak the Earth and creation and molecules and atoms and all kinds of things obeyed his voice God gave us a mouth amen and and and and and you know oh praise God what I'm going to go into now condemns every one of us so just fasten your seat belt me and included me Me Maybe me the most but God gave us a mouth to speak the word he gave us a mouth for healing he gave us a mouth for virtue he gave us a mouth for life he gave us a mouth for Creative power he didn't give us a mouth to tear down and to destroy that's not why sons of God have a mouth amen even Jesus came not to condemn the world but that through him the world might have life they were condemned already ready cuz they didn't believe his coming wasn't for condemnation his coming was for life but they were condemned cuz they didn't believe already even us speaking the word it will condemn some our life of our life of the word will condemn others but that's not why I'm here I'm not here for condemnation I believe I'm here for life I believe God's got a Son of God on the earth and I want to come to my position for life not for death for life not for condemnation for salvation and healing and restoration and so people around me have better lives amen I might not be able if there's no seed Gene of God on the inside I may not bring him to a revelation of the message only God can do that but if I can sew the word into their heart and they can have a better marriage and a better life and a better relationship with their kids and be better co-workers and have respect for the things of God and someday that respect and honor for a child of God and the word of God will bring them entrance into the kingdom of God I say God my existence meant something on this Earth but God did not give the children of God a mouth for condemnation he didn't give us a mouth for ridicule he didn't give us a mouth for Strife he didn't give us a mouth for bitterness he didn't give us a mouth for any of that he gave us a mouth for the creative power of God to be expressed in this earth and like I said we say Amen because it's absolutely the truth we know it's the truth but at the same time we say oh God forgive me forgive me Jesus said there'll be a judgment for Every Idle Word spoken I'm so glad that there's a blood of Jesus Christ that when I Repent of my foolishness and my childishness and my bitterness and my offenses and my hatred that God will forgive me of that because there's so many words that I wish had never come out of my mouth I've created wrong atmospheres I've created wrong responses I I have done damage because of what's come out of my mouth and I feel I feel as ashamed as a person can feel if it wasn't for for the blood of Jesus Christ I just go sell out live under a rock somewhere in the wilderness and not try to talk until the day of my Redemption because we're still in a sticky cauber nature and we still get it wrong all the time but I'm so glad there's a tutor here that'll bring correction when we get wrong let's go to James there's no way we can discuss this subject without looking at James James chapter 1 in James chapter 1 we'll begin reading at verse 26 If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but he but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pain bridleth I think most of us know what bridleth is but we may have some a bridal is like a halter with a bit that you put on a horse and you can use the bit on the horse's tongue and control the direction the horse moves by pressure on the tongue you can hold the horse back or you can steer him well it if we don't Bridle our tongue we're deceived and our religion is in vain that's what James says let's read it again If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain I don't want my religion to be vain but God give me the power to Bridle this tongue let's go to uh James chapter 3 James chapter 3 verse one says my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater cond uh condemnation for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which th though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and has been tamed of mankind but in the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison wherewith bless we God even the father and wherewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either of Vine figs or can or can no Fountain both yield as salt water and fresh that is a hard scripture that scripture ought to make me every day at the end of the day say God forgive me God forgive me friends we're moving to adoption each one of us amen and we've got to Bridle our tongues to come to adoption now we started off speaking about the tragedy that we've seen in the country yesterday but to me it just became an example of what happens the effect of words what we saw yesterday was the effect of words and those words created an atmosphere and that atmosphere is plaguing the nation it's an atmosphere of division of hatred of bitterness and fear and everybody involves guilty so you can't say that person's guilty or that person's guilty I mean it spreads far and wide and we've we've gotten into a a scene in the United States where there's no more respect for offices there's no respect for leadership there's no respect for police officers for school teachers for presidents for Governors there's no more respect there's no more just common respect you know even brother brandham he he said America made a horrible mistake when it voted in uh John F Kennedy because it was our first Catholic President and the nation was founded to get away from that kind of uh uh control of a Catholic church and he he disagreed but he never spoke evil to that man he says now he's a pretty good man he said he'll probably make a good president he never he never he he disagreed he thought it was a travesty it never should have happened in America but he never began to belittle that human being even disagreeing with him there's nothing wrong with disagreeing but the bitter belittling is the something the prophet did not did did not display to us neither did Jesus Christ when he was here we never saw that and so now the the mudsling that's taking place the the the mocking the bitterness the hatred the lies the the extreme statements and comments it's it's all got people worked up into a frenzy on both sides it's a frenzied state of excitement one that can create what we saw on on January 6th which was an absolute travesty the one that we saw yesterday which was an absolute travesty you've got a situation where a a young man who's 20 years old listen I know some of you are 20 and think you're smart but a 20-year-old don't know nothing he's a kid and he doesn't know nothing he has no life experience he has no understanding he's heard a bunch of rhetoric and hateful speech and somebody swed fear and hate into his heart over things he probably doesn't comprehend issues he probably is not well versed in things he doesn't understand and he can't sort out what's true and not true and that 20-year-old man will climb up on a building because of that and he'll try to assassinate a former president who's running for a presidency and so doing he'll mortally wound and kill innocent bystander and and and CR critically injure two others and he himself will lose his life over what over words words even when John F Kennedy was assassinated brother B had the whole church stand and pray pray for his family and pray for the nation you know it's the prophet of God who told us that America's finished she's done she had her chance in 56 she didn't repent he said I no longer pray for her downhill from here I believe that absolutely the truth and and we see it we see it manifesting right before our eyes America is disintegrating but brother B still said I'm I'm happy to be an American and I thank God that he's put me here am and I'm still thankful to be here Hey listen you could have Bor been born in LA or Vietnam I'm pretty thankful to be born as bad as it is I'm still thankful we can sit here and worship this way but there's no a America's done she's turned her back on God she is finished it's heartbreaking it doesn't bring us joy it's not pleasurable to say those things it's still the country we live in it's still our home it's still where we have to dwell until we get out of here and I'm so thankful God's painted another picture for us or we would be a pretty depressed people so we know the way it has to go but that that doesn't mean I need to join into the political Fray and start using a mouth that God wants to ordain to speak the word of God and start speaking hate speech and rhetoric and ridicule and mocking and it's not for me God forgive me for those things but that it's not for me it's not for a child of God that that's going to go the way it's going to go without our participation but there ought to be sons of God on the earth that sound a different sound not get swept up in all of these things and and talk like the world talks we should have a different sound all together we have a voice amen that resonates and we know the voice of God will be in the bride and the voice of God in the bride he wants to use the mouth of the Bride to proclaim the word to Proclaim love to Proclaim Liberty and healing and health and all of those things not to not to become talking points for news media broadcasters it's not what God gave us a mouth for and when I look at what happened in the nation it became such a visible such a a a visible display of the power of mankind to create this atmosphere in the country was created it was created by speech and conduct and actions on both sides it it's the power of man to create his own atmosphere what is the atmosphere that we have in America right now it's the atmosphere that the Americans have created who are you going to blame for the fighting and the strife and the hate who else is to blame the Americans themselves are to blame right you say what's the news media who's watching them how are they getting their money and who's repeating what they're hearing on the broadcast this is the power God says man will create his own hell and we can see he's doing it man will create his own hell because man was made a little Creator and now this whole atmosphere has been created by words said God that's I don't want to be any part of it but I want to be part of the sons of God on the earth that are here for something else but then I began to look at that and think that poor young man the other man who lost his life those who are critically injured their their families everybody who was there that day everybody who heard and the screams and the and the images or the memories that will be in their mind it's it's a horrible travesty and you think and it's always who's the blame who's the blame was there a let down in security was it the rhetoric of the news media was it the left was it the right was it social media was [Music] it you realize everybody's to blame and I thought about that rally I mean everybody's there for a political candidate they're all rallying they're all trying to support and they're and there's shots that ring out because of hate rhetoric and we're happy we're thankful that the former president Trump wasn't assassinated but somebody behind him one of his supporters is dead two of them are critically wounded and who's responsible for that and then it dawned on me he is he helped create that atmosphere he capitalized on the bitterness and the hate to gain support not all his fault there's a lot to blame then all of a sudden it hit me I come home when things happen in my home whose fault is it my church my realm of influence my job site yeah you always want to blame everybody else when something bad happens you remember Elisha after Elijah went up in a in a whirlwind and Elisha's walking up the road and these these children run out and began to make fun of him said go up go up thou Baldhead and he cursed them and two she bears come out of the woods and destroyed them amen it's a tragic story and and brother R said that wasn't the spirit of Christ and Elisha that was an angry prophet and everybody looks at Elisha and says that was terrible but brother Brenham tells us a backstory he says those children heard their parents mocking and criticizing mocking and criticizing Elisha amen and they were only out in public doing what was doing private what who's who's the blame it's not like Elisha's innocent because brother B said that was wrong that was an angry Prophet that wasn't the Spirit of Christ but those parents who want to throw stones at Elisha and how could he call the she Bears out really those kids would have never been there if your mouth had been used for the right thing amen that's why I said let's put our seat bels on because there's times that we hear things we I hear my children sometimes criticize people or say things and I think where did they get that that's so rough and kind to come down and be honest they've heard dad do it like God forgive me God forgive me that they would go say something to somebody that would curse them who's the blame if something bad happened to them I would blame that other person and be so mad and we realize my mouth was not given to me to be critical judgmental it wasn't for malice or Strife or bitterness or anger God gave me a mouth for life for creation for healing God help me to be an amateur God help me you say this is the rise of the imate your Gods hallelujah praise the Lord to whom much is given much is required Paul was on earth and the Apostle Paul you know he's trying to go about his business he's trying to do his ministry he's trying to work the ministry and he's got a suer following him creating a scandal behind him screaming out and they these men are men of God come to tell us the truth of the way and everybody knows who she is and this is a scandalous situation and it's probably getting under skin but there's not a thing in the world he can do about it because he's a prisoner to Jesus Christ he's a man under control and he doesn't say anything until God gives him the permission and when God gives him permission he turns and he cast that demon out of that woman so he can be free from that but how long did he have to endure with it he had to endure with it until God told him to speak because he had power under control an anointing is is is supreme anointing is under is power under control and that's where he was see in the book of Jude Jude chapter 1 you don't need to turn there I'm just going to quote it quickly Jude chapter 1:8 says likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise Dominion speak evil of dignities Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses dur not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee amen listen I would think Michael could say whatever he wanted to the devil right but even he bridled his tongue see we see the political scene in the United States and right and left and and red and blue and and and all kinds of extreme statements and you know this one's going to be a dictator and this one's going to be this and it's sad sad I mean it's literally sad and and the reality is it's a horribly sad situation it's embarrassing none of us it's a shame it's a disgrace but it's not for me to throw my hat in and add disgrace to disgrace it's disgraceful America now is on the outside what it is on the inside it's displaying to the world what it actually is but you know this atmosphere can come into the church too you just pick an issue any issue you want that comes up in the church you can polarize you can begin to defend and talk behind closed doors and begin to get together a grassroot hazards and then all of a sudden the conversation isn't well my brother believes this but I have this idea and I think this is a better way and that then it becomes I don't even know if they have the spirit of God they're not part of us they don't see it our way I and and you know what they did too and you know and because of this and this I don't even know if they're right with god listen don't don't think it doesn't happen it's happening all the time right you pick your issue you pick your issue not not just in a local assembly but you pick your issue in a family you pick your issue in a local assembly you pick it in the message worldwide and you can have the same thing that's going on in the United States happening right with ministers throwing darts at each other and P the congregation picking it up and sewing negative seed all I can say is God please stop my mouth and help me not to get caught up in rhetoric I'm ashamed for speaking with offense I'm ashamed for ridicule I'm ashamed for ever saying anything that would swow a negative seed in anybody else's mind I'm ashamed of myself because what we saw yesterday is the power of the tongue God if I give all myself to you it's even this little tongue amen this is not this is not our business you know we have no problem disagreeing with one another I mean we can disagree for hours but we disagree on an issue we disagree on a subject we disagree on a decision we don't disagree about whether we're brothers or not we don't disagree about both of us loving God and where our Eternal destination is and we're not disagreeing on who's the real Christian and who's the impostor that's not what we're that's when you take this that's that's what they've done in this nation between these two candidates and between the the two parties they've made they made one socialist and one dictatorship and and then they make extreme statements and we're going we got Stalin and we got this and that and oh my goodness we we we we what have you done with the extreme statements you polarized people you got people who are angry mobs are breaking out people are stopping traffic in the street throwing stones yelling at each other causing all kinds of strife in workplaces and in families and my goodness why is this going on instead of just saying I disagree with that point because of XYZ not saying well you're nothing but a this and you're a this and a that and a that and you're going to do this that and the other amen we can do the same thing to our brothers say God don't let me do do that cuz I do not want to be guilty of character assassination help me God help me say God put in me your love if you so L the world that you gave your only begotten put that love in me amen he called right right and wrong wrong that was no problem but when he was standing before Pilate he didn't he didn't ridicule him he didn't say you're only a this I mean when he stood before chasis he he never never called him dirty names and he never told him you're this and that and you're going to here and you're going there he never did any of that I mean the Apostle Paul didn't do it either when the Apostle Paul was standing there amen and he and he made a comment according to the law he brought a he brought a correction according to the law and one of the standing nearby smoted him in the mouth and said how dare you speak to the high priest he apologized CU he said I didn't know that he was the high priest I'm sorry because the Bible says don't speak evil against the ruler of my people right look at the example that we've had we don't need to tear down I mean listen if we want to find if we want to criticize we can criticize every Minister who preaches because they're all human beings and they all got something wrong and in every sermon they probably got something wrong so if you detail out every sermon they probably got a story wrong a fact wrong a date wrong a name wrong they probably said it wrong and they and they and they may have accidentally injected some of their own thinking because we're human beings that's right and if you want to criticize you've got all the fuel in the world brother bham said if you come to criticize you'll get plenty that's what he said of his own men you'll get plenty and if you've got that spirit amen that wants to tear something down so you can build yourself up because that's what we're seeing in this nation if I tear down then I'm better if I can pull out flaws that means I've got it right that doesn't mean you've got it right any more than the one who's got the moat in his eyes finding the Splinter in the other ones or the beam looking at the remote just because we can find fault in the ministry we can find fault in the teaching we can find fault in this doesn't mean that all of the sudden I've got it all figured out you might be the one with the beam shooting out of your mouth your eye and you're saying look at that he got that WR that's not brother Brenham said this before that sorry sorry brother I'm ducking that beam that's coming out of your eye that's not the the way we're supposed to treat one another that's not why God called us to be a family of God that's not the way we're supposed to treat other human beings not our neighbors not our co-workers not the people who treat us evil we're not supposed to treat them that way but we're supposed to be kind to them do good unto them and therefore heaping hot coals upon their head we sure shouldn't be doing it to one another so to me we see travesty in America I see travesty in Chad Lamb I see the same error I seen there the same error in me it's it's easy to point and say that that was CNN's fault that was because of MSNBC if we have ever participated in mocking our leadership and criticizing and ridiculing maybe we had a part to play too maybe what we should just do is take The Godly example that's been given to us through the Bible and bridle our tongues and say God I really want to be an amateur God I don't want to be a hybrid product and I don't want to get the power you've given me and I don't want to misuse it and abuse it listen if we tear down every one of our brothers and sisters we're going to have if we as men do it we're going to have wives and children that don't trust anybody that don't know who's real and not real and what Ministry to touch and what Ministry not to touch because they've all got some fault because Dad said something negative about every one of them and then we get upset when the church didn't do enough to save our children and they ran away but who did they Trust yes when every one of them's been picked apart at home every one of them had fault finding missions taken out on them and all the leadership and now all the deacons and I wouldn't have picked that one and I wouldn't have picked this one and the trustees this and the and the not Sunday school teacher this what kind of seeds are we sewing into one another when we make statements like that and then things escalate and then things blow up and then there's Church splits and then there's Division and this family won't talk to this family and it's wor words most of the time it's words words from an unbridled tongue words from a son or daughter of God Amen who needs to say God forgive me help me I want this mouth to be used for your glory healing and strength and virtue and edification of the body of Christ needs to come out of this mouth amen if I disagree with a brother strongly enough to think that he's got a big problem then I should be manad enough to and loving enough to go go talk to him about the problem help me God help me help me help me God in Galatians chapter 5 let's turn there together I've driven down the street and been so appalled to see in the yards of people signs with the viest language possible referring to the president of the United States how did we get to this place how do we get to the place we can look at a brother who loves this message and served God all of his life how can we get to the place where we can look at a brother and and call him serpent seed or say he's not even called to the ministry how do you know he's not called to the ministry how could you say such a thing and who's in earshot when you say it and what did it do to them when you said that what kind of reality does that begin what kind of atmosphere starts from that seed see we do the same thing as Believers to one another that's happening in our country and it ought not to be named amongst us and I'm asking God to help me CU I'm guilty Lord I'm guilty I'm guilty of being too critical I'm guilty of bad mouthing I may not have called names but I get up here and I say these other ministers this and this and in your mind you're going what other ministers say God forgive me yes our ministers going to do things wrong always it'll always be in the church and it will always happen but you know what I want my brother to be my brother and my brother fails and if he leaves he fails and he leaves but I I don't want it to be because of me things are wrong they need to be said wrong things are taught wrong they need to be taught right things that come across wrong need to be said I don't agree with that I believe that's wrong this is the way I believe it that's wonderful but leave a brother a brother and don't touch God's anointed let God deal with them don't touch your brother or your sister leave your mouth off of them and let God take care of it Galatians [Music] 5:13 Galatians 5:13 for Brethren you've been called un Liberty Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed that that you be not consumed one of another that's what's happening to America she's being destroyed from within consumed from one another let's not let it happen in the church in The Bride of Jesus Christ let's not I don't want to be a participant I don't for my failures in the past I've asked God to forgive me and I pray he helps me never fail again if I do I pray that his spirit will rebuke me quickly because I don't want to be guilty of these things I want to I want to love God and love his children man God knows how to sort everything out he knew how to take care of pilate he knew how to take care of the Romans in Daniel's day he knew how to take care of the Lions he knew how to take care of those that opposed Daniel he knew how to take care of the wrong King and he God knew how to take care of it all God knows what he's doing amen but let me use my mouth for life and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother benam comes and gives a warning to the church at the beginning and I'm just going to pick up the last part of it says cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle it will kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here it hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take take the Buckle as another brother testified I minister to here the other night about having the Buckle see and in a vision that buckle on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another now listen this state this last statement just catch it talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you I want the blessings of God he's made it simple draw up close together love one another anyhow and say nice things about each other and then God will bless you you know you know the easiest way you you you watch political rallies you can get people in a fervor and a frenzy over an issue that they probably don't even really understand really when you break it down the people probably don't even comprehend the complexity of it the nature the cost and how how the laws actually work and how you would actually accomplish certain things they probably have no idea what the issue actually is and the complexity behind it but you get a talking point over an issue and when we get the talking point over an issue then you can create an enemy when you can create an enemy you can create a rally and you can work people into a frenzy by having a common enemy we can do it in church so easy friends if all of a sudden I come here and I want to get people in a frenzy whipped into a frenzy all I got to do is say they say we can't they say we don't they're talking about us yeah as soon as I start doing that what do you do immediately who's doing that who and you're ready to fight and then and then if I start telling you other ministers are attacking me you're Pastor they're saying this on the they're saying that you're ready to fight for me because you love me then I pick an issue whatever the issue is I start beating my my my my drum on that issue and pretty soon everybody in the church is in a fighting frenzy ready to go to fight at those people are saying those things about our pastor and our church and don't even understand what the real issue is you can make a good camp meeting on they versus us it's a political rally and I don't want to be part of a political rally I don't want to participate I don't want to add rhetoric I don't want to do anything to fuel that fire and God forgive me for ever coming and fueling a fire like that by saying things like that God knows my heart I am as sorry as sorry can be what I want to do is talk about the issue yeah the point the word of God the Life of Christ the message of the hour life and edification and healing and nurture and everything God's given us what unites us and ties us together gives us overcoming power brings us into adoption and takes us out of this Earth and puts us back as Sons and Daughters let's talk about the issue amen and if something's wrong we'll correct it man but we don't labor on the correction we just say that's a wrong this is a right understanding let's keep moving [Music] forward oh man that's a rally that's something to Rally around amen that's something to Rally forth that's life amen that's Redemption that's Christ amen that's the message amen but we can get a rally so fast on us and them and we're this and they're that and they say this about us and and it ends up being unqualified statements a whole slew of unqualified white statements right right God please help us these cocko bur Natures are filthy they're decrepid they are a hindrance to our life they are absolute thorns in our flesh help us gone brother bam says in the paman church age he says there it is he is a spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man when God drops a revelation of a word in the heart of a child of God and it comes from his heart to his lips that has creative power that is deity speaking Every Mountain he said has to go why God is using the mouth of his children to perform his word that's what I want my mouth reserved for that's what I my heart reserved for that's what I want my mind reserved for we live in a leodan culture we live in a a a cancel culture we live in a a a social media hype and oh it's just ridiculous most of it has no substance it's just rhetoric rhetoric that gets inflamed and then passions get inflamed over things where people are Marching on the street and they don't really understand the issue they're marching about but you realize that's the atmosphere we're immersed in and we have a sticky cber nature we got to keep ourselves washed away from that wash me out of that I don't need that what I need is life lifegiving word amen I need to be under the the Fountain of the word to be cleansed from all of that things to keep my mind my mouth my heart everything focused on Christ amen I hope that's not how we learn how to deal with issues with one another and in our homes that' be sad let's go to First Peter 3 together I want to read a couple more scriptures as we wind down to a close 1 Peter chapter 3 in verse 8 1 Peter chap 3:8 says finally be you all of One mind having compassion one of another love his Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessing knowing that ye are there there unto called that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that speak no guile let him escue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open un their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil let's go to Ephesians now this is the scripture I want to leave you with the last scripture I'd like to read this morning Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4: 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers let that scripture be a theme for us I think I need it before my eyes constantly let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that's building up that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers that's why God gave me a mouth that's why I'm on this Earth that's why he's giv me the word that's why I have a mouth I want to use it for edification and to and to give grace to the hearers to speak life may God use my mouth for that power of life and death lay in the tongue happy is the man that eats the fruit thereof remember Abraham when Abraham in in Genesis I think Genesis 22 Abraham is called of God to go and sacrifice Isaac's son and they're moving along towards the the place of sacrifice God told him where to go and he's journeying three days and and they get to the place where he's going to separate from the two servants that are with him and listen to what Abraham says Abraham is a Son of God on this Earth and Abraham says you two stay with the donkey here the lad and I will go forth in worship and shall return again something popped out of his mouth because there was something in his heart when you read through the scripture there in Genesis you can't see what was in his heart but when you go over to Hebrews 11 you find out what was in his heart he says Abraham amen when he went to offer Isaac as a sacrifice he believed he reckon that God was able to bring him back from the dead as he received him in a tithe so what is in Abraham's heart as Abraham's moving along in his three-day Journey with his son he's going over the word of God in his mind amen he's not speaking evil he's not saying why me why do I have to be the one nobody else has had to do this he keeps going through the promise in his mind where God came to me he said I didn't go to God God came to me I didn't ask the promise he promised me a seed amen when I asked him he told it would come from my loins when I thought it was is he told me no it was Isaac that would come from Sarah and this is Isaac that came from Sarah so he's dwelling and meditating on the word of God he's got faith in his heart accounting and all of the sudden he tells his he tells these two attendants he says you stay here the lad and I will go and worship and come back listen he didn't at that point know how God was going to do it but he knew God could raise him up because this is the word of God then as they get further they put all the sticks upon Isaac and they they going up and and Isaac goes Dad here is the wood and and there is the knife and he said where's the sacrifice and out of his mouth pops the Lord will provide for himself a lamb for a sacrifice you know what that was that was creative power that was Prof IC word I don't know that he saw in a vision I don't know that he knew we have no record that God told him but I don't know we don't know if he was saying something amen just to appease Isaac or we we have no idea there's no way in the scripture for us to know that he knew that God was going to provide a ram because we went through the motions of sacrificing Isaac he wasn't looking around for a ram he was standing up here putting the altar together putting the wood together tying his son's hands laying him on getting the night out of the sheath getting ready to plunge it into his heart brother Bram said he's not one Who's acting like he knows there's going to be a ram he's one Who's acting like he knows he has to sacrifice his son but he believes that God is more than able to raise him up and if he needs a lamb God will provide for himself a lamb even if this is the Lamb that he has to resurrect but God does exactly what pops out of his mouth that God provides a Ram with his horn stuck in the thicket I don't know that Abraham knew what he was saying but Abraham was God's mouthpiece on the earth and when Abraham said it God could do it God get out of my mind rhetoric and trash and fighting and striving and put the word and the word only in my mind let me be in the atmosphere of love and edification and word all the time until what pops out of my mouth is faith in the word faith in the word faith in the word not tear down edify not ridicule not criticism not Strife not any of these things but what pops out of my mouth when I see a brother going astray I say oh praise God God will bring him back cuz he's my brother not I always thought there was something funny I always had a funny feeling around him let's stay focused on the word until that comes out of our mouth is the word till what we speak is faith in the word till what we say in a moment's notice is something that come from the word something that come from faith in the word not something that comes from all the rhetoric that surrounding us not hate speech and negativism and we're immersed in it in this culture we're immersed in negative character dis tear downs and assassinations uh pulling people down exposing people's flaws and Falls well it absolutely this nation is riddled with that this culture let it not be part of us but let this mouth be used for the word of God and may it express faith in the word of God and out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so let me put in my heart word of God the message of the hour love and life and edification and peace and healing and restoration and bride Min let me just be so full of it that when I have to speak in a moment's notice that my mind doesn't even activate but my heart says God will do it God can God's more than able let our mouth have creative power it's creating anyways listen your words are creating anyways may they be used to create the atmosphere that comes from the word yes may we give God remember God is the high priest of our confession there ain't a thing he can do with a negative confession brother Brandon said when it's off the word and negative and and it comes from offense and it comes from uh uh bitterness he can't do a thing with those kind of confessions that come out of our mouth but when it comes from faith in the word when it comes from belief in him when it's the word that's spoken he's the high priest he can go to work on our confession and bring it to pass so let me use my mouth and the creative power that God's put in me May there be virtue in me for others may be their words of edification and healing and may it speak grace to the heal hearers God help me at the end of the sermon the only thing I can say is God help me I I've been wrong I I was probably wrong yesterday I may have been wrong this morning like we may not even realize how wrong we are I mean the S the things we say through clinched teeth and traffic may not be what a son of God's supposed to say right yes yeah you understand we may be more guilty than we realize I know I'm guilty I'm probably guiltier than I realize yes and I just want to say to you all I love you all and I'm sorry for ever sewing a negative seed in your mind about other churches other Ministries other ways of believing I'm sorry God knows my heart I am sorry I don't want this kind of atmosphere I don't want to promote it I don't want to add fuel I don't want to throw I don't want to throw one little twig in a bonfire let alone a giant log God help me to speak Grace edification healing peace virtue let it come out of my mouth let the atmosphere around me have creative power to create the atmosphere of Christ an atmosphere of love and may there be virtue that somebody can draw out of of my life being an amateur God might be harder than we thought we we want to stand on the bow of the ship and we want somebody to take a picture while we do it hurry get a video of this that's what we get in our minds when we say imate your Gods we think of power and we think of we think of prestige and the humans are so faulty this way we think of elevation and exaltation and that's right right but the Way Up Is Down first you got to go down before you got to go up you got to get down to humility you got to say God I'm nothing and I'll fail without you and I don't know what to do unless you tell me how to do it we get these visions of being bride of Jesus Christ and amateur gods and and and the the manifestation of the third pool I believe there's going to be a manifestation of the I do believe in an absolute outpouring at the final moments of time for God will prove this was her there's so many things brother Benham said but he's not going to put that power of spoken word into somebody who can't use their mouth right on the way to work so I want to become an amateur God now I want to be moved into that image I want to be corrected I want I want the the tutor I want the tutor to go back to God and says he's starting to get it father it's been a long time but I know he's made a lot of mistakes but I see a little bit of progress he did oh if the tutor could just say that about me I'd be so happy say I want to I want to know I'm growing I want to know I'm becoming more like him I want to know that I'm learning my lesson I want I want to be in His image on this Earth I want to be his representation on this Earth and to be his representation on this Earth it's going to take a whole lot more than a bunch of rhetoric and strong talk and verbal this and stomping around it's going to take a real life from your toes all the way to the top of your head from your soul all the way out it's going to take the reality of this word being flesh inside of us it's going to take death and death and more death and surrender and surrender and more surrender and it's going to take us having to look in the mirror and being honest with what we see no coverups no sweeping under rugs but just brutal honesty on God I'm failing you help me God I need your help now or I'll never make it of failure to begin with praise God brother BR says in the breach so now he has the title deed the Redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all the time but now it's in the hand of the lamb now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's coming to claim it back for the human race not claim it back for Angels claim it back to human which it was give to to make Sons and Daughters of God again bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animal life everything else oh my don't that make you feel good yeah it makes me feel good cuz if he didn't take that title deed I'm hopeless if he didn't bring it back to man I'm hopeless but he's bringing it back he's the one who's working it amen at the opening of the word amen that that Holy Ghost was released in full measure to come and live the life of this word amen so now everything we're talking about is possible in the day we live it's possible how is it possible not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord oh if I could just get myself out of the way and he can come in and fill me he's taking the title deed back do you believe he's taking the title deed back do you believe he's brought it back to claim back for for who he didn't claim it back for himself he claimed it back for human beings what does that mean that means he's brought back my right to go back to being a Son of God before hybridization I'm going back to that place before corruption set in amen let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll please come he said in Jehovah Gyra I'll read this as the music musicians come he said now here is the church he is among his church today made flesh in his church certainly Elohim now oh if you could only realize that you men you were made to be an amateur God you're a Son of God you're an heir of God and you have a do domain Genesis 1:26 he give him dominion over everything in the earth he made him a God over the Earth that's right he gave him a Dominion he's a king God and where he got his fall he could speak to the trees be changed be plucked up said over here to the winds waves be still and it stop he was God an amateur God a Son of God like you're a son of your father and all the world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for the church to get back in its place again sons of God to be made manifest waiting for that hour I hope that don't hurt but I just had to say it see the church is so far away from its place it needs to be back to be sons of God again rulers governors of the earth under the spiritual Reign it will be someday when the chief one comes Jesus Christ the great Millennium Nature's groaning for that day have you seen the weather you seen earthquakes have you seen fires have you seen hurricanes have you seen chaos break out all over the Earth what is it the Earth is groaning what's the Earth groaning for it's groaning for you and I to come back in position this word came to bring us back back into position his spirit's here to make it happen what does he need he needs us to create that atmosphere to surrender to yield you know sometimes the greatest battle is recognizing we're wrong brother sometimes what keeps us stuck in a rut for so long is we're blinded to our own failure we don't even recognize how wrong we are we keep trucking down the road thinking everything fine everything's right we're doing okay and we don't realize that that what we're doing is wrong contrary to the word hindering our lives and hurting the ones around us sometimes the most loving thing God has ever done for us is is took the veil off and said this is where you're wrong and oh how devastating it is I don't know if it's for you but it's for me to realize I've been so wrong I've been so wrong I've been so self-serving I've been so proud I've been so I've been so wrong but all the grace of God that can come along and give us an opportunity to say father forgive me for I have sinned forgive me for the atmosphere that's around me forgive me for the creation I created this atmosphere I'm in the middle of contention all the time I'm in the middle of strife it seems like I'm always in in some sort of TS with somebody amen and then we blame the we blame the somebody I'm always in the middle of a fix I'm always in the middle of a disaster I'm always in the middle of of some uproar and then and then you're like everybody around me are just nuts there might be a common denominator maybe you need to realize I created this atmosphere and I'm attracting this by my atmosphere if I wanted to change maybe if I change my atmosphere things around maybe I have the power to create the reality that I live in by changing my attitude my perception by lining up to the word by surrendering and repenting and allowing the spirit of God more room to work in my life maybe it'll change the atmosphere around me and the change in atmosphere might change everything I've been battling with for years might be the atmosphere that I created God help us all I can say is I need the iav I need the eyes saav to see so that I can repen and have God come and I want to be a Son of God you know what I want to do more anything I don't want to be the one who stands on the bow of the boat and has his picture taken and I don't want to be the one whose name is in the paper and I mean all that's fine and if God allows all that we'll Rejoice at the glory god gets but you know what I want to be I want to be the one that at the end of the day he says I'm happy with you son I'm pleased with what you've done whether there's a picture taken or anybody knows or there's a testimony that goes around the world or not it doesn't matter what I want more than anything is to please my father and I want to be a son that pleases my father that's the one that comes to adoption is the one that pleases the father and does it his way it's not the son who always got his own idea and often not listening to the tutor and improve and everything that's not the one that comes to adoption the one that comes to adoption under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost comes into the very image of his father so that his father can entrust him with more power that's who's coming to adoption that's what I want at the end of the day I want to move closer and closer to his likeness every day and be pleasing to him it's the greatest desire of my heart is to please my father amen and where did that desire come from came from God thank god let's bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful God God in your word you had Paul write to Timothy and tell him that the word is good for reproof rebuke instruction and righteousness God that the man of God might be thoroughly furnished
