amen bless you man god bless you brother amen praise the lord thank you musicians [Music] amen while we're standing let's turn to the the book of revelation [Music] and we'll begin revelation chapter 2. revelation chapter 2 i'm going to read verse 7. this is the message to the ephesian church age and we're going to read verse 7. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god you can have your seats amen now we see the promise to the at the end of the ephesians message to the ephesian age verse 7 gives us the first promise and a series of promises and it says uh he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh so there's a promise laying here but the promise is only for a certain individual and it's only for he that overcometh amen this promise is not for everybody this promise is for the overcomer he says to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god and i say what a promise that is amen to eat of the tree of life means you're a partaker of eternal life but that's only for the overcomer praise god now brother graham says in the message how can i overcome he says watch what the overcomer is promised see now now laodicea that's the last church age there's going to be some overcomers in there watch there they now remember each each church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered so don't leave this in ephesus because these promises are accumulative so that's what he says each church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered watch up here now it's after they done received all these powers these names and everything written that he promised and eat the hidden man and all down through watching this last church age to him that overcometh i will grant to sit with me in my throne so though these promises now we're in the laodicean church age and these promises are made available all of the promises all the way down through are made available to us if we're overcomers amen so i want to i want to minister this morning on how to overcome if these promises are for overcomers then i'd like to be an overcomer because if i'm an overcomer i can eat of the tree of life and i can have all these i can be a partaker of all these promises through the church ages so i want to overcome so the question is how to overcome how how to overcome let's let's keep reading these promises as we go down through let's look at the smyrna church age in chapter 2 verse 11. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death praise god verse 17 in the pergamus church age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh if you're going to find there's a consistent theme here let him that hath an ear to hear what the spirit saith so you have to be the type of person that has a special ear and not everybody has this ear most all human beings unless they have some deformity or birth defect have ears but this isn't the ears he's talking about this is a special ear to hear what the spirit says so to be an overcomer and to have this promise you have to be able to hear amen you have to have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying and then to him that overcometh amen will i give to eat of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone and then the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it now the thyatira church age verse 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i receive them my father and i will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches sardis church age verse chapter 3 verse 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches philadelphia church age verse 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith into the churches and now the laodicean church age in verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame in him sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches i don't know about you but i want all of those i want the white robe i want the white stone with a new name i want written on me the name of of god i want written on me the name of new jerusalem and i want revealed to me jesus new name i want to eat of the tree of life i want i want a white robe i want all of the things that are promised i want them all and they're all available if i have an ear to hear what the spirit saith and i am an overcomer so we must be overcomers that inherit this we have to have an ear to hear that's predestination amen and we have to be an overcomer amen that's also predestinated praise god amen i tell you there's such uh there's such a power in the revelation of predestination how do i know i will overcome i've been predestinated to overcome amen but it's still god is in partnership with man it still requires us in a surrendered way amen to surrender to god's program for the overcoming to come into manifestation i'm already ordained to overcome amen god's already knows the the end from the beginning he knows what the finish will be amen but i've got to get with his program and surrender and yield to his program to see the manifestation of the overcoming so if you've got an ear to hear what the spirit say to the churches you should be rejoicing amen praise god that i can actually hear i i'm in a generation amen where these this word has been this book has been open this word has been revealed and i hear it and i believe it and and it makes sense to me and i love it and i want it when millions don't i do god has given me an ear to hear what the spirit says and now i want to be that overcomer that inherits the cumulative prize of all the church ages he says now we in the in the laodicean he says he that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also come and sit down with my father in his throne brother branham in the church age book he says see it's not on throne it's end throne in my throne in my father's throne not on a throne he said this is not a seat this is a position of power in the kingdom the throne is the entire realm of the kingdom amen it's the inheritance it's it's the rule jurisdiction it's it's the full territory of god in jesus christ amen and he says when i if you overcome in this last age amen and the laodicean church age if you have a ear to hear what the spirit says in this age and you that overcometh in this age i will give you to sit with me in my throne amen that means you'll sit in the kingdom and the power of position and authority with him in the kingdom of god praise be to god amen it's more than a seat it's the whole realm of christ amen in the church age book and the laodicean church age brother ben says now what are we to overcome he just read this the scripture that we read in revelation 3 21 he says now what are we to overcome that's wonderful i've looked at this so many times in in in our age and leo to see what is it that we're to overcome but listen to how brother ben puts a twist on this now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here right if you're an overcomer you can get this prize what do i overcome where's the dragon i must slay where's the hill i must climb where's the race i must win and brother branham says this is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it doesn't matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome amen you can say what do we overcome in this last stage we can list a whole list of things we overcome unbelief we we overcome deception we overcome you we can make a whole list of what do we overcome in the laodicean church age brother man said that's not really the important part that's not the emphasis of the scripture amen because it doesn't matter what you need to overcome the method is always the same if you know how to overcome you will overcome every obstacle so the question that needs answered is how to overcome not what to overcome [Music] don't worry the world will supply the what we need god to give us the how. and when we have the how no matter what the enemy throws as the what we can overcome the what with the how. so i don't i don't care so much about the name of the what what to overcome name it anything you want to name it but if god will reveal to me how to overcome amen then it doesn't matter what i'm overcoming the same method will always overcome and conquer it goes it goes on to say in the same quote a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 where jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly through the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word catch that eve failed she fell in her personal temptation by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because the word can't fail oh i love this last sentence we're going to spend a minute on this amen the only way to be an overcomer is by the word but it's also the only way that you can know that you're overcoming because the word can't fail so you can't tell whether you're overcoming or not by how well you're performing or behaving amen because we go through cycles in life amen things cycle and and we have our ups and our downs amen and we cannot always gauge whether or not we're overcoming by what's happening in our lives amen the only way we can know we're overcoming is if we're standing solely upon the word and we're standing solely upon the word it doesn't matter what turmoil we're in in the middle of our lives we are overcoming because the word can't fail you say i'm applying the word but everything's going wrong you're overcoming hold steady you're overcoming right now by saying i believe the word regardless of symptoms regardless of circumstances this is the word and it's the only thing for me amen you're overcoming right now today and you can be going through the worst situation of your life but you are currently overcoming and that is the only way to know that you're overcoming because you can't you know wake up in the morning and feel pretty good and there's no symptoms no troubles i got a job there's money in the bank everything's fine i'm overcoming that's no sign you're overcoming and so whether we're in a trial or not in a trial there's no sign whether we're overcoming the only way to know for overcoming is by staying with the word and the word only this is becoming such a critical message amen i can't get beyond preaching on these things amen because you know i don't know why it's just the way god's leading me but as i meditate on this there's so many things that we try to do and try to produce and we try to be stronger and we try to do better and we always try to guard ourselves and protect ourselves and reform ourselves and all of this stuff and we end up continually in a cycle of failure and uh disappointing ourselves and we've got to get our eyes off of ourselves and start focusing on the word that is god god has given us and stick with that word and overcome by the word and stop injecting self into the picture because that's the miserable failure to begin with so i cannot lean on self rely on self depend on self i've got to get self out of the picture and say regardless of myself this word is true amen and i'm standing with this word all the way to the finish line regardless of what happens that's the only way to know if you're overcoming because the word can't fail when i read that something lit up inside of me and said that's the deception of the age to get us to base our experiences with the lord off of emotions because emotions are so fickle i'm an overcomer today i'm a failure tomorrow i'm a failure today i might be an overcomer tomorrow if i'm an overcomer tomorrow i may only be an overcomer for an hour tomorrow then i'm not an overcomer anymore but this promises to the overcomer it's not something to play with i have to know how to be an overcomer because i believe these promises are for me and i want all of the promises i want to apprehend them all so i'm not going to play around with this this is something i have to know is how to overcome amen the devil will absolutely play games with you emotionally and if we're depending on willpower or emotion to gauge our level of overcoming amen we are going to find ourselves miserable frustrated and constantly constantly questioning our sonship our faith our brideship but we base all of these things off the word amen and further down in the libyan church age he says in his own personal life contending with himself he's talking about jesus now he's speaking of jesus christ in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god jesus was contending with himself amen where in the garden of gethsemane we can see it clearly and plainly if jesus had to contend with himself what do you think you and i have to do it says he overcame by obedience to the word of god and then brother branham goes to hebrews chapter 5 verse 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of god so he suffered he yielded himself he overcame by obeying the father and yielding to the word and that's how he contended with himself and overcame himself amen it's not as though jesus didn't anymore despise the cross it's not that he prayed in gethsemane till all of a sudden he was no longer despising the cross or despising the shame of the cross it was no longer that he didn't love his disciples anymore and he no longer had a feeling for them and didn't want to leave them amen i believe he still had his desire to stay with his disciples i believe he still had love for them and concerned for them i believe he still despised the shame of the cross but he had overcome himself to yield himself to the will of god to obey the word of god and that was his overcoming that was his victory what was he obedient to the word of god now then there will not listen closely now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne amen it doesn't matter how loud you say it what matters is if you live it it doesn't matter how boldly you proclaim i'm this and i'm that and i'm what matters is if you stay surrendered to that word and you overcome by the word in the word only praise god in the message how can i overcome from 1963 it says lord jesus he said an hour and 15 minutes now standing here trying to take your word and explain to the people how to overcome you told us how it's done you didn't tell us but you showed how it was done you led us you showed us how to do it receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold to that word be sure the hold of that word it is written in every temptation but be humble and walk humbly then we have conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy and the only thing we have to do is just walk humbly with humble with faith believing that and our badge of identification of the holy ghost and satan has to move so brother is giving us directions he's giving us a recipe and he's praying he's praying out to the lord he's saying lord you showed us how to do it you didn't just tell us but you showed us and with it is written amen so we have to receive the word inside of us and hold to it is written in every temptation but be humble and walk humbly this is the recipe this is how jesus lived then we have conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy we're just tapping into the same power when we come humbly submissive to the word we're tapping into the same power that overcame the first time will overcome this time because i'm coming to the same thing the same way i'm coming to the same source getting in the same channel with the same humble humility the same reverence the same surrender amen and then i'm tapping into the same power that overcame back there will overcome today because i'm coming the same way praise be to god let's turn to matthew chapter 4. we've been through this several times together but i want to take a look at it again matthew chapter 4 verse 1. it says now chapter 4 verse 1 of matthew it says then was jesus let up let up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taken him up into a holy city and setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus said unto him it is written again that thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hint satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels come and ministered unto him amen brother franco if you could pull up the white board for me i'm going to use that here in just a second brother bam has a quote here in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever from 1958 he says now we find him as soon as god came upon him he was anointed went into the wilderness and out after 40 days and defeated satan by the word of god what did he do he brought any divine promise in reach of the weakest of christians if he was god why did he let satan say if thou be the son of god perform a miracle here and show me you can do it turn these stones into bread and eat he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone so then the satan always tries to coat the word i love how brother brahma says that he doesn't say quote the word he knows what he's saying he coats the word amen he puts a little coating on it and changes it a little bit amen and he does it intentionally brother brahm said satan always tries to coat the word and went back and told him when he put him at the pinnacle of the temple he said again it is written and he defeated satan on the word of god that shows that you can defeat satan on the word of god no matter the word of god will defeat satan any place anywhere under any condition if it's in the belly of a whale if it's an alliance then if it's on the bed with a cancer or if it's laying yawned or bleeding to death in an audible accident the word of god will defeat satan anywhere and the weakest christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it praise god amen we've went through this before and taught on this but something new opened up in this message how can i overcome and and i want to look at that in addition to what we've seen before so when we look at the temptation amen of eve in the garden jesus had to overcome the same three types of of temptations and this is this is uh if i can mark it this way these are three oh i'm gonna come down here these are three personal temptations and it has to do with our flesh the one is the lust of the eyes two the lust of the flesh and three the pride of life brother ben was going to show us everything works in threes and when he come to this next one i got really excited because i never seen this before or the one i'm going to get to not the next one so his personal temptation in the flesh was attempted by the lust of the eyes by the lust of the flesh by the pride of life these are things we have to face and we have to overcome eve failed to overcome them because she failed to use the word if she would have just used the word and she didn't have a complicated word the word was simple do not touch it was simple don't partake of that tree it wasn't complex it wasn't complicated if she would have just used the simple words she had but it became complicated when it filtered through human reasoning and she began to wonder about things and question things instead of just simply using the simple word the simple word would have overcome the devil you know the devil comes so sophisticated sometimes amen and so uh when when we're dealing on the level of reasoning it becomes so tricky and so slippery and and so complicated and complex at times amen but if we could just ever get back to the simplicity of the word and say i don't understand what you're saying and i can't put all these pieces together but i know the word says this and i'm going to stay right here it would be a lot better for us all right then there was three things three things we must not do with the word so these go together because satan does all three of these in the temptation to jesus number one to miss interpret the word you should you must not misinterpret the word two you must not misplace the word and three you must not dislocate the word and in these three things when he goes to misinterpret the word he says thou shalt not dash thy foot against the stone he begins to quote the word to jesus thou shalt not dash thy foot amen but he's misinterpreting even the meaning of that scripture it doesn't even mean that it's not even referring he's telling he's telling him to go up on top of the pinnacle and throw himself off to force god to save him that's not even what that scripture is talking about and so the devil will try to misinterpret the word he'll try to misplace it he'll try to have jesus amen making food for himself in the wilderness but that's not the placing there's going to be another time for that in another setting he tries to get him to dislocate the word by telling him to take the kingdom now but that scripture that part of the of the prophecy doesn't fit now it'll fit later amen when he comes to return the son of david to set up the kingdom in the millennial reign so it's part of the word but it's a dislocation of the word all right and so when he he tries to get him by misinterpreting the word by misplacing the word my dislocating the word and he gets him by the tries to tempt him by the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life this is such an education for us if we'll pay attention because the same thing happens to us all the time he's going to try to trip us up by the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life he's going to try to get us to misinterpret the word to misplace the word or to dislocate the word and so we have to be we've seen the devil's tactics amen and so the the devil's tactics i love it the devil comes three ways to tempt your flesh lust of the eyes lest the flesh pride of life he comes with three tactics in the word to try to misinterpret misplace or dislocate but jesus always responds with one method one weapon the sword of the word the sword of the spirit which is the word of god it is always it is written it is written it is written it is written so the devil will try three different ways amen three different methods and and jesus always has one response and that one response is the sword of the spirit which is the word of god so for us we only have one response if we really want to have victory and be an overcomer amen we have to take the word with a strong hand of faith amen and drive it to the heart of the enemy with it is written the word says the prophet taught this is what god taught us in this day and if we'll take that and stand on it amen we will be an overcomer and we will know that we are overcoming because we're overcoming by the word so so whatever method we wanted to use for overcoming in the past let's throw it away and take the overcoming that comes by overcoming by the word regardless of the circumstances god will change the circumstances i don't have control over the circumstances if i had control over the circumstances i would change them if you have control over the circumstances then don't change them then there's something wrong with you but the things we face we cannot control we cannot change in our own power we're depending on god to change them i cannot force him to change him i cannot tell him how to change them i cannot bully god and pressure him into doing something according to my thinking i got to come humbly with the word and let god do what he's going to do but i have to have absolute confidence that god will do it if i just stay with his word and let him work it out the way he said he would work it out it's not my problem to fix now i've taken his word now he has to fix it amen how many of you have given god advice on what to do to solve your problems god i have this problem and i need you to do this and how many times has you solved your problem but he didn't do what you said to do he did something else and it worked out a lot better i think he's training us he wants us to understand how to be an overcomer how to be a real overcomer now brother branham got into three more things here that i want to go into we've taught on all this before but this one was new i saw this for the first time myself and the message how can i overcome he says his 40 days of temptation by god's word he overcome i want to express something here just for a few minutes satan made three major assaults upon him in the temptation three major assaults amen watch it always in them three don't forget it he made three major assaults from the highest to the lowest he tried his best to conquer him but he was the word amen what did he use himself the word what did christ use he used himself the word satan's three major attacks are assaults upon him but he met it with the word every attack he could make it with the word watch this now from the highest to the lowest he goes on he says now first he made his attack upon to use his great power which he knowed he was the word he knowed his position you believe he did this i the son of man he knowed his position and satan come and wanted him to use his own power on himself to feed him want to feed himself he was hungry a man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal rob beg borrow anything he had that appetite remember we have to understand that jesus was 100 man and 100 god when he after 40 days when he was fasting and he says afterward he was a hungered he was hungry very very hungry amen and so now the temptation comes he had that appetite and satan used his first great major assault upon him to make his own power that he had been given to overcome with and use it on himself didn't use it on himself no he used it on others that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it so let's look at this next round so these are three errors he called them three great assaults three errors and applying the word right so he tried to tempt him with lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life tried to mis interpret the word misplace the word dislocate the word and he also tries to get him the error and the application of the word i love how brother branham can bring so much out of a passage of scripture first in the in the error the first thing he does is to use his power oh forgot the r you have no idea what kind of pressure it is to write in front of school teachers and good spellers the first was he tried to get him to use his power for himself and jesus wasn't given this position for himself he was given this position for others remember brother branham would be praying for people and so sick he could hardly stand gripping the sides of the pulpit just to stay up and people being healed of cancer deaf ears opening but he himself was so sick he could hardly stand up anymore he said the gift wasn't for me it was for you and brother ben was so faithful even in the messy standing in the gap when he began to pull back because of hurt feelings amen he said i let the sick people lay i had a gift of healing to take to the people and i let them lay and he found that he was he was withholding and he was wrong for doing that he had to get his gift back out to the people because the gift was given for the people and and that's why jesus came he came to redeem he came to save he came with great power to overcome but the devil tried to get him to use it on himself under the lust of the flesh to make food for himself he was trying to get him to use it in a carnal temporal way because god's program is eternal amen god he came for an eternal purpose he came for a word purpose for an eternal purpose and the devil was trying to get him to use his power for a temporal carnal amen satisfaction of the flesh amen to get him out of a tight spot or a difficult situation amen and that was never what that gift in power was for and jesus didn't take the bait because it was a wrong application of the word one god never told him to do it amen and and two it wasn't for him anyways it was for everybody else right praise god that's why you know we can have all these gifts but what good is it for god to give us a gift and us hide it under a bushel basket and us to have a gift and and we just we don't want to get out there because you know i i've been rejected before i've been criticized for singing i got rejected when i did this and and all of this listen that gift is not for you to stay home and enjoy in your private study or your private life if god gave you a gift or a calling or an office in the church it's to be out for everyone else it's not for you to enjoy as you read the word and the word opens to you because god's given you a gift of ministry amen that's not for you that's for the people god's given you a gift to sing a gift of writing songs he's given you a gift of administration a gift of help amen that's not for you to enjoy for your own personal life and benefit that's for others god gave that for the body [Music] amen and jesus came for the rest of the body amen and was he hurt yes was he mocked yes was he ridiculed yes amen was he rejected yes and if you go and give give yourself holy amen to serve the lord and to serve his people with what he's put inside of you you will be misunderstood rejected you will be everything under the sun will happen to you amen not even intentionally sometimes people will reject you or criticize you you'll get your heart stomped on over and over again but it's no right to hold that gift to yourself and use it only for you it didn't come for you it came for the body and jesus passed that temptation how can i overcome again further down he says he says then the second assault said i'll hurry just looks like the time just goes so fast the next great assault was that he made upon him that he would be a show-off and how that does hit god's servants to be a show-off to show what you can do glory to god hallelujah i'm a deliverer i'm so cece come up here on top of the temple and set down here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it hard said now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this temple jump off and i'll give you a scripture for it because it's written he'd give the angels charge over thee we know that that's a mis uh misplacement of the scripture a misinterpretation of the scripture but he gave him a scripture nonetheless amen i'll tell you something for sure that devil's so slick that if if you've got something in your heart you want to do for wrong reasons for fleshly self-pride for the pride of life the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and you want to do it anyways rest assured the devil will show you a scripture or a quote that will give you license to go do that and if you're not really honest looking at it it will be a misapplication of a quote a misplacement of a scripture but you'll do it anyways because it already fulfills something you want inside look at eve eve she was beguiled she was deceived she was deceived because she wanted to be deceived brother bam said she didn't know about this mystery replenish the earth but she wanted to know she had a desire to know amen but the information was held back for a period of time the mystery wasn't unlocked yet and she wanted to know amen she didn't know but she wanted to know so when the devil came and when the serpent came to her he began to entice her with this information amen your eyes will be open you'll be like god's doing good and evil it gave her a way to know she wanted to know was she deceived yes but she already wanted to know so listen here you have people walking through the garden of eden where she can walk with her mate adam who is a prophet she can walk with him she could have waited and asked adam and in the cool of the evening god came to walk and fellowship with his children she could have asked god the father but she didn't go to adam she didn't go to god amen because she was being tempted in something she already wanted to do and wanted to know and so he gave her an answer a solution a way to have her own desire oh i tell you friends the the hardest person in the world to overcome is ourselves the one that we look at in the mirror and if we're ever going to overcome cells we have to start being really honest with ourselves we got to get down to nitty gritty and say you know what that's just me cause that's what i want to do i'm trying to make it work out for me i'm interpreting all the little signs you know i want to go do this thing and and i've got a little bit of a check in my heart a little bit of conviction about wasting that money or wasting that time or doing this so i'm going to watch for god to give a sign all of a sudden somebody else said that and look at this it connects with this and i walked through the store and i saw in the newspaper that same word it sounds ridiculous but that's exactly what we do it's exactly what we do instead of just saying god this is what i want but i don't know that it's what you want i need a real answer it's amazing how dishonest we are with ourselves but the the funny part is deep down we know but up here we convince ourselves when down here we're not sold or maybe i'm the only one who does that but i can explain it thoroughly to you because i've been through it numerous times down here there's a little check a little no but up here in the reasoning realm i want to it's not sin right you can't say it's sin i want to do this but down here there's a little no but i will reason and reason and then all if i can find where the prophet did it where see he went fishing i can abandon these duties and go fishing if i can find where the prophet did it or i can find some some some something to give me just that little edge that little push in my reasoning mind amen to get over this nagging feeling i'll go down that path and then think that i've got an answer from the lord but deep down in your heart you already know i don't know how we can go on being the bride of jesus christ unless we start being really real really real all the way down to the core of our persons and stop playing games in our mind and stop playing games with the word and stop playing games with ourselves but get down to the nitty-gritty and say this is here i am lord this is what i've done god forgive me and lead me and let me stay in your word because he'll try to give you a word that will allow you to do what you already want to do and you know what god will let him to prove what's in our hearts and every once in a while we need to fall and bump our nose real hard to realize that i still need god and i still need to be honest with god and i'm still in fallen flesh and i'm still in a corruptable body with a corruptable mind and i need to feed the white dog and i need to stay close to christ and i need to line to this word if i ever hope to overcome in this world amen so number two is to exalt self number two is to exalt self he wanted to make him a show-off to show his authority i'm i'm going to continue in this quote but i want to throw in a couple other thoughts brother branham has from other messages in harvest time he says satan satan ever had even then watched in this one place here he coded the word even on his supernatural that he tried to get jesus to do the supernatural see being having supernatural what if jesus would have listened to him now wait you want to stay with the word do you you want to stay with the word he said it's written he'd give his angels charge concerning this any time you dash your foot against a stone they bear thee up but he wasn't dashing his foot against no stone but i'm saying it's a misapplication misinterpretation of the word that word was if he would dash his foot against him he wasn't dashing his foot against the stone amen see watch what if he would have to say stayed with it did you notice i never said he quoted the word he coded it coded it like putting an icing on a cake covered it over whitewashed it it wasn't in its right place so he quoted the word to jesus but it was a misplacing misinterpretation of the word amen to get him amen to do something to exalt himself and how can i overcome he says but see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him he minded only what the father said do that's right he said why satan said it's written he'd give the angels charge he said yes but it's also written there you are see he knew who he was satan did the now listen to what brother brother says the thought runs deeper than what it's wrote he's talking about the scriptures yes he used the scripture but there's something deeper you're taking it on a service level and misusing the word it's got a deeper meaning and there's a deeper understanding he said the thought runs deeper than what it's wrote it's it's inspiration the kernel is on the inside of it you see what it really is though he could have done it he didn't do it he had never paid heed to satan's proposition there he here is a good thing sometimes satan can take you and when you think that you're doing the will of god and can make you a proposition you'll far for fall for it yes sir he sure can amen and brother was showing us that it's the word but it's the word it's the word misplaced it's the word misinterpreted yes the scripture says that but that it's not this application yes the word says that but brother branham said see it's the thought that's deeper than what's wrote if we're not going to survive just if we have a surface level being able to read we need amen the word on the inside we need the interpreter of the word amen we need the life of the word on the inside so that when these things come up you could say but that's not that's not exactly right but it's a quote yeah it's a quote but it's not there's something more to that amen something inside that there's something more to that amen and then if you go to look you'll find another quote another quote another quote amen that tells you really what you ought to do and this one's a misplacing of what the brother branham said or taking it out of context or taking it out of sequence and do the same thing with the word amen somebody will give you a justification for what they do a justification for what they want you to do amen but you've got to have that kernel on the inside that can connect to what's deep in the word has to connect what's deep inside of you you'll never win this battle in the mental realm you'll fail every time because the devil will whip you around mentally but it's going to take the life of the word on the inside to recognize the word with the right life be to god so don't be so quick when somebody throws a quote and your heart's still saying no little bell going on ding ding ding ding ding but somebody's got a quote don't ignore that but i tell you too unless you're sure don't contradict what they're saying just wait don't pass any judgment don't because sometimes you get a little ding ding inside and you don't really know what it is it might be because that's right it might be because it's wrong don't throw it away just don't say anything just wait and wait for god to bring a revelation out of the word that shows you what's right and what's wrong amen amen this is rubber meets the road preaching amen this is life this is not surface life this is deep life this is a bride life this is not a denominational life this is not a church life we're talking about a child of god life amen the the world amen has made church a system the world has made church a program and you plug into the system you pull into the program and you're fine amen and so they the the the devil is trying to turn the message in many people's minds into the same thing just the best program and if i plug into the best program i'll be right if i pass through the best program and i'll tell you the message is the best but it's not a program it's a person it's a person who wants to connect with you individually personally and bring the life of that person into you so that you can live this word amen it's not the best program out there it's not the best system it's not the one that will finally work if we take it as a program if we take it as a system it'll never work for us because we can only take it as a life amen but the devil's trying the same tactics he's always tried just get people to plug into a program somewhere they'll say i'm in the message i'm in the message therefore i'm okay that that doesn't compute that's denominationalism i'm in the message i was like you know i why are you doing that and i don't understand this and didn't the prophet say i'm in the message i i don't know that doesn't work for me amen i want to be in christ and i want christ in me i want to live by this word and this word only i don't want to come into these temptations and face the devil amen not knowing where i stand and having no personal christ on the inside no holy ghost amen to lead and guide me and come into a mental battle with the devil it's not going to work back to the back to the quote in um where we were reading i don't remember no true servant of god ever does that he's talking about showing off now you see a man showing off his chest out and all like that just remember there's something wrong there if somebody starts to take a gift take an ability take a talent and begins to exalt themselves and become proud in that there's something wrong there it's not right there's something wrong there amen and the prophet of god is so clear to teach us that and not just to teach us that but demonstrate that for us have you ever seen a more gifted human being in all of your life but he was so humble brother brahm didn't didn't play games didn't show off and even when he when he allowed his campaign managers to create the miracle line you know he was warned not to do it but he'd let them do it again bring your worst cases bring the miracle line they'll be and the managers were saying guaranteed healings every night amen and when brother brown didn't stop that when he was supposed to stop that all of a sudden in the in the prayer line the gift would not work in the prophet of god and it wasn't working and it scared him to death and he went to pray amen and he realized he made his mistake because god doesn't want that kind of showmanship he doesn't want that kind of i guarantee miracles every night amen how can you guarantee amen what you're depending on god to do as if it's linked to you somehow and you have control i guarantee amen and then say healings guaranteed healings every night miracle line bring your worst cases amen and god tolerated that in a season of ignorance and there was great healings and great miracles but when he corrected it he allowed the campaign managers to keep doing it and god showed who was in charge when he lifted the operation that gift from that prophet and it did not work and it and it absolutely tore up the prophet of god he went in desperation because he prayed for a girl that had barely had any hearing and when he prayed for i haven't read it recently so i may have it wrong but i believe it goes she was having problems hearing and he went to pray for her and she went completely deaf that it got worse not better then went for another one and the same kind of thing happened and he stopped and he went back in prayer and desperation amen and god was teaching the prophet a lesson that he had to learn this is not you this is me amen you're you listen you and i are not in control of god god's in control of us amen praise god oh this is a lesson to learn friends so so much nonsense about i'm the bride and i can do in this puffed up arrogant attitude amen if you if you have a revelation that you're the bride it should bring such humility such a reverence because you know there's no way you're capable of it you're not worthy of it amen left to yourself you would ruin everything god ever tried to do in you that you are the worst of the worst of the worst but it's by his grace he has made you bride and it's by his hand he does anything worth doing in your flesh is done by him so this attitude of i'm the bride amen and i can i can continue to dress in a way the prophet told us not to dress i can dabble with makeup i can i wear excessive jewelry tight clothes and high heels and put a tv back in my house and we can let marriage and divorce issues run rampant through the church because i'm the bride you've got a wrong attitude and a wrong spirit because the bride will come humble to this word because she knows that she and herself has no right to have that title you're not born with an inherent right to have that title it's the seed of god on the inside that gives you the right to bear that title and it's god it's not you if god ever lifted his hand off of you and the spirit of god ever moved away from you you would see how capable you are of controlling your flesh and how capable you are of living a christian life [Music] if he gave you one day 12 hours from 6 am to 6 pm where the spirit would pull right out of you and leave you to your own self you would be desperate for him to come back because you would have no control over this animal that you live in [Music] so there's no place for this arrogant attitude amen we've got to come back and say i am only what i am by the grace of god and you can say i am the bride of jesus christ he gave me a revelation there's no shame in saying this is what i am but i'm not that by me i'm that by him and i don't the life that i live now i don't live by myself amen i live by the life of the son of god who's come and lived in me please be the god that's a tactic of the devil to get us to play around with the word of god because of who we are to exalt self over the word to exalt ourselves and become proud and all of a sudden become uh seemingly in our minds untouchable i'm the bride he doesn't want me to suffer i'm the bride he wants me to be happy i'm the bride don't forget the scriptures it says if you want to reign with him you have to suffer with him amen nonsense talk like don't you think god wants you to be happy you know what i think god wants me to be right more than he wants me to be happy because true joy true happiness is found in being aligned with the word and being connected with christ amen he's not worried about my emotion of happy he's worried about my soul being right praise be to god god is good amen and going on in the same quote uh how can i overcome no servant of god is a show off of himself or try to take god's power and show himself above somebody else i love that quote i love it you remember moses did that remember that god gave him power to do whatever he wanted to do made him a prophet he walked down to that rock and he smote the rock the second time that was against god's will and god said speak to that rock don't smite it again you break all the type there the rock is only going to be smitten once but he spoke of the weakness of the word when he did that that wasn't sufficient the word was what was going on the rock was the word see and the first time he smote the rock and the waters come forth and they got thirsty again to now go back and speak to the rock it was only smitten once the insufficiency of the word moses testified to it the word wasn't right he had to be smitten again so moses went down there and smote the rock like that and said come forth didn't come forth so he smoted again he said come forth i command you to come forth and the waters come god said come up here come here you glorified yourself you took my power instead of the sanctifying me you sanctify yourself now you're not going over in the land here's moses there was none like moses moses was the was one of the greatest prophets of all time amen god used him as a deliverer god used him to bring his people to the border of the promised land give him his word amen moses was a great prophet but because he exalted himself he did not go over to the promised land because god is not playing games let's look at this in numbers chapter 20. numbers chapter 20. numbers chapter 20 and i want to read from verse 7. this is the same story numbers chapter 20 verse 7 and the lord spake unto moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beast's drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them here now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock uh oh [Music] there's the problem right there it was me he was exalting himself and aaron and he was condemning the people and he says you rebels listen me hey moses had no power it was the word of god that was going to bring forth water it was because god commissioned it god commanded it god said so and now he injects himself instead of sanctifying god he says let's go back he says here now he rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank in their beast also and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because you believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them amen moses he exalted himself in the eyes of the people and he made himself the deliverer of water he made himself the one who was able to bring water instead of pointing them to god he pointed to himself and i'll tell you any time you see a ministry that keeps pointing people back to themselves i have this gift and i have that gift and i'll teach you this and i'll tell you that and come to me for this i'll tell you we want to be pointing people to christ and say listen the word says amen the word says if we stick with the word god will do the word says god does god acts on his word the word i mean that that's the way we want to minister friends that's the way we want to live with one another that's the way we want to encourage one another and i say wait till i get there i'll come down there and i'll do this and i'll do that you just hold on till i'll get there we'll take care of this devil no you say listen let's stand upon the word and trust god to do what only god can do let's stay with what he gave us and trust him that this word will never fail god's mighty god's powerful god's never failed to keep his word god's never been defeated by any enemy leave yourself out of the picture and let it all be about him his word him working according to his word to deliver us if we can get ourselves out of the picture and give all glory to god amen we'll see god come on the scene and do what he's always promised to do amen now it goes on and in the message how can i overcome he says the third great assault satan offered to forfeit his kingdom to him he did satan said see these kingdoms of the world these are mine i do with them whatever i want to i'll forfeit them to you but remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross this is the third great assault if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom but he must he must come back he must be he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me satan he didn't do it he came and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we this morning willing to do to take the same route that he had taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to god forfeit all the world and the things to serve him so what was the third great assault the third great assault was to have victory without sacrifice he wanted to win the prize with no suffering win the prize with no sacrifice and and in this laodicean enchanted environment we live in it's people's rights and we don't want anybody to suffer nobody we don't want anybody to have a bad day so we panter to their emotions and we give in to their whims and we feed the flesh with all kinds of nonsense because people's happiness becomes the epitome of existence and nobody seemingly has the capacity to suffer anything anymore nobody has endurance i should say almost nobody because the christ seed does he tried to get christ to bypass suffering and i'll tell you friends you you just hang on the devil tries constantly to get us to bypass suffering this word the word way is a rugged way the word path is a is a self-denying difficult path to walk it'll require personal sacrifice it'll require death to self it'll require laying down your emotions amen to follow after this word amen and that goes stark against a con direct contrast to the laodicean spirit amen but the spirit of christ was willing to go through for the glory that lay ahead he was willing to follow the word and deny himself and make a sacrifice out of himself and die out completely himself to stay with that word and that brought the victory what will bring overcoming in our lives when we will deny ourselves to stay with this word when it cost us friends when it cost us relationships when it cost us peace amen when we get misunderstood and rejected for staying with the word amen nobody wants to suffer rejection nobody wants to be misunderstood everybody wants to be liked by everybody and if you're not one of those people who want to be liked by everybody then there's some disorder because everybody wants to be liked everybody wants to be loved everybody wants to be well thought of amen but to take the word way is to take the word with the lord's despised few and the devil will try one of his tactics and the temptation is try to get us to the prize without any personal sacrifice to be the bride and get all the benefits of the bride but never having to completely surrender and die to self to follow the word to get to the prize he wants us to take the title of bride pit it to ourselves keep our old lust and life and desires and not completely die out to our own thinking and our own ones amen and call ourselves bride and have the prize without the sacrifice but i tell you it does not work amen if you want to reign with them you must suffer with them you must be willing to lay it all down and it means what does it mean it means rejection it means misunderstandings it means hurt feelings it means criticism it means harsh comments oh you'll get every one of those because if you take the word the word is so contrary to man's thinking the word is so contrary to the modern era that we live in that people will think you're harsh unloving unflexible you don't care has anybody been a christian for very long you know what i'm talking about your family won't understand why you raise your children this way yeah the the people that are around you your neighbors and and co-workers and friends they they'll they'll criticize you for living the way you live they'll mock you for not being entertained by the world and because you don't know what they're talking about when they're talking about what was on tv last night when they're all laughing about something that's going around and trending on some social thing a social media thing or whatever it is and you don't know about about the latest trending two billion views of a what what i don't know i don't even really know what i'm talking about i'll show you how how good i am at this but when you're the only one in the room who doesn't know what they're talking about and they look at you like you're from outer space i say praise god if that's the worst reproach we have to bear i mean that's shameful when we have to stand in the lineup of saints that have gone before and you know peter he was crucified upside down they tried to boil james alive and and oil and and they stoned and beat paul and finally cut his head off and they say what was it like for you they made fun of me at work sometimes we can't even do that sometimes we can't even stand on the word because we don't want to be laughed at or made fun of or rejected by coworkers trying to get us to take the prize without sacrifice trying to tempt us amen to to win the prize be the bride but not have to surrender all one of the hardest things for us to lose is our reputation we guard it we protect it we defend it listen what good is your reputation i want his reputation i want to be aligned with him i want to be known as mrs jesus christ not whatever i was before let that reputation die amen let what people think of that man die amen but it's what i think of him that matters so he tried to get him to bypass bypass suffering bypass the cross and take the prize and take the kingdom and rule as the king of the world with no suffering he's going to try to get you and i to believe that we're queen that'll sit on that throne never having had to be rejected mock score and laughed at never having to surrender our own wants and give up our own ideas and cut off relationships and separate from the world and throw things away and cut off entertainment we want to keep all of that and still be a son of god and still have a right to sit in his throne that's a that's a deception of the devil but if i want to win that everlasting prize god calls for total separation from all unbelief will it hurt yes will you be misunderstood absolutely will you win the prize yes will you care when you get to the other side no you know one more quote here he says and um how can i overcome he said overcome how by taking the word the promise and humility humbly walking how can i overcome by taking the word the promise humbly walking i want to turn to daniel chapter 3 together and i want to look just a couple examples as we wind down go to the book of daniel look at daniel chapter 3. if we could turn there this is the story of the three hebrew men i corrected myself from saying three hebrew children they were they were children when they went to babylon this was some time later and if you ever meet them on the other side don't call them the three hebrew children they did grow up these are the three hebrew men shadrach meshach and abednego they have to face the trial of the the king's religion and the king's idol they want him to worship before it and they refused now they're coming before nebuchadnezzar in verse 14. he said nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i've set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the coronet the flute the harp the sack but the sultry and the dulcimer and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter they're saying we're not cautious we're not anxious we know exactly how to answer we're not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine handle king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship thy golden image which thou has set up i love this example because they're following the word the word tells them that they're not to bow before graven images here in a foreign land a powerful king you know and they're officials in the kingdom these are people who have had benefit and privilege of having an office in a position with the kingdom with nebuchadnezzar amen they're not poor they're not destitute they're they're living presumably a good life in babylon but now they come and face the word and when they come in contact with the word and a law to move them contrary to the word they refuse to bow and nebuchadnezzar gives them another chance and he says if you'll do if you'll bow amen it'll be well but if not you'll be thrown into the furnace and what god will save you then and they said we're not careful to answer you king and i want you to catch the the attitude that they have this is what i want to highlight so well they don't they don't get brazen and bold they don't start spitting threats and say you better not if you know what's good for you don't throw us in that furnace they don't say do you know who we are but when brother branham told us you overcome by taking the word and humility and humbly walk this is what these three did they knew where they stood on the word they knew this was contrary to the word of god and they were worshipers of almighty god and they were not going to bow before the image but they didn't have to stomp yell threaten they didn't have to they didn't have to petition they didn't have to do anything they were standing on the word they were already overcoming regardless of the results they were overcomers by staying with the word and they said we don't know god is able to deliver us out of the fiery furnace and he's able to deliver us from you he will deliver us from your hand but even if not like i can't guarantee your results i don't know what god will do i'm not in control of god god's word is in control of me i'm under the control of god's word god is not under my control just because i'm standing on his word i can't say god will do this and god will do that and you just wait and see and and he no we have to keep god as god and ourselves as his subjects amen and stand on his word and know that yeah god is more than able to deliver me and i believe he will deliver me from your hand but even if not we're not going to bow because i'm staying with the word if god never shows up if i never get a tingly feeling if there's no sensation if there's no seeming deliverance if all this trouble doesn't go away tomorrow i'm still standing on the word amen because i'm not in control of god i'm only controlling my surrender to this word god will do what god will do he's able i believe he will but if he doesn't i'm staying with the word if we could just have that attitude we're going to see some amazing things because god will do what god will do but god will share his glory with no one he won't share it with a ministry he won't share with a man he won't share with the church he'll get all the glory and he'll do it in such a way when you can come humble before him and say god i don't know the answer i don't know the solution i don't know how to fix this problem but i know your word says and i'm standing right with your word and i know that you will honor your word we've tried to figure out too many things and we've made too many bold proclamations god will this and god will that that's not the example we see when people start making bold proclamations in the bible usually the prophets of god and god had already showed them in a vision or told them that this is what will happen even mekiah makai was brought before ahab and jehoshaphat and he has a he has a different prophecy than the rest of the prophets amen and he's even reluctant to give it because they've already come and given him a warning they said now listen the messenger came to get makaya and said this is what's been prophesied and you just say the same thing and brother bannon said they were telling him brother mum said they were telling him if you want to get back in with the organization with the denomination you're an outsider just go along with this and you'll be accepted back but he's only going to stay with the word but look how he comes in he doesn't stomp in and start pushing himself around and making something special out of himself he comes in he knows what they want he knows what ahab wants he knows where his heart is and he says what do you say he says go on up that's what you want to do anyways it was only jehoshaphat who really wanted to know what the lord was not ahab so he looked at him so go on up he said did i not tell you to only speak to me in the name of the lord and mekiah says go up but i see israel as sheep with no shepherd he didn't start calling him names he didn't start saying do you know who i am and mackay is just standing there and then ahab has him thrown in prison and on the way out he said feeding bread of sorrow feeding this and that when i return he says if you return at all god never spoke to me now listen he never said there's no chance that you're coming back because you know who i am look at the humility if you come back at all god didn't speak to me look where he put himself it wasn't arrogant it wasn't brash it wasn't harsh it was just a man who was doing what god told him to do it was just a man not exalting himself but just exalting god and only only saying what god told him to say not adding a bunch of stuff to it not making himself a special person just saying if you do return god never spoke to me praise god i love the character that i see in the bible and i want that character to be in me let's go over to daniel chapter 6. now now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber toward jerusalem he knelt upon the knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before god as he did before time daniel now as as one of the head presidents over all the realm of darius and the medes and the persians he's got other presidents that are jealous of him and princes and they have darius sign a decree that nobody else can worship anybody else but himself amen and so so but daniel daniel didn't go storming in to the king's chamber and complain and listen new daniel is daniel is the highest ranking of three presidents that he put over his entire kingdom and he's the head of the mall and he was going to set the entire kingdom under daniel so daniel's not like you and i trying to go to the warehouse and talk to somebody knocking on the door can i have a meeting with the speaker of the house daniel that darius was going to set the whole kingdom under daniel's rule he had the whole kingdom divided amongst three presidents and daniel was the leader of them all he could have got an audience with darius he could have he could have pleaded his case he could have made a good case amen no doubt he was wiser than them all the reason he was exalted and god had given supernatural wisdom he could have made him look like fools but he didn't do anything this was this was attacking the word of god and his worship to god amen they were attacking god so he just went and did what he always did he didn't change his routine one drop he said when it was written and signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber he didn't say well watch me you say i can't listen i'll tell you you stay away from all this right wing news media garbage because they're they're they're messing up people's minds making you violent and bold and brash amen to fight against this and fight against liberalism and fight against that amen daniel never never made a protest to darius he just kept serving god the way he always served god he didn't have to yell he didn't have to storm around he didn't have to start a petition he didn't have to start a news media outlet he didn't have to start blogs all he did was went in and his windows already being open you know they didn't go to have a prayer vigil on the capitol steps he just did what he always did and he prayed and he prayed towards the east because that was the commandment that he was given and solomon in his prayer and the dedication of the temple asked god to hear every prayer and daniel believed it and he went back to prayer submitting to the word of god humbly serving god and never raising a fuss about it one drop in verse 19 it says they they arrested him the king could not change his decree it was the laws of the medes and persians he could not change so he had daniel thrown in the lion's den made a sleepless night for him but he comes in the morning in verse 19 he says then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste into the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice and to daniel and the king spake and said to daniel oh daniel servant of the living god and this thy god is thy god whom thou serve us continually able to deliver thee from the lions then said daniel unto the king o king live forever my god has sinned his angel and has shut the lion's mouths and they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before the o king have i done no hurt the question was that daniel did you overcome the question was daniel was your god abraham to deliver you and he said my god sent his angel and shut the lion's mouth it wasn't about daniel it was about god it wasn't daniel's victory daniel overcame by standing with the word when he stood with the word god stood with daniel god shut the mouths of the lions god gave him victory and god gave him the ability to overcome daniel couldn't have done anything to change his situation what could the three hebrew men do amen to keep themselves from being burnt in the fire they had no power they had no ability they could not change their circumstance only god could deliver them from that circumstance daniel there was nothing daniel can do and there was nothing daniel tried to do he just submitted himself and if god wanted him eaten by lions he would be eaten by lions listen we do too much self-preservation and we try to figure out what god wants too much and say there's no way god would want this and there's no way god would allow that and god doesn't want me to go through this and god doesn't want this to happen to me stop doing god's thinking for him and let god be god and let god do his own thinking and make his own decision about what he'll do with you he said there's no way god would let that happen to me how do you know god let daniel get thrown in the lion's den he led his three hebrew children he let jeremiah be thrown in the pit he let isaiah be sawn in half he let peter be hung upside down he let paul be beat amen with rods beat with whips he'd be stoned and left for dead he let him be shipwrecked a couple times he let him be chased from city to city what do you mean god doesn't want that to happen to you god won't let that to happen to you he's let it happen to every other christian that's come down through the ages what do you mean you know god doesn't want that to happen to you i know god doesn't want me to suffer this way i know god doesn't want this to happen to me how do you know and how dare you say that you know what god's thinking just say god if this is what you want then here i am i can't deliver myself i can't save myself i can't change the circumstances i'm totally completely in your hands i'll tell your friends if we could just stop taking things in their own hands and fall completely into his hands and let god work these things out stop assuming that we know what he wants i know he wants this and i know he wants that i was talking to another brother and i was sharing with him when i was preaching and he says you know he started referring to brother brandon brother branham is standing in the prayer line he calls the prayer line he advertises a healing meeting he calls the prayer line people are ready to come and he says now you know i'm waiting on something. now i can't say that he will come i can't say that he will come listen he had a commission from an angel to take a gift of healing to the people of the world he was working in that commission but even with an angel commissioning him to take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world he still could not control god he didn't say god's going to come on this pulpit in five minutes god's coming down you better run to this altar because god's going to come and meet you at this altar you never hear brother bam saying something like that you never you say you see him humbly saying now i don't know that will come i'm waiting you know i'm waiting on something now he's here he couldn't control god all he could do was stay in the commission all he could do is stay obedient all he could do was be reverent be humble and be in his commission and do what the angel told him to do god was going to have to do the rest brother bam said i'm not the one that that tells you those things it's him i don't know you you haven't touched me you touched the high priest he was leaving himself out of it as much as he possibly could i don't know that will come now he's come he brother said he's met me here thousands of times but he had no guarantee that he was going to meet him there again he was just trusting that he would and acting in faith that he would i want that attitude i want to stop telling what god's going to do and just start controlling myself to line up to that word and trust god to do the rest will he deliver you i don't know but i believe he will amen will he deliver you that sickness i don't know god has a plan but i believe he will because i believe his word and if god ever tells you that he has supernatural you say he's already healed me it's done it's finished and get up and walk away but if not just take him on his word and say by his stripes i'm already healed and just keep walking how do you overcome take his word take his promise and humbly walk amen don't don't become the controller of god and don't make god your servant who has to come at your beck and call but become the servant of god that comes at his beck and call that moves upon his word his commandment that surrenders to him and trust him to do the rest he's done it for moses he did it for david he did it for daniel he did it for shadrach meshach and abednego he did it for micaiah he did it for jeremiah why wouldn't he do it for you we have to stay humble and surrendered brother says again and how can i overcome he says jesus told us how to do it he overcome overcome means to stand the test to stand the test that's right like the old saints did jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word he said you destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days the word said so and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example he defeated everything he overcome it how did he overcome it by the by the word and humility we've talked many times about him standing in in the court a pilot standing on trial a mockery of a trial and he stood there silent because he knew it was the will of god and even when pilate slipped up and said you know i have power to save your life and i have power to take your life and all jesus said was you the only power you have is what's been given to you from above so if you have power to take my life it's because god gave it to you can we believe the same thing if you have power to take my life it's given to you from above if you have the power to throw me in jail it's given to you from above if you have the power to arrest me and imprison me it's given to you from above because i'm in the hands of god and i belong to god i'm not my own i've been bought by a price i belong to him and if he sees fit that i need in this journey to spend some time here or there or in this situation what am i going to do to change it but i'm going to stand on the word and keep believing him and i'm going to overcome by believing the word and staying with the word brother branham in this message how can i overcome he begins to talk about the palm lily and brother broom talks about the pawn lily in so many different sermons and he talks about there was a pond lily in the little pond that they drained where they built the the tabernacle branham tabernacle set there was a little pond and he always went by and he he admired the pond lily it was one of his favorite plants and one of his favorite flowers and he begins to talk about how it comes out of the muck under the dark dank uh uh pond under the stagnant waters in the muck laying in the mud at the bottom but it begins to climb its way to the light until it breaks forth out of the water amen and it begins to bloom and he said it's so beautiful after it blooms you couldn't imagine where it started from and he starts to type this to the believer and he says he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now if you look back you're condemned when you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that's in you has led you above the darkness like the lily he's above the darkness of the mud he's above the darkness of the muddy waters he's in the light reflecting the beauty that was put in him before he left the mud down in the mud in the seed was a beauty that he had to reflect it was already there when he was down under the water buried in the mud there was already a beautiful lily on the inside of that seed but it had to go through the process of climbing towards the sun moving towards the word of god and as it moved it began to become more like what it was on the inside and it began to reflect what was down inside of it and it came into the picture an image of a lily then it popped out and in the face of the sun it began to reflect what was inside of it already and he types that with you and i as the believer and he said you cannot look back it meant to where you came from any time you look back to the mud and the muck and the mire we came from you get condemned but you can only look to where you're going amen only look to what you're pointed to we all came from all kinds of situations from mud and muck but inside the seed that was in the mud and the muck was something that god wanted to display the reflection of his beauty and it was already there so don't look back at the muck look look at the sun and keep climbing to the side and following that word and as that word comes to manifestation it'll bring all the life that was trapped in that seed out he begins to type this with the believers we've been talking about in the old testament he says now i feel like a shouting christian what was it there by god at the beginning it pressed its way through overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome the waters it overcome everything and was an overcomer and reflecting the beauty and glory of god how did that lily overcome there was a life trapped down inside that when sun hit it it began to move towards the sun towards the word how did it overcome kept moving towards the sun how will we overcome keep moving towards the sun stay with the word move towards the word until the word produces what's already inside of you comes out to reflect the life that was trapped inside what do i do to overcome keep walking in the word and become what you were always meant to become he said it overcome everything it was an overcomer and reflected the beauty and glory of god that's the way every believer does that's the way noah did that's the way lot did that's the way look what a mess he was in that's the way moses did that's the way joshua did that's the way daniel did that's the way shadrach meshach and abednego did that's the way john the baptist did zacharias elizabeth that's the way simeon that's the way anna every one of them did they overcome the mud that they were around them and packed into them stuck their head above the thing and shine forth the glory of god that's what a real christian does what do i do just keep stretching towards the light just keep moving how did little little lily overcome buried in mud buried in the pond how it had no chance amen of ever being anything buried that deep below the surface of the water and in the mind except there was a seed inside and the word the light began to pull it and what you and i are to become was in us in our soul from before the foundation of the world and the light of the word is beginning to pull us keep walking in the light we don't have to figure out how it's going to happen how will i get to this how will i overcome that stay with the word our overcoming is in the word stay with the word stay in the light god will take care of the rest remember joshua now joshua is now commissioned to carry the children of israel over jordan and into the promised land and they've already got spies that went in some 40 years before and warned everybody joshua's already been in there he's seen the walled cities he's seen the giants he's seen the armament he's seen it all and now he's standing at the banks of jordan and now it's his job to cross jordan and to go into the promised land but he's got no idea how to get this army across that river but god provides a way he's in the line of duty but he doesn't know how to do it he could try you know manufacturing some sort of planking system and a bridge but god's already got a plan if it just holds steady and wait god has a way across and then they come to the first big city of jericho amen brother branham said they could have chariot races around the walls they were so thick amen there was no way that they could take it down but god said just just walk around it once a day for six days and on the seventh day go around it seven times hey you know i'm no general i'm no architect i'm nothing but there's no way that walking around a building is going or walking around a city is going to bring the walls down you realize the plan that god gave him the word that god gave him didn't seem sufficient to take care of the obstacle that was ahead the obstacle was a walled city impenetrable with no way to get over it no way to get through it but yet they had to take it out to go to the rest of the promised land and the word that god gave them to overcome that obstacle seemed completely insufficient you have a walled city what i want you to do is go take the army and walk around it and be real quiet don't say anything and then what nothing just go back to camp the next day you walk around it and be real quiet and then what do we do nothing go back to camp six days seventh day walk around it seven times and on the last time blow the trumpets and everybody shout for the mastery for the victory okay we'll do it you realize there was no logical explanation in the commandment to explain how they were going to get into that city but jo it wasn't joshua's responsibility to figure out how the walls were going to come down it was joshua's responsibility to keep the word of god sometimes we wonder you know how is it that doing all of these things that god told us to do how will it help me overcome this situation or that situation it's not us to figure out how the walls are going to come down and how deliverance will come god will take care of that the three hebrew men they couldn't figure out how they were going to be delivered daniel didn't know how he was going to be delivered no moses didn't know how they were going to get across the red sea he nobody knew how they were going to do it all they knew was the word that they were given and they walked according to that word and when they walked according to that word god provided the deliverance god has given us his word in this day amen and we're constantly trying to solve our own problems and figure out how to overcome these obstacles what we need to do is back up and just say god i'm standing with the word that you gave through a prophet i'm doing all that you told me to do and i'm trusting you to do the rest and i don't know how you'll do it i can't even envision how you'll do it so i have no suggestions because you know what happens if you suggest something in prayer and then god does it that way you said i said in prayer and we exalt ourselves again but it's better to come and say god i have no answers i have no way around this i don't have a clue what i'm doing but i'm standing on your word and i've done as far as i know i've done everything that your prophet told me to do and i'm staying as faithful as i know how to stay to your word and now i'm trusting you to bring deliverance to bring healing to bring whatever we need amen i'm trusting you to do it that's the approach that i want to have i want to read one more scripture out of exodus let's turn together to exodus 14. and we'll finish with this exodus 14. exodus 14 and 13. they're out of egypt marching to the promised land going out singing and dancing and rejoicing and they hit their first obstacle which is the red sea then pharaoh sends his army out after them to destroy them and they begin to panic and they begin to get excited and they begin to chastise moses and say why have you let us out here this is not what we told you let us stay in bondage with the egyptians lest we die in the wilderness and moses responds before god speaks anything to him moses responds and says and moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever and the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace stand still what i want to say is moses didn't have the solution yet he just knew what god had told him that he was going to bring him to this land that they were going to go worship on that mountain he didn't know the solution he didn't know how yet god hadn't told him to take the rod and hold it up all he knew was that god would not fail on his word that we're to go worship on mount sinai but he knew that he didn't have power to deliver them and he did not have the solution to the problem but he knew who did and he says verse 14 the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace when you've done all that god asked you to do and you still have no answers don't make up answers don't pretend that you know what to do when you don't know what to do don't become so bold that you start making declarations that god didn't tell you to do and you have no permission to do just stand and say god you've called me to this life you've called me to this word and i'm standing on this word and i'm in the line of duty and lord i'm trusting you to fight for me and deliver me i'm going to hold my peace until i see what you do and then i'm going to be on the other side of the red sea with a tambourine singing and dancing and talking about the great victory that you just brought because i didn't even know what to do we got family situations we have personal situations work situations all kinds of situations that we don't have the solution to but what we've been given is the word and the word is enough and if we'll stand with the word and have faith in god and stand still and watch god fight for us and have confidence in him i believe we'll see the hand of god over and over and over again what's the way to walk stay with the word and walk humbly and let's all stand musicians if you could come please brother ben if you'll come forward please i don't know why god will not give me permission to leave this subject submission and humility and surrender amen but there's a reason friends there's a reason it's a constant every wednesday and every sunday for several weeks now a reminder that if you want to go up you must go down if you want something from god you must surrender to him that is he's not looking for an arrogant bold nature he's looking for a humble submissive nature so that he can be the great one among us i said god help me help me to forsake all my thinking and just trust in you amen praise god let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word for the things that your prophet has taught us lord the wiles and the trappings of the devil and the temptation and how we always use those three those three methods lord help us to guard against it by staying with your word god forgive us lord for our wonderings forgive us for taking things in their own hand and coming up with their own solutions sorry god and i just pray father that you would help us to walk humbly before you to surrender ourselves to your word to stay with the word and have confidence that you will work the supernatural the miraculous that you will be powerful and you will be our deliverer for we have complete confidence in you so much so that we can lay ourselves in your hand and take our hands off and know that you'll do better than we could lord we love you we thank you for your word may it live inside of us may it change us may we become more like you every day may we handle situations the way you would handle them may we respond the way you responded lord may we be obedient the way you were obedient and submissive the way you were submissive and humble like you were humble for god you're looking for a bride to reflect your character that we might be on this earth all that you were and all that you are help us god to surrender we love you and we thank you for helping us we ask that you would bless us now as we go from here lord i pray that you bless our fellowship we'll partake of in a few minutes may we encourage one another in the word and in fellowship lord may we may we boost one another up and love one another may we go out of here encourage lord in the word to keep walking lord to be an overcomer to obtain all the promises by overcoming help us lord i pray we surrender to you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you we remind you of the fellowship immediately after the service in the fellowship hall it sounds like it's going to be wet outside but we'll just pack in and have a close fellowship in the fellowship hall god bless you all let's sing [Music] [Music] we [Music] we [Music] [Music] by the blood of the lamb man i was thinking about the hebrew the hebrew men the fiery furnace and daniel jeremiah and isaiah david and moses i was thinking of all of them and then i was thinking of jesus christ and paul in his trial and his arrest in his trial one thing you notice in all of these men is they don't get excited there's no record in the bible that they were fearful and running around and going from person to person to try to get an answer and get help and get support you don't see where they were anxious and nervous and they knew god was going to take care of them they knew who they were and they knew who god was and that was enough i was like that's what i want i don't want to face every situation and get nervous and run around and try to get a solution from somebody and an answer from somebody i just want to know who i am and i want to know who god is and i want that to be enough i want to know that i i am his child and i've surrendered to him and i'm living the life he's called me to live and trusting that he'll do everything else so that i don't have to get nervous or fearful amen moses was the first one says fear ye not don't be afraid the egyptians are coming the red sea is here i don't have the answer but don't be afraid where are we going to go i don't know how will we survive i don't know well i i don't see there's cliffs here there's water here there's an egyptian army here it looks like imminent death but but moses at that time says fear ye not don't be afraid and i want to get to that place to have that much confidence in god to not only know who god is but know who i am in christ and say i don't know what he's going to do but he's going to do something and whatever he does it's going to be amazing and i'm going to give him all the glory let's be confident let's be let's have some peace about us and not get anxious and nervous every time something goes wrong but relax and say god has always been god and he's always saved his people this isn't his first day on the job and i'm not his first child i can relax and trust in him and let him solve all of my problems amen let's act like we're growing up in the lord let's act like we're maturing in the word let's act like the believers of old let's be the believers of today amen god bless you let's sing as you dismissed [Music]
