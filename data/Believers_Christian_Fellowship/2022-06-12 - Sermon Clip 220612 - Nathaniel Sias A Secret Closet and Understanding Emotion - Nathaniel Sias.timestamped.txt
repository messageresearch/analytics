[0:00] you know why we have emotion because god
[0:02] made us that way
[0:06] but when satan comes along
[0:09] and he offers you something that looks
[0:12] like an experience with god
[0:15] but it's actually just a motion
[0:18] you just experienced a bait and switch
[0:24] well i wanted god
[0:27] but what i got was emotion
[0:29] well how do we know
[0:31] look at what it produces
[0:34] look at what it produced we just read in
[0:36] the beginning of service because
[0:38] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[0:39] way which leadeth unto life he's saying
[0:41] it's not an easy thing to find
[0:47] and he says beware of false prophets
[0:50] they'll come in in this way
[0:52] they'll come in with a lot of emotion
[0:54] oh but brother i feel this must be god
[0:58] give it the word test
[1:00] right we've learned that haven't we can
[1:02] we say amen to that we've learned to
[1:04] give it the word test everything we do
[1:06] we give ourselves we give everything
[1:08] else give it the word test
[1:11] i i think that's god i think it is well
[1:13] brother i know when god speaks to me oh
[1:16] do you really
[1:18] how about when the prophet of god was
[1:19] flying and and god grounded his plane
[1:22] and he's standing there he's going down
[1:23] the street god is that you and there's a
[1:25] policeman on the other side he stops and
[1:27] he looks in the window and he's
[1:28] embarrassed because he's just wandering
[1:29] around and he's there he's praying he
[1:31] says lord is that you
[1:33] the prophet of god who's spoken to god
[1:35] many many many times he's saying lord is
[1:37] that you
[1:41] if he questioned himself why would we
[1:43] not
[1:45] why do you think he shared that
[1:46] testimony with us
[1:48] that we might make that moment and
[1:51] verify it lord is this you because if
[1:54] it's just emotion the destination is
[1:57] going to be a motion
[1:59] it's going to be a zeal it's going to be
[2:01] a passion it's going to be a pride of
[2:03] life
[2:04] yes i am going to achieve
[2:07] or are you
[2:09] because if god chooses to have us fail
[2:11] we will fail
[2:13] but when we get to the point where i
[2:14] said lord i don't know what is up and
[2:16] what is down i don't know which way to
[2:18] go i want to be confident but lord i
[2:20] don't even know where to be confident
[2:22] but lord would you teach me
[2:24] he says oh
[2:26] my son my daughter
[2:28] i've just been waiting for you to ask
