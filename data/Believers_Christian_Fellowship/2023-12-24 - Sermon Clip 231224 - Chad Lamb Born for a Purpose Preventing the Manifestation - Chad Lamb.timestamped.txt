[0:00] you remember the prophecy you heard in
[0:02] Isaiah 7 a virgin shall conceive yeah
[0:04] I've heard it all my life it was a
[0:05] Sunday School uh uh memory verse that I
[0:08] I got a star on my chart from
[0:11] remembering and Gabriel says that's
[0:14] you you're that scripture Isaiah was
[0:17] talking about you God had you in mind
[0:19] before the found I mean that may not be
[0:21] the dialogue that took place but that
[0:23] was the point of the
[0:25] conversation and now this little girl
[0:28] she had to come to terms with the fact
[0:30] that she was the word yeah Amen in her
[0:35] flesh is going to be the manifestation
[0:38] of that word that word was speaking
[0:39] about her she is the manifestation that
[0:42] word is going to come to light and bear
[0:45] light in her
[0:47] flesh and you know what because she's a
[0:50] seed of God she believed it amen she had
[0:52] some questions she had some concerns but
[0:54] after talking to the angel amen the
[0:57] angel told her you're it and she
[0:59] believed it she received it you know
[1:01] what she became she became the light of
[1:03] her
[1:04] hour is that right she was the word made
[1:07] manifest she was light and that light
[1:09] can bring life and now she finds out
[1:11] she's got a cousin and that cousin also
[1:14] has a word inside of her amen a
[1:16] predestinated word in her because
[1:18] there's a prophecy in Malachi 3 there's
[1:21] a prophecy in Isaiah of one that will
[1:23] prepare the way of the Lord that make
[1:25] straight his path there's a word now
[1:27] that word is laying in Elizabeth
[1:30] we're on the same page now her cousin
[1:32] Elizabeth has the word in her now Mary
[1:35] has the word in her that's been
[1:37] quickened to life the problem is
[1:39] Elizabeth has not felt the quickening
[1:41] power yet this word is laying there dead
[1:43] in her womb that's right the word is in
[1:46] her but the word has no life it's dead
[1:48] brother man said she never felt the baby
[1:50] kick yet it was dead it was 6 months she
[1:53] was starting to get
[1:57] concerned I love the word of God
[2:02] God no doubt she had
[2:05] prayed God I don't feel anything you
[2:08] promised in your word amen your your
[2:10] angel said to Zachariah amen we we know
[2:14] that this is the the the one that's
[2:16] coming and I don't feel anything there's
[2:18] no change in my life I it feels dead
[2:20] like it's not alive amen and and she
[2:23] could pray she could ask Zachariah to
[2:24] pray they may even fast and pray amen
[2:27] but what is it going to take it's going
[2:28] to take that little verse virgin girl
[2:30] with the word awake inside of her the
[2:32] manifested word for her day when she
[2:34] comes in contact with Elizabeth and she
[2:37] begins to declare the message that she
[2:39] received that this I'm blessed of the
[2:41] Lord I'm going to have a baby his name
[2:43] is Jesus and when she heard that word
[2:45] that had come to life and and and and
[2:48] Mary the word in Mary that was alive
[2:50] brought the word laying dormant in
[2:52] Elizabeth and it sprung to life life
[2:55] came to life word came to word
[2:57] manifested word came to promised word
[2:59] and sprung to life in her wound and
[3:01] started leaping and jumping around you
[3:04] think your testimony doesn't do anything
[3:06] it's your testimony that brings
[3:11] life amen you're not just here to take
[3:14] up space you're not just here to breathe
[3:16] oxygen in and out you're not just here
[3:18] to retire and have a retirement you're
[3:20] here to testify of the truth that's why
[3:23] we were born we have been born and we've
[3:25] come into this life to testify of the
[3:27] truth so that the truth in US being
[3:30] manifest can bring a seed that's laying
[3:32] dormant somewhere else to
[3:35] life let it be
[3:38] Christmas all over
[3:41] again
