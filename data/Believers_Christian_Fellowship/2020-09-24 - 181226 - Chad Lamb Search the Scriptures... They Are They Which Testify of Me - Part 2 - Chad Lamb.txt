TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you oh my soul [Laughter] make me a sweet sweet sound in your ear may it be a sweet sweet sound oh maybe [Music] praise praise the lord while we're standing now let's take our bibles praise god it's good to have you all here and see your lovely faces and we know we still got quite a few people traveling and visiting family and i trust you had a good christmas season a good time to visit family and be together and now we're back together amen again we look forward to hearing the word again tonight god was certainly good to us on sunday we just appreciate that i'd like to continue in the same thought i'd like to take part two on sunday's message so just bear with me and we'll see where we get to and see what god will do amen amen let's turn to john chapter 5. john chapter 5 and we'll start reading there i also want to remind everybody that we've got watch night service next or this coming monday this coming monday night so if you have a special you'd like to sing we still have room for some more so if you'd like to see brother mike bauer and let him know and he'll keep that coordinated for us also we're going to serve communion at the end of the evening and so just keep that in mind also last year last time we did the watch tonight what we did is we let all the parents with the little toddlers if you'd like to get them in bed clothes and bring them a blanket or a sleeping bag and a pillow you're more than welcome to we know it's hard on the little fellas and you might as well let them sleep and like we said last time we want to see moms and dads and grandparents and pillows and sleeping bags and pajamas but the little toddlers amen would be wonderful and then you can just carry them out to the car and take them home and put them in bed it'd be a long night for those guys so also i wanted to let everybody know and get you up to speed on sister miriam dean harp was it there was a prayer request the sunday before last about her stepfather amos wrestler and and brother amos passed away last week they had a memorial service on friday sister barbara rissler his sister miriam's mom she had been single for quite a number of years and she was actually married to amos wrestler's brother so if you can keep this straight in your head a long time ago she was married to amos's brother while she was still young and with young children she had babies and diapers at the time her husband passed away and sister barbara lived alone all of those years well her brother-in-law amos he lived with his wife and several years ago his wife passed away and as god would have it the two of them came together and she ended up marrying her husband's brother many many many years later 30 some years later and she only got to be with him for just under two years and so now she's alone again so i know that she would cover your prayers and i know that it'd be good if we could just hold her up in prayer they had a memorial service this past friday down in evening light and they're going to bring his body up this weekend to hershey pennsylvania for a burial that's where he's originally from from so i know the family will be out there the dean hart family so pray for them pray for traveling mercies pray for sister barbara especially and then all the children amen so let's look here at john chapter 5 verse 39. search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me that was our title for last time we're going to take this in part two this time let's just bow our heads in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this time that we have together again and lord we just want to lift up our sister miriam before you and her family her children brother tim as they're traveling and her mother sister barbara we just as a church want to pray for sister barbara that you would just comfort her at this time and be with her be very close to her lord let her feel your very presence lord and know that you are a very present help in a time of trouble i pray to bless all of the siblings lord and all the children that you would just bring them together and there would be such a rejoicing lord over the life that our brother amos was able to live for you lord i pray that you would take what is meant for evil and turn it for good lord and what is discouraging and disappointing and lord that you would show up on the scene and you would make it a wonderful time lord in your presence well we pray for traveling mercies for them brother tim and sister miriam as they travel back after this weekend lord we pray for us tonight lord that we would just get in the spirit lord that all the things all the all the activities all the traveling all the things we've participated in the last few days lord that it wouldn't make us tired lord but we would come here tonight lord with a zeal lord with a fresh fervent desire to hear from you lord not sluggish in our bodies and not maybe sluggish in our spotties but not sluggish in our spirit lord but that you would rejuvenate us by your word lord and you would pour into us all that we have need of to overcome in this hour we give you preeminence i pray to take these lips of clay that you yourself lord would take control and speak your eternal words we give you all the glory and all the praise in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated as you're seated if you could turn to john chapter 10. god bless you brother larry it's good to have you back brother larry just made a trip to mississippi at the passing of his mom so we've been praying for him and we're glad he's back safely with us so continue to hold him up in prayer as well john chapter 10 verse 30 i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him amen a statement that makes us rejoice in the day that he was there talking to the jews was a statement that made them so angry amen they called it so blasphemous they thought it was such heresy such blasphemy that they would take up stones to stone him and all he was doing was telling the truth he said i and my father are one amen and he was telling exactly the truth by the revelation that he had he could place himself in the scriptures he had he had no spiritual amnesia amen amen we have come into this life with a spiritual amnesia but god has sent his word and that word is to break that spiritual amnesia off of us so that we would realize who we really are where we come from where we're going what our purpose is here on this life you know we talked about last week brother branham got to the point in communion he said i realized i as i am not the child of charles and ella branham amen and it doesn't matter what names we read on our birth certificate that's a record of a natural birth amen but that's not our beginning amen our beginning was not when we were birthed from a human womb on this earth that wasn't our beginning because we were with him before the foundation of the world amen if not we cannot already have eternal life but that eternal life is his own life which was with him before the foundation of the world amen and we come into the life of spiritual amnesia and the word is breaking away that amnesia so we can start to see i see who i am amen and i'm seeing brother branham said this bible is a mirror a mirror a mirror amen and we've used that so many times amen so we can look into the mirror and see what's wrong and fix it in ourselves and evangelists have used that amen but no longer that's the way i want to look at this i'm looking in the mirror to see who i really am my true identity is placed right here in the bible and when it reflects back i can say hey there i am there in that scripture and i'm there in that scripture and i'm there i mean like we talked about sunday in the story of ruth amen the gentile woman who's coming back and her first husband is dead hey we're a gentile woman in that first adam nature has to die and it's dead amen and now we're going to be married to the kinsmen redeemer amen i look in there and say that's me that's a story about me right now i'm part of this story that's not about people amen who lived thousands of years ago that story is about the bride today that's about this this many member body going on right now so the word come to break our spiritual amnesia but jesus christ was never in spiritual amnesia i mean remember as a 12 year old boy he was disputing with them in the temple and they were astonished and they were amazed at the things this 12 year old boy was telling them amen and mary and joseph had taken a day's journey and they had left and three days later they find him they return back to jerusalem and they find him and she looks at him and she says thy father and i have salty with tears here's a 12 year old boy that does not have spiritual amnesia because she just said thy father claiming joseph as his father and joseph was not his father and here he is he corrects her but he corrects her from a standpoint of perfect vision he says did you not know that i must be about my father's business he knew exactly who his father was and he knew what his father's business was and he knew what his purpose on this earth was and here he is he's portraying the word as a 12 year old boy hallelujah so now he comes to the place where the the pharisees amen god it's always the preachers who are fighting jesus i mean it the the harlot and the prostitute and and the tax collector and the fishermen and they're the ones not having a problem in fact the common people heard him gladly and his popularity was so great then when he got on that little donkey and come riding into in jerusalem everybody the multitudes the masses of people were screaming hosanna throwing down palm leaves amen as he made his grand entrance into jerusalem so it wasn't the problem with the common people the problem was with the preachers and it was the preachers who got these same people who were shouting hosanna and throwing palm leaves they talked they got them a few days later they were able to convince them to cry out to crucify him crucify him crucified it wasn't the desire of the people it was the deception of the preachers because the people were excited about his ministry the people were excited about the gift that was in him they were shouting hosanna to the king and just a few days later they were crying crucify him why what changed it was the preachers brother branham said what got him in trouble was hanging around with a bunch of preachers not that we don't love preachers we love preachers that stay true to the word and don't fight against the word of god amen so here jesus is fighting with the the preachers again the ones who ought to know better and he says i and my father are one they should have known that to be the case they should have known that's what he would say when emmanuel was present when god with us comes amen they should have known that this child that would be born would be god in flesh amen and he said i and my father are one and the jews took up stones again to stone him so i wanted to look at this scripture for a minute and something brother branham said because i made the statement search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and i said you know that's a statement that the bride can make now now i believe that brian can say search the scriptures they are they that testify me look at esther look at ruth look at rebecca look at rahab look at asin now look i mean look at look at all of these characters these women down through the bible and what you're going to see is a type of the bride in every one of them amen so here here's what brother branham said not about that scripture but about this one i and my father were one and he says in the seed is not heir with the shock but when you come to say i and my father are one what are you saying the same thing jesus said on that day amen when our spiritual amnesia broke away to the point where you can say i and my father are one and these other things then the shock pulls away from it what's the shock the shock was the religious amen the religion the former teaching that was protecting the seed as it come through amen but when the seed finally got to the point where it come to maturity enough that it could say amen it could realize that the ministry of christ and the ministry of bride is the same thing and when they begin to realize the ministry of bride the mystery of christ is the same thing they begin to declare it and the shock begins to pull away and the i and my father want and these other things what other things i preached the whole sermon on it this year on one of these other things but like she is the only provided place of worship you say what do you mean she is christ is the only provided place of worship that's true amen christ is the only provided place of worship but where is christ he said in that day that's i in you and you and me so where is he he's in you so if you're going to be in the provided place of worship you have to be in christ where is christ i'm in you then where are you you're in christ and that's the provided place of worship so where is christ he's in you i'm in you you're in me i don't know about you but that makes it the same place to me so when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things then the shock pulls away from it hallelujah let's turn to first corinthians chapter two together first corinthians chapter 2 verse 6. first corinthians 2 and 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect so this is not wisdom among them that are imperfect this is only wisdom to them that are perfect and perfect means complete or fully mature so this wisdom is to those who are perfect however we speak wisdom unto them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god and a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god so it's the spirit that's searching not the mind of a man it's not the intellect of a man that's searching out the things of god so we've started bible studies and we've started all kinds of commentaries on the scriptures and seminaries to try to search out the deep things of god but the mind of a man cannot search out the deep things of god amen it's the spirit of god that searches out the deep things of god hallelujah let's read that again but god hath revealed them unto us by the spirit revealed key word revealed without revelation you'll never get it much study cannot produce revelation they are revealed unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things have gone that's why if you have the spirit of god amen the spirit of god loves the word and the spirit of god searches out the deep things of the word that's why it's a total cop-out to me when somebody says oh i never get it i'll never understand it i don't need to understand it i'm just going to say i believe it the spirit searches out the deep things it doesn't mean you have to understand everything but the spirit says i want to know amen i want to know my lord i want to know what's available amen i want to know not an intellectual but the spirit searches all things yay the deep things of god it's the spirit that's driving us back to the tapes the spirit that's driving us into the word the spirit that says i want to know more that was wonderful show me more what you showed me yesterday was great i want to see more of you there's none of this i don't need to know i'm just going to come to church sing a few songs tune out when the preacher gets too complicated and i'm going to walk out the door because i don't want to know the spirit searches out the deep things it doesn't mean we're always going to get it there's a lot of things we don't get but the spirit is searching out the deep things the mysteries what was in his mind brother branham come to give us amen the back part of god's mind what it laid in mystery all through the bible god hadn't let this out there was a mysterious deep mystery that was running through the whole bible amen and he come at the opening of the seals which made his bible a brand new book hallelujah what was it the spirit was longing amen many prophets and wise men have longed to see this day because the spirit is searching the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god there you go the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god without the spirit it doesn't matter how many degrees you can tackle to the end of your name how how much greek or hebrew or whatever we can study you don't know nothing unless it's spiritually revealed you know greek words you know hebrew word you know memorization of scripture you know proper punctuation we know all of this stuff but that cannot bring revelation and without revelation there's still no knowing amen even though the things of god knoweth no man let's not contradict the scripture the things of god knoweth no man hallelujah but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ amen revelation is the key hallelujah that's why brother graham said above all things pray for revelation and pray we don't strain we don't push ourselves into something amen we just we just stay in the word and stay in the word and pray for revelation and revelation is a funny thing and revelation is not the kind of thing that you push and push and push and push and push and you say you got it revelation is that kind of thing where you just feed and feed and feed and feed and feed and feed and feed and all of a sudden there's one little click bang amen not through straining not through trying amen not when you've been on your knees sweating and out but sometimes mowing the grass or driving a car or listening to a tape or listening to a preacher preach all of a sudden feeding feed we labor to feed we don't labor to understand we labor to feed and all sudden click amen one little click sometimes the tiniest little switch in our mind taking us from a natural understanding to a spiritual understanding then all of a sudden it's like the dominoes begin to fall click click click click click click click amen because it's given by the spirit amen not it's not it's not man given it's not understood by the intellect of a man but it's spiritually discerned so we labor to feed amen not to give ourselves revelation we labor to feed and god's the one that gives revelation hallelujah revelation is a funny thing let's turn to john chapter 3. the gospel of john chapter 3. that's why jesus could say father i thank you you've hid this from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed it unto babes praise the lord i'm glad i'm not wise and prudent but i'm glad i'm one of his babes one of his children one of his offspring amen praise the lord john chapter 3 verse 1. there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him so we know nicodemus is a ruler amongst the jews he's a pharisee we also know he's on the sanhedrin because then they were talking about taking counsel of what to do with jesus it was nicodemus who tried to stand up for him so he says that we know we know that thou art a man that come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him so there is a knowledge that he had amen but he still had no revelation he had an understanding he could see that you come from god but no revelation and verse three says jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god now when we start to get into the way that jesus has dialogue with people it starts to twist our minds in the knot because nicodemus come by night he came to jesus by night and said unto him all he said is rabbi we know are a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou do us except god be with him now nicodemus was probably expecting jesus to say thank you i appreciate that you're recognizing that and and god bless you and you've done a good thing for but jesus doesn't address anything nicodemus says he doesn't refer to the statement of nicodemus he goes right to the heart and he says jesus answered and said verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born now he's asking a very reasonable very logical question but jesus is not speaking reasonably and logically and he doesn't want nicodemus to think reasonably or logically he wants him to think spiritually there's a different spiritual reason a different spiritual logic that's totally different than that of man and nicodemus says how can this happen and jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again now now we wouldn't blame nicodemus for marveling because this is a new term nicodemus had studied his bible how many years has he read the old testament read the law read the prophets read the psalms read the proverbs read it all and and he's never heard this term you must be born again this is new it's just been laid down on him and he's got his degrees and he's come up through his education he's on the sanhedrin he's a ruler he's not a rookie he's not a beginner and now he's like this is a new term you must be born again and jesus doesn't explain it jesus expects him to get it amen sometimes jesus doesn't explain things he just expects his children to get it and then he's not here to make it enticing and appealing to the intellect these things are spiritually discerned and given of the spirit and he's not here to explain it to nicodemus he's sitting here all he came to do the only thing jesus came to do on this earth was to seek and to save that which was lost his ministry would seek and save that which was lost and what was he doing he was throwing out his word and he was finding those that had spiritual discernment to catch what was going on and sometimes they couldn't intellectually put it together at all just like peter peter couldn't put it together amen but peter caught a revelation that didn't come from man but came from god the father and when he said thou art christ the son of the living god that was not discerned by the intellect of a man that did not come from reading that did not come from studying that was given from god himself because then peter was a seed hallelujah so god jesus wasn't here to explain everything he was here to throw out the seed amen and when the word connected with the word it would come to life hallelujah so he says marvel not that i send unto you must be born again now nicodemus is thinking natural natural jesus is speaking spiritual at the same exact time one is speaking on a totally different level but the hearer is hearing with a natural carnal reasoning and a mind of a man and jesus is saying you must be born again he's speaking about a spiritual birth amen when that seed inside comes to birth comes the life and he's speaking and what he's saying is exactly correct he's saying it exactly correct from a spiritual mind but the man standing there from a carnal mind all he's hearing is i've got to be born like a baby comes out of its mother amen he's singing natural completely natural and jesus is talking totally spiritual marvel not that i said unto you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearst the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit hey who's born in the spirit we're just like the wind amen you can you can list it you can hear it you can see the movement of it but you have no idea where i came from and where i'm going amen but that's because we're born of the spirit amen this little this little movement that you see in this life was not the beginning of me and will not be the end of me just like when the wind blows through the rustling in the trees you can see the effect of the spirit moving the wind moving but you have no idea where that wind came from and where that wind is going so is everyone that's born of the spirit his origin goes back amen into the back part of god's mind all you see is the movement before your eyes hallelujah marvel not because the wind listeth bloweth where it listeth and now here's the sound there and cannot tell whence it cometh whether it goes so is everyone that's born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be he's still thinking with reasoning he hasn't made the jump to the spiritual he's still looking at the three dimensions he's living in he's still looking at tangible matter things he can hold on to real wind and real birth amen natural in this dimension he's not seeing what jesus is seeing nicodemus answered and said to them how can these things be jesus answered and said to him are thou a master of israel and knoweth not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and you tested that and testified that we have seen and you receive not our witness if i've told you earthly things this whole conversation so far has been earthly things nicodemus mind is totally shot amen he is absolutely confused and doesn't understand what jesus is saying and jesus said if i've only begun to talk to you about the earthly things amen how are you going to understand if i should talk to you about spiritual things he's talking to them on the baby level amen on the earthly level where the spirit of the earth meets amen but he can't even take you in the higher heights he told us the disciples the same thing there's much more that i would have loved to have told you but you were not able to handle it you haven't come to maturity enough and then paul the apostle says to the same thing amen when when you should be eating meat you're still on milk these are just earthly things you must be born again hallelujah if i if i've told you earthly things you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven how's that for your carnal reasoning and intellect he just he just took nicodemus on a trip that nicodemus can't explain nicodemus doesn't understand we've got to be born again not a flesh of the spirit like the wind and how can these things be don't marvel if i've told you earthly things how will you understand heavenly things he said but but then he says and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven we talked about this last week but you think about nicodemus walking away and he said what did the lord tell you and he says i have no idea he said something about no man's gone to heaven except the one that's come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven so where is he in heaven on earth i don't know amen he said he come down but he said he's in the heavens hallelujah he wasn't looking for a carnal understanding he wasn't looking for somebody that'll say it's here and now it's over here but he's going to look for somebody who can say it's here and here at the same exact time amen remember when he comes to the apostle paul on the road to damascus and in the apostle paul he says saul saul why persecute us down me amen what did paul see paul saw a bright light he saw a light the pillar of fire and he said saul saul why persecute us thou me he said who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom you persecute okay so now we have a bright light and this bright light now is shining in the face of the apostle paul and jesus says it's me i'm jesus not the second jesus not the third jesus but the only jesus but but where is the body with the nail prints where did it go where is it amen see you don't have to see the body with nail prints to see jesus he's seeing a lie and he's saying who are you he's saying i'm jesus whom you persecute but paul wasn't persecuting the nail pierced body paul was persecuting the body of the church that was on earth amen where the holy ghost was dwelling and jesus said that's me you're persecuting so now we have jesus in the believers in the light and the nail pierced body in heaven all at the same time how many jesus is one [Applause] the bodies in heaven the pillar of fire so what did he do did he gather up all the licks of fire amen when he come down jesus come down amen on the day of pentecost and the pillar of fire broke up that's what brother branham says broke up in the individual licks of fire and rested on their head and this was the holy ghost dividing himself into the people is that right but now that same pillar of fire is talking to the apostle paul so what did he do did he go back to each believer and say i want that portion back i'm sorry i got a few minutes i got to go show myself to paul no the holy ghost was still in them so the pillar of fire was still broke up in them and the filler of fire was standing talking to paul at the same time it's time the bride of jesus christ get out of kindergarten get out of first grade quit looking at natural things and start looking with spiritual eyes [Applause] that's why we go to the baptism of jesus in jordan and he comes down amen and it begins to say the heavens open john says the heavens open and the spirit of god descending like a dove upon jesus and a voice from heaven saying this is my son in whom i am well pleased is that right the trinitarians look at that and say see there's three people there there's jesus on earth there's the spirit descending and there's the voice from heaven see there's three no there's one the entire bible tells us god is one there's only one person there's only one god there's only one there's not three just because there's a voice in a in a form of a dove and a body standing here does not make god three it makes god one who did he say jesus was emmanuel who was emmanuel god with us jesus christ was the pillar of fire was the in the body of the believers on earth and had the nail print the body the nail scarred body sitting up as a memorial on the throne of god all at the same time how many jesus do we believe in one amen we've got to have spiritual eyes we've got too many nicodemuses around who says hey how can these things be what do you mean how can they be just have spiritual eyes with god all things are possible well i've only ever known time and space and matter no there was a time if you come from god that you knew before time space and matter and that life that was there before time space and matter is dwelling inside of you that's what's been quickened the life by the word to break spiritual amnesia and we don't have to understand the bible by time space and matter terms we can understand it spiritually hallelujah i think sometimes we've over trained on the bible and we've over trained with denominational teaching tools we've over trained ourselves with denominational bible studies and with denominational books and denominational helps trying to understand the bible and all that has given us is the same knowledge that nicodemus had come to in all of his training i think what we need is to let the message give us our bible terms and our bible definitions in our bible training let it come from the message of the hour too many times we're worried about our children memorizing bible verses there's nothing wrong with that but learning amen will take bob jones material and do this and i've used it before in homeschool so i'm not i'm not doubting anybody but i think sometimes that kind of training has been detrimental to our understanding of the scriptures because that comes from trinitarian sources and from seminary source and we've been taught by the prophet over and over that that stuff is is no good it's not going to get us where we need to go all of that paul had all of that paul had all the seminary teaching all the books amen all the scrolls he had read it all he had read the commentaries he had been taught by gamalio he was an audience with the high priest and he said i counted all as dung he put no value whatsoever on that training because what whatever he could not figure out and discern on his own the pillar of fire meeting amen and the holy ghost coming inside of him fixed all of his misunderstandings then he goes to the backside of arabia for three and a half years to study out what he had got in a moment's time in the presence of god now he searched these scriptures but when he looked this time it all looked different he had read it and read it and read it but he met the pillar of fire and he goes into arabia for three and a half years and now what he's reading he's not reading it the same way he used to read it he's not reading it and say well gamaliel used to teach us forget about gamaliel what did the pillar of fire say man what does the holy ghost say hallelujah praise god we're not denominational believers we've been lifted out of that the word has been restored one was in the denominations partial partial partial partial partial i don't want partial i want fool what's coming this day the full word with the full revelation amen the message is my bible curriculum the message is my bible teacher the message has the correct interpretation of the word with divine vindication hallelujah praise god we're not we're not trying to train up little nicodemuses we're trying to find the mind of god and let the spirit spiritual discernment teach us the word so the apostle paul sees the pillar of fire and the apostle paul he and when you get into first corinthians 15 he starts saying you know the lord was seen by this one and seen by this one as seen by the and lastly he was seen by me but how did the apostle paul see him it was the pillar of fire it was the blinding light and when he saw that light he didn't know who the light was but the light spoke to him and he said who are you and the light said i'm jesus so he saw when paul gets into first corinthians 15 and he says he was seen by a cephas and he was seen by these and he was seen by james and last he was seen by me amen he's not making any differentiation and who was seen it was jesus whether it was jesus standing there with the disciples saying thrust thy finger into my hand and thy hand and to my side or whether it was him speaking to mary and she thought he was the gardener and she did he was in another form or when he went to the 2 on the road to emmaus in another form amen it didn't matter which form he was saying he was seen of all of them and he wasn't referring to the nail scarred body he's referring to jesus christ so you can see jesus without seeing that body he can appear without that body and it can be him himself not the second jesus amen praise the lord hallelujah we're not trinitarians and we're not oneness because if you were one this brother said he said he said jesus he said god is not one like my finger is one right it's kind of a confusing statement amen until you take it until you take that same statement to the baptism in jordan and now you've got the flesh body of god which is named jesus christ and the spirit of god coming upon it and a voice from heaven saying now if if we were oneness we would have to say well that was just a vision or an image coming down because the spirit was already in him and jesus himself was projecting his voice like a transphiliquist up into heaven and speaking this is my son that would be oneness teaching or to say that only where the body of jesus is only where jesus is but when we come to the apostle paul the apostle paul sees the light amen we know that the nail scar body is the sacrifice on the throne but yet he says you're persecuting me which is a mini-membered body but it's still only one jesus amen but he doesn't have to be in that one body all the time he can come into a mini-membered body amen and at the same time he can show himself to the apostle paul without having to go collect all his pieces again you see this is god this is not a man this is not this is not somebody like you and i i can't be here and there at the same time in this body i mean he's not he's not like we are he's god and so we can't use this faculty that's been given to us to interact with this life to understand god we're going to have to see the scriptures the way they're wrote not the way we've understood them to be hallelujah let's turn to mark 16. look at a couple more places here mark 16. mark 16 9-13 i don't know about you but i love it when brother branham comes along and the word comes on and wrecks my carnal understanding of the scriptures i love it when i come along and i read and i read something and i say you know what i've read that wrong all my life i get excited about that as long as i look at that and say no it can't be i had to have learned it right from the time i was no when a message comes along and the prophet uses a scripture different than i've used it amen and it messes up my understanding i say praise god because when i was a boy and i was in sunday school and i was in the pentecostal church and i was being taught amen i was bored all the time boring everything happened back then everything's going to happen way over here and i'm learning about stuff that happened thousands of years ago and i'm waiting for something that seemingly is never going to come but we talk about it every year and every service some day something's going to happen someday we're going to go away someday someday someday but now when i listen to the prophet the prophet saying what day that's this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled this day and all of a sudden when it wrecks my understanding i say thank you god i'm living in the day of the fulfillment of the entire bible the whole thing this is an eternal word amen amen it's put in print and put on paper but before it was here it was in the mind of god and god spoke his word and somebody wrote it down and every word of god is eternal i no longer have to go through the bible check done check done check done check done check done it's all finished all i've got is a couple more scriptures no even the apostle paul he in the book of hebrews is writing to jews and he's talking about the exodus which for the jews is done i mean they come out of egypt they come to the promised land i mean that was done we studied that that was way back there i learned that amen when i was in my primer in sunday school i know the story moses comes out marry him dancing by the red sea i've got it memorized but paul says these things were done to them for our examples and now he's saying what happened in the exodus journey wasn't for them what happened in the exodus journey is for right now [Applause] there's no more saying well moses no it's all being fulfilled right before our eyes we're living in the fulfillment of the word the scriptures coming to life and being fleshed out amen so many scriptures it's hard to name them all brother branham preaches third exodus he takes the same thing paul paul was there in the second exodus establishing the people trying to positionally place the church in the land amen and so we now we have a first exodus and a second exodus according to paul amen but now according to the prophet this day there's a third exodus so the exodus story just keeps happening it keeps happening and keeps happening and then each one of us who comes to the lord has our own exodus story so we can find ourselves in the scripture coming out of egypt amen wandering in the wilderness amen going into the promised land taking our possessions so there's a there's a first a second a third but there's an individual exodus story taking place every time a new believer comes to the lord so these scriptures aren't to be pigeonholed over there or pigeonholed over there it's a living word meant to be lived and it's living out today through each one who's still coming still coming in the exodus journey mark 16 verse 9. now when jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and we know this is a type of the the last church amen because she had already been freed from the seven church ages and she went and told them that had been with them as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen after her believe not they heard he had been alive and been seen by her but they believe not after that he appeared in another form this is the road to emmaus he appeared in another form unto two of them and if you go to luke 24 and it says jesus himself stepped out but it was a another form and and after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them so here you've got multiple witnesses that say i see them but they're not believing because they can't see hallelujah i'm gonna show you something in a minute let's finish this verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen see here jesus comes down and he begins to unbraid them with their unbelief and hardness of heart now you would think it would be a righteous thing a notable thing to take like thomas and said i'm not going to believe any stories i'm not going to take anybody else's testimony on it amen i i'm not going to believe until i see him with my own eyes and jesus was not pleased with that attitude he wanted them to believe the testimony because their testimony matched the scriptures that's what that's why he unbraided them with their unbelief because what they were saying was exactly matching the scriptures there's some people who won't believe this message unless jesus comes down and tells him himself they say i want the holy ghost to tell me himself he's already told you through the mouthpiece that's standing before you it's the scriptures made alive will you believe the word through the testimony of one of god's children or do you have to have him come down with a body with nail prints and tell you himself he will unbraid you for your unbelief for that and your hardness of heart because you won't believe the testimony of a believer you won't believe the testimony of a child of god when he is confirming to you the scriptures are being fulfilled that whole attitude i've witnessed the people who said i won't believe it unless he tells me himself he's telling you right now this is him she is him amen he is in his church he's telling you right now what more do you want hallelujah praise god so they didn't believe let's go to john chapter 20. john chapter 20. in verse 1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher then she runeth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him now this this disciple who whom jesus loved is john the beloved he's the one writing this gospel and throughout this gospel he never declares himself he'll talk about everybody else he either refers to himself as that other disciple or another or the one that jesus loved it's always referring to him and we know john is a type of the bride amen and so you know when we say search the scriptures search the scriptures and watch john because john's a type of the bride if you look at john amen especially in the book of john but but i just wrote down a few places john chapter 1 verse 35 john and andrew are the first ones to receive the word from john the baptist that this is the lamb of god and when john on the second day says this behold the lamb of god amen they too left and began to follow him watch watch the bride search the scriptures they are they that testify of me amen the bride was right there from the beginning of the ministry of jesus hallelujah amen in john chapter 18 verse 15. amen we know that that the the the the temple guards they come to arrest jesus and everybody scatters but it's only a momentary scattering because one of them slipping behind and follow him to the trial amen at the high priest psalm and slips in and we know peter gets in but peter gets in because john was already there so the bride was there amen and heard the four runners the he's heard the prophet the forerunner elijah amen confirming that this is him and when they when when john pointed this as him the bride was right there to recognize it and even when he's arrested and they all scatter the bride is right there amen she's always the mysterious one not mentioned this is why john doesn't mention his name in the book of john he's the type of the bride he's the mystery it doesn't say john he said he whom jesus loved jesus loves his bride or the other disciple he slips in and he's with jesus through the whole trial peter's only there for a portion of it until peter denies him and runs out john doesn't deny him and john doesn't run out at the crucifixion all the disciples forsaken him but in john chapter 19 verse 26 jesus hanging on the cross looks down and sees the women it's amazing the men are gone but the women are there and with the women is john and he looks down and says woman thy son he looks at the disciple he says thy mother who was at the crucifixion john see through the mystery of the bible whenever you see christ or a christ type if you look you'll see the bride right there amen the bride's always there with joseph there's a bride there amen with david there's a bride there with every type there's a bride there was solomon there's a bride there there's always a bride there if you just look amen and when they left the garden alone there was still a bride slipping in mysteriously amen at the crucifixion there was still a bride there hallelujah after his resurrection when he went to the sea of tiberias fishing they were all on the boat fishing and a mystery man stands on the bank and says children have you caught any fish and they said no it's a cast on the other side and they pulled in fish and it was the disciple whom jesus loved it was john who first said that's the lord out there then it was peter wrapped his fisherman coat and jumped in and swam after him but it was the bride who first recognized the resurrected lord in that sea of tiberia settings john is the last disciple to see him in the book of revelation it's john is the first to receive the revelation of the seven thunders because john's standing there and he hears the seven thunders utter their voices and he knows what they said it's the revelation of the seven seals and he goes to write it and he's told write it not so it was john amen the bride who received the revelation of the seven thunders and it was john in revelation 10 who eats the book and john was the only disciple who didn't die a martyr's death [Music] they tried to boil him in oil couldn't kill him they tried to kill but they put the fire to it they couldn't bully him in life they sent him to patmos he was supposed to die there he receives the greatest revelation amen the capstone of the bible then they bring him back out and he dies of natural causes as an old man showing that the bride will not go through the tribulation the only disciple amen that doesn't die a martyr's death is john the type of the bride because the bride is not going through the tribulation search the scriptures they are they that testify of this bride she's there she's from genesis to revelation if you've got eyes to see amen if you go back and read every scripture of the bible amen and don't see christ go back and read it again but you must remember christ like adam is in male and female go back and find the male we've been looking we've been finding him we've been seeing he's there he's there he's there he's there but go back and find the female and say she's there she's there she's the mystery that's been running along with the mystery of the man has been the mystery of the woman through the entire scriptures all the way through the new testament even john typing that bride now turn with me to john chapter 20. i think we already did that praise the lord mary magdalene tells them the stone is taken away then she runeth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulcher we know not where they have laid him peter therefore went forth that other disciple and came to the sepulcher so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulcher and he stooped down who got there first john hallelujah do you see a pattern he got down first and stooped down and looked in and saw the linen clothes lying yet when he not in then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went and also the other disciple john which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed amen if you read all the other accounts it looks like nobody believed but there was one disciple who believed from the beginning and that was john the type of the bride he looked in and he saw and believed look at the next scripture for as yet they knew not the scriptures john believed before he even knew the scriptures he didn't even need the scripture to believe something in him said i believe and they did not yet know the scriptures hallelujah they knew not the scriptures that he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away against their own home here's john a type of the bride amen john doesn't have it all figured out john doesn't even yet know the scriptures that he must rise from the dead john hears the testimony of mary amen mary from the seven church ages because to tell him that he's resurrected that the body's gone that's all he's doing the body's gone stones roll away body's gone they run him and simon peter run he gets there first do you notice how often when jesus comes to a place he always comes to a woman first when he comes to raise lazarus comes to a woman first comes to samaria comes to a woman first huh i wonder why it's the mystery of the bride through the entire bible jesus is always coming to a woman first hallelujah so now john runs he looks down and he sees doesn't go in because the jews have to go first so simon peter runs in first he sees and he leaves then john goes in when john goes and he looks around he saw and believed that's the most exciting scripture i read in that passage because they did not yet know the scriptures that he must die and resurrect again see john doesn't need proof [Music] because john believes when he saw the empty sepulchre not even mary believed because when we go down mary it says next next verse in verse 11 but mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as he wept she stood down stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels and white sitting on the one one at the head the other at the feet where the body of jesus laying there's two angels there's two messengers at the head and feet because there's paul and brother branham at the beginning of the church ages and at the end she looks down and she sees and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith and then because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing jesus which jesus which one the pillar of fire the nels guard body you know there's half a dozen of them he showed to her in one form and he was in another form to the tudor on the road to mass he was in a different form to the apostle paul and he was a different form when he came into the room and they stuck their fingers and that's four different forms of jesus if you're counting and then he was in the form that was being persecuted there's five how many jesus one jesus no matter which form he's in he says i am jesus hallelujah hallelujah don't you love it you don't have to rely on a carnal understanding or a doctrination from a denomination but you can read the bible and say that ain't nothing but the truth how does it work i don't know how it works all i know is it works and it's true and i believe it something inside of me says when paul saw that pillar fire he said i'm jesus that was jesus when he said i'm jesus you persecute in the body of those believers that was jesus too how does it work i don't know but it's the truth when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus why because he was in another form if he had been standing there with his brow tore up his beard completely plucked out nail holes in his hands she would have known exactly who she was looking at you say well he was wearing a big hood and had something covering his hands please it was another form hallelujah so jesus standing knew not that it was jesus jesus said that her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou's laid him and i will take him away she didn't believe what john believed john looked and believed that he was raised from the dead amen mary looked and said where is he at where's the body i'm still looking for a body and here she is still looking for a body and she's supposed to be the gardener say sir if you've borne him hence tell me where those laid him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary the only thing he had already talked to her he already says woman why weepest thou it wasn't his voice that opened her eyes it wasn't the voice that opened the eyes it wasn't the voice of the seventh angel it wasn't the voice of the fourth beast because many people have heard that voice it wasn't the voice of the seventh angel that opened mary's eyes but it was when he called her by name and revealing the mysteries is calling the name and the only thing that can open her eyes to the one that was standing talking to her was when the mysteries was revealed her name was called and he said mary she turned herself and said to him rabboni which is the same master immediately she knew who it was when he called her name now we see the mystery laying in the bible from genesis to revelations brother branham says and events made clear by prophecy he said here's another thing they had done you know they had heard a six hour sermon on prophecy being vindicated that's what he talked to them along the road just as soon as they started down the road he stepped out for he was right there at jerusalem six hours later sixty furlongs they was right down the road six miles to emmaus and that's it and he preached confirmed prophecy for six hours so brother venom keeps highlighting that it was a six hour sermon they'd gone six miles 60 furloughs a six hour sermon in a six hour sermon he began to he he was there with his voice amen and his voice was breaking to them the word and their hearts were burning within them amen but it wasn't until they come to the seventh hour when they invited him in the house and when he come in he took the bread and he broke it and brother brahm said he did something just like he had done it before his crucifixion he showed him the sign of the son of man he had done something just like he did before and when they did their eyes were open and they saw him and they went to scream out and he vanished out of their sight then they run all the way back amen they've been traveling away from jerusalem away from the place where pentecost was going to take place moving away or way away through six church ages they come into the seventh in the seventh he comes himself and breaks bread he does something he shows the son of man ministry he shows the sign of the messiah something he had done before his crucifixion when they do their eyes are open and instantly they run back to jerusalem and they begin to tell him we have seen him not somebody like him amen not him in a way we have seen him and they didn't believe it some believe some didn't so brother branham starts showing us and how luke 24 he starts taking all the types brother i'm showing us this he starts revealing modern events made clear by prophecy he starts running all the types types of moses types of noah types of all these types down through the ages and he's saying jesus must have been to this scripture and jesus must have went to this scripture and he starts showing through the word he starts to reveal all the scriptures that pertain to himself but brother branham comes in 1962 he preaches a message called spoken word is the original seed and the next day he preaches a message called the end time sign seed and here's what he says he said in yesterday i preached the six hours hmm that's interesting i preached six hours upon a subject the original seed of the word and we brought it from genesis to revelations we've had the same thing in our day friends amen the same road to emmaus has taken place all over again only this time he wasn't showing about him coming as the male has the sacrifice but this time brother branham calls the spoken word is the original seed and what's he talking about and spoken word is the original seed adam had a wife just like adam had a wife she fell hey jehovah had a wife she fell but christ is going to have a wife that won't fall amen he restored what adam lost but there's coming a woman who won't fall she'll stay with the word what's he doing in the six-hour sermon he's taking us from genesis to revelations not to show us jesus christ the man but to show us mrs jesus christ the rest of the mystery that's in the bible a six hour sermon these things don't just happen i don't know how many six hour sermons you sat in probably felt like it a few sundays but we haven't done that yet six hours and we brought it from genesis to revelations back and forth on a six-hour tape that what god's program was what he is and how that spoken word of god is the seed of god friends did you hear the six hour tape did you hear the voice the better question is did he call your name did he reveal the mysteries and you saw i'm not just seeing the man that was nailed to the cross i'm seeing that he came and laid his life down so that something could be taken out of him to form another image called his bride amen and then god and the end of time is going to unite the head and the body together and it infuses invisible union and when that invisible union is complete there's going to be a manifestation amen that the headship is here in the bride and then there's going to be a change in the body amen the fullness of the rapture will come and then there's going to be a visible union in the air we've heard a six-hour tape explaining this to us not the road to emmaus amen but our road from genesis to revelation showing that all the way in the beginning there was a bride all the way the end in revelation there's a bride and there's been a mysterious bride all the way through now we've heard his voice and by revealing the mysteries we heard our name and our eyes were opened and we could say who is this who is this someone wants to say it's the coming of the holy ghost who's the holy ghost jesus christ someone to call it the coming of the word who's the word jesus christ our eyes were open where the bride could say this is jesus christ himself has come down to unite with his bride and when john looked in he believed and they didn't yet know the scriptures somehow we would listen to a tape and they hear that voice and and all of a sudden something inside of us would begin to stir and whether we liked it or not we were beginning to believe amen and if some of you were like me we were trying to choke that faith down choke that belief down because i'm not sure about this yet i can't believe till i see the prince in his nails i can't believe till he comes into my room and says chad this is me it's all correct but no matter how much i wanted that amen something inside of me kept bubbling up and saying it's the truth it's the truth it's the truth until finally i could resist it no more and i could say that's nothing but the truth and then i went to share with my friends and they said what about this scripture what about this scripture what about i said i don't know i don't know i didn't think about all of that i never thought about that scripture i i don't know i don't know how it all works but i still believe it he looked and he believed because they didn't yet know the scriptures [Music] i talked sunday about hattie wright had he write a humble woman with a poor education amen sitting there not a bible student not a scholar she's sitting there listening to the prophet of god talk about the creation of squirrels in a voice told him you have need of something what do you need squirrels wherever they come from he describes how they're going to come and where they'll go and he's shooting them and this little woman and brother branham is referring to the scripture when he says if you say to this man so it's not like the prophet is not talking about any scriptures everything he's doing is based on the scriptures but there's no scripture that says a man in kentucky will shoot squirrels that he created you see this is the fulfillment of the scripture but the fulfillment of the scripture isn't verbatim the scripture the scripture says if you say to this mountain and doubt not in your heart it'll be plucked up and cast into the sea that's the scripture and that's the scripture brother branham was wondering about when the voice came to him and told him you have need and told him to speak the squirrels and he spoke to squirrels into existence so this is based on the scriptures but hey when you look for the scriptures to be fulfilled you have to be very careful what you're looking for because that scripture was not if this if you don't down your heart say to this mountain amen and you see an example of it when jesus speaks to the fig tree but now brother brown is coming along confirming that scripture but he's not talking to fig trees or a mountain and if you take an ecclesiastical denominational understanding of the word you'll say that can't be the fulfillment because he said mountains i didn't see a mountain hattie wright hadn't been to seminary she didn't care if it said mount or said fig tree something inside of her said that's nothing but the truth that is the fulfillment of that scripture you got to be careful the way we read the bible got to read it with spiritual discernment you got to read it with spiritual eyes not a man's intellect there's anything we can do is count all of our previous learning as dung don't rely on it don't lean on it amen all the bible school training throw it out the window all the bob jones bible verses throw it out the window and say god teach me this bible let me know what you've said let me see your word what you intended it for me not with some theologian and bob jones thought it meant i want to know what you meant by what you said amen the only way we're going to get it is through the message of the hour and spiritual discernment these things aren't naturally given they're spiritually discerned not comparing natural things was natural but spiritual was spiritual comparing natural with natural would have had if you say to this mountain okay the fulfillment will be a mountain cast into the sea no we don't compare natural with natural but spiritual with spiritual and we like hattie wright can say that's nothing but the truth we can say like john like john the beloved when he looks down and he goes on the sepulchre and he sees it all he believed even not yet knowing the scripture that he must rise again from the dead you know what the scriptures did confirmed what he believed amen how many times have you read the scriptures and it confirmed what you already believed and you didn't even know it was there but you believed it not knowing it was there something the prophet would say and he wouldn't qualify a statement he would just make a statement he would say something about a bible character he'd say something about a bible story or just say something about the bible and you didn't even know it was actually written in the bible you thought it was something the prophet just said but you believed it anyhow because this is a vindicated prophet and a witness in your heart said that ain't nothing but the truth but then years later you're reading the bible and you say that's why he said that it was written in the bible but he didn't quote the bible and you didn't know it was in the bible but it didn't change anything you still believed it [Applause] and we can pretend we didn't know i only believed what i read you already believed it all that did was confirm what you believe remember when john the beloved he looked in and believed but the scripture they did not yet know the scriptures what do you think happened to john when he finally heard the scripture that he must die and raise he was like i knew it i knew it i knew it i knew it everybody else was like oh oh i denied it i didn't believe john the baptist was thrilled because it confirmed what was already his heart was already telling him that that's nothing but the truth hallelujah i don't want to be a theologian i don't want to be a seminary student i don't want to be a bible school student i want to be the living word and a living oracle living out the word so that people can see it and they look at it and say that's the truth they might not even know it comes from the bible they look at your lifestyle they look at the way you dress they look at the way you act and they know inside of them that's right they don't even know the bible but they know that's right why it's written epistles dread of all men i want this book to live in my flesh so that somebody else will look and say that's nothing but the truth i say you're right you want to see it wrote down praise god i love the word is so much more than we thought it was it's so much richer it's so much fuller it means so much to us i'll leave you with this last thought brother branham said i preached a six hour sermon right spoken word is the original seed i went back and looked it up not that i doubted him but i looked it up anyways it was 6 hours and 17 minutes and we know 17 is the number of victory over defeat or a change in administration and amen it was on the 17th day that the flood broke the flood waters broke out 17th day of the second month it was the 17th day of the fifth month when the ark come to rest on ararat amen esther is the 17th book of the bible revelations 10 7 is 17. he preached a six-hour sermon six hours and 17 minutes there's no mistakes in the message friends everything's exact and it's all pointing us to the same thing 17 17 was the age of joseph when he received his coat of many colors and had his dream of ascending to the right hand of the throne 17 were 17 shekels of silver that jeremiah bought the land and redeemed the lamb for 17 seconds of silver and made the two writings and brother branham would come in the seals and then seals he said look at jeremiah look at jeremiah look at jeremiah you think this prophet's words weren't ordained his greeting in the front taking extra time it takes a long time to get started why he's got to go 6 hours and 17 minutes so that we could go back and see that 17 and see revelations 10 7. see esther the 17th book of the bible see 17 the silver price of redemption for the land oh friends these aren't these aren't fables cunningly devised fables of man this is god god orchestrating every word god orchestrating every step and something inside of us that can say that's the truth amen let's all stand you musicians if you'd like to come and brother jim we're a long ways from being done praise god i like this subject hallelujah yeah we'll just take watch night service sing two songs and preach five hours praise the lord you know what i love of people crazy enough to show up and say that's what we want amen hallelujah god bless you we love you all with the love of the lord so thankful for a people who don't have to see to believe thomas said unless i see i won't believe jesus said blessed is he who doesn't see amen and yet blessed is the bride like john who looks in and sees and believes before he knew the scriptures blessed is he who who doesn't see and yet believes i wasn't here for brother brennan's ministry but i believe every bit of it i wasn't here to see the pillar of fire move through the audience but i believe every word of it but i've got a different vision and that vision isn't natural eyes amen amen it's not anything that i've seen not anything i've seen in my mind's eye but by the eyes of faith i've seen the pillar of fire moving out from this pulpit tonight [Applause] and i see angels surrounding amen why because he told us that's the way it was the holy ghost in my words they are spirit and they are truth the spirit has been moving out from the pulpit over the audience because that's what the prophet told us and we've got different eyes none of us could have seen it with these eyes i didn't see a pillar of fire just like in dayton when elisha and his servant were in dathan the servant couldn't see the chariots of fire all around but they were still there [Music] [Applause] i can't see with these eyes amen that myth brother i'm talking about it's all become a myth a mist of faith that faith is rising amen i can't see it with these eyes but i sure enough see it with eyes down in my heart and i can say it's here amen his presence is here his pillar of fire is here his word is here he's here hallelujah blessed is he who doesn't see and believes hallelujah lean not to thine own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge god and he shall direct thy steps by what by faith in his word i say god help me not to rely on my seeing let me not rely on my hearing but let me rely on faith faith in this word will get us from the start all the way to the finish and maybe just maybe we're going to have to really believe before we see maybe there's some things in the message maybe there's some things even out of the bible that we're really going to have to believe it just because the prophet said it even before we can find it in the bible that's been happening for the last 50 years he's either a prophet of god or he's not faith has to come to a level where we're directed by faith not by knowledge faith not by intellect but by faith this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith sometimes god withholds a little seeing just to see if we've got faith he might even show you the wrong picture with the natural eyes just to see what your eyes of faith will see because the only thing that's going to make it through what's coming and the squeeze is coming on the bride the only thing will be faith all human affections will be squeezed out all human reasoning is going to be squeezed out all understanding going to be squeezed out it's going to come a time it doesn't matter if every single person in your family believes this message amen or falls away from it it's going to be a test of your faith faith is the thing that's going to win not in what we see but in what we believe hallelujah that makes us a peculiar people hallelujah let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your word for another opportunity to hear your word preach lord god is by the foolishness of preaching you chose to save them that are lost you know i just pray god that you would let this word drive down deep into our hearts lord awaken the faith seed lord by the word let us see with a different set of eyes lord eyes of faith eyes of understanding let us be enlightened to believe all that you've spoken in this day and i pray that you encourage us along the way as we move out of these doors lord i pray that you would go with us lord let us carry you out into the world for your prophet said we are templing christ lord we are the temple we are the body let us go out there and let the light shine through us that others might see that there is a place of refuge there is an ark in this day and as far as we know the door is still open and lord let us be standing there calling unto all that will come come and taste and see that the lord is good come and drink of the fountain of life the waters of life freely god put a burden in our hearts for lost souls help us to shine the light of your gospel everywhere we go with every step we make we love you god and we ask for your blessing to be upon us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you can we sing that song the winds of faith do we know that the winds of faith if we could bring up the winds of faith i haven't sung this song in a little while but i love it it's going to be faith friends nothing but faith [Music] amen one by faith take the word of god [Music] [Music] is you can fly in a higher place do not struggle it's by grace [Laughter] [Music]
