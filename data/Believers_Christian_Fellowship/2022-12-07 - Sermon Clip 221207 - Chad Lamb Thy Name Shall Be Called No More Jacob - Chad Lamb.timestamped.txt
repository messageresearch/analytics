[2:01] what did Abigail have she had something
[2:04] that the other girls didn't have she was

[2:22] himself amen he had people with partial
[2:24] understanding amen praying out with a
[2:26] partial understanding partial
[2:28] understanding partial understanding but
[2:30] now he's got a people that he has
[2:32] unveiled himself to so that they can say
[2:34] oh God didn't your Prophet say doesn't
[2:37] your word say didn't you show us your
[2:39] characteristics God I know your plan
