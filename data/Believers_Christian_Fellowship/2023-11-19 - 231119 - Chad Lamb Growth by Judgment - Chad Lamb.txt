on to his reward amen passed on to us the off body amen and I'm thankful for our brother I was um been reflecting you know on the last week as our brother's been declining and on all that brother Steve has done for us as an assembly we don't ever want to forget that God used that man and the gifts that he placed in that man for all of us we've all benefited by his service to this local body and I appreciate that and you know he's Health has been failing for a while the last year has been a tough one for him and the last several months been really difficult but oh I thank God that he had a reward waiting for him at the end of life's journey and now we just want to remember the family and pray for them them and do all we can to underg guard them and strengthen them and support them and show them our love and as my custom is last night I was praying in here and I was walking the aisles and then I come to the empty green seat in the back where Steve was been sitting for the last couple years and oh I just broke down not in sorrow for my brother it's we just feel a loss amen separation this life is really tough I'm so glad that we've learned not to live for this life because these separations come they've come they'll come again if the Lord dares but oh when the time of Separation in the time of grief I'm so thankful that we know the truth and we've not put all of our our life and all of our love and all of our efforts into this Dimension alone into this barriers or this wall of a natural life but all that we believe goes far beyond the limitations of this life and it will continue on and our fellowship will continue on and our love will continue on and all that God's done for us it'll never cease the Eternal things move on and on so we just want to pray for the family so I'd like for us all to stand together and as we pray for the lord to bless this preaching of the word we want to play pray for the Hollinger Family it's about our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you so much for your goodness Your Grace your mercy your great love for God we know that death in the natural is not the end of the story lord it's the beginning for Brother Steve this is really a beginning a beginning of something so much better a beginning of what he himself longed for for so long God we're so happy for our brother and so thankful that you have transported him Beyond sickness Beyond confusion Beyond weakness Beyond frustrations you've taken him into that place Lord that your Prophet Saul that Paul went to to and couldn't even describe you've took us took him to that place Lord where it's beyond perfect it's beyond Sublime where there's nothing there but perfect love I'm so thankful Lord for us who remain Lord we're so thankful that we had a part in the life of our brother Steve and we've all benefited from you working through that vessel to help us and we're grateful for it Lord and now we just pray a special blessing over the family that you would be a great comfort to them in their hour of grief Lord as they grieve the loss of a loved one as there's been a terrible separation Lord I pray God you would comfort them that you speak peace unto them that you would show us as an assembly each one of us in an individual way how we can support them and help them and love them in this time may we speak words of encouragement words of love words of life and be a blessing to them in this hour for all that he's given to this assembly Lord may we as an assembly give back to his family and Lord show us how to do that God as we come to the time that we've set aside for the preaching of your word Lord we want your word to take preeminence in the service in our lives in everything we want you to have your way I pray God that you would touch this human vessel that's weak and has its own frailties and inabilities but God it's your chosen method it's your chosen way to preach the gospel Lord I pray as I relax Lord that you would take over and Minister through a gift you place in this vessel and may you bring your words of Life Lord and may you give Greater Life to us all Lord Quicken those who've not been Quicken to life yet Lord help us to grow those who are in the way lead us as a great Shepherd leads his sheep may you do so by the light of your word and God we give you preeminence and we give you glory and we give you praise and we ask God that you would have your way with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all let's turn in our Bibles while we're standing if we may to Second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 while we're turning there I just want to say how much I enjoyed the Bible Believers Christian School program on Friday night if you got to go it was amazing all you children who are in it you did a great job amen you blessed me and sister viddy God bless you did a tremendous job and I was very blessed by the message that was portrayed and the kids did a great job in reminding us of God's Great victory in our lives when Christ paid the price to bring life to us amen so I was really proud of him and really blessed by the the whole thing amen let's look at 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse all scripture is given by INSP ins spiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so I want to highlight that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness let's turn now to chapter 4:1 we'll just go down chapter 4:1 he says I charge thee therefore uh I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead it is appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears amen God bless bless you as you have your seats amen wanted to open with this to show that the word of God what what part of the word of God is given for is this instruction before I do that I want to welcome our visitors it's good to have brother Levi and his family again and he's brought a whole host of Fellowship along with him so God bless you all we're so good to have you the Fishers God bless you it's good to have you here as well I've seen many of you Arley back here and brother berer and brother berer and brother berer and and his family so it's good to have you all I may not remember everybody's names but God bless you all you're very welcome and it's good to see you all again just good to be together amen it's good to have something to gather about it's good to have something worth talking about it's good to have something worth living for amen and this world is falling apart amen it's going into chaos and it's going into ruination amen and we see that people are losing hope they're moving into despair they have nothing amen everything that they were getting excited about they see falling apart but I praise God that the thing that excites and thrills us is not falling apart but it's moving higher and higher and higher it's becoming more of a reality in our lives day by day so we thank God for that so we see that that the word of God all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable so all the scripture is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness and then he goes and admonishes uh Timothy how to use that word and and then when we get into uh chapter 4:2 he said preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine so the word is here to correct us the word is here to guide us the word is here to instruct us the word is here to encourage us the word is here to guide us and enable us it's it's here to accomplish everything in our lives that God wants to accomplish will be accomplished by the word amen and I'd like to continue on and the thought we've been on we've been talking about judgment we've been talking about the new birth and and and we last Sunday I believe it was last Sunday I've lost track of a little bit of what I've preached when but it's been wonderful amen the Lord's just been flooding into my heart amen over and over by inspiration more and more keeps coming and what I'm wanting to preach today is actually something that I had on my heart from the very beginning a thought that dropped in but as I went to look at it things just kept blossoming kept expanding but but praise God we want we looked at last Sunday life from judgment and how the World Views judgment One Way amen but it just depends on which side of judgment you wind up on and we we saw that life comes from judgment and we we realized that back in Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 1: 2 we find the Earth in a state of judgment amen Darkness covering the face of the deep amen it's been judged something happened to the Earth and the Earth is under judgment amen but it was under judgment because it had fallen some way from the word of God and now it was in a judged state but God judged it amen not to destroy it not to eliminate it not to throw it away he judged it so that it can go on serving his original purpose and intent and his original and purpose intent for creating the Earth was so that his family can be expressed on the earth so that God can come tangible in human flesh upon the Earth and expressing himself by a family amen so when that when that purpose fell and fell into ruin he judged it amen but immediately he went by the spoken word and by his word he brought light and that light began to bring life and brood over the Earth and start bringing life back up amen until he brought it back from chaos to a Garden of Eden amen he judged it but he didn't leave it in judgment he Jud judge it to bring forth a fresh new life to bring it back to its original purpose and we see that in the Garden of Eden when when he when he made Eden then he planted a garden Eastward in Eden then he took the man that he had formed his son and and from his son he formed a wife and he brought the two together and he placed them there and he said it is very good he looked at all that he had done and all that he had made and he said behold it is very good this was God's great picture that he painted for us so that we could see what his desire is what does God want to do God wants to have his sons and daughters on the earth amen and an earth that's in Harmony and in Union and and in love amen but then we saw that it fell again and there had to be another judgment and and this time the Judgment began to fall upon substitutionary offerings on the lamb amen and it was the lamb all the way through until God offered his lamb and his lamb bore judgment for the sins of the world he was was beaten he was mocked he was rejected he was crucified and he was he was absorbing the full Wrath of the Judgment of God he was the substitutionary offering for you and I we should have been nailed to the cross for our sins but he took our place it was a substitution for us he took our judgment when you see Calvary and you see how Bloody and how brutal and how terrible it was he was absolutely all forsaken by the whole world he even asked God why has Thou forsaken me because God had to turn his back on his own son because he was bearing the Judgment of God the wrath of God for the sins of the whole world Amen and in that judgment it wasn't because he wanted to destroy and annihilate and do away but he had to judge to purge to bring new life and three days later we saw the purpose of judgment and the purpose with judgment was expressed and Resurrection amen amen so then we found that we ourselves must come to a personal judgment where we find ourselves in need of Salvation we find ourselves lost amen wandering in the world away and separated from God being alienated amen born in the world with a with a natural man that's at enmity with God and hates the things of God and we find ourselves in this situation and when we find ourselves in this situation there's going to need to be a judgment of the flesh man because the flesh man's under judgment amen and we saw where the prophet of God told us we must climb up on the Altar and lay ourselves upon God's brass Altar and say God I'm wrong amen I'm wrong in my thinking I'm wrong in my desires I'm so far away from your word I'm so far away from what's holy and just and pure God would you come down and burn me with the fire of the Holy Ghost burn out destroy all that's in me that's not like you all of the sinful nature all of the sinful desires God I can't get it out of myself I need you to come amen and and Purge me and what is that purging for it's for new life so you can be born again so the spirit of God can come in and so the seed of God on the inside it's in your soul can be birthed and you can become a new creation in Christ Jesus and you can walk forth you can come off of that altar that brass Altar and the old man is now dead now the new man is alive amen a new creature a brand new babe in Christ so we find that these judgments Are For Life For The Wicked they're Destruction for the predestinated of God they're for life because God has a purpose God has a plan God has an original intent and God will continue Amen to whatever gets out of the way he'll bring it back in the way because God's plan won't be defeated amen and if God has to judge it to bring it back in the way he'll judge it if he's got to chastise whatever he's got to do he'll bring it back in the way because God's plan won't be SW and and if God's plan for the Earth cannot be disrupted if he has to bring a judgment Amen to bring it back in line amen what about this Earth Here amen he's got a plan for this Earth here and if this Earth Here gets out of line God will not spare any judgment God will not spare anything to bring this Earth back to his purpose amen so we see there's a regenerative judgment we saw in Genesis one one one two there's a regenerative judgment he judged it so that he can regenerate it is that right and then we find amen Christ was judged to bring regeneration to bring life amen and now when we judge ourselves and we come to Christ and die out to self and be consumed amen and the Holy Ghost Fire Burns all the droughts out of our Lives amen it's for regeneration it's for new life we find the premillennial judgment and me as we go into Millennium we find the Earth destroyed with atomic and Volcanic fire amen it's a destruction but it's a destruction for what it's a destruction for regeneration so that we can walk out on the ashes of the wicked and brings new life upon the Earth then we find a post-millennial destruction amen after the Millennium amen when when we have the Battle of Gog and meog when Satan is loosed again upon the Earth because he was bound for a thousand years loosed again and brings another deception and gathers the world against Christ against the holy city amen and this time fire from God comes down and the heavens are on fire and burns it all off and destroys it once again what was it destroyed for for regeneration to bring forth new life amen we need to have a regeneration judgment experience in our lives amen where we desperately come to God and say God I'm not right and I'll never be right on my own but I'm laying myself out and saying God consume me Lord consume me with the fire of your spirit and make me a new creature in Christ Jesus but we find also there's another kind of judgment n the Judgment I want to talk about today there's a corrective judgment so there's a regenerative judgment and there's a corrective judgment and this correct in judgment is like a father with a son it's like Like a Shepherd with a sheep it's the one that keeps us in line it's the one that keeps us from wandering off the path as a sheep because sheep are prone to get lost amen but the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls he's always there and the the in the 23rd psalm David says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen the staff is a guide that they guide with the rod is a rod of correction that he corrects he'll Smack That Sheep amen Shepherd will smack the Sheep amen not because he's mad at it and not because he wants to drive it away but because he's correcting the sheep and he'll use his Rod Amen to hook it over the sheep and pull it on the shoulder and bring it back in the path and move it away from danger and move it over here and if the staff won't work the rod surely will get the attention amen and that's a good shepherd right the Good Shepherd amen his rod and his staff they comfort me because I as a sheep have a tendency to wander and get lost I need a Shepherd a bishop of my soul amen so this is the corrective judgment that we're talking about amen after regeneration we need a Shepherd we need correction we need a father who will guide us as children along the way and say no don't do that that's dangerous and stop doing that or or come over here or move over there we need a father we need this correction so it keeps us in line amen and we also will find as we move on it's like the pruning of a plant a plant in order to maximize its growth and continue to grow and produce it needs pruning amen we'll find that in the scripture let's turn to Revelation chapter 3 together Revelation 3: 19 he says in Revelations 3:19 we know this is speaking to the leodan church age he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into to him and will Su with him and he with me so in verse 19 he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasen so this is God's love man the word is good for reproof for rebuke for instruction and righteousness amen as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent amen the prophet of God tells us in the church age book when he's talking about the latery in church age which we know is the end age this the age that we find ourselves in it goes to this scripture and he says be zealous and repent he says now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews in John 2:17 the Zeal of thine house has eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal he's talking about the church nominal the church world the denominational systems amen they got a Zeal but the Zeal is wrong the Apostle Paul had a Zeal but his Zeal was wrong amen his Zeal was for the Jews religion he thought it was a Zeal for God and he found out it was a Zeal for religion right it was a Zeal for his church for his system of theology amen but he had a Zeal but it was a misguided Zeal and today the the the many churches have a Zeal but it's a misguided Zeal because it's a Zeal for the denomination it's a Zeal for their own ideas but it's the wrong Zeal it's for the house of their own building it's for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into lead ERS they they have put aside eternal life as a person and made it good works or even Church Conformity rather than good works but God is calling for another Zeal it is is the Zeal to cry I am wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong amen I am wrong amen there's still so many things about me that's wrong amen and the more that I walk in this walk I I I used to think that I was a good person and I used to think that everything was okay I was raised as a church boy I was raised in a in in a and I would would what I considered a very good church amen an independent Bible believing King James Bible believing fairly modest church I I I thought we had it all wrapped up amen I thought I was good but I found out amen through a few trials in life and through failures that I was no good whatsoever there was no good thing in me at all amen and I had to come with the Zeal to repent and say I am wrong oh my ideas are wrong everything that I thought was right is wrong and that's the Zeal of the age the Zeal to repent the Zeal to say I'm wrong we're going to find that this is this is an important Zeal to have and it's an important Zeal never to lose because the minute we start losing the Zeal to repent to have our mind changed and our understanding changed and to submit to the the word of God we're going to find ourselves taking the same path of every denomination because we need constant correcting to manifest what we're supposed to manifest in this age do you think of the level that God has called this generation to not like any level previous not like any age that was stuck in darkness that had partial revelation as the Revelation was being restored coming out of the Dark Ages from the Ning Council amen the that the romanist system took the church into utter Darkness amen but coming out of that God would awaken men amen and they would bring a reformation and bring a Revival and bring it all the way up through to the modern day what's he doing he's growing a body he's growing a church amen so that he can dwell in it in fullness and at the end time there's going to be a people standing on this earth that is to be the very reflection ction of Jesus Christ that they are supposed to be vessels filled with the spirit of God manifesting his life not their life his life and you talk about a tall order friends we're not going to do that unless he has absolute preeminence preeminence means absolute control and in order to do that there's many things in our life that are going to have to be corrected and cut away and changed we're going to have to change our mind on all kinds of things and we shouldn't sit here today with our mind made up thinking we already got it fig figed out we do not have it figured out but by the grace of God he has sent a word in this day that'll bring us all the way to the Finish Line we have it's been handed to us we have received it through a prophetic Ministry we have the full revelation of the word amen with Divine Vindication it's in our hands but we must constantly surrender to that word and constantly lay aside our thinking amen that's why we come to church we've been born again we've been regenerated by the spirit of of God why are we coming back every Wednesday and every Sunday we're not just here to make a atmosphere for somebody else to get saved that's part of why we're here we're not just here to show what side we're on that's part of why we're here we're here also to worship collectively God and sing his praises and glorify his name but a big part of why we come is so that we can have something else cut out of our life every Sunday every Wednesday so that we can move into this High Calling of Christ Jesus amen amen if we don't come with that intent so many times we walk away disappointed because we don't realize that the preaching is to reprove to rebuke to chasen also to instruct and to encourage it's supposed to do it all everybody likes the encouraging sermon it's so hard to like the corrective sermon that's just human nature I don't know that we'll ever get away from that until we come to a level of maturity where we can say thank God I see I was wrong anden let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 let's look at verse four in Hebrews 12 ver4 he says you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise thou despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scores every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God god dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet oh that's a key phrase we had fathers who chastened us and fathers who corrected us and we gave them glory amen we look back now as as grown men and women we can say I'm so thankful I had a father who wouldn't let me get away with things I'm so thankful I had a mother amen who would make sure I was lined up so I didn't have all my own desires and all my own wants I'm thankful for that amen but he's saying amen the Father the the the father God he's doing it for our own profit not even just for his own pleasure but for our own profit amen but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness amen he's correcting us so that we can be like him now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby after reading that we should come to church with a different attitude amen we should come to church amen to do all the things we talked about we should come to church to throw our shoulder to the wheel and support the work of God we should come to church to to lift our voices with the voice of many and singing praises and glorifying the name of our God we should come to church as a demonstration of our faith of what we believe that we believe it's important to worship God it's important to gather ourselves together we should come for all of those reasons but we should also come amen seeing oursel as a little sheep coming before the shepherd and saying Lord amen if I'm spping to the right or to the left side of the road would you chasen me quickly and bring me back to the very center of your will amen because no chastisement let's read this again no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exced exz thereby and why does God chasen us is verse 10 for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness amen he wants to keep us in line with himself which is his word let's go to Psalms I'm going to read something out of the Psalms David was so familiar with this principle he's the one who wrote the 23rd psalm he wrote so many things that are such a help to us in Psalms 118:18 in Psalms 118: 18 he says the Lord hath chasen me sore that means he's really spank me good the Lord has chasen me sore but he has not given me over unto death what he saying David knows what it was like to be under the Judgment of God he knows what it was like to be chastened to be scored to be corrected under the heavy hand of almighty God and David was a man after God's Own Heart David was a man who God greatly beloved but David also knew what it was like to fall under the heavy hand of a mighty God he knew what it was like to be lifted up and to be blessed he knew what it was like to be abased and to be brought back down to earth he experienced both by the hand of God because that's how God deals with his children that's how God deals with his beloved but he wouldn't deliver him under death amen that's the reason he was chastening him so that he wouldn't die let's go to Proverbs 20 Proverbs 20 verse 30 Proverbs 20:30 the bless of a wound cleanseth way evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly the bless of a womb cleanseth way evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly the Bible says foolishness is bound in the heart heart of the child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him and that's how God instructs fathers and mothers to raise their children and when they're out of line correct them and correct them with chastisement with scoring with something that's uh no chastisement for the present seem Pleasant that's that's maybe a nice way of saying that but yet it's instruction because in the heart of that child is bound foolishness but the rod of Correction will drive it far away but I don't think it's just in the heart of our children but I think it's in the heart of God's children sometimes foolishness is bound in our own minds our psyches are are the the emotional human realm of us amen there's still foolishness that abides there there's still selfishness there's still Pride there's still all kinds of things that are laying there amen and the grace of God will come our way many many times and it'll bring circumstances in our life that'll cause us to to judge ourselves cause us to look around and see God where am I wrong amen and when God reveals it to us then he's asking us to be zealous and say I am wrong forgive me Lord what's he trying to do he's trying to keep us fit for his service he's trying to keep us in line for his great purpose in our lives and that's to manifest himself in this generation and nothing will defeat that purpose let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 in 1 Corinthians 11 you'll recognize this as part of the scriptures that we read for communion service when we come here the first of every month for communion and I'm just going to pick it up down in verse 27 and begin reading from 27 to verse 32 and he says wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world here we come to like I said we we read this traditionally for communion and it's a it's a wonderful principle it's an absolute truth that God has and he's he begin to tell us that when we come to communion that we're not to come and take of it unworthily this isn't a light trivial thing it's a very heavy very serious thing that has impact in our lives but but he's saying we're not to take the Lord's suffer supper communion unworthily but we are to examine ourselves I tell you the most difficult judgment to me the most difficult judgment in the world is to judge myself and sometimes the the the greatest deception and I think sometimes some of the most diabolical deception is self-deception and we know self-deception is what Lucifer had because he was deceived by his own brightness he was lift up by his own wisdom his own Perfection his own Beauty he he he had self-deception by his own brightness amen and sometimes we can deceive ourselves by our own Glory we think that we we have things figured out we think that we know right from wrong we think that I mean think listen friends we can think we know the Bible and we know the message and we know all of this and and that's the wrong attitude the right attitude should be I'm just a child and I know nothing and I want to no more and so now we're told to examine ourselves which I think is difficult yes and if we're instructed to do it then it's possible but it's going to take some genuine honesty to examine ourselves it's going to take there's there's a reality to this that is not lighthearted and trivial there's a reality because self- discernment is really difficult it's not something that we should do maybe in two or three minutes time maybe a a quick maybe we should really take some time when we come to communion not just to communion we should take some time once in a while and just quietly meditate on where we are with God where we are and what we're doing and and what's pleasing to the Lord and what's not pleasing to the Lord but when we come to communion now self-examination takes on some serious consequences or a lack of self-examination for it says I want to read again for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord that's not a light phrase we shouldn't take it lightly that's very very serious says so but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup we are going to need the Lord's help for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body I believe with all my heart if we come to God with an Hest heart saying God show me where I felt I believe he will because it's according to his word amen and sometimes we need God Amen we need an unction of the Holy Ghost we need something to drop in to show us where we're wrong because many times if we knew we were wrong we wouldn't keep doing wrong sometimes we're doing wrong not knowing we're doing wrong I mean you serve God for a while and there's things that you do not do today that you thought were okay 10 years ago is there anybody in the room like that and then when you when God deals with your heart and you get a greater Revelation and you recognize that that thing's not pleasing to God that was self- serving that was self that was done out of Pride that was something that not pleasing to the Lord then all of a sudden you're ashamed of yourself for being blind all these years amen I hope I'm not the only one in that position amen but by the grace of God Amen when we ask God God Amen when you go to exam yourself and God shine your light on any place that's not pleasing to you I believe God will do it amen and so many times there's things in our lives that we didn't awaken to because maybe by the grace of God he knew that we weren't ready yet or we couldn't handle it but when the time was right God opened our eyes amen and that's when it's time to be zealous and repent say God forgive me I didn't understand but now I see I didn't get it but now I do amen he goes on and he says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body if we knowingly have things in our heart that aren't right and things in our life that aren't right and we just move on and assume that it's going to be okay and we come to this great Lord's Supper to this communion table and knowing that we're wrong in our heart knowing that that we have some condemnation laying somewhere cuz we've done wrong we've said wrong we've harbored bitterness we've done something wrong we've got something hidden that we haven't made right amen when we come to that he says you bring damnation upon yourself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves I want to look at this word judge it's interesting in the Greek there's just a couple definitions that it's given uh it's used it it's used in the the Bible the the English words that are used to translate this are doubt judge discern contend or waver what does it mean this the one of the definitions is to learn by discrimination to try to decide to determine give judgment decide a dispute but it also means to be at variance with oneself to hesitate to doubt this is the act of judgment not passing judgment once you pass judgment it's past tense I found myself this but this is the act of judgment and the act of judgment is to doubt your own self to be at variance with yourself to not trust yourself when it says judge yourself you're not supposed to be like you know well my opinion is this and their opinion is that and I'm this and I no the the judgment is not to judge yourself uh that way the judgment is to get actually down and doubt yourself actually question yourself to be at variance with your own self you say okay you're doing that and you feel like it's okay why do you feel like it's okay why Chad do you think this is okay and why do you want to do that and why do you keep why do you keep justifying this action if it's not a problem for you why is it always coming up in your mind right I'm not talking about judging somebody else I'm talking about judging ourselves being at variance with our own selves and being at doubting our own selves and saying amen because we understand that that our thoughts speak louder than our words in heaven and that God's judging us off our motive and our objective outside everything can look right amen it could actually be technically okay the action that we're taking technically you can't find maybe a Bible verse against it maybe you can't find where the Prophet spoke against it and there's a technicality you would pass but in your heart your motive is completely wrong your desire is completely wrong this isn't this is a selfish desire this is self-serving this is based on Pride this is to serve the lust of the Flesh and you may technically be okay but in the eyes of God you're still wrong God's not judging on technicalities and boundaries he's judging the heart amen why are we doing what we're doing why are we saying what we're saying why are we taking the actions that we're taking right that's why this is hard work this level this judge yourself is hard work to say why why am I doing that why am I struggling with this why am I having a hard time with this in my life and why can I not seem to get Beyond this barrier sometimes we just need to doubt ourselves amen this is actually what judgment is Judgment when you come to judge a matter you don't come to be gullible and believe everything is that right when you come to judgment that that's why when you come to judgment you don't come to judgment and you ask you know so why did you do that and what did you do I didn't do nothing wrong sir I did this and you're like okay he said he didn't do it that's not judgment that's not judgment judgment is to doubt him and to be at variance with him and push him a little bit to find out what really happened that's judgment amen and sometimes we need to push back against oursel and go deeper than the logic in our brain and go down into the heart and say why am I doing what I'm doing what's down inside why am I resisting the word of God why am I having a hard time forgiving a brother or sister what is wrong down inside and push Beyond this and get down here and do some real discernment and judgment amen we all know the word most of us know the word we know the message we know quotes we know scriptures and we know exactly how to intellectually justify everything that we in our hearts still want to hold on to but now we need to judge ourselves and say why Lord help me God to see what's going on inside my my heart amen but praise be to God verse 30 two verse 31 if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged what the scripture saying if you fail to judge yourself your father is going to judge you this is his love to us but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world why does he judge us to destroy us no does he judge us to annihilate us to do it no he brings judgment on our life so that we will not be lost with the world he brings judgment and chastening which is like spanking a child or scoring correction he brings judgment and correction so that his purpose in our life will not be defeated so that we will not be lost with the world oh I thank God he's corrected me I thank God he's judged me I thank God he's weighed me in the balance and found me wanting many many many times friend it wasn't just once when I gave my heart to the Lord and I was born again there's been judgment upon judgment upon judgment why because I'm still dealing with this sticky Cocker nature on the outside that's constantly trying to trip me up and so many voices trying to get me to stay in that Realm amen but oh by the grace of God he has judged me and he has chasen me and he's given me a heart to say forgive me Lord I want it always to be that way amen now this word in verse 31 if you would judge that's the act of judging that's doubting that's questioning that's being at variance that that's holding it in doubt if you would do that to yourself you'll not be judged but when you are judged these two words judged amen they're past tense if you don't do the act of searching your heart doubting yourself questioning yourself being in doubt of yourself if you don't do that God already knows what's in your heart amen and if you not if if if you're not you will be judged if you don't judge you will be judged and that's when he declares you're wrong yeah he doesn't have to search it out he already knows and he declares you're wrong you're wrong and I'm going to correct IR you amen because I am not going to lose you with the world I didn't predestinate you to lose you I didn't call you to be a manifestation of myself just to let you constantly wander around in your own self deceit thank God we have a father thank God we have a Shepherd thank God he sent a word in this day to keep us in the right lane the prophet of God says that doesn't need any explanation it's just this if we eat and drink unworthily we eat and drink damnation to our own selves not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weakly and sick among you and many are dead when we come to take communion every Christian should take communion it's your duty it's a showdown see Jesus said if you don't take it you have no part with me but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself that is if you're still out with the world and doing things with the world and people see you taking communion you're doing wrong you're only bringing disgrace to you and it'll harm you it isn't it isn't that it'll harm God it'll harm you and so a person should examine the themselves and before we approach this sacred moment you ask God to search my life and if I've done anything that's not right forgive me I don't mean to do it I'll make it right if he'll reveal it to me I'll ask the same thing for you is how we should come to communion for each other God help my brother help my sister amen help the pastor help everybody help the song leader help everybody Lord help us to be right in your eyes Lord we should come searching Our Lives again he makes another statement about communion he says now I thought maybe tonight is communion night and I hear they've had a baptism and going to have another one I like to come down for communion I missed it last time not being here I missed it I knew that this was the first Sunday so I made preparations to be here so I could be in communion for tonight for I truly think that it's the duty of every Christian to take communion you're going to find out why he says that in a moment the Bible said if you take this not you have no part with me and I believe it is The Showdown time for Christians if we do not take it we have no part with him if we take it unworthily then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ so it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up so when he comes to communion we should come reverently uh solemnly sacredly walking up confessing all of our wrongs praying one for another not only that but we should feel if there's a brother or sister Among Us that we feel is just a little bit out of line somewhere our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially to see them that they'll be able to walk up and take communion and not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters amen you see how serious it is Jesus gave the commandment and he says this this do in remembrance of me as often as you do this you show the Lord's death you show my death the Paul said the Lord's death till he come so we find that communion is one of the three sacraments left to the church there's water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's communion and there's feet washing these things are not optional they're Commandments they're not optional amen and he says every Christian should come to communion why should every Christian come to communion because communion is a showdown time with yourself amen you can't walk up there and take it unworthily or you bring damnation upon yourself not Discerning the Lord's body amen so you have to know that you have everything in your heart cleaned out before God repented and confess and come to take communion but if you take it not you're at variance with the Lord Jesus Christ himself and you've separated yourself from his word from his commandment and brother bam said that that that he even refer heard that if you have no part with me and we know Jesus said that during the foot washing ceremony foot washing when he talked to Peter he says if I wash you not you have no part with me and brother brandham coupled the feet washing and communion together and he said if you don't take communion you have no part with me so when we come to communion it's a showdown friends if we don't take it we're off the word that's right we've denied the very word of Jesus Christ and the Commandment that was left to the church if we take it unworthily we brought damnation upon ourselves oh I love communion I love that God has given us something to where we have to come and face ourselves periodically amen there has to come a time where we come face to face with where we are there has to come a time where we search ourselves we should always be doing it but but listen friends life is busy and life moves fast and we get caught up in things and sometimes we don't take the time we ought to take but when it comes around to communion service time to the Lord's Supper it's a great time to stop hit the pause button say God am I pleasing you in every area of my life I don't want to come down there and take communion with something in between me and you something that's not right amen when it comes when it comes to these times amen we need these times and they don't just come at Communion they come so many times in our lives where something goes sideways something goes upside down and we feel the chastening hand of the Lord and we have to ask ourselves some hard questions say thank God for that thank God Amen that sometimes when we don't judge ourselves I'm so glad that he'll judge me so that I won't be lost with the world amen communion was commanded by Christ confirmed by Paul reconfirmed by brother brandom because we need it because we need it we need more opportunities to judge ourselves we need more time where we have to face the reality in our lives not flippantly not it's not just a traditional another ceremony but it's a time to stop and say God am I right am I doing right am I pleasing you are the decisions I've made recently are they in line with your word is this what you want from me God open my heart and show me my motive behind what I'm doing and then we can come to the communion table boldly knowing that there's nothing to hinder me and that I can I can come boldly and rejoice in what Christ did for me to purge me from my sins to wash me from unrighteousness to purchase me back to God so that I can be free I thank God for that amen so God has given us these measures by which we have opportunity to judge ourself let's turn to First Peter chapter 4 1 Peter chapter 4:1 17 before I move on I want to say one more thing whenever I I preach about things like this and bring up communion amen it's never in a way for me to persuade somebody to come communion because if you're not worthy I don't want you to come I do not want to push persuade or coers somebody to damn themselves and bring sickness or death so you don't have to come to communion to prove to me you're a Believer you don't have to come to make me feel good I'm not trying to get more people to show up it's not the not the purpose be behind this preaching whatsoever it's because it's a commandment of God and it's necessary in our lives it's something that has been confirmed in our generation to be necessary for us but it is certainly not a way to C anybody else to come because if you don't want to come please don't come if you don't feel free to come don't come if you don't have the Liberty in your heart don't do it and if you don't have a desire for it please don't come because if you don't have a desire then you're not taking it seriously then you have a misunderstanding about it and if you don't have a desire in your heart don't come but I preach these things so that we can come correctly according to the word and we can get the full benefit out of what God has laid down for us there's not a lot of things he's commanded us to do it's not like the Jews with the law amen that law was just to proed to them that they couldn't do it amen but God has given us something these these three sacraments for us to keep because we need it amen so please don't feel pushed or coerced just do what's in your heart but I pray if you find yourself on another side of the word pray and ask God why why why don't I want to come why aren't I there every time and I don't mean when you're away on vacation or when you have something going on that's understandable mean that's why we do communion once a month because there's always somebody that's going to miss sometime that's why we don't do it once a year every six months because if you're on family vacation or if you got something going you won't get communion for a whole year you won't have an opportunity for 6 months or a year to come to a service where you have to judge yourself right amen some people complain about the frequency it's too frequent amen but praise God how can it be too frequent that we judge ourselves how can it be too frequent amen there's nothing said in the scripture there's no commandment we don't have to have it any certain amount of time we could do once a month we could do every other month we could do once a quarter we could do once a year we could do it as we feel do it all of those things would be fine and all of those things would be right according to the scripture amen but but but as the shepherd of this church if I see fit that we need to have communion once a month why would you resist that why would you resist that opportunity to keep that word and to come together and fulfill the word of God that needs some self- judgment that needs some time to say why Lord why am I resisting we come to First 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 17 1 Peter 4:1 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the centner appear my goodness what a scripture that's a heavy one for the time is come that judgment was begin at the house of God and don't just think this is the house of God this is a house of God this is a building that we we have set aside and we have given it over to the Lord and dedicated it to the worship of the Lord that's what this this house is for but the real house of God is the Living Church amen it's the body it's the habitation of God by the spirit it's the dwelling place of alight Mighty God it's the Temple of the Holy Ghost that is the body amen and judgment comes to the house of God means judgment's coming to this house of God the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and look what he says if it first begin at us where does it first begin at the house of God at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear that's why sometimes I think we take these things a little bit too lightly he said if the righteous scarcely be saved amen we make it we make it sound like everything's just so easy but it's not so easy it takes some judgment some travail some sacrifice some real judging of self amen and it takes the hand of God Amen to constantly bring correction in our lives to bring us to where we need to be and where will Judgment begin at the house of God Amen the prophet of God says in the message speak to the Rock and it shall give forth as water says that's why I don't see why so many complain that I speak too hard and try to make people straighten up and tell them the way they're living the way they're dressing and tell me I'm hurting my Ministry when the Judgment seat is the house of God that's right here's where it is to begin right here where Justice and righteousness and the Judgment of God is to go forth from the pull pit that means the pulpit is not just to make you feel good sometimes the pull pit is to make you feel bad so that you judge yourself I like it better when it makes me feel good but sometimes it does me better when it makes me feel bad but I like it better when it makes me feel good I like to be called an eagle I like to be called bride I like to be called the predestinated the apple of his eye I like it when somebody says you can no more fail than God can fail I love that preaching it makes me sore like Eagle wings but the problem is if we only get that preaching and none of the other we'll move on Flying Like an Eagle and not realizing there's parts of the world hanging on and creating drag and holding us back from the height we can really get to we need the full word of God amen amen let's go to Isaiah chapter 6 says in chapter 6 verse 1 in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple Uzziah we know was a prophet of God he was a man of God serving God working for for the kingdom of God and he had his eyes on Uzziah we we know the the story but when he begins to express here where he was at the year that King Uzziah died he's disappointed discouraged because Uzziah was like a hero to him a Godly King and then he he had he had made a mistake and he had fell and and he said I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple so now he's going to get a fresh vision of God above it stood the seraphim and each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole Earth is filled full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts Here Comes Isaiah and Isaiah now is going to get a vision and he's going to see amen the Temple of the Lord and he's going to see The Throne of the Lord and he's going to be lifted up into another dimension amen and when he's lifted up to behold the glories of the Lord and the Perfection of the Lord he is getting a greater Revelation than he's ever had before but when he comes into that greater Revelation all of the sudden in that presence in that atmosphere there's an Awakening inside of him of what he's lacking amen all of a sudden he's realizing I'm not where I thought I was I'm not what I thought I was and all of a sudden he says woe is me he doesn't say lucky am I for this Vision amen I'm so I'm so elevated because I can see so much but the more he saw the more he realized what he was as a human being and how far he was from that Perfection I think it's the true in this message amen the more beautiful the word comes the more lifted up in the Heavenly the Dimensions we are the more we should realize how horrible this world is and how how terrible the old Cocker nature is and the hybridization that we were swn into what a terrible thing it is and we shouldn't trust our thoughts we shouldn't trust our emotions we shouldn't trust all those reactions of the flesh we should go high enough to say woe is me oh my goodness I need something more woe is me you say lucky am I woe is me amen for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts something about this Revelation opened his heart and he could become so honest he could be some so honest there was no more self-de deception yeah I'm not there was no more whatever you know he was he was a prophet he had a Godly King everything was going well some trouble happens and then the year Uzziah dies and then he's lifted up and God's going to give him a greater Revelation and lift him into the heavenlies and open his eyes to see glories that he's never beheld before but as soon as he does all of a sudden he says woe am I oh God I need help yes I need more of you amen this Revelation friends when we open it up and we see what God has determined before the foundation of the world to do and that he's called you and I to be part of the program and he keeps lifting us higher and higher all of a sudden we should say oh God woe is me I got to have some help I need your spirit in me Lord I need you to correct my wrong understanding give me Revelation help keep my feet on the right path because I know amen that I cannot do it on my own amen so he come to this woe is me this reality struck him when the reality struck him a real raw honesty hit him and he could say I'm a man of unclean lips I have said things I should not have said and I dwell amongst the people with unclean lips they have said things they should not say and all of a sudden raw honesty looked him in the the face and instead of hiding from it he admitted to it he confessed it and then after he makes that statement we have verse six then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which had been taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged hallelujah amen what does it take friends what does it take to move higher what does it take to be cleansed what does it take all it takes is a humble heart to say I am wrong am that's all it takes amen no more excuses no more justifications no more hiding behind a quote no more no more claiming Superior knowledge now we come to a time to just say I'm just playing wrong amen I shouldn't have acted like that I shouldn't have treated that brother that way I shouldn't have hid this thing in my life I'm just wrong and when he come to Raw honesty and he could place where he was and where the people he was with was and he got honest about it immediately come a seraphin with a coal off of the altar God has the power to fix the problem amen but what he needs is somebody who will lay themselves open again and say it's me oh God standing in the need of prayer it's me who's guilty oh God I'm the Man Nathan come to David and he said oh David you know he gives him a parable there was a man a rich man and he had all of these sheep then a traveler comes and and there was a poor man with only one little lamb and he loves that lamb so much and what does the rich man do he takes the poor man's lamp and he offers it and the parable is typing David in his great sin of taking bath Sheba away from Uriah and Nathan sets it all up and he declares it all and at the end when David passes a harsh judgment amen Nathan looks at him he says you're the man you're the man amen you're the one and you know what David says I'm the man I'm guilt immediately oh he shows what a child of God is like zealous to repent amen this is a man after God's Own Heart a man after God own heart may not be perfect amen may not be free of error but a man after God's Own Heart Will yield himself to God constantly that is a man after God's Own Heart because in acts when it says I've chosen David a man after God's Own Heart who will do all my will amen who will surrender himself every time he comes in contact with the word and the word exposes him as wrong he will say woe is me and then God will come with a coal off the fire god and cleanse his lips and then look at what he does next as soon as that seraphim comes with a live coal and touches his lips immediately there comes a call also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me what was this whole thing about there was a purpose in Isaiah's life there was something God wanted to accomplish in his life amen but God had to bring him to another level not just another level of revelation but another level of surrender another level of humility another level of understanding the difference between him and God and when God brought in God wasn't doing away with Isaiah he wasn't punishing Isaiah he was he he had a commission a purpose a desire for Isaiah and he's going to bring Isaiah into this purpose regardless of what has happened what errors what misunderstandings what wrong Communications and all of a sudden he lifts him up and in that he's humbled he's a base and he recognizes it and then God purges him of his iniquity and calls who will go for us he says here am I send me that was God's intent all along that's what God wanted out of Isaiah's life all along and what does God want out of you and I he wants a witness of his resurrected life he wants a testimony in flesh that Jesus Christ is alive acting and breathing and living out the word of God that's what he wants amen and if anything begins to hinder that or it or hold it back amen he's going to bring judgment and chastisement why not because he likes to chastised because he's got a purpose in our life we need to be more willing to handle correction we need less pride in our lives amen prophet of God said this Pulpit this is where the Judgment seat of God is and the word is God's judge you know the prophet gives us a a battle order that we find in the Old Testament there was an order when they went to fight and and the prophet tells us this is the order of our services this is why we construct our services the way that we do because there's a certain order and in the battle order the singers would go first and as the singers went forward singing then the priest would come bearing the ark the word on their shoulders and then the the multitude the Warriors they would go into battle that's what he explains to to us and if you think about uh you think about a service now we come and the singers come first amen we all sing and we rejoice and we're making the way why because the word's coming next amen the singing comes first the word's coming next and then the levite comes bearing the word on his shoulder the minister comes to the pull pit Amen to preach the word and as soon as the word is brought forth the battle breaks out what battle the battle that's going on in your mind the battle that's all around you amen between the word of God in selfishness the word of God in Pride the word of God and and a desire the word of God in lust amen the battle breaks out right in you right in your seat right where you're sitting is where the battle's going on and it's raging as the word is being preach will I submit to this or will I resist this amen will I give in God or will I keep my ways that's the order of the service because there's a battle taking place every service amen will I receive the word or will I keep my idea will I come like Isaiah or will I just keep moving on the way I am this is why the service is constructed the way it is because it gives preeminence to the word because the word is what judges and what we need is to be judged that's right we don't need to be petted and stroked and told how good we are there's enough of that in the message and there's encouragement in that and we'll preach that all the time because it's the truth the apple of his eye but don't think just cuz we're bride that God will not correct his bride that's right we need it when let's go to Acts chapter 13 says the Judgment seat is the pull pit and God judged by his word acts 13 acts 13 and verse 44 acts 13:44 Paul and Barnabas are preaching now says in the next Sunday came almost the whole city gather to hear the word of God but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming and when Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles during the preaching of the word there was a judgment that took place because the message of the hour is always eternal life the word of God for that day was eternal life they were preaching the word and they were presenting the word and when they turned against it he says seeing that you judge yourselves they passed their own judgment upon themselves by rejecting the word so is the pull pit a judgment seat yes but is the pull pit of Mercy Seat yes because those who received itall received it gladly and received eternal life turn to Jeremiah 17 Jeremiah 17-9 Jeremiah 17 and verse 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it this is what's so hard with self- discernment self judgment your human heart is Crafty it hides amen you know the number one tactic of the devil is to hide not to come out and knock on your door and say I'm a devil and I'm here to deceive you today no but the devil's always hiding and he's hiding in something that looks good something that's desirable something that's not too bad he's always hiding amen and so sometimes our own desires of our heart get muddled up inside of us and the devil is hiding even our our own emotions and our own thoughts and the Heart Is desperately wicked who can know it let's go over to Hebrews Now Hebrew Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aund of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the heart is desperately wicked who can know it the word knows it absolutely the word knows it amen and that's why we still believe in fivefold Ministry and that's why we believe in live preaching of the word that God can anoint a man to take the sword of the word and cut you aunder till he separates your spirit and your soul because the heart is desperately wicked who can know it but the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so that when the word starts getting close and en encroaching in on your problem don't get offended at the man that's preaching amen look at it and say woe is me God help me to be right with your word if you're pointing that at me I take it Lord fix me oh God humble me help me to surrender amen America is one of the hardest places in the world to preach the gospel because America was based on Rebellion the spirit of patriotism and the spirit of America is a spirit of rebellion and it's one of the hardest places in the world to preach the gospel because there's rebellious Spirits in America and there's a self uh uh uh there there's a such a sense of self ability in America we've always been on the top we've always been able to figure it out we led the world and all that but God is beginning to Humble America now because she's not going to be on the top very much longer am sometimes what we need is just Contrition and humility and surrender because the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's why we come for preaching we we come for encouragement for instruction and righteousness for reproof and rebuke we come for heart surgery sometimes things are so deep in our hearts wounds from when we were children Scars From the Past habits that set in generational things that were laid into us so long ago that we don't understand what happened rejection complexes that came from parents amen neglect that we suffered or abuse there's some things so deep in our heart we don't understand what's going on Amen but the grace of God he'll he'll take a man under his control and put the word of God in that man's mouth to come down and start to dive deep down into the heart and start to expose there's a problem here we've got to go deeper there's an issue laying here you got to go deeper something's laying there that's a problem we got to go deeper until that can be rooted out given to God and the coal can come and Purge and bring life and then he can say and now who will go for me say I'm here I'm here and I'm ready that's what I've always wanted was to serve you I've always wanted to do your will that's the purpose friends that's God's Great desire let's go to John chapter 15 John chapter 15 verse one John 15:1 Jesus says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit amen purgeth means to prune or to cut to it's also a word like like chasing to chastise he's not destroying this plant he's not shaming or embarrassing this plant he's cutting this plant and why is he cutting this plant so that it can bring forth more fruit I am the True Vine my father is the husbandman amen every branch in me that's not bearing he takes it away but every Branch that's bearing you know what Isaiah was doing Isaiah was bearing fruit I believe that but God purged him so that he could bear more fruit and in the end if you read down that God wasn't just after more fruit but then God was after much fruit what does he want in our life the purpose for which we're here is much fruit and God will come along and he'll take and he'll cut why because that's old growth old growth cut it off so the life can move forward it's going the wrong direction cut it off so life it's all about life it's all about fruit it's all about more life more fruit more abundance more service more display of righteousness more Holiness more of God on display in our lives that's what this whole thing is about the husbandman how will the husbandman cut us oh he's got many ways he use chastisement he use life circumstances and use the message to reading the Bible you can speak to your heart during the preaching of the word during service God has all kinds of ways to bring to our understanding that we're wrong and he's pruning and cutting and pruning and cutting instead of resisting that we should just say God cut me Lord I'm here cut me cut all the old growth cut all the wrong growth cut everything that's not shaping itself out right cut it off of me so that I can bring forth more fruit and God work with me till I bring forth much fruit scripture says he that will preserve his life shall lose it but he that will lose his life for my sake shall find we have way too much self-preservation way too much holding on to ideas and habits and things way too much self-preservation we need to good through purging from time to time God took job through a purging job wasn't a sinner job wasn't an unrighteous man is that right job wasn't a bad Jo God had confidence in Job that job wouldn't fail the trial job was righteous God loved job job was a child of God all this Came Upon job to try job and test job amen but but it was never to destroy job but there was a question laying in job's heart he wasn't sure about the resurrection and through all the trouble and through all the trial and through all it wasn't because job was unrighteous it wasn't because job had hidden sin in his life it wasn't because job wasn't a child of God or serving God it wasn't any of that but God put the clamps down upon job because he wanted to bring job into a greater Revelation he was going to answer job's question the same time he was proving what a son is to Satan oh pray praise God sometimes he wants to show what a son is in the midst of our trial and he'll let it come down but that's not usually the only thing he's doing is usually doing something in our lives at the same time bringing us in further growth bringing us higher up amen and it got to the place where job's friends kept coming along and accusing him of being a an unbeliever uh uh secretly harboring sin because God's bringing this judgment and job began to correct them and tell them that you're lousy comforters you're no good friends and why do you trouble me and why don't you come for me and why doesn't anybody help me but then he begins to turn amen and he starts to defend himself and he he starts to say I've not done anything wrong and we know he was righteous under the the the blood of a lamb under the word for his day he had offered the sacrifice he his his his sins were under that substitution we know he was righteous and he declared himself righteous he said I know had no hidden sin but what he started to do where he started to fail is he started to question God's judgment he started to question I don't know why God would do this if I could go knock on his door if I could plead my case before him like he could stand face to face with God and say God you shouldn't this and God you shouldn't that oh my goodness now when he started to defend himself and move into this place where if I could talk to God I would plead my case to his face all of a sudden U come around and elu begin to tell him you're nothing amen you were born Out of the Dust you have no breath but comes from God you have no life how dare you say you can stand toe to- Toe with him and question why he does anything and then God comes down and speaks to him directly he says G thyself up like a man I've got some questions for you where Were You Who put the boundaries on the water who decreed this and who who established that and who put the Earth Here amen if you can tell me tell me if you've got the answers tell me and God comes down to job and saying you can't question in me everything I do is right and you don't understand then we go to job 42 if you could turn there we're going to look at job's answer after God spoke to him when God come down and spoke to job like a man he spoke to him like a man not like a little boy not like a girl he said gir thyself up like a man I'm going to speak to you and God leveled it straight to him yeah amen I love that there's so much preaching that makes God sound like a like he's afraid to correct his children and he's got to talk soft and gentle to now you know dear that's not really nice look at how God spoke to job this is how God deals with the sign he he starts to lay it straight at him amen and this is Job's answer 42:1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou C do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understand not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee wherefore I AB bore myself and repent and dust and Ashes job who told his friends I've done nothing wrong I'm righteous there's no reason God will judge me I don't understand why he's doing this if I could go to his door if I could see him face to face I'd plead my case and I would tell him that I haven't done anything wrong you know what he was right to a certain extent but now when he comes to meet God face to face he doesn't speak as bold as he was when he was talking to his friends now when he comes face to face with God he said I AB bore myself and repent and dust and an ashes how could I be so proud and arrogant yeah verse seven and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words un job the Lord said to elifaz the timite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for you have not spoken to me the thing that is right as my servant job hath therefore take unto you now seven Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burn offering and my servant job shall pray for you God never thought less of job God never turned his back on job God never judged job to destroy him God put job back in his place so that God could put job back in his place sometimes God has to put us back in our place so that he can put us back in our place and our place is to manifest him our place is to declare his glory our place is to live this word and sometimes he's got to put us back in our place so he can put us back in our place help us go now he's using job he still got job in the right position now he's judging his friends for being wrong to job listen friends we don't ever have to defend ourselves or do anything God will make it all right God will straighten it all out God will make the wrong right amen he says offer up for yourselves a burnt offering for my servant job shall pray for you for him will I I accept less I deal with you after your Folly and that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job so elifaz the timite and bildad the shuhite and Zur the Tonite tthy went and did according as the Lord commanded them and the Lord also accepted job and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then there came there unto him all his Brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with them in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of gold so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than the beginning for he had 14,000 sheep 6,000 camels a thousand Yol of oxen and a th000 shei asses he also had seven sons and three daughters what did God do God wasn't destroying job God was answering job's question and then he had to put job in his place when job stepped a little too high God brought a correction to him through elu and then he came down himself when elu came it's a type of Elijah elu and Elijah means the same thing it's type of brother benham's Myer Ministry he says I come to you per your request for I am in flesh I am in clay I represent God he's coming down saying you asked to meet God you asked to meet him face to face he said if God if I could talk to God Like a Man and elu comes down which elu and Elijah is the same word elu comes down and says I'm here to answer your request I'm here at your request you wanted flesh to talk to you wanted God face to face and elu started laying him out and job had no answer for elu and then after elu came God job says in one place I've spoke once I'll speak no more I spoke I'll put my hand over my mouth lest I should speak again then later he says I bore myself and dust and Ashes when job came to that level of Correction God imediately picked him up and said now this is what I've always wanted I've got a position for you amen your friends need you those who corrected you now they need you for only you will I accept and the friends had to come to him the loved ones who left him came to him they brought him money He restored everything he had He restored double and he got his sons and his daughters back friends the Way Up Is Down it'll always remain true brother Brenham said the way of in the way of a true Prophet 1962 he said I do believe in purgatory don't let that stumble you it's not Catholic Purgatory said I do believe in purgatory but I believe it's right now you purge your your own soul Purgatory means to purge when you see you done something wrong get out there and clean it out of You by confession and crying and fasting and praying man let's be serious about this we're called to a high calling in this end time let it not be a mysterymen I want to look at two more scriptures let's go to Psalms 32 Psalms 32 and 1 blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered this is a Psalm of of David David knows what it's like to sin to fail to be chastened of the Lord blessed is he whose transgressions Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no guile when I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all day long for the day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moistures turned the drought of Summer CA I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgest the iniquity of my sin for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him David knew what it was like he knew what it was like to have the heavy hand of God upon him day and night his hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer I acknowledg my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions and Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin oh thank God if we confess our sins he'll forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness amen God's looking for Humble Hearts to just say I'm the man I'm the one David he said I'm the one I'm guilty when the Prophet come and laid it out he said I'm guilty of that and then you know what the Judgment came but God says I have heard you and I have forgiven you of your sins immediately I have forgiven you of your sins did David suffer yes he suffered there was things that he did he had to suffer for he suffered in his family in fact the child that that that Beba conceived in their sin that child the the hand the hand of the Lord was upon that child and that child died it died and think oh what a heavy price to transgress the word of God but oh after the mour he Comfort his wife again and she conceived after after the rebuke after the repentance after the Judgment after the consequences were realized then all of a sudden God brings another conception and what's coming this time coming Solomon this time oh God restores God lifts up his purpose will never be defeated he's got a plan and that plan will never change David wasn't removed from King David was still established as king amen and then out of his loin would come Solomon amen through such tragedy God will bring it back into position and now Nathan didn't call him Solomon Nathan called him jedadiah and jedadiah means whom the Lord loveth oh praise God his forgiveness is great his Mercy is new every morning what did it take a humble heart of repentance I want to read I'm just going to quote to you out of Hosea it's a short scripture hose Hosea 61 come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up you know when a daddy gives chastisement the hand that scores is also the hand that Comforts The Hand That judges is also the hand that restores amen never to destroy but always to keep that son or daughter in their position am God's the same way he is broken but he will bind us up he is smitten but he will heal what's he looking for a surrendered heart I want to finish with Proverbs chapter 4 Proverbs chapter 4 4 verse 18 Proverbs 4:18 but the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more until the perfect day that's the path that God wants to keep us on the the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day amen that's why when we step to the right his rod and his staff they comfort me we wander to the left his rod and the staff to comfort me because this path of light will shine more and more to the perfect day this is what God wants for us he's got a purpose he's got a plan and he wants us to submit to his word and surrender to him and let him as the great Shepherd guide us and keep us in our purpose if we step out will there be a rod absolutely he's a good shepherd will there be chastisement yes he's a good father but will he bring us back in the way absolutely that was always the intended purpose judgment is corrective to keep us in his plan so that we will not be lost with the world oh I thank god let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come brother John if you'll come as well the scripture gives so many analogies of us we are like sheep that Wonder but we have a Shepherd who brings us back we are like children who can error but we have a father who will correct us begins to use all of these analogies to show us that in this Walk we're going to need his guiding hand we're going to need his leadership we're also going to need his correction we're going to need God to keep us in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and I'm so glad it's for his name's sake I want if God could help me I want to always be like David forgive me Lord I'm sorry I want always be like Z Isaiah Woe Is Me Lord I want to always be like job I bore myself and repent and dust and Ashes amen going to realize this flesh is Fallen this flesh is nothing this flesh has to change and I don't want to trust it but I want to stand every hour and doubt and judge this guy judgment must begin at the house of the Lord let's bow our heads and pray together Lord Jesus help us God God we realize under the power of your word under the anointing that you've sent forth God there's so many things Lord we need to grow in there's so many areas some that we're not even yet aware of I'm sure for we've seen your pattern in our life how you've grown us from where we were to where we are now and I know you intend to grow us further Lord God I just yield under your pruning hand and you are the great husbandman Lord I'm connected to that vine Lord please I pray Lord that you would do your work and help me not to resist help me not to Flinch Lord God sometimes it's unpleasant sometimes it's it makes us anxious Lord sometimes it's hard but help us not to Flinch under your surgical hand as you prune Lord the the branch Lord I pray that you would help me to bring forth more fruit God I pray that I could stand like Isaiah as you lift your word higher and higher job when he got a greater Revelation than he ever had before may we always realize Lord that we are so dependent upon you we need you we're sheep that can wander so easily off the path we're children that can be so blind to the dangers all around us we can so quickly take on something that's not right but God as a father and as a shepherd and as a husbandman will you keep us going the way you want us to grow will you keep leading Us in the path that shineth brighter and brighter to the the perfect day God give us a heart to yield give us a heart to surrender Lord open us up and show us where we're failing Lord give us a heart to repent Lord as your children have always done now help us to be zealous to repent in this age that we might be all you've called us to be that you might be able to take us like you did job and put us back in position like you did Isaiah to bring us to a furtherance of the work Lord like you do for that little plant Lord that you might have it bring forth more fruit may we be in that category of bringing forth more of going further amen of being put back in position For Your Glory help us today to surrender in every day day to surrender we love you God and we ask for your help Lord we ask that you would guide us lead us Lord I pray God I pray under the anointing of the word and Lord may you do heart surgery today and not just heart surgery to open and expose but also to heal Lord you have broken you have smitten I pray that you bind up and you heal I pray that you would pour the oil Lord of Gilead in pour the oil of your spirit in on our wounds where you've opened us and remove something that's not right where we've surrendered to you our failures our faults our our shortcomings Lord I

we want to serve your purpose in this life bring your healing now I pray Lift us into position that we might walk forward in your glory I love you God and I thank you for your goodness I thank you for your word I thank you for the treasures that are hidden in your word those who lift th those Treasures that lift us up those Treasures that pull us down for it's all necessary Lord for us to grow help
