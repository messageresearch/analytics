[0:00] the character comes from the seed
[0:02] because all the fruit comes from the
[0:03] seed
[0:04] fruit always comes from the seed and the
[0:06] seed is in your soul amen but it's
[0:08] quickened the life but what has to
[0:10] happen the outside has got to be shaped
[0:13] so the inside as it grows can reflect
[0:16] the right characteristics and the right
[0:17] nature
[0:19] so what does God have to do to us he has
[0:21] to shape us
[0:23] he has to knock off that came from
[0:26] Grandpa that now that part of
[0:29] faithfulness can come from Grandpa he
[0:30] wants that
[0:32] now that temper that comes from Grandpa
[0:33] he doesn't want that
[0:35] all right that loveliness that come from
[0:38] Grandma that Sweet Disposition he wants
[0:40] that amen but that gossip Spirit from
[0:42] Grandma he doesn't want that
[0:46] so now you see the end time evangelism
[0:49] is not just finding the Stones it's
[0:52] shaping the stones amen and we've got to
[0:55] be shaped we've got to be cut by the
[0:57] word of God and there has to be a stone
[0:59] Mason in our life to help cut us and
[1:01] that stone Mason can work through many
[1:03] different gifts but that stone Mason is
[1:05] Christ and what's he doing he's never
[1:07] trying to destroy the stone he's trying
[1:10] to bring the stone into the image he had
[1:12] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:14] world because that stone is
[1:17] predestinated to fit into this spot no
[1:20] other Stone will fit and this Stone
[1:21] won't fit until it's shaped until it's
[1:24] shaped and it's fit every other Stone
[1:26] will be thrown off
[1:29] so part of the end time evangelism
[1:33] you say I believe the message I believe
[1:35] God sent a prophet I have a revelation
[1:36] in the seals I know the seals are open I
[1:39] know Christ took the book and loosen
[1:40] seals I know all of that
[1:43] so why are you still here
[1:47] why are you still living a daily life
[1:49] why are you still going to work dealing
[1:51] with family and having storm blow
[1:53] shingles off your roof and
[1:57] having temperament problems at work and
[1:59] why are we still coming to church week
[2:01] after week and the routine of coming why
[2:03] are we doing that
[2:05] we know the message we know God sent a
[2:07] prophet we know we're elected we know
[2:09] we're Pride we know the seals are open
[2:11] we know
[2:13] maybe we're still here because he's
[2:15] shaping us
[2:17] maybe he's bringing us into the perfect
[2:19] stature of a perfect man until we can
[2:22] perfectly reflect the life of Jesus
[2:23] Christ
[2:25] why we don't skip church
[2:28] not for legalism
[2:30] for necessity
[2:33] because there's this little thing
[2:35] jetting out the side of the stone that
[2:37] keeps causing me problems whenever I get
[2:39] near another Stone I need somebody who's
[2:41] got a sharp tool to whack that thing off
[2:43] of me and it may be the guy in the
[2:45] Pulpit that Sunday that does it or it
[2:47] may be the sister and the foyer that
[2:48] does it for me however it happens
[2:50] somebody's got to whack that thing off
[2:52] of me because it's causing me lots of
[2:54] problems
