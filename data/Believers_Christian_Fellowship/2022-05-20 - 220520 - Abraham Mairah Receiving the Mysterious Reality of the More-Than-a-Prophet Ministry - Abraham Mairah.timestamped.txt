[16:32] [Music]
[16:36] [Applause]
[16:39] i hope i'm doing fine
[16:41] i greet you all saints in the name of
[16:43] lord jesus christ and
[16:45] maybe you may be seated for a moment
[16:49] yeah
[16:51] quite some time isn't it and um
[16:55] i'm thankful to the lord that he has
[16:56] kept you
[16:58] alive
[17:00] and not only alive physically but still
[17:02] loving him and serving him
[17:05] that is really special
[17:08] so i want to bring greetings from uganda
[17:11] from my family and church
[17:13] home church in particular
[17:15] and before i came here also i was in
[17:17] kenya
[17:18] some friends from nairobi and another
[17:21] place called naroq
[17:23] they emphasized and emphasized that i
[17:26] should
[17:27] bring their greetings to this fellowship
[17:31] so they love you so much and
[17:34] you don't know that there are so many
[17:36] people around the world who pray for you
[17:38] and of course
[17:39] um they appreciate
[17:42] the minister brother chad
[17:44] and you who are standing here
[17:47] i also appreciate you
[17:49] because
[17:50] friendship is only tasty when there is a
[17:52] friend
[17:54] so i mean you cannot talk about
[17:56] friendship when there is no friend
[17:59] and
[18:00] it makes a meaning that there is a
[18:02] brother there is a sister somewhere who
[18:04] loves you you love him
[18:06] and you value one another you try
[18:09] treasure one another that makes
[18:11] friendship you know something you can
[18:14] look to
[18:15] so
[18:16] as the brothers said it's been quite a
[18:18] while
[18:20] and um
[18:22] we kept praying for one another but you
[18:24] know things were more tougher here than
[18:26] i think the way in our place
[18:28] so but i thank god that you were all
[18:30] preserved in the world by the blood
[18:33] and we have come to meet one another
[18:37] well
[18:39] still waiting to go home one of these
[18:41] days
[18:42] so
[18:44] so far so good and um
[18:47] i've been once in a while you know
[18:50] listening to some of the summons
[18:52] preached here
[18:54] i have wonderful preachers here i can't
[18:56] see the other brother there i forget his
[18:58] name but i
[19:00] yeah
[19:01] straight across there and brother
[19:04] si bolt and
[19:06] brother kyle and pastor chad and all see
[19:10] you have been a blessing to many around
[19:12] the world
[19:13] so
[19:15] definitely we are not very far from
[19:17] going home
[19:19] because of what has happened
[19:21] this you know what we see around the
[19:23] world
[19:25] and we want to thank god that we see it
[19:27] from a different view
[19:29] than the whole world sees
[19:31] so the world is on their tenterhooks
[19:34] they are shaken they are trembling
[19:37] for us we are on sure ground
[19:40] we are actually happy
[19:43] and you should be happy that you are
[19:44] seeing these things
[19:46] because not everybody had a chance to
[19:48] see them
[19:51] yeah jesus one time told the disciples
[19:53] says when you shall see jerusalem
[19:55] surrounded by the enemies
[19:58] then it's time to flee to the mountains
[20:03] but how could they flee if they were
[20:04] surrounded within
[20:08] so at first they were surrounded within
[20:11] but that was a sign
[20:12] and then
[20:14] for no reason no known reason titus the
[20:17] roman
[20:18] general withdrew
[20:22] and went back
[20:23] so that it was it became a sign for
[20:25] these people to
[20:26] get out and then he came back again
[20:30] so this this coffee 19 and all these you
[20:34] know
[20:35] blockades here and there i think is a
[20:37] sign that something is coming
[20:41] and we have to be somewhere
[20:44] hidden away
[20:46] in christ jesus
[20:48] amen
[20:51] so i don't want to i don't have actually
[20:53] much to say but just to say that i love
[20:55] you
[20:56] and
[20:58] i
[20:59] i want to appreciate you that you
[21:01] permitted
[21:02] together with sister angie your pastor
[21:04] to visit us
[21:06] in uganda
[21:07] we had a wonderful time with him
[21:10] it was a blessing to us as a family a
[21:13] blessing to the church and the young
[21:15] robot of christ in uganda people are
[21:17] still talking about how they were
[21:19] blessed
[21:20] and and the impact of the meetings still
[21:23] resonating around so we appreciate you
[21:26] so much that was just recently i think
[21:29] in the month of
[21:31] december
[21:33] yeah i think the same or something so
[21:35] when he was in our place
[21:36] so we appreciate you so much
[21:39] and then i've also come to officially
[21:41] say
[21:42] i'm i'm inviting him
[21:47] that is just the kind way to invite him
[21:50] by standing here
[21:52] and then
[21:53] he comes over and i know you are good
[21:55] enough to permit him to come again
[21:58] amen
[21:59] so brother chad has been a special
[22:01] friend and
[22:02] i i want to say that i've been really
[22:04] blessed by his ministry and
[22:06] on wednesday when he was preaching here
[22:08] i said wow he has finished everything
[22:10] that was supposed to preach come on boy
[22:12] continue
[22:13] [Music]
[22:15] but it is very hard again to persuade
[22:18] him to con continue
[22:20] so
[22:21] i'm just praying that god helps me
[22:23] somehow to channel back into that and
[22:26] then say something
[22:27] so maybe let's stand up and have a word
[22:29] of prayer
[22:34] loving heavenly father once again after
[22:38] some time i'm here before your children
[22:42] we know we have been together in the
[22:44] spirit
[22:45] by your anointing and
[22:48] lord your hand has been upon us and kept
[22:50] us
[22:51] we cannot be thankful enough
[22:55] but especially to come here and find
[22:57] your children
[22:58] still serving you rejoicing at your
[23:01] world
[23:02] waiting for that grand hour
[23:05] lord when our bodies shall be changed
[23:09] i pray that god
[23:10] you know
[23:12] my weaknesses my limitations
[23:15] my tiredness over all this period of
[23:18] time
[23:19] laboring in the field
[23:21] you just pray that god you come and
[23:22] touch this body
[23:24] and law that you just help me to get out
[23:27] of the way
[23:28] and that you'll be the one to come and
[23:31] become a blessing to your children like
[23:33] you've always done
[23:35] and bless them lord god and bless us
[23:37] together
[23:38] lord as you
[23:40] lord unveil yourself through the
[23:42] breaking of the word
[23:44] anoint me
[23:45] and lord speak through these lips of
[23:48] clay
[23:49] that which you ordained
[23:50] to edify to strengthen and encourage
[23:53] your children
[23:54] we thank you
[23:55] because we know you have always been
[23:57] there for us
[23:58] in jesus name we pray
[24:00] amen
[24:03] um
[24:04] i just wanted us to turn to our bibles
[24:06] and i wanted us to start with the book
[24:08] of matthew
[24:11] chapter 21.
[24:31] matthew chapter 21 from verse 23 i think
[24:33] i'll read up to verse 27
[24:39] and when he came into the temple
[24:42] the chief priests and the elders of the
[24:44] people came out of him
[24:46] as he was teaching
[24:49] and he said by what authority
[24:52] do we style these things
[24:55] and who gave thee
[24:56] this authority
[25:01] and jesus answered and said unto them
[25:04] i also will ask you
[25:07] one thing
[25:09] which if you tell me
[25:11] i in likewise will tell you by what
[25:14] authority i do these things
[25:18] so in other words the question the
[25:20] answer to the question was in the
[25:22] question that it was going to give them
[25:30] the baptism of john
[25:32] whence was it
[25:34] from heaven
[25:35] or of man
[25:39] and they reasoned with themselves
[25:41] saying if we shall say
[25:43] from heaven he will say unto us why did
[25:47] he did he not believe him
[25:51] but if we shall say of men
[25:54] we fear the people for all hold him as a
[25:59] prophet
[26:00] now i want you to mark that statement
[26:03] they hold him
[26:04] as a prophet
[26:10] and they answered jesus
[26:12] and said
[26:14] we cannot tell
[26:16] and he said
[26:17] unto them neither tell i you by what
[26:21] authority i do these things
[26:24] so there was a statement
[26:31] and if you'll see in this chapter in
[26:34] verse 12 he speaks again about john the
[26:37] baptist
[26:39] he says
[26:40] for john came unto you in the way of
[26:43] righteousness
[26:44] and you believed him not
[26:47] but the publicans and the hallows
[26:49] believed him
[26:51] and he
[26:52] when you had seen it repented the note
[26:55] afterwards
[26:56] that you might be that you might believe
[26:58] him
[27:02] why
[27:04] he brings it again and then
[27:07] at the end of this chapter there is
[27:08] something again strange
[27:11] in verse 45
[27:14] and when the chief priests and pharisees
[27:17] had had he had this parable
[27:19] they perceived that he speak of
[27:22] them
[27:25] but when they sought to lay hands on him
[27:29] they feared a multitude why
[27:32] because they took him for a prophet
[27:39] so the maori took jesus for a prophet
[27:44] and they also
[27:46] held john
[27:47] for
[27:48] a prophet
[27:55] may god bless his word and bless you may
[27:58] be seated
[27:59] i wanted us as we see it
[28:03] to go back to matthew chapter 11
[28:07] and see why jesus points this book back
[28:11] to john the baptist
[28:14] because in matthew 11
[28:17] from verse 2
[28:19] now when john had had in the prison the
[28:22] works of christ he sent two of his
[28:25] disciples and said unto them
[28:28] i mean
[28:29] say it unto him and thou he
[28:32] that should come or do we look for
[28:34] another now this is the man who
[28:36] introduced him
[28:40] but we are trying to follow a thought
[28:43] that i want us to follow like a trail
[28:45] through these meetings
[28:49] why did such things happen
[28:52] they were not a mistake
[28:55] they were right in goddess per person
[28:57] plan
[29:01] john who introduced jesus is sending the
[29:04] disciples to inquire whether he's the
[29:06] messiah or they should look for another
[29:14] and jesus doesn't go on a condemning
[29:17] spree
[29:18] castigating and belittling
[29:22] john the baptist no
[29:25] but he points
[29:27] to the resultant effect
[29:30] or product of what john introduced
[29:39] and jesus that's verse 4 answer and said
[29:41] unto them go and show john again
[29:44] the things which you do hear and see
[29:48] the blind receive their sight
[29:52] the lamb walk
[29:53] the lepers are cleansed the death here
[29:56] the dead are raised up the poor have the
[30:00] gospel preached to them
[30:04] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[30:07] offended in me and as they departed
[30:10] jesus began to say to the multitudes
[30:13] concerning john
[30:17] what he went out
[30:19] into the wilderness to see a reed shaken
[30:23] with the wind
[30:26] but what went he out for to see a man
[30:28] clothed in soft raiment
[30:32] behold either way a softer clothing and
[30:34] the king's houses
[30:36] but wait what went he out for to see
[30:40] a prophet
[30:41] yeah
[30:42] and i say unto you
[30:46] and more than a prophet
[30:52] for this is of whom it is written behold
[30:54] i send my messenger before thy face
[30:57] which shall prepare thy way before thee
[31:00] verily sent you among them that are born
[31:02] of women there has not risen a greater
[31:06] than john the baptist of all born of
[31:09] women in other words with only the
[31:11] exception of himself the speaker jesus
[31:14] christ and adam
[31:21] the rest
[31:23] john the baptist was greater than them
[31:27] but i want us to look at how could you
[31:29] compare the ministry of john the baptist
[31:32] with the minister of moses
[31:35] if it was in comparison terms of the
[31:37] supernatural the anointing the
[31:40] prophecies the miracles the signs and
[31:43] wonders the demonstration of power
[31:46] how could john stand a chance
[31:51] to be compared with moses
[31:54] how could he even be compared with the
[31:56] right i mean
[31:58] isaiah
[32:02] we've even done here
[32:07] all those prophets
[32:09] if you've got to look at the
[32:10] supernatural the miraculous the signs
[32:14] they were all above
[32:16] john
[32:18] but why is jesus saying of all that is
[32:20] born that are born of women
[32:22] no one is greater than john the baptist
[32:26] and john the baptist was so scared down
[32:30] in the spiritual and prophecies
[32:33] tell me 10 prophecies five of them which
[32:36] jolly baptist prophesied
[32:43] he was a prophet yes but what did he
[32:46] prophesy
[32:49] what did he tell us about the future
[32:56] and today we believe him to be a prophet
[32:59] and the bible says he's a prophet and
[33:01] jesus says he's more than a prophet
[33:05] and of all that we're born of women no
[33:08] one can come near to john the baptist
[33:15] so there is a mystery there
[33:20] that if god gives me the grace we could
[33:22] look at
[33:23] so
[33:24] when you begin to look at this what is
[33:26] jesus trying to draw the people to he
[33:29] says he's more than a prophet and of all
[33:32] other born of women
[33:35] there's not reason a greater than john
[33:37] the baptist
[33:39] not with his turning that is however
[33:43] the least he that is the least or least
[33:47] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than
[33:50] john he
[33:52] so the least in the kingdom of heaven is
[33:54] greater than john
[33:57] because those who are born in the
[33:59] kingdom of heaven are not born of women
[34:02] they are born of the incorruptible seed
[34:10] and john never became a christian
[34:15] he pointed the people to christ but he
[34:17] never became a christian and that's why
[34:19] a christian the least in the kingdom of
[34:21] christianity the kingdom of christ
[34:23] becomes greater than john
[34:26] because he remained within the confines
[34:29] of the or the dispensation of
[34:32] servant prophets
[34:34] but we are now in the dispensation of
[34:36] sons and daughters of god
[34:39] [Music]
[34:42] so john
[34:44] when he had a chance to be baptized he
[34:46] never went on to be baptized he only
[34:48] told jesus i have need of you to baptize
[34:51] me how do you come to me and jesus says
[34:53] fine i understand you you understand me
[34:55] let me baptize you i mean you baptize me
[34:58] suffer it to be so but after him
[35:00] baptizing jesus he never went also to
[35:03] tell jesus to baptize him
[35:07] so because he was not baptized he
[35:09] remained in the old testament
[35:11] dispensation
[35:14] so he remained a sovereign prophet not a
[35:16] sign a prophet
[35:20] that's why they list the kingdom of
[35:22] heaven
[35:23] in the kingdom of christ
[35:25] in the new dispensation of the new
[35:28] covenant which is the new testament
[35:31] he becomes the least
[35:33] but in the old testament all the
[35:35] dispensation those born of women
[35:38] those upon whom the holy spirit came
[35:41] upon not into
[35:46] no one was greater than john
[35:52] now i'm talking about receiving the
[35:55] mysterious reality of them more than a
[35:58] prophet ministry
[36:04] more than a prophet
[36:07] what was that more than a prophet
[36:11] blessed be the name of the lord jesus is
[36:13] saying you went to see
[36:15] whom do we do you go did you go to look
[36:17] for what did you go to see what did you
[36:20] go to receive and of course john the
[36:22] baptist
[36:23] parallels today
[36:25] as
[36:26] john the baptist was sent to foreign the
[36:28] first coming of jesus so
[36:31] shall your message
[36:33] for around the second coming
[36:37] so the question is what did you got to
[36:39] see
[36:42] what did he go in the wilderness to
[36:44] receive the sword of the king
[36:48] so what did you go to receive from him
[36:54] and until you know what you came to the
[36:58] message for
[37:02] you have missed it
[37:06] and that's why there is
[37:07] where people are hitting a snag they are
[37:10] no longer able to see where they are
[37:11] going they are in a spiritual focus they
[37:13] can't understand they have lost identity
[37:15] because they came to believe something
[37:18] they came to believe the message they
[37:20] came to hear a prophet
[37:22] they came to believe malachi 4
[37:24] but what they receive
[37:29] what did you go out for to receive
[37:33] what is that that you have said you are
[37:35] a believer you believe what
[37:38] what have you received what have you
[37:40] believed
[37:42] and that's why
[37:44] when they are questioning the authority
[37:46] of jesus
[37:48] the question about the source of the
[37:50] authority of jesus jesus puts them back
[37:54] to the one we introduced to him
[37:58] if you know what his message was
[38:02] if you knew if you had received that
[38:05] message
[38:07] if you knew why you went to the
[38:09] wilderness
[38:11] if you had received the reality of why
[38:14] you went to the wilderness what you were
[38:15] supposed to go and receive you will not
[38:17] be asking me with that question
[38:20] so the answer to your question is in the
[38:24] reason why you went into the wilderness
[38:26] but you well do a wilderness
[38:29] you when you put the effort you wanted
[38:31] there but you missed it
[38:35] so go back to your drawing boards and
[38:37] begin to find out why you went to the
[38:39] wilderness then you know
[38:41] why
[38:43] i have this authority so the authority
[38:46] that i have today
[38:48] begins from there
[38:52] when you receive the reality of your
[38:55] there is prophet
[38:56] what his real message is
[38:59] you get to know this
[39:03] but if you missed that you will not
[39:05] understand this
[39:11] blessed be the name of the lord and you
[39:13] see the reason many are hitting the snag
[39:16] and i wouldn't want you to reach that
[39:18] spot because very dangerous
[39:22] it's very important for you to know what
[39:25] you have received
[39:30] i mean it's good to come here to be a
[39:32] good believer to pay tithes and
[39:33] offerings to be a deacon to be a trustee
[39:35] to be a good preacher but you have seen
[39:37] that men have been good preachers and
[39:39] they have failed
[39:40] you can be a very good preacher you can
[39:42] be very anointed you can be very
[39:44] spiritual even even in the spirit and
[39:46] you have missed it
[39:53] because even judas missed it
[39:58] yet he was with the reality
[40:01] but he never got the revelation of what
[40:03] this man was
[40:06] who he was
[40:10] because brother abraham says what makes
[40:12] john the baptist stands out is because
[40:15] he was the messenger of the new covenant
[40:27] god was starting something and that was
[40:30] the alpha now we are in the omega
[40:33] the completion of that new covenant
[40:37] when all the loose ends are tied and the
[40:40] fullness of the word is brought
[40:43] and then you are introduced to him
[40:46] [Music]
[40:49] so the
[40:51] hymn christ is
[40:53] the step beyond the prophet so the
[40:56] message that you are supposed to receive
[40:58] is more than
[41:00] is beyond
[41:01] the prophet
[41:05] so you are not supposed just to hold him
[41:08] as a prophet
[41:10] the sanhedrin knew that the mountains
[41:13] held the journey as a prophet they even
[41:17] held jesus took jesus for a prophet they
[41:21] accepted him as a prophet until the the
[41:24] first season jesus christ feared to
[41:28] arrest jesus because they knew their
[41:30] mouth could stone them because the
[41:32] multitude believed that jesus was a
[41:35] prophet
[41:39] and they were even scared to say that
[41:41] the ministry of john the baptist was of
[41:43] them of men because they knew men could
[41:45] even he said easily stoning them
[41:49] men held john as a prophet but they
[41:54] ended with john as a prophet
[41:58] but john had a ministry
[42:03] a mysterious reality beyond the office
[42:06] of a prophet
[42:10] he was more than a prophet he brought a
[42:14] message and the message was greater than
[42:16] him and he was supposed to become a
[42:19] thing
[42:20] immediately he introduces the reality
[42:29] and that's why he could even begin to
[42:30] doubt what he spoke the other day
[42:34] and jesus didn't even think about it
[42:37] it didn't even matter to him
[42:41] he couldn't even talk about it and you
[42:43] look at this man he has vaccinated john
[42:46] had already finished his work he had
[42:49] already done his part and whether he was
[42:51] doubting or not it was not having his
[42:53] business as far as god was concerned his
[42:56] work was already done so you begin to
[42:59] look about his mistakes his failures his
[43:02] unbelief what he's saying at this time
[43:05] about the ministry that was no problem
[43:09] in other words there was an allowance
[43:12] for john to begin to express doubt over
[43:15] what he introduced
[43:16] an allowance and heaven never recognized
[43:19] that heaven recognized one thing john
[43:22] had already
[43:24] identified introduced their reality and
[43:28] showed them to the world here is the man
[43:33] and that's why you find those who hold
[43:35] the messenger of the day as a prophet
[43:38] they hold him as a prophet they put him
[43:40] in a prophetic office and they begin to
[43:42] examine him look he said this he said
[43:45] that he said this he said that
[43:48] why
[43:49] they hold him as a prophet
[43:51] they end on the prophetic office they
[43:54] are looking at the prophet but brother
[43:56] branham is more than a prophet
[43:59] [Applause]
[44:00] his ministry went beyond the prophetic
[44:02] office
[44:04] and every prophet there is another one
[44:06] for so many errors
[44:10] to blinding those who want to
[44:13] scientifically and critically look at
[44:16] the ministry
[44:17] [Music]
[44:23] lest they should see with their eyes
[44:26] and
[44:27] hear with their ears and understand with
[44:30] their hearts and that they should repent
[44:33] and i see the heart
[44:35] heal them
[44:40] why why did god you know i talked with
[44:42] brother chad one time we have not sold
[44:44] that question up to now
[44:47] moses was
[44:48] married to zipporah the median artist
[44:54] when did he marry
[44:56] the ethiopian human
[45:00] wasn't miriam right to complain
[45:04] wasn't medium legally right
[45:07] morally right
[45:11] when did the mothers married this
[45:15] ethiopian human
[45:18] who told him to
[45:20] does the bible say anything about it
[45:25] but miriam when he saw the mistake
[45:28] when she saw the mistake together with
[45:30] her brother aaron
[45:32] and they spoke about it
[45:36] god was silent
[45:38] so we don't know god is deal between
[45:40] moses
[45:42] between him and moses about the issue of
[45:45] marrying the ethiopian woman we don't
[45:47] know
[45:49] we don't know whether zipper had died or
[45:51] not the bible doesn't mention
[45:54] but he married an ethiopian woman this
[45:56] was the medianity human and miriam is
[45:59] complaining and aaron is complaining so
[46:01] biblically scripturally according to the
[46:03] law they are right
[46:08] this is an error and this is a prophet
[46:10] and this is an office and if he makes an
[46:12] error we have a right to point it out no
[46:15] right to point out
[46:18] god came down and said
[46:20] can't you fear god
[46:24] why was god protecting the error of
[46:26] moses
[46:31] can't we go back and look at that
[46:33] carefully
[46:41] why would god defend abraham
[46:45] for telling a lie
[46:47] and he makes
[46:49] a bemidji to pay a fine
[46:56] for taking the away the prophet his wife
[47:00] why would god do that
[47:03] there was a confidence between the two
[47:08] he had a message
[47:10] and the abraham's message was to sarah
[47:12] the church
[47:16] and and make no mistake about that he
[47:19] has a lot of errors and he kept telling
[47:21] lies but god never looked at them
[47:36] and he's like he had immunity
[47:41] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[47:43] does not impute
[47:47] so how does that scripture work unless
[47:49] that man is given the opportunity to do
[47:52] something wrong
[47:58] and who are you today question god why
[48:01] the other one is giving him
[48:03] you know
[48:04] that privilege which i'm not children
[48:07] i don't know
[48:09] i don't know god is deal
[48:13] my work was to receive the message not
[48:15] to examine the messenger
[48:20] remember my robins
[48:22] you remember the ravens
[48:24] you are not supposed to ask who whether
[48:26] they have sterilized they are big so not
[48:29] they are just commanded to bring you
[48:31] food
[48:33] just receive the food and eat no
[48:36] question where are you getting them
[48:37] sandwiches from
[48:39] did you sterilize your beaks
[48:44] i have commanded the reverence to feed
[48:46] you so they'll be bringing you food why
[48:49] didn't you send a dove god why did you
[48:51] decide to sin to send an cleaning bird
[48:54] don't ask me questions
[48:57] you needed a food
[49:02] are we going to tell god he was wrong to
[49:04] send this one he was supposed to send
[49:06] who
[49:07] what did he go to the wilderness look
[49:09] for mr perfect
[49:14] he no he was not mr perfect he was to
[49:16] introduce mr perfect but he was not mr
[49:19] perfect
[49:20] so don't begin to look at the introducer
[49:22] to be mr perfect
[49:24] he introduced mr perfect to you
[49:26] look the one he introduced to you
[49:31] so we are in a dangerous age where
[49:33] people are pointing you to the messenger
[49:37] they hold him
[49:44] are holding on him
[49:46] they are making him accountable
[49:48] to that office
[49:52] we shall begin to say maybe tomorrow who
[49:54] who is the culprit and who is the victim
[49:58] are you the believer who is the victim
[50:01] of the preacher
[50:02] or the preacher is also the victim
[50:08] you can say oh okay pastor chad you
[50:10] preached the word i mean i believed okay
[50:12] but i also didn't call myself to preach
[50:16] i was also saying what to preach the
[50:18] gospel
[50:21] so who is wrong
[50:24] who has a case
[50:26] i was warned to me if i don't preach the
[50:28] word the gospel and want you if you
[50:31] don't believe there gospel
[50:33] so if i preach it hard and it hurts you
[50:36] and say well that pastor has a problem
[50:38] okay i wouldn't have had a problem with
[50:39] you if i was not sent
[50:44] so are we going to turn and blame god no
[50:46] how can we how dare we
[50:50] so here we are
[50:51] do we blame the the vessel he said oh he
[50:54] blamed the sender and why did the center
[50:56] continue using the scent and he knows
[50:58] the scent has got a lot of problems
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] well according to god's big plan he's
[51:06] not interested so much in the weaknesses
[51:08] of the scent
[51:10] but he's interested in the purpose of
[51:12] the scent
[51:14] the message that he gave gave the
[51:15] messenger
[51:20] so there is a more than a prophet
[51:23] reality
[51:25] in other words
[51:27] when john
[51:29] questions
[51:31] jesus doesn't condemn
[51:34] jesus doesn't even speak anything
[51:36] negative
[51:38] he only magnifies what that office has
[51:42] done
[51:45] says i am the reality if you are
[51:48] doubting go and tell john what you see
[51:51] and what you hear
[51:56] john introduced this
[51:59] many have ended all john
[52:03] that's why even herod and his wife
[52:05] killed
[52:07] john
[52:08] because they held john responsible
[52:11] for what he preached
[52:20] now i'm not going to hold brother
[52:21] brandon i'm responsible for what he
[52:23] preached although he said i am
[52:25] responsible
[52:28] as long as he was god his voice he's not
[52:31] responsible for the message
[52:33] he was a pipe
[52:37] he was a vessel he was a channel that
[52:40] god used
[52:42] neither am i going to question the
[52:44] message based on the weakness
[52:46] of the messenger
[52:49] that's not my business that's god's
[52:51] business my business is to receive the
[52:53] reality
[52:55] going beyond the office of a prophet
[53:00] why let's look at this critically those
[53:02] who held who took jesus for a prophet
[53:06] electron denied him and condemned him
[53:08] and said crucify him
[53:14] do you know that even herod who killed
[53:17] john the baptist the bible says he had
[53:18] him gradually and and didn't want even
[53:21] to harm him but just to please his wife
[53:24] had put him in prison until a convenient
[53:26] they came
[53:30] but herod was not intending to kill john
[53:35] he took him for a prophet
[53:37] he believed john was a prophet
[53:41] but the one who believed john to be a
[53:43] prophet kill the jew
[53:45] when circumstances came when a
[53:48] convenient day
[53:52] came
[53:53] amen
[53:54] a day of convenience
[53:57] when another voice
[53:59] rises up
[54:00] to be vindictive
[54:02] to pin him he must die
[54:07] that voice must be dealt with
[54:11] he killed him
[54:12] so whoever ended with holding john only
[54:16] as a prophet
[54:17] that didn't benefit him
[54:20] the multitudes took him for a prophet
[54:23] the mountains took jesus for a prophet
[54:26] but it's a melody to say crucify him
[54:30] so we have to know
[54:33] what we went for in this message
[54:38] what did you go to see
[54:40] to receive
[54:41] and if you have believed what did you
[54:43] believe
[54:45] what is the message
[54:50] so when jesus went into the temple
[54:53] there was authority felt
[54:57] and today jesus comes into the temple
[54:59] which is temple the temple of his body
[55:02] the body of the bride
[55:03] and the authority this must be displayed
[55:07] and then the question begins to come
[55:09] where did you get this authority because
[55:12] the reality of what john introduced is
[55:15] now manifested in flesh he's walking on
[55:18] two feet
[55:21] and that's the answer
[55:24] i remember one brother was asking me
[55:26] brother abraham i had so and so tell me
[55:29] you prayed for him and and god healed
[55:31] him the constant you just prayed for him
[55:33] on the phone i said what's wrong
[55:35] so okay i wanted to ask you brother
[55:38] abraham um
[55:40] what are you
[55:41] becoming in this time
[55:44] are you another prophet
[55:47] are you another special brother to arise
[55:50] in the message
[55:51] i said come on what why are you asking
[55:53] me that
[55:56] i have never one day claimed that i'm a
[55:59] prophet
[56:02] i've never come here that i'm coming
[56:04] from uganda to come here and to prophesy
[56:06] about people discern people
[56:08] no
[56:10] i'm a preacher
[56:16] when you are questioning about the
[56:17] authority
[56:22] this ministry was it of william branham
[56:26] or was it from heaven
[56:30] where do we derive our authority
[56:33] is it from a man
[56:35] okay the minister of that man was it a
[56:38] man of god
[56:41] was it that he was trained was it
[56:44] because he was a good trader or raita
[56:46] good speaker
[56:48] fine polished fine character the man
[56:51] were accepted around the world
[56:53] supported by the denominational
[56:55] structures no
[56:57] who gave him authority
[57:00] the commission of an angel who sent the
[57:02] angel who was the angel
[57:04] [Applause]
[57:06] if you shall get the people to believe
[57:07] you if you shall be sincere
[57:10] and get the people to believe you
[57:12] nothing shall stand before you not even
[57:15] cancer
[57:18] where did the message come from where
[57:20] did the commission come from what was
[57:22] the source of the authority
[57:24] [Music]
[57:27] and he that receives a prophet in the
[57:29] name of the prophet received as a
[57:30] prophet said what and you know this is
[57:32] my time that's why i stand here and i
[57:35] have the privilege
[57:37] to step into the shoes
[57:39] of the supreme command
[57:42] as i was with moses so will i be with
[57:46] you as i was with elijah so will i be
[57:49] with you you are in the time of elisha
[57:54] [Music]
[57:56] who gave you this authority
[58:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:07] then
[58:08] i mean there is that question that there
[58:10] is that
[58:12] let me call it a vacuum
[58:14] that someone is not supposed to step
[58:15] there
[58:18] you are not supposed to say
[58:21] i mean one brother was telling me i was
[58:23] preaching somewhere and then he was
[58:24] telling me for us we don't believe in
[58:26] supernatural
[58:29] i said
[58:30] well that means you don't even believe
[58:32] in god because god is financial
[58:40] because i mean i believe in the
[58:41] spiritual god
[58:45] so
[58:45] he's not just spanish or by title
[58:48] he's exponential by action
[58:51] that is what he is
[58:55] and i'm not about here to talk about
[58:57] dead religion i said brother you see
[59:00] these things you know we we we have the
[59:02] word
[59:04] you are you know it's not about this and
[59:06] that i said what about the word
[59:10] the word made flesh what does it do
[59:14] you mean jesus was not the word
[59:18] i think jesus was the word made flesh
[59:20] he was the anointed one and what did he
[59:23] do
[59:25] he was not a backup unless we shall
[59:27] watch a man moving around looking down
[59:30] in the face of demons
[59:34] he was anointed
[59:36] wherever he went demons was
[59:38] screaming
[59:41] he was not running away from demons and
[59:43] hiding and trying to avoid the contact
[59:45] with demons and or cult world
[59:50] he knew who he was he was god many flesh
[59:54] so now the whole thing is
[59:56] because they have ended on the office of
[1:00:00] the prophet
[1:00:02] and the devil wants you as long as you
[1:00:04] end on the office of the prophet
[1:00:08] you are a very comfortable person for
[1:00:10] the devil
[1:00:14] very comfortable
[1:00:17] and the devil says please remain there
[1:00:23] but this one was more than
[1:00:26] a perfect
[1:00:28] just like john the baptist was more than
[1:00:30] a prophet
[1:00:32] so the more part
[1:00:35] going beyond the office here
[1:00:37] to what was introduced is what the devil
[1:00:40] doesn't want
[1:00:43] but i'm not here to give the devil what
[1:00:45] he wants
[1:00:49] remember
[1:00:53] he was the embodiment of the mysterious
[1:00:57] but glorious reality of the more than a
[1:01:00] prophet ministry jesus was amen
[1:01:05] blessed be the name of the lord and now
[1:01:07] today the source of his authority that
[1:01:10] is in us
[1:01:12] should be the product
[1:01:14] of the fact that we received the god
[1:01:17] we received what god sent beyond the
[1:01:20] office because the office just delivered
[1:01:25] what was handed over to it to deliver
[1:01:31] and i want you to look at jesus when he
[1:01:35] is introduced in the world you look at
[1:01:37] something strange here
[1:01:39] i mean how the angel was introducing
[1:01:42] jesus
[1:01:43] to the mother the physical marry
[1:01:46] you look at this verse here in john i
[1:01:48] mean luke chapter 1
[1:01:50] in luke chapter 1
[1:01:53] in verse 35 he says
[1:01:55] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:01:58] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:02:02] and the power of the highest shall
[1:02:04] overshadow thee now listen there are for
[1:02:08] also that holy thing that shall be born
[1:02:10] of thee shall be called the son of god
[1:02:13] now
[1:02:14] can you imagine god
[1:02:16] calling
[1:02:17] this person that is going to be born a
[1:02:20] holy thing
[1:02:26] not the right reverent doctor most holy
[1:02:29] precious
[1:02:41] an angel is describing jesus
[1:02:44] and he says that holy
[1:02:46] thing that shall be born of you
[1:02:54] now if jesus the one you are going to
[1:02:56] deliver is the holy thing
[1:02:59] not even a gentle man not the right
[1:03:02] reverend this
[1:03:05] phd
[1:03:07] this and that a whole thing
[1:03:12] because it's just going to do a
[1:03:13] particular work a particular service
[1:03:18] he stepped into time and put on this
[1:03:20] flesh this flesh is a thing
[1:03:25] the purpose for the flesh is the most
[1:03:27] important thing not the flesh the flesh
[1:03:30] is the thing
[1:03:36] and if you want to be treated with
[1:03:37] dignity with respect you feel that you
[1:03:40] know embracing the reality of the
[1:03:42] message is going to be to turn you into
[1:03:44] a fanatic people are going to look at
[1:03:46] you as some you know already degraded
[1:03:49] the ranged you know person and so i
[1:03:52] cannot go the other side i have to
[1:03:53] remain in the office lest i become a
[1:03:56] thing
[1:04:02] i was telling brother child when he was
[1:04:04] you know i pray i say sometimes god
[1:04:06] can't even put you there so you just
[1:04:08] become a necessary evil
[1:04:11] they ask you can be a necessary evil
[1:04:14] that people even only run into
[1:04:16] when they must but you're not even
[1:04:18] bother i mean you don't matter most of
[1:04:20] the time you are nothing
[1:04:23] so when you come to serving god if god
[1:04:26] could declare and call his own himself
[1:04:29] a thing
[1:04:35] and then you want to be some special big
[1:04:38] brother this sister this and everybody
[1:04:41] say coming greeting and say you are the
[1:04:44] man of the hour uh we really love you
[1:04:46] brother we i mean don't you bother
[1:04:49] whether all people call you a thing
[1:04:51] whether everybody sees you nothing
[1:04:56] after all that is the description of how
[1:04:58] god described himself when he came that
[1:05:01] body is a thing
[1:05:03] but the purpose this which the body is
[1:05:05] going to serve is the greatest thing
[1:05:07] it's the most important part but the
[1:05:10] body is a thing so this bird of yours is
[1:05:12] a thing but the reality the purpose why
[1:05:15] we are here is the most important
[1:05:23] the devil wants to always have feelings
[1:05:27] and because of those feelings and
[1:05:28] association
[1:05:30] if i believe this if i go beyond the
[1:05:33] prophet
[1:05:34] and yet i must go beyond step beyond the
[1:05:38] prophet's office and then all my friends
[1:05:41] my associates my my my other brothers
[1:05:44] that we preach the same line of vision
[1:05:46] will will see me as a thing
[1:05:52] jesus never gave himself god never gave
[1:05:54] himself a good name he never gave
[1:05:56] himself a title
[1:05:58] he told the mayor you are going to
[1:05:59] produce a thing
[1:06:08] a thing that is going to be stunned that
[1:06:11] is going to be spot on that's going to
[1:06:12] be killed that's going to be hanged
[1:06:15] naked that's going to be laughed at and
[1:06:18] beaten
[1:06:19] you know until it will be shapeless
[1:06:26] so the purpose is beyond
[1:06:29] the purpose is beyond the flesh so the
[1:06:32] flesh is a thing
[1:06:40] so we can begin to look at this now
[1:06:43] how that the church
[1:06:45] wants to remain within the comfort zone
[1:06:54] you regard so much your body
[1:06:57] but your body is a thing
[1:07:01] that one day will die if it is a
[1:07:04] tomorrow anyway
[1:07:06] but if he doesn't die
[1:07:08] then what is going to happen
[1:07:10] just excuse me what is going to happen
[1:07:13] what's going to happen
[1:07:15] it will need
[1:07:16] more than the body to transform you
[1:07:21] i was telling that brother you you
[1:07:22] believed to go and you go in the rupture
[1:07:24] and said yes i said
[1:07:26] want itself be supernatural
[1:07:32] how will you go into the rupture how
[1:07:33] will you be changed
[1:07:36] would that take supernatural power
[1:07:39] and yet you don't believe in the spinach
[1:07:43] something is wrong somewhere
[1:07:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:52] glory glory
[1:07:54] so let's let's go down here the prophet
[1:07:56] says now listen listen to this you say
[1:07:58] brother abraham i have no power neither
[1:08:01] do i i don't have any power well brother
[1:08:04] branham i am a weakling so am i
[1:08:07] but i'm not depending in my oh on my
[1:08:10] strength it ain't my strength i'm
[1:08:13] depending on my authority
[1:08:19] see
[1:08:20] my authority given
[1:08:22] me
[1:08:23] is not means who is strong it ain't
[1:08:27] strength he is strong
[1:08:30] i am his
[1:08:33] so because i am his his strength his
[1:08:36] authority his power his anointing his
[1:08:39] glory is mine
[1:08:42] so i am the body
[1:08:47] that jesus is dwelling in now
[1:08:52] and i must go beyond the office because
[1:08:55] the office introduced
[1:08:57] christ introduced jesus
[1:09:01] that's what brother brahma did he
[1:09:03] introduced jesus
[1:09:05] and he's continues to say
[1:09:09] and he says
[1:09:13] let me leave this because
[1:09:17] i have here
[1:09:18] something he says john kept saying i am
[1:09:22] nothing
[1:09:23] i am nothing
[1:09:24] i'm not even worthy to lose his issues
[1:09:30] but now listen
[1:09:32] but what about when jesus
[1:09:34] just said about him
[1:09:37] he said
[1:09:38] who do you go out to see yeah yeah did
[1:09:41] you go to see a really shaken with a
[1:09:43] wind oh why did you go out to see some
[1:09:45] man in final rayman and luxor and things
[1:09:48] say they are in the king's palace
[1:09:50] but if you go to see a prophet i say yes
[1:09:53] and more than a prophet he was more than
[1:09:55] a prophet because he was a messenger of
[1:09:58] the confidence
[1:10:02] that's what he was
[1:10:04] he was more than a prophet and he said
[1:10:06] there's never been a man born of a woman
[1:10:08] as great as him
[1:10:10] to this time
[1:10:12] see
[1:10:15] he says
[1:10:17] that's what it was see he was a
[1:10:19] messenger of the covenant he was the one
[1:10:21] that introduced
[1:10:23] and he said this is him
[1:10:26] all other prophets spoke of him but john
[1:10:29] said
[1:10:30] this is him
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] and we thank god that we are living in
[1:10:38] that time again
[1:10:44] we are not talking about talking this
[1:10:46] message doesn't talk about jesus this
[1:10:49] message is jesus
[1:10:50] [Applause]
[1:10:53] we don't point he people to him
[1:10:56] he's here
[1:10:58] he's in you
[1:11:02] as the brother i was preaching the other
[1:11:04] day you are just going to realize what
[1:11:06] is new that's all
[1:11:10] but he never wants to keep you pointing
[1:11:14] i'm waiting for jesus
[1:11:16] jesus will come
[1:11:18] come from where
[1:11:24] and go where
[1:11:27] blessed peter mother
[1:11:30] so
[1:11:31] he was the end of the covenant what was
[1:11:33] the covenant and revelation chapter 10
[1:11:36] he comes down as the end of the covenant
[1:11:38] with the cloud with a raining ball
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:43] with an opening book
[1:11:46] and the mysteries are you know revealed
[1:11:49] the thunders roll out and then you are
[1:11:51] supposed to go and take the book and eat
[1:11:52] the book in other words the continuation
[1:11:56] of the message of the covenant
[1:11:59] by that seminar and you got the angel
[1:12:01] and said give me the book
[1:12:08] so because he was the messenger of the
[1:12:10] covenant
[1:12:12] that's why he was greater than all born
[1:12:16] of women and for us we have double
[1:12:18] portion double person because
[1:12:21] we are also receiving the message of the
[1:12:25] messenger of the covenant
[1:12:28] so the angel with a book
[1:12:33] the angel of the covenant
[1:12:35] you go to him and take the book
[1:12:38] and eat the book
[1:12:39] and digest the book and then you are
[1:12:41] supposed to prophesy again
[1:12:46] not only that
[1:12:47] you are not just greater than he i mean
[1:12:50] like you are not in the capacity of john
[1:12:52] john was only greater than all that were
[1:12:54] born of women
[1:12:57] but for us
[1:12:59] we are born of the word
[1:13:02] the incorruptible seed the word of god
[1:13:05] himself and the prophet says if the
[1:13:08] devil wanted to stop it it's already
[1:13:10] spoke
[1:13:12] the word is already spoken unfortunately
[1:13:15] for the devil the word has already gone
[1:13:17] forth
[1:13:18] jesus god has already spoken it and the
[1:13:21] devil cannot and he do it he cannot make
[1:13:25] the word to be unspoken because it's
[1:13:27] already spoken
[1:13:30] and because spoken it is a seed that
[1:13:32] must come to pass and we had a
[1:13:34] manifestation of that and we are in the
[1:13:36] time of the glorious
[1:13:38] reality
[1:13:41] of the more than prophet
[1:13:44] mystery
[1:13:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:52] and that that reality he comes there he
[1:13:55] says
[1:13:57] of course he was not a reed shaken by
[1:13:59] denominational winds
[1:14:03] did you go to see that
[1:14:05] no
[1:14:07] not john
[1:14:10] you didn't go to see a sophisticated
[1:14:12] polished man of much education and good
[1:14:15] a good orator no
[1:14:18] you don't go to see a foolish faultless
[1:14:21] man with no error
[1:14:24] that's what they are looking for in the
[1:14:26] office of a prophet
[1:14:34] those are messages
[1:14:36] followers
[1:14:39] wherever the office goes they follow
[1:14:42] but for you you are not just a message
[1:14:45] believer but you are the message
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:53] and that's why god made
[1:14:54] sure in this
[1:14:57] end
[1:14:58] the destiny of the book was not just to
[1:15:01] be in the mind
[1:15:03] or held somewhere or in your drawers
[1:15:09] not even just message books
[1:15:12] and message tips i have all the tips of
[1:15:14] brother branham i have all the books
[1:15:18] but receiving the fullness of that in
[1:15:21] you that's why it says take the book and
[1:15:24] eat it so the destiny of the book this
[1:15:26] time with you
[1:15:29] god makes sure the devil can't touch it
[1:15:32] again
[1:15:34] it's finished
[1:15:35] it's a done deal the devil is defeated
[1:15:43] i was telling one brother i said brother
[1:15:45] i'm not going to do any give you one
[1:15:46] time
[1:15:48] i don't have anything to listen from you
[1:15:52] if i'm deceived i'm comfortably deceived
[1:15:58] but i thank god you know i'm not
[1:16:00] deceived
[1:16:02] because the most glorious part of my
[1:16:04] testimony is that god led me to the
[1:16:07] message
[1:16:10] so you are not going to come around and
[1:16:12] tell me that this message is wrong
[1:16:14] when me in the depths of that jungle in
[1:16:18] africa god leads me to the message and
[1:16:20] he has told me that this is the truth
[1:16:23] that i told you that i read you too who
[1:16:26] are you
[1:16:34] blessed be the name of the lord now let
[1:16:36] me i looked at
[1:16:38] john the baptist critically i said show
[1:16:41] me five prophecies of john the baptist
[1:16:47] that he prophesied is going to happen
[1:16:48] and it happened
[1:16:53] john the baptist what did he prophesy
[1:16:57] but he was the major prophet
[1:17:00] why
[1:17:00] connecting all prophecy to reality
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:08] that's the greatest
[1:17:10] prophecy
[1:17:12] and when they say we are going to
[1:17:14] prophesy again let me tell you something
[1:17:18] the culmination of all a prophecy of all
[1:17:20] the bible and all that we have preached
[1:17:22] and all the summons we have had is when
[1:17:25] you become him when you become the word
[1:17:32] until
[1:17:33] it will be like
[1:17:34] she is him
[1:17:36] [Applause]
[1:17:38] she has become exactly him
[1:17:42] that's what makes it a greater prophecy
[1:17:47] oh he prophesied this it didn't happen
[1:17:50] oh this one is yet to happen oh i mean
[1:17:53] they are looking at prophecies
[1:17:59] but johnny was the greatest prophet with
[1:18:01] no prophecies
[1:18:07] no signs
[1:18:09] no wonders
[1:18:13] show me how many people join me pray
[1:18:15] before they were here
[1:18:18] how many discernments
[1:18:22] let's go to the scriptures prove me by
[1:18:25] the scripture what prophecy did johnny
[1:18:26] make what disad me
[1:18:32] and yet he became the greatest of all
[1:18:33] greater than even isaiah who prophesied
[1:18:36] about the vagina
[1:18:38] and everything but this one is greater
[1:18:43] brother and moses yes
[1:18:45] the lord your god shall give you a sign
[1:18:47] there will be a man like me a prophet
[1:18:49] regret and this man is his brother and
[1:18:52] moses
[1:18:55] he's greater than jeremiah his greater
[1:18:57] than daniel his brother and all his
[1:18:59] prophets what is the criteria
[1:19:05] because he connected
[1:19:07] all prophecy
[1:19:09] to reality to the fulfilment
[1:19:15] glory be oh god
[1:19:21] and then you come
[1:19:22] today you people you are hearing all
[1:19:24] these forces these spirits that are
[1:19:26] trying to challenge the minister of
[1:19:27] brother and you know what they are
[1:19:29] trying to talk about some folks
[1:19:31] somewhere and i want to tell you they
[1:19:33] are there
[1:19:34] and god purpose that some of those folks
[1:19:36] be there
[1:19:45] that's why god intentionally left the
[1:19:47] mother says tamara
[1:19:54] and god never delivered moses from grace
[1:19:56] the wickedness of anger
[1:20:00] he was a prophet but he could bang down
[1:20:02] the tables of stone and break them
[1:20:08] yes
[1:20:10] he could smite the rock when they have
[1:20:12] told him to speak
[1:20:15] reaction of anger yes
[1:20:18] so did that disqualify him from bigger
[1:20:21] prophet
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:28] so god left those things for a reason
[1:20:30] isn't it
[1:20:33] so if you don't go beyond
[1:20:36] more than
[1:20:38] a prophet
[1:20:40] those who are remaining holding a
[1:20:42] prophet the officer they took him for a
[1:20:45] prophet so he's responsible for his
[1:20:47] office we are going to examine him in
[1:20:50] his office we are going to look at him
[1:20:52] we are looking he is just a victim like
[1:20:55] i am
[1:21:02] he told us very clear he said american
[1:21:04] tutor
[1:21:06] says my mother was having a lot of anger
[1:21:09] that he could do what
[1:21:11] there's a way he started he steps it
[1:21:13] he was a mixture of indian blood and
[1:21:16] this and that and irish
[1:21:20] why did the god look at that pick that
[1:21:23] why
[1:21:26] some of us if we look at the clans the
[1:21:29] origins that we came from
[1:21:32] i sometimes sit there and say lord why
[1:21:35] did you pick me
[1:21:38] there's could have been some better
[1:21:39] people but god makes sure he picks those
[1:21:42] ones from wretched background rotten
[1:21:45] ones
[1:21:51] you can imagine even jesus when he was
[1:21:53] born from an immaculate conception
[1:21:56] god on purpose made him to grow up in
[1:21:59] nazareth
[1:22:01] so that he's even called jesus of
[1:22:05] nazareth a caste city of the cast and
[1:22:09] failures of people who are not
[1:22:11] prosperous
[1:22:14] until when i was in israel in 2006 even
[1:22:18] our tour guide didn't want to enter
[1:22:20] nazareth
[1:22:21] because nasa is up to now is looked on
[1:22:24] you know from that
[1:22:27] as a city of the cast the seat of the
[1:22:30] failures
[1:22:31] the feet the city of the ancestors
[1:22:33] unsuccessful
[1:22:36] and then jesus is called jesus off
[1:22:42] and then the sanhedrin could emphasize
[1:22:44] that on the purpose and they even one
[1:22:46] time told nicodemus when he was saying
[1:22:49] there's even an arrow permits us to kill
[1:22:52] someone until we have had him say are
[1:22:54] you also a guardian
[1:22:57] search check examine the scriptures out
[1:23:00] of galilee arises know what
[1:23:02] prophet he they were scriptural
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:08] but in their being right scripturally
[1:23:11] they were off from god's will a million
[1:23:14] miles
[1:23:17] god had intention intentionally placed
[1:23:20] jesus
[1:23:22] another race
[1:23:24] and even called
[1:23:26] by the name of the wicked
[1:23:28] city
[1:23:31] to blind any of them
[1:23:34] so god's ways are not our ways
[1:23:43] that's why i'm asking you to think about
[1:23:45] it
[1:23:46] as we shall continue why was this man
[1:23:48] greater
[1:23:51] go and read the bible and come with some
[1:23:54] proof that john prophesied
[1:23:57] how many prophecies did he give
[1:24:00] and how many came to pass how many
[1:24:02] failed
[1:24:05] you never gave any prophecy johnny
[1:24:07] simply said the only prophecy said this
[1:24:11] the one whom
[1:24:13] who was preferred before me
[1:24:16] whom i'm not even worthy to unite his
[1:24:19] issues he's here
[1:24:24] and then he went on
[1:24:26] to identify him say behold the lamb of
[1:24:30] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:24:35] and god
[1:24:37] had told him that the one that you will
[1:24:39] be baptizing and you see the sign of the
[1:24:41] dove
[1:24:43] coming down upon him he is him
[1:24:48] so that was not even discernment god had
[1:24:51] showed him it to be a sign
[1:24:55] he didn't see jesus and discerning him
[1:24:57] no but that sign was to come
[1:25:04] okay now
[1:25:05] what does jesus say jesus said if you
[1:25:08] are to receive it this is that elijah
[1:25:12] who was for to come
[1:25:14] if you are to receive it if you are
[1:25:17] designed if you are man that does
[1:25:19] receive it
[1:25:21] if you are one of those for whom this
[1:25:24] package of mysteries is given
[1:25:26] you'll receive him as elijah but if you
[1:25:29] are not among this one you will of
[1:25:32] course not take him as a prophet and you
[1:25:35] will be very right
[1:25:38] scripturally scientifically
[1:25:41] and everything you prove him out
[1:25:45] if you take him verbatim by what he will
[1:25:47] say what did he say are you elijah no
[1:25:50] are you not a prophet no
[1:25:52] who are you i'm just the voice of him
[1:25:54] that is to come and
[1:25:56] crying in the wilderness
[1:25:58] so brother i give you to understand the
[1:26:01] prophet this man you are calling a
[1:26:02] prophet himself he denied
[1:26:05] he said i'm not and brother branham many
[1:26:07] times he says i am not maybe the one i
[1:26:09] am laying the foundation for him to come
[1:26:11] i'm laying the foundation that is on
[1:26:14] purpose
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:19] on purpose
[1:26:28] that's why he said it is broken
[1:26:30] but it's not broken
[1:26:32] public is
[1:26:34] the seal is broken it's not broken it's
[1:26:37] it's not
[1:26:38] so we just switch
[1:26:43] on purpose
[1:26:46] and then the others were he had said
[1:26:48] they are not revealed they are not
[1:26:51] they have quotes
[1:26:54] and even those who say john the baptist
[1:26:56] is not a prophet they have a quote it's
[1:26:58] there in the bible it's written
[1:27:01] he denied it
[1:27:02] but jesus says if you are president
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:07] this is him
[1:27:09] the elijah the alliance who wants to
[1:27:12] come
[1:27:13] so to you who are ready to receive it
[1:27:15] receive it and there are those who are
[1:27:16] not going to receive it they have their
[1:27:18] scripture
[1:27:21] this is to whom
[1:27:22] to those who take me
[1:27:25] me
[1:27:26] what i reveal to them and those who take
[1:27:29] the
[1:27:30] letter
[1:27:31] that is for those of the letter but this
[1:27:33] is to those who receive revelation
[1:27:36] now this is me revealing this to you
[1:27:39] he is him
[1:27:41] he is that prophet
[1:27:42] but the letter which is written there
[1:27:45] says he said i am not so the letter
[1:27:47] blinds them but now this is revelation
[1:27:50] so it's up to you which of the two are
[1:27:53] you going to take
[1:27:55] if you remain in the office of the
[1:27:57] prophet the prophet will deny that he is
[1:27:59] a prophet
[1:28:03] but if you go beyond
[1:28:05] more than a prophet and you go to what
[1:28:08] the prophet introduced so the one the
[1:28:11] prophet introduced will tell you the
[1:28:13] mystery
[1:28:14] of what he did and what he is
[1:28:17] and then you know how to treasure what
[1:28:20] he introduced
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:28:29] now you see
[1:28:30] was john the baptist is very successful
[1:28:32] in the ministry
[1:28:33] i bet not
[1:28:36] let's begin look at it
[1:28:38] how many disciples did he have not so
[1:28:40] many
[1:28:42] he baptized so many but how many remain
[1:28:44] in the church
[1:28:48] now let's look at how they were
[1:28:49] converted
[1:28:51] in john chapter one verse
[1:28:54] um in john chapter 1 verse 37 i mean
[1:28:57] satisfied i think let me look at that i
[1:28:59] have some little time
[1:29:02] john chapter one
[1:29:13] john chapter 1
[1:29:15] verse 35
[1:29:17] what does the bible say
[1:29:19] it says
[1:29:21] and the next day after jon stood and two
[1:29:24] of his disciples
[1:29:27] and looking upon jesus as he walked he
[1:29:29] says
[1:29:30] behold the lamb of god
[1:29:33] and the two disciples had him speak
[1:29:38] and he followed jesus
[1:29:41] why not all the disciples
[1:29:52] so the message
[1:29:54] even to the message believers
[1:29:56] was not to all
[1:30:02] the mysterious part that identifies the
[1:30:05] reality of the message
[1:30:09] was just
[1:30:10] made for very few and the bible says too
[1:30:16] why didn't he gather them all
[1:30:18] and just tell them that's the manner i
[1:30:21] was sent to introduce please me i'm
[1:30:23] disgreezing he must increase stop
[1:30:26] following me follow that man did he ever
[1:30:28] say that
[1:30:31] they still followed him and yet the
[1:30:34] reality was also there why didn't he say
[1:30:38] all of you
[1:30:40] pacquiao thinks follow that man
[1:30:44] it was to be done by revelation
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:55] by revelation not by command not by
[1:30:58] coercion
[1:31:02] yet they had believed the message
[1:31:06] but when he points out the reality of
[1:31:09] his message these ones the others are
[1:31:12] not seeing they are not even hearing but
[1:31:15] they are believing the message
[1:31:20] and they continue the following journey
[1:31:28] yet
[1:31:29] the one whom john had introduced had
[1:31:32] already come was on the sea
[1:31:35] but they still followed
[1:31:37] they still held
[1:31:38] on the office
[1:31:40] of the prophet
[1:31:46] yet the reality that the prophet
[1:31:48] introduced was here
[1:31:51] so the two
[1:31:53] who had
[1:31:56] followed
[1:31:58] why didn't others here
[1:32:04] isn't the bible interesting
[1:32:08] let's continue
[1:32:10] they followed him
[1:32:12] then jesus stand and saw them following
[1:32:15] he said congratulations you did he said
[1:32:18] congratulations you are the man of the
[1:32:20] hour praise the lord you've done it
[1:32:23] you've got it
[1:32:35] jesus stand and saw them following and
[1:32:37] he says unto him and to them what
[1:32:39] seeking
[1:32:42] what are you looking for
[1:32:45] and they say that to him rabbi
[1:32:51] and i said unto him rabbi which is to
[1:32:53] say being interpreted master where do it
[1:32:57] is down
[1:33:04] you see so you see the purpose
[1:33:07] of there following him was to go to
[1:33:09] where he dwells
[1:33:20] not because we have come to be blessed
[1:33:23] we've come to be healed we have come to
[1:33:25] get this we want you to do this for us
[1:33:28] but
[1:33:28] where do you dwell
[1:33:31] in my father's house are many
[1:33:34] mansions i go to prepare a place for you
[1:33:37] so the purpose of their following
[1:33:40] is to get to that
[1:33:42] i must reach his home
[1:33:45] i am the bride
[1:33:52] did you know that jesus
[1:33:54] said he didn't have where to dwell
[1:33:58] so where why particularly this time
[1:34:02] it was on purpose
[1:34:06] then he says unto them come and save
[1:34:12] and they came and saw where he dwelt and
[1:34:15] aborted with him that day for it was
[1:34:18] about in tennis hour
[1:34:21] now they even begin to name the names of
[1:34:23] those people
[1:34:28] but then the others remain
[1:34:31] among whom were those who were sent by
[1:34:33] john from prison
[1:34:35] go and find him
[1:34:37] ask him are you the one
[1:34:42] and there were message believers
[1:34:44] asking the reality of the message
[1:34:46] whether it is the truth
[1:34:55] that's why we still have people
[1:34:57] who are still believing the book is not
[1:34:59] open the scenes are not revealed the
[1:35:00] standards are all revealed and then they
[1:35:02] are looking to jesus when are you going
[1:35:04] to reveal these things
[1:35:09] well the prophet didn't finish
[1:35:11] everything
[1:35:12] we are looking for something
[1:35:14] can you give us the solution
[1:35:20] then we see another group a bunch of
[1:35:24] stunning baptists in acts chapter 19.
[1:35:30] about 12 of them
[1:35:34] who also get converted the letter in the
[1:35:36] apostolic ministry
[1:35:41] can imagine even the churches had it
[1:35:43] started deforming the pentecost was over
[1:35:46] the holocaust had come jesus even has
[1:35:49] left they missed the chance of walking
[1:35:52] with jesus physically
[1:35:54] and yet the main message of john was to
[1:35:58] point them to the messiah
[1:36:03] they missed the messiah
[1:36:06] they had to catch up later
[1:36:12] because it was not very clear it was not
[1:36:16] very
[1:36:17] direct that johnny would tell them
[1:36:20] please
[1:36:21] leave me got that man
[1:36:28] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:36:31] but we thank god that today's message is
[1:36:33] very clear but it's clear for those
[1:36:35] whose eyes have been enlightened but the
[1:36:37] rest of the people is still vague
[1:36:43] they are still even questioning whether
[1:36:44] the vindication of william ramos was
[1:36:47] enough
[1:36:48] millions of discernments and miracles
[1:36:51] and signs and wonders still is not
[1:36:54] enough and john the baptist who had not
[1:36:56] even won miracle he's believed to be a
[1:36:59] prophet
[1:37:02] you see the hypocrites of man
[1:37:06] why
[1:37:07] because john the baptist is in the past
[1:37:12] so it becomes very easy to believe that
[1:37:15] which is not of your age
[1:37:17] that which is past
[1:37:19] but now that which is of our debt
[1:37:29] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:37:32] so friend
[1:37:36] what went you out to see
[1:37:39] what do you come here to hear
[1:37:45] i was telling brother chad when we
[1:37:46] started preaching the message
[1:37:50] it was the dream of preachers around the
[1:37:52] world
[1:37:53] those days there were no
[1:37:55] tips were not there you could hear one
[1:37:58] person with a tape and everybody i want
[1:38:00] a tape
[1:38:01] a book was a message book was so
[1:38:03] precious
[1:38:04] you would just pick it from one another
[1:38:07] time came we had enough books
[1:38:10] enough tips
[1:38:12] but they became weaker
[1:38:16] we didn't have guitars we didn't have
[1:38:18] pianos and organs and so forth and we
[1:38:21] could sing if we had instruments in the
[1:38:24] church the music would be so good and
[1:38:26] people would enter in the spirit and
[1:38:27] worship the lord and then when we got
[1:38:30] the fast guitar the piano some of us
[1:38:33] know maybe here it's cheaper to get to
[1:38:35] them easier but not in our place
[1:38:37] so we people thought when we have a
[1:38:40] public address system and the church is
[1:38:42] having you know
[1:38:44] is
[1:38:45] good speakers and he has
[1:38:48] instruments for music and we have good
[1:38:50] song leaders and we have a good
[1:38:53] we shall have made it
[1:38:55] we had all those things and we have
[1:38:57] become ones
[1:39:04] we have had very good summons very good
[1:39:07] preachers until we become big-headed and
[1:39:10] just intelligent
[1:39:14] because we were thinking somebody's
[1:39:17] going to do for you a religion
[1:39:19] somebody's going to bring christ and
[1:39:21] throw him at you on your laps and say
[1:39:23] this is jesus
[1:39:25] no
[1:39:27] let's go
[1:39:28] to perfection
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:34] when those two heard
[1:39:36] they followed
[1:39:38] when you hear when you are you when the
[1:39:42] reality is identified go to it
[1:39:44] go to where the reality is now
[1:39:47] become it
[1:39:51] because we are going beyond now a church
[1:39:54] building a church service
[1:39:57] a church membership
[1:40:00] time has come to go beyond that
[1:40:06] beyond being just a message believer
[1:40:08] subscribing to certain doctrines it's
[1:40:11] not just even doctrine
[1:40:13] there are people who have got been very
[1:40:15] good very balanced in doctrines and now
[1:40:18] they are completely aware of come to
[1:40:20] organize organize the chaos
[1:40:22] finished
[1:40:25] and then you sit down and say what
[1:40:27] happened to that brother
[1:40:29] what happened the other one
[1:40:32] because they stuck they got stuck at the
[1:40:34] office
[1:40:35] holy prophet god set him prophet god
[1:40:38] sent a prophet
[1:40:40] one time i was you know i was in kampala
[1:40:44] and i was with another pastor
[1:40:46] i had gone to buy there's a brother who
[1:40:48] wanted to buy a vehicle
[1:40:50] and
[1:40:52] we got a mechanic who was a pentecostal
[1:40:55] to go and check the cars and so forth
[1:40:57] and we took time i i preached to the man
[1:40:59] and the man really got touched and then
[1:41:01] he says where is your church here in
[1:41:03] campara
[1:41:06] i would want to go and attend so i
[1:41:08] pointed it to the other pastor i said
[1:41:11] and then he went to the other pastor he
[1:41:12] says how do i reach your church
[1:41:15] where is it
[1:41:16] located how is it called
[1:41:20] and you know the greatest embarrassment
[1:41:21] that i got
[1:41:23] this is the man who
[1:41:24] a pastor who answers this one and says
[1:41:27] well have you heard of a bunch of
[1:41:29] people who are called branamites
[1:41:34] well we are branamites
[1:41:40] and then the parliament the custom
[1:41:42] pastor came to me and said
[1:41:44] so excuse me sir so you are branhamites
[1:41:46] you are not christians
[1:41:51] i said well
[1:41:52] maybe for him he is still at the door of
[1:41:54] bradham
[1:41:58] may i receive the christ because branny
[1:42:00] had pointed me to christ
[1:42:04] so i'm actually genuinely christian
[1:42:10] and you know that's the reason many
[1:42:12] ministries have not even been successful
[1:42:14] in evangelism because they all remind a
[1:42:16] person is do you know god sent a prophet
[1:42:20] i mean
[1:42:21] what does this person have to do with it
[1:42:23] god is sending a prophet
[1:42:26] he's a baby he doesn't even know the
[1:42:28] bible he doesn't know
[1:42:29] nothing in the bible
[1:42:31] and you are just giving throne throwing
[1:42:34] a burn to a baby and you expect this
[1:42:36] baby to chew the bone
[1:42:42] and he
[1:42:43] and then i asked him brother i said why
[1:42:45] did you say brother i'm not ashamed of
[1:42:47] the prophet
[1:42:51] i said
[1:42:54] a prophet
[1:42:55] now can you tell this man the prophet
[1:42:58] the prophecies of the prophet that can
[1:43:00] save him
[1:43:03] tell him the prophecies of the prophet
[1:43:07] that can save him now
[1:43:12] it's beyond the prophet
[1:43:14] it's the message
[1:43:16] he was a prophet messenger so you take
[1:43:20] the message that a prophet brought and
[1:43:23] live that life that presents that
[1:43:26] message
[1:43:30] but very many people are comfortable
[1:43:32] with that
[1:43:35] you have no problem i mean you can have
[1:43:37] as many
[1:43:39] you know photos of the prophet on your
[1:43:41] wall
[1:43:43] in your house can't even put it in your
[1:43:45] office but that does not bring christ in
[1:43:49] your life
[1:43:54] you can be so bold to be identified with
[1:43:58] a person of brother abraham
[1:44:00] but you are ashamed to be identified by
[1:44:03] the life
[1:44:04] of the man that the prophet identified
[1:44:07] the prophet introduced
[1:44:12] that's the reality
[1:44:14] and that's what is going to take us home
[1:44:18] glory be to god
[1:44:20] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:44:23] christ in the temple
[1:44:26] walking in the temple and then when the
[1:44:28] denomination is beginning to ask him
[1:44:30] what authority who gave you this
[1:44:32] authority because i received the reality
[1:44:36] that the prophet
[1:44:38] introduced
[1:44:39] so the reality now workers in the temple
[1:44:42] is here
[1:44:45] i am the answer to the question
[1:44:50] i have the answer to the question of the
[1:44:52] origin of authority the origin of
[1:44:54] authorities because i received the
[1:44:57] reality the message of the messenger i
[1:45:00] really am not stuck at the door of the
[1:45:02] office i'm not just holding him my
[1:45:05] prophet is my prophet okay why did he
[1:45:07] what did he prophesy
[1:45:12] and then
[1:45:13] if he's your prophet do you know that
[1:45:15] this is the time you are also supposed
[1:45:17] to professor
[1:45:21] he was your prophet and you are supposed
[1:45:22] to be somebody's prophet so what are you
[1:45:25] doing about it now
[1:45:27] don't get stuck i believe in my prophet
[1:45:29] god sent a prophet that's very wonderful
[1:45:34] but you have forgotten that you are
[1:45:35] supposed to be prophesying
[1:45:39] you are also a prophet sent by god to
[1:45:41] another person to nations and tongues
[1:45:43] and languages and multitudes
[1:45:48] glory to god
[1:45:50] god beyond
[1:45:52] more than a prophet
[1:45:54] he was more
[1:45:55] although he didn't make many prophets
[1:45:57] yeah i mean prophecies john was not
[1:45:59] really with thousands of prophecies that
[1:46:02] came to pass he prophesied this it
[1:46:04] happened he prophesied it happened this
[1:46:06] is what we are sometimes
[1:46:08] i i was telling one brother i don't have
[1:46:10] time to talk about prophecies
[1:46:16] there are thousands you listen to the
[1:46:18] tips
[1:46:19] read the books
[1:46:21] don't tell me about prophecies they are
[1:46:22] there
[1:46:25] we are now talking about the revealed
[1:46:27] one
[1:46:28] the reality
[1:46:31] that that prophet that prophet prophetic
[1:46:34] office pointed us to
[1:46:36] he says he is here
[1:46:38] he said look at your clock it's now two
[1:46:41] is it 2 30 pm
[1:46:43] end of second pool beginning of saturday
[1:46:46] pool
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:49] what is it the story pool what is the
[1:46:51] third pool the sword of the king that
[1:46:53] means the king is here he's holding the
[1:46:55] sword somebody go and receive this food
[1:46:58] hallelujah
[1:47:00] and for you you are pointing to who
[1:47:05] he was more than a prophet
[1:47:09] and friends
[1:47:10] this is our time
[1:47:12] let me finish by this
[1:47:16] he says
[1:47:19] 30 years after the birth of jesus
[1:47:22] there was that prince among the prophets
[1:47:24] and brother abraham is calling john the
[1:47:26] baptist the prince
[1:47:28] among the prophets so he was a prince
[1:47:31] prophet
[1:47:35] oh my
[1:47:36] john the baptist amen i mean all men
[1:47:39] knowed he was a prophet from god the
[1:47:41] foreigner of coming christ
[1:47:44] now they didn't all know that
[1:47:47] there is it is which is predicted again
[1:47:51] in the last days
[1:47:52] so we are going to have a prince of all
[1:47:54] prophets
[1:47:56] another one
[1:48:00] why
[1:48:01] he identifies the masterpiece
[1:48:06] the masterpiece groom for the
[1:48:08] masterpiece bride and there must be an
[1:48:10] invisible union
[1:48:15] so jesus said what would you go to see i
[1:48:18] really shake i mean what are we looking
[1:48:20] for
[1:48:21] we have looked for ministries and
[1:48:23] ministries have failed us we have looked
[1:48:25] for great preachers and great preachers
[1:48:27] have failed us we have looked for
[1:48:29] brothers to trust and brothers have let
[1:48:31] us down we have looked for good sisters
[1:48:33] and they can let you down
[1:48:35] but there is one that will never let you
[1:48:37] down and he came down himself
[1:48:40] that's why he came down he knew you
[1:48:43] would need him
[1:48:44] and that's why he took our america he
[1:48:46] fought so that we are not having our
[1:48:49] fixation on a man called william branham
[1:48:52] but the man who came
[1:48:55] the one who descended the one was
[1:48:57] identified the one was responsible
[1:49:00] for the continuation of this voice
[1:49:03] ministry of the bride the voice of
[1:49:05] christ himself in the body in the bright
[1:49:07] body
[1:49:11] so what are you looking for we are not
[1:49:14] looking for these ribs that are shaken
[1:49:17] by every today's this tomorrow is that
[1:49:21] you will see that in them if you are
[1:49:23] looking for great man
[1:49:27] john was not that
[1:49:29] amen and that's why john prophesied for
[1:49:32] only six
[1:49:34] months
[1:49:37] that's what the prophet says
[1:49:40] six months
[1:49:45] that was enough
[1:49:47] his message was very short
[1:49:50] what else should we do
[1:49:53] and he's the greatest of all of them the
[1:49:55] prince prophet
[1:49:58] rather even if you had it just two days
[1:50:01] is enough
[1:50:02] i i you need to experience that before
[1:50:04] we go home
[1:50:07] blessed but be the name of the lord he
[1:50:09] says he was not just to keep his clothes
[1:50:12] so and so and matching and this and tell
[1:50:14] him how he must dress and them kind that
[1:50:17] kisses the babies and staying kicking
[1:50:19] king's palaces and talks to public
[1:50:21] schools and so forth
[1:50:23] he was not a warrior he was not out from
[1:50:26] the line
[1:50:27] i mean he didn't even know how to handle
[1:50:32] a to edge this word so he says
[1:50:36] they are the kind that does that but
[1:50:38] what did you go out to see a prophet and
[1:50:41] now i say more than a prophet and then
[1:50:43] he says now listen to this great priest
[1:50:45] coming with a piece of sheep's skin
[1:50:47] wrapped around him living off the hubs
[1:50:50] of the woods hallelujah no theological
[1:50:52] seminary experience behind him but an
[1:50:54] experience that he had talked to god
[1:50:59] he had it from heaven
[1:51:02] and he was born for the purpose to do it
[1:51:05] the word spoke
[1:51:07] that he would come yes sir walked out on
[1:51:09] the banks of jordan with his feet in the
[1:51:11] mud don't you think you pharisees to say
[1:51:14] we have abraham to our father if i tell
[1:51:16] you god deserves these stones to raise
[1:51:18] up children to abraham you know that's
[1:51:21] what then he says that prince of the
[1:51:23] prophets the one that had the privilege
[1:51:26] of introducing the messiah and he saw
[1:51:29] the sign of the messiah and recognized
[1:51:32] it as that light fell from heaven
[1:51:36] isn't that what the prophet saw when he
[1:51:39] was baptizing the 17th pastor you know
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:45] and he says went upon him and he was
[1:51:48] witness to it
[1:51:51] so we see the repeat of that today
[1:51:55] so he comes and says
[1:51:58] nobody knows much about him he was just
[1:52:01] a man he was but he was a prophet he was
[1:52:04] hated my and what time did he rise
[1:52:08] right in the time of the popularity of
[1:52:09] israel when they had all went wildly and
[1:52:13] he got it out of there and it was a
[1:52:15] woman hater inverted you know
[1:52:17] he is inverted he was a woman hater
[1:52:20] yes sir she was and he loved the
[1:52:23] wilderness that was his nature and then
[1:52:26] people
[1:52:27] ought to know
[1:52:29] to have known when the pharaoh came out
[1:52:31] with that same spirit on him and came
[1:52:34] out this john not dressed all up like
[1:52:37] the celebrity as i said last night they
[1:52:40] kissed the babies and marian barr and so
[1:52:42] forth but this calm man came out of the
[1:52:44] wilderness
[1:52:46] a man what was he he loved the
[1:52:48] wilderness another thing he did he hated
[1:52:52] denomination
[1:52:53] now
[1:52:55] he was no compromiser
[1:52:58] he's describing john the type that was
[1:53:01] greater than all prophets
[1:53:05] loved the wilderness was a woman hater
[1:53:08] he could not compromise on the world
[1:53:13] he wasn't educated
[1:53:18] so
[1:53:19] what are we going to do with this man in
[1:53:21] this educated age
[1:53:26] with scientific examining research for
[1:53:29] minds
[1:53:31] that can suck things at the tip of the
[1:53:34] finger
[1:53:35] prove this wrong prove that right
[1:53:38] tick this cross these cans of this
[1:53:44] let me finish there are so many things
[1:53:46] but let me leave them he says now as a
[1:53:48] preacher
[1:53:50] i don't think that jesus was a great
[1:53:52] outstanding forceful preacher
[1:53:54] john the baptist was a preacher but he
[1:53:57] done no signs at all
[1:54:02] at all
[1:54:06] he never performed a miracle
[1:54:10] this is the prophet
[1:54:11] speaking
[1:54:13] but jesus came
[1:54:15] by not preaching so forceful as john
[1:54:18] but there were signs and wonders
[1:54:19] accompanying him now you look at it
[1:54:23] jesus is not as forceful but signs and
[1:54:25] wonders
[1:54:26] john is so forceful brief time no signs
[1:54:30] no in the wonders
[1:54:32] no miracles
[1:54:33] and no many prophecies
[1:54:37] but we believe him
[1:54:40] but heaven declared him as the greatest
[1:54:47] and the devil in this day
[1:54:49] is trying to
[1:54:51] you know blank out
[1:54:54] the ministry of william runner
[1:54:58] and trying to point out this and that
[1:55:00] and that and who are doing it
[1:55:05] those whose whose eyes were once
[1:55:09] enlightened
[1:55:13] tested of the good heavenly word
[1:55:18] preached it
[1:55:19] carried the evidence
[1:55:21] and showed others
[1:55:23] this land is good
[1:55:25] they have turned against it
[1:55:29] what is this for
[1:55:31] to prove to us that unless you go beyond
[1:55:34] the office
[1:55:37] of a prophet
[1:55:40] and take that reality that
[1:55:42] is beyond
[1:55:44] that office
[1:55:46] you are going to fail
[1:55:56] just one more thing here
[1:55:59] he says so i want to say this
[1:56:02] i've never said it before but according
[1:56:04] to scripture according to what he said
[1:56:07] 30 years
[1:56:09] 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river
[1:56:12] down there in 1933 rather
[1:56:15] what he said everything has happened
[1:56:18] just exactly
[1:56:21] the prophet didn't say it was going to
[1:56:23] happen
[1:56:25] he said it has already
[1:56:27] happened
[1:56:28] this is the message look away to jesus
[1:56:32] in other words look away from me
[1:56:36] look away from the prophet
[1:56:39] look away to jesus
[1:56:43] it's he says it has already happened why
[1:56:46] did he do this the angel tell him 1933
[1:56:49] as john was sent to forerun the first
[1:56:53] coming of jesus
[1:56:54] so shall your message
[1:56:56] foreign this second introduce jesus
[1:57:00] to the bride so he says it has already
[1:57:04] happened
[1:57:07] so jesus was already there
[1:57:10] while john is also elijah is also still
[1:57:14] around
[1:57:17] so those
[1:57:19] who wanted still remained with
[1:57:22] elijah
[1:57:23] elijah or john
[1:57:25] but those who saw and had the mystery
[1:57:29] followed jesus
[1:57:33] others will follow later
[1:57:42] but the message is such that you can
[1:57:44] actually comfortably remain at the
[1:57:47] office of the prophet
[1:57:50] or you can catch by revelation and go
[1:57:53] beyond
[1:57:55] more than
[1:57:57] the prophetic office
[1:57:59] so that you stop hearing this halabu
[1:58:01] that is going on around the prophetic
[1:58:03] office
[1:58:07] close your ears to this you are beyond
[1:58:09] that
[1:58:10] you have already left the office
[1:58:13] the office has already done its work
[1:58:15] they appointed you to the man
[1:58:19] so he says
[1:58:22] it has already happened exact just
[1:58:24] exactly i may not do it
[1:58:26] but this message will introduce jesus
[1:58:28] christ to the world and he says as john
[1:58:31] the baptist was sent to foreign they
[1:58:33] first come now listen to this this
[1:58:36] statement is confusing
[1:58:38] like it appears because he says what he
[1:58:41] told me has already happened in other
[1:58:44] words i have already introduced him
[1:58:47] but then he says
[1:58:49] i may not do it
[1:58:54] same quote same place
[1:58:57] [Laughter]
[1:58:58] i may not do it
[1:59:00] but this message
[1:59:03] like in acts 19
[1:59:06] can introduce the others letter
[1:59:11] to him
[1:59:13] but those who have picked the cue by
[1:59:14] revelation now they have already seen
[1:59:16] him
[1:59:19] just like john the baptist was sent to
[1:59:21] foreign the first coming so is this the
[1:59:24] message to foreign the second coming and
[1:59:26] john said behold the lamb of god
[1:59:29] that takes away the seed of the word in
[1:59:31] other words
[1:59:32] it was not the message after john
[1:59:35] it was john speaking introducing
[1:59:39] the reality when he was still alive
[1:59:43] and those who caught it by revelation
[1:59:45] followed by those who deemed
[1:59:48] waited until he was dead
[1:59:53] then they followed
[1:59:59] okay so he says
[2:00:02] it is paralleled in it's it's paralleled
[2:00:06] in it everywhere
[2:00:08] i know it will
[2:00:10] the message will go on
[2:00:13] now in other words how does it parallel
[2:00:15] i must decrease that's what john is
[2:00:17] saying i must decrease he must increase
[2:00:20] so john the messenger the office ends
[2:00:24] and then the message goes on
[2:00:27] what was the message
[2:00:29] the word incarnate
[2:00:31] jesus christ the messiah
[2:00:34] because who caught it followed him the
[2:00:36] message
[2:00:37] those who didn't remain here
[2:00:40] and calling themselves believers
[2:00:43] of the prophet's message
[2:00:46] but what is the message
[2:00:48] well we believe the message but what is
[2:00:49] the message
[2:00:51] now i believe the message brother
[2:00:53] what is the message system what is the
[2:00:54] message brother
[2:00:58] you will stay here or you will fall
[2:01:00] there
[2:01:02] the message will go on
[2:01:06] glory be to god so let me end there i
[2:01:09] think i i will not finish everything
[2:01:11] here
[2:01:13] but he comes here final and he says
[2:01:16] but as soon as jesus appeared he had a
[2:01:19] sign
[2:01:20] as soon as jesus appeared he had a sign
[2:01:24] a pill of fire a light above him
[2:01:27] like a dove coming down a voice saying
[2:01:30] this is my beloved son human we are
[2:01:32] pleased
[2:01:38] notice
[2:01:39] and john immediately said i must
[2:01:42] decrease he and he must increase
[2:01:46] he presented the church to christ
[2:01:51] amen
[2:01:53] and we are told that in the last days
[2:01:56] that will repeat again
[2:01:59] there is going to be a message come
[2:02:01] forth that will introduce the messiah to
[2:02:04] the people and it will be in such a way
[2:02:07] they will stand listen they will stand
[2:02:10] dumbfounded like they did it then
[2:02:13] but he promised it
[2:02:15] damn founded
[2:02:16] where is he
[2:02:20] i've believed i thought this message is
[2:02:22] the truth
[2:02:23] i believed it is the reality
[2:02:26] but you are stuck at the office
[2:02:30] go beyond
[2:02:32] the office
[2:02:34] more than
[2:02:35] the prophet
[2:02:37] there is something laying beyond there
[2:02:41] may god bless you
[2:02:43] let's stand up
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:53] well if you may be if you want to be
[2:02:55] remembered in prayer wherever you are i
[2:02:57] know
[2:02:59] this is to us all
[2:03:02] and we need christ
[2:03:03] standing
[2:03:05] in this day
[2:03:06] where there is a lot of
[2:03:08] forces that are fading trying to fail
[2:03:12] people but there is one
[2:03:14] promised guarantee
[2:03:16] that the elected
[2:03:18] will not be deceived
[2:03:21] and when you hack in his voice when you
[2:03:23] hear his voice saying
[2:03:25] come up here
[2:03:27] leave the church age
[2:03:29] touch edges come out of laodicea
[2:03:33] this is where you belong
[2:03:37] come to the reality
[2:03:39] take your position in the blood of
[2:03:41] christ
[2:03:43] don't get stuck in laodicea if you want
[2:03:46] to be remembered in prayer
[2:03:48] wherever you are just lift up your hand
[2:03:50] to the lord and we pray
[2:03:52] loving heavenly father

[2:03:59] the lord
[2:04:00] we have come
[2:04:02] as far
[2:04:03] as believing the message
[2:04:07] but you are telling us there is a
[2:04:09] mystery
[2:04:11] that goes beyond
[2:04:14] a prophetic office
[2:04:16] like john the baptist was
[2:04:18] he was more
[2:04:20] than a prophet
[2:04:22] and you could not look at so many
[2:04:24] prophecies that he made
[2:04:26] not signs not wonders
[2:04:29] but he connected all promises all
[2:04:32] prophecy to the reality and he became
[2:04:35] the greatest
[2:04:37] help us lord
[2:04:38] to recognize what you want us to be
[2:04:42] where you want us to be
[2:04:44] what you want us to become
[2:04:48] that lord we shall be those temples
[2:04:50] that the dynamics are walking in the
[2:04:53] temples
[2:04:54] that christ
[2:04:55] the zoe
[2:04:57] is tabernacled
[2:05:01] and lord that will be the end result the
[2:05:03] product
[2:05:05] of what was introduced by this prophetic
[2:05:08] office
[2:05:09] for you are coming to pick a part of
[2:05:11] yourself to take home
[2:05:13] you are not just coming to pick a
[2:05:14] message believer
[2:05:16] may you help us lord to know that god
[2:05:20] time is late
[2:05:22] and that god is time for the
[2:05:23] manifestation of the sons of god the
[2:05:26] daughters of god
[2:05:28] and that god
[2:05:30] that's the requirement of the hour
[2:05:32] may the holy spirit
[2:05:34] may the person of christ yourself come
[2:05:38] and dwell in us in our hearts by faith
[2:05:41] that it will be christ in us the hope of
[2:05:44] glory
[2:05:45] and that we shall not
[2:05:47] console ourselves by false consolation
[2:05:50] of saying i believe the message i have
[2:05:53] received the word
[2:05:55] when we are stuck at just the office
[2:05:58] may we go beyond that
[2:06:03] may we become
[2:06:05] what was pointed to us
[2:06:09] lord help us for this is a crucial time
[2:06:12] it's a crucial stage
[2:06:15] that we must go through
[2:06:17] in order to qualify for the body change
[2:06:21] for god that is what you called us for
[2:06:24] i pray lord god at your hand will be
[2:06:26] stretched out upon your children
[2:06:28] that you'll bless each and every child
[2:06:31] of yours
[2:06:32] and give them regrets
[2:06:34] for lord it's not us

[2:10:51] pointing to
[2:10:53] amen some of those
[2:10:54] some of those who came to question jesus
[2:10:57] on behalf of john

[2:11:01] day that john made that declaration
[2:11:04] they may have heard what he said but
[2:11:06] still a little confused
[2:11:08] but john and andrew weren't confused
[2:11:10] anymore

[2:11:16] revelation give me that kind of faith to
[2:11:19] believe
[2:11:20] to move out on what the prophet's
[2:11:22] pointing to not to wait and prove and
[2:11:26] wait and prove but just to move out when
[2:11:28] the prophet says let it strike my heart
[2:11:30] and say that's the truth and that's what
[2:11:32] i'm heading to
[2:11:33] that's the christ that i want to unite
