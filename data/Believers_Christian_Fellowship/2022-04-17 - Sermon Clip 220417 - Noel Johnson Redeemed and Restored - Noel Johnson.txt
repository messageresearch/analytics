TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is me or us this is him that's all god sees brother branham says god hears our voice speaking through the blood so when we net when we bow our knees or however we pray and we begin to speak unto god it's not us it's us speaking through him and that's all he sees he hears our voice speaking to him and therefore he will hear us because we are the righteousness of god himself because we are in him we are we are part of him satan will tell you oh he said why would god hear your prayers i mean look at the life that you live look at the mistakes that you make oh do you remember the mistakes from yesterday oh yeah that was bad what about last week remember that incident last week oh yeah that was terrible oh and then you think you're going to pray to god and god hear you well man i guess not you know i mean why would god hear hear me being a sinner but i'm not a sinner i'm him you are the very righteousness of god himself because you are in him what did god do with adam and eve in the garden they sinned so what did god do he went looking for them for one and they were hiding in the bushes and god says oh you made a mistake okay things are going to change but then god went out and he found two animals he slew those animals and he took the sacrifices of those animals and gave it to adam and eve whenever god looked at adam and eve what did he do all he saw was the sacrifice he was reminded constantly the price for their sins had been paid for and now i can have fellowship with them and what did god do for us he slew he he hung up on the cross for my sins and so what did he do he clothed me in that sacrifice so now what does he do whenever he looks at me he has to see the sacrifice because i am in him and because i am in him i am the very righteousness of god
