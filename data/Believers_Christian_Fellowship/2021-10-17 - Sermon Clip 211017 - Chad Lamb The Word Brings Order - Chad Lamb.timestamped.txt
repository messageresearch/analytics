[0:00] brother branham in church already says
[0:01] that's why we don't have a bunch of
[0:03] singing and a bunch of carrying on a
[0:04] bunch of testimonies he said maybe if
[0:06] you're in a special meeting and have an
[0:07] outstanding testimony somebody got saved
[0:09] or something share that but not just a
[0:10] bunch of testimonies and testimony
[0:12] meetings he said i see those things get
[0:14] out of hand and the people get so wore
[0:16] out their wore out before the word comes
[0:19] so what's brother branham doing in the
[0:20] church or is he saying don't testify
[0:22] don't sing he's saying keep the main
[0:25] thing in focus and that's the preaching
[0:27] of the word
[0:29] all the church order is about the word
[0:32] having preeminence
[0:36] that's why when brother branham preached
[0:38] church order he said this is this is to
[0:42] branham tabernacle at such and such a
[0:44] number 8th street and 10th street
[0:48] so he's saying this church order is to
[0:50] this church
[0:52] because brother branham teaches the
[0:54] sovereignty of the local church because
[0:56] you can't take brother branham's church
[0:58] order and make it fit every church
[1:01] you have to be the same kind of people
[1:04] in the same kind of location with the
[1:05] same physical structure
[1:07] i told you this with brothers in india i
[1:09] went to church one time to a church an
[1:12] official church
[1:13] a gathering of people an official church
[1:15] in malawi and they gathered every sunday
[1:18] under a mango tree
[1:22] i said how do you put a deacon at each
[1:24] door
[1:26] when you have church under a mango tree
[1:31] how do you keep the kids from running
[1:32] through the sanctuary between services
[1:36] don't run by the mango
[1:38] tree see what brother branham was
[1:41] showing when we got to watch him set his
[1:43] church in order at eighth and penn
[1:44] street he gave us an example he gave us
[1:47] a pattern he gave us something and we
[1:49] caught the purpose behind it now whether
[1:51] you have church in your home or you have
[1:52] church under a mango tree or you have
[1:54] church in a designated sanctuary you can
[1:57] take what the prophet brought and bring
[1:58] it in to accomplish the same purpose
[2:00] because your vision is higher than the
[2:03] rule
[2:06] because i've seen a whole lot of rule
[2:08] keeping that's nothing more than
[2:09] legalism and everybody feels good about
[2:11] the rule we kept all the rule but the
[2:13] dove wasn't welcome in that service
[2:16] and his feet didn't come down and rest
[2:18] so what was the point of keeping all the
[2:20] rules if the dove didn't come and the
[2:22] word didn't have preeminence
[2:25] we kept all the rules but we preached a
[2:26] false doctrine we didn't give the word
[2:28] preeminence
[2:31] so it's not about the rule it's about
[2:32] the concept it's about the principle
[2:34] about giving honor unto a prophet who
[2:36] was here to order the church to put the
[2:38] church back in order just like elijah
[2:40] put the put the worship back in order
[2:45] amen
[2:47] brother venom preaches over and over and
[2:49] over every church is sovereign
[2:51] and you cannot change that doctrine in
[2:53] the message
