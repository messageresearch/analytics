[3:43] amen let's take our bibles while we're
[3:45] standing and turn to hebrews
[3:47] chapter 11. i want to continue on with
[3:49] the thought we had on sunday sunday we
[3:52] talked about
[3:53] the worst sickness of all
[3:56] and we found out that the worst sickness
[3:57] of all is
[3:58] unbelief worse than anything that we can
[4:01] experience whether physical or mental or
[4:03] any other kind of sickness that we could
[4:04] possibly have the worst sickness of all
[4:07] is unbelief
[4:08] and if we could be free from that
[4:11] everything else is fine
[4:13] amen but today i'd like to talk about
[4:15] the cure for unbelief
[4:17] the cure for unbelief and we're going to
[4:19] go into this maybe a little bit deep if
[4:21] the lord will bless us and help us with
[4:22] that i want to thank brother john for
[4:24] taking the song service and it's nice to
[4:27] have him step in we found ourselves in
[4:28] need of a song leader and he jumped
[4:30] right in and thank god for him amen
[4:33] i also want to let you know brother tim
[4:34] and sister miami dean hart along with
[4:36] joshua dean hart made it safely to idaho
[4:38] so thank you for praying for them they
[4:40] moved they're moving there to be with
[4:42] the family and they arrived sunday
[4:44] morning and they wanted to thank you all
[4:46] for the cards and everything that you've
[4:48] said and done for them they appreciate
[4:50] that but they're there safely now and we
[4:53] thank god
[4:54] it was a it was a strange time you know
[4:57] they've been planning they had their
[4:58] house for sale for a while they've been
[4:59] planning on moving for quite a while to
[5:01] be out there with brother tim's parents
[5:03] and uh with brother david but it all
[5:05] happened right in the middle of a
[5:06] pandemic
[5:08] and we would have loved to have had a
[5:09] big send-off had a party for him and
[5:11] done all that but it just wasn't
[5:13] possible but we appreciate all of you
[5:15] who gave cards and sent cards and
[5:16] brought them in for them they appreciate
[5:18] that and hopefully they can come back
[5:20] for a visit when all this passes and we
[5:22] can have a big gathering for them but
[5:24] god bless you let's read hebrews chapter
[5:26] 11
[5:28] and verse 6.
[5:32] but without faith it is impossible to
[5:34] please him
[5:35] for he that cometh to god must believe
[5:37] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[5:40] them that diligently seek him so without
[5:42] faith it's impossible to please him
[5:46] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[5:48] heavenly father we thank you for this
[5:50] day
[5:50] we thank you for this privilege to be
[5:52] gathered together we thank you for this
[5:53] privilege lord to be able to hear your
[5:55] word
[5:56] and we ask all that you would just
[5:58] anoint the lips of clay that are
[6:00] speaking now god that it wouldn't be the
[6:02] mind of a man we've not come here to
[6:03] hear from the mind of a man we've come
[6:06] to hear from you and we know that this
[6:08] is your provided way lord and we just
[6:09] ask that you would move the man out of
[6:11] the way and that you would come and
[6:13] speak yourself that you would feed your
[6:15] hungry sheep from your own hand we just
[6:17] pray that god would lord that you would
[6:19] have preeminence and lord that you would
[6:21] be blessed and always say or do in jesus
[6:23] name we pray amen god bless you as your
[6:26] seated
[6:28] i'd like to read from the message why
[6:30] from 1961
[6:33] it says i will say today the number one
[6:35] killer
[6:37] they say that number one killer is heart
[6:39] disease i don't believe the number one
[6:41] killer is heart disease
[6:43] i believe the number one killer is sin
[6:45] disease
[6:46] that's the killer that unbelief that's
[6:48] what's killing people we got the best
[6:50] doctors we ever had the best medicine we
[6:52] ever had certainly the best hospitals
[6:54] was ever had the best medicines to
[6:56] practice with we ever had and we got
[6:59] more sickness than we ever had because
[7:01] we got more unbelief than we ever had
[7:04] that's exactly true number one killer
[7:06] isn't heart trouble it's sin trouble is
[7:08] the number one killer
[7:10] he goes on to say in the invisible union
[7:12] of the bride of christ he says what is
[7:14] sin
[7:15] sin is unbelief
[7:17] in what the word
[7:19] unbelief in god which is the word
[7:22] so when we disbelieve the word it's
[7:24] unbelief in god amen when we have
[7:26] unbelief in god amen that's the killer
[7:29] that's the number one killer that there
[7:31] is is that unbelief
[7:33] and so that's what we're fighting that's
[7:35] what we're still fighting today is
[7:37] unbelief
[7:38] we live in a civilization steeped in
[7:40] unbelief we're surrounded in unbelief
[7:42] immersed in unbelief our eyes our ears
[7:45] all of our senses pick up unbelief all
[7:47] day long but we're trying to live by a
[7:49] sick sense we're called to live by a
[7:51] sixth sense and that sense is faith that
[7:53] abides in the soul
[7:55] let's look at galatians chapter 5
[7:58] i want to
[8:00] use this as a context for what we want
[8:02] to say from here on out
[8:05] galatians chapter 5
[8:07] verse 5.
[8:10] i'm sorry
[8:11] i have to be in galatians to read from
[8:13] galatians
[8:14] not second corinthians
[8:16] galatians chapter 5
[8:18] verse 5
[8:22] for we for we through the spirit wait
[8:25] for the hope of righteousness by faith
[8:27] for in jesus christ neither circumcision
[8:29] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[8:32] faith which worketh by love
[8:35] so i want to lay that down as a
[8:36] foundation tight now we're looking for
[8:38] the cure for unbelief and we would say
[8:40] the opposite of unbelief is faith and
[8:42] that is true brother brahma said you've
[8:44] got two choices unbelief or faith amen
[8:47] so those are the two things we're
[8:48] operating by but when we look at
[8:50] galatians here it says that that neither
[8:53] circumcision availeth anything or
[8:55] uncircumcision but faith which worketh
[8:57] by love so we're going to find out that
[8:59] there's a working of faith or the thing
[9:01] that works faith is love
[9:04] so we want to go deeper than just the
[9:06] faith and we want to go what is it that
[9:08] that works faith what is it that makes
[9:10] faith operate what is it that brings
[9:12] faith to the surface and that is love
[9:14] amen you'll know that i've said many
[9:17] times that i've had an aversion to love
[9:19] preaching
[9:20] in the past not now but in the past
[9:23] because of the way it was handled it was
[9:24] always an emotional thing an emotional
[9:27] tie-in love in the in the human realm
[9:30] and human type of love which is such a
[9:32] fickle frivolous kind of love that comes
[9:34] and goes and and it's not one that can
[9:37] be trusted or dependent on and so when
[9:39] it was preached that way i always
[9:40] recoiled a bit because i never i never
[9:43] felt that way you know i never i didn't
[9:46] like it i couldn't measure up because i
[9:47] couldn't be nice all the time
[9:50] and so when i would hear that kind of
[9:51] preaching about be nice to the neighbor
[9:53] and be sweet to those who you work with
[9:55] and all of that kind of preaching when i
[9:58] would hear that i would recoil because i
[9:59] was never capable of being nice all the
[10:01] time
[10:02] i was never capable of being friendly
[10:04] all the time i was always finding myself
[10:07] falling short and the emotional kind of
[10:09] love because it goes up and it goes down
[10:12] that emotional love even for your
[10:14] children even for your spouse it ebbs
[10:16] and flows it never stays at a constant
[10:18] it's always moving and flowing because
[10:19] the emotions change
[10:22] and so that kind of preaching always
[10:23] left me feeling a little inadequate
[10:25] because it was always preached up here
[10:27] and i could never stay up here for a
[10:29] whole day
[10:31] i might hit five minutes or less and
[10:33] then it would come back down but but
[10:36] praise god this is a different kind of
[10:37] love that's not based on emotions it
[10:39] doesn't move with emotions amen it's the
[10:42] love of god god's own love
[10:45] and that's what we're looking for but
[10:47] faith which worketh by love not by our
[10:50] emotions but by that solid constant of
[10:52] god's love and god's love is a solid
[10:55] constant amen it's not movable it's not
[10:57] flexible it's not changing it's rock
[11:00] solid and dependable
[11:03] because he loved us from before the
[11:04] foundation of the world when we were yet
[11:06] in sin he loved us when we were yet
[11:08] unrighteous he loved us amen before we
[11:11] were born he loved us after we were born
[11:13] he would loved us when we were in sin he
[11:15] loved us when we repented he loved us
[11:17] it's been a constant stable steady
[11:20] unmovable unshakable love
[11:23] and if we're going to base our
[11:25] experience on anything let's base it on
[11:27] that friends not our emotion but on the
[11:29] love of god amen
[11:32] and faith worketh by that love
[11:35] not our emotional love but it worketh by
[11:38] that love let's go to first corinthians
[11:43] chapter 13.
[11:47] first corinthians chapter 13
[11:51] and verse 1
[11:54] though i speak with the tongues of men
[11:56] and of angels and have not charity i can
[11:58] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[12:00] symbol this word charity is the same
[12:02] love agapo love
[12:04] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[12:06] and understand all mysteries
[12:08] and all knowledge
[12:10] and though i have all faith
[12:12] all faith
[12:14] so that i could remove mountains and
[12:16] have not love i am nothing
[12:20] so there's something supporting faith
[12:24] there's something amen we could have all
[12:27] faith that we can move mountains but if
[12:29] we had that without the love of god then
[12:32] it would still fall short
[12:35] and we put so much emphasis on the
[12:37] things that we see
[12:39] the things that can be done that things
[12:41] that can be accomplished and the
[12:42] manifestations and there's so much
[12:44] emphasis on manifestations that when we
[12:47] see manifestations we assume that that
[12:50] that individual or that church or that
[12:53] moment has come to the pinnacle amen to
[12:55] the highest point that they can come
[12:57] with god
[12:58] right
[12:59] it's a it's an old pentecostal idea that
[13:02] transfers over but if we can see
[13:04] manifestation if we can see divine
[13:06] healing working of miracles if we can
[13:08] see something and see something on a
[13:09] consistent basis we believe that we've
[13:11] come to the highest but if we have all
[13:14] faith that we can move mountains and
[13:15] have not love we are nothing
[13:18] because if you look at the stature of a
[13:19] perfect man the foundation is faith amen
[13:22] and from faith we move our way up to the
[13:24] capstone of love
[13:27] amen
[13:29] so paul is telling us that that
[13:32] love is everything it is the capstone it
[13:34] is the love of god it is god because god
[13:37] is love
[13:38] and god is the word
[13:40] so the word is love
[13:42] and god is love
[13:44] and the word is love
[13:46] and you're part of the word
[13:48] so that means you're part of god's love
[13:52] praise be to god that's what we want to
[13:54] base our faith on
[13:56] let's turn to uh first john
[13:59] first john chapter two
[14:01] want to lay in several scriptures and
[14:03] want to get to the thought i had this
[14:05] thought sunday and i never could get to
[14:07] it and it was the main thing i wanted to
[14:08] preach
[14:11] praise the lord
[14:14] first john chapter 2 verse 15.
[14:19] first john 2 and 15 love not the world
[14:21] neither the things that are in the world
[14:24] if any man love the world the love of
[14:26] the father is not in him
[14:28] for all that is in the world the lust of
[14:30] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[14:32] pride of life is not of the father but
[14:35] is of the world
[14:37] so right here he is showing us that that
[14:40] you're not supposed to love the world or
[14:42] the things that are in the world
[14:45] but if we love that then the love of the
[14:46] father is not even in us
[14:49] and so he's naming the things that are
[14:51] in the world and it's interesting he
[14:53] doesn't go into adultery and it's not
[14:56] smoking and drinking and fornication and
[14:58] extortion and that's not the list he
[14:59] goes into he lists three things
[15:02] he says these are the things that are in
[15:04] the world the lust of the flesh the lust
[15:06] of the eyes and the pride and the pride
[15:09] of life
[15:10] and let's turn back to genesis and we're
[15:12] going to look at this because this is
[15:14] the original fall
[15:15] so what john has done is he's taken us
[15:17] right back to the temptation of eve in
[15:20] the in the garden and he's showing us
[15:23] what caused the fall
[15:26] genesis chapter 3
[15:29] and verse 6
[15:33] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[15:35] good for food
[15:37] the lust of the flesh and it was
[15:40] pleasant to the eyes the lust of the
[15:41] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[15:44] one wise the pride of life
[15:47] so john's taking us right back to the
[15:49] original fall in the garden of eden and
[15:52] he's saying this is what the love of the
[15:54] world consists of and when you realize
[15:56] what the love of the world consists of
[15:58] it's always based on self
[16:02] the the the
[16:04] it's based on the love of the flesh the
[16:07] love of the eyes and the pride of life
[16:11] and so the show down here between the
[16:14] woman and the serpent was really it was
[16:18] it was based off we would say would she
[16:20] stick with the word
[16:22] or would she move to her own desires
[16:25] and her own lust and the question is
[16:28] will she love the word which is god so
[16:31] will she love god more or will she love
[16:34] herself more and so when we really come
[16:37] down to it when we get down to the boil
[16:40] it all the way down amen the real trial
[16:43] in the garden of eden was between love
[16:45] of god and love of self
[16:48] and john picks it up and says amen if
[16:50] you love the world amen the love of
[16:53] god's not even in you and this is what
[16:55] the love of the world consists of the
[16:57] same thing that he fell behind the
[16:58] garden of eden the lust of the flesh the
[17:00] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[17:02] and the question is do you love yourself
[17:05] more than you love god
[17:07] because every time
[17:09] every time at least for me every time
[17:11] that i fail on the word of god i failed
[17:14] by my own lust and my own desires i
[17:16] wanted something for me
[17:18] i wanted i wanted a pleasure i wanted i
[17:21] wanted to be well thought of i wanted to
[17:23] have a reputation i wanted to have some
[17:26] desire or something easier
[17:30] and it was always putting self above god
[17:33] which is the word
[17:34] so you realize it's not about a
[17:36] rule-keeping
[17:38] because rule-keeping is not going to
[17:40] accomplish anything amen but the
[17:42] scriptures amen the word is god and it's
[17:46] a love for god that's greater than my
[17:49] love for myself so i will always abase
[17:52] myself under that word because i love
[17:55] the word which is god more than i love
[17:57] myself
[17:58] i mean it's the same thing i mean no
[18:00] matter what what we we what trouble we
[18:03] run into in life it's always love of
[18:04] self
[18:06] i mean if it's if it's if it's whatever
[18:09] i mean if it's stealing
[18:11] then you love yourself more than the
[18:13] person you stole from
[18:16] if it's lying you love yourself more
[18:18] than a person you lied to
[18:21] so it's the same thing we're coming down
[18:22] to the same thing so the battle we face
[18:25] is the same one that he faced in the
[18:27] garden of eden this isn't anything
[18:28] different it's the same exact thing it's
[18:30] playing out daily in our lives i mean
[18:32] the serpent's coming to try to deceive
[18:34] us amen and he's trying to use reasoning
[18:37] and love of self amen he says god
[18:40] doesn't know
[18:42] that when you eat thereof i mean your
[18:43] eyes will be open you'll become like
[18:45] gods what is he trying to do he's trying
[18:47] to give her something more
[18:49] than what seemingly god gave but the
[18:51] more always equals less
[18:54] so seemingly she was going to get
[18:56] something more than what god was holding
[18:58] back she was going to get a little
[18:59] something more by going the route of
[19:01] reasoning and self-love but what she got
[19:04] was less she lost everything she had she
[19:07] had dominion she was as a god
[19:09] co-heir co-equal to adam and she lost it
[19:12] all right
[19:14] and so this is the battle that we're
[19:15] still in it was where is our affection
[19:18] where is our love amen is it on us
[19:22] on him
[19:26] so let's go to matthew
[19:29] chapter 4. these still aren't the things
[19:30] i want to preach
[19:35] just laying the foundation for what the
[19:37] lord's laid on my heart what i would
[19:39] really like to say if god will help me
[19:43] matthew chapter four verse one
[19:50] matthew chapter 4 verse 1 then was jesus
[19:52] led up of the spirit into the wilderness
[19:54] to be tempted of the devil
[19:56] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[19:58] nights he was afterward a hunger
[20:00] and when the tempter came to him he said
[20:02] if thou be the son of god command these
[20:04] stones to be made bread
[20:06] but he answered and said it is written
[20:08] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[20:10] every word which proceedeth out of the
[20:11] mouth of god
[20:13] then the devil taketh him up on the into
[20:15] the holy city and setteth him on the
[20:17] pinnacle of the temple and saith to him
[20:19] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[20:21] down for it is written he shall give his
[20:23] angels charge concerning thee and in
[20:25] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[20:28] at any time thou dash thy foot against
[20:30] the stone
[20:31] jesus said unto him it is written again
[20:33] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[20:35] again the devil taketh him up into an
[20:37] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[20:40] the kingdoms of the world and the glory
[20:42] of them and saith unto him all these
[20:44] things will i give thee if thou will
[20:46] fall down and worship me
[20:48] then saith jesus unto him get thee hence
[20:51] satan for it is written thou shalt
[20:52] worship the lord thy god in him only
[20:55] shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth
[20:57] him and behold angels came and
[20:59] ministered unto him brother branham says
[21:02] concerning this scripture he says in the
[21:04] laodicean church age out of the church
[21:06] age book a quick look at these those
[21:08] scriptures which involve the lord jesus
[21:12] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[21:14] this proposition in matthew 4 where
[21:17] jesus is tempted of the devil he
[21:18] overcame the personal temptations of
[21:20] satan by the word and by the word only
[21:24] in each of the three major trials that
[21:25] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[21:28] of the garden of eden the lust of the
[21:30] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[21:32] of life jesus overcame by the word
[21:35] he fell
[21:37] he fell to the personal temptation of
[21:39] satan by failing to use the word adam
[21:41] fell in direct disobedience to the word
[21:44] but jesus overcame by the word and right
[21:47] now let me say this that this is the
[21:49] only way to be an overcomer also it is
[21:52] the only way that you can know if you
[21:53] are overcoming because that word can't
[21:56] fail
[21:58] because the word is greater than me
[22:01] because the word is god
[22:04] right and so the word is god so the word
[22:06] is greater than me amen and the problem
[22:09] we run into many people will take and
[22:11] make excuses for why they don't keep the
[22:13] word make excuses for why they disobey
[22:17] the word and really all that's being
[22:19] expressed is i love me more than i love
[22:22] god
[22:23] if we really come down boil it down
[22:25] really we're all friends what really is
[22:27] happening is we're saying i really love
[22:30] me more than i love god so i'll make an
[22:32] exception to god's law and the god's
[22:35] word and i'll find some reasoning amen
[22:37] and i'll find some way to manipulate a
[22:40] quote or manipulate a teaching so that i
[22:42] can work my way into doing what i want
[22:44] to do anyways
[22:47] that's why we have so many debates on so
[22:49] many issues in the message issues about
[22:52] fashion issues about marriage and
[22:53] divorce and issues all these issues
[22:56] would begin to go away quickly if we'd
[22:58] be willing to completely die to
[22:59] ourselves
[23:01] but there's so many fighting over
[23:03] marriage and divorce and over fashion
[23:04] and hair and all of these things that
[23:07] really i mean some of these things are
[23:09] petty and they're trivial but all they
[23:11] are is an opportunity to express what's
[23:12] really in the heart and so we'll look
[23:14] for a quote amen that matches exactly
[23:18] what it is we already want to do and
[23:20] that becomes our foundational quote for
[23:23] doing what we want to do
[23:24] and we have to ignore several others and
[23:27] almost it's almost like we take the
[23:29] quotes and set them my idea a different
[23:32] idea i choose to believe this and those
[23:34] i'm not going to even talk about when
[23:36] the reality is we were not ever looking
[23:40] to be fully obedient to god we were
[23:42] looking for a way to do what we wanted
[23:44] to do anyways
[23:48] and then we got to be real so we just
[23:50] got to be honest with ourselves
[23:53] i mean we're going to get to a point
[23:55] where we don't need the preacher to
[23:57] preach about it before we start
[23:58] repenting for it
[24:00] to where we realized that was selfish we
[24:03] realized that was me i was defending
[24:05] myself i was promoting myself i was
[24:08] feeding my own pleasures god forgive me
[24:11] and i we've got to get to that point as
[24:13] the bride of jesus christ to be just
[24:15] like him and not wait and come to church
[24:18] and bite our nails and sit on our heads
[24:20] and hope that that he doesn't preach on
[24:22] that that sunday or wait till he finally
[24:24] preaches on it so we repent
[24:27] but our hearts already condemning us we
[24:29] already know there's something wrong
[24:31] inside i mean we've got to get real and
[24:34] start loving god which is the word more
[24:36] than we love this flesh which is made
[24:38] out of the world
[24:40] so if you love the world
[24:42] or the things that are in the world even
[24:44] then the love of god god's not even in
[24:45] us
[24:47] so there's a real battle there's a real
[24:48] showdown that we're coming to every day
[24:51] you wake up in the morning in the middle
[24:52] of a showdown
[24:54] amen right smack dab in the middle of it
[24:56] are we going to deny ourselves and take
[24:58] the word and let the word amen be god
[25:01] amen
[25:04] praise be the praise be to god
[25:06] [Applause]
[25:07] to me
[25:09] everything is becoming
[25:11] i want it to be real that's all i can
[25:12] say
[25:14] i i'm so tired of religion i grew up in
[25:17] religion all my life was in religion
[25:19] i've seen the genuine i've seen the
[25:21] false i've seen people with a heart to
[25:22] do good i've seen people just going
[25:24] through the motions and playing the game
[25:26] i played the game myself
[25:28] and i'm i'm so tired of that we don't
[25:30] need any of that what we need is a
[25:33] reality to strike our hearts to say i'm
[25:35] willing to give up everything for him
[25:37] i'm willing to die to him i'm willing to
[25:39] surrender all to him and if it means
[25:41] that i've got to go without ever getting
[25:44] married the rest of my life if that's
[25:46] what i think he wants that's what i'm
[25:47] willing to do i'm not going to try to
[25:49] twist or manipulate something to justify
[25:52] me satisfying my own flesh
[25:54] if it means i remain single all my life
[25:56] i'll go that route if it means that i
[25:58] can never do this thing that i so enjoy
[26:00] doing i'm going to give it up because i
[26:03] want to be right and real
[26:05] i don't want to look good to my brothers
[26:07] and sisters i don't want to have to
[26:08] defend the position with a quote i want
[26:10] it to be real amen from the depth of my
[26:12] soul all the way out i want it to be the
[26:15] reality of his word in me
[26:18] i hope i trust i know that you're just
[26:21] as tired of formality and religion as i
[26:23] am
[26:24] because that's not what's going that's
[26:26] not what's going to win the day
[26:29] that's just going to propagate the same
[26:31] thing i mean that we've had for 2000
[26:33] years
[26:34] [Music]
[26:36] we don't want any more of that we want
[26:38] to be real
[26:39] if we want to be honest we got to get to
[26:41] the point where we're really honest with
[26:43] ourselves we're really honest with god
[26:46] because the fig leaves aren't working
[26:50] adam made his own religion the fig
[26:52] leaves amen and it wasn't working it
[26:55] didn't fool god and all of our religion
[26:57] and our excuses and our manipulating of
[27:00] quotes and scriptures it ain't working
[27:03] god sees right through it we may fool
[27:05] the brother next to us or the or the
[27:07] sister but we're not fooling god and it
[27:09] comes down to where we really got to
[27:11] spend enough time in prayer before god
[27:13] and make a real connection with him to
[27:15] where we we know when we're in front of
[27:17] him we're naked in his presence and
[27:20] everything is exposed
[27:23] i mean
[27:24] that everything is exposed you know that
[27:26] thing that i said the other day amen
[27:28] every word i said was true but my intent
[27:31] was to deceive you
[27:35] and we need to spend enough time in the
[27:37] presence of the lord where all of a
[27:38] sudden he puts a red hot poker right in
[27:40] that thing and you can't stand it
[27:42] anymore
[27:43] not the excuse of i said the truth i
[27:45] told the truth but you told the truth
[27:47] with the intent to deceive somebody
[27:49] that's a lie
[27:51] i don't care if every word coming out of
[27:53] your mouth was a hundred percent truth
[27:55] amen your intention was to put somebody
[27:57] in the wrong direction it wasn't the
[27:59] truth
[28:01] and i i say god expose it in us lord god
[28:04] rooted out of us until we die every day
[28:07] die die die till we get used to dying
[28:11] so he can have the greater preeminence
[28:15] brother braham says in the message balm
[28:16] and gilead
[28:18] is there no balm in gilead is there no
[28:20] physician there
[28:22] then why is my people still wade in sin
[28:25] why are they still moping around for the
[28:27] things of the world isn't there enough
[28:28] satisfaction in my gospel to take care
[28:31] of every longing that they have
[28:33] that's the question
[28:36] let's listen to the question again isn't
[28:38] there enough satisfaction in my gospel
[28:40] to take care of every longing that they
[28:42] have
[28:44] is there enough joy when they receive me
[28:47] don't i give them enough joy and love
[28:50] that i take all the love of the world
[28:52] out of them
[28:53] i said you know if you love the world or
[28:56] the things of the world the love of the
[28:57] father is not in you is there enough joy
[29:00] in serving god to take you away from the
[29:01] things of the world
[29:03] then why isn't the daughter of my people
[29:06] recovered from her sin sickness
[29:09] i mean what has god given us in this day
[29:11] we have the gospel
[29:13] the true gospel the fully restored word
[29:15] is there not enough joy in that gospel
[29:18] to take away every other joy
[29:20] to supersede and override every other
[29:23] joy or pleasure of the
[29:24] flesh praise be to god
[29:28] so
[29:29] so
[29:30] we have a
[29:31] a showdown
[29:34] and
[29:35] we know that faith worketh by love
[29:39] so unbelief
[29:41] is the worst sickness there is in the
[29:43] world the most horrible thing there is
[29:44] in the world the most deadly sickness is
[29:46] unbelief
[29:48] because
[29:49] in the beginning amen we know eve was
[29:51] deceived but she was deceived into
[29:53] leaving the word
[29:55] she was deceived into leaving the word
[29:57] for her own pleasures
[30:00] and unbelief entered in
[30:02] if she would have believed the word
[30:03] correctly she would have never been
[30:04] deceived
[30:06] she would have stayed with the word if
[30:08] she would have just stayed with the word
[30:09] with no understanding
[30:11] there would have been no problem
[30:14] if if he would have said that you know
[30:16] did god say surely not he does know that
[30:18] you'll be his gods and and she would say
[30:21] if she would have looked at him and says
[30:22] i have no idea what you're talking about
[30:26] you sound really smart mr serpent
[30:29] and you've already proved to me you know
[30:30] a lot of stuff and you're you may be
[30:32] right
[30:34] i mean she could have just talked like
[30:36] this you may be correct that might be
[30:38] right i don't know all i know
[30:41] is adam told me he said this and so i'm
[30:44] just going to say that
[30:46] if she would have just done that amen
[30:49] she wouldn't have had to prove anything
[30:50] defend anything outsmart anybody all she
[30:54] would have had to do was say what he
[30:56] said and the devil would have left her
[31:00] because that's what happened when jesus
[31:01] was tempted in the same way with the
[31:03] same three temptations amen when he
[31:05] resisted by the word each time amen the
[31:08] devil departed
[31:11] so if she could have just stayed with
[31:13] the word the problem with the real issue
[31:18] the real issue
[31:20] was what the serpent was saying sounded
[31:23] nice
[31:26] that was the real issue
[31:28] and it was appealing to a part of her
[31:32] there was an appealing part to what he
[31:34] was saying and it was appealing to her
[31:37] her flash and it was appealing to her
[31:39] understanding amen and and in that
[31:42] appealing she
[31:44] she i would i would say it this way
[31:46] based off my own temptation and my own
[31:48] failures not speaking for eve but based
[31:50] off me
[31:52] she wanted what he was saying to be the
[31:54] truth
[31:58] so it was easy for her to leave the word
[32:01] and take this reasoning because she
[32:04] wanted what he was saying to be the
[32:06] truth
[32:07] because the word was seemingly limiting
[32:10] her
[32:13] seemingly to the human reasoning she was
[32:16] being limited or held back amen uh uh
[32:19] she couldn't have full expression of her
[32:21] desire she couldn't have full expression
[32:24] of all her wants amen with the word so
[32:26] it's seemingly the word was holding her
[32:28] back
[32:29] amen not realizing it was the word that
[32:32] was preserving her for the greatest
[32:33] manifestation but it seemingly was
[32:36] holding her back and what the serpent
[32:38] was saying
[32:39] looked like he was giving a correct
[32:41] interpretation to the word although he
[32:43] was slightly modifying what she had
[32:45] heard before
[32:48] but she was taking it because
[32:51] she wanted that to be the truth
[32:57] oh pray god i love it when the word
[32:59] exposes me
[33:01] exposes the fallacy and the humanity and
[33:03] and the foolishness of a human mind and
[33:06] human desires
[33:07] it's exposing and i like to be exposed
[33:10] i said god give me give me that portion
[33:13] i need give me that thing amen let your
[33:16] love become more of a reality to me
[33:17] because faith worketh by love amen and
[33:19] if your love for me can become more of a
[33:21] reality in me then that faith can go to
[33:24] work amen and push away all the unbelief
[33:26] out of my life
[33:30] praise god
[33:31] let's go back to numbers we read this
[33:34] sunday but i'd like to read it again
[33:37] numbers
[33:38] uh 14
[33:43] numbers 14 and verse 1.
[33:46] we at cadiz barnea
[33:49] we went through this sunday where
[33:51] the spies had went over come back 10
[33:53] bring an evil report
[33:55] 10 bring an evil report by telling the
[33:58] truth
[34:00] well no they didn't tell the truth
[34:03] how do we say this
[34:04] they gave correct facts
[34:09] you couldn't argue with their facts
[34:12] if they would have had the right
[34:14] equipment they would have video and
[34:16] pictures to prove what they were saying
[34:19] they would had video and pictures they'd
[34:21] could have put together a scientific
[34:23] documentary
[34:24] they could have taken measurements with
[34:26] a laser measuring device they could have
[34:28] vindicated and proven all the facts that
[34:30] they were giving but the way they put
[34:33] the facts together was telling a lie
[34:36] because they were saying something
[34:38] different than what the word said and
[34:40] because it was different than what the
[34:42] word said it was a lie
[34:44] even though the facts were true
[34:47] [Music]
[34:48] that's why we have to be careful with
[34:50] facts
[34:51] especially scientific facts
[34:54] hey i was scrolling through the news
[34:56] today and i just flipped through to see
[34:58] what the articles were and i read an
[35:00] article that absolutely intrigued me
[35:02] today
[35:04] nasa is planning on shooting a laser to
[35:06] the moon to look for water
[35:09] have we heard that before
[35:11] brother branham said in the antelubivian
[35:12] today in noah they shot the moon with
[35:15] the laser and they said there's no water
[35:17] up there
[35:18] it was like a quote out of the message
[35:21] on the headlines nasa is going to shoot
[35:23] the moon with the laser to look for
[35:24] water on the surface of the moon hey too
[35:27] late in noah's day they already shot the
[35:29] moon with the laser
[35:31] nasa is way behind
[35:35] praise be to god
[35:37] and they told noah there's no water up
[35:39] there and noah said i don't know if it's
[35:40] up there down there where it's at he
[35:42] just said it's going to rain
[35:45] praise god
[35:46] noah didn't have any scientific
[35:48] information and he didn't have any and
[35:50] he didn't have any articles to prove
[35:52] that what he's saying was true he
[35:53] couldn't back it up with any facts or
[35:55] any science but the science was contrary
[35:57] to what god had told him so he rejected
[35:59] science and stayed with what god told
[36:01] him
[36:03] and now you know
[36:05] 5 000 years 4 000 years however many
[36:08] thousand years later they're still
[36:10] trying to shoot the moon and look for
[36:11] water
[36:12] man these guys are slow
[36:15] praise be to god
[36:18] but we go here
[36:20] they give the facts here at katy's
[36:21] barnea
[36:23] but the same set of facts
[36:26] brought two different responses in two
[36:29] groups of people
[36:30] same facts
[36:32] you realize it wasn't that that
[36:35] it wasn't that caleb and joshua went to
[36:39] a different part of the promised land
[36:41] and saw short people in villages with no
[36:43] walls
[36:45] it's like they saw you know all the
[36:47] pygmies
[36:49] and they're like oh we can do this
[36:52] no you realize they saw the same thing
[36:54] they saw the giants they saw the walled
[36:56] cities they saw the same thing they had
[36:58] the same facts amen but one one group
[37:02] joshua and caleb had faith in the
[37:04] promise because there was something in
[37:06] their heart to activate their faith the
[37:08] other ones were missing a key ingredient
[37:14] let's look here
[37:16] verse one we'll read this again chapter
[37:18] 14 verse one and all the congregation
[37:20] lifted up their voice and cried and the
[37:22] people went that night and all the
[37:24] children of israel murmured against
[37:25] moses and against aaron and the whole
[37:27] congregation said unto them would god
[37:30] that we had died in the land of egypt or
[37:31] would god we had died in the wilderness
[37:34] and wherefore hath the lord brought us
[37:36] unto this land to fall by the sword that
[37:38] our wives and our children should be a
[37:40] prey were it not better for us to return
[37:42] into egypt
[37:43] and they said one to another let us make
[37:45] a captain and let us return unto egypt
[37:48] man that's how good wisdom is
[37:53] that's why wisdom and man always takes
[37:55] him right back to the mother
[37:58] right back to egypt
[38:00] we'll run away get away a move of god
[38:03] brings us out amen and brother branham
[38:06] said every daughter from the church
[38:07] started off a virgin she's born every
[38:10] little girl is born a virgin and she's
[38:11] born from a she's born a virgin
[38:14] but when she matured and grew up amen
[38:17] because she didn't want to move on into
[38:19] the promised land because there was
[38:20] giants and walled cities and it would
[38:22] create hardship
[38:25] keeping the word is not easy on the
[38:27] flesh
[38:30] because of that they would always turn
[38:32] back to the mother and become a
[38:34] harlot
[38:35] and so the wisdom of man has always gone
[38:37] back to egypt from this time all the way
[38:40] through the wisdom of man has always
[38:42] gone back to egypt
[38:44] that's the best that man can do
[38:46] go back to bondage
[38:48] number four verse four and they said one
[38:50] to another let us make a captain and let
[38:51] us return into egypt then moses and
[38:53] aaron fell on their faces before all the
[38:55] assembly of the congregation of the
[38:56] children of israel and joshua the son of
[38:59] nun and caleb the son of jephena which
[39:01] were of them that searched the land rent
[39:03] their clothes and they spake unto all
[39:05] the company the children of israel
[39:06] saying the land which we pass through to
[39:08] search it is an exceeding good land if
[39:11] the lord delighted us then he will bring
[39:14] us into this land and give it to us a
[39:16] land which floweth with milk and honey
[39:19] only rebel not ye against the lord
[39:21] neither fear ye the people of the land
[39:22] for they are bred for us their defenses
[39:24] is departed from them and the lord is
[39:26] with us fear them not
[39:29] oh i love that response one of them says
[39:32] it's terrible it will never make it for
[39:35] grasshoppers in their sight and the
[39:36] other one says they're bred for us
[39:39] why because at the top of verse
[39:43] 8
[39:44] if the lord delight in us
[39:47] then he will bring us into this land
[39:49] you know what joshua and caleb had they
[39:51] had a correct revelation of their
[39:53] position in god
[39:56] they recognize that god loves us he
[40:00] delights in us he takes pleasure in us
[40:03] look at what he's done amen he kept his
[40:05] word for 440 years he told abraham we're
[40:09] abraham's descendants he promised he
[40:12] kept his promise
[40:14] after 400 and some years he kept his
[40:16] promise he brought us out with a mighty
[40:18] hand he's fed us along the way he's
[40:20] protected us he's watered us he's given
[40:22] us everything can't you see the love of
[40:25] god
[40:27] and they couldn't see the love of god
[40:29] all they could see was a god who hated
[40:31] them and they wished they had already
[40:33] died
[40:34] because god was asking them to do
[40:37] something beyond their reasoning
[40:39] something their flesh did not want to do
[40:41] something that was a challenge to
[40:43] everything in their mind and everything
[40:45] in their psyche was being challenged by
[40:47] the word
[40:48] and when they met the challenge all of a
[40:50] sudden they didn't see a god who loved
[40:52] them they saw a god who hated them they
[40:54] saw a god who brought them for them to
[40:56] fall by the sword for their wives to be
[40:58] slain for their children to be taken
[41:02] my you know that sounds horrible but
[41:04] what happens when we get into a really
[41:06] tight spot into a dark place and then
[41:09] all of a sudden our health is gone our
[41:10] mind all of a sudden the devil comes
[41:12] with the same thoughts
[41:16] comes in your mind with the same
[41:18] thoughts amen and you start to have to
[41:21] fight those doubts of whether or not god
[41:23] loves you and sees you and knows where
[41:24] you're at and whether or not he's left
[41:26] you to your own whether or not you
[41:27] really are a child of god or he really
[41:29] delights in you
[41:32] amen and you've got to fight through
[41:34] that thing
[41:35] because what is it that's the serpent
[41:37] whispering in your ear
[41:40] trying to get you to look at the
[41:41] preservation of the flesh
[41:44] and we were never to preserve the flesh
[41:46] we were always to let it die
[41:48] let it die
[41:49] let it go naked
[41:51] i mean job but he lost everything he
[41:53] said naked came out into this world and
[41:54] naked shall i leave it amen blessed be
[41:57] the name of the lord
[41:58] the lord giveth the lord taketh away
[42:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[42:02] oh god help me get to that place this is
[42:05] the desire of my life friends to get to
[42:07] this place where if he takes it all away
[42:09] i say god bless you lord i still love
[42:11] you and i know you still love me
[42:15] but when we get to the same place they
[42:17] got here we have to fight the same kind
[42:20] of devils they had to fight
[42:23] why is this happening
[42:25] you've sinned away your day of grace
[42:27] god's left you you're on your own
[42:30] all the same same devils
[42:34] you got to fight through them and say no
[42:36] the lord delights in us
[42:39] and it's got to go past that until you
[42:41] can get to the place by revelation you
[42:42] say the lord delights in me
[42:45] he's called me he's pulled me out he's
[42:48] revealed his word to me he's preserved
[42:50] me so many times i know by a revelation
[42:53] that's down in my soul that i am his and
[42:55] he is mine and he delights in me and no
[42:58] matter what happens on the surface is
[43:00] not going to change the love that is in
[43:02] my heart because he first loved me we
[43:04] love him because he first loved us
[43:10] and with that kind of understanding
[43:12] joshua and caleb had a totally different
[43:14] response to the same set of facts
[43:18] i said i want to be a joshua and the
[43:20] caleb
[43:22] not the other spies
[43:25] so
[43:27] faith
[43:28] workers by love
[43:31] what was working joshua and caleb's
[43:33] faith
[43:34] their understanding of god's love
[43:37] he delights in us
[43:42] they didn't say joshua and caleb wasn't
[43:44] saying we're stronger
[43:47] we're better
[43:49] that's not what he was saying
[43:51] he doesn't say we have better armament
[43:52] because they had none
[43:55] you know you realize he was all he said
[43:59] if he delights and thus he'll give us
[44:00] the land
[44:02] it's all him
[44:04] i mean he said it
[44:06] didn't he do all that i mean didn't are
[44:08] we here
[44:11] i mean where were we a couple months ago
[44:13] guys
[44:17] i mean where were we
[44:19] did you forget
[44:21] i mean you say he loved you at the red
[44:23] sea but he doesn't love you now
[44:26] he loved you at the smitten rock but now
[44:28] god's fickle with his love like he loves
[44:30] one minute and doesn't love the next
[44:33] like he used to love me
[44:37] god's eternal he's never changing he's
[44:39] constant i mean how could we say god
[44:41] used to love me or back when god loved
[44:43] me when god used to love me
[44:45] [Music]
[44:47] he ported the red sea because he
[44:49] delighted in us
[44:51] he fed us manna cause he delighted in us
[44:53] he gave us water from the rock because
[44:54] he delighted in us he gave us his word
[44:56] because he delighted in us he led us
[44:58] with a pillar of fire because he
[44:59] delighted us and if he ever delighted in
[45:01] me he's always going to delight in me if
[45:04] he's ever loved me he'll always love me
[45:08] when things go completely wrong it
[45:11] doesn't change god's love for me because
[45:13] it's a constant friend it's more
[45:15] constant than the earth you're standing
[45:17] on it's more constant than anything
[45:18] you've ever seen with your eyeballs the
[45:20] love of god is more constant than that
[45:23] it's more constant than a government
[45:24] it's more constant than anything that
[45:26] you've ever seen or known the love of
[45:28] god is constant steady and sure and it's
[45:31] strong and it's powerful and it's not
[45:33] based on emotions
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:37] [Music]
[45:38] praise god it was the love of god that
[45:40] kept jesus christ nailed to a cross when
[45:42] he could have delivered himself
[45:45] love is not it's not pink flowers and
[45:47] red roses
[45:49] it's not bows and pretty cards that's
[45:51] not love that's emotion
[45:55] amen
[45:56] to human love human emotion that gives
[45:59] you twitter painted and butterflies in
[46:00] your stomach and all of those things
[46:02] that's not this kind of love this is the
[46:04] kind of love that though he was being
[46:06] absolutely tortured and abused amen he
[46:09] could have delivered himself amen if he
[46:11] would have twitched his finger brother
[46:12] branham said there was legions of angels
[46:15] all around hanging in every tree on
[46:17] every limb and if he would have twitched
[46:18] his finger they would have delivered him
[46:21] but what held him amen through the
[46:23] brutal punishment and the torture and
[46:25] the abuse and the mocking and the
[46:26] scourging and hanging it was his love
[46:28] for you and me his delight in us that
[46:31] held him there that's a strong burley
[46:33] amen his faith is burly and has hairs on
[46:36] his chest and muscles what is love god
[46:37] because faith work is by love
[46:40] [Laughter]
[46:40] [Applause]
[46:42] that's the kind of love even men like
[46:48] praise be to god
[46:49] it's constant steady sure and strong
[46:56] amen
[46:57] if he loved you enough where were we six
[46:59] years ago friends
[47:02] what kind of garbage were we rolling
[47:04] around in
[47:06] what did he deliver us from
[47:10] did he love us then and not now
[47:14] he loved us enough to pull us out of
[47:15] reasoning and denominational
[47:17] understanding
[47:20] but now all of a sudden his love never
[47:22] changes
[47:24] how did we get here
[47:25] don't forget where we were
[47:27] don't forget where you personally were
[47:30] where has god brought you from in your
[47:31] lifetime
[47:33] where has he brought you from in the
[47:34] last couple of years
[47:38] amen
[47:40] he says
[47:42] in the stature of a perfect man 1962
[47:46] now in building the virtue
[47:48] building this monument building this
[47:50] statue see it starts off with the
[47:52] foundation stone faith virtue knowledge
[47:54] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[47:56] kindness now what does it do then
[47:59] they're waiting for the headstone which
[48:00] is love for god is love and he controls
[48:03] and he is the strength of every one of
[48:05] these things
[48:07] god is love and he's the strength of
[48:10] what
[48:11] faith temperance virtue
[48:14] it's love it's it's love faith work is
[48:18] by
[48:19] love
[48:21] love is the strength of every one of
[48:23] these virtues and it's the capping off
[48:25] it's the ceiling together it's the
[48:27] molding it together it's all operated by
[48:30] faith and it's all sealed by faith and
[48:32] it's by love and it's all capped off by
[48:34] love
[48:35] so love is the working of these things
[48:37] it's the strength of every one of these
[48:39] things that's right yes sir right in
[48:41] here right in here you see i got in
[48:43] between all these works in here and here
[48:46] this little
[48:47] little waves come what is it the holy
[48:49] ghost coming down through christ see the
[48:50] holy spirit the holy spirit is above all
[48:53] this welding this together building a
[48:56] what a perfect church for the capstone
[48:58] to cap it off
[49:00] what's been building it love it
[49:03] what's the strength of it all love
[49:06] what does faith operate by
[49:08] love
[49:09] what does temperance operate by love
[49:11] what does virtue operate by love it's a
[49:14] revelation of who we are in christ jesus
[49:21] he says in the message desperation 1963
[49:24] now the word plainly states if you want
[49:26] to put this down in galatians 5 6 that
[49:28] faith worketh by love see faith worketh
[49:31] by love and the only way that you can
[49:32] have faith is have love first
[49:38] because after all faith is love's
[49:40] incentive
[49:42] incentive that's exactly what faith is
[49:44] it's an incentive to love now if you
[49:46] don't have love you can't have faith
[49:52] further in desperation says we must have
[49:54] love before we can have faith
[49:56] when we have genuine love what does it
[49:58] do it pushes our faith out on the
[50:01] battlefront for god see genuine godly
[50:03] love for god and for his word and for
[50:05] his people will push faith out there
[50:07] love just takes a hold of faith and just
[50:10] come on let's go and out it goes because
[50:12] that's what love does
[50:14] john 14 23 jesus said if a man loves me
[50:18] he'll keep my words now you can't keep
[50:20] his words without having faith in what
[50:22] he said so you see if
[50:24] so so you see if he loves god then he
[50:27] keeps god's word if he said i am the
[50:29] lord that healeth thee he believes that
[50:32] love makes him believe it
[50:36] love makes him believe it because love
[50:38] dominates all
[50:40] though i speak with the tongue of men
[50:42] and angels and have not love it is
[50:43] nothing though i have faith to move
[50:45] mountains and have not love it is
[50:46] nothing love dominates all because god
[50:48] is love a god of love now yes sir if
[50:51] jesus said if a man loves me he will
[50:53] keep my words
[50:55] why because a lot you have to have love
[50:57] before you can have faith
[51:00] so there's so much expressions of faith
[51:04] but that may not be a love expressed
[51:06] faith
[51:09] oh i hope i can
[51:11] i just hope
[51:12] it can come from here out god help us
[51:16] because there's a human faith
[51:18] brother bam talked about a faith where
[51:20] people could get healed in a beatles con
[51:22] a concert
[51:24] brother bam talked about a faith that
[51:26] could make the chandelier go this way
[51:28] and that way and he said now that's just
[51:29] human faith
[51:31] that's just my faith
[51:33] we understand that
[51:35] so
[51:36] that's why we have to be careful seeing
[51:38] dynamic things happen
[51:40] right
[51:41] can be very deceptive
[51:45] it's got to be faith that workers by
[51:47] love
[51:49] and so we can see a human faith do
[51:52] tremendous things
[51:55] but we can't be deceived by that it may
[51:57] be genuine it may not be genuine i don't
[52:00] know but for me
[52:01] i have to my faith has to be based on
[52:04] love
[52:06] and we love him because
[52:09] he first loved us
[52:11] that means before that i can have the
[52:13] right kind of faith i have to know he
[52:16] first loved me that means i have to know
[52:19] where i was before
[52:22] i have to have a revelation of where i
[52:23] come from
[52:25] i have to have a revelation of who i am
[52:27] to have this right kind of faith i have
[52:29] to know where i came from i have to know
[52:30] who i really am i have to know i have to
[52:33] know why god loves me
[52:35] why does god have this unmovable
[52:37] unshakable love for me amen if it's not
[52:39] based on my conduct amen it was here
[52:41] before that i came into my earthly
[52:43] existence amen i didn't do anything to
[52:45] earn it amen i have to understand this
[52:47] kind of love it's different than any
[52:49] other kind of love i've ever experienced
[52:51] in this earthly journey and so the only
[52:53] way to understand this love is to go
[52:55] back to the origin of the love and then
[52:58] when you find that origin i find myself
[53:00] in that love in the origin
[53:03] i was loved there i am love there
[53:09] do you understand it's not that just i'm
[53:11] loved i am love because that's the word
[53:15] and i'm there and that makes me part of
[53:17] the word part of love i am love there i
[53:20] am the word there
[53:22] [Applause]
[53:26] i'll say it this way i am god there
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:32] i'm not talking about this but i'm
[53:34] talking about the sea gene of god on the
[53:35] inside was with god before the
[53:37] foundation of the world and when it was
[53:39] there you would look at it and say
[53:40] that's god you wouldn't say that's god's
[53:43] pieces you would just say that's god
[53:45] and one of those pieces he designated to
[53:47] come down amen and come forth in this
[53:49] body of flesh amen and so what is it
[53:52] that's where his love for me originates
[53:55] from there's a connection that
[53:57] transcends time that transcends distance
[53:59] that transcends actions that transcends
[54:02] everything else and that revelation is
[54:05] what will work true faith
[54:08] because if i was there
[54:12] and he brought me here
[54:15] is he going to lose me
[54:17] is he going to forget about me
[54:20] am i going to act so bad
[54:22] that he'll decide not to love me anymore
[54:25] you realize what the message came to do
[54:27] the message came to take every scare
[54:30] away from god's people so that they
[54:31] could actually move in the true genuine
[54:34] faith of god because they could never
[54:35] fully move into faith because there was
[54:37] always that scare that uncertainty that
[54:40] unknowing amen but he came and opened
[54:42] the seals so you could hear your name
[54:44] called so that you would know that your
[54:45] name is written on the lamb's book of
[54:47] life which means it was written before
[54:48] the foundation of the world which means
[54:50] when god was there alone with his
[54:52] attributes i was there amen and he loved
[54:54] me then and i was part of his love then
[54:56] and i'm part of his love now
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:00] and with that revelation what part of
[55:03] the word word won't work amen what's the
[55:05] problem
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:08] there is no problem
[55:11] i mean it looks like a problem but it's
[55:12] really not a problem
[55:14] with these eyes and this mind and this
[55:16] ears and this body and all the the fears
[55:19] and anxieties and worries and all these
[55:21] things that go on in us it looks like a
[55:23] big problem but if we could just go back
[55:26] to the foundation back before the
[55:28] foundation back when we were in him and
[55:30] look from that vantage point at what
[55:32] we're having we would say this is no
[55:33] problem
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:37] praise god praise be to god
[55:39] that's why faith work is by love because
[55:42] your love we love him because he first
[55:44] loved us and that's the only way we can
[55:46] have the right kind of love not
[55:48] emotional amen not up and down it's a
[55:51] love that's constant and solid it is the
[55:53] very love of god
[55:55] that is alive in our hearts
[55:59] amen praise be to god
[56:06] praise god
[56:08] let's go to first john chapter 4.
[56:17] now you see how vital the message was
[56:22] what else
[56:24] has ever been preached
[56:26] besides the ministry of jesus christ the
[56:28] apostle paul that told us these things
[56:32] where else are you going to get an
[56:34] understanding of where we came from and
[56:35] god's love for us
[56:37] where else will we know where else can
[56:40] you catch the revelation of where we
[56:42] come from and where we're going how else
[56:44] can we have the right kind of love that
[56:46] work as faith amen if we can't have that
[56:48] right kind of love that worketh faith
[56:49] then we cannot ever have the right
[56:51] working of faith
[56:54] or temperance
[56:56] or virtue or knowledge or brotherly
[56:58] kindness you realize without the
[57:00] revelation amen that the message the
[57:03] understanding that the message is given
[57:05] to the children of god we can never have
[57:07] the right operation of all of these
[57:09] virtues
[57:11] because they all the strength of all of
[57:12] these is love
[57:14] amen and we love him because he first
[57:16] loved us we have to have a revelation
[57:18] and and when he opened the seals he tore
[57:20] loose all the misunderstanding all the
[57:23] misconceptions and denomination and
[57:25] showed us who we really are
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:28] so that there can be a full expression
[57:30] of the stature of a perfect man
[57:32] couldn't be till now
[57:36] amen just to take the scare away
[57:40] so
[57:41] this message isn't optional
[57:44] this message didn't come to just add a
[57:47] little more understanding
[57:49] this message actually came
[57:53] so that there can be a manifestation of
[57:55] the life of jesus christ the stature of
[57:57] a perfect man
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] and without this message is never going
[58:01] to happen
[58:06] first john chapter 4
[58:12] verse 15
[58:17] whosoever shall confess that jesus is
[58:19] the son of god god dwelleth in him
[58:22] and he in god
[58:25] that's a pretty safe place
[58:28] now
[58:34] i don't think that's temporary
[58:37] or changes
[58:39] all the time
[58:42] whosoever shall confess that jesus the
[58:44] son of god god dwelleth in him and he
[58:46] and god
[58:47] and we have known and believed the love
[58:49] that god hath to us god is love
[58:52] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[58:54] god
[58:55] i'm sorry and he that dwelleth in love
[58:58] dwelleth in god and god in him
[59:02] herein is our love made perfect that we
[59:04] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[59:06] because as he is so are we in this world
[59:11] there is no fear in love but perfect
[59:13] love cast out fear because fear hath
[59:16] torment he that feareth is not made
[59:18] perfect in love we love him because he
[59:22] first loved us
[59:24] now you get the picture
[59:26] now you see what john's talking about
[59:28] amen john amen brother brahma said john
[59:31] amen he went on the isle of patmos and
[59:33] he got the revelation of jesus christ
[59:37] he saw the opening of the seals he heard
[59:39] the thunders amen he got the revelation
[59:41] he saw amen from the church ages all the
[59:44] way to the new heavens and new earth
[59:47] and he come back brother bam said he
[59:48] come back saying little children love
[59:50] one another
[59:51] he come back the apostle of love why
[59:53] because once you've seen that once you
[59:56] see what the reality is once you see
[59:58] god's already determined it it's already
[1:00:00] preset the names are already in the book
[1:00:02] he already knows who's going to be there
[1:00:03] he already knows what it's going to look
[1:00:04] like how many houses are there he
[1:00:06] already knows it all once you see that
[1:00:08] and you see that your position is secure
[1:00:10] then he can come back and say just love
[1:00:12] everybody everything's gonna work out
[1:00:14] just fine the one who hates you the one
[1:00:16] who likes you the one who's in between
[1:00:17] don't worry about it just love everybody
[1:00:20] love one another love your neighbor love
[1:00:23] everybody because the destination is
[1:00:25] already secure by revelation you've got
[1:00:28] a place by revelation you're there and
[1:00:30] if you're there who cares what's
[1:00:32] happening here because i'm there i've
[1:00:34] already made it i'm already in glory
[1:00:37] i'm already seated in heavenly places in
[1:00:40] christ jesus so if somebody spits on me
[1:00:42] who cares i've got a place reserved in a
[1:00:44] new heavens and new earth i'm already
[1:00:46] there
[1:00:47] if i lose everything i've already got
[1:00:49] everything
[1:00:50] i'm not going to lose anything there
[1:00:54] that's why with that kind of revelation
[1:00:57] the revelation the bride is supposed to
[1:00:58] be receiving now
[1:01:00] with that revelation he comes back and
[1:01:01] says love everybody
[1:01:03] love one another
[1:01:05] just love
[1:01:07] love love love love love
[1:01:09] it's not because he became a doting old
[1:01:11] man
[1:01:13] it's because he saw it's a finished work
[1:01:18] remember
[1:01:19] john saw 24 elders seated on the throne
[1:01:24] he saw he didn't see 23 he saw 24 and
[1:01:28] those elders are the apostles
[1:01:30] and the patriarchs meaning john was one
[1:01:33] of those seated on the throne
[1:01:35] so brother baptist said my brother said
[1:01:37] he looked to pass the current time and
[1:01:39] john saw john he said there's john
[1:01:42] amen so now he comes back to earth and
[1:01:44] he's like i got no problem
[1:01:46] what's the problem cut my head off no
[1:01:49] problem take all my money no problem put
[1:01:50] me in prison no problem hate my guts no
[1:01:53] problem are you not going to give me to
[1:01:55] hate you back because i've already i
[1:01:57] john saw john i'm already seated over
[1:01:59] there i know i'm already seated in
[1:02:01] heavenly places in christ jesus right
[1:02:03] now
[1:02:05] see if we could just catch the right
[1:02:06] revelation the love of god is so secure
[1:02:09] that before the foundation of the world
[1:02:11] he already saw you there if you can see
[1:02:13] yourself from before the foundation of
[1:02:15] the world to firmly plant it there then
[1:02:17] all the sudden faith worketh by that
[1:02:20] kind of love everything is secure
[1:02:22] everything is stable it's not shifting
[1:02:24] it's not moving it's all okay
[1:02:28] this life is a vapor it's a myth it's a
[1:02:31] few days and full of trouble
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:34] it's the it's the shortest part of our
[1:02:37] of our journey
[1:02:40] right this earthly journey is the
[1:02:42] shortest part of our journey
[1:02:45] and so it's a blip on the radar friends
[1:02:48] it's a moment it's a hickey
[1:02:50] in the circle of eternity
[1:02:52] and we're getting all bent out of shade
[1:02:54] about the hickey
[1:02:56] when we're on the circle
[1:02:58] going round and round and round and
[1:03:00] eternity i'm already there
[1:03:03] my position is secure i'm already seated
[1:03:06] there i've already arrived i've already
[1:03:08] made it
[1:03:10] so let's not get bent out of shape about
[1:03:12] the hickey
[1:03:13] if there's giants he's going to have to
[1:03:15] take care of him because he already
[1:03:16] predetermined what i'm going to do in
[1:03:17] this life i don't know how he's going to
[1:03:18] do it but he still loves me
[1:03:21] your house burnt down he still loves me
[1:03:25] i mean i might cry because there's some
[1:03:26] things i like
[1:03:28] but i won't need none of those things
[1:03:30] over there
[1:03:33] you realize
[1:03:34] love is the basis for everything
[1:03:38] and if we could have that kind of love
[1:03:40] if we could recognize his love for us
[1:03:43] the security
[1:03:45] of the believer
[1:03:47] then all of a sudden our blood pressure
[1:03:49] would go back to normal
[1:03:52] we wouldn't need the pills
[1:03:54] to get through the night
[1:03:57] you realize
[1:03:58] we we we do this to ourselves because we
[1:04:02] forget who we are
[1:04:06] brother bravo says in the message
[1:04:07] spiritual amnesia from 1964
[1:04:11] now in this amnesia we're told
[1:04:13] cause you to be a place where you cannot
[1:04:15] identify yourself
[1:04:18] oh my we came into this world with
[1:04:21] spiritual amnesia
[1:04:23] but when we come in contact with the
[1:04:24] word for our age what did it do it took
[1:04:26] away the spiritual amnesia so that we
[1:04:28] could identify ourselves
[1:04:30] that's why brother branham comes to the
[1:04:32] end of his ministry he said i'm so happy
[1:04:34] when i realized i was not the son of
[1:04:35] charles and elle branham
[1:04:37] why because he could properly identify
[1:04:40] himself now his identity wasn't with the
[1:04:43] flesh his identity was not with the
[1:04:45] natural his identity was found in god
[1:04:49] which is the word
[1:04:53] he says now they cannot you cannot
[1:04:54] identify yourself
[1:04:56] now it's it's an unusual thing it don't
[1:04:58] happen too often but the causes is from
[1:05:01] shock
[1:05:02] somebody that don't even know who they
[1:05:04] are you find it from war sometimes
[1:05:06] soldiers get it sometimes people get it
[1:05:08] another thing causes it is worry
[1:05:12] oh bring it home
[1:05:14] right now
[1:05:15] amen i wasn't in war i didn't get a
[1:05:17] shock
[1:05:19] another thing that causes amnesia
[1:05:22] is worry
[1:05:28] worry will cause it
[1:05:30] worry has no virtue to it at all
[1:05:35] yeah just skip worry and accept faith
[1:05:39] that sounds easy i mean
[1:05:40] tell that to somebody who's got anxiety
[1:05:42] say just skip worry and accept faith
[1:05:44] they're like tell me how as they ring
[1:05:46] the skin off of their hands
[1:05:50] the only way
[1:05:52] is to go back to revelation of who you
[1:05:54] really are
[1:05:58] anxiety is a real problem worry is a
[1:06:01] real problem different temperaments with
[1:06:03] different genetic makeup struggle with
[1:06:04] different things and some may really
[1:06:06] struggle with worry but the cure for
[1:06:08] worry is revelation
[1:06:11] it's not pills it's not a vacation it's
[1:06:13] not a nap the cure is revelation
[1:06:16] because you can take a pill and feel
[1:06:18] better but it's going to come back you
[1:06:19] can take a nap but the next time you're
[1:06:21] tired it's going to come back i mean you
[1:06:23] realize those are just cycles that we
[1:06:25] fall into but the only thing that will
[1:06:27] break the cycle amen is a revelation of
[1:06:29] who we are we've got to go back to the
[1:06:31] fundamentals where did i come from
[1:06:36] why am i here
[1:06:38] where am i going
[1:06:39] and does he delight in me
[1:06:42] and if we can answer those questions
[1:06:44] that's the thing to fight worry and
[1:06:46] anxiety with
[1:06:49] worry has no virtue to it at all yeah
[1:06:50] just skip worry and accept faith
[1:06:53] someone said well now what if you're
[1:06:54] going to be shot in the morning would
[1:06:56] you worry i said nope don't think so
[1:07:00] praise god
[1:07:02] paul and silas were worried when they
[1:07:04] were beaten and now i mean they hung in
[1:07:06] chains
[1:07:07] what were they doing worshiping not
[1:07:09] worrying
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] what a lesson for us
[1:07:14] they were arrested they were beaten i
[1:07:17] mean somebody saying something bad about
[1:07:19] me is enough to get me worked up for a
[1:07:21] week
[1:07:24] what if they laid you over a stump and
[1:07:26] they beat you across the back to your
[1:07:28] skin was hanging off and you were
[1:07:30] bleeding
[1:07:32] that would hurt your feelings
[1:07:33] and a little more
[1:07:37] but somebody says something not nice
[1:07:38] about us or misjudges us or misquotes us
[1:07:41] or misunderstands our intention in
[1:07:43] something and we can't we can't think
[1:07:45] right for days
[1:07:47] but here they are taken
[1:07:49] beaten rejected amen chained to a wall
[1:07:53] amen and they're worshiping
[1:07:57] why because god was still delighting in
[1:07:59] them
[1:08:01] i mean it didn't feel like it if you're
[1:08:02] going off emotions
[1:08:04] and feelings i doubt you know the pain
[1:08:07] when they would wince every time that
[1:08:09] they would move it probably didn't feel
[1:08:10] like god's love but they they were
[1:08:12] basing love on something other than the
[1:08:15] situation they were in they were basing
[1:08:17] his love on a revelation of who they
[1:08:18] were
[1:08:20] and that wasn't changing with the
[1:08:22] beating
[1:08:23] that didn't change by arrest and that
[1:08:25] didn't change my imprisonment
[1:08:29] he said
[1:08:31] well what if you were going to be shot
[1:08:33] in the morning would you worry nope
[1:08:34] don't think so why said worry couldn't
[1:08:37] do nothing
[1:08:39] it couldn't do nothing but make me worse
[1:08:43] this is the point
[1:08:45] worry won't change it
[1:08:50] what's the value and worry brother said
[1:08:52] there's no virtue strength into it at
[1:08:55] all
[1:08:56] it cannot improve your situation in fact
[1:08:59] those who struggle with anxiety or worry
[1:09:02] we've all worried from time to time
[1:09:03] we've all had anxiety but i want to ask
[1:09:06] you a question
[1:09:07] the thing that you worried about most
[1:09:10] did it ever happen the way you worried
[1:09:12] about it happening
[1:09:15] never
[1:09:17] at least for me
[1:09:19] like i said before i'm 100 accurate at
[1:09:21] being wrong about the future
[1:09:25] so most of the time it's vanity it's a
[1:09:27] waste of time it's a waste of mental
[1:09:29] energy it's a waste of emotional energy
[1:09:31] all we do is waste our time waste our
[1:09:33] minds waste our emotions on nothing
[1:09:36] and the majority of the time the thing
[1:09:38] we're worried about comes to not by the
[1:09:39] time we get there anyhow
[1:09:41] we would have been better off just
[1:09:42] acting like everything's fine and keep
[1:09:44] walking because in walking usually the
[1:09:46] problems begin to resolve themselves
[1:09:48] just by moving forward
[1:09:52] worry could do nothing but make me
[1:09:54] worse
[1:09:56] it makes the situation worse
[1:10:00] why
[1:10:01] why does it make the situation worse
[1:10:03] because brother branham said amnesia can
[1:10:05] come on by worry
[1:10:07] you can't properly identify who you are
[1:10:12] we're so mentally bogged down in the
[1:10:15] trial we're in we're so
[1:10:17] uh we're so
[1:10:19] encapsulated all we can see is problems
[1:10:22] problems problems trouble trouble and i
[1:10:24] can see no way out of this situation and
[1:10:26] we begin to worry and what we do is is
[1:10:29] that worry the situation is blinding us
[1:10:31] to the revelation of who we are
[1:10:34] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:10:38] but that's not what we say when we're
[1:10:39] worrying
[1:10:42] worry has no virtue word could do
[1:10:44] nothing but make me worse
[1:10:46] well what good is it going to do to have
[1:10:48] faith i said it might deliver me
[1:10:51] and that's right see so worry has no
[1:10:53] virtue to it at all but faith has all
[1:10:56] virtue believe
[1:10:58] just believe it's going to work out
[1:11:03] okay no i can't do that because that's
[1:11:05] kind of foolish i mean just assume it's
[1:11:07] going to work out and move forward yeah
[1:11:09] assume it's going to work out and move
[1:11:10] forward
[1:11:11] assume god's going to take care of it
[1:11:12] assume god's going to answer the
[1:11:14] question assume god's going to give you
[1:11:15] some wisdom assume god's going to turn
[1:11:17] the light on just keep moving forward
[1:11:18] and assume that it's going to work out
[1:11:21] but isn't that kind of childish i mean
[1:11:22] you don't have a plan you don't know
[1:11:23] what's coming next amen just assume that
[1:11:25] god's going to take care of it and keep
[1:11:27] moving forward
[1:11:30] why no i can't do that no okay then just
[1:11:33] you just sit there and wring your hands
[1:11:35] and worry about it for another week and
[1:11:36] see if that changes anything
[1:11:40] it'll change nothing
[1:11:43] but what will faith do
[1:11:45] i'll just get in motion
[1:11:48] what if i'm going the wrong way god will
[1:11:50] turn me because he delights in me what
[1:11:54] if you're making a mistake god will
[1:11:56] correct me because he delights in me his
[1:11:59] love for me hasn't changed but nothing's
[1:12:01] going to happen with me sitting on my
[1:12:03] hands crying weeping wishing the
[1:12:05] situation would change or i wasn't in
[1:12:07] this predicament nothing will change and
[1:12:10] if i sit here afraid to do anything
[1:12:15] well i'm afraid to do that because that
[1:12:16] might happen i'm afraid to do this
[1:12:18] because am i and i'm afraid to do that
[1:12:21] so i'll just stay here
[1:12:25] well how fast does that change things
[1:12:29] file a pile of bones sitting right here
[1:12:32] worry can do nothing but make it worse
[1:12:35] but why don't we just assume that he
[1:12:37] delights in us
[1:12:39] why don't we just assume that he knows
[1:12:41] the way that i take and when i'm tried i
[1:12:42] shall come forth as gold
[1:12:44] why can't we assume that's just the
[1:12:45] truth for us
[1:12:46] why can't we assume the fossils of the
[1:12:48] righteous order of the lord need the
[1:12:49] light in his way why can't we assume
[1:12:51] that he knows where i'm at he knows the
[1:12:53] situation he knows i don't have any
[1:12:55] answers he knows i'm not smart enough he
[1:12:57] knows that i cannot figure it out i'm
[1:13:00] just going to move trusting that he'll
[1:13:01] show me he'll do something he'll move
[1:13:03] friends that's the way to get something
[1:13:05] done that's the way to get out of your
[1:13:07] trouble into a different situation is to
[1:13:09] move forward
[1:13:10] when moses began to cry out he says why
[1:13:12] christ speak speak to the children of
[1:13:14] israel that they move forward
[1:13:16] move forward where
[1:13:19] do you realize when he says speak to the
[1:13:21] children of israel that they move
[1:13:22] forward there was no forward to move to
[1:13:26] there was cliffs here army here water
[1:13:29] here
[1:13:32] but he told them to move forward anyways
[1:13:34] amen so they just started moving amen
[1:13:36] somewhere along the movement somewhere
[1:13:38] in their motion i don't know when and i
[1:13:40] don't know where i don't know if a few
[1:13:42] of them got ankle deep before the waters
[1:13:44] farted i don't know but he told him to
[1:13:46] move before he told him to lift his rod
[1:13:52] he told him
[1:13:54] go forward
[1:13:57] and then god said now lift up your rod
[1:14:01] he told him to get in action before he
[1:14:02] provided the way through
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] why cry
[1:14:10] speak and go forward
[1:14:12] whatever situation you're in why cry
[1:14:15] i mean it's not changing anything
[1:14:18] why should one more tear
[1:14:21] why worry another night
[1:14:24] why not just move forward
[1:14:26] and say god you know the way that i take
[1:14:30] i i don't know what else to do
[1:14:33] this is the only thing i see all i know
[1:14:35] is you say why christ speak and go
[1:14:37] forward and i'm saying god i'm going
[1:14:39] forward in your name if i'm wrong move
[1:14:41] me if this is a mistake correct me amen
[1:14:44] i'm still your son and you still love me
[1:14:46] nothing's changed
[1:14:50] praise be to god friends
[1:14:54] worry will bring spiritual amnesia back
[1:14:57] on a believer
[1:14:58] where they can't properly identify
[1:15:00] themselves
[1:15:01] and they'll take measures that start
[1:15:03] looking like an unbeliever
[1:15:08] what do you mean they'll run around
[1:15:10] they'll try to provide for themselves
[1:15:11] they'll rack up credit cards trying to
[1:15:13] pay bills they'll do all they'll start
[1:15:14] acting like an unbeliever
[1:15:17] trying to take care of themselves
[1:15:18] provide for themselves go to the means
[1:15:20] of the world to fix everything
[1:15:23] instead of just moving forward and
[1:15:24] letting god make a way
[1:15:26] where there seems to be no way
[1:15:30] brother branham says in the message
[1:15:31] marriage and divorce
[1:15:33] now when i go overseas to make it right
[1:15:35] my little family gathers around and we
[1:15:37] pray with one another and i commit them
[1:15:39] to god and they commit me to god and
[1:15:41] when we do we go oversea i go overseas
[1:15:44] now i know she loves me i have
[1:15:45] confidence in her and her love and i
[1:15:47] love her she's got confidence in me
[1:15:50] as long as i love her like that she
[1:15:51] don't have any worry about me taking any
[1:15:53] other woman out
[1:15:54] and as long as she loves me right why
[1:15:56] there is no need of me thinking about
[1:15:58] any other man going out with her because
[1:16:00] she is my wife and i believe her
[1:16:04] i believe if i would actually do
[1:16:05] something wrong make a mistake and go
[1:16:07] out with some woman and return back and
[1:16:10] would confess it to her and tell her
[1:16:11] media i didn't mean to do that i just
[1:16:13] got caught in a trap this woman just ran
[1:16:15] right up to me and grabbed me by the arm
[1:16:17] and started sewing so i believe she
[1:16:19] would be understanding i believe she
[1:16:21] would forgive me for it
[1:16:23] but i wouldn't do it for nothing because
[1:16:25] i love her
[1:16:28] remember faith worketh by love
[1:16:30] i wouldn't do it because i love her
[1:16:32] though she would forgive me i wouldn't
[1:16:35] do it i wouldn't hurt her for nothing
[1:16:38] though i know she would forgive me for
[1:16:39] it i don't want to hurt her
[1:16:42] and that's the way it is with god if
[1:16:44] philia love which is human love
[1:16:46] fellowship love can make a man feel that
[1:16:47] way about his wife what about agape love
[1:16:50] the greek word meaning the love of god
[1:16:52] how would that make me do about jesus
[1:16:55] christ
[1:16:56] you see faith work is by love temperance
[1:16:58] by love patience by love amen all of
[1:17:01] these things work by love because if
[1:17:03] i've got the foundation of the love of
[1:17:05] god and i've got a revelation of of of
[1:17:07] my my position in christ then all of a
[1:17:10] sudden i wouldn't do anything to hurt me
[1:17:13] would he forgive me yes he would forgive
[1:17:14] me but i wouldn't do anything to hurt
[1:17:16] him
[1:17:17] i wouldn't do anything to displease him
[1:17:19] not on purpose not because i don't want
[1:17:21] to ever hurt him why because of love
[1:17:25] this this
[1:17:26] this kind of love and this kind of
[1:17:28] desire he is showing it with the desire
[1:17:31] between a husband and wife he said
[1:17:32] though my wife would forgive me i would
[1:17:34] never do nothing to hurt her i wouldn't
[1:17:36] want to hurt her he says in another
[1:17:37] place if i would do something wrong i'd
[1:17:39] feel the guiltiest man and i couldn't
[1:17:40] wait till the moment i could tell her
[1:17:41] what i did
[1:17:43] to make it right he said if that works
[1:17:45] that way with a man and a woman what
[1:17:46] about with god what about with you and
[1:17:49] god how is it supposed to work see this
[1:17:51] is the killer to religion
[1:17:54] the destroyer of religion the destroyer
[1:17:57] of rule keeping the destroyer of
[1:17:59] phariseeism
[1:18:02] because to be a to be a pharisee it's
[1:18:04] like trying to have a good marriage by
[1:18:06] doing everything right
[1:18:09] you're going to be
[1:18:10] tired i'm gonna have a good marriage
[1:18:13] because of everything right every
[1:18:14] tuesday i buy flowers every thursday we
[1:18:16] go on a date i remember every morning to
[1:18:18] say i love you honey i never leave
[1:18:20] without kissing her i know i always tell
[1:18:21] him i'm proud of him i never made a
[1:18:23] mistake we have a good marriage
[1:18:26] no you have a superficial marriage
[1:18:29] you have a marriage that can't endure
[1:18:31] hardship
[1:18:32] you have a marriage that's based on a
[1:18:34] surface level that's not very deep
[1:18:36] because if you if you make a mistake if
[1:18:38] you stroke the cat backwards one time
[1:18:40] see what happens
[1:18:43] see but a marriage that's based on true
[1:18:46] genuine love
[1:18:48] says if i did wrong she'd forgive me
[1:18:51] but i would as hard as i could never do
[1:18:53] anything to hurt her
[1:18:54] because i love her
[1:18:55] he says as long as i love her that way
[1:18:57] she's got confidence in me and as long
[1:19:00] as she loves me that way i've got
[1:19:01] confidence in her
[1:19:03] and though somebody would say something
[1:19:05] wrong or say something that hurt or i
[1:19:08] you would just forgive him and say that
[1:19:10] like brother branham did when mita
[1:19:11] slammed the door in his face oh lord you
[1:19:13] know she didn't mean that
[1:19:16] she's had a hard day
[1:19:17] she's always standing between them
[1:19:19] what's he doing he's interceding for her
[1:19:21] because they've got the right kind of
[1:19:22] love for his wife
[1:19:25] and if that works with marriage what
[1:19:27] about with god
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] though he would forgive me
[1:19:32] everything in me wants to please him
[1:19:36] everything in me wants to keep his word
[1:19:39] if that's what he wants everything in me
[1:19:42] wants what he wants
[1:19:44] friends anything short of that is not
[1:19:48] right yet
[1:19:49] i just want to say it that way if
[1:19:51] anything short
[1:19:53] of that desire that everything inside of
[1:19:55] me wants to please him
[1:19:57] everything in me wants to do what he
[1:19:59] wants me to do wants to keep his word
[1:20:01] and if i ever fail it makes me miserable
[1:20:05] if i ever not because somebody found out
[1:20:08] about it or not because i had to confess
[1:20:09] it because i hurt him
[1:20:11] if i ever fail and not another living
[1:20:14] soul ever knows of my failure i have
[1:20:16] just as much grief
[1:20:18] that's true that's the real reality to
[1:20:20] loving god amen sometimes people only
[1:20:22] have grief when they're caught and when
[1:20:24] it makes a personal cost to them that's
[1:20:27] still loving self more than loving god
[1:20:29] but when not another soul will ever know
[1:20:32] what you've done and how you failed it
[1:20:33] but you're just as miserable and weep
[1:20:35] just as much amen and you go through
[1:20:37] just as much agony that's when you're
[1:20:39] starting to hit the right kind of love
[1:20:41] and say god i want to please you
[1:20:43] not man you
[1:20:47] see religion is a it becomes a form and
[1:20:50] a structure to where we can look like a
[1:20:53] christian without really being one
[1:20:56] religion is where we can look like a
[1:20:59] christian without really being one
[1:21:01] but an invisible union with christ is
[1:21:04] really being a christian
[1:21:06] a marriage union between us and christ
[1:21:09] is really being a christian
[1:21:12] and that is based on love
[1:21:17] love
[1:21:18] that comes back to a revelation
[1:21:21] of where i started
[1:21:23] and where i'm going to wind up
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:28] it's not based on my conduct
[1:21:31] all of my conduct matters
[1:21:33] the seeing religion conducts the only
[1:21:35] thing that matters
[1:21:37] but in christianity love is the only
[1:21:39] thing that matters
[1:21:40] because love faith worketh by love
[1:21:44] and if you love him you keep his words
[1:21:49] works follow brother brahma says
[1:21:52] i i'm saved by faith faith worketh by
[1:21:54] love i'm saved by grace through faith
[1:21:58] he said but works
[1:22:00] is an expression of my love to him
[1:22:03] works are not required
[1:22:05] for the imputation of righteousness
[1:22:07] righteousness is imputed by my faith and
[1:22:09] faith worketh by love
[1:22:11] but my works my keeping his word and
[1:22:14] obeying and doing all in that that
[1:22:15] pleases him is an expression of my love
[1:22:20] so the cure for unbelief we say faith
[1:22:23] but i think the cure for unbelief is
[1:22:25] love
[1:22:26] because faith worketh by love
[1:22:29] and not an emotional love but a
[1:22:31] revelation that comes from god himself
[1:22:34] a real love of god
[1:22:36] that's dropped into my heart
[1:22:39] brother branham says
[1:22:42] and a greater than solomon is here
[1:22:44] the most horrible thing that there is
[1:22:46] friends is unbelief
[1:22:48] that's the only sin that there is
[1:22:51] there is no other sin but unbelief i was
[1:22:53] preaching on that some years ago in a
[1:22:55] methodist church
[1:22:57] he says and i was a nice big methodist
[1:22:58] church and most of them some of them
[1:22:59] believe in holiness and southern
[1:23:01] methodist and i was preaching about said
[1:23:03] committing adultery is not a sin telling
[1:23:05] lies not a sin taking lord's name is not
[1:23:07] a sin
[1:23:08] that was just too much for some dear old
[1:23:09] sister sitting there with her little
[1:23:11] collar all up around she said i pray you
[1:23:13] tell me what is sin
[1:23:14] that's right she just couldn't hold it
[1:23:16] any longer i said sin sin is this my
[1:23:19] sister sin is unbelief
[1:23:21] they do those things they commit
[1:23:23] adultery they tell lies they do those
[1:23:25] things it's the attributes of
[1:23:32] unbelief it's the attributes of unbelief
[1:23:37] see so many times we're chasing the
[1:23:39] attributes of unbelief
[1:23:42] trying not to smoke trying not to swear
[1:23:45] trying not to lie trying not to look
[1:23:48] trying not
[1:23:52] we spend so much time
[1:23:55] chasing
[1:23:56] the attributes of sin
[1:23:59] and not dealing with sin
[1:24:02] if i could just quit smoking if i could
[1:24:04] just quit if i could just turn my head
[1:24:06] like mother bear said turn my head if i
[1:24:08] could just stop this if if i didn't have
[1:24:12] those are attributes
[1:24:16] you know if i could just remember to be
[1:24:18] nice to my wife i could just remember if
[1:24:21] i could just think of her from time to
[1:24:22] time or if she could just think of me if
[1:24:24] i could remember or if i could say
[1:24:26] something nice if i would
[1:24:29] those are attributes of a problem
[1:24:32] that's not the problem
[1:24:33] the problem is there's something broken
[1:24:35] in the relationship
[1:24:37] and if the relationship gets right
[1:24:39] all the attributes of that relationship
[1:24:41] go right you think of one another you
[1:24:43] say nice things to one another you say
[1:24:45] nice things about one another you look
[1:24:47] to do things for each other because you
[1:24:49] have expressions of love because the
[1:24:50] relationship is right but when the
[1:24:52] relationship is broken all of a sudden
[1:24:54] we don't think of one another right we
[1:24:56] don't say nice things about one another
[1:24:58] we don't say nice things to one another
[1:25:00] we forget about one another and we don't
[1:25:01] put each other first
[1:25:03] and so we could try to make a list i've
[1:25:05] gotta make sure that i say i love you
[1:25:07] honey and i i like this and uh thank you
[1:25:10] for dinner
[1:25:13] see we're chasing the attributes and not
[1:25:15] going to the heart of the problem
[1:25:18] and we're trying to get the attributes
[1:25:19] right this is how religion works
[1:25:22] trying to get the attributes right and
[1:25:24] not realize we have a broken
[1:25:25] relationship with god
[1:25:28] and we've got all these attributes of
[1:25:30] unbelief because there's we've never
[1:25:32] come into unity with christ
[1:25:35] we've never gone into the third chamber
[1:25:37] which is the bedroom and become one with
[1:25:39] christ
[1:25:41] where relationships never went deep
[1:25:42] enough amen and so we're dealing with
[1:25:44] all kinds of attributes of unbelief but
[1:25:46] we're not getting down to the heart of
[1:25:49] what the problem is and if it works in a
[1:25:51] marriage amen what about with us in
[1:25:53] christ
[1:25:55] and if we can dig down a little bit
[1:25:57] deeper
[1:25:58] and we can move past all the superficial
[1:26:00] stuff amen saying hallelujah and showing
[1:26:03] up to church on time every time and
[1:26:05] never saying a bad word and always
[1:26:07] saying please and thank you if we could
[1:26:09] get past that and get down to the heart
[1:26:11] of it amen and find out where we came
[1:26:13] from and why christ died and who he died
[1:26:15] for and where was i when he was on the
[1:26:18] cross
[1:26:20] where was was i in him or out of him if
[1:26:22] i was in him then he loves me and always
[1:26:24] loves me if i was out of him i could
[1:26:25] never put myself in him
[1:26:28] if we could get down to the root of it
[1:26:30] why does he love me where does his love
[1:26:32] originate why is it i love him so much
[1:26:34] and we get down to the heart of it and
[1:26:35] we have a mended relationship when the
[1:26:38] relationship is mended all the
[1:26:40] attributes of unbelief begin to
[1:26:42] disappear
[1:26:44] because
[1:26:45] why would i lie
[1:26:47] why would i lie
[1:26:49] i was in him before the foundation of
[1:26:51] the world
[1:26:53] i'm going
[1:26:54] to eternity i come from eternity he
[1:26:57] loves me i have no desire to lie
[1:27:00] i have no desire
[1:27:02] the attributes begin to vanish away when
[1:27:04] we get down to the heart of the matter
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:09] religion is man trying to live good
[1:27:14] but the reality is
[1:27:16] you'll never make it
[1:27:18] but the revelation of who we are unlocks
[1:27:20] a whole new dimension to us
[1:27:23] and we realize
[1:27:24] i'm a predestinated sea gene of god a
[1:27:27] part of god is living on the inside all
[1:27:29] i've got to do is deny myself amen and
[1:27:32] then live for him and out of this will
[1:27:35] come everything that will kill the
[1:27:36] attributes of unbelief
[1:27:38] and so we've got to get down to sin is
[1:27:40] unbelief amen what's the opposite
[1:27:42] unbelief faith faith worketh by love
[1:27:47] love is a revelation
[1:27:50] of who he is and who we are in him
[1:27:53] praise god
[1:27:57] amen
[1:28:02] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[1:28:03] of time
[1:28:06] and he comes back and he tells us you
[1:28:07] know there was people there i shook
[1:28:09] their hands i hugged their neck and he
[1:28:11] tells us about this experience he has
[1:28:13] beyond the curtain of time
[1:28:15] and he comes back and in the message
[1:28:16] adoption 1960 says oh lord
[1:28:19] that's when i'm here at the church for
[1:28:21] trying to set the church in order
[1:28:22] telling your brother and sister there's
[1:28:24] only one thing that can enter that
[1:28:26] that's perfect love
[1:28:29] he went there
[1:28:30] he saw what the reality was beyond the
[1:28:34] curtain of time
[1:28:35] and he came back and he said the only
[1:28:37] thing they can enter there is perfect
[1:28:40] love
[1:28:42] to me
[1:28:44] that's a religion
[1:28:45] killer
[1:28:49] i believe the message that's not what's
[1:28:51] required to enter there
[1:28:54] i mean you'll believe the message do you
[1:28:56] understand you can intellectually
[1:28:57] believe the message and not have what's
[1:28:59] required to enter there
[1:29:02] i was always a good boy i never sinned i
[1:29:04] never did anything wrong when when this
[1:29:06] man came to jesus the rich young ruler
[1:29:08] and he said hey what can i do to have
[1:29:10] eternal life he says you know the
[1:29:12] commandments honor father and mother do
[1:29:13] all this he said i've done all of that
[1:29:15] from my youth
[1:29:17] and the scripture says jesus
[1:29:20] beholding him loved him
[1:29:23] loved him
[1:29:25] and this man was talking religion
[1:29:29] what can i do
[1:29:30] what can i do
[1:29:33] to have eternal life what can i do have
[1:29:35] you turned a line
[1:29:36] we'll do this up
[1:29:39] yes
[1:29:40] got it in the bag
[1:29:41] i've done that since i was a kid
[1:29:45] jesus looking at him loved him
[1:29:49] loved him
[1:29:50] he said one thing you lack
[1:29:52] sell all that you have
[1:29:54] give it to the poor and come follow me
[1:29:58] what did jesus do
[1:30:00] he went right past his religion right to
[1:30:02] his heart
[1:30:04] right past the looking good right past
[1:30:06] the formalism right past the keeping the
[1:30:08] commandment and dressing right he went
[1:30:10] right past everything on the surface and
[1:30:12] went right down to his heart and when he
[1:30:14] when he got down to the heart this man
[1:30:16] loved his riches in position loved
[1:30:18] himself more than he loved the
[1:30:20] manifested word
[1:30:22] which was god
[1:30:24] jesus was god the manifested word on
[1:30:26] display and when it came down to he said
[1:30:28] take all those riches
[1:30:30] sell them all and come and follow me he
[1:30:32] got the greatest opportunity that a
[1:30:34] human being could receive
[1:30:37] and he walked away grieved because he
[1:30:39] had great riches and he come to the same
[1:30:42] showdown and he and he found out and
[1:30:44] what he realized what was real what we
[1:30:46] realized through all of this is he loved
[1:30:48] himself more than he loved jesus christ
[1:30:51] he loved himself more than he loved god
[1:30:54] amen that's what god wants to come to in
[1:30:56] every one of us he wants to cut past
[1:30:59] i've listened to 1200 sermons he wants
[1:31:01] to cut past i believe the message and
[1:31:03] cut past i dressed right and i act right
[1:31:05] and i go to church every time the doors
[1:31:07] are open he wants to cut all past that
[1:31:09] and says i want you to give up
[1:31:10] everything that you hold dear and come
[1:31:12] and follow me
[1:31:13] i want you to sell out everything i want
[1:31:15] you to die to everything i want to get
[1:31:17] down to the core of who you are and i
[1:31:19] want you to be willing to lose it all to
[1:31:21] come and follow me
[1:31:24] that's when we're getting past religion
[1:31:26] friends and getting down into a restored
[1:31:28] relationship amen
[1:31:30] and when that relationship goes from
[1:31:32] broken to restored you don't have to
[1:31:34] worry about the attributes they just
[1:31:36] come out
[1:31:38] when two people really love one another
[1:31:40] and they get married and they're based
[1:31:41] on a genuine or genuine real love for
[1:31:44] one another you don't have to worry
[1:31:45] about them being nice to each other
[1:31:48] it just happens
[1:31:50] amen you don't have to worry about it
[1:31:53] it's a it's an outcrop of a restored
[1:31:55] relationship
[1:31:59] the worst sickness in the world
[1:32:00] is unbelief
[1:32:02] the opposite of unbelief is faith
[1:32:04] but faith which worketh by love
[1:32:08] let's stand
[1:32:11] we'll just stop there we're not done but
[1:32:12] we're stopping
[1:32:13] for tonight
[1:32:15] musicians if you could come brother john
[1:32:18] make your way up
[1:32:20] i'll tell you what
[1:32:22] i was sitting today just looking out my
[1:32:24] window study and i was just meditating
[1:32:27] on this
[1:32:30] and i was thinking about john
[1:32:33] john caught up in the heavens through
[1:32:35] the open door beyond the church ages
[1:32:37] moving into the
[1:32:39] seeing the breach moving from the breach
[1:32:40] to the seals amen hearing the thunders
[1:32:43] seeing the millennium seeing the new
[1:32:45] heavens and new earth amen seeing it all
[1:32:49] he comes back
[1:32:51] he's not puffed up he's not arrogant
[1:32:53] he's not antagonistic
[1:32:57] he got the revelation we're supposed to
[1:32:58] be receiving
[1:33:02] and he comes back
[1:33:04] the apostle of love
[1:33:06] brother baby said in the quote i have it
[1:33:08] here but i didn't read it he says
[1:33:10] brother says i'm told when john got too
[1:33:12] old to preach he would just sit there
[1:33:13] and scream little children love one
[1:33:15] another
[1:33:17] couldn't preach no more but the most
[1:33:19] important thing you could say is little
[1:33:21] children love one another
[1:33:23] why god is love
[1:33:27] love
[1:33:28] if you have the right kind of love
[1:33:30] you don't have to worry about stealing
[1:33:34] why would you steal when god provides
[1:33:36] for me
[1:33:38] why would you lie when god has ears
[1:33:42] right right
[1:33:43] why would you do secret things in the
[1:33:45] dark when nobody's watching because god
[1:33:47] sees all
[1:33:50] you know if we're able to do those
[1:33:52] things if we're able to cheat people
[1:33:54] we're able to manipulate situations if
[1:33:56] we're able to deceive in secret and
[1:33:58] we're able to hide behind closed doors
[1:34:00] or do things in dark that we wouldn't do
[1:34:01] in the line amen all that we're doing is
[1:34:04] showing that we really don't believe god
[1:34:06] can see me now
[1:34:08] and hear me now
[1:34:09] and it's an expression of unbelief
[1:34:12] amen but when we come into the realities
[1:34:15] and contacting a real god oh you can get
[1:34:17] spiritual amnesia it can creep back
[1:34:19] through worry you can get a shock in
[1:34:20] your life you can fail you can fall you
[1:34:22] can do all of those things but you're
[1:34:24] going to get snapped back to reality
[1:34:25] before too long you're going to realize
[1:34:27] he saw me he heard me he knows the way i
[1:34:29] take and i'm going to repent right now
[1:34:32] we're not going to continue with a
[1:34:34] revelation of who god is we're not going
[1:34:36] to continue in those things
[1:34:39] you don't have to worry about it because
[1:34:40] you know he loves you and you've
[1:34:41] connected to him and you made a real
[1:34:43] connection and you know he always sees
[1:34:45] he always hears and he always knows
[1:34:49] and with the right kind of love we're
[1:34:51] going to say i don't want him to be
[1:34:52] displeased i don't want him to be hurt i
[1:34:54] don't want to do anything to hurt my
[1:34:57] lord because i love him
[1:35:00] you see how that fixes everything
[1:35:02] the problem just goes away
[1:35:06] if eve would have loved the word more
[1:35:08] than she loved herself we wouldn't be in
[1:35:09] this situation right now
[1:35:12] but the cure for the situation the
[1:35:14] atoning blood of jesus christ came
[1:35:16] because jesus loved the word more than
[1:35:18] he loved himself
[1:35:20] setting an example for us
[1:35:23] that we can follow in his footsteps
[1:35:26] oh
[1:35:27] i want the real
[1:35:29] i'm so hungry for the real
[1:35:32] i'm so i'm starving for the reality
[1:35:36] not to put on not the phony not the show
[1:35:40] i'm so sick of the show i'm starving for
[1:35:43] the realities of god
[1:35:45] for myself amen to live in that reality
[1:35:48] all the time to dwell with the people
[1:35:50] who have made contact with god they
[1:35:52] don't need to be prodded they don't need
[1:35:54] to be coached they mean they don't need
[1:35:55] all they need is to make that connection
[1:35:57] with god and god takes over
[1:35:59] all you got to do is point to the word
[1:36:01] and everybody's made that connection
[1:36:02] they run through the word amen there's
[1:36:04] no poking prodding there's no i mean
[1:36:06] there's no leading along with a carrot
[1:36:08] amen
[1:36:11] what should we be like as the bride of
[1:36:13] jesus christ
[1:36:15] amen
[1:36:17] i want the reality i say god give me the
[1:36:20] reality
[1:36:21] make me the
[1:36:22] reality of this love and this word on
[1:36:25] display
[1:36:26] let's bow our heads and pray lord
[1:36:29] god you've heard our prayer
[1:36:31] you see the hands that are raised you
[1:36:33] know the desire of our hearts we want
[1:36:35] the reality of this life lord
[1:36:37] god you've made every provision for us
[1:36:40] lord you've saw it all before you made
[1:36:43] sure everything was laid out just right
[1:36:46] and god we love you lord
[1:36:48] we thank you for the word that you've
[1:36:50] given in this hour to waken us out of
[1:36:52] spiritual amnesia so that we can see the
[1:36:53] realities so that we can properly
[1:36:55] identify who we really are
[1:36:58] now we ask oh that you would make us
[1:37:00] live in that lord let us live in that
[1:37:02] reality
[1:37:04] we love you father forgive us lord for
[1:37:07] our spiritual amnesia forgive us for our
[1:37:09] worry forgive us lord for our doubts and
[1:37:12] our fears and all of those things we
[1:37:14] just repent now lord
[1:37:16] help us to walk secure in your love for
[1:37:18] us help us lord to be reminded of your
[1:37:22] love every moment of every day
[1:37:24] so that we can react accordingly lord so
[1:37:27] that we can react with faith that
[1:37:28] worketh by love not by worry not by
[1:37:31] anxiety not by self-love but we can
[1:37:34] abandon ourselves because you love us
[1:37:37] oh god how we love you
[1:37:39] we ask that you have your way with us
[1:37:41] move upon your people
[1:37:43] so we go from here lord let us walk in
[1:37:45] the realities of your love
[1:37:47] and let it be on display in this world
[1:37:49] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:37:52] amen
[1:37:54] i tell you friends
[1:37:58] there's no way to do that justice by
[1:37:59] preaching
[1:38:01] i'm done now and i know that i totally
[1:38:03] failed to preach it right
[1:38:05] but i hope that it hit the heart right
[1:38:08] i hope that between these lips and your
[1:38:10] heart that the the interpreter of the
[1:38:12] word come along and planted it right in
[1:38:14] your heart
[1:38:16] because i i don't know how in human
[1:38:18] words to express it i don't know how to
[1:38:20] explain it i don't know which angle to
[1:38:22] take it from to make it hit but we've
[1:38:24] got to get past the superficial and down
[1:38:26] to the reality
[1:38:29] back to the root amen back to the living
[1:38:31] god living in his people it's got to be
[1:38:34] real amen are counting me out
[1:38:37] amen everything that we see happening is
[1:38:40] just trying to move us back to where
[1:38:41] we're supposed to be
[1:38:44] not to have spiritual amnesia but to
[1:38:46] have an awakening of who we really are
[1:38:49] moving past the worry or worrying about
[1:38:51] when anybody else thinks
[1:38:53] if god saw me before the foundation of
[1:38:56] the world and he saw me in this
[1:38:58] predicament from before the foundation
[1:39:00] of the world
[1:39:01] then i don't have to take care of myself
[1:39:05] i don't have to provide for myself i
[1:39:07] don't have to protect myself i you
[1:39:10] realize we can actually abandon self
[1:39:14] it's not reckless
[1:39:16] it's not foolish
[1:39:18] it's the only option it's the only
[1:39:20] choice that makes any sense when you
[1:39:22] catch a revelation if he brought me here
[1:39:25] if he backed me into this corner if he
[1:39:27] brought all these situation to pass to
[1:39:29] get me here amen that it's then he
[1:39:31] decided to put me here before the
[1:39:33] foundation of the world i'm an expressed
[1:39:35] attribute of him he's not going to lose
[1:39:37] one he's already decided how he's going
[1:39:39] to win this victory and what comes next
[1:39:41] what i need to do is forget all my ideas
[1:39:44] quit trying to preserve my life quit
[1:39:46] trying to save my reputation and just
[1:39:48] say god it's all you

[1:40:08] but i can't sit still anymore i'm moving
[1:40:11] but i'm trusting that as i pick my feet

[1:40:15] center of your will your rod and your
[1:40:16] staff they come from me you can guide me
[1:40:18] you can correct me but i'm not going to
