[6:05] when you miss service something is
[6:08] missing
[6:09] i don't know if you felt that way but i

[6:12] something's out of place but
[6:14] it's starting to feel better now amen
[6:16] amen let's take our bibles and turn to
[6:18] john chapter 20.
[6:20] we'll read the scripture together and
[6:21] then let you have your seats
[6:24] john chapter 20 we'll read
[6:28] two verses starting in verse 21.
[6:32] john 20 and 21
[6:35] then said jesus to them again peace be
[6:37] unto you as my father hath sent
[6:39] me even so send i you and when he had
[6:42] said this he breathed on them
[6:44] and saith unto them receive ye the holy
[6:47] ghost
[6:48] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[6:51] we thank you father
[6:53] you're so good to us lord and we're just
[6:55] so thankful that you have given us this
[6:57] opportunity to be here lord
[6:59] and god having been absent lord on
[7:02] sunday makes it even more precious to us
[7:04] lord
[7:04] we realize how wonderful these times are
[7:07] help us to never take them for granted
[7:09] lord
[7:10] i pray god as we come and focus our
[7:12] attention on you
[7:13] on your word i pray that you would break
[7:15] the bread of life for us lord
[7:17] you do come and do it yourself lord so
[7:19] that we can see you here in our midst
[7:21] in the breaking of bread feed us your
[7:24] lambs lord and help us to go away from
[7:26] here
[7:26] lord having been fed lord and
[7:28] strengthened for this life
[7:30] we give you preeminence and ask you to
[7:32] take your place among us
[7:33] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[7:36] you can have your seats for a title
[7:40] tonight i'd like to talk about the token
[7:42] is the assurance the token is the
[7:45] assurance
[7:46] and this is what i was on my heart for
[7:48] sunday and i was
[7:50] been studying been meditating for many
[7:51] days and saturday all day i had a
[7:53] wonderful day i was really looking
[7:54] forward to sunday morning service
[7:56] and so now i've had a few more days to
[7:58] meditate on and this subject just keeps
[8:00] blowing up it keeps getting bigger and
[8:01] bigger
[8:02] so we'll just see how far we get today
[8:04] and if we don't get very far we'll
[8:05] finish it lord willing
[8:06] on sunday but but you know we've talked
[8:09] about uh over the last couple of weeks
[8:11] we talked about justification and
[8:12] justification by faith
[8:14] and how it's the imputation of
[8:15] righteousness and it was
[8:17] god's program it was god's plan that he
[8:20] made it
[8:20] by faith so that it could be by grace so
[8:23] that the promise would be sure to all
[8:24] the seed amen
[8:26] so that he would make sure that we
[8:27] wouldn't miss it he would put something
[8:29] in us that had the capacity to receive
[8:31] the word for our day
[8:33] and in being able to receive the word
[8:35] for our day he would recognize us
[8:37] as seed and that faith reaching out and
[8:39] believing
[8:40] god god would in turn impute unto us
[8:43] righteousness and
[8:44] not impute our sins amen
[8:47] and that's by grace friends amen i mean
[8:50] it's
[8:50] it it's by grace i mean by grace we
[8:53] believe
[8:54] by faith and that not of ourselves it is
[8:55] the gift of god and so we re
[8:57] recognize that the capacity to believe
[9:00] is by grace it's something that god has
[9:01] done and god's portioned a portion of
[9:03] himself out
[9:04] and he knew what ground and what bed it
[9:06] would fall in and what time it would
[9:07] come
[9:08] forth and he intended that for to be the
[9:10] genuine us amen
[9:12] and so it's by grace and then we talked
[9:14] again about sanctification and
[9:16] we talked about you know sanctification
[9:18] comes by the washing of the water of the
[9:20] word amen the bleeding
[9:22] word in this day the word that bled
[9:23] forth and died for us is now
[9:25] the washing of the water of the word
[9:27] that's there to cleanse us amen
[9:29] to cleanse us from the prostitutes of
[9:31] denomination and unbelief and
[9:33] all the things that go with that and
[9:35] that's also an act of grace
[9:39] you can't clean yourself what what are
[9:41] you going to use to clean yourself amen
[9:43] what do you have that's pure
[9:45] what do you have in yourself and in your
[9:47] flesh in your mind
[9:48] what do you have in this earth that you
[9:50] can use to rid
[9:51] yourself amen of hybridization and rid
[9:54] yourself of of all the unbelief
[9:56] you don't have anything that you can
[9:58] clean yourself with
[9:59] so he has to clean you amen with
[10:01] something that he's provided
[10:03] and that is the bleeding word amen that
[10:06] is the pure word that will wash
[10:08] all the filth of the prostitutes away
[10:10] from us
[10:11] and that is by grace all we got to do is
[10:14] stand under the
[10:15] water of the word amen you know washes
[10:18] and
[10:19] now we want to talk about the baptism in
[10:20] the holy ghost and i'm just going to
[10:22] take one little sliver
[10:23] it's a huge subject but i'm just going
[10:24] to look at one little sliver if you
[10:26] allow me to do that
[10:27] and i'll talk about the token is the
[10:28] assurance but when we come back to this
[10:30] scripture
[10:32] jesus says unto them
[10:35] first he says in verse 21
[10:39] he says peace be unto you as my father
[10:41] sent me even so send i you
[10:43] so i'm going to send you the same way my
[10:44] father sent me and brother ben said how
[10:46] did the father send him he said he went
[10:48] in him
[10:49] and so then jesus then in verse 22 and
[10:52] he
[10:52] said this he breathed on them and said
[10:55] unto them receive you the holy ghost
[10:58] now when you breathed on them it takes
[11:00] you all the way back to
[11:01] genesis chapter two when god made man
[11:04] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[11:06] breath of life and he became a living
[11:07] soul
[11:08] and now jesus is sitting there he's
[11:10] foreshadowing what's going to come
[11:12] and he breathes on them because it's the
[11:13] it's a symbolic of the breath of god the
[11:16] life of god coming
[11:17] in amen and and told them to receive the
[11:19] holy ghost
[11:20] now i want you to when you look at this
[11:23] i want to back up a little bit i want to
[11:24] be real simple i i hope i can be real
[11:27] simple
[11:27] tonight but i want to say it this whose
[11:30] idea was this was it the disciples
[11:34] asking for something or was it god
[11:36] promising something amen was it christ
[11:39] telling them that he was going to do
[11:40] something
[11:41] or was it the disciples asking him for a
[11:43] favor
[11:44] you realize the baptism of the holy
[11:46] ghost is not it's not our idea it's his
[11:49] idea it wasn't our desire we could never
[11:52] have a desire for unless he
[11:54] first amen promised it and so
[11:57] we we because of uh denominational
[12:00] teaching and wrong understanding
[12:02] i i found that within myself growing up
[12:04] in the pentecostal church i had the
[12:06] wrong
[12:06] understanding of the baptism of the holy
[12:08] ghost the baptism of the holy ghost was
[12:10] always for me the carrot at the end of
[12:12] the stick
[12:16] i could never be good enough i could
[12:17] never get it right i could never keep
[12:19] from failing
[12:20] i mean i could never feel like i had the
[12:21] babies and the holy ghost every time i
[12:22] felt like i had an experience
[12:24] or a sensation or a good time at the
[12:25] altar then something would happen i
[12:27] would fail i would make a mistake
[12:28] and then i would have to go all the way
[12:30] back to the beginning and start over
[12:32] so the baptism of the holy ghost was
[12:33] always the carrot at the end of the
[12:34] stick
[12:35] and it was frustrating and
[12:38] you know i wanted to be right i wanted
[12:40] to be right with god we have a desire to
[12:42] be right with god and be filled with the
[12:43] spirit
[12:44] be sealed into the day of our redemption
[12:46] amen but
[12:47] but when it becomes just our desire and
[12:50] not his desire
[12:53] our you know it's something we when we
[12:56] begin to
[12:57] uh when we begin to look at it in the
[12:59] manner of this
[13:00] is something that i need i've got to
[13:03] have
[13:04] i've got to go to god and i've got to
[13:05] convince him to give me this
[13:08] instead of understanding that this has
[13:10] been god's plan from the beginning
[13:12] this is something he wanted to do
[13:15] he didn't tell the disciples to go get
[13:17] the holy ghost
[13:20] he told them to receive the holy ghost
[13:24] when we look at this word receive it's
[13:26] it's super interesting
[13:28] and in the fact he jesus initiated the
[13:31] whole thing
[13:32] by telling them that as the father sent
[13:34] me so send i you
[13:35] and when he said this he breathed on
[13:37] them they didn't ask for anything
[13:41] he breathed on them and then he's the
[13:44] one who initiated the action
[13:46] he's the one who breathed on them
[13:48] signifying the breath of life
[13:49] the spirit of god that was going to come
[13:51] into them amen and then he told them
[13:54] to receive it
[13:57] and so you can't receive what's not
[14:00] given you can't receive what's not
[14:01] provided
[14:04] he didn't tell him to go find it or go
[14:06] get it he told them to receive it
[14:08] and that term that that terminology
[14:10] means it's
[14:11] there for you to take it's there it's
[14:13] been given
[14:14] it's been breathed on you and then you
[14:16] just have to receive it
[14:18] and even the word in the greek it means
[14:22] it's interpreted receive take have catch
[14:27] it means to take to take with the hand
[14:30] to lay hold of any person or thing in
[14:33] order to use it to take up a thing to be
[14:35] carried
[14:35] to take upon oneself to take in order to
[14:38] carry away without the notion of
[14:40] violence
[14:40] to remove to take away to take what is
[14:43] one's own
[14:44] to take to oneself to take one's own
[14:48] to claim to procure for oneself
[14:51] amen jesus is saying just he's saying
[14:54] just receive it
[14:57] don't go find it don't make it up don't
[15:00] don't
[15:00] hunt all over just it's coming to you
[15:03] just receive it
[15:04] it's breathed on you just receive it the
[15:06] holy ghost is coming receive it
[15:10] let's turn over to acts chapter 2.
[15:14] i just want to lay these scriptures in
[15:15] as a foundation and i said i want to
[15:17] just be real
[15:18] simple because i found you know me
[15:20] growing up in pentecost and coming to
[15:22] the message initially i carried over
[15:24] that wrong thinking
[15:25] and it's taken a while for god to wash
[15:27] all that out of me and then you realize
[15:29] that that you know i'm justified by his
[15:31] grace for what he
[15:32] chose before the foundation of the world
[15:34] and what he did for me i'm sanctified by
[15:36] the washing of the water that he
[15:37] provided
[15:39] that he poured upon me that he washed me
[15:41] and if i receive the holy ghost it's
[15:43] going to be by the same thing by grace
[15:45] because it's something he gave
[15:46] that he wanted me to have that he
[15:48] provided that he promised and all
[15:50] he's asking me to do is receive it
[15:54] these terms are simple we make them
[15:56] complicated
[15:59] acts chapter 2 verse 37
[16:02] this is the day of pentecost peter is
[16:04] preaching and
[16:05] verse 37 now when they heard this they
[16:07] were pricked in their heart
[16:09] and said in peter and to the rest of the
[16:10] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[16:12] do
[16:13] i mean i think the most important part
[16:15] of this at the beginning here
[16:16] is the fact that the word being preached
[16:19] in its power amen
[16:21] see what peter was doing was peter was
[16:23] standing up and he was taking old
[16:24] testament prophecy and he was bringing
[16:26] it to date and saying that is this.
[16:30] and he was saying the prophecy of joel
[16:32] is this it's not what you think you're
[16:33] judging this wrongly this is the
[16:35] fulfillment of this prophecy this is the
[16:37] day this is the time
[16:38] this is the the word for the day and
[16:41] they were pricked in their heart
[16:43] amen you realize what he's going to say
[16:46] next
[16:46] is is prerequisited by this statement
[16:51] that they heard the word for their day
[16:52] and they were pricked in their heart
[16:55] amen then and then peter's going to give
[16:58] instructions but
[16:59] that is what happens first
[17:02] the scriptures are so simple friends
[17:06] they said men and brethren what shall we
[17:08] do then peter said unto them
[17:09] repent and be baptized every one of you
[17:12] in the name of jesus christ for the
[17:14] remission of sins
[17:15] and you shall receive the gift
[17:18] of the holy ghost for the promise is
[17:21] unto you
[17:22] and to your children and to all that are
[17:24] far off
[17:25] even as many as the lord our god shall
[17:28] call
[17:30] now when you read that scripture just
[17:32] take it for face value friends and don't
[17:34] read a bunch of stuff into it don't
[17:36] bring up a bunch of baggage from the
[17:37] past
[17:38] just read what it says and i want to ask
[17:39] you how complicated
[17:41] is it in the scripture to receive the
[17:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[17:46] how difficult did peter make it on the
[17:48] day of pentecost
[17:49] amen how complicated was it amen they
[17:53] heard the word for their day
[17:54] they were pricked in their heart and
[17:55] they wanted to do something about it
[17:57] amen they believed it was true and they
[17:59] wanted to know what to do next
[18:00] and he said repent repent for all the
[18:02] wrong that you've done for all the wrong
[18:03] you've believed
[18:04] repent amen and be baptized in the name
[18:07] of the lord jesus christ with remission
[18:08] of sins
[18:09] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[18:12] holy ghost
[18:13] gift of the holy ghost
[18:17] gift of the holy ghost as i said i want
[18:20] to make it so simple like it's childish
[18:23] because a gift is not something you earn
[18:26] you paid for you deserve
[18:32] amen it's something that's given amen it
[18:35] was breathed upon the church
[18:37] and now he's saying you shall receive
[18:39] it's the same word received that jesus
[18:42] says receive ye the holy ghost to take
[18:44] to take upon oneself
[18:45] to take in one's possession amen it's
[18:48] there for you to take
[18:49] but you have to believe it this way
[18:54] not over complicate it not change the
[18:56] scripture amen
[18:57] not bring pentecostal ideas and mix them
[19:00] in with the book of acts but just take
[19:02] it the way peter gave it amen
[19:03] that you hear the word amen the word
[19:06] pricks you in the heart you
[19:07] know that what you're hearing is the
[19:08] truth and you've got to do something
[19:10] about it
[19:11] and he tells you to repent be baptized
[19:13] in the name of lord jesus christ and you
[19:15] shall
[19:15] receive i tell me how that word will
[19:18] ever fail
[19:20] how will it work for others but not work
[19:22] now it's to them that are
[19:24] far off as many as the lord our god
[19:26] should call
[19:31] amen the question is did god call you
[19:36] if god called you it's for you
[19:39] if in hearing the word your heart was
[19:41] pricked amen and you had the capacity to
[19:43] repent
[19:44] and be baptized in his name then you
[19:46] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[19:48] and you've got to believe it that way
[19:53] brother branham made this statement i
[19:55] thought it was so unusual because it's
[19:57] so
[19:58] true he said some people won't receive
[20:01] the holy ghost
[20:02] unless they speak in tongues now listen
[20:07] how important that is
[20:11] he's not saying they weren't eligible
[20:13] for it he's not saying they couldn't
[20:14] have it
[20:15] he's not saying it wasn't available he
[20:18] said they wouldn't receive it
[20:22] because they had their own idea about
[20:24] how it should come
[20:27] instead of just sticking with the
[20:28] scripture
[20:30] being pricked in the heart that that is
[20:32] an act of grace friends that's not
[20:34] something you do they weren't pricked in
[20:35] the mind they were pricked in the heart
[20:38] they were had the capacity to repent and
[20:41] then in obedience to the word they were
[20:43] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[20:44] christ
[20:45] and they shall receive the gift of the
[20:47] holy ghost because it's for you
[20:49] and your children and to those that are
[20:51] far off and as many as the lord our god
[20:53] shall call
[20:54] peter didn't make it complicated man has
[20:57] made it complicated
[21:00] and if god has called you and by his
[21:02] grace you're pricked in the heart
[21:04] you were able to receive uh repent and
[21:07] receive his word and be baptized in his
[21:08] name
[21:09] then the word says you shall receive the
[21:11] gift of the holy ghost
[21:14] and that word receive is the same to
[21:16] take with the hand
[21:18] to lay hold of to take what is one's own
[21:21] to take to oneself
[21:24] man there's a part that god has done but
[21:27] he's asking us just to receive it
[21:30] the devil has gotten in and made things
[21:32] complicated
[21:34] let's go back to acts chapter 1.
[21:42] i'm going to read this scripture and i
[21:44] just want to read some quotes i'm going
[21:46] to read what brother branham said
[21:48] amen and there's a lot that brother
[21:50] brahm says on this subject
[21:51] there's so much that brother banh says
[21:54] on this subject as he preaches to so
[21:56] many types of people
[21:58] that you can find anything you want to
[22:00] make any doctrine say what you wanted to
[22:02] say
[22:02] on this subject that the baptism only
[22:04] goes
[22:05] it's the truth you can you
[22:09] you can go to the right side you can go
[22:10] to the left side
[22:12] amen but but i'm just going to read to
[22:14] you just just what brother benham said
[22:16] and there's much more like
[22:17] i'll tell you up front there's much more
[22:19] that he says you can find a lot of
[22:21] quotes
[22:21] i was coming across so many i just had
[22:23] to start removing them there's just
[22:25] too many to read but i just want to
[22:27] share with you
[22:28] what struck my heart as i read it acts
[22:31] chapter 1 verse 8
[22:34] but you shall receive power after that
[22:36] the holy ghost has come upon you
[22:38] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[22:40] in jerusalem
[22:41] and all judea and in samaria unto the
[22:44] uttermost parts of the earth
[22:46] so he said after the holy ghost has come
[22:48] upon you you shall receive power
[22:50] power for what amen you shall re
[22:53] receive power to be his witnesses
[22:57] what did the power come for
[23:00] this is really important the power came
[23:04] so that you could be his witnesses
[23:07] because god knew that peter couldn't do
[23:10] it amen and peter proved that peter
[23:11] couldn't do it
[23:12] on his own he said lord the law forsake
[23:15] you i'll not forsake you i'll be a
[23:16] witness for you
[23:17] but when it came to the trial peter was
[23:19] anything but a witness
[23:22] peter was anywhere but willing to stand
[23:24] with christ and stand on the witness
[23:26] stand for him
[23:27] or stand in the seat of judgment on his
[23:29] behalf peter was gone amen so he knew
[23:31] that the disciples because
[23:33] on the day that he was arrested they all
[23:34] scattered he already knew
[23:36] they were going to need some power to be
[23:38] his witnesses to do
[23:39] what he had called them to do in this
[23:41] life he was going to provide for them
[23:43] he was going to have to provide for them
[23:44] a power to fulfill his will
[23:49] because they didn't have the power in
[23:50] themselves
[23:53] brother bram says in the laodicean
[23:54] church age from 1960 when he's preaching
[23:57] on the church ages
[23:58] he said i offer my prayer for you now as
[24:00] we bow our heads
[24:02] our heavenly father they they are the
[24:04] trophies of your presence they know that
[24:06] these words are true because they are
[24:07] yours
[24:08] they know that they have been given by
[24:10] the holy spirit because they are the
[24:11] word of god
[24:12] and they have been convinced that they
[24:13] need you that they need
[24:15] sweetness of the holy spirit in their
[24:16] life to give them overcoming power
[24:19] and they will receive power from on high
[24:21] receive the power
[24:22] to live a christian life
[24:26] to receive power to overcome temptations
[24:29] see they god was not going to give them
[24:32] power
[24:32] to build a ministry power to make them
[24:36] feel good about themselves
[24:37] power to give them some sort of
[24:39] vindication or fleshly evidence
[24:41] he was giving them power to live a
[24:43] christian life power to be witnesses
[24:47] and that's the purpose of the holy ghost
[24:49] he was giving you the power
[24:50] amen to be a witness so that you could
[24:53] be converted so that you can be
[24:55] regenerated so that the holy ghost could
[24:57] burn the old nature out
[24:58] amen in the seed of life the germ of
[25:00] life that's laying in there can spring
[25:02] the life and take control
[25:03] and be empowered by the holy ghost they
[25:05] meant to live a holy ghost life
[25:07] because he knew your old life couldn't
[25:09] do it and your own nature couldn't do it
[25:13] so brethren saying that they may see
[25:15] power to live a christian life
[25:17] to receive power to overcome temptations
[25:19] as the song we're just saying
[25:20] was just singing they gathered in the
[25:22] upper room and was praying in his name
[25:24] they were baptized with the holy ghost
[25:26] and power for service came
[25:28] that's what they want power for service
[25:31] to come upon them
[25:34] now listen when i was a boy and i was in
[25:37] the pentecostal church
[25:38] i didn't want power for service
[25:42] amen i was scared to death of being lost
[25:44] and i just wanted something to prove
[25:46] that i wasn't lost
[25:48] the just the truth of it i wanted some
[25:51] evidence some token
[25:52] something to prove that i wasn't lost so
[25:54] i would feel more secure
[25:56] amen because the word wasn't enough for
[25:58] me
[26:03] and so and so
[26:06] they were praying brother said that you
[26:08] quoted the song they were in their room
[26:09] praying
[26:10] for uh that they were baptized with the
[26:12] holy ghost and power for service came
[26:14] amen the the real uh
[26:18] the purpose of the baptism holy ghost is
[26:20] to be a witness
[26:22] and they needed power for service
[26:24] because they were all hiding and fearful
[26:27] they weren't being a witness they
[26:29] weren't accomplishing god's purpose they
[26:31] that jesus was sending them but he's
[26:33] going to send them the way the father
[26:35] sent him he was going to go in them go
[26:36] with them
[26:38] but they couldn't do it on their own
[26:40] then they needed something and god knew
[26:41] what they needed and he was going to
[26:42] provide what they needed
[26:43] but they needed power for service
[26:48] and the message desperations 1963
[26:51] said then the life that was in christ is
[26:53] the holy ghost
[26:54] not the third person but the same person
[26:57] and the form of the holy spirit
[26:59] coming upon you as a token that your
[27:01] life and your fair
[27:02] is paid you have been accepted until
[27:05] that token comes you're not permitted on
[27:07] the highway
[27:08] you're not permitted on the bus line
[27:10] you're not permitted to go in until you
[27:12] can present this token
[27:13] and that token is your fare and now it
[27:16] shows that the blood has been shed and
[27:17] been applied to you
[27:18] the price has been applied to you and
[27:20] you have the token that the blood has
[27:22] applied to you
[27:23] and you're accepted get it now now just
[27:26] know certain evidence you say brother
[27:28] branham i feel in your mind you see
[27:30] why why will i know now brother brenham
[27:32] is now talking about this is desperation
[27:34] he preaches token in the morning
[27:36] and i better leave it september 1st 1963
[27:39] and
[27:39] in the evening service he preaches
[27:40] desperation and now he's in the
[27:42] beginning statements
[27:43] of the message desperation and he's
[27:45] referring back to preaching on the token
[27:47] and in the token brother brennan was
[27:48] showing that that you know he was typing
[27:51] it with the exodus journey
[27:52] and how the every house had to take a
[27:54] lamb they had to slay the lamb and take
[27:56] the blood and put it as a token
[27:58] over the door and that the the death
[28:01] angel would come and see that token
[28:03] he would pass over there would be safety
[28:05] knowing there was a lamb slain and the
[28:07] blood was applied
[28:09] and now brother is taking that and he's
[28:10] bringing it today and he's saying now
[28:12] amen there's no longer a chemistry the
[28:14] chemistry of the blood of jesus christ
[28:16] was shed
[28:17] amen in judea and it went into the soil
[28:19] went to the ground
[28:20] amen but it was the life that was in
[28:22] that blood is the token now
[28:24] it has to be on display the same life
[28:27] that was in jesus christ now comes back
[28:29] upon
[28:30] the believer in that life amen can't
[28:33] that can't be a life that's in the
[28:35] bucket the blood can't be in the bucket
[28:37] the blood had to be applied to the
[28:38] outside of the door
[28:39] for all to see and now it can't be a
[28:41] life that i say
[28:42] amen i have the life but it's got to be
[28:44] a life that's on display that's the
[28:46] token
[28:48] but now he comes and he's in desperation
[28:51] now
[28:51] and he's preaching and he says now
[28:55] he said the token is the evidence that
[28:59] the price has been paid the blood has
[29:00] been shed
[29:01] for your redemption for the forgiveness
[29:03] of your sins but the token now is the
[29:05] evidence that that's been applied to you
[29:08] you have the token and now brother brown
[29:10] says now
[29:11] just no certain evidence because brother
[29:12] ben's trying to get away from tongues
[29:14] being the initial evidence
[29:16] so no certain evidence see you say
[29:19] brother branham i feel it in your mind
[29:20] you say
[29:21] why will i know look what you
[29:24] look what you look what were you
[29:28] and what are you there is how you know
[29:33] i said i wanted to make this simple i
[29:35] hope we can make it super simple tonight
[29:38] just taking what the prophet said he's
[29:40] preaching
[29:41] he just preached token now he's
[29:43] preaching desperation and he's pointing
[29:45] back to token
[29:46] amen token was one of the highlight
[29:48] messages of his ministry
[29:50] and so this is a critical message he's
[29:52] preaching and he's saying now
[29:54] this token is your evidence that the
[29:56] blood has been applied to you that your
[29:57] fair has been paid
[29:59] that you are forgiven and you have been
[30:00] redeemed back to god
[30:02] and he says now no certain evidence
[30:05] no certain if he what he's talking about
[30:08] is pentecostal form of evidence and
[30:10] tongues or something like that
[30:11] no certain evidence he said i can feel
[30:13] in your mind you're asking why will i
[30:15] know or how will i know
[30:18] look what were you and what are you
[30:22] there is how you know
[30:26] simple simple see
[30:29] what was you before this token was
[30:31] applied what
[30:33] are you after it's applied what was your
[30:36] desires before
[30:37] and what is your desires after then you
[30:40] know whether the token is applied or not
[30:43] and these other things just
[30:44] automatically go with that amen
[30:46] these other things he's talking about
[30:48] gifts and manifestations of the spirit
[30:50] and all of those things
[30:51] they go with the token but they are not
[30:53] the token
[30:55] so brother benham said you know he made
[30:57] it simple he said if i go buy a shoe
[30:59] amen i get a tongue with the shoe the
[31:01] tongue isn't the shoe the tongue goes
[31:03] with the shoe
[31:05] and he says when you get the token which
[31:06] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[31:08] he said the token amen all these things
[31:10] go with it
[31:14] gifts and manifestations and all kinds
[31:16] of supernatural things they go with it
[31:18] but they're not it amen and he doesn't
[31:20] want us to look for any certain evidence
[31:23] because the spirit divides us severally
[31:25] as he willeth
[31:27] we don't all do all speak with tongues
[31:29] do all prophesy
[31:30] the apostle paul is telling us that the
[31:32] gifts are distributed
[31:34] throughout the body so if we make it one
[31:37] certain evidence and that's not the gift
[31:38] the spirit has given you look out
[31:40] somebody's in and somebody's out
[31:44] so he said what was he said look at what
[31:47] what were you and what are you
[31:49] there's how you know
[31:53] what was you before the token was
[31:55] applied what are you after it's applied
[31:58] what was your desires before and what is
[32:00] your desires after
[32:02] then you know whether the token is
[32:03] applied or not and these other things
[32:05] just automatically go with it
[32:08] in the message paradox from 1963 he says
[32:11] for instance i believe that every
[32:12] born-again member of the body of christ
[32:14] is a paradox in themselves
[32:16] i believe each one of you now listen
[32:18] this is a wonderful statement
[32:21] because we are a paradox to ourselves
[32:24] we wake up every morning and look in the
[32:26] mirror and we find there's our enemy
[32:30] this is the this guy is wrong amen he
[32:33] he he has a hybrid nature he comes in a
[32:37] hybrid
[32:37] form with a spirit of the earth and we
[32:40] look at the man in the mirror
[32:41] and that's our enemy enemy number one
[32:43] amen but down on the inside by the new
[32:46] birth there's another life amen another
[32:48] nature amen
[32:49] it is a portion of the life of god on
[32:51] the inside amen it is christ for this
[32:53] day amen
[32:55] and so we are a paradox within ourselves
[32:57] because sometimes we have mixed messages
[32:59] within ourselves
[33:00] you have an inner man speaking and an
[33:02] outer man speaking
[33:04] so this is what brother branham is
[33:05] addressing he says every born-again
[33:07] member of the body of christ is a
[33:08] paradox in themselves
[33:11] i believe each one of you methodists and
[33:12] presbyterians in lutheran that never had
[33:15] experienced the baptism of the holy
[33:16] spirit was in some formal church that
[33:18] did not believe in the genuine new birth
[33:20] and has now received the baptism of the
[33:22] holy ghost is a perfect example of a
[33:24] paradox
[33:25] because something happened to you that
[33:27] changed your whole being
[33:31] he's coming back to make it simple
[33:34] and anyone can look at that and know
[33:36] what a paradox is a miracle
[33:38] unless that happens you cannot be a
[33:41] christian
[33:44] unless what happens unless something
[33:46] happens to you that changes your whole
[33:48] being
[33:50] unless you can look back and see what
[33:51] you were and what you
[33:53] are what you were before the tokens
[33:55] applying what you are after where your
[33:56] desires were where your desires are now
[33:58] amen and see that there's been a change
[34:00] that takes place amen unless
[34:02] that happens you cannot be a christian
[34:07] that's what he says unless that happens
[34:10] you cannot be a christian
[34:12] there must be a paradox for you to
[34:13] become a christian because no one can
[34:15] change a spirit in a man
[34:17] and give him a new birth outside of god
[34:19] god alone is the only one can do it
[34:21] and it's a miracle how that god can take
[34:23] a man's thinking
[34:24] and his ways and his life and everything
[34:27] and change it from what it was
[34:29] to what it can be what he can make it
[34:32] so when brother enemy he keeps pointing
[34:34] to the same thing i got many more
[34:36] scriptures to read and many more we
[34:37] could read but brother venom is super
[34:39] clear he's laying this down
[34:41] amen that the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:43] is something that changes you you
[34:44] changes your whole being
[34:46] amen it's a change
[34:49] let's go to the book of ephesians and
[34:52] look at ephesians chapter 2.
[35:06] ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1
[35:12] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[35:14] in trespasses and sins
[35:16] quickened made alive you at the quicken
[35:18] who were dead you were dead in
[35:20] trespasses and sin you were breathing in
[35:22] and out and you were walking around and
[35:23] eating and doing that
[35:24] but there was something inside of you a
[35:26] life on the inside that was dead
[35:28] that was as though it was dead and you
[35:30] and you had the quicken who were dead in
[35:32] trespasses and sins and where and in
[35:34] time past you walked according to the
[35:35] courts of this world
[35:37] according to the prince of the power of
[35:38] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[35:40] the children of disobedience
[35:42] among whom we also we all had our
[35:44] conversation in times past
[35:46] and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the
[35:47] desire of the flesh and of the mind and
[35:49] we're by nature the children of wrath
[35:51] even as others
[35:53] paul is not saying you're still that way
[35:56] paul is saying this is how you were but
[35:59] something's changed
[36:01] you had the lust of the flesh amen you
[36:03] were walking the same way the world was
[36:05] walking you had the same desires the
[36:07] world had
[36:07] you wanted the same things they wanted
[36:09] and you were caught up in the same
[36:10] things they were caught up in
[36:11] but something changed inside of you
[36:14] something brother man says through all
[36:16] your being heavenward amen you started
[36:19] loving the lord and wanting nothing but
[36:20] to please the lord the outside man could
[36:22] still fall of course
[36:23] the outside man could still have wrong
[36:25] desires but something down on the core
[36:26] of you
[36:27] changed it shifted and all your love and
[36:29] affection went to him
[36:32] no longer for the world or the things of
[36:33] the world are self or the desires of the
[36:35] flesh
[36:36] but something at the core of who you are
[36:38] amen in your soul shifted
[36:40] and turned heavenward
[36:44] what brother ben says and this he says
[36:46] the same thing in
[36:47] in the message it is the rising of the
[36:49] sun and now you see now you're already
[36:53] you were dead and sin trespasses but
[36:55] you've been resurrected
[36:57] now you're already resurrected when god
[36:59] raised him up he raised you
[37:01] the son is just now on you and now
[37:03] you're growing into a blossom life like
[37:04] he was to be resurrected completely in
[37:07] the last day
[37:08] your potentials you have now why do you
[37:11] know
[37:12] basically how do you know your soul
[37:14] changed
[37:15] didn't it something deep inside
[37:18] changed amen you've undergone a change
[37:21] your body came in obedience to it didn't
[37:24] it and obedience to what a church
[37:26] the word which is the life amen then you
[37:29] are now resurrected from the dead it is
[37:31] easter with jesus and i it's easter with
[37:33] you and jesus
[37:34] it's easter with you and i in jesus we
[37:36] are all our jesus you and i we are all
[37:39] resurrected together amen resurrected
[37:42] what to newness of life
[37:43] amen something was laying there amen it
[37:46] was shrouded over by darkness amen but
[37:48] there was a seed down
[37:49] under all the waters and all the
[37:51] darkness and that seed had come from god
[37:53] and it was waiting for the word to come
[37:55] to the word for life to come to life
[37:57] amen and under the baptism holy ghost it
[37:59] was quickened that seed was quickened
[38:01] alive
[38:01] and down on the core of who you are it
[38:04] changed
[38:07] some of the complicated part in our life
[38:09] is that the outside didn't change
[38:12] the inside changed and as the inside
[38:15] grew stronger it began to take
[38:16] possession of the outside man and force
[38:19] the outside man into obedience to the
[38:21] word
[38:21] but the outside man hasn't yet changed
[38:25] but the inside man who grew and has
[38:27] grown
[38:28] in the knowledge of jesus christ and
[38:30] grown stronger he more and more
[38:32] takes reign amen possessing his vessel
[38:35] and pulling the outer man into obedience
[38:37] to the inner man
[38:39] that's the paradox that's what's
[38:41] complicated because we received the
[38:43] baptism the holy ghost something changed
[38:45] all our desires went heavenward now we
[38:47] love him we don't love the world we hate
[38:49] the things of the world
[38:50] we hate what we are we hate what we were
[38:52] amen we want nothing more than to please
[38:54] him but we still find ourselves
[38:56] falling because of the old sticky caulk
[38:58] of our nature on the outside
[38:59] amen and then with a pentecostal
[39:01] doctrine that says if you fall then you
[39:02] didn't have it
[39:11] amen because if we have to take that
[39:13] mentality
[39:15] the holy ghost don't lie so brother
[39:18] branham wouldn't have had it
[39:20] when he told his wife to lie to the
[39:21] lawyer
[39:25] i'm so glad god had a wave sheets
[39:29] to show us so that we would know not
[39:31] just in the words but in the
[39:33] demonstration of a life lived
[39:34] that we would see
[39:38] the change is in the soul
[39:41] the core of who we are the essence of
[39:43] who we are the inner man the real
[39:45] us it changed
[39:48] this outside man is going to have to
[39:50] change
[39:52] to match the nature of the inside man
[39:55] but until
[39:56] then we will wrestle it into subjection
[39:59] because the inside man wants to wrestle
[40:02] it into subjection
[40:07] in the stature of a perfect man brother
[40:09] banham says well now that's the way it
[40:11] is
[40:12] trying to manufacture christianity you
[40:14] can't do it
[40:15] the first thing you've got to do is be
[40:17] born again you've got to be changed
[40:20] so you can't this isn't reformation you
[40:22] can't pretend you can't
[40:24] brother says you can't put peacock
[40:26] feathers in a crow it's not going to
[40:27] work
[40:28] you can't this is the problem with some
[40:30] of the holiness movements amen
[40:32] when it was in the days of the methodist
[40:34] movement where all the holiness movement
[40:35] started
[40:36] and the wesleyan revival it was a
[40:38] genuine revival of the holy ghost
[40:40] moving them amen to sanctification to
[40:43] line their lives up with the word
[40:45] but when they refused to move with the
[40:47] light when the light moved amen
[40:50] now in order to maintain sanctification
[40:52] because it's not
[40:53] anymore amen they're not any more under
[40:56] the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[40:58] because the light has moved on
[40:59] now they had to establish rules and
[41:01] parameters
[41:02] and you know style of dress and length
[41:04] of dress and fabric you can use in
[41:06] certain colors and
[41:07] certain types of
[41:11] why because they believed what god had
[41:12] done and they were trying to hold on to
[41:14] it amen
[41:14] but sanctification moves right along
[41:17] with the pillar of fire amen
[41:19] when the pillar of fire moves they meant
[41:20] sanctification moves with it amen
[41:27] and so now we tried to
[41:30] manufacture christianity but you can't
[41:32] do it
[41:34] we live in a day where they've so failed
[41:36] at manufacturing christianity
[41:38] they just decided to water down
[41:40] christianity
[41:41] because they couldn't even manufacture
[41:43] it anymore so the denominations have so
[41:46] watered it down they've
[41:47] changed the definition of what it means
[41:49] to be a christian
[41:52] it used to mean if you were a christian
[41:54] amen you were also holy
[41:56] but now they've changed the definition
[41:58] you can be a christian and not be holy
[42:03] praise god but there's a people on the
[42:05] earth amen that can be real christians
[42:07] by a new birth amen
[42:09] but you can't manufacture you can't do
[42:11] it the first thing you've got to do is
[42:12] be born again
[42:13] you've got to be changed and when you're
[42:15] changed you become a new creation
[42:17] now you're getting right now now you
[42:19] don't have to worry about the feathers
[42:21] it'll take care of itself you don't have
[42:24] to worry about
[42:25] peacock feathers and a crow and all this
[42:27] you just let the nature on the inside
[42:29] change
[42:29] and let that life live and you'll have
[42:31] the right feathers on the outside
[42:33] you don't brother that said you don't
[42:34] have to worry about it amen
[42:37] sheep don't have to manufacture wool
[42:39] sheep bear wool it's a natural
[42:41] outcropping of sheep
[42:45] so we were living life like a goat but
[42:46] down on the inside was a true sheep
[42:48] nature amen
[42:49] in the baptist holy ghost amen awaken
[42:51] the sheep then the sheep will produce
[42:53] wool
[42:54] and he doesn't have to think about it
[42:56] all he has to do
[42:58] is feed
[43:01] [Music]
[43:04] now you don't have to worry about the
[43:05] feathers it'll take care of itself when
[43:06] you're born again
[43:07] yes sir like i've always said you take a
[43:10] hog scrub him up and put a
[43:12] a tuxedo suit rather on him and turn him
[43:14] out there
[43:15] he'll go right to the mud and a hole and
[43:17] wallow because you see
[43:18] he wouldn't do any good he's a hog
[43:20] that's his nature wallow is his nature
[43:22] you've got to change his nature
[43:25] and the rest of it will take care of
[43:26] itself
[43:29] you notice you must be born again that
[43:31] is changed
[43:33] there's got to be a change whether
[43:36] it's making this so clear something on
[43:38] the inside has to
[43:40] change that's the new birth that's the
[43:42] quickening of the seed that's the
[43:43] baptism only goes something inside has
[43:45] got to change
[43:47] then everything else will come right he
[43:50] said
[43:50] i love the simplicity of you take a hog
[43:54] and you wash him out and you decorate
[43:56] him and you put nice clothes on him
[43:57] where will the hulk go you pluck
[43:59] somebody out of the world amen
[44:01] and you tell them all the code and
[44:02] conduct of living a christian life
[44:04] and why and explain it all amen when
[44:06] they get away from you
[44:08] and get out of the pen they will go
[44:10] right back to harlotry and prostitution
[44:12] and drug addiction and drinking
[44:14] why because there's nothing changed on
[44:16] the inside yet
[44:18] and it doesn't matter how much they want
[44:20] to live a different life
[44:22] because people who have lived a hog life
[44:24] and suffered under it amen have come to
[44:26] the terms with the fact i don't want to
[44:27] live this way anymore it's hurting me
[44:31] but if all we have to give them is a
[44:33] government and a
[44:34] code and a rule and and all the
[44:36] scriptural reasons on why
[44:37] you don't do this and you do do this and
[44:39] you don't do this and you do do this
[44:41] amen at some point they're going to get
[44:43] near
[44:45] a hog wallow
[44:50] because you can't keep them from it the
[44:52] world is full of it
[44:54] the world is is polluted this is satan's
[44:57] eden you can't keep people from it
[44:58] so it can't just be an explanation of
[45:01] why
[45:02] why the word says this and why this and
[45:04] you don't want to live that way anymore
[45:05] do you know i don't want to live that
[45:06] way anymore well if you don't want to
[45:08] live that way anymore all you have to do
[45:09] is this and do this and do this
[45:10] i'm telling you friends that's
[45:12] reformation that will not work
[45:14] the only thing that will work is
[45:15] transformation
[45:17] something has to change on the inside
[45:20] amen
[45:20] and then when that hog nature changed to
[45:22] a sheep nature it won't go to the wallow
[45:28] and if you find a sheep in a wallow i
[45:30] would say he slipped and fell
[45:31] in he didn't want to be there
[45:35] do you understand what i'm saying you
[45:36] take a sheep nature and he gets too
[45:38] close to a wallow and a trap set for him
[45:40] brother man said there's traps set for
[45:41] you and you're going to fall into them
[45:43] and then you find a sheep and a wallow
[45:45] i'm i rest assured he doesn't want to be
[45:48] there
[45:48] and he did not get there and then
[45:50] intentionally something happened
[45:55] hey amen i love the simplicity of it
[46:00] the problem is when the sheep's turned
[46:01] loose and he runs right back to it that
[46:03] ain't no sheep
[46:04] that's a hog with a sheep fleece stapled
[46:06] to it
[46:11] needs a change
[46:15] now i want to read this is a little bit
[46:17] of a lengthy reading but hang with me
[46:18] because it's so
[46:19] good brother branham has a private
[46:22] interview just before he preaches the
[46:23] masterpiece in 1964
[46:25] and that private interview was with a
[46:27] sister george bruce
[46:29] many of you know this but i'm going to
[46:30] read it just so you can see
[46:32] i want you to see how brother branham
[46:34] deals with a sheep
[46:38] at the beginning it just tells you that
[46:40] this was recorded during the song
[46:42] service of the message masterpiece he's
[46:44] in his office
[46:45] during the song service speaking to
[46:46] sister george bruce
[46:49] and then brother man begins to say i
[46:50] visited you in the hospital that time
[46:51] and i prayed
[46:52] constantly god wouldn't let you die
[46:54] because you're of value to the church
[46:56] now i know you i know you're going to be
[46:58] all right sister bruce she was having
[46:59] heart problems
[47:00] i believe that with all my heart see and
[47:03] then sister george bruce says brother
[47:05] branham
[47:05] most of all i want the experience that
[47:08] that i've been sealed
[47:09] in the holy ghost and if god will reveal
[47:11] it to your heart
[47:13] she wants the experience she wants to
[47:15] know that she's sealed with the holy
[47:17] ghost
[47:17] this is how brother branham responds to
[47:19] the sister
[47:21] he says i believe with all my heart that
[47:23] you are a real born-again believer
[47:27] he didn't ask her did you speak with
[47:29] tongues
[47:30] did you have this sensation he looked at
[47:32] him and said i believe
[47:34] you're a real born-again believer sister
[47:35] bruce how could that spirit just leave
[47:39] now listen he's going to explain to her
[47:42] why she's struggling
[47:43] listen close when you get sick you get
[47:47] weary
[47:49] this is outer realm stuff outer moon
[47:52] when you get sick you get weary and
[47:54] you're a nervous type person
[47:56] sister bruce says yes see and you get
[48:00] things on your mind see little bitty
[48:02] things it just keeps building up both
[48:03] ways
[48:04] you'll get somebody on your heart and
[48:05] you want to pray for them and get up and
[48:07] pray for it
[48:08] you can't rest till you get that person
[48:09] prayed for that's you
[48:11] then take on the other side satan maybe
[48:14] might present something to you
[48:16] and out this away in in your nature
[48:20] and god works and satan works then when
[48:21] satan tries to make you believe that
[48:23] you're not
[48:24] see you keep building this and maybe
[48:26] this and this
[48:27] don't look at yourself sister bruce
[48:31] brother what he's saying is the reason
[48:34] you're struggling and you have
[48:35] doubts about whether you've been born
[48:36] again he says i believe you're a real
[48:38] born-again believer
[48:40] the problem just is you get sick and you
[48:42] get weary
[48:43] and you're a nervous nature person
[48:45] anyways
[48:46] and if you get a little bitty thing on
[48:48] your mind you just can't rest until
[48:50] if it's to pray for something you can't
[48:51] rest until you pray but when satan gives
[48:53] you a thought
[48:54] amen you just begin to build on that and
[48:56] fixate upon it
[48:58] this is what brother brown is explaining
[48:59] to her he's explaining to her why
[49:01] she's struggling but he's not trying
[49:03] he's not
[49:04] trying to tell her how to get the
[49:05] baptism only goes he believes she
[49:07] already has it
[49:09] he believes it's just that outer realm
[49:10] that's messing with her because she's a
[49:12] nervous type person
[49:13] and she's sick with a heart condition
[49:15] amen and she's got this nervous
[49:16] condition where she
[49:17] she has problems amen fixating on
[49:19] thoughts and she can't rest until she
[49:21] accomplishes the deed
[49:23] and when the devil gives her thoughts
[49:24] little worries and little uh
[49:26] doubts make her doubt what she is then
[49:28] she just mulls it over and over and over
[49:31] i say she's not the only one there's
[49:34] people here
[49:35] amen that do the same thing
[49:39] now he says he said now i'm fixing to
[49:42] pray for you
[49:42] i'm not worthy of that now he just told
[49:45] her don't look at yourself sister bruce
[49:47] this is an important statement don't
[49:48] look at yourself
[49:51] i'm fixing to pray for you i'm not
[49:53] worthy of that i think what would i do
[49:55] if jesus was sitting here now
[49:56] and what would he do if he was sitting
[49:58] here he'd lay hands upon you with his
[49:59] great faith see
[50:01] you'd get well well i think well
[50:04] i'm a sinner i'm not him but i come to
[50:08] represent him
[50:09] but remember me being a sinner and
[50:11] before god i'm not a sinner neither
[50:13] are you
[50:18] before god he said before god i'm not a
[50:20] sinner and neither are you
[50:25] we got a blood sacrifice laying there
[50:27] god don't even see us
[50:30] he hears our voice but he sees the blood
[50:32] of christ that's it
[50:33] he sees the blood of his own son it's
[50:35] our voice
[50:36] christ's blood then it's christ that's
[50:39] talking through us
[50:40] to god oh friends
[50:43] catch that talk about a sanctifying
[50:46] power in the blood
[50:48] to so cleanse you from you that you
[50:50] begin to pray
[50:51] amen by the anointing of the holy ghost
[50:53] you begin to pray through the blood it's
[50:55] not you anymore it's christ
[50:56] praying to god
[51:00] we just don't see ourselves right
[51:05] then it's christ that's talking through
[51:06] us to god so therefore we're not sinners
[51:08] no more
[51:09] we're christian i believe you to be a
[51:11] genuine christian woman
[51:13] i remember the thing and sister bruce
[51:15] says i make so many mistakes and i fail
[51:18] so many times oh
[51:22] praise god i'm so glad this was recorded
[51:25] friends i'm so glad god
[51:26] god gave this to us amen this is a gift
[51:29] that he has given to us
[51:30] sister bruce went through what she went
[51:32] through so that you and i
[51:33] would have the truth today
[51:36] because these are the same things we go
[51:38] through men we get nervous we get upset
[51:40] the devil begins to put doubts in our
[51:42] mind we fixate on and begin to wonder
[51:43] well was i mistaken did i really have
[51:45] what i thought i have and and now and
[51:47] then all of a sudden i'm making mistakes
[51:48] and brother brown's trying to get her to
[51:50] doc
[51:50] don't look at yourself amen there's one
[51:52] thing we're supposed to look at
[51:54] and this thing is simple it's
[51:55] straightforward amen you believe god
[51:57] you're pricked in the heart amen you
[51:59] repent you're baptized in his name
[52:01] and you shall receive the gift of the
[52:02] holy ghost the bible is not complicated
[52:07] we're not supposed to look at ourselves
[52:08] we're supposed to look at what the word
[52:09] says
[52:10] brother is trying to point her to the
[52:12] word and to the sacrifice that she has
[52:14] and she said i make so many mistakes and
[52:17] i failed so many times
[52:20] brother says that's why christ had to
[52:22] die so that you with your mistakes
[52:24] wouldn't be lauded to you
[52:27] he will not impute sin blessed is the
[52:30] man whom god will not impute sin
[52:33] brother branham's saying they're not
[52:35] allotted to you
[52:37] he took your mistakes your desires in
[52:39] your heart is to serve him
[52:41] sister bruce says yes your desire in
[52:43] your heart is to serve him she says yes
[52:46] all right that's what he died for so you
[52:49] could serve him
[52:50] your mistakes are not looked not lauded
[52:52] to you see
[52:53] he is your propitiation he is your sin
[52:55] offering
[52:56] your sins are not known you're not a
[52:58] sinner before god
[53:00] christ took your sins and become you
[53:02] because your desire
[53:03] is to serve him
[53:07] is this complicated it's not complicated
[53:11] sister bruce says but i've never had an
[53:14] experience that i've been filled the
[53:15] holy goat
[53:16] listen listen careful but i've never had
[53:19] an
[53:19] experience that i have been filled with
[53:22] the holy ghost that i could put my foot
[53:26] on
[53:30] you know what that poor woman went
[53:33] through a lot but there's going to be
[53:34] some day i'm going to shake her hand and
[53:35] thank god
[53:37] thank her for enduring what she went
[53:38] through so that i would have the truth
[53:40] on these things
[53:41] so that i would see how a prophet deals
[53:43] with these things amen
[53:44] and now he instructs her in
[53:45] righteousness but i've never had an
[53:47] experience that i've been
[53:49] filled with the holy ghost that i can
[53:50] put my foot on all right notice this
[53:54] brother man's gonna he's gonna fix this
[53:57] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[54:00] being is born in sin
[54:01] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[54:02] speaking lies that's the nature of human
[54:05] being
[54:05] sister bruce says yes that was your
[54:08] nature
[54:09] it changed once but what changed it
[54:12] she says christ there you are sister
[54:14] that's it
[54:20] what's complicated about that amen the
[54:22] holy ghost is for you receive it amen
[54:25] say god i receive it you promised me
[54:27] that gift i've done
[54:28] everything you asked me to do amen you
[54:30] provided the faith to believe your word
[54:32] you're the one who pricked me in the
[54:33] heart
[54:34] and i cried out what should i do you
[54:36] said repent i've repented lord
[54:38] you said be baptized in your name i've
[54:39] been baptized in your name and you told
[54:41] me i
[54:42] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[54:44] and i'm here lord
[54:45] receiving your gift
[54:46] [Music]
[54:50] because that's what the word says amen
[54:53] and when that gift comes to you it will
[54:55] change you
[54:56] your soul will change amen it's not just
[54:59] saying well i accept it i believe it
[55:00] those are words words don't mean
[55:02] anything
[55:02] but there has to be an experience amen
[55:04] brother branham was clear on that you
[55:06] have to have the experience of the new
[55:08] birth i mean we don't go back to
[55:10] preaching a baptist doctrine of you
[55:12] you receive the holy ghost when you
[55:13] believe brother branham was dead set
[55:15] against that because there's a lot of
[55:17] intellectual faith saying i believe
[55:19] now saying that i've got the holy ghost
[55:21] because i believe
[55:23] but he said you've got to have an
[55:24] experience there must be an experience
[55:27] of the baptism the holy ghost but he
[55:28] never attached it to
[55:30] any fleshly emotional evidence or
[55:32] sensation
[55:33] he said what is the experience brother
[55:35] brennan makes it clear
[55:37] the experience is a changed life
[55:40] that is the experience that you went
[55:42] through the experience of i was one way
[55:44] and now i'm
[55:44] different and i didn't change myself it
[55:47] wasn't alcoholics anonymous it wasn't a
[55:49] self-help book amen
[55:50] it wasn't willpower it wasn't turning a
[55:52] new leaf at the new year
[55:54] none of that worked amen but there was a
[55:56] supernatural power
[55:57] that changed me from the inside what is
[56:00] that
[56:01] amen that's the experience amen of the
[56:04] baptism of the holy ghost of the new
[56:06] birth
[56:07] and that's what brother bam said you
[56:09] have to have
[56:11] it can't just be a mental
[56:12] acknowledgement and a verbal declaration
[56:14] but you have to have that experience
[56:16] you have to change your desires have to
[56:19] change your thinking has to change your
[56:21] loves have to change
[56:26] oh i'm going to read that one more time
[56:29] is it okay
[56:31] i want it ingrained in our brains so the
[56:33] next time that the devil comes around
[56:34] when we're weary and tired and nervous
[56:36] and upset
[56:36] and plants thoughts on our mind we can
[56:38] come right back to this
[56:42] she says but i've never had an
[56:43] experience that i've been filled the
[56:44] holy ghost that i could put my foot on
[56:49] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[56:50] being is born in sin
[56:52] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[56:53] speaking lies that's the nature of a
[56:55] human being
[56:56] she says yes that was your nature
[57:00] that was your nature it was my nature
[57:04] it changed once but what changed it she
[57:07] says
[57:08] christ there you are sister that's it
[57:12] there's the experience you can put your
[57:14] foot on
[57:16] that i didn't change myself he changed
[57:19] me man and no matter how many times this
[57:21] outer man trips me up in this world
[57:22] amen tries to trap me and there's traps
[57:24] laid for me and i fall into them
[57:26] it doesn't matter something in me has
[57:28] changed drastically changed
[57:29] the things i loved i don't love i hate
[57:32] the things i used to love
[57:33] and now i love the things i tried to
[57:38] avoid
[57:40] now brother man goes on to say he that
[57:42] heareth my words and believeth on him
[57:43] that sent me hath
[57:44] eternal life and shall not come to the
[57:47] judgment but half
[57:48] past tense pass from death to life saint
[57:51] john 5 24
[57:52] jesus speaking see so you
[57:55] you're a christian sister bruce i've
[57:57] watched your life
[57:58] i've watched you under vision and i know
[58:01] you're a christian
[58:02] brother branham is not just petting this
[58:04] woman and getting her out of his office
[58:06] he said i've watched you by vision
[58:11] i've watched you under vision and i know
[58:13] you're a christian
[58:14] not one spec see i am your shepherd as
[58:16] it was
[58:17] sister bruce says yes somebody to help
[58:20] and if there was any doubt in my mind if
[58:22] i thought you was something was wrong
[58:24] i tell you sister bruce she says i
[58:26] believe that
[58:27] but if there's anything wrong in your
[58:29] experience anything wrong between you
[58:31] and god as far as i know anything about
[58:33] it sister bruce there's not
[58:34] a thing there's not one thing
[58:40] she comes to the prophet the prophet the
[58:41] gift of discernment has watched her life
[58:43] and watched it under vision
[58:44] and he says as far as i know there's not
[58:46] one thing wrong
[58:47] and she was convinced something was
[58:49] wrong
[58:50] because she was looking at herself she
[58:52] was listening to the devil
[58:54] she was looking at her mistakes and she
[58:56] said i don't have any particular
[58:58] experience that i can put my foot on
[58:59] and brother branham takes her back to
[59:01] the true experience
[59:02] that she can put her foot on and tells
[59:05] her not to look at herself or a mistake
[59:06] there's a sacrifice there
[59:09] and he dispels the whole thing
[59:13] and it wasn't complicated it was simple
[59:18] it wasn't a carrot on a stick it wasn't
[59:20] to say well when you get the baptism
[59:21] holy ghost you don't have to worry about
[59:22] the mistakes no more you won't have them
[59:25] he didn't say that
[59:29] he just told her that's what the blood's
[59:30] for
[59:32] your mistakes are not allotted to you
[59:33] you're not even a sinner before god
[59:37] amen can you believe that for yourself
[59:40] friends or does it only apply to sister
[59:42] bruce amen
[59:43] but i say it's on tape and it's for me
[59:48] brother brahm says in satan's eden i
[59:50] heard brother neville say this morning
[59:52] someone might have been asking him why
[59:54] didn't i preach on the holy ghost
[59:56] why didn't i do this here it is
[1:00:00] the holy ghost is the action in you
[1:00:04] it's a life not an emotion not some sort
[1:00:08] of fleshly evidence
[1:00:09] but it's a person jesus christ the word
[1:00:11] of god
[1:00:12] established in your heart to quicken
[1:00:14] every word of this age
[1:00:16] right watch the holy ghost in action not
[1:00:19] so much in demonstration but in action
[1:00:22] what it does according to the word
[1:00:25] because the holy ghost will lead and
[1:00:27] guide you into all truth you'll believe
[1:00:28] the word you'll receive the word you'll
[1:00:30] act upon the word amen
[1:00:32] you believe god amen you if god says
[1:00:34] dress this way you'll believe it amen
[1:00:36] you'll act upon it why because it's a
[1:00:38] power that's given to you to live a
[1:00:40] christian life
[1:00:41] it's a power that's given you to be a
[1:00:42] witness amen when the disciples the
[1:00:44] disciples believed in jesus christ
[1:00:48] they believed in the resurrection of
[1:00:49] jesus christ
[1:00:51] they had seen him amen thomas had
[1:00:52] handled him with his hands
[1:00:54] and then they had they had met him on a
[1:00:55] couple of occasions they had fed him
[1:00:57] broiled fish and honey he had cooked
[1:00:59] them dinner
[1:01:00] by this by the sea of tiberias amen they
[1:01:02] they believed that he was resurrected
[1:01:04] from the dead they believed that jesus
[1:01:06] christ was the son of god
[1:01:08] but they still needed something to give
[1:01:10] them the power to be his witness
[1:01:13] they needed to be converted they needed
[1:01:15] the baptism for the holy ghost
[1:01:18] and god knew what they would need so he
[1:01:20] provided it
[1:01:21] for them as a
[1:01:25] gift
[1:01:30] if he had made it anything else we would
[1:01:31] be troubled friends
[1:01:33] but he made it a gift and he told us to
[1:01:37] receive it
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:41] says in the token from 1964
[1:01:45] this is the one he preaches in march
[1:01:47] 1964 he says we realize
[1:01:50] and then he gave them a token for the
[1:01:52] assurance
[1:01:53] that they wouldn't have to be scared all
[1:01:56] upset and nervous
[1:02:01] he's referring back to the
[1:02:04] exodus journey into the passover night
[1:02:07] and he said he gave them a token
[1:02:10] and if they would just apply the token
[1:02:12] in faith
[1:02:13] that they wouldn't have to be scared
[1:02:15] upset
[1:02:16] and nervous
[1:02:20] see sister bruce was scared upset and
[1:02:23] nervous but brother brandon was bringing
[1:02:24] her back to her token
[1:02:27] she had a positive token she had a true
[1:02:30] token and he was telling her you got a
[1:02:31] true token you've got a positive token
[1:02:33] you have to have faith in that token
[1:02:37] they were giving a token for assurance
[1:02:40] that they wouldn't have to be scared or
[1:02:42] upset and nervous where he said
[1:02:44] when i see the token i'll pass over you
[1:02:47] watch how he did now
[1:02:48] he prepared first to sign a messenger
[1:02:50] identified message identification of the
[1:02:52] messenger
[1:02:53] and a token for the assurance that the
[1:02:55] way was paid
[1:02:57] they are headed for the promised land
[1:02:59] the same thing he has done today what
[1:03:01] did he do
[1:03:02] he went he sent us the holy ghost the
[1:03:04] holy ghost is the messenger
[1:03:05] and the scripture identification of
[1:03:07] himself identifies him among us the same
[1:03:10] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:12] and the token is the assurance what are
[1:03:15] you scared about
[1:03:19] our fare is already paid and we are
[1:03:21] identified with our sacrifice
[1:03:23] he can't turn you down he promised that
[1:03:25] we're identified
[1:03:28] see the token was given for an assurance
[1:03:33] but so many times in my thinking the
[1:03:35] token was anything but assurance it was
[1:03:37] fear it was dread
[1:03:38] it was it was the carrot on the end of
[1:03:40] the stick it was the fear if you
[1:03:42] if you don't get this you can't make the
[1:03:43] rapture
[1:03:47] if you don't go get this and if you
[1:03:48] don't get that you can't make the
[1:03:49] rapture and all of a sudden you know
[1:03:51] all of a sudden the assurance of the
[1:03:53] token is taken away
[1:03:58] but that's not why god gave a token he
[1:04:01] gave you the token
[1:04:02] as a seal of your destination so that
[1:04:05] you can relax and know that the earnest
[1:04:07] money has been paid
[1:04:08] you're coming to the fullness of
[1:04:09] redemption he gave you the token which
[1:04:12] brother bam tells us what the token is
[1:04:13] what is the token
[1:04:14] it's his life in you amen that's the
[1:04:17] token
[1:04:17] and it must be on display
[1:04:22] and that is for assurance not for fear
[1:04:24] amen that is so we can relax
[1:04:26] not so that we can get upset that is so
[1:04:27] that we can be sure
[1:04:29] that the way is paid the earnest money
[1:04:31] is down it's secure
[1:04:32] amen the blood has been applied
[1:04:34] everything is under the blood
[1:04:35] amen the destination is sure and secure
[1:04:38] everything is fine
[1:04:41] the boxcar is sealed amen it won't be
[1:04:43] unsealed until it makes its destination
[1:04:46] and how do you know amen what
[1:04:47] manifestation did you have
[1:04:49] what sensation did you have amen i don't
[1:04:51] know i'm not going to tell you my
[1:04:53] experience my
[1:04:54] sensation or my emotion but i'll tell
[1:04:56] you my experience
[1:04:59] my experience was there were things in
[1:05:01] my life i couldn't overcome there was
[1:05:03] things i hated there was things that
[1:05:04] cost me personally there was things that
[1:05:06] made my life difficult
[1:05:08] but just like a hog to its wallow no
[1:05:10] matter how much i turned over a new leaf
[1:05:12] or made a resolution or didn't want to
[1:05:13] do that
[1:05:14] i was like the hog right back in the
[1:05:15] wallow until something in me changed
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] and now i don't want that there's
[1:05:20] nothing in me that wants that i want to
[1:05:22] stay as far away from the wallow as i
[1:05:24] can get amen
[1:05:26] what was it it wasn't my willpower it
[1:05:29] failed amen it wasn't
[1:05:30] a new year's resolution it failed it
[1:05:32] wasn't a buddy system it failed
[1:05:34] it was the power of almighty god coming
[1:05:36] in to quicken a seed on the inside
[1:05:39] and now all my desires i had selfish
[1:05:42] desires and fleshly desires and worldly
[1:05:44] desires
[1:05:46] but they all turned heavenward and now
[1:05:49] my greatest
[1:05:50] desire from the depths of my soul was to
[1:05:52] serve him to love him to be one with him
[1:05:54] and i didn't make it happen it just
[1:05:56] happened
[1:05:57] it's not a pretend it's not a put on
[1:05:59] it's not words amen it's something down
[1:06:01] in the core of me
[1:06:02] all i want is him amen i want to please
[1:06:05] him i want to be with him i want to talk
[1:06:07] to him
[1:06:10] it doesn't mean i always spend the right
[1:06:12] amount of time and devotion it doesn't
[1:06:13] mean i always pray like i should it
[1:06:15] doesn't mean i'm always faithful but
[1:06:17] down inside the desire has never left
[1:06:19] it's never went away all i want is him
[1:06:22] all i love is him
[1:06:24] all my desire is to my bridegroom what
[1:06:26] is that that's the evidence i can put my
[1:06:28] foot on because i didn't do it
[1:06:30] he did it in me i didn't make it happen
[1:06:34] i played church i grew up playing church
[1:06:36] i grew up pretending to be a christian
[1:06:40] but no matter how much i raised my hand
[1:06:42] in church and no matter how much i went
[1:06:44] to all the meetings
[1:06:45] i mean i couldn't change the desire for
[1:06:47] sin on the inside
[1:06:51] so i won't tell you all the things that
[1:06:54] god did and the way he spoke and
[1:06:56] the sensations and all the personal
[1:06:58] things he did for me because i don't
[1:07:00] want you to ever feel like you've got to
[1:07:01] do that same thing or god will deal with
[1:07:03] you the same way
[1:07:05] but i'll share with you the same thing
[1:07:07] you can have and that's an experience of
[1:07:09] a change in the soul
[1:07:10] a new birth experience and you must have
[1:07:14] it amen
[1:07:15] brother bannon said the fundamentals go
[1:07:16] by believing i receive the holy ghost
[1:07:18] when i believe the pentecostals go by
[1:07:20] amen emotion and experience
[1:07:25] but brother brethren was able to pierce
[1:07:26] it right down the middle
[1:07:28] but you have to have an experience of a
[1:07:30] new birth a change
[1:07:32] in the soul our youth everybody you got
[1:07:36] to have an experience of a change
[1:07:39] amen you're born amen you may have been
[1:07:41] born into a message family you may have
[1:07:43] been raised up amen
[1:07:44] believing the truth amen there's nothing
[1:07:46] wrong with that but there's still an old
[1:07:48] nature on the inside no matter how much
[1:07:49] you want to be a christian and love god
[1:07:51] and serve god amen there's something in
[1:07:52] you keeps pulling you to sin
[1:07:54] and pulling you the wrong thoughts and
[1:07:56] wrong desires and
[1:08:00] but you need to cry out to god and say
[1:08:01] god i'll receive that holy ghost
[1:08:04] if it's a gift it's a gift for me i've
[1:08:05] done everything you said to do
[1:08:07] and i need that gift to change me amen
[1:08:10] to
[1:08:11] to take my whole heart and set it on you
[1:08:15] you can't do it yourself i don't know
[1:08:18] many of you can probably testify of your
[1:08:21] of your days in the reformation
[1:08:24] and how tired you were in the
[1:08:26] reformation
[1:08:27] and how exhausted you were in the
[1:08:29] reformation
[1:08:30] because you can never get it right
[1:08:33] but i'll tell you amen there's a change
[1:08:36] that comes in experience of the baptism
[1:08:37] holy ghost
[1:08:38] where i still don't get it right but
[1:08:40] something in me has changed and will
[1:08:41] never change back
[1:08:43] something has shifted amen something has
[1:08:45] turned towards heaven towards our god
[1:08:47] and it's not turned back and i still
[1:08:50] don't always get it right amen but
[1:08:51] something's right on the inside
[1:08:54] and it wasn't something i did it was
[1:08:56] something he did
[1:09:00] by grace not by works not by
[1:09:03] effort not by a certain meeting not by a
[1:09:05] certain word not by a certain action but
[1:09:07] by grace
[1:09:13] praise god
[1:09:17] brother brahm says
[1:09:21] in desperations so now in the same thing
[1:09:24] about this token
[1:09:26] the token we have talked to we have
[1:09:28] talked to the token
[1:09:30] all along the way but now is the
[1:09:32] manifestation of the token
[1:09:35] the life of christ living through us
[1:09:38] what do we have to do to produce that
[1:09:40] nothing you just yield to it
[1:09:42] you just surrender
[1:09:46] now we have we have sometimes allowed it
[1:09:49] the lutheran allowed it to accepting the
[1:09:50] word
[1:09:51] accepting christ's personal savior the
[1:09:53] method is said when you get happy enough
[1:09:55] to shout that's it
[1:09:56] the pentecostal says speak in tongues
[1:09:58] then you got it and we found out that
[1:10:00] all of it was wrong
[1:10:02] see the token is the token it's you
[1:10:05] and christ as persons together see
[1:10:09] it's the holy spirit his life in you
[1:10:11] working his own life
[1:10:13] through you it's not what you do it's
[1:10:16] what you surrender to
[1:10:18] it's not what you do but it's what he
[1:10:19] does through you as you surrender to him
[1:10:22] and surrender
[1:10:23] as you surrender to the word you
[1:10:24] surrender to him and the life of the
[1:10:25] word begins to flow
[1:10:28] and become the token on display
[1:10:35] in the message of the token he says i
[1:10:36] believe there's so much
[1:10:38] tommy rotten people saying they shouted
[1:10:40] they spoke in tongues
[1:10:42] i believe in those things but you can't
[1:10:43] rely on that
[1:10:45] how can you rely on that and then deny
[1:10:47] the word
[1:10:50] the token is the word identified in you
[1:10:54] living itself out that's god being his
[1:10:57] own interpreter
[1:10:58] you don't have to say well now you
[1:11:00] interpret my tongue that ain't it
[1:11:01] he interprets your life by the word
[1:11:05] why because the the life on the inside
[1:11:07] begins to take the life on the outside
[1:11:09] and bring it subject to the word amen
[1:11:11] and all your desires turned heavenward
[1:11:17] again in the token he says don't you
[1:11:18] rely upon no speaking in tongues no
[1:11:20] nothing else
[1:11:20] but let the token itself be there the
[1:11:23] person of jesus christ his
[1:11:25] own life in you circumcise not just this
[1:11:28] and that but circumcise your whole being
[1:11:30] till you and christ are one christ in
[1:11:32] you and his life lives out
[1:11:34] through you you have to come into
[1:11:37] a union with christ so
[1:11:41] we start off brother the lord jesus told
[1:11:43] us
[1:11:44] that he was going to send the holy ghost
[1:11:47] and he told him he breathed on them and
[1:11:48] told him to receive it
[1:11:50] so he promised he would send it
[1:11:53] not their idea his not their request his
[1:11:56] promise
[1:11:57] before they could ask he already
[1:11:59] provided before they knew what they
[1:12:01] needed he had already told them what
[1:12:02] they would have
[1:12:05] then we moved into the
[1:12:09] to the experience of a changed life
[1:12:12] but i want to end with just a couple
[1:12:14] quotes when we talk about the evidence
[1:12:17] these things are different there's a
[1:12:18] promise there's an experience
[1:12:21] and there's an evidence this is what
[1:12:24] brother man talks about
[1:12:26] the promise is for whosoever
[1:12:29] is pricked in the heart and can repent
[1:12:30] and be baptized in jesus name
[1:12:33] and receive the holy ghost if you can do
[1:12:35] that it's for you
[1:12:38] the experience is the experience of a
[1:12:40] changed life
[1:12:42] but here's the evidence in the smyrna
[1:12:46] church age from the church age book
[1:12:48] probably says see it was the thought and
[1:12:50] then that thought became expressed and
[1:12:52] god
[1:12:53] bought back jacob because jacob alone
[1:12:55] was seed
[1:12:56] jacob alone had the seed that is why he
[1:12:59] had respect to the birthright and
[1:13:00] covenant of god
[1:13:02] if you are a true seed you will hear the
[1:13:04] word yes
[1:13:07] listen i love what brother brennam says
[1:13:09] brother baby say if you were true seed
[1:13:11] you better hear the word
[1:13:13] that's not what he's saying amen but we
[1:13:16] have taken what he said
[1:13:17] and we've made it we manufactured it
[1:13:19] through a reformation say if your true
[1:13:21] seed you'll listen to tapes every day
[1:13:23] and if you don't listen to the tapes and
[1:13:24] read your bible you're not seed
[1:13:27] that's the devil
[1:13:31] if i've ever been seen i'll always be
[1:13:33] seed
[1:13:34] and if i go through a dry spell and i
[1:13:35] don't listen to tapes for a week and i
[1:13:37] don't read my bible and i don't pray for
[1:13:38] a month i'm still seed
[1:13:43] you can't change that amen you can't
[1:13:46] change amen with your seed or not
[1:13:48] amen but i tell you if your genuine seed
[1:13:49] have been born again amen by the spirit
[1:13:51] of god
[1:13:52] you can't wait to get back to god amen
[1:13:54] if you drift away
[1:13:55] and then you recognize what's going on
[1:13:56] there's something in you that longs to
[1:13:58] be back in fellowship with him you're
[1:14:00] not satisfied that way you're not happy
[1:14:02] living that way
[1:14:03] you may find yourself in dry places you
[1:14:05] may find yourself
[1:14:06] amen in situations where you've
[1:14:08] neglected amen but you're not satisfied
[1:14:10] there
[1:14:11] if you've been born again by the spirit
[1:14:13] of god
[1:14:16] but if your seed your seed you're always
[1:14:18] seed always worth seed and nothing's
[1:14:19] going to change them
[1:14:21] so brother branham is not saying if your
[1:14:23] seed you better listen to the message of
[1:14:24] your seed you better agree with it
[1:14:27] that just makes a bunch of pretend
[1:14:30] but here's what he says if you're a true
[1:14:32] seed you will hear the word
[1:14:34] amen that happened to me
[1:14:40] if your true seed you will hear the word
[1:14:42] the spirit will baptize you into the
[1:14:44] body of christ
[1:14:45] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:14:47] will receive the word for your day and
[1:14:49] age
[1:14:49] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[1:14:52] when the word is revealed to you again
[1:14:56] no jesus was the royal seed
[1:14:57] he lived in a human body then spirit
[1:14:59] called to him the word manifested
[1:15:01] thought
[1:15:02] he went to jordan was there baptizing
[1:15:04] water upon obeying the word
[1:15:06] the holy spirit came upon him and the
[1:15:08] voice said this is my beloved son
[1:15:10] hear ye him the voice did not say this
[1:15:12] has become my son
[1:15:14] jesus was the son the holy ghost
[1:15:17] positioned him has that son before them
[1:15:19] all
[1:15:20] then having been filled thus and the
[1:15:22] same pattern holds at pentecost and ever
[1:15:25] after
[1:15:26] he went and demonstrated power receiving
[1:15:28] the full revelation of god
[1:15:30] and from god for that day listen what he
[1:15:33] said
[1:15:36] the spirit moved him the word was
[1:15:37] expressed moved into jordan he was
[1:15:39] baptized
[1:15:40] amen in jordan and then the holy ghost
[1:15:42] came upon him he didn't say this has
[1:15:44] become my son he said this is my son
[1:15:46] that's why the holy ghost came upon him
[1:15:48] because he already was a son
[1:15:49] and he was walking in obedience to the
[1:15:51] word to be baptized in jordan and when
[1:15:53] he walked in obedience to the word to be
[1:15:54] baptized in jordan because he was a son
[1:15:56] obeying the word the holy ghost came
[1:16:00] do you think it's different for you no
[1:16:01] the pattern is set it's the same
[1:16:03] if you're a son of god walking and
[1:16:05] obeying you hear the word you believe
[1:16:06] it's true you walk in obedience to the
[1:16:08] word
[1:16:08] he comes down receive him
[1:16:12] just say be it unto me lord i receive it
[1:16:14] in jesus name
[1:16:15] lord let it change me change me lord i
[1:16:18] need the experience of a change
[1:16:23] praise god then the saint peter holds
[1:16:27] true at pentecost forever
[1:16:29] but he says then having been filled thus
[1:16:31] he went and demonstrated power
[1:16:35] receiving the full revelation of god and
[1:16:37] from god for that day
[1:16:39] what was part of the holy ghost coming
[1:16:41] upon him the fact that he received the
[1:16:43] full revelation of god and from god for
[1:16:45] that day
[1:16:47] it wasn't just the demonstration it was
[1:16:49] the receipt
[1:16:50] it was the ability to receive the full
[1:16:52] revelation from god and of god
[1:16:56] so many times we fixate on one thing and
[1:16:59] we forget there was a whole life of
[1:17:00] jesus christ that was lived
[1:17:02] it wasn't just opening blind eyes he did
[1:17:04] that amen in that power
[1:17:05] still in the bride because wherever
[1:17:07] christ is that power is there amen
[1:17:10] the power to lay hands on the sick and
[1:17:11] healed and the power to anoint with all
[1:17:13] it's here friends but he also had a
[1:17:17] character like no other character amen
[1:17:19] and it doesn't matter how many uh i mean
[1:17:21] how many times you lay hands on the
[1:17:22] stick and they're healed but if you got
[1:17:23] temper enough to fight a buzzsaw and men
[1:17:25] it won't even obey the word
[1:17:30] there was a character that went with it
[1:17:34] and there was the ability to receive
[1:17:36] revelation from god that went with it as
[1:17:38] well
[1:17:39] it was a full package
[1:17:42] it goes on in the quote to say now we
[1:17:44] have been constantly saying
[1:17:46] that the true evidence of being baptized
[1:17:49] with the holy ghost
[1:17:50] is that you never sin again
[1:17:53] it's not what he said
[1:17:58] the true evidence of being baptized with
[1:18:00] the holy ghost is for the believer to
[1:18:02] receive the word for the age in which he
[1:18:04] lives
[1:18:08] is that complicated it's simple
[1:18:12] and questions and answers from 64 he
[1:18:14] says there's only one evidence of the
[1:18:16] holy spirit that i know of
[1:18:18] and that is a genuine faith in the
[1:18:20] promised word of the hour
[1:18:23] i say thank you lord because i have that
[1:18:26] and i didn't give that to myself i have
[1:18:29] that
[1:18:30] despite myself i have it because he gave
[1:18:32] me a gift of faith i believe there's
[1:18:34] something in me to believe the word with
[1:18:40] so we have a promise
[1:18:43] to you to those who hear the word and
[1:18:46] pricked in their heart
[1:18:47] who repent and are baptized in his name
[1:18:50] there's a promise to you
[1:18:51] to receive the holy ghost and you have
[1:18:53] an experience of a change in the soul
[1:18:56] and you have the evidence of being able
[1:18:58] to receive the word for your day
[1:19:01] it's not complicated it's simple
[1:19:06] but you can't manufacture it
[1:19:09] it's not complicated it's not hard
[1:19:13] but you can't do it
[1:19:17] that's the catch-22 it's not complicated
[1:19:20] to understand
[1:19:22] the scripture's plain the message is
[1:19:24] plain it's not complicated
[1:19:27] it's not hard but you can't
[1:19:31] do it the only way that will
[1:19:35] ever happen to you is if you're a seed
[1:19:38] of god and your name is written on the
[1:19:39] lamb's book of life
[1:19:40] before the foundation of the world and
[1:19:42] if you are seed then you will hear the
[1:19:44] word
[1:19:45] the spirit will baptize you with the
[1:19:47] battle when it goes and you will receive
[1:19:49] the word for your day and hour
[1:19:51] why because he already determined it
[1:19:53] will happen
[1:19:55] it's by his grace
[1:19:59] let's read john 16 together musicians if
[1:20:02] you'd come
[1:20:02] mr blake if you come read this last
[1:20:05] scripture together
[1:20:08] i've got a lot more but i'm going to
[1:20:10] wait for sunday
[1:20:11] and see how the lord leads john 16
[1:20:15] verse 13.
[1:20:19] how be when he the spirit of truth is
[1:20:21] come what's his title this time
[1:20:24] spirit of truth truth
[1:20:27] what is the message of the hour the
[1:20:29] truth
[1:20:31] when he the spirit of truth has come he
[1:20:33] will guide you into all truth
[1:20:35] for you shall not speak of himself but
[1:20:37] whatsoever he shall hear
[1:20:39] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:20:41] things to come
[1:20:43] he shall glorify me
[1:20:46] for he shall receive a mine and shall
[1:20:49] show it
[1:20:50] unto you all things that the father hath
[1:20:52] are mine
[1:20:53] therefore said i that he shall take of
[1:20:55] mine
[1:20:56] and shall show it unto you
[1:20:59] this is part of the work of the holy
[1:21:02] spirit
[1:21:03] the spirit of truth will lead you into
[1:21:05] all truth
[1:21:06] and he will take what comes from the
[1:21:08] father all that the father
[1:21:09] is christ is the sons and what's the
[1:21:11] sons he'll give it and show it to you
[1:21:15] where did this revelation come from amen
[1:21:17] the spirit of truth
[1:21:19] from the father how did you receive it
[1:21:22] amen did you work your way up to it how
[1:21:24] did the apostle paul receive it
[1:21:26] he was going the wrong direction but
[1:21:28] because he was a seed it had to come to
[1:21:30] him
[1:21:31] how did you receive it because you're a
[1:21:33] seed it had to come to you
[1:21:35] we just have to have enough faith to say
[1:21:37] lord it's me
[1:21:39] i receive it lord i receive it because
[1:21:42] you told me to receive it i receive it
[1:21:43] because i'm a candidate for it i receive
[1:21:45] it because i believe it
[1:21:46] now lord as i receive your spirit change
[1:21:48] me lord
[1:21:49] give me the experience of a changed life
[1:21:52] something that i can put my foot upon
[1:21:56] i mean let's all stand
[1:21:59] i hope that that was helpful god
[1:22:02] did not make the gospel complicated
[1:22:05] but he made it impossible
[1:22:12] chew on that for a while he did not make
[1:22:15] the gospel message complicated but he
[1:22:17] made it impossible
[1:22:19] that you cannot take peacock feathers
[1:22:21] and stick it in a crow it's impossible
[1:22:24] to do it yourself
[1:22:25] it's impossible to work your way up to
[1:22:27] it it's impossible to reform somebody
[1:22:29] into it it's
[1:22:30] impossible the gospel is impossible for
[1:22:33] you to do yourself
[1:22:35] but it's not complicated it's simple
[1:22:39] if your seed you will hear the word
[1:22:42] he will baptize you with his spirit and
[1:22:45] you will receive the word for your day
[1:22:48] and i say thank you god
[1:22:51] you will be converted by the holy ghost
[1:22:54] you will have what they had in the upper
[1:22:55] room when they couldn't get over
[1:22:56] themselves they couldn't stop from
[1:22:58] tripping over their own feet
[1:22:59] amen there's something that came into
[1:23:00] them that was a life amen that was not
[1:23:02] their own it was a new life
[1:23:04] it became a new creation amen and if
[1:23:07] your seed you'll hear the word he'll
[1:23:09] baptize you with the spirit
[1:23:10] that seed in you will be quickened to a
[1:23:12] new life amen
[1:23:13] the old nature will die out in the soul
[1:23:15] amen and the nature of the seed will
[1:23:17] come to life
[1:23:19] and you will hear the word for your day
[1:23:21] and you will obey
[1:23:24] and god will get all the glory because
[1:23:26] you couldn't do it
[1:23:29] the gospel is simple but it's impossible
[1:23:33] it can't be it can't be bought
[1:23:36] it can't be earned it can only be
[1:23:39] received
[1:23:41] i say lord give me a heart to receive it
[1:23:45] let's just bow our heads and pray lord
[1:23:48] jesus we thank you for your word
[1:23:51] god i'm so thankful this evening that
[1:23:54] you saw
[1:23:55] fit to have a little woman by the name
[1:23:57] of sister george bruce
[1:23:59] go through a trial in her life and have
[1:24:02] a
[1:24:02] condition of nervousness lord and a
[1:24:05] heart issue
[1:24:06] so that she would need your prophet lord
[1:24:10] and that conversation would be recorded
[1:24:12] lord and laid on a tape
[1:24:14] for me so that i could hear it
[1:24:17] in 2021 and i could know your attitude
[1:24:21] and approach lord toward the baptism of
[1:24:23] the holy ghost
[1:24:24] god you're so mindful of your children
[1:24:26] you're so sensitive you're so gentle
[1:24:28] with us lord
[1:24:30] you're so mindful of our need that you
[1:24:32] look 60 years in advance and make sure
[1:24:35] you provide something that we would need
[1:24:37] so that we wouldn't be deceived by the
[1:24:39] devil so that we wouldn't be tripped up
[1:24:41] by his lies
[1:24:43] so that we could see and hear the truth
[1:24:46] lord
[1:24:47] and it could be applied lord by faith
[1:24:50] and we could tell the devil that he's a
[1:24:51] liar and that your word is true
[1:24:55] god i pray that you bless your people
[1:24:57] that are here lord
[1:24:58] god if there's anybody that's being lied
[1:25:00] to by the devil
[1:25:02] i pray god that what we heard from your
[1:25:04] prophet tonight
[1:25:05] i pray that it would dispel all the lies
[1:25:07] and they'd be able lord to just
[1:25:09] resist the devil so that the devil will
[1:25:11] flee
[1:25:12] that they could go back and put their
[1:25:13] foot upon that experience
[1:25:15] lord where their life was changed
[1:25:18] and god if there's those here who have
[1:25:19] not yet had the experience of the
[1:25:21] baptism of holy ghost
[1:25:22] i pray that you quicken it to him now in
[1:25:24] jesus name that you give them a faith to
[1:25:27] open their heart and receive it lord
[1:25:29] the simplicity that you gave it and that
[1:25:31] you'll come in and that you'll do
[1:25:33] a work that they could never do
[1:25:34] themselves that you'll bring a change
[1:25:36] lord from the soul
[1:25:37] that they could never do on their own
[1:25:40] and i pray god that they would have an
[1:25:41] experience of a changed life
[1:25:43] the power to live a christian life god
[1:25:46] move i pray
[1:25:48] move on each of us lord continue to mold
[1:25:50] us into your image and draw us closer to
[1:25:52] you
