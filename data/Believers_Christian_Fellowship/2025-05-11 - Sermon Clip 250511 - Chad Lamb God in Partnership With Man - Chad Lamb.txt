TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Paul was on partnership. Yes, sir. Remember Paul, Amen, was persecuting the church. He was running them into prison. He was scattering them all over. Amen. He was wreaking havoc on the church of God. That's what the Bible says. He was wreaking havoc on the church of God. And then one day, God was going to interrupt his plan because God had a plan for Saul. Yes. He was part of his predestinated plan. He was going to be part of the program. And no matter what he was doing now, didn't change what God had already foresaw. That's right. And he comes to Ananas and he says, "I I want you to go to Paul first." He smites him down on the road to Damascus. And he gives him a tremendous revelation. He said, "Why are you persecuting me?" And he said, "Uh, who are you, Lord?" He's looking at a pillar of fire, not a human body. He's looking at a pillar of fire. And the pillar of fire speaks and said, "Why do you persecute me?" He said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus whom you persecute." Who was he persecuting? He was persecuting the church of Jesus. So when he was persecuting the church, Jesus says, "That's who I am. I am those people. They're on partnership with me. When you haul them to prison, you're taking me to prison. When you persecute them, you persecute me because I'm dwelling in them." So then he smitten blind. Ananas has to come to him and Ananas said how Lord how how can we do this and don't you know I love when people says that you know he didn't say don't you know but he says I've heard many things about this Saul how he's done this and this like he's teaching God something and God says he's a chosen vessel hallelujah he's a chosen vessel and I've already decided what works he's going to do he's going to take this light and he's going to shine it to the Gentiles and to kings. Amen. He comes and he gives him the commission and sends him off. You know what Paul says of himself? He said, "I am a light to the Gentiles." That's a prophecy out of Isaiah. You know who that prophecy applies to? Jesus Christ. But Paul said, Paul didn't say Jesus is. He said, "I am." Well, who's the I? Yeah. Was it the man or was it Christ in the man? God is on partnership with man. The message didn't go to the Gentiles until Paul carried it to the Gentiles. Paul had to stand. Paul had to open his mouth. Paul had to speak. Paul had to be willing to be stoned. And Paul, after he was stoned, had to get up. And Paul had to make the choice to walk back in again. Amen. That was Paul's part. All the supernatural, all the revelation, all the truth that was revealed, that was God's part. But Paul, Paul had to get on a boat. He had to brave storms. Paul had to get seasick. Paul had to walk. Paul had to stand. Paul had to talk. God supplied the anointing. God supplied the words. God supplied the revelation. God supplied the supernatural. But Paul had to carry it to the people.
