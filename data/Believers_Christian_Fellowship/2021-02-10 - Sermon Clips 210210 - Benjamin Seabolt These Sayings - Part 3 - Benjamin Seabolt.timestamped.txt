[0:00] the words that i speak unto you they are
[0:02] spirit and they are life
[0:05] matthew 10 backs this up behold i send
[0:08] you forth as sheep in the midst of
[0:09] wolves
[0:10] biggie therefore wisest serpent and
[0:12] harmless as doves
[0:14] verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth
[0:17] me
[0:18] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[0:21] that sent me
[0:26] acts 2 6 and it came to pass that as i
[0:30] made my journey paul's speaking
[0:32] and was come nigh into damascus about
[0:34] noon suddenly they're shown from heaven
[0:36] a great light round about me
[0:37] and i fell under the ground and i heard
[0:39] a voice saying to me saul saul
[0:41] why persecutest thou me this is one of
[0:44] my favorite scriptures in the whole
[0:45] bible
[0:47] and i answered who art thou lord and he
[0:51] said unto me i am jesus of
[0:54] nazareth who thou persecute us and we
[0:57] all
[0:58] know paul never saw jesus paul was
[1:01] persecuting the early church
[1:05] he was persecuting people that had been
[1:07] in heaven and came down from heaven and
[1:09] were doing the work of god
[1:11] they were doing the will of the father
[1:13] and paul was persecuting them
[1:16] and god himself came and said i am jesus
[1:19] who you are persecuting
[1:23] see we're not out in left field when we
[1:24] preach these things saints they're all
[1:26] through the bible
[1:28] all through the bible she
[1:32] is him if we can't get comfortable with
[1:36] that
[1:38] you might as well eat drink and be merry
[1:42] you might as well just burn your bibles
[1:44] burn the churches
[1:46] shut everything down and just be happy
[1:49] and live whatever your hybrid spirit
[1:50] tells you to live
[1:53] because that is the message saints
[1:57] that is what we are returning back to we
[1:59] are returning back to genesis
[2:01] 5. he created man
[2:05] male and female created he them and
[2:07] called their name
[2:08] adam that is the message
[2:13] that is the message and that is what the
[2:15] prophet has
[2:16] came and in 1200 different ways tried to
[2:20] tell us
