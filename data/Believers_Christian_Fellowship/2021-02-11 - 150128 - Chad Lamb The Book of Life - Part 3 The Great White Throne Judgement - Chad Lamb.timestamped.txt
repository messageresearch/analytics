[0:00] for us a week from today so make sure
[0:02] you take note of that as well
[0:04] praise the lord let's go to saint john
[0:07] chapter 5
[0:08] and verse 28.
[0:14] jesus is speaking here says marvel not
[0:17] at this
[0:17] for the hours coming in which all that
[0:19] are in the grave shall hear his voice
[0:22] now this this all that are in the grave
[0:24] shall hear his voice
[0:25] is not speaking of the rapture of the
[0:27] church right because of the rapture of
[0:29] the church
[0:30] all that are in the graves do not hear
[0:31] his voice but only those that are dead
[0:33] in christ shall arise
[0:35] okay so he's speaking here of all the
[0:39] dead
[0:39] all that are in the graves read it again
[0:42] marvel not this for the hours coming in
[0:43] which
[0:44] all that are in the grape shall hear his
[0:45] voice and shall come
[0:47] forth so what he's talking about is the
[0:49] general resurrection of the dead that
[0:51] will take place after the millennial
[0:52] reign
[0:53] all right it shall come forth they
[0:57] that have done good unto the
[0:58] resurrection of life
[1:00] and they that have done evil unto the
[1:02] resurrection
[1:03] of damnation that's not the first
[1:06] resurrection that's the second
[1:07] resurrection
[1:08] then everybody who comes in the second
[1:10] resurrection must go to judgment
[1:12] some unto life and some into damnation
[1:17] all right let's pray the heavenly father
[1:20] we ask that you bless the reading of
[1:21] your word
[1:22] let your anointing lord be upon the
[1:24] servant i pray god that you would speak
[1:26] here
[1:27] that you would have free reign in this
[1:28] assembly tonight lord
[1:30] that we will all have ears to hear and
[1:31] we would all have hearts to perceive
[1:33] all that you choose to speak to us this
[1:35] evening we ask your blessings in jesus
[1:37] christ's name
[1:38] amen you can be seated and as you're
[1:41] seated let's flip over to revelations
[1:43] chapter 20.
[1:48] and uh hopefully you brought your church
[1:50] age books back i didn't say that
[1:52] specifically i should have made a
[1:53] specific announcement
[1:54] but i'll be reading quite a bit out of
[1:56] the book and i also have an overhead
[1:58] slide we can go ahead and bring the
[1:59] powerpoint up
[2:00] so the references that i'm going to read
[2:01] i wrote down the references on the
[2:03] overheads so if you didn't bring your
[2:04] book you can just jot them down
[2:06] and you can go home and look at those
[2:07] then
[2:09] we're going to talk about the book of
[2:10] life and we're going to talk about the
[2:11] great white throne judgment
[2:13] today revelations chapter 20 let's read
[2:16] from verse 11.
[2:19] and i saw a great white throne in him
[2:21] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[2:23] and the heaven fled away
[2:24] and there was found no place for them
[2:27] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[2:29] before god
[2:30] and the books were opened and another
[2:32] book was opened which is the book of
[2:33] life
[2:34] so there's going to be books not just
[2:36] one book but at this judgment there's
[2:37] going to be multiple books
[2:39] there's going to be books and another
[2:42] book
[2:43] which is the book of life and the dead
[2:46] were judged out of those things which
[2:48] are written
[2:49] in the books so the book of life does
[2:52] not contain
[2:53] all the deeds that were done the book of
[2:55] life only contains
[2:56] names but the rest of the books are in
[2:59] the rest of the books contain the record
[3:01] of what you did in your life of the
[3:03] basis for the judgment
[3:05] okay but the book of life is just a book
[3:07] of names
[3:08] all that's in the book of life is a
[3:09] record of names
[3:12] that's why there's multiple books but
[3:14] then it says according to their
[3:16] works now that's interesting that this
[3:18] judgment
[3:19] is a judgment based on works it's not a
[3:21] judgment based on faith
[3:23] right because those who have faith
[3:26] believe unto righteousness
[3:27] because they believe the word of the
[3:29] lord and because they believe the word
[3:30] of the lord just like when abraham
[3:32] believed that the world
[3:33] word of the lord it was imputed unto him
[3:35] for righteousness
[3:36] and so these are not judged based off
[3:40] faith this judgment is a judgment based
[3:42] on
[3:42] works let's read on a little bit
[3:46] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[3:47] in it and death and hell delivered of
[3:49] the dead which were in them
[3:50] and they were judged every man according
[3:53] to their
[3:54] works hold your finger right there and
[3:57] flip with me over to ephesians chapter
[3:58] 2.
[4:11] ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by grace
[4:14] are you saved through faith and that not
[4:17] of yourselves it is the gift of god
[4:19] not of works okay we are not
[4:23] saved by works you are saved by grace
[4:25] through faith and that not of yourself
[4:27] that is the gift of god
[4:28] not of works lest any man should boast
[4:32] so he's very clearly saying that our
[4:35] faith
[4:36] or our grace that is given to us to the
[4:38] believer to those that are in christ
[4:40] to those that come to the first
[4:41] resurrection or those that are dead in
[4:44] christ and those that are alive in
[4:45] christ
[4:46] will be gathered together to meet him in
[4:47] the air they are saved by grace
[4:50] through faith not of works
[4:54] lest any man should boast all right
[4:57] but over here in the judgment we see
[4:59] that they are being judged according to
[5:00] their works
[5:02] it's different groups right cannot be
[5:04] the same group
[5:06] let's go over to romans chapter four
[5:08] together
[5:13] romans chapter 4 and verse 1
[5:16] what shall we say then that abraham our
[5:18] father has pertained to the flesh
[5:20] hath found as pertaining to the flesh
[5:21] hath found for if abraham were justified
[5:24] by works
[5:25] he hath were of to glory but not before
[5:27] god for what saith the scripture
[5:29] abraham believed god and it was counted
[5:32] unto him for righteousness
[5:33] now to him that worketh is the reward
[5:35] not reckon of grace
[5:37] but of debt so he's saying that he
[5:39] believed
[5:40] in his reward was for faith so go over
[5:43] to chapter five romans chapter five when
[5:45] we
[5:45] read verse one therefore being justified
[5:48] by
[5:49] faith so how are you justified or
[5:51] declared just just as if you had never
[5:53] sinned before
[5:54] you're justified by faith
[5:57] not by works justified by faith
[6:01] we have peace with god through our lord
[6:02] jesus christ by whom also we have
[6:05] access by faith unto his grace
[6:08] how do we get to his grace by faith
[6:12] faith is a free gift of god not of
[6:14] ourselves but is the gift of god
[6:16] not of works works does not produce
[6:18] faith works does not give us faith and
[6:20] worse does not give us access to grace
[6:23] but we're justified by faith and by
[6:25] faith we're given access to his grace
[6:28] and if by faith you've received access
[6:30] to his grace
[6:31] then you you become part of christ you
[6:33] get baptized into the body of christ
[6:35] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[6:37] one body then we are now
[6:39] passed from death and the life we are in
[6:41] christ jesus
[6:44] and now when christ comes to call his
[6:47] elect
[6:48] we go because we're in christ amen
[6:51] because we've been justified by
[6:54] faith by whom also we have access verse
[6:58] two again by faith into the grace
[7:00] wherein
[7:00] we stand and rejoice in the hope and
[7:02] glory of god
[7:04] so that is how the believer comes into
[7:07] this grace
[7:08] is by faith this is how the elect the
[7:10] children of god
[7:12] come into this justification is by faith
[7:15] so we've already been justified and how
[7:18] have we already been justified
[7:19] we've already been justified because
[7:21] we're in christ
[7:24] christ was nailed to a cross bearing the
[7:26] reproach and shame and sin
[7:28] on our behalf and so now our sin
[7:31] is part of christ and when christ died
[7:33] in the flesh
[7:34] he died and he he bore our shame he
[7:37] took our punishment and now we are
[7:39] justified by
[7:41] faith in christ right
[7:44] and if we're in christ now it means we
[7:46] were in christ then
[7:48] because you cannot get into christ
[7:50] unless you were always a part of christ
[7:52] because christ is more than jesus christ
[7:54] is the anointed word
[7:56] christ was that rock that followed moses
[7:58] through the wilderness that was not
[8:00] jesus that was christ
[8:01] the anointed word and now by faith in
[8:04] christ the anointed word
[8:05] we become we are part of him signifying
[8:08] that we were part of him before
[8:10] we've always been part of him so when he
[8:11] was nailed to the cross we were part of
[8:13] them
[8:14] that's why we'll not stand the judgment
[8:15] because we've already been judged
[8:18] when were we judged in christ
[8:21] and god cannot judge us twice and that's
[8:24] why when we have
[8:25] faith into christ we have faith that
[8:28] faith
[8:28] links us to that punishment on the cross
[8:32] and there's no more there's no more
[8:34] sacrifice for sin for us
[8:37] right and it's all by faith that we
[8:39] receive that grace
[8:41] but this judgment is not the same those
[8:44] who come up in this judgment are not in
[8:45] the same place
[8:46] we know they're not in christ or they
[8:48] would have come in the first
[8:48] resurrection they wouldn't be in the
[8:50] second resurrection
[8:51] we know that they don't have faith that
[8:53] that gets some justification we know
[8:54] that they don't have faith that gives
[8:56] them access to grace
[8:57] or else they would have come in the
[8:58] first resurrection but because in their
[9:01] second resurrection they're not in that
[9:02] same category
[9:04] all right are we on the same page all
[9:07] right let's keep working
[9:08] through this in verse 13 and the sea
[9:10] gave up the dead which were in it and
[9:12] death and hell delivered up the dead
[9:13] which were in them
[9:14] and they were judged every man according
[9:16] to their works
[9:17] and death and hell were cast into the
[9:19] lake of fire this is
[9:21] the second death and whosoever was not
[9:23] found written in the book of life
[9:25] was cast into the lake of fire so we
[9:28] want to look at this white throne
[9:29] judgment
[9:31] and take a look at the book of life
[9:33] again so we the subject was the book of
[9:35] life
[9:35] and the book of life we find out is very
[9:37] important in the white throne judgment
[9:39] because if your name is not written in
[9:41] that book of life at the time of the
[9:43] white throne judgment
[9:44] then you're cast into the lake of fire
[9:47] so we want to see
[9:47] what this book of life is
[9:51] now brother branham tells us in the
[9:53] analogy that we read last week in the
[9:55] church age book
[9:56] that this book of life is the record of
[9:58] the wheat plant
[9:59] but not all the wheat plant a seed some
[10:01] of it was a support system that carried
[10:03] the life as the life came through
[10:05] to reproduce the grain again in the head
[10:07] and not the whole plant is seed not the
[10:09] whole plant
[10:10] plant is bride not the whole plant is
[10:12] the elect
[10:13] but the whole plant is recorded in the
[10:15] book of life
[10:16] okay it's also called the lamb's book of
[10:20] life
[10:21] it's also called thy book the book of
[10:23] life of the lamb
[10:25] the record of the righteous
[10:29] but brother ben says there's two
[10:31] sections to this book
[10:33] this book is is one book but there's two
[10:35] sections
[10:37] and this section of the book which is a
[10:38] small portion of the book
[10:40] is the section of the book of life
[10:44] this is what has eternal life that which
[10:46] was in christ in the beginning
[10:48] that which is in christ now section of
[10:51] the book of life
[10:52] brother branham when he's preaching more
[10:54] often than not calls this the lamb's
[10:56] book of life
[10:57] but not 100 of the time you have to be
[10:59] careful when you're reading the message
[11:00] because he he refers more often than not
[11:03] when he's talking about the lamb's book
[11:04] of life he's talking about this section
[11:06] of the book of life that has to do with
[11:08] the eternal
[11:10] it's the record of the seed part of the
[11:12] plant so if the book of life
[11:14] is the record of the entire plant this
[11:16] section of the book of life or the
[11:18] lamb's book of life
[11:19] is the record of the seed portion of
[11:21] this plant
[11:23] it's the record of eternal life and it's
[11:26] the names of the elected
[11:30] that's the seed portion
[11:34] it's also the bride the word
[11:38] those that rule are ruling and reigning
[11:40] with christ for a thousand years
[11:41] if you're not on the seed portion of
[11:43] this you won't be in the millennium
[11:45] ruling and reigning with christ for a
[11:46] thousand years
[11:48] and it's also the judges of the world
[11:51] because this is the record of eternal
[11:52] life this is the record of christ this
[11:54] is the record of the word
[11:55] coming forth in each generation this is
[11:58] what judges the world
[12:01] this royal seed portion of the book
[12:04] we'll look at that and see that clearly
[12:06] here shortly
[12:08] revelations 20 4 and 6 and i saw thrones
[12:12] and they sat upon them and judgment was
[12:14] given unto them
[12:16] so he he sees thrones and he sees people
[12:19] sit on the thrones
[12:20] and he sees judgment given to the people
[12:22] who are sitting on the thrones
[12:24] meaning that they are going to pass
[12:25] judgment so he goes on to describe this
[12:27] group
[12:29] and i saw the souls of them that were
[12:31] beheaded for the witnesses of jesus and
[12:32] for the word of god
[12:34] and which had not worshipped the beast
[12:36] neither his image neither had received
[12:37] his mark upon their foreheads
[12:39] or in their hands and they lived and
[12:40] reigned with christ a thousand years
[12:42] so which group is he talking about this
[12:45] is the seed portion of the book this is
[12:46] the elect this is the bride
[12:48] this is who he's talking about but the
[12:51] rest of the dead lived not again until
[12:53] the thousand years were finished
[12:54] this is the first resurrection
[12:57] so we're clear on who we're talking
[12:59] about
[13:00] verse six blessed and holy is he that
[13:02] hath part in the first resurrection
[13:04] on such the second death hath no power
[13:07] but they shall be priest of god and of
[13:09] christ and shall reign with him
[13:11] a thousand years so this is the first
[13:14] resurrection this is
[13:15] this is the record or the account of the
[13:17] first resurrection that were seated on
[13:19] thrones
[13:20] and judgment is given to them
[13:24] let's grab our church age book if you
[13:26] have it and we'll turn to page 276.
[13:34] 276 chapter 1 we're going to start with
[13:37] the very first sentence in 276.
[13:41] these righteous will not be the bride
[13:43] for the bride sits with him
[13:45] in judgment first corinthians 6 2 3 says
[13:48] do you
[13:49] do you not know that the saints shall
[13:50] judge the world and the world shall be
[13:52] judged by you are you
[13:53] unworthy to judge the smallest matters
[13:56] know you not that we shall judge angels
[13:58] how much more things that pertain to
[13:59] this life
[14:01] revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh
[14:03] will i grant to sit with me
[14:05] in my throne even as i also overcame and
[14:08] overcame
[14:09] and am set down with my father in his
[14:11] throne
[14:12] see the bride is with him in the throne
[14:15] as she is to judge the world
[14:16] she has to be sitting in the judgment
[14:18] with him that is exactly what daniel saw
[14:21] daniel chapter 7 verse 9 and 10. i
[14:24] beheld till the thrones were cast down
[14:26] and the ancient of days did sit whose
[14:28] garment was white as snow and the hair
[14:30] of his head like the pure wool
[14:32] his throne was like the fiery flame in
[14:34] his wheels as burning fire
[14:36] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[14:38] from him
[14:39] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[14:41] and ten thousand times
[14:43] ten thousand stood before him the
[14:45] judgment was set
[14:46] and the books were open see it is the
[14:48] same scene for the thousand thousands
[14:50] who are ministering to him
[14:52] are the bride for who ministers to the
[14:54] husband
[14:55] but the wife so there's thousand
[14:58] thousands which he said to the bride
[15:00] are ministering to the lamb sitting on
[15:02] the throne
[15:03] but before the lamb is the ten thousand
[15:07] times ten thousand that are before him
[15:09] and this is the setting of the judgment
[15:11] he's saying this is the judgment this is
[15:12] the scene of the white throne judgment
[15:14] but the bride is not before him in the
[15:16] judgment the bride is sitting with him
[15:18] ministering to him
[15:19] in the judgment let's turn to daniel
[15:22] chapter 7 together
[15:32] daniel chapter 7.
[15:35] that's where we just read from out of
[15:36] the church age book was verse 9 and 10
[15:39] but if we jump over to verse 22
[15:42] daniel chapter 7 verse 22 says
[15:45] until the ancient of days came and
[15:48] judgment was given to the saints
[15:51] of the most high and the time came that
[15:54] the saints possessed
[15:56] the kingdom this is the same thing that
[15:58] we read
[15:59] in revelations we just read in
[16:01] revelations 20 4 and 6
[16:03] that i saw thrones and they sat upon
[16:05] them and judgment was given unto them
[16:07] that was those who came up in the first
[16:09] resurrection
[16:10] and here he says the ancient of days
[16:12] came and judgment was given
[16:14] to the saints because the saints shall
[16:16] judge the world
[16:18] know you not that ye shall judge the
[16:20] world.
[16:22] hallelujah it's all saying the same
[16:24] thing
[16:26] let's go on so in the book of life you
[16:28] have this small portion of the book of
[16:30] life is the record of the seed
[16:32] and this larger person of the book of
[16:34] life is the record of the plant
[16:36] and the the plant is necessary to make
[16:39] the seed
[16:40] right the plant's there you've got to
[16:42] have photosynthesis you've got to have a
[16:44] stalk that holds it up so it doesn't rot
[16:46] you have to have this support system to
[16:48] bring forth life so you have the seed
[16:50] portion you have the plant portion and
[16:51] the plant portion is necessary
[16:54] this plant portion is called the wheat
[16:57] plant
[16:58] and it's the righteous at the judgment
[17:01] so those that are declared righteous at
[17:02] the judgment are part of this
[17:04] plant
[17:07] in the seed portion of this book names
[17:10] cannot be removed
[17:14] why because if you're in christ now then
[17:17] you had to have representation in christ
[17:19] before the foundation of the world
[17:21] and that which is in christ can't be
[17:23] lost you can't be in christ one day and
[17:25] out of christ the next day you can't be
[17:27] part of the word
[17:28] then not part of the word the next day
[17:30] it doesn't work that way
[17:31] if you were ever part of christ you were
[17:32] always part of christ
[17:34] amen so that part
[17:37] names cannot be removed but in the
[17:40] regular part of the book of life or the
[17:41] plant portion
[17:42] names can be removed it's possible to
[17:45] have
[17:45] names removed and we'll look at this
[17:47] let's go to exodus together we're going
[17:48] to read these three portions of
[17:50] scripture together
[17:52] exodus 32 in exodus 32
[17:55] 30 we find that this is the children of
[17:58] israel in the exodus journey they're
[18:00] coming out and this is when they made
[18:01] themselves
[18:02] golden calf a golden calf and they begin
[18:04] to worship at it
[18:05] and this is how moses responds
[18:09] and this is what the lord says exodus
[18:12] 32 30 and it came to pass on the morrow
[18:15] that moses said unto the people
[18:17] you have sinned a great sin and now i
[18:20] will go up unto the lord per adventure i
[18:22] shall make an atonement for your sin
[18:25] and moses returned unto the lord and
[18:26] said all this people have sinned a great
[18:28] sin
[18:29] and have made them gods of gold yet now
[18:31] if thou will forgive their sin
[18:33] and if not blot me i pray thee out of
[18:36] thy book
[18:37] which thou has written what book is he
[18:40] talking about
[18:41] he's not talking about books plural
[18:44] he's talking about book one book and
[18:46] this is the book of life
[18:48] and he's saying if you cannot forgive
[18:49] them then blot my name out instead
[18:52] out of your book here's god's response
[18:58] 33 and the lord said unto moses
[19:00] whosoever has sinned against me
[19:03] him will i blot out of my book
[19:07] see it's possible to have names blotted
[19:09] out of the book of life out of god's
[19:11] book
[19:12] all right and he says him that sinned
[19:14] against me will i block
[19:18] let's go to oh let's read thirty four
[19:20] therefore now go lead the people into
[19:22] the place of which i have spoken unto
[19:24] thee
[19:25] behold mine angel shall go before thee
[19:27] nevertheless in the day when i visit
[19:29] i will visit their sin upon them so god
[19:33] god is keeping records he's keeping good
[19:35] records let's go over to psalm 69.
[19:40] in psalm 69 we have a psalm that's
[19:43] recording the death of jesus christ
[19:45] and and this is about christ on the
[19:48] cross
[19:49] so we're going to start reading
[19:52] in verse 21 psalm 69
[19:55] verse 21 they gave me also
[19:59] golf from my meat and in my thirst they
[20:01] gave me vinegar to drink
[20:03] let their table become a snare before
[20:05] them and that they which
[20:07] and that which should have been for
[20:08] their welfare let it become a trap
[20:11] that their eyes be dark and that they
[20:12] see not and make their loins continually
[20:14] to shake
[20:16] pour out thine indignation upon them and
[20:18] let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
[20:21] let their habitation be desolate and let
[20:23] none dwell there in their tents
[20:25] for they persecuted him whom thou hast
[20:27] mentioned and they talked to the grief
[20:28] of those whom now has wounded
[20:31] and add iniquity unto their iniquity and
[20:33] let them not come into thy righteousness
[20:35] let them be blotted out of the book of
[20:37] the living and not be written with the
[20:39] righteous
[20:41] here's another group that had their name
[20:43] blotted off of the book of life
[20:45] and want for for persecuting jesus
[20:47] christ
[20:49] for persecuting jesus christ they had
[20:51] their names removed blotted out the book
[20:53] of life
[20:55] and i just want to add here that anybody
[20:58] every time that you reject
[21:00] christ and whatever force form
[21:03] christ comes in then you have rejected
[21:08] god and that is when you become eligible
[21:11] to have your name
[21:12] blotted off of the book of life
[21:16] you've sinned against god let's go to
[21:18] revelations chapter 3.
[21:27] revelations chapter 3
[21:30] verse 4 and 5.
[21:35] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[21:37] which have not defiled their garments
[21:39] how many names was it a big bunch of
[21:41] names
[21:42] just a few names and all that church age
[21:46] and sardis
[21:47] there's just a few names that have not
[21:49] defiled their garments
[21:51] that was the few names even in sardis
[21:53] which have not defiled their garments
[21:54] and they shall walk with me in white for
[21:56] they are worthy he that overcometh the
[21:59] same shall be clothed in white raiment
[22:01] and i will not blot out his name out of
[22:03] the book of life
[22:05] if you walk with the lord you will not
[22:09] have your name blotted out of the book
[22:10] of life
[22:12] praise the lord it's a great consolation
[22:15] let's go back to the church age book and
[22:17] we'll read
[22:18] 267
[22:23] page 267 the last paragraph paragraph
[22:26] two
[22:27] now where is this book located he's
[22:29] talking about the book of life where is
[22:31] this book located
[22:32] luke 10 17 and 24 says and the seventy
[22:35] returned again with joy saying lord
[22:37] even the devils are subject unto undust
[22:39] through thy name and he said unto them
[22:41] i beheld satan as lightning fall from
[22:43] heaven behold i give unto you power to
[22:44] tread on serpents and scorpions
[22:46] and over all the power of the enemy and
[22:48] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[22:50] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[22:52] the spirits are subject unto you
[22:54] but rather rejoice because your names
[22:56] are written in heaven
[22:57] in that hour jesus rejoiced in the
[22:59] spirit and said i thank thee
[23:01] o father lord of heaven and earth that
[23:02] thou hast hid these things from the wise
[23:04] and the putin
[23:05] and has revealed them unto babes
[23:08] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[23:10] sight all things are delivered to me of
[23:12] my father
[23:13] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[23:15] the father
[23:16] and who is the father but the son
[23:19] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[23:21] and he turned him unto his disciples and
[23:23] said privately
[23:24] blessed are the eyes which see the
[23:26] things that ye see for i tell you that
[23:28] many prophets and kings have desired to
[23:30] see those things which you see
[23:31] and have not seen them and to hear those
[23:33] things which you hear and have not heard
[23:35] them
[23:36] the book of life is definitely located
[23:38] in heaven and will appear at the great
[23:39] white throne judgment
[23:40] in these verses jesus said that their
[23:42] names were written in heaven
[23:44] they were written in the book of life
[23:46] for that is where names are placed
[23:48] jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17
[23:51] but he was also speaking to the 12 in
[23:52] verse 23
[23:54] these had all been rejoicing that devils
[23:56] were subject to them in jesus name
[23:58] christ's rejoinder was rejoice not that
[24:00] spirits are subject to you but rather
[24:02] that your names are written in heaven
[24:04] book of life you will note here that
[24:06] judas was one of those who were casting
[24:08] out devils in jesus name
[24:09] but we know that he was a devil the son
[24:11] of perdition john 6
[24:13] 17 71 says jesus answered them have not
[24:16] i chosen the twelve and one of you as a
[24:18] devil
[24:18] he spake of judas iscariot the son of
[24:20] simon for he it was that should betray
[24:22] him being one of the twelve
[24:24] john 17 12 while i was with them in the
[24:27] world i kept them in thy name
[24:28] those that thou gavest me i have kept
[24:30] and none of them is lost but the son of
[24:32] perdition that the scripture might be
[24:34] fulfilled
[24:35] john 13 10 to 11 and verse 18 jesus
[24:38] saith to him
[24:39] he that is washed needeth not saved to
[24:41] wash his feet but is clean every wit
[24:43] and ye are clean but not all for he knew
[24:45] who should betray him therefore said he
[24:47] you are not all clean
[24:49] i speak not of you all and i know whom i
[24:51] have chosen but that the scripture might
[24:53] be fulfilled he that eateth bread with
[24:55] me hath lifted up his heel against me
[24:57] now if language means anything at all we
[24:59] must admit that judas was chosen by
[25:01] jesus john 13 18.
[25:03] yet he was not clean john 13 10-11
[25:06] judas was also given to jesus by the
[25:08] father john 17 12.
[25:10] let it be noted here that the choosing
[25:12] and giving is the exact parallel as in
[25:14] the illustration of moses and pharaoh
[25:16] jacob and esau for though esau and
[25:18] pharaoh were both foreknown
[25:20] they were predestinated to wrath while
[25:22] the end of moses and jacob was
[25:24] glorification
[25:26] first peter 2 8 9 shows both reprobates
[25:29] and even
[25:29] and elect both shows both reprobates and
[25:32] elect
[25:32] even to them which stumble at the word
[25:34] being disobedient whereunto also they
[25:37] were appointed
[25:38] but ye are a chosen generation
[25:41] judas was numbered with the twelve and
[25:42] actually had a part with them in the
[25:44] ministry
[25:45] previous to pentecost acts 1 16-17 reads
[25:49] men and brethren this scripture must
[25:51] needs have been fulfilled which the holy
[25:53] ghost by the mouth of david spake before
[25:55] concerning judas
[25:56] which was guide to them that took jesus
[25:58] for he was numbered with us
[25:59] and had obtained had obtained part of
[26:01] this ministry
[26:03] the part that judas obtained amongst the
[26:04] twelve and that and then lost was
[26:06] neither inferior to the ministries of
[26:08] the other eleven
[26:09] nor was it a devilish foreign ministry
[26:11] interjected amongst the ministries of
[26:13] the others
[26:14] acts 1 25 that he may take part of this
[26:17] ministry an apostleship from which judas
[26:19] by transgression
[26:20] fell that he might go to his own place
[26:22] judas a devil
[26:24] lost a god-given holy ghost ministry and
[26:26] killed himself
[26:27] and went to his own place his name was
[26:30] even in the book of life but his name
[26:32] was blotted out
[26:34] judas was with the lord judas
[26:38] ate the last supper with the lord judas
[26:40] cast out devils in the name of the lord
[26:43] judas was part of the inner sanctum of
[26:45] the inner sanctum of
[26:47] of the of the disciples of jesus christ
[26:50] but yet judas was a devil from the
[26:52] beginning even having his name on the
[26:53] book of life
[26:54] because he was part of that plant part
[26:56] of the wheat plant he was part of the
[26:57] church
[26:58] and he had his name on that book but
[27:00] because he rejected christ and he fought
[27:02] against the word in that day
[27:06] his name was taken out of that book
[27:10] let's turn to 272
[27:16] 272 the last chapter chapter
[27:20] 3. not chapter paragraph
[27:23] sorry now i'm sure that you have noticed
[27:25] that those whose names were in the book
[27:27] of life were part of the religious order
[27:28] of that day
[27:29] that centered around the true god and
[27:32] worship of him
[27:33] though they did not worship according to
[27:35] truth word
[27:36] now just think about that those that we
[27:38] talked about in exodus that were in the
[27:40] exodus journey were they part of the
[27:41] religious order of that day
[27:43] were they part of the move of god for
[27:45] that day were they part of the move of
[27:47] christ in that day
[27:48] they absolutely were they were part of
[27:51] the religious system of the day they
[27:53] were part
[27:54] they were right where christ was working
[27:55] in that day in the exodus journey with
[27:58] moses a prophet with a pillar of fire
[28:00] with all the signs but just as soon as
[28:02] they rejected the word
[28:03] and they they went into idolatry just
[28:05] the minute that they deviated worship
[28:07] away from god
[28:08] and worshiped in something false their
[28:10] names were blotted out of the book
[28:12] they were part of the church they were
[28:14] there they were worshiping they were
[28:15] doing it all they walked through the red
[28:17] sea
[28:17] they put the blood on the lent on the
[28:19] doorpost they did it all
[28:21] but there come a time when they rejected
[28:23] the truth they rejected the word
[28:25] and went into error when they went into
[28:26] error their name was blotted off of the
[28:28] book
[28:30] same thing happened with judas like
[28:32] judas they didn't go all the way see how
[28:34] judas was chosen of god
[28:36] he was instructed in truth he shared
[28:38] knowledge of the mysteries
[28:39] he had a ministry of power granted unto
[28:41] him and he healed the sick and cast out
[28:43] devils in jesus name
[28:44] but when the showdown came he sold out
[28:46] for gold and political power
[28:48] he did not go up to pentecost to receive
[28:50] the spirit of god he was devoid of the
[28:52] spirit
[28:52] make no mistake about it a person that
[28:54] is truly baptized by the holy ghost into
[28:56] the body of christ
[28:58] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[28:59] will be in the word all the way
[29:02] that is the evidence of being baptized
[29:04] with the holy ghost
[29:06] judas failed multitudes fail right there
[29:09] and then they failed to go on in that
[29:11] word their names are taken off of the
[29:13] book of life
[29:18] all right now this record of the plant
[29:22] there's many categories or different
[29:24] groups that fall unto this record in the
[29:26] book of life
[29:27] the first one that we want to look at is
[29:28] those who are good to the brethren
[29:31] those good to the brethren
[29:35] matthew 25 let's just read this in our
[29:38] bibles matthew 25
[29:42] verse 31
[29:47] this is the parable of the separating of
[29:49] the sheep and the goats
[29:51] and the bible and its judgment and this
[29:53] is the white throne judgment
[29:55] and it's a white throne judgment and
[29:56] jesus is telling it in a parable here
[29:59] matthew 25 31 when the son of man shall
[30:02] come in his glory and the holy angels
[30:04] with him then shall he sit upon the
[30:05] throne of his glory
[30:07] and before him shall be gathered all
[30:08] nations and he shall separate them one
[30:11] from another as a shepherd divideth his
[30:13] sheep from his goats
[30:14] from the goats now it's important if you
[30:17] look
[30:17] at your bible here when it says divideth
[30:20] his sheep from the goats
[30:21] is his written in that talent is it
[30:23] italicized
[30:26] okay if it's italicized that means the
[30:29] the translators of the bible added that
[30:31] word to help with the understanding to
[30:33] make it easier it's not part of the
[30:35] original translation
[30:37] okay and this is important here because
[30:40] they interjected this
[30:41] to make it read like english would read
[30:44] not like greek would read
[30:46] but in their injecting of this is wrong
[30:47] because these are not his sheep we know
[30:49] his sheep are gathered into the
[30:51] into the fold already it's as a shepherd
[30:54] separating
[30:55] sheep and goats these are not his sheep
[31:00] right this is something that the the
[31:03] translators in the king james
[31:04] version added in it's not part of the
[31:06] original greek
[31:08] the original just greek just says as a
[31:10] shepherd separated
[31:11] sheep from goats let's read that again
[31:14] and i'm going to skip the italicized
[31:16] word
[31:18] verse 32 and before him shall be
[31:19] gathered all nations and he shall
[31:20] separate them one from another
[31:22] as a shepherd divideth sheep from the
[31:24] goats
[31:25] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[31:27] hand but the goats on the left
[31:29] then shall the king say unto them on his
[31:31] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[31:33] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[31:35] from the foundation of the world
[31:36] for i was a hunger and then you gave me
[31:38] no meat gave me meat i was thirsty and
[31:40] you gave me drink
[31:41] i was a stranger and you took me in
[31:44] naked and you clothed me
[31:45] i was sick and you visited me i was in
[31:47] prison and you came unto me
[31:49] then shall the righteous answer him
[31:51] saying lord when saul we thee a hungered
[31:53] and fed thee
[31:54] or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw
[31:56] we thee a stranger and took the in or
[31:58] naked and clothed thee
[32:00] our wind saw we thee sick or in prison
[32:02] and came unto thee
[32:04] and the king shall answer and say unto
[32:05] them verily i say unto you and so much
[32:07] as ye have done it unto one
[32:09] of the least of these my brethren you
[32:11] have done it unto me
[32:13] so here the scene is set he's
[32:16] separating it says all nations
[32:19] not just some not just a few all nations
[32:22] this is the white throne judgment
[32:23] and he's separating the righteous from
[32:25] the unrighteous in this judgment
[32:27] and he's placing one on the right hand
[32:28] and one on the left and he starts
[32:29] telling them
[32:30] you're over here because you fed me
[32:34] you clothed me you took me in you
[32:37] visited me you did all these things to
[32:38] me
[32:39] and they didn't even know when they did
[32:40] it when lord did we do this to you
[32:42] we had no idea because they did not
[32:44] recognize the body of the lord
[32:47] they did not recognize what they were
[32:49] doing the same way paul when paul was
[32:51] persecuting the christians
[32:52] he was on the road to damascus and he
[32:54] was struck down by a bright light and
[32:56] that bright light says saul saul why
[32:59] does thou persecute me
[33:00] and he says who are you who am i
[33:03] persecuting i'm persecuting these false
[33:05] doctrine of christians yeah
[33:06] i'm hauling them in the jail and i'm
[33:08] having them stoned and i'm doing all
[33:09] this
[33:10] but who are you and he knows this is the
[33:12] lord because it's the pillar of fire
[33:14] and the lord said i am jesus whom you
[33:16] persecute
[33:18] why because the the body of christ was
[33:21] the church
[33:22] the the the elect seed of that day was
[33:24] the body of christ
[33:25] and whatever you did to them you did to
[33:27] jesus
[33:30] right so if you fed them and you clothed
[33:32] them and you took them in and you
[33:33] visited them and
[33:34] and you did all these things for them
[33:36] you did it to the lord
[33:39] okay that's what he's saying in the
[33:40] judgment but he said they said when did
[33:42] we do this
[33:43] when did we we didn't see you we you
[33:45] weren't around
[33:46] you weren't sick and we never fed you we
[33:49] never did any of this
[33:49] and he said when you did it to the least
[33:51] and these mine brethren so who is he
[33:53] talking to these my brethren
[33:55] he's not it's not those that are before
[33:57] his throne it's not like
[33:58] you sheep did it to each other
[34:02] right it wasn't because this sheep was
[34:04] good to that sheep
[34:06] no he said you did it when you did it to
[34:08] the least of these
[34:11] that are seated with him on the throne
[34:13] when he did the least of these my
[34:15] brother
[34:15] the joint heirs in christ
[34:18] the first born among many brethren the
[34:21] first resurrected from the dead that was
[34:23] going to be the
[34:23] the first of many brethren that would
[34:25] resurrect from the dead all of them
[34:27] being brethren by what
[34:28] new birth in christ these are the
[34:31] brethren the brethren are not before him
[34:33] the brethren are seated with him on his
[34:34] throne
[34:35] they're the thousand times thousand that
[34:37] came to minister unto him
[34:39] they're the ones whom judgment was given
[34:41] to the saints they're the ones
[34:43] who are sitting on the thrones and he
[34:45] said when you did it to these mine
[34:46] brethren you did it to me
[34:49] hallelujah that's where i want to be
[34:52] sitting at white throne judgment
[34:54] i don't know about you but i don't want
[34:56] to be facing him i want to be sitting
[34:58] beside him
[35:00] amen thank god for that mercy
[35:03] let's continue to read
[35:07] 41 then shall he say unto them on the
[35:10] left hand depart from me you cursed
[35:12] unto everlasting fire prepared for the
[35:14] devil and his angels
[35:16] for i was a hunger and you gave me no
[35:17] meat i was thirsty and you gave me no
[35:19] drink i was a stranger and you took me
[35:20] not in
[35:21] naked and you clothed me not sick and in
[35:23] prison and you visited me not
[35:25] then shall they answer him saying lord
[35:27] when saw we thee a
[35:29] or a thirst or a stranger or naked or
[35:33] sick or in prison and did not minister
[35:34] unto these
[35:35] they're saying the same thing same
[35:37] question if i'm going to be condemned
[35:38] into hell i want to know why
[35:41] lord when did you come to us and we
[35:42] didn't take you in when were you here
[35:45] and he says the exact same thing then
[35:47] shall he answer them saying verily i say
[35:49] unto you
[35:50] inasmuch as you did it not to one of the
[35:52] least of these you did it not to me
[35:55] who are the least of these the brethren
[35:59] where who are the brethren the joint
[36:01] heirs
[36:03] amen
[36:06] one of the least of these he did it not
[36:07] to me and these shall go away into
[36:09] everlasting punishment but the righteous
[36:12] into life eternal now this is important
[36:15] they don't have eternal life the same
[36:18] way the bride has eternal life
[36:20] because if you have eternal life like we
[36:22] talked about sunday you cannot die
[36:25] these are the resurrection of the dead
[36:27] we were the resurrection of the dead in
[36:28] christ
[36:29] or those that sleep in the ground
[36:32] because we
[36:33] already hath we already have possessed
[36:36] eternal life because we're the record of
[36:38] the seed and the seed has
[36:40] life within it the plant doesn't have
[36:42] life within it
[36:43] but the seed has life within it this is
[36:46] the record of the word this is the
[36:47] record of christ
[36:48] this is the record of that which can
[36:49] never be blotted out can never pass away
[36:52] this is the record of the brethren
[36:54] hallelujah
[36:56] so we already have we don't have to come
[36:58] into eternal life
[36:59] we already have eternal life but this
[37:01] group does not already
[37:03] have eternal life but they are allowed
[37:05] to come into
[37:07] everlasting life there's a big
[37:10] difference between
[37:10] having life which is zoe life which is a
[37:13] portion that came from god which you
[37:14] possess already
[37:16] right because we have representation
[37:18] from before the foundation of the world
[37:20] where in christ where in god
[37:24] and because it was before the foundation
[37:25] of the world it was before time
[37:29] our life goes back to before time
[37:33] and if it was before time then it's
[37:35] everlasting then it's eternal then it's
[37:37] zoe life
[37:38] and that life was designated to come out
[37:40] in certain ages
[37:42] and in certain times and through certain
[37:43] vessels and it just happened to pop up
[37:45] in you and i
[37:47] but because that life came before time
[37:50] it is not subject to time
[37:51] it cannot die it is eternal life and we
[37:54] already
[37:55] have it but there is a portion of people
[37:58] that are going to let be allowed to come
[38:00] into eternal life
[38:02] meaning after the white throne judgment
[38:03] there is time no more
[38:05] after millennium that ends all time
[38:07] there's no more counting of days there's
[38:09] no more seasons and no more seconds
[38:10] there's no more watch there's no more
[38:12] time and if you have any life beyond
[38:15] time what kind of life is that
[38:18] eternal life not because you always had
[38:20] it from before the foundation of the
[38:22] world
[38:22] but because you were allowed to come
[38:24] into it
[38:26] right after the white throne judgment
[38:30] you're allowed to come into everlasting
[38:33] life
[38:34] hallelujah it says and those shall go
[38:37] away into everlasting punishment
[38:39] but the righteous into they go away into
[38:42] because they go beyond the white throne
[38:44] judgment into new heavens and new earth
[38:47] and so they go into life eternal
[38:52] all right let's keep moving let's look
[38:55] at
[38:55] page 277 in the church book
[39:04] 277 paragraph two
[39:09] we now face the question as to why they
[39:11] should be given eternal life at the
[39:13] judgment since the epistles seem to
[39:15] exclusively point out that one must
[39:16] possess the spirit of christ or perish
[39:19] that's a very important statement
[39:22] how is it that they're allowed to come
[39:24] into eternal life when the epistles when
[39:25] the scriptures make it very clear
[39:28] that the path to eternal life or the
[39:30] being sealed until the day of redemption
[39:32] is to have the spirit of christ or to be
[39:34] baptized in the spirit or be concealed
[39:36] by the holy ghost
[39:37] so how are these allowed to come into
[39:40] eternal life
[39:40] not having been sealed with the holy
[39:42] ghost
[39:44] they must possess the spirit of christ
[39:46] or perish though it seems thus we must
[39:48] not discredit the words of jesus
[39:50] who most pointedly sets forth that there
[39:51] are some found in the book of life
[39:53] who will either receive eternal life
[39:55] before the general resurrection
[39:56] or after it paul does not evade this
[39:59] truth for most clearly he says in
[40:01] philippians 3 11 if by any means i might
[40:04] attain unto the resurrection of the dead
[40:06] now this statement is most peculiar we
[40:08] all know that we all
[40:10] we are all going to be in the
[40:12] resurrection whether we want to be or
[40:13] not
[40:14] all will be resurrected so paul could
[40:16] hardly be saying if by any means i might
[40:18] attain to a resurrection of the dead
[40:20] the truth of the matter is he's not
[40:22] saying that the literal reading is if by
[40:24] any means i might attain to the out
[40:25] resurrection from among the dead
[40:28] this is not the attaining to the general
[40:29] or second resurrection but attaining to
[40:31] the first resurrection
[40:32] of which it said blessed and holy is he
[40:34] that hath part in the first resurrection
[40:36] on such the second death hath no power
[40:39] but they shall be priest of god and of
[40:41] christ and shall reign with him a
[40:42] thousand years
[40:44] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[40:46] with the second death
[40:47] that is at the end of the thousand years
[40:49] when all the rest of the dead
[40:51] live again and in that day there will be
[40:53] those who come forth to eternal life
[40:56] and those others who are caught in the
[40:58] second death
[40:59] now we do not need to guess about those
[41:01] who in the second resurrection or given
[41:02] life
[41:03] we are told it is given to them on the
[41:05] grounds that they have been kind and
[41:06] good to the brethren
[41:08] those who are raised and cast into the
[41:10] lake of fire will be so treated because
[41:11] their treatment of the brethren
[41:13] since this is the word of god we simply
[41:15] accept it there is no
[41:17] argument here just a simple statement of
[41:20] fact
[41:21] to further clarify notice specifically
[41:23] the words of matthew 25
[41:26] 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is
[41:29] literally separating sheep
[41:30] from goats but it is as a shepherd
[41:33] divided sheep from goats these are not
[41:36] sheep in this particular area of time
[41:38] white throne judgment
[41:39] the sheep are in his fold they heard his
[41:41] voice word
[41:42] and they followed him they already have
[41:45] eternal life and cannot come into the
[41:46] judgment
[41:47] but these do not have eternal life and
[41:49] they are in the judgment
[41:51] they are allowed to go into eternal life
[41:53] but upon what grounds do they enter into
[41:55] life eternal
[41:56] certainly not upon the fact that they
[41:58] already have his life as does the bride
[42:00] but they receive it because they were
[42:01] kind to his brethren
[42:03] they are not his brethren that would
[42:05] make them joint heirs with jesus they
[42:07] are not
[42:07] heirs to anything but life they share no
[42:10] throne etc with them
[42:11] their names must have been in the book
[42:13] of life and not removed
[42:15] now because of their love of the people
[42:16] of god they are recognized and saved
[42:19] no doubt these served and helped the
[42:21] children of god perhaps like nicodemus
[42:23] and gamaliel
[42:24] they stood for the children in a time of
[42:26] trouble
[42:27] amen that is mercy
[42:32] that is what mercy looks like there's a
[42:35] whole group of people
[42:36] that are going to be given entrance into
[42:37] the kingdom they're going to come into
[42:39] eternal life
[42:40] beyond time why because
[42:44] they were part of the support system
[42:46] helping the seed come forth
[42:48] that in a time of trouble they stood for
[42:50] the seed in a time of trouble
[42:52] they helped christ christ too christ and
[42:55] you and i
[42:56] and if they do not reject that life if
[42:59] do they not speak against that life
[43:01] if do they not if they don't fight
[43:03] against that life or call it beelzebub
[43:05] or call it an evil spirit
[43:06] or call to the man-made religion if they
[43:08] don't say any nasty
[43:10] degrading things about it then their
[43:12] name will not be blotted off of the book
[43:13] of life
[43:15] but no matter how many times they help
[43:17] and uh
[43:18] aid and support the life if they begin
[43:21] to reject that same life
[43:24] wherever that life is found whether it
[43:25] be in you whether it be in me whether it
[43:27] be
[43:28] in brother branham whether it be in any
[43:29] other seed of god if they begin to
[43:31] reject that word they begin to reject
[43:33] that life
[43:34] then their name will be blotted off of
[43:35] the book of life
[43:38] unless your name is recorded in the seed
[43:41] part of the book of life that can never
[43:42] be blotted off
[43:44] you could be like saul who became the
[43:47] apostle paul
[43:48] you can hate it you can fight against it
[43:50] you can breathe
[43:51] vehement words against it but god
[43:54] will turn you around why because your
[43:57] name can't be blotted off the book
[44:00] hallelujah hey amen
[44:03] if it's the case that anybody who ever
[44:05] speaks against the message their name
[44:07] would be blotted off the book of life
[44:08] my name would have been bought it off
[44:10] the book of life because i didn't always
[44:12] say nice things about the message
[44:14] when i first saw it but because i had
[44:17] the same thing in me
[44:18] that the apostle paul had laying in him
[44:20] when he was persecuting the church
[44:22] god had to come down and reveal this
[44:24] message to me personally
[44:26] because i was part of that record of
[44:28] eternal life that could not be blotted
[44:30] out
[44:30] because it could not be blotted out he
[44:32] had to open my eyes
[44:36] paul said i did it i persecuted church
[44:38] but i did it ignorantly
[44:40] right he didn't know that this was the
[44:42] church of god he didn't know that this
[44:44] was christ
[44:45] and so because he did it ignorantly not
[44:47] knowing what it was
[44:48] being part of the seed life being part
[44:50] of eternal life being part of christ
[44:52] he was forgiven for that and god opened
[44:55] his eyes and he was able to repent
[44:57] but there are those who are not part of
[44:58] that record that do it ignorantly also
[45:01] but they will not be excused for
[45:03] persecuting christ
[45:04] ignorantly the pharisees did it many of
[45:07] them did it ignorantly
[45:08] those that were shouting at the judgment
[45:10] seat of pilate they were saying away
[45:12] with him
[45:13] crucify him give us barabbas most of
[45:15] them were doing it
[45:16] ignorantly but if they were not on the
[45:18] record of eternal life if they were not
[45:20] the seed portion
[45:21] of the lamb's book of life they are not
[45:23] given repentance for that their name is
[45:25] blotted off of the lamb's book of life
[45:29] what changes all the rules the election
[45:31] of god
[45:33] changes all the rules
[45:36] who can get away with murder the elect
[45:40] they have david did
[45:47] who's the favorite children
[45:50] the elect they can get away with murder
[45:54] they can get away with blasphemy
[45:57] the unpardonable sin paul was committing
[46:00] that
[46:02] how could paul get away from blasphemy
[46:04] but for anybody else who blasphemes it's
[46:07] the impartable sin
[46:10] because paul was part of christ
[46:13] because he was part of christ when
[46:15] christ went to calvary
[46:17] he already bled and died for paul's
[46:19] blasphemy
[46:23] amen praise god i love this revelation
[46:30] some people hate this revelation they
[46:31] get so mad when you talk about this
[46:33] and it makes me wonder what part of the
[46:35] book do you see yourself
[46:36] in if you're so angry about this what
[46:39] part of the book are you in
[46:40] because if i'm in the park of the record
[46:42] of eternal life or the seed coming forth
[46:44] the part of christ the bride
[46:46] i love this revelation i love this word
[46:50] i i can't be stupid enough to get myself
[46:53] out of it
[46:55] i can't be so ignorant or so vile or so
[46:58] messed up that i'm somehow going to miss
[47:00] the rapture
[47:00] it's an impossibility because i was in
[47:03] christ when he was hanging on the cross
[47:06] hallelujah i love this
[47:10] amen all right
[47:15] mark 9 41 says for whosoever shall give
[47:18] you a cup of water to drink in my name
[47:20] because ye belong to christ verily i say
[47:22] unto you he shall
[47:24] not lose his reward
[47:27] why because he was a great christian
[47:30] because he did great sacrifices because
[47:32] he went to church every sunday
[47:33] because he gave a cup of cold water
[47:37] matthew 10 42 and whosoever shall give
[47:39] to drink unto one of these little ones a
[47:41] cup of cold water only in the name of a
[47:42] disciple
[47:44] verily i say unto you he shall in no
[47:46] wise
[47:47] lose his reward
[47:50] what if your neighbor mows your grass
[47:51] for you while you're sick
[47:54] what if somebody helps you out of a
[47:55] ditch
[47:57] what's going to happen if they do not
[48:00] reject the word
[48:03] they will not lose their reward if they
[48:05] do not reject the word of god
[48:07] they will not lose their reward
[48:12] 1956 brother preaches elisha the prophet
[48:15] and so this woman had seen god and
[48:17] elijah and she said
[48:18] i think it's nice now if we do something
[48:20] for this servant of god
[48:22] god will respect it why she was just a
[48:24] few hundred years ahead of time
[48:25] jesus said if you give one of my
[48:27] disciples a cup of cold water at the
[48:29] judgment it won't be forgotten
[48:31] we fail to see the power that god has
[48:34] placed in his people
[48:36] the power of what the power to pardon
[48:38] sins
[48:42] these people are aren't righteous they
[48:44] are not they are not living for christ
[48:46] they are not con
[48:47] have a confession of christ they are
[48:50] treating the brethren good
[48:54] and what's happening they are receiving
[48:56] a pardon for their sins
[48:57] and allowed to come into eternal life
[49:00] why because we're not just people
[49:04] we're not just what you see in the
[49:06] mirror there's more to us than what the
[49:08] eye beholds
[49:09] because if we came from christ and we're
[49:11] going back to christ then that means we
[49:13] are
[49:13] christ the anointed word for the hour
[49:17] and how you treat the word how you treat
[49:19] christ
[49:20] amen is what will be brought up on the
[49:23] day of judgment at the great white
[49:24] throne judgment
[49:25] not how many nice deeds you did and how
[49:27] many cups of coffee you gave
[49:29] but how you treated the word and the
[49:31] form that the word came in
[49:33] which was the brethren
[49:36] hallelujah we fail to see the power that
[49:39] god has placed in his people
[49:41] god is in his people you believe that
[49:43] god was with his people one time when he
[49:45] walked on the earth
[49:45] but now god is in his people a little
[49:48] while the world sees me no more yet
[49:50] you'll see me for i personal pronoun
[49:53] will be
[49:53] with you with and in you to the end of
[49:56] the world
[49:58] who's in you christ is in you that's why
[50:01] it matters
[50:02] that's why it matters that somebody
[50:05] visits you
[50:06] feeds you cares for you why
[50:10] because it's christ amen
[50:16] the book of life the plant we have those
[50:19] that were good to the brethren
[50:20] that are part of this book of life and
[50:23] the souls that are under the altar and
[50:25] the fifth seal the jews
[50:27] so let's take a quick look at this
[50:29] revelations chapter 6
[50:31] verse 9 to 11 and when he had opened the
[50:33] fifth seal
[50:34] i saw under the altar the souls of them
[50:36] that were slain for the word of god and
[50:37] for the testimony which they held
[50:39] now if you recognize it's not the
[50:42] testimony of jesus christ
[50:43] it is for the word of god and the
[50:45] testimony that they held
[50:46] these are jews and they cried with a
[50:49] loud voice saying how long o lord
[50:51] holy and true dost thou not judge and
[50:52] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[50:54] the earth
[50:55] and white robes were given unto every
[50:56] one of them and it was said unto them
[50:58] that they should rest yet for a little
[51:00] season until their fellow servants also
[51:02] and their brethren that should be killed
[51:04] as they were
[51:05] should be fulfilled church age book 273.
[51:30] i'm going to skip a little bit because
[51:31] we've already read this
[51:35] okay in the first paragraph on 274
[51:39] right past the italicized sentence that
[51:41] said let them be blotted out of the book
[51:42] of the living
[51:43] we're going to start at the next
[51:44] sentence when the jews rejected jesus
[51:47] there was a literal turning away of god
[51:49] from them to the gentiles
[51:50] acts 13 46-48 then paul and barnabas wax
[51:54] bold and said
[51:55] it was necessary that the word of god
[51:56] should first have been spoken to you
[51:59] what was spoken to them what was paul
[52:01] and barnabas speaking to the jews
[52:04] the word of god not
[52:08] they weren't quoting out of the torah
[52:11] they were bringing the revelation of
[52:12] what was written in the torah of jesus
[52:14] christ slain
[52:16] and they were preaching to them what to
[52:17] them looked like a new doctrine
[52:19] well to them looked like something
[52:21] outside of the word that was given to
[52:23] them
[52:23] but paul being a prophet could come down
[52:25] and paul and barnabas being apostles
[52:27] could come down
[52:28] and begin to share what they had what
[52:30] they knew
[52:31] and to the jews it looked like extra
[52:33] scriptures
[52:35] but paul said it's the word of god
[52:40] he said it was necessary that the word
[52:42] of god should first have been spoken to
[52:43] you
[52:44] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[52:46] yourselves
[52:47] unworthy of everlasting life how did
[52:50] they judge themselves unworthy of
[52:51] everlasting life
[52:52] they rejected the word of god what word
[52:55] of god they reject
[52:56] they rejected the word of god that paul
[52:58] and barnabas was preaching
[53:00] they were not rejecting what was written
[53:01] in the scroll
[53:03] what they had been repeating since they
[53:05] were a child what they had learned in
[53:06] the bible verse
[53:07] they weren't knowingly rejecting that
[53:08] even though they were because that was a
[53:10] foreshadow of things to come
[53:11] but the thing is they didn't know they
[53:13] were rejecting the word of god
[53:15] right because they were reading the
[53:17] torah they were reading the
[53:18] manuscripts they were reading those
[53:20] things and quoting those verses and
[53:21] preaching from those
[53:22] but something came that was not
[53:24] according to their customs
[53:26] something came that they were not used
[53:28] to hearing and when it came from a man
[53:31] they thought the problem was with paul
[53:34] and they thought they were rejecting
[53:35] paul
[53:36] but they were not rejecting paul and
[53:37] they were not rejecting barnabas
[53:39] they were rejecting god because they
[53:41] were rejecting the word of god
[53:42] and when they rejected the word of god
[53:44] that they deemed themselves
[53:46] unworthy of everlasting life
[53:50] what would have made them worthy of
[53:51] everlasting life receiving the word of
[53:54] god
[53:55] not works not deeds not all these things
[53:57] like jumping through hoops but receiving
[53:59] and believing in the word of god
[54:01] would have made them worthy of
[54:03] everlasting life
[54:05] aren't you glad it's that easy
[54:08] all right because you judge yourselves
[54:12] unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn
[54:14] to the gentiles
[54:15] for so hat the lord commanded us saying
[54:17] i have set thee to be a light of the
[54:18] gentiles
[54:19] that thou should just be for salvation
[54:20] to the ends of the earth and when the
[54:22] gentiles heard this they were glad
[54:24] and glorified the word of the lord and
[54:25] as many as were ordained to eternal life
[54:28] believed not every one of them believed
[54:32] but those that were ordained to eternal
[54:34] life those are the ones who believed
[54:37] why they deemed themselves worthy of
[54:39] everlasting life
[54:42] hallelujah next paragraph this is not to
[54:46] suggest that there will be no more names
[54:48] from the tribes of israel remaining in
[54:49] the book of life
[54:50] for many of these but not multitudes
[54:53] through the principle of election will
[54:55] be in the gentile church age
[54:57] right like paul and like peter and like
[54:59] john and like all the disciples were
[55:00] jews
[55:01] right but according to election they
[55:03] were elected in the seed portion of the
[55:05] book of life
[55:06] the lamb's book of life so when christ
[55:08] came they received christ
[55:11] signifying proving they could receive
[55:12] the word for their day the
[55:14] word of the hour proving that they were
[55:16] part of this record of eternal life
[55:17] and they they became part of the gentile
[55:20] church age
[55:24] and came into the body of jesus christ
[55:26] showing that their names did indeed
[55:27] remain in the book of life
[55:29] also as we will show according to the
[55:31] fifth seal multitudes of martyred jews
[55:33] will be given
[55:34] white robes and eternal life by the lord
[55:36] also the 144 000 will be sealed at his
[55:39] coming
[55:39] proving that their names were not
[55:41] deleted either but it is even as most
[55:43] accurately set forth in psalm 69 psalm
[55:46] 69 was the one we read earlier
[55:48] about the jews that had rejected christ
[55:51] that it is the wicked or unrighteous
[55:53] rejecters of christ
[55:55] and the destroyers of his people whose
[55:57] names are removed
[55:59] those whose names are removed let's go
[56:02] over to 278.
[56:06] just jump over to 278.
[56:11] and in 278 we're going to read the very
[56:13] last paragraph
[56:15] at the bottom it is the second
[56:17] resurrection
[56:18] the second resurrection is the one that
[56:20] leads the white throne judgment
[56:22] it is the second resurrection that the
[56:23] souls under the altar as set forth in
[56:25] the fifth seal
[56:26] are given white robes
[56:29] they're given their white robes why
[56:31] because they're given entrance into the
[56:32] kingdom
[56:34] they're given entrance into eternal life
[56:36] and they're given their white thrones
[56:37] when you read the fifth seal it looks
[56:39] like they're given their white thrones
[56:40] right then while they wait for their
[56:41] brethren to be killed
[56:42] but brother branham's saying they
[56:43] receive their white thrones when at the
[56:45] they receive their white robes at the
[56:47] judgment right
[56:49] they're given white robes and of course
[56:51] eternal life or there would be no point
[56:53] of white robes
[56:54] and when he had opened the fifth seal i
[56:56] saw under the altar of the souls of them
[56:58] that were slain for the word of god and
[56:59] for their testimony which they held
[57:01] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[57:02] how long o lord holy and true does thou
[57:04] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[57:06] that dwell on the earth
[57:07] and white robes were given unto every
[57:09] one of them and it was said unto them
[57:11] that they should rest yet for a little
[57:12] season until their fellow servants also
[57:14] and their brethren that should be killed
[57:16] as they were
[57:17] should be fulfilled now note
[57:19] particularly that none of these under
[57:21] the altar were killed for the testimony
[57:22] to jesus
[57:23] they were not like antipas who was slain
[57:25] for holding fast his name
[57:27] these are not born again ones with
[57:28] eternal life as their possession
[57:30] they come up in the resurrection and
[57:31] receive life because of their stand on
[57:33] the word
[57:34] see that because of their stand on the
[57:37] word
[57:37] and notice how these are crying out for
[57:39] vengeance they cannot be bride material
[57:42] the bride turns the cheek in christ
[57:43] forgive them father they know not what
[57:45] they do
[57:46] these are jews they have to be because
[57:48] they are in the physio and it is in the
[57:49] four seal that the gentile bride is gone
[57:51] in the rapture
[57:52] so these jews aren't born of his spirit
[57:54] they don't even believe that jesus is
[57:56] the messiah
[57:57] but as they were blinded by god for the
[57:59] gentile sake god gave them eternal life
[58:02] on the grounds that they
[58:03] that though they could not come to him
[58:06] yet they were truly faithful to all the
[58:08] word they knew
[58:09] and died for it as multitudes died under
[58:11] hitler stalin etc
[58:12] and will yet die
[58:15] these did not even know jesus was the
[58:18] messiah
[58:21] do not even have faith in the cross of
[58:24] calvary
[58:27] have no faith in the atonement have no
[58:29] faith in jesus
[58:30] and don't recognize him as savior
[58:35] but because god blinded them so that he
[58:37] could turn
[58:39] to the gentiles if they hold fast to the
[58:42] portion of the word that they can see
[58:44] because god is blinding them to the
[58:46] portion they can't see
[58:48] if they hold fast to that they will be
[58:50] given entrance into eternal life
[58:54] that is mercy
[58:58] now the question is why why
[59:02] because you see the wisdom of god this
[59:04] is the record of the wheat plant
[59:05] and god had laid down in the bible
[59:07] prophecies that have to be fulfilled
[59:09] about the regathering of israel in the
[59:11] last day
[59:12] that the nation will be regathered
[59:14] before christ can return
[59:15] they have to be gathered they have to
[59:16] have an economy they have to have a
[59:18] military they have to have
[59:20] a government they have to have all these
[59:22] things so that christ can come and the
[59:23] two witnesses can come and call out the
[59:25] 144 thousand
[59:26] so that the nation can be born in a day
[59:28] so that they can come to repentance
[59:31] and recognize the atonement 144 thousand
[59:34] so that's impossible unless god would
[59:37] keep
[59:38] a portion of the jews faithful to that
[59:40] portion of the word all down through
[59:42] time
[59:43] for 2 000 years because in order for it
[59:45] to be a regathering
[59:47] judaism can't disperse and intermingle
[59:49] and become like all the other nations
[59:50] they have to be distinct and separate
[59:52] in every nation that they find
[59:54] themselves in they have to hold their
[59:55] relo
[59:56] religion they have to hold to their
[59:58] customs so that the word of god can be
[1:00:00] fulfilled
[1:00:01] so that there's something remaining so
[1:00:03] that when we get to the end of time
[1:00:05] there can be a regathering out of all
[1:00:06] nations and
[1:00:07] and all the prophecy can be fulfilled so
[1:00:09] that the 144 000 can be in place
[1:00:11] so that the two prophets can come so
[1:00:13] that the nation can be born in a day
[1:00:17] so god has to have jews as placeholders
[1:00:21] holding the religion holding the desire
[1:00:24] for the homeland
[1:00:25] holding the promises out of the bible
[1:00:29] they're just placeholders holding
[1:00:31] they're not the 144 000 elect
[1:00:33] they're not elect but they're on the on
[1:00:36] the book of life
[1:00:37] and if they hold that place so that the
[1:00:38] prophecy can be fulfilled
[1:00:40] what are they doing they're supporting
[1:00:41] life they're supporting the coming forth
[1:00:44] of the eternal life
[1:00:45] they're supporting the coming forth of
[1:00:46] the 144 000 elect
[1:00:49] and if they do it faithfully without
[1:00:52] rejecting the word of god
[1:00:54] their names are not taken off the book
[1:00:56] of life and they're given entrance into
[1:00:58] eternal life
[1:00:59] for what being placeholders why god
[1:01:01] needed them
[1:01:03] they're not elect they're not in christ
[1:01:06] but they're holding the position that
[1:01:07] god wants them to hold
[1:01:08] so that his work can be fulfilled so
[1:01:11] that that seed life can come in its
[1:01:13] appointed time
[1:01:14] and if they do it faithfully they will
[1:01:17] be given
[1:01:18] eternal life that's mercy
[1:01:22] that's beautiful now what about those
[1:01:26] who have been faithful to the word
[1:01:27] they've been blinded but they're
[1:01:28] faithful to the word
[1:01:29] and then them two witnesses come and
[1:01:31] begin to speak of christ and show the
[1:01:33] atonement of calvary
[1:01:34] what if those alive in that day reject
[1:01:36] that their names are blotted off of the
[1:01:39] book of life
[1:01:40] because they're rejecting the word when
[1:01:42] it's made manifest before them
[1:01:45] alrighty
[1:01:49] now we'll look at the last group we have
[1:01:51] those that are good to the brethren
[1:01:53] we have souls on the altar and we have
[1:01:55] the foolish virgin
[1:01:59] let's go to matthew 25.
[1:02:08] matthew 25 verse 1
[1:02:12] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:02:13] likened unto ten virgins which took
[1:02:15] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:02:17] bridegroom
[1:02:18] and five of them were wise and five were
[1:02:20] foolish
[1:02:22] what made them wise and what made them
[1:02:24] foolish let's read
[1:02:26] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:02:27] and took no oil with them
[1:02:29] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:02:31] with their lamps
[1:02:33] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:02:34] slumbered and slept and at midnight
[1:02:36] there was a cry made behold the
[1:02:37] bridegroom cometh
[1:02:38] go you out to meet him then all those
[1:02:41] virgins arose and trim their lamps
[1:02:43] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:02:44] us of your oil for our lamps are going
[1:02:46] out
[1:02:47] but the wise answer is saying not so
[1:02:48] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:02:50] but go ye rather to them that sell and
[1:02:52] buy for yourselves
[1:02:54] and while they went to buy the
[1:02:55] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[1:02:57] went in with him to the marriage
[1:02:59] and the door was shut this is the first
[1:03:02] resurrection
[1:03:04] the wise who have oil or those who have
[1:03:06] the holy ghost at the time of his coming
[1:03:07] have the baptism of the holy ghost are
[1:03:09] baptized into the body that are part of
[1:03:11] christ
[1:03:12] and at his first coming they go into the
[1:03:13] marriage supper with him
[1:03:15] they go and the door is closed and this
[1:03:17] is the first resurrection
[1:03:21] eleven afterward came also the other
[1:03:23] virgin saying lord lord
[1:03:24] open to us but he answered and said
[1:03:26] verily i say unto you i know you not
[1:03:29] watch therefore for you know neither the
[1:03:31] day nor the hour
[1:03:32] where the son of man cometh so
[1:03:37] in this parable they're left out of the
[1:03:39] first resurrection
[1:03:41] why because they don't have the baptism
[1:03:43] of the holy ghost
[1:03:45] they're not sealed let's look at
[1:03:48] page 279 in the church age book
[1:03:51] 279 where we finished we're going to
[1:03:54] read in the second paragraph
[1:03:57] it is the second resurrection
[1:03:58] resurrection wherein the five foolish
[1:04:00] virgins come up
[1:04:02] notice they were virgins they did not
[1:04:03] have the holy spirit so they missed
[1:04:05] being in the bride
[1:04:06] while the five wise had who had oil
[1:04:09] became part of that bride
[1:04:10] but these people being a separated god
[1:04:12] loving people and trying to abide in the
[1:04:14] word
[1:04:15] according to what they knew of it and
[1:04:17] being a a help in the work of the lord
[1:04:20] will come up at the end of time they
[1:04:22] will miss the millennium
[1:04:23] which you can begin to see by these
[1:04:25] truths is much more important and
[1:04:26] wonderful
[1:04:27] than we have ever thought or believed
[1:04:31] they missed the millennium but the
[1:04:32] foolish virgin they didn't they weren't
[1:04:34] sealed they weren't part of christ they
[1:04:36] didn't have the baptism of the holy
[1:04:37] ghost
[1:04:37] they cannot go in the first resurrection
[1:04:40] but they will go in the second
[1:04:41] resurrection
[1:04:42] and he says here they are god-loving
[1:04:44] people
[1:04:45] and trying to abide in the word they're
[1:04:47] trying to abide in the word but they're
[1:04:48] not abiding into the word because they
[1:04:49] don't have the revelation of the word
[1:04:51] but they're trying to abide in the word
[1:04:53] so these aren't people who just want to
[1:04:55] live any old kind of life
[1:04:56] these are virgin clean living people and
[1:04:58] brother brahm said pure of heart
[1:05:00] they're wanting to serve god trying to
[1:05:02] do what's right but they have not been
[1:05:03] given the revelation on the word so
[1:05:04] they're not able to keep all the word
[1:05:07] okay
[1:05:10] according to what they knew of it and
[1:05:12] being a help in the work of the lord
[1:05:14] they were a help in the work of the lord
[1:05:16] how are they helping the work of the
[1:05:17] lord
[1:05:18] the same way that the stalk and the
[1:05:19] tassel and the and everything else is a
[1:05:21] help in the work of the lord
[1:05:23] because it's helping to bring forth the
[1:05:24] life that's in the seed
[1:05:27] there's so precious few seed that the
[1:05:29] seed can't do all the work by themselves
[1:05:34] the seed can't do all the missionary
[1:05:35] works all the outreach all the
[1:05:36] evangelistic work
[1:05:38] right and we were seed and many of us
[1:05:40] are seed
[1:05:41] but where did we come from
[1:05:45] where did we come from it came from the
[1:05:47] lutheran church
[1:05:49] came from the nazarene church came from
[1:05:51] the baptist church
[1:05:52] came from the wesleyan church came from
[1:05:54] the catholic church
[1:05:55] came from came from came from came from
[1:05:57] where these are all those that are
[1:05:59] trying to do the work of the lord and
[1:06:01] what they're doing is becoming part of
[1:06:02] the plant
[1:06:03] supporting the life so that you and i
[1:06:05] could hear the gospel somewhere and be
[1:06:07] attracted to this and keep moving on in
[1:06:09] christ
[1:06:09] until one day we hear the message and
[1:06:11] then we come to it
[1:06:13] right but there's so few
[1:06:16] seed that we can't do the big missionary
[1:06:20] works
[1:06:21] can't do the big bible printing can't do
[1:06:24] all the things that god wants to do to
[1:06:26] get the word out so that the elect can
[1:06:28] grab it
[1:06:29] amen so they are a help in the work of
[1:06:32] the lord
[1:06:32] just the same way that the stalk is a
[1:06:34] help in the work of the lord the same
[1:06:35] way the tassel is helping in the work of
[1:06:37] the lord
[1:06:38] is they're part of the plant helping to
[1:06:41] reproduce
[1:06:42] the seed life or to support it has come
[1:06:45] through
[1:06:45] and as long as they work in that role
[1:06:47] just like the jews who were place
[1:06:48] holders all the way down through 2000
[1:06:50] years
[1:06:50] as long as they're faithful to that work
[1:06:52] without rejecting the seed life
[1:06:56] without rejecting the word of god
[1:06:58] without rejecting the true believers
[1:07:00] without fighting them or coming against
[1:07:01] them or calling it
[1:07:03] an unholy thing then their name will
[1:07:05] remain on the book of life
[1:07:08] and at the day of judgment they will be
[1:07:09] given entrance into eternal life
[1:07:13] that is a whole lot more mercy amen
[1:07:19] and they say we're an exclusive bunch
[1:07:22] there's a whole bunch of people coming
[1:07:24] in
[1:07:26] they're just not coming in the first
[1:07:27] resurrection and they're not going to be
[1:07:28] part of the millennial reign of christ
[1:07:30] they're not the brethren they're not
[1:07:32] joint heirs they are not the bride of
[1:07:34] jesus christ
[1:07:35] but there's going to be multitudes and
[1:07:38] multitudes
[1:07:39] and multitudes that come in at the white
[1:07:41] throne judgment
[1:07:44] i think it's important to note and i'll
[1:07:45] just interject it right here
[1:07:47] what what are those in the record of the
[1:07:51] plant life
[1:07:52] doing they're supporting and helping the
[1:07:55] seed
[1:07:57] whether it be printing bibles and
[1:07:58] sending them all over the world whether
[1:08:00] it be having missionary works that go
[1:08:01] out all over the world or evangelistic
[1:08:03] works that go out all over the world
[1:08:04] so that seed can come up through there
[1:08:06] and then move on to further light
[1:08:09] or whether they're there to give them a
[1:08:10] cup of cold water or whether they're
[1:08:12] there to help them out of a ditch or
[1:08:13] whether they're there to take care of
[1:08:14] them when they're sick
[1:08:15] or visit them in prison or whatever or
[1:08:18] whether the jews is the placeholder
[1:08:19] holding forth the place of judaism so
[1:08:21] that god can restore the word
[1:08:23] if whatever they're doing they're
[1:08:25] supporting the seed life
[1:08:28] all right so let's get over to
[1:08:32] new heavens and new earth
[1:08:35] what does this group do with new heavens
[1:08:37] and new earth
[1:08:39] the same thing they've always done they
[1:08:42] support
[1:08:43] life in the city because they bring
[1:08:46] their glory
[1:08:47] and their honor into the city
[1:08:50] amen they don't dwell
[1:08:53] in the city the only ones who dwell in
[1:08:55] the city are the elect
[1:08:58] so these that come into eternal life
[1:09:00] they're they're not
[1:09:01] city dwellers but they're allowed to
[1:09:03] come into the city because the leaves of
[1:09:05] the tree of life are for the healing of
[1:09:06] the nations
[1:09:07] so they can come in and they can partake
[1:09:09] of the tree of life and they come in and
[1:09:10] what do they do
[1:09:11] they bring their glory and honor they
[1:09:14] bring their goods they bring whatever
[1:09:16] fruits and vegetables who knows what
[1:09:17] that means
[1:09:18] but they bring their glory and honor as
[1:09:21] as an
[1:09:21] offering as a gift they bring it into
[1:09:23] the city they are supporting city life
[1:09:26] because in that great city the bride
[1:09:27] doesn't leave the city
[1:09:30] none of the elect leave that city they
[1:09:32] remain in the city with christ forever
[1:09:34] but the rest of those that have been
[1:09:37] saved at the white throne judgment and
[1:09:38] given entrance into eternal life
[1:09:40] they don't live in the city they live
[1:09:42] outside the city that's the nations
[1:09:44] that's the kings right in the book of
[1:09:47] revelations talked about the kings
[1:09:49] and the nations coming into the city
[1:09:52] they come and bring their glory and
[1:09:53] honor into the city
[1:09:54] they're doing the same thing that
[1:09:56] they've always done
[1:09:58] supporting the seed life
[1:10:02] amen the revelation that god opened
[1:10:06] under the seven seals makes absolute
[1:10:08] perfect sense
[1:10:11] hallelujah i've never heard an
[1:10:14] explanation that ever made as much sense
[1:10:15] as this one
[1:10:19] questions and answers 1961 let's see
[1:10:22] brother branham what happens to the
[1:10:24] people that are considered the sleeping
[1:10:25] virgin when they are judged at the
[1:10:26] judgment
[1:10:27] well the sleeping virgin will be saved
[1:10:29] of course she'll be saved
[1:10:31] at the judgment she'll never be the
[1:10:34] bride but she is a saved group of people
[1:10:36] that will come in the judgment
[1:10:37] that will not be included in the bride
[1:10:39] but as long as they are virgins they are
[1:10:41] before god see
[1:10:42] they are to be saved he separates
[1:10:45] they'll be the sheep on his right hand
[1:10:46] and the unsaved will be the goats on his
[1:10:48] left
[1:10:48] at the great at the great white throne
[1:10:51] judgment so he says they're going to be
[1:10:52] saved
[1:10:53] when are they going to be saved at the
[1:10:54] judgment they'll be saved
[1:10:57] see it depends on what you term
[1:10:59] salvation
[1:11:00] if salvation is not going into the lake
[1:11:02] of fire
[1:11:03] then they're saved then the ones under
[1:11:05] the altar are saved
[1:11:06] and those are good to the brethren are
[1:11:07] saved but if saved for you
[1:11:11] means going in the rapture they're not
[1:11:13] saved
[1:11:15] see the difference what are you calling
[1:11:18] saved
[1:11:19] are you calling safe not going into lake
[1:11:21] of fire then they're saved
[1:11:23] are you calling saved born again they're
[1:11:25] not saved
[1:11:27] all right that's why there's so much
[1:11:29] confusion sometimes because what are we
[1:11:31] talking about saved from what
[1:11:34] saved from judgment then they're not
[1:11:36] saved saved
[1:11:38] you know born again they're not that
[1:11:40] saved from eternal damnation yes
[1:11:42] they are saved
[1:11:45] when at the white throne judgment
[1:11:50] 1963 questions and answers on the seals
[1:11:54] they the church the people that's in
[1:11:55] denominations are genuine christians who
[1:11:57] receives the message
[1:11:59] and they will never see it so he's
[1:12:01] saying that the message is going out and
[1:12:03] they'll never see it
[1:12:06] it'll never be preached to them so
[1:12:08] there's a group of people in this in
[1:12:09] this foolish virgin
[1:12:10] that the message will never be preached
[1:12:12] to them they'll never hear it
[1:12:16] and those in a mixed crowd who it is
[1:12:18] preached to
[1:12:19] it'll go right over the top of their
[1:12:21] heads unless their name was on the
[1:12:22] lamb's book of life
[1:12:25] he's talking about that seed portion of
[1:12:27] the book of life unless their names are
[1:12:28] in there
[1:12:29] even if they sit there and it's preached
[1:12:30] to them it'll go right over their heads
[1:12:33] right but they will be good people
[1:12:36] and they'll be raised up again and given
[1:12:38] trial and be judged by the very group
[1:12:40] that preached them
[1:12:41] don't you know the saints will judge the
[1:12:43] earth
[1:12:44] now why is it so important that the
[1:12:46] saints judge the earth
[1:12:50] because if the judgment is based on
[1:12:53] accepting or rejecting the word in
[1:12:54] whatever form it comes in
[1:12:56] what form has the word come in today
[1:12:59] the bride of jesus christ right
[1:13:02] and so no one else can be a witness to
[1:13:05] that judgment but the bride of jesus
[1:13:07] christ
[1:13:08] christ in every age has to be judging
[1:13:10] that age
[1:13:11] so we're sitting on the throne and they
[1:13:13] bring those up and says
[1:13:16] you never fed me when i was hungry
[1:13:19] you never clothed me when i was naked
[1:13:21] when do we do this
[1:13:22] and they point over to you and they know
[1:13:24] that the testimony is true
[1:13:28] that's why we have to sit on judgment
[1:13:31] because it matters
[1:13:32] what they do to the word that's in us
[1:13:35] whether they
[1:13:36] accept or reject the word that's in us
[1:13:39] that's why the saints
[1:13:40] have to judge the world because we are
[1:13:44] the eye
[1:13:44] witnesses that prove that the judgment
[1:13:48] is true
[1:13:50] that's why we must be there at the white
[1:13:52] throne judgment
[1:13:53] sitting on the throne in the seat of
[1:13:56] judgment
[1:13:56] that's why judgment was given to the
[1:13:59] saints
[1:14:01] because that's the basis for judgment
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:09] church age book 281
[1:14:17] no 280 sorry
[1:14:25] 280 paragraph one start with the first
[1:14:28] sentence
[1:14:29] first of all first of all we know most
[1:14:31] assuredly that the purpose of god stands
[1:14:33] in election
[1:14:34] it was purposed in himself it was god's
[1:14:36] purpose to bring forth a people like
[1:14:38] unto himself that would be a word bride
[1:14:40] she was chosen before
[1:14:42] the foundation of the world in him she
[1:14:44] was foreknown and beloved before she was
[1:14:46] ever brought forth during the ages upon
[1:14:48] the earth
[1:14:48] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:14:50] never come into condemnation
[1:14:52] she can never be in the judgment because
[1:14:54] sin cannot be imputed unto her
[1:14:56] why can she not come into the judgment
[1:14:58] because she's redeemed by the blood of
[1:15:00] the lamb
[1:15:01] and you can't pass judgment where blood
[1:15:04] is
[1:15:05] where the blood is it can't be judged
[1:15:07] but because she was in the foreknowledge
[1:15:09] of god
[1:15:10] for the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:15:12] of the world right
[1:15:13] now that's applied to her his blood
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:16] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:15:18] never come into condemnation
[1:15:20] she can never be in the judgment because
[1:15:22] sin cannot be imputed unto her romans 4
[1:15:24] 8
[1:15:25] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:15:26] not impute sin but indeed she shall be
[1:15:29] with him in his throne of the judgment
[1:15:31] judging the world and even angels
[1:15:33] her name each of her members was written
[1:15:35] in a section of the lamb's book of life
[1:15:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:38] secondly there is another class
[1:15:40] their names are also in the book of life
[1:15:42] and they will come up in the second
[1:15:43] resurrection
[1:15:44] such are the foolish virgins and the
[1:15:46] righteous as are spoken of in matthew
[1:15:48] 25.
[1:15:49] in this class also are those who do not
[1:15:51] worship the beast or become involved in
[1:15:53] the antichrist system
[1:15:54] but die for their faith even though they
[1:15:56] are not in the bride
[1:15:57] not having been born again but they will
[1:15:59] come up in the second resurrection and
[1:16:01] go into eternal life
[1:16:03] thirdly there are the borderline
[1:16:05] christians such as we saw in israel
[1:16:07] coming out of egypt these had their
[1:16:09] names in the book of life and their
[1:16:10] works written in the books
[1:16:12] these having failed to obey god and
[1:16:14] being void of the spirit
[1:16:15] though even the signs and wonders were
[1:16:17] amongst them will have their names
[1:16:19] removed from the book of life
[1:16:21] amongst this group will be the ones like
[1:16:22] judas who though entirely void of the
[1:16:24] spirit but are religious
[1:16:26] will have manifestations in their lives
[1:16:28] and though on the books
[1:16:29] were not the elected in him such also as
[1:16:32] balaam
[1:16:33] will be in that group fourth and finally
[1:16:35] are the ones whose names have never been
[1:16:38] or will ever be written on the books
[1:16:40] such are found in revelations 13 8 and
[1:16:42] revelation 17
[1:16:43] 8 and all that dwell upon the earth
[1:16:45] shall worship him whose names
[1:16:46] are not written in the book of life of
[1:16:48] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:16:50] the world
[1:16:51] the beast that thou saws was and is not
[1:16:53] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[1:16:54] pit and go into perdition
[1:16:55] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[1:16:57] wonder whose names were not
[1:16:59] written in the book of life from the
[1:17:00] foundation of the world
[1:17:02] when they behold the beast that was and
[1:17:03] is not and yet is jesus said that a
[1:17:05] certain group would accept one who came
[1:17:07] in his own name
[1:17:08] that one is the antichrist and that is
[1:17:10] exactly what is saying of them in
[1:17:12] revelations 13
[1:17:13] 8 and 17 8 these were ordained of god
[1:17:15] but not unto election
[1:17:17] and with this group as such that are as
[1:17:19] pharaoh it says of him even for the same
[1:17:21] purpose have i raised thee up
[1:17:23] so he's saying they're ordained
[1:17:26] they are ordained they are foreknown
[1:17:30] but not elected
[1:17:35] even for the same purpose of i raise
[1:17:36] thee up vessels of wrath fitted to
[1:17:38] destruction romans 19 17 and 22.
[1:17:41] none of these would be placed on the
[1:17:43] records of life i'm not saying that
[1:17:44] there is no record of them
[1:17:46] no doubt there is some kind of record of
[1:17:47] them but not in the records
[1:17:49] of life let's go to 274 we've got two
[1:17:53] really short ones to read and then we'll
[1:17:54] be done
[1:17:58] 274 and go down to paragraph three
[1:18:03] as israel chosen people of god in
[1:18:06] majority
[1:18:07] forfeited their rights in the book of
[1:18:08] life by rejecting jesus
[1:18:10] so the majority of the gentile church
[1:18:13] would also come into condemnation
[1:18:15] with the resulting removal of their
[1:18:16] names from the book of life
[1:18:18] by rejecting the word and thereby
[1:18:20] entering into the world ecumenical
[1:18:22] movement which is the image erected into
[1:18:24] the beast
[1:18:26] he didn't say it was going to be the
[1:18:27] minor group that had their name blotted
[1:18:28] off the book of life
[1:18:29] but the majority of the gentile church
[1:18:33] the majority of the gentile church will
[1:18:35] have their name blotted off of the
[1:18:37] lamb's book of life
[1:18:39] let's turn real quickly over to
[1:18:43] 279 279
[1:18:47] paragraph three
[1:18:50] all these people had their names in the
[1:18:52] book of life and their names remain
[1:18:54] but whose name did not remain those of
[1:18:56] the world system churches who fought the
[1:18:58] bride
[1:18:59] will be those whose names are removed
[1:19:01] that is who will lose out
[1:19:03] they will be cast into the lake of fire
[1:19:06] you cannot ever resist christ
[1:19:09] and you cannot ever reject christ in
[1:19:12] whatever form christ comes in
[1:19:16] it became apparent to the apostle paul
[1:19:17] where christ was when he met the pillar
[1:19:19] of fire
[1:19:20] he knew where christ was then christ was
[1:19:22] in his believing children
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:27] we'll read this last quote remember they
[1:19:30] were very religious people that did that
[1:19:33] they wasn't outsiders they were
[1:19:34] religious people of that day
[1:19:36] and that's what's doing it today is the
[1:19:38] religious people
[1:19:39] same crucifixion same thing today there
[1:19:42] they crucified him
[1:19:44] then sure then they were rejecting god's
[1:19:47] word
[1:19:47] made manifest accepting their creeds
[1:19:49] instead of the word and he's talking
[1:19:51] about the jews
[1:19:52] who rejected christ when jesus was
[1:19:54] standing on the earth and had him
[1:19:55] crucified
[1:19:56] and he said they they were rejecting
[1:19:58] god's word made manifest
[1:20:01] what were the jews doing when paul and
[1:20:02] barnabas were standing there preaching
[1:20:03] christ
[1:20:04] they were rejecting the word of god made
[1:20:05] manifest
[1:20:08] accepting their creeds instead of the
[1:20:09] word is that what they're doing today
[1:20:12] that's exactly doing the same today
[1:20:14] he was the word and they rejected the
[1:20:16] word that's one point i want you not to
[1:20:19] miss see
[1:20:19] i want you not to miss he was the word
[1:20:22] and when they rejected him they rejected
[1:20:24] the word
[1:20:24] and when they did reject him they
[1:20:27] finally crucified him
[1:20:28] and that's what they've done today
[1:20:31] reject the word of god and accepted
[1:20:33] their creeds
[1:20:34] and has crucified publicly before their
[1:20:36] congregation the working of the holy
[1:20:37] spirit
[1:20:40] denying the works of god denying the
[1:20:42] truths of the scripture
[1:20:44] somebody will go to their pastor and
[1:20:45] they'll look at you know acts 2 38 and
[1:20:48] how it was baptized and that pastor will
[1:20:49] deny that word that's laying openly in
[1:20:51] the scriptures
[1:20:54] he has no hope
[1:20:57] denying the word of god rejecting
[1:21:00] because of creeds and dogmas and
[1:21:01] man-made ideas
[1:21:02] rejecting truth there's no hope
[1:21:06] why because it's rejecting christ
[1:21:12] and they're guilty and i indict them
[1:21:15] in the name of jesus christ
[1:21:18] that is a harsh statement
[1:21:23] how can you have your name remaining on
[1:21:25] the book of life
[1:21:26] well one you can be part of the record
[1:21:28] of seed life that can never have your
[1:21:30] name blotted out
[1:21:31] or two never come against
[1:21:35] the true word of god in whatever form
[1:21:38] the true word of god comes in
[1:21:40] whether it be a person whether it be the
[1:21:42] message of the hour
[1:21:43] whatever the true word is coming don't
[1:21:45] ever reject the true word of god
[1:21:48] amen let's all stand musicians
[1:21:51] if you want to come brother tommy
[1:21:59] i thank god that there's grace for his
[1:22:02] children
[1:22:03] and i thank god that there's a
[1:22:04] tremendous amount of mercy
[1:22:07] that'll be given out in the white throne
[1:22:08] judgment

[1:22:14] picture
[1:22:17] let's just pray dear heavenly father we
[1:22:20] thank you lord

[1:22:46] you decided in your great mercy
[1:22:48] that you would give them entrance into

[1:22:54] helping in a time of need
