[7:36] we see that

[7:39] extended to us first and how could we
[7:41] not love you
[7:42] lord when we were lost and weary we were
[7:45] broken and we were oh lord we were
[7:47] destroying ourselves with our own human
[7:49] lusts our own human ideas father you
[7:51] came down reached down and you picked us
[7:53] up
[7:54] lord there's been nothing good in any of
[7:57] us all we can say is lord thank you
[8:00] lord we love you we appreciate your
[8:02] mercy and your grace that you extended
[8:04] to us father
[8:06] lord we've come before you this day we
[8:08] counted a great honor great privilege
[8:10] many people around the world don't have
[8:12] the ability that we have this morning
[8:15] lord to be a people that know that you
[8:17] love us that you've called us that
[8:19] you've chosen us and you've not
[8:22] forgotten about us you're walking this
[8:23] life with us
[8:25] how privileged of a people we are
[8:27] father i pray now that you'll just come
[8:30] and your promise was that you have
[8:32] already come
[8:34] for where there are two or three
[8:35] gathered in my name there i am in the
[8:37] midst of them so father we thank you for
[8:39] this great honor this great privilege we
[8:42] bow our heads in humility
[8:44] lord realizing we're in your presence
[8:47] father come
[8:48] do a supernatural work in our midst lord
[8:51] take this flesh and make it the word
[8:54] father
[8:55] lord we love you search our hearts find
[8:58] anything wicked anything evil lord help
[9:00] us take it away we want to be like you
[9:03] each and every day
[9:05] we commit this time into your hands in
[9:07] jesus name amen
[9:09] amen you may be seated musicians thank
[9:12] you so very much
[9:14] god bless you all
[9:16] happy to be with you
[9:18] nervous as always but nonetheless happy
[9:21] to be with you
[9:23] so i uh sit in my chair yesterday i told
[9:26] kerry i said i just i still don't know
[9:27] how to preach i don't know how to do
[9:28] this
[9:29] and i was sitting in the chair and
[9:30] saying lord you know you give me so much
[9:32] inspiration and i get so filled up by
[9:34] inspiration i love sitting there reading
[9:36] and thinking about the things of god but
[9:38] then when it comes to actually putting
[9:40] it together i'm the least capable man on
[9:42] earth to do this you know and it's kind
[9:44] of
[9:45] feeling sorry for myself you know and
[9:47] then we do that from time to time
[9:49] and then a scripture came to my mind
[9:52] what is it what can the potter say or
[9:54] can the clay say to the potter why
[9:55] hastal made thee thus
[9:57] and then i felt like job i put my hand
[9:59] over my mouth i say nothing
[10:01] i i speak foolishly lord thou has made
[10:04] us dust so
[10:05] there's a reason for things there's a
[10:07] reason why everybody's built a certain
[10:09] way why our makeup is a certain way it's
[10:11] because we have a certain portion of god
[10:13] in us that must be fulfilled
[10:15] so we begin to rest in those promises
[10:18] so i just want to
[10:19] get these announcements out of the way
[10:21] that's the part that makes me nervous
[10:23] is uh i wanted to tell you i heard from
[10:26] brother chad he safely landed he's there
[10:29] in uganda and with brother abraham i
[10:31] believe he has two services today
[10:33] he might have already been preaching one
[10:35] i don't exactly know the time difference
[10:37] but they're there already and then
[10:40] so keep him in prayer though
[10:42] brother moses says to mercy got a text
[10:44] from them they landed safely they made
[10:46] it to uganda as well so we're happy for
[10:48] them and
[10:49] uh we got brother ben up north
[10:51] we got brother emmanuel and congo
[10:54] so it's getting quieter as you can tell
[10:57] the amen voices
[10:59] what am i going to do
[11:01] i'm going to initiate somebody i'm just
[11:04] delegating brother brian you're going to
[11:06] pick up the pace brother
[11:09] so we got brother ben preaching up at
[11:10] brother dan holt's keep him in prayer
[11:12] they have a service now
[11:14] and i heard from brother clayton sister
[11:16] wanda i don't know if they're here but i
[11:18] called him yesterday they're doing
[11:20] better but they're still pretty pretty
[11:22] sick so pretty pretty tired sister wanda
[11:24] has been struggling with it now since
[11:26] september coven
[11:28] and brother clayton's still on oxygen
[11:30] so we bear one another's burdens keep
[11:33] them in prayer before the lord they
[11:34] could really they really appreciate
[11:36] those prayers
[11:38] and uh also talked about the bob sister
[11:40] suzanne i don't know if they're here but
[11:42] nonetheless they're doing good brother
[11:44] bob was ready to run on the treadmill
[11:46] i'm like hold on brother maybe maybe
[11:48] walk on treadmill and then you'll be all
[11:50] right he's he's ready to go he's ready
[11:52] to get back to action but we sure we
[11:55] love them we're a family we're a little
[11:57] family we bear each other up and i want
[11:59] to also say thank you i appreciate the
[12:01] many cards and little notes and text
[12:03] messages i received carrie got coven she
[12:06] got pretty sick and she was down for
[12:08] like seven days and she's way tougher
[12:09] than me if it was me i've been down for
[12:11] like two months
[12:12] and uh but she's back in action she's
[12:14] feeling good and she's here with us and
[12:17] we appreciate that it really means a lot
[12:18] when you know you have the people that
[12:19] care about you you know brother branham
[12:21] says god heals by love
[12:23] you just let let just love somebody
[12:25] who's kind of weary and down and how and
[12:28] it has a way of bringing them right out
[12:29] of that it's kind of an amazing thing
[12:31] ain't it so we appreciate that
[12:34] i also want to let you know there is a
[12:35] youth meeting today we'll be having
[12:36] youth meeting right over here in the
[12:37] fellowship hall so

[12:40] youth um to come if you think yourself a

[13:00] we pray for our brothers and sisters so
[13:03] i think that's all my announcements will
[13:04] you stand with me
[13:08] we'll just have you turn in your bibles
[13:10] here
[13:10] to first peter 5.
[13:23] first peter 5
[13:25] verse 5.
[13:29] just say amen when you're there
[13:32] ah see you can say amen i gotcha i
[13:35] tricked you
[13:36] you can do it
[13:39] so
[13:40] first peter 5 5.
[13:42] it says likewise younger submit
[13:44] yourselves unto the elder
[13:47] yea all of you be subject one to another
[13:50] and be clothed with humility for god
[13:53] resisteth the proud and giveth grace to
[13:56] the humble
[13:57] humble yourselves therefore under the
[13:59] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[14:02] in due time
[14:04] casting all your care upon him for he
[14:07] careth for you
[14:10] you're the only one brother that's happy
[14:12] about that
[14:13] amen i think we can all say amen
[14:17] in this hour of distress and this hour
[14:20] of uncertainty i think the bride needs
[14:22] to be able to say hey amen
[14:25] he ha he beareth my burdens i have a
[14:28] place i can rest if there ever was a
[14:31] time where i think
[14:32] we need to be able to show the world
[14:34] we're not like you because we have a
[14:36] place of rest we're not walking this
[14:38] road alone i have someone that's walking
[14:41] with me it's us and i i am convinced
[14:45] more and more we're going to find out
[14:48] that the light shines brightest in
[14:50] darkest devours right
[14:52] amen so
[14:54] he careth for thee
[14:56] amen
[14:57] next scripture i'd like you to turn to
[14:59] matthew 11 28.
[15:05] matthew 11 28.
[15:15] says come unto me all ye that labor and
[15:18] are heavy laden and i'll give you rest
[15:22] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[15:25] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[15:28] shall find rest for your souls
[15:32] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[15:35] light you may be seated may god add his
[15:38] rich blessings to the word
[15:41] so we are not a people of distress we
[15:44] are a people that have a place a place
[15:46] that we can rest in a place that we can
[15:48] find satisfaction for our souls and i
[15:51] would like to speak for just a little
[15:54] bit caught a little inspiration i know
[15:56] it's a very simple inspiration but i
[15:57] kind of like how god hides himself in
[15:59] simplicity sometimes and he just knows
[16:01] the right word to say in the presence of
[16:03] the right person that can respond in the
[16:05] right way and say that ain't nothing but
[16:07] the truth
[16:08] and i think so many times we've got to
[16:10] keep it for what it is it's a people
[16:12] that god has called out that are simple
[16:14] lowly humble meek and in a way in a
[16:17] position they're built in such a way
[16:19] when they come in contact with the word
[16:21] they can say amen that ain't nothing but
[16:25] the truth i may not have it all figured
[16:27] out and i think the prophet of god said
[16:29] you don't figure out god you don't
[16:30] understand god you believe god when god
[16:33] comes in the presence of the people he
[16:35] has a people on earth that say that's
[16:37] the truth amen praise god it ain't
[16:41] nothing but the truth and i like to see
[16:43] that reaction and i like i think god
[16:45] likes to see a reaction to his actions i
[16:48] think god is looking for a bride who who
[16:50] sits back and says he's more than able
[16:53] oh he's fairest of ten thousand to my
[16:56] souls have you seen my god in action i
[16:58] know you're weary i know you're down and
[17:00] i know you're upset but see i have a
[17:02] place of rest i have someone i can go to
[17:06] in my times of distress and let's be
[17:08] honest the pressure's on
[17:11] am i the only one that realizes it
[17:13] i think we could say with certainty the
[17:16] pressure's on it's now a
[17:19] very distressful hour in which we are
[17:22] living you look at the polit political
[17:24] system it's a chaos it's a mess it's
[17:26] ridiculous it's falling apart nobody
[17:29] trusts it you look at the economic
[17:31] decision i think they came out with the
[17:32] inflationary numbers last week and those
[17:34] are probably highly manipulated but
[17:36] they're pretty high uh going pretty
[17:38] quick if you don't know much about
[17:40] economics that means your dollar is
[17:41] collapsing before your very eyes that
[17:43] means that the u.s economy the world
[17:45] reserve currency of the world is
[17:47] collapsing
[17:49] amen
[17:51] it's exciting for those who know
[17:54] it's very scary for those that are
[17:56] looking to have confidence in the old
[17:57] greenback
[17:59] it's dying everybody it's dying
[18:02] and so the reality of it is the
[18:03] political system's a mess the economic
[18:06] system is bankrupt
[18:08] and you look at the social fabric of
[18:10] america it's heartbreaking it's
[18:12] disgusting it is a uh it's a dog-eat-dog
[18:16] hatred of mankind everybody's after
[18:18] their selves
[18:20] everybody's afraid of another person be
[18:22] it you being a different color or a
[18:24] different sex or a different whatever
[18:26] any aspect of differentiation has now
[18:28] made you an enemy to what i am there's
[18:31] no love anywhere everybody hates
[18:35] everybody where it used to be one would
[18:37] disagree with another now it's not a
[18:39] disagreement that we can live with each
[18:40] other somebody has to die we can no
[18:42] longer coexist together in this state
[18:44] someone's going to have to die and
[18:46] that's the spirit of the age
[18:49] that is the spirit of the age and i have
[18:51] a warning for you your prophet of god
[18:53] said you better be careful not to let
[18:56] that spirit of the age come upon you
[19:00] it's a spirit of war
[19:03] it is a spirit of war and i can show you
[19:06] this in the scriptures there will be
[19:07] nation against nation and kingdom
[19:09] against kingdom father will be against
[19:12] daughter daughter will be against father
[19:14] children rebellious to their parents
[19:17] parents hating their children hoping
[19:18] they could just move out sometime what
[19:20] is going on it's a spirit of war in the
[19:23] nation
[19:25] and that spirit is so he is so obviously
[19:28] prescient
[19:29] on even us
[19:32] it's even happened to us
[19:34] and that's why i felt drawn to just i
[19:36] have a title it's learn of me
[19:39] pretty simple title
[19:41] but jesus said learn of me watch my
[19:43] nature watch how i act and watch how i
[19:46] react
[19:48] sometimes we're so concerned with our
[19:50] actions we forget about the reactions to
[19:52] the actions
[19:53] is this the truth
[19:55] sometimes we get we oh hey i said it
[19:56] right i did it right i can't help the
[19:58] way they responded there's just
[19:59] something wrong with them
[20:00] you know i'm going to get rid of them
[20:02] make some new friends here you know
[20:03] something like that i did it right they
[20:05] did it wrong
[20:07] you know
[20:08] so
[20:09] what it does it's a it's an hour of
[20:12] self-love
[20:14] it's an hour where men and women don't
[20:16] want to die and suffer for another
[20:19] person it's war
[20:21] and i found this little subject and you
[20:23] know i wish i like always i says you
[20:26] know i get my subject strange but my dog
[20:28] bit me
[20:31] yeah
[20:33] i know that's what i thought
[20:35] and i thought well you know i wish i'd
[20:37] come and say you know i came in contact
[20:39] with a bowl and i overcame it you know
[20:41] and you know these things i would i you
[20:44] know hit a hornet or a squirrel i don't
[20:46] know
[20:47] no my dog bit me and uh i learned a
[20:51] lesson and i told my wife i said ah
[20:53] you're gonna be shocked at where i got
[20:54] this one from
[20:56] but my dog bit me and um yeah last
[21:00] weekend
[21:01] we had adopted a dog right i hope this
[21:03] okay just be normal simple can i just be
[21:05] like prophet of god to the age you did
[21:08] little stories and little things kind of
[21:09] get his point that's why i love him so
[21:11] much god made himself so simple
[21:14] and uh he he was uh hi we adopted this
[21:18] dog and he got him from pound my
[21:20] daughter's kind of wanted a dog and i
[21:21] kind of halfway wanted a dog a little
[21:23] bit i've had to reconsider that thought
[21:25] but uh
[21:27] and uh so we got this dog kind of
[21:29] found it looked like a dog i used to
[21:31] have that i really liked and we
[21:33] got him from pound
[21:34] we thought he was a couple years old you
[21:36] know they said oh he's three years old
[21:38] and then it kind of has some rotten
[21:39] teeth we get some other people like well
[21:41] he's like seven or eight years old like
[21:42] oh
[21:43] took advantage of me sold me a defective
[21:46] dog when i got him he couldn't bark i'm
[21:47] like what's wrong with this dog
[21:49] you can't bark you can't run he had hip
[21:52] problems and like
[21:53] rotten people they sold me like used car
[21:56] sales and they're selling out dogs here
[21:57] telling me a three-year-old dog healthy
[21:59] fine nice
[22:01] and then the dog bit me so
[22:03] that's so interesting though we
[22:05] but we like the dog it's been a pretty
[22:07] good dog and i was telling my wife a
[22:08] couple weeks that's a pretty good dog i
[22:10] said yes and really nice dog she's like
[22:12] it's turned out to be a really good dog
[22:14] you know and i was like yeah not too bad
[22:15] not too bad good dog
[22:18] and then it bit me
[22:19] and i'm like you rotten no good dog
[22:22] defective from the beginning never
[22:24] should have took you take you back to
[22:26] the pound from which i rescued you from
[22:29] you know what i'm saying
[22:32] you're like i feed you i house you i
[22:35] even got him a little coat for winter i
[22:36] mean we spent like 30 bucks
[22:38] you know
[22:39] like
[22:40] you bite the hand that feeds you
[22:43] and i was ready to take him back i'll be
[22:46] honest with you i said we're gonna get
[22:48] rid of you one way or the other my
[22:49] friend
[22:50] and my wife's like now don't do that you
[22:52] probably did something wrong
[22:56] and i had to stop thinking about it and
[22:58] so i'll tell you just what happened was
[23:00] we had this dog and
[23:01] it was night time so it's an older dog
[23:04] and we're pretty sure he was probably
[23:06] abused not really taking good care of
[23:08] he's a little bit scared of a man me
[23:10] loves my girls loves my wife but he's
[23:11] just very cautious about a man so pretty
[23:14] sure he probably had a rough past he
[23:16] probably was beaten a little bit there
[23:18] dealt with harshly
[23:20] and um you know he's is he was tired
[23:23] it was nighttime i had taken him
[23:25] downstairs we put him in our back room
[23:27] and in the back room there and it's
[23:28] about nine o'clock and he gets a little
[23:30] moody when he's tired
[23:31] like all of us we get just a little bit
[23:33] moody and he gets a little moody he gets
[23:36] a little tired and i took him downstairs
[23:37] and it was cold it was last week you
[23:39] know it got real cold and windy
[23:41] and it was cold down there and i thought
[23:42] man it's cold you know i know he's got
[23:44] some hip problems
[23:46] so i'm going to move his bed
[23:48] you know over here to this to another
[23:49] dog or watch right now keep them a
[23:51] little warmer the
[23:52] warmth they can warm each other up
[23:55] you know i'm thinking about the dog i'm
[23:56] thinking listen i'm gonna help you out
[23:58] my friend i want you to be cold at night
[24:00] well i moved him when he was still
[24:02] laying on the bed
[24:05] and i didn't even think about it i was
[24:06] like
[24:08] he latched down on my hand still got a
[24:10] nice little scab there
[24:11] and he really latched hard
[24:14] to the point at first shock and then
[24:16] yelling at him to pry his mouth off my
[24:18] hand
[24:19] and then said in i will deal with you i
[24:22] will show you
[24:24] i i will handle this
[24:26] and uh
[24:27] uh you know then my wife come and stuff
[24:30] and then so a couple days ago i went for
[24:32] a walk just meditating on different
[24:33] things different scriptures and that
[24:35] story and that that dog biting me came
[24:37] back to my mind and i'm just funny
[24:39] enough to know when brother banham says
[24:41] if you're looking for god you can find
[24:42] him in anything
[24:45] sorry i think let's all stay simple like
[24:47] that
[24:48] if you're looking for him you can see
[24:49] him in about anything and see him in a
[24:51] storm in a rainbow and a sunset you can
[24:53] see god in anything
[24:55] and i was thinking now why'd that dog
[24:58] bite me you know and i and i i just went
[25:00] for the walk and i don't know why i just
[25:01] kept start thinking now
[25:03] why don't you walk that story for a
[25:04] second just strange you know it's like
[25:06] me i'm like why would i take the time to
[25:08] consider this i want to send him back to
[25:09] the pal
[25:11] and i got the thing and i said you know
[25:12] what that dog
[25:14] was scarred
[25:16] somewhere in life
[25:17] that dog had no doubt been beaten or
[25:20] abused or something that caused him to
[25:22] be afraid of me
[25:24] of a man he was cautious
[25:27] and he misunderstood
[25:29] my action of love
[25:32] for an action of aggression
[25:34] he misunderstood me
[25:37] and when he bit me
[25:39] i misunderstood him
[25:41] i think you rotten aggressive no good
[25:43] dog
[25:45] but he was scared
[25:47] he his immediate reaction the only thing
[25:49] he could do was bite me he couldn't say
[25:52] now sir
[25:53] please back away from my bed
[25:58] i can't do it
[26:00] i appreciate you wanting to move my bed
[26:02] to this little warmer location but at
[26:04] this time i i would like to with
[26:06] withdraw from your request to move your
[26:07] bed you know not possible i'm going to
[26:10] bite you
[26:11] instant reaction attack
[26:15] instant reaction that's what a dog does
[26:16] he bites
[26:18] and so
[26:19] i said well he misunderstood me i
[26:22] misunderstood him
[26:25] how we going to move forward now
[26:28] we can only move forward because now i
[26:30] can understand why he did it
[26:32] i can understand he's
[26:34] that i he
[26:35] he did what he had to do in order to
[26:38] protect himself
[26:40] and
[26:41] i did what i was i was going to do now
[26:44] i'm not going to do what i was going to
[26:46] do because i can understand why he did
[26:48] what he did
[26:51] makes sense
[26:53] many times we react to people
[26:56] many times we fight back
[26:59] because we get hurt
[27:02] and many times
[27:04] we don't understand the reaction of
[27:07] somebody else
[27:09] and we react in a nature that is not
[27:12] lamb-like
[27:14] it's just not lamb like
[27:18] and i you get to thinking about this and
[27:20] the hour in which we're living i believe
[27:22] we're going to see a great display of
[27:24] the lamb of god again
[27:26] because brother branham said
[27:28] my ministry types that of john the
[27:30] baptist where john the baptist said
[27:31] behold the lamb
[27:33] my ministry will be saying the same
[27:35] behold the lamb of god and take away the
[27:37] sins of the world there he is and there
[27:40] she is
[27:41] i believe when she's described in the
[27:42] bible she's called
[27:44] the bible says behold the lamb and the
[27:47] lamb's wife
[27:50] the nature of the lamb on display
[27:52] and the only really time that you can
[27:54] find
[27:56] the lamb-like nature coming out is when
[27:58] you come in contact with a wolf-like
[28:00] nature
[28:02] that's the time you really get to
[28:03] finding out what's on the inside
[28:05] that's really the testing time that's
[28:07] really the time that makes you stop and
[28:09] consider
[28:10] where we at and what are we doing
[28:13] and because this is spirit of the age i
[28:15] want to look at a couple of these
[28:16] scriptures and and
[28:19] oh sorry i forgot i got this
[28:21] and realizing where we are
[28:23] and why we're doing what we're doing
[28:26] ii timothy 3 says this know also that in
[28:30] the last days perilous times shall come
[28:33] men will be lovers of their own selves
[28:35] covetous boasters proud
[28:38] blasphemers
[28:40] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[28:43] without natural affection see losing
[28:46] love one for another
[28:48] truce breakers false accusers
[28:50] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[28:53] that are good
[28:55] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[28:58] pleasure more than lovers of god
[29:01] it's a spirit
[29:03] it's an attitude it's it's it's clearly
[29:06] an attitude of
[29:07] self-preservation
[29:09] and self-love
[29:11] and it is the absolute polar opposite of
[29:13] the nature of the lamb of god
[29:16] it is completely 100 percent not his
[29:19] nature
[29:21] matthew 24 nation shall rise against
[29:24] nation and kingdom against kingdom there
[29:25] will be famines and pestilences and
[29:27] earthquakes look spirit of war
[29:30] they shall deliver you to the afflicted
[29:32] and shall kill you and ye shall be hated
[29:35] of all nations for my name's sake see
[29:37] it is no longer we can tolerate your
[29:39] differences no it's time to exterminate
[29:42] you can see it's building on people it's
[29:45] an attitude you can sense it
[29:48] you can feel there's no longer any
[29:50] ability to cope with a difference
[29:53] there's no ability to um you would say
[29:56] long suffer with somebody it is not
[29:59] possible any longer with the spirit
[30:02] that's upon this age to handle anybody
[30:05] of difference
[30:07] so the only thing we can do is kill you
[30:10] that's what the scripture says we will
[30:11] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[30:13] kill you
[30:15] and shall and there shall be many
[30:17] offended and shall betray one another
[30:18] and shall hate one another and many
[30:21] false prophets shall arise and shall
[30:23] deceive many
[30:24] and because iniquity shall abound the
[30:27] love of many shall wax cold
[30:31] safe to say that that's happening
[30:35] it's very safe to say
[30:37] very safe to say that we are living in
[30:39] an age where there's such a coldness in
[30:41] the land
[30:43] it's really a coldness a lack of real
[30:46] love and sincerity that once used to be
[30:48] there it's no longer there any longer
[30:51] and i'll tell you something that's my
[30:53] only place of rest any longer
[30:56] that's my place of rest you know why i
[30:57] like to come to church i know i'm
[30:59] identified with a group of people that
[31:01] love me though i make
[31:02] mistakes don't you like to have
[31:05] fellowship with men and women like that
[31:07] i'm not the only one do i what's a real
[31:09] friend he sticks with you in good and in
[31:12] bad
[31:13] why do you love your wife she's been
[31:15] with you and good and in bad why do you
[31:18] love the lord he sticks with you in the
[31:20] good and in the bad
[31:23] i'm so glad his love toward me does not
[31:26] change based upon my human ability to do
[31:29] things right
[31:31] his love never changes he doesn't love
[31:34] me more because i make i do good he
[31:37] doesn't love me less because i don't do
[31:39] what's right
[31:40] his love is an elective love god chose
[31:44] man if that don't make you say amen i
[31:47] don't know what does
[31:49] it did not matter what you did it did
[31:52] not matter you're his
[31:54] god chose you god elected you god
[31:57] perseveres and copes and trains and
[32:00] continues to walk beside you though you
[32:03] try to throw him off
[32:05] i love that about him i really do how
[32:08] could one so great come to someone like
[32:11] us
[32:12] so insignificant and nothing and he so
[32:15] desirous to walk with you though you
[32:18] smack him though you kick him though you
[32:20] say leave me alone
[32:22] he still keeps walking with you and
[32:24] anybody that's walked with the lord long
[32:26] enough boy you really began to
[32:27] appreciate that
[32:28] you really began to say my god thank you
[32:32] thank you for never leaving me even
[32:33] though i wanted you to there's been
[32:35] times i'm not the only one that's wanted
[32:37] to fly away and hide in a mountain and
[32:39] just disappear
[32:40] it sounds very appealing sometimes
[32:43] it sounds but you know what that's the
[32:44] nature of the of the bride is that
[32:46] really that wrong did your prophet have
[32:48] that desire
[32:50] sure he did
[32:51] did david have that desire that i could
[32:52] take the wings of a dove and fly away
[32:54] leave just disappear
[32:56] sure he did
[32:58] the stresses and pressures of this age
[33:00] i'll be honest with you
[33:02] honestly 10 years ago 11 years but 12
[33:04] years ago i don't know times are flying
[33:06] when i came i honestly thought
[33:08] you know god brought me here i honestly
[33:10] thought
[33:11] no more problems
[33:15] no more issues
[33:17] no more battles to fight i can i'll rest
[33:19] but i'm finding what my rest really is
[33:22] my rest is not based upon the not having
[33:26] a lack of problems
[33:28] and tribulations and rejections
[33:31] and despisements
[33:33] my rest comes from the lord you'll never
[33:36] leave me you'll never forsake me you'll
[33:39] be with me even in me in the good times
[33:42] and in the bad times when i do good and
[33:44] when i do bad the tender mercies of my
[33:47] god towards me keep molding me and
[33:50] shaping me and making me into what he
[33:53] desired me to be he took a picture of me
[33:55] he took a picture of me in my perfect
[33:58] complete condition
[34:00] and he's gone to work seeing to it that
[34:02] that image comes into view
[34:06] tell me where's the pressure
[34:07] tell me if that don't bring you rest
[34:10] there's no more striving there's no more
[34:11] willing there's no more i got to get it
[34:13] figured out no the mystery of the seven
[34:15] seal was christ comes to you
[34:18] he said i know it's going over your head
[34:20] you're not catching it but something
[34:21] real supernatural is happening right now
[34:24] christ the lamb coming every morning
[34:27] breaking the seal saying i'm here i'm
[34:29] here i'm here
[34:32] the master has come
[34:34] and he's here and he calleth for thee oh
[34:37] brother could it be that simple
[34:41] do we make it overcomplicated
[34:44] sure we do that's human mindset brother
[34:46] bam said that we always over complicate
[34:49] it because we know how great he is we
[34:51] don't think that he being that great
[34:52] could make it this simple and the
[34:54] reality of is only the great can make it
[34:56] this simple that christ has come here me
[34:59] breaking the seals loosing the mystery
[35:01] that was in this life and now unfolding
[35:03] this great mystery of christ that was in
[35:05] me hidden from before the foundation of
[35:07] the world
[35:08] and he's doing it in you
[35:09] and it looks so simple so humble that
[35:11] you yourself begin to doubt it sometimes
[35:13] not possible very possible
[35:16] god humbling himself becoming little
[35:19] becoming simple in an everyday man and
[35:22] an everyday woman so simple don't you
[35:24] love him because of it
[35:26] gives us a hope gives us a rest so we no
[35:30] longer have to worry about getting
[35:31] everything under control because my
[35:34] problems my trials and my battles did
[35:35] not stop
[35:37] when i came to the truth
[35:39] they continue
[35:42] and it seems like we go from one battle
[35:44] to the next
[35:45] right we go from one battle to the next
[35:47] but i'm so glad i still got a general he
[35:49] hasn't abandoned me yet
[35:51] he keeps leading this little army
[35:52] through and i think he's with the little
[35:55] army of god the little simple humble
[35:57] army of god i think he's got a purpose
[35:59] in the battles he's breaking her down
[36:01] breaking her down making her simple
[36:04] making her more humble taking all the
[36:06] strength out of her so then she can
[36:08] finally just
[36:09] rest
[36:11] say rest i'm going to rest under the
[36:12] wings of my mighty god and i'll see i
[36:15] know he'll take me through you see so
[36:17] then the problems the trials all is well
[36:21] all as well
[36:22] but
[36:23] it's interesting and i was looking at
[36:25] this from the perspective of psalms 42
[36:27] if you'll turn to it you turn to psalms
[36:29] 42.
[36:40] i had a
[36:41] couple you know and i appreciate also
[36:43] you know i lost my grandmother my
[36:45] grandmother passed away suddenly a
[36:47] couple months ago and
[36:48] then like three weeks after that my
[36:49] grandfather passed away and then then
[36:52] gary got covered so it's been a rough
[36:54] few months and in that period of time of
[36:56] it being rough you know i sat i was
[36:58] sitting in my chair in the office there
[36:59] and i
[37:00] was like wow
[37:02] life's rough right now
[37:04] it's a little bit rough right now and
[37:06] you get to feeling kind of down and it's
[37:08] so interesting you know when you go
[37:09] through life and you start to feel um
[37:11] i'm kind of a person i feel things so
[37:14] um i may not be able to intellectually
[37:16] put it together but i pick up on things
[37:18] and um
[37:20] and i i was in my mind i was thinking
[37:22] wow lord you know uh 12 years ago i took
[37:24] a stand for you and i was rejected
[37:27] i was rejected by my family i was
[37:29] rejected by my fam friends people didn't
[37:32] understand me and i was a real oddball
[37:35] for taking that stand
[37:36] and it wasn't a few years after that
[37:39] then the pastor of this church decides
[37:41] i'm going a different direction i don't
[37:42] believe it
[37:43] and you go through another rejection
[37:45] because i had lots of friends i had
[37:47] people i loved i really did love them it
[37:49] wasn't a put on and they all left and
[37:51] then they
[37:52] say things about you i says wow lord
[37:54] it's a constant rejection and then as
[37:57] time goes on especially when you begin
[37:58] to minister
[38:00] you say things and sometimes you say it
[38:02] by inspiration and sometimes you don't
[38:03] balance things out and sometimes people
[38:05] think you're attacking when you feel
[38:07] like you're helping kind of like i was
[38:08] trying to help the dog and then he bites
[38:09] me and i thought maybe i should let him
[38:11] alone you know and it just you just you
[38:14] constant you know you just you just feel
[38:17] you get down it's a real thing you get
[38:20] real down and it's not just for a
[38:21] minister anybody can you look at the
[38:23] life you look at situation look at your
[38:25] family you look at friends people you
[38:27] love the most and you think
[38:29] lord how's this going to work i don't i
[38:31] don't get it i don't know what to do
[38:32] here but what more can you do have you
[38:35] done all to stand
[38:37] you just keep standing
[38:39] you just keep standing on the promises
[38:41] of god i had a rock that i could stand
[38:42] upon a revelation he'll never leave me
[38:45] he'll never forsake me
[38:46] and i was sitting there and i was
[38:48] sitting there thinking this and i'll you
[38:50] know the devil has a way of pouncing on
[38:52] you real hard when you get in those
[38:54] weak tired moments
[38:56] and i began to realize my mind is
[38:58] hanging out
[38:59] and it's like what do you do it for why
[39:00] don't you just stop you know why don't
[39:02] you just stop life would be easier you
[39:04] quit just quit
[39:06] you keep trying to do things for the
[39:08] lord you do your best and my goodness
[39:10] even the ones you think love you hate
[39:12] you now
[39:13] you get constantly what do you do you
[39:15] want to quit
[39:16] am i the only one
[39:18] no
[39:19] we all have gotten to this point you
[39:22] want to quit not because you've given up
[39:24] on god but you begin to give up a little
[39:26] bit in your ability to understand the
[39:28] plan of god
[39:29] and your position in the plan of god it
[39:32] becomes so confusing to you sometimes
[39:34] you think maybe be better off i'll just
[39:36] step off to the side so god can really
[39:37] fulfill his will but he can't
[39:40] you're a part of that great mystery no
[39:42] matter what you think even in your
[39:44] weakness you're a part of the mystery
[39:47] you're really a part of it
[39:48] but i was sitting there and i had i had
[39:51] i thought of that scripture when
[39:53] has a heart pantheth after the water
[39:55] brook so does my soul thirst after thee
[39:57] and i i grab my bible and i says you
[39:59] know in my soul i'm longing for you god
[40:02] and i can't i can't find rest right now.
[40:04] and i grabbed my bible and i opened it
[40:06] up and you see that little words written
[40:08] right there i wrote down in january 28
[40:12] 2014 bad mental oppression god brought
[40:15] me to this scripture
[40:17] seven years ago
[40:19] never knew that was there
[40:21] just sitting there despondent
[40:23] tired weary wanting to give up in my
[40:26] mind fighting a battle
[40:28] and i open my bible
[40:31] seven years ago he calls me to write
[40:33] that
[40:34] now brother branham got real down one
[40:35] day he got real despondent he wanted to
[40:37] give up
[40:38] god had him take a drive and he saw
[40:40] seven peaks
[40:42] and it lifted him up out of that
[40:44] depression that rejected state that he
[40:46] was in that time where he wanted to
[40:47] leave and just go away
[40:50] now this ain't seven mountains but to me
[40:52] it means just as much
[40:55] seven years ago god must have known
[40:57] there'll come a time kyle's gonna turn
[40:59] to this scripture so i'm gonna put a
[41:00] little reminder of it in his bible when
[41:03] he gets to that i hadn't seen that for
[41:05] years brother honestly since i didn't
[41:07] even know it was there i just opened it
[41:10] so the same god that delivered me from
[41:12] the word by the word is the same god
[41:14] that's taking us through by the word
[41:17] he sustains us by the word he
[41:19] strengthens us by the word he delivers
[41:22] us by the word and you know what my duty
[41:24] is to say amen
[41:26] my duty is to say that ain't nothing but
[41:28] the truth lord
[41:30] i can't do it in myself you're gonna
[41:32] have to do it for me
[41:34] what are we going to do brother sister
[41:36] there's sickness if you've not noticed
[41:37] there's people dying
[41:39] some people want to think it's a fluke
[41:40] and
[41:41] sorry i know some people have died
[41:44] it's a real thing
[41:45] i think it's the beginning of
[41:47] pestilences i think it gets worse from
[41:49] here brother sister i don't think that
[41:51] it's just automatically everything's
[41:52] going to get smooth sailing in a couple
[41:54] years i have a feeling to think there's
[41:56] something inside me the pressure keeps
[41:58] building
[41:59] and i think it could be the tender hand
[42:00] of jehovah just driving me back to the
[42:02] promises that he laid in his word to say
[42:04] i put something in you that will allow
[42:07] you to overcome in the hour in which
[42:10] you're living it's called faith it's
[42:13] called my life in you to deliver you in
[42:16] any situation that you find yourself in
[42:18] whether it be sickness whether it be
[42:20] cancer i don't care what it is
[42:22] i've got something inside of you a
[42:24] little secret source of strength that
[42:27] you can come to this promise that i laid
[42:29] in my word and it was just for you
[42:32] may not be for the rest of the world may
[42:34] not be that i can understand it and put
[42:35] it all together but why is there
[42:37] something inside of me that says that's
[42:39] the truth
[42:40] that's the truth
[42:42] that's right
[42:43] god will keep his word i know he'll do
[42:46] it i know he'll see me through
[42:48] no matter what i see no matter how dark
[42:50] it gets i know you'll see me through
[42:52] he's done it before he'll do it again
[42:54] i remember even just
[42:56] the day that we
[42:58] we were on i we are north of fort wayne
[43:01] and i had you know before serving the
[43:03] lord before i i never knew that never
[43:05] knew what a message was i just had come
[43:07] in contact with some cds you know we're
[43:09] driving on 69
[43:11] north of fort wayne and i stopped a cd
[43:13] that carrie and i were listening to
[43:14] brother branham and i said i believe we
[43:16] ought to live the way that man preaches
[43:18] now what did i understand of what he was
[43:20] preaching
[43:22] nothing
[43:24] daniel 70 weeks
[43:26] i mean come on i i had the cd but i
[43:30] liked it i couldn't tell you one thing
[43:31] he said
[43:32] i couldn't understand it but i was so
[43:34] drawn to it
[43:35] so drawn to it and i knew it was the
[43:37] truth and i tried to fight it and even
[43:39] in myself i said
[43:41] that that's the kind of life i can't
[43:42] live i mean i looked at it that's that's
[43:45] something you know i never heard of
[43:46] holiness and all these things i mean
[43:48] just just people you know living
[43:50] but what changed why did everything
[43:53] change not when i figured something out
[43:56] everything changed in me when i said
[43:58] that's the truth
[43:59] it was that moment right there and i had
[44:02] heard the cds i had heard brother
[44:04] branham four or five years prior to it
[44:07] and nothing happened
[44:09] but when i came and i humbled myself
[44:12] i humbled myself and said i believe we
[44:15] ought to live the way that man preaches
[44:17] from that time
[44:20] brother branham preaches that sermon
[44:21] from that time
[44:23] there's a decision time there's a point
[44:26] of turning time
[44:28] and it's not based upon our human
[44:29] intellects it's something way bigger and
[44:32] deeper than that
[44:33] it's something real calm settled simple
[44:37] a sieging of god just waiting for you to
[44:40] get out of the way
[44:41] so that you can humble yourself and say
[44:44] that ain't nothing but the truth
[44:46] and watch what happens from
[44:48] that time
[44:50] so these promises in the word of god are
[44:52] there but it's looking for an individual
[44:54] remember god had to believe his own word
[44:57] for everything to come into its
[44:58] manifested state so he separated himself
[45:01] he put part of himself in a bride now
[45:04] he's waiting for the other part of
[45:06] himself to say that ain't nothing but
[45:08] the truth
[45:09] now you have the two coming together and
[45:12] then it can bring forth the life that
[45:13] god desired the word goes into its
[45:16] manifested state so it's not him that
[45:19] willeth or him that runeth is it anybody
[45:21] that served the lord long enough you can
[45:22] say grace
[45:24] the grace of god
[45:26] brought me safe this far
[45:28] ah the grace of god will take me home i
[45:30] never did do anything right i've been a
[45:33] failure my whole life i'm just so glad
[45:35] god looked for some failures
[45:37] i'm so glad that he was looking and he
[45:39] said i need a couple failures they'll be
[45:41] so weak and broken and constantly
[45:43] rejected that they'll just say god
[45:44] you'll have to take me through
[45:47] that's the kind that he was looking for
[45:48] happy to be one of them
[45:50] sorry we're kind of deviating did we
[45:52] even read psalms 42
[45:54] i'm sorry i'm all over the place
[45:57] psalms
[45:58] 42 we'll just um we'll just start at the
[46:02] top as a heart pantheth after the water
[46:04] book so panteth my soul after thee oh
[46:07] god my soul thirsteth for god or my soul
[46:10] thirsteth for god for the living god
[46:12] when shall i come and appear before god
[46:15] my tears have been my meat day and night
[46:18] while they continually say unto me where
[46:20] is thy god when i remember these things
[46:22] i pour out my soul in me for i had gone
[46:24] with the multitude i went with them to
[46:27] the house of god with the voice of joy
[46:29] and praise with a multitude that kept
[46:32] the holy day
[46:33] why art thou cast down o my soul why art
[46:36] thou disquieted in me hope thou in god
[46:40] for i shall yet praise him
[46:42] for the help the help of his countenance
[46:46] oh my god my soul is cast within me
[46:49] therefore will i remember thee from the
[46:51] land of jordan and from the
[46:53] hermanites from the hill mazar deep
[46:56] calleth unto the deep as the noise of
[46:57] thy water spouts all thy waves and thy
[47:00] builders are gone over me
[47:02] yet the lord
[47:03] will command his lovingkindness in the
[47:06] daytime and in the night his song shall
[47:08] be with me and my prayer unto god
[47:13] in my prayer unto the god of my life i
[47:16] will say unto god my rock
[47:19] why hast thou forgotten me why go i
[47:22] mourning because of the oppression of
[47:24] the enemy
[47:25] as with a sword in my bones mine enemies
[47:28] reproach me while they say daily unto me
[47:32] where is thy god
[47:34] why art thou cast down o my soul why art
[47:37] thou disquieted within me hope thou and
[47:40] god for i shall yet
[47:42] praise him who is the health of my
[47:45] countenance and my god
[47:49] there's a beautiful thing that i think
[47:51] we can associate with here and david
[47:53] it's it it is
[47:55] look at david
[47:56] and the brokenness of david
[47:59] i find that i can identify with david
[48:02] here's a man that was anointed called of
[48:04] god
[48:05] chosen of god to be the king of israel
[48:08] who killed a lion killed a bear killed a
[48:11] goliath in the face of all the other
[48:13] armies
[48:15] do you think that builds your confidence
[48:18] if you brian brother brian if you killed
[48:21] a bear
[48:22] and a lion
[48:23] and an 11-foot giant
[48:26] well you're not a good example you're so
[48:28] tall
[48:30] blake
[48:32] i'm sorry i'm so sorry i didn't mean i
[48:35] don't mean to make jokes sorry
[48:37] it was right there i had to
[48:41] but let's be honest if we did that we
[48:45] killed a lion we kill a bear you kill a
[48:47] goliath in the face of all your brothers
[48:51] that were too afraid to do it
[48:53] does this build your confidence
[48:55] brother you're i don't care if you're
[48:57] two foot tall you're walking 12 foot
[48:58] tall at that time you got your chest out
[49:01] here you're feeling pretty good about
[49:03] yourself
[49:05] in this in this situation right
[49:08] and so
[49:09] david here's a he anointed called out
[49:12] killing lions and bears and goliath left
[49:15] and right i mean
[49:17] and he's crying
[49:19] all the time
[49:21] broken
[49:23] rejected weeping
[49:26] man after god's own heart
[49:28] david stand up be a man
[49:31] david stop your crying why are you so
[49:33] broken up all the time
[49:35] because god had to have a david that
[49:37] could get that low
[49:38] god had to have a man that could be
[49:41] be that great
[49:43] and become that little
[49:45] because he was a type of the lord jesus
[49:47] christ
[49:48] you had to have a shepherd king
[49:50] you had to have a a type of king that no
[49:54] matter what god however god blessed him
[49:57] he always remained a shepherd's heart
[50:00] like king
[50:01] he always had a feeling for his sheep
[50:04] always had a feeling for other people
[50:07] amongst men and warriors he said you'd
[50:08] be too hard for me
[50:10] you'd be two
[50:12] men of war you know
[50:14] but david always expressing the heart of
[50:16] dave you see he's always broken he's
[50:18] always
[50:19] worn out
[50:20] he's got a
[50:21] pillow full of tears it seems like all
[50:23] the time
[50:25] that was the man god chose
[50:27] that was the one he was looking for
[50:30] that was the one who he says that's a
[50:32] man after my own heart did david make
[50:34] mistakes big time
[50:37] big time but he owned them
[50:38] he didn't cover them he owned them he
[50:41] took responsibility for his mistakes he
[50:43] threw himself back into the hands of god
[50:46] and he kept going
[50:48] and god didn't forsake him
[50:50] go ahead and say ah you were doing
[50:51] really good david you were doing really
[50:53] good now i'm done with you
[50:55] no
[50:56] never did it god's love is elective
[50:59] it's not based on performance it's not
[51:01] based on human ability it's not based on
[51:04] intellectual conceptions
[51:07] it's not based on those things it's
[51:10] elective love towards you
[51:12] god so loved you
[51:14] so it was he who did it
[51:17] and we can find this with david that god
[51:20] it's so beautiful how god lifts him up
[51:23] god did it god anointed david god
[51:25] strengthened david god guided that stone
[51:28] god did these things in david's life
[51:30] right
[51:32] so he lifted him up
[51:34] and then he let him fall down
[51:36] so that he could lift him back up
[51:39] god let us do that
[51:41] he does let us do that
[51:43] because the reality of it is in order to
[51:45] know him you got to become like him
[51:48] why is the scripture say learn of me i'm
[51:51] meek and i'm lowly
[51:53] i'm gentle
[51:54] so
[51:55] he's so great like if i i said hey god's
[51:58] here
[51:59] you would be looking for him on the
[52:00] platform
[52:02] and god's so great he'd probably be
[52:04] finding the most obscure spot that he
[52:05] could hide in
[52:07] because god doesn't ever have to put
[52:09] himself forward as great because he
[52:11] knows he's great
[52:12] so great greatness can become very low
[52:16] very low because it doesn't change his
[52:19] greatness
[52:20] his greatness is not based upon what
[52:22] your perception is of him
[52:24] neither is your greatness in the eyes of
[52:25] god based upon the perception of others
[52:28] towards you
[52:29] so it's just so humble it's so simple
[52:32] it's so shockingly simple
[52:34] but yet god in his mercy allows us and
[52:36] that's what i think is happening i could
[52:38] be wrong but i think god is humbling
[52:40] this bride
[52:42] i think in the aspects of maturing the
[52:45] way up was now
[52:47] i believe in the little story brother
[52:49] branham tells about the man who went up
[52:50] to preach the gospel boy he was all
[52:52] prepared he had it ready to go he had
[52:54] every everything lined up so yeah i
[52:56] can't identify with that one but he had
[52:58] us he had his sermon all put together he
[52:59] was really going to wow the folks he
[53:01] went up there and it fell flat as a
[53:02] pancake
[53:04] he said it then he put his notes under
[53:06] his arm bowed his head and walked off
[53:07] the plate and he failed
[53:09] and the old man said now if he would
[53:10] have went up the same way he went down
[53:13] he would came down the same way he went
[53:15] up
[53:17] god had to let him fail
[53:19] god had to let him get broken god had to
[53:21] let him know of his weakness and his
[53:23] littleness
[53:25] and then he says now
[53:27] i can teach you
[53:28] now i can train you now i can take you
[53:31] up
[53:32] you ever notice how in revelations 1
[53:34] when john sees him he drops like a dead
[53:37] man
[53:38] he goes low
[53:40] okay ever notice with job
[53:42] job desired to know god
[53:45] and god had to take him to an ashy
[53:47] before he could take him into his
[53:49] presence so where he could say in the
[53:51] last book of job i have heard of thee
[53:53] but now i see thee
[53:55] you ever noticed this you ever noticed
[53:57] that god has always taken look at joseph
[54:00] why did god take joseph from an anointed
[54:03] young man you're caught out you're
[54:05] anointed i have you're spiritual you're
[54:07] loved of the father i've anointed you
[54:09] joseph
[54:10] and he could see himself he knew he was
[54:12] going to the throne he was spiritual he
[54:14] saw it
[54:15] but then look at the pathway god takes
[54:18] this chosen vessel to the throne
[54:21] it is not the path that you and i would
[54:24] have desired nor chosen
[54:26] but it's exactly what was necessary
[54:29] because what if joseph just would have
[54:31] went to the throne after his brothers
[54:34] had dealt with him the way he they dealt
[54:36] with him
[54:37] i wonder if he would have extended the
[54:39] amount of mercy
[54:41] to his brothers who did what they did to
[54:43] him if he hadn't went through the
[54:46] character building process of potiphar's
[54:48] house in a prison
[54:50] i think it was the potipher's house the
[54:53] rejection the false accusations the
[54:56] prison condition the staying there lord
[54:58] why hast thou forsaken me why is this
[55:01] like this i think it was the years and
[55:03] years in prison and rejection that gave
[55:06] him the character to when he came to the
[55:08] throne he could act accordingly and when
[55:11] he was in the presence of those that
[55:12] falsely accused him he could extend
[55:14] mercy to them and not judgment
[55:18] i think god's training and it's now the
[55:21] maturing of the bride i believe when the
[55:24] last predestinated seed comes and lays
[55:26] in the presence of the sun to ripen
[55:30] let's not bypass the ripening stage
[55:33] we need the ripening
[55:35] the wheat needs to be able to bow its
[55:37] head if it gets harvested before all the
[55:39] greenness is out of it you know what
[55:41] happens it rots
[55:43] it can't survive it can't withstand
[55:45] it's got to be baked
[55:47] it's got to go through a time of
[55:50] sunshine
[55:52] so that it can become low become little
[55:55] become nothing
[55:57] so
[55:58] god ordains the prisons
[56:01] god ordains the asheeps
[56:03] god ordains these things for us it's
[56:05] serving god's purpose
[56:07] serving it in me i wonder if it's
[56:09] serving it in you
[56:10] believe it is
[56:11] god allows these things for a purpose
[56:15] so if you can
[56:16] mind here i just to drop back i i'm
[56:19] really all over the place so
[56:21] thyatira
[56:23] and i find it interesting just so you
[56:24] know i had i had a lot of these notes
[56:27] wrote down before brother chad went into
[56:28] what he went into on wednesday night and
[56:30] talking about these two queens if you
[56:32] notice once the humble meek
[56:34] doesn't make anything happen queen the
[56:35] other one's
[56:36] aggressive forceful and trying to make
[56:38] everything work out a certain way you're
[56:40] seeing two come on the scene again i
[56:41] think we're seeing two come on the scene
[56:43] again i believe when the
[56:45] the true church can recognize the two
[56:47] spirits that work within the framework
[56:48] of the true church
[56:50] one
[56:51] very humble simple
[56:53] long-suffering extends love in any
[56:55] condition the other one watch
[56:57] just watch
[56:58] it'll manifest certain attributes
[57:01] now in the thyatira brother bam says i
[57:03] want to give a warning right here it
[57:05] says concerning these last days that
[57:07] because iniquity does abound the love of
[57:09] many wacks cold this lady's seen age or
[57:11] last age is a self-love
[57:14] a love for material things that take the
[57:16] place of the true love of god we need to
[57:18] guard against the power of sin in these
[57:20] last days so many are getting so hard
[57:23] because they haven't realized the effect
[57:26] of this last day spirit
[57:29] all right
[57:30] so we don't ever let's just see some of
[57:33] the results of it it is time to draw
[57:34] nigh to god and let him fill our lives
[57:36] with love and we may or we will feel the
[57:39] coldness of the last day church and
[57:41] reject the truth of god which alone is
[57:44] able to help us
[57:46] my we better we better stay close to the
[57:48] flame
[57:49] put it that way let's stay close to that
[57:51] fire let's stay in that presence we
[57:53] don't want to get too cold
[57:54] we don't want to get cold at all
[57:57] brother bam says third seal in this
[57:59] great hour now that we're living we see
[58:02] yearly it's getting darker and darker to
[58:04] the world and the coming of the lord
[58:06] gets brighter and brighter as he reveals
[58:08] himself in his word now listen and in
[58:12] his manifestation
[58:14] remember the purpose of god was to take
[58:16] this word and see it in a living epistle
[58:19] of you and me
[58:20] it's an expression it's a manifestation
[58:22] that's his desire not whether or not i
[58:25] can quote it right but whether or not i
[58:27] can
[58:28] humble myself to it to let it flow
[58:32] through me
[58:33] that seven seal christ coming to you can
[58:36] i allow that to be expressed in me can i
[58:40] die out to my will so that his will can
[58:42] be done
[58:43] i find it interesting this is just
[58:44] interesting i'm weird sometimes very
[58:46] much all the time i'll put it that way
[58:49] job now i've really taken a step back on
[58:51] this i've shared it with a couple
[58:52] brothers but why is it when job we know
[58:54] the six seals were in job we all seen
[58:56] those i preached on that a couple years
[58:58] ago god took job through the six seals
[59:01] and then god comes down and speaks to
[59:02] him in a whirlwind and he begins to
[59:04] speak to him and that's when job says
[59:05] i'm putting my hand over my mouth i know
[59:07] nothing
[59:08] and when he begins to do this he brings
[59:09] before him two creatures
[59:11] one of these creatures is behemoth the
[59:12] other one is leviathan
[59:15] and i've always thought
[59:17] this is a strange turn in events
[59:19] god you're coming down to talk to job
[59:21] and you're going to describe what when i
[59:22] was a kid he said two dinosaurs you know
[59:25] but then i began to realize god was
[59:26] bringing him into his presence
[59:29] god's bringing job right into his
[59:30] presence where in the last chapter
[59:32] in uh job 42 he can say i have heard of
[59:34] you with the hearing of the ear but now
[59:35] i see thee you know who he came in
[59:37] contact with you know what's right
[59:39] before um the presence of god behind
[59:41] where's the shekinah glory there's two
[59:43] curtains
[59:44] and there's two cherubs there's two
[59:46] guards that you've got to go through in
[59:49] order before you can go behind the veil
[59:51] and i just preached on that behind the
[59:52] veil that's the curtains the two
[59:53] curtains and the two cherubims and
[59:55] there's two cherubims that you must go
[59:57] through you're not going to go into the
[59:59] shekinah glory you're not going to go
[1:00:01] into the presence of god until you can
[1:00:02] pass through these two cherubs one of
[1:00:05] the one of these creatures that job
[1:00:07] comes in contact with is behemoth who is
[1:00:10] likened unto god
[1:00:12] the other one is this leviathan who can
[1:00:14] tame him he's fierce no man can tame him
[1:00:17] but read the last verse he's the father
[1:00:20] of all the children of pride
[1:00:23] so who are these two covering cherubs
[1:00:25] where was lucifer
[1:00:27] what is the predominant nature of
[1:00:28] lucifer an s
[1:00:30] self-exaltation and a pridefulness and a
[1:00:34] hatred of anybody or anything that would
[1:00:36] keep him from being up in a place of
[1:00:38] authority and high amongst the people
[1:00:41] but look at behemoth the hem of the
[1:00:43] bible the bible says he lieth under in
[1:00:46] the shady places
[1:00:47] he's huge he's powerful but he's docile
[1:00:51] timid he lays
[1:00:53] out amongst the other animals this great
[1:00:56] great being
[1:00:58] but i love something else it says but he
[1:00:59] drinketh up the jordan with one drink
[1:01:02] that's what it says about this behemoth
[1:01:04] i'm so thankful that he swallowed up
[1:01:06] death in life
[1:01:08] i'm so thankful that you know what
[1:01:09] jordan also represents his death to self
[1:01:11] i'm so thankful that christ could say in
[1:01:13] the garden not my will but thy will be
[1:01:15] done when he overcame himself
[1:01:18] then he could take back the keys of
[1:01:20] death hell in the grave
[1:01:22] he could overcome and take and redeem
[1:01:25] that book because he could overcome
[1:01:27] himself he conquered himself which gave
[1:01:30] him right
[1:01:32] it's a very interesting thought sorry i
[1:01:34] have a strange mind like that sometimes
[1:01:37] so i began to look at these two
[1:01:38] creatures and this two this cherubim
[1:01:41] this father of all the children of prime
[1:01:43] why does god take job before he can take
[1:01:45] him into the presence he takes him to a
[1:01:47] bit of a showdown
[1:01:49] takes him again to another showdown
[1:01:51] between these two creatures job which
[1:01:52] one would you like to be identified with
[1:01:54] job which one you know these the closer
[1:01:56] you get to god remember where was
[1:01:58] lucifer
[1:01:59] very close to god
[1:02:01] the closer you get to him the greater
[1:02:04] the
[1:02:05] oh boy the test becomes
[1:02:07] can i say that i don't know if i'm
[1:02:08] saying that right but the closer you get
[1:02:11] brother be careful you're getting more
[1:02:13] and more into a dangerous position
[1:02:15] because lucifer was so close that he
[1:02:16] himself exalted himself in the presence
[1:02:19] of god he put his will above god's will
[1:02:21] this was a dangerous position
[1:02:24] but
[1:02:25] by god's grace job overcame
[1:02:27] job was ushered in he could say i say
[1:02:29] nothing
[1:02:30] i shut my mouth i put my hand over my
[1:02:32] mouth god you're god you do what you
[1:02:34] want
[1:02:35] and so we find out there's this pressure
[1:02:38] building
[1:02:39] there's these obstacles that must be
[1:02:41] overcome
[1:02:43] okay i would just keep reading a little
[1:02:44] bit continue to lay this out god hiding
[1:02:47] himself in simplicity and revealing
[1:02:49] himself the same we are so smart and
[1:02:52] intellectual in our churches till we can
[1:02:53] build a million dollar building in a 10
[1:02:55] million building and yet trying to build
[1:02:57] one better than the methodist or the
[1:02:58] baptist or build one better than the
[1:03:00] presbyterian the pentecostals they got
[1:03:02] into that rat race and by the thing of
[1:03:05] it is this we are yet we are so smart
[1:03:08] and we are so set in our ways until we
[1:03:10] fail to humble ourselves to realize that
[1:03:13] god that's in the little mission on the
[1:03:16] corner see that's right well that's we
[1:03:18] stumble in simplicity we've always done
[1:03:21] it now they were they were too smart to
[1:03:23] believe such a simple message it wasn't
[1:03:26] polished up enough from their scientific
[1:03:28] researches that they that they'd had it
[1:03:30] wasn't it wasn't brilliant the message
[1:03:33] wasn't enough for their educational
[1:03:35] program that they had in that day see
[1:03:38] they studied to know that there was a
[1:03:40] god and they studied to know that he was
[1:03:42] great and they tried to build themselves
[1:03:45] up great with him
[1:03:47] when the way up was always down
[1:03:50] beautiful ain't it the way up was always
[1:03:52] down
[1:03:53] so we know that god is doing something
[1:03:55] great
[1:03:56] but in order for us to actually see what
[1:03:57] he's doing we've got to become very
[1:03:58] little
[1:03:59] very very very very little i think paul
[1:04:01] said that i may know him in the
[1:04:02] fellowship of his sufferings
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:08] now god is moving his church and he
[1:04:10] showed all we've been keeping up the
[1:04:12] lamb up now for quite a while watching
[1:04:15] seeing what he is doing watching his
[1:04:17] nature and everything but now the token
[1:04:19] has got to be applied it's got to be
[1:04:21] applied it's the only thing except a man
[1:04:24] be born of spirit and water he will in
[1:04:26] no wise enter in
[1:04:27] what
[1:04:28] and should love one another believers
[1:04:30] should separate themselves from the
[1:04:32] world don't just take it now lightly now
[1:04:34] you people that's listening to this on
[1:04:35] tape you women you men you listen for me
[1:04:38] for a minute if you ever believe me you
[1:04:41] believe it now it's time to quit fussing
[1:04:43] with one another believe the message of
[1:04:46] the bible believe jesus christ and love
[1:04:50] and honor and respect one another
[1:04:53] men respect your wives you respect your
[1:04:56] homes
[1:04:57] bring your home together because
[1:04:59] remember this lamb was for the home
[1:05:03] not just one
[1:05:04] but for the whole home
[1:05:06] two had to be brought everything had to
[1:05:08] be brought in we should love one another
[1:05:11] and believers should separate themselves
[1:05:13] from the world
[1:05:15] very interesting
[1:05:17] very interesting what this seven sealant
[1:05:19] display does
[1:05:20] very interesting the type of love and
[1:05:23] long suffering and
[1:05:24] uh
[1:05:25] what charity does and it's an act in its
[1:05:28] action form
[1:05:30] done talking about it i think it's time
[1:05:32] to manifest it
[1:05:34] i think brother bam says it's not enough
[1:05:35] to agree with the message it's time to
[1:05:36] get into the message
[1:05:38] it's not enough to say yes that's the
[1:05:39] lamb yes the lamb took the book but you
[1:05:41] have to say i'm part of this land that's
[1:05:43] taking the book that's loosing the seals
[1:05:44] it's bringing this word into its
[1:05:46] manifested state
[1:05:47] that means i can love the unlovely i can
[1:05:50] not reject my dog when he bites me
[1:05:54] i can
[1:05:55] i can bear with this dog
[1:05:58] or i can bear with my brother
[1:06:01] i can bear with one who differs with me
[1:06:03] the one who does not agree
[1:06:05] he doesn't need to
[1:06:06] that won't change my love towards him
[1:06:09] because if god has changed his form
[1:06:12] did god just change his form
[1:06:14] the mystery of god be made known god
[1:06:16] changed his form he's in bright form but
[1:06:18] did the love of god ever change is it
[1:06:20] still an elective love
[1:06:22] it's an elective love you'll choose to
[1:06:25] love a brother or a sister who doesn't
[1:06:28] love you
[1:06:29] doesn't agree with you
[1:06:31] maybe even think all manner of evil
[1:06:32] against you
[1:06:34] but it doesn't matter
[1:06:35] you don't have to justify your actions
[1:06:38] you don't have to condemn that brother
[1:06:41] you have to love the brother
[1:06:42] you have to bear with that brother
[1:06:44] it doesn't matter anymore
[1:06:46] what does it matter we have nothing to
[1:06:48] prove
[1:06:49] we have nothing we're trying to be we're
[1:06:50] not trying to be anything we were
[1:06:52] nothing to begin with the only thing
[1:06:53] we're trying to be is like the lamb
[1:06:56] just want to be like that lamb
[1:06:59] so we quit our fussing
[1:07:04] jesus
[1:07:05] now let's look at this lamb
[1:07:07] it's considering
[1:07:09] jesus with his head back now walking the
[1:07:11] priests were screaming at him making fun
[1:07:13] of him others were crying hosanna but
[1:07:15] did you notice the whole burden of the
[1:07:17] world rested upon him calvary's dark
[1:07:20] hours in gesethme laid before him and oh
[1:07:23] as he went he never even noticed the
[1:07:25] scoffing you know when someone says
[1:07:28] something evil about you and you want to
[1:07:30] take it and get angry about it that
[1:07:33] shows that you haven't went quite deep
[1:07:36] enough yet with god
[1:07:38] big men don't do those things
[1:07:41] that's what made him god to me
[1:07:45] he was big he didn't have to notice
[1:07:47] their little scoffings
[1:07:49] sometimes we so associate maybe
[1:07:53] oh how do i say this sometimes we think
[1:07:56] we would put an equation or an equal
[1:07:58] sign to depth in the word to measure of
[1:08:01] holy ghost
[1:08:02] i don't think that's right
[1:08:05] i don't believe that's right
[1:08:07] i believe
[1:08:09] depth in christ produces a love that can
[1:08:12] prevail
[1:08:14] i believe deep
[1:08:16] anointed men of god can bear one with
[1:08:19] another's burdens
[1:08:21] i think we need to put what's high high
[1:08:24] and what's low low though i have faith
[1:08:26] that i can move mountains though i give
[1:08:28] my body to be burned though i give all
[1:08:29] my riches to the poor and though i have
[1:08:31] knowledge of all the mysteries
[1:08:33] and i have not love i'm nothing i'm a
[1:08:35] tinkling symbol what good am i to begin
[1:08:38] with paul says
[1:08:39] see it's to produce a love it was always
[1:08:42] to be able to produce the literal life
[1:08:44] of christ on display in a sin born
[1:08:47] people that bypassed their theophany
[1:08:50] wow wouldn't achieve that
[1:08:52] that's quite an achievement bypassing
[1:08:54] your own theophany born in a sin body
[1:08:57] with two-thirds of you a fight and devil
[1:08:59] and you know it
[1:09:01] a flesh and a spirit realm that just
[1:09:03] despises god and wants to do all manner
[1:09:05] of evil and yet the love of god so
[1:09:08] conquer you
[1:09:09] to where it can now then go and conquer
[1:09:12] everything that's unlike it
[1:09:15] by love
[1:09:17] not force not aggression not anything
[1:09:20] else
[1:09:21] very interesting that's what made him
[1:09:22] god to me
[1:09:24] you know what makes you god to me when
[1:09:26] you can express that same nature
[1:09:29] i don't recognize god in you because the
[1:09:31] depth you have i recognize god in you
[1:09:33] because i can see the same nature of the
[1:09:35] lamb that i saw there expressed there
[1:09:39] that's that's the difference
[1:09:42] he came to show what god was anything
[1:09:44] that's high and haughty isn't god god is
[1:09:47] low and humble that's what made him god
[1:09:51] see something that comes low not to them
[1:09:54] that goes high
[1:09:56] so god doesn't dwell in hierarchies and
[1:09:58] things or arch and hierarchies he dwells
[1:10:01] in humility the way up is down humble
[1:10:04] yourselves and you will be exalted
[1:10:07] exalt yourself and you will be humbled
[1:10:13] god loves us too much
[1:10:15] sometimes to allow us to exalt ourselves
[1:10:19] i'm so glad really glad
[1:10:22] as uh in god hiding himself in something
[1:10:24] as the old saints said up there oh i
[1:10:26] read this that fellow went up with all
[1:10:29] the education and things said he came
[1:10:30] down whipped out head hanging down
[1:10:32] walking down defeated he said if he'd
[1:10:34] have went up same way he came down he'd
[1:10:36] have came down the same way he went up
[1:10:39] see humble yourself just be humble don't
[1:10:41] be peculiar just love jesus
[1:10:43] say lord if there's any gal in my heart
[1:10:45] if there's anything wrong father i don't
[1:10:47] want to be like that you take it away i
[1:10:50] want to be i don't want to be like that
[1:10:54] sorry i just keep putting this before
[1:10:56] you like david said i put the word
[1:10:59] always before me that i will not sin
[1:11:00] against thee oh god
[1:11:04] and so i had already went through this
[1:11:05] in this journey because i believe we're
[1:11:07] on the same journey i believe we're on
[1:11:08] job's journey
[1:11:09] i believe we're on joseph's journey i
[1:11:11] believe we're walking into the presence
[1:11:13] behind the throne into the shekinah
[1:11:14] light i believe i'm going to sit on the
[1:11:16] throne with him ruling and reigning with
[1:11:18] him
[1:11:19] as kings and priests unto god i believe
[1:11:22] that it's the nature of the lamb on that
[1:11:24] throne both in male and in feminist
[1:11:27] expression
[1:11:28] and i believe that that's where we're at
[1:11:30] but in knowing where i'm going i'm also
[1:11:33] knowing the direction and the pathway by
[1:11:35] which he will get me in the condition to
[1:11:38] sit upon that throne humbled and broken
[1:11:42] god lives dwells
[1:11:44] works in humility never any other way
[1:11:48] it's pretty simple
[1:11:49] that right there is a mouthful god lives
[1:11:53] god dwells
[1:11:54] god works
[1:11:56] in humility
[1:11:57] never can he change from that nature
[1:12:01] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:03] forever when will he become fierce and
[1:12:06] aggressive to get his job done
[1:12:09] never ever ever
[1:12:12] he will forever and always be the lamb
[1:12:16] she will forever and always be the lamb
[1:12:20] never
[1:12:22] never
[1:12:25] sorry this is repetitive but
[1:12:28] uh the way up is down always if you want
[1:12:30] power see how humble you can get just
[1:12:33] get away from your old worldly thinking
[1:12:35] and humble yourself before god and then
[1:12:37] you've got more power than the man that
[1:12:39] can run all over the building and makes
[1:12:41] a big lot of noise see because you've
[1:12:43] been able to conquer yourself and commit
[1:12:45] yourself to christ you see to humble
[1:12:48] yourself before him that's real power
[1:12:51] you show me a church that's real
[1:12:53] real humble not arrogant a church just
[1:12:57] sweet humble church i'll show you a
[1:13:00] church that has favor and power of god
[1:13:02] in it that's right that's the thing it
[1:13:04] takes humility and humbling yourselves
[1:13:07] before god letting god do the work
[1:13:10] through us
[1:13:11] don't have to make a lot of noise don't
[1:13:13] have to make a big show don't have to do
[1:13:15] something for all of you to think great
[1:13:16] about me i just have to be able to be
[1:13:18] humble little live in humility work in
[1:13:22] humility dwell in humility
[1:13:24] there we go
[1:13:26] if you haven't wondered i really want
[1:13:28] our assembly
[1:13:30] to just be humble
[1:13:33] to be simple
[1:13:35] to be little
[1:13:36] and to be fine with that not only fine
[1:13:38] with that be
[1:13:39] oh so excited to be that
[1:13:41] you know i i'm part of you i'm not a
[1:13:44] pastor but i'm here i'm a servant to you
[1:13:45] right i'm called to serve i'm here to
[1:13:48] help you and i this word is to help me
[1:13:50] i'm not above you in any way i'm with
[1:13:52] you here i'm part of you in that regards
[1:13:55] and i so badly want to see this humility
[1:13:57] in me i so badly want to be simple
[1:14:00] humble broken lowly and god just knows
[1:14:03] how to get me there don't he he knows
[1:14:04] how to get us all there
[1:14:08] god has a hard time trying to get
[1:14:10] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:14:12] stay humble and meek and stay in that
[1:14:14] place until god calls him to do
[1:14:16] something you believe that a man that
[1:14:18] god can bless and he'll still keep
[1:14:20] himself a man not an angel or a god
[1:14:23] he wants to become some great person
[1:14:26] what i do see what me me me mine all
[1:14:29] that that's the wrong attitude god's
[1:14:32] hunting for someone who he could who he
[1:14:35] could bless and pour out his blessings
[1:14:37] and the more he blesses the littler the
[1:14:39] man will become
[1:14:40] oh that's a special that's a royal seat
[1:14:43] of abraham that's a special breed of
[1:14:45] people
[1:14:46] god keeps blessing you and you just keep
[1:14:48] getting littler littler don't care what
[1:14:51] anybody thinks about you you just keep
[1:14:53] getting smaller and smaller and not
[1:14:55] interested in
[1:14:56] anything accolades or anything just
[1:14:58] don't matter just make me little
[1:15:01] and you'll never get more of god until
[1:15:03] you become nothing you've got to
[1:15:05] belittle yourself
[1:15:06] and that that he will exalt him god will
[1:15:10] bring a base
[1:15:12] he that will exalt i'm sorry he that
[1:15:14] will exalt himself god will bring a base
[1:15:16] he that will humble himself god will
[1:15:18] exalt you've got to get little before
[1:15:20] you can get big
[1:15:22] and you'll never
[1:15:23] be big in your own self you'll only be
[1:15:26] as big as god will be big in you
[1:15:29] so i can remember back and i could think
[1:15:31] of that drive i went on and i said
[1:15:33] there's no way i believe what he says is
[1:15:34] true but there's no way i can live that
[1:15:35] life i knew it this wasn't like i know
[1:15:38] me
[1:15:39] i knew me i know there's no possible way
[1:15:42] i could be ext with the expression of
[1:15:44] what that man is preaching on those
[1:15:45] tapes but what do i do
[1:15:48] only thing i know to do is humble myself
[1:15:52] and say it's still the truth
[1:15:54] god help me i'll make the first step
[1:15:56] that's all i know to do sometimes that's
[1:15:59] all you have to do
[1:16:01] to be honest with you i think all the
[1:16:02] time
[1:16:03] i think god just gets you to take that
[1:16:05] first step and say humble yourself
[1:16:08] acknowledge me in your presence
[1:16:10] say i know you can't do it say i know i
[1:16:13] can't do it you know you can't do it but
[1:16:15] i know he can do it he's done it too
[1:16:17] many times in the past he's got living
[1:16:20] epistles here that have proven it to us
[1:16:23] our elders amongst us we look up to you
[1:16:25] we appreciate you we know it's the
[1:16:26] sustaining hand of god not you that has
[1:16:28] kept you where you are
[1:16:30] that's what we keep looking at it gives
[1:16:32] us a confidence it's a rock we can stand
[1:16:34] upon because the same god that brought
[1:16:35] brother tommy sister barb through is the
[1:16:37] same god's going to see me through
[1:16:39] same god brother tommy used to say you
[1:16:42] always kind of felt bad about not having
[1:16:43] an education little did you know it was
[1:16:45] the blessings of god wasn't it the
[1:16:47] blessings of god in your life made
[1:16:48] brother tommy have confidence in the
[1:16:50] word that god would have to see him
[1:16:51] through not his human intellectual
[1:16:53] ability to put the pieces of the puzzle
[1:16:55] together so he could be what god wanted
[1:16:57] him to be
[1:16:58] but an unwinding and a breaking of his
[1:17:01] own human ability so that god could be
[1:17:03] what god wanted to be in brother tommy
[1:17:06] that's interesting it's very interesting
[1:17:13] now
[1:17:14] just a couple more i'm sorry
[1:17:16] sorry getting a little long
[1:17:18] the queen of sheba
[1:17:19] and you know great big things is is what
[1:17:22] blinds the eyes of people
[1:17:24] eve was looking for a new light she got
[1:17:27] it the bible said in the last days that
[1:17:30] devils would be would turn themselves
[1:17:32] into ministers of light
[1:17:34] look at the very first sin that was ever
[1:17:37] performed was satan wanted a greater
[1:17:41] brighter kingdom
[1:17:43] a great thing and it went over to the
[1:17:46] north and it set up over his own kingdom
[1:17:49] up
[1:17:50] to outshine michael
[1:17:53] it's always been those bright things
[1:17:56] so when you get to looking around
[1:17:59] remember brother brown says now don't
[1:18:01] don't be shocked he's probably the one
[1:18:02] hiding in a little mission somewhere
[1:18:05] sometimes our own human nature
[1:18:07] looks for big things we look for big
[1:18:08] conventions we look for big ministries
[1:18:11] we look for big things big great hope
[1:18:14] now hold on
[1:18:15] is that the nature of the land
[1:18:17] no
[1:18:18] why is it it seems like when you hear
[1:18:20] stories like well this one's the he's
[1:18:21] the man of the hour for that country and
[1:18:23] this one's the man of the hour for this
[1:18:24] country we've got to have this man over
[1:18:26] the hour over this one oh and he's the
[1:18:27] best preacher in all if you're not
[1:18:29] hearing from this ministry and or if
[1:18:30] you're not in that church or if you're
[1:18:31] not listening to this church you're not
[1:18:33] going to make it you're wrong
[1:18:36] that's wrong that's the wrong spirit
[1:18:38] that does not line up with the spirit of
[1:18:41] god and with the message of this hour
[1:18:44] i promise you there's going to be a
[1:18:46] little obscure preacher in the back
[1:18:48] parts of malawi that you will never hear
[1:18:51] of that is preaching a resurrection
[1:18:54] message that his whole congregation or
[1:18:56] his people are going to take a body
[1:18:58] change and they're going to leave and
[1:19:00] you're going to have great big
[1:19:01] ministries with great big expressions of
[1:19:04] their knowledge and great big attributes
[1:19:06] of their depthness and there's not going
[1:19:08] to be any resurrection life there at all
[1:19:12] you're going to be shocked one of these
[1:19:14] days
[1:19:15] it's going to go right over the heads
[1:19:18] we're always looking for great big
[1:19:20] powerful this that and the other and
[1:19:22] he's going to hide it in such simplicity
[1:19:24] like he did in a manger 2000 years ago
[1:19:27] he has never changed his expression
[1:19:30] when he came he came lowly he came so
[1:19:34] low
[1:19:35] that no one noticed him but shepherds
[1:19:38] only shepherds that didn't have a
[1:19:41] problem with manure didn't have a
[1:19:43] problem with
[1:19:45] you know dirty places didn't have a
[1:19:47] problem with obscure simplicity they
[1:19:49] didn't have a problem with that and
[1:19:51] that's where the king of kings came and
[1:19:53] reside in it
[1:19:54] and if that was his first coming do you
[1:19:56] think he'll change in his second coming
[1:19:59] no he will not change it will be so
[1:20:02] humble it'll be so simple
[1:20:05] this rapture
[1:20:07] this rapture will be so simple
[1:20:10] so humble
[1:20:13] but
[1:20:14] satan if he can't push you one way
[1:20:17] he'll pull you another way
[1:20:20] if he can't get you to reject the word
[1:20:22] he'll try to make you make it more shiny
[1:20:24] and appealing than what god intended it
[1:20:26] to be
[1:20:28] he'll try to make you go out make it
[1:20:30] glossy
[1:20:31] make it real pretty make it real
[1:20:34] attractive
[1:20:36] but if you left the nature of the lamb
[1:20:38] in the process of doing it is it still
[1:20:39] the word
[1:20:41] no it's now a perversion to the word
[1:20:45] see
[1:20:46] what i'm saying well it's a razor's edge
[1:20:48] and you don't think the devil's slick
[1:20:51] my goodness he's been studying
[1:20:54] he's co-equal with god except for
[1:20:57] creation
[1:20:58] he's brilliant
[1:21:00] you better humble yourself in the
[1:21:02] presence of god and realize you are
[1:21:05] against a worthy foe i you know some
[1:21:08] people discount the devil say well you
[1:21:10] say right step all over but you have to
[1:21:12] realize
[1:21:13] you're actually speaking disrespect to
[1:21:15] god when you say that
[1:21:18] god made a worthy opponent
[1:21:21] if god is going to express his great
[1:21:24] strength he had to create a worthy
[1:21:27] opponent
[1:21:29] that was worthy
[1:21:30] respected as a opponent
[1:21:35] so
[1:21:36] i'm not giving devil any accolades here
[1:21:39] i'm just saying
[1:21:40] don't disregard the devil he's studying
[1:21:43] you day and night
[1:21:45] as soon as you start to think he's
[1:21:46] nothing i can kick i'm telling you
[1:21:49] he's got a trap and you're so far
[1:21:51] already into the trap you don't even
[1:21:52] realize it
[1:21:54] you disrespected god and you did not
[1:21:56] humble yourself you exalted yourself and
[1:21:59] i promise you god's got an a a basing
[1:22:02] just for you
[1:22:05] so
[1:22:06] i'm all over the place today
[1:22:12] okay what was i saying yeah look at the
[1:22:14] very thing yep
[1:22:15] yep satan yep trying to make a prettier
[1:22:17] kingdom okay so
[1:22:19] i wanted to continue with this with
[1:22:21] lucifer now um turn your bibles to
[1:22:24] ezekiel this okay
[1:22:29] ezekiel 28 you're all very very very
[1:22:32] familiar with this
[1:22:33] but i want to contrast it here
[1:22:35] soon
[1:22:37] with david
[1:22:39] son of man ezekiel 28 12.
[1:22:43] son of man take up of a lamentation unto
[1:22:45] the king of tyrus and say unto him
[1:22:47] thus saith the lord gods thou sealest up
[1:22:50] the sum full of wisdom perfect in beauty
[1:22:53] thou hast been in the garden er been in
[1:22:56] eden the garden of god every precious
[1:22:58] stone was thy covering the sardis the
[1:23:00] topaz the diamond the world the onyx the
[1:23:01] jasper the sapphire the emerald the
[1:23:03] carbuncle the gold the workmanship of
[1:23:05] thy tabriz and of thy pipes were
[1:23:06] prepared in thee from the day that thou
[1:23:08] was created
[1:23:09] thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:23:12] covereth
[1:23:14] and i have said thee so
[1:23:18] it fulfilled god's great purpose and
[1:23:21] plan to make him as great as he is
[1:23:25] thou ha thou was upon the holy mountain
[1:23:28] of god thou hast walked up and down in
[1:23:31] the midst of the stones of fire
[1:23:33] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:23:36] day that thou was created till iniquity
[1:23:39] was found in thee
[1:23:41] by the multitude of thy merchant texts
[1:23:43] they have filled the midst of thee with
[1:23:46] violence
[1:23:47] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[1:23:49] cast thee as profane out of the mountain
[1:23:52] of god and i would destroy thee o
[1:23:54] covering cherub from the midst of the
[1:23:56] stones of fire thine heart was lifted up
[1:23:59] because of thy beauty thou hast
[1:24:02] corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy
[1:24:05] brightness i will cast thee to the
[1:24:08] ground i will lay thee before kings that
[1:24:11] they may behold thee have you ever been
[1:24:14] so happy that you're not perfect
[1:24:19] i am so happy i'm not perfect
[1:24:23] he was created perfect in all his ways
[1:24:26] we are far from perfection
[1:24:28] he got lifted up in his perfection
[1:24:32] we are being broken down in our lack
[1:24:34] thereof
[1:24:36] are constant you know you think about
[1:24:37] this sometimes your weakness was truly a
[1:24:40] blessing from god
[1:24:41] your inabilities your brokenness were
[1:24:44] those areas that make you weak actually
[1:24:47] that was the thing that god
[1:24:48] blessed you with
[1:24:50] many times that's the thing god blessed
[1:24:51] you with because then it puts you in a
[1:24:53] position you'll humble yourself and say
[1:24:56] lord you help me
[1:24:58] you help me
[1:25:01] continuing to look at isa lucifer
[1:25:04] isaiah you don't have turn then you read
[1:25:06] this
[1:25:07] isaiah 14 thy pomp
[1:25:09] you look up this pomp it's in the greek
[1:25:11] it's self-exalted or to lift oneself up
[1:25:15] not to be lifted up by another but to
[1:25:17] lift yourself up
[1:25:19] is brought down to the grave and the
[1:25:21] noise of thy vials and the worms is
[1:25:23] spread underneath thee and the worms
[1:25:25] cover thee thou art fallen from heaven a
[1:25:27] lucifer thou son of the morning how art
[1:25:29] thou cut down to the ground which did
[1:25:31] weakest the nations now listen to this
[1:25:34] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[1:25:36] ascend
[1:25:38] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:25:41] of god and i will sit also upon the
[1:25:43] mount of the congregations on the side
[1:25:45] of the north i will ascend above the
[1:25:47] heights of the clouds and i will be like
[1:25:50] the most high god
[1:25:52] okay
[1:25:53] a lot of i wills there
[1:25:56] it's very interesting so i
[1:25:58] looked for i wills in the life of david
[1:26:00] a lot of i wills and david too
[1:26:03] you know what david says
[1:26:05] i will
[1:26:06] praise the lord
[1:26:09] i will be glad and rejoice in thee
[1:26:13] i will sing
[1:26:15] praise unto thy name
[1:26:17] i will sing unto the lord because he
[1:26:20] hath dealt bountifully with me
[1:26:22] i the lord is my rock my fortress my
[1:26:25] deliverer my god my strength in whom i
[1:26:28] will trust
[1:26:30] my buckler my horn of salvation and my
[1:26:32] high tower
[1:26:34] this is where you can say amen
[1:26:37] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[1:26:40] to be praised so shall i be saved from
[1:26:42] mine enemies amen
[1:26:45] i will declare thy name unto my brethren
[1:26:48] i in the midst of the congregation i
[1:26:50] will praise thee amen
[1:26:53] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:26:55] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:26:58] why
[1:26:59] because thou art with me
[1:27:02] thy rod thy staff they comfort me
[1:27:05] a psalm and a song of dedication the
[1:27:07] house of david i will extol thee oh lord
[1:27:10] for thou hast lifted me up
[1:27:13] and what time i am afraid i will trust
[1:27:15] in thee
[1:27:17] in god i will praise his word
[1:27:21] in god i have put my trust i will not
[1:27:25] fear what flesh can do unto me
[1:27:28] i listed about 15 there's actually 150
[1:27:31] of them if you'd like to go look for
[1:27:32] yourself
[1:27:34] so you see
[1:27:35] there is a will
[1:27:37] in both expressions
[1:27:39] both are placed before you
[1:27:42] both
[1:27:43] exalts god and a basis himself or one
[1:27:48] not the other one definitely does
[1:27:51] but one exalts god at the same time
[1:27:53] abasing himself where the other one
[1:27:55] abases god to exalt himself
[1:27:58] you see the two cherubs
[1:28:01] you see where god's calling us behind
[1:28:03] the veil you see the great obstacle
[1:28:05] that's before us now
[1:28:08] so
[1:28:10] we've
[1:28:11] we're in a
[1:28:13] we're in a dangerous time
[1:28:15] it's a very dangerous time and that's
[1:28:16] why i think the prophet god said don't
[1:28:18] take this lightly
[1:28:19] don't take this lightly
[1:28:22] um
[1:28:23] i just had this
[1:28:24] if there be musicians you can come
[1:28:27] if there be in here or out on the wires
[1:28:29] of this message and across this nation
[1:28:32] in your little churches and groups and
[1:28:34] halls
[1:28:35] and wherever you're seated if there is
[1:28:37] one oh let me persuade you let me beg
[1:28:40] you as a minister of the gospel
[1:28:42] let me beg you in the name of jesus
[1:28:44] christ
[1:28:46] flee the wrath of this wicked age don't
[1:28:48] serve the god of this evil age
[1:28:51] oh i know you say it's good it's fine
[1:28:53] exactly a mixed tree
[1:28:55] you can't mix knowledge with god's word
[1:28:58] it's a word that is to be believed by
[1:29:01] faith not knowledge
[1:29:03] you don't understand it
[1:29:06] do you understand everything
[1:29:09] no
[1:29:10] but do you accept it
[1:29:12] amen
[1:29:14] it ain't nothing but the truth amen
[1:29:17] you say it's right and then you live by
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:21] that's all he asks you to do
[1:29:24] he didn't ask you to figure it out he
[1:29:26] didn't ask you to try to reproduce it he
[1:29:29] just asked you to believe it
[1:29:31] he said if you'll just believe it and
[1:29:32] accept it you watch what i do for you
[1:29:35] you humble yourself and let me exalt you
[1:29:38] but don't exalt yourself because you
[1:29:40] will be based
[1:29:41] you will certainly be a beast
[1:29:48] oh well musicians make yourself
[1:29:50] comfortable for a moment i forgot one
[1:29:51] portion
[1:29:53] turning your bibles to matthew i thought
[1:29:54] i was done i had one more little section
[1:29:56] here
[1:29:57] you all right
[1:29:58] sorry brother ben you got to stand for a
[1:30:00] moment brother
[1:30:02] matthew 14.
[1:30:05] kind of a
[1:30:06] odd little
[1:30:08] thought but matthew 14
[1:30:12] you all know the story quite quite well
[1:30:16] but it's interesting
[1:30:18] jesus here with his disciples he begins
[1:30:20] to constrain them get them into a boat
[1:30:22] let's read it and straightway jesus
[1:30:23] constrained his disciples to get into a
[1:30:25] ship and to go with him
[1:30:27] to and to go before him unto the other
[1:30:30] side while he sent the multitudes away
[1:30:34] it looks to me like they didn't want to
[1:30:36] go
[1:30:37] i mean why would jesus have to constrain
[1:30:39] them
[1:30:40] it looks like they didn't want to make
[1:30:42] this trip
[1:30:43] they didn't want to do this
[1:30:46] and jesus said no get in the boat
[1:30:49] get in the boat
[1:30:50] and they didn't want to go we just
[1:30:51] didn't want to go it's just interesting
[1:30:53] stop thinking about it for a second
[1:30:55] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[1:30:57] and he went up into the mountains parked
[1:30:59] apart to pray and when the evening was
[1:31:01] come he was there alone but the ship was
[1:31:04] now in the midst of the seas tossed with
[1:31:06] the waves for the wind was contrary and
[1:31:09] in the fourth watch of the night jesus
[1:31:12] went unto them walking on the sea and
[1:31:14] when the disciples saw him walking on
[1:31:16] the sea they were troubled saying is it
[1:31:19] a spirit
[1:31:20] and they cried out for fear but
[1:31:22] straightway jesus spake unto them saying
[1:31:25] be of good cheer it is it is i be not
[1:31:28] afraid and peter answered him and said
[1:31:31] lord if it be thou bid me to come
[1:31:33] unto thee on the water and he said come
[1:31:36] and when peter was come down out of the
[1:31:38] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:31:41] jesus but when he saw the wind
[1:31:44] boisterous he was afraid
[1:31:46] and beginning to sink he cried saying
[1:31:49] lord save me and immediately jesus
[1:31:52] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:31:54] and said unto him o thou of little faith
[1:31:57] wherefore did style doubt
[1:31:59] so god was testing his little people he
[1:32:02] was training brother branham said a
[1:32:03] group of men he never took his eyes off
[1:32:05] of them and he knew exactly what he was
[1:32:07] doing and he constrained them to get
[1:32:09] into a ship knowing full well quite a
[1:32:12] storm's coming
[1:32:13] but when that storm came it just created
[1:32:16] the opportunity
[1:32:18] for that which god knew was in them to
[1:32:21] be expressed
[1:32:23] god many times constrains you to go out
[1:32:26] in a little boat
[1:32:27] with a little revelation with just a
[1:32:29] little rock that you're standing on just
[1:32:32] a little thing god told you to go so you
[1:32:34] obey you stand upon that and then
[1:32:36] everything in life begins to come at you
[1:32:39] men come against you remember the waters
[1:32:41] bible says in revelations waters
[1:32:42] represent multitudes of nations tongues
[1:32:45] and peoples
[1:32:46] and so here's everything coming against
[1:32:48] peter and it's so distracted him he
[1:32:49] turned his eyes away from jesus and
[1:32:51] began to sing but the reality of it was
[1:32:53] god was training some people god knew
[1:32:55] what he was doing god's training some
[1:32:58] people he knows what he's doing
[1:33:00] god's allowing storms to arise
[1:33:02] but he knows what's in her
[1:33:04] he knows how to get what's in her out
[1:33:06] and he knows it'll be because of not
[1:33:08] what she can do but it'll because of
[1:33:10] what he spoke to her as a promise of god
[1:33:13] that you can do it and you'll you'll
[1:33:15] walk according to that revelation and
[1:33:18] you'll go higher than every wave every
[1:33:20] criticism every ridicule every
[1:33:23] despondentness everything that would so
[1:33:25] break you down and try to overcome you
[1:33:27] you'll rise right above it not because
[1:33:29] of your strength but because you've
[1:33:31] fixed your eyes on upon a promise you've
[1:33:34] humbled yourself you said lord that's
[1:33:36] your word i just believe it
[1:33:39] i just believe it
[1:33:41] and so it says in luke
[1:33:44] and there shall be signs in the heavens
[1:33:45] and the moon and in the stars and upon
[1:33:47] the earth distress of nations with
[1:33:50] perplexity are we living in a perplexed
[1:33:52] time
[1:33:53] has anybody looked at the situation said
[1:33:56] ah
[1:33:57] you know you can't you can't go to the
[1:34:00] store right now and be sure you're going
[1:34:01] to get what you're looking for this has
[1:34:03] never happened to americans
[1:34:05] it's sad but come on i mean it is a sad
[1:34:08] problem that we have but reality has
[1:34:10] stead into us you don't know if you
[1:34:11] travel you're going to come home
[1:34:14] i mean this is a perplexing time this
[1:34:16] was this is a time like we've never seen
[1:34:18] we i'm you you i don't look at the news
[1:34:20] hardly anymore it's too discouraging but
[1:34:21] you look at the news there isn't a day
[1:34:23] goes by where it just makes you want to
[1:34:25] vomit
[1:34:26] to see men killing their families
[1:34:29] kids killing their parents there's a
[1:34:31] school shooting in america almost every
[1:34:33] week
[1:34:35] i mean
[1:34:36] it's hell on earth
[1:34:38] this is hell on earth
[1:34:40] hell is spilling over brother branham
[1:34:42] said
[1:34:43] you have people driving people over
[1:34:46] this has become a common everyday thing
[1:34:49] for us in america
[1:34:51] it is sad but it is the reality hell is
[1:34:54] present
[1:34:55] but if hell is present
[1:34:58] heaven's present
[1:34:59] that means that the rock of my salvation
[1:35:01] is here that means that he promised
[1:35:03] he'll be walking with me through the
[1:35:05] valley of the shadow of death i'll be
[1:35:07] with you so i'm going to take you right
[1:35:09] on through i'm going to let the winds
[1:35:10] i'm going to let the waves i'm going to
[1:35:11] let the storm i'm i'ma let the winds
[1:35:13] turn contrary against you but don't you
[1:35:16] worry i've been training you for a long
[1:35:18] time and this time you're not only going
[1:35:21] to walk on water you're going to walk
[1:35:22] from one dimension to another dimension
[1:35:24] this was a promise that he gave and i'm
[1:35:26] still standing on that promise i don't
[1:35:28] know i don't know how he's going to do
[1:35:30] it i'm not trying to figure out the
[1:35:31] mechanics i believe the dynamics
[1:35:34] brother last night we're talking about
[1:35:36] brother enoch and trying to figure and i
[1:35:38] says
[1:35:38] i look at enoch all the time there's
[1:35:40] things i don't understand but i know
[1:35:41] this
[1:35:42] i may not know the mechanics of how
[1:35:44] enoch took that body change but with all
[1:35:46] that's in me i believe the same dynamics
[1:35:48] that was there present with enoch to
[1:35:50] walk out of this world is the same
[1:35:52] dynamics that's here in the presence of
[1:35:54] his people because he promised i'll be
[1:35:57] there with you and if that condition was
[1:35:59] a hell on earth in enoch's day which it
[1:36:01] was satan's eden in full effect and he
[1:36:03] was able to leave one dimension to
[1:36:05] another i believe with all my heart the
[1:36:07] same dynamics is present with us not to
[1:36:10] just heal our bodies but to change the
[1:36:12] molecules from which we are in to take
[1:36:14] that other dimension very very soon
[1:36:17] to the world that sounds insane but why
[1:36:20] is it i believe i'm standing amongst the
[1:36:22] people that say that ain't nothing but
[1:36:23] the truth
[1:36:25] we ain't a scientific people we have no
[1:36:27] clue the mechanics of how this is going
[1:36:28] to happen anybody who says they do they
[1:36:31] know nothing that they ought to know the
[1:36:33] bible says any man that thinketh he
[1:36:35] knoweth anything knoweth nothing that he
[1:36:36] ought to know this one's going to be god
[1:36:39] this one's going to be so humble and
[1:36:41] simple the faith of god expressed in his
[1:36:43] people you're not going to figure it out
[1:36:45] you don't have to figure it out
[1:36:47] i was never commissioned with the that i
[1:36:49] had to figure out the seven seal he said
[1:36:51] you live a simple humble christian life
[1:36:54] when god wants you to know it he'll
[1:36:55] reveal it to you it's just my duty to
[1:36:57] say amen that ain't nothing but the
[1:36:59] truth i believe the rapturing grace is
[1:37:01] on those tapes so i'm going to stay in
[1:37:02] those tapes and i'm going to believe the
[1:37:04] same dynamics that resurrected jesus
[1:37:06] christ from the grave 2000 years ago is
[1:37:08] the same resurrection spirit that's here
[1:37:10] now that's resurrecting me from what i
[1:37:12] once was to what he's ordained me to be
[1:37:15] that picture he took a picture of from
[1:37:17] two i don't know millenniums ago i'm
[1:37:20] coming to that picture
[1:37:22] not of my will but his will
[1:37:25] we can't do it
[1:37:27] you've got to admit we personally can't
[1:37:30] do this
[1:37:31] you must humble yourself at this point
[1:37:33] and say i can't i
[1:37:34] can't do it
[1:37:36] and then he'll say thank you you've been
[1:37:38] learning of me you're becoming meek and
[1:37:41] lowly you're now coming where i'm at
[1:37:44] now that you've come where i'm at take
[1:37:46] my hand
[1:37:47] we're going to go for a walk
[1:37:50] could it be that simple
[1:37:53] will you stand
[1:38:00] we know in this last age we're coming to
[1:38:02] a capstone
[1:38:05] the simplicity of this capstone is
[1:38:07] divine love
[1:38:09] on display
[1:38:11] an elective love on display
[1:38:14] manifesting again as it always has
[1:38:16] i'll close with this scripture
[1:38:18] you don't know it so well though i speak
[1:38:20] with tongue of men and angels and have
[1:38:23] not charity and become a sounding brass
[1:38:26] and though i have gift of prophecy i
[1:38:28] understand all mysteries and all
[1:38:30] knowledge though i have all faith that i
[1:38:32] could remove mountains have not charity
[1:38:35] i'm nothing though i bestow all my goods
[1:38:37] to feed the poor and though i give my
[1:38:39] body to be burned have not charity i
[1:38:41] profiteth nothing
[1:38:43] charity is what
[1:38:45] suffers
[1:38:46] long
[1:38:47] aren't you glad god suffered long for
[1:38:49] you
[1:38:52] now if god suffered long for you
[1:38:54] and it was the becoming god god became
[1:38:57] man so that you could become him
[1:39:00] will god express as a suffering god in
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:05] sure
[1:39:06] that's what the seventh seal is all
[1:39:07] about
[1:39:08] god becoming man
[1:39:12] it is kind
[1:39:14] only to those who speak kind about you
[1:39:16] though
[1:39:18] even when they bite your hand
[1:39:21] no it's kind
[1:39:23] charity envieth not
[1:39:26] doesn't esteem one above another
[1:39:29] doesn't say well you know why do you
[1:39:31] think the bible says don't compare
[1:39:33] yourself one to another don't you ever
[1:39:36] ever ever do that don't say well because
[1:39:38] he's this and i need to be this and if
[1:39:40] he's this then i need to be this and if
[1:39:41] he's that i need don't you ever ever do
[1:39:44] that that is not god
[1:39:47] he made you distinctly you because
[1:39:49] you're distinctly an expression of god
[1:39:51] that only you can express
[1:39:53] only you can do it right so don't ever
[1:39:55] compare yourself one to another you do
[1:39:57] air when you do that bible says that
[1:40:00] charity vaunteth not of itself doesn't
[1:40:03] have to say look at me
[1:40:05] it is not puffed up
[1:40:08] doth not be
[1:40:10] behaveth itself unseemly and seeketh not
[1:40:13] her own
[1:40:14] it always prefers another one before
[1:40:16] itself
[1:40:18] it seeketh not her own and it's not
[1:40:20] easily provoked
[1:40:23] and it thinketh no evil no matter how
[1:40:26] bad they bite
[1:40:30] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[1:40:33] in truth
[1:40:34] it beareth all things
[1:40:36] they believeth all things they hope with
[1:40:39] all things and they endureth all things
[1:40:43] charity never faileth but where there's
[1:40:45] prophecies they'll fail whether there'll
[1:40:47] be tongues they'll cease
[1:40:49] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:40:51] vanish away
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:56] i wouldn't read it or preach it if i
[1:40:58] didn't think it was possible
[1:41:00] i believe it's possible i believe this
[1:41:02] is the hour of the greatest expression
[1:41:04] of god
[1:41:05] since it was 2 000 years ago expressed
[1:41:08] in its fullness i believe you're going
[1:41:09] to see the fullness of christ expressed
[1:41:11] again
[1:41:12] but watch in its expression
[1:41:15] it's going to be very simple
[1:41:17] very humble
[1:41:18] very lowly just like you found him in a
[1:41:21] manger
[1:41:22] in a stable 2 000 years ago
[1:41:25] it would be the same way
[1:41:27] bow your heads for a word of prayer
[1:41:29] please
[1:41:33] heavenly father lord we come before you
[1:41:36] lord we're just so thankful for your
[1:41:38] grace that you've extended to us
[1:41:40] father we
[1:41:41] we know that it's all been your mercy
[1:41:44] and grace to us
[1:41:45] our whole life
[1:41:47] lord we i was looking back on my own
[1:41:49] life i thought you know i didn't choose
[1:41:51] to be born in lime ohio i never chose my
[1:41:55] parents i never had an understanding
[1:41:57] that there would be a people there would
[1:41:59] be a message i never knew any of these
[1:42:00] things lord i was born incapable of
[1:42:03] knowing these
[1:42:04] but through your elective love towards
[1:42:06] me father god you've been guiding me you
[1:42:08] gave me the right parents you gave me
[1:42:11] you put me in the right home in the
[1:42:13] right city in the right
[1:42:17] space of mine i was at the right job i
[1:42:19] had the right grandparents
[1:42:21] lord you had a purpose in all of it as
[1:42:23] from a child how could i deny such a
[1:42:25] thing each and every one of us can say
[1:42:27] the same thing lord we we had certain
[1:42:30] parents we had certain upbringing we had
[1:42:33] certain experiences certain life
[1:42:35] situations lord that many times
[1:42:38] they make us very humble they make us a
[1:42:40] very broken people but lord all the
[1:42:43] while you were just molding us to be
[1:42:46] shepherds
[1:42:48] just humble shepherds you were just
[1:42:50] getting us into a position where we
[1:42:52] would be the right kind of a people to
[1:42:54] appreciate the lamb when he came
[1:42:56] lord a simple humble message
[1:42:59] found by a simple humble people
[1:43:01] that went forth in a simple humble way
[1:43:04] and expressed it
[1:43:05] in a to a people that
[1:43:08] didn't want it lord you've done it
[1:43:11] before and you're doing it again
[1:43:13] and i'm just privileged and honored to
[1:43:15] be a part of that that little group of
[1:43:17] shepherds father
[1:43:19] caring for the lamb holding you up
[1:43:21] before the people
[1:43:22] father i pray that you would have mercy
[1:43:24] upon us we don't
[1:43:26] ask for judge
[1:43:27] justice in our lives we appeal to your
[1:43:29] mercy
[1:43:30] many of us have made so many mistakes i
[1:43:32] certainly have
[1:43:34] lord you never gave up on david and i
[1:43:36] don't believe you're giving up on us as
[1:43:38] a people lord god you're just molding us
[1:43:41] and shaping us into your image father
[1:43:43] so lord wherever we are
[1:43:46] in life whatever mindset we are in may
[1:43:48] we rest upon the promises of god may we
[1:43:51] lift you up with our praises may we lift
[1:43:54] you up in our minds may we constantly
[1:43:57] exhort like david exhorted you i will
[1:44:00] praise thy name i will extol thee i will
[1:44:03] declare thy goodness amongst the nations
[1:44:07] it never came to a point where he lifted
[1:44:09] himself up in this point he constantly
[1:44:11] pushed himself down and lifted you up
[1:44:14] may we be that kind of a people here on
[1:44:16] earth i may not know everything but
[1:44:19] by your grace father may we express the
[1:44:22] love of god in our hearts to the world
[1:44:25] that we're living in this dark dark
[1:44:27] world

[1:51:27] this song so encapsulates this
[1:51:30] condescension that it's beyond our
[1:51:32] mental ability to recognize but it so
[1:51:35] puts him in his rightful place
[1:51:38] as the king that he really is because

[1:56:15] am
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:34] is
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:42] one time just your voice is there

[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:14] [Applause]
[1:57:18] he came
[1:57:20] by
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:36] if i could just uh if you don't mind
[1:57:38] just bound your heads for a word of
[1:57:40] um
[1:57:42] i don't know how to do this exactly but
[1:57:43] i don't know what keeps holding me here
[1:57:45] but
[1:57:46] i don't know if you maybe are here and
[1:57:48] you haven't recognized this great
[1:57:50] condensation that he did for you
[1:57:53] or i really don't even know what i'm
[1:57:55] doing here i don't know if i'm just
[1:57:57] supposed to give someone the opportunity
[1:57:59] to humble themselves and say i don't
[1:58:01] know what to do and i cannot overcome
[1:58:03] but i need you to overcome for me lord
[1:58:05] if that's the case if you might just
[1:58:07] lift up your hands
[1:58:10] and you just from your heart
[1:58:12] really like you did with peter one day
[1:58:14] walking upon the water
[1:58:17] you began to sink and you didn't know
[1:58:19] what to do but to put your hand up and
[1:58:21] ask the lord help me
[1:58:23] if that's your place i don't know why
[1:58:25] but i just feel you should lift up your
[1:58:27] hands
[1:58:28] acknowledge
[1:58:29] your god acknowledge him as god
[1:58:32] and acknowledge your littleness and your
[1:58:34] inability to do this thing that god has
[1:58:37] called you to do
[1:58:38] all he wants you to do is to recognize
[1:58:40] his greatness
[1:58:42] all he ever desired was to have a people
[1:58:45] that would say they love him from their
[1:58:47] heart would live and move and act
[1:58:50] from their heart in everything that they
[1:58:52] did
[1:58:52] not something that they could put on but
[1:58:55] they could just say lord help me
[1:58:57] i can't do it i don't know what to do
[1:59:00] next that's me for sure and i certainly
[1:59:04] have my hand up because i know i can't
[1:59:07] the life is getting so difficult we
[1:59:10] might each and as individuals
[1:59:12] want to give up what's the point of it
[1:59:14] all
[1:59:15] but then i want to ask you a question
[1:59:17] what's happening right now
[1:59:20] what is this that's inside what's this
[1:59:22] moving
[1:59:23] what is here
[1:59:24] that's keeping me here asking you this
[1:59:26] and i've never ever done this and i
[1:59:28] don't know why but all i know is i'm
[1:59:31] supposed to stop for a moment and just
[1:59:34] let you take a declaration
[1:59:36] may this be like
[1:59:38] from that time
[1:59:40] lord i put my hand up and i said
[1:59:42] that time that moment where i recognized
[1:59:46] you were here in my midst and in my
[1:59:48] presence
[1:59:49] i'm just putting up my hands and i need
[1:59:51] your help
[1:59:53] i
[1:59:54] need you to take me
[1:59:56] i'm coming low i found you you're very
[1:59:58] low you're very simple you're very
[2:00:00] humble and i've i'm humbling myself to
[2:00:02] get where you're at
[2:00:04] and now lord i've got my hand reached
[2:00:06] out for you
[2:00:07] will you please take it back

[2:00:47] bible says no man cometh unto god that

[2:00:58] almighty god descended out of the
[2:01:01] heavens of heavens
