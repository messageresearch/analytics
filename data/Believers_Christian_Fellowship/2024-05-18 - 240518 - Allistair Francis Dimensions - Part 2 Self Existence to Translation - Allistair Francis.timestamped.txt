[32:12] which are on earth even in him in whom
[32:18] also we have obtained an
[32:20] inheritance being predestinated
[32:23] according to the purpose of him who
[32:25] worketh all things after the the counsel
[32:28] of his own will amen we're glad for his
[32:32] own will 1 Peter
[32:38] 13:5 blessed be the God and father of
[32:41] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[32:44] His abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[32:48] again unto a lively Hope by the
[32:52] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[32:54] dead talking about that inheritance
[32:57] incorruption
[32:58] able to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[33:03] undefiled that fadeth not away that's
[33:06] your
[33:07] theophany reserved in heaven for
[33:11] you
[33:15] who not
[33:17] what it's not a literal Mansion it's a
[33:22] who who are kept by the power of God
[33:26] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[33:29] revealed in the last time it's a who
[33:32] that has to be revealed in the last time
[33:35] it's not a what it's a
[33:37] who it's your theophany it's the second
[33:41] man the Lord From Heaven we have born
[33:43] the image of the earth earthy the second
[33:45] man is the Lord From Heaven amen that's
[33:48] the image we are going to Bear we are
[33:50] bearing right now Heaven and Earth
[33:53] embracing the Lord bless the reading of
[33:55] his word you may be seated amen
[33:59] we like to greet you once again in the
[34:00] precious name of the Lord Jesus
[34:02] Christ I just want to
[34:05] say I'm just loving your attitude your
[34:09] love for the word it's it's such a
[34:11] pleasure just to preach to people who
[34:12] love the word I can't tell you how easy
[34:16] that makes one feel and also nervous at
[34:20] the same time so I don't know about
[34:23] relaxing we appreciate uh the song
[34:26] special brother Chad really made me
[34:29] chuckle there he said it's so
[34:31] frustrating these people write songs and
[34:34] put the whole Revelation into one song
[34:36] and it takes us 5,000 words to do the
[34:39] same thing when we have to teach it it's
[34:41] just beautiful amen but we thank God for
[34:44] every gift that is dedicated to the Lord
[34:47] so we appreciate your songs of praise
[34:49] and worship amen and all the labor
[34:52] that's been done to make it possible so
[34:56] uh you know how it is and I'm not very
[34:58] good at at all the these things
[35:00] yesterday I forgot to bring greetings
[35:02] from South Africa from our church I was
[35:05] just so stuck you know getting the word
[35:06] across I forgot all the the usual
[35:09] niceties that we have to get through so
[35:12] uh maybe the Saints back home or forgive
[35:14] me for not conveying their greetings
[35:16] anyway you've been
[35:19] told so uh this evening we're going to
[35:22] again continue the fun that we started
[35:25] last night and uh this evening is going
[35:27] to be very different there's going to be
[35:30] a lot of uh pictures drawings animations
[35:35] uh I don't mean cartoon animation like
[35:37] television just PowerPoint
[35:39] animations uh so and and what we're
[35:42] going to do is um and you don't have to
[35:45] take notes I promise you we'll leave the
[35:47] presentation here with the pastor and
[35:50] the tech team and whatever and you can
[35:51] get it all let's just focus in and pay
[35:54] attention to
[35:56] it so also I want to say um from the
[36:00] very beginning whatever I'm going to
[36:02] tell you tonight and whatever we're
[36:04] going to go through I'm still learning I
[36:08] don't have the absolute on it my I want
[36:11] you to discern my spirit this evening I
[36:14] don't want to deceive people it's not my
[36:17] intention to tell you the wrong thing
[36:20] but I'm compelled to say what I see and
[36:23] all I want to do is give you a boost to
[36:28] go and look into it yourself and should
[36:30] you improve on it you share it with me
[36:33] and then we can get better at this
[36:36] because when we talk about things like
[36:38] this being trapped in light matter time
[36:42] I don't believe I have the ability to
[36:45] tell you what the self-existing one was
[36:49] and describe his Essence and describe
[36:52] his being and his frame of mind and to
[36:55] say that God wanted to do this how do I
[36:58] know what he wanted and I can only e
[37:02] either try to imagine or hear the
[37:03] prophet's words and try to uh express it
[37:06] into our simple language to to bring it
[37:09] across but truthfully I'm I'm just
[37:11] floundering like any other Mortal on
[37:13] this Earth with just a little bit more
[37:16] light because of of Malachi 4 so if it's
[37:21] anything that you've not been taught
[37:23] that way or we're talking about bodies
[37:25] you know Paul says some man will come
[37:27] come and ask you know in what body is
[37:29] this and that and here we are today
[37:30] asking the very questions so I just want
[37:34] to make that clear that uh if it's
[37:36] anything that you're not um um used to
[37:40] or you feel uh firm about something just
[37:45] take it with a pinch of salt um I hope
[37:48] that's an American uh expression as
[37:51] well uh and then we can have wonderful
[37:54] fellowship with it so what we're going
[37:56] to talk about about is something that is
[38:00] very dear to me and opened up my entire
[38:04] uh life into this message into the the
[38:08] the opening of the seventh seal and
[38:10] basically everything so we spoke about
[38:12] Dimensions last night and just that
[38:15] subject of Dimensions did you see how
[38:17] many things open up when you talk about
[38:21] hell you're
[38:23] basically a unveiling demonology amen
[38:26] you're that one entire subject on its
[38:29] own demonology when you talk about the
[38:31] realm of communication and ether you're
[38:33] talking about so much more than just
[38:36] waves through which you hear things uh
[38:39] some hearing some of the things the
[38:41] brothers were sharing including brother
[38:42] Chad last night after the service and
[38:44] the things they picked up from it is it
[38:47] just shows you how much bigger it is
[38:49] than what we can must in just one
[38:52] service and if you speak about heaven
[38:55] you you just can't stop
[38:57] um and it open you're not just talking
[38:59] about the seven seal you're talking
[39:01] about The Throne of God you're talking
[39:03] about the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[39:05] amen we talk about and and things you
[39:07] need to understand is like the dimension
[39:10] of Heaven being here it's not like um
[39:14] when you look at the seventh Dimension
[39:15] being the word the seventh dimension in
[39:18] Moses day was the tabernacle the the the
[39:24] the holy of
[39:25] holies that that was Heaven
[39:28] because that's where God was right and
[39:30] all that made up the seventh Dimension
[39:32] was the ark behind the veil amen the
[39:36] prophet
[39:37] Moses and
[39:39] Aaron they were Heaven the Tabernacle
[39:42] was
[39:43] Earth because he said to Moses you shall
[39:46] be God and Aaron thy Prophet which is
[39:50] why the headship of heaven was the The
[39:54] Ark Moses and the high priest because
[39:57] they they were linked by the holiest of
[39:59] holies so if we just think of Heaven as
[40:02] a place we miss those important aspects
[40:06] amen and the things I don't have the
[40:09] time to to take those dimensions and and
[40:11] talk about it over just the weekend is
[40:14] that you can apply that to
[40:17] everything in the church the
[40:20] pastor is part of
[40:25] Heaven the church is the Earth
[40:28] Amen in your home the the Father the
[40:33] husband of the house is heaven the
[40:35] mother is Earth the children are
[40:37] children of the earth those Dimensions
[40:40] apply and if you know what each
[40:42] designation is you can appreciate so
[40:45] much more what your roles
[40:46] are you can actually apply those
[40:49] dimensions and it's really really
[40:50] beautiful Saints All right so this
[40:53] evening we're going to go into this is
[40:56] just my favorite subject of all
[41:00] subjects so this is Dimensions part two
[41:03] and our title is going to be self
[41:05] existence to
[41:07] translation so this is only half the
[41:10] story the other half you are going to
[41:12] have to do so we're going to start from
[41:15] self-existing God to translation and see
[41:19] how the dimensions develop and after the
[41:22] translation you're going to have to do
[41:23] it all the way to the new Heaven and new
[41:26] earth amen that's that's your homework
[41:28] and I'm just giving you the start and
[41:30] you can enjoy it are you ready God bless
[41:33] you all right so we're going to begin
[41:36] with a
[41:38] quote where I love this because brother
[41:41] R says this in many places the four ways
[41:43] of seeing
[41:45] God I'm going to take about four ways to
[41:49] see God he says then we'll come down and
[41:51] make it in the last part of it a way
[41:54] where you'll be have to see God I'm
[41:56] going to show him to you I'm going to
[41:58] show him to you if I can by the help of
[42:01] the whole of the spirit tonight in our
[42:03] in four different
[42:04] manners now first we want to speak of
[42:07] God in his
[42:09] Universe God in his word God in his son
[42:13] then God here in his
[42:15] people and that's when you when you read
[42:18] that you're already reading about
[42:20] Dimensions right I want to show you God
[42:23] in his Universe show you God in his word
[42:25] show you God in his son then see God in
[42:28] his people he preaches this in show us
[42:30] the father and it suffices you're going
[42:31] to see that brother Bram says this in
[42:33] many places I encourage you those of you
[42:35] who love studying go look at the four
[42:37] ways to see God it's absolutely
[42:39] beautiful so can you agree four ways to
[42:44] see God in his Universe in his word in
[42:47] his son notice in his word in his son
[42:53] amen amen the word was the son's
[42:57] Heavenly
[42:58] existence son brother bam says is an
[43:01] Earthly
[43:03] existence amen the word became the sun
[43:06] on Earth the Sun had a beginning and an
[43:10] ending Hebrews Series right and then God
[43:15] in his
[43:16] people so this is very important to know
[43:19] who Jesus was before he was
[43:22] Jesus he was the
[43:25] word and we are taken because we were in
[43:28] the word before he became Jesus on Earth
[43:32] very important for us when we get to the
[43:35] dimensions all right so quick uh um
[43:38] revision on this all right so there's
[43:42] our diagram of the seven dimensions and
[43:46] you'll see there in yellow I've put in
[43:48] the numbers okay and uh brother Ben
[43:52] reminded me it seems last night in all
[43:55] the excitement I had I forgot to mention
[43:58] the fourth dimension running along the
[44:00] side there I I I know you saw it I know
[44:02] we spoke about it I just forgot to
[44:05] highlight it in the sense that that
[44:07] Dimension I just spoke about what's
[44:09] going up and what's going down but if
[44:11] you see that on the side you'll notice
[44:13] the realm of communication the reason
[44:15] it's been placed there is that it is
[44:17] used by both God and the enemy to
[44:21] contact the first three
[44:23] dimensions so but we did say that last
[44:25] night in order to cont contct us both
[44:28] God and Satan use the fourth dimension
[44:31] amen all right so I want you to all
[44:35] memorize this okay if I say heaven you
[44:39] say
[44:40] seven right you ready
[44:45] ether
[44:48] light
[44:50] matter right
[44:52] [Applause]
[44:53] time
[44:55] hell five well done region of
[44:58] angels and the reason why we're doing
[45:00] that is we're going to use the
[45:02] numbers all through this teaching this
[45:04] evening we're going to use the numbers
[45:06] remember what they are right what's
[45:10] seven seven is heaven amen the Lord
[45:15] bless you
[45:16] so seven is the realm of the word six is
[45:20] the the region of angels and we know it
[45:23] became also the regions of the Blessed
[45:26] because after after Christ every person
[45:28] that died in Christ went up into the
[45:31] sixth Dimension that's what the prophet
[45:33] tells us we know that when Christ died
[45:37] Paradise which was in The Fifth
[45:39] Dimension was emptied out and they were
[45:41] taken up into the six the regions of the
[45:43] blessed are you with me all right so and
[45:46] then of course five is hell so now we're
[45:49] going to begin with self-existing one
[45:53] the self-existing one so this is not my
[45:56] fantastic
[45:57] drawing this is a uh an impression I
[46:00] took off the internet which I generally
[46:03] don't do but because brother bam said he
[46:06] was the self-existing one the Fountain
[46:08] of seven
[46:10] colors right so this is just a
[46:12] representation please don't say brother
[46:14] alist drew a picture of God okay this is
[46:17] the self-existing one amen he brother
[46:22] Ram said the Fountain of seven colors
[46:24] before there was anything before there
[46:26] was time
[46:27] before there was an atom before there
[46:30] was anything that was him we don't
[46:33] understand that existence we don't know
[46:35] their existence it wasn't even Heaven
[46:38] that's right because it was just him
[46:41] amen so this wasn't even the seventh
[46:43] Dimension that's right we don't even
[46:45] know what this was are you with us all
[46:48] right no Dimensions no state of
[46:51] existence with relation to
[46:54] man right
[46:58] blessed be his name then brother Benham
[47:00] says in him were many
[47:04] attributes in him was the attribute to
[47:07] be father to be son to be Redeemer to be
[47:10] savior uh to be the lion of the tribe of
[47:13] Judah uh the warrior to be the trumpeter
[47:17] to be uh wife to be husband all the
[47:20] seeds of every potential that could ever
[47:23] be created was in him amen amen amen and
[47:28] those attributes are Eternal
[47:32] attributes because he is eternal amen
[47:35] glory to God and then out of the
[47:39] fountain he says world the logos so
[47:43] that's my impression of world
[47:46] okay I'm going to put in a picture and
[47:50] don't all shout at once it's also I'm
[47:53] putting it there for a particular
[47:54] purpose because you're used to it all
[47:57] right the
[48:02] logos the word sir he was the word now
[48:08] what you're looking at here is the
[48:10] seventh Dimension coming into
[48:13] existence in the beginning was the word
[48:16] the word was with God and the Word was
[48:19] God John 11 so there's our seventh
[48:23] Dimension beginning and notice all the
[48:26] attri rutes that were in the fountain of
[48:28] seven colors the self-existing one is
[48:32] also in the
[48:33] logos he was with God and it was God all
[48:37] those attributes we now now those
[48:40] attributes are changing because the
[48:42] attributes are becoming potential to
[48:45] become word and to become manifested
[48:48] word that's right they're not just
[48:50] Natures existing in a self-existing one
[48:53] they're now becoming the potential to be
[48:56] expressed that's right that's the
[48:58] seventh Dimension this is related to man
[49:00] because God is giving birth to himself
[49:04] with the intent of producing his sons
[49:07] amen that's why this Dimension is coming
[49:09] into existence and this is the seventh
[49:13] Dimension now notice this seventh
[49:15] Dimension like we spoke of last night
[49:17] the seventh Dimension consists of the
[49:19] word Heaven consists of the word this is
[49:21] the word this is his person this is the
[49:24] person of Jesus Christ before he became
[49:27] flesh this is who he really is this is
[49:30] the masculine nature of God who is our
[49:33] husband the husband of our soul before
[49:36] we even knew him amen this is the
[49:40] seventh Dimension he was invisible he
[49:43] was there was nobody to worship him he
[49:45] wasn't even god brother bam says because
[49:47] there was no one to worship him God by
[49:50] the way is an English word it's a
[49:52] terrible English word which uh God
[49:55] didn't even call him self
[49:57] God it is a a designation and a word
[50:01] humans gave I mean what does God even
[50:04] mean something that you subject yourself
[50:06] to something that you worship brother
[50:08] Mar said an object of
[50:10] worship how terrible is it that we can
[50:13] just call him that small word God but it
[50:17] means something to us and he used our
[50:20] understanding to express himself to us
[50:22] through the words we could understand
[50:24] like Elohim yeah right Elohim is a
[50:27] plural meaning Gods it was a canaanitish
[50:31] word which when Abraham arrived he began
[50:33] to speak with that so when you read the
[50:35] first commandment it says I uh am the
[50:38] Lord thy God you shall have no other
[50:40] gods beside me that means I am adoni thy
[50:44] Elohim Thou shalt have no other Elohim
[50:47] besides
[50:49] me that's what the Hebrew actually says
[50:52] Elohim is not actually a name of him it
[50:57] was a word a canaanitish word but he had
[50:59] to express his nature through our
[51:04] words it's wonderful to talk about him
[51:08] amen now this
[51:11] logos means we shared the seventh
[51:15] Dimension with the logos when we were in
[51:17] attribute form amen right we were
[51:20] attributes in him and something happened
[51:23] because in him were masculine attributes
[51:26] and feminine attributes am amen the
[51:30] feminine attributes is that lamb section
[51:32] of the book that feminine those can you
[51:36] see those those dots those attributes
[51:38] within that Circle and so m stands for
[51:41] masculine F stands for feminine right
[51:45] and those names or attributes because
[51:49] they originate from him are the names
[51:52] that can never be blotted
[51:54] out they are not added on right neither
[51:58] can they be blotted out this is not the
[52:00] book of life this is the book of the
[52:02] Lamb's life this is the book of eternal
[52:05] life this is the book of God's life amen
[52:08] and these attributes is who you and I
[52:11] are amen the those attributes found
[52:15] bodies that had come here by permissive
[52:17] will and they lay there by his for
[52:20] knowledge and his predestination till
[52:23] the time he received the Holy Ghost they
[52:25] were dormant and and then they were
[52:27] Quicken to Life by receiving the Holy
[52:29] Ghost and begin to produce and germinate
[52:32] when the word for your day came glory to
[52:36] God you know it's like the book of
[52:39] Psalms somewhere it says Joseph remained
[52:42] in Chains until his word
[52:46] came did you remember that until his
[52:49] word came he couldn't find his position
[52:52] he was doing his own thing he was in
[52:55] prison he was with his brothers was
[52:56] wasting his time he was chosen to save
[52:58] the world in Egypt he remained in Chains
[53:01] fed until his word
[53:04] came that means the the the the time
[53:07] came for his value his election to be
[53:11] made manifest amen amen and this is
[53:15] where every one of your word originated
[53:19] from you can only be what he wants you
[53:21] to be until your word
[53:24] comes amen it's a personal this is why
[53:26] the second coming of the Lord the seven
[53:28] seal is a personal coming I think I may
[53:31] have mentioned it here the last time
[53:33] it's the reason why we don't apply a
[53:36] date to the coming or a time to the
[53:38] coming because I like I said before the
[53:41] first coming to the woman at the well
[53:44] was not the same time as zakus this the
[53:47] first coming to John the Baptist was not
[53:49] the same as it was to Peter it spanned a
[53:52] period of time and even though Peter
[53:55] would have said he hasn't come to John
[53:57] the Baptist he had come right and to the
[54:02] woman at the well if she said he had he
[54:04] had not come to zakus he had come
[54:08] whichever one it was not it didn't have
[54:10] to be a coming where everybody recogniz
[54:13] recognizes it at the same time which is
[54:15] why we don't apply uh doctrines like
[54:18] laws and say well you have to you have
[54:21] to uh understand you have to accept it
[54:23] February 28th 1963 was the coming of the
[54:26] Lord and that's
[54:27] it no the coming of the Lord is when you
[54:30] recognize it to you whether so the date
[54:35] and the time is not significant it's
[54:38] irrelevant it's when it comes to you
[54:40] personally because when it comes to you
[54:41] personally that's when the gene awakens
[54:44] and the coming of the Lord starts
[54:45] working itself inside of you glory to
[54:48] God now this is where it gets better
[54:50] right so there's your seventh
[54:52] Dimension uh Angels brother bam says
[54:55] were created
[54:57] uh and that was the sixth Dimension so
[55:00] Angels was the first creation I love
[55:03] this thought because I I don't know what
[55:06] God was doing I cannot tell you exactly
[55:08] what he had in his mind but he gave the
[55:11] Angels uh free
[55:14] will a lot of people thought they didn't
[55:17] but if they didn't have free will how
[55:18] could they be
[55:20] deceived by uh Satan or Lucifer the son
[55:24] of the morning how could they be
[55:25] deceived if they had no free will if
[55:27] they were just you know programmed
[55:30] things that just stayed there and just
[55:32] bowed down and worship all the time so
[55:35] if you read this this was a new
[55:37] Celestial existence Celestial meaning
[55:40] Heavenly right Angels were just a six
[55:44] Dimension
[55:46] existence Angels were not like the
[55:49] attributes that were in the logos who is
[55:52] us there were an existence of that God
[55:56] created I don't know why brother BR Says
[55:59] angels are messengers why did God need
[56:02] Messengers at that time when he was not
[56:04] sending messenger messages to anyone I
[56:07] don't know I cannot answer that can only
[56:09] tell you what brother bam said there
[56:11] were just a six-dimension existence so
[56:14] remember I told you we just going to use
[56:15] the numbers right so it'll help me if
[56:18] you remember so I don't have to keep
[56:19] saying six Dimension seven Dimension
[56:21] okay there were a sixth existence right
[56:25] not being able to be married to the word
[56:28] angels are cannot be married to the word
[56:32] they don't have a designation where they
[56:34] can be one with the
[56:37] logos are you with us and at that time
[56:41] they were higher than anything else but
[56:43] we're going to see something when Adam
[56:45] is
[56:45] created okay so um we have no idea or
[56:50] evidence to prove what this existence
[56:53] looked like I I just want to I just want
[56:55] to tell you my private thoughts because
[56:59] when I think about when when we we
[57:00] getting to know our husband very well
[57:03] right and and we we get to know his
[57:05] divine nature and we get to know um some
[57:08] of his intentions and and the things
[57:09] that he does he didn't he couldn't have
[57:13] just created uh what I'm saying is I
[57:16] don't want you to imagine in your mind
[57:18] whole bunch of shiny beings that look
[57:20] like light just floating around in in
[57:23] space or standing on some C Cal glass
[57:27] plane with nothing to do except wait for
[57:31] instructions what it more seems like is
[57:34] they had a
[57:35] life right in a sixth Dimension it's it
[57:39] was a physical Celestial
[57:42] Dimension not of light matter time not
[57:44] of flesh but it is nonetheless
[57:48] physical amen they're not Spirits
[57:51] floating around I don't believe they had
[57:55] wings are you with me yes sir the logos
[57:59] made himself visible in this
[58:02] Dimension right that's when it became uh
[58:06] this sixth Dimension he was he was
[58:08] visible to them that means when he made
[58:11] himself visible he took on a
[58:15] 76 existence are you with me this is
[58:19] very very important and hold on to this
[58:22] 76
[58:23] existence okay hold on God so here's the
[58:28] create he creates the first man from one
[58:31] attribute so to create Adam he takes one
[58:35] attribute and he he says let us make man
[58:38] in our image all right and we know if he
[58:42] was a trinity there would have been
[58:43] three attributes in one but it wasn't it
[58:46] was
[58:47] two right here's the man Adam because I
[58:51] don't want to make a picture of a man
[58:53] there right now just these little oval
[58:56] shapes M is for masculine F is for
[58:59] feminine can you see he's a an exact
[59:02] replica of the
[59:04] logos as the logos is full of masculine
[59:07] attributes and feminine attributes the
[59:09] first theophany was masculine and
[59:12] feminine in the day that they were
[59:14] created male and female created he them
[59:18] and that was
[59:20] dominance you shall be God upon the
[59:23] Earth you shall replenish you shall
[59:26] multiply not just multiply themselves
[59:28] multiply every other species in other
[59:31] words make sure the ecological system is
[59:34] in order make sure they bring forth with
[59:36] order be the light to them this
[59:39] theophany was going to become god of the
[59:42] Earth this he he was powerful because he
[59:45] was two attributes in Perfect Harmony am
[59:48] how do we know because everything in
[59:50] this world operates on the same
[59:52] principle you cannot have electricity
[59:55] without two attributes in Perfect
[59:56] Harmony negative and positive charges
[1:00:00] you cannot have magnetism without a
[1:00:02] north and a South Pole in harmony you
[1:00:04] cannot have flow of water without high
[1:00:07] pressure and low pressure everything in
[1:00:10] this life operates on this principle God
[1:00:14] two attributes in Perfect Harmony which
[1:00:16] is why it comes in the end time for it
[1:00:19] to be him complete there has to be a
[1:00:22] feminine designation of him on Earth
[1:00:26] Amen to bring everything in Christ both
[1:00:29] which is in heaven and which is in on
[1:00:31] Earth in one glory to to God so there is
[1:00:36] your first man Genesis 1:
[1:00:38] 12627 and it was
[1:00:42] 67 right so which means they were a 67
[1:00:46] existence yeah right they were
[1:00:50] theophany joined with the
[1:00:53] seven word form body that's what
[1:00:56] theophany is
[1:00:57] Right amen the word form body so that
[1:01:00] was the potential that was the Genesis
[1:01:02] 12627 man beautiful so Genesis 2:7 can
[1:01:08] you see that
[1:01:09] Clearly Now watch that God takes that he
[1:01:13] raises up a body of Flesh and he joins
[1:01:17] this body of Flesh with the theophany
[1:01:20] that is the marriage of Heaven and
[1:01:23] Earth that's Heaven and Earth coming to
[1:01:26] together by the way brother Lonnie
[1:01:28] Jenkins preached this for us when I was
[1:01:31] 16 with two transparencies which he
[1:01:34] placed one and then placed the other one
[1:01:35] on top so I'm not telling you something
[1:01:38] new yeah in case some of you were here I
[1:01:40] hope you were not
[1:01:42] sleeping Genesis 2:7 man right so what
[1:01:47] and this is what we call a glorified
[1:01:49] Earthly body why is it glorified it's an
[1:01:53] Earthly body that is in Union with a
[1:01:56] theophany that's what makes it glorified
[1:01:59] glorified flesh are we together how do
[1:02:02] we know this because brother bam says if
[1:02:04] you take that off the man he is just
[1:02:09] Beast foot of the bare hand of the
[1:02:11] monkey right so Genesis 27 man was flesh
[1:02:17] man this was his new existence
[1:02:21] Dimensions 1 2 6 and
[1:02:24] 7 are we together light matter realm of
[1:02:29] angels and combined with the word this
[1:02:33] is the existence of man being God In the
[1:02:37] Garden of Eden 1 267 notice there is no
[1:02:42] time right because he's
[1:02:46] Eternal three cannot be included in
[1:02:48] there because he's got
[1:02:51] seven this was glorified flesh no time
[1:02:55] no Third Dimension yet Genesis 221 to2
[1:03:00] he then creates the woman notice he
[1:03:03] makes another body of Flesh which he
[1:03:05] pulls out of the man but to be glorified
[1:03:08] all or both of them are covered by the
[1:03:10] same
[1:03:11] theophany giving them both glorified
[1:03:14] flesh because they were one in theophany
[1:03:16] brother Bram said he just took the
[1:03:18] feminist attribute out of the man and
[1:03:20] placed it in the other body but they are
[1:03:23] one in theophany amen are we together
[1:03:25] yeah again this is what the prophet said
[1:03:28] how do I explain this I don't know but
[1:03:31] he even tells you that you husbands and
[1:03:33] wives are one in theophany amen God Amen
[1:03:37] so once again both Adam and Eve have a
[1:03:41] one 267 existence remember what are
[1:03:45] dimensions planes of
[1:03:47] existence linked to man are you with us
[1:03:51] amen glory to God fleshly glorified
[1:03:55] condition again and no Third Dimension
[1:03:57] then we go to the
[1:03:59] fall Genesis 3 man and woman when she
[1:04:04] disbelieved when she reasoned and tried
[1:04:07] to bring forth sons of God by her own
[1:04:11] will what happens they lose six and
[1:04:18] seven they lose they they lose their
[1:04:22] inheritance their Heavenly inheritance
[1:04:24] what did he say
[1:04:26] the day you shall eat thereof you shall
[1:04:28] surely die so immediately they moved
[1:04:32] into light matter and time began in
[1:04:35] their existence because now they were
[1:04:39] dying Fifth Dimension is hell because
[1:04:42] they had forsaken the purpose of God and
[1:04:45] because there was no way yet for them to
[1:04:47] come back to the sixth Dimension if they
[1:04:50] should die they go to paradise so right
[1:04:54] then their existence is 1 2 3 5 light
[1:04:58] matter time and death and Hell begin to
[1:05:01] set in are you with us amen follow the
[1:05:05] Thought So they lost the theophany they
[1:05:08] left with the masculine and feminine
[1:05:10] nature of fleshly man they lost the
[1:05:13] feminine and masculine nature of the
[1:05:16] logos they lost the ability to be God on
[1:05:20] Earth as they stood they were very
[1:05:23] powerful they were the apex predator on
[1:05:25] Earth
[1:05:26] but now the ground was not going to be
[1:05:29] conducive to them it was going to bring
[1:05:31] forth thorns and thistles by the way
[1:05:33] thorns and thistles is not just plants
[1:05:36] with
[1:05:37] aggression thorns and thistles include
[1:05:41] mosquitoes cockroaches stuff to deal
[1:05:44] with death and bacteria it begin to
[1:05:47] evolve into things that should not have
[1:05:49] been right all this yucky stuff that
[1:05:52] that occur because of viruses all those
[1:05:55] things begin into form which were going
[1:05:56] to work against their
[1:05:59] purpose just because they chose their
[1:06:01] own will they went into a 1 2 3 5
[1:06:07] existence wow you know it sounds bad it
[1:06:11] sounds tragic it sounds terrible but
[1:06:13] this is the Glorious story of
[1:06:16] redemption they lost eternity time came
[1:06:19] in and in the day that they eat you
[1:06:21] shall surely die all right 4,000 years
[1:06:24] go by from Adam 4,000 years to Christ
[1:06:28] right in the 4,000 Years brother tells
[1:06:31] us there were two dispensations of God
[1:06:34] two dispensations of the Father the age
[1:06:37] of conscience the age of conscience and
[1:06:39] the age of law is that right and they
[1:06:43] were trying to get back to the original
[1:06:47] the law was even brought in to start
[1:06:49] training the flesh to come back and
[1:06:52] prepare for the first coming of the
[1:06:54] Messiah and and 4,000 years man lived at
[1:06:58] the mercy of the nature of the flesh by
[1:07:01] Noah's time it was so corrupted by this
[1:07:05] 1 2 3 5 existence that God said I've had
[1:07:09] it I'm going to destroy it had it not
[1:07:12] been for Noah keeping his lineages
[1:07:14] perfect it would have all been done he
[1:07:16] had to restart but because Noah was a
[1:07:19] faithful man in that regard God could
[1:07:21] see he could continue it through Noah
[1:07:23] bring the flood and continue it on the
[1:07:25] other other side but they lived at the
[1:07:27] mercy of the nature of Flesh man trying
[1:07:31] to be moral trying to make their own
[1:07:34] morality but they had no influence of
[1:07:37] six and seven why the way to the tree of
[1:07:40] life was
[1:07:41] barred so what's God got to do to bring
[1:07:44] Redemption the whole plan is about
[1:07:47] bringing six and seven
[1:07:49] back the whole point is to for us to
[1:07:51] come back to
[1:07:54] 1267 they struggled by the law to
[1:07:56] control the effects of time and hell
[1:08:01] time and death every religion that is
[1:08:04] existing on Earth is about how to manage
[1:08:07] time and death every human of every
[1:08:10] religion has a solution for what happens
[1:08:13] after death whether it's Muhammad the
[1:08:15] prophet uh Shiva in Hinduism Buddha they
[1:08:19] all have theories about what happens
[1:08:21] after death each one has one has
[1:08:24] meditation one has you need to get close
[1:08:26] to God by being God conscious one has
[1:08:28] you have to believe Muhammad the prophet
[1:08:30] one has uh bahaism one has everybody has
[1:08:35] something uh because they're trying to
[1:08:37] manage what happens with dimensions
[1:08:39] three and five we only have this amount
[1:08:42] of time left if and they're they're
[1:08:44] telling you if within time you can
[1:08:47] become more Godly you can transcend in
[1:08:49] your spirit thereafter the poor state of
[1:08:52] human
[1:08:53] beings struggling yeah with Dimensions 3
[1:08:57] and five they had not the influence of
[1:09:00] the theophany to lead the masculine and
[1:09:02] feminist Natures however look how
[1:09:05] powerful these masculine feminine
[1:09:07] Natures are look at the cities we've
[1:09:09] created the the modes of Transport the
[1:09:13] scientific advancements without the
[1:09:15] influence of six and seven look at how
[1:09:17] powerful man has become right because
[1:09:20] that feminine and masculine attribute is
[1:09:23] by definition God
[1:09:26] God even though it's in now in a
[1:09:28] corrupted form it's
[1:09:32] God
[1:09:34] perverted it had to take the coming of
[1:09:36] the Messiah to start the first half of
[1:09:39] the process so that's where we go
[1:09:41] because what happens when a son of man
[1:09:43] comes in he starts changing
[1:09:46] Dimensions so here's the son of man
[1:09:50] Christ the word veiled in flesh he's
[1:09:53] born into time born of the Virgin notice
[1:09:58] he's born in a time because he's born it
[1:10:00] means it's beginning it means it's time
[1:10:03] so Christ's body was a one two three
[1:10:06] existence light matter time but notice
[1:10:10] there's no
[1:10:12] hell amen amen now watch this he is 1 23
[1:10:18] he's born of the Virgin and we know this
[1:10:20] because they said he was at 33 they he
[1:10:25] was trying trying to tell them before
[1:10:26] Abraham was I am before Moses and they
[1:10:29] say but you look like you're about 50
[1:10:31] years old that tells us his flesh was
[1:10:33] actually aging that's right it was
[1:10:35] subject to time that's right and we know
[1:10:38] that cuz he was born from an infant and
[1:10:40] began to grow so the Savior himself left
[1:10:45] eternity the Loos himself left eternity
[1:10:49] and came into time yeah eternity
[1:10:52] stepping into time subjecting himself to
[1:10:55] time to the dimension of time to our
[1:10:58] existence so he could bring us back to
[1:11:00] six and
[1:11:03] seven but there he was 1 2 3 that was
[1:11:07] his body but he was different he was the
[1:11:11] word veiled in
[1:11:13] flesh this is the mystery because the
[1:11:16] seventh Dimension was within him amen as
[1:11:20] opposed to Adam who was flesh and the
[1:11:23] Seven dimension veiling him yeah right
[1:11:28] remember that seven Dimension veiling
[1:11:30] him they were naked and they knew it not
[1:11:33] Christ wore clothes
[1:11:35] yeah and the seventh Dimension was
[1:11:37] veiled it was God veiled in flesh praise
[1:11:41] be to God this body has time in it so it
[1:11:46] ages even though it veils the seventh
[1:11:49] doesn't that give you hope am because
[1:11:52] here we are born of a woman this tells
[1:11:54] us this is possible possible this tells
[1:11:56] us at some point should the seven
[1:11:59] Dimension come down this is a possible
[1:12:02] existence that I can be the word veiled
[1:12:04] in flesh glory to God that's why it's so
[1:12:08] important to understand
[1:12:10] Dimensions amen beautiful then at
[1:12:13] Calvary we were just speaking about this
[1:12:15] the other day in Gethsemane brother
[1:12:17] Benham
[1:12:19] says the god part left
[1:12:22] him leaves him because God cannot
[1:12:27] die but his body which was the word made
[1:12:31] flesh had to die on the cross to be the
[1:12:34] perfect sacrifice to be sacrificed for
[1:12:37] us for our sin to redeem us back to him
[1:12:41] then the dimensions shift again because
[1:12:44] when he dies he descends into hell he
[1:12:48] leaves his body of matter in the
[1:12:51] Tomb and his time and and he be and he
[1:12:56] he moves into the dimension of hell so
[1:12:59] he's got an existence of being a spirit
[1:13:02] he's descending into hell to
[1:13:04] release those who are in the existence
[1:13:06] of
[1:13:07] five
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:12] Amen brother bam says this by the way I
[1:13:15] don't have time to read all the quotes
[1:13:16] I'm I'm taking it that you know it amen
[1:13:18] in the message in tment his body was
[1:13:20] left there he went into hell to preach
[1:13:23] to the souls that were in prison he says
[1:13:25] that ins Souls that are in prison now
[1:13:27] you remember that so he enters the fifth
[1:13:31] Christ the
[1:13:33] word dies so he can go into the fifth
[1:13:37] and release those who died in
[1:13:41] God this was David said you he will
[1:13:43] never leave my soul in Hell amen I think
[1:13:47] that was
[1:13:49] prophecy hell and the keys of death at
[1:13:52] the time he descended to take the power
[1:13:54] of death away from man now remember what
[1:13:57] is 35 35 is what was added when Adam
[1:14:02] sinned he became
[1:14:04] 35 to go and release that and take the
[1:14:07] power of death Hell In The Grave away
[1:14:10] from man so now we know there's hope for
[1:14:14] every one of us that is born after
[1:14:15] Christ it is possible for three and five
[1:14:18] to be taken
[1:14:19] out glory amen oh I love him so in the
[1:14:25] Resurrection now these are the things we
[1:14:26] love to talk about love to question love
[1:14:28] to fellowship about what body did he
[1:14:30] appear and what happened here what
[1:14:31] happened there how could he disappear
[1:14:33] how could he go through
[1:14:35] walls who
[1:14:37] knows in the resurrection he comes up
[1:14:41] out of hell he comes into a
[1:14:44] 1267 light matter his theophany is now
[1:14:48] veiling him how do we know Mary comes to
[1:14:53] the tomb
[1:14:55] he looks like a man her eyes are open he
[1:14:58] looks like the gner yeah and she says
[1:15:01] Where have you put the body of my Lord
[1:15:03] at one point he says why seek ye the
[1:15:06] living amongst the dead oh that's
[1:15:10] Dimensions right there why seek you the
[1:15:12] living amongst the dead and then you
[1:15:14] know they answer really strangely and
[1:15:16] then they begin to walk away and he
[1:15:18] calls her name and then she turns around
[1:15:20] and re why didn't she see him if he was
[1:15:23] the same Jesus
[1:15:25] who resurrected in that body with nail
[1:15:28] scars and blood all of that stuff on him
[1:15:31] you you you might be uh theological
[1:15:34] enough to say well their eyes were
[1:15:36] Holden why were their eyes Holden
[1:15:39] because he came up in a glorified form
[1:15:42] he was now the second Adam
[1:15:46] 1267 who had just released the 35 from
[1:15:50] human existence made there a potential
[1:15:54] to lose the effects of death and hell
[1:15:56] and he's standing there with them in a
[1:15:58] glorified condition and they cannot see
[1:16:00] him they cannot recognize him maybe
[1:16:04] because he he died like a 33y old man
[1:16:07] but now he was looking different he had
[1:16:10] to be different because if he
[1:16:12] resurrected with with scars and like an
[1:16:15] old man then that's telling us that
[1:16:17] that's how we're going to be resurrected
[1:16:19] the glorified body is a perfect
[1:16:22] body now you see why I told you that
[1:16:26] these things can be complicated because
[1:16:28] for so long we've been told he came out
[1:16:31] with nail scars and holdes in his hand I
[1:16:35] know what you think just remember I've
[1:16:37] read all that too it says but Thomas
[1:16:39] asked it doesn't say he showed Thomas
[1:16:43] right he says he discerned Thomas and
[1:16:45] the moment he discerned Thomas it
[1:16:47] doesn't even say Thomas looked it says
[1:16:50] Thomas Fell to his face my Lord and my
[1:16:53] God now I don't know I cannot tell
[1:16:56] perhaps he's able to move between here
[1:16:58] and there perhaps he has the ability to
[1:17:00] become whatever he wants to because he's
[1:17:02] the word but he comes up in the
[1:17:04] resurrection in a glorified Form 1 2 6
[1:17:08] and 7 in this Resurrection he was
[1:17:10] reunited with his theophany he was now
[1:17:12] glorified flesh like Adam the Eden
[1:17:15] condition of the masculine restored
[1:17:18] first coming amen there was no more time
[1:17:21] in him he's moving toward eternity again
[1:17:25] this may also explain why it was not
[1:17:27] easy to recognize him he was able to
[1:17:29] move at any time between 671 to
[1:17:33] 67 right because if you're in a
[1:17:36] dimension faster than this one there's
[1:17:38] no wall
[1:17:41] there he just shift and every time they
[1:17:44] see him they can't recognize him they
[1:17:46] see a guy there on the shore and he's
[1:17:47] doing something and the who is he they
[1:17:49] just saw him they just testified they
[1:17:52] saw him then they see him again and they
[1:17:54] can't recognize him what's going on I
[1:17:55] mean how many times can the eyes be
[1:17:59] beholden what it's telling you is
[1:18:01] Shifting between
[1:18:03] dimensions and then he has to keep
[1:18:05] revealing himself saying it is I when he
[1:18:07] appeared in the room they thought it was
[1:18:08] a ghost again he told them who he was he
[1:18:13] appears again and they're frightened
[1:18:14] every time because being in light matter
[1:18:17] a time this is different to see him in
[1:18:20] this form you know I hear when brother
[1:18:23] bam speaks about the Ang standing in his
[1:18:25] room and brother Billy Paul's testimony
[1:18:27] of I wow I would have passed out
[1:18:33] honestly I would have definitely passed
[1:18:35] out what what would it be like to see
[1:18:38] his Angelic
[1:18:40] form to have your eyes open to see into
[1:18:44] that
[1:18:46] Dimension
[1:18:47] W something are you still with us so he
[1:18:51] leaves his glorified Earthly existence
[1:18:54] this is now his
[1:18:56] Ascension 1267 right before their eyes
[1:18:59] where they're looking at him tangible
[1:19:01] he's now about to leave their existence
[1:19:03] and move back to the word form are we
[1:19:06] together amen went back to the existence
[1:19:09] he had before he came he remained in the
[1:19:12] state of existence for the seven church
[1:19:14] ases right how do we know because Paul
[1:19:17] meets him on the way to Damascus there's
[1:19:19] a quote brother brandham said Paul met
[1:19:21] him in the form that he was before he
[1:19:23] came yeah he was and he said I am Jesus
[1:19:27] the first time the Loos identifying
[1:19:29] himself as Jesus brother bar said that
[1:19:32] was his word for now I'm telling you
[1:19:34] again I read all the quotes I know what
[1:19:36] what the things that brother maram says
[1:19:38] some of the most confusing things
[1:19:40] brother man said he went up into heaven
[1:19:43] his body lay on the Altar for a memorial
[1:19:46] and his theophany sits on the
[1:19:50] throne and when we read this we're
[1:19:52] confused this is a prophet talking
[1:19:55] yes this is prophets tell you what they
[1:19:57] see they don't explain what they
[1:20:00] see how could this happen literally in
[1:20:03] the form that brother bam said it
[1:20:05] because if Jesus was alive now his
[1:20:07] body's laying on the altar while he's
[1:20:09] sitting in theophany on the throne does
[1:20:11] it mean Jesus died
[1:20:13] again that his body is laying dead in
[1:20:16] Heaven on the altar obviously this is
[1:20:19] symbolic that the blood still
[1:20:22] applies that there's always going to be
[1:20:24] salvation for you whenever you accept it
[1:20:28] but as to whether the body is literally
[1:20:30] laying there on an altar in a seventh
[1:20:33] Dimension lying dead while he's sitting
[1:20:35] in theophany that really doesn't mesh
[1:20:38] with who God is I feel like we when we
[1:20:41] get the open book we need to look with
[1:20:43] eyes that are much more looking into the
[1:20:46] vision and understand you know I I like
[1:20:48] like I told you yesterday I know there
[1:20:51] might be people who say yeah but there's
[1:20:53] this quote that he that he spoke about
[1:20:54] in 53 where he speaks about when he is
[1:20:57] ascending and brother bam is talking
[1:20:59] about it in a very romanticized way and
[1:21:01] he's saying I can see him go past the
[1:21:03] Moon and the Sun and the Stars you say
[1:21:06] brother Alistar you were wrong Heaven is
[1:21:07] a place beyond the stars cuz there's
[1:21:09] what brother Bram said and that was 53
[1:21:11] but then in in after the seals he then
[1:21:14] tells you Heaven is not there it's here
[1:21:18] just a dimension faster than this one so
[1:21:20] which one am I going to take the one
[1:21:23] after the seals have been open
[1:21:25] we we can argue as much with quotes
[1:21:28] everywhere but it you need to place them
[1:21:31] in perspective in the right context and
[1:21:34] in the time because brother bam was
[1:21:35] learning as he was going are you with us
[1:21:39] glory to
[1:21:40] God this that we're seeing in the first
[1:21:42] coming is not even the Glorious part as
[1:21:45] to what happens to
[1:21:48] us amen amen glory to God so he ascends
[1:21:52] he goes back to the word form that he
[1:21:55] was before the foundation of the world
[1:21:58] he goes back to his word existence
[1:22:00] that's what brother bam says so here's
[1:22:03] the church ages can you all see that
[1:22:05] this is you this is me this is all the
[1:22:09] humans in the church ages we have a 1 2
[1:22:13] 3 five existence right we are light
[1:22:16] matter time and at any point this body
[1:22:20] is a child of death going to hell if
[1:22:25] there is no salvation so which means we
[1:22:28] are living in light matter time and we
[1:22:30] are being directly affected by The Fifth
[1:22:33] Dimension we were
[1:22:35] Sinners we were being influenced by a
[1:22:37] lower Dimension so our existence without
[1:22:40] the word without god without coming to
[1:22:43] Christ is 1 2 35 do you agree this is
[1:22:46] what in other words we're in the
[1:22:48] condition when Adam and Eve sinned all
[1:22:51] humans have this condition are you with
[1:22:53] us young people
[1:22:55] this is why you need the Holy Ghost what
[1:22:57] is the Holy Ghost given for yeah the Hol
[1:23:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:23:02] temporary
[1:23:03] gift amen why it was given when you had
[1:23:07] no Revelation it was a gift to do
[1:23:13] something
[1:23:16] amen because as long as you were linked
[1:23:18] to hell you are not going to be able to
[1:23:22] believe the B those leaks of Fire
[1:23:25] in case you didn't realize that might
[1:23:26] look like a yellow bear porw or
[1:23:28] something licks of fire just a symbol of
[1:23:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost when that
[1:23:34] comes upon you it blocks and suppresses
[1:23:37] the influence of hell what does it give
[1:23:39] you the ability to believe the word that
[1:23:43] is coming for your age if the Holy Ghost
[1:23:46] does not come you have no ear to hear
[1:23:49] what the spirit says unto the churches
[1:23:52] that's why the Holy Ghost came in the
[1:23:53] church AG
[1:23:55] dispensation young people you cannot
[1:23:57] hear his word without receiving the
[1:23:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen thank God
[1:24:02] for that so he died and he said I pray
[1:24:05] the father will send you the comforter
[1:24:07] who will guide you into all truth the
[1:24:09] Holy Spirit of Promise he is going to
[1:24:12] suppress the Beast nature that came by
[1:24:15] The Fifth Dimension and give you the
[1:24:17] ability to believe every word that comes
[1:24:19] by the messenger for your day praise be
[1:24:22] to
[1:24:23] God Amen amen seven so what is the Holy
[1:24:28] Ghost it is the anointing of the seventh
[1:24:32] Dimension that's what he first sent so
[1:24:34] before he sends you the seven Dimension
[1:24:36] before the seven Dimension comes upon
[1:24:38] you he sends you the Holy Ghost which is
[1:24:40] the anointing of the seventh Dimension
[1:24:43] the the seventh Dimension anointing
[1:24:45] gives you dominance over the effects of
[1:24:49] death and Hell notice what happened to
[1:24:51] the people in the church ages when they
[1:24:53] receive the Gospel of of Christ these
[1:24:55] people marched forward yeah what people
[1:24:58] in their right Minds would walk into a
[1:25:00] circus of lions praising
[1:25:04] God not afraid of lions bears being
[1:25:07] chopped in half sorn and under who can
[1:25:10] do that in a 1 2 3 5 existence everyone
[1:25:13] would run in fear but they had this holy
[1:25:16] ghost on them which gave them the
[1:25:18] ability to overcome death and hell and
[1:25:22] not be afraid they stood there while
[1:25:23] being eaten alive praising God and to
[1:25:27] the the there were spoil Sports to the
[1:25:30] Romans who were looking at them
[1:25:31] expecting them to scream and shout and
[1:25:33] cry and and protest instead these people
[1:25:36] were dying
[1:25:39] willingly Oh Glory to God they were in 1
[1:25:43] 2 35 received the Holy Ghost suppressing
[1:25:47] the Beast Nature by anointing them with
[1:25:49] the
[1:25:50] seventh now they could uh easily lose
[1:25:54] this anointing this is why if you
[1:25:57] receive the Holy Ghost by disbelieving
[1:26:00] you can lose
[1:26:02] it the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:06] remember brother mam said justification
[1:26:07] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:26:09] Ghost must make way for the person of
[1:26:12] Christ that's the ultimate the Son of
[1:26:15] God dispensation that is the Holy Ghost
[1:26:17] dispensation over 2,000 years is a
[1:26:20] temporary dispensation it's leading us
[1:26:23] to move moving into the next part of the
[1:26:26] disp of the dimensions are you with us
[1:26:29] so uh you could have the Holy Ghost you
[1:26:32] could be Anointed with the gift of
[1:26:34] tongues interpretation prophecy and then
[1:26:36] you could lose
[1:26:37] it we've seen that what does this prove
[1:26:41] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:26:43] unjust there are many one two three of
[1:26:46] five people who were in the church in
[1:26:49] the message under the prophet received
[1:26:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made real
[1:26:53] prophecies and when the the seven seal
[1:26:54] came they rejected it and lost it
[1:26:58] amen this Holy Ghost was a temporary
[1:27:02] anointing and it was an evolving
[1:27:04] anointing it started with a lion went to
[1:27:07] an ox went to a man anointing and went
[1:27:10] to an eagle anointed but even that comes
[1:27:13] to an end because it must make way for
[1:27:15] the
[1:27:16] lamb glory to God who by the way is the
[1:27:20] fifth beast in the throne hallelujah
[1:27:23] amen if they accepted the messenger they
[1:27:26] received a part of the seven inside
[1:27:30] that's right because remember the word
[1:27:32] came in a part portion Paul brought a
[1:27:35] portion of the word irus brought a
[1:27:38] portion so if they receive the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:27:43] he receives the word for his day and
[1:27:45] he's able to overcome he becomes the
[1:27:47] Overcomer to which there is a reward in
[1:27:50] the church ages right the reward to
[1:27:52] every Overcomer and that gave them
[1:27:55] access to Dimension six that if they
[1:27:59] kept that until they died they passed
[1:28:02] into the sixth
[1:28:03] Dimension beautiful amen glory to God
[1:28:07] receive the Holy Ghost if you die you
[1:28:09] have a promise you have an assurance
[1:28:12] that you pass into the realm of the
[1:28:14] Blessed refuse and reject the word for
[1:28:16] your day you just go back to 1 2 3 5 sir
[1:28:20] and your end is five yes amen amen are
[1:28:24] you having
[1:28:27] fun looks like we're going to finish
[1:28:31] early seven seal brings him back to
[1:28:34] Earth hallelu here is the seven seal
[1:28:37] amen now here are you 1 2 3 you've
[1:28:42] accepted the message of the hour you
[1:28:43] you've received the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:45] Ghost you are enjoying the word for your
[1:28:48] day and now reached the day when the
[1:28:51] seven seal is about to be opened
[1:28:56] right he appears yes
[1:29:00] sir February 28 1963 brother bam said
[1:29:04] Angels was his
[1:29:07] wig 6 and
[1:29:09] Seven Angels were
[1:29:12] six you you remember that Angels was his
[1:29:15] it made him visible to
[1:29:19] mankind what who is it that that's come
[1:29:22] it's him that's right it's it's him who
[1:29:24] was there before the foundation of the
[1:29:25] world it's him who made all things that
[1:29:28] are glory to God made him visible made
[1:29:32] him visible to a Son of God standing on
[1:29:35] Earth waiting to receive ready to
[1:29:37] receive the word to impart it to the
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:42] people so what does he bring he brings
[1:29:47] an open book amen where is he taking
[1:29:50] that open book too to the vessel who has
[1:29:54] the Holy Ghost who's about to receive
[1:29:56] the open book and what is he giving to
[1:29:59] him what is the open book it's
[1:30:02] Heaven he has to eat that right what
[1:30:05] happens there's the dimensions coming
[1:30:08] together all that was in Heaven is
[1:30:10] coming to Earth the dispensation the
[1:30:12] fullness of times it's about to become
[1:30:14] one with a fleshly body that has been
[1:30:17] anointed by the Holy Ghost on Earth this
[1:30:19] is the
[1:30:21] marriage the book coming down and it's
[1:30:23] got to be
[1:30:24] eaten amen glory to God March 17 to 24
[1:30:29] 1963 it
[1:30:32] happens amen and he begins to preach the
[1:30:36] seals and he reveals the seals this is
[1:30:38] the part that people stumble at because
[1:30:41] this is exactly what happens the book
[1:30:44] descended what you're looking at is
[1:30:46] Revelations 10 occurring he descended
[1:30:49] placing one foot on the earth one foot
[1:30:52] on the sea what is that right
[1:30:56] suppressing two spirits that are
[1:30:57] preventing the book what is it out of
[1:31:00] the sea was arising a beast with seven
[1:31:03] heads and 10
[1:31:04] horns right the other was a beast who is
[1:31:08] like a lamb but spig like a dragon and
[1:31:11] both would lead the world to the mark of
[1:31:12] the beast he comes placing one foot on
[1:31:15] the land one foot on the sea with an
[1:31:17] open book in his hand and cries with a
[1:31:19] loud voice and there's a seventh
[1:31:21] Messenger on Earth to receive the book
[1:31:24] and now give it to the people this is a
[1:31:27] son of man revealing the son of man it's
[1:31:30] proving to us that a 1 2 3 can receive
[1:31:33] the seven Dimension it was the first
[1:31:36] fruits it was the wave sheath that there
[1:31:39] is a bride to come that there's a crop
[1:31:41] to grow glory to God we are see we have
[1:31:44] to see this if we don't see this you
[1:31:46] cannot believe it for yourself glory to
[1:31:49] God and that's what happens the book
[1:31:52] comes inside and for the first time in a
[1:31:56] long time we see 1 2 3 7 now I'm asking
[1:32:01] you look at the configuration of the
[1:32:03] dimensions this is not even Adam from
[1:32:05] the beginning this is Christ do you
[1:32:09] remember that in a body of time with the
[1:32:12] word veiled in flesh this is happening
[1:32:15] to you this happened in our day this is
[1:32:18] Dimensions coming together the
[1:32:20] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:32:22] Heaven and Earth embracing we saw it
[1:32:25] happen there from March 17 to March 24
[1:32:27] 1963 did he have faults yes did he
[1:32:32] forget things yes was he still learning
[1:32:35] yes but he was still eating the book he
[1:32:39] was still seeing more he is growing the
[1:32:41] word is growing in him this is leading
[1:32:44] us to a translation and if that body
[1:32:47] should die he goes straight back to
[1:32:50] where he came from Amen to where that
[1:32:53] book was if you have that book you have
[1:32:55] the ability to walk out of death you
[1:32:59] have the ability to take control of all
[1:33:01] Dimensions you have the ability to cast
[1:33:04] out every lying Spirit you have the
[1:33:06] ability to discern all things you have
[1:33:09] the ability to understand everything in
[1:33:11] the word because you have seen the
[1:33:13] revelation of who he is this is the
[1:33:16] condition one
[1:33:18] 237 Christ the same state of existence
[1:33:23] as the first coming but this is not the
[1:33:25] end because time is
[1:33:28] there that means seven Thunders have to
[1:33:32] utter their voices to every person glory
[1:33:35] to God and this is where we come in we
[1:33:39] then come in under the third pool
[1:33:40] Ministry we never met this a son of man
[1:33:43] revealing the son of man we begin to
[1:33:45] hear about it but we begin to eat the
[1:33:48] book because the book has been preached
[1:33:51] we don't we don't come in under the
[1:33:52] first and second pool Ministry we are
[1:33:55] excited we are called by the third pole
[1:33:58] that's what called us we're not
[1:34:00] impressed by signs wonders Miracles
[1:34:02] emotions Sensations we are
[1:34:05] marry be it unto me according to Thy
[1:34:07] word let me do as you will amen we are
[1:34:12] virgin born Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:14] Christ receiving the word in a virgin
[1:34:17] womb to bring forth the word like never
[1:34:20] before it's never been seen in the
[1:34:22] church ages this is taking place at the
[1:34:24] end under the third poor Ministry eat
[1:34:27] the book and now you must prophesy amen
[1:34:31] speak the word to all generations to all
[1:34:34] kindreds tongues and tribes and people
[1:34:37] this is our Revival this is what we're
[1:34:39] here for this is what's happening does
[1:34:42] it happen to everyone at once no each
[1:34:45] one of us is receiving it as we are
[1:34:47] called each one of us is maturing as it
[1:34:49] comes more and more and more we don't
[1:34:52] limit it to a day or a time that's up to
[1:34:55] God only the father knows when you
[1:34:57] should receive it only the father knows
[1:34:59] when you should receive it only the
[1:35:01] father knows when you should receive it
[1:35:03] it's not a collective thing it's a
[1:35:05] secret that even the enemy and The Fifth
[1:35:08] Dimension knows nothing about because
[1:35:11] had they known it they would have done
[1:35:12] something about it those enemy Spirits
[1:35:15] those evil spirits they tried lies there
[1:35:17] were preachers that came there were
[1:35:18] false doctrines that came the bride some
[1:35:21] of you sat under false doctrines but
[1:35:23] your womb was closed you didn't receive
[1:35:26] those false things the womb was closed
[1:35:29] waiting for the seven seal to open to
[1:35:31] you personally don't feel bad if you sat
[1:35:33] under false Doctrine I believe the fact
[1:35:36] that you are seeing the open book today
[1:35:37] means that your womb was closed he knew
[1:35:41] you he predestinated You by for
[1:35:43] knowledge he knew what part you should
[1:35:44] take he knew you would be here today

[1:39:06] no idea what's happening to you fear of
[1:39:09] death hell there's no there's peace I'm
[1:39:13] feeling

[1:39:26] amen and this is what you
[1:39:28] become this is what happens in the
[1:39:30] Rapture you move into your six seven
[1:39:33] existence because this is the one you
[1:39:36] bypassed you came from attribute form
[1:39:39] straight to the flesh brother Bram says
[1:39:42] you were never the word form you were
[1:39:44] attribute you are becoming the
[1:39:47] word amen this is restoration Saints now

[1:39:57] thing is a headstone that's right
[1:40:00] amen that's right amen can you see it
[1:40:04] that's right that means you become him
[1:40:07] what does it mean that you become him
[1:40:08] you are taking on his
[1:40:10] existence he the logos took on a 67
[1:40:14] existence his Dimensions his his
[1:40:17] existence he came away from
[1:40:19] self-existing one made himself visible
[1:40:21] in a Celestial dimension
[1:40:23] you are becoming his
[1:40:26] existence that's what it means by you
[1:40:28] becoming him we're not saying you're
[1:40:30] becoming Jesus Christ physically who was
[1:40:33] there 2,000 years ago he's giving you
[1:40:36] his
[1:40:38] existence six and seven that's what it
[1:40:40] means by you becoming him you bypass
[1:40:43] that and the Plan of Redemption takes
[1:40:45] you back to become that oh Saints it
[1:40:49] should make you stand on your feet and
[1:40:51] praise the Lord glory to God
[1:40:54] 126 was Adam Heavenly glorified body
[1:40:58] this is going to the marriage supper of
[1:40:59] the lamb now this is not Spirits
[1:41:02] floating around the 67 condition is a
[1:41:05] physical condition yes sir yeah can I
[1:41:08] explain it no I can't but it's a
[1:41:10] physical Celestial body when brother bam
[1:41:13] went beyond the curtain of time he saw
[1:41:15] them they didn't look like Spirits he he
[1:41:18] preached they would be like Spirits at
[1:41:21] you know at sometime when the prophet
[1:41:22] speaks
[1:41:24] he speaks about uh uh um what do you
[1:41:27] call it he speaks about a a a spirit
[1:41:29] formed body at one time I think he even
[1:41:31] said they were in theophany in
[1:41:33] hell did you come across that quote some
[1:41:37] time ago before the seals were open he
[1:41:39] speaks about but he he's trying to say
[1:41:41] it's a spirit body because he had the
[1:41:43] idea that theophany would be a spirit
[1:41:45] body until God took him beyond the
[1:41:47] curtain of time and he said I was so
[1:41:50] wrong
[1:41:53] amen if God did not take that Prophet
[1:41:56] beyond the curtain of time what would we
[1:41:58] know about anything we'd be leaving we'd
[1:42:01] be believing Catholic fables Protestant
[1:42:04] fables Pentecostal anointings
[1:42:06] Pentecostal fables we'd be trying to
[1:42:09] find our excitement in those things we'd
[1:42:11] be ignorant that's why the church Ages
[1:42:14] was an age of ignorance Grace was
[1:42:17] available for ignorance but ignorance is
[1:42:20] over amen because the fullness of the
[1:42:23] the word has come amen the Throne of God
[1:42:26] is descended upon Mankind and this is
[1:42:29] our state we come from Glory we come
[1:42:32] from the logos we bypassed our theophany
[1:42:35] because of Adam's sin we come into this
[1:42:38] body of Flesh he predestines his body by
[1:42:41] four knowledge to a 67 existence this is
[1:42:45] what you are predestinated to according
[1:42:47] to the purpose of his own will you have
[1:42:50] an inheritance of God incorrect
[1:42:53] corruptable not our flesh amen and when
[1:42:57] your eyes are open when that trumpet
[1:42:59] sounds this in this corruptible will
[1:43:02] become Incorruptible amen this body of
[1:43:06] sin goes back into a six s existence
[1:43:09] which we bypass that's the whole point
[1:43:12] of the message that's there is no other
[1:43:15] part of Christianity that can bring you
[1:43:17] to this there's no hope for mankind
[1:43:20] unless we finish the race there's no
[1:43:22] hope hope for mankind unless we take the
[1:43:25] book did not it say all was lost If no
[1:43:30] man took the book and John wept and the
[1:43:33] lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed he
[1:43:35] turns and he sees 1 2
[1:43:39] 37 a lamb who was worthy to take the
[1:43:43] book and lose the seals for mankind for
[1:43:45] what reason to bring us back to our
[1:43:48] theophany to restore us back to our
[1:43:50] inheritance in heaven incorruptible that
[1:43:53] does not perish that does not fade away
[1:43:56] glory to God we shared the logos once
[1:44:00] with him in atribute form but now we
[1:44:03] share the existence in Celestial form
[1:44:06] amen he did all that for us
[1:44:08] Saints I want to
[1:44:11] close with who is this
[1:44:13] mzc everything we've been speaking about
[1:44:15] I want to I want to tell you I didn't
[1:44:17] you going to say brother Alis how this
[1:44:19] is you making things up no everything
[1:44:22] I've showed you is from all over the
[1:44:25] message right in the beginning before we
[1:44:29] read this in the beginning whatever I
[1:44:32] spoke to you about the logos and the
[1:44:34] light forming the little Halo where's
[1:44:36] that from cood question one Genesis
[1:44:41] 1 it's the most amazing thing to read
[1:44:45] when you read it he talks about God his
[1:44:48] the whole question is about created man
[1:44:51] and formed man amen that was the
[1:44:53] question and then he starts to explain
[1:44:56] how he begin to make the universe and he
[1:44:59] took this rock and threw it through
[1:45:01] space and he says
[1:45:03] stop and he said the logos was like like
[1:45:06] the child playing before the
[1:45:09] father again if you take everything
[1:45:12] literal then the logos was a child
[1:45:15] playing before the father no this is the
[1:45:18] prophet he is using his his human
[1:45:21] faculties to try and describ something
[1:45:24] glorious beyond measure whatever God is
[1:45:27] showing him I don't even know if I would
[1:45:30] be able to explain that and I had more
[1:45:32] education than the prophet I had a
[1:45:33] better vocabulary than him I definitely
[1:45:36] have better grammar than him but could I
[1:45:39] explain what he saw with English with
[1:45:43] French with German with Dutch with any
[1:45:45] language with
[1:45:46] Hebrew how could we but he said like a
[1:45:50] like a child playing before the father
[1:45:53] throws out something it becomes a Galaxy
[1:45:56] there goes the sun there goes this thing
[1:45:58] there goes that thing there's Angels
[1:46:00] form and then he takes on his form and
[1:46:02] he says let us create
[1:46:05] man
[1:46:06] Saints I didn't make that up that's from
[1:46:10] Cod amen everything else I spoke did I
[1:46:14] make up that seven left him in
[1:46:16] Gethsemane brother bam said he could not
[1:46:19] die God he had to become a man to to die
[1:46:23] I didn't make that up did I make up that
[1:46:25] he went down into a hell condition to
[1:46:28] take the keys of death hell in the grave
[1:46:30] no that's in the message did I make up
[1:46:33] what happened in the church ages with
[1:46:34] the Holy Ghost with you receiving the
[1:46:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:46:38] Ghost how would I know the Holy Ghost
[1:46:40] makes way for the person unless he says
[1:46:42] that in there's a man who can turn on
[1:46:44] the
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:47] light nothing that we've said is not
[1:46:49] from the message so what I want to read
[1:46:51] to you now I want to show you how easy
[1:46:54] it is for us to misinterpret a quote
[1:46:57] right as we close we're closing so
[1:47:00] brother Chad the musicians can begin to
[1:47:03] come
[1:47:04] up but I want to show you how that when
[1:47:08] we read this be this this quote is so
[1:47:11] beautiful it starts stirring all those
[1:47:14] juices inside amen but it's so easy to
[1:47:18] let humanism take over and misinterpret
[1:47:21] something which is what what we've done
[1:47:23] in the past with all the quotes with all
[1:47:25] the scriptures amen but it's glorious
[1:47:29] let's read I love this and then when you
[1:47:33] become subject to that Spirit it throws
[1:47:37] your whole body subject to that spirit
[1:47:39] amen what's that 1 2 3 receiving the
[1:47:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost right you
[1:47:46] become subject to that Spirit you don't
[1:47:47] become subject to Hell anymore and that
[1:47:49] spirit is nothing in the world but the
[1:47:51] seed word made manifest or quickened
[1:47:54] that's what happens when the Holy Ghost
[1:47:56] comes upon you the attribute that was
[1:47:59] dormant becomes starts manifes and gets
[1:48:02] quickened isn't that right in Rising of
[1:48:04] the sun he said that sun is upon you now
[1:48:08] it quickened the dirt it quickened the
[1:48:10] seed inside he said your soul changed
[1:48:13] didn't it
[1:48:16] amen amen Made Alive and when the Bible
[1:48:19] said don't do this that body quickly
[1:48:21] turns to it there is no question if that
[1:48:24] Spirit did not come upon you you would
[1:48:26] not obey the
[1:48:29] word
[1:48:31] oh I missed that and what is it it's the
[1:48:35] earnest of the Resurrection amen this
[1:48:37] body will be raised up again because
[1:48:40] it's already
[1:48:45] started started what the
[1:48:49] resurrection already you have been
[1:48:51] resurrected
[1:48:53] from death into life what life seven
[1:48:57] Dimension is now upon you amen what is
[1:49:01] it the earnest of the Resurrection so
[1:49:03] the Holy Ghost was the earnest of the
[1:49:05] Resurrection The Resurrection has
[1:49:07] already begun its process did I make
[1:49:09] that up did we read that together all
[1:49:13] right that proves we all have gray cells
[1:49:15] in our
[1:49:16] head and the Holy Spirit in our
[1:49:19] hearts amen this body will be raised up
[1:49:22] because it's already started it was once
[1:49:24] this body was once subject to sin you
[1:49:27] agree it was once 1 2 35 and me and
[1:49:31] Corruption and now it's got the
[1:49:34] earnest the Holy Ghost it's turned
[1:49:38] Heavenly that means it's ready to accept
[1:49:41] seven amen now that's the earnest you're
[1:49:45] going in the Rapture that's the earnest
[1:49:48] that there's a
[1:49:49] translation that you're coming to six
[1:49:51] and seven it's the earnest the Holy
[1:49:53] Ghost is the earnest you know what
[1:49:55] Earnest is he says is the down payment
[1:49:57] money he says a sick person lying laying
[1:50:01] dying nothing but left but death that's
[1:50:03] all can happen it's seen Shadows of
[1:50:05] people done eat up with cancer and
[1:50:07] tuberculosis and see them persons a
[1:50:09] little while after that perfectly normal
[1:50:11] and strong if there is no Divine Healing
[1:50:14] then there is no Resurrection cuz Divine
[1:50:16] Healing is the earnest of the
[1:50:18] Resurrection
[1:50:20] amen continuing paragraph 7 6 now this
[1:50:24] body is subject to the spirit have not
[1:50:28] yet entered into the word
[1:50:31] form do you see that which means you're
[1:50:33] still waiting for the six and seven
[1:50:36] you've received you're now subject to
[1:50:38] the Holy Spirit you're subject to the
[1:50:39] Holy Ghost but you have not entered into
[1:50:41] the word form yet so there has to be a
[1:50:45] Breaking of the seven seal because
[1:50:47] that's the purpose that's what we're
[1:50:48] waiting for the word form but we are
[1:50:51] still in the flesh form but subject to
[1:50:53] the word Death In the Flesh will take us
[1:50:56] there which means if you die here
[1:50:59] because you have this you will pass into
[1:51:01] six existence amen but we that are alive
[1:51:03] and remain will pass into six seven
[1:51:06] they're waiting for us to accomplish
[1:51:08] that amen amen just the same thing think
[1:51:11] of a little baby you can take a woman no
[1:51:13] matter how evil she is when she's
[1:51:15] pregnant fixing to be a mother watch
[1:51:17] before that baby is born I don't care
[1:51:19] how cruel the woman is she's gets real
[1:51:21] kind
[1:51:23] what some sweet Spirit comes over her
[1:51:25] there's something about her sound seems
[1:51:28] Godly to see a little mother fixing to
[1:51:30] become a mother by the baby why is it
[1:51:33] that little body now it's not alive yet
[1:51:36] see the only thing is just flesh and
[1:51:38] muscles that little jumping that's just
[1:51:40] muscles jerking but when it comes forth
[1:51:43] from the womb God breathes the breath of
[1:51:45] life into it then he screams out see
[1:51:48] just as sure as there is a natural body
[1:51:52] being form there's a spiritual body to
[1:51:55] receive it as soon as it gets there
[1:51:57] brother B says you can never be in two
[1:51:59] places at once but you can have two
[1:52:01] Natures in you amen when you drop this
[1:52:05] veil of Flesh you take on the next form
[1:52:08] amen that's what he says let's read on
[1:52:11] then when a man is Born
[1:52:14] Again from
[1:52:18] Heaven brother B says the new birth
[1:52:21] today in the say is Christ revealed to
[1:52:24] you
[1:52:25] personally not a Pentecostal experience
[1:52:28] not an altar call the new birth for the
[1:52:30] bride is the person of Christ reveal to
[1:52:34] you personally if you in there it says
[1:52:37] if you read the Bible and don't see
[1:52:39] Christ go back and read it
[1:52:41] again amen so when a man is Born Again
[1:52:45] from Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in
[1:52:48] Christ see you're taking you're eating
[1:52:51] and then
[1:52:52] when this robe of flesh is
[1:52:55] dropped there is a natural body
[1:53:00] theophany natural so when we read
[1:53:02] natural look at how easy it is to
[1:53:06] misinterpret that because we assume
[1:53:08] natural means
[1:53:12] flesh amen it's it it looks it looks
[1:53:16] like Common Sense natural means of
[1:53:19] nature yeah over nature the
[1:53:23] has a nature it is a physical Celestial
[1:53:28] body amen natural does not mean it's
[1:53:31] only subjected to light matter time a
[1:53:34] natural body theophany a body not made
[1:53:38] with hands what does that mean it's not
[1:53:41] born of the flesh it has not one two
[1:53:44] three existence neither born of a woman
[1:53:48] that we go to so if you die you leave 1
[1:53:51] 2 3 and pass into 67 that's theophonic
[1:53:56] representation that's the part we bypass
[1:53:58] and he says then that body what 67
[1:54:03] returns back and picks up the glorified
[1:54:06] body Lord now we have a problem because
[1:54:10] we don't tend to know what brother
[1:54:11] Brandon means when he says glorified
[1:54:14] look how easy it is to misinterpret or
[1:54:16] interpret any way when you read
[1:54:18] glorified body because of how we've been
[1:54:20] taught by Elders for so long you think
[1:54:22] it's Earthly glorified body there's
[1:54:25] nothing wrong with that but do you know
[1:54:27] brother baram says glorified body for
[1:54:29] both theophany and Earthly glorified
[1:54:31] body there's quotes where he said your
[1:54:34] glorified body is standing right there
[1:54:35] next to you now amen see you can't see
[1:54:39] it that's right he standing right next
[1:54:41] to you so which glorified is he talking
[1:54:44] about but we many ministers took this
[1:54:48] quote interpreted and there's nothing
[1:54:49] wrong with that because how we see it in
[1:54:52] the moment is God revealing it to us but
[1:54:55] all I'm saying is we need to look at
[1:54:57] this through dimensions and appreciate
[1:54:59] it for how God brought it to us perhaps
[1:55:02] we need to look at it more than we did
[1:55:04] yesterday amen that body returns back
[1:55:07] here now look it it doesn't say Earthly
[1:55:09] glorified body it doesn't even say does
[1:55:12] it say here that that body returns back
[1:55:14] for the
[1:55:16] resurrection does it say that what if
[1:55:19] that meant for the millennium
[1:55:25] see it's so easy to take all the quotes
[1:55:28] and interpret however we want to the
[1:55:31] truth is most of our questions are
[1:55:35] irrelevant it doesn't matter if you make
[1:55:39] it and turn it into any Doctrine and say
[1:55:42] well this is the Creed of our church
[1:55:45] then you're in trouble because when it
[1:55:47] comes time to see what God wants to
[1:55:48] reveal new to you you cannot do it I
[1:55:51] don't know how this is to be interpreted
[1:55:53] all it says is then that body theophany
[1:55:57] returns back and picks up the glorified
[1:55:59] this can apply to Resurrection and first
[1:56:02] resurrection in the
[1:56:04] Millennium where we come from theophany
[1:56:06] from Marriage supper to pick up the
[1:56:08] glorified body on Earth to live in a
[1:56:11] fleshly glorified body for 1,000 years
[1:56:15] it could mean that that's why I said the
[1:56:18] second half of this is your homework
[1:56:20] amen amen you you can take it from
[1:56:23] translation from Marriage supper and
[1:56:25] take it all the way to new heavens and
[1:56:26] new earth you'll find in new heavens and
[1:56:28] new earth there's no time amen even
[1:56:31] light changes apparently there's no need
[1:56:35] there's no need for light from anything
[1:56:37] else the city has a light of the Lamb
[1:56:39] because there is no
[1:56:40] night things are changing Dimensions
[1:56:42] will change in the new Heaven and new
[1:56:45] earth there's no hell there's no five
[1:56:48] there's no lies there's no doubt amen
[1:56:51] it's a a new existence dimensions are
[1:56:54] going to are going to change back to
[1:56:56] when they never existed before it's
[1:56:59] going to be a new existence what will
[1:57:01] the body look like then I don't know I'm
[1:57:04] sure waiting to find
[1:57:06] out amen that's the reason look there it
[1:57:09] is Jesus went to hell when he died and
[1:57:14] preached to the souls that were in
[1:57:15] prison turned back into that theophany
[1:57:19] did I make it up that he said after he
[1:57:21] came out of hell he went into the
[1:57:23] offering
[1:57:25] 1267 I didn't make it up there it is
[1:57:29] right or marvelous thank God 2
[1:57:31] Corinthians 51 if this Earthly body be
[1:57:34] dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we
[1:57:36] have another one see now this is a part
[1:57:39] I really love we have bypassed that that
[1:57:43] to come so there it is I didn't make it
[1:57:45] up again we bypass that to come straight
[1:57:49] from God the attribute to be flesh to be
[1:57:54] tempted and tested by sin like Adam did
[1:57:58] but when testing of his word is over
[1:58:01] then we are taken up to this body that
[1:58:04] was prepared for us before the
[1:58:06] foundation of the world that six seven
[1:58:09] existence it is the word there that we
[1:58:12] skipped we came from thought to flesh we
[1:58:16] bypass the word form when your word
[1:58:20] comes then you begin your
[1:58:22] purpose amen just like Joseph skipped to
[1:58:26] right around down here to be tempted and
[1:58:28] tested if we'd have come through that
[1:58:30] there have been no temptation we have
[1:58:33] knowed all things that's the reason
[1:58:35] Jesus knowed all things cuz he was word
[1:58:38] before he was flesh then we become the
[1:58:43] word the purpose of you receiving the
[1:58:46] book is to turn the sinful flesh to
[1:58:49] become the word because you B pass the
[1:58:52] word form glory to God you are made you
[1:58:56] receive the condition the existence of
[1:59:00] melkisedek who is melchisedek he was
[1:59:03] without father without mother without
[1:59:06] beginning of days without end of life
[1:59:09] that's where we're going priests Kings
[1:59:12] and Priests after the order of
[1:59:21] meiscraft and you worship began praise
[1:59:24] be to God for we have been made Kings
[1:59:26] and Priests after the order of
[1:59:29] melchisedek with no
[1:59:31] genealogy no earthly birth we have
[1:59:34] passed that we bypassed it once but we
[1:59:37] come to it we become the order of
[1:59:39] melkisedek Kings and Priests of the most
[1:59:42] high God that's the new song of the
[1:59:44] Bride when the book is taken glory to
[1:59:47] God then we become the word amen here we
[1:59:51] are formed here we are formed to the
[1:59:54] word image to be a partaker of the word
[1:59:58] feed on the word by being predestinated
[2:00:02] since the beginning did we make anything
[2:00:05] up tonight you see that little spark of
[2:00:09] life that you had in you from the
[2:00:11] beginning when you started your journey
