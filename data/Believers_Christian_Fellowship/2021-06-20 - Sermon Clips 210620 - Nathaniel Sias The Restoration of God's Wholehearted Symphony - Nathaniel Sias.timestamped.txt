[0:00] brother sometimes we need to pray
[0:03] and say less speak less and say more i
[0:06] should say
[0:08] because when we're doing our part we
[0:11] will
[0:11] see the effect the saints come closer
[0:15] together
[0:16] the harmony gets tighter do you know who
[0:19] has the best harmony
[0:22] maybe maybe you've never heard this or
[0:24] maybe not aware of it but you know the
[0:26] people that can sing together the best
[0:28] have the most beautiful harmony our
[0:31] families
[0:33] because they say all their words the
[0:35] same they have the same accent they have
[0:37] the same way of shaping the words
[0:39] and they sing together and it just comes
[0:40] together so beautifully
[0:42] but friends were supposed to be a family
[0:46] the words that we speak here and speak
[0:48] and speak and speak
[0:49] we're supposed to be expressing them the
[0:51] same way so that when all is brought
[0:53] together in harmony
[0:55] it's perfect
[0:59] the sweetest sounds the sweetest things
[1:01] that god wants to express
[1:04] how do we get there oh there's all this
[1:07] pressure
[1:07] i'm feeling pressure i'm feeling
[1:09] pressure and it's incredible the amount
[1:12] of pressure
[1:13] that an instrument can take do you know
[1:16] why
[1:17] because the instrument that little
[1:19] violin as small as it may be
[1:21] it's designed to handle that pressure
[1:26] it's designed perfectly to handle the
[1:28] pressure
[1:29] and under pressure is when it makes its
[1:32] sweetest sound
[1:35] praise the lord jesus that's exactly
[1:37] where i want to be at
[1:38] i don't care what pressure it is friends
[1:40] i pray that from the bottom of your
[1:42] heart
[1:42] trust the one that made you trust the
[1:46] one
[1:46] that's tuning us up and it might feel
[1:48] like such a pressure
[1:49] that we're going to break but god made
[1:51] the vessel
[1:52] god made the instrument to play the
[1:55] sound
[1:57] and he's the one that's orchestrating he
[1:59] knows exactly
[2:00] what each part is supposed to be played
[2:04] praise the lord and you might feel like
[2:07] you're all
[2:08] alone but friends you're not alone just
[2:10] keep on serving god with your whole
[2:11] heart
[2:12] give him everything
