[11:20] we'll take her home and visit with her
[11:22] so you guys can have her in the foyer
[11:24] and we'll take her home and invisible
[11:26] amen god bless you i also want to let
[11:29] you know i just heard this morning from
[11:30] brother moses cherie b moses and mercy
[11:33] and their children are safely back in
[11:34] u.s soil they made it through they're in
[11:37] chicago and they got late last night in
[11:39] chicago they stayed in the hotel they're
[11:41] streaming this morning and they plan to
[11:43] drive home this afternoon so just be
[11:46] praying for them to have a safe drive
[11:48] home and that they can get well rested
[11:49] when they get home this afternoon or
[11:51] evening
[11:52] amen
[11:54] amen i enjoyed the special this morning
[11:56] sister rachel god bless you thank you
[11:58] for that amen
[12:00] let's look at daniel chapter 2
[12:03] verse 34.
[12:10] thou saw us
[12:12] till that a stone was cut out without
[12:14] hands which smote the image upon his
[12:17] feet that were of iron and clay and
[12:20] break them to pieces
[12:23] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[12:25] silver the gold broke into pieces
[12:28] together and became like the chaff of
[12:30] the summer threshing floor and the wind
[12:32] carried them away that no place was
[12:34] found for them and the stone that smote
[12:36] the image became a great mountain and
[12:38] filled
[12:39] the whole earth
[12:41] amen
[12:42] you may be seated as we ask the lord to
[12:44] bless the reading of his word stay in
[12:46] daniel 2 because we'll keep tr
[12:49] reading but i'd like to title this this
[12:51] morning the smiting stone is the capping
[12:54] stone
[12:56] and so we spoke a couple sundays back
[12:59] on the stumbling stone is the foundation
[13:02] stone amen so the same stone that causes
[13:05] stumbling is also the same stone that is
[13:09] a sure foundation that keeps you from
[13:11] stumbling amen and this is the way it is
[13:13] with christ because christ is the word
[13:15] made manifest and for some he becomes a
[13:19] stumbling stone the manifested word for
[13:20] the day is what they begin to trip over
[13:23] and fall and it causes the fall amen to
[13:25] stumbling and the tripping but for
[13:28] others amen the manifested word for
[13:30] their day becomes a sure foundation they
[13:32] stand upon to keep them from stumbling
[13:36] so it's it's amazing how this works
[13:38] through the scriptures it's the same
[13:40] manifestation it's the same word it's
[13:42] the same lovely lord jesus christ but it
[13:45] depends on your approach to him amen it
[13:47] depends on who you are and your attitude
[13:50] and your approach to him when he's
[13:52] manifest in the day and age that we live
[13:54] depends on whether to him he's a
[13:57] to you he is a stumbling stone or to you
[14:00] he is a sure foundation
[14:03] your support your anchor your tie amen
[14:07] your your surety against stumbling is
[14:10] christ the manifested word but for some
[14:13] he is the the thing that they're
[14:15] stumbling over
[14:18] so so that's the
[14:20] that's the stone that's the revelation
[14:22] christ excuse me jesus christ is the
[14:25] revelation
[14:26] of god he's the mystery of god revealed
[14:29] he is the stone he is the great
[14:31] revelation of the whole bible the stone
[14:34] the revelation of the entire bible is
[14:37] jesus christ
[14:40] so we we talked about the
[14:42] the stumbling stone is the foundation
[14:44] stone but today i'd like to preach on
[14:46] the smiting stone is the capping stone
[14:48] so you have a foundation stone a sure
[14:50] cornerstone but you also have a capping
[14:52] stone or a headstone
[14:54] and the smiting stone is the capping
[14:57] stone so the very stone that came to cap
[15:00] off his church to seal and secure the
[15:03] bride and finish his bride the headship
[15:06] coming to the body the very thing that
[15:08] completes his bride is also the very
[15:09] thing that destroys all gentile systems
[15:11] in all gentile powers and everything of
[15:13] the word everything of the world that is
[15:15] not of the word is destroyed under this
[15:18] capping stone but some it's a smiting
[15:20] stone for others it's a capping stone
[15:24] so we see here in
[15:26] in daniel chapter 2 verse 34
[15:29] and thou saw was still that a stone was
[15:31] cut out of the uh cannot without hands
[15:33] which smote the image that's why i call
[15:35] it a smiting stone it is the stone that
[15:38] smote the image upon his feet and we
[15:40] understand that that a rock and a stone
[15:42] in the scriptures is a revelation amen
[15:45] and so there's a there's a revelation
[15:47] coming forth the revelation of jesus
[15:50] christ amen which is the book of
[15:52] revelation the book of revelation starts
[15:54] off the revelation of jesus christ so
[15:57] the book of revelation is not a it's not
[16:01] a doctrine that we study or teachings
[16:03] that all that's included amen but the
[16:05] book of revelation is the capstone
[16:08] it is the headstone it's the capping off
[16:10] of the entire bible and that capping
[16:12] stone is the revelation of jesus christ
[16:14] it's defined right in revelation chapter
[16:17] one
[16:19] so that's the capstone amen but the
[16:21] capstone is also the foundation stone
[16:23] which is what the revelation of jesus
[16:25] christ because brother bam tells us this
[16:27] entire bible is the revelation of jesus
[16:29] christ if you don't find christ in every
[16:32] line he said go back and read it again
[16:33] for you missed something for the entire
[16:35] bible is the revelation of jesus christ
[16:39] so it's all
[16:41] him
[16:43] so he is the smiting stone that is cut
[16:46] out without
[16:48] hands amen would smote the image upon
[16:51] his feet i also want to talk about that
[16:53] cut out without hands for a moment that
[16:55] means there's no human instrumentality
[16:58] involved amen
[16:59] this this revelation that was cut out it
[17:02] didn't come amen even when it comes in
[17:05] the manifestation of flesh it didn't
[17:07] come by the will and the man a man and a
[17:09] woman coming together to create a baby
[17:11] this revelation when it come into flesh
[17:13] of jesus christ was cut out of the stone
[17:15] without hands nobody did this god
[17:18] himself did this
[17:20] and when the revelation came in our day
[17:22] at the end time it wasn't theologians it
[17:24] wasn't doctors of divinity it wasn't a
[17:26] creed or a dogma of a church system no
[17:29] man had anything to do with this christ
[17:31] himself come amen and he come as an
[17:34] angel amen to that prophet every day and
[17:37] gave him the revelation of the seven
[17:38] seals which was the revelation of christ
[17:41] which was the stone cut out of the
[17:43] mountain without hands brother bannon
[17:45] said i had nothing more to do with it
[17:46] than nothing amen i didn't even know
[17:48] these things myself i would have got it
[17:50] wrong if he hadn't come today
[17:54] so this revelation amen that was jesus
[17:57] christ was the was the manifestation of
[18:00] the invisible god god manifest in flesh
[18:03] that was cut out of the mountain without
[18:05] hands and in the end time the capping
[18:07] stone that comes the great revelation of
[18:08] christ is also cut out of the mountain
[18:10] without hands
[18:13] this bible is beautiful friends
[18:17] you know this bible was written for our
[18:19] day
[18:20] the whole thing
[18:22] then it doesn't mean that it didn't have
[18:24] purpose and didn't serve purpose in the
[18:26] day in which prophecies were coming
[18:28] forth and moses he served a purpose in
[18:30] no way he said the purpose of abraham we
[18:31] know that it's always serving a purpose
[18:33] in the day that it's in but the real
[18:35] purpose of this bible amen is to bring
[18:38] us to our day so that we can see christ
[18:40] unveiled in this word in our day in
[18:43] every story in every character amen in
[18:46] everything that's going on it's
[18:48] revealing the great manifestation of
[18:49] jesus christ that was not going to be
[18:52] revealed until the end time so this
[18:54] bible was written for our day
[18:57] because there had to be patterns laid
[19:00] down in the old testament there had to
[19:02] be there had to be stories if you call
[19:04] them stories manifestations through the
[19:06] life of god's children that would depict
[19:09] christ amen you can see christ in joseph
[19:12] you can see christ in moses amen you can
[19:14] see christ amen and all of these
[19:17] characters you can see christ and moses
[19:19] amen because moses come at a time amen
[19:22] when when when there was a promise of a
[19:24] proper child being born amen in the the
[19:27] political leader of that day was going
[19:29] to kill all the babies to get rid of
[19:31] this prophecy well that foreshadowed the
[19:34] coming of christ in the days of herod
[19:37] so you can see christ and moses
[19:40] you can see christ amen and joseph i
[19:43] mean joseph was rejected by his brethren
[19:45] amen he was he was put into prison come
[19:47] out of the prison to the right hand of
[19:49] pharaoh amen signifying the path that
[19:51] jesus christ would take to the throne
[19:54] so these men had to tell the story in
[19:57] their lives amen so that that could be
[20:00] written in the bible so that when we
[20:02] come to the end of time a prophet of god
[20:04] could come back when the revelation of
[20:06] the mystery of god came in our day he
[20:08] could go back and say see it here see it
[20:10] here see it here see it here showing
[20:12] that this bible was written for our day
[20:17] that's why when you look in the bible
[20:18] you see christ everywhere and you see
[20:20] christ and a bride you see you see male
[20:23] and female you see christ
[20:25] and his bride you see the prophet of the
[20:28] age you see and all of these characters
[20:30] you see the end time scene being said
[20:33] and the end time events taking place
[20:37] it is amazing
[20:38] without this revelation you cannot know
[20:41] your bible
[20:43] now i don't say that
[20:45] in a way to offend because you can know
[20:48] greek and you can study the bible you
[20:50] can know the text and you can you can
[20:52] understand the dates and the history and
[20:53] the timelines and you can know the bible
[20:56] but i don't mean that kind of knowing
[20:58] the bible because there's a surface
[21:00] effect of the bible and understanding
[21:02] but there's a deeper understanding of
[21:04] the bible and that deeper understanding
[21:06] is the revelation of christ and you
[21:08] cannot know that without this message
[21:12] you can know the kings that came in
[21:14] order in solomon and when he built the
[21:16] temple and the date and timeline and
[21:18] when jesus was christ was born and what
[21:20] happened to him in his earthly mind you
[21:22] can know all of those things amen but
[21:24] all of those things were displaying a
[21:27] mystery a thought that god had in the
[21:28] back part of his mind from before the
[21:30] foundation of the world and it's that
[21:32] mystery that you cannot get without this
[21:34] message
[21:37] so when i say you cannot know your bible
[21:39] you cannot know the purpose of this
[21:41] bible being here in your day
[21:44] without knowing the message
[21:48] so we see that this stone
[21:51] in daniel 2
[21:52] that was cut out of the mountain without
[21:54] hands
[21:55] it smote the image in its feet
[21:59] because this image is a type of gentile
[22:02] power gentile world domination from the
[22:04] time of babylon and the head of gold
[22:06] down to the medes and persians the chest
[22:08] and arms of silver down into the greek
[22:10] empire amen with the loins of brass and
[22:13] it moves into the roman empire and the
[22:15] roman empire splits into two legs
[22:17] because we know that roman empire split
[22:20] into two eastern and western and then it
[22:22] begins the iron of that begins to mingle
[22:24] with clay amen begins to mingle into the
[22:27] humanity and into the nations because
[22:30] rome the the political power of rome was
[22:33] broken amen but the spiritual power of
[22:35] rome continues on to today so the
[22:38] political power moved to a spiritual
[22:40] power
[22:41] pagan rome became papal rome and still
[22:44] goes and that intermingled and moved all
[22:46] the way into the feet and out into the
[22:49] feet into the
[22:50] toes
[22:54] when the mountain was come out cut out
[22:55] of the mountain
[22:57] without hands it smote it in the feet
[23:01] because the day that the stone was cut
[23:03] out of the mountain
[23:04] the manifestation of all gentile power
[23:08] spiritual and political was in the feet
[23:12] so it smites it in the present day
[23:14] manifestation of that image
[23:17] which is in the feet
[23:19] showing you when the stone would be
[23:21] revealed the smiting stone would be when
[23:23] you get down to the feet
[23:27] praise god i'm not even planning on
[23:28] preaching this but
[23:30] but brother bannon let's just read i
[23:32] want to read a little bit here
[23:35] uh verse 35 again then was the iron the
[23:37] clay the brass the silver the gold
[23:39] broken to pieces it smites it in the
[23:41] feet but when it hits the feet it breaks
[23:44] the entire image
[23:46] it didn't have to go hit the head and
[23:47] hit the chest and hit it didn't have to
[23:50] all it did was have to hit the feet
[23:51] because all that was in the head moved
[23:53] down into the chest moved down moved
[23:55] down and now is manifest in the feet
[23:57] amen so all has to do is hit it in the
[23:59] present manifestation and it destroys
[24:01] the entire image
[24:04] amen
[24:05] and it be it broke the pieces together
[24:07] and became like the chaff of the summer
[24:09] threshing floor and the wind carried
[24:12] them away and no place was found for
[24:14] them and the stone that smote the image
[24:16] became a great mountain and filled the
[24:19] whole
[24:20] earth
[24:21] a great mountain that filled the entire
[24:24] earth amen this is not a natural
[24:26] mountain this is a kingdom rising up
[24:28] amen and it is a spiritual kingdom that
[24:31] will become a spiritual and natural
[24:33] kingdom in the millennium that will
[24:35] cover the entire world and it is the
[24:37] kingdom of christ
[24:40] so let's go on let's go on down
[24:43] it begins to
[24:45] speak of the different kings it begins
[24:47] to explain the head amen down to the
[24:50] arms and to the
[24:52] to the loins but let's go down to
[24:55] verse 40 when it speaks of the fourth
[24:57] kingdom which is the roman kingdom
[25:00] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[25:01] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[25:04] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[25:06] iron that breaketh all these
[25:09] these shall it break in pieces and
[25:12] bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet
[25:15] and toes part of potter's clay part of
[25:17] iron the kingdom shall be divided but
[25:19] there shall be in it of the strength of
[25:22] the iron for as much as thou souls the
[25:24] iron mixed with miry clay and as the
[25:26] toes of the feet were part of iron and
[25:29] part of clay
[25:30] so the kingdom shall be partly strong
[25:32] and partly broken
[25:34] and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with
[25:37] miry clay they shall mingle themselves
[25:39] with the seed of men but they shall not
[25:41] cleave one to another even as iron is is
[25:45] not mixed with clay
[25:49] in verse 24 and in the days of these
[25:51] kings
[25:54] i want you to take note of that
[25:56] in the days of these kings shall the god
[25:58] of heaven set up a kingdom
[26:01] which shall never be destroyed
[26:04] which shall never be destroyed and the
[26:06] kingdom shall not be left to another
[26:08] people but it shall break in pieces and
[26:11] consume all these kingdoms and it shall
[26:14] stand forever for as much as thou saw
[26:17] was that the stone was cut out of the
[26:18] mountain without hands and that at break
[26:21] in pieces the iron the brass the clay
[26:23] the silver and the gold the great god
[26:26] hath made known to the king what shall
[26:28] come to pass hereafter and the dream is
[26:31] certain in the interpretation thereof
[26:33] sure
[26:35] so when brother branham comes and he
[26:36] begins to explain this
[26:39] image that was in the dream
[26:42] he comes down to the feet and when he
[26:44] gets to the feet it's their special
[26:46] attention drawn to the toes
[26:50] in verse 42 and as the toes of the feet
[26:53] were part of iron and part of clay so
[26:55] the kingdom shall be so it's working its
[26:57] way all the way to the toes that's as
[26:59] far as you can go you go from the head
[27:02] all the way down you make the bend at
[27:04] the ankles and you shoot out and as far
[27:06] as you can go is the toes and it's
[27:08] bringing attention to the toes
[27:10] and whereas those saws the irons mixed
[27:12] with my reclay they shall mingle
[27:14] themselves with the seed of men and they
[27:16] shall not cleave one to another even as
[27:17] iron is not mixed with clay and the days
[27:20] of these kings shall the god of heaven
[27:21] set up a kingdom which shall never be
[27:23] destroyed so the days of these kings
[27:26] brother branham gives us the
[27:27] interpretation of this
[27:29] and he points to post-world war ii and
[27:33] in post world war ii when the eastern
[27:35] powers and the western powers come
[27:37] together they were going to come
[27:38] together amen to try to come up with
[27:41] some sort of peace accord and arms
[27:43] agreement and when they did amen there
[27:45] was five nations represented on the west
[27:48] amen with the united states and five
[27:50] nations represented with the eastern
[27:52] countries amen what became later the
[27:55] eastern bloc amen and those five and
[27:57] five were split east and west just like
[27:59] the old roman kingdom was split east and
[28:01] west
[28:02] and those those nations are represented
[28:04] in the toast five and five but brother
[28:06] branham said there was two great toes in
[28:08] that meeting two big toes amen and they
[28:11] they were russia and america represented
[28:14] by eisenhower the president of russia
[28:17] and our of america and and also uh uh
[28:20] the leader of russia was khrushchev and
[28:22] he said khrushchev and eisenhower means
[28:25] clay in iron
[28:28] eisenhower iron khrushchev clay and
[28:31] brother branham took this prophecy and
[28:34] brought it into his day and he said look
[28:37] he said look at those five and five east
[28:40] and west look at the two big toes and
[28:42] the prophecy says it tells us in the
[28:44] days of these kings
[28:48] in the days of these kings shall the god
[28:50] of heaven set up a kingdom what kingdom
[28:53] the kingdom of christ amen and he is
[28:56] here the smiting stone is cut out of the
[28:58] mountain the smiting stone has struck
[29:00] this image
[29:02] you say but russia still stands america
[29:04] still stands he'll take care of the
[29:06] natural amen but this is represented in
[29:08] spiritual and unnatural i mean because
[29:11] the power of rome amen moved down
[29:13] spiritually and mingled into every
[29:15] nation through the power of catholicism
[29:18] and mingled into every denomination amen
[29:21] it's been a hold it's got the it's got
[29:23] the iron still mixed in at the strength
[29:26] of the old roman system to hold and to
[29:29] bind and to overpower and to rule over
[29:32] and how is it ruling the spiritual world
[29:34] through the denominations
[29:38] and in the days of those kings amen
[29:40] there was a stone cut out of the
[29:42] mountain that struck that thing at the
[29:44] feet and broke that image for the
[29:46] children of god and scattered it like
[29:49] the chaff in the wind of the summer
[29:51] threshing floor and that thing has no
[29:54] more power on the children of god
[29:56] it has been destroyed by a prophetic
[29:59] message in the end time we're no longer
[30:01] held by denominational ideas we're no
[30:04] longer bound by wondering which one's
[30:06] right and which is correct is he three
[30:08] or is he one do you baptizing titles do
[30:10] you baptize in his name amen what does
[30:12] it mean to be born again we're not stuck
[30:15] in systems and
[30:16] bound and chained down and limited
[30:18] anymore because in the days of these
[30:21] kings there was a kingdom that is
[30:23] established upon this earth in the lives
[30:26] and hearts of the bride of jesus christ
[30:30] and it has broke the power of that
[30:32] system
[30:34] you say well the catholic church still
[30:35] stands
[30:37] my it doesn't stand for me it doesn't
[30:40] stand against me and it has no power to
[30:42] bind me
[30:46] remember the the dream brother branham
[30:48] has in the dream or the vision one i
[30:50] can't remember which it was but he sees
[30:52] people amen they're behind great big
[30:55] bars they're in prison amen and he sees
[30:57] brother borders and brother borders he
[30:59] said come out of there brother borders
[31:00] and brother borders is chained up his
[31:02] head's down and he says i just can't
[31:04] grasp it brother man i just can't grasp
[31:07] it
[31:08] and it was the message that he couldn't
[31:10] grasp
[31:12] he had denominational ideas and he
[31:14] looked at those people and people were
[31:16] moaning and butting their heads against
[31:18] the walls amen and he looked at those
[31:20] bars and he wanted the people to go free
[31:22] but he had no power to free them
[31:25] and there was a in the dream or the
[31:26] vision whichever one it was there was a
[31:28] woman standing next to him which was a
[31:30] neighbor of his and she said brother
[31:32] branham he says you misunderstood these
[31:35] people
[31:36] and they've misunderstood you
[31:39] these aren't bad people these are good
[31:41] people
[31:43] what kind of people were they they were
[31:44] church people stuck in denominations
[31:49] behind the bars just couldn't grasp it
[31:53] just couldn't see just couldn't break
[31:55] free of the denominational
[31:58] teaching and a voice come and said to
[32:01] him set him free
[32:04] and he said i looked at my little arms
[32:05] and i looked at those great big inch
[32:07] thick bars or however many inches he
[32:09] said he said i had no power to free him
[32:11] there's nothing i could do and and the
[32:14] voice came again says free these people
[32:17] and he says house of hell
[32:21] house of hell give way in the name of
[32:24] jesus christ and he said the rumbling
[32:26] and the shaking amen what was it a great
[32:29] earthquake that began to shake the earth
[32:31] amen and the
[32:32] walls came down the chains fell off and
[32:34] the people started going free
[32:37] amen that isn't a neat story that's a
[32:40] literal happening in our day friends
[32:44] amen the word of god came through the
[32:46] voice of that prophet messenger and he
[32:48] was screaming house of hell give way in
[32:50] the name of jesus christ
[32:53] the thing that has plagued god's people
[32:56] all down through time is
[32:57] misunderstanding god through
[32:59] misinterpretation of the word
[33:01] mislocation of the word amen misplacing
[33:04] the word of god has bound the people and
[33:07] kept them separated from the life of god
[33:09] but god in the end time he broke all of
[33:12] that amen there was a revelation a stone
[33:15] cut out of the mountain without hand
[33:16] that destroyed that image
[33:21] amen
[33:23] and i believe with all my heart there
[33:24] will be a physical destroying
[33:27] of the physical remnants of that kingdom
[33:30] and the physical kingdom of the lord
[33:32] jesus christ shall be a mountain that
[33:34] fills the whole earth
[33:35] i believe that with all my heart but i
[33:37] believe it's happening now i believe
[33:39] that kingdom is filling the earth now as
[33:42] the message goes to every corner to
[33:44] every nation to every tongue there is a
[33:47] mountain a kingdom that is being
[33:48] established upon the earth now
[33:53] and that kingdom
[33:54] will never
[33:56] be destroyed
[33:59] praise be to god
[34:01] i haven't got very far
[34:05] these things thrill my heart like
[34:07] nothing else in the world thrills me
[34:10] there's not a ball game an event an
[34:12] accomplishment there's not anything in
[34:14] this world that thrills me like seeing
[34:16] the word made manifest when god's
[34:18] promise comes into manifestation to free
[34:21] his people from the bondage that satan
[34:22] had him and they're now free to be
[34:24] everything that god called them to be
[34:26] that is the most exciting thing that
[34:27] i've ever experienced in my life and all
[34:29] i want is more of it i want more freedom
[34:31] amen i want to be more like christ i
[34:33] want more of the promises in my life i
[34:35] want more manifestations of christ
[34:37] taking place in this flesh
[34:40] i want more freedom
[34:42] but praise be to god so the smiling
[34:45] stone is the capping stone if we review
[34:48] just a couple scriptures here in
[34:50] ephesians chapter 2 verse 19 it says now
[34:53] therefore you are no more strangers and
[34:55] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[34:57] saints and of the household of god and
[34:59] are built upon the foundation
[35:01] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[35:04] christ himself being the chief
[35:06] cornerstone
[35:08] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[35:10] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[35:12] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[35:15] together for a habitation of god through
[35:18] the spirit
[35:20] so this this building is to be the
[35:23] temple of god
[35:25] it's on the foundation of the apostles
[35:27] and prophets jesus christ himself being
[35:29] the chief cornerstone
[35:31] but all that building is fitly framed
[35:34] together means it all must fit the
[35:36] foundation in the cornerstone
[35:39] it's not haphazardly slapped together
[35:42] but it must be fitly joined together
[35:45] means you have to fit to the apostles
[35:48] prophets in the in jesus christ being
[35:51] the chief cornerstone you have to fit
[35:53] the pattern you can't just say i'm i'm
[35:55] part of this building and a stone out of
[35:58] place
[36:00] it must all be fitly joined together it
[36:02] must match the pattern that was laid
[36:04] down
[36:05] and that pattern is is the word of god
[36:07] made manifest first peter chapter 2
[36:10] verse 6 wherefore also it is contained
[36:12] in the scripture behold i lay in zion a
[36:16] a chief cornerstone elect precious and
[36:19] he that believeth on him shall not be
[36:22] confounded
[36:23] amen so so the prophecy is saying he's
[36:26] laying in and zion a chief cornerstone
[36:29] or the or the uh uh the the cornerstone
[36:33] and he says he's elect he's precious
[36:35] and he
[36:36] and he that believeth on him shall not
[36:39] be confounded
[36:41] so if you believe on him you're not
[36:42] going to be confused you're not going to
[36:43] be confounded because you're founded on
[36:45] him because you believe in him
[36:48] until you therefore which believe he is
[36:51] precious
[36:52] is he precious to you
[36:55] to you that believe he is precious but
[36:57] unto them which be disobedient the stone
[37:00] which the builders disallowed the same
[37:02] as made the head of the corner this is
[37:05] an interesting scripture
[37:07] he says now
[37:08] to you
[37:10] that believe he's precious
[37:13] so if you believe he's precious
[37:16] but to those who are disobedient the
[37:18] stone was to which the builders
[37:20] disallowed the same has made the head of
[37:23] the corner
[37:24] so somehow
[37:26] if you believe he's precious but if you
[37:28] disbelieve that same stone that was
[37:30] rejected is going to be made the head of
[37:31] the corner
[37:32] the cornerstone will become the head of
[37:34] the corner and the way this scripture
[37:36] reads that's a bad thing for the
[37:38] disobedience
[37:41] he said do you believe he's precious but
[37:43] you don't believe that stone will become
[37:45] the head of the corner
[37:47] and that will be bad for you
[37:52] the the same the same has made the head
[37:54] of the corner and the stone of stumbling
[37:57] in a rock of offense even to them which
[38:00] stumble at the word being disobedient
[38:04] whereunto also they were appointed
[38:08] so this stumbling stone a rock of
[38:11] offense amen is only a stumbling stone
[38:14] on a rock of offense to those that are
[38:15] disobedient
[38:17] amen but to you who believe he's
[38:19] precious
[38:20] so do you believe he's precious he's
[38:22] never a stumbling stone he's not a rock
[38:24] of offense he's precious
[38:27] but to those who disobey he's a
[38:29] stumbling stone and a rock of offense
[38:32] and when he becomes the headstone
[38:34] there's something that's not good for
[38:35] the disobedient him becoming
[38:38] for him to become the head of the corner
[38:42] oh let's look at here luke chapter 20.
[38:46] verse 17
[38:47] and he beheld them and said what is this
[38:50] then that is written the stone which the
[38:52] builders rejected the same has become
[38:55] the head
[38:56] of the corner
[38:57] whosoever shall fall upon that stone
[38:59] shall be broken but on whomsoever it
[39:02] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[39:05] this grind them to powder is a reference
[39:07] all the way back to daniel chapter 2
[39:09] that we just read this same stone that
[39:11] was the the chief cornerstone is going
[39:14] to become the head of the corner amen
[39:16] and it's the same stone the same jesus
[39:18] christ the revelation of god amen the
[39:21] cornerstone will become the headstone
[39:23] and whoever falls upon this stone will
[39:26] be broken but on whomever this fault the
[39:28] stone falls amen he will be
[39:31] it will grind him to powder
[39:34] so the the option of staying whole when
[39:37] coming in contact with this stone is
[39:40] impossible
[39:42] let's just settle that right now the
[39:44] option of never changing the option of
[39:47] staying forever the way you are when you
[39:50] come in contact with the stone that is
[39:52] an impossibility because only one of two
[39:54] things are going to happen when you come
[39:56] up to this stone amen as a chief
[39:58] cornerstone if you fall down upon that
[40:00] stone you will be broken
[40:04] and after you are broken you can be
[40:07] fashioned amen into his image and you
[40:09] can be fitly placed into that building
[40:11] and be part of the habitation of god
[40:14] but if you do not fall upon that
[40:16] cornerstone and are broken when the
[40:18] headstone comes the headstone will fall
[40:20] upon you amen and it will grind you to
[40:23] powder that is different than broken
[40:26] broken can be mended ground to powder is
[40:28] destroyed
[40:30] so there's two options with this stone
[40:33] there's not a third option there's no
[40:35] other way around this there's no detour
[40:37] there's no divergent amen this steam
[40:39] stone which is the revelation of god the
[40:42] mystery of god revealed is jesus christ
[40:45] this stone which is the manifested word
[40:48] amen it will either break you so you can
[40:51] be conformed into his image or it will
[40:53] destroy you
[40:57] and i say god break me
[41:01] god let me fall upon this word and be
[41:03] broken amen and break me and make me in
[41:06] your very image amen
[41:10] amen i'm going to
[41:12] try to
[41:14] do something here on this
[41:16] thingy here
[41:18] amen if we look at the pyramid
[41:27] if we look at the pyramid
[41:29] the pyramid is uncapped unfinished
[41:32] and then the capstone
[41:34] is actually the completion of the
[41:36] pyramid
[41:38] so the pyramids never finished without
[41:40] the capstone amen
[41:42] but if you look
[41:44] the capstone
[41:46] is the image of the entire pyramid
[41:50] so when you see the capstone you know
[41:52] what the whole pyramid looks like amen
[41:54] so the whole pyramid amen the capstone
[41:57] is the image of the entire pyramid but
[41:59] the pyramid is never finished without
[42:00] the capstone so when the capstone comes
[42:03] down and place itself on the pyramid the
[42:05] pyramid now comes into the image of the
[42:07] capstone
[42:10] the pyramid is never fully in the image
[42:12] of the capstone until the capstone rests
[42:14] upon it when the capstone rests upon it
[42:16] now the now the pyramid is in the image
[42:19] of the capstone now they look the same
[42:22] this is what brother brahm taught us
[42:23] about the end of the church ages
[42:26] and so in the beginning there's a
[42:28] foundation laid here
[42:32] of the apostles and prophets
[42:34] jesus christ being the chief cornerstone
[42:38] so when you have the chief cornerstone
[42:41] when the cornerstone is laid the
[42:43] cornerstone
[42:45] sets the dimensions for the rest of this
[42:47] building
[42:48] the rest of this building builds off the
[42:50] cornerstone without the cornerstone you
[42:52] have no idea how to build the building
[42:54] amen because the cornerstone sets this
[42:56] angle
[42:59] all right
[43:00] it sets the angle on both sides amen so
[43:04] the the the dimensions in the
[43:06] cornerstone
[43:08] are setting the angle of the pyramid and
[43:11] the angle of the pyramid is always
[43:14] building up to the capstone
[43:18] so if you don't build on the cornerstone
[43:21] when it's time for the capstone the
[43:23] capstone will not fit to the building
[43:26] and so the building without the
[43:28] cornerstone can never be capped so it
[43:31] can never come into the image of the
[43:33] capstone and it can never fully reflect
[43:35] the cornerstone
[43:37] because the reflection of the
[43:38] cornerstone is laid in the angles of the
[43:41] cornerstone and as the cornerstone
[43:43] builds and completes it's made manifest
[43:45] by the capstone the capstone is the
[43:48] omega the cornerstone is the alpha so
[43:50] the alpha and omega is jesus christ the
[43:53] alpha laid down the pattern to bring you
[43:55] to the omega ministry so the alpha
[43:58] ministry without that image of god in
[44:01] flesh you would not know what it is like
[44:03] to see god in flesh
[44:07] that was the image of a son of god that
[44:09] was a perfect son of god this is what
[44:12] god's goal was this is his desire amen
[44:14] to be manifest in flesh so he comes into
[44:17] the flesh as a sign he becomes a man he
[44:20] becomes the son the manifested god in
[44:23] flesh which is the cornerstone to show
[44:26] you what it looks like to have god in
[44:28] flesh
[44:30] and without that image you have no idea
[44:33] what the target is
[44:37] that's why we have so many denominations
[44:39] and they've built so many structures i'm
[44:41] speaking spiritually and those
[44:43] structures have nothing listen until
[44:46] brother bantam come along and straighten
[44:47] it out for us amen we were all still
[44:49] thinking of a cube
[44:53] and it was the prophet of god amen it
[44:56] was the prophet of god who could catch
[44:58] the mind of god who could look at the
[45:00] cornerstone ministry and understand that
[45:03] this is not building a cube this is
[45:05] building a pyramid
[45:08] you think of that just in the natural
[45:09] he's able to look at the future home in
[45:11] the dimensions of the future home and by
[45:13] revelation he's going to be able to tell
[45:15] us the actual dimensions of the future
[45:17] home amen how can he do that by
[45:19] revelation but without that revelation
[45:22] you don't even properly understand the
[45:24] cornerstone because if you think the
[45:26] cornerstone was building to a cube shows
[45:28] you don't even have the right
[45:30] revelation of the cornerstone and when
[45:32] the capstone comes as a pyramid to sit
[45:34] on a cube it has no place to rest
[45:39] so denominations i i listen i'm just
[45:42] speaking in type i'm not don't try to
[45:44] make this a natural fade
[45:47] denominations are building cubes cubes
[45:49] cubes
[45:51] of all different shapes and sizes and
[45:53] the capstone can never rest upon a
[45:54] denomination
[45:59] it can only rest
[46:00] on the top of a pyramid
[46:02] that has got its dimensions off of
[46:05] christ the word
[46:06] and as that word is unfolded generation
[46:09] by generation it's coming more and more
[46:11] into the image
[46:14] and it's looking more and more like
[46:16] christ brother talked about the wheat
[46:17] plant it doesn't look like the wheat
[46:19] when it first comes up in luther and
[46:20] wesley but as it moves into pentecost it
[46:22] looks more like the original grain but
[46:24] it's still not the original yet so you
[46:26] come all the way up to the uncapped
[46:28] pyramid it looks like a pyramid
[46:31] it looks more like the cornerstone it
[46:33] looks more like the capsule but not yet
[46:35] quite it cannot resemble the cornerstone
[46:38] it cannot it cannot be the image of what
[46:40] the cornerstone was pointing to until
[46:42] the capstone comes and when the capstone
[46:44] comes it vindicates what the cornerstone
[46:46] was pointing to
[46:48] the alpha and the omega come together to
[46:50] make the hole
[46:53] so
[46:55] praise god amen
[46:58] this
[47:01] is the body
[47:04] the bride
[47:07] this is the headship
[47:09] the headstone
[47:11] says christ
[47:13] head
[47:18] bridegroom
[47:22] it's amazing that
[47:24] the bridegroom is perfect
[47:27] the bridegroom is perfect
[47:30] it's a perfect pyramid
[47:32] but the bride can never become perfect
[47:35] until the headship comes down and when
[47:38] the headship unites with the body then
[47:40] it becomes perfect in the image of the
[47:43] headstone
[47:45] and now the body
[47:47] and the head
[47:48] are the same
[47:52] brother banham taught us
[47:54] we find in the scriptures and everything
[47:56] he was pointing to always is pointing to
[47:58] the same thing
[47:59] the same mystery the same headship the
[48:02] same
[48:03] everything
[48:05] uh
[48:07] if i could say this
[48:10] this
[48:11] is christ the head this is the body
[48:14] this here
[48:16] what
[48:18] is the word
[48:21] this here
[48:22] is the word
[48:27] this here
[48:32] is the complete
[48:35] revelation
[48:40] of
[48:42] the whole
[48:44] thing
[48:46] that's a quote
[48:48] brother brown said christ's life in you
[48:50] makes you the complete revelation of the
[48:52] whole thing
[48:53] what life his capstone life coming to
[48:55] you
[48:56] makes you the complete revelation
[48:59] this is the message and this is what
[49:01] brother bran was trying to teach us
[49:03] and all the types and all the scriptures
[49:05] and everything that's what he was trying
[49:07] to get us to to understand
[49:11] amen
[49:13] let's let's go on here to this next
[49:15] quote
[49:18] in the message there's a man here that
[49:19] can turn on the light he says may there
[49:20] come forth this great issue of this rock
[49:23] that's cut out of the mountain without
[49:25] hands it'll crush these gentile kingdoms
[49:28] to the ground all these kingdoms
[49:30] spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms
[49:33] you catch that
[49:34] so brother branham is not looking for
[49:36] this rock that's cut on the mount with
[49:37] hands just to do the work of destroying
[49:40] russia america
[49:42] you name it but he's also destroying the
[49:45] spiritual kingdoms because these two
[49:47] have their two counterparts
[49:49] parts they're spiritual and natural to
[49:51] this thing
[49:52] so
[49:53] amen so that rock that's cut out of the
[49:55] mountain without hands it'll crush these
[49:56] gentile kingdoms to the ground all these
[49:58] kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural
[50:00] kingdoms and the rock will cover the
[50:02] whole earth
[50:03] it'll be a purified affair
[50:07] those who those who that rock crushes
[50:10] will be ground under powder those who
[50:12] fall upon that rock shall have a solid
[50:15] foundation
[50:17] amen
[50:19] this message did not come to destroy you
[50:23] but i say it this way this message came
[50:25] to break you
[50:28] but it is a voluntary breaking
[50:33] sometimes you see people they just don't
[50:34] progress in the message they don't
[50:36] progress in the word and you wonder
[50:38] sometimes why but but so many times we
[50:42] we want god to break us is that true we
[50:44] do i want god to break me all the time
[50:46] but the scripture says all who fall upon
[50:49] that stone
[50:51] there there's a sense of voluntary
[50:53] action and falling upon the stone amen i
[50:56] want to be broken i want to be changed i
[50:58] don't want to go on the way i am anymore
[51:00] i tell you there's a stone here amen
[51:02] there is a stone available and that is
[51:04] jesus christ himself that you by your
[51:07] own will you can throw yourself upon
[51:09] that stone and be broken and let him put
[51:12] you back together the way he wants you
[51:14] put back together but don't wait for the
[51:16] stone to fall on you because when the
[51:18] stone falls on you it's a grinding to
[51:21] powder
[51:22] it's a destruction we want god to do it
[51:24] god to do it god to do it and the truth
[51:26] is there's nothing we can do ourselves
[51:28] we can't fix ourselves we can't make
[51:30] ourselves better we can't make ourselves
[51:32] into the image of christ we absolutely
[51:35] need him to do that but there's one
[51:37] thing i can do and i can say that is
[51:39] nothing but the truth and i'm going to
[51:40] lay myself right here on this word and
[51:43] say god you've got to do the rest
[51:45] there's nothing else i can do but i
[51:47] willingly surrender to the truth of this
[51:49] word and i say this is the foundation
[51:51] stone this is where i want to be planted
[51:54] this is what i want to be built upon
[51:57] not anymore my idea or even my desires
[52:00] amen i don't even want my own desires
[52:04] amen we we have natural desires fleshly
[52:07] desires lust of the flesh and we want
[52:09] them gone but you can't even make them
[52:11] gone
[52:13] but you can get to the point where you
[52:15] don't even want them anymore
[52:17] they're still there your body wants it
[52:18] your body has cravings but you yourself
[52:20] don't even want it anymore
[52:23] that's when it's time to go fall upon
[52:25] the stone amen and be broken upon this
[52:28] revelation of this word be broken upon
[52:31] that word and say god you've got to fit
[52:33] me into your temple you've got a lot of
[52:35] shaving off to do but god you're the
[52:37] only one who can do it
[52:39] but if we keep walking around the stone
[52:42] analyzing judging and maybe right i'm
[52:45] not so sure i i i'm not i'm not a
[52:48] hundred percent confident
[52:55] there's coming a day when everybody will
[52:56] be 100 confident that that's the stone
[53:00] but for most it'll be too late
[53:03] but we've got a golden opportunity right
[53:05] now
[53:06] to fall upon the stone
[53:09] and say god establish me
[53:12] in your word
[53:13] and mold me into your likeness
[53:17] amen
[53:19] sometimes the fact that we can do
[53:20] nothing
[53:22] lends to inactivity it lends to the fact
[53:25] because we cannot make the change
[53:27] we don't do anything
[53:29] but that's not the gospel
[53:32] we cannot make the changes we cannot
[53:34] bring about change in our life we cannot
[53:36] restructure ourselves we cannot even get
[53:39] rid of our own wrong desires
[53:42] but one thing we can do is we can
[53:44] surrender to this word
[53:46] we can acknowledge it's right and
[53:47] surrender to it and claim it right and
[53:50] believe it and give ourselves holy to it
[53:52] with all that's in us we can do that
[53:57] and then he can do
[53:59] above and beyond
[54:01] more than we can ask
[54:02] or think
[54:04] so because we can't do it we don't do
[54:06] anything
[54:07] that's not right either
[54:10] we must surrender to the word
[54:13] amen so these natural
[54:15] and spiritual kingdoms are being
[54:17] destroyed by this rock
[54:19] let's go to zechariah chapter 4 and read
[54:21] together
[54:22] here in zechariah
[54:28] zechariah chapter 4 verse 1.
[54:40] and the angel that talked with me came
[54:42] again and waked me as a man that has
[54:45] awakened out of the sleep
[54:47] and said unto me what see us thou and i
[54:49] said i have looked and behold a
[54:52] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[54:54] the top of it and his seven lamps
[54:56] thereon and seven pipes to seven lamps
[54:58] which are upon the top thereof and two
[55:01] olive trees by and one upon the right
[55:03] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[55:04] left side thereof so i answered and
[55:07] spake to the angel that talked with me
[55:09] saying what are these my lord then the
[55:12] angel that talked with me answered and
[55:13] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[55:16] be and i said no my lord
[55:18] then he answered and spake unto me
[55:20] saying this is the word of god unto
[55:22] zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[55:25] power but by my spirit saith the lord of
[55:28] hosts
[55:29] who art thou o great mountain before
[55:31] zerubbabel thou shalt become acclaimed
[55:33] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[55:35] thereof with shouting's crying grace
[55:37] grace unto it
[55:39] remember zerubbabel is bringing the
[55:41] headstone with shoutings of grace grace
[55:44] unto it they're shouting to the
[55:46] headstone grace grace unto it
[55:50] amen so this is a headstone that brings
[55:53] grace
[55:57] verse 8 moreover the word of the lord
[55:58] came unto me
[56:00] saying the the hands of zerubbabel have
[56:03] laid the foundation of this house
[56:06] his hand shall also finish it
[56:09] and thou shalt know that the lord of
[56:11] hosts has sent me unto you
[56:15] for who hath despised the day of small
[56:17] things for they shall rejoice and see
[56:20] the plummet in the hand as aruba with
[56:22] those seven
[56:24] they are the eyes of the lord which run
[56:26] to and fro through the whole earth
[56:28] those are the seven spirits of god that
[56:30] were in the seven messengers of the
[56:32] church ages and they are with zerubbabel
[56:36] when zerubbabel lays the foundation
[56:39] and finishes
[56:42] this temple
[56:45] brother has some interesting things to
[56:46] say about this
[56:49] and
[56:49] the message of grace we are all
[56:52] acquainted with this scripture that
[56:53] reads the that reads the bible we know
[56:55] that this was during the time of
[56:57] preparation of the restoration of the
[56:59] temple
[57:00] and it's interesting to note what temple
[57:02] was being restored it was solomon's
[57:04] temple
[57:05] the temple that god had given
[57:07] instruction through david david had the
[57:10] instructions for the temple but he
[57:11] wasn't allowed to build it his son had
[57:13] to build it and so this temple that is
[57:15] being rebuilt is the temple that was
[57:17] destroyed in its solomon's temple so i
[57:20] want to take another look over here if
[57:22] we can
[57:25] i hit the button but did it work
[57:29] i'm trying to do this all by myself
[57:33] and brother shimbo shamed me by coming
[57:35] up here and using our technology better
[57:36] than i do
[57:38] and i preach here every week so i've
[57:40] been ashamed of myself since then
[57:43] but solomon
[57:48] built it
[57:49] built a temple
[57:52] we know that moses was given the
[57:53] instructions for the tabernacle and the
[57:55] tabernacle and the temple are spilt in
[57:57] two totally different constructions
[57:59] they're not they they're roughly the
[58:01] same in an outer court in a holy place
[58:04] and a holy of holies they have roughly
[58:05] the same kind of things but there's many
[58:08] many things about these two
[58:09] constructions that are very different in
[58:11] in moses temple there was one
[58:15] one altar one laver one lamp stand one
[58:18] table one altar of incense there was one
[58:21] one one one one and that that tabernacle
[58:24] was very much depicting christ jesus
[58:26] christ but solomon's temple is a
[58:29] mini-membered body
[58:31] solomon's temple is made out of hewn
[58:33] stone stones that are cut and shaped
[58:36] amen off-site and brought and fit
[58:38] perfectly in the place and these stones
[58:40] were not all the same shape they were
[58:42] multitudes of different shaped stones
[58:44] that were all placed together and they
[58:46] re they represent the bride the body of
[58:48] jesus christ the living stones built
[58:51] into a spiritual temple
[58:53] this is what the new testament is
[58:55] referring back to is this temple and you
[58:57] as lively stones that means living
[58:59] stones are built into a spiritual temple
[59:03] so solomon had this and we know that the
[59:05] number 10 in many ways is tied to the
[59:07] church we know there's there's ten
[59:08] virgins five wise five foolish we know
[59:11] that when eliezer went to fetch rebecca
[59:13] he took ten camels
[59:16] when he gave her uh two bracelets she
[59:18] was given two bracelets amen and they
[59:21] totaled ten shekels they were five and
[59:22] five
[59:24] so so we we see this number ten it's
[59:27] it's super interesting even in the day
[59:29] of pentecost after jesus christ ascended
[59:31] they had to wait 10 days
[59:33] so this 10 shows up all the time in the
[59:36] church i don't don't ask me any more
[59:38] questions now i don't fully understand
[59:39] it but 10 is an amazing number in the
[59:41] bible and it's many times separated five
[59:44] and five
[59:45] five wise five voltage even the ten
[59:47] commandments were written on how many
[59:48] tables of stone
[59:50] two so you can surmise how many on wound
[59:53] up on each table
[59:55] ten ten commandments which was the
[59:57] covenant that he made it was amen the
[59:58] ten commandments were a marriage
[1:00:00] covenant that he made to israel and that
[1:00:02] marriage covenant showed on two tables
[1:00:04] five and five
[1:00:05] so this theme runs through the entire
[1:00:07] bible
[1:00:08] so you have five wise and five foolish
[1:00:11] amen then in solomon's temple it's it's
[1:00:15] many stones all right so let me come
[1:00:17] down here
[1:00:20] many stones representing individuals
[1:00:25] there's ten laborers
[1:00:29] five on one side five on the other
[1:00:32] there's ten lamp stands
[1:00:38] five on one side five on the other
[1:00:42] there's 10 tables
[1:00:44] now i'm not going to go and explain all
[1:00:46] this because i don't know what it means
[1:00:48] i'm just pointing it out because it's
[1:00:49] super it's showing there's something
[1:00:51] unique about this temple that's
[1:00:52] different than the tabernacle and the
[1:00:54] number that's associated with the church
[1:00:56] keeps showing up in solomon's temple all
[1:00:58] the time and it's what's referred to by
[1:00:59] the new testament uh uh
[1:01:02] writers when they're referring back to
[1:01:03] living stones a habitation of god you as
[1:01:06] stones fit together it's referring to
[1:01:08] the temple but i want to look at who
[1:01:10] built it
[1:01:12] solomon needs means peace
[1:01:14] so
[1:01:15] the prince
[1:01:17] of peace
[1:01:19] built this
[1:01:21] built this
[1:01:22] temple he is also
[1:01:26] the son of david
[1:01:28] the son
[1:01:30] of david
[1:01:32] and he's also
[1:01:34] son of god
[1:01:38] so was there anybody else that was the
[1:01:39] prince of peace the son of david and the
[1:01:41] son of god that built a temple
[1:01:46] solomon is a type of jesus christ and
[1:01:48] jesus christ built a spiritual temple
[1:01:50] and you and i are stones in that
[1:01:52] spiritual temple
[1:01:54] so now in zechariah
[1:01:57] we know solomon's temple amen was
[1:02:00] destroyed by babylon babylon came in and
[1:02:03] babylon is a type of the false church
[1:02:05] it's a type of the catholic system which
[1:02:07] becomes the mother of the great
[1:02:08] the mother of harlots and it and it
[1:02:10] types the denominational systems so
[1:02:13] solomon's temple amen that was
[1:02:15] instructed constructed by solomon who's
[1:02:17] a type of jesus christ all of this great
[1:02:19] imagery
[1:02:20] that temple was destroyed by babylon
[1:02:23] does this sound familiar
[1:02:25] because god's great temple that that he
[1:02:28] filled jesus christ filled on the day of
[1:02:29] pentecost amen there were many stones
[1:02:32] amen and he filled that temple he filled
[1:02:34] that temple on the day of pentecost amen
[1:02:36] but it fell into ruin because babylon
[1:02:38] destroyed it
[1:02:41] but now zechariah is speaking of a group
[1:02:44] that's coming out of babylon going back
[1:02:46] to jerusalem and now zerubbabel is the
[1:02:49] governor the great prince that is now in
[1:02:52] charge of rebuilding this temple again
[1:02:55] not a new temple solomon's temple
[1:02:57] rebuilt
[1:03:00] that's important to note that it's it's
[1:03:02] not a new temple it's new in the fact
[1:03:04] that the first was destroyed but it's
[1:03:06] built in the same place it's a
[1:03:07] rebuilding of the temple
[1:03:10] so let's get back to what brother
[1:03:11] branham was saying here
[1:03:14] we're all acquainted with the scriptures
[1:03:15] that reads the bible you know that this
[1:03:16] is during the time of the preparation of
[1:03:18] the restoration of the temple so not a
[1:03:20] new temple a restoration of solomon's
[1:03:22] temple
[1:03:25] and zerubbabel was a great prince among
[1:03:27] the people who had laid the foundation
[1:03:29] of the building now you i want you to
[1:03:31] put on your spiritual thinking anointed
[1:03:34] anointing jacket this morning as we
[1:03:36] think so brother benham told us amen
[1:03:39] don't take this for face value he's
[1:03:41] saying i want you
[1:03:43] to put on your spiritual thinking
[1:03:46] anointing jacket this morning
[1:03:49] all right
[1:03:51] let's go on
[1:03:53] because we've got to think spiritually
[1:03:55] now
[1:03:57] this morning as we think and this great
[1:03:59] prince had determined to rebuild the
[1:04:01] house of the lord and then when he did
[1:04:04] he had laid the foundation stone and as
[1:04:06] we read on farther we find out that god
[1:04:09] said
[1:04:10] zerubbabel has laid the foundation with
[1:04:12] his hands he also shall bring forth the
[1:04:14] headstone
[1:04:16] i want you to notice he never said he
[1:04:18] shall bring forth the cornerstone he
[1:04:20] shall bring forth the headstone and we
[1:04:23] know the scripture says that jesus is
[1:04:25] the chief cornerstone and he's also the
[1:04:27] headstone
[1:04:29] now if we will think for a few minutes
[1:04:31] the seventh church messenger was to
[1:04:34] restore the faith of the children back
[1:04:36] to the fathers in other words rebuild
[1:04:39] the church again under the power of the
[1:04:41] spirit
[1:04:43] so who is the rubable typing amen he's
[1:04:46] typing the seventh angel the seventh
[1:04:47] church aged messenger coming out of
[1:04:50] babylon who will rebuild the original
[1:04:52] temple again amen it's a restoration
[1:04:55] amen it's the restoration of all things
[1:05:00] not by power
[1:05:02] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[1:05:04] lord not by organization
[1:05:08] not by denomination but by the holy
[1:05:10] spirit god will bring forth the church
[1:05:12] in the last days
[1:05:13] so you see why brother ben said put on
[1:05:15] your spiritual anointing jacket
[1:05:18] because the whole bible was written for
[1:05:20] our day
[1:05:22] zerubbabel the prince with joshua was
[1:05:24] the one that was to bring forth this
[1:05:26] headstone
[1:05:28] he had laid the foundation he took the
[1:05:30] people back to the foundation in type
[1:05:34] so it says zerubbabel the prince with
[1:05:37] joshua
[1:05:38] joshua has the same meaning as jesus
[1:05:40] joshua of the old testament it means
[1:05:42] jesus and the new even
[1:05:45] even in the new testament when they're
[1:05:46] referring to joshua's ministry they call
[1:05:48] him jesus because those two names have
[1:05:50] the same meaning so zerubbabel the
[1:05:53] prince with joshua he's not doing it
[1:05:56] himself he's doing it with joshua which
[1:05:58] was the high priest and i asked you
[1:06:00] brother branham wasn't doing this
[1:06:02] himself he was the prince that god was
[1:06:03] using the seventh angel but there was
[1:06:05] one that was with him and that was the
[1:06:07] high priest joshua jesus was with
[1:06:10] zerubbabel in our day
[1:06:12] they were working together to rebuild
[1:06:15] the temple
[1:06:17] praise be to god
[1:06:19] this bible after the opening of the
[1:06:21] seventh seal this bible has become a new
[1:06:22] book
[1:06:25] the word was written for our day
[1:06:30] now
[1:06:31] i want to take a look at solomon's
[1:06:33] temple if you go with me back to second
[1:06:35] chronicles i want to look at a few
[1:06:36] scriptures here and then we'll move on
[1:06:40] second chronicles chapter 5.
[1:06:44] i referred to this wednesday and
[1:06:46] something brother stephen schimbot said
[1:06:48] to me and i went back and i and i found
[1:06:50] it
[1:06:53] second corinthians chapter 5
[1:06:56] and verse 11.
[1:06:59] second chronicles
[1:07:01] take me for what i mean not for what i
[1:07:02] say
[1:07:05] second chronicles chapter 5 verse 11
[1:07:08] this is solomon in the building of the
[1:07:09] temple and you've got it built now come
[1:07:12] the day of dedication when they bring
[1:07:14] the ark in
[1:07:16] second chronicles 5 and 11. and when
[1:07:18] they bring the ark in it's a type of the
[1:07:20] word coming into its place and when the
[1:07:22] word comes into its place always
[1:07:24] something wonderful happens
[1:07:27] uh second corinthians 5 11 and it came
[1:07:29] to pass when the priests were coming out
[1:07:31] of the holy place because they just put
[1:07:33] the ark down for all the priests that
[1:07:35] were present were sanctified and did not
[1:07:37] then wait by course
[1:07:39] also the levites which were the singers
[1:07:41] all of them asap of
[1:07:43] hermann
[1:07:44] judith and with with
[1:07:46] with their sons and their brethren being
[1:07:47] arrayed in white linen having symbols
[1:07:49] and sultries and harps stood at the east
[1:07:51] end of the altar and with them 120
[1:07:54] priests sounding with the trumpet so the
[1:07:57] only number that's given here there's
[1:07:58] other people doing other things the only
[1:08:00] number that's given they don't number
[1:08:02] the priest they don't number the singers
[1:08:04] the only number they give is the number
[1:08:06] of those who are sounding the trumpet
[1:08:08] and the ones who are sounding the
[1:08:09] trumpet are 120.
[1:08:11] this is what uh um
[1:08:13] brother shimbo mentioned to me the
[1:08:14] number 120 and i went back and i found
[1:08:16] it here i thought it was interesting
[1:08:18] it's not the total number of priests but
[1:08:20] it's the number of those that are
[1:08:21] sounding the trumpet
[1:08:23] trumpeting priests
[1:08:26] and so
[1:08:27] then 120 priests sounded with trumpets
[1:08:30] it came even to pass as the trumpeters
[1:08:32] and singers were as one to make one
[1:08:35] sound to be heard in praising and
[1:08:37] thanking the lord i want you to catch
[1:08:39] these words amen when they were as one
[1:08:41] to make one sound to be heard and
[1:08:43] praising and thanking the lord and then
[1:08:45] they lifted up their voice with the
[1:08:47] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[1:08:48] music and praised the lord saying for he
[1:08:51] is good and his mercy endureth forever
[1:08:53] that then the house was filled with the
[1:08:55] cloud even the house of the lord so that
[1:08:58] the priest could not stand to minister
[1:09:00] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[1:09:02] the lord had filled the house of god
[1:09:06] this is a this is a foreshadow of the
[1:09:09] day of pentecost
[1:09:12] amen i think it's interesting the way
[1:09:13] it's written let's go to the book of
[1:09:15] acts now let's turn to acts chapter 1.
[1:09:23] all of this matters and it all means
[1:09:25] something
[1:09:29] acts chapter 1
[1:09:31] verse 13.
[1:09:33] this is the inauguration
[1:09:35] or i would say the anointing
[1:09:39] of the new
[1:09:41] temple
[1:09:44] the the temple that is going to be now
[1:09:47] in the believers where god the shekinah
[1:09:49] glory of god is going to live within
[1:09:51] these veiled walls in within these
[1:09:54] living stones
[1:09:56] and this is the inauguration this is
[1:09:58] going to be the the anointing day amen
[1:10:01] is very much like solomon after he put
[1:10:03] the word into place amen the things that
[1:10:06] happened there but let's look here verse
[1:10:08] 13 and when they were come in they went
[1:10:10] up into an upper room and their abode
[1:10:12] both peter and james and john and andrew
[1:10:14] philip and thomas bartholomew and
[1:10:15] matthew james the son of alphaeus and
[1:10:18] simon zealots and judas the brother of
[1:10:20] james these all continue with one
[1:10:22] according prayer and supplication with
[1:10:24] the women and mary and the mother of
[1:10:26] jesus with his and with his brethren and
[1:10:29] in those days peter stood up in the
[1:10:30] midst of the disciples and said the
[1:10:32] number of names together were about 120.
[1:10:36] now it's interesting it says about 120
[1:10:39] it doesn't mean that it was necessarily
[1:10:40] 120 it could have been 121 it could have
[1:10:42] been 119 but there was an important
[1:10:44] number
[1:10:45] so it didn't worry i didn't worry about
[1:10:48] whether it was 119 121 122. that number
[1:10:52] had to be laid in there there were 120
[1:10:54] because we've got 120 new trumpeters who
[1:10:57] are going to trumpet a new message
[1:11:01] amen this number 120 is interesting
[1:11:04] because when god was going to destroy
[1:11:05] the world in the flood he comes down and
[1:11:07] gives man 120 days to complete before
[1:11:09] destruction comes
[1:11:11] said my spirit shall not always strive
[1:11:13] for man for his thoughts are wicked and
[1:11:15] it'll be 120 days and so noah preached
[1:11:17] 120 days and at the end of 120 days they
[1:11:20] went into the ark of safety and
[1:11:21] destruction came
[1:11:22] also moses was 120 years old when he
[1:11:25] died
[1:11:27] so he died moses who was the lawgiver
[1:11:30] who brought him to the border to the
[1:11:32] border line but could not take them
[1:11:34] across he came because the law could
[1:11:36] never take you all the way in so he came
[1:11:39] he was born of the liver from the time
[1:11:41] the deliverer was born until he died was
[1:11:44] 120 years and after 120 years then they
[1:11:48] could move into the promised land
[1:11:50] so this number 120 is super interesting
[1:11:53] because it's passing from the law into
[1:11:55] the promises moses dies they cross
[1:11:58] jordan in the 120th year from the birth
[1:12:00] of the deliverer
[1:12:02] all of this symbology is so important
[1:12:04] the bible doesn't throw out numbers and
[1:12:06] throw out things just to throw them out
[1:12:07] and we may not fully be able to
[1:12:09] comprehend the full depth and meaning of
[1:12:11] that but we can start to see there's
[1:12:12] something there amen there's something
[1:12:15] that he's doing he wants us to see 120.
[1:12:17] he's taking us right back to the only
[1:12:19] number of priests that were given there
[1:12:21] was priests doing this and priests doing
[1:12:23] that but none of them were numbered only
[1:12:25] 120 trumpeting priests
[1:12:27] and now we come to the day of dedication
[1:12:30] the anointing is going to fall to anoint
[1:12:33] a new temple and that new temple is
[1:12:36] going to be the believers on the day of
[1:12:37] pentecost and when it falls there's
[1:12:39] about 120.
[1:12:43] they're moving from law to grace
[1:12:47] moving from the law of moses into what
[1:12:49] moses was pointing to the grace of god
[1:12:51] beginning to move into the promised land
[1:12:54] it's always taking place then
[1:12:58] brother branham says in the message
[1:13:00] dedication of a building to the lord
[1:13:02] he's preaching a dedication of a church
[1:13:05] he said when israel had finally made one
[1:13:07] place that they could all dwell in come
[1:13:09] to a place and meet god under the
[1:13:11] fellowship of the blood
[1:13:13] then they begin to sing with joy he's
[1:13:15] referring back to solomon's temple
[1:13:17] they began to play the harp they praised
[1:13:19] god with such
[1:13:20] one accord until it sounded like one
[1:13:23] voice of singing
[1:13:25] he's referring right back to the
[1:13:26] scriptures we just read in second
[1:13:27] chronicles
[1:13:29] then solomon stood to pray and to make
[1:13:31] the dedication to the lord and when he
[1:13:33] did that remember the ark had already
[1:13:36] been brought in under the wings of the
[1:13:37] cherubim and set back in the holy place
[1:13:39] but when the people dedicated not the
[1:13:42] church
[1:13:43] not the building but when the people got
[1:13:45] with one accord
[1:13:48] and prayed
[1:13:49] with one accord and sang with one accord
[1:13:52] and everything is of one accord then the
[1:13:54] holy spirit in the form of pillar of
[1:13:55] fire moved into the building and settled
[1:13:58] upon the place and there was so much
[1:14:00] glory in that building until the priest
[1:14:01] could not minister anymore
[1:14:05] let's look at acts chapter 2
[1:14:08] verse 1.
[1:14:10] now how many days
[1:14:12] were they waiting from the time jesus
[1:14:14] ascended until this day
[1:14:16] 10 days because there's a number
[1:14:17] associated with the church
[1:14:19] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:14:21] come they were all with one accord in
[1:14:23] one place and suddenly there came a
[1:14:25] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[1:14:27] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:14:29] they were sitting this is this is going
[1:14:32] right back to the dedication of
[1:14:33] solomon's temple when the anointing came
[1:14:35] to end
[1:14:36] it says they were all with one accord
[1:14:39] exactly like they were playing all with
[1:14:42] one voice
[1:14:44] in the day of solomon's dedication
[1:14:46] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:14:48] heaven as a rushing mighty went and it
[1:14:49] filled all the house where they were
[1:14:51] they were sitting and there appeared
[1:14:52] unto them cloven tongues like as a fire
[1:14:55] and it sat upon each of them and they
[1:14:56] were all filled with the holy ghost and
[1:14:58] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:15:00] spirit gave them utterance
[1:15:02] praise god what did they do they went
[1:15:05] bursting amen brother bannon said out of
[1:15:07] the upper room into the street amen and
[1:15:09] could not even speak their language
[1:15:11] anymore amen they were so under the
[1:15:13] anointing they couldn't minister in the
[1:15:15] usual way now they were trumpeting in a
[1:15:17] new way
[1:15:20] so this shows that there was an
[1:15:22] anointing that came for the new
[1:15:25] temple
[1:15:26] are you with me
[1:15:28] the newt the what solomon was pointing
[1:15:30] to solomon even says in ii chronicles if
[1:15:32] you go back and read it when solomon's
[1:15:34] dedication prayer he speaks to god and
[1:15:36] he says god i have built this as a
[1:15:38] habitation for you to dwell in for ever
[1:15:42] forever but that temple was destroyed
[1:15:44] then when it was rebuilt then that was
[1:15:46] destroyed and herod's temple was built
[1:15:47] over it then that was destroyed and then
[1:15:49] the next temple that they built for the
[1:15:51] millennium will be ezekiel's temple and
[1:15:53] it doesn't exactly match the dimensions
[1:15:55] of solomon's temple but solomon said
[1:15:56] i've built this for you forever so is he
[1:15:59] talking about that structure or is he
[1:16:01] talking about the one it's pointing to
[1:16:06] the structure was to be a forever
[1:16:09] habitation of god almighty a dwelling
[1:16:11] place a house for god to dwell in
[1:16:13] forever it wasn't those stones it was
[1:16:16] these stones
[1:16:18] it was the stones that were anointed
[1:16:20] amen as the habitation the dwelling
[1:16:22] place of the shekinah glory of god on
[1:16:24] the day of pentecost that temple was
[1:16:26] anointed on that day
[1:16:30] praise
[1:16:32] god brother baby says
[1:16:35] in the six-fold purpose of gabriel's
[1:16:37] visit
[1:16:38] to daniel he said now when zerubbabel
[1:16:40] dedicated his temple after it was
[1:16:41] rebuilt it was not anointed again
[1:16:46] catch this
[1:16:48] it was not anointed again because it was
[1:16:50] already been anointed and been tore down
[1:16:53] or it was just instructed again and
[1:16:55] destruction had come to it and had been
[1:16:57] instructed again and put up so there was
[1:17:00] no anointing of it anymore when it was
[1:17:02] one time anointed that carried on
[1:17:04] through and it goes on to this very time
[1:17:08] when zerubbabel finished that temple he
[1:17:10] didn't have to anoint it again it was
[1:17:12] already anointed but when the temple was
[1:17:14] finished the presence of god came back
[1:17:17] because he had already anointed that to
[1:17:18] be the temple amen in our day when
[1:17:20] zerubbabel had finished and put the
[1:17:22] capstone on amen the presence of god
[1:17:25] came back into his temple because he
[1:17:27] already anointed that in these people
[1:17:29] that believe my word shall be the temple
[1:17:32] my dwelling place the house of the
[1:17:34] shekinah glory of god
[1:17:36] didn't need a new anointing amen just
[1:17:38] needed to rebuild what had been tore
[1:17:40] down by babylonian religion and when it
[1:17:42] come back into place and the capstone
[1:17:45] came on and the word was restored and
[1:17:47] the ark was back in its place then the
[1:17:49] presence of god came back and filled the
[1:17:51] temple again
[1:17:53] but if it was showing it didn't need
[1:17:54] another anointing amen they'll come
[1:17:56] another anointing
[1:17:58] because moses
[1:18:00] when moses tabernacle was completed the
[1:18:02] pillar of fire came and it was anointed
[1:18:05] when solomon's temple was erected amen
[1:18:08] and completed amen the pillar of fire
[1:18:10] came down and filled the house with a
[1:18:13] cloud of smoke amen and anointed it and
[1:18:16] it carried all the way through the next
[1:18:17] anointing will be in the millennium
[1:18:19] under the millennial temple when christ
[1:18:21] and his bride return together and jesus
[1:18:23] christ goes to the holy of holies and
[1:18:25] anoints the most holy place
[1:18:28] showing that the tabernacle was anointed
[1:18:31] the temple was anointed then the the
[1:18:34] place for the bride and the bridegroom
[1:18:36] will be anointed and then we know that
[1:18:38] jesus christ was anointed on the river
[1:18:41] we know that the bride anointing came on
[1:18:43] the day of pentecost but in the
[1:18:44] millennial reign there's another one
[1:18:46] coming when they return together
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:50] so when was this temple
[1:18:51] when was this temple anointed on the day
[1:18:53] of pentecost
[1:18:56] and it continued all the way through
[1:18:58] although the spirit would become bound
[1:19:00] by my denominational rivers it would be
[1:19:02] limited by false teaching it was still
[1:19:04] the same spirit that was moving the true
[1:19:06] bride through in every age it was still
[1:19:08] the same anointing that was giving
[1:19:10] revelation to the church age messengers
[1:19:12] and carrying it out amen through the
[1:19:14] true ministries in that day and the true
[1:19:15] believer it was still the same anointing
[1:19:17] that fell at pentecost that was moving
[1:19:19] the church all the way through the
[1:19:20] church ages
[1:19:22] but it had to come back to a full
[1:19:24] measure again
[1:19:25] in the end time
[1:19:28] praise god
[1:19:30] now
[1:19:34] i want to look at another picture here
[1:19:35] because we know that brother branham
[1:19:37] says when you put your when you put your
[1:19:39] spiritual anointing jacket on
[1:19:43] he wants to show you that the seventh
[1:19:44] angel was working in the ministry of
[1:19:46] zerubbabel to rebuild that temple that
[1:19:50] had been destroyed by babylon
[1:19:52] and what temple was destroyed by babylon
[1:19:54] the one that was anointed on the day of
[1:19:55] pentecost
[1:19:57] babylonian religious systems had
[1:19:59] destroyed that original temple amen and
[1:20:02] had fallen to ruin but there was coming
[1:20:04] a time when that temple was going to be
[1:20:06] rebuilt again under the ministry of
[1:20:08] zerubbabel with joshua the high priest
[1:20:11] and zerubbabel will lay the foundation
[1:20:14] of it and he would bring the headstone
[1:20:17] but i just want to show you this picture
[1:20:22] this is brother branham laying the
[1:20:23] cornerstone
[1:20:25] to branham tabernacle
[1:20:28] i think it's a blessing that we have
[1:20:29] this picture
[1:20:32] because i want to i want to show you a
[1:20:33] pattern brother branham does things in
[1:20:35] the life of a prophet the life of that
[1:20:37] prophet becomes a ver it begins to speak
[1:20:40] the very word he begins to flesh out the
[1:20:42] very word for his day and the very
[1:20:44] actions of the word begin to manifest in
[1:20:46] his life and here we have brother barry
[1:20:48] talks about this so many times laying
[1:20:51] the cornerstone when i laid the
[1:20:52] cornerstone he even put a prophecy of a
[1:20:54] vision he had in that cornerstone when
[1:20:56] he laid the cornerstone
[1:20:58] we're going to talk about that but i'm
[1:21:00] so thankful we have a picture of this
[1:21:02] because we know the ministry of
[1:21:03] zerubbabel must lay the foundation stone
[1:21:05] and bring the headstone
[1:21:08] and here comes a picture of the prophet
[1:21:09] of god
[1:21:10] laying a cornerstone
[1:21:12] i say thank you god this is symbolic
[1:21:17] and we know that this is just an earthly
[1:21:19] building that tabernacle is not
[1:21:21] but it means something spiritually
[1:21:25] he says now
[1:21:27] i want to read some scriptures before we
[1:21:29] have a dedication of prayer what message
[1:21:31] is this
[1:21:33] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:21:34] revealing himself in the same this is
[1:21:36] the beginning of the seals brother
[1:21:37] branham now has gone out west he got
[1:21:40] caught up in a constellation of seven
[1:21:42] angels and that clown and we told him to
[1:21:44] come back east for the opening of the
[1:21:46] seven seals now he comes back this is
[1:21:48] the set of meetings when there's going
[1:21:49] to be the opening of the seven seals
[1:21:50] he's already been caught up into the
[1:21:52] headship he's already been caught up
[1:21:54] into the constellation of angels into
[1:21:56] the capstone
[1:21:58] now he's coming back amen what's he
[1:22:00] doing he's going to be bringing the
[1:22:01] headstone in through the opening of the
[1:22:02] seals
[1:22:05] but what happens to the branham
[1:22:06] tabernacle just before the seals are
[1:22:08] preached amen there's a reconstruction
[1:22:11] project that takes place
[1:22:14] they they expand it amen they expand the
[1:22:17] tabernacle even so much they couldn't
[1:22:19] use it amen and sometimes for some
[1:22:20] meetings so there's a reconstruction
[1:22:23] expanding amen a remodeling you could
[1:22:26] say a reconstruction of the branham
[1:22:28] tabernacle and now when the when the
[1:22:31] restructuring rebuilding the
[1:22:33] remodeling is completed now he comes to
[1:22:36] this service amen which is the first
[1:22:38] service in the week that he's preaching
[1:22:40] the seals after he's got caught into the
[1:22:42] constellation of angels out in arizona
[1:22:44] and come back to preach the opening of
[1:22:46] the seals and he says now i want to read
[1:22:48] some scriptures before we have the
[1:22:49] dedication prayer and then it's just a
[1:22:52] rededication
[1:22:55] because the real dedication happened 30
[1:22:58] years ago
[1:23:00] there's a pattern being laid out by the
[1:23:02] very life of the prophet showing that
[1:23:04] we're coming to the rededication the
[1:23:07] headstone is coming but this temple
[1:23:09] that's been destroyed it was already
[1:23:11] dedicated it was already anointed on the
[1:23:13] day of pentecost
[1:23:17] further on he says now i think it's our
[1:23:19] duty
[1:23:20] to make the inside right by the grace of
[1:23:22] god to be so grateful to god that
[1:23:25] that this will not just be a beautiful
[1:23:27] building
[1:23:28] that will come to you but may everyone
[1:23:30] who comes in see the beautiful
[1:23:32] characteristics of jesus christ and
[1:23:34] every person that comes in
[1:23:36] may it be a consecrated place for our
[1:23:38] lord a consecrated people for no matter
[1:23:41] how beautiful the structure is that we
[1:23:43] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[1:23:45] the church is the character of the
[1:23:47] people i trust it will always be a house
[1:23:50] of god of beauty
[1:23:52] now he's not talking about the physical
[1:23:54] now he's talking about the spiritual
[1:23:56] church
[1:23:58] now in the dedication service of the
[1:24:00] original cornerstone being laid a great
[1:24:03] vision came and it's wrote in the
[1:24:05] cornerstone the morning i dedicated it
[1:24:08] so brother man was talking about the
[1:24:09] laying of the cornerstone as the the
[1:24:12] original dedication and there was a
[1:24:14] prophecy that was laid
[1:24:17] in that cornerstone
[1:24:19] and he said you might have wondered a
[1:24:21] few minutes ago he's the same quote why
[1:24:23] i was so long coming out
[1:24:26] my first duty as i come into the new
[1:24:28] church
[1:24:29] i married a young man and woman standing
[1:24:32] listen friends nobody can put this stuff
[1:24:35] together nobody can make this up amen my
[1:24:38] first duty is coming into the new church
[1:24:41] it wasn't a new church it was a
[1:24:42] reconstructed church that had already
[1:24:44] been dedicated 30 years ago when they
[1:24:47] laid the foundation stone and without a
[1:24:49] prophecy in the foundation
[1:24:53] and now he comes into the new church for
[1:24:55] they're having a rededication because it
[1:24:56] was already dedicated
[1:24:58] amen and the completion of the church
[1:25:01] and he said my first duty in the new
[1:25:03] church is i married a young man and
[1:25:05] woman standing in the office may it be a
[1:25:07] type that i'll be a loyal minister to
[1:25:09] christ to get a bride ready for the
[1:25:11] ceremonies of that day
[1:25:14] every step this man took was anointed
[1:25:16] was directed of god amen it was laying
[1:25:19] down a picture to us so we'd see the
[1:25:21] scriptures we'd see his life we would
[1:25:22] see the supernatural we'd see it all and
[1:25:25] god made this so obvious that you have
[1:25:27] to intentionally be blind to miss it
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:31] that you say oh well that was
[1:25:32] circumstances yeah that about 10 000
[1:25:35] others odd circumstances
[1:25:37] [Applause]
[1:25:38] you can look at somebody's life and they
[1:25:40] can try to make something spiritual in
[1:25:41] their life i've heard people do it over
[1:25:42] and over and over again and you can say
[1:25:44] i could have or couldn't have been and
[1:25:46] maybe it was and maybe somebody over
[1:25:47] spiritualized something but when it
[1:25:49] happens tens of thousands of times
[1:25:51] eventually you throw your hands in the
[1:25:53] air and say that man's life is under an
[1:25:55] anointing
[1:25:57] and god is directing his very footsteps
[1:25:59] the words are coming out of his mouth
[1:26:01] the sermons that he's preaching the
[1:26:02] order of events in his life is all
[1:26:04] taking place for a reason so that we
[1:26:06] would have no excuse that god would so
[1:26:09] reveal himself to his bride that we
[1:26:11] would see it in the manifestation of the
[1:26:12] supernatural we would see it in the very
[1:26:14] construction of the life of the prophet
[1:26:16] we would see it in the manifestation of
[1:26:18] the word amen that there's that god is
[1:26:21] vindicating vindicating vindicating
[1:26:23] vindicating
[1:26:28] oh praise of god
[1:26:32] he says
[1:26:34] and now let us do as we did at the
[1:26:36] beginning
[1:26:39] maybe at the day of pentecost
[1:26:41] now let us do as we did at the beginning
[1:26:44] we started at the first dedication of
[1:26:46] church i was just a young man maybe 21
[1:26:48] 22 years old when we laid the
[1:26:49] cornerstone it was before i was even
[1:26:51] married and i was always wanted to see a
[1:26:53] place correctly in order for god to
[1:26:56] worship with his people
[1:26:58] and we can only do that not by a pretty
[1:27:01] building but by a consecrated life is
[1:27:03] the only way we can do it
[1:27:08] this is something that brother branham
[1:27:10] preached
[1:27:12] in the end the very end of 1962 after
[1:27:15] the visions came those six dreams and
[1:27:17] then the vision amen that he was going
[1:27:19] to go out west and god had showed him
[1:27:21] amen those constellations uh he saw the
[1:27:23] consolation little birds the
[1:27:25] constellation of bigger birds and then
[1:27:26] the angels come in his room a week
[1:27:28] before this about eight days before this
[1:27:30] happened and he comes to the church to
[1:27:32] explain it and tell him why he's going
[1:27:33] out west because the six dreams capped
[1:27:35] by the vision is all sending him out
[1:27:37] west
[1:27:38] and he goes if this year doesn't settle
[1:27:40] he said i'm going out west i'm going to
[1:27:41] try there if i don't go there i'm going
[1:27:43] to go here i'm going to go there he
[1:27:45] wants god he knows god's calling him out
[1:27:47] west he knows there's a revelation
[1:27:48] coming but he doesn't know how so if
[1:27:51] this year doesn't settle it the next
[1:27:52] year without water or food i'll walk out
[1:27:54] into the desert and i'll wait till he
[1:27:56] calls me i can't go on like this you've
[1:27:58] got to get desperate you've got to get
[1:28:00] to a place where you want to know what's
[1:28:02] the will of god and how can you do the
[1:28:04] will you you don't know the will
[1:28:07] i'm pragging because of that vision
[1:28:08] background what you did see going around
[1:28:11] as a missionary in evangelism until that
[1:28:13] call come
[1:28:14] remember the first one when we laid the
[1:28:16] cornerstone now he's pointing back to
[1:28:18] the cornerstone
[1:28:19] do the work of an evangelist
[1:28:22] he said didn't say you was an evangelist
[1:28:25] but do the work of one perhaps until the
[1:28:28] time come for something else another
[1:28:30] change of work might be something
[1:28:32] different i don't know
[1:28:35] the prophecy in the cornerstone was do
[1:28:37] the work of an evangelist and brother
[1:28:39] bannon says not that i was an evangelist
[1:28:42] but do the work of the vengeance maybe
[1:28:44] until something other come
[1:28:47] so there's a prophecy in the cornerstone
[1:28:50] that is pointing to the coming of the
[1:28:52] headstone
[1:28:54] you catch that
[1:28:56] even physically in branham tabernacle
[1:28:58] there's a prophecy laying in the
[1:28:59] cornerstone
[1:29:01] that is pointing to the coming of the
[1:29:02] headstone
[1:29:06] here he says in 1963 questions and
[1:29:08] answers on the seals he's preaching this
[1:29:10] saturday morning
[1:29:12] or sunday morning on the week that he
[1:29:13] preaches the seals
[1:29:15] he says now if you watch when i laid the
[1:29:18] cornerstone under the tabernacle he said
[1:29:19] do the work of an evangelist and now the
[1:29:21] hour's coming when the work is separated
[1:29:24] there's something else taking place
[1:29:27] now
[1:29:28] i did the work of an evangelist pointing
[1:29:30] to this time but when we come to this
[1:29:32] time something else is taking place what
[1:29:35] is it it's the work of a prophet now
[1:29:37] not the work of an event it's the work
[1:29:39] of a prophet so let's go to first kings
[1:29:41] chapter 18 and look at this
[1:29:45] first kings chapter 18.
[1:29:56] first kings chapter 18 and i'm going to
[1:29:59] begin at verse 30.
[1:30:02] and this is elijah in the showdown of
[1:30:04] mount carmel
[1:30:06] and elijah said unto all the people come
[1:30:08] near unto me and all the people came
[1:30:10] near unto him and he repaired the altar
[1:30:12] of the lord that was broken down
[1:30:14] so the first thing elijah did in the
[1:30:16] mount carmel showdown is he went back
[1:30:18] and repaired the altar of the lord that
[1:30:20] had been broken down
[1:30:21] because he's got to build back
[1:30:24] the worship he's got to bring back the
[1:30:26] church
[1:30:28] because the elijah in this day has to do
[1:30:29] the same thing first he's got to rebuild
[1:30:32] the altar rebuild the proper way of
[1:30:34] worship
[1:30:37] and so
[1:30:39] verse 31 and elijah took 12 stones
[1:30:41] according to the number of the tribes of
[1:30:43] the son of jacob whom the word of the
[1:30:45] lord came saying israel shall be thy
[1:30:47] name so elijah in this day is is
[1:30:50] preaching to the israelites and the
[1:30:51] israelites are known by the number 12 12
[1:30:54] is their completion it's all of their
[1:30:55] tribes it's the entire nation so he
[1:30:58] takes 12 stones and brings the altar
[1:31:00] back together amen but the elijah in our
[1:31:02] day doesn't take 12 stones he takes
[1:31:04] seven
[1:31:06] because he's preaching to a gentile
[1:31:07] church and the number of completion for
[1:31:09] the gentile church is seven seven ages
[1:31:12] so he rebuilds he goes back and rebuilds
[1:31:14] the altar of seven church ages
[1:31:18] amen praise be to god
[1:31:21] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:31:22] the name of the lord and he made a
[1:31:24] trench about the altar as great as would
[1:31:26] contain two measures of seed and he put
[1:31:28] the wood in order and cut the bullock in
[1:31:30] pieces and laid him on the wood and said
[1:31:32] fill full four barrels with water and
[1:31:35] pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on
[1:31:37] the wood
[1:31:38] and he said do it the second time and
[1:31:40] they did it the second time and he said
[1:31:41] do it the third time and they did it the
[1:31:43] third time and the water ran round about
[1:31:45] the altar and he filled the trench also
[1:31:47] with water and it came to pass at the
[1:31:50] time of the offering of the evening
[1:31:52] sacrifice
[1:31:53] so in the evening time
[1:31:57] because now brother branham says we're
[1:31:59] moving from doing the work of evangelist
[1:32:00] to something else now we know it's the
[1:32:02] prophetic ministry
[1:32:04] it's the elijah ministry
[1:32:07] he said in the evening sacrament is the
[1:32:08] evening time that elijah the prophet
[1:32:10] came near and said lord god of abraham
[1:32:12] isaac and of israel let it be known this
[1:32:14] day that thou art god in israel and that
[1:32:16] i am thy servant and that i have done
[1:32:18] all these things at thy
[1:32:21] word
[1:32:22] elijah didn't do anything on his own
[1:32:25] what he did was according to the word of
[1:32:27] the lord
[1:32:29] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:32:32] may know that thou art the lord god and
[1:32:35] thou has turned their heart
[1:32:37] back
[1:32:39] what was the ministry of elijah to do to
[1:32:41] turn the hearts of the fathers back to
[1:32:43] the children or by the heart to the
[1:32:45] children back to the fathers and he said
[1:32:47] lord let it be known that thou has
[1:32:49] turned their heart oh i love the
[1:32:51] language of the bible amen i love when
[1:32:53] the seals come off of the book and it
[1:32:55] becomes a new book and you can see
[1:32:57] exactly what brother branham did in this
[1:32:59] day is exactly what was done before
[1:33:01] elijah had to do this in this day so
[1:33:03] that we would come to our day and
[1:33:05] recognize the prophet and what he's
[1:33:06] doing in our day for this bible was
[1:33:09] written for our day
[1:33:13] god has laid this ministry and god has
[1:33:15] laid amen this end time all through the
[1:33:18] scriptures
[1:33:20] friends amen
[1:33:23] he turned their heart back again
[1:33:26] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:33:28] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:33:30] wood and the stones and the dust
[1:33:34] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:33:36] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:33:38] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:33:40] the lord he is the god the lord he is
[1:33:43] the god
[1:33:45] and elijah said unto them take the
[1:33:47] prophets of baal
[1:33:49] let not one of them escape and they took
[1:33:51] the took them and elijah brought them
[1:33:53] down to the brook kishon and slew them
[1:33:56] there
[1:33:58] so what happened in elijah's ministry
[1:34:00] elijah rebuilt the old altar the old
[1:34:03] worship amen he brought him back to the
[1:34:05] original when he brought him back to the
[1:34:07] original now it's time he
[1:34:10] you could say this way he laid the
[1:34:12] foundation and called for the fire to
[1:34:14] come
[1:34:15] because he rebuilt the he rebuilt the
[1:34:17] altar but under his ministry it wasn't
[1:34:20] just the rebuilding the altar it was
[1:34:21] also the coming of the fire that would
[1:34:23] consume it all so in his ministry he
[1:34:25] rebuilt and the fire fell
[1:34:28] because in brother branham's ministry he
[1:34:30] rebuilt and the fire of the holy ghost
[1:34:32] fell
[1:34:34] so now
[1:34:35] and then he says let it be known that
[1:34:37] you did this that you're going to turn
[1:34:38] their hearts back again
[1:34:41] and the fire fell
[1:34:43] and it was the destruction of the
[1:34:46] prophets of baal it came elijah's
[1:34:48] ministry also under his ministry was the
[1:34:51] destruction of the prophets of baal
[1:34:53] because under this capstone ministry
[1:34:55] it's the destruction of the religious
[1:34:56] systems of the day
[1:34:58] he says let not one of them escape
[1:35:02] and under this capstone ministry there
[1:35:04] is not one denomination that can escape
[1:35:08] you can say well the mennonites are
[1:35:09] pretty good and well that one's not too
[1:35:10] bad i'm telling you under this elijah
[1:35:13] ministry there is not one denomination
[1:35:15] that will escape
[1:35:17] they have all taken the thoughts of man
[1:35:18] they have all compromised on the word
[1:35:20] every man that comes up with anything
[1:35:22] has amen the nature of man comes into
[1:35:25] anything that man makes
[1:35:28] amen and it will not take the whole word
[1:35:30] so god has had to destroy all systems of
[1:35:33] man and bring back his word and this
[1:35:35] word is the vessel of destruction that
[1:35:38] is destroyed and smitten all the
[1:35:40] kingdoms of the religious kingdoms of
[1:35:42] this world amen and rose into a mighty
[1:35:44] mountain that is now filling the earth
[1:35:48] it is the ministry of christ the
[1:35:49] capstone
[1:35:52] praise be the god
[1:35:54] so that's why brother banham i love that
[1:35:56] picture of him laying the cornerstone
[1:35:59] because of that quote about zerubbabel
[1:36:02] but i also love this picture
[1:36:05] the coming of the headstone
[1:36:07] the capping of the pyramid
[1:36:10] the capstone the headship coming down to
[1:36:13] the body because the ruble bull has laid
[1:36:15] the foundation he's rebuilt he built
[1:36:18] back the church and we know that the
[1:36:20] church had been built over seven church
[1:36:21] ages we understand that but there was
[1:36:23] all kinds of things mixed in with it and
[1:36:25] you couldn't see it clearly but under
[1:36:28] this ministry he came back and he showed
[1:36:30] it he took everything else out of the
[1:36:31] way and showed you the proper order of
[1:36:33] the seven church ages and the truth
[1:36:35] through each one and the movement of god
[1:36:37] through each one and he built it back so
[1:36:39] that you could see it
[1:36:42] but he wasn't just going to build it
[1:36:43] back under his ministry there was going
[1:36:45] to be a capping of it
[1:36:47] and the capstone came
[1:36:50] the man says like the pyramid come up
[1:36:52] through luther wesley pentecost
[1:36:54] and then the capping
[1:36:56] of the stone
[1:36:59] he says and that's exactly
[1:37:02] when the church in the word has to be
[1:37:03] one like jesus and god was one just
[1:37:05] exactly
[1:37:07] god has god was in christ reconciling
[1:37:09] the world to himself and so will christ
[1:37:11] have to be in the church the anointing
[1:37:14] of the word to make everything
[1:37:16] fulfilled
[1:37:18] and that's the capstone
[1:37:20] what is it christ in his church that's
[1:37:22] the capstone
[1:37:24] that comes upon the last church age
[1:37:28] i want you to catch what he said
[1:37:32] god was in christ reconciling the world
[1:37:35] to himself and so will christ have to be
[1:37:37] in the church the anointed of the word
[1:37:40] to make everything fulfilled
[1:37:43] and that's the capstone
[1:37:46] christ in the church is the capstone
[1:37:50] and that's the capstone that comes upon
[1:37:52] the last church age not the laodicea now
[1:37:56] it's a calling out of that a bride out
[1:37:58] of a church a church out of a church and
[1:38:01] otherwise just like he called a nation
[1:38:04] out of a nation
[1:38:05] in egypt
[1:38:09] we see this picture
[1:38:12] brother branham
[1:38:14] goes to this quote i'll go to this quote
[1:38:16] next but i like the black and white
[1:38:17] picture it may be hard to see on the
[1:38:18] screen i don't know how easy it is but
[1:38:20] when you when you get this picture at
[1:38:22] home you can begin to see in the shadows
[1:38:24] you can see jesus's forehead
[1:38:27] you can see the two eyes the nose and
[1:38:29] brother brown keeps referencing his
[1:38:30] black beard you see his black beard
[1:38:34] and and this is what he says about this
[1:38:36] picture he says well
[1:38:37] if you'll turn the picture like this
[1:38:40] and look you can probably see it from
[1:38:41] the audience he had this this voice come
[1:38:44] to him one day and he's looking at this
[1:38:46] picture of this cloud you know
[1:38:48] somebody's giving him the picture and
[1:38:49] the picture says turn it right or the
[1:38:51] voice says turn it right he said i'm
[1:38:53] looking at it right
[1:38:54] like this is the way it was taken
[1:38:56] he said
[1:38:57] he said i thought maybe he meant to the
[1:38:59] right so he turned it to the right and
[1:39:00] there it was he said i could see the
[1:39:02] face of christ in the cloud
[1:39:03] looked like hoffman's head of christ
[1:39:06] and now he's telling the audience if
[1:39:07] you'll turn the picture like this
[1:39:09] and look you can probably see it from
[1:39:11] the audience it's christ see his eyes
[1:39:13] looking here just as perfect as it could
[1:39:15] be wearing the white wig of supreme
[1:39:17] deity and judge of all heavens and earth
[1:39:22] why because that smiting stone is the
[1:39:25] judgment stone
[1:39:27] it is the stone that passes judgment on
[1:39:30] the kingdoms of this world
[1:39:32] both spiritual
[1:39:33] and physical
[1:39:35] and first it destroys the spiritual
[1:39:38] and it will destroy the physical
[1:39:43] the judge of all the earth can you see
[1:39:45] his eyes his nose his mouth
[1:39:48] the congregation says amen just turn the
[1:39:50] picture this the way that
[1:39:52] they had it this away the way it's
[1:39:54] supposed to be
[1:39:56] praise god can you see it
[1:39:59] he's
[1:40:00] he is supreme judge there is none other
[1:40:03] but him and that is a perfect
[1:40:06] identification again a vindication that
[1:40:08] this message is the truth
[1:40:12] this is the truth it is true i make him
[1:40:16] making him not a third person but the
[1:40:19] only person
[1:40:21] madam said that capping stone that come
[1:40:24] down that was the completion that was
[1:40:25] the headship that was the word that was
[1:40:27] the fullness coming down to unite with
[1:40:29] the body with the church amen and those
[1:40:31] two together make it the capsule in the
[1:40:33] capstone ministry and brother banham
[1:40:35] took that picture one day and was told
[1:40:37] directed by the spirit to turn it to the
[1:40:39] right and there he saw the very face of
[1:40:41] christ wigged in the white wings of
[1:40:44] those angels showing that he was the
[1:40:46] supreme judge that he was coming down
[1:40:48] now as a judge
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:53] is he coming now as a judge
[1:40:56] and you say oh that's a bad thing no
[1:40:57] that's a good thing
[1:41:01] because
[1:41:03] i'll come back to this
[1:41:04] picture here
[1:41:12] this stone
[1:41:14] here
[1:41:17] is the judging stone
[1:41:23] because when that stone comes
[1:41:25] if it doesn't fit on the top of that
[1:41:28] pyramid
[1:41:29] then you did not build according to the
[1:41:31] foundation in the chief cornerstone
[1:41:34] you've got the word off somewhere
[1:41:38] and that stone won't fit
[1:41:40] so when that stone comes
[1:41:42] it is the judging stone
[1:41:45] and wherever the word is not constructed
[1:41:48] right it'll destroy it
[1:41:50] it'll tear out false concepts false
[1:41:53] notions false doctrines it'll grind them
[1:41:56] to powder
[1:42:00] but where it does find a fit
[1:42:03] it judges the fit
[1:42:07] see so many times we say we don't we
[1:42:09] don't want the judgment of god but you
[1:42:11] know what if god is judging me righteous
[1:42:13] i want the judgment of god
[1:42:17] because you have to in order to be found
[1:42:20] guilty or innocent in order to be found
[1:42:24] righteous or unrighteous you have to
[1:42:26] have somebody who will judge
[1:42:29] somebody has got to judge whether you're
[1:42:31] righteous or unrighteous whether you're
[1:42:33] a son of god or not a son of god
[1:42:35] somebody has to pass the judgment and
[1:42:37] who's going to pass the judgment jesus
[1:42:38] christ himself amen the headstone has
[1:42:41] come down in judgment amen whoever fell
[1:42:44] upon this cornerstone will be built into
[1:42:46] the image of christ and he can cap off
[1:42:48] their life amen but whoever this stone
[1:42:50] when it becomes the head of the corner
[1:42:52] falls upon it'll grind them to powder
[1:42:56] and the headstone
[1:42:58] is the judging stone is the proving
[1:43:00] stone proving that when brother branham
[1:43:03] rebuilt this church amen when he rebuilt
[1:43:06] this order when he put the seven stones
[1:43:08] of the seven church ages back together
[1:43:10] and said this was the first church
[1:43:11] eighth messenger this was the second
[1:43:13] this was the third this is how long they
[1:43:14] lasted this is what they taught this is
[1:43:16] what the true teaching was here's all
[1:43:18] the loose ends if they would have got
[1:43:19] here if they would have kept preaching
[1:43:20] they would have been here here's the
[1:43:22] complete picture amen what is the
[1:43:24] vindication that that prophet was right
[1:43:26] amen it is that cloud in the sky coming
[1:43:29] down is the vindication that that
[1:43:31] prophet was right
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:34] and you wonder why somebody wants amen
[1:43:37] to discredit that clown of course they
[1:43:39] want to discredit that cloud amen but
[1:43:41] that clown brother bam said is the
[1:43:43] vindication that this message is the
[1:43:45] truth
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:51] brother banham says
[1:43:56] he says
[1:43:58] there is none other but him and that is
[1:44:00] perfect i'm going in the yellow
[1:44:01] highlighted that is a perfect
[1:44:03] identification again a vindication that
[1:44:07] this message is the truth
[1:44:10] how do you know because the judge came
[1:44:14] and when the judge came he vindicated
[1:44:16] that prophet's message
[1:44:19] and the judge himself has put his seal
[1:44:22] of approval on the message of brother
[1:44:24] branham
[1:44:26] and how dare anybody take away from that
[1:44:29] message
[1:44:32] how dare anybody diminish what he taught
[1:44:35] or take away from what he taught god
[1:44:37] himself came down and vindicated it
[1:44:40] with the capstone
[1:44:43] he says can you see
[1:44:44] his head his eyes his nose his mouth
[1:44:50] you know you can take this picture and
[1:44:52] if you get it you know in the right
[1:44:53] shade and print it on good paper you can
[1:44:55] really see it even more distinctly and
[1:44:57] you can show it to somebody and you can
[1:44:59] get them to see yeah i see that there's
[1:45:01] eyes there's a black beard i see that
[1:45:04] but they could see that and still not
[1:45:05] see it
[1:45:08] because you've got to see who has come
[1:45:10] the judge the white wig one has come and
[1:45:13] when he come he judged this message to
[1:45:16] be the truth
[1:45:19] and when he judged this message to be
[1:45:20] the truth he judged all other to be
[1:45:24] wrong
[1:45:27] we do not preach a message that
[1:45:29] everybody's okay and everybody this and
[1:45:31] that no we preached a message that this
[1:45:34] is the ark of safety this is the
[1:45:36] vindicated word this is the place that
[1:45:38] he's come and sealed and vindicated that
[1:45:41] this is the truth and when that judge
[1:45:42] come down and said this is right he said
[1:45:44] all other denominational systems is
[1:45:47] wrong
[1:45:51] come to the truth
[1:45:54] come to the capping stone
[1:45:57] brother madam said and the other day
[1:45:59] standing there turned the picture to the
[1:46:01] right and there is jesus as he was in
[1:46:03] the seven church ages the white wig on
[1:46:06] showing supreme deity he's alpha omega
[1:46:08] he's the first the last he is the
[1:46:11] supreme judge of all eternity standing
[1:46:14] there confirm the message of the hour
[1:46:17] and there shall be light about the
[1:46:19] evening time
[1:46:21] brother branham was not afraid that the
[1:46:23] judge had come
[1:46:28] and he was happy that the judge had come
[1:46:31] and i said god make me happy that the
[1:46:33] judge has come amen i don't want to
[1:46:35] fight against that i don't want to push
[1:46:36] against that i don't want to fear the
[1:46:38] judge i say i'm falling on the judgment
[1:46:41] stone amen i'm falling on the
[1:46:42] cornerstone break out of me everything
[1:46:45] that won't pass the judgment form into
[1:46:47] your image so that you can cap me
[1:46:50] and judge me your child judge me
[1:46:52] righteousness by the faith that you've
[1:46:54] given me
[1:46:57] amen not righteous by deeds will never
[1:46:59] make righteousness by deed
[1:47:03] you probably can't get through a day
[1:47:04] doing it right
[1:47:06] not enough that god would judge you
[1:47:07] righteous for your deeds
[1:47:10] but he doesn't judge you righteous for
[1:47:11] your deeds he judges righteously for
[1:47:13] your faith and your faith dictates your
[1:47:15] deeds
[1:47:20] brother man goes on to say oh brother
[1:47:22] listen what time are we living in what's
[1:47:24] the age what's the hour that we're in
[1:47:26] it's not time for these things that are
[1:47:29] it's it's not time for these things that
[1:47:30] we're talking about that's past
[1:47:32] judgment is on hand now
[1:47:35] you can see it breaking you remember the
[1:47:37] rock up of the mountain that's when he
[1:47:39] threw the rock in the air started to
[1:47:40] roar and went on struck alaska and there
[1:47:42] was a giant earthquake that hit that's
[1:47:44] what he's referring to he says judgment
[1:47:46] hour hey friends judgments upon the
[1:47:49] earth judgment has come judgment has
[1:47:51] stricken the stone that was cut out of
[1:47:53] the mount without hands has come and has
[1:47:55] smote the image in his feet in the days
[1:47:57] of these kings
[1:47:59] it has happened amen it is history it's
[1:48:02] happened it's happening to individuals
[1:48:05] right now
[1:48:06] [Applause]
[1:48:08] the judge the supreme judge of all
[1:48:10] heaven and earth is here amen the judge
[1:48:12] of all eternity is here the supreme
[1:48:15] deity of jesus christ is here and he's
[1:48:18] come as a judge and brother branham was
[1:48:20] not afraid of that judge
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:23] because that judge was standing to
[1:48:25] vindicate his message
[1:48:28] i said god mold me in your word
[1:48:31] that i'm not afraid of the judge
[1:48:36] how can you not be afraid of the judge
[1:48:37] brother chad this is the judge of all
[1:48:39] heavens and earth
[1:48:41] listen it's not because i can look at
[1:48:43] myself and say i've got it right i'll
[1:48:45] stand before that judge because if i
[1:48:47] look in the mirror
[1:48:48] the natural mirror look at the natural
[1:48:50] man i'll always be afraid to stand
[1:48:52] before that judge
[1:48:55] but i'm not looking at the natural
[1:48:56] mirror i'm looking at the mirror of the
[1:48:58] word and what he said what he said about
[1:49:00] me and what he said in this day and the
[1:49:02] faith that he's given me to believe it
[1:49:04] amen and i know it's the truth and i
[1:49:06] know it applies to me as unworthy as i
[1:49:08] am and undeserving as i am and incapable
[1:49:11] i am of living it right every day it
[1:49:13] doesn't matter something in me still
[1:49:15] says it's the truth i know it's the
[1:49:16] truth i believe it to be the truth and i
[1:49:19] believe i'm part of it on my worst day
[1:49:21] i'm still part of it
[1:49:23] i shouldn't be amen but i am amen it
[1:49:25] doesn't make sense to the carnal mind
[1:49:27] but i'm not thinking with the carnal
[1:49:29] mind something in me says oh god i've
[1:49:31] fallen on the rock of this word and i
[1:49:33] believe every bit of it to be true
[1:49:36] even the parts i failed on i still
[1:49:37] believe it's true
[1:49:40] mold me in your image take away my fear
[1:49:42] of the judge because all the judge has
[1:49:44] come to do is to cap off my faith amen
[1:49:47] and to show that i am a son of god
[1:49:50] capping it off by this great revelation
[1:49:52] that's come at the end time
[1:49:54] that christ has come
[1:49:56] to unite with a bride
[1:49:58] the shekinah glory of god is back
[1:50:02] in the restored temple
[1:50:04] again
[1:50:11] amen the judgment is on on hand now you
[1:50:14] can see it breaking you remember the
[1:50:15] rock up on the mountain judgment hour
[1:50:18] you remember the revelation or the
[1:50:19] vision of the bride just keep her in
[1:50:21] step don't let her get out of step
[1:50:26] that word has come through a prophet and
[1:50:28] the prophet in the in the vision was
[1:50:30] yelling get back in line get back in
[1:50:33] line what is it it's the voice of the
[1:50:35] messenger constantly trying to keep us
[1:50:37] in step with the word amen we're
[1:50:39] constantly coming to that prophet and
[1:50:41] how many of you can say he's constantly
[1:50:43] yelling in my ear get back in line
[1:50:46] every day i hear a message i hear i mean
[1:50:49] i listen to the tape i read a book i
[1:50:50] come to service i can hear that voice
[1:50:53] screaming get back in line get back in
[1:50:55] line why the judge is here you're
[1:50:58] passing the review stand he's looking
[1:50:59] for a bride and the prophet of the hour
[1:51:02] and the prophet of god brought the word
[1:51:03] of the hour that will keep us in line so
[1:51:06] that we can pass the review stand
[1:51:11] not by our merits not by our deeds but
[1:51:14] our faith in this word and our obedience
[1:51:15] to this word gives us the right to stay
[1:51:18] in line by the voice of that messenger
[1:51:21] keeping us in line so that we can pass
[1:51:23] that review stand
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:28] what do you do without this word you
[1:51:30] have no place to go
[1:51:33] how do you stand the judgment of this
[1:51:34] hour without this message there's no
[1:51:36] place to go
[1:51:38] we've got to fall upon this stone
[1:51:41] or this stone will fall upon us
[1:51:46] brother the bible says now the word the
[1:51:48] word of god will judge every person
[1:51:51] this word that's been preached here this
[1:51:53] morning
[1:51:54] it's being preached down here at wall
[1:51:55] street preached over here
[1:51:57] at the christian church down
[1:51:59] excuse me down at the presbyterian
[1:52:01] church wherever the word is being
[1:52:03] preached it becomes the judgment
[1:52:06] so when you preach the full word the
[1:52:08] full judgment is present
[1:52:11] men are judged by the word of god
[1:52:13] and here's one good thing to know that
[1:52:16] either our judgment goes before us or it
[1:52:18] will follow after us
[1:52:20] but you won't escape it i say god let me
[1:52:23] fall on the stone so that my judgment
[1:52:25] goes before me
[1:52:27] but not coming after when the stone
[1:52:29] falls on me
[1:52:32] and the message the contest brother
[1:52:34] bannon is preaching this is the last
[1:52:36] message he preaches in 1962 and we know
[1:52:39] when he comes into 1963 he's coming into
[1:52:41] the seals
[1:52:42] he preaches the evening after he
[1:52:43] preached serves as this the time in the
[1:52:45] morning so this is his new year's eve
[1:52:47] message and he comes to the contest and
[1:52:49] he says make us fit servants forgive our
[1:52:52] past bless our future guide us o lord
[1:52:55] god with thy mighty hand jehovah bless
[1:52:57] these ministers here bless all the laity
[1:53:01] all the visitors be thou with us lord we
[1:53:04] are your servants and we give ourselves
[1:53:06] holy to you for 1963
[1:53:08] that the power of your spirit might have
[1:53:11] more preeminences in our life and in our
[1:53:13] being help us
[1:53:16] forgive help us god forgive us and help
[1:53:18] us we pray raise up mighty men raise up
[1:53:21] mighty warriors of the faith open this
[1:53:23] year lord that hidden manna that rock
[1:53:26] beneath the rock
[1:53:28] amen was 1963 going to be the year that
[1:53:31] he opened the rock beneath the rock yes
[1:53:33] because in sydney jackson's dream there
[1:53:35] was a rock and on the outside of the
[1:53:37] rock there was an interpretation of the
[1:53:38] word that he was going but he grabbed
[1:53:40] something out of the air a sharp object
[1:53:42] and tore the top off of that mountain
[1:53:45] and there was a white rock underneath
[1:53:46] that never light shined on before
[1:53:49] unwritten word the revelation of the
[1:53:51] seven thunders which was the seals
[1:53:54] and here brother bran was preaching the
[1:53:55] last message in 1962 and he's saying
[1:53:58] lord
[1:54:00] open this year lord
[1:54:01] that hidden manna did god answer his
[1:54:03] prayer
[1:54:04] yes
[1:54:06] that rock beneath the rock that we might
[1:54:09] see
[1:54:10] the program of god
[1:54:12] what was the revelation of the seven
[1:54:14] thunders for so that we could see the
[1:54:16] program of god
[1:54:18] so that we wouldn't be blind so that we
[1:54:19] wouldn't misunderstand so that we can
[1:54:21] see what god's been trying to do along
[1:54:23] the program of god amen that he had a
[1:54:25] program in his mind before the
[1:54:26] foundation of the world but that we
[1:54:28] might see the rock under the rock so
[1:54:30] that we might catch the program of god
[1:54:32] and see our place fit into the program
[1:54:34] so that we might have faith and we might
[1:54:36] be able to stand in the day of judgment
[1:54:39] and how will you be able to stand in the
[1:54:41] day of judgment knowing that as he is i
[1:54:43] am in this world
[1:54:45] this is how love is perfected
[1:54:48] he says that we might see the program of
[1:54:50] god cap off
[1:54:53] the pyramids of our life
[1:54:55] put the capstone jesus christ upon each
[1:54:58] and every one of us
[1:55:00] may his great magnificent holy blessing
[1:55:04] be upon us all may the fire of the holy
[1:55:06] ghost come upon us may the power of the
[1:55:08] resurrection be manifested god how we
[1:55:11] thank you tonight we are yours we give
[1:55:13] ourselves fully to you
[1:55:16] lord when brother ben was talking in
[1:55:19] 1962 coming to 1963 he knows what what
[1:55:24] he's going out west for he knows the
[1:55:26] vision he's seen he knows what the
[1:55:28] dreams are pointing to and even he's
[1:55:30] referencing the dream of junior jackson
[1:55:32] he says show us the hidden manna the
[1:55:34] rock beneath the rock that we might know
[1:55:36] the program of god
[1:55:38] but in all of that he's not saying give
[1:55:40] us understanding give us bible truths
[1:55:43] what is he saying he said cap off our
[1:55:46] lives
[1:55:48] let it be to each individual that this
[1:55:50] word will be the judging stone the
[1:55:53] capping stone the completion of our
[1:55:55] spiritual life that we will unite with
[1:55:57] jesus christ and his life will be
[1:55:59] manifest through each one of us
[1:56:03] may the capstone jesus christ
[1:56:06] put the capstone jesus christ upon each
[1:56:10] and every one of us
[1:56:13] he says the lutherans under
[1:56:14] justification the fee raised it like
[1:56:16] that wesley under sanctification the
[1:56:18] pentecost under the arms the works and
[1:56:20] the deeds and so forth had to be
[1:56:22] calvinist or be armenian and had to be
[1:56:24] legalists but now
[1:56:26] we come to the head the capstone grace
[1:56:30] grace the capstone cried
[1:56:32] the headstone crying what grace grace
[1:56:35] passed from death and creed into a
[1:56:37] living word of a living god god's only
[1:56:40] provided plan for his age his sons in
[1:56:44] the word age quickened by the spirit
[1:56:46] like a spark that's lit off something to
[1:56:48] make it alive and seated now in heavenly
[1:56:51] places in present tense
[1:56:53] already alive and subject to every
[1:56:55] promise in the word
[1:56:57] then what
[1:56:58] then what does that you being part of
[1:57:01] god's gene a part of the word other men
[1:57:04] are part of god's word seated together
[1:57:06] manifest the entire body of christ
[1:57:10] because there's no leaven among you
[1:57:15] you mean we'll have we're coming to
[1:57:17] perfection with no sin
[1:57:20] he's not saying you won't make mistakes
[1:57:22] and you personally yourself may not sin
[1:57:26] but he's saying there's no leaven among
[1:57:27] you
[1:57:28] he's kicked out all the false teachings
[1:57:31] of the denominations
[1:57:33] all the leaven that leavened the love he
[1:57:34] told his disciples beware of the leaven
[1:57:36] of the of the pharisees and be aware of
[1:57:39] the leaven of the herodians and beware
[1:57:41] of the leaven of the sadducees and they
[1:57:42] thought he was talking about bread and
[1:57:44] he was talking about a spiritual leaven
[1:57:45] that corrupted
[1:57:48] and the word of god has come the judges
[1:57:51] come with the word
[1:57:52] to push the leaven out of us
[1:57:55] so we'd no longer be doubting how to be
[1:57:57] saved how to be baptized what is the
[1:58:00] baptism the holy ghost how many gods are
[1:58:02] there amen which church to go to all of
[1:58:05] that has been pushed out
[1:58:09] and we're here to manifest the entire
[1:58:11] body
[1:58:12] of christ
[1:58:15] and that
[1:58:16] is the end
[1:58:22] jesus
[1:58:24] has come as the great headstone
[1:58:27] to cap off
[1:58:29] our lives
[1:58:32] the alpha and the mega amen the
[1:58:35] anointing fell at pentecost amen but it
[1:58:38] was bound by denominational rivers but
[1:58:40] is loosed in the evening time the holy
[1:58:42] ghost back in the church again
[1:58:44] the headstone has come amen so that the
[1:58:47] presence of god can come back to the
[1:58:48] church in full measure once again
[1:58:52] this is the restoration
[1:58:54] of the temple of god
[1:58:56] it is the workers ruble he laid the
[1:58:58] foundation he brought the headstone with
[1:59:00] joshua the high priest
[1:59:03] and i say how many can stay with me go
[1:59:05] on
[1:59:06] cap my life
[1:59:09] with jesus christ
[1:59:11] i don't want this word we can say the
[1:59:13] church's cat praise god the church is
[1:59:15] capped
[1:59:17] and what was the capping of the church
[1:59:18] it was the adoption of the church as a
[1:59:19] bride
[1:59:20] she had come to full maturity and to
[1:59:22] adoption to marriage time
[1:59:24] that was for the whole church but what
[1:59:26] about you as an individual
[1:59:29] you're an individual part of this but
[1:59:30] the individual comes and falls upon the
[1:59:33] cornerstone the individual is built into
[1:59:35] a lively stone into a habitation of god
[1:59:37] and the individual is capped off in an
[1:59:39] adoption to be whatever christ is in
[1:59:41] this earth he is in me
[1:59:44] it's not just the church
[1:59:47] it's you
[1:59:49] i said lord
[1:59:51] i'm falling upon your stone
[1:59:54] i'm falling on your word
[1:59:56] molding me make me match that word so
[1:59:59] the dimensions come out right in my life
[2:00:03] make me fall on this cornerstone and
[2:00:06] shatter me lord amen so you can put the
[2:00:09] right dimensions back together so that i
[2:00:11] could be formed to fit into your program
[2:00:14] not my program your program
[2:00:17] word by word shaped me shave me down
[2:00:20] chisel me out as you would shape a stone
[2:00:22] and fit me into place and cap off my
[2:00:25] life with your life
[2:00:29] that you might have a vessel you can
[2:00:31] have preeminence in
[2:00:33] and you might have a living stone that
[2:00:35] you can live through
[2:00:37] i say now that whatever brother brandon
[2:00:39] was praying for 1963 i'm praying for 20
[2:00:42] 22.
[2:00:44] cap off our lives
[2:00:46] put the capstone of jesus christ on
[2:00:49] everyone so that we would be the very
[2:00:51] image of christ let the proving stone
[2:00:54] prove our life let the proving stone
[2:00:56] prove that we fell on the stone
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:00:59] and that we've accepted the word that we
[2:01:01] believe the word and let us not fear the
[2:01:04] judging stone anymore
[2:01:07] but let the judging stone of this word
[2:01:09] prove that i'm a believer in that word
[2:01:13] let it not be your judging stone into
[2:01:15] condemnation but let it be your judging
[2:01:17] stone unto righteousness saying whatever
[2:01:19] that is i believe with all of my heart
[2:01:22] not something i work myself up to but
[2:01:24] something that's coming from within that
[2:01:27] i
[2:01:28] believe
[2:01:30] when brother ben says turn it to the
[2:01:31] right
[2:01:33] can you see his face can you see his
[2:01:35] head his eyes you see his nose can you
[2:01:37] see his beard
[2:01:40] something in you does not just need to
[2:01:42] see the shadows in a picture of a cloud
[2:01:45] but you see him
[2:01:48] that comes from within
[2:01:50] and you recognize this is the one
[2:01:54] that i want to cap my life
[2:01:56] this message is what i want to be
[2:01:58] identified as this is who i want to be
[2:02:01] one with this message
[2:02:03] i'm done with my ideas i'm done with
[2:02:05] man's ideas
[2:02:09] i'm finished
[2:02:10] questioning whether the message is right
[2:02:13] or not
[2:02:15] i've seen enough to stop questioning and
[2:02:18] to throw myself down on the stone of the
[2:02:20] word
[2:02:21] and say god break me
[2:02:24] break doubts away from me
[2:02:26] break confusion away from me break all
[2:02:29] those other things that i've heard to
[2:02:30] break it all away from me i am convinced
[2:02:32] this is true and i'm done questioning
[2:02:34] and i'm ready to be broken god i'm
[2:02:36] falling upon your stone
[2:02:40] put me back together the way i was
[2:02:42] supposed to be
[2:02:44] when i was in your thought before the
[2:02:45] foundation of the world
[2:02:47] build me up into your image and cap me
[2:02:49] with your very life and live through me
[2:02:52] i'm done living for myself
[2:02:55] i recognize this message is true and
[2:02:57] that judgment stone i want to come and
[2:02:59] judge me
[2:03:01] but when you come and judge me you've
[2:03:03] put something down inside of me
[2:03:05] that you're going to find that there's a
[2:03:07] son and daughter of god here
[2:03:10] judge me your son
[2:03:12] judge me your daughter o great god of
[2:03:15] heaven
[2:03:16] amen god bless you saints let's all
[2:03:18] stand
[2:03:23] the musicians will come and brother john
[2:03:25] if you'll come
[2:03:27] i can't imagine how
[2:03:29] we can be a more privileged people
[2:03:33] i can't imagine how in any way
[2:03:36] that we could have it better than we
[2:03:37] have it now
[2:03:39] and i i'm not looking at our earthly
[2:03:41] situations we may have afflictions and
[2:03:44] things that torment our flesh we may be
[2:03:46] dealing with thorns in our flesh in
[2:03:48] difficult circumstances
[2:03:50] that's not what i'm talking about
[2:03:53] i'm talking about the stone that's come
[2:03:56] and said house of hell give way
[2:03:58] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[2:04:00] there was a great earthquake that shook
[2:04:02] the whole earth under this angel's
[2:04:03] ministry and under that earthquake all
[2:04:06] the bars came down and all the walls
[2:04:08] came open and everybody who wanted to
[2:04:10] could go free
[2:04:13] i said i thank god that that voice has
[2:04:15] knocked the bars out from in front of me
[2:04:18] and i could come out of the confusion
[2:04:20] like brother borders was and i can't i
[2:04:22] just can't grasp it brother but i just
[2:04:24] can't grasp it you know what i was there
[2:04:26] one day i had heard them i just couldn't
[2:04:28] grasp it i just couldn't grasp it oh but
[2:04:30] there was a voice that shook the bars
[2:04:32] down and shook the walls down there was
[2:04:34] a capstone that came amen in it and it
[2:04:37] verified that this message is the truth
[2:04:39] and all of a sudden my eyes came open
[2:04:41] and i can grasp it i can grasp it i can
[2:04:44] grasp it amen
[2:04:46] not intellectually but by faith i can
[2:04:48] see do you see his eyes do you see his
[2:04:50] nose do you see his mouth do you see his
[2:04:52] beard i'm not talking about the picture
[2:04:54] i'm talking about his presence he's here
[2:04:57] now
[2:04:58] the high priest is present he's united
[2:05:01] with his bride can you see his eyes can
[2:05:03] you see his nose do you see his mouth
[2:05:05] can you see his black beard
[2:05:09] oh how blessed we are
[2:05:12] what a people we should wake up every
[2:05:14] morning say thank you god i'm alive in
[2:05:16] this end time
[2:05:19] we're not here to hate our lives we're
[2:05:21] not here to live in a drudgery we're
[2:05:23] here to say god you want to accomplish
[2:05:26] something in your in this day and you
[2:05:27] want to use this vessel i'm here lord
[2:05:30] cap off my life and use me for your
[2:05:32] glory
[2:05:33] i'm here for the final showdown i'm here
[2:05:35] for the final manifestation i'm here to
[2:05:38] show that there is a capstone a judge
[2:05:40] that has come to judge everything
[2:05:42] outside the word is false and everything
[2:05:44] that's in the word is true
[2:05:47] and that capstone of this message the
[2:05:49] opening of the seals
[2:05:51] it has judged me
[2:05:54] a son of god
[2:05:57] how can you be so confident brother chad
[2:06:00] i can't help it i believe it
[2:06:04] my confidence doesn't come from ability
[2:06:06] my confidence doesn't come from any
[2:06:08] natural thing it's not an arrogance it's
[2:06:10] not a confidence that comes from being
[2:06:12] able to accomplish anything this
[2:06:14] confidence comes because i know there's
[2:06:16] something in me that's more than the
[2:06:18] natural me
[2:06:20] it's the true me that when i hear that
[2:06:22] word i say it is the truth i know it is
[2:06:25] the truth
[2:06:26] i can have a storm going on in here but
[2:06:29] that down here always says that's the
[2:06:31] truth
[2:06:32] i can have absolute confusion and
[2:06:34] deception going on up here but there's
[2:06:36] always been something down here when the
[2:06:38] road gets rough and things get tight and
[2:06:40] you get back into the corner there's
[2:06:41] always been something in here says that
[2:06:43] ain't nothing but the truth
[2:06:46] when you see things like a prophet
[2:06:48] turning and laying a cornerstone down
[2:06:52] it was just a piece of rock and just a
[2:06:54] building that building will crumble one
[2:06:56] day and be blown up and be nothing
[2:06:59] but i saw more than just a man laying a
[2:07:02] cornerstone
[2:07:04] i saw the shadow of what was taking
[2:07:06] place spiritually
[2:07:08] and i can say thank you lord for eyes to
[2:07:10] see
[2:07:13] let's just bow our heads and pray
[2:07:17] and i encourage you if you never have
[2:07:20] you have an opportunity
[2:07:22] this morning
[2:07:24] to throw yourself down on this rock
[2:07:27] nobody
[2:07:29] doesn't need to be a show nothing no
[2:07:31] public show we're not looking for any of
[2:07:33] that god knows our hearts
[2:07:36] it doesn't matter how long we've lived
[2:07:38] in the message amen there's people
[2:07:40] who've been raised we can be raised
[2:07:42] anything
[2:07:43] we could be taught to accept it but it's
[2:07:45] not about
[2:07:46] learning it's not about knowledge it's
[2:07:48] not about tradition
[2:07:51] but if you're here and
[2:07:53] you've seen it on heard it all but
[2:07:55] there's something in you says i've got
[2:07:56] to fall on that rock
[2:07:59] i'd invite you just to pray out to the
[2:08:01] lord and say lord i'm coming
[2:08:03] i'm throwing myself upon the rock of
[2:08:05] your word
[2:08:07] god i'm put together wrong i'm misshaped
[2:08:10] i miss everything
[2:08:12] but if i throw myself on that rock and
[2:08:14] i'm broken you can take the broken
[2:08:16] pieces and put them back together the
[2:08:18] correct way
[2:08:20] i tell your friends god has had a plan a
[2:08:23] picture in his mind of you before the
[2:08:25] foundation of the world
[2:08:27] and all he's waiting for you to do is
[2:08:29] throw yourself upon the rock give up
[2:08:31] your ideas and give up your wants and
[2:08:32] come to the word
[2:08:34] and surrender completely to the word and
[2:08:36] throw yourself upon that cornerstone
[2:08:39] and he will take the pieces off of that
[2:08:41] stone
[2:08:42] and put them together the way he saw
[2:08:44] them before the foundation of the world
[2:08:47] he's the master craftsman he's the only
[2:08:50] one who can
[2:08:52] i invite you whether you're young or old
[2:08:54] male or female married or single
[2:08:56] whatever station of life you're in
[2:08:59] does not matter to me
[2:09:01] but if you find yourself afraid of the
[2:09:03] judging stone afraid of the headstone
[2:09:07] i would invite you to start by falling
[2:09:09] on the cornerstone
[2:09:10] the foundation of jesus christ
[2:09:13] and his salvation and his grace is blood
[2:09:16] that will cleanse you this message that
[2:09:18] he's sitting this hour to wash a bride
[2:09:20] by i pray that you fall upon that
[2:09:23] and ask him to put you back together
[2:09:26] and raise you up to a vessel that he can
[2:09:29] cap with his very
[2:09:30] life that he will live through you and
[2:09:34] do through you all that he intends to do
[2:09:36] in this world
[2:09:38] their heavenly father i pray god that
[2:09:40] you would go to hearts right now that
[2:09:42] you would move through aisles and down
[2:09:44] rows and through seats and i pray that
[2:09:46] you would do a work that no human being
[2:09:48] can do because there's nobody that can
[2:09:50] stir a heart only you can
[2:09:52] a human hand can never reach deep enough
[2:09:55] to bring a soul to an awakening you're
[2:09:57] the only one who can but i pray god that
[2:10:00] you would do it lord that you would do
[2:10:02] it in this place and do it to all who
[2:10:04] would listen that you by your own hand
[2:10:06] would reach down that you would move
[2:10:08] away all the darkness lord and that you
[2:10:10] would shine the light of your word down
[2:10:12] into the
[2:10:13] depths of a soul and bring a seed to
[2:10:16] life lord i see that you planted before
[2:10:18] the foundation of the world
[2:10:20] i pray you'd bring somebody to a desire
[2:10:23] to cast themselves upon this stone to be
[2:10:26] broken up lord so that they'll no longer
[2:10:28] be what they were but they'll submit
[2:10:30] themselves to your hand to be whatever
[2:10:32] you make them from here on
[2:10:34] and i pray that you'd make them trophies
[2:10:36] of your grace members of your bride part
[2:10:39] of your great temple in this day that
[2:10:41] you're living and dwelling in that you
[2:10:44] might shine the light of the gospel
[2:10:45] through their lives
[2:10:47] grant it lord grant it this coming year
[2:10:49] for each of us that we would manifest
[2:10:51] you in greater ways than we ever had in
[2:10:53] the past that you would have a greater
[2:10:54] preeminence than you've ever had among
[2:10:56] us that we would surrender and surrender
[2:10:58] and surrender until it's no longer our
[2:11:01] wish our ideas our thoughts but it is

[2:11:16] may we be glory maybe glory in the fact
[2:11:19] that the headstone has come
[2:11:22] and the judgment stone is here
