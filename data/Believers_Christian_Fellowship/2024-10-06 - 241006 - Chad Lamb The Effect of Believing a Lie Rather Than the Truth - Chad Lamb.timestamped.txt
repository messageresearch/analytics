[25:37] and sister Wanda it's good to have you
[25:38] back again amen so God bless you all and
[25:42] let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of
[25:44] John John chapter
[25:55] 8 John chapter 8 when we get there let's
[26:00] go to verse
[26:02] 31 John 8 and verse
[26:08] 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which
[26:11] believed on him if you continue in my
[26:14] word then you are my disciples indeed
[26:16] and you shall know the truth and the
[26:18] truth shall make you free amen God bless
[26:21] you as you have your seats amen may the
[26:24] Lord bless us as we look into his word
[26:28] I'd like to take if I could take for a
[26:31] subject for a title for the service
[26:32] today the effect of believing a lie
[26:35] instead of the truth the effect of
[26:38] believing a lie instead of the truth and
[26:40] so this is uh something that I've been
[26:42] thinking about a long time and and I
[26:44] told you that brother Elmer is partially
[26:46] to blame for the service today but
[26:47] really it's not his fault I was just
[26:49] talking to him yesterday morning and I
[26:51] was just sharing with them uh some
[26:53] things that have been on my heart lately
[26:55] and I made the statement I said but I'm
[26:56] not ready to preach it yet I don't feel
[26:58] feel the Liberty I don't feel and he
[27:00] says why
[27:01] not that's all he said was why not and
[27:05] it was the mouth of God Amen so I tried
[27:08] to explain to him but while I was
[27:10] explaining to him my heart was just I
[27:13] don't know how to explain it but I
[27:14] wasn't believing my own
[27:17] excuse and I realized later you know I I
[27:20] went through the day and I had another
[27:22] subject in mind and I was looking and
[27:23] studying and nothing absolutely nothing
[27:25] click nothing would happen nothing would
[27:27] move I I couldn't get the inspiration to
[27:30] to line up in any way and um finally
[27:33] later in the day or later at night
[27:35] actually it was in the late evening time
[27:38] I couldn't get anything to to click we
[27:40] had many things on our heart lots of
[27:42] things we'd like to discuss in the word
[27:44] but I I just started playing some music
[27:46] and as I was playing the music I just
[27:48] sat back and closed my eyes and when I
[27:50] did a scripture dropped in my heart loud
[27:52] like a thunder said my people shall know
[27:55] the truth and the truth shall make them
[27:56] free and as soon as it did I surrendered
[27:59] I said oh God and I still don't feel
[28:02] prepared to preach it but I know that
[28:04] that's just me that's my own personality
[28:06] that's just Chad that's my own my own
[28:08] handicap amen because I want to I want
[28:10] to know all the nuts and bolts and all
[28:12] the details CU I love those things
[28:14] that's my personality that's my makeup
[28:16] but God doesn't want me amen always to
[28:19] go down that path sometimes he he wants
[28:21] somebody to just say why
[28:23] not why not what's the problem it's been
[28:26] on your heart for a month why don't you
[28:28] just preach it and me and my in my own
[28:32] whatever handicap that I have or
[28:34] whatever you want to call it my
[28:35] temperament I said no no no I don't have
[28:37] it I haven't studied it out I don't know
[28:39] it in great detail but that that doesn't
[28:42] matter that doesn't matter so when I
[28:45] surrendered I just surrendered and so I
[28:47] just pray that you would just receive a
[28:49] portion for yourself today just pull and
[28:51] let God speak I'm trusting God to speak
[28:54] today amen I'm trusting that this is his
[28:56] Direction so we trust his way
[28:59] but Jesus made this statement and you
[29:01] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[29:03] make you free when Jesus makes that
[29:05] statement that statement is always true
[29:08] and so so we we want to we want to grab
[29:10] a hold of that is our foundational
[29:13] fundamental truth is that the truth
[29:15] shall make you free so if you want to be
[29:18] free find the truth because the truth
[29:21] will make you free in fact nothing else
[29:23] will make you
[29:25] free and I just want to talk about that
[29:28] and go down that path if you can go with
[29:30] me to 2 Thessalonians chapter
[29:38] 2 2
[29:40] Thessalonians chapter
[29:47] 2 in verse 10 2 Thessalonians 2 and
[29:53] 10 and it says and with all
[29:55] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[29:57] them that perish because because they
[29:58] received not the love of the truth that
[30:00] they might be saved and for this cause
[30:03] God shall send them strong delusion that
[30:04] they should believe a lie that they all
[30:07] might be damned who believe not the
[30:08] truth but had pleasure and
[30:11] unrighteousness so we we can preach this
[30:13] scripture in many ways there's a lot of
[30:15] things that contained in here but one
[30:17] thing that I I I that jumped out to me
[30:19] was the fact that you have two opposite
[30:23] things that work here you have a lie or
[30:26] the lie and you have the truth and
[30:30] because they had not a love of the truth
[30:31] they were given strong delusion that
[30:33] they should believe a lie that they all
[30:35] might be damned who believe not the
[30:37] truth but had pleasure and
[30:38] unrighteousness so the truth shall make
[30:40] you free but what will a lie do it'll
[30:43] bring damnation it'll bring destruction
[30:45] it'll bring all these negative things
[30:47] and we realize if we go all the way back
[30:49] to the Garden of Eden to the very
[30:51] beginning God had given truth and that
[30:53] truth was a wall of protection that
[30:55] truth was life that truth was Freedom
[30:57] that truth kept them free it kept them
[30:59] in Dominion it kept them in In Perpetual
[31:02] life it kept them in Perfect Harmony it
[31:04] kept the world in Perfection amen but
[31:07] the devil came along and then what did
[31:09] the devil do what was the what was it
[31:12] that he did to change all these
[31:14] circumstances he brought a
[31:17] lie and when Eve accepted the LIE amen
[31:21] What followed the LIE it came with death
[31:24] it came with separation Then There came
[31:26] fear Then There came all of these
[31:28] fallouts amen that was a result of her
[31:31] believing the LIE instead of staying
[31:33] with the truth because the truth was
[31:35] keeping her free the truth that made her
[31:37] free was keeping her free and they were
[31:39] completely free under the
[31:42] truth but it was the lie that brought
[31:45] damnation and destruction and separation
[31:48] and
[31:50] fear we find them in a state of
[31:52] perfection and Harmony and unity and
[31:55] fellowship with God we find them in this
[31:57] perfect State under this perfect word
[31:59] under this perfect truth amen but as
[32:02] soon as they left the truth and went to
[32:03] the LIE now we find them hiding from God
[32:06] we have a broken Fellowship we find them
[32:08] with fear uh Adam says I heard thy voice
[32:11] and I was
[32:12] afraid you find a separation now even a
[32:15] separation between the husband and wife
[32:18] because now amen he's he's blaming her
[32:21] and then she's blaming the serpent and
[32:23] we have all of this Fallout because they
[32:25] left the truth for a lie
[32:29] so this becomes the the effect of
[32:31] believing a lie instead of the truth as
[32:34] long as they believe the truth in stayed
[32:36] with the truth everything stayed perfect
[32:38] they were
[32:39] free soon as they believe the lie the
[32:42] effect of that the results was
[32:45] bondage and I'd like to propose to you
[32:48] today that it's the exact same thing
[32:50] today it never
[32:52] changes that the effect of believing a
[32:54] lie is fear bondage
[32:58] torment separation
[33:01] anxiety those are all the effects of
[33:03] believing a
[33:05] lie but it's still true that the truth
[33:08] will make you
[33:11] free if we go to Revelations chapter 12
[33:14] let's turn there
[33:16] together in Revelation 12
[33:29] verse 3 and 4 Revelations 12: 3 and
[33:36] 4 it says and there appeared another
[33:39] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[33:40] dragon having seven heads and 10 horns
[33:43] and seven crowns upon his heads and his
[33:45] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[33:48] heaven and did cast them to the earth
[33:50] and the dragon stood before the woman
[33:51] which was ready to be delivered for to
[33:53] devour her child as soon as it was born
[33:56] and brother bham in 1957 in questions
[33:59] and answers on Hebrews he refers back to
[34:01] this scripture he said and the red
[34:03] dragon stood to Devour the child as soon
[34:05] as it was born and he took his tail and
[34:07] pulled a third of the stars of heaven
[34:09] and cast them to the Earth did you
[34:10] notice that now that doesn't mean that
[34:13] Satan has a long tail that he hooked
[34:15] around people but the tail t a l e that
[34:20] he told and pulled a third part of those
[34:22] Stars those stars were Abraham's
[34:25] seed so now what brought amen the
[34:28] casting down of these Stars it was a lie
[34:31] that he told it it he gathered around
[34:34] his tail but brother bam showing that
[34:36] it's not just the tail t a i l but it
[34:39] was the tail t a l e it was the lie that
[34:43] he told that caused the fall it was the
[34:45] lie that he told that caused separation
[34:47] it was the lie that he told that caused
[34:50] the stars from Heaven to be cast to the
[34:52] Earth it was all because of a lie and
[34:54] look what changed because of a lie
[34:57] they were dwelling in Perfection Amen in
[35:00] heaven and so they the Stars had
[35:03] fallen and so when when we start to look
[35:06] at this I want to go to First Kings now
[35:08] let's let's just turn
[35:12] there first Kings chapter
[35:21] 22 First Kings
[35:24] chapter 22
[35:31] and uh verse 20 First Kings 22 and
[35:35] 20 this is the story of Ahab and this is
[35:38] where Jehoshaphat comes to Ahab and they
[35:40] want to go up and take their land they
[35:42] want to take the land that is uh uh
[35:45] Syria uh that was portioned to them from
[35:48] Moses and it says here in verse 20 and
[35:52] the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab
[35:55] that he may go up and fall at Routh
[35:57] Gilead so now there's a conference in
[36:00] heaven and brother B begins to show us
[36:01] this conference that takes place in
[36:03] heaven because Micaiah saw it and and he
[36:05] saw that they were gathered in heaven
[36:07] and and God had already spoke through
[36:09] the mouth of of the Prophet amen that
[36:12] Ahab was going to come to Doom because
[36:13] of the choices that he made and now it's
[36:16] time for that destruction to come but
[36:18] how is God going to bring that
[36:20] destruction to Ahab that's the question
[36:22] that he asked in heaven how are we going
[36:24] to accomplish this uh that I've said in
[36:26] Ahab what's going to be the mechanism
[36:29] that we use and he says who shall
[36:31] persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall
[36:33] at Routh Gilead and one said on this
[36:36] manner and another said on that manner
[36:38] so all of these Spirits all these angels
[36:39] are speaking and there came forth a
[36:42] spirit and stood before the Lord and
[36:44] said I will persuade him and the Lord
[36:46] said unto him wherewith and he said I
[36:48] will go forth and I will be a lying
[36:50] spirit in the mouth of all of his
[36:52] prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade
[36:54] him and Prevail also go forth and do so
[36:58] and what was it that what was it that
[37:00] brought ahab's destruction finally it
[37:03] was when Ahab believed a
[37:06] lie brother Bram said you know the
[37:09] biggest story that was ever told the
[37:11] biggest lie that was ever told is one
[37:13] that's got a whole lot of Truth in it
[37:16] now the biggest lie was ever told was
[37:18] what Satan told Eve see it had a whole
[37:20] lot of Truth in
[37:22] it and now you come around and say
[37:24] something that's just really right
[37:26] straight out a lie why you wouldn't
[37:28] believe that you know better but when it
[37:30] comes to a place where it's got about
[37:31] 99% truth and 1% lie that's the
[37:35] deceiving type that's the kind you have
[37:37] to watch is them kind and that's just
[37:40] what the devil's good at I want you to
[37:42] hone in on this this is where he's the
[37:45] expert he's not the expert in the in the
[37:48] blatant falsehood the the complete lie
[37:51] amen that has no truth in it that's so
[37:53] easy to discern but what's the devil
[37:55] good at the Devil is good at the LIE
[37:57] that has mostly truth mixed in it but a
[37:59] little bit of lie amen for deception
[38:02] that's what he's really good
[38:04] at and he told Eve everything truth but
[38:07] one thing amen and so we see here when
[38:09] it comes to Ahab amen he's got this all
[38:12] these prophets a couple hundred prophets
[38:14] that are gathered there and brother B
[38:15] said they're genuine prophets of the
[38:17] Lord amen and he said they have a gift
[38:19] amen they're genuine prophets of the
[38:20] lord they're Hebrew prophets amen but
[38:23] but a lying Spirit entered in and what
[38:25] did that lying Spirit do it was there
[38:27] Amen to fulfill the word of God and that
[38:29] was prophesied over Ahab but what they
[38:32] did is they convinced Ahab and trying to
[38:34] convince Jehosaphat that yes Moses gave
[38:37] you this land amen This Land Is Ours it
[38:40] was given by inheritance we can read the
[38:42] Torah we can find the boundaries we find
[38:45] out that this scripture this word tells
[38:47] us This Land Is Ours that is the
[38:51] truth the lie was that the Lord said go
[38:53] up and take it that's the lie everything
[38:56] else was the truth amen but this was a
[38:59] lie and and Micaiah amen he went to to
[39:02] to go seek the Lord to find out because
[39:05] they called forth him too Jehosaphat
[39:07] wanted to know if there was one more and
[39:09] he begins to come and and and and he
[39:11] begins to uh uh uh uh well he goes and
[39:14] has a vision and he sees this all play
[39:16] out in heaven and he comes back and
[39:18] tells him amen he's already got pressure
[39:20] they they already ahab's angry with him
[39:22] and they've already pressure pressuring
[39:24] him to to to go along with the group so
[39:27] he comes up and he says go on
[39:31] up that's what they wanted to
[39:35] hear that's why the lie was so
[39:38] enticing to Ahab because that's what he
[39:41] wanted to
[39:44] hear and so he he he he says go up and
[39:48] then AB says did not I tell you to only
[39:51] tell me what the Lord says just tell me
[39:52] the
[39:53] truth and my gu says okay I'll tell you
[39:57] the truth here's the truth well zedekiah
[40:00] didn't like it he walked over and
[40:01] slapped him in the face amen and all of
[40:03] these other they they didn't like it
[40:05] they didn't listen to him the truth
[40:07] would have set them free from the
[40:08] destruction that was coming the LIE is
[40:10] what sent them straight to destruction
[40:12] and straight to death was the LIE amen
[40:15] because that's the result of a lie
[40:17] that's the effect of a lie amen it
[40:20] brings death it brings separation it
[40:22] brings damnation it brings fear amen but
[40:24] the truth will set you free but when you
[40:27] told told them the truth they wouldn't
[40:28] accept the truth they stayed with the
[40:33] lie and that lie had a lot of Truth in
[40:36] it it was mostly true but it was the the
[40:40] lie part of that story that was
[40:44] binding Jesus says in John 8 you don't
[40:46] have to turn there I'll just read it to
[40:47] you John 843 why do you not understand
[40:50] my speech even because you cannot hear
[40:53] my word you of your father the devil and
[40:55] the lust of your father you will do he
[40:57] was a murderer from the beginning and
[40:58] Abode not in the truth because there is
[41:00] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[41:03] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[41:06] and the father of it and because I tell
[41:08] you the truth you believe me not here
[41:11] once again Jesus was telling them the
[41:13] truth but they were staying with the lie
[41:15] and he was telling them that you're
[41:16] offspring of the devil amen because you
[41:18] cannot receive my truth because there's
[41:20] no truth in you the devil has no truth
[41:22] in in but he is a liar and the father of
[41:26] it he's the father father of lying the
[41:28] original lie in heaven and the original
[41:30] fall came from Lucifer came from Satan
[41:33] so he is the father of
[41:36] lies and so that means if he's the
[41:39] originator or the father of Lies
[41:41] remember what brother brother brandham
[41:43] tells us a lie is the truth
[41:45] misrepresented it's the truth perverted
[41:48] it's something true but with a Twist on
[41:50] it that's a lie because you that's what
[41:53] the devil had the devil didn't have his
[41:55] own creation he didn't have his own work
[41:57] he didn't have anything so what he did
[41:59] is he took and perverted what God had
[42:01] said and took and perverted what God has
[42:03] done and he's the perverter of the truth
[42:05] and he's the originator or Father of
[42:08] Lies so that means all lies come from
[42:13] him but who's the originator of Truth
[42:15] the originator of Truth is God himself
[42:18] amen because he is the truth amen Jesus
[42:20] says I am the truth the life and the way
[42:24] he is the truth God is the truth the
[42:26] word is truth and the word is
[42:29] God so you have truth which is life you
[42:32] have lie which is death these two stand
[42:35] at a stark contrast with one
[42:38] another and we find it through the whole
[42:42] Bible turn with me to numbers 13 I just
[42:45] want to lay some of these things down as
[42:47] a
[42:48] foundation because there's there's some
[42:50] principles that I want to get to and
[42:54] discuss Numbers Chapter 13 when he began
[42:58] to look at this we find it as you
[43:00] meditate on it it just begins to pop
[43:02] through all the scriptures and I'm sure
[43:04] as you meditate on it even during the
[43:06] service or after the service many things
[43:07] are going to be coming to your mind out
[43:09] of the word amen but but I wanted to
[43:12] move from there amen as we as we
[43:14] progress in the service and as we leave
[43:16] this service I wanted to move from just
[43:18] the stories of old and just the all the
[43:20] things that I see between lie and truth
[43:22] but I want it to come down to my life
[43:24] amen so that I can begin to discern what
[43:26] is the lie and what is the
[43:29] truth numbers
[43:35] 13:31 in in in numbers 13 we have kades
[43:40] barnea kades barnea Moses sends out the
[43:43] spies one from each tribe the 12 Spies
[43:45] go out they go to spy out the land to
[43:48] bring back a report amen and and it's
[43:51] amazing the report that they bring
[43:52] because when they come back amen their
[43:55] report had a lot of Truth in it
[43:59] let's read what they say here in verse
[44:02] 31 said but the men that went up with
[44:06] him said we be not able to go up against
[44:08] the people for they are stronger than
[44:12] we and they brought up an evil report of
[44:14] the land which they had searched unto
[44:16] the children of Israel saying the land
[44:18] through which we have gone to search it
[44:20] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[44:22] thereof and all the people that we saw
[44:24] in it were are men of great stature and
[44:27] there we saw the Giants the sons of
[44:29] anoch which came of the Giants and we
[44:31] were in our own sight as Grasshoppers
[44:33] and so we were in their
[44:36] sight so they go up and they they have a
[44:39] promise and the promise of God is that
[44:41] I'm going to take you to this Promised
[44:42] Land I'm going to give you this land so
[44:44] Moses sent the spies over they brought
[44:46] back a report and when they brought back
[44:48] they came amen with a cluster of grapes
[44:51] that took two men to Bear them they were
[44:53] so great and they said truly the land is
[44:55] a land that floweth with milk and honey
[44:57] they're saying whatever Moses told us is
[45:00] true about the land it's a good land
[45:02] it's a perfect land amen it's a it's a
[45:04] strong land it's got the milk and honey
[45:06] it's got It's fruitful it's everything
[45:09] that he said
[45:15] but
[45:18] but says we be not able to go up against
[45:22] the people for they are stronger than we
[45:27] almost everything they say is
[45:31] true there was wall cities true there
[45:34] was Giants true there was maybe more
[45:38] people true they had better armor true
[45:41] they were better equipped true they were
[45:43] stronger
[45:45] true but we're not able to take it
[45:51] lie everything was true but one little
[45:55] part was a lie
[45:57] the part that said that we can't take
[46:01] it and and I want to look at verse 14 or
[46:05] Chapter 14 verse 1
[46:07] now says and all the congregation lifted
[46:10] up their voice and cried and the people
[46:12] wept that
[46:14] night and all the children of Israel
[46:16] murmured against Moses and against Aaron
[46:18] and the whole congregation said unto
[46:20] them would God that we had died in the
[46:22] land of Egypt or would God we had died
[46:24] in the Wilder in this Wilderness and
[46:26] wherefore hath the Lord brought us into
[46:28] this land to Fall by the sword that our
[46:30] wives and our children should be a prey
[46:33] were it not better for us to return unto
[46:35] Egypt and they said one to another let
[46:37] us make a captain and let us return unto
[46:40] Egypt and Moses and Aaron fell on their
[46:42] faces before all the Assembly of the
[46:43] congregation of the children of Israel
[46:45] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[46:48] son of jeffan which were of them that
[46:50] searched the land rent their clothes and
[46:52] they spake unto all the company of the
[46:53] children of Israel saying the land which
[46:55] we passed through to search it is an
[46:58] exceeding good land and if the Lord
[47:00] Delight in us then when if the Lord
[47:03] Delight in us then he will bring us into
[47:05] this land and give it us and a land
[47:07] which floweth with milk and honey and
[47:10] rebel not ye against the Lord neither
[47:12] fear ye the people of the land for they
[47:14] are bread for us their defenses is
[47:16] departed from them and the Lord Is With
[47:18] Us fear them not but all the
[47:21] congregation bade Stone them with stones
[47:24] and the glory of the Lord appeared in
[47:25] the Tabernacle the congregation before
[47:27] all the children of
[47:31] Israel see the effect of believing a
[47:35] lie they come to barish Cades barnea
[47:39] there was excitement they were thrilled
[47:41] they were at the border they were
[47:42] getting ready to go into the promises of
[47:44] God what Moses had told us we've we've
[47:46] come through the Red Sea we've come
[47:48] through amen the bitter Waters of marrow
[47:51] we've come through the the the all these
[47:53] things that we've passed through in this
[47:55] journey and now we're standing here
[47:56] going in can you imagine the excitement
[47:59] can you imagine the the atmosphere we're
[48:01] getting ready to go in and we're getting
[48:02] ready to have all these Pleasures that
[48:04] have been promised unto us but we're
[48:06] going to send these spies in to tell us
[48:08] what's the best way to go forward and as
[48:10] they go in they come out and they bring
[48:12] 90 some per
[48:15] truth but with it they mixed a lie and
[48:18] that lie was their own reasoning their
[48:20] own thinking their own Vision their own
[48:22] perspective and they mixed that in and
[48:24] the results of that lie mix in with all
[48:27] that truth was a group now who were
[48:30] angry at Moses who were upset at God who
[48:32] wished they had died in Egypt look at
[48:35] how the scene changes in a few moments
[48:37] or a few hours amen from Jubilation and
[48:40] exaltation and excitement CU we're going
[48:42] in but one little lie comes in and that
[48:45] lie that's believed amen remember Caleb
[48:48] tried to say stop amen stop we can take
[48:52] it and they shouted him down amen when
[48:55] he tried to when they Joshua tried to
[48:57] tell him again no the Lord Delight in us
[48:59] their defenses will melt away don't you
[49:01] be afraid amen they wanted to Stone them
[49:04] to death look what a lie brings a lie
[49:06] brings fear separation anxiety paranoia
[49:11] amen disruption separation all of this
[49:14] came because of a little
[49:19] lie my
[49:22] goodness God help us
[49:35] in numbers 23 let's just turn there
[49:38] we're already in numbers let's just turn
[49:39] turn
[49:41] there numbers
[49:48] 23 numbers 23 and 19 said God is not a
[49:52] man that he should
[49:54] lie neither the son of man that he
[49:56] should repent hath he said and shall he
[49:59] not do it or hath he spoken and shall he
[50:02] not make it
[50:04] good God is not the
[50:07] liar God has never lied there's nothing
[50:10] he's ever promised there's nothing he
[50:11] ever said that is not the truth and
[50:14] forever Remains the
[50:17] truth God said he would take them in
[50:19] he'll take them in and to prove it he
[50:22] took them in but not the generation that
[50:23] believed the LIE he had to raise up a
[50:25] new one and he took them in to prove
[50:27] that his word never
[50:28] fails it was true it was always true
[50:31] amen it was the lie that brought
[50:33] separation and and the listen when these
[50:36] people believed a
[50:37] lie it's it's so astounding to me human
[50:41] nature human nature uh uh the more you
[50:44] look at it brother B said I've always
[50:45] been fascinated by the study of human
[50:47] nature he says something like that I'm
[50:50] not fascinated by it I'm
[50:53] disturbed I mean it's fascinating but in
[50:56] a disturbing way cuz we are absolutely
[50:59] the most pathetic creatures that are on
[51:00] the face of the
[51:06] earth I mean everything's going along
[51:09] that Moses is the great leader Moses uh
[51:12] uh did
[51:13] Moses Moses spoke the word of God and
[51:17] performed Miracles and my we've got such
[51:19] a leader Moses oh my goodness well as
[51:22] long as we stay with this man oh we're
[51:24] going to make it all the way through cuz
[51:26] look at what God's doing with this man
[51:28] then they come to the Red Sea and now
[51:29] Moses doesn't know what to do and they
[51:31] panic and they panic and the LIE is that
[51:34] we're going to be
[51:36] destroyed the LIE is Pharaoh's Army is
[51:39] going to kill us and in the face of that
[51:41] lie Moses why did you and Moses why Hey
[51:44] listen you were singing his Praises a
[51:46] few days ago why are you so mad at him
[51:48] now nothing changed with Moses what
[51:51] changed was your
[51:52] belief you believed a lie and now you
[51:55] hate Moses and and then then then all of
[51:57] a sudden they like Moses again and then
[51:59] they hate Moses and then they like Moses
[52:01] and they hate Moses and I feel sorry for
[52:03] poor old
[52:04] Moses because when Moses smoked the Rock
[52:07] and water came out Moses was the man of
[52:09] the hour amen but when they got hungry
[52:11] and they all they had was Mana amen and
[52:13] they were sick of Mana Moses was a
[52:15] problem
[52:21] again oh my
[52:23] goodness and we say those people in the
[52:25] wilderness
[52:27] listen it's time to look in the
[52:29] mirror and be
[52:32] honest we love somebody that's a
[52:34] greatest Minister that's the greatest
[52:35] brother that sister there's nobody like
[52:37] her and then one thing goes wrong and
[52:39] you start to believe that she said
[52:41] something about you or maybe she looked
[52:42] at you a funny way I always had a
[52:44] problem with her and she's all stuck up
[52:47] and last week you said she was the
[52:49] greatest thing that
[52:50] ever ever
[52:54] happened maybe you believed a
[52:58] lie maybe you accepted something about
[53:01] somebody that wasn't true and it begins
[53:03] to break
[53:04] Fellowship like it did at kades
[53:08] barnea until they were ready to Stone
[53:11] Caleb what were they going to Stone
[53:12] Caleb for because Caleb was telling the
[53:15] truth in face of their lie and they so
[53:18] believed and identified with the LIE
[53:19] they wanted to stop the voice that was
[53:21] telling the
[53:24] truth this is the effect of believing
[53:27] lie one of the effects of believing a
[53:29] lie is that when somebody comes to tell
[53:30] the truth you want to kill the person
[53:32] telling the truth because you've already
[53:35] accepted the
[53:39] lie lies are
[53:42] dangerous but we're told the most
[53:43] dangerous lies are the ones that are 95
[53:45] or 99% true with tons of facts to
[53:49] support them evidence exhibit a exhibit
[53:52] B Exhibit C exhibit Z
[53:56] to support this
[53:58] lie but I tell you friends if it's
[54:00] contrary to one word in the Bible it's a
[54:03] lie we can take God's word and stand on
[54:06] God's word it doesn't matter if there's
[54:07] walled cities it doesn't matter if
[54:08] there's Giants it doesn't matter if they
[54:10] have tanks and ballistic missiles and
[54:12] nuclear bombs and whatever they have and
[54:14] you're going in with a plow amen and a
[54:16] sling amen if God said you're going to
[54:19] take the land you're going to take the
[54:20] land remember when God told his
[54:23] disciples let us get into the boat and
[54:24] go to the other side that was the word
[54:26] of the Lord get in the boat and go to
[54:29] let us get in the boat and go to the
[54:31] other side then he lays down and goes to
[54:33] sleep in the back a big storm comes up
[54:35] and all of a sudden the disciples lost
[54:38] sight of the word of the Lord and
[54:40] started to look at the circumstance and
[54:42] they started to believe a lie and the
[54:44] lie was we're all going to
[54:48] die did they believe it that's what they
[54:51] said and the LIE listen lies grow
[54:56] and the LIE morphed
[54:59] into don't you
[55:03] care that we
[55:06] perish the LIE moved from we're going to
[55:09] die to how in the world can you be quiet
[55:12] at a time like this how could you be
[55:14] laying back here asleep we're going to
[55:16] die and you don't
[55:19] care and we say all those
[55:24] disciples those silly
[55:27] disciples what was wrong with them cuz I
[55:30] can read the story and obviously it's
[55:32] going to be
[55:34] okay well you weren't the one having the
[55:36] wave crash over on your
[55:39] head but we've come to places in life
[55:42] where we've had waves crashing over our
[55:44] head you know what we say I'm not going
[55:47] to make it through this trial God don't
[55:49] you see what I'm going
[55:51] through God where are you God why
[55:54] haven't you God why don't you
[56:00] as if he forgot where we were as if he
[56:03] didn't already have a plan as he didn't
[56:05] already know what the outcome would be
[56:07] as he wasn't working all things for his
[56:09] glory as it as as if all things weren't
[56:12] working together for
[56:14] good all of a sudden now we start to
[56:17] believe a lie and what is the LIE we
[56:20] start to believe in our trial we we can
[56:22] believe many of them but if we stay with
[56:24] them they start to grow the LIE is
[56:27] he doesn't see me God's not doing
[56:30] anything to change the
[56:32] circumstances and you can have all kinds
[56:34] of supporting evidence to believe that
[56:35] lie why because you don't see anything
[56:38] changing the circumstance continues this
[56:40] day the next day and the following day
[56:42] and the circumstances are continuing and
[56:44] you start to believe when you start to
[56:46] believe it's always going to be like
[56:48] this it's never going to change I'm
[56:50] always going to be in this position
[56:52] that's a
[56:53] lie that is a lie but when you start to
[56:56] identify that lie it's going to do the
[56:59] thing that a lie has always done through
[57:00] the history of the world and even before
[57:03] the world in heaven the LIE did the same
[57:05] thing it brought damnation it brings
[57:07] destruction it brings separation and it
[57:09] brings
[57:10] fear and the minute you start to think
[57:13] then you start think well something's
[57:14] wrong the minute you start to say
[57:16] something's wrong I've done something
[57:17] wrong something's wrong maybe I'm not a
[57:19] Christian maybe I'm not bride maybe I
[57:21] was just kidding myself maybe God
[57:23] doesn't care about me maybe I I'll
[57:24] always be like this listen you may not
[57:26] verbalize those but those are things
[57:29] that are stirring inside of your heart
[57:30] and your mind because the devil is there
[57:32] stirring up your thoughts and he's
[57:34] Whispering little things into your
[57:37] mind
[57:39] amen and the more you believe that the
[57:41] more you begin to believe that maybe I
[57:43] deceived myself maybe I was never one of
[57:45] them aen maybe I wasn't a Believer the
[57:47] promise works for others but it doesn't
[57:49] work for me lie lie lie lie lie but that
[57:54] lie brings fear cuz now all of a sudden
[57:57] God's not going to come and save you
[57:59] God's not going to defend you and this
[58:00] problem's never going to go away and
[58:03] fear has
[58:07] torment fear has
[58:12] torment and now we find ourselves not at
[58:16] peace brother in the message I know he
[58:19] starts talking about rainy days and
[58:22] cloudy skies are no signs of God's
[58:24] disapproval neither are sunny skies and
[58:26] blue skies and sunny days signs of his
[58:29] approval amen his approval is we've been
[58:31] accepted in the Beloved election Amen
[58:34] period the Revelation that I was chosen
[58:36] before the foundation of the world is
[58:38] the
[58:39] truth I have been accepted not because
[58:43] of what I've done not because of my
[58:44] circumstance and no matter how much my
[58:46] circumstances changed it can't change
[58:48] what he determined in his mind before
[58:50] the foundation of the world that's the
[58:53] truth and the truth will make you free
[58:57] what will bring you into bondage the LIE
[58:59] anything that fights that Truth where it
[59:01] causes you to start to doubt yourself
[59:04] doubt God doubt the promise of the
[59:06] word and the thing is you're a Believer
[59:09] so you can't doubt the word the word
[59:11] Works God's A Healer God's true the
[59:13] message is true but what he's getting
[59:15] you to do is doubt your part of
[59:18] it doubt your position and doubt God's
[59:21] love for
[59:24] you and what is that that lie do
[59:29] fear
[59:31] anxiety
[59:33] separation it'll actually cause you to
[59:35] separate from fellowship and separate
[59:36] from your brethren yes you'll go into a
[59:39] cave and you'll go into a
[59:41] hole you're bound up with emotional
[59:44] damage and baggage and you feel like
[59:47] nobody cares nobody's coming after me
[59:49] nobody's seeking me out God's letting
[59:52] this happen and these things keep
[59:53] happening and it's a cycle and this and
[59:55] this
[59:57] this and what's bringing the separation
[59:59] is you're believing a
[1:00:01] lie because the truth will make you
[1:00:05] free truth will make you
[1:00:08] free when you begin to find yourself in
[1:00:12] bondage fearful anxious wanting to
[1:00:16] separate when you find yourself there I
[1:00:20] want to clue you in on something when
[1:00:22] you find yourself in that spot there's a
[1:00:24] lie somewhere yes there's a lie
[1:00:28] somewhere because the truth doesn't do
[1:00:33] that remember Elijah after the Mount
[1:00:36] Carmel
[1:00:38] Showdown Elijah stood on the word of God
[1:00:40] he stood on the truth and he stood there
[1:00:42] and God had showed him a vision and he
[1:00:44] did exactly what God showed him and and
[1:00:46] the the fire came down it licked up the
[1:00:49] water licked up the sacrifice the stones
[1:00:51] and all amen they took the prophets of
[1:00:53] Baal they slew them he had a mighty
[1:00:55] victory and then a
[1:00:57] woman says something contrary to the
[1:01:01] word about
[1:01:03] Elijah I'm going to do to you the same
[1:01:05] as you did to
[1:01:07] them and what does he do he starts to
[1:01:10] believe the
[1:01:11] lie and what does he do when he believes
[1:01:13] a lie he goes into
[1:01:15] depression brother B tells us about
[1:01:18] this he starts to get depressed he
[1:01:21] starts to separate he goes off by
[1:01:23] himself he even separates amen from
[1:01:26] fellowship with his servant and he goes
[1:01:28] off by himself amen and and he falls
[1:01:31] asleep and God's so tender with him and
[1:01:32] he knows that he's just overworked he's
[1:01:34] over tired amen and that's when the
[1:01:36] Devil comes to us so many times with a
[1:01:38] lie is when we're already exhausted when
[1:01:40] we've been fighting sickness when we've
[1:01:42] been going through a hard time what does
[1:01:43] he do he comes and he slides that lie in
[1:01:47] because he knows you're already
[1:01:48] physically weak and physically weak
[1:01:50] brings your spiritual man into weakness
[1:01:52] and that's when you're the most
[1:01:54] susceptible and comes in and God is so
[1:01:57] tender with him and bakes him cakes and
[1:01:59] and does all this but but then he goes
[1:02:01] he goes off to the cave and in the cave
[1:02:04] his mindset hasn't changed yet even
[1:02:06] though God's merciful and watching over
[1:02:07] his tired servant he's still believing
[1:02:10] lies amen he's believing this thing
[1:02:12] about Jezebel and now he's in the cave
[1:02:14] and and God says what are you doing here
[1:02:16] Elijah and he begins to tell him and and
[1:02:19] then he has the you know the story of
[1:02:20] the fire and the earthquake and the wind
[1:02:22] and but then there was a still Small
[1:02:24] Voice and he came out the still small
[1:02:27] voices and he said again what doest thou
[1:02:29] here Elijah and he
[1:02:31] says they seek my life and I'm the only
[1:02:34] one left that's serving
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:40] lie what was causing his
[1:02:43] depression what was causing his
[1:02:46] separation what was causing him to leave
[1:02:49] his commission and pull
[1:02:51] away the reason is cuz he was believing
[1:02:54] a lie
[1:02:58] if Elijah can suffer that way what about
[1:03:00] you and
[1:03:02] I if it if those lies worked on him do
[1:03:05] you think the same devil who's been
[1:03:07] lying deceiving a third of the angels in
[1:03:09] heaven and casting them down with his
[1:03:10] lie you think he stopped
[1:03:12] lying to the children of
[1:03:15] God no he's good at it brother B said
[1:03:17] he's good at mixing truth facts truth he
[1:03:20] even mixes some scriptures in
[1:03:23] there like he did for Ahab
[1:03:26] mixes some scriptures together and some
[1:03:28] facts together and he puts the pieces
[1:03:30] together and he presents it to you as
[1:03:32] truth but there's a little bit of a lie
[1:03:34] mixed in so now the whole thing's
[1:03:36] tainted and it's not going to bring
[1:03:38] freedom it's not going to be bring life
[1:03:40] it's not going to bring peace it's not
[1:03:42] going to settle your spirit it's not
[1:03:43] going to give you Faith to overcome it's
[1:03:45] going to frighten you cause separation
[1:03:50] damnation depression destruction
[1:03:51] everything that it did to Elijah so
[1:03:54] Elijah starts saying they seek my life
[1:03:55] life and I've been faithful and and I'm
[1:03:58] the only one that's left and God doesn't
[1:04:00] really even deal with that he says
[1:04:02] listen I've called you to do this this
[1:04:04] this and this go do it get back in your
[1:04:07] commission why did you ever leave your
[1:04:09] commission why did you separate why did
[1:04:11] you run away why are you out here hiding
[1:04:13] in a cave Elijah Elijah was hiding in a
[1:04:15] cave because he believed a lie he
[1:04:18] believed Jezebel had the power and
[1:04:20] authority to take his life before God
[1:04:22] determined that it was time for him to
[1:04:24] go that's right
[1:04:28] right and he believed that he was the
[1:04:30] only one serving God and so God dropped
[1:04:33] brother say God breaks a seal for
[1:04:36] Elijah he breaks a seal what's that
[1:04:38] revealing
[1:04:39] truth and he said there's 7,000 who
[1:04:42] haven't bowed in na you're wrong
[1:04:45] Elijah you're only looking at facts that
[1:04:47] you can see you're not realizing the
[1:04:52] truth and so God really he doesn't baby
[1:04:55] on Elijah too much he was good to him
[1:04:57] under the juniper tree he fed him but
[1:04:59] when he starts a dialogue with him at
[1:05:01] the cave he just says what are you doing
[1:05:02] and then he gives us explanation he
[1:05:04] doesn't answer it and then he asks him
[1:05:06] again and he tells him no there's
[1:05:08] 7,000 and he says go do this this and
[1:05:11] this get back to
[1:05:13] work nothing has changed I haven't
[1:05:16] changed my mind you haven't lost your
[1:05:19] position I'm still watching over you
[1:05:21] you're just as protected as you was on
[1:05:23] Mount Caramel you have just as much of a
[1:05:25] history as you did there amen nothing
[1:05:28] has changed it's only in your
[1:05:32] mind because you believed a
[1:05:35] lie amen Jesus said to God when he was
[1:05:39] praying over the disciples he said
[1:05:41] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[1:05:43] is truth where do I find the truth in
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] word that's where I find the
[1:05:49] truth let's turn with me to Joshua 14
[1:06:04] Joshua
[1:06:14] 14 in Joshua
[1:06:16] 14 let's go to verse 7 in verse 7 Caleb
[1:06:20] comes before Joshua to get his portion
[1:06:22] his allotment of the promised land and
[1:06:25] Joshua 14:7 he said 40 years old was I
[1:06:28] when Moses th the servant of the Lord
[1:06:30] sent me from kades barnea to aspy out
[1:06:33] the land and I brought him word again as
[1:06:34] it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my
[1:06:37] brethren that went up with me made the
[1:06:39] heart of the people melt but I holy
[1:06:41] followed the Lord my God what he say I
[1:06:45] believed the word that's what he's
[1:06:50] saying and Moses swear on that day
[1:06:52] saying surely the land where on thy feet
[1:06:54] have trotten shall be thine inheritance
[1:06:56] and thy children's forever because thou
[1:06:58] Hast wholly followed the Lord my God and
[1:07:01] now behold the Lord hath kept me alive
[1:07:03] as he said these 40 and5 years even
[1:07:06] since the Lord spake his word unto Moses
[1:07:09] while the children of Israel wandered in
[1:07:10] the
[1:07:11] wilderness and now lo I am this day 4
[1:07:14] scor and 5 years old he's 85 years old
[1:07:18] it's been 45 years since the day he
[1:07:20] spied out the land tried to tell the
[1:07:23] truth to his brethren
[1:07:25] said I am this day four score and 5
[1:07:27] years old and yet I am as strong this
[1:07:30] day as I was in the day that Moses sent
[1:07:32] me as my strength was then even so my
[1:07:34] strength is now for war both to go out
[1:07:37] and to come in now therefore give me
[1:07:40] this mountain whereof the Lord spake in
[1:07:43] that day for thou heardest that day how
[1:07:45] the anakims were there and that the
[1:07:47] cities were great and fenced if so be
[1:07:50] the Lord will be with me then I shall be
[1:07:52] able to drive them out as the Lord said
[1:07:58] what's what's he doing 45 years later
[1:07:59] he's still standing on the word and and
[1:08:03] standing on the word he was just as
[1:08:06] strong standing on the promise 45 years
[1:08:08] L later as he was the day he said it
[1:08:11] first time amen he believed the word
[1:08:13] when it came out of Moses's lips he
[1:08:15] believed it in the wilderness Journey
[1:08:17] when he comes to kades Baria no matter
[1:08:19] what the facts were he believed the true
[1:08:21] report of God's promised word that I
[1:08:24] will give you this land and you will
[1:08:25] drive out the inhabitants it doesn't
[1:08:27] matter if there's walled cities and if
[1:08:29] there's iron chiots and if there's
[1:08:30] Giants in the land it can't change the
[1:08:32] truth that wall city is a
[1:08:37] lie you can go up and knock on it boy it
[1:08:40] feels
[1:08:41] real it feels like the truth it looks
[1:08:44] like the truth but it's different than
[1:08:47] the word it's a
[1:08:49] lie it looks like it's impenetrable it
[1:08:52] looks like it can't fall down it looks
[1:08:54] like we're short and they're tall it
[1:08:56] looks like I can't get within a Spear's
[1:08:58] reach of that giant there's no way I can
[1:09:01] get to him and kill him there's no way I
[1:09:02] can get inside that gate I there's no
[1:09:04] way I can climb those walls amen those
[1:09:06] are all facts but the facts are not the
[1:09:09] truth because the word is the truth and
[1:09:11] the truth is you shall possess the land
[1:09:14] and I will drive out the
[1:09:17] inhabitants and here Caleb at 85 years
[1:09:20] old waiting 45 years on the promise and
[1:09:23] 45 years later he said I'm just as
[1:09:26] strong today as I was the day that Moses
[1:09:29] sent me to spy out the land you
[1:09:32] understand this is absolutely
[1:09:33] Supernatural what was it it was the
[1:09:36] effect of believing the
[1:09:40] truth this is the difference between
[1:09:43] believing a lie and believing a truth
[1:09:45] all who believed the LIE were dead and
[1:09:48] buried at this day that Caleb saying not
[1:09:50] only am I alive I'm every bit as strong
[1:09:53] as I was the day I believed it
[1:09:55] Hallelujah the word kept my strength the
[1:09:58] word preserved my strength he was strong
[1:10:03] in what in
[1:10:06] faith praise be to
[1:10:08] God let us cast down all lies let us
[1:10:12] cast down all reasoning let us cast down
[1:10:14] everything that's contrary to the
[1:10:16] promised word we've received in this
[1:10:18] hour and see it as a lie
[1:10:26] I'm going to read to you Psalms
[1:10:28] 1171 Psalms 1171 oh praise the Lord all
[1:10:31] ye nations praise him all you people for
[1:10:33] his merciful kindness is great towards
[1:10:35] us and the truth of the Lord endureth
[1:10:40] forever Praise You the Lord if he
[1:10:43] promised it it's still
[1:10:45] true if it's ever been true it's always
[1:10:47] true if it's true for another it's true
[1:10:50] for
[1:10:51] me if I was ever part of his mind I'm
[1:10:54] always part of his mind if I'm ever part
[1:10:57] of his elect I'm always part of his if I
[1:10:59] was ever an attribute I'm always an
[1:11:01] attribute nothing's going to change that
[1:11:03] it doesn't matter how much rejection I
[1:11:05] go through it doesn't matter how many
[1:11:07] obstacles I have to cover it doesn't
[1:11:08] matter how many things go wrong in my
[1:11:10] life it doesn't matter how sick I and
[1:11:12] Afflicted I am it cannot change that
[1:11:14] truth that I was in his mind before the
[1:11:16] foundation of world I'm part of God and
[1:11:18] there's not a thing that will ever
[1:11:19] change that
[1:11:22] truth there'll be many a days we have
[1:11:24] many days we don't feel like the elect
[1:11:27] predestinated seat of God we feel like
[1:11:29] dirt under somebody's
[1:11:31] shoe is that right we feel worse than

[1:11:38] morning sometimes we feel like absolute
[1:11:41] dirt we feel horrible we want to go
[1:11:42] stick our head in the ground somewhere
[1:11:44] we want to climb in a cave and never see
[1:11:45] Humanity again has anybody else been
[1:11:49] there when you're in that condition

[1:13:40] position expose those
[1:13:43] lies
[1:13:45] in Judges chapter 6 let's turn
[1:13:49] on further in our
[1:13:51] Bible to go to judges
[1:14:00] Judges chapter
[1:14:08] 6 judges 6
[1:14:11] And1 and there came an angel of the Lord
[1:14:14] and sat under an oak which was in ofra
[1:14:17] that pertaineth into joash the ezer
[1:14:19] right and his son Gideon threshes Wheat
[1:14:22] by the wine press to hide it from the
[1:14:24] midianites and the angel of the Lord
[1:14:26] appeared unto him and said unto him thou
[1:14:28] the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[1:14:30] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[1:14:33] Lord if the Lord be with us why then is
[1:14:36] all this befallen
[1:14:38] us and where be all his miracles which
[1:14:41] our fathers told us of saying did not
[1:14:43] the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now
[1:14:45] the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered
[1:14:48] us into the hands of the
[1:14:49] midianites and the Lord looked upon him
[1:14:51] and said go in this thy might and thou
[1:14:53] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[1:14:55] midianites have not I sent thee and he
[1:14:59] said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall
[1:15:01] I save Israel behold my family is poor
[1:15:04] in manasse and I am the least in my
[1:15:06] father's
[1:15:07] house oh we set up a struggle right
[1:15:10] away immediately Gideon amen is
[1:15:14] struggling with the
[1:15:16] truth because the angel of the Lord
[1:15:18] brought him the truth and the truth was
[1:15:21] you're a mighty man of
[1:15:23] Valor well that was a shock Revelation
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:26] Gideon because Gideon had a lifetime of
[1:15:29] believing he was the least in his
[1:15:31] father's house and his father's house
[1:15:32] was the least in Israel so he had a
[1:15:35] lifetime of believing a lie about
[1:15:39] himself because God did not decide that
[1:15:42] day that Gideon was a mighty man of
[1:15:44] Valor God predestinated Gideon to be a
[1:15:47] mighty man of Valor in God's mind he was
[1:15:50] always a mighty man of Valor he was
[1:15:52] always chosen he was always elected he
[1:15:54] was always God's
[1:15:56] choice but he grew up in an environment
[1:15:59] where he was the least in his father's
[1:16:00] house he was the least in Israel and
[1:16:04] Israel was under the bondage of the
[1:16:05] midianites they all believed that they
[1:16:07] were forsaken of God they all believed
[1:16:10] that there was no more miracles and
[1:16:11] because they didn't see anything else
[1:16:12] they didn't believe God was there
[1:16:14] anymore and they didn't believe God
[1:16:15] cared about them anymore and under the
[1:16:17] bondage of Midian they all these things
[1:16:20] became the truth to
[1:16:23] Gideon it became true that God's
[1:16:25] forsaken us it became true that because
[1:16:28] we don't see any more signs God's not
[1:16:29] with us it became true amen that that
[1:16:32] God delivered us to the midianites and
[1:16:34] we're always going to be this way and
[1:16:36] I'm the least in the father's house and
[1:16:38] the least in the kingdom and and here I
[1:16:41] am hiding beside the wine press to
[1:16:43] thresh out little weat to hide it from
[1:16:44] the midianites because I have no
[1:16:46] strength to keep my crops I have no
[1:16:48] strength to get the fruit of the land
[1:16:49] God gave me I have no strength I'm weak
[1:16:52] we have no ability God's not here
[1:16:54] there's nothing I can do so I'm hiding
[1:16:56] to get a little
[1:16:57] wheat and that was the truth that Gideon
[1:17:01] believed so when the angel of the Lord
[1:17:03] came to Gideon to give him a true
[1:17:05] identification the angel of the Lord
[1:17:06] said hail there Mighty Man of
[1:17:09] Valor what was that that was nothing but
[1:17:12] the
[1:17:14] truth but what did Gideon think who are
[1:17:18] you talking
[1:17:19] to what he was hiding behind he was
[1:17:23] hiding behind the w r press I can just
[1:17:25] imagine say who else is
[1:17:27] here no it's you Gideon it was addressed
[1:17:31] to you the message is to you the
[1:17:33] messenger was to you the angel was
[1:17:35] talking to
[1:17:37] you thou Mighty Man of Valor and he says
[1:17:40] but then why this and then why this and
[1:17:42] then why that and you know what he
[1:17:45] doesn't answer all the silly questions
[1:17:47] where have you been and why is a midi
[1:17:49] and nice and why are no he doesn't
[1:17:51] answer any of that because God knows
[1:17:52] exactly what he's doing and he's always
[1:17:54] on time and nothing nothing's out of
[1:17:55] cater it's exactly as it's meant to be
[1:17:58] so he doesn't answer all of our foolish
[1:18:00] questions why did you let this happen
[1:18:01] and why did I go through this and why
[1:18:03] this rejection and why was my dad this
[1:18:05] way and why did I grow up in a home like
[1:18:06] this and why did you let me make this
[1:18:08] mistake God may not even answer those
[1:18:10] silly questions because everything's
[1:18:11] working right on time it'll come to an
[1:18:14] expected end because the questions are
[1:18:17] accusations veiled that God you didn't
[1:18:20] and you could have and you should have
[1:18:21] and why
[1:18:23] not the questions are veiled
[1:18:26] accusations yes instead of saying you do
[1:18:29] everything well I don't understand why
[1:18:32] my life went this way I don't understand
[1:18:34] why it started this way I don't
[1:18:36] understand why I had so much baggage you
[1:18:38] want to talk about baggage Gideon is
[1:18:40] coming to his commission with a lifetime
[1:18:41] of baggage they have been servants under
[1:18:45] a stronger Nation who's been robbing
[1:18:47] them year after
[1:18:50] year and their forefathers keep telling
[1:18:52] them they go to church they go to
[1:18:53] synagogue and forefathers say we're the
[1:18:56] chosen of the Lord he loved us above all
[1:18:58] other nations we are the apple of his
[1:19:00] eye and you go on the midi and stomp in
[1:19:02] and take everything you got and take it
[1:19:04] away and you're left destitute ragged
[1:19:06] with nothing
[1:19:08] left and the preaching started sounding
[1:19:11] like a
[1:19:16] lie have you ever sat in church and the
[1:19:18] preaching didn't sound like it fit you
[1:19:25] don't believe a
[1:19:27] lie don't believe a lie if you believe a
[1:19:30] lie the LIE has an effect the LIE brings
[1:19:35] results the LIE brings death spiritual
[1:19:38] death separation it brings anxiety it
[1:19:41] brings fear it brings
[1:19:49] torment Gideon's
[1:19:52] life was a lie
[1:19:55] and he had a photo album to prove it
[1:19:58] all he has facts exhibits A through Z
[1:20:02] then A1 through Z1 and A2 through
[1:20:05] Z2 you get the
[1:20:07] point he had all kinds of reasonings to
[1:20:09] justify why he wasn't a mighty man of
[1:20:11] Valor why why things weren't good in
[1:20:13] Israel why uh this this isn't going to
[1:20:17] work and God just tells
[1:20:19] him go
[1:20:22] on go on
[1:20:26] he says in verse 14 and the Lord looked
[1:20:28] upon him and said go in this thy might
[1:20:31] and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
[1:20:33] of the midianites have not I sent thee
[1:20:37] that's the
[1:20:39] truth he said how am I going to save
[1:20:43] Israel I'm poor my family's poor and I'm
[1:20:47] the least in my father's
[1:20:49] house oh Gideon stop looking at lies
[1:20:58] Gideon has a hard time believing so he
[1:21:00] asked the Lord for a fleece remember
[1:21:02] this the next thing he says if these
[1:21:04] things be true then I'll lay at this
[1:21:05] fleece and let the Dew fall in it but
[1:21:07] not on the ground and and he went out
[1:21:09] and he rung it out and the next day it
[1:21:10] was changed and God was good to
[1:21:13] Gideon because Gideon was God's chosen
[1:21:16] wasn't like Gideon was going to go to
[1:21:18] God was going to go to plan B there was
[1:21:19] no plan B Gideon was it cuz Gideon's
[1:21:22] part of the word and God's not changing
[1:21:24] his word
[1:21:25] it was part of the word when it was
[1:21:26] played out in the mind of God before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world he's not
[1:21:29] changing no matter what Gideon thinks or
[1:21:31] how Gideon feels or how much Gideon
[1:21:33] struggles God's not changing out Gideon
[1:21:35] Gideon is part of the
[1:21:37] word it's not changing so God in his
[1:21:41] goodness to Gideon he begins to give him
[1:21:43] he begins to give him a little something
[1:21:46] extra I'm so thankful God gives us
[1:21:49] something extra sometimes sometimes
[1:21:51] we're so down and so beat down and we
[1:21:53] struggled so much and we can't seem to
[1:21:55] overcome the lies in our lives I thank
[1:21:57] God he'll always send something extra a
[1:21:59] little Supernatural nudge a little
[1:22:01] something that only you know only he
[1:22:03] knows you know so that you know that he
[1:22:07] knows Amen to give you the courage amen
[1:22:10] you know it's those super little
[1:22:12] Supernatural things amen those things
[1:22:14] don't bring the promise to pass all they
[1:22:16] do is encourage your faith to believe
[1:22:18] the word that's already there to believe
[1:22:20] who you already are just because God
[1:22:22] does something Supernatural in your life
[1:22:25] doesn't make you bride amen you were
[1:22:27] bride from before the foundation of the
[1:22:29] world whether anything Supernatural
[1:22:31] happens or
[1:22:33] not amen it's not those things that make
[1:22:37] you who you are that's just because God
[1:22:40] said Gideon said I'll lay at the fleece
[1:22:42] and do this and that wow it
[1:22:44] worked did it again wow it
[1:22:47] worked maybe I am a warrior it wasn't
[1:22:50] the doe Falling by his request that made
[1:22:53] him anything he was already in the mind
[1:22:55] of God the Mighty Man of Valor and the
[1:22:58] deliverer of
[1:22:59] Israel but God did something extra for
[1:23:02] him Amen to get him to step past the
[1:23:05] lies to get him to put down the doubts
[1:23:07] and get him to believe what the angel
[1:23:09] already said it wasn't new truth it
[1:23:12] wasn't something else amen it give him
[1:23:14] the courage to believe what was already
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:18] said may
[1:23:20] God encourage our faith may God do those
[1:23:24] little extra things for us that help us
[1:23:29] to say he
[1:23:30] knows he knows where I am and he knows
[1:23:33] what I'm struggling with may it give us
[1:23:35] the courage to say I accept what he
[1:23:39] says we know that Gideon went out and
[1:23:41] there was a mighty delivery brought
[1:23:43] through the hand of Gideon the least in
[1:23:46] his father's house poor of the House of
[1:23:49] manasse under bondage all of his life
[1:23:52] feeling like the preaching didn't work
[1:23:53] and the truth truth weren't true for him
[1:23:56] anymore but when he accepted what the
[1:23:58] angel said about
[1:24:01] him yes he became what God always
[1:24:05] ordained him to be he stepped into the
[1:24:08] rule and God used him to deliver
[1:24:14] Israel the devil is a
[1:24:19] liar problem is he's good at
[1:24:21] it he's a good liar can we say it that
[1:24:25] way he's a very good
[1:24:28] liar he'll use he'll use the Scrapbook
[1:24:32] of your photo
[1:24:35] album and show you
[1:24:37] pictures Turn the Page remember this oh
[1:24:41] remember that remember
[1:24:43] this you're
[1:24:46] nothing you can't be there's no way it
[1:24:49] applies to you remember that when that
[1:24:52] happened oh come here come here let me
[1:24:54] show you
[1:24:57] this that has nothing to do with
[1:25:01] it the word was true from before the
[1:25:05] foundation of the world it ever remains
[1:25:09] true it will always be
[1:25:11] true it's not true because I feel like
[1:25:13] it's true it's true because it's
[1:25:15] true and when I don't feel like it's
[1:25:17] true it's true when I feel like it's
[1:25:19] true that doesn't make it true I'm just
[1:25:20] my feelings finally lined up with the
[1:25:22] truth
[1:25:25] praise God brother Benham says one
[1:25:28] time in uniting sign uniting time and
[1:25:31] sign this is in August of
[1:25:34] 1963 he says one of the main things
[1:25:36] that's always hurt me through my life
[1:25:38] has been a nervous condition that when I
[1:25:41] get so worn and I get real weary kind of
[1:25:44] feel like nobody cares for you you
[1:25:48] know this is the prophet of God after he
[1:25:51] preached the
[1:25:52] seals you know what after he preach the
[1:25:55] seals he knows he's the seventh
[1:25:58] angel he knows he's ma he's Malachi 4 he
[1:26:02] also knows that he's Revelation 10:7 no
[1:26:05] doubt about it there's nobody no way the
[1:26:07] seals could open until that angel was
[1:26:09] present on Earth he says so
[1:26:13] emphatically he's got a revelation of
[1:26:15] who he is he know he's saved he's know
[1:26:17] he's filled with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:26:18] knows the true revelation of
[1:26:20] God but yet he gets the feeling like
[1:26:23] nobody cares about him
[1:26:24] you know you have it
[1:26:29] too I say
[1:26:31] Amen you just happen to I just happen to
[1:26:34] have a real overdose of it you know and
[1:26:36] it gets real bad
[1:26:39] sometimes
[1:26:40] I I love
[1:26:43] this I love
[1:26:46] this I love the fact that he come and
[1:26:48] tell us this so that when we get it real
[1:26:50] bad sometimes we don't feel like I can't
[1:26:52] be part of God's program
[1:26:55] cuz no matter how much brother bham felt
[1:26:57] like nobody cared for him and he had it
[1:26:59] bad real bad it didn't change the fact
[1:27:02] that he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:27:04] in Revelation 10:7 that he was the
[1:27:06] seventh angel and he was on Earth and he
[1:27:08] was the one that God sent the seals
[1:27:10] to didn't change it just the way he felt
[1:27:14] said I get real bad sometime and I can
[1:27:16] hardly it's tension and that's what does
[1:27:18] it I get to a spot then that many times
[1:27:20] especially with so many of those Visions
[1:27:22] you see it just gets me I look at a
[1:27:24] person I think this is Aion no no no it
[1:27:26] isn't yes yes it is you see and you
[1:27:28] don't realize what a price goes with
[1:27:30] that so then you wonder then you get to
[1:27:32] thinking well then you get off on your
[1:27:35] side and say well now what uh uh uh what
[1:27:39] have I done here I am 50 years old I've
[1:27:41] done nothing for the Lord I'm getting
[1:27:43] old oh my then you just get what we used
[1:27:46] to call the
[1:27:48] blues what is the blues it's
[1:27:52] depression I mean it may be a minor form
[1:27:55] it's not clinical depression but it's
[1:27:59] depression once you have the Holy Ghost
[1:28:01] you'll never feel blue
[1:28:03] again once you catch the revelation of
[1:28:05] the
[1:28:09] word praise God you know what I love I
[1:28:13] love honesty and truth and
[1:28:17] reality he goes we used to call it the
[1:28:19] blues some of you Brethren about my age
[1:28:21] remember what they used to call having
[1:28:23] the blues pop used to talk about it I
[1:28:25] wondered what he meant I sure know I
[1:28:27] sure know now what he meant so then you
[1:28:30] get to feeling that way which is none of
[1:28:33] it true amen it's just you and you know
[1:28:36] it see you know it it's just you doing
[1:28:41] that listen the reason I wanted to read
[1:28:43] this quote is because this is
[1:28:46] life this is The Human Experience that
[1:28:48] we're subject to still living in Fallen
[1:28:50] bodies with Fallen human spirits and
[1:28:52] Fallen Minds amen we still fall into
[1:28:54] this category sometimes but what did
[1:28:56] Brother Brenham had to do he was falling
[1:28:58] into that right then he had got
[1:29:00] overworked he's talking about he had
[1:29:01] overworked too many Visions too many
[1:29:03] meetings he got under a bunch of tension
[1:29:04] and he got feeling low he got feeling
[1:29:06] blue and he started feeling like nobody
[1:29:08] cares about me nobody loves me amen and
[1:29:11] he talks about this in more than one
[1:29:12] place and when he gets down to that spot
[1:29:15] what does he have to do he has to
[1:29:17] proclaim the truth and you know that's
[1:29:19] not true that's just you doing that
[1:29:22] that's just me that's not the reality
[1:29:25] that's just an emotional response that's
[1:29:27] just the way I'm feeling why because we
[1:29:29] have to identify the lie and we have to
[1:29:31] say that's not
[1:29:34] true you know what happen would happen
[1:29:36] if he get into this spot and get feeling
[1:29:38] down and get feeling blue and feel like
[1:29:40] nobody cares about him you know what
[1:29:42] would happen if he wouldn't confess
[1:29:43] something different he would fall all
[1:29:45] the way into depression because he would
[1:29:47] give over to that Spirit that's trying
[1:29:48] to plague his mind and get him to
[1:29:50] believe a lie and the LIE is nobody
[1:29:52] cares about you and nobody loves you
[1:29:54] amen and you're rejected amen cuz this
[1:29:56] is a boy who's suffering from a
[1:29:58] rejection complex from childhood and now
[1:30:00] you're rejected and nobody loves you and
[1:30:02] nobody cares about you and if he would
[1:30:04] have started repeating that nobody cares
[1:30:06] about me nobody loves me what would he
[1:30:09] be doing he'd be confessing his
[1:30:11] feelings and his feelings are a lie and
[1:30:15] he would be confessing a lie and he
[1:30:17] would be walking in that lie and then
[1:30:19] that lie would bring separation and
[1:30:21] depression and fear and anxiet Y and
[1:30:24] turmoil and he would be fullblown in the
[1:30:27] seed of
[1:30:30] depression but what's he say it's none
[1:30:33] of it's true hallelujah it's not true I
[1:30:37] feel like it's true but it's not true if
[1:30:40] feels real but it's not real it feels
[1:30:42] true but it's not true why how can you
[1:30:44] say it's not true amen because it
[1:30:46] doesn't matter what anybody says or what
[1:30:48] my emotions tell me God loves me he
[1:30:50] loved me before the foundation of the
[1:30:52] world and if God before me who can be
[1:30:54] against me what does it matter and
[1:30:56] besides that God's children love me
[1:30:58] because the word says they
[1:31:01] will not because I feel like they love
[1:31:03] me but because the word says there'll be
[1:31:05] love of the Brethren and they'll have
[1:31:08] love for one another unfeigned
[1:31:10] love of the
[1:31:12] Brethren you may feel like there's not a
[1:31:14] soul in the world that loves
[1:31:16] you but that's not true that's just a
[1:31:20] feeling you may feel like everybody's
[1:31:22] turned their back on you you know
[1:31:23] brother Bram felt that way he comes to
[1:31:26] preach a message called the present
[1:31:28] stage of my Ministry Deus has forsaken
[1:31:30] me he feels like the the the so many
[1:31:32] people have walked away the
[1:31:33] denominations have walked away the Full
[1:31:35] Gospel businessmen are pulling back from
[1:31:37] him amen and he's feeling this rejection
[1:31:39] and he's showing that there has to be a
[1:31:40] pattern of this in the word but the
[1:31:42] reality nothing has changed in the
[1:31:44] ministry he starts to say that's not the
[1:31:46] end of the ministry it's not washed up
[1:31:48] it's the crowning of the ministry it's
[1:31:50] part of the word it's the the reality is
[1:31:53] God is crowning this
[1:31:55] ministry why because he was confessing
[1:31:58] the word not what he was
[1:32:03] feeling none of it's
[1:32:08] true none of it's
[1:32:11] true Romans 3:4 says let God be true and
[1:32:15] every man a
[1:32:19] liar let God be true and every man a
[1:32:22] liar
[1:32:25] even the things you feel and think if
[1:32:27] it's contrary to the word it's a
[1:32:30] lie and let it be a lie call it a lie
[1:32:34] amen say I I feel like I'm completely
[1:32:37] rejected that's a
[1:32:39] lie call it a
[1:32:41] lie don't accept it as true don't
[1:32:44] confess it as true don't speak it as
[1:32:46] though it's true that's contrary to the
[1:32:48] Bible how can you as a son or daughter
[1:32:50] of God take these lips that we ordained
[1:32:52] to speak the truth truth and speak a lie
[1:32:55] amen based off a feeling God help us
[1:32:57] forgive us for ever doing that and help
[1:32:59] me God never to do it again but help me
[1:33:01] to speak the word when every sense in me
[1:33:04] tells me that it's not true let me deny
[1:33:06] the senses and take the truth of your
[1:33:08] word I have been accepted in the Beloved
[1:33:11] when was I accepted in the Beloved when
[1:33:13] I was a good boy and everybody patted me
[1:33:15] on the back and I was doing that I was
[1:33:17] accepted before the foundation of the
[1:33:19] world I've been accepted in the Beloved
[1:33:21] before the foundation of the world I'm
[1:33:23] still accepted in the Beloved and when
[1:33:25] I'm laying in my bed crying because I'm
[1:33:27] depressed and I'm hurt because of things
[1:33:29] people said I'm still accepted in the
[1:33:33] Beloved my pillow may be wet at night
[1:33:36] but it doesn't change the condition of
[1:33:38] my soul and it doesn't change my
[1:33:40] position with God that is a
[1:33:43] lie and I can't help that this body
[1:33:46] feels it and I can't help that it reacts
[1:33:48] to it and I can't help that it hurts and
[1:33:50] I can't help that I cry but I can help
[1:33:52] what comes out of my mouth and help me
[1:33:54] to only confess the truth not the
[1:33:57] lie that is nothing but a
[1:34:00] lie I'm forsaken God doesn't see me it
[1:34:04] doesn't ever work out for me it works
[1:34:07] for everybody else but it doesn't work
[1:34:08] for me uh
[1:34:11] lies don't say them
[1:34:13] anymore unless you want
[1:34:15] separation depression fear anxiety and
[1:34:20] torment if that's what you're looking
[1:34:22] for keep saying those things cuz that's
[1:34:24] exactly what you're going to
[1:34:26] get but if you speak the truth
[1:34:29] hallelujah if you speak the truth and
[1:34:31] make the truth your bread make the truth
[1:34:33] your reality make it your speech am deny
[1:34:37] the LIE listen you may not walk out of
[1:34:40] that circumstance the first minute or
[1:34:42] the first hour but the reality is you're
[1:34:43] going to walk out of that circumstance
[1:34:45] because the word is
[1:34:48] true you know there's no condition in
[1:34:50] your life that has remained every day of
[1:34:52] your life I mean except being hybrid and
[1:34:54] all
[1:34:56] that things change they don't stay the
[1:34:59] same forever circumstances change
[1:35:02] situations change things change they
[1:35:05] change amen but the LI is it's going to
[1:35:07] be this way forever and it's going to
[1:35:08] change anyways and when it changes
[1:35:10] you're going to have to go back and say
[1:35:11] God I'm sorry for all those things I
[1:35:14] said let's just say God help me not to
[1:35:17] say any of those
[1:35:20] things brother Benham in perfect Faith
[1:35:23] he preaches this is a week after the
[1:35:24] last quote I read about having the blues
[1:35:27] said how many of you will be waiting
[1:35:28] over till the morning that's got a long
[1:35:30] distance to go I appreciate that that
[1:35:32] effort some of you will drive home
[1:35:34] tonight cuz you got to go to work by
[1:35:36] daylight in the morning and I know it's
[1:35:38] hard and then when I think I see that I
[1:35:41] get spells too you know I get moody I
[1:35:44] get to a spot where what gets me is
[1:35:46] where I get to those spells when I get
[1:35:48] all overworked and Satan comes telling
[1:35:50] me why nobody cares for you you you
[1:35:53] really haven't got a friend in the world
[1:36:00] see
[1:36:01] amen remember I'm not immune to
[1:36:05] Temptation see I got to overcome that
[1:36:08] you know brother said overcome it not
[1:36:10] give into it you realize what he's
[1:36:13] saying it comes he gets it he feels it
[1:36:18] he doesn't give into
[1:36:20] it it's a temptation
[1:36:25] the thing is it's become so normal in
[1:36:26] some of our Lives we accept it as a
[1:36:28] reality and not recognizing it's a test
[1:36:31] it's a Temptation the devil's tempting
[1:36:34] you to speak against the word or speak
[1:36:36] contrary to the word you don't see it as
[1:36:37] a Temptation you see it as a life
[1:36:40] condition and because you see it as a
[1:36:42] life condition you claim it as a life
[1:36:43] condition you speak it as a life
[1:36:45] condition and it remains a life
[1:36:47] condition and it brings depression and
[1:36:49] separation and anxiety and fear and all
[1:36:50] the things that lies bring
[1:36:54] but it's a test to see what you'll do
[1:36:57] with the
[1:37:02] word I'm not immune to the Temptation I
[1:37:05] got to overcome that then when I look
[1:37:06] back and see something like this I put
[1:37:08] it right back in his face and say what
[1:37:10] about that that helps me to overcome
[1:37:13] what about that what he's saying is all
[1:37:16] the people come to hear him they stayed
[1:37:17] late they have to drive back and go
[1:37:19] right to work as soon as they get there
[1:37:20] they stay over they drive hours you know
[1:37:22] what brother bam said saying I'm using
[1:37:24] that as ammunition against the LIE of
[1:37:26] the devil I'll say God what about that
[1:37:28] what about those people not God but
[1:37:30] Satan what about those people who come
[1:37:31] to hear what about you're a liar what's
[1:37:33] he doing he's fighting back against the
[1:37:36] lie and if we want to overcome we've got
[1:37:38] to fight back against a lie we can't
[1:37:40] confess it and accept it and declare it
[1:37:43] and keep walking in it we've got to say
[1:37:45] what the word says not what our feeling
[1:37:49] say amen I asked brother Franco to put
[1:37:51] together a video if we could go ahead
[1:37:53] and start bringing that up I want to I
[1:37:55] want to go through a video and and
[1:37:56] something struck my heart amen and I
[1:37:58] wanted to share with you something from
[1:38:00] the prayer line This is a a small
[1:38:02] section we're going to show about one
[1:38:03] minute of the Chicago campaign it's one
[1:38:06] of the few videos we have of brother
[1:38:08] brandham and discernment in the prayer
[1:38:09] line and I want I want you to catch this
[1:38:13] and like I said it's going to be about 1
[1:38:15] minute approximately one minute but it
[1:38:17] is a super profound one
[1:38:19] minute and so whenever it comes up we
[1:38:23] can just go right into
[1:38:27] it and and brother V was going to talk
[1:38:29] to a woman I want you to watch your

[1:39:33] discernment she's coming up to
[1:39:35] discernment she's got trouble in her
[1:39:36] life he says you got a lot of trouble on
[1:39:38] nervous and you got a lot of trouble in
[1:39:39] your heart and you got a heart
[1:39:41] condition here comes a woman to him
[1:39:44] she's getting prayed for and I don't
[1:39:45] know what her main request was what did
[1:39:47] she had in her mind but one of the
[1:39:48] things was a heart condition and and and
[1:39:52] what's happening brother B Discerning
[1:39:54] God's Discerning through the prophet he
[1:39:56] says you I see a black sheet following
[1:39:59] you a black sheet following you think
[1:40:02] she couldn't feel that you think it
[1:40:05] wasn't affecting her life you think that
[1:40:06] black sheet had no effect on her
[1:40:08] emotionally you think had no effect on
[1:40:10] her
[1:40:10] daily I see a black sheet it's a
[1:40:14] lie what was the woman suffering with
[1:40:16] she was suffering the effect of a lie
[1:40:18] amen it was a lie he says there's
[1:40:21] nothing wrong with your heart the only
[1:40:22] thing wrong with your heart is that
[1:40:23] nervousness has your heart all worked up
[1:40:25] what was making her nervous somebody
[1:40:26] told a lie on her when she's standing
[1:40:28] here before the prophet her hands are
[1:40:30] ringing the entire time before he gets
[1:40:32] to this discernment he starts talking to
[1:40:33] the congregation for a minute or so and
[1:40:35] she's here ringing her hands the whole
[1:40:37] time she's a nervous wreck what's making
[1:40:39] her so nervous is somebody told a lie
[1:40:41] about her it was a man professing Divine
[1:40:44] Healing and she was struggling with
[1:40:45] whether that lie was true I don't know
[1:40:47] how much she accepted or not but it set
[1:40:49] about an effect in her amen that had her
[1:40:52] nervous and had her heart all worked up
[1:40:54] and brother bham he looks right at her
[1:40:56] and said that's a lie and then he says
[1:40:57] don't you pay no attention to what those
[1:40:59] people are saying they're a
[1:41:02] liying he says you're all right you're
[1:41:04] fine amen then he shakes her hand and
[1:41:07] and then she walks off the platform and
[1:41:09] as she walks he turns to her and says
[1:41:11] you're not a
[1:41:12] witch what do you think that did to that
[1:41:15] sister when the prophet of God under it
[1:41:17] if he could know all of those things if
[1:41:19] he could know what happened and about
[1:41:21] your life and what was said wouldn't God
[1:41:23] also be able to say you're not a witch
[1:41:25] she walked off of there and she knew
[1:41:27] beyond a shadow of a doubt she was not a
[1:41:29] witch amen you think she had any more
[1:41:31] heart problems you think she was ringing
[1:41:33] her hands anymore amen there was a few
[1:41:35] seconds where a truth dispelled the lie
[1:41:38] and her problems went away you know what
[1:41:41] else she didn't pray and brother
[1:41:43] brandham didn't pray he never prayed for
[1:41:45] her he didn't need to pray for her there
[1:41:47] was nothing wrong with her she didn't
[1:41:49] need healing she didn't need prayer she
[1:41:51] needed the truth am
[1:41:54] amen you know what we need more than
[1:41:56] anything we need the truth friends we
[1:41:58] need to line up with this truth and
[1:42:00] confess the truth amen we we go to
[1:42:03] prayer because we need it to become real
[1:42:05] we need everything else to get quiet we
[1:42:07] need to spend time getting the things
[1:42:09] out of our minds that are lying to us so
[1:42:11] that we can come in line with the word
[1:42:13] but what brings Deliverance is the truth
[1:42:15] amen when the truth is believed it
[1:42:17] brings
[1:42:18] Deliverance oh praise
[1:42:21] God and Psalms 120 verse one it says in
[1:42:26] my distress I Cried unto the Lord and he
[1:42:28] heard me deliver my soul oh Lord from
[1:42:30] lying
[1:42:32] lips and from a deceitful
[1:42:35] tongue what did is what he need
[1:42:37] delivered from lying
[1:42:40] lips here comes a woman who had a lie
[1:42:42] told on
[1:42:45] her you know many of us have had lies
[1:42:48] told on
[1:42:49] us but you know there's there's two
[1:42:52] different kinds of Lies
[1:42:53] there's direct lies and indirect lies
[1:42:56] there's a direct lie when somebody says
[1:42:58] something right to you and right about
[1:43:00] you or it's completely
[1:43:02] false but there's an indirect lie and
[1:43:05] I'll just share it with you this
[1:43:07] way somebody does something to do or you
[1:43:09] get caught up in a
[1:43:10] circumstance a
[1:43:12] situation and the Devil comes and
[1:43:15] interprets that situation to
[1:43:17] you as meaning
[1:43:20] XYZ so in the four year the brother
[1:43:22] didn't make eye contact you and he
[1:43:23] didn't shake your hand that means he
[1:43:25] doesn't want to talk to you
[1:43:27] anymore that's a
[1:43:30] lie when you believe that lie that lie
[1:43:33] will take effect that lie will bring
[1:43:37] separation that lie will bring
[1:43:38] destruction that lie will bring
[1:43:41] torment what will set you free the
[1:43:45] truth the
[1:43:46] truth no matter what's going on with
[1:43:48] that brother what he meant to do or
[1:43:50] didn't mean to do doesn't change
[1:43:51] anything he's my brother and the word
[1:43:53] ever remains
[1:43:57] true see when we believe things like
[1:44:00] that about one another when we believe
[1:44:01] that we begin to act out what we believe
[1:44:03] and it causes more and more separation
[1:44:05] and we create sometimes our own
[1:44:07] reality by believing the LIE instead of
[1:44:09] believing the truth but if we believe
[1:44:11] the truth then my brother didn't mean it
[1:44:13] or uh uh he didn't mean it he must have
[1:44:14] missed it he's still my brother he loves
[1:44:16] me we have unfeigned love for the
[1:44:17] brother the next time you see him you're
[1:44:18] just going to love him you're just going
[1:44:19] to hug him you're going to act like
[1:44:20] nothing happened and guess what nothing
[1:44:21] will happen nine times out of 10 that
[1:44:24] doesn't mean there's never issues
[1:44:25] there's always things going on but I'm
[1:44:26] talking the majority of the time it was
[1:44:28] an interpretation of events that led you
[1:44:30] to believe a lie and when you believe
[1:44:32] the lie the LIE brings the same
[1:44:34] destruction lie always bring but what
[1:44:36] will set you free when you choose to
[1:44:38] take the
[1:44:39] truth over the LIE when you come to
[1:44:42] church and act like everybody in here
[1:44:44] loves you and you can't wait to talk to
[1:44:45] them and hug him guess what that's going
[1:44:47] to become the reality you live in when
[1:44:49] you come to church believing everybody's
[1:44:51] rejected you and they don't care about
[1:44:53] and they don't really love you and they
[1:44:54] guess what that's the reality you're
[1:44:56] going to live
[1:44:58] in choose the word choose the word
[1:45:02] confess the word speak the word and if
[1:45:05] you don't feel it say it brother B said
[1:45:07] say it till you believe
[1:45:09] it same thing with healing amen you
[1:45:11] believe the doctor you'll die you
[1:45:13] believe the word you'll
[1:45:15] live I say speak the word we not stop
[1:45:19] talking about everything the doctor
[1:45:21] said the doctor said this and the doctor
[1:45:24] said that the doctor probably 6 months
[1:45:26] and probably may die and 20% chance and
[1:45:30] just keep repeating that all the time
[1:45:31] and see what happens to your
[1:45:33] heart or say well the doctor's got his
[1:45:36] ideas he's looking at this but I'm
[1:45:37] looking at a promise that by his stripes
[1:45:40] I am already healed and that I choose to
[1:45:44] confess amen it's not wrong to tell
[1:45:46] somebody what the doctor said that's not
[1:45:48] wrong what's wrong is to go tell
[1:45:49] everybody what the doctor said and only
[1:45:51] say what the doctor said and quit
[1:45:53] confessing what Dr Jesus
[1:45:55] said amen and then you start to believe
[1:45:58] that lie and when you start to believe
[1:46:00] that lie you start to has an effect on
[1:46:03] you and it'll separate you from the
[1:46:05] truth and it'll bring despair
[1:46:07] discouragement depression in your
[1:46:10] life and then then listen when we get
[1:46:13] into these situations then it becomes
[1:46:14] everybody else's
[1:46:16] fault There's No Love in the church
[1:46:19] nobody's coming to my the problem is the
[1:46:22] LIE
[1:46:24] it's a
[1:46:26] lie it's a
[1:46:28] lie believe the truth confess the truth
[1:46:33] say it till you believe
[1:46:35] it say it till it becomes a reality in
[1:46:38] your
[1:46:40] life I want the
[1:46:44] truth this woman who was called a
[1:46:47] witch she walked on a platform
[1:46:50] struggling with whether or not she's a
[1:46:52] witch
[1:46:53] why did they say that what did it mean
[1:46:55] the man has gifts in his life and he
[1:46:57] said that and the church is stirred up
[1:46:58] and whatever is going on you can only
[1:47:00] imagine what was in her mind I don't
[1:47:01] know but you can only imagine if you
[1:47:03] were in her spot what would you be
[1:47:05] thinking ringing her hands coming before
[1:47:07] a prophet and she walks up in despair
[1:47:11] nervous believing she has a heart
[1:47:13] condition in desperate need of
[1:47:16] prayer and guess what she doesn't get
[1:47:19] any
[1:47:21] prayer she doesn't need need
[1:47:23] prayer she doesn't need prayer she needs
[1:47:26] the truth she needs to believe the truth
[1:47:29] she needs to know the truth she needs to
[1:47:31] know that that was a lie and that God
[1:47:33] hasn't changed his mind about her that
[1:47:35] what he thought of her is always still
[1:47:37] the same truth that he ever had and
[1:47:38] she's not a witch and she's fine and
[1:47:40] there's nothing wrong with her heart and
[1:47:42] she walked over there with no prayer but
[1:47:44] she walked over there
[1:47:46] delivered the truth shall make you free
[1:47:50] she got Deliverance where did she get
[1:47:52] Deliverance by the prophet laying hands
[1:47:54] on her by the words that he spoke by the
[1:47:56] prayer she got Deliverance by the truth

[1:48:05] prostitute stuck in bondage had a
[1:48:06] horrible life amen but she gave
[1:48:08] everything to come to Jesus and wash his
[1:48:10] feet and guess what she gave it all and
[1:48:12] washed his feet what was she doing she
[1:48:14] was recognizing that this is the Messiah
[1:48:16] this is the word and she was giving her
[1:48:18] all to the word amen and Jesus looked at
[1:48:21] her and says all your sins are forgiven
[1:48:24] you oh guess what she didn't pray and
[1:48:27] Jesus didn't pray what was her
[1:48:29] Deliverance the truth the truth when she
[1:48:32] came to the truth the truth set her
[1:48:35] free all her sins were forgiven not
[1:48:39] because she prayed three hours not
[1:48:40] because she went to the altar not
[1:48:42] because she went to the temple and made
[1:48:44] a sacrifice not because she paid great
[1:48:46] sums of money and not because Jesus laid
[1:48:48] hands on her and prayed for her he never
[1:48:50] touched her all he did was recognize her
[1:48:52] faith her faith in the truth set her
[1:48:54] free it was the truth that set her
[1:48:59] free remember Jesus he comes by has
[1:49:03] needs to go by

[1:49:18] believed about
[1:49:20] herself I'm I can never be one of I'll
[1:49:22] never be accepted I'm an outcast
[1:49:25] I'm the woman in Samaria she has to come
[1:49:28] to a well at a certain time of day cuz
[1:49:29] she can't come with the other
[1:49:31] women she's an outcast she's no doubt
[1:49:33] have lies of her own I mean she's been
[1:49:36] through five husbands and she's with
[1:49:37] another man that's not her own that
[1:49:39] woman's believing some lies she's in
[1:49:41] bondage she's in tur she's in turmoil
[1:49:44] she's in that's the result of
[1:49:47] Lies but she comes in contact with the
[1:49:50] person of truth and the person of Truth
[1:49:52] to tell her the truth and when he tells
[1:49:54] her the truth woman the hour cometh and
[1:49:56] now is when when the father seeketh such
[1:49:59] as worship Him and spirit and in
[1:50:03] truth it's all he
[1:50:07] said she stood there and thought about
[1:50:11] that she said we know that when
[1:50:13] messiah's cometh he'll tell us these
[1:50:15] things and he said I that speaketh unto
[1:50:18] you am he amen that was the truth

[1:50:51] didn't go to church
[1:50:55] she was saved she was delivered and she
[1:50:57] became a mouthpiece for the Messiah how
[1:51:00] what set her free is when she accepted
[1:51:02] the truth over the LIE it set her free
[1:51:05] and broke the bondage that she was under
[1:51:08] remember zakus zakus amen we know zakus

[1:51:16] tree to see the Lord and the Lord looked
[1:51:18] up and so and said today zakus I'm
[1:51:20] coming to your house and he comes into
[1:51:22] Zak as's house amen and what a
[1:51:24] difference it makes when Jesus comes to
[1:51:26] zaki's house versus Simon's house Simon

[1:51:31] right there and he left him in a corner
[1:51:33] and left him rejected zachus who's not a

[1:52:13] the truth set zakus free the person of
[1:52:16] Truth came to his house and he had the
[1:52:18] ability to stand up and confess his sin
[1:52:21] and expose his sin and that the Bible
[1:52:23] says if you cover your sin it will
[1:52:26] remain it'll destroy you but if you

[1:56:42] free when the church was all bound up by
[1:56:45] Creeds and dogmas and the Holy Ghost was
[1:56:47] bound by these rivers of denomination
[1:56:50] and dogmas
[1:56:52] God was going to come and loose the Holy
[1:56:55] Spirit the spirit of Truth the guide he
[1:56:59] was going to loose the church that was
[1:57:00] bound by Creeds and dogmas and how did
[1:57:03] Jesus come in this generation and loose
[1:57:05] his bride and loose the Holy Ghost he
[1:57:07] did it by bringing the truth he opened
[1:57:11] the seals he sent a prophet to reveal
[1:57:13] the truth to tie back the Loose Ends to
[1:57:15] reveal the mden mystery of God and what
[1:57:17] did the truth do it freed us from the
[1:57:19] denominational strongholds and broke the
[1:57:21] chains that were binding us and keeping
[1:57:23] us down and it set us free how did
[1:57:26] Freedom come in this day by the
[1:57:29] truth how will freedom come to your
[1:57:31] individual circumstance in life by the
[1:57:34] truth it's the truth that will set you
[1:57:38] free brother Benham says I want to read
[1:57:41] this last quote as we close this is out
[1:57:43] of the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:57:45] Christ says now notice the anointed word
[1:57:48] of his day of which you are a part by
[1:57:51] predes destination you immediately like
[1:57:54] knew when you heard that you knew right
[1:57:57] quick that you was an eagle you also

[1:58:07] the beginning all of a sudden a true
[1:58:10] Eagle scream comes and something in you

[1:58:13] truth he says he the bridegroom took
[1:58:15] away your shame and put it in the sea of
[1:58:18] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:58:20] water of the word and the blood of life

[1:58:24] husband that you were married to the
[1:58:26] world the anointed
[1:58:28] bridegroom which for ordained you has
[1:58:30] washed you by the washing of the Water

[1:58:34] that don't sound right does it they say
[1:58:36] no you might find that in the almanac
[1:58:38] but not in God's Bible by the washing of
[1:58:40] the Water by the word in the word see
[1:58:43] you are standing completely Justified as
[1:58:46] though you never did it at the
[1:58:48] beginning what is that that's the truth
[1:58:52] that's what the prophet brought that's
[1:58:53] what God wanted you to hear at this end
[1:58:56] time he wanted you to recognize that
[1:58:58] this true word that he s is a water of
[1:59:01] Separation to separate you from all the
[1:59:04] lies the lies you believed all your life
[1:59:06] the lies your parents told you the lies
[1:59:08] spouses told you the lies others told
[1:59:10] you amen the LIE the denomination told
[1:59:12] you there's a washing of the water of
[1:59:14] the true word that has come to wash all
[1:59:16] the lies off of us to set us free free
[1:59:21] to believe the word free to recognize
[1:59:23] who we are free to move into our
[1:59:25] position we're free by what the truth

[1:59:54] you're unlovable that you're no good and
[1:59:56] nobody wants you if you have a father
[1:59:59] who never knew how to connect to you
[2:00:00] emotionally or abandon the family when
[2:00:02] you were young amen he may never have
[2:00:05] come and said you're
[2:00:07] worthless but you know what you
[2:00:11] believed my own Daddy doesn't want to
[2:00:13] spend time with
[2:00:16] me I've been there not because my dad
[2:00:19] abandoned me but my parents were
[2:00:20] divorced when I was 5 years years old
[2:00:23] and I know those
[2:00:24] things you start to believe

[2:00:51] treated you it dad treated the way mom
[2:00:53] treated you the way somebody else
[2:00:54] treated you and all of a sudden the lie
[2:00:56] that the devil whispered in your heart
[2:00:58] is that you're no good and nobody loves
[2:00:59] you and you're never going to amount to
[2:01:02] anything and you carry that lie like
[2:01:06] Gideon carried his
[2:01:09] lie but oh I've got good
[2:01:12] newsall the truth will still set you
[2:01:14] free you have to accept it you have to
[2:01:17] speak it you have to Proclaim it you
[2:01:19] have to claim it you have to stand on it
[2:01:21] you have to get under it and let it wash
[2:01:23] all the lies out of your heart amen and
[2:01:25] then when those Lies come back listen
[2:01:27] brother brandom in 1963 is struggling
[2:01:30] with lies that he had believed as a
[2:01:32] child being rejected in an outcast his
[2:01:34] father is an alcoholic and all of these
[2:01:36] things set up lies in his heart and now
[2:01:38] when he got under tension and overworked
[2:01:40] and circumstances happened that lie came
[2:01:42] back to him and he started feeling like
[2:01:44] nobody loves me nobody cares but you
[2:01:46] know what he didn't do he didn't say
[2:01:47] nobody loves me nobody cares he says
[2:01:49] that's not the truth it's not the truth
[2:01:51] it's nothing it's nothing true about it
[2:01:53] that's just me that's just my feeling
[2:01:55] but the truth is God loves me the truth
[2:01:58] is his people love me the truth is they
[2:02:00] travel from far and stay up late to come
[2:02:02] here what was he doing he was fighting
[2:02:05] back against the lie not giving into it
[2:02:07] not repeating it not allowing it to be
[2:02:09] truth he was pushing back with the
[2:02:12] truth we have to stop giving ear to the
[2:02:15] lie and stop letting the LIE come out of
[2:02:18] our mouth but we have to take the word
[2:02:20] and push against the lie with the
[2:02:27] truth if those people in that church
[2:02:30] know what kind of life you live before
[2:02:31] you come to church they would never
[2:02:32] accept you
[2:02:34] lie I'm the only one here that's been
[2:02:36] through this I'm the only one here
[2:02:37] that's that's a lie
[2:02:40] too if people really knew what I was
[2:02:43] like
[2:02:45] lie lie lie lie lie
[2:02:49] lie you know what that's all there to do
[2:02:51] it's all called to keep you in bondage
[2:02:53] and depression and separation and
[2:02:57] torment but the truth will set you
[2:03:00] free what truth that I'm accepted in the
[2:03:04] Beloved and if I'm accepted in the
[2:03:06] Beloved everybody else accepted in the
[2:03:08] Beloved is going to accept me because
[2:03:10] what's in me is in
[2:03:12] themall there may be tough circumstances
[2:03:14] we may have to work through a few things
[2:03:16] we we may have to make apologies and
[2:03:18] make things right but it doesn't change
[2:03:19] the truth the truth is you're loved
[2:03:22] you're highly favored amen the angel
[2:03:25] came to Mary and Mary was there amen she
[2:03:27] was just a young girl in a no-name place
[2:03:29] from a no-name uh situation and she was
[2:03:31] going to get married and who knows what
[2:03:33] she's been told all her life she might
[2:03:35] have been told you know you're kind of
[2:03:36] an odd person you're a little different
[2:03:37] her mom might have said you know if you
[2:03:39] would change this and this you know some
[2:03:40] boys might marry
[2:03:42] you I don't know but that's happened to
[2:03:46] people you know what that starts to do
[2:03:48] in people makes a lie I'm not nobody
[2:03:51] wants me
[2:03:52] my mom thinks that I'm not attractive
[2:03:56] and if I did this different that starts
[2:03:59] a lie and a girl starts to believe that
[2:04:01] lie she has to change something about
[2:04:03] her appearance herself Amen to trct
[2:04:05] that's a
[2:04:07] lie who knows what Mary had heard who
[2:04:09] knows what she went through who knows if
[2:04:10] she was rejected not reject rejected but
[2:04:14] something happened when she went to the
[2:04:16] well that day when the angel Gabriel
[2:04:18] came to her he gave her a true
[2:04:20] identification
[2:04:23] he said behold thou highly favored of
[2:04:26] the
[2:04:27] Lord it didn't matter at that moment it
[2:04:30] didn't matter what anybody else had ever
[2:04:33] said about her if it was her mom if it
[2:04:35] was her dad if it was an old boyfriend
[2:04:37] if it was her siblings it did not matter
[2:04:39] anymore because God had called her
[2:04:42] highly
[2:04:43] favored and in the eyes of God she was
[2:04:45] highly favored chosen The Chosen vessel
[2:04:48] of God to bring forth Jesus Christ and
[2:04:50] I'm telling you today there's been an
[2:04:51] angel that has come to you that said
[2:04:53] behold highly favored of the Lord you
[2:04:56] say how do I know it's me because I
[2:04:58] believe it I heard the eagle scream
[2:05:00] something in me said that's nothing but
[2:05:02] the truth it wasn't my emotions it
[2:05:04] wasn't an education amen something in me
[2:05:07] responded to the word and what is that
[2:05:09] it's the Lord saying
[2:05:11] behold thou highly favored of the Lord
[2:05:14] You're The Chosen vessel to bring forth
[2:05:16] Christ in this generation it's you what
[2:05:19] you need to do is let it come out of
[2:05:21] your mouth don't be afraid because of
[2:05:23] the past because rejection because of
[2:05:25] feelings but take the word and say I've
[2:05:28] been chosen before the foundation of the
[2:05:30] world I am part of Christ and he's
[2:05:32] chosen me to manifest himself in this
[2:05:34] same
[2:05:35] time how do you know it I only have one
[2:05:38] indication and that's because I believe
[2:05:41] him that's it I don't have any other
[2:05:44] proof I don't have any other evidence I
[2:05:45] don't have birth records I don't
[2:05:48] have but I have faith
[2:05:52] and if Faith saved zakus and if Faith
[2:05:54] saved the woman at the well and if Faith
[2:05:56] saved the woman who washes feet then
[2:05:59] it's faith that has saved me and
[2:06:02] redeemed me because I've come to the
[2:06:04] same place they came to I came to the
[2:06:07] anointed word made manifest for the day
[2:06:10] and when I came to the living Jesus
[2:06:12] Christ the word for this day and I
[2:06:14] anointed and I washed it I respected and
[2:06:16] I believed it and I confessed my
[2:06:19] sins salvation has come this day
[2:06:23] the truth has set us
[2:06:28] free brother benam
[2:06:31] says we are
[2:06:35] standing I don't care where you feel
[2:06:37] like you're standing today you may feel
[2:06:39] like you're standing on the edge of a
[2:06:41] precipice about to fall you may feel
[2:06:42] like your whole world is getting ready
[2:06:44] to crash down you may feel like
[2:06:46] relationships are collapsing and works
[2:06:48] collapsing Comming you may I don't care
[2:06:50] where you feel like you're standing I'm
[2:06:52] going to tell you where a prophet said
[2:06:54] you're
[2:06:55] standing and I encourage you to believe
[2:06:58] what he
[2:06:59] said because it'll make you stand
[2:07:01] different in this
[2:07:03] day he said you are standing completely
[2:07:07] Justified as though you never did it at
[2:07:09] the
[2:07:11] beginning but what about all those years
[2:07:13] and what about believing the false
[2:07:14] Doctrine and what about when I lived a
[2:07:16] life of pro what about when I lost my
[2:07:18] virginity what you are standing listen
[2:07:21] quit standing on the LIE and start
[2:07:24] standing on the
[2:07:26] truth you are standing completely
[2:07:29] Justified as though you never did it at
[2:07:32] the
[2:07:33] beginning this is my message to the
[2:07:35] church
[2:07:36] now as we go off the
[2:07:41] air why did Brother BM say that because
[2:07:43] he was being recorded it was being
[2:07:44] broadcast on radio but oh it has a
[2:07:47] different meaning to me because there's
[2:07:48] a message that God was going to get to
[2:07:50] the prophet just before before the
[2:07:51] prophet went off the air this is this is
[2:07:54] November 25th of 1965 30 days before his
[2:08:00] accident oh God is
[2:08:03] good he said this is my message to the
[2:08:06] church now as we go off the air just in
[2:08:09] a minute you are standing if you are
[2:08:13] standing on God's word and with God's
[2:08:15] word every amen every jot every tit
[2:08:19] where are you standing I'm trying to
[2:08:22] tell you pull away from those Shucks and
[2:08:24] get out here in the wheat where you can
[2:08:25] get right before the sun I hear the
[2:08:27] coming of the combine you're standing
[2:08:30] complete Justified like you never did it
[2:08:34] in the first place that means if you're
[2:08:36] standing with this word in this word
[2:08:39] upon this word it doesn't matter any of
[2:08:42] the lies from the past they're all lies
[2:08:45] the truth is you're standing Justified
[2:08:48] as if you never did it in the beginning
[2:08:51] why because the power is in the word to
[2:08:53] wash it all away if Jesus could look at
[2:08:55] the woman kneeling at his feet washing
[2:08:57] his feet and says your sins he said
[2:08:59] Simon her sins which are many yes are
[2:09:03] all
[2:09:04] forgiven if he could do it to that woman
[2:09:07] that day why can't he do it to you today
[2:09:09] why can't you come to his feet why can't
[2:09:11] you kiss his feet why can't you pour
[2:09:13] your life out of his feet why can't you
[2:09:15] anoint them amen with the most precious
[2:09:16] thing you got your whole life why can't
[2:09:18] you do that and expect the same results
[2:09:21] you're sin which were many are all
[2:09:23] forgiven you just as if you never did it
[2:09:26] in the first
[2:09:27] place that's what power has been
[2:09:29] Unleashed in this time that's the
[2:09:32] truth everything else is a
[2:09:38] lie oh praise be to
[2:09:41] God he said talk about a Thanksgiving I
[2:09:44] feel real good I'm I'm more thankful for
[2:09:48] that than anything I know of praise God
[2:09:51] you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride
[2:09:55] of the son of the Living God can you say
[2:09:57] that about yourself why because a
[2:10:00] prophet said it about you if you're
[2:10:02] standing with the word on the word every
[2:10:04] amen every jot every TT you might say
[2:10:06] but I don't live it all amen he never
[2:10:08] asked about that he asked whether you
[2:10:10] believed it all you're saved by faith
[2:10:13] you're not saved by Duty by Creed by
[2:10:15] Dogma by Form you're saved by faith and
[2:10:18] when you have faith God supplies the
[2:10:20] spirit to live the word
[2:10:24] you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride
[2:10:28] of the son of the Living God and I know
[2:10:30] there'll be some of you tomorrow will
[2:10:31] say I don't feel like that's true stop
[2:10:34] saying the LIE stop confessing the lie
[2:10:38] you feel like feelings are lies amen
[2:10:41] come to the word to the promise this
[2:10:43] prophet's not just saying something it's
[2:10:45] not a cutesy phrase he's not trying to
[2:10:47] get a reaction out of the people he is
[2:10:49] speaking the truth just before he goes
[2:10:51] off the air he wants to leave this truth
[2:10:53] with the church you are the sinless
[2:10:56] Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[2:10:59] Christ everything that happened before
[2:11:02] is a lie God this word has brought you
[2:11:05] back to your
[2:11:08] position amen every man and woman that's
[2:11:11] born of the spirit of God and washed in
[2:11:13] the blood of Jesus Christ and believes
[2:11:14] every word of God stands as though you
[2:11:17] never sinned at the first place you are
[2:11:19] perfect the blood of Jesus Christ Christ

[2:11:24] completely you never sinned at the first
[2:11:27] place God don't even know it's in the
[2:11:29] sea of forgetfulness you never did it
[2:11:32] you were accused of it by the accuser
