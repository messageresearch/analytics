TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if this seed will only flourish under the light of the age but I continually keep it from the light of the age and keep giving it to Satan's light of the age from the fourth dimension then I'm going to stunt the girls we're not going to get any more potentials out of it it doesn't change the plant it doesn't change the fact it's a Son of God it doesn't change that the potentials are there but you can't you're out of the channel you can't produce the life so we're feeding on entertainment to the world and feeding on things of the world and wrong relationships and wrong conversations and we're not staying under the right atmosphere in the right Channel and then we're wondering why we're struggling to overcome so we're going to try harder but but the trying harder is not going to work can anybody testify trying harder doesn't work praise God I'm glad I'm not all by myself because I tried harder and harder and then harder and harder and harder and the harder I tried the worse I fell so then so then having the the getting out of the channel will stop the growth will stop amen producing the potentials but will not change the plant that's why when you got discouraged and you backslid you never changed that you were a son of God and you may not have been producing any fruit and all of the leaves might have been falling off and your limbs might have been wilting down but in the root you were still Son of God and you couldn't change it because you didn't start it you didn't decide it you didn't choose it it was predestinated in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and you may be dried up and wilted and all your leaves laying down the fruits long gone the bark starting to come off but it doesn't change what you are and if you will just get in the fresh water of the word and under this bright August sunlight amen you'll find that the health will come back to the plant it'll spring back up again the limbs will raise up it'll put forth leaves buds flowers and then fruits but you're not going to do it in the wrong Channel trying to I'll get better and then come back you can't do it amen amen but the seed inside has all the potential to be everything he predestinated it to be so what do I do stay in the channel
