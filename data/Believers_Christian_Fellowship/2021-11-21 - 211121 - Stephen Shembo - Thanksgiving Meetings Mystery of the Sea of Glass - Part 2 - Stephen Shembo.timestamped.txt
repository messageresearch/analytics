[7:07] home this is my second home
[7:10] amen
[7:11] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[7:13] go straight to the word
[7:17] someone mentioned to me yesterday don't
[7:19] take too long to take off the airport
[7:37] you know i was uh
[7:38] when i was praying
[7:40] i mentioned about the 49 straps
[7:45] that jesus had on his back
[7:47] he was actually 39.
[7:50] have you heard about it before
[7:52] what branham said he had 39 straps
[7:56] which is 39 major disease
[7:59] that was on his back you need the quote
[8:01] you see me after church
[8:05] have you heard that before
[8:07] yes
[8:08] and i was wondering where did he get it
[8:10] then paul say i was whipped by the jews
[8:14] 40-1
[8:16] carrying the mark of christ
[8:18] the message is perfectly
[8:21] in order with the scripture
[8:22] you have not found it yet just chill out
[8:27] let's go in exodus chapter 19
[8:30] the first five
[8:35] if you're there you can say amen
[8:38] the bible says now therefore
[8:41] if you will obey my voice
[8:44] indeed
[8:45] and keep my covenant
[8:47] then you shall have a you shall be a
[8:50] peculiar treasure
[8:52] to me above all people
[8:55] for all the earth is mine
[8:57] god is talking to the jew
[8:59] and he's bringing this great great
[9:02] promise
[9:04] to the jew like this is what i have for
[9:06] you if you just obey what i'm telling
[9:08] you you're going to be a peculiar nation
[9:10] a peculiar treasure above all the people
[9:13] in other words you're going to be the
[9:14] top
[9:15] of everybody
[9:17] presented to the jew amen
[9:19] you might be seated verse 6. and you
[9:22] shall be to me a kingdom
[9:25] of priest
[9:29] it was given to the jew
[9:32] they just didn't know how to manage it
[9:35] they slip out of the hand
[9:37] and somebody else who was unworthy
[9:40] have to get it
[9:42] amen
[9:44] and you shall be to me
[9:46] a kingdom of priest
[9:49] and a holy nation
[9:52] these are the words which you shall
[9:54] speak
[9:55] to the children of israel so the promise
[9:59] to be
[10:00] a nation of priests was given to israel
[10:04] first
[10:06] that was what god told them you do this
[10:09] your whole kingdom not only the levat
[10:12] so the heart of god was that the entire
[10:16] nation of israel
[10:19] become priests
[10:21] he used the levat as a wave shift
[10:27] i hope that is creaking
[10:29] he used them as an example to show
[10:32] israel this is what i want to do to you
[10:35] i want all of you to be like this
[10:38] so i'm pulling one out of you and i'm
[10:41] working through him so you will
[10:43] understand what i'm trying to make
[10:45] everybody in this nation be i want you
[10:49] all to be like them
[10:51] amen
[10:53] so you're more privileged because you're
[10:55] receiving part two
[10:57] the church only have part one except if
[11:00] somebody's not in church and he slip up
[11:02] and he's snaking somewhere then he's
[11:04] gonna be part of party amen
[11:07] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[11:09] to isaiah 61.
[11:11] there is a promise
[11:14] given to israel god wants them all
[11:18] to be priests everybody
[11:21] not only the levite
[11:22] but the entire nation of israel
[11:26] the levite paul mentioned liver
[11:29] when god was pulling the tent
[11:34] in other words the wave shift he was
[11:36] pulling that tenth out then the mansion
[11:38] liver but leave i was not the only one
[11:41] in the launch of abraham
[11:44] all of them were there
[11:46] god has to pull that wave shift out
[11:50] of leave and say this is what i want to
[11:51] do
[11:52] if you
[11:53] can continue on my way and do what i'm
[11:55] telling you that's my vision
[11:58] that's my mind for you amen
[12:01] isaiah 61 verse 6 if you're there you
[12:04] can say amen
[12:06] but
[12:07] you shall be named the priest of the
[12:10] lord
[12:12] men shall call you the ministers of our
[12:15] god
[12:17] you shall eat the riches of the gentiles
[12:21] and in their glory shall you boast
[12:23] yourself
[12:24] so the gentiles had some riches
[12:27] but those witches were natural
[12:30] so god told them you shall be the priest
[12:33] and you shall eat the riches of the
[12:35] gentiles but the jews also have some
[12:38] riches
[12:40] and their which
[12:42] their wealth
[12:44] was not really natural
[12:46] it was a spiritual wealth and we the
[12:49] dentist were outside
[12:51] so now when you flip everything back we
[12:53] the one going to israel to get the
[12:56] riches of israel
[12:57] instead of israel you're going to get
[12:59] the riches of the gender
[13:01] i hope you're getting that
[13:03] but you shall be named the priest of the
[13:06] lord verse 6 again
[13:08] man shall call you the minister of our
[13:10] god you shall eat the riches of the
[13:13] gentiles and in their glory shall you
[13:15] boast yourself
[13:17] again god is insisting i want you all to
[13:20] be priest i want you to be named priest
[13:24] now let's go to the book of revelation
[13:30] we know what happened
[13:33] he came down
[13:35] he came to his own
[13:37] and his own did not receive him
[13:41] determined back
[13:43] paul
[13:44] got that anointing and tried to go among
[13:46] the jews he tried he bothered he
[13:48] bothered after a while paul said no no
[13:50] no no it's too late i need to turn
[13:52] around and go straight to the gentile so
[13:55] that was passed completely to the
[13:57] gentile and the jews never became his
[14:00] priest
[14:01] let's see what happened to the gentile
[14:03] revelation chapter 1 verse 5. if you're
[14:06] there you can say amen
[14:08] and from jesus
[14:10] who is the fateful witness
[14:13] and the first begotten of the dead and
[14:16] the prince of the kings of the earth
[14:18] to him that loved us
[14:21] and washed us
[14:24] brother branham said that very word
[14:26] means to loose
[14:28] amen
[14:28] and washed us from our sins in his own
[14:32] blood
[14:33] and has made us water
[14:38] now there is a second revelation that
[14:40] comes out
[14:42] he his liver
[14:44] liver
[14:45] when in genesis chapter 49 when god was
[14:49] blessing israel
[14:52] uh when jacob was blessing israel he was
[14:55] going one by one one by one one by one
[14:58] he never even mentioned the priesthood
[15:00] in liver
[15:03] because he was mad at liver
[15:05] liver went and killed the whole city
[15:08] of the people that were circumcised
[15:10] because somebody took donna and uh
[15:14] and uh forced her
[15:17] and tried to make things right and liva
[15:18] and simeon were so angry so they put a
[15:21] trap on them they say you all male get
[15:23] circumstance
[15:25] they say okay we're going to be part of
[15:26] israel when the gaster comes out leave
[15:28] and simeon pulled the sword
[15:30] and probably was liver who pulled the
[15:32] sword first
[15:34] he said simeon let's go ahead and get
[15:36] them
[15:37] so they went and wiped the entire city
[15:40] completely and jacob was angry and when
[15:43] he looked at liver he said in liver
[15:45] there is an instrument of cruelty
[15:48] but level was the fourth one after
[15:50] abraham
[15:51] because abraham begat isaac
[15:54] and isaac begat jacob
[15:56] and jacob begat to
[15:58] leave her
[16:00] right
[16:02] let's be the name of the lord i'm just
[16:04] stretching you up
[16:08] out of the church ages came the season
[16:11] out of the seals came the trumpet
[16:14] and out of the trumpet comes the vow the
[16:16] fourth one will bring judgment
[16:22] so when he came and he began to bless
[16:25] his children
[16:26] he looked at judah he said
[16:28] judah the kings are going to come from
[16:31] you
[16:32] so when he told israel he said i want
[16:34] you all to be priests they were looking
[16:37] at the tribe of liver so we're going to
[16:38] be like the tribe of liver but in the
[16:40] book of revelation he pulled another
[16:43] thing he said they're going to be king
[16:46] i thought it's only priest now king so
[16:50] are you going to take levi and judah put
[16:52] them together
[16:55] let's see
[16:57] verse 6 and he has made us kings
[17:00] and priests
[17:03] so not only are we priests
[17:05] now we are king and priest why king and
[17:09] priest
[17:11] why not just priests
[17:15] amen
[17:16] he had made us king
[17:18] and preached to god
[17:20] for he and and his father
[17:22] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[17:26] ever amen
[17:29] let's go to revelation 5 and we'll pray
[17:36] i want the nation of israel to be
[17:37] priests
[17:39] i want you all to be named priest israel
[17:41] rejected i'm moving to the gentile when
[17:44] i'm moving to the gentile wait a minute
[17:46] i want you to be priests and kings
[17:51] not just priests
[17:53] revelation 5
[17:55] verse
[17:56] 9 if you're there you can say amen
[17:59] this is the lamb came you know the story
[18:01] pick up the book when he picked up the
[18:03] book the whole
[18:05] heaven was on fire
[18:07] because somebody was found worthy to
[18:09] come take the book and break the seals
[18:12] so when it was the silt time everything
[18:14] changed in heaven
[18:17] amen
[18:18] revelation 7 only hide what was going on
[18:22] because the devil cannot catch it
[18:25] amen
[18:26] verse 9 and then they sung a new song
[18:30] saying you are worthy
[18:32] to take the book
[18:34] and to open the seals thereof
[18:37] this is in heaven
[18:38] for you are slain
[18:41] and have redeemers to god
[18:43] buy your blood out of every kindred i
[18:47] thought he was the jews only
[18:50] now it's no longer the jews it's every
[18:53] kindred
[18:54] out of every kindred
[18:56] and tongue
[18:58] and people and
[19:00] nation
[19:01] so what started in israel now it's going
[19:04] worldwide
[19:06] amen
[19:07] verse 10 and have made us to god to our
[19:10] god kings and water
[19:13] so at the breaking the losing of the
[19:16] seal that revelation unfolded again that
[19:20] i am looking for a nation of king and
[19:24] priest i am back again
[19:26] when they break the seals then the
[19:28] revelation comes
[19:30] those that were there caught it they say
[19:32] wait a minute
[19:33] this is what was all about so you want
[19:35] us to be king and priest so the opening
[19:39] of the seal must bring you to that
[19:43] the opening of the seventh seal must
[19:46] make you king
[19:47] and priest
[19:49] not just priests you must be king and
[19:52] priest
[19:56] oh this opening of the seals verse 10
[19:58] and have made
[20:00] us to our god
[20:02] king and priest and we shall reign on
[20:05] the earth
[20:08] so this seal
[20:10] when he open up
[20:12] there is more to it
[20:14] it goes from one thing like an explosion
[20:17] then another explosion then another
[20:19] explosion then another explosion
[20:22] why do you want me to be king
[20:24] god wants you to reign with him
[20:28] why do you want me to be priest
[20:30] why not just priest you taught israel
[20:32] priest and you hide the king because in
[20:34] israel he split them and he was quiet
[20:38] and the devil said uh-huh i know who's
[20:40] responsible for spiritual things let me
[20:42] attack lever
[20:46] and he hid the king
[20:48] he didn't know
[20:50] that the true king the true priest have
[20:52] to come through the king
[20:57] amen
[20:58] you are in the world you were drinking
[21:00] smoking why didn't the devil kill you
[21:05] you were in his kingdom
[21:07] working for him
[21:08] why he didn't kill you
[21:11] he didn't know
[21:12] who you
[21:14] were he thought you belong to him
[21:18] you were hidden under the seventh seal
[21:21] that's why pharaoh can take moses and
[21:24] nurture moses not even knowing that he
[21:27] is he's breathing the very weapon that's
[21:30] going to destroy him
[21:33] and when moses is unfolded it's too late
[21:37] he becomes a hot potato you can't touch
[21:40] him no more one man invasion and brought
[21:43] the whole truck the whole egypt down
[21:46] just one man when he understood who he
[21:49] was
[21:50] [Applause]
[21:52] [Music]
[21:54] so if you never get me when i was in the
[21:56] hospital
[21:57] after drinking and passing out
[21:59] how can you get me now
[22:00] [Applause]
[22:04] what is coffee
[22:07] what is sickness
[22:08] you're just wasting your time
[22:10] you should have gotten me there over
[22:12] there
[22:14] when i was not even praying
[22:16] but my life while yet we were sinners
[22:20] somebody already died for you
[22:25] not when you become christian when you
[22:27] were sinner because that lamb was slain
[22:31] before the foundation of the world
[22:34] before you were even born i knew you
[22:37] i have predestinated you i know
[22:40] everything about you
[22:42] [Applause]
[22:46] oh my god
[22:48] praise be the name of the lord i told
[22:50] the folks back home i say when michael
[22:53] angelo we're already up
[22:56] did you feel that
[22:57] the airplane is already up we have not
[22:59] even prayed yet
[23:01] ever here i told the folks back home i
[23:04] said when michelangelo
[23:06] first must have the vision of moses
[23:10] in his mind
[23:11] but moses was somewhere
[23:16] he had the vision of moses
[23:18] he saw moses already but moses was
[23:21] hidden somewhere
[23:23] so michelangelo went
[23:26] going around
[23:27] and he see a bunch of stone
[23:29] laying there
[23:31] but one of the stone got
[23:34] moses if michelangelo called you and
[23:37] said moses is there you can look around
[23:40] you say where is moses i don't see moses
[23:43] which stone is moses
[23:45] so michelangelo can tell the whole world
[23:48] that i found 20 hundred stone here and
[23:52] all of you and among all of them moses
[23:54] is here
[23:55] and the devil will begin to shoot one by
[23:57] one bring the helmet in the first one
[24:00] i don't see moses the next one boom
[24:02] that's what he did at the birth of jesus
[24:04] christ
[24:07] they told him that the messiah is born
[24:09] oh how old is he two years bring out the
[24:11] baby two years we begin to slay them
[24:14] they didn't understand that does that
[24:16] still slip jesus out
[24:18] because prophecy was already spoken
[24:21] that i'm gonna take my son to egypt
[24:24] the devil missed that one
[24:28] so when michelangelo said moses is
[24:30] somewhere there you say where is moses
[24:32] he said don't worry
[24:34] i'm going to show you moses you say oh
[24:36] okay i'm excited this man is crazy
[24:39] let me see moses he's saying moses is
[24:41] there i want to see moses call the news
[24:43] michelangelo say praise the lord put
[24:45] them 24 hours
[24:48] he walked around there and he pick up a
[24:50] stone they say is that moses he said yes
[24:53] that's moses
[24:54] where is moses he said don't worry i'll
[24:56] show you moses
[24:58] and he brought the stone say this is
[24:59] moses
[25:03] where is moses he's hidden
[25:05] moses is sealed
[25:09] so michelangelo put the stone
[25:11] and begin to chip the stone away
[25:15] everybody here
[25:17] what what was the chipping about
[25:20] is not really molding moses
[25:24] moses was already there
[25:26] the chipping was to take everything that
[25:29] is not moses away from moses
[25:32] [Applause]
[25:34] so what was coming out was not part of
[25:36] moses
[25:38] so the chipping of the world of the
[25:41] entire message is not really chipping
[25:44] you off
[25:45] it's only removing that which doesn't
[25:47] belong to you
[25:50] we came in this world with a lot of
[25:52] stuff
[25:53] and all the world is doing is just
[25:55] watching away what doesn't belong to you
[25:58] and little by little the people begin to
[26:00] look they say yes i see his eye
[26:03] and after a while he saw moses appear he
[26:05] said wow how did you know moses was here
[26:08] he got anointed himself he took a hammer
[26:11] and hit moses and said now do what
[26:14] [Music]
[26:15] [Applause]
[26:18] amen
[26:20] that's the spoken word
[26:22] the power of the spoken word because his
[26:25] image was reflected
[26:27] so you don't have to worry about it just
[26:29] lay in the presence of the sun
[26:32] let him take the chipping away it is not
[26:34] you you thought it was part of you
[26:37] it is not you i told somebody i told the
[26:39] folks back home i said you're struggling
[26:41] bring that demon here

[27:29] [Music]
[27:33] now i don't know which direction

[27:39] [Applause]

[27:43] everybody good so keep your seat belt as
[27:45] i'm climbing
[27:46] let's pray
[27:48] heavenly father
[27:50] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[27:52] this morning father thanking you for
[27:54] your grace your love your mercy and for
[27:57] everything you have been doing for us
[27:59] lord we are reporting lord father in our
[28:02] place where we think
[28:04] when we talk where we can share the
[28:07] things of eternal life lord father we
[28:09] thank you for everybody that is gathered
[28:11] this morning and even those that are
[28:13] streaming lord father we are committing
[28:16] this entire service unto the hand may
[28:18] you be the beginning and the end be the
[28:21] alpha and the omega father may you move
[28:23] me completely out of the way may you
[28:25] speak to your children and bless us this
[28:27] morning we commit everything unto the
[28:30] hand in the name of jesus christ
[28:33] amen
[28:34] thank you as you already been seated
[28:37] so let's relax we on the mystery of the
[28:39] sea of glass
[28:41] part two you already know what a mystery
[28:43] is you already know why we ain't uh we
[28:46] tattled this the mystery so we're gonna
[28:48] deal more with the priest right there
[28:50] amen
[28:52] so we talked yesterday just a little
[28:54] recap
[28:55] that god told moses to duplicate
[28:58] the tabernacle in heaven on the earth
[29:03] and when moses did it not only did he
[29:06] duplicate the tabernacle on the earth
[29:08] but he also duplicated the priesthood
[29:11] that was in heaven on the earth
[29:14] everybody clear so far and then we got
[29:16] to a point where we were dealing
[29:18] specifically with the sea of glass
[29:21] and when we dealt with the sea of glass
[29:23] we found out that there were two faints
[29:25] that were connected to the sea of glass
[29:27] one of them is the sea of glass was
[29:30] responsible for the washing of the
[29:32] priest
[29:33] before they enter into the tabernacle
[29:35] they have to wash their hand and they
[29:37] have to wash their feet and brother
[29:39] branham brought another element which is
[29:41] in a scripture but that is down the road
[29:43] and brother branham said that they were
[29:45] also the washing of the sacrifice so
[29:48] yesterday we stopped at exodus 40 where
[29:52] the bible says this that god told moses
[29:55] he said that shall anoint the liver and
[29:58] his foot
[29:59] and sanctify it and that shall bring
[30:02] aaron and his son the high priest and
[30:04] his son unto the door of the tabernacle
[30:06] of the congregation and wash them with
[30:09] water everybody so far
[30:12] if you notice moses was the one washing
[30:15] the priest
[30:16] but nobody watched moses
[30:21] amen and we gave you moses
[30:23] characteristic yesterday he was a major
[30:26] prophet
[30:27] he was a high caliber prophet he was a
[30:30] levat he was a priest himself his mother
[30:35] and his father
[30:36] was a priest those were the
[30:38] qualification
[30:39] of the man of the hour that have to
[30:42] introduce the first high priest under
[30:45] the order of liver everybody here so far
[30:48] and the bible said that that shall not
[30:50] put
[30:51] that shall put upon aaron the holy
[30:54] garment so first of all you wash the
[30:56] high priest then you dress him and then
[30:58] you anoint him and sanctify him or
[31:01] consecrate him that he may minister unto
[31:04] me in the priest office so we have steps
[31:08] here please be the name of the lord
[31:11] when this high priest comes
[31:13] number one
[31:15] the high priest have to be washed
[31:17] everybody
[31:19] after he's washed they gotta dress him
[31:21] with a holy garment not any kind of
[31:24] garment it must be a holy government
[31:27] when he's when they are washed they must
[31:29] be anointed
[31:32] clear
[31:33] if i can go this is step one step two
[31:36] step three and step four once the
[31:39] anointed once they are anointed then
[31:42] they can enter into their ministry
[31:46] everybody clear
[31:48] into their ministry
[31:50] without this process
[31:51] no more you can enter there and the
[31:54] fifth one once they already washed
[31:56] they are dressed
[31:58] they are anointed they start their
[32:00] ministry then they will have to come
[32:02] back over and over as they go into the
[32:05] sanctuary to wash their hands
[32:08] and their feet
[32:10] everybody clear so far
[32:12] so when we look here the bible says that
[32:15] that shall bring his son and clothe them
[32:18] with coat and that shall anoint them as
[32:20] that did anoint their father so the
[32:22] anointing on the family of the high
[32:25] priest was the same anointing on the
[32:27] high priest himself only there was a
[32:29] different level because the other one
[32:31] were wearing caught but the high priest
[32:34] must have the euromen tandem on him he
[32:36] must carry the entire forward
[32:42] the entire full world must be carried by
[32:46] the high priest alone
[32:48] but the children of the high priest have
[32:50] also caught
[32:52] but their court have not the entire
[32:54] footwork
[32:56] amen
[32:57] the bible continues
[32:59] that that shall anoint them as they did
[33:03] anoint
[33:04] and anoint their father that they may
[33:06] minister unto me in the priest office
[33:09] for their anointing shall surely be an
[33:12] everlasting priesthood amen and we know
[33:15] that priesthood could not be everlasting
[33:17] because he was only a replica he was
[33:20] only a shadow he was only a duplicate of
[33:23] the true priesthood that was going on in
[33:26] heaven because we found out under isaiah
[33:29] that even though somebody might be
[33:31] cleansed in the temple but otherwise
[33:33] once they enter the presence of the lord
[33:36] still they found themselves unclean
[33:38] showing that the law could not bring
[33:41] anybody into perfection we found the
[33:43] high priest joshua himself when he stood
[33:46] before the angel of the lord when he
[33:48] stood before the angel of the lord as a
[33:51] high priest he was already washed as a
[33:53] high priest he was already consecrated
[33:55] as a high priest he was already anointed
[33:58] but yet in the presence of the angel of
[34:00] the lord joshua appeared with filthy
[34:03] government showing that that was not
[34:06] enough to bring that worshiper all the
[34:08] way to perfection so we needed another
[34:12] priesthood
[34:13] we needed something that is higher
[34:15] that's gonna take care not only not only
[34:18] on the physical part here but he must
[34:21] take care of you on the spiritual part
[34:24] until you have boldness
[34:26] to enter the throne of god
[34:29] without even be under condemnation
[34:32] because there is no more condemnation
[34:35] for those who are in who
[34:38] everybody clear so we need a higher
[34:40] priest
[34:41] and that priest was melchizedek but
[34:44] melchizedek was not a man melchizedek
[34:47] was a theophany so melchizedek have to
[34:50] be made flesh which went to you
[34:51] yesterday and when he made him when he
[34:54] was made flesh he became jesus christ
[34:57] that's why brother branham said
[34:58] melchizedek became jesus christ
[35:02] the word was made flesh and in jesus
[35:05] christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[35:08] badly everybody clear so far
[35:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[35:13] brother branham says this he said that's
[35:15] all he asked bring your burden to the
[35:17] lord and do what
[35:19] leave it there just leave it there why
[35:22] here is our high priest
[35:24] standing here that knows how you feel
[35:27] and he knows how to reconcile you back
[35:29] to grace
[35:30] and how to bring you back to your health
[35:32] he knows all about it he suffered when
[35:35] you have not got a place to lay your
[35:37] head he had the same
[35:39] when you got one change of clothes he
[35:41] had the same when you are made fun of it
[35:44] persecuted he had the same
[35:46] so let's go where we stop on hebrew
[35:48] chapter 2.
[35:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[35:53] hebrews chapter 2
[35:55] if you dare you can say amen
[35:59] the bible says this two pages turning
[36:05] we're almost gonna get the altitude
[36:08] so almost you're gonna feel like the
[36:09] plane is now straight
[36:11] so you can unbuckle
[36:12] everybody
[36:15] amen
[36:17] hebrew chapter 2 verse 9 the bible say
[36:20] but we see jesus
[36:22] who was made a little lower than the
[36:25] angels
[36:26] for the suffering of death
[36:28] ever clear
[36:30] clown with glory and honor he must be
[36:33] god
[36:34] not just a high priest he must be god
[36:37] that he by the grace of god should test
[36:40] death for every man not the jews only
[36:44] job two verse 11 for both he that
[36:47] sanctifies
[36:49] and they who are sanctified
[36:52] are all water so this high priest
[36:57] we and him we are one
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:03] so he is not somebody that is different
[37:06] than me
[37:08] if we are one
[37:10] he cannot be complete without me
[37:15] if you see him you don't see me he is
[37:18] not complete yet
[37:19] there is a part of him that is missing
[37:24] anybody clear
[37:26] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[37:28] call them water
[37:30] oh now he's my brother i thought he was
[37:32] my god
[37:35] i thought he's somebody that i must feel
[37:38] and say this is god i'm a human being
[37:40] paul said no no when you meet him you
[37:42] say
[37:43] god bless you my brother
[37:45] how are you doing
[37:50] have you seen a wife
[37:52] being scared to hug her husband
[37:55] something is wrong
[37:57] you will see her sitting beside her
[37:59] husband and she does this
[38:01] without any question
[38:07] hallelujah
[38:09] job to verse 14
[38:11] for as much then
[38:13] as the
[38:14] children number one we are all one not
[38:18] only are we one he is also my brother
[38:22] and not only am i his brother i am also
[38:25] his child
[38:27] we are one
[38:29] who can be one
[38:31] one means a wife and a husband they are
[38:35] it's speaking about relationship of
[38:37] husband and wife
[38:38] and not only that he's a brother a
[38:40] second relationship not only that we are
[38:43] his children so you can approach him in
[38:46] different offices the way you want him
[38:48] he can be approached as son of david
[38:51] or son of god you just need to know who
[38:53] you are
[38:54] if you
[38:55] understand that you're the bride you
[38:57] need to approach him as me and you we
[38:59] are one
[39:01] if you still struggle you say he's my
[39:03] brother that's fine you can still use
[39:05] that avenue
[39:06] if you're still a little bit a child
[39:08] you're just born again you say heavenly
[39:10] father he said fine i can talk to you
[39:12] about it but if you grow up a little bit
[39:14] you will understand that me and you are
[39:17] one
[39:20] hallelujah
[39:22] blessed be the name of the lord for as
[39:24] much then as the children
[39:27] partaking of flesh and blood
[39:30] because we became human
[39:33] ever clear
[39:35] he also himself
[39:38] likewise took part of the water
[39:42] we became human he said no
[39:44] this is part of me is human i cannot
[39:47] stay like this i'm going to be human too
[39:49] and he get into a human
[39:52] body and he begin to walk hey but here
[39:55] through death
[39:57] he might destroy him that has the power
[39:59] of death that is the devil
[40:02] and delivered them his children who
[40:05] through fear of death where all their
[40:08] lifetime subject to bondage
[40:11] for verily he took note on him the
[40:15] nature of angel because he will not
[40:16] understand us
[40:19] we are one with him
[40:21] and he said but he took on him the seed
[40:23] of water
[40:25] abraham who is the father of her faith
[40:29] god blessed abraham there before the
[40:32] jewish nation so that the gentile can be
[40:35] represented there
[40:37] if he did it through the jewish nation
[40:39] then we are completely outside so he put
[40:41] it on abraham when you ask abraham
[40:44] abraham was not a jew
[40:47] he was a friend of god
[40:53] the bible continues on verse 17 he said
[40:55] wherefore in all things
[40:58] he behoove him to be made like unto his
[41:02] he must be like me anybody clear
[41:05] that he might be the
[41:07] what is the purpose of this that he
[41:10] might be a merciful
[41:12] and faithful water
[41:15] in things pertaining to god to make
[41:18] reconciliation for the sin of the people
[41:21] that's the purpose that melchizedek must
[41:24] be flesh he must understand me
[41:28] everybody
[41:29] i bypass my triophane
[41:32] but he doesn't understand so he must be
[41:34] flesh so he understand me better so we
[41:37] can talk the same language about here
[41:40] verse 18 for in him for in that
[41:44] he himself has suffered being tempted
[41:47] he's able to secure them that are water
[41:51] so now when you tempted he understands
[41:53] you completely say i was there
[41:55] i know what's going on
[41:57] when my child is tempted no no no no
[41:59] don't worry about it i was there it's a
[42:00] very bad thing i was there i was tempted
[42:03] to he began to understand
[42:05] amen
[42:06] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[42:08] to hebrew fold
[42:11] you can take off your seat belt
[42:15] hebrew 4 verse 15 amen
[42:18] for we have not a high priest
[42:21] which cannot be touched
[42:23] with the feeling of our worker
[42:26] melchizedek was there
[42:29] when we have pain melchizedek doesn't
[42:31] understand
[42:32] our pain
[42:34] so the bible says no no no no he must
[42:36] become flesh
[42:38] and suffer what we suffer when he goes
[42:40] there when i'm here when i'm going
[42:43] through my trouble in life when i say
[42:46] 9-1-1-1 9-1-1 how are you doing over
[42:49] there i'm doing fine i'm hurting right
[42:51] here he said yes i understand let's send
[42:53] the paramedic quickly
[42:57] not 9-1-1 they ask you are you okay so
[42:59] which neighborhood i said no no no no
[43:01] you don't have to worry i've been there
[43:03] i was there
[43:05] amen
[43:06] because when they took the three hebrew
[43:08] children they put them on the fire he
[43:11] was sitting there one wood came he said
[43:13] i want to go there he said don't do that
[43:16] these are my children
[43:17] when it comes to my children i don't
[43:19] want nobody to interfere i'm going to go
[43:22] myself right there and when he jumped
[43:25] there all he did he took the heat out of
[43:27] the fire he said this demon that was
[43:29] bothering you go ahead and walk on it
[43:32] go ahead and walk on it laugh at him
[43:36] how can you laugh to the fire
[43:38] hallelujah amen the bible says that so
[43:43] we have not a high priest which cannot
[43:46] be touched with the feeling of our
[43:47] infirmities but was in some point
[43:52] thank you somebody's not sleeping was in
[43:55] all point
[43:56] so there is nothing that can happen to
[43:59] you
[44:00] that he doesn't understand
[44:03] anybody here there is no trial
[44:06] there is no difficulty you cannot sit
[44:08] down and say everybody don't understand
[44:10] me i never you don't understand me i was
[44:13] always horrible i was abused there is
[44:16] nothing that can come in your life that
[44:18] this high priest doesn't understand
[44:21] because the old high priest have to keep
[44:23] themselves pure
[44:26] so when do you you you come and you tell
[44:28] them that i was smoking weed they don't
[44:30] understand
[44:31] but this one
[44:33] you can under you can you can be
[44:35] confident to talk to him
[44:37] even defense that you don't want to talk
[44:39] to anybody because you're ashamed you
[44:42] can come to this high priest you can
[44:44] expose it you can unfold it he
[44:47] understands you perfectly just as he
[44:50] himself was there because he bore your
[44:52] sin
[44:53] he took your sin upon him while he was
[44:56] going on cavalry he was feeling smoking
[45:00] he was feeling addiction he was feeling
[45:02] abused he was feeling all the passive
[45:05] the present sin and the future sin all
[45:08] of those sin were gathered into him
[45:12] that's why heaven could not contain him
[45:16] they say you know what he's not a
[45:18] candidate to come here because what he
[45:20] carries too much filthiness
[45:23] he need to go to hell
[45:24] did he sin no he never done anything so
[45:27] why is he going to hell if he died he
[45:28] need to come to heaven no no no the
[45:30] cargo he's loaded with cannot come here
[45:34] and the devil said praise the lord i got
[45:36] him now
[45:37] he didn't understand what god was doing
[45:40] it was impossible for god to go to hell
[45:43] so god must be a sinner to load the
[45:46] weapon
[45:47] and he can take the weapon to her when
[45:49] he unfolded it's the theophany it's my
[45:52] teacher now i'm back in hell let's deal
[45:55] me and you face-to-face
[45:57] the devil never understand god
[46:01] how can you take the king of glory and
[46:03] put him in hell it's a filthy place he
[46:06] say i know how to take him
[46:08] make him a sinner
[46:10] if he dies he's going to go to hell but
[46:12] when he's going what is really going to
[46:14] help he's a weapon he's melchizedek

[47:10] the one in the lion's den everybody saw
[47:13] him according to the personal revelation
[47:16] because we and him are one
[47:19] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:26] let's go to verse 16. let us therefore
[47:28] come boldly to the throne of water
[47:32] we are no more under the law
[47:34] where they say if an animal touched the
[47:37] him
[47:37] no when you come both do you know what
[47:39] he means broadly
[47:40] have you seen police officer when they
[47:42] come
[47:43] have you seen them they don't walk like
[47:45] this
[47:46] they have their chest up
[47:50] that's how you go to heaven when you get
[47:52] there you say wait
[47:53] make way to the king
[47:58] you will understand who you are
[48:00] don't worry let us therefore come bodily
[48:04] to the throne of grace
[48:06] that we may obtain water
[48:08] because the law came through moses but
[48:11] grace and truth came through
[48:13] jesus christ that we may obtain mercy
[48:16] and find grace to help in time of what
[48:21] so when you're in need now you
[48:22] understand who to call you understand
[48:24] who's there 9-1-1 you know that if
[48:27] something ever happened to you at work
[48:29] you don't have to worry there's somebody
[48:31] that always got everything under control
[48:35] just call 911. you say i have a problem
[48:37] with my boss he understand it
[48:40] because he was tempted in all points
[48:42] ever clear so far
[48:44] blessed be the name of the lord and the
[48:46] bible also said yesterday
[48:49] that he was the
[48:50] the high priest must understand the
[48:53] ignorance of the people
[48:56] but who was ignorant the jew
[48:59] i thought that you knew the law
[49:01] he must understand the ignorance of the
[49:03] people and those that are out of the way
[49:06] were the jew out of the way
[49:09] because the bible says salvation is of
[49:11] the jew
[49:12] so who was out of the way who was really
[49:15] ignorant
[49:16] that the high priest should understand
[49:17] him
[49:19] let's go to acts chapter 14.
[49:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[49:27] if i lose you you raise your hand
[49:31] then i repeat it again
[49:35] amen
[49:37] act chapter 14 verse 14.
[49:44] if you dare you can say amen
[49:46] act 14 14
[49:49] the bible say
[49:50] when a witch went their apostle
[49:53] paul and barnabas paul healed somebody
[49:56] and the whole city came to power they
[49:58] begin to worship him they say where we
[50:00] do we see god now in human flesh
[50:03] now when they did that which one the
[50:06] apostle barnabas and paul heard of it
[50:09] they rent their clothes and running
[50:12] among the people crying out and saying
[50:15] sir why do you do this thing
[50:18] why do you do this thing in other words
[50:19] why do you do this thing we human
[50:21] stop doing that
[50:24] we also a man of like passion
[50:27] elijah was a man of like passion we are
[50:30] man of light passion with you and
[50:33] preached to you that you should turn
[50:35] from this vanity
[50:37] to the living god which made heaven and
[50:40] earth and the sea and all things that
[50:43] are doing
[50:44] who in time passed
[50:46] do you get it
[50:48] permitted all nation
[50:51] to walk in their own way
[50:55] in time past he was quiet
[50:57] i'm dealing with the jew let them do
[50:59] what they want to do
[51:00] everybody clear go to acts 17
[51:04] because the high priest must understand
[51:06] that he the the ignorant and those that
[51:09] are out of the way
[51:12] act chapter 17
[51:14] verse 24 if you're there you can hallow
[51:16] amen
[51:17] the bible says
[51:19] go back to verse
[51:21] 16 so it makes sense
[51:24] the bible says now while paul waited for
[51:27] them at athens
[51:30] i believe he was in greece
[51:32] his spirit was stirred
[51:35] in him when he saw the city
[51:38] who only in other words completely given
[51:41] to idolatry
[51:42] paul entering to ask him the entire city
[51:45] adults everywhere and he stirred him up
[51:49] jump to verse now 20
[51:51] 24 the bible say paul now begin to talk
[51:54] to them he said god that made the world
[51:57] and all things darwin saying that he is
[52:00] the lord of heaven and earth dwell not
[52:03] in temple made with him anybody
[52:08] neither is worship with man's hand
[52:11] as though he needed anything seeing he
[52:13] gives to all life and breath and all
[52:16] things and has made of one blood
[52:20] not two blood
[52:22] of one blood all nations of men for to
[52:27] dwell and all on all the face of the
[52:30] earth
[52:31] and has determined the time before
[52:33] appointed and the bounds of their
[52:36] habitation he he controlled everything
[52:39] amen
[52:40] that day should seek the lord
[52:42] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:44] if happily they might feel after him
[52:48] and find him
[52:49] though he be not far from every one of
[52:52] us
[52:53] watch now
[52:55] for in him we live
[52:57] and move and have our being as certain
[53:01] also as your own poet have said for we
[53:04] are also his offspring
[53:08] we are the offspring full
[53:10] of god
[53:11] verse 29 for as much then as we are the
[53:15] offspring of god or the children of all
[53:18] we ought not to think
[53:20] that the godhead is like to gold
[53:23] or silver or stone graven by art of
[53:26] immense device we must have the mind of
[53:28] god
[53:29] verse 30 and the time
[53:32] of this ignorance
[53:34] everybody see now
[53:36] the time of this ignorance god wink at
[53:40] it in other words god overlooked that
[53:43] ever here god overlooked that but now
[53:47] command all men
[53:49] everywhere to do what
[53:52] so the high priest must understand the
[53:54] ignorant and them that are out of the
[53:56] way so we needed a high priest that's
[53:59] gonna understand us because we were
[54:02] ignorant
[54:03] we were completely out of the way
[54:06] take efficiency
[54:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[54:12] take ephesians 2 so it's going to be
[54:14] clear
[54:18] ephesians chapter 2
[54:21] if you dare you can say amen
[54:23] verse 10
[54:24] for we are his workmanship
[54:27] created in who
[54:29] in christ jesus
[54:31] to water
[54:32] so you are programmed
[54:35] for good work
[54:37] you don't have to fabricate them
[54:40] you don't have to force them
[54:42] there is a good work that was program
[54:44] there is a software before you come in
[54:47] this world
[54:48] god took that software and loaded you up
[54:52] all you have to do is just turn the
[54:53] computer on
[54:57] and take your hand off the steering
[54:58] wheel put on automatic pallet and just
[55:01] watch the plane moving
[55:03] it's already loaded to take you from a
[55:06] to b
[55:07] because when you are sealed you are
[55:09] still until the day of what
[55:11] your redemption all the way up its
[55:14] automatic talent
[55:15] take your hand off
[55:18] let him be the one doing the driving
[55:21] lead nothing to their own understanding
[55:24] but acknowledge him in all your ways
[55:27] before you do anything remember him that
[55:30] the one in control
[55:34] hallelujah
[55:35] we are his workmanship created in christ
[55:38] jesus to good work
[55:40] which god has before done what or damn
[55:44] that we should do what
[55:46] what else do you have to do
[55:50] what else do you have to do you were
[55:52] ordained before the foundation of the
[55:54] world to be exactly to live a christian
[55:56] life
[56:01] hallelujah do you control your breathing
[56:06] so why should you worry about how am i
[56:08] breathing
[56:09] huh okay
[56:12] do you control that
[56:17] one day we will talk about the
[56:19] subconscious and the conscience
[56:23] then you will see the parasympathetic
[56:25] and the sympathetic how it works
[56:27] in
[56:28] christianity no he's a doctor in
[56:31] christianity
[56:32] anybody
[56:35] just to lock somebody who's looking for
[56:37] headache
[56:40] amen
[56:41] let's go to verse 11. wherefore remember
[56:44] that you being in time past gentle
[56:48] in the flesh
[56:50] who are caught on circumcision
[56:53] by that which is called the circumcision
[56:55] the jews
[56:57] in the flesh made by hands
[56:59] they were intact that at that time you
[57:02] are without crust
[57:04] ignorant
[57:05] being alien from the commonwealth of
[57:08] israel
[57:11] ignorant out of the way and stranger
[57:13] from the covenant of promise
[57:16] having no hope
[57:20] no hope
[57:21] how can you bring a hope to somebody who
[57:24] doesn't have hope it's through abraham
[57:27] because abraham believed when there was
[57:30] no hope
[57:33] it's only abraham
[57:35] who could believe when there is no no
[57:37] hope
[57:38] and he can call things that are not as
[57:40] though they are
[57:41] only in abraham can you do that
[57:44] that's why he was we are the royal seed
[57:46] of abraham
[57:48] oh my god
[57:49] it's like a sermon pulling this way
[57:51] another one is pulling this way amen he
[57:54] said alien from the covenant stranger
[57:56] from the covenant of promise having no
[57:59] hope and without god in the world we
[58:02] were totally ignorant
[58:05] completely out of the way
[58:07] everybody clear but now in christ jesus
[58:11] you who sometimes were a pharaoh
[58:14] are made nearby the blood of christ
[58:16] for he is our peace
[58:20] who has made buff one and has broken
[58:24] down the middle wall of partition
[58:26] between us
[58:28] so when these priests come he breaks the
[58:30] world of partition he said it is not
[58:33] about jews it's not about gentiles those
[58:35] things were in tap i was just bringing a
[58:38] message all of you are children of god
[58:41] hallelujah
[58:43] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[58:47] even the law of commandment containing
[58:50] ordinances for to making himself of two
[58:54] one new man so making peace and that he
[58:57] may welcome sir both to god in one body
[59:01] by the cross having slain what the image
[59:05] the enmity thereby came and pushed peace
[59:09] to you which were a power of and to them
[59:12] that are near
[59:13] it's the devil
[59:15] he's having a wrong number
[59:17] so we are going through trouble time
[59:19] brothers and sister so just keep calm
[59:22] the airplane will be fine you're going
[59:23] to hear something from bumpy roads
[59:29] so what you're hearing we're going to
[59:30] the bumpy road
[59:33] amen
[59:34] so don't worry about it everything will
[59:36] be okay
[59:37] blessed be the name of the lord now with
[59:40] good
[59:41] relax keep your baby inflamed
[59:45] blessed be the name of the lord and came
[59:47] and preached peace to you which were far
[59:50] off i love this airplane and to them
[59:53] that were near for through him we both
[59:56] have access by one spirit to the father
[59:59] verse 19. now therefore you are no more
[1:00:02] stranger
[1:00:06] anybody here
[1:00:07] you are no more stranger and foreign but
[1:00:11] you are what fellow citizens with
[1:00:14] descent and of the household of who
[1:00:19] so when you go to heaven no complex with
[1:00:21] the jews
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:24] when you go to heaven when you see a jew
[1:00:26] you don't
[1:00:27] who is abraham abraham that's really you
[1:00:29] no abraham actually is waiting for you
[1:00:32] when you look he say will you my brother
[1:00:34] how did you survive laudisha
[1:00:37] that was a pretty pretty bad age
[1:00:40] we cannot see anything how did you
[1:00:42] survive
[1:00:44] tell us about it
[1:00:47] you have to deal with homosexuals with
[1:00:50] this with the how did you make it
[1:00:56] blessed be the name of the lord so now
[1:00:58] we understand
[1:00:59] hebrew 10 brought this he said when he
[1:01:02] come into the word he says sacrifice and
[1:01:05] offering that word is not but a body has
[1:01:07] not prepared
[1:01:11] don't worry
[1:01:19] it happened back home
[1:01:21] so i know how to handle this
[1:01:25] you stay pastor while you understand
[1:01:27] certain things amen
[1:01:29] so now hebrew gave it
[1:01:31] so now the first high priest that was
[1:01:35] entered into the law
[1:01:36] entered by a major prophet
[1:01:39] that prophet was a priest
[1:01:41] that prophet was a leaver
[1:01:43] now we already explained to you that we
[1:01:45] have a new high priest
[1:01:47] the high priest is melchizedek
[1:01:49] melchizedek was made flesh in the man
[1:01:52] called jesus christ
[1:01:54] now melchizedek need to be introduced
[1:01:56] into the world
[1:01:59] if the first high priest of the
[1:02:02] levitical
[1:02:04] priesthood was introduced by a leaver
[1:02:08] who was a prophet
[1:02:10] his father was a levator his mother was
[1:02:14] a levert and nobody was him the
[1:02:17] melchizedek priesthood also must be
[1:02:20] introduced by a lever
[1:02:22] because god doesn't change
[1:02:25] god is predictable
[1:02:28] you can predict god
[1:02:30] and he happened on time that's why
[1:02:32] brother branham said when god healed one
[1:02:35] person
[1:02:36] that said he's locked
[1:02:38] if you approach him like that same
[1:02:40] person god is under obligation
[1:02:45] obligation to do the same thing
[1:02:47] you can predict god
[1:02:49] the first priest has to be washed by a
[1:02:52] lever
[1:02:53] and he the one who watched him nobody
[1:02:55] watched him
[1:02:57] he was a major prophet
[1:02:59] high caliber prophet his father was a
[1:03:01] leaver and his mother was a level and we
[1:03:04] have discovered now that our high priest
[1:03:06] is jesus christ
[1:03:08] so jesus must be introduced because a
[1:03:11] new living way must be introduced to us
[1:03:14] to bring us into perfection so if the
[1:03:18] first high priest was washed
[1:03:20] the second high priest must be washed
[1:03:23] there must be a leave up there and that
[1:03:26] leave us must be a prophet
[1:03:31] now we are connecting the dot
[1:03:33] but here
[1:03:35] who is that liver
[1:03:37] the bible saying looks verse
[1:03:39] chapter one verse five he said there was
[1:03:42] in the day of king herod
[1:03:45] the king of judah a certain priest named
[1:03:48] who
[1:03:49] zechariah
[1:03:51] so zechariah was a priest
[1:03:54] in other words zechariah was a liver
[1:03:58] everybody
[1:03:59] hallelujah the changing pattern of god
[1:04:02] of the course of arabia
[1:04:04] and his wife was the daughter of what
[1:04:08] the daughter of aaron
[1:04:11] so the high priest
[1:04:13] so we found out that the father of the
[1:04:16] the one who have to introduce the new
[1:04:18] high priest
[1:04:19] both of them are levered just like moses
[1:04:22] his father and his mother were liverpool
[1:04:25] we are now introducing to you the new
[1:04:28] high priest the high priest that came
[1:04:30] from heaven he must be introduced by a
[1:04:32] leaver
[1:04:33] the father of delivers must be also
[1:04:36] levite and that man must be a higher
[1:04:39] prophet
[1:04:42] hallelujah
[1:04:43] and her name was elizabeth but the angel
[1:04:46] said unto him
[1:04:48] fear not verse 13 zechariah for that
[1:04:50] prayer is heard and that wife elizabeth
[1:04:54] shall bear dear son and that shall call
[1:04:56] his name john
[1:04:58] and da shall have joy and gladness and
[1:05:02] many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:05:07] so we found john a major prophet up here
[1:05:10] father liver
[1:05:12] mother liver
[1:05:15] be he himself was supposed to be a
[1:05:17] priest
[1:05:19] because he was born in the lineage of
[1:05:21] aaron
[1:05:22] but god took him away he said this
[1:05:25] priesthood cannot combine with the old
[1:05:27] person you must go in the wilderness
[1:05:31] because the first prophet that
[1:05:32] introduced the levitical priesthood also
[1:05:35] went into the wilderness so you cannot
[1:05:37] stop stay here in the temple i must draw
[1:05:40] you away to the world today to match
[1:05:42] moses
[1:05:46] did i lose anybody
[1:05:47] no we're going this way
[1:05:49] so just saying amen verse 15 and he
[1:05:53] shall be grateful in the sight of the
[1:05:56] lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:05:58] no strong drink
[1:06:00] he shall be filled
[1:06:04] with the holy ghost
[1:06:07] even from his mother's water
[1:06:10] remember moses nobody watched him
[1:06:13] so nobody can watch john the baptist
[1:06:16] john the bastards must be watched
[1:06:18] himself by the pillar of fire
[1:06:24] that's why he must receive the holy
[1:06:27] ghost without anybody praying for him
[1:06:30] because nobody watched moses
[1:06:32] but yet moses have to watch aaron
[1:06:35] nobody watch john the baptist but john
[1:06:37] the baptist must watch jesus christ
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] hi god
[1:06:45] and many of the children of israel shall
[1:06:48] be turned to the lord their god
[1:06:50] and he shall go before him
[1:06:53] in the spirit and power of who
[1:06:57] elijah to turn the heart of the father
[1:07:00] to the water
[1:07:02] and the heart of the children did you
[1:07:04] see the bible saying that
[1:07:05] you must understand the punctuation of
[1:07:07] the bible
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:10] anybody clear so look read only a
[1:07:13] portion of malachi phone
[1:07:16] that belonged to john and he never read
[1:07:19] the second person because that belonged
[1:07:22] to william branama
[1:07:26] everybody cleared
[1:07:27] and the first
[1:07:29] major prophet that introduced the high
[1:07:32] priesthood in the levitical order was
[1:07:34] moses but the one who introduced
[1:07:37] melchizedek is elijah
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:45] no wonder god used that spirit first
[1:07:48] time because grace was coming through
[1:07:50] jesus christ
[1:07:52] ever clear because in the book of
[1:07:54] zechariah you'll see that there is seven
[1:07:56] candlestick and there is two olaf trees
[1:08:00] one on the right side and one on the
[1:08:02] left side
[1:08:03] and they ask who are these two they said
[1:08:06] these are the two anointed of revelation
[1:08:09] 11.
[1:08:11] which was moses and elijah so the
[1:08:14] levitical priesthood used moses but the
[1:08:17] melchizedek priesthood must use now
[1:08:20] elijah the prophet
[1:08:25] but that elijah was a priest
[1:08:27] his father a priest
[1:08:29] mother a priest major prophet have to
[1:08:32] introduce by a priest
[1:08:34] like the mother of the son of zebedee
[1:08:36] came
[1:08:37] he said i'm warning trophy something
[1:08:39] jesus said go ahead say can my children
[1:08:42] sit on the right side on the left side
[1:08:44] he said that one i cannot give it to you
[1:08:48] because under the candlestick there is
[1:08:50] two people standing on the right side
[1:08:51] and the left side
[1:08:53] one have to introduce the levitical
[1:08:55] priesthood the other one have to
[1:08:56] introduce the melchizedek priesthood the
[1:08:58] true spirit moses and elijah moses and
[1:09:01] elijah moses and allah and you'll see
[1:09:02] them in one transfiguration it's moses
[1:09:05] and elijah
[1:09:06] everybody here brother branham say under
[1:09:09] the feast of the trumpet that moses and
[1:09:12] elijah will go back to the jew
[1:09:14] because the jew rely on moses they gave
[1:09:17] jesus christ trouble because of moses
[1:09:20] now moses himself must come down
[1:09:23] and say i am the one who gave you the
[1:09:25] law
[1:09:26] but elijah must be there to introduce
[1:09:28] grace
[1:09:31] so the two priests ruled are coming
[1:09:32] together now moses and elijah going back
[1:09:35] to the jew to pull them out of the law
[1:09:37] and then to bring them grace the law
[1:09:39] came by me moses but grace was
[1:09:42] introduced by elijah
[1:09:43] [Applause]
[1:09:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:48] hallelujah
[1:09:50] so we found out now this priest has to
[1:09:52] be introduced by another prophet and
[1:09:55] that prophet has to be a high caliber
[1:09:58] the bible says when the messenger of
[1:10:00] john were departed he began to speak
[1:10:03] unto the people concerning john
[1:10:05] what went here to see in the wilderness
[1:10:08] for to see a weed shaken with the wind
[1:10:12] but what went you had to see a man
[1:10:14] clothing soft raymond
[1:10:16] behold there that are gorgeous apparel
[1:10:19] and live delicately are in king's court
[1:10:23] but what went here to see
[1:10:26] a prophet
[1:10:27] a level prophet like moses
[1:10:31] yeah i say unto you and much more than a
[1:10:34] prophet
[1:10:35] this is he of whom it's written behold i
[1:10:39] said my messenger before be before my
[1:10:41] that face isaiah which shall prepare
[1:10:44] that way before thee for i say unto you
[1:10:47] among those that are born of women there
[1:10:50] is no not a greater prophet than who
[1:10:53] john the baptist
[1:10:56] over there there is no prophet like
[1:10:58] moses to whom i speak face to face
[1:11:00] over here there is nobody that is like
[1:11:03] john the baptist those two prophets must
[1:11:05] be higher caliber prophet because they
[1:11:08] are introducing the high priest
[1:11:14] hallelujah
[1:11:15] our pride priest now is approaching
[1:11:18] he needs to be washed
[1:11:20] but which tribe must come the high
[1:11:21] priest
[1:11:24] we rabb let's go to hebrews 7.
[1:11:28] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:31] let's go to hebrews 7. now we must find
[1:11:33] the trap
[1:11:35] we know that the precursor the one who
[1:11:37] introduced him everything is perfect
[1:11:40] a prophet a prophet
[1:11:42] higher caliber higher caliber liver
[1:11:45] liver priest priest
[1:11:47] mother liver mother liver father liver
[1:11:50] father liver the difference is in the
[1:11:52] priest
[1:11:53] which high priest are you introducing
[1:11:55] this one aaron didn't bring perfection
[1:11:58] but this one is melchizedek
[1:12:01] here
[1:12:02] let's go to hebrews 7. now we're talking
[1:12:04] about this melchizedek
[1:12:07] for this melchizedek
[1:12:10] karma water
[1:12:12] king of salem and water
[1:12:14] so the high priest himself is king and
[1:12:17] priest
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:22] our high priest is king and peace that's
[1:12:26] why we must we were made king and priest
[1:12:31] because we are the children of the high
[1:12:33] priest
[1:12:34] if the high priest is king and priest
[1:12:37] the children also are king and priest
[1:12:43] we are after the order of mercy
[1:12:46] no beginning of days
[1:12:48] no ending of life
[1:12:50] we are eternal
[1:12:52] that's why he was god and his attribute
[1:12:57] hallelujah
[1:12:59] please stop the messiah who met abraham
[1:13:02] returning from the slaughter of the king
[1:13:04] and bless him to whom also abraham gave
[1:13:07] a tenth of powerful being first
[1:13:10] interpreted king of water
[1:13:13] righteousness and after that also king
[1:13:16] of water
[1:13:17] he is a peace he is a righteousness ever
[1:13:20] here which is king of peace
[1:13:23] verse 3 without father
[1:13:26] without mother without descent neither
[1:13:30] have the beginning of days no ending of
[1:13:33] life but married like the son of god and
[1:13:36] by the priest how
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:43] oh my god
[1:13:44] jump to verse 11
[1:13:46] if the therefore perfection whereby let
[1:13:50] the levitical priesthood for under it
[1:13:53] the people receive the law
[1:13:55] what further need was there that another
[1:13:58] priest should rise after the order of
[1:14:01] melchizedek and not because after the
[1:14:03] order of aaron
[1:14:05] his perfection came through the
[1:14:07] levitical priesthood why do we need
[1:14:09] another priesthood but we know that the
[1:14:12] law could make
[1:14:13] nothing into perfection it was only to
[1:14:16] give us a better hope
[1:14:17] that's why we needed a different
[1:14:19] priesthood
[1:14:20] but is this priesthood coming through
[1:14:22] levi again because that's what the
[1:14:24] pharisees were waiting for
[1:14:27] that's where they miss god
[1:14:31] hallelujah
[1:14:32] hallelujah
[1:14:33] verse 12 for the priesthood being what
[1:14:37] changed
[1:14:39] there is made of necessity a change also
[1:14:42] of the water the law from grace
[1:14:44] everybody clear
[1:14:46] for he of whom these things are spoken
[1:14:49] pretend to another what
[1:14:54] a priest from another tribe
[1:14:58] a priest from another trouble
[1:15:00] i thought all the priests come from
[1:15:02] liver i thought god caused secret liver
[1:15:05] to be preached forever why is he
[1:15:07] bringing a priest from the another tribe
[1:15:10] liver didn't have the kingship
[1:15:14] we need to look because this priest is
[1:15:17] not only priest but he is king
[1:15:19] so he must enter through the entrance of
[1:15:22] king so which tribe is responsible for
[1:15:26] kingship
[1:15:28] let's flip them one by one
[1:15:32] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[1:15:36] hallelujah verse 13
[1:15:39] for he of whom these things are spoken
[1:15:42] pertain to another tribe of which no man
[1:15:46] gave attendance at the altar
[1:15:50] the jews missed god
[1:15:52] they didn't understand what god was
[1:15:54] doing they were doing things by ritual
[1:15:58] by repetition
[1:15:59] like parrot
[1:16:01] but lack the revelation
[1:16:03] that's why they could be baptized under
[1:16:05] moses but many of them god was not
[1:16:08] pleased with them
[1:16:09] because the word that was received was
[1:16:11] not mixed with faith
[1:16:13] it was not mixed with revelation
[1:16:16] they thought they following a man they
[1:16:18] didn't understand that man was following
[1:16:20] a light that's why paul falls paul say
[1:16:23] follow me as a follower
[1:16:25] so actually you are not really following
[1:16:27] paul but you are following the crowds
[1:16:29] that paul is following
[1:16:34] hallelujah
[1:16:36] amen verse 14 for it is evident that our
[1:16:40] lord sprang arose out of what
[1:16:44] judah
[1:16:45] of which tribe
[1:16:46] moses spoke nothing concerning
[1:16:49] priesthood
[1:16:52] judah
[1:16:53] bringing a priest yes
[1:16:56] god throughout the time
[1:16:58] was giving signal to israel that the
[1:17:02] priests will come from judah but israel
[1:17:04] was missing it
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:11] the bible says here
[1:17:13] the high priest the first high priest
[1:17:15] that came from the liberty
[1:17:17] from the levitical priesthood his name
[1:17:19] was who
[1:17:20] aaron
[1:17:22] moses mother
[1:17:25] was married to his father liver liver
[1:17:30] you know that
[1:17:31] we already showed you yesterday the
[1:17:33] father of moses was a liver
[1:17:35] and his wife was liver so they marry in
[1:17:38] between the tribe
[1:17:40] to keep everything in order
[1:17:43] clear everything must be in order so
[1:17:45] they brought iran they brought moses and
[1:17:48] think god said moses is the major
[1:17:50] prophet it's a higher spirit i'm going
[1:17:52] to use him right here and aaron you're
[1:17:54] going to be the high priest so we expect
[1:17:56] to keep the levitical priesthood so
[1:17:58] aaron must marry a leaver
[1:18:01] but let's see who era mary
[1:18:04] do you know the wife of aaron came from
[1:18:05] wichita
[1:18:07] at the opening of the seventh year the
[1:18:10] bible became a you
[1:18:14] exodus 6 23 and aaron took him elishaba
[1:18:21] or elishaba whichever way you work
[1:18:24] daughter of amina
[1:18:27] sister of nation to wife
[1:18:30] what is that information telling me
[1:18:33] that's why i don't want to read this
[1:18:34] stuff i don't understand what it is
[1:18:36] god is hidden in genealogy
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:39] is hidden in punctuation
[1:18:41] god is hidden in images god is hidden in
[1:18:44] numbers
[1:18:46] i wish i'll go to part three so you're
[1:18:48] going to see the numbering in the
[1:18:49] solomon temple
[1:18:52] number verse one we're talking about
[1:18:55] nation the uh uh a daughter of abinadab
[1:18:58] sister of nation
[1:19:00] so abhi nadab have nation
[1:19:03] as his son and his daughter was elishaba
[1:19:08] what is that telling me
[1:19:10] in number chapter 1 verse 1 the baba was
[1:19:14] numbering the children of israel
[1:19:15] according to their uh to the position
[1:19:19] that will reflect the zodiac
[1:19:21] he said of judah who
[1:19:24] nation the son of who aminadab so nation
[1:19:29] was from the tribe of judah
[1:19:33] to help you up a little bit stabilize
[1:19:35] you without two scriptures we're going
[1:19:37] to put more witness ruth chapter 4 verse
[1:19:40] 18
[1:19:41] now these are the generation of fairies
[1:19:44] pharaohs begot hezron and hezron begot
[1:19:47] remy and when begot a minada did you see
[1:19:50] that i mean adam now
[1:19:52] you see him and i mean other begotten
[1:19:55] nation and nation begat who
[1:19:58] someone and someone begat who
[1:20:00] and boaz begat who
[1:20:02] and all that begat who and jesse begat
[1:20:05] who
[1:20:06] so the wife of the first high priest was
[1:20:09] from judah
[1:20:12] why did aaron mess up with another
[1:20:14] trouble
[1:20:16] why he didn't marry a wife from mexicali
[1:20:19] why he didn't marry a wife from them
[1:20:22] god was giving them signal
[1:20:25] that there is something
[1:20:26] i brought the priest but i don't have a
[1:20:29] king
[1:20:30] i am priest and king
[1:20:32] so take your wife from judah to balance
[1:20:35] me up a little bit
[1:20:36] i cannot only work with priest preached
[1:20:38] with my bring bring a little seed from
[1:20:41] judah so i feel comfortable in heaven
[1:20:44] when i see you i'm looking at believer
[1:20:46] and i'm looking at you okay that's good
[1:20:48] that's a lot of reflection of me
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:52] a man
[1:20:53] a man from liver
[1:20:56] must marry a daughter from judah to
[1:20:59] introduce the first high priest
[1:21:03] so if that happened in the introduction
[1:21:06] of the first high priest where the tribe
[1:21:08] of judah married somebody from the tribe
[1:21:11] of liver that must happen also at the
[1:21:14] introduction of the second high priest
[1:21:18] did i lose anybody
[1:21:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:24] it's the surgery my friend
[1:21:26] we are in a surgical procedure so hang
[1:21:28] tight
[1:21:29] you're not going to lose weight
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:33] luke chapter 1 verse 26
[1:21:36] and in the sixth month
[1:21:38] the angel gabriel
[1:21:41] was sent from
[1:21:43] god unto a city of galilee named
[1:21:47] nazareth
[1:21:49] here
[1:21:50] we found a marriage between judah and
[1:21:52] liver
[1:21:53] and the introduction
[1:21:55] of the first high priest
[1:21:56] that marriage must also happen to
[1:21:59] introduce the second high priest
[1:22:02] verse 27 to a virgin
[1:22:05] is passed to a man whose name was joseph
[1:22:09] comer of the house of what
[1:22:12] so the man here now
[1:22:14] is from the tribe of judah
[1:22:18] but the marriage must be between judah
[1:22:21] and liver so we're losing we're missing
[1:22:24] the tribe of lever now
[1:22:27] hallelujah
[1:22:28] and the virgin's name was mary
[1:22:31] verse 35 and the angel answered and said
[1:22:34] unto her the holy ghost shall come upon
[1:22:36] thee and the power of the highest shall
[1:22:39] overshadow thee therefore also the holy
[1:22:42] thing
[1:22:43] which shall be born of this shall be
[1:22:45] called the son of god and behold thy
[1:22:49] cousin elizabeth
[1:22:53] mary had a cousin
[1:22:55] her cousin was elizabeth but previously
[1:22:59] i showed you that elizabeth was a
[1:23:01] daughter of aaron
[1:23:03] so mary was from the tribe of liver
[1:23:06] another marriage between liver and judah
[1:23:11] but this time the man must come from
[1:23:13] judah
[1:23:14] over there the man came from liver
[1:23:19] the man came from liver he introduced
[1:23:22] delivered by this time the man must come
[1:23:24] from judah to introduce somebody from
[1:23:26] the tribe of judah
[1:23:30] the mathematics of god
[1:23:33] hallelujah
[1:23:35] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[1:23:37] back to uh hebrews 7.
[1:23:39] i hope i'm soaring good brother
[1:23:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:23:44] what a trip
[1:23:45] when you look around you you see cloud
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:53] it is yet far more evident for that
[1:23:56] verse 15 after the simulated of
[1:23:59] melchizedek there
[1:24:01] what priest because the priest must come
[1:24:04] from what from judah
[1:24:07] about here
[1:24:08] that's why
[1:24:10] one day david was hungry

[1:25:06] no other bread but work on only one kind
[1:25:08] of bread
[1:25:13] it is the show bread
[1:25:15] but the show bread belongs only to who
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:19] was david a priest
[1:25:21] who gave david the permission to eat it
[1:25:27] and the priest never argued with david
[1:25:31] he never told david
[1:25:33] you're not a priest you cannot eat it he
[1:25:35] said did you consecrate yourself he said
[1:25:38] yes me and the young men not only me

[1:26:03] david david cut it put it nothing
[1:26:06] happened
[1:26:08] and he didn't stop there he cut the same
[1:26:10] bread and gave it to his friend we don't
[1:26:13] care which trap they were coming out but
[1:26:16] as long as they follow david they have
[1:26:18] the right to the precloud

[1:26:24] you might be born in america you might
[1:26:26] be born in africa you might be born in
[1:26:28] new york in europe in asia that's not
[1:26:31] what the mother as long as we follow the
[1:26:34] high priest we have the right to enter
[1:26:37] the presence of god
[1:26:39] blessed be the lord of the lord thank
[1:26:41] you jesus
[1:26:42] for making a new and a living way
[1:26:45] where everybody can have access to the
[1:26:47] presence of the kingdom
[1:26:49] oh my god
[1:26:52] my my my my mind that's why in matthew
[1:26:55] chapter 12 the bible say and the time
[1:26:58] jesus went on the sabbath day through
[1:27:00] the corn and his disciple was hungry
[1:27:04] were hungry and begin to pluck up the
[1:27:06] ear of the corn and eat him
[1:27:09] and to eat but when the pharisees saw it
[1:27:12] they say unto him behold that disciple
[1:27:15] do that which is not lawful to do upon
[1:27:17] the sabbath day
[1:27:19] and he said unto them
[1:27:20] have ye not heard david
[1:27:23] they were reading the thunders
[1:27:26] but they were not understanding the
[1:27:28] thunders
[1:27:31] they were reading the message book
[1:27:33] but this the supernatural element was
[1:27:37] still locked
[1:27:38] despite the revelation
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:42] they could cut court court code but
[1:27:44] there is no revelation
[1:27:46] of what they were coding and when the
[1:27:48] manifestation of the revelation happened
[1:27:51] they begin to get trouble why does he
[1:27:53] preach only this kind of stuff
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] let me put the weapon back
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:10] have you not read what defeated when he
[1:28:13] was hungry and they that were with him
[1:28:17] not only david
[1:28:20] hallelujah
[1:28:21] how he entered into the house of god and
[1:28:24] did eat the show bread which was not
[1:28:27] lawful for him to eat jesus acknowledged
[1:28:31] that it was not lawful for david to eat
[1:28:34] yet david ate it
[1:28:36] and nothing happened
[1:28:40] this mind cannot comprehend god
[1:28:46] don't reproduce an image of what you see
[1:28:48] in heaven
[1:28:50] moses make the caribbean
[1:28:53] what are you going to do
[1:28:54] yeah hallelujah
[1:28:57] neither for them which were with him he
[1:29:00] was not not only lawful for david even
[1:29:03] those that follow david
[1:29:05] but only for the priest yet david ate
[1:29:08] because he was god was telling them the
[1:29:11] true priest
[1:29:12] is coming out of judah
[1:29:16] i heed it from the devil so he can try
[1:29:18] believer all he wants that's a temporary
[1:29:21] solution
[1:29:22] amen because lifa was dealing with the
[1:29:25] branches of the tree when you cut a
[1:29:27] branch another branch comes you cut a
[1:29:29] branch another branch camp don't commit
[1:29:31] adultery don't steal don't do this by
[1:29:33] the worshiper is not perch so it will
[1:29:36] continue to bring branches branches
[1:29:38] but when the high priest was coming john
[1:29:40] the baptist come he said the axe is put
[1:29:43] at the root
[1:29:44] not on the branches that was the law the
[1:29:47] axis put at the root of the tree that is
[1:29:49] where the life is in other words there
[1:29:51] is a high priest that's gonna deal with
[1:29:53] sin on the very source of it
[1:29:55] and once that worshiper is punched there
[1:29:58] is no more desire for sin you don't have
[1:30:00] to worry about stealing you don't have
[1:30:02] to worry about anything because the axe
[1:30:05] was put on the root that's the ministry
[1:30:07] of melchizedek
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:13] my god
[1:30:15] this plane is tough today
[1:30:19] hallelujah
[1:30:20] hallelujah verse 5 oh have you not read
[1:30:24] in the law
[1:30:25] how that on the sabbath day the priest
[1:30:28] in the temple profaned the sabbath and
[1:30:31] are blameless
[1:30:33] what are you going to do
[1:30:35] that's why brother franco
[1:30:37] can send a text
[1:30:40] to a deacon
[1:30:41] about what is going on in the church and
[1:30:43] he's blameless
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:47] [Music]
[1:30:49] so they brought me the bazooka
[1:30:54] sorry about this
[1:30:58] no problem
[1:31:01] the devil is in trouble
[1:31:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:07] i told you that a bazooka
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] that's why brother franco can send a
[1:31:13] text
[1:31:14] because brother branham said you should
[1:31:15] not pass note in the church
[1:31:18] today we don't have note but the text is
[1:31:20] an electronic note
[1:31:22] the word will continue to handle the
[1:31:24] devil even if he changed form
[1:31:26] the world is continuing to catch him
[1:31:28] because he was a word meant for this age
[1:31:31] if you change text to electronic he's
[1:31:33] still a note
[1:31:35] so that could still apply
[1:31:37] anybody
[1:31:38] but if a priest is doing his priest work
[1:31:41] he's blameless
[1:31:43] if you do it it's sin if brother franco
[1:31:46] does it god doesn't see it that's why
[1:31:48] the priest can blaspheme the sabbath and
[1:31:50] the blameless
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:53] that's why a deacon can talk to another
[1:31:55] deacon and he's blameless because he's
[1:31:57] profaning the sabbath under service god
[1:32:00] doesn't look at that
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:09] don't worry my friend you can chew that
[1:32:10] one later
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:14] hallelujah
[1:32:15] so now
[1:32:17] we jesus is introduced
[1:32:20] but there is another high priest
[1:32:22] caiaphas is there
[1:32:23] now we are in the junction in the
[1:32:25] blending
[1:32:27] and a high priest and a high priest
[1:32:29] one must go
[1:32:31] everybody here because jesus is talking
[1:32:33] caiaphas is talking
[1:32:35] it's like a blending
[1:32:38] between laodicea and the broad age
[1:32:44] it's like in goshen
[1:32:47] goshen was in egypt
[1:32:49] yet he was not part of what was going on
[1:32:52] in egypt
[1:32:53] it's an age within an edge
[1:33:00] anybody here
[1:33:02] so we got two high priests
[1:33:04] one must give away
[1:33:06] what happened
[1:33:07] so they take the new high priest and
[1:33:10] they take him to the
[1:33:12] natural night high priest what happened
[1:33:15] the bible say in mark chapter 14
[1:33:17] verse 53 and the lord jesus our high
[1:33:20] priest
[1:33:21] a way to the high priest
[1:33:24] they took the high priest to the high
[1:33:26] priest now the two high priests meet
[1:33:30] what a clash
[1:33:32] about here
[1:33:34] and with him we're assembling all the
[1:33:36] chief priests
[1:33:38] and the elders and the scribes and the
[1:33:40] high priest stood up in the midst and
[1:33:42] asked jesus saying our da
[1:33:46] answer it that means nothing
[1:33:48] what is this which they
[1:33:50] which this witness against me
[1:33:52] but he held his peace
[1:33:56] everybody clear
[1:33:57] and answered nothing
[1:33:59] again the high priest
[1:34:01] asked him
[1:34:02] when jesus was there they were accusing
[1:34:06] him of certain things
[1:34:08] and the scripture plainly told us that
[1:34:10] what they accused jesus was false
[1:34:13] because they took people and they hired
[1:34:15] them
[1:34:15] so against the false accusation jesus
[1:34:18] never spoke anything
[1:34:21] as long as what they told you about me
[1:34:24] is false i don't have to answer
[1:34:29] you can continue to believe that
[1:34:31] i know me and my high priest
[1:34:33] but then the high priest changed the
[1:34:35] question and began to ask him about his
[1:34:38] messiahship
[1:34:42] about who he was
[1:34:44] not what the people say but i'm asking
[1:34:47] you who you are
[1:34:49] then the mouth of jesus open up
[1:34:53] that's why paul say if paul if not paul
[1:34:55] peter he said be ready to give an answer
[1:34:58] to them that want to know the hope
[1:35:00] that is coming from thee
[1:35:02] not the gossip
[1:35:04] leave them alone they won't understand
[1:35:06] you everybody clear
[1:35:08] and again the high priest in green asked
[1:35:11] him and said to him or da day christ
[1:35:16] ah now the rubber meet the road
[1:35:19] everybody
[1:35:20] our dad the crush the son of the blessed
[1:35:24] and jesus said
[1:35:29] amen you just never say
[1:35:31] humbly
[1:35:33] you know we must be humble we must be
[1:35:35] humble eh we must be humble don't be too
[1:35:37] proud
[1:35:39] no no no no no no
[1:35:41] ask me who i am
[1:35:48] can you ask me are you mr shamble and
[1:35:51] i'm i'm saying maybe
[1:35:54] [Laughter]
[1:35:56] are you chad lamb
[1:35:59] yes i am
[1:36:00] right when they say children you say
[1:36:03] hello
[1:36:04] because brother branham said the
[1:36:05] sweetest sound
[1:36:07] that you have is the sound of your name
[1:36:12] that's something else amen
[1:36:15] you're pulling left and right that's the
[1:36:17] problem i'm trying to stay on the road
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:21] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:36:23] i am jesus said i am and you shall see
[1:36:28] the son of man sitting on the right hand
[1:36:31] of power and coming in cloud of heaven
[1:36:37] the mind of caiaphas went to a stroke
[1:36:43] not only is he saying he's the king he's
[1:36:46] also giving me his position in the
[1:36:49] tabernacle of heaven that carefuls you
[1:36:52] hear on the earth
[1:36:54] my tabernacle is not pitched by men my
[1:36:57] temple is over there and sooner you're
[1:36:59] going to see me sitting there
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:03] hallelujah
[1:37:05] what did the high priest do and the high
[1:37:07] priest did what
[1:37:09] he ranked his clothes
[1:37:11] why he didn't say man
[1:37:14] why renting his clothes
[1:37:16] why should he only renting his clothes
[1:37:18] why he didn't offense
[1:37:25] the bible is a prophetic book my friend
[1:37:28] amen
[1:37:29] in leviticus 21 verse 10 the bible says
[1:37:33] and he that is the high priest among his
[1:37:36] brethren
[1:37:38] upon who's the head
[1:37:40] upon whose head the anointing always
[1:37:42] poor
[1:37:44] and that is god sequed to put on the
[1:37:46] garment remember the steps
[1:37:48] shall not uncover his head nor rend his
[1:37:52] what
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:37:58] so careful
[1:38:00] by renting his clothes disqualify
[1:38:03] himself
[1:38:08] are you there
[1:38:09] he look he said no no no this is another
[1:38:12] priesthood
[1:38:13] he
[1:38:14] disqualified himself
[1:38:16] establishing the melchizedek priesthood
[1:38:19] on earth now
[1:38:21] now melchizedek is in full charge
[1:38:26] the high priest is gone
[1:38:28] he disqualified himself because
[1:38:30] melchizedek have rose out of judah
[1:38:35] isn't he yeah me
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:40] oh my god let's go to hebrew
[1:38:44] can i handle this ship
[1:38:49] oh my god
[1:38:51] i don't want to get you to a crash
[1:38:56] it won't happen amen
[1:39:00] and it is 4 verse 15 evident yet
[1:39:04] for is it is far it is yet far more
[1:39:07] evident for that after the simulated
[1:39:10] the likeness of melchizedek they rise of
[1:39:13] another priest who is made not after the
[1:39:17] law of corner commandment ever clear but
[1:39:20] after the power of an endless life
[1:39:25] my god jump to verse 21 now
[1:39:28] watch this amen
[1:39:31] for those priests
[1:39:34] here
[1:39:36] go to verse uh
[1:39:38] 20.
[1:39:39] and he's in as much as not without
[1:39:42] enough he was made a priest in other
[1:39:45] words he was made a priest with an oath
[1:39:47] why
[1:39:49] for those priests
[1:39:51] were made without enough
[1:39:54] so this priesthood come with enough
[1:39:59] that's why in revelation 10
[1:40:01] when the angel come
[1:40:04] there is enough
[1:40:06] here
[1:40:09] hallelujah
[1:40:11] but do this with enough by him that said
[1:40:14] to him the lord's soul and will not
[1:40:17] repent you are a priest forever after
[1:40:20] the order of who melchizedek by so much
[1:40:24] was jesus made a surety
[1:40:27] guarantee that's why they have to put
[1:40:30] off to tell you that this priesthood you
[1:40:34] have 100 guaranteed if you enter here
[1:40:37] that's it case over
[1:40:40] anybody clear
[1:40:41] surety of a better testament
[1:40:44] and
[1:40:45] they truly were many priests
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:52] there were many priests but melchizedek
[1:40:55] have only one high priest because the
[1:40:58] high priest never died
[1:41:01] and you can never change him he remained
[1:41:04] a priest forever
[1:41:06] because he didn't have beginning of days
[1:41:08] no ending of life he's a man that ever
[1:41:11] lives with him
[1:41:13] it's a permanent priesthood
[1:41:18] you don't have to worry about this high
[1:41:19] priest dying and everything
[1:41:21] because in the city of refuge you have
[1:41:24] to enter there and remain there until
[1:41:26] the high priest died but this one
[1:41:28] doesn't die so when you enter there
[1:41:31] forever secure
[1:41:32] forever
[1:41:34] if your enemy keep waving i'm waiting
[1:41:36] for the high priest to die he doesn't
[1:41:37] die until your enemy himself dies and
[1:41:40] the high priest continues on and our
[1:41:43] enemy will be dead in the lake of fire
[1:41:46] and we will continue through eternity
[1:41:49] because we are perfectly natural perfect
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:57] be the name of the lord
[1:41:59] job to verse
[1:42:00] 23 and they truly were many priests
[1:42:03] because they were not permitted to
[1:42:05] continue by reason of what
[1:42:07] but this man because he continues ever
[1:42:11] has enough
[1:42:15] unchangeable priesthood
[1:42:17] you can never change this anymore
[1:42:20] it was locked sealed forever
[1:42:23] everybody clear
[1:42:25] blessed be the name of the lord verse 26
[1:42:28] verse 25 wherefore because the
[1:42:31] priesthood is unchangeable what does it
[1:42:33] mean wherefore
[1:42:35] he is able also to save tudor
[1:42:39] he's going to bring you to complete
[1:42:41] redemption
[1:42:44] everybody here he doesn't just purge you
[1:42:47] purge your conscience from sin and leave
[1:42:49] you there because the black dog is still
[1:42:52] in the body
[1:42:54] he must deal with the black duck
[1:42:56] that takes the second banquet of esther
[1:42:59] to kick the black dog out
[1:43:02] here
[1:43:03] he must go all the way to the day of
[1:43:05] redemption until you reap the full
[1:43:08] redemption which will change the body
[1:43:11] everybody
[1:43:12] ever clear
[1:43:14] to the other most that come to god by
[1:43:17] him seeing he ever liveth to make an
[1:43:20] intercession for them for such a high
[1:43:22] priest became us
[1:43:24] in other words is proper for us
[1:43:26] who is holy
[1:43:28] harmless undefiled separate from sin and
[1:43:31] made higher than the heaven who need not
[1:43:34] daily ask the high priest to offer up
[1:43:36] sacrifice first for his own sin and then
[1:43:39] for the peoples for this he did how many
[1:43:42] times
[1:43:43] when he offered up who
[1:43:46] case over that's why when jesus died he
[1:43:49] said it is
[1:43:52] that's it
[1:43:54] that's it
[1:43:55] that's it
[1:43:56] everybody
[1:43:57] so now let's head
[1:43:59] straight to the direction that's why
[1:44:02] this high priest when he introduced john
[1:44:05] is there
[1:44:06] john is waiting for him because the high
[1:44:08] priest must be what
[1:44:10] washed
[1:44:12] brother branham saying
[1:44:13] john thought
[1:44:15] yes
[1:44:16] here is the sacrifice the sacrifice must
[1:44:19] be where did john learn that
[1:44:22] who told him that the sacrifice must be
[1:44:25] washed before it is presented
[1:44:28] then he say come on and he baptized him
[1:44:33] about here washing the first high priest
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] other word he behoove us to fulfill all
[1:44:41] righteousness
[1:44:42] in influence that john turn
[1:44:45] knowing as a servant of god as the
[1:44:47] prophet he must fulfill the word of that
[1:44:50] hour because he know if that that was
[1:44:52] the sacrifice he had just said so there
[1:44:55] cometh the lamb of god why did john call
[1:44:58] him the lamb
[1:45:01] did you see a lamb walking he was a
[1:45:03] human being
[1:45:04] when they said behold the lamb of the
[1:45:06] tribe of jew that they thought there was
[1:45:08] an animal coming
[1:45:11] they saw somebody coming up and john
[1:45:12] recognized him because john was with him
[1:45:14] on the earth
[1:45:16] amen hallelujah he was not an animal he
[1:45:18] was a human being because an animal
[1:45:20] cannot take the book
[1:45:24] you need a human hand
[1:45:25] everybody clear
[1:45:27] there come the lamb of god the
[1:45:29] sacrificial lamb that is going to take
[1:45:31] away the sin of the world and the lamb
[1:45:34] had to be washed in the
[1:45:37] everybody
[1:45:38] in the level
[1:45:40] before it's presented to the
[1:45:43] that's why john oliver prophet major
[1:45:46] like moses must be the one washing the
[1:45:49] lamb
[1:45:50] and if you wash the lamb
[1:45:53] according to the old testament you must
[1:45:55] change his garment
[1:45:57] and you must anoint him and then he's
[1:45:59] ready for the ministry
[1:46:01] and after the baptism of jesus
[1:46:04] was he anointed
[1:46:10] hallelujah
[1:46:12] look three now when all the people were
[1:46:15] baptized it came to pass that jesus also
[1:46:18] being
[1:46:19] baptized
[1:46:21] washed
[1:46:22] by a leviticus by by a priest and
[1:46:25] praying the heaven was water
[1:46:28] open and the holy ghost the anointing is
[1:46:31] coming after the washing in the lava in
[1:46:34] a level the anointing of god descended
[1:46:37] in the bodily form like a dove
[1:46:40] upon him
[1:46:41] now he's ready for the service
[1:46:44] anybody here and a voice came from
[1:46:46] heaven which said the heart my beloved
[1:46:50] son indeed i am where
[1:46:54] they watched the sacrifice they watched
[1:46:56] the high priest
[1:46:57] they anointed him
[1:46:59] that's why he started his ministry at 30
[1:47:02] after being watched now he's ready to
[1:47:04] enter the ministry after 10 38 how god
[1:47:08] anointed jesus
[1:47:11] of nazareth with the water
[1:47:13] he must be anointed because the old high
[1:47:16] priest was anointed
[1:47:18] anointed him with the holy ghost and
[1:47:20] with power who went about doing good and
[1:47:23] healing all the people that were
[1:47:25] oppressed of the devil for god was with
[1:47:28] him we found the same pattern the high
[1:47:30] priest must come washed anointed we
[1:47:33] changed the garment he's ready for the
[1:47:35] service
[1:47:36] but you can watch now something else
[1:47:39] not him anymore
[1:47:41] but you can wash also his
[1:47:44] his hand or his
[1:47:46] because one time he went in the house of
[1:47:49] someone
[1:47:50] and he's
[1:47:56] is somebody sleeping
[1:47:58] do you know who washed his feet
[1:48:00] a woman
[1:48:05] what a child that woman had how many
[1:48:07] devils
[1:48:09] why seven
[1:48:14] so jesus took seven out
[1:48:16] how many does jesus have to put there
[1:48:18] how much holy ghost have you put there
[1:48:21] because there were seven empty spots
[1:48:24] brother branham said mary magdalene was
[1:48:26] in the upper room
[1:48:28] because the bible said there were women
[1:48:30] there

[1:57:50] you already washed
[1:57:51] but abstain keep your feet in your hand
[1:57:54] from what we like from fleshly last
[1:57:56] which war against the water
[1:57:59] because the black dog is still there
[1:58:00] waiting for the redemption of the body
[1:58:03] so that water will continue to take care
[1:58:05] of your feet
[1:58:06] and your hand
[1:58:08] to keep the tabernacle clean
[1:58:10] but you are what she wants
[1:58:13] because the prayer because the worshiper
[1:58:15] once not twice perch once
[1:58:24] somebody's slowing me i'm trying to run
[1:58:26] faster
[1:58:28] amen
[1:58:29] they're worshipping one's perch has no
[1:58:32] more the conscience of sin jesus said be
[1:58:36] perfect even as the father in heaven is
[1:58:39] perfect
[1:58:40] here is the old testament out there the
[1:58:43] worshiper comes
[1:58:45] he knows he does something wrong he goes
[1:58:47] out and hunt
[1:58:49] and hunt him a lamb
[1:58:51] with a spot bring it to it wash in the
[1:58:54] level
[1:58:55] the hype we stand there at the altar
[1:58:58] here the priest then the high priest
[1:58:59] stand at the altar and take the lamb he
[1:59:02] examined it over there is no blemish on
[1:59:05] it nowhere i found in him norfolk
[1:59:07] remember brother preached yesterday
[1:59:09] amen
[1:59:10] while i was speaking and had called the
[1:59:13] prayer line and speaking on the
[1:59:15] reflection from the chicana glory to the
[1:59:18] star
[1:59:19] to the star to the sea of glass remember
[1:59:22] that yesterday the light was coming from
[1:59:24] the chicana glory to the seventh star
[1:59:25] the seventh star to the sea of glass
[1:59:27] where the sacrifice were washed
[1:59:30] was washed you know which represented
[1:59:33] water
[1:59:35] sinners the water of water
[1:59:37] so the sacrifice that were approached
[1:59:40] that was that were brought here but
[1:59:42] random say he represented the sinner the
[1:59:44] sea of glass where the sacrifice were
[1:59:47] washed
[1:59:48] on a pink wash by the water of the world
[1:59:52] then you have to get to hear the word
[1:59:54] before you can enter in because only one
[1:59:57] way you can approach god that is by
[1:59:59] faith is that right faith cometh by what
[2:00:02] hearing hearing what the word of god you
[2:00:05] must go to the level
[2:00:07] amen watching our conscience not to meet
[2:00:10] a man not to meet father not to meet
[2:00:13] mother not to meet baby that's all true
[2:00:15] we all do that but the first thing we
[2:00:17] got to come is god's avenue of approach
[2:00:21] we shall be washed when we heal the word
[2:00:24] of god
[2:00:26] anybody clear
[2:00:27] let me jump now clearly now
[2:00:32] brother uh uh ephesians says husband
[2:00:36] love your wife even as christ also loved
[2:00:39] the church and gave himself for it that
[2:00:42] he must sanctify
[2:00:44] and cleanse it with the washing off the
[2:00:47] water by the water by the word the sea
[2:00:50] of glass
[2:00:51] you got to go through the level that he
[2:00:54] may present it to himself he's washing
[2:00:58] his own bra
[2:00:59] to present his own blood to himself
[2:01:03] to himself a glorious church
[2:01:06] not having
[2:01:08] spot or whatever
[2:01:11] spot speaks of sin
[2:01:14] which is purged once
[2:01:16] but wrinkles speaks of the body
[2:01:20] which is the aging of the body
[2:01:22] it is the redemption of the inner man
[2:01:25] and the outside man
[2:01:27] without spot taking the sin away without
[2:01:30] wrinkle changing your body that is
[2:01:32] complete redemption with that spot
[2:01:34] taking sin away with that wrinkle
[2:01:37] changing your body complete redemption
[2:01:40] by the water of the world so the word we
[2:01:43] receive not only purge you
[2:01:46] but that word is responsible to bring a
[2:01:49] translation of this body into an
[2:01:52] immortal temple
[2:01:54] it is a word of full redemption
[2:01:57] that's why the seal has to be broken
[2:02:02] oh any such thing that it should be holy
[2:02:05] and without blemish john 15 year clean
[2:02:09] through the word which i have spoken to
[2:02:11] you
[2:02:12] it is not a natural level anymore it is
[2:02:15] a spiritual level
[2:02:17] anybody clear because now we are dealing
[2:02:19] with a spiritual high priest
[2:02:21] about here john 17 17 sanctify them
[2:02:24] through the
[2:02:26] truth that word is what
[2:02:29] [Music]

[2:02:32] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:02:34] amen
[2:02:35] brother branham says
[2:02:37] because when they bring you to the
[2:02:39] priest

[2:03:17] it is my water it is my love it is my
[2:03:20] sea of glass

[2:04:25] supposed to do
[2:04:30] hallelujah
[2:04:32] why do we need a specific message

[2:04:40] message it will not take no effect of
[2:04:43] you

[2:05:00] when god sent me to laodicea there is
[2:05:03] only one message that can decode me
[2:05:07] that's why you are in denomination you
[2:05:10] are floating dead but the scripture says
[2:05:13] arise you that sleep is among the death
[2:05:16] not you that died because you were
[2:05:19] sleeping among the denomination
[2:05:21] they were not enough they didn't have
[2:05:23] the key to unlock you
[2:05:25] there was only one message that can
[2:05:27] unlock you when you heard it you
[2:05:30] recognize the message to be eager for
[2:05:32] your tea off and he began to tremble in
[2:05:34] heaven

[2:10:54] drifted from the
[2:10:55] unadulterated truth of the first few
[2:10:58] years after pentecost
[2:11:00] and no true believer is any stronger and
[2:11:04] spiritually healthy and alive than he is

[2:12:42] with that spot and wrinkle it's a word
[2:12:44] that take you into the rapture
[2:12:46] standing here your garment washed
[2:12:50] we're talking about the children of the
[2:12:51] high priest now
[2:12:53] washed by the water of the believing
[2:12:56] world
[2:13:02] hallelujah
[2:13:03] the word becomes blood
[2:13:06] and the word bled for you
[2:13:08] and you are washed in the bleeding word
[2:13:11] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[2:13:15] world
[2:13:16] the anointed level
[2:13:18] hallelujah and the word was bled for you
[2:13:22] that you might be watched from the filth
[2:13:24] of this prostitute
[2:13:27] denominational idea sticking in the
[2:13:29] message and cleanse and sanctify by the
[2:13:32] washing of the water of the world and
[2:13:35] make your mind and heart stay on god and
[2:13:37] on his word
[2:13:44] when you are washed you are cleaned by
[2:13:46] this word you must receive righteousness
[2:13:51] righteousness was god's desire for his
[2:13:53] children
[2:13:54] job 29 i put on righteousness
[2:13:58] and he clothed me
[2:14:00] my judgment was a robe and i died him
[2:14:04] psalm 132 let that priest be clothed
[2:14:07] with what
[2:14:09] so somebody must provide that
[2:14:10] righteousness
[2:14:12] here
[2:14:13] i will greatly rejoice in the lord my
[2:14:16] soul shall be joyful in my god for he
[2:14:19] has clothed me with the garment of water
[2:14:23] and he has covered me with the robe of
[2:14:25] water
[2:14:26] as uh
[2:14:27] [Applause]
[2:14:29] because we wife
[2:14:30] as a bridegroom deck himself with
[2:14:32] ornament and as the brother dawned
[2:14:35] herself with her what joe it was a
[2:14:37] requirement for the high priest so if we
[2:14:40] are washed by the word what have to
[2:14:42] follow we must receive a new garment a
[2:14:45] righteousness must come by the same word
[2:14:51] roman one for i am not ashamed
[2:14:54] of the gospel of who christ for it is
[2:14:57] the power of god unto salvation to every
[2:15:01] man that believed to the jew first and
[2:15:04] also to the greek for daring in that
[2:15:07] gospel in the crust of that hour their
[2:15:10] reign is the righteousness of god don't
[2:15:13] work
[2:15:14] our righteousness today he told us you
[2:15:17] never done it to begin

[2:15:20] you will only with into it
[2:15:22] [Applause]
[2:15:25] amen
[2:15:26] and enduring is the righteousness of god
[2:15:30] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[2:15:33] written
[2:15:34] just shall live by what
[2:15:37] verse 6 of romans 4 even as david also
[2:15:40] described the blessedness of the man
[2:15:42] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[2:15:45] without
[2:15:48] in abraham
[2:15:49] not the jew the jew they got to work
[2:15:51] work work not melchizedek but here and
[2:15:54] he received the sign of circumcision
[2:15:57] a seal of what
[2:16:00] because after you receive the robe you
[2:16:02] must receive you must be sealed you must
[2:16:04] be anointed
[2:16:06] the holy ghost must come everybody
[2:16:08] philippians and be found in him
[2:16:11] not having my own
[2:16:14] which is of the
[2:16:16] but that which is through faith in
[2:16:19] of christ the righteousness which is of
[2:16:22] god by what
[2:16:23] you are washed you are robed in his
[2:16:26] righteousness and what followed them you
[2:16:29] must be anointed
[2:16:31] by that same word
[2:16:33] so their level
[2:16:34] is washing you
[2:16:36] putting you a robe
[2:16:38] and it's also built
[2:16:40] to fill you
[2:16:45] mark 10 and jesus said unto them you
[2:16:48] know not what you ask can you drink of
[2:16:51] the cup that i drink off
[2:16:53] and can you baptize with the baptism
[2:16:55] that i'm baptized with
[2:16:57] and they say unto him we can
[2:17:00] and jesus said unto them you shall
[2:17:02] indeed drink of the cup or that i drink
[2:17:06] off in other words you're going to
[2:17:07] suffer like me
[2:17:09] amen
[2:17:10] and with the baptism that i'm baptized
[2:17:13] with her shall he be what
[2:17:16] so if i suffer for christ
[2:17:19] i must also be filled
[2:17:23] it's not one way
[2:17:25] i cannot suffer and you don't feel me
[2:17:28] you say if i'm suffering for you
[2:17:30] i must also be filled it's a promise
[2:17:33] we are not only entitled to the
[2:17:35] suffering but we are also entitled to
[2:17:38] the spirit
[2:17:39] so you can't give me one and leave the

[2:29:59] keep it upright so that any who travel
[2:30:02] by my love to come in and fellowship
[2:30:05] with you have such a sweet spirit till
[2:30:08] you can reach out a hand to anyone and
[2:30:11] offer them help no matter how far they
[2:30:14] are down in a gather that is what they
[2:30:16] stand for a shrine of grace of god
[2:30:21] everybody here so far
[2:30:23] now let's
[2:30:24] head up and keep put your seat belt so
[2:30:26] we can go to the landing
[2:30:28] amen
[2:30:30] exodus 38 verse 8 and he made the level
[2:30:34] of brass
[2:30:35] when moses made the lever he needed the
[2:30:38] material the material was brass
[2:30:41] okay
[2:30:42] who gave him the material
[2:30:46] and he made the level of brass
[2:30:49] and the foot of it of brass of the
[2:30:52] looking glass of the
[2:31:01] so the lever that was built in the
[2:31:04] temple
[2:31:05] came from material from women
[2:31:10] and it was the looking glass of women
[2:31:13] because in the old time they used brass
[2:31:16] that was well polished when you look
[2:31:19] it's like a mirror
[2:31:21] so when moses was looking for the
[2:31:23] offering
[2:31:24] to make the lever
[2:31:26] the men didn't move
[2:31:34] it was the sisters
[2:31:36] they had some mirror
[2:31:38] that they used for their personal care
[2:31:47] those mirrors
[2:31:48] were individual mirrors
[2:31:54] that they use in their home
[2:31:58] when they take a shower they groom
[2:32:00] themselves they check themselves in that
[2:32:03] mirror
[2:32:04] before they come out
[2:32:07] and they took that tool
[2:32:09] and brought it to moses
[2:32:13] and moses took the mirror from this
[2:32:15] woman
[2:32:16] from this woman from this church
[2:32:19] from this church
[2:32:21] from this church
[2:32:22] from luther
[2:32:24] from paul
[2:32:25] from aurenus from columba
[2:32:28] from mountain and he blended all those
[2:32:31] mirrors together and he came up with a
[2:32:34] lever
[2:32:35] [Applause]
[2:32:37] so that level
[2:32:38] is a multimirror level
[2:32:45] it's a constellation level
[2:32:48] it's a level with seven
[2:32:51] angels
[2:32:54] and when they blend together
[2:32:56] you see who
[2:32:58] crushed
[2:33:03] of these looking glasses of the women
[2:33:06] assembling which assembly at the
[2:33:09] door
[2:33:10] of the weapon
[2:33:12] and that level was put where at the door
[2:33:15] so the women say this is our spot here
[2:33:19] so let's take our personal mirror let's
[2:33:23] put it here
[2:33:27] so the seal brass was not only a pool
[2:33:30] with water but it was also a mirror that
[2:33:34] when you get to that water
[2:33:36] if you want to enter the priest can stop
[2:33:38] by
[2:33:43] okay then he gets to the church
[2:33:47] if a woman is coming she can stand by
[2:33:49] and
[2:33:53] it's a mirror
[2:33:56] hallelujah
[2:33:59] buckle up
[2:34:00] james one for if any be a hearing
[2:34:04] of the word
[2:34:05] and not a doer he's like a man beholding
[2:34:09] his natural face in her
[2:34:15] this message is perfectly aligned with
[2:34:17] the scripture
[2:34:20] hallelujah
[2:34:22] second commenting but we all with open
[2:34:25] face
[2:34:27] beholding us in uh we're looking at the
[2:34:30] level
[2:34:31] when you're looking at the message when
[2:34:33] you're looking in the world you are
[2:34:35] looking at the sea of glass
[2:34:38] everybody clear as beholding a glass the
[2:34:41] water
[2:34:42] the glory of god
[2:34:45] so when you put yourself on the message
[2:34:47] you don't see you
[2:34:50] you're seeing something
[2:34:52] but that something is you
[2:34:53] [Applause]

[2:41:35] keep calm you're gonna hear the
[2:41:37] the wheel hit the
[2:41:41] and then a safe landing amen and
[2:41:45] beholding as in the glass the glory of
[2:41:48] god are changed into the same
[2:41:52] image the image you're looking at is
[2:41:55] actually transforming you
[2:41:59] that's why you're not the same person
[2:42:01] you used to be
[2:42:02] after a while you turn around you say
[2:42:04] hey i was battling with that thing but
[2:42:06] it's gone i don't know when he left me
[2:42:08] all i know
[2:42:10] i'm not even upset anymore the way i
[2:42:13] used to be because you are looking in
[2:42:15] the sea of glass and the image you're
[2:42:17] looking at is changing you from glory
[2:42:21] to glory even as by the what spirit of
[2:42:26] the lord
[2:42:27] [Applause]
[2:42:29] proverbs 27 as in water
[2:42:33] face answer to what
[2:42:36] what was in the sea of glass
[2:42:38] so when you look there
[2:42:40] the face is talking to the face
[2:42:43] in the water
[2:42:44] saw the what
[2:42:47] the heart of man to who
[2:42:49] so when you look in there something is
[2:42:51] talking to your heart
[2:42:54] hallelujah

[2:43:04] know you know to your own self how that
[2:43:07] jesus christ is in you except you be
[2:43:10] reprobate
[2:43:11] that's why we constantly come before the
[2:43:13] mirror before the level to examine
[2:43:16] ourself
[2:43:17] amen because the breasts represent
[2:43:20] divine
[2:43:21] judgment if they represent divine
[2:43:23] judgment and he was sitting over there
[2:43:26] so judgment must begin well
[2:43:33] hallelujah
[2:43:35] slay orderly old young both made and
[2:43:38] little children and women but come not
[2:43:40] near any man upon whom is the mark and
[2:43:43] begin at ma
[2:43:45] you just begin at the house of the lord
[2:43:48] that's why peter said for the time has
[2:43:50] come that judgment the sea of glass
[2:43:53] must begin at the house of god and it
[2:43:57] and
[2:43:58] if it first began at
[2:44:00] us we were judged first but when you
[2:44:03] receive him you pass from death unto
[2:44:06] never to be judged again
[2:44:10] when you're standing before it it's not
[2:44:11] to be judged anymore it's just to wash
[2:44:14] your extremities
[2:44:15] and make sure your tie is good
[2:44:19] hallelujah
[2:44:20] hallelujah what shall the end of them of
[2:44:24] the end be of them that obey not the
[2:44:26] gospel of god
[2:44:27] amen
[2:44:29] the party the
[2:44:31] go ye out from dance touch not unclean
[2:44:33] thing go head from the midst of her be
[2:44:36] clean that bear the vessels of the lord
[2:44:39] the new priesthood god wants you to keep
[2:44:41] yourself
[2:44:42] clean
[2:44:44] but not being made free from now bring
[2:44:46] bread free from sin and become servant
[2:44:49] of god ye have your fruit unto holiness
[2:44:52] and the end everlasting life having
[2:44:54] therefore these promises dear beloved
[2:44:56] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[2:44:58] filthiness of the flesh and spirit
[2:45:01] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[2:45:04] for god has not called us unto
[2:45:06] uncleanness but unto what
[2:45:09] that's why we have to keep our vessel
[2:45:10] clean
[2:45:11] i want to look at me and i want you to
[2:45:14] look at yourself and as we look into
[2:45:17] god's great mirror
[2:45:19] of his word be able to identify ourself
[2:45:23] with some that we're going to speak to
[2:45:26] speak about some of the character of the
[2:45:28] other time like the woman
[2:45:31] should look in the mirror of god and she
[2:45:33] found herself
[2:45:34] because this breaking of the seven seal
[2:45:38] he broke to do what to make you
[2:45:40] preached and to make you king
[2:45:43] because our priesthood
[2:45:45] our high priest
[2:45:47] is priest
[2:45:48] and he is also king
[2:45:51] hallelujah
[2:45:53] let's land with revelation 20.
[2:45:58] because if i continue
[2:46:00] we'll stay here longer
[2:46:02] brother branham said
[2:46:04] the opening of the seventh seal

[2:46:24] and i saw thrones
[2:46:26] and they sat and they that sat upon them
[2:46:28] and judgment was given to them and i saw
[2:46:31] the souls of them that were beheaded for
[2:46:33] the witness of jesus and for the word of
[2:46:35] god and which had not worshipped the
[2:46:38] beast neither his image neither have
[2:46:40] received his mark upon their forehead or
[2:46:42] their hand and they live and reign with
[2:46:45] christ a thousand a year
[2:46:48] watch verse five but the rest of the
[2:46:51] dead
[2:46:52] leave not again until the thousand years
[2:46:55] were finished this is the first
[2:46:58] resurrection
[2:47:00] verse 6
[2:47:01] blessed
[2:47:02] and holy
[2:47:04] is he
[2:47:05] that has part in the first resurrection
[2:47:08] on such the second death has no power
[2:47:12] but
[2:47:13] there shall be
[2:47:15] priests
[2:47:17] of god
[2:47:18] and of christ and shall do what
[2:47:22] they are prison king

[2:49:47] father that we were nothing but
[2:49:49] supernatural being that are experiencing
[2:49:53] a natural experience here temporary to
[2:49:56] gain character so that we can go back
[2:49:59] where we came from father made this
[2:50:01] anchor
[2:50:02] in the soul of your children
[2:50:05] that they will always remember that's no
