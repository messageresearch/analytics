[14:00] you
[14:02] amen God bless you it's good to be
[14:05] together on the first day of 2023 it's
[14:09] hard to imagine I wrote it on the top of
[14:10] my paper and I said it can't be but it
[14:13] is amen let's just take a minute and bow
[14:16] our heads together and praying
[14:19] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[14:21] for the privilege of being here
[14:24] God for us it's a turning of a calendar
[14:26] for us it's the beginning of a new cycle
[14:29] of time
[14:31] God we look back over the last year and
[14:33] recognize how faithful you've been to us
[14:36] for it's you who've kept us we've not
[14:38] kept ourselves
[14:40] you're the one who continually brings us
[14:42] Lord through every trial and every
[14:44] circumstance you're the one who brings
[14:46] us back here this morning Lord drawing
[14:48] us to yourself once again to Worship You
[14:51] Lord in spirit and in truth and God we
[14:54] want to give you praise and thanksgiving
[14:56] for all you do for us for God you're so
[14:59] precious to us Lord we ask God that you
[15:02] would now take your preeminence Among Us
[15:04] Lord that you would sit at the head of
[15:06] the table and break the bread and that
[15:08] you would feed us by your own hand for
[15:10] we've come to receive from you because
[15:12] you're the one that we want to feed from
[15:15] God we trust in you we thank you God for
[15:18] what you're doing in our lives and we're
[15:20] looking forward to what you'll continue
[15:21] to do Lord as you finish this last work
[15:24] that you're doing Lord that this last
[15:27] display of yourself in Bride form God
[15:30] may you have preeminence in us to finish
[15:32] your work that work that you left for
[15:34] this specific time may you do it now
[15:37] through each of us as we yield to your
[15:39] hand in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[15:42] amen
[15:43] amen God bless you while we're standing
[15:45] let's turn to the book of Acts
[15:49] chapter
[15:50] 15 Acts chapter 15.
[15:58] Acts chapter 15 and we'll read verse 18.
[16:01] I want to take a minute and just wish
[16:03] you a happy New Year amen and pray God's
[16:06] blessings be upon each one of you you
[16:09] know the world is full of uncertainty
[16:11] and there's no sure thing it seems like
[16:13] in the world anymore but we're certain
[16:15] amen we've got we've been established
[16:18] upon the word of God we are on a rock of
[16:20] Revelation and that revelation will not
[16:23] change that word of God will not change
[16:25] well God is determined to do in this
[16:28] coming year he will do amen and he has a
[16:32] plan and we are included in that plan so
[16:35] we're thankful for that I also would
[16:36] like to welcome some visitors we have
[16:38] brother Sergey and sister Julia from
[16:40] Idaho God bless you Sister Julia's
[16:42] brother ilya's sister so it's good to
[16:44] have you and your family here amen it's
[16:47] a good time it's good to see so many of
[16:48] you back I know the crowd was thin a few
[16:50] weeks ago because we had sickness
[16:52] sweeping through every kind of virus and
[16:54] cold and everything was going on at the
[16:56] same time but praise God we're here
[16:58] together amen so it's good to see you
[17:01] all
[17:01] I told I think it was one of the deacons
[17:03] I said when finally everybody's well and
[17:06] back it would be like Revival meetings
[17:07] it'll be like a camp meeting to have
[17:09] everybody back in the building together
[17:11] again
[17:12] amen but let's read this scripture and
[17:13] then we'll move on
[17:15] Acts chapter 15 verse 18.
[17:20] known unto God are all his works
[17:23] from the beginning of the world Amen you
[17:27] can have your seats we'll ask the Lord
[17:29] to bless us as we look into his word and
[17:32] and I want to title this if I can the
[17:35] changing of times
[17:37] I mean we know uh brother bam has some
[17:39] things to say about this and we'll look
[17:40] into that but I want to go to Acts
[17:43] chapter 17 together while we have our
[17:45] Bibles open Acts chapter 17.
[17:48] and I'm going to pick up a scripture in
[17:50] verse 22.
[17:55] Acts chapter 17 verse 22 says then Paul
[17:58] stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said
[18:01] you men of Athens I perceived it in all
[18:03] things you are too superstitious
[18:05] first I passed by and beheld your
[18:07] devotions I found an altar with this
[18:09] inscription to the unknown God whom
[18:12] therefore you ignorantly worship Him
[18:15] declare I unto you God that made the
[18:18] world and all things there and seeing
[18:20] that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth
[18:21] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[18:23] neither is worshiped with men's hands as
[18:26] though he needeth anything seeing he
[18:28] giveth to all life and breath and all
[18:30] things and hath made of one blood all
[18:33] nations of men for to dwell on the face
[18:35] of the Earth and hath determined the
[18:37] times before appointed and the bounds of
[18:40] their habitation
[18:42] amen so we see here that God has
[18:46] appointed determined the times before
[18:49] appointed and the bounds of their
[18:50] habitation and Paul is declaring this to
[18:53] the Gentiles he's bringing the message
[18:54] to the Gentiles but he's letting them
[18:56] know this one that you worship is the
[18:58] unknown God he's the one that's
[19:00] appointed your habitation your bounds
[19:02] and your time amen and time is in his
[19:04] hand time is the creation of God God
[19:07] created it he controls it amen he knows
[19:10] when and how he'll do everything he
[19:12] intends to do so the time it was a
[19:15] before appointed of God brother Graham
[19:18] says nothing's out of kilter
[19:19] everything's just ticking right on time
[19:21] with God God hasn't uh forgotten
[19:24] anything he hasn't misplaced anything
[19:26] nothing's happening outside of his
[19:28] ordination of his ordering it so so
[19:31] everything is just as it should be amen
[19:34] so we know who controls the time
[19:37] and the message Shalom from 1964 brother
[19:40] Ben says changing the pages or changing
[19:42] calendars doesn't change time
[19:45] you know for us you know we have that
[19:47] marker you know that every year we've
[19:49] been counting years and uh counting from
[19:52] 2022 to 2023 and and and we do this
[19:56] counting and for us it's a marker of
[19:58] time it's a cycle of time we're moving
[20:00] into another cycle but that's not
[20:03] exactly how God looks at time amen
[20:05] because man's calendars have changed
[20:07] over time we've had the Julian calendar
[20:09] and the Roman Calendar there was a
[20:11] Jewish calendar and Babylonian calendar
[20:13] amen but God is Not determined he's not
[20:16] he's not uh waiting for our calendar to
[20:19] turn he has his own keeping of time he's
[20:22] got his own appointed time
[20:24] so the changing the pages uh the
[20:26] counting doesn't change time so the
[20:28] question is what does change time
[20:30] I mean we look at the changing of times
[20:33] it's not just changing the calendar it's
[20:35] not even marking another Sunrise
[20:37] although that's how we keep time amen
[20:39] but for God he marks times he marks
[20:43] Seasons he's got an appointed time
[20:45] appointed seasons and dispensations and
[20:48] how does God change time
[20:50] it's not the flipping of a calendar so
[20:52] I'll read that again changing the pages
[20:55] or uh uh changing Pages or changing
[20:58] calendars doesn't change time a lot of
[21:00] people say well the old Year's gone
[21:01] throw away the old December calendar now
[21:03] put up the uh the other one a new year
[21:05] and that's what New Year's means to them
[21:08] I thought of this quote as yesterday I
[21:09] took down last year's calendar amen last
[21:12] night I put up the new calendar so in
[21:14] the morning it would read the right time
[21:15] amen for us that's significant but for
[21:19] God there's another turning of pages
[21:21] another changing of times that's more
[21:23] significant than the flipping of a
[21:25] calendar amen and and that's why we we
[21:28] may be able to know what year it is and
[21:31] it's important for us to know uh what
[21:33] what time we're in Naturally Speaking
[21:36] because so many things are based on
[21:38] calendar dates and times and seasons and
[21:40] for our natural life we need to know
[21:42] what year you're in if you're going to
[21:44] fill out a check you got to put the
[21:45] right date we need to know where we're
[21:47] at but spiritually speaking we must know
[21:49] where we're at In God's Time amen
[21:52] so it's important
[21:54] so he says he goes on to say to me I
[21:57] want to see what's promised for the day
[21:58] I want to know what the light of the
[22:01] hour is so I can know how to walk in it
[22:03] I want to know where I'm living what age
[22:05] I'm in how far up the road I am amen and
[22:10] thank God that God has changed times for
[22:13] us and he's given us a way to see his
[22:15] calendar
[22:17] by the grace of God he's let he's let us
[22:19] he's let his bride see his calendar so
[22:22] many people have missed down through
[22:24] time they've missed the changing of
[22:26] God's calendar
[22:28] I'm just saying that you know as a typer
[22:30] I don't know that God went over and
[22:31] flipped the calendar but the changing of
[22:33] times and dispensational times and
[22:36] changing of Ages God brought the change
[22:38] and so many people missed the flip of
[22:41] the calendar and they don't know how to
[22:42] live and they're missing the
[22:44] appointments they're missing the
[22:45] appointed time because they're still
[22:47] looking at an old calendar they're still
[22:49] back in a previous dispensation amen but
[22:52] we need to know where God is in time
[22:54] where we are on God's time amen so that
[22:57] we know how to conduct ourselves because
[22:59] there's certain things that are
[23:01] important appointed for certain seasons
[23:04] there's certain time pieces and markers
[23:07] on God's calendar amen where certain
[23:09] things are to be accomplished in certain
[23:11] seasons and in certain ages and if we
[23:13] don't know where we're at amen we're
[23:15] trying to do God a service in the wrong
[23:17] dispensation and we're not accomplishing
[23:19] what God once accomplished in this day
[23:21] we're doing a work that God wanted in a
[23:24] previous age but he wants us to do
[23:26] something different in this age
[23:29] so it's important to keep up with God's
[23:32] changing calendar
[23:34] let's go to Galatians chapter 4.
[23:39] I'm just gonna take a look through the
[23:41] Bible here
[23:42] at this subject what we're referring to
[23:48] Galatians chapter 4.
[23:51] and verse 3.
[23:58] Paul the Apostle writes in Galatians 4 3
[24:01] even so we when we were children were in
[24:04] bondage under the elements of the world
[24:06] but when the fullness of the time was
[24:08] come God sent forth his son made of a
[24:11] woman made under the law so there was a
[24:15] certain time that Christ would come
[24:18] and when the fullness of time or when
[24:21] the completion of that age when it was
[24:23] time for that age to come in the
[24:26] fullness of time amen he sent forth his
[24:28] son amen he's not saying here that when
[24:31] all time is completely run out no when
[24:33] it comes to the fullness of that age
[24:35] when it's time now for God to turn the
[24:37] calendar amen he sent forth his son
[24:40] so God there's ages and dispensations
[24:43] amen in times and Seasons with God and
[24:47] God knows when they start and God knows
[24:49] when they end and he knows how to turn
[24:51] the calendar to indicate we're moving
[24:53] from one age to the next age amen and
[24:55] when the fullness of time on God's
[24:58] calendar came amen he sent his son
[25:01] but he's gone let's go to Mark chapter
[25:04] one
[25:14] Mark chapter 1 and verse 1.
[25:23] Mark 1 and 1. in the beginning of the
[25:27] Gospel of Jesus Christ the son of God as
[25:30] it is written in the prophets behold I
[25:32] send my messenger before thy face which
[25:34] shall prepare the way before Thee the
[25:37] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[25:38] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[25:41] path straight John did baptize in the
[25:43] wilderness and preached and preached the
[25:46] baptism of repentance for the remission
[25:48] of sins and there went out unto him all
[25:50] the land of Judea and day of Jerusalem
[25:52] and were all baptized of him in the
[25:54] river of Jordan confessing their sins
[25:57] and John was closed with camel's hair
[25:59] and with a girdle of skin about his
[26:02] loins and he did eat locusts and wild
[26:03] honey and preached saying there cometh
[26:06] one mightier than I after me the latchet
[26:09] of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop
[26:11] down and unloose I indeed have baptized
[26:14] you with water but he shall baptize you
[26:16] with the Holy Ghost amen so now John
[26:21] comes according to the scriptures
[26:23] because we've come to the fullness of
[26:26] time and it's time for God to flip his
[26:28] calendar
[26:30] it's time to go from one age or one
[26:32] dispensation to another and God has had
[26:34] ages and dispensations all the way down
[26:37] through amen and now it's time but the
[26:40] way that God flips his calendar is he
[26:43] sends somebody who can catch the message
[26:46] for the hour and deliver the message and
[26:48] that's how God transitions from one age
[26:50] to another
[26:52] so when God now is transitioning amen
[26:55] from law to Grace now he brings John the
[26:57] Baptist according to the promise there
[27:00] must be one that comes and prepares the
[27:02] way and so John is here for the flipping
[27:05] of the calendar for the changing of
[27:07] times amen so he he Faithfully declares
[27:11] his message and John now they come and
[27:13] ask him are you the Christ and he denies
[27:15] that and he tells him who he is in the
[27:17] scripture and but John now is not
[27:19] pointing to himself he's here to get
[27:22] them to see what's coming in this age
[27:24] he's saying but there's one coming who's
[27:27] mightier than I amen I'm here to
[27:29] indicate a change in dispensation amen
[27:32] but this change in dispensation is all
[27:35] about the one I'm for running
[27:38] amen amen we know this this is the day
[27:41] that we live and amen we're right here I
[27:43] mean the Bible is repeated in our day
[27:45] we've had a forerunner come to indicate
[27:48] that God is turning the page of his a
[27:50] Bible again he's turning the page of his
[27:52] calendar again amen and catch the
[27:54] changing of dispensation or the changing
[27:57] of age amen when the Forerunner comes on
[28:00] the scene uh John the Baptist even says
[28:02] in one place there's one standing among
[28:04] you now amen and well how did he know
[28:06] there was one standing among them now
[28:08] because he was there Amen to make
[28:11] straight his paths he was there to
[28:13] declare in the changing and dispensation
[28:15] and he told them there's one here now
[28:18] amen the what we're turning to is here
[28:22] amen and though John was there as an
[28:25] indication of the change of time amen so
[28:28] many missed the changing of the calendar
[28:31] they didn't they didn't want amen time
[28:34] to move on I don't mean time is in well
[28:37] we know time they didn't want time to
[28:39] move in God's timepiece amen they were
[28:42] content staying where they were amen
[28:44] there was a whole slew of people that
[28:46] were happy with religion with the
[28:47] religious order and the way things were
[28:49] structured amen they didn't want to
[28:52] change at least they didn't want to
[28:53] change the way God wanted to change
[28:56] they wanted to go to another age but
[28:59] they wanted to go straight to the age
[29:01] where the Victor would come in push out
[29:03] the Romans set up the kingdom and all of
[29:05] that but they didn't understand God's
[29:08] turning of a page amen and didn't want
[29:10] to turn and God's appointed time they
[29:12] wanted to jump to the time they wanted
[29:17] amen
[29:18] and so when God comes to fulfill his
[29:21] word in an unexpected way
[29:23] it was an appointed time
[29:25] nothing was going to change it was going
[29:27] to happen anyways
[29:29] but they didn't want to go from this
[29:32] turning of the calendar to the next they
[29:35] would love to have went from this one to
[29:37] one way off in the future
[29:39] but God had sent
[29:42] he had sent according to his word a
[29:45] forerunner a prophet a man who was there
[29:48] to indicate the changing of time
[29:52] brother Branham says
[29:55] the first time we were called Saints of
[29:57] course when the New Testament terms we'd
[30:00] have to go back to the first of the New
[30:01] Testament John the Baptist stood between
[30:03] law and Grace he was a prophet the
[30:05] Forerunner of Jesus Christ which was the
[30:08] bridge between the law dispensation and
[30:10] the grace dispensation
[30:12] so here John the Baptist is standing
[30:14] there as a bridge Amen to move from one
[30:17] dispensation to another
[30:20] and we we recognize that there was
[30:23] people who were following John the
[30:25] Baptist they were caught a hold of his
[30:26] ministry and understood him to be a
[30:28] prophet amen and and they understood he
[30:31] was a forerunner in the changing of of
[30:33] dispensations and all of that but you
[30:36] realize that there were some of those
[30:37] who never got off the bridge
[30:40] they got on the bridge from one
[30:42] dispensation to another but they never
[30:45] got off the bridge they stayed on the
[30:47] bridge amen because when Paul met them
[30:49] they didn't even know whether their be a
[30:50] holy ghost when they when some of them
[30:52] came to Jesus asking if he were him or
[30:55] should he send another one I mean they
[30:57] were still with John they believed John
[30:59] amen but they didn't catch the it was
[31:02] like the calendar got stuck straight up
[31:04] and it didn't flip all the way over
[31:07] and he was there to bridge from one
[31:10] dispensation into another dispensation
[31:12] so that they would move from one into
[31:15] the other not so that they would stay
[31:18] stuck in a gap
[31:22] it was so that they would Bridge their
[31:24] way over
[31:25] and then the same things happen to us in
[31:27] this day there's been another Bridge
[31:29] that's come in the breach
[31:32] was the breach a gap in the wall
[31:35] who's the man that's going to stand in
[31:37] the Gap to be the Bridge from from one
[31:39] dispensation to another dispensation
[31:41] it'll be another Forerunner amen but he
[31:44] didn't come standing in the Gap so that
[31:46] we would come and stand in the Gap but
[31:48] he came so we can move and transition in
[31:51] God's time from one time to another time
[31:53] from one age to another age you know
[31:57] amen let's go to let's look here again
[32:00] further in Mark chapter one let's go
[32:01] down to verse 45.
[32:06] no I'm sorry
[32:08] I want to go to verse 14.
[32:10] let's go to verse 14.
[32:15] um Mark 1 14 and now after that John was
[32:18] put in prison
[32:20] Jesus came into Galilee preaching the
[32:22] gospel of the kingdom of God and saying
[32:24] the time is fulfilled
[32:26] and the kingdom of God is at hand repent
[32:29] ye and believe the gospel so after John
[32:32] after John was in prison Here Comes
[32:35] Jesus now preaching saying the time is
[32:37] fulfilled amen the calendar is flipped
[32:39] have you made the transition
[32:43] amen let's look over at Matthew 13 now
[32:56] Matthew 13.
[32:59] and verse 16.
[33:04] Matthew 13 and 16.
[33:06] he says but blessed are your eyes for
[33:08] they see
[33:09] in your ears for they hear for verily I
[33:12] say unto you that many prophets and
[33:14] righteous men have desired to see those
[33:16] things which you see and have not seen
[33:18] them and to hear those things which you
[33:20] hear and have not heard them
[33:23] Jesus is now indicating that you are in
[33:27] the dispensation of seeing and hearing
[33:30] the the time is fulfilled the gospel the
[33:34] kingdom is present you are now in the
[33:37] time of seeing and hearing and many
[33:39] prophets and righteous men of old have
[33:41] longed to see your day but they couldn't
[33:43] because they were in another place in
[33:45] the calendar
[33:46] they were not able to see no matter how
[33:49] much they wanted to see they couldn't
[33:51] see until God flipped the calendar they
[33:54] were looking at these things afar off
[33:55] amen they were seeing them in types and
[33:57] in Shadows and in prophecies and longing
[34:00] to know when and longing to see and they
[34:02] were earnestly Desiring to to know when
[34:05] these things would be but Jesus is now
[34:07] standing to a group of people saying
[34:09] listen now there's there was a whole
[34:11] group of prophets down Through the Ages
[34:13] and righteous men who longed to see what
[34:15] you've seen But blessed are your eyes
[34:17] because you're here in the appointed
[34:20] time you're here when God changed the
[34:23] time amen can you cross over the bridge
[34:25] amen can you see and can you hear what
[34:28] time it is
[34:30] he said they're blessed others wanted to
[34:32] be there but they couldn't get there and
[34:34] it goes to show that you can't you can't
[34:36] surprise supersede God's appointed time
[34:38] you can't get ahead of God's time amen
[34:41] you can't go until God goes you can't
[34:43] open until God opens amen
[34:47] so let's look at Galatians chapter one
[34:48] now
[34:57] Galatians chapter one
[35:04] in verse 13.
[35:11] this Apostle Paul now giving his
[35:13] testimony in verse 13 He says for you
[35:15] have heard of my conversion in time past
[35:17] in the Jews religion have that beyond
[35:19] measure I persecuted the Church of God
[35:21] and I wasted it and profited in a Jewish
[35:24] religion above many mind equals in my
[35:26] own Nation being more exceedingly
[35:28] zealous of the traditions of my fathers
[35:31] but when it pleased God who separated me
[35:33] from my mother's womb and called me by
[35:35] his grace to reveal his son and me that
[35:38] I might preach him among the Heathen
[35:39] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[35:42] and blood neither when I up to Jerusalem
[35:44] to them which were Apostles before me
[35:46] but I went to Arabia and returned again
[35:48] unto Damascus so here the Apostle Paul
[35:51] sharing his testimony and he says when
[35:53] it pleased God when it please gone when
[35:56] the time was right and it was God's
[35:58] appointed time the one who separated me
[36:01] from my mother's womb and called me by
[36:03] his grace amen he separated me out into
[36:06] a work when it pleased him amen Paul
[36:09] never called himself God Called Paul
[36:13] God Paul never appointed the time of his
[36:16] birth God appointed the time of his
[36:18] birth and separated him from his
[36:19] mother's womb and watched over his life
[36:22] and knew exactly when he would call him
[36:24] because God has an appointed time for
[36:26] every dispensation in every Age and and
[36:29] Paul was moving along doing his thing
[36:31] the best he knew how to do it but God
[36:34] had an appointed date and a time at the
[36:37] time stamp when he would come to Paul
[36:39] and he would grab a hold of Paul because
[36:41] Paul was going to be another bridge in
[36:44] dispensation to bring from one
[36:46] dispensation to another dispensation
[36:48] Paul was going to be there to transition
[36:51] from Jew to Gentile amen
[36:54] and so Paul never decided on his own it
[36:57] was time he never came to the Lord and
[36:59] said it's time God knew when it was time
[37:01] and he knew when to get a hold of Paul
[37:03] and then he was going to use Paul's
[37:05] Ministry to turn the page of the
[37:07] calendar
[37:08] praise be to God
[37:11] amen let's look at Acts chapter 13.
[37:28] Acts chapter 13.
[37:32] in verse 46.
[37:36] when Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said
[37:38] it was necessary that the word of God
[37:40] should first have been spoken to you but
[37:42] seeing you put it from you and judge
[37:44] yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[37:46] Lo we turn to the Gentiles right here is
[37:49] marking a turning
[37:51] amen it's a marking in time and it's a
[37:54] necessary part of the Turning of the
[37:57] calendar that it must first be preached
[37:59] into the Gentiles but because they deem
[38:02] themselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[38:04] Lord we turn to the Gentiles in listen
[38:06] to verse 47 for so hath the Lord
[38:08] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[38:11] be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[38:13] shouldest be for salvation to the ends
[38:15] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[38:17] this they were glad and glorified the
[38:19] word of the Lord and as many as were
[38:20] ordained to eternal life believed
[38:24] amen there was some sitting there that
[38:26] were ordained to eternal life but they
[38:28] must see the dispensational change they
[38:31] must see the Forerunner come the one
[38:33] standing in the Gap the bridge between
[38:35] one dispensation and another and it was
[38:37] prophesied hey they knew that this would
[38:40] happen they knew they would turn to the
[38:41] Gentiles because God had already told
[38:43] them you're going to fulfill the
[38:46] prophecy of Isaiah
[38:48] so there's a scripture laying there and
[38:50] it's time now for this for this
[38:53] scripture to go into effect amen so God
[38:55] calls Paul and he connects Paul with
[38:58] with Isaiah and he brings these two
[39:01] things together in an appointed time
[39:03] because he's turning his calendar now
[39:06] he's moving from Jews unto Gentiles he's
[39:09] going to start collecting his Gentile
[39:10] bride and he's going to bring somebody
[39:13] to indicate the changing of time he's
[39:15] bringing a prophet a messenger on the
[39:17] scene and that's the Apostle Paul
[39:19] and when you look at this God is the one
[39:22] who's doing all of it these men are just
[39:24] yielding themselves to God but they
[39:26] couldn't control the changing of time
[39:28] they couldn't control the season that
[39:30] they were in God was in absolute control
[39:34] the prophecies were dictating God's uh
[39:37] God's God's Own desire and own knowledge
[39:40] foreknowledge was indicating when this
[39:42] would happen so Paul was born at the
[39:44] right time called at the right time amen
[39:46] he went unto the uh to the the Jews and
[39:49] the Jews rejected him and he turned to
[39:51] the Gentiles marking a change in
[39:53] dispensation amen and all of this was
[39:55] according to the scripture and it all
[39:57] marked God's time but listen to the
[40:01] response of the the Gentiles
[40:03] he says and when the Gentiles heard this
[40:05] they were glad and glorified the word of
[40:09] the Lord and as many as were ordained to
[40:11] eternal life believed
[40:13] there were some that were there waiting
[40:17] waiting for this dispensation
[40:21] waiting for this time they were ordained
[40:24] for this hour they were ordained for
[40:26] this season amen they were not to be
[40:28] proselyte Jews but they were to be
[40:30] bribed
[40:31] there were Gentiles with a sieging of
[40:34] Life ordained into eternal life waiting
[40:37] there and what were they waiting for
[40:38] they were waiting for an indication that
[40:40] the calendar is turned amen and when
[40:42] Paul indicated that this is the Turning
[40:44] of the calendar because you reject
[40:47] eternal life Lo we turn to the Gentiles
[40:49] for the scripture says amen and those
[40:51] with eternal life they believed
[40:55] they were glad they rejoiced because now
[40:58] they recognize this is my day
[41:01] this is the age that I was born for
[41:05] amen let's go to Romans chapter 11.
[41:09] and look at another
[41:12] dispensation
[41:18] Romans
[41:20] 11 and 25.
[41:27] this is Paul talking about the blinding
[41:29] of the Jews amen and so that they would
[41:31] reject their Messiah so that he could
[41:33] turn into the Gentiles and he says here
[41:35] in verse 25 for I would not Brethren
[41:38] that you should be ignorant of this
[41:40] mystery unless you should be wise in
[41:42] your own conceits that blindness in part
[41:44] has happened to Israel until
[41:48] that's another marker of time
[41:50] until the fullness of the Gentiles
[41:54] become in
[41:56] Paul is saying this blindness has come
[41:58] to the Jews for a purpose and it has a
[42:01] designated period of time this is
[42:03] another timepiece with God that
[42:05] blindness has come to the Jews until the
[42:09] fullness of the Gentiles become in but
[42:11] when the fullness of the Gentiles become
[42:13] in God will once again use prophetic
[42:15] Ministry he'll use two witnesses Amen to
[42:18] to Open the Eyes of the Jews
[42:21] so God is the one turning the calendar
[42:23] amen but how is he indicating that the
[42:26] times have changed he's using people
[42:29] he's using prophets he's using his
[42:31] prophecy being fulfilled in men Amen to
[42:34] indicate that we're moving from one
[42:36] dispensation to another dispensation
[42:39] he did this in Noah in Noah's time he
[42:43] was moving he was transitioning in
[42:44] Abraham's time he was transitioning and
[42:47] Moses's time he was transitioning amen
[42:50] he was moving now in Abraham's day amen
[42:52] he was now selecting out a family he was
[42:55] going to follow a family and now in
[42:57] Moses day he's calling on a nation amen
[43:00] now he he moves all the way down through
[43:02] and he's indicating I'm changing my
[43:05] dispensation I'm changing my time and
[43:07] now we're operating now we're going to
[43:09] be operating a little differently than
[43:11] we operated before
[43:13] is that right because when he changed
[43:16] the times amen he changed his mode of
[43:19] operation amen and people had to get
[43:21] with the times to know how to serve God
[43:24] in the age in which they lived
[43:28] praise God let's look at Titus Chapter
[43:31] one I'm just laying all these in as a
[43:33] foundation and then we'll start moving a
[43:36] little faster well maybe I don't know
[43:39] I'm not good at making predictions
[43:41] anymore
[43:44] Titus
[43:46] chapter 1.
[43:48] verse 1.
[43:52] it says Titus 1 1 Paul a servant of God
[43:56] and an apostle of Jesus Christ according
[43:59] to the faith of God's elect and the
[44:01] acknowledgment of the truth which is
[44:02] after godliness
[44:04] in Hope of eternal life which God that
[44:06] cannot lie promised before the world
[44:08] began but hath in due times there we go
[44:13] again
[44:14] but hath in due time manifested his word
[44:17] through preaching which is committed
[44:19] unto me according to the Commandment of
[44:22] God our savior
[44:24] look at what Paul is saying
[44:26] he he there's been a hope there's been a
[44:30] a promise of God there's been a mystery
[44:32] of God Amen but half in due times that's
[44:37] God's appointed time when it was
[44:38] ordained and due but half and do times
[44:41] manifest his word through preaching
[44:44] which is committed unto me according to
[44:46] the Commandment of God Paul is actually
[44:49] saying that that my preaching is
[44:51] indicating the due time
[44:54] that in due time when then he would make
[44:57] it known by preaching so in due time
[44:59] he'd make it known by preaching and I'm
[45:02] the one doing the preaching showing that
[45:04] it is now due time
[45:07] what what a statement for a human being
[45:10] to make
[45:12] let's go to Acts chapter 17 now
[45:20] Acts chapter 17 verse 28.
[45:30] acts 17 28.
[45:34] it says for in him we live and move and
[45:37] have our being as certain also of your
[45:41] own poets have said for we are also his
[45:44] offspring for as much then as we are The
[45:47] Offspring of God we ought not to think
[45:49] that the godhead is likened to gold or
[45:51] silver or stone or Graven Graven by the
[45:54] art and man's devices
[45:56] and the times of this ignorance God
[45:59] winked at
[46:01] there's a Time indicator
[46:03] but the times of this ignorance God
[46:05] winked at but now commandeth all men
[46:08] everywhere to repent because he hath
[46:10] appointed a day in which he will judge
[46:12] the world in righteousness by that man
[46:14] whom he hath ordained wherefore he hath
[46:16] given Assurance unto all men and that he
[46:19] hath raised him from the dead
[46:21] Paul now is coming to the Gentiles this
[46:24] is part of the dialogue on Mars Hill
[46:26] he's standing there and he's talking to
[46:28] Gentiles and explaining to them the
[46:30] unknown God the one that appointed time
[46:33] and all of these things and he's saying
[46:35] this is how you worshiped in the past
[46:37] engraving images made in your own hands
[46:40] and that's not what God wants and in
[46:43] times past God winked at this amen but
[46:46] not anymore there's a change in
[46:48] dispensation and now what what was once
[46:51] acceptable is no longer acceptable
[46:53] anymore
[46:55] that's why amen if we want to serve God
[46:58] we must know the changing of God's time
[47:00] because the changing of God time always
[47:03] indicates how we worship God in this day
[47:07] when it changed when in Moses's day when
[47:10] Moses brought the law of God Amen that
[47:13] was now the proper way to approach unto
[47:15] God in that day but when it changed from
[47:18] law and to Grace amen under the ministry
[47:20] of Paul amen now you needed to know now
[47:23] this is the way to worship God we can't
[47:26] stay stuck back where we were just
[47:28] because it was acceptable before does
[47:30] not mean it's acceptable today
[47:33] so we must catch the changing of time
[47:35] but how do we catch the changing of time
[47:38] we must see the one God sent to indicate
[47:41] the mark the changing of time
[47:43] praise God
[47:45] now brother says in the evening
[47:47] messenger
[47:48] he says each messenger has had his
[47:51] message and the message in the messenger
[47:52] and the message
[47:54] and the messenger of the age it is most
[47:57] remarkable that each messenger we even
[47:59] found in the church ages and tonight
[48:01] we'll go back in the Old Testament and
[48:02] find that it's the same thing that God
[48:04] sends the messenger of that age at the
[48:07] end of the time always at the end never
[48:10] at the beginning
[48:11] at the end I'm going to mark this now as
[48:14] Luther's age faded out then Wesley's
[48:16] came in when Wesley's sanctification
[48:18] faded out Pentecost age came in it's
[48:21] always the messenger opens up the new
[48:23] message at the end of the old it's each
[48:25] age that's been done
[48:27] so is always comes at the end of the
[48:30] previous age Amen to bring what's what's
[48:33] the messenger doing I mean I don't just
[48:35] think of seven Church ages now all the
[48:38] way down through God's been sending us
[48:39] prophets and many times what they're
[48:41] doing is they're marking the end of one
[48:43] dispensation in the opening of another
[48:45] dispensation amen God sent Jeremiah Amen
[48:48] to indicate to them the end of their
[48:51] Sovereign rule in Israel and they were
[48:53] now moving into Babylon and he was there
[48:55] to tell them how to make the transition
[48:57] but they didn't want to believe him that
[48:59] they were transitioning into Babylon so
[49:01] they were rejecting him because they
[49:03] thought it's not possible but if they
[49:04] would have listened to him many lives
[49:06] would have been spared and they would
[49:07] have known how to conduct themselves
[49:09] because he was there bridging a gap
[49:12] between two dispensations amen and he
[49:14] was telling them how to get from one
[49:16] safely into the other and many of them
[49:19] completely missed it because they did
[49:21] not want it to be true
[49:24] the same thing all down through time
[49:26] they didn't want some of these
[49:28] dispensational changes to be true they
[49:31] wanted to stay where they were and be
[49:32] accepted where they were amen but in the
[49:35] dispensational change God may have
[49:37] winked at that for a time but it's not
[49:39] acceptable anymore amen now there's been
[49:42] a change in God's time and in a change
[49:44] in God's time in the new dispensation
[49:47] God has a way to be worshiped amen God
[49:50] has a way to be approached a way he's
[49:52] interacting with his people and in that
[49:54] change is the acceptable way
[49:58] praise God
[50:00] amen
[50:03] so
[50:05] brother banham now is going to begin
[50:08] pointing to the day that he's living in
[50:10] he's bringing it right home to where
[50:12] he's at
[50:14] and he's saying but let me tell you
[50:16] there will rise a messenger at the end
[50:18] of the Pentecostal age and wind up the
[50:21] thing it'll be a man
[50:24] will we know who that messenger is
[50:26] it's no mystery to us he's referring to
[50:29] his own Ministry but you know brother
[50:31] Branham could have no more made that the
[50:34] time
[50:35] then any of us can make any time the
[50:38] time you can't say well this is the time
[50:40] for that no God's the one who says it's
[50:42] time for that
[50:43] random couldn't indicate this is the
[50:46] time God's the one who marked that was
[50:47] the time amen and it was time for a
[50:49] dispensational change amen so God did
[50:52] what he always did when it was time for
[50:54] a change amen he brought a man on the
[50:57] scene that would indicate it's time for
[50:59] a change
[51:01] and and he says in the first seal
[51:05] he says then Along come the Pentecostal
[51:07] age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[51:08] and they cabbage down on that now they
[51:11] cannot be no more ages that's all of it
[51:13] that's the the or the laodicean age we
[51:17] found in the studying of the scripture
[51:18] that the messenger to the age come right
[51:20] at the end of the age every time so now
[51:22] he's in preaching the seals he's in the
[51:24] first seal to the messenger the age came
[51:26] right at the end of the age every time
[51:28] Paul came at the End of the Age we find
[51:30] out that Arenas came at the End of the
[51:32] Age Martin into the age Luther into the
[51:35] Catholic age and want Wesley at the end
[51:37] of the Luther age and Pentecost at the
[51:39] End of the Age of sanctification through
[51:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:43] and at the end of the Pentecostal age we
[51:46] are supposed to receive according to the
[51:47] word as God help me tonight to show you
[51:49] through here that to receive a messenger
[51:52] that will take all the Loose Ends out
[51:54] there and reveal the whole Secret Of God
[51:56] for the rapturing of the church
[51:59] what's he doing he's he's here in the
[52:01] first seal and he's telling you that
[52:03] every messenger came at the end of the
[52:04] age and we are supposed to receive at
[52:07] the end of the Pentecostal age a
[52:09] messenger amen someone who will tie
[52:11] together all the Loose Ends amen and
[52:14] reveal the whole Secret Of God for the
[52:16] rapturing of the church he's saying
[52:18] there's going to be another change in
[52:20] God's time
[52:22] and this change in God's time will be
[52:24] indicated by a messenger who will show
[52:26] up at the end of one amen and be a
[52:30] bridge unto the other is going to stand
[52:32] in the breach that's why he preach to
[52:34] breach
[52:36] amen praise God
[52:39] and and now
[52:42] the the question is will we stay on this
[52:46] side
[52:47] of the bridge
[52:48] are on this side of the bridge
[52:51] or are we going to stay somewhere on the
[52:53] bridge
[52:56] amen
[52:59] let's go to Ephesians chapter 3.
[53:12] Ephesians chapter 3.
[53:17] and verse 1.
[53:19] Ephesians 3 and 1. for this cause I Paul
[53:22] the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[53:24] Gentiles if you have heard of the
[53:26] dispensation of the grace of God which
[53:28] has given me to you word how that by
[53:30] Revelation he may known unto me the
[53:32] mystery as I wrote a four in few words
[53:34] whereby when you read you may understand
[53:37] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[53:40] which in other Ages was not made known
[53:42] Unto the Sons of men and it is as it is
[53:45] now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[53:47] Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[53:50] should be fellow heirs under the same
[53:52] body and partakers of the promise in
[53:53] Christ by the gospel whereof I was made
[53:56] a minister according to the gift of the
[53:58] grace of God given unto me by the
[54:00] effectual working of his power unto me
[54:03] who am less than the least of All Saints
[54:05] is this Grace given that I should preach
[54:07] among the Gentiles The unsearchable
[54:09] Riches of Christ and make all men see
[54:11] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[54:14] which from the beginning of the world
[54:15] have been hid in God who created All
[54:18] Things by Jesus Christ through the
[54:20] intent that now unto the principalities
[54:22] and powers in Heavenly places might be
[54:25] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[54:27] of God according to the Eternal purpose
[54:29] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[54:31] lord
[54:32] Paul is making an outstanding statement
[54:35] here Paul is saying that in the previous
[54:37] dispensations they didn't know these
[54:39] things that there was a truth that was
[54:41] hidden in God a mystery that God knew
[54:44] that that he had kept hidden this is now
[54:46] Paul's preaching now
[54:48] the mystery that God had that the
[54:50] Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of
[54:52] the same body amen and that mystery was
[54:54] unknown to those in previous ages amen
[54:57] showing that that God works through ages
[55:00] and God dispenses his understanding
[55:02] through ages that age it was withheld
[55:04] but Paul now is saying that in this age
[55:07] now this mystery is not withheld but I'm
[55:10] the one declaring what was in the back
[55:12] part of God's mind
[55:14] what they didn't know what the the part
[55:17] that Moses could not tell you amen the
[55:19] part that Jeremiah could not tell you
[55:21] the part that Isaiah could not say not
[55:23] what was hidden from them they saw it in
[55:26] symbols they saw it in time they saw it
[55:28] foreshadowed amen but now we're standing
[55:31] in the reality and now Paul say I am
[55:34] preaching this mystery to you
[55:36] amen and here he is a humble human being
[55:40] just a man and you can see how people
[55:42] would pass over it and pass over it and
[55:45] pass in his day Paul was a very rejected
[55:47] human being
[55:49] is that right Paul was very rejected
[55:51] rejected by the masses rejected by the
[55:54] Jews amen he even began to be rejected
[55:56] by some of the churches he planted
[55:58] rejected by some of the ministers that
[56:00] he ministered with some of the ministers
[56:02] he brought up amen now we're rejecting
[56:05] him
[56:06] but it didn't change who he was and it
[56:09] didn't change the fact that he was
[56:10] marking a change in dispensation and if
[56:13] you wanted to know what the
[56:14] dispensational change was you needed to
[56:17] listen to what Paul was preaching
[56:18] because Paul was preaching the mystery
[56:23] so there was people who were staying on
[56:26] one side or the other
[56:28] but Paul was the one God was using
[56:31] to bring us across
[56:34] and the first CEO he says all right and
[56:36] a thunder went off John knew it was the
[56:38] voice of God
[56:39] and the Limelight creature said come see
[56:41] what it was and John went forth now with
[56:43] his pen to write what he was going to
[56:45] see now he never seen exactly what it
[56:47] was he never understood it but what he
[56:49] saw was what God was sending to the
[56:51] church for a time now he's talking about
[56:54] in Revelation chapter 6 amen when when
[56:57] John amen he he he he sees the white
[57:01] horse rider go out and he sees it he was
[57:03] given a crown he had a bow and all of
[57:05] these things that's what he's referring
[57:07] to now he says now uh John took his pen
[57:11] and he went forth to write
[57:13] and he says
[57:14] uh he never seen exactly what it was he
[57:18] means the interpretation that he saw a
[57:20] white horse
[57:21] but he didn't see exactly what the White
[57:22] Horse was
[57:24] he didn't know it was the Antichrist
[57:25] spirit
[57:27] he says you never seen exactly what it
[57:29] was he never understood but what he saw
[57:31] was what God was sending to the church
[57:33] for a Time
[57:35] what was it the symbol was what was sent
[57:38] to the church for a Time
[57:40] but after that time something else is
[57:44] going to be given to the church
[57:46] so the symbols the symbols of uh uh the
[57:51] symbol of a white horse the symbol of a
[57:52] red horse the symbol of a black horse it
[57:54] was given for a time but at the end of
[57:57] that time there's going to be something
[57:58] else given and what is going to be given
[58:00] we all know what that is he said this is
[58:03] what he says ascending to the church for
[58:05] a time he will he always does he makes
[58:07] it plain when it's time to make it plain
[58:10] but he didn't he didn't make it plain
[58:13] then why because he was going to keep it
[58:15] a secret until the last days and the
[58:17] sounding of the last Angel's message was
[58:19] to gather up these Mysteries he didn't
[58:21] make it clear but what John saw he just
[58:24] seen a white horse go out with a rider
[58:26] on it so that's what he wrote down
[58:28] that's what he said come see so John
[58:31] when he went to see what he could could
[58:33] see to write to the church and when he
[58:34] did he saw a white horse and him that
[58:36] sat on and had a bow and he went forth
[58:38] conquering and to conquer and there was
[58:40] given to him a crown and now that's all
[58:42] John Saul he wrote it all down now see
[58:45] that's in symbol that's the way the
[58:46] church has received it but the promise
[58:48] that at the last day he'd reveal it show
[58:51] what it is God help us to understand he
[58:55] says for that time which is the church
[58:57] ages they would have the symbol but in
[58:59] God's appointed time he would show what
[59:01] it is it's not a white horse it's an
[59:04] antichrist spirit amen the crown that
[59:06] was given to him was given to him Amen
[59:08] in the third age amen and and all of
[59:11] these things there's a time appointed
[59:13] when he's going to show the church what
[59:15] that is and this is that time
[59:18] it marks a change in time but the change
[59:21] in time means everything to us it's just
[59:24] as significant as the time that was
[59:26] marked in John the Forerunner coming and
[59:28] Jesus coming on the scene it's just
[59:30] significant today as it was back then
[59:35] let's read Colossians chapter one now
[59:40] in verse 25.
[59:50] in Colossians chapter 1 verse 25 Paul
[59:53] says something very similar to what he
[59:55] says in Ephesians
[59:57] says whereof I am made a minister
[59:58] according to the dispensation of God
[1:00:00] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:00:03] the word of God even the mystery which
[1:00:05] has been hid from ages and from
[1:00:07] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:00:10] his Saints to whom God would make known
[1:00:12] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:00:14] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:00:16] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:00:19] Paul once again is saying there's been a
[1:00:22] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[1:00:24] generations
[1:00:26] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:00:29] there's this mystery of the Seven Seals
[1:00:32] it was given a symbol form but it was
[1:00:34] hidden through the seven Church ages
[1:00:37] but it is going to be revealed and I
[1:00:39] will say it has been revealed
[1:00:42] when was it revealed when God turned the
[1:00:44] calendar
[1:00:45] when God changed the time I want to I
[1:00:48] want to move on and look at this brother
[1:00:50] bam says and the message I have heard
[1:00:52] but now I see he said now
[1:00:55] it's begin to pull away the Wheats begin
[1:00:57] to be seen this is not a Pentecostal age
[1:01:01] this is the latter day age this is the
[1:01:04] bride age this is the evening line this
[1:01:06] is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to
[1:01:09] follow God's pattern this is Luke 17 30
[1:01:11] to be fulfilled
[1:01:14] and modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:01:16] he says what time is it that we're
[1:01:17] living in something like a calendar you
[1:01:20] look at the calendar to find out what
[1:01:21] day of the year you're living in and you
[1:01:23] look at God's Bible to see what age
[1:01:25] we're living in we're not living in the
[1:01:27] Methodist days the Baptist age we're
[1:01:29] living in the bright Age The Calling
[1:01:31] bringing back to God through a channel
[1:01:33] that he promised to bring it back in he
[1:01:36] promised to do it
[1:01:38] amen we've heard these things so many
[1:01:40] times but we don't want them to become
[1:01:42] so common that it's no longer exciting
[1:01:44] that God has turned the page because
[1:01:45] we're not in church ages anymore this is
[1:01:48] the bride age amen he said this is the
[1:01:50] end I said the messenger must come at
[1:01:52] the end of the age he comes at the end
[1:01:54] of the Pentecostal age and brother
[1:01:56] Branham said the Pentecostal age is the
[1:01:58] old laodicean churches
[1:02:00] so at the end he doesn't come at the
[1:02:03] beginning he comes at the end what's he
[1:02:05] doing he's marking out a closing of
[1:02:07] something and Bridging the way through a
[1:02:09] gap into something else what's he
[1:02:11] bridging his way into to the bright age
[1:02:14] amen and the bride age is not another
[1:02:16] church age
[1:02:19] think about this it's not another church
[1:02:22] age amen sometimes people fight the
[1:02:24] terminology Brides They want to fight
[1:02:26] that because they say you're adding
[1:02:27] another church age it's not a church age
[1:02:30] it's a bride Age The Very term indicates
[1:02:33] it cannot be an additional Church age
[1:02:36] because it is a bride age not a church
[1:02:39] age
[1:02:40] not an eighth Church age called breath
[1:02:42] no it's a bride age it's something
[1:02:44] completely different than the church
[1:02:46] ages
[1:02:47] you had Church ages you had first church
[1:02:49] age second Church age you had uh
[1:02:52] laodicean Church we're not talking about
[1:02:55] church ages anymore there's been a
[1:02:57] breach Amen to get us from here to get
[1:02:59] to somewhere else and there's somebody
[1:03:01] standing in the gap of the breach
[1:03:02] indicating a change in time to take us
[1:03:05] out of church ages into bright age not
[1:03:09] an additional age
[1:03:12] thank you
[1:03:13] amen because there's there is no
[1:03:16] argument here there is no eighth
[1:03:18] messenger eighth there's no eighth
[1:03:21] Church age amen that brother man said
[1:03:23] there is no Eighth Day it goes back to
[1:03:25] the first day amen so what is this
[1:03:28] addition what what comes at the end of
[1:03:31] the seven Church ages there is an age
[1:03:33] opened amen it's not a new age it's
[1:03:36] actually an old age
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:40] it's not a new age amen it's an eternal
[1:03:44] age amen it's not marked by time it is a
[1:03:47] position it's what the church was
[1:03:49] intended to be when it was birthed at
[1:03:51] Pentecost but it fell into the church
[1:03:54] ages and now coming out of the church
[1:03:56] age there's got to be another indication
[1:03:58] of a change in time and in every Church
[1:04:01] age God indicated the change in time
[1:04:03] with a messenger to come move from one
[1:04:06] to the other but in this layer to cnh he
[1:04:08] was going to bring one at the end of the
[1:04:10] Pentecostal age
[1:04:13] to move us out of the church age into
[1:04:16] the bride age amen which is going right
[1:04:19] back to what the bride was intended to
[1:04:21] be at her very birth at Pentecost
[1:04:25] so there is there is no fear of an
[1:04:29] additional Church age
[1:04:31] there is no additional but everyone said
[1:04:34] there can be no more ages
[1:04:36] so we're at the end time the last days
[1:04:38] the latest interviews there can be no
[1:04:40] more amen and and believing that we're
[1:04:42] in a bright age is not denying the fact
[1:04:45] that the later to see an age is still
[1:04:46] continuing on
[1:04:48] because the laodicea and Edge will
[1:04:50] continue on until it enters into the
[1:04:52] tribulation period
[1:04:55] but the laodicean is a church age for
[1:04:58] the church
[1:05:00] but this message is a bride call to come
[1:05:03] out of the church it's a bright Age The
[1:05:06] Bride is not supposed to continue in the
[1:05:08] laodicean church age and go into
[1:05:10] tribulation she's been caught out of
[1:05:12] that
[1:05:14] amen so there's a dispensational change
[1:05:18] in our day there's been somebody to
[1:05:20] bridge the gap to move from church ages
[1:05:22] back into the bride age amen and react
[1:05:26] when did the bride age start oh my
[1:05:28] goodness it started before the
[1:05:29] foundation of the world when God's heart
[1:05:31] desire was to have a bride of his own
[1:05:33] choosing
[1:05:34] this opening of the word was opening of
[1:05:37] The Secret of God's mind his thought
[1:05:39] which is eternal
[1:05:41] we haven't moved into we haven't moved
[1:05:43] into a period of time where we count
[1:05:46] days and we count years we have moved
[1:05:48] back into the Eternal desire thought of
[1:05:50] God
[1:05:52] what he wanted from the beginning from
[1:05:54] before the foundation of the world is he
[1:05:56] wanted a bride of his own choosing amen
[1:05:59] this bright age is not something
[1:06:00] physical that's upon the Earth although
[1:06:02] it takes place in physical people every
[1:06:05] physical human beings amen are
[1:06:07] manifesting this it's the brother bam
[1:06:09] said that great Eternal Church age at
[1:06:11] the end of the seven Church ages
[1:06:15] amen it's eternal
[1:06:17] so there is no there is no basis for an
[1:06:22] argument
[1:06:24] that
[1:06:25] that we're adding an additional Church
[1:06:27] age
[1:06:29] there is no the seventh is completion
[1:06:32] that period of time is finished
[1:06:35] but God has sent a messenger in our day
[1:06:38] the same way he sent the Apostle Paul in
[1:06:40] his day
[1:06:42] the same way he sent John the Baptist in
[1:06:44] his day and he's here for a
[1:06:46] dispensational change for the changing
[1:06:49] of times
[1:06:51] and when the times changed
[1:06:54] it was always imperative to make the
[1:06:57] change
[1:06:59] think all the way down through history
[1:07:01] in any time that God sends a messenger
[1:07:04] to change his time we recognize that
[1:07:06] it's a super imperative that we make the
[1:07:08] change
[1:07:10] because if you didn't catch the change
[1:07:11] in Moses day and wanted to stay in Egypt
[1:07:13] you were lost
[1:07:15] if you didn't catch the change in Noah's
[1:07:18] day and wanted to refuse to go into the
[1:07:20] art you were lost you were doomed
[1:07:22] in John the Baptist day if you refuse to
[1:07:25] make the transition to Christ amen you
[1:07:27] were left behind you were blinded you
[1:07:29] were separated
[1:07:32] the same thing with the Apostle Paul if
[1:07:34] you if you didn't if you didn't receive
[1:07:36] the Gospel he was bringing which was the
[1:07:39] mystery for that day amen you were left
[1:07:41] out
[1:07:43] the same thing's true for today
[1:07:46] that's why I think it's
[1:07:49] I think it's so important for us to
[1:07:51] recognize this transition wasn't a minor
[1:07:55] transition
[1:07:57] and the prophet wasn't here just
[1:08:00] pointing to something that was going to
[1:08:02] happen way off decades and decades later
[1:08:04] but he was on Earth at the time the
[1:08:07] transition was being made
[1:08:10] just like with all the other
[1:08:12] transitional figures
[1:08:15] so it's important to make the change
[1:08:19] and it's also when when they moved when
[1:08:24] the Jews moved from law unto Grace under
[1:08:26] Christ
[1:08:27] amen they some of the Jews had a little
[1:08:29] bit of difficulty with that transition
[1:08:32] they didn't know exactly how to make it
[1:08:34] and it was a little bit of a difficult
[1:08:35] time but brother the Apostle Paul come
[1:08:37] down and he laid it down and he
[1:08:39] straightened it out and he said it in
[1:08:41] order so that they could take what he
[1:08:43] said and they can make the transition
[1:08:45] amen and some struggled some stayed
[1:08:47] behind and all these other things some
[1:08:50] straddled I seemed like two
[1:08:52] dispensations they still wanted to bring
[1:08:54] in circumcision to the Jews the Gentiles
[1:08:56] and all of these things and Paul was
[1:08:58] constantly against that he didn't want
[1:09:00] him straddling two ages he wanted them
[1:09:02] to move into the dispensation of Grace
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:08] so that's why for us to realize
[1:09:12] that I'm not a church-aged believer
[1:09:20] because I will I will identify myself
[1:09:24] with the church
[1:09:27] but this is a different time
[1:09:30] this is where he wants to you to be
[1:09:32] identified as the bride
[1:09:35] because in the church ages God was
[1:09:37] dealing with two Vines
[1:09:39] if you look at every message the message
[1:09:42] to the church ages he's he's he's
[1:09:44] addressing two Vines two groups of
[1:09:46] people with within the church and he's
[1:09:49] dealing brother remember said to the
[1:09:50] churches he's dealing with two groups of
[1:09:52] people at the same time and within that
[1:09:54] church is his seed within that church is
[1:09:57] mingled in two seedlines two Vines two
[1:10:01] groups of people and he's dealing with
[1:10:03] them all the way through and and until
[1:10:05] he gets to the seventh Church age and in
[1:10:07] the seventh Church age there's a cry
[1:10:09] that comes out that says come out from
[1:10:12] among her my people and be ye separate
[1:10:14] he's no longer dealing with the church
[1:10:16] and dealing with two groups of people
[1:10:18] and you can see this in the laodicean
[1:10:20] church age because when you go to the
[1:10:22] laodicean church age it reads different
[1:10:24] than all the previous Church ages if you
[1:10:27] go to Ephesus and Smyrna and pergamers
[1:10:29] and all those others you'll see that he
[1:10:31] has an accommodation something he he he
[1:10:34] he he he he blesses them for or
[1:10:36] something he tells them and blesses them
[1:10:38] for doing something positive and then he
[1:10:40] has a correction something negative
[1:10:42] next Church Apes positive negative
[1:10:44] positive negative positive negative
[1:10:46] until he comes to the laodicean church
[1:10:48] and in the laodicean church he has not
[1:10:50] one positive thing to say about the
[1:10:52] laodicean church
[1:10:54] he doesn't have any he doesn't have any
[1:10:56] accommodation he doesn't have anything
[1:10:58] to bless them for or anything to commend
[1:11:00] them for he has nothing good to say
[1:11:03] about the laodicean church age because
[1:11:05] in that church age you find Christ on
[1:11:07] the outside knocking trying to get back
[1:11:09] in he's not even there amen so so that
[1:11:12] that tells me that he's changed the
[1:11:15] order of dealing with two Vines now he
[1:11:17] addresses the wrong Vine and he preaches
[1:11:19] the message through the prophet saying
[1:11:21] come out from among her now you've got
[1:11:23] to go beyond the camp to be United with
[1:11:25] the one who is persecuted outside the
[1:11:28] camp
[1:11:29] now to see if Jesus was put outside and
[1:11:32] now to be United with Christ you have to
[1:11:34] go out of the camp
[1:11:38] tonight Unite with him
[1:11:41] to me this is so
[1:11:44] I don't know it's so vitally important
[1:11:48] because it'll change the way we think
[1:11:50] it'll change the way we worship it
[1:11:54] changes our approach to God
[1:11:56] because under the church ages God's
[1:12:00] working with the church
[1:12:03] right it's individuals in the church but
[1:12:05] he's working with the ages
[1:12:07] but when he gets to the bride age he's
[1:12:09] only after one individual
[1:12:12] and that's you
[1:12:15] and he's not he's not
[1:12:18] um
[1:12:19] he's not in the face of building his
[1:12:21] body he's in the face of completing his
[1:12:24] body
[1:12:25] like everything's different in this
[1:12:28] change of time
[1:12:29] so we don't worship like we did in the
[1:12:32] church ages we don't think like we did
[1:12:34] in the church age we don't read the
[1:12:36] Bible like we did in the church ages
[1:12:39] for us amen making the change when the
[1:12:43] Apostle Paul amen got the message from
[1:12:45] Christ in Arabia for three and a half
[1:12:47] years his Bible became a new book
[1:12:51] because now the Apostle Paul comes out
[1:12:53] and he starts preaching Christ through
[1:12:56] all the old prophecies and go read the
[1:12:58] book of Hebrews and he's pulling out the
[1:13:00] shadows and types of the Tabernacle on
[1:13:02] the high priest and he's pulling out
[1:13:04] prophecies and he's connecting all of
[1:13:05] these prophecies why because Paul was
[1:13:08] reading the Bible and reading the Bible
[1:13:10] and reading the Bible but he was doing
[1:13:12] it under a previous dispensation
[1:13:15] is that right
[1:13:17] he was a Jew he was a Pharisee among
[1:13:19] Pharisees he was zealous he was schooled
[1:13:22] under the school of Gamaliel he he had
[1:13:24] all of this in this previous
[1:13:25] dispensation but he had to count it as
[1:13:28] if it was done that he might win Christ
[1:13:30] and he had to re-learn amen everything
[1:13:34] that he thought he knew he knew it
[1:13:36] through the wrong set of glasses
[1:13:39] he was viewing it through the wrong
[1:13:41] perspective amen but when the change of
[1:13:43] time comes
[1:13:45] then the change of perspective comes
[1:13:48] and under this change of perspective
[1:13:51] then all of a sudden you can see
[1:13:53] and you can see what that prophecy means
[1:13:55] and he can see this is for this day and
[1:13:57] this is for this day and then Paul could
[1:13:59] say it's all for this day
[1:14:01] the Tabernacle the high priest the
[1:14:03] sacrifices he could see it over
[1:14:07] and so in the day that we live in we
[1:14:10] must make the transition from church
[1:14:12] ages and to Bright age to understand
[1:14:14] what the prophet came to do he came to
[1:14:17] bridge he came to indicate a changing of
[1:14:20] the calendar
[1:14:22] and it will actually change
[1:14:24] the way
[1:14:26] we think
[1:14:27] it'll change the way we read the Bible
[1:14:30] so many things in the Book of Revelation
[1:14:32] if we haven't made the change in the
[1:14:34] Book of Revelation we keep we keep
[1:14:37] looking at future
[1:14:39] future
[1:14:40] you read this prophecy future this
[1:14:43] prophecy future this prophecy future
[1:14:45] but when you've made the transition all
[1:14:47] of a sudden you say that's past that's
[1:14:50] past that's past that's right now that's
[1:14:53] happening right that's happening in me
[1:14:57] amen when you've made the transition you
[1:14:59] go to Revelation chapter 10 you read 8
[1:15:01] to 11 verses 8 to 11 and you say that's
[1:15:04] going on right now
[1:15:06] these are future events amen these are
[1:15:09] things that have happened amen you go
[1:15:11] and you read through the first three
[1:15:13] chapters and you're all sudden you're
[1:15:14] like that's history this is not future
[1:15:16] this is history amen then you start
[1:15:18] reading the rest and say that's happened
[1:15:20] that's happened that's happened that's
[1:15:22] happened it's all happened or happening
[1:15:25] and you say it changes everything about
[1:15:28] Who We Are
[1:15:31] brother ma'am is is preaching and what
[1:15:34] is the attraction on the mountain he
[1:15:35] says and about that time the prophet
[1:15:37] turned and said behold here comes the
[1:15:39] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:15:41] the world now watch the attraction it
[1:15:44] changed from the prophet to his prophecy
[1:15:48] he's talking about John the Baptist
[1:15:51] and John the Baptist made the statement
[1:15:53] he he he was preaching he says there's
[1:15:56] one standing among you and he's saying
[1:15:58] I'm Forerunner I'm I'm not him but I'm
[1:16:00] preparing the way making the past great
[1:16:03] so he indicates all of this but when
[1:16:04] Jesus comes he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:16:06] God who takes away the sin of the world
[1:16:09] and brother bear speaking what is the
[1:16:10] attraction on the mountain he says what
[1:16:12] what is that attraction what was the
[1:16:14] attraction it changed from the prophet
[1:16:17] to his prophecy
[1:16:19] there was a dispensational change no
[1:16:22] longer was he just for running now the
[1:16:25] thing that he forerun was there
[1:16:28] it was it wasn't just for running
[1:16:30] anymore now he had four run
[1:16:33] is coming
[1:16:35] and now he was present
[1:16:37] that was the attraction and listen what
[1:16:40] brother Baron's preaching he's preaching
[1:16:42] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:16:44] and he's going to Zachariah Amen in the
[1:16:47] and he's talking about the scripture
[1:16:48] Zechariah where Jesus comes riding down
[1:16:51] on a donkey and he's fulfilling the
[1:16:54] scriptures and the people are shouting
[1:16:56] and then the Pharisees are wondering
[1:16:57] what is all the shouting about why are
[1:16:59] the people so excited and they had no
[1:17:01] idea that the very prophecy that they
[1:17:03] had quoted over and over was alive right
[1:17:06] in front of them and that was the
[1:17:08] attraction on the mountain that day
[1:17:11] the the what was the attraction prophecy
[1:17:14] brother when I said prophecy being
[1:17:16] fulfilled what was the attraction in
[1:17:18] John the Baptist day oh in his day he
[1:17:20] was a forerunner he was a prophet he was
[1:17:22] preparing the way but when Christ came
[1:17:24] to him Amen to be baptized and he
[1:17:26] declared him the Lamb of God and then
[1:17:28] all of a sudden it changed from his
[1:17:30] Prophet Prophecy from the prophet to the
[1:17:33] prophecy now what day the transition had
[1:17:37] been made now what he prophesied the
[1:17:40] prophecy of all the prophets was there
[1:17:43] he was present
[1:17:46] and those who recognize that their lives
[1:17:49] were forever changed
[1:17:51] the ones who John and Andrew and Peter
[1:17:54] and those who saw it who who made the
[1:17:58] transition their lives were never the
[1:18:00] same
[1:18:01] they may not have understood it all as
[1:18:03] it was happening they may have still had
[1:18:05] some wrong understanding about times and
[1:18:07] Seasons but they caught that this was
[1:18:10] the fulfilling of the prophecy they
[1:18:11] caught who this was amen and and what
[1:18:14] did it do it changed their entire life
[1:18:17] the same thing's true for you and I
[1:18:20] listen to what brother bam says in
[1:18:22] spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:18:25] he says
[1:18:29] actually before we do that let's all
[1:18:31] stand up
[1:18:34] some of you rung in the new year
[1:18:36] and I can tell
[1:18:40] Happy New Year
[1:18:43] we're doing the rest of this Thursday no
[1:18:45] I'm just kidding
[1:18:48] I'm just helping you just a little bit
[1:18:52] spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:18:56] people as Elijah was the first uh
[1:18:59] was first time to ahab's time it will
[1:19:03] happen here in this country
[1:19:05] he's talking about Elijah and Ahab
[1:19:08] he's going all the way back to the Old
[1:19:10] Testament showing Elijah was there at
[1:19:11] the time of Ahab he said so will it
[1:19:14] happen in this country
[1:19:15] I want you to stand to hear this because
[1:19:17] you need to hear this these things are
[1:19:19] familiar this is not new but it's so
[1:19:21] rich amen
[1:19:23] is it
[1:19:25] as this country is a type of Israel
[1:19:29] and then he says read or hear Jezebel
[1:19:31] religion he wants them to go listen to
[1:19:32] the message he preached as this country
[1:19:35] our forefathers for worship the way they
[1:19:37] want to come to this country and pushed
[1:19:39] out the natives and took over so did
[1:19:41] Israel take over when they come out of
[1:19:43] Egypt we had Godly men like Washington
[1:19:46] Lincoln they had great godly men as
[1:19:48] David and so forth then they got an Ahab
[1:19:51] on the throne with a jezebel behind him
[1:19:54] to direct him so have we
[1:19:57] he's going right to the right to the
[1:19:59] presidency of John F Kennedy amen and he
[1:20:02] and he shows that he's Catholic that's
[1:20:04] the woman that's behind him but also
[1:20:06] shows his wife as a type of that he says
[1:20:08] she's the one that turns the head
[1:20:12] so he says they got an Ahab on the
[1:20:14] throne with a jezebel behind him to
[1:20:16] direct him so have we
[1:20:20] now listen to the next statement
[1:20:23] so it's at this time in this country
[1:20:27] that that person will appear
[1:20:31] thank you
[1:20:32] yes he made it so obvious
[1:20:37] he says what they had there when Elijah
[1:20:40] was on the scene is what they have here
[1:20:42] now it's at this time and in this
[1:20:45] country this person will appear
[1:20:48] no future time it's right now amen and
[1:20:52] and that's fine but what does it mean
[1:20:54] that this person's on the scene what is
[1:20:56] the consequences of having that person
[1:20:58] on the scene it's not just neat saying
[1:21:00] Oh Brother Branham he was the
[1:21:01] Fulfillment of Malachi 4. amen we saw
[1:21:03] Luke 17 30 in his ministry we know it
[1:21:06] was the forerunning and all of these
[1:21:07] things but what is the significance of
[1:21:09] having him here it shows a changing of
[1:21:12] time
[1:21:13] a changing of dispensation amen and it's
[1:21:16] happening right in the time of that
[1:21:18] man's Ministry and it's not saying oh we
[1:21:20] saw what he did oh praise God someday
[1:21:23] will happen no you missed it it happened
[1:21:25] while he was here
[1:21:27] because that's what he was here for
[1:21:32] so it's at this time in this country
[1:21:35] that this person will appear
[1:21:38] first in the scripture and it's thus
[1:21:40] saith the Lord then in the latter rain
[1:21:42] there will come forth a Mount Carmel a
[1:21:43] showdown Bible fulfilled to the letter
[1:21:46] John the Baptist his messenger before
[1:21:48] his face in Malachi 3 planted a form of
[1:21:50] rain and was rejected by the churches
[1:21:52] the denominations the Pharisees and the
[1:21:54] Sadducees in his day Jesus came and had
[1:21:57] the mount Transfiguration Showdown this
[1:21:59] Forerunner of the last days will sow for
[1:22:01] the former Reign Jesus will be the
[1:22:03] showdown between denominations and
[1:22:05] creeds what's The Showdown Jesus will be
[1:22:09] who's Jesus the word
[1:22:12] will be the showdown between the
[1:22:14] nominations and Creeds so what's The
[1:22:16] Showdown it's the word and it's the
[1:22:19] denomination in Creed
[1:22:21] I wonder who's going to win that
[1:22:23] Showdown
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:25] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:22:27] nominations and Creeds which is the word
[1:22:28] then when he comes a showdown the
[1:22:32] Rapture of his bride the first was Mount
[1:22:35] Carmel the second was Mount
[1:22:36] Transfiguration the third will be Mount
[1:22:38] Zion Glory
[1:22:40] all right you can have your seats
[1:22:43] if you need more help I'll help you
[1:22:45] again we're going to work together
[1:22:48] we're laboring together for the word
[1:22:50] amen
[1:22:51] amen don't forget that brother Venom
[1:22:53] said it's to pull on the gift he said
[1:22:55] the congregation is 50 percent
[1:22:57] so when I start feeling like I'm running
[1:22:59] through knee-deep water I'm saying God
[1:23:00] what's going on
[1:23:02] we had too much party last night
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:08] so so now there's a Mount Zion Showdown
[1:23:11] which is the rapture of his bride
[1:23:14] amen we know that the Rapture is going
[1:23:17] on now
[1:23:18] he's he's calling us he's resurrecting
[1:23:21] us out of dead denominationalism he's
[1:23:23] bringing us to life brother Branham said
[1:23:25] that your soul raptured amen it was a
[1:23:27] quickening it was an Awakening it was a
[1:23:29] drawing us up out of laodicea and
[1:23:31] quickening us into the to the union with
[1:23:34] Christ
[1:23:35] and we know that it'll culminate with
[1:23:37] the change in our atoms
[1:23:39] with the change of our bodies will be
[1:23:41] the completion of the finishing of the
[1:23:43] Rapture but don't wait for the Rapture
[1:23:45] get in the rapture
[1:23:47] because the Lord himself will descend
[1:23:50] with a shout where the voice of the
[1:23:52] Archangel and the Trump of God what is
[1:23:54] that it's the coming of the Lord and
[1:23:57] what is the shout it's the message to
[1:23:58] gather the bride together so so don't
[1:24:01] keep putting things off in the future
[1:24:02] saying someday there'll be a Rapture
[1:24:04] someday there'll be a Rapture no there's
[1:24:06] a Rapture going on right now when you
[1:24:08] heard the eagle scream when you heard
[1:24:09] the word you raptured up quickly to meet
[1:24:11] it amen
[1:24:13] amen so the Rapture is going on and will
[1:24:17] culminate in a body change amen but we
[1:24:20] must be in the cycle we must make the
[1:24:23] transition amen or else we're going to
[1:24:25] be sitting stuck in a laodicean age with
[1:24:29] laodicean thinking with church age
[1:24:31] mentality hoping that someday someday
[1:24:34] something's going to happen and someday
[1:24:37] I'll be changed when brother Branham
[1:24:39] said the quickening power has come amen
[1:24:41] at the rising of the Sun the quickening
[1:24:43] power came what was the rising of the
[1:24:45] sun it's when Christ Jesus the full word
[1:24:48] the headship returned back to the church
[1:24:50] it was the evening lights come at the at
[1:24:52] the sounding of the seven Thunders the
[1:24:54] evening light returned
[1:24:56] it was the rising of the sun it's the
[1:24:59] setting of the Sun for the world they
[1:25:01] grow in Gross Darkness but arise and
[1:25:02] shine for thy light has come the world's
[1:25:05] in darkness you're in light amen it's
[1:25:07] the setting of the Sun for them it's the
[1:25:09] rising of the Sun for you and the rising
[1:25:11] of the sun brought the quickening power
[1:25:13] and what was the quickening power it
[1:25:16] came to Quicken the word to life
[1:25:20] what word the word that's laying in your
[1:25:23] soul the portion of God that he wants to
[1:25:26] be expressed in this day that thought he
[1:25:28] had of you before the foundation of the
[1:25:30] world the seed of himself that he
[1:25:32] planted in you to be expressed in this
[1:25:34] day the quickening power is here to
[1:25:36] Quicken that seed to life
[1:25:39] to do what to live the life of Jesus
[1:25:42] Christ
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] in what form in Bride form
[1:25:49] so the quickening power is here what
[1:25:51] quickening power the same quickening
[1:25:54] power that'll change your atom is the
[1:25:56] quickening power that's already changing
[1:25:58] you from a church member to a bride
[1:26:03] the same exact quickening power that
[1:26:06] changed you from church and listen uh
[1:26:08] the young people that are here I'm not
[1:26:11] talking about you have to leave a
[1:26:13] certain Church you have to leave a
[1:26:14] denomination no I'm telling you you're
[1:26:16] raised up with a natural sort of
[1:26:18] thinking a carnality that you have to be
[1:26:20] quickened out of Amen in this this
[1:26:23] Revelation has to be made alive inside
[1:26:25] of you amen it has to become yours you
[1:26:28] have to go you need the quickening power
[1:26:31] too
[1:26:33] to Quicken that seed to life amen the
[1:26:35] quickening power is here so that we're
[1:26:38] no longer amen trying to do things in an
[1:26:40] order in a form or in a group but now
[1:26:43] all of a sudden the quickening power has
[1:26:45] come to make the word live in me
[1:26:49] make it what alive where it is alive and
[1:26:53] the church know it's alive in me
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:57] where is the message
[1:26:59] is it in a building
[1:27:01] is it on the thumb drive
[1:27:03] and your computer
[1:27:05] know the message is in me
[1:27:08] it's living it's breathing it's
[1:27:11] manifesting by what the quickening power
[1:27:15] but events that it quickened you it
[1:27:16] quickened you from a church member it
[1:27:18] quickened you amen and he starts to talk
[1:27:21] about that he said how do I know brother
[1:27:23] Branham he says you used to smoke you
[1:27:25] used to drink and you changed what did
[1:27:27] that he said quickening power did that
[1:27:32] so praise be to God we're not in the age
[1:27:35] where we're saying oh something's coming
[1:27:36] something's coming something's coming no
[1:27:39] we're in the age we say something has
[1:27:41] come
[1:27:43] and that's something that has come is
[1:27:45] the very thing that is transitioning me
[1:27:48] amen into the next phase
[1:27:52] so if we're constantly looking for
[1:27:53] something to come if we constantly need
[1:27:56] something to come then then we set
[1:27:58] ourselves up in danger for needing more
[1:28:01] than what we have
[1:28:03] now I'm not saying that what we have
[1:28:06] won't become more clear
[1:28:07] I'm not saying that the Revelation
[1:28:09] that's in the Revelation then the
[1:28:11] message is still opening to me
[1:28:13] it may be done opening to you but it's
[1:28:15] still opening to me
[1:28:17] I'm still seeing it in ways I've never
[1:28:19] seen it before things are still opening
[1:28:21] up on a on a daily basis and and it's
[1:28:24] becoming fresh and Alive over and over
[1:28:27] again so I'm not talking about that when
[1:28:28] I mean new things are becoming new to me
[1:28:31] but they were already in the message
[1:28:33] they were already I didn't have to get
[1:28:35] new books
[1:28:37] they were already in my Bible they were
[1:28:39] already on those tapes I didn't have to
[1:28:40] change them out and exchange them for
[1:28:42] different ones amen but the problem is
[1:28:44] if we if we constantly need something
[1:28:46] well something will happen and then
[1:28:48] something will happen and then I mean
[1:28:50] we're we're actually delaying our own
[1:28:53] growth and refusing the very thing
[1:28:54] that's taking us to where we're going
[1:28:56] amen the very power amen that's carrying
[1:28:59] us is this word
[1:29:02] quickening power is here
[1:29:04] the headship is here the Life of Christ
[1:29:07] is here not in measure like to the
[1:29:09] churches but in fullness
[1:29:11] no longer is it time for a dip in the
[1:29:13] spirit but now it's to be completely uh
[1:29:16] submerged completely filled completely
[1:29:19] whatever with the spirit of God
[1:29:22] so brother van was telling us
[1:29:26] that he's giving a marker indicator that
[1:29:30] now the United States is sitting in the
[1:29:32] same place Israel was when Elijah came
[1:29:36] and now with an Ahab on the throne and a
[1:29:39] jezebel system to back him up and direct
[1:29:41] him he said at this time and in this guy
[1:29:44] boy I love that
[1:29:48] at this time and in this country that
[1:29:50] person will appear I remember years ago
[1:29:53] when I first first heard the message and
[1:29:54] was listening to it somebody would say
[1:29:56] you know brother Branham never he never
[1:29:58] said he was the Fulfillment of an
[1:30:00] archive four he never said he was Elijah
[1:30:02] and I said oh really he didn't and I go
[1:30:05] looking through and sure enough you
[1:30:06] can't see quotes where he says I am
[1:30:08] Elijah I am Malachi 4. but then I just
[1:30:11] kept reading the message and I said he
[1:30:13] most certainly did he said it every
[1:30:14] which way you can say it
[1:30:19] but for those with eyes to see and ears
[1:30:21] to hear it's as plain as the nose on her
[1:30:23] own faces it's right here
[1:30:26] it's at this time and in this country
[1:30:27] that this person will appear so if if it
[1:30:31] wasn't him who wasn't because it had to
[1:30:33] do it in the days of of the Ahab that
[1:30:35] was on the throne in the days of of the
[1:30:37] presidency of John F Kennedy so who was
[1:30:40] it
[1:30:42] praise God
[1:30:44] again in spoken words the original City
[1:30:46] says as the end time prophecies will
[1:30:48] repeat
[1:30:49] as the end time prophecies will repeat I
[1:30:52] believe as the first Forerunner came
[1:30:54] from the Wilderness and cried Behold the
[1:30:56] Lamb of God
[1:30:57] the second Forerunner will probably do
[1:30:59] the same by pointing the people to a
[1:31:03] word-born bride
[1:31:08] I love this quote
[1:31:12] if we just read it and take it the way
[1:31:14] he says it it opens so much
[1:31:16] understanding
[1:31:18] John the Baptist was there to indicate
[1:31:20] the arrival of the Lamb of God he was
[1:31:23] the Forerunner making the way straight
[1:31:25] and then when he forerun appeared on the
[1:31:28] scene he declared what it was Behold the
[1:31:30] Lamb of God that take away the sin of
[1:31:31] the world and he says that will repeat
[1:31:34] he said that will probably repeat
[1:31:37] I said the second form will probably do
[1:31:39] the same
[1:31:40] by pointing the people to a word-born
[1:31:42] bride
[1:31:44] so how is he going to declare the coming
[1:31:47] of the Lord
[1:31:48] how will he declare the Fulfillment
[1:31:52] of his prophecy
[1:31:54] he come to forerun something how will he
[1:31:57] declare what he forerun by first
[1:31:59] pointing to a word-born bride because if
[1:32:01] you can see the word born bride you can
[1:32:04] see where Christ is
[1:32:06] because he came to unite with his bride
[1:32:09] the headship came to connect with the
[1:32:11] body
[1:32:12] so if what so why does he point to a
[1:32:15] word born bride because that's where the
[1:32:17] headship came to that's where Christ
[1:32:19] came in this day now he's to be made
[1:32:21] manifest in the form of the Bride
[1:32:26] that's why that's why it's so it's so
[1:32:30] um difficult for people to receive that
[1:32:32] so difficult to believe it because it's
[1:32:34] just like it always was it's just like
[1:32:36] the baby in the manger it's like the
[1:32:39] Shepherds with the message who would
[1:32:40] believe a shepherd
[1:32:43] who would believe in illiterate young
[1:32:45] Shepherd amen who's who spends his time
[1:32:48] in the field with the Sheep No Education
[1:32:49] no schooling no theological background I
[1:32:52] mean I don't even know what his church
[1:32:54] attendance was like
[1:32:56] probably couldn't quote the scriptures
[1:32:58] verbatim
[1:33:00] probably couldn't read the scriptures
[1:33:02] for himself
[1:33:04] but they had the message and they said
[1:33:07] Hey listen he said the king is born amen
[1:33:11] the king of the Jews is here Christ
[1:33:13] Jesus amen the Messiah is on Earth and
[1:33:16] if he were like boy what are you talking
[1:33:18] about Jesus is here Christ we saw him
[1:33:21] the Messiah is here whoa yeah
[1:33:24] yeah hey say where is he
[1:33:26] he's over in that Barn over there
[1:33:29] look at a manger and he's wrapped up in
[1:33:32] some cloth off a yoke of an oxen and
[1:33:34] it's that little baby laying there
[1:33:37] and the people will say that that can't
[1:33:39] be it
[1:33:43] you see Jesus you know on the street
[1:33:46] walking playing I don't know what he did
[1:33:49] whatever he did as a boy as a 10 year
[1:33:51] old boy
[1:33:52] you say messiah's here the king of the
[1:33:54] Jews is here
[1:33:56] where is he is that boy over there
[1:33:59] that one you know the one that's walking
[1:34:02] looking down dragging his feet
[1:34:06] that can't be him
[1:34:09] but it was
[1:34:12] he was the one who was rejected he was
[1:34:15] the one who was mocked he was the one
[1:34:19] that was him
[1:34:21] they couldn't believe it because it was
[1:34:23] just in human form
[1:34:26] they couldn't believe because it was
[1:34:28] it's appeared so common and it was in
[1:34:31] human form and it was so beyond reason
[1:34:33] that they just couldn't accept it
[1:34:37] but the question is could it be the same
[1:34:40] way today
[1:34:41] could it be just difficult for the human
[1:34:43] mind to perceive that Christ would
[1:34:46] actually come he would return to the
[1:34:48] Earth that he would be present now Among
[1:34:51] Us and you say where would he be well
[1:34:53] that Prophet would point to a word born
[1:34:55] bride
[1:35:00] listen
[1:35:01] yeah they're nice people and all
[1:35:03] but that can't be it
[1:35:06] that can't be it so I will look for
[1:35:09] something else
[1:35:11] because that can't be it
[1:35:13] I will wait and watch for something else
[1:35:17] because when it happens it'll be obvious
[1:35:26] it can't be that humble it can't be that
[1:35:28] simple it can't it can't be those people
[1:35:33] maybe it can't
[1:35:36] but maybe it can
[1:35:40] the second Forerunner will probably do
[1:35:42] the same by pointing the people to a
[1:35:44] word-born bride
[1:35:46] the bride of Christ will be pointed to
[1:35:49] the skies at the peering of Jesus
[1:35:53] so the it didn't say the bride will be
[1:35:56] pointing to the skies she will be
[1:35:58] pointed to the skies
[1:36:00] that means somebody else is directing
[1:36:02] her attention
[1:36:05] the bride of Christ will be pointed to
[1:36:07] the skies at the appearing of Jesus
[1:36:10] screaming Behold the Lamb of God will
[1:36:13] come forth from his lips
[1:36:17] God help us to be ready for this near
[1:36:20] event
[1:36:22] he preached this in in March of 1962 one
[1:36:26] year before he preached the seals
[1:36:28] God help us for this near event amen I
[1:36:31] want to ask you did this Forerunner
[1:36:33] point to a word born bride
[1:36:36] and did he direct her attention to the
[1:36:38] skies
[1:36:39] and tell us who that cloud was who that
[1:36:42] was up there that's our Lord up there
[1:36:46] God help us for this near event
[1:36:50] near event it's a past event now it's
[1:36:53] come it's happened he's here the
[1:36:55] headship is here United to the body if
[1:36:58] you want to find him find where he is he
[1:37:01] is what he is the word may manifest for
[1:37:04] this day what is the word for this day
[1:37:06] the word is Jesus Christ in Bride form
[1:37:12] brother ma'am he relates the same thing
[1:37:15] he's he's speaking here in spoken word
[1:37:18] is the original seat about a part where
[1:37:19] he was told to pick up his pen and write
[1:37:20] and the angel directed him to write what
[1:37:22] he writes and when he was done writing
[1:37:24] he had to go back and read it he didn't
[1:37:25] even know what he was writing and he and
[1:37:27] he mentions it again or he records it
[1:37:29] again in the church age book and this is
[1:37:32] that same section he says the last day
[1:37:34] Messenger will appear in God's appointed
[1:37:36] time
[1:37:37] praise God
[1:37:40] how many are you of you are so thankful
[1:37:43] that it's been God's appointed time
[1:37:46] I'm so thankful that I can say that that
[1:37:49] messenger came at God's appointed time
[1:37:51] he appeared at God's appointed time
[1:37:56] it is the end time now as all know for
[1:37:58] Israel is in the Homeland
[1:38:00] anytime now he will come according to
[1:38:02] Malachi when we see him he will be
[1:38:04] dedicated to the word he will be
[1:38:06] indicated pointed out in the word
[1:38:08] revelation 10 7.
[1:38:10] and God will vindicate his ministry he
[1:38:13] will preach the truth as did Elijah and
[1:38:15] be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown
[1:38:18] many will misunderstand him because they
[1:38:20] have been taught scripture in a certain
[1:38:22] way which they consider truth
[1:38:25] that's the denominational understanding
[1:38:27] of the Bible
[1:38:31] so that's why they misunderstood him
[1:38:33] that's why we've misunderstood him
[1:38:37] listen if you believe this message for
[1:38:39] any period of time there's been a time
[1:38:41] you misunderstood him
[1:38:43] is that right I hope I'm not the only
[1:38:46] one but there's been times where I've
[1:38:48] been misunderstanding what the prophet's
[1:38:49] saying but all of a sudden God will
[1:38:51] bring a revelation he say oh that's what
[1:38:53] he means that's what that scripture is
[1:38:55] he's preaching exactly this scripture
[1:38:58] but my understanding of that scripture
[1:39:00] was putting it somewhere else I wouldn't
[1:39:02] allow that scripture to be applied to
[1:39:04] this prophet in this time
[1:39:07] and I hope we can all be honest enough
[1:39:09] to say we all did that we all had a
[1:39:12] certain understanding and we would not
[1:39:14] allow that scripture to mean what the
[1:39:17] prophet was using it to mean but all of
[1:39:19] a sudden when the Revelation clicks you
[1:39:21] say it he means exactly what he's saying
[1:39:23] he knows exactly the scripture he's
[1:39:25] using
[1:39:27] and it's the truth
[1:39:31] so he says so many will misunderstand
[1:39:34] him because they've been taught
[1:39:35] scripture in a certain way which they
[1:39:36] consider truth
[1:39:38] when he comes against that they will not
[1:39:40] believe
[1:39:41] even some true ministers
[1:39:44] will misunderstand the messenger because
[1:39:46] so much has been called God's truth by
[1:39:49] deceivers
[1:39:51] what causes even true ministers to
[1:39:53] misunderstand
[1:39:55] denominational teaching of the
[1:39:57] scriptures
[1:39:58] amen
[1:40:00] that's why I've said for years I wish I
[1:40:03] had a delete button
[1:40:05] in my mind where I could delete
[1:40:07] everything I ever understood I could
[1:40:09] download a fresh copy of the Bible and
[1:40:12] download the message to shine the light
[1:40:13] and illuminate the Bible so that I would
[1:40:15] get the correct interpretation of the
[1:40:16] word
[1:40:18] because so much of the problems that
[1:40:20] I've had have been problems between my
[1:40:22] ears
[1:40:26] says now
[1:40:28] but this Prophet will come and is the
[1:40:31] Forerunner to the first came cried
[1:40:32] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[1:40:34] the sin of the world even so will he no
[1:40:36] doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God
[1:40:38] coming in glory he will do this for even
[1:40:41] as John was the messenger of Truth to
[1:40:43] the elect so is this one the messenger
[1:40:45] to the elect and word-born Prime
[1:40:48] let's go to Revelation chapter 10.
[1:40:56] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:41:03] and verse 1 Revelation 10 and 1.
[1:41:07] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:41:09] from heaven
[1:41:10] clothed with a cloud on a rainbow was
[1:41:12] upon his head and his face was as it
[1:41:14] were the Sun and his feet is pillars of
[1:41:16] Fire
[1:41:18] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:41:19] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:41:21] sea in his left foot upon the Earth
[1:41:23] now let's go down to verse 7. but in the
[1:41:26] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:41:28] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:41:30] of God should be finished as he hath
[1:41:32] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:41:34] now we know these scriptures and but
[1:41:36] brother Branham in the message he gives
[1:41:38] us the translation interpretation of
[1:41:39] these scriptures Revelation 10 7 is the
[1:41:43] Angel to the seventh seventh Church age
[1:41:46] he's a seventh Church age Angel which he
[1:41:48] says is a man
[1:41:49] so Revelation 10 7 is an angel an
[1:41:52] angel's a messenger it's the seventh
[1:41:54] Messenger to the seventh Church age amen
[1:41:56] the seven Church age messenger which is
[1:41:58] William Branham
[1:42:01] he's been clearly identified that's who
[1:42:03] he is
[1:42:04] Revelations 10 1 is a mighty Angel and
[1:42:07] brother Branham says only Christ it
[1:42:10] could be
[1:42:12] he said it's the angel of the Covenant
[1:42:13] it's Christ so he says this Angel is
[1:42:16] Christ
[1:42:17] this angel in seven is the seventh
[1:42:20] Church age Messenger right and then he
[1:42:23] says this Angel the seventh Church
[1:42:26] eighth Messenger will be on Earth at the
[1:42:29] time of this coming
[1:42:34] who's coming the mighty angel
[1:42:37] the word the word who did he say it was
[1:42:40] he said only Christ it could be
[1:42:44] what was it it was the coming of Christ
[1:42:46] it was the coming of the Lord when when
[1:42:49] that angel amen that Malachi 4 Elijah
[1:42:52] that that fulfillment of Luke 17 30.
[1:42:55] that all those scriptures combined had
[1:42:58] to come when there was an Ahab on the
[1:43:00] throne with a jezebel system behind it
[1:43:02] yeah
[1:43:02] and John F Kennedy's Administration
[1:43:04] that's when Elijah had to be on the
[1:43:07] scene at that time
[1:43:09] and at that time Revelation 10 is
[1:43:13] fulfilled he is on Earth at the time of
[1:43:17] this coming he doesn't say at the time
[1:43:19] of this Revelation at the time of this
[1:43:22] knowing he says at the time of this
[1:43:24] coming
[1:43:29] praise God
[1:43:33] I don't know about you but I want to get
[1:43:35] all the way over the bridge
[1:43:37] into this new dispensation
[1:43:40] I don't want to stay in the church ages
[1:43:42] I don't want to stay on the bridge say
[1:43:44] someday we'll get over there someday
[1:43:46] we'll get over there God's already
[1:43:47] changed the times
[1:43:49] God has already flipped the calendar now
[1:43:52] it's up to us whether we have faith
[1:43:54] enough to move with the calendar
[1:43:58] because there's appointments in this new
[1:44:00] calendar
[1:44:02] but you're not going to make those
[1:44:03] appointments if you're still in the old
[1:44:05] calendar
[1:44:07] another man in the visible Union of the
[1:44:09] Bride he says the word that fell on the
[1:44:12] day of Pentecost will not work this day
[1:44:14] no sir that was for Pentecostals this is
[1:44:17] for the bride going home of the Bride
[1:44:22] what is the word that we received come
[1:44:23] to do it's come to take us home this is
[1:44:26] for the going home of the Bride
[1:44:28] that's why we can't wait we must receive
[1:44:33] amen
[1:44:34] we got something different the Pentecost
[1:44:37] represented that again we're in the
[1:44:39] bright age no more than the word of no
[1:44:41] it will work in the days of Moses no
[1:44:43] more Moses law would have worked in the
[1:44:45] time of Paul he tried to tell them you
[1:44:47] are dead to that and you cannot have
[1:44:49] that
[1:44:50] amen what was Paul saying you're dead to
[1:44:52] that you can't go back to that and now
[1:44:55] we cannot go back to the Pentecostal age
[1:44:57] we cannot go back to the church ages
[1:44:59] amen we have to be dead to that
[1:45:02] this is a bride age this is for the
[1:45:04] bride for the going home of the Bride
[1:45:09] in the first seal Prophet says now
[1:45:12] notice but it's to be revealed when the
[1:45:14] lamb leaves his intercessory place from
[1:45:16] the father
[1:45:17] now that's Revelation 5 now he takes the
[1:45:20] book of seals the book of seals or a
[1:45:22] book sealed with seals breaks them and
[1:45:24] shows them at the End of the Age now
[1:45:27] after the intercessory is over the
[1:45:29] church ages has done finished up
[1:45:32] so when does he break the seals at the
[1:45:35] at the End of the Age
[1:45:38] when does the messenger come at the End
[1:45:40] of the Age
[1:45:42] when does he break the seals when the
[1:45:44] church ages has done finished up
[1:45:50] we've mentioned before done finished up
[1:45:52] it doesn't mean laodicea is not going on
[1:45:57] it's not doesn't mean that the world's
[1:45:59] not in laodicea it doesn't mean that
[1:46:01] laodicea is not still marching to
[1:46:03] tribulation
[1:46:05] but that age is finished up
[1:46:09] for his bride
[1:46:11] the Pentecostal age bride is sealed
[1:46:16] now he's calling out of that age
[1:46:19] to seal a bride for the bride age
[1:46:22] God did what he was going to do in the
[1:46:25] laodicean church age with the
[1:46:26] Pentecostal bride
[1:46:28] he sealed them he called them they were
[1:46:30] genuine they were legitimate they were
[1:46:32] the Bride of the age
[1:46:35] but at some point he ended that
[1:46:37] dispensation
[1:46:39] and was no longer sealing a bride there
[1:46:42] but now he was calling her out
[1:46:45] there was a transition when when the
[1:46:48] church agents has done finished up
[1:46:56] brother Adam says if you would only know
[1:46:58] what they were living in
[1:47:01] there wouldn't be so much confusion
[1:47:03] about this message and about the
[1:47:04] scriptures that we're trying to bring to
[1:47:06] the people if the people only understood
[1:47:08] that we're at the end time
[1:47:11] brother said if you only knew where we
[1:47:13] were there wouldn't be all this
[1:47:14] confusion what made everybody confused
[1:47:16] is they didn't know where we were on the
[1:47:18] calendar
[1:47:20] we're confused about the message I'll
[1:47:22] tell you all the confusion I've had
[1:47:24] about the message through the years is
[1:47:25] because I didn't realize where we were
[1:47:27] on God's calendar
[1:47:30] when brother Benham says he says it may
[1:47:32] be later than you think I found out that
[1:47:35] was true
[1:47:37] I found that right clear that that was
[1:47:39] absolutely true it was later than I was
[1:47:42] thinking
[1:47:45] so if we only knew
[1:47:49] where we were at in God's calendar
[1:47:52] the message wouldn't be confusing
[1:47:56] if we think that we're part of the
[1:47:58] laodicean church and part of the laosian
[1:48:01] church age and
[1:48:03] then we're confused about things in the
[1:48:05] message
[1:48:07] but when we realized there's been a
[1:48:09] dispensational change
[1:48:11] there's been a door open in heaven and
[1:48:12] there's been a bridge that gapped the
[1:48:15] Gap to bring us into the bright age
[1:48:17] then all of a sudden the message becomes
[1:48:19] clear
[1:48:21] I want to read two scriptures now let's
[1:48:23] go to Daniel chapter 12.
[1:48:38] Daniel chapter 12.
[1:48:42] verse 8.
[1:48:55] Daniel chapter eight I'm sorry Daniel
[1:48:58] chapter 12 verse 8.
[1:49:03] he says
[1:49:05] and I heard but I understood not
[1:49:08] then said I oh my Lord what shall be the
[1:49:11] end of these things and he said go thy
[1:49:14] Way Daniel for the words are closed up
[1:49:16] and sealed till the time of the end
[1:49:19] Daniel wanted to know what the
[1:49:21] interpretation of some of these things
[1:49:22] were the events that he had seen he
[1:49:25] didn't understand he said I understood
[1:49:27] not and he was seeking understanding but
[1:49:29] he was told to go his way that the words
[1:49:32] are closed up and sealed to the time of
[1:49:34] the end so there's certain prophecies
[1:49:36] certain events certain things that were
[1:49:38] sealed until the time of the end so only
[1:49:41] in the end will they be open
[1:49:45] okay
[1:49:47] that's important that's an indicator of
[1:49:50] where we are in time
[1:49:52] let's go all the way over to revelation
[1:49:54] 22.
[1:50:01] actually before we get to revelation 22.
[1:50:05] let's go back to revelation 10.
[1:50:14] and go back to verse three Revelation 10
[1:50:16] 3 will pick up where we stopped reading
[1:50:20] and cried with the loud voices when the
[1:50:22] line roared and when he had cried seven
[1:50:24] Thunders out of their voices and when
[1:50:26] the seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:50:27] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[1:50:29] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:50:32] things with the seven Thunders uttered
[1:50:33] and write them not so here we have
[1:50:36] another ceiling up we know this really
[1:50:38] well we've been through it John was told
[1:50:40] everything you see write in a book and
[1:50:42] and so John is recording everything that
[1:50:45] he sees and hears and and when when we
[1:50:48] seize the symbol of the seals going out
[1:50:49] he sees a white horse and and a crown
[1:50:52] was given he writes it down when he sees
[1:50:53] a red horse and a sword he writes it
[1:50:55] down he writes it all down now when he
[1:50:57] comes and hears the seven Thunders he
[1:50:59] hears something that's understandable
[1:51:01] because he was going to write what he
[1:51:03] heard so there was something that was
[1:51:05] spoken something that you could
[1:51:06] understand something that you could
[1:51:07] write a description of
[1:51:10] but he was told to seal him up
[1:51:14] and write them not
[1:51:16] so now
[1:51:18] he's he's told not to write let's go to
[1:51:20] revelation 22.
[1:51:26] revelation 22 and 6.
[1:51:31] and he said unto me these sayings are
[1:51:33] faithful and true and the Lord God of
[1:51:35] the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show
[1:51:37] unto his servants the things which must
[1:51:39] shortly be done
[1:51:40] behold I come quickly blessed is he that
[1:51:43] keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:51:45] this book
[1:51:46] and I John saw these things and heard
[1:51:48] them and then I and when I had heard and
[1:51:51] seen I fell down to worship before the
[1:51:53] feet of the Angel which showed me these
[1:51:54] things
[1:51:55] then saith in to me see thou do it not
[1:51:57] for I am thy servant and of thy brother
[1:52:00] and the prophets and of them which keep
[1:52:02] the sayings of this book worship God so
[1:52:05] at this time in revelation 22 amen John
[1:52:08] is a type of the Bride there's an angel
[1:52:10] messenger who is taking him through and
[1:52:12] showing him all these Revelations which
[1:52:14] is a type of brother Branham and now
[1:52:16] this he said after I seen all of these
[1:52:19] things I fell down to worship at the
[1:52:21] feet of the Angel and the angel says
[1:52:23] don't do it but I'm of thy fellow
[1:52:26] servant of thy Brethren of the prophets
[1:52:28] so now he declares at the end he
[1:52:31] declares who he is I'm a prophet showing
[1:52:33] that this is the prophet brother Branham
[1:52:35] so at this time when this is understood
[1:52:37] then he says
[1:52:40] verse 10 and he said unto me seal not
[1:52:45] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[1:52:48] for the time is at hand
[1:52:53] seal not
[1:52:54] sealed in Daniel's day to the end
[1:52:58] sealed in the seven Thunders when they
[1:53:00] uttered in Revelation 10 seal it don't
[1:53:03] write it but when we come all the way to
[1:53:05] the end the last chapter of the Bible
[1:53:07] when John realizes who this was that
[1:53:10] given these Revelations when when he
[1:53:12] comes and then he tells him he says seal
[1:53:14] not the sayings the prophecies book for
[1:53:16] the time is at hand what time the end
[1:53:22] time
[1:53:23] the end time when this Prophet this
[1:53:26] Angel is showing these things to the
[1:53:28] bride then the time is at hand now it's
[1:53:31] time for whatever was sealed to be
[1:53:33] unsealed and for it not to be sealed
[1:53:35] anymore
[1:53:37] that's the day we live in
[1:53:42] brother Branham said in leadership now
[1:53:44] you see it's weak time now
[1:53:45] it's getting Harvest Time this is not
[1:53:48] Luther's age this is not Pentecost age
[1:53:50] this is the bride age
[1:53:53] as Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[1:53:55] Christ today is calling a church out of
[1:53:57] a church you see and the same thing is
[1:53:59] type taking them to the Glory's Eternal
[1:54:01] Promised Land
[1:54:02] now to refuse that person that's doing
[1:54:04] the calling Christ no matter if you're
[1:54:07] Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever
[1:54:10] you are you got to this age nothing
[1:54:12] against them not at all
[1:54:14] but in this age now you've got to accept
[1:54:17] like they did in that age the person of
[1:54:20] Christ which is the word
[1:54:23] then he quotes John 1 1. in the
[1:54:26] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:54:27] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:54:28] Word was made flesh into one Among Us
[1:54:30] the same yesterday today forever Hebrews
[1:54:32] 13 8. see you must accept that person of
[1:54:37] eternal life
[1:54:39] he says
[1:54:41] he's showing just like Moses called a
[1:54:44] nation out of a Nation now he's calling
[1:54:45] a church out of a church
[1:54:48] all right brother bam comes in the first
[1:54:49] seal and he says I'm going to call you
[1:54:51] bride so that you'll understand
[1:54:54] trying to show this is not Church
[1:54:56] systems Church ages church dispensations
[1:54:59] this is different
[1:55:03] and he says now just like Moses
[1:55:07] was called a nation of a Nation Christ
[1:55:10] today is calling church out of a church
[1:55:15] so who's doing the calling
[1:55:17] it's Christ
[1:55:20] how's he calling by revealing his word
[1:55:24] how is he calling his bride by revealing
[1:55:26] his word
[1:55:27] by opening his word by revealing the
[1:55:31] mystery of the seven Thunders by by
[1:55:33] tying all the loose ends together what's
[1:55:35] he doing he's calling his church why
[1:55:37] because he is the word he's calling them
[1:55:39] by the word because they also are the
[1:55:41] word
[1:55:42] and the word hears the word so it's the
[1:55:45] word Christ in our day that's calling
[1:55:47] the bride
[1:55:49] see we we get
[1:55:52] um
[1:55:53] we get so mixed up in our mind
[1:55:55] because we want to see a person in
[1:55:59] physical form
[1:56:01] but brother Adam said God is the word
[1:56:03] he said the word is God he says it over
[1:56:05] and over and over again he said Christ
[1:56:07] is the word Christ is the holy spirit
[1:56:09] Christ is God God is the Holy Spirit the
[1:56:11] holy spirit is God God is the word the
[1:56:13] word and the spirit are the same thing
[1:56:16] there's any old statements that he made
[1:56:19] we want to see a physical form but he's
[1:56:23] here he's calling how he is the word
[1:56:27] that's been restored
[1:56:29] he is the headship to the bride he is
[1:56:31] the person of the word he is here
[1:56:34] he's not limited he's not held in by by
[1:56:38] chains and barriers of denomination he's
[1:56:40] not held by chains of false
[1:56:42] understanding and false document he's
[1:56:43] been loosed he's here
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:47] and he's calling by revealing the
[1:56:49] Mysteries
[1:56:51] now listen now to refuse that person
[1:56:54] that's doing the calling Christ
[1:56:57] no matter if your Pentecostal method is
[1:56:59] Luther whatever you are
[1:57:01] nothing against them not at all but in
[1:57:03] this age now you've got to accept the
[1:57:05] person of Christ which is the word
[1:57:09] that's why it's so important to catch
[1:57:11] the changing of time
[1:57:13] because now when you catch the changing
[1:57:15] of time
[1:57:16] now I can't believe like I did in the
[1:57:20] church ages
[1:57:21] I can't act like I did in the church
[1:57:24] ages I can't conduct myself I I there's
[1:57:26] been a change and this change brings a
[1:57:29] whole change in the order
[1:57:31] just like the change in Moses day change
[1:57:33] in Paul's day all these changes brought
[1:57:35] a whole new order this change brought a
[1:57:37] whole new order
[1:57:39] and now I'm not I'm not worshiping by my
[1:57:43] church's Creed
[1:57:46] I'm not worshiping with a group
[1:57:48] mentality
[1:57:50] I'm not worshiping with old
[1:57:52] denominational understanding but now
[1:57:55] everything has changed to where now it's
[1:57:58] not my brothers not my sister it's not
[1:58:01] the ones around me but now I've been
[1:58:03] changed into a different there's a
[1:58:05] different time change now and now in
[1:58:08] this dispensation it's just me and him
[1:58:11] it's just bride and bridegroom to be in
[1:58:13] the bright age you yourself as an
[1:58:16] individual must be United to the
[1:58:18] bridegroom
[1:58:19] not a group uniting not a group Mary
[1:58:22] this isn't a group marriage
[1:58:24] it's an individual uniting with Christ
[1:58:27] in order to be in the bride age we as
[1:58:30] individuals must be United with the
[1:58:32] bridegroom
[1:58:33] we can't depend on what everybody else
[1:58:35] around us is doing it must be us and if
[1:58:38] we Unite with him then we take the
[1:58:41] headship of our bridegroom which is the
[1:58:43] headship of the word and now we don't
[1:58:45] make statements like my church teaches
[1:58:48] or my church believes or we all think
[1:58:50] amen now you lose all of that because
[1:58:52] you're under the headship of Christ
[1:58:54] because he is your husband and the
[1:58:57] headship of Christ is the word and now
[1:58:59] when somebody asks you why you do what
[1:59:00] you do you say because the word says
[1:59:03] yeah
[1:59:04] why did you make that decision not
[1:59:06] because our church teaches why did you
[1:59:08] make that decision because the word says
[1:59:12] this is a different age
[1:59:14] this is not this is not the church age
[1:59:16] this is a bride age and we must talk
[1:59:19] different act different react different
[1:59:20] worship different
[1:59:25] I mean in in the bright age we don't
[1:59:28] just worship on Sundays and Wednesdays
[1:59:31] because it's not the church
[1:59:33] it's the bride now we worship when we
[1:59:36] lay down we worship when we rise up amen
[1:59:38] now we talk to him all day we tell him
[1:59:41] we love him I don't just tell him I love
[1:59:42] him when a song comes up that says oh I
[1:59:44] love you amen I tell him I love him all
[1:59:46] day long because there's a union now
[1:59:48] between me and he
[1:59:51] it's so far beyond the church age it's
[1:59:54] so God wants us to be deliberated
[1:59:57] completely liberated from any chain that
[1:59:59] will bind us
[2:00:01] he wants us to be completely free to be
[2:00:03] his and his alone
[2:00:05] that's the age that we live in
[2:00:08] brother Venom said in Shalom he said
[2:00:10] this is a new day
[2:00:12] what does that mean there's been a
[2:00:13] turning of the calendar
[2:00:15] there's been a rising of the Sun
[2:00:17] he said there was one long day in the
[2:00:20] church ages one long day amen it was a
[2:00:23] dismal day neither light or dark
[2:00:26] is that what he said
[2:00:28] one long day in the church ages but now
[2:00:31] he comes to Shalom and he says but this
[2:00:33] is a new day
[2:00:35] this is not the church ages day not the
[2:00:37] obscurity of clouds of doctrines of men
[2:00:39] but this is the rising of the Sun
[2:00:43] this is a new day Hallelujah this is a
[2:00:45] day that we should rise and shine in the
[2:00:47] power of Jesus Christ gross Darkness
[2:00:49] settling upon the Earth they should be a
[2:00:51] new day for us
[2:00:52] indeed doing it just the way he does it
[2:00:55] but turn to his word and see the Promise
[2:00:57] that's promised for this day and you'll
[2:00:59] know whether you're living in daylight
[2:01:01] or not changing the calendar doesn't
[2:01:03] change the time it only changes the
[2:01:06] calendar
[2:01:08] this is for us 2023.
[2:01:11] right
[2:01:13] for us it's January 1st 2023.
[2:01:17] that's for us
[2:01:18] for God he already turned the calendar
[2:01:22] it's the same it is the rising of the
[2:01:24] Sun it is the new day it is beyond the
[2:01:28] darkness of denominations it is the
[2:01:31] newness of life it is the resurrection
[2:01:33] of the Bright Tree the restoration of
[2:01:35] the Bright Tree it is all of those
[2:01:37] things to God he's already turned the
[2:01:39] calendar
[2:01:41] and we need to live in that time not
[2:01:43] keep flipping calendars saying one day
[2:01:45] someday maybe so many times we hear
[2:01:49] things like maybe in 2023 maybe in 2024
[2:01:52] Maybe
[2:01:56] why don't we just walk in the day
[2:01:58] only we just walk in the light why don't
[2:02:01] we just accept the new day amen whatever
[2:02:04] I don't care what time it is on our
[2:02:06] calendar it's the same time on God's
[2:02:09] calendar
[2:02:10] and if there's a time that the atoms
[2:02:12] will change it's an appointed time amen
[2:02:14] so it's not going to matter where I flip
[2:02:16] the calendar or what I think 2023 maybe
[2:02:18] 2024. all we're doing is we're building
[2:02:21] an anticipation for a future event which
[2:02:24] is going to be wonderful but I don't
[2:02:26] want to be sitting on my haunches all
[2:02:28] the time anticipating a future event I
[2:02:31] want to be walking in the light of a new
[2:02:32] day I want to be experiencing the change
[2:02:34] in time the dispensation that I'm in I
[2:02:37] want to be in the bride age connected to
[2:02:39] the bridegroom enjoying my freedom and
[2:02:41] relationship
[2:02:43] not constantly deferring deferring
[2:02:46] deferring because all it does is build
[2:02:48] disappointment after disappointment
[2:02:50] after disappointment
[2:02:53] say I thought something would happen in
[2:02:55] 2022 nothing happened
[2:02:57] I thought something would happen listen
[2:02:59] the greatest thing that could ever
[2:03:01] happen to you has happened
[2:03:03] and what has happened is going to take
[2:03:05] us to the next happening
[2:03:07] amen he's here amen the bridegroom is
[2:03:10] here amen the the what the church is
[2:03:13] along for what what prophets have longed
[2:03:16] to see for thousands of years is what we
[2:03:18] see amen what they've longed to know is
[2:03:21] what we know the confusion of the church
[2:03:23] ages where they cannot see the light of
[2:03:25] the hour we've been given eyes to see
[2:03:27] and an eyes have to clear our eyes to
[2:03:29] where now we see the day that we're
[2:03:30] living in and what's going on and we're
[2:03:32] not making silly comments like amen
[2:03:35] someday amen someday he'll come and take
[2:03:37] me away he's here taking me away
[2:03:40] he's I'm walking with him he's walking
[2:03:43] me out of here amen Revelation by
[2:03:45] Revelation Truth by truth he's changing
[2:03:48] me into his very likeness amen I'm
[2:03:50] becoming more like him every day and he
[2:03:52] it's he who's carrying me out of here
[2:03:57] he has come
[2:03:59] to take me home
[2:04:04] so what's he doing he's taking me home
[2:04:09] amen
[2:04:11] I want to enjoy
[2:04:13] the day that I'm living in
[2:04:15] and I want to get the full benefit from
[2:04:18] the day that I'm living in
[2:04:21] and say God
[2:04:23] help me
[2:04:26] brother Benham said
[2:04:28] he made the statement
[2:04:30] I'm going to refer to this because I've
[2:04:31] heard it a few times here recently
[2:04:34] and and
[2:04:36] brother Brandon made the statement that
[2:04:38] laodicean church age would be a short
[2:04:41] age it'd be a short quick work and I
[2:04:43] haven't went back to look at all the
[2:04:45] quotes I've just heard people say it and
[2:04:46] say it was the shortest age of all it'll
[2:04:48] be a short age and we know that so far
[2:04:51] Ephesus has been the shortest stage is
[2:04:53] that right
[2:04:54] 117 years
[2:04:56] well if we make it past the first week
[2:04:58] of April this year we will have crossed
[2:05:00] 117 years
[2:05:03] is that right
[2:05:05] and the question is what will happen to
[2:05:07] multitudes of people if we get through
[2:05:09] 2023
[2:05:11] and what they're looking forward to
[2:05:13] happening
[2:05:15] doesn't happen
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:17] brother Branham said laodicea would be a
[2:05:19] short quick work would be the shortest
[2:05:21] age
[2:05:22] but brother Branham said the prophet
[2:05:24] would come at the End of the Age
[2:05:27] right
[2:05:29] not in the middle of the age
[2:05:34] does that make sense
[2:05:35] because if we take the ministry of 1963
[2:05:38] and you start 1906 and you go to 2022 he
[2:05:40] would have come in the middle of the age
[2:05:43] but brother rest says over and over and
[2:05:45] over he comes at the end of the age
[2:05:48] to open up a new day open up a new age
[2:05:51] open up a new way
[2:05:54] so is laodicean continuing on yes for
[2:05:57] the church not for the bride
[2:05:59] for the bride it was the shortest age
[2:06:03] for the elect it was the shortest age
[2:06:06] for the elect it is over
[2:06:09] I hope that nobody crosses that
[2:06:11] threshold and said oh it's been 117
[2:06:13] years now we've crossed that oh my maybe
[2:06:15] the prophet was wrong maybe he had a
[2:06:16] wrong prediction my goodness let the
[2:06:19] word open our understanding give us I
[2:06:22] Salve to see what day we're in he's
[2:06:24] already turned that calendar Fred I'm
[2:06:26] not waiting for him to turn that counter
[2:06:28] he's already turned that calendar
[2:06:31] I have already by his grace escaped the
[2:06:34] laodicean church age and been brought in
[2:06:36] by him to the age of Grace
[2:06:40] to the bright age
[2:06:42] through a marriage through a union with
[2:06:45] the headship of Christ
[2:06:47] don't let any of those things bother you
[2:06:50] even a tiny bit
[2:06:53] God is on and frankly I don't know what
[2:06:55] God will do
[2:06:57] we may take a translation before I think
[2:06:59] it's April 6th or April 9th we may take
[2:07:01] a translation before that I'd be happy
[2:07:05] with that
[2:07:06] but I wouldn't be surprised if God lets
[2:07:08] it go on beyond that
[2:07:10] just to wake people up to where we are
[2:07:14] where are we if he said that and we're
[2:07:17] here what does it mean amen it begs the
[2:07:20] question it's a question that God needs
[2:07:22] to answer
[2:07:24] and I say thank God for me he's answered
[2:07:26] it
[2:07:27] by revelation
[2:07:29] praise be to God
[2:07:32] and I may be a little wrong in the dates
[2:07:33] I didn't go back and look it up I've
[2:07:34] just heard it I haven't even went back
[2:07:36] to look at the quotes I just know these
[2:07:37] things you've heard them for years
[2:07:39] but don't let them bother you friends
[2:07:42] in fact if that date whatever it is
[2:07:45] comes and goes and we sail on by and and
[2:07:48] now from 1906 to whatever date we're in
[2:07:50] ends up being beyond the time that was
[2:07:52] allocated to Ephesus you can smile and
[2:07:55] whistle and walk down the road and say
[2:07:57] I'm in a new day amen that day already
[2:07:59] happened for me amen it happened when I
[2:08:01] realized that I am not allowed to sin
[2:08:04] amen I'm not in the Pentecostal age but
[2:08:06] I'm his bride been raptured into his
[2:08:09] bride age
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:11] then there's no trouble that will enter
[2:08:13] your mind
[2:08:15] for God has been so good
[2:08:19] to lay his Secrets out
[2:08:21] but do it in a way only the elect will
[2:08:24] catch
[2:08:28] brother man says in God's word calls for
[2:08:30] total separation from unbelief says as I
[2:08:33] preached to you Sunday the great
[2:08:34] Symphony of God's word being beat out
[2:08:36] the changes injunctions is only God
[2:08:39] Changing Times
[2:08:40] like the director in the symphony when
[2:08:42] we see these changes of Ages and changes
[2:08:45] of times look down on the sheet here and
[2:08:47] you'll find out where we're supposed to
[2:08:50] be here
[2:08:52] you look at the Bible to find out where
[2:08:55] we're supposed to be
[2:08:56] if we read our Bible and we match it
[2:08:58] with brother branham's Ministry in the
[2:09:00] end time events you recognize that we've
[2:09:04] come through the first three chapters
[2:09:06] we've come through chapter 4 chapter 5
[2:09:09] chapter 6 chapter 10.
[2:09:12] you start to look at this and you can
[2:09:14] say well where am I well I can find
[2:09:16] myself in Revelation 10 8 to 11.
[2:09:19] I can find myself over in revelation 22
[2:09:22] 17 in the spirit and the bride say come
[2:09:25] I can find myself there and when the
[2:09:27] prophet says she'll be the final voice
[2:09:29] to the final age what the spirit and the
[2:09:31] message and the bride will all be saying
[2:09:32] the same thing what they'll be saying
[2:09:34] has already been said in the word come
[2:09:35] out from among her and be ye separate
[2:09:37] where do I find that I find that in
[2:09:39] Revelation 10 17 and 18 I find it in
[2:09:43] Revelations 22 17. one is when the
[2:09:47] messenger declares it
[2:09:49] in the 18th chapter of Revelations and
[2:09:52] in the 22nd chapter of Revelations is
[2:09:54] when the bride declares it
[2:09:57] so where are we
[2:10:00] at the end of the book
[2:10:05] where in the end of the book chapter 22
[2:10:09] the very last chapter of the book where
[2:10:10] are we bride
[2:10:12] at the end
[2:10:15] what are we doing we're calling for
[2:10:17] those to come out come out from among
[2:10:20] her and be separate
[2:10:22] it's the bride call ing the bride out of
[2:10:26] systems out of man's doctrines out of
[2:10:28] denomination out of church ages to be
[2:10:30] United with Christ the spirit and the
[2:10:33] bride are calling come
[2:10:36] where do we find ourselves Beyond so
[2:10:39] many things that people are looking for
[2:10:41] to happen
[2:10:42] they're happening now in the bride and
[2:10:45] people walk by you at work and don't
[2:10:47] have a clue what's going on in that
[2:10:49] stable
[2:10:51] I have no idea who that boy is walking
[2:10:53] down the road
[2:10:56] Jesus was walking maybe I don't know
[2:10:59] what he was doing maybe carrying a book
[2:11:01] maybe going to school maybe going to
[2:11:03] fetch something
[2:11:04] for Joseph
[2:11:06] maybe he was going down and he had to go
[2:11:07] get something and he gets it and he's
[2:11:09] thinking all the way there thinking all
[2:11:10] the way back and he's walking past tons
[2:11:12] of people who have no idea who he is
[2:11:17] he's the revelation of the mystery
[2:11:18] that's been in God's mind since before
[2:11:20] the foundations were and they don't know
[2:11:21] who he is
[2:11:23] but just the same you walk down the road
[2:11:26] and people don't know who you are or
[2:11:28] what's going on inside of you
[2:11:30] what is it it's a dispensational change
[2:11:33] where did it change in you
[2:11:36] where is it going on in you and I that's
[2:11:39] the same place where the kingdom of God
[2:11:40] is in you
[2:11:42] people walk by and where's the kingdom
[2:11:44] of God where's the kingdom of God the
[2:11:45] kingdom of God is here
[2:11:47] it's in you
[2:11:49] but it's it's
[2:11:52] the presence of God unrecognized
[2:11:56] but everyone says and God's only provide
[2:11:58] a place of worship he says now think
[2:12:00] these men why was they called and was
[2:12:02] put in the in this condition these
[2:12:04] Pharisees by Jesus in vain you worship
[2:12:06] me worship Him genuine worship true
[2:12:09] worship from their hearts in vain you
[2:12:11] worship me why teaching for doctrine of
[2:12:13] traditions and Men therefore you make
[2:12:15] the Commandments of God of no effect to
[2:12:17] the people
[2:12:19] if I taught you Methodist message it
[2:12:21] would take no effect on you this is
[2:12:23] bride time
[2:12:26] if Moses taught the message of Noah it
[2:12:28] would take no effect if Jesus taught
[2:12:30] Moses message it would take no effect
[2:12:31] because the predestinated seed or laying
[2:12:34] there that will only be watered by that
[2:12:37] type of water that's given for that seed
[2:12:40] it won't grow any other condition it
[2:12:44] must be the condition that grows it
[2:12:49] Pentecostal Doctrine will not grow the
[2:12:51] seed
[2:12:53] Lutheran Doctrine Methodist Doctrine it
[2:12:56] will not grow the seed Episcopalian
[2:12:59] Doctrine Catholic that will not grow
[2:13:01] that seed
[2:13:02] there's only one thing and that's the
[2:13:05] word for this day
[2:13:06] because this is pride time
[2:13:10] what time is it on God's calendar I can
[2:13:13] tell you it's bride time
[2:13:15] what time is the day bride time which is
[2:13:18] what it's synonymous with Rapture time
[2:13:20] synonymous within time it's all of that
[2:13:23] goes together
[2:13:25] synonymous with the coming of the Lord
[2:13:26] bride time coming of the lord The
[2:13:29] Rapture the end time it all goes
[2:13:31] together and that's this time
[2:13:34] and I thank God that I can be alive in
[2:13:37] this time
[2:13:39] so we turn the calendar that might mean
[2:13:41] something for doctor's appointments and
[2:13:43] for graduations and for years spent in
[2:13:45] school and years of employment but for
[2:13:48] me the calendar's already turned
[2:13:51] and I'm in the new day
[2:13:53] I'm still in the new day
[2:13:55] and I will be in this new day for
[2:13:58] eternity
[2:13:59] the only thing that's going to change is
[2:14:02] my atoms
[2:14:03] and I'll take a translation
[2:14:06] but I have United with Christ
[2:14:09] by his grace he has presented himself
[2:14:12] and unveiled himself to me and put
[2:14:14] inside of me a heart that says you're
[2:14:15] the one I want
[2:14:17] and I surrender to you
[2:14:19] 've come into that Union by his grace
[2:14:21] and for me this is the day this is the
[2:14:25] only day this is the great church Age
[2:14:28] The Eternal Church age at the end of the
[2:14:31] seven Church ages and by Grace the door
[2:14:34] in Heaven's been opened
[2:14:36] he's drawn me to
[2:14:38] him God bless you let's all stand
[2:14:41] we just thank God musicians if you'll
[2:14:43] come
[2:14:44] brother Blake if you'll come
[2:14:49] once you see the difference between the
[2:14:51] church age and the bride age
[2:14:52] the question is who in the world wants
[2:14:55] to be in the church age
[2:14:59] when you see
[2:15:01] the when you see in Revelation chapter 3
[2:15:05] what he says about the latest in church
[2:15:07] age who in the world wants to be in the
[2:15:09] late Asian Church
[2:15:12] when you see all that the prophet says
[2:15:15] about it who wants to be there
[2:15:18] let's just cross that bridge
[2:15:21] to a new day
[2:15:24] a door's been opened
[2:15:26] a calendar page has been turned
[2:15:28] and for us it's the greatest thing that
[2:15:30] has happened in our lives the greatest
[2:15:33] privilege is to be alive in this time
[2:15:38] many prophets and righteous men have
[2:15:40] longed to see your day and have not seen
[2:15:42] it but blessed are your eyes for they
[2:15:44] see in your ears for you here
[2:15:47] you saw the type of Ahab and Jezebel you
[2:15:50] saw Elijah you saw
[2:15:52] how did you see it by the grace of God
[2:15:55] you saw it
[2:15:57] multitudes can't see it multitudes can't
[2:16:01] see Ahab and Jezebel system backing up
[2:16:03] and Elijah the prophet and the sin at
[2:16:05] the same time but for you it is obvious
[2:16:07] as obvious can be why because it's given
[2:16:10] to you to see
[2:16:13] I'm so thankful we think about all the
[2:16:16] times of pastimes and all the great
[2:16:18] events that have taken place and but but
[2:16:21] brother Venom said the greatest time is
[2:16:23] this time
[2:16:24] this is the greatest time
[2:16:27] and this is the time that he's allowed
[2:16:28] you and I to live and I I want to say
[2:16:32] this is the day that the Lord has made
[2:16:34] and I will rejoice and be glad
[2:16:38] do we want to take a translation yes of
[2:16:40] course we do
[2:16:42] I mean
[2:16:43] we want to get out of these Fallen
[2:16:45] bodies absolutely we do
[2:16:48] but I am so thankful
[2:16:50] for the new light of the new day
[2:16:54] I'm so grateful I'm not trapped in
[2:16:56] denominationalism I'm so thankful I'm
[2:16:58] not bound in the chains of false
[2:17:01] understanding I am so grateful to be
[2:17:03] here I want to worship him in the light
[2:17:05] of a new day
[2:17:07] with all of my heart I want to dedicate
[2:17:09] it to him and give him my whole life
[2:17:11] because he's worth
[2:17:14] his power heads
[2:17:17] Lord Jesus we thank you for this
[2:17:21] God it is
[2:17:22] it is remarkable to us
[2:17:25] what you've done in our day
[2:17:28] it's overwhelming sometimes when we
[2:17:30] think about the consequences
[2:17:32] of what it is you've done
[2:17:34] what it means what does it mean
[2:17:38] when Paul says lo we turn to the
[2:17:41] Gentiles
[2:17:42] what did that mean it meant everything
[2:17:45] it was a change Lord that that that
[2:17:48] brought a change to thousands hundreds
[2:17:51] of thousands millions of individuals
[2:17:53] when Paul said Lord turned to the
[2:17:55] Gentiles
[2:17:57] something that seems so simple in human
[2:17:59] mind a a short conversation in a one
[2:18:03] city one event
[2:18:05] but oh God it was you Changing Times
[2:18:09] and God there's things that happen in
[2:18:11] this day to multitudes they don't
[2:18:14] recognize it it seems small and
[2:18:16] insignificant
[2:18:17] but for us it's everything Lord
[2:18:20] you've changed the times again
[2:18:22] the dispensations have changed the
[2:18:25] church age dispensation for your bride
[2:18:27] is over the door to Heaven has been
[2:18:29] opened the the bride age is accessible
[2:18:32] now again
[2:18:34] God I pray you'd help us Lord to move
[2:18:36] from the carnal and to the spiritual
[2:18:38] Lord help us to be liberated from the
[2:18:41] carnal from carnal understanding and
[2:18:43] carnal life help us to be liberated into
[2:18:46] a spiritual life Lord into a union with
[2:18:48] you
[2:18:49] Lord I pray you'd bring your children to
[2:18:52] yourself in this hour
[2:18:54] God give I saav for those who have not
[2:18:56] yet seen that they might see and give us
[2:19:00] greater ice staff those who have seen we
[2:19:02] want to see more clearly Lord
[2:19:04] wash away all of the wrong understanding
[2:19:07] wash away all of the hang on Lord move
[2:19:11] it away from us
[2:19:12] that we might see this day in the full
[2:19:15] light that is available in this day
[2:19:18] keep revealing and unveiling yourself to
[2:19:20] us for we love it Lord
[2:19:23] and God as we walk in this new day let
[2:19:26] us be bright and Shining lights in this
[2:19:28] world that we won't be so consumed with
[2:19:30] ourselves and our own thoughts and our
[2:19:33] own desires that will miss Lord that you
[2:19:36] are here shining through your bride
[2:19:39] and that we might be vessels that you
[2:19:41] can light the world through
