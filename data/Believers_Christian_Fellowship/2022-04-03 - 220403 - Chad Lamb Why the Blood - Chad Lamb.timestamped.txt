[14:10] lord is break the bread of life
[14:12] would you feed us your sheep this

[14:30] christ's name we pray
[14:32] amen
[14:33] man god bless you this morning it's good
[14:35] to be together if we could turn in our
[14:37] bibles to acts chapter 20 we'll begin in
[14:40] acts chapter 20.
[14:42] i also want to welcome a couple of
[14:43] visitors we've got a brother paul
[14:45] hartland and his wife are here from new
[14:47] brunswick
[14:48] and so i got to meet him yesterday and
[14:50] shake his hand and spend a few minutes
[14:51] with him he drove three days to be here
[14:54] with us
[14:55] so i don't think any of us are more
[14:56] prepared than that brother and his wife
[14:58] for the service this morning so god
[15:00] bless you and it's good to have brother
[15:01] carlson sampson and his wife back with
[15:03] us again they were here a couple weeks
[15:05] ago we got to see them so we appreciate
[15:07] them coming down from ontario
[15:09] and then also sister elaine moulton
[15:12] sister carolyn colai's mom is here she
[15:14] was here wednesday god bless you it's
[15:15] good to have you here so i don't know if
[15:17] you've noticed but the canadians have
[15:18] moved down
[15:20] i don't know if we should be nervous i
[15:22] don't know what to expect next but
[15:25] a lot of canadians are converging in
[15:27] limo ohio but praise god it's getting
[15:29] easier to travel now the borders are
[15:31] getting easier to cross and we thank god
[15:33] that we can enjoy this fellowship
[15:35] together amen
[15:37] let's look at acts chapter 20.
[15:41] also i want to remind you there is
[15:42] communion service this afternoon so
[15:44] we'll gather again for communion and
[15:46] feet washing and also we'll have the
[15:48] vote of confidence for the trustees and
[15:50] sunday school superintendents but i'd
[15:52] like to do that right at the beginning
[15:53] before we start the song service so if
[15:55] you can make sure you're back early for
[15:57] the service and we'll do that right away
[15:59] and then go into the song service this
[16:01] afternoon
[16:03] all right acts chapter 20 verse 28.
[16:10] take heed therefore unto yourselves into
[16:12] all the flock over the which the holy
[16:14] ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[16:17] the church of god which he hath
[16:19] purchased with his own
[16:20] blood and god bless you as you take your
[16:23] seats
[16:24] amen may god bless us as we look into
[16:26] his word
[16:28] i wanted to take for a subject this
[16:30] morning why the blood
[16:32] and it's interesting because it's such a
[16:34] major theme in christianity as the blood
[16:37] it's a theme that runs from genesis to
[16:40] revelation
[16:41] and i was just meditating on it i don't
[16:43] even know why well i know why because
[16:45] god does everything and he leads us but
[16:47] i was just meditating and i'm just
[16:49] meditating on that question why the
[16:51] blood and i felt like i knew the answer
[16:53] but i really wanted to dive in and take
[16:55] a look at it because when we see there's
[16:57] there's there's fundamental things to
[17:00] christianity that all christians talk
[17:02] about
[17:03] all denominations everybody will begin
[17:05] talking about the blood the blood of
[17:06] jesus the blood of the sacrifice
[17:09] amen but i found that the denominational
[17:12] understanding and all these things is is
[17:14] weak at best and not not really fully
[17:17] developed with the understanding god
[17:18] wants us to have but also all these
[17:20] things that are basics i would say
[17:24] amen there
[17:25] they're absolutely wonderful truths when
[17:27] we go to look at them and don't take
[17:29] them for granted amen so many things
[17:31] become phrases or cliches or subjects
[17:34] that we take for granted or we feel like
[17:36] we understand but when we really go to
[17:38] look at it and the light of the message
[17:39] that's been given to us in this day
[17:41] these things that we thought were so
[17:43] basic they explode into depths that we
[17:45] can't even reach i mean we can't even
[17:47] fathom the depths of this and so i just
[17:49] wanted to take the service this morning
[17:51] and maybe in the way of a sunday school
[17:53] lesson so keep your bibles handy we'll
[17:55] we'll
[17:56] just go through a lot of scriptures this
[17:58] morning but i want to talk about why the
[18:00] blood
[18:01] and it says here in acts chapter 20
[18:03] verse 28
[18:05] to told them to feed the church of god
[18:07] which he hath purchased with his own
[18:09] blood
[18:10] whose blood
[18:12] god's blood
[18:13] that's what acts 20 28 tells us feed the
[18:16] flock of god which he hath purchased
[18:17] with his own blood so we know that the
[18:20] blood was a purchasing price for the
[18:22] church of god amen so praise be to god
[18:25] we have been purchased with blood
[18:29] with god's blood
[18:31] i'd say that's pretty valuable
[18:34] i'd say that makes us
[18:35] worth something amen
[18:38] at least we're something to god
[18:40] let's go to hebrews chapter 9.
[18:51] hebrews chapter 9.
[18:56] and we'll read just one verse verse 22
[18:59] hebrews 9 and 22
[19:01] and almost all things are by the law
[19:04] purged with blood and without shedding
[19:06] of blood is no remission
[19:09] so this is a principle that that comes
[19:12] all the way through the scripture
[19:14] that all things almost all things are by
[19:16] the law purged with blood purge means
[19:18] purified
[19:20] or cleansed and without the shedding of
[19:22] blood is no remission
[19:24] so we see this and brother bam tells us
[19:27] in the message fellowship you cannot
[19:29] have fellowship with god without coming
[19:30] to god's agreement
[19:32] and there is a basic thing for
[19:34] fellowship and that's the blood
[19:36] the blood only it's been god's way from
[19:38] the beginning and it will be till the
[19:40] end the only place of fellowship is
[19:43] through the blood
[19:44] so we know that and i think we could say
[19:46] that in any any church in the world any
[19:50] denominational church anywhere and they
[19:52] would say amen to that but what the
[19:54] message has done is taken us deeper into
[19:56] that amen so that we can understand how
[19:59] to fellowship under the blood what does
[20:01] it mean to have the blood applied amen
[20:04] what is the the what what is this not a
[20:06] cliche not a phrase not not something
[20:09] that you know we were taught to repeat
[20:11] in sunday school but what is the real
[20:14] depth of this understanding about the
[20:16] blood
[20:17] it was from the beginning it's been
[20:18] god's way from the beginning and god has
[20:21] never changed his mind about that
[20:24] so the only place of fellowship is
[20:26] through the blood
[20:28] go to revelation 13.
[20:32] revelation chapter 13
[20:41] revelation 13 8
[20:44] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[20:46] worship him whose names
[20:50] whose names are not written in the book
[20:52] of life of the lamb slain from the
[20:54] foundation of the world
[20:57] so we have in in the mind of god we have
[21:00] a lamb slain from the foundation of the
[21:02] world
[21:03] and that that lamb would be jesus christ
[21:08] when he was made in flesh and that flesh
[21:10] would be the word made flesh in that
[21:13] that flesh would die and the blood would
[21:15] be shed and we know that it was the
[21:16] blood of god it was created blood
[21:19] and but from the beginning from the
[21:21] foundation of the world amen the lamb
[21:24] was slain so this has been god's plan
[21:26] from the beginning and it's been god's
[21:28] plan throughout and god has never
[21:30] changed his mind amen so i think this is
[21:33] a a very important subject
[21:35] let's go to leviticus leviticus chapter
[21:38] 17
[21:39] if we could
[21:43] we're going from one end to the other
[21:45] god bless you this is like sword drills
[21:47] in sunday school class
[21:49] i won't make you stand up when you find
[21:50] it uh
[21:53] the kids would beat us all
[21:55] because they're still doing it in sunday
[21:57] school class
[21:59] all right
[22:00] leviticus chapter 17
[22:03] and verse 10.
[22:09] leviticus 17 and 10. and whatsoever man
[22:13] there be of the house of israel
[22:16] or of the strangers that so join among
[22:18] you that eateth any manner of blood
[22:21] i will even set my face against that
[22:23] soul that eateth blood and will cut him
[22:25] off from among his people
[22:27] for the life of the flesh is in the
[22:29] blood
[22:31] and i've given it to you upon the altar
[22:33] to make an atonement for your souls
[22:37] for it is the blood that maketh an
[22:40] atonement for your souls so now
[22:43] god is now speaking here in leviticus
[22:46] that you're not the mankind is not to
[22:48] eat the blood because the life is in the
[22:51] blood and he said it's the blood that
[22:53] made an atonement upon the altar for
[22:55] your souls and atonement means a
[22:57] covering here so i'm made of covering
[23:00] for you to cover your sin uh to cover
[23:02] your souls amen by this blood because
[23:06] the life is in the blood so we find out
[23:08] this subject of blood has to do with
[23:11] life amen it's actually a subject that
[23:13] has to do with life and it has to do
[23:15] with death
[23:17] it has to do with redemption a fallen a
[23:19] redemption and so he says the life of
[23:22] the flesh is in the blood
[23:24] i will give it to you upon the altar to
[23:26] make an atonement for your souls for it
[23:28] is the blood that maketh an atonement
[23:30] for the soul
[23:31] therefore i said unto the children of
[23:32] israel no soul of you shall eat blood
[23:35] neither shall any stranger that so
[23:36] joineth among you eat blood
[23:39] and whatsoever man there be of the
[23:40] children of israel of the stranger that
[23:42] sojourn among you which hunteth and
[23:45] catcheth any beast or fowl that may be
[23:47] eaten he shall even pour out the blood
[23:50] thereof and cover it with dust
[23:53] for it is the life of all flesh and the
[23:55] blood of his blood of it is for the life
[23:58] thereof therefore i said unto the
[24:00] children of israel you shall eat you
[24:03] shall eat the blood of no manner of
[24:04] flesh for the life of all flesh is the
[24:07] blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall
[24:10] be cut off
[24:11] so god is establishing a major truth for
[24:15] us that the life of all flesh is the
[24:17] blood thereof and that blood is given
[24:20] upon the altars and atonement so we know
[24:22] that life is a sacred thing to god all
[24:24] life is sacred to god
[24:27] and the blood that represents the life
[24:29] where it is the the life of all flesh is
[24:32] in the blood and so god would god would
[24:35] not allow man to eat of that blood but
[24:38] the blood must go back into the ground
[24:40] amen and not to be eaten or upon the
[24:43] altar to be a covering for mankind so
[24:46] god is is showing us that life is a
[24:49] precious thing that the blood represents
[24:51] the life and the blood is to be held
[24:54] sacred or precious because it's an
[24:56] atonement for our souls
[24:58] now the prophet of god says jesus christ
[25:01] is saying yesterday today and forever
[25:03] therefore
[25:05] when
[25:06] when god made a remedy for man to be
[25:08] saved in the garden of eden they tried
[25:10] to improve his remedy through six
[25:12] thousand years and can never touch it
[25:15] he made upon the basis of the shed blood
[25:17] of an innocent victim and he's never
[25:20] changed it
[25:21] we've tried to educate people to christ
[25:24] we've tried to denominate them to christ
[25:26] we've tried all kinds of systems but
[25:28] they've all failed there's only one
[25:30] place that men can meet on a common
[25:32] ground and of worship and that is under
[25:34] the shed blood of jesus christ it's been
[25:37] that way from the beginning because he
[25:38] cannot change it it's always the blood
[25:42] the blood
[25:44] amen
[25:45] you know really i
[25:47] i remember as a boy growing up in uh
[25:50] denominational churches and i remember
[25:53] these concepts and it's hard to go back
[25:56] and remember what you thought back then
[25:59] in detail because you change as time
[26:01] goes on and your understanding and
[26:02] revelation changes but i remember as a
[26:05] boy hearing about the blood all of my
[26:07] life and the blood of jesus christ and
[26:09] the blood of bulls and goats and then
[26:10] the blood of jesus christ and redemption
[26:13] by blood and cleansed by the blood and
[26:15] all of these things but i realized
[26:18] growing up that they were just
[26:19] terminologies amen and i knew somehow
[26:22] they meant salvation
[26:24] i knew somehow they meant salvation and
[26:26] that jesus died for me and i understood
[26:28] that concept but but there's a concept
[26:30] with the blood and with the life amen
[26:33] that goes deeper than that
[26:35] let's go to genesis chapter 3.
[26:42] it took a prophet of god in this age
[26:45] to come and pull these things out so
[26:47] that the bible is not things that that
[26:50] that we are constantly shrugging our
[26:52] shoulders about
[26:54] i don't know why but i don't know why
[26:56] this i don't know i just i don't know
[26:58] but god he wanted to unveil himself to
[27:00] his children so that we weren't always
[27:02] going i don't know i don't know i don't
[27:04] know but he would say no there's been a
[27:06] prophet of god who showed us in the word
[27:08] what that what god wants to reveal
[27:10] himself to his children god wants to be
[27:12] known
[27:14] god wants us to understand what he's
[27:16] done for us
[27:18] he wants us to know this earth is part
[27:20] of our education so that we can know god
[27:23] and know about god in a way we could
[27:25] have never comprehended in perfection
[27:27] so god allowed certain things to
[27:29] transpire he did not make them transpire
[27:32] but he allowed them to transpire that
[27:34] would drop us down into a negative so
[27:36] that the negative would help us to
[27:38] understand the positives
[27:41] and so this this is our schooling this
[27:43] is our education and there's things that
[27:45] he's done and he wants us to understand
[27:47] why
[27:49] so let's look at genesis chapter 3 verse
[27:52] 21.
[27:57] unto adam also and to his wife did the
[27:59] lord god make coats of skins and clothe
[28:02] them
[28:03] we see here this is after the fall and
[28:06] god comes down to judge his children and
[28:08] judge the earth or curse the earth and
[28:10] judge the serpent and when he's doing
[28:12] this now
[28:14] he has to make an atonement for them and
[28:16] the atonement or the covering that he's
[28:18] going to make for them is he's going to
[28:19] use the skins of animals well the only
[28:21] way to get the skins of animals is to
[28:23] slay the animal so this is the first
[28:25] time in the account that we have in
[28:28] scripture this is the first account of
[28:31] death or shedding of blood
[28:34] and the first account we have of
[28:36] shedding of blood is is the blood jesus
[28:39] that god himself as a father coming down
[28:41] into the garden amen to cover his law
[28:44] his fallen children he slays an animal
[28:47] an innocent animal he slays and he puts
[28:50] the skins over them to cover their
[28:52] nakedness because now the veil of
[28:54] innocency has been removed and they're
[28:56] under a veil of lust and now can see
[28:58] each other as naked so god makes an
[29:00] atonement or a covering for them and he
[29:02] sheds the blood of an innocent victim
[29:04] amen to make an atonement for them
[29:07] what's he doing he is showing his
[29:09] redemption story already here in the
[29:11] very beginning of the book of genesis
[29:14] he's showing what is it going to take
[29:16] amen to cover what is it going to take
[29:18] to redeem to restore fellowship it's
[29:20] going to take the shed blood of an
[29:22] innocent victim
[29:24] it was god's plan from the beginning and
[29:26] this plan amen runs all the way through
[29:29] the bible because jesus christ was the
[29:31] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[29:32] world
[29:35] so
[29:37] so now we begin to see
[29:39] this story unfold that god himself
[29:44] slayed the lamb
[29:46] and clothed his fallen children
[29:50] and he did that to preserve them in some
[29:52] way so that his
[29:55] his uh work can continue on until he can
[29:59] complete it
[30:01] and the message i will restore from 1955
[30:04] brother iran says notice now that's the
[30:06] same kind of revelation that abel got
[30:09] because it was revealed to him that it
[30:11] wasn't apples that brought us out of the
[30:13] garden
[30:14] like people think here today but it was
[30:17] blood
[30:18] life
[30:19] mortal life
[30:20] and it was revealed by god and god
[30:22] received this man abel and condemned
[30:24] cain
[30:26] so we realize now that cain he also will
[30:29] shed blood let's look at this in chapter
[30:32] four
[30:35] chapter 4 verse 1 and adam knew eve his
[30:37] wife and she conceived and bear cain and
[30:39] said i have gotten a man from from the
[30:41] lord and she again bear his brother abel
[30:44] and abel was a keeper of sheep
[30:47] so what was abel a keeper of sheep
[30:51] sheep
[30:52] lambs
[30:55] he's a keeper of sheep but cain was a
[30:57] tiller of the ground
[30:58] and in the process of time it came to
[31:00] pass that cain brought of the fruit of
[31:01] the ground an offering unto the lord and
[31:04] abel he also brought of the first things
[31:06] of his flock the first things of his
[31:08] flock was what a lamb
[31:11] he brought a lamb first things of his
[31:12] flock and the fat thereof and the lord
[31:14] had respect unto abel into his offering
[31:16] but until came into his offering he had
[31:19] no respect and cain was very wroth and
[31:21] his countenance fell
[31:24] we we have the this the first form of
[31:26] worship that we see from fallen man
[31:29] going to offer worship to god and they
[31:31] go to make a sacrifice and cain offers
[31:34] the fruits of the field his labor his
[31:37] works and and it is so interesting that
[31:39] that program continues on today because
[31:42] we have people who think that my
[31:45] oh
[31:46] they think that my bad deeds separated
[31:48] me from god so in order to make a
[31:51] recompense for bad deeds i have to do
[31:52] good deeds and good deeds will equal my
[31:55] salvation
[31:57] that's why it's easy for a church to
[31:59] have a works program
[32:01] that it was my bad deeds that separated
[32:03] me from god and so now if i if i do
[32:07] enough good deeds and i serve the church
[32:09] and i serve god and i do all the right
[32:11] things that i can be brought back into
[32:14] fellowship of god and be saved that's
[32:16] cain's religion
[32:20] but abel's religion was based on
[32:22] revelation and he knew abel knew it was
[32:25] not his bad deeds that got him out of
[32:27] the garden
[32:29] and there's no amount of good deeds that
[32:31] could get him back into the garden amen
[32:33] it wasn't there was something else that
[32:35] took place that caused him for the
[32:38] fellowship to be broken that caused him
[32:40] to be separated from god
[32:42] and so there was no way
[32:44] and there was an impossibility for abel
[32:47] to work his way back into fellowship and
[32:50] good standing with god there was no way
[32:52] for him to redeem himself amen by
[32:55] revelation god gave him a revelation of
[32:58] why he was outside of the garden and why
[33:01] he needed to bring a sacrifice and why
[33:03] he had to wear the skins of animals
[33:06] and that revelation that he had
[33:08] explained his condition
[33:11] i'm so glad that god gave us a
[33:13] revelation his hour that will explain
[33:15] our condition amen
[33:17] so that we won't be tossed about by all
[33:19] these wins and doctrines and systems of
[33:21] men and programs and remember we'll come
[33:23] back to the reality amen of why we must
[33:26] have an atonement to begin with
[33:30] so he brought a lamb the firstlings of
[33:33] his flock he was a keeper of sheep so he
[33:35] brought a lamb and brother bam says in
[33:37] the mark of the beast and the seal of
[33:39] god from 1961 he says but now but how
[33:42] there was no bible in that day so it
[33:44] must have been revealed to abel
[33:46] hebrews 11 said by faith abel offered
[33:48] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[33:50] cain
[33:51] testifying of him that he was righteous
[33:54] now cain said i guess my mother eats
[33:56] some apples and she had to put on
[33:58] clothes
[34:01] and abel knew that it was blood
[34:05] life
[34:06] there had been something happened wrong
[34:09] and he offered the blood of a lamb
[34:13] he didn't just
[34:15] abel wasn't cruel he wasn't vicious he
[34:17] wasn't he didn't desire the destruction
[34:20] of other life
[34:22] but he realized where the destruction of
[34:24] his life came
[34:26] and he saw what god did to make an
[34:28] atonement for his children and by
[34:30] revelation he knew that it would take a
[34:33] substitute life to cover for his wrong
[34:36] life
[34:37] and that substitute life was a lamb and
[34:40] he shed the blood of the lamb and god
[34:43] had respect unto his sacrifice but not
[34:45] unto cain's
[34:48] in the message wisdom versus faith
[34:51] prophet says see by wisdom cain offered
[34:54] you know not knowing the word but just
[34:57] thought by wisdom he made a nice place
[35:00] and made it pretty and beautiful but
[35:02] abel no one told him
[35:04] now just a boy by faith saw that it
[35:06] wasn't botany life it was a sexual
[35:09] affair
[35:11] through blood
[35:12] there you are brother weighed over the
[35:14] top of that one time
[35:16] by faith his children still sees it
[35:20] do you see it
[35:22] that takes this whole subject of blood
[35:24] that's through the bible
[35:26] and it begins to take it way deeper
[35:29] this message takes what everybody else
[35:32] talks about and gives lip service to
[35:34] this message takes and gets to the heart
[35:36] of it why what god is accomplishing what
[35:39] happened what went wrong and how is he
[35:41] making it right
[35:43] it goes beyond the terminology it goes
[35:46] to the thought of god
[35:49] it was a sexual affair through blood
[35:52] there you are brother wade over the top
[35:54] of that one time by faith his children
[35:56] still sees it he never taught it by some
[35:58] wisdom now it don't come by wisdom it
[36:01] comes by faith the bible said abel by
[36:03] faith what did he offer blood from a
[36:06] living life animal life
[36:09] we're animal or ourselves where warm
[36:10] warm-blooded animal that's exactly right
[36:12] higher species the highest animal but
[36:15] with the soul in there that's what's
[36:17] life
[36:18] now notice by faith abel saw the
[36:20] revelation the vision and brought a
[36:22] living running blood because life was in
[36:24] the blood
[36:27] life is the the stem life in the stem of
[36:29] the flower it's botany life which has no
[36:32] feeling i was i was hoping that would
[36:34] soak in
[36:35] able by faith staying with the word by
[36:38] faith not by wisdom by faith he seen
[36:42] that it was sex blood the blood cell
[36:44] comes from the male the male has the
[36:46] blood cell and the sperm and the
[36:48] hemoglobin is the blood comes through
[36:50] the male and adam know that it wasn't
[36:52] apples and peaches and potatoes or
[36:54] whatever it was that brought them out of
[36:56] the garden of eden that caused the sin
[36:58] it was sex blood and he offered blood
[37:01] back
[37:03] so now the revelation that abel had
[37:06] become super clear by able sacrifice
[37:09] and the lack of a revelation that cain
[37:11] had becomes evident by cain's sacrifice
[37:15] and i want to follow this through this
[37:17] bible study this morning because we're
[37:19] going to find that we're standing in the
[37:20] same place today
[37:23] nothing is any different whatsoever
[37:25] we're standing just like they were
[37:26] standing in that day amen in our worship
[37:29] will indicate what our revelation is
[37:35] that's what was happening in that day
[37:37] he realized abel realized what went
[37:40] wrong in the garden and it had something
[37:42] to do with life with this mortal life
[37:45] amen it was it was done by sex and it
[37:48] affected the life and now he found
[37:51] himself in a fallen wrong condition but
[37:54] he was going to offer life blood back to
[37:57] cover for his life
[38:00] and we know that that was only a
[38:01] substitute only a covering it could
[38:03] never remove amen but it was god's plan
[38:06] it was foreshadowing that there was
[38:08] another lamb coming amen there was a
[38:10] perfect lamb coming that could bring a
[38:12] perfect atonement
[38:15] again in wisdom versus faith he says not
[38:17] me i ain't the word he's the word
[38:20] if i was the word then there's only one
[38:22] person would be the word and he was
[38:23] jesus he was god's spoken word by a
[38:26] virgin birth
[38:28] i
[38:29] i'm a perversion see i'm the result of a
[38:32] union between my father and mother
[38:36] this has to die that's me see the body
[38:38] that has to die
[38:42] wasn't so with jesus he was the word he
[38:44] was born virgin brother there's no woman
[38:47] man or nothing else had nothing to do
[38:49] with him the woman was the incubator
[38:51] that's right and he nursed her breast
[38:53] and so forth that might have been true
[38:55] about that but let me tell you he was
[38:57] god that's who he was wasn't no sex
[39:00] about it at all he had to be free from
[39:03] sex to bring forth life through the
[39:05] blood
[39:07] as we'll get to in a few minutes then
[39:09] look he was the word but but the word of
[39:12] the lord now let's turn to psalms 51. i
[39:15] want to look at something here in psalms
[39:17] that i found to be very interesting
[39:22] psalms 51
[39:27] in verse 5.
[39:31] it's a psalm of david
[39:34] in psalm 51
[39:36] and then this one verse verse 5.
[39:39] behold i was shaping an iniquity and in
[39:42] sin and my mother conceived me
[39:45] now this is david and we have no
[39:48] knowledge in the bible that david was
[39:51] illegitimately born
[39:54] no there's no adultery involved
[39:57] no fornication
[39:59] but david would say
[40:01] that i was shaping an iniquity and sin
[40:04] did my mother conceive me
[40:07] there's david said there's something
[40:09] wrong with my birth
[40:12] the way that i came is based on sin amen
[40:16] now we know that god
[40:18] he allowed it he said now if that's the
[40:19] way you're going to do it go on and do
[40:21] it he
[40:22] he permitted us to bring forth children
[40:25] amen through the way we bring forth
[40:27] children in this day he permitted it but
[40:29] brother ben said it's not his perfect
[40:30] will it's his permissive will
[40:32] so now we're operating in his permissive
[40:34] will and in his permissive will because
[40:36] god has made allowance for it why did
[40:38] god make allowance for it because it
[40:40] keeps his program moving it's part of
[40:42] his master plan
[40:45] and because he makes allowance for it
[40:47] you can be considered righteous
[40:50] right because god made it's his
[40:52] permissive will
[40:53] he permitted it and ordained it and he
[40:55] considers if you stay within the
[40:57] confines of marriage you can still be
[40:59] considered clean and holy and righteous
[41:03] but still what we have today is not
[41:05] god's original plan
[41:07] it's still wrong and it's still based on
[41:09] iniquity and sin and david could say
[41:12] although
[41:13] he was born from his mother and his
[41:15] father and a marriage relationship with
[41:17] no adultery and no fornication because i
[41:19] was shaping in iniquity and then sin and
[41:21] then sin did my mother conceive me
[41:24] that's why those things won't be in the
[41:25] next life
[41:27] when everything's made right
[41:30] and so we can see now
[41:33] that that brother branham's saying i'm a
[41:35] perversion
[41:37] because i'm a mixture of my mother and
[41:40] father perverted where back when man
[41:43] fell from god's word
[41:45] and since then god permitted it part of
[41:47] his permissive will you could remain
[41:49] righteous and holy in that channel
[41:51] because god made it his permissive will
[41:53] but it's not his perfect will
[41:57] and so
[41:58] now because of that we are everyone born
[42:01] wrong
[42:03] that's why jesus christ had to be virgin
[42:06] born
[42:09] and and what does it have to do with
[42:11] blood
[42:12] why does it have to be virgin born blood
[42:14] why because the life is the life is in
[42:16] the blood what happened in the beginning
[42:18] the blood what what was the problem
[42:21] blood what was offered as a substitute
[42:23] blood amen what is going to be the
[42:25] atonement blood
[42:29] why it all goes back to the fall in the
[42:31] beginning it all goes back to eden if we
[42:34] don't know what happened in eden then we
[42:36] don't even understand the bible that
[42:37] we're holding in our hands claiming to
[42:39] serve god and believe god but we don't
[42:41] even know why did jesus christ shed his
[42:44] blood for us
[42:46] if we don't know serpent seed we don't
[42:48] know about the fall we don't know why he
[42:51] was virgin born we don't know why he had
[42:53] to have a pure blood we don't know we
[42:56] don't know the gospel without knowing
[42:58] the beginning
[43:01] so we have billions of people preaching
[43:03] the gospel what they're preaching amen
[43:06] is a similitude of the gospel
[43:09] all right let's say they're preaching
[43:12] terminologies from the gospel and those
[43:15] terminologies are being preached but the
[43:17] gospel is based off the realization amen
[43:20] that there was something that went wrong
[43:22] in the beginning amen and it was blood
[43:24] it was sex it was a perversion it was
[43:27] contrary to the will and word of god
[43:29] amen and now we're stuck into this trap
[43:31] because we've come forth by a union of a
[43:33] man and a woman in god's permissive will
[43:36] but we've come forth wrong and there's
[43:37] got to be something that'll make us
[43:39] right
[43:44] that's the heart of the gospel
[43:46] how can you have the gospel without
[43:49] serpentine
[43:50] without the doctrine of serpency
[43:55] see that's why when these truths were
[43:57] revealed to us it wasn't you know
[44:00] another talking point or something that
[44:01] would make us better than the baptist
[44:05] it was so that we would have the gospel
[44:08] it wasn't so that i know a little bit
[44:11] more than this one and we've got you
[44:12] know a little better doctor a little
[44:14] clearer understanding no it is so we
[44:16] would have understanding period
[44:18] not just a better understanding but that
[44:20] we would know that this bible that i
[44:22] hold in my hands it makes sense to me
[44:24] there's a purpose in it all there's a
[44:26] plan throughout it's all working
[44:28] together in continuity
[44:30] and god never changed his mind
[44:33] it's been his plan all the way through
[44:36] in spoken word is the original seed he
[44:39] says then except a man be born again why
[44:41] must he be born again
[44:43] he's dead the flesh he's in
[44:46] he's a hybrid he's got to be born again
[44:49] why he was born in sin from eve sin
[44:53] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[44:54] speaking lies
[44:57] again in spoken word he says man wasn't
[45:00] made to die
[45:02] he was made to live but high breeding
[45:05] brought
[45:06] death it brought life a death there
[45:08] rather she hybrid it now you deny the
[45:11] serpent seed then i'll ask you why
[45:13] what's these funeral services about
[45:16] she was hybrid every one of us are
[45:18] hybrid from the original that's the
[45:20] reason you're constantly dying
[45:23] praise be to god
[45:25] let's go to exodus chapter 12.
[45:28] i want to keep looking at this through
[45:30] the bible
[45:31] and just kind of move through the bible
[45:33] if we can
[45:35] exodus chapter 12.
[45:42] friends i don't know but something about
[45:44] this message keeps making my heart soar
[45:47] higher and higher
[45:49] it unlocked the bible
[45:56] in exodus chapter 12
[45:58] 13. we're coming to the passover
[46:02] we've had plagues that are striking
[46:04] egypt under the ministry of moses and
[46:06] moses is going to be the deliverer that
[46:08] god will use to bring them out with a
[46:10] mighty ham
[46:11] and the last thing that will strike amen
[46:13] will strike uh in the in the uh and the
[46:16] passover
[46:18] the death angel will come to smite all
[46:20] the firstborn but god has made a way of
[46:22] salvation
[46:24] for his people
[46:25] and we pick it up in verse 13 we'll just
[46:27] read one verse
[46:29] and the blood shall be to you for a
[46:31] token upon the houses where you are and
[46:33] when i see the blood i will pass over
[46:36] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[46:38] to destroy you when i smite the land of
[46:40] egypt
[46:42] there was a
[46:44] a plague coming there was a death angel
[46:46] passing there was death that was going
[46:48] to strike
[46:50] the land of egypt but god was going to
[46:52] make an atonement for his children
[46:56] and the only atonement that he could
[46:57] make was blood because it's been god's
[46:59] plan from the beginning
[47:02] it was his plan in eden it was the plan
[47:04] outside of eaton when abel offered his
[47:06] lamb it was the plan
[47:08] of redemption here in egypt god was
[47:11] redeeming his children and the last
[47:13] thing he does is tell them to take a
[47:14] lamb a lamb for a household
[47:17] and take that lamb and slay it and take
[47:18] the blood of the lamb and put it upon
[47:21] the
[47:22] the doorpost and the lentils of the door
[47:24] amen so that there was a he said the
[47:26] blood shall be for a token and that
[47:28] token means it's a representation that
[47:31] the life of an innocent one was spilt
[47:33] for the this household
[47:35] and so the token was the blood and it
[47:38] stood as a representation that there was
[47:41] a substitute there was a life given
[47:43] because the life the blood is the life
[47:45] amen the blood the life is in the blood
[47:47] and when he saw the blood he knew that
[47:49] there was a life given in exchange for
[47:52] the lives in that home
[47:55] because this has been god's plan from
[47:57] the beginning why because the problem is
[48:00] blood
[48:00] [Music]
[48:05] so he said when i see the blood the
[48:08] blood shall be a token
[48:10] upon the house
[48:12] in the token message from 1964
[48:15] brother says now israel's slain lamb was
[48:18] the requirement of jehovah
[48:20] and the blood was the token that the job
[48:22] had been done
[48:24] god required for redemption from egypt
[48:26] to go to the promised land he required a
[48:28] slain a slain animal and that animal
[48:31] must the blood of the dead animal must
[48:33] be put upon the lentil and the door and
[48:35] that stood for the token that the thing
[48:37] that jehovah had required had been
[48:39] fulfilled
[48:41] now not the lamb was the token
[48:43] the blood was the token
[48:45] now the life had gone out from the
[48:47] sacrifice and now the blood was the
[48:49] token his orders had been carried out
[48:52] the blood stood for the token the sign
[48:54] that this believer had done exactly what
[48:56] the requirement was that was the token
[48:59] all right seeing the believer worship
[49:01] was then identified with his sacrifice
[49:05] so the way that he worshipped was what
[49:07] how did he worship he worshipped the way
[49:10] that the prophet told him god wanted him
[49:12] to worship
[49:13] he took the lamb slain the blood applied
[49:16] it amen and when you could see
[49:19] uh when you could see worship i just
[49:21] want to say it this way you can see
[49:23] worship
[49:26] it shows on the outside
[49:28] amen
[49:29] they could see
[49:31] they could see the worship of that
[49:33] family on the doorpost in the lentils
[49:38] your worship is showing
[49:43] he said
[49:45] he said
[49:46] that was a token all right seeing the
[49:48] believer worship was then identified
[49:50] with his sacrifice so his worship was
[49:54] showing what he was feeding on in the
[49:56] house
[49:57] because the life was slain of the lamb
[49:59] and the blood was put as a token on the
[50:01] outside but they were inside the house
[50:04] eating the very lamb whose life was a
[50:06] token life blood was a token on the
[50:08] outside so the worship on the outside
[50:10] showed what they were feeding on on the
[50:12] inside
[50:13] they were feeding on this lamb and the
[50:16] lamb's life token was on the door and
[50:19] everything was in continuity the inside
[50:21] and the outside the worship was pure
[50:27] amen
[50:29] and then they were told to eat all the
[50:31] lamb
[50:32] even the pertinence thereof they're
[50:34] supposed to eat the tasty morsels and
[50:36] the not so tasty morsels
[50:38] because christ is our lamb amen and
[50:40] there's been a token provided for us to
[50:42] put on the outside of the house amen but
[50:44] but we're supposed to be in our house
[50:46] feeding on the lamb
[50:48] which is the word of god amen the the
[50:51] word was made flesh and so now we're
[50:53] supposed to be feeding on the word and
[50:55] that word amen we're supposed to feed on
[50:57] all of the word in our house the the
[50:59] with the pertinence thereof the tasty
[51:02] morsels the tender juicy pieces and the
[51:04] tough difficult pieces to digest we're
[51:07] supposed to eat it all
[51:11] and we in the house eating
[51:14] with the with the token of the life of
[51:17] the sacrifice showing on the outside
[51:21] nothing's changed god's bible runs in
[51:23] perfect continuity
[51:25] he goes on in the token and say here is
[51:27] the house and the worshiper what was the
[51:29] requirement slay a lamb on the 14th day
[51:32] after it was put up a male without
[51:34] blemish all israel shall slay it and the
[51:36] blood shall be a token with hyssop and
[51:38] put it upon the lentil of the door
[51:41] and by the way i want you to pay close
[51:44] attention to what he's going to say next
[51:46] by the way that his hop was just common
[51:48] weeds
[51:52] now we're going to talk about the
[51:53] application of the blood
[51:55] the hyssop was just common weeds
[51:58] hyssop means your faith somebody tries
[52:00] to have supernatural faith that's the
[52:03] reason you miss your healing faith is
[52:04] just common thing you got faith to come
[52:07] to church you got faith to walk out
[52:08] there you got faith to start your car
[52:10] you got faith to eat your dinner that's
[52:12] the way it is just common faith now
[52:14] apply the blood was applied with hyssop
[52:17] which is just common weeds that grows
[52:19] anywhere in palestine showing that the
[52:21] faith that the blood is to be applied by
[52:24] is not some super thing you have to have
[52:26] all kinds of doctor's degrees to do it
[52:28] it's just common everyday faith to
[52:30] believe god apply the blood by faith
[52:33] with the hyssop
[52:35] but let's make it so simple what is it
[52:37] it's just common faith it's not
[52:40] he says you try to make it some
[52:42] supernatural some super duper some
[52:44] really difficult thing that you have to
[52:46] have a certain sign you have to have a
[52:47] certain kind of gift you have to have a
[52:49] certain certain certain understanding
[52:51] and he says no just believe god amen
[52:54] it's that simple you just believe what
[52:56] he wrote
[52:57] believe what he said and just believe it
[52:59] and apply it to yourself and say that
[53:01] applies to me it's that simple
[53:05] we make it too complicated
[53:08] now the worshiper then
[53:10] seen beneath his this blood showed that
[53:12] he had carried out jehovah's request
[53:16] listen
[53:18] he didn't have to do
[53:20] extra
[53:23] he didn't get extra points for doing
[53:25] extra things
[53:27] he was just supposed to do what he was
[53:29] told to do
[53:31] take a lamb
[53:33] take one without blemish
[53:35] take it on a certain day in the evening
[53:38] time slay that lamb collect the blood
[53:40] put it on the lenth on the doors with
[53:42] common everyday common faith
[53:46] and then
[53:48] feast on the contents of the lamb in the
[53:50] home and be prepared for your exodus
[53:53] that was what they were supposed to do
[53:54] not to think of something better
[53:57] not to come up with another program but
[53:59] but if he said do this then he meant
[54:01] then obviously this would be even better
[54:06] if he wanted us to do this and he and he
[54:08] told us amen he told us to keep our
[54:10] staff in our hand well then i'm going to
[54:12] keep a book bag on my back too
[54:16] i mean if he meant that then that must
[54:18] mean this i mean we do this all the time
[54:21] this is so common for us well if he said
[54:23] this then it must also mean this and if
[54:25] he meant this then it could mean this
[54:26] too and if he meant that then wouldn't
[54:28] this be the maximum way to express that
[54:32] and we're always trying to produce
[54:34] something that makes us feel more
[54:35] comfortable
[54:37] instead of just doing the common thing
[54:39] just believe what he said
[54:41] just take it for face value and say it's
[54:43] the truth i believe it's the truth and i
[54:45] believe it will work for me
[54:50] so
[54:51] i'll read that again the worshiper then
[54:52] seen beneath his blood showed that he
[54:54] had carried out jehovah's request and he
[54:57] was identified the token showed he was
[55:00] identified with the slain lamb that
[55:01] jehovah had required the work was done
[55:05] what a perfect type today of christ in
[55:07] the believer
[55:08] when the token is displayed to the
[55:10] believer then it shows that it's been
[55:12] accepted and the work has been done
[55:15] then the blood was a token of
[55:16] identification the blood itself
[55:19] the animal blood died his blood was on
[55:21] the wall now animal life that was in the
[55:23] blood and the life is in the blood we
[55:25] know that the bible said so in science
[55:28] proves it life is in the blood so
[55:29] therefore when the animal was killed and
[55:31] the life was broken from the animal the
[55:33] blood had to be the chemistry of the
[55:36] blood to stand for the token because the
[55:38] life that was in the blood could not
[55:40] come upon the believer because it was an
[55:42] animal's life
[55:44] brother makes this so easy
[55:47] god was giving them a substitute
[55:50] and that substitute was foreshadowing a
[55:52] greater that would come
[55:54] but in god's economy he was allowing
[55:56] them to take the lamb and slay the lamb
[55:58] and apply the blood
[55:59] for an atonement for them so that they
[56:01] would be passed over in in the judgment
[56:03] of egypt so that they could remain alive
[56:06] and they could come out from under the
[56:08] token and go on to the promise
[56:10] now
[56:12] uh any and he said that the chemistry
[56:15] then the actual physical context of
[56:18] blind was painted on the lentil on the
[56:20] doorpost and because they that's all
[56:22] that they had left over when the life
[56:24] was gone when the life was spilt when
[56:26] the life left they had the chemistry and
[56:28] they took the chemistry and applied it
[56:30] proving that they had done all that
[56:33] jehovah had required
[56:35] it was evidence that they had done what
[56:36] jehovah had required
[56:39] so so but there that's as far as they
[56:42] could go because that life that left
[56:45] that animal the life that was in the
[56:47] blood could not come back upon them
[56:49] because it was a different kind of life
[56:51] it wasn't human life it was animal life
[56:54] so that's as far as they could go in
[56:55] that day
[56:57] but let's look at first peter
[57:04] first peter chapter 1.
[57:14] first peter chapter 1 verse 18
[57:20] first
[57:21] for as you know that you were not
[57:22] redeemed with corruptable things as
[57:24] silver and gold from your vain
[57:26] conversations received by tradition from
[57:28] your fathers
[57:29] but with the precious blood of christ as
[57:31] of a lamb
[57:33] without blemish and without spot
[57:38] who verily was foreign before the
[57:40] foundation of the world
[57:41] but was manifest in these last times for
[57:44] you
[57:45] now when we look at the the the story of
[57:48] redemption through the bible in eden and
[57:50] post eden and exodus and then through
[57:52] the law the shedding of blood the
[57:54] shedding of an innocent victim the
[57:56] substitute life the the all of these
[57:58] things now when we come to the new
[58:00] testament and we begin to read the
[58:02] things that peter's saying
[58:04] they they make such
[58:06] they make so much sense there's such
[58:08] another understanding that's coming
[58:10] because it was the precious blood of
[58:12] christ
[58:13] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[58:15] spot he became the sacrifice he was the
[58:18] one that the father offered for his
[58:20] whole household and we are part of that
[58:22] household
[58:24] let's go to hebrews while we're here
[58:28] hebrews chapter 9.
[58:37] hebrews chapter 9
[58:43] and verse 8 hebrews 9 and 8.
[58:50] the holy ghost
[58:52] this this signifying that the way into
[58:55] the holiest of all was not yet made
[58:56] manifest while as the first tabernacle
[58:59] was yet standing
[59:01] which was a figure for the time then
[59:03] present in which we are off which were
[59:05] offered both gifts and sacrifices that
[59:07] could not make him that did the service
[59:09] perfect as pertaining to the conscience
[59:12] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[59:14] diverse washings and carnal ordinances
[59:16] imposed on them until the time
[59:18] of reformation
[59:20] but christ being come a high priest of
[59:22] good things to come by a greater and
[59:24] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[59:26] hands that is to say not of this
[59:28] building
[59:29] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[59:30] but by his own blood he entered it once
[59:34] into the holy place having obtained
[59:36] eternal redemption for us
[59:39] for the blood of bulls and of goats and
[59:41] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[59:43] unclean sanctified to the purifying of
[59:45] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[59:48] of christ who through the eternal spirit
[59:50] offered himself without spot to god
[59:52] purge your conscience from dead works to
[59:55] serve the living god
[59:57] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[59:59] the new testament that by means of death
[1:00:02] for the redemption of the transgression
[1:00:05] that were under the first testament they
[1:00:07] which are called might receive the
[1:00:09] promise of eternal inheritance for where
[1:00:11] a testament is there must also of
[1:00:13] necessity be the death of the testator
[1:00:16] for a testament is a force after men are
[1:00:19] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:00:21] all while the testator liveth whereupon
[1:00:24] neither the first testament was
[1:00:25] dedicated without blood
[1:00:27] for when moses had spoken every precept
[1:00:29] to all the people according to the law
[1:00:31] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[1:00:33] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[1:00:36] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:00:38] people saying this is the blood of the
[1:00:41] testament which god hath enjoined unto
[1:00:43] you
[1:00:44] see what what happened is when moses
[1:00:47] instructed the children of israel that
[1:00:49] when they heard the long blast and the
[1:00:51] voice of god that they were to go up to
[1:00:52] the mountain but instead they run afar
[1:00:54] off and they instructed moses you go we
[1:00:57] can't go you go so he did and when he
[1:00:59] went god now gives him ordinances and
[1:01:02] laws
[1:01:03] originally god was only going to give to
[1:01:05] israel the ten commandments
[1:01:07] what he said he gave to them and added
[1:01:09] none there too
[1:01:11] but when they refused to come unto him
[1:01:13] amen then stood afar off for fear now
[1:01:16] when moses went unto them now he says
[1:01:19] whatever he tells you will do so now god
[1:01:22] gives his ordinances because the people
[1:01:24] can no longer hear directly from him so
[1:01:26] now he's going to give them a book of
[1:01:28] ordinances
[1:01:30] and he writes down all the laws and all
[1:01:32] the rules all the first testament amen
[1:01:35] and moses comes down off the mountain
[1:01:37] after recording it in the book and he's
[1:01:38] got the book amen and the people agreed
[1:01:40] to abide by the book and he takes the
[1:01:43] blood of a bull of calves and of goats
[1:01:46] and of water or blood let me read that
[1:01:48] again i don't want to get that wrong
[1:01:54] he took the blood in verse 19 of calves
[1:01:56] and of goats with water and scarlet wool
[1:01:58] and hyssop and sprinkled both the book
[1:02:01] and them
[1:02:02] so the first covenant the first
[1:02:05] testament was sealed with blood
[1:02:07] sprinkled with blood and sealed and
[1:02:09] vindicated and purified by blood the
[1:02:12] book and the people amen were both
[1:02:14] sprinkled
[1:02:16] so let's keep going
[1:02:19] verse 21 moreover he sprinkled with
[1:02:21] blood both the tabernacle and all the
[1:02:24] vessels of ministry
[1:02:26] and almost all things are by the law
[1:02:28] purged with blood and without shedding
[1:02:30] of blood is no remission
[1:02:32] it was therefore necessary that the
[1:02:34] patterns of things in heaven should be
[1:02:35] purified with these but the heavenly
[1:02:38] things themselves
[1:02:39] with better sacrifices than these
[1:02:42] for christ is not entered into the holy
[1:02:44] place made with hands which are the
[1:02:46] figures of the truth but into heaven
[1:02:48] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:02:50] god for us
[1:02:51] nor yet that he should offer himself
[1:02:53] often as the high priest entered into
[1:02:55] the holy place every year with blood of
[1:02:57] others for then must he often have
[1:02:59] suffered since the foundation of the
[1:03:00] world but now once in the end of the
[1:03:03] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[1:03:06] by the sacrifice of himself
[1:03:09] so this this we're reading here about
[1:03:11] this term of sprinkling with blood
[1:03:15] this
[1:03:16] when moses sprinkled the people in the
[1:03:18] book he took the blood of the substitute
[1:03:21] offering with water and he dipped in
[1:03:24] scarlet wool and hyssop and he sprinkled
[1:03:26] the book and the people and the covenant
[1:03:27] was sealed amen and it was also purified
[1:03:30] because the sprinkling is a form of
[1:03:32] purification a form of purging a
[1:03:34] sanctifying and he did the same thing to
[1:03:37] the tabernacle in all the vessels he
[1:03:38] sprinkled them with water mixed with
[1:03:41] blood in the ashes of a heifer and with
[1:03:43] that he he purified sanctified he
[1:03:46] sprinkled he purged everything to go
[1:03:48] into service of the lord he purged every
[1:03:50] vessel he praised the high priest
[1:03:52] everything was sprinkled
[1:03:55] but the new testament now is going to
[1:03:56] come and talk about us being sprinkled
[1:04:00] but we've been sprinkled by better than
[1:04:02] this we've been sprinkled by another
[1:04:03] kind of blood
[1:04:05] and what does the sprinkling do the
[1:04:06] sprinkling is to purify us cleanse us
[1:04:09] for
[1:04:10] service look at first peter
[1:04:14] first peter chapter one
[1:04:23] first peter chapter one and verse 2
[1:04:28] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:04:30] god the father through sanctification of
[1:04:32] the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling
[1:04:34] of the blood of jesus christ grace unto
[1:04:37] you and peace be multiplied
[1:04:41] god
[1:04:42] had made sure every vessel was
[1:04:44] sanctified cleansed purged by the
[1:04:46] sprinkling of blood
[1:04:48] but now you're a vessel that he wants to
[1:04:50] use
[1:04:51] you're a vessel that you're a tabernacle
[1:04:54] that he wants to dwell in you're a
[1:04:55] vessel that he wants to use so he
[1:04:57] sprinkled you by a better blood than
[1:04:59] these he sprinkled you by the blood of
[1:05:01] jesus christ so that you can be purified
[1:05:03] and cleansed so you can be a tabernacle
[1:05:05] that he can dwell in and that he can use
[1:05:07] you for his service
[1:05:09] so we've we've had a sprinkling by blood
[1:05:12] let's go to revelation chapter 1.
[1:05:16] revelation chapter 1.
[1:05:24] and verse 5 revelation 1 and 5
[1:05:29] and from jesus christ who is the
[1:05:31] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:05:32] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:05:35] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:05:37] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:05:42] so this theme of blood runs from genesis
[1:05:45] to revelation
[1:05:47] the prophet of god says in in the
[1:05:49] message abraham from 1961 see when the
[1:05:51] old testament when they offered sin
[1:05:53] offering they took a little lamb
[1:05:55] laid their hands upon it confessed their
[1:05:57] sins and they cut its throat and then
[1:05:59] the little fellow was dying kicking and
[1:06:01] bleeding why the blood got all over the
[1:06:03] hands of the worshiper and then he felt
[1:06:05] the death going out of that animal as it
[1:06:07] straightened out and died and he knowed
[1:06:10] that that animal was dying in his place
[1:06:12] but the bible said that he went out
[1:06:15] with the same desire he had when he came
[1:06:17] in
[1:06:19] he there was a substitute the substitute
[1:06:22] was bearing his iniquity was bearing his
[1:06:24] sin he would lay his hands on the head
[1:06:26] of the animal as a as an indication that
[1:06:29] he's transferring his sin onto this
[1:06:32] animal and this animal is now bearing
[1:06:34] his sin and they would slay the animal
[1:06:36] and as he felt its struggle under the
[1:06:38] slaying and its blood leaving it die he
[1:06:41] realized that this animal died in my
[1:06:43] place
[1:06:44] and so now he left justified because god
[1:06:48] had forgiven him because he did what
[1:06:49] jehovah had required but when he left
[1:06:52] the same thing in him that made him sin
[1:06:54] the first time is still there
[1:06:56] the same desires the same trappings the
[1:06:59] same things are there with him as it was
[1:07:02] before
[1:07:04] so that blood couldn't take that away
[1:07:06] all it could do was cover it
[1:07:09] he goes on to say
[1:07:12] he said
[1:07:13] uh
[1:07:14] he came out with he went out with the
[1:07:15] same desire he had when he come in
[1:07:17] because see
[1:07:18] when the blood cell was broke that
[1:07:19] animal spirit could not come back and
[1:07:21] coincide with the human spirit
[1:07:24] the animal has no soul
[1:07:26] so they could not come back so therefore
[1:07:28] he went out with the same conscience but
[1:07:30] when a man by faith comes lays his hands
[1:07:32] upon the head of jesus christ and feels
[1:07:34] his suffering for your sins and when the
[1:07:36] blood cell was broke on calvary not only
[1:07:39] the life of a human being came back but
[1:07:41] the life of god comes back from it and
[1:07:43] makes you a son or daughter of god
[1:07:46] everything else was pointing to this
[1:07:48] this amen is what god was trying to
[1:07:51] accomplish
[1:07:52] in the token he says the only way
[1:07:55] only way anyone could tell that that
[1:07:57] house belonged to under the blood
[1:07:59] because the chemistry of the blood was
[1:08:01] on the doors he's back in the passover
[1:08:02] in the exodus
[1:08:05] the blood was on the doors they passed
[1:08:07] through the death angel had to look and
[1:08:08] see the blood now again it was a type of
[1:08:11] the holy spirit
[1:08:13] now see the literal blood of jesus could
[1:08:16] not come upon each one of us
[1:08:19] remember the bible says that we're
[1:08:20] sprinkled by the blood of jesus christ
[1:08:23] the bible says we're washed by the blood
[1:08:25] of jesus christ
[1:08:27] we're redeemed by the blood is that what
[1:08:28] the bible says
[1:08:31] but but we have to ask ourselves a
[1:08:33] question
[1:08:34] how do they get that blood on me
[1:08:38] if i have to be washed in the blood
[1:08:40] listen to what brother branham says i
[1:08:42] love the way i love brother branham
[1:08:45] being honest and being real amen because
[1:08:47] the rest of christianity is speaking in
[1:08:49] catchphrases and cliches and then when
[1:08:51] somebody asks them a question about it
[1:08:53] they just make it mystical
[1:08:56] they don't ever answer the question but
[1:08:58] brother branham says now the literal
[1:09:00] blood of jesus christ could not come
[1:09:01] upon each of us because he just had so
[1:09:04] much blood in his body
[1:09:07] and it's dripped off out of his body and
[1:09:09] into the ground 2 000 years ago but it
[1:09:12] wasn't to be for a token
[1:09:14] it was to be the purchase price of our
[1:09:16] redemption but not for our token
[1:09:19] remember the token in the passover was
[1:09:22] the blood the chemistry of the blood was
[1:09:24] a token that token was evidence that a
[1:09:26] lamb had died for this house
[1:09:29] you didn't hang the lamb there
[1:09:31] you put the blood there and because the
[1:09:34] blood the life was in the blood when you
[1:09:36] put the blood there it represented that
[1:09:38] a life had been slain
[1:09:40] that's what the token is
[1:09:42] but in this slaying of the lamb the
[1:09:45] chemistry of the blood was not to be our
[1:09:47] token
[1:09:49] it was to be the price of our redemption
[1:09:52] but there's something else that's
[1:09:53] supposed to be our token
[1:09:58] so
[1:09:58] i love brother branham is not speaking
[1:10:01] in fairy tales and he doesn't make
[1:10:02] everything so mystical that there that
[1:10:04] there's really no answer and you just go
[1:10:05] in these loops
[1:10:07] but he's speaking reality
[1:10:10] we're washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:10:11] we're redeemed by the blood we're
[1:10:13] sprinkled under the blood of christ all
[1:10:15] of those things are absolutely true but
[1:10:18] what blood amen what the chemistry i
[1:10:21] can't get my hands on that chemistry and
[1:10:23] if i have to be washed in that blood
[1:10:25] that was spilled at calvary the physical
[1:10:28] chemistry of the physical elements of
[1:10:30] the blood that blood went into the earth
[1:10:32] dried up the elements broke up how am i
[1:10:35] going to get that blood on me because i
[1:10:38] have to be washed in that blood
[1:10:41] we're left in a
[1:10:42] conundrum and then when you start
[1:10:44] talking in denominational realms you
[1:10:46] just shrug your shoulders
[1:10:48] i don't know
[1:10:50] oh i'm so thankful for a prophet of god
[1:10:53] so don't have to walk around say you got
[1:10:54] to be washing the blood well how do you
[1:10:56] get the blood i don't know but it'll be
[1:10:57] okay
[1:11:02] you know i know there's still sincere
[1:11:03] people in the world but it seems like
[1:11:05] religion has lost the sincerity of just
[1:11:07] going through the motions it's just
[1:11:08] action catch phrases and words and
[1:11:10] programs and going to church on sunday
[1:11:12] and wednesday but if somebody really
[1:11:14] wants to be clean they want to be right
[1:11:15] with god they want to be purified they
[1:11:17] want to know that i am in union with god
[1:11:20] i don't want to go through life without
[1:11:22] god i have a love for god a desire for
[1:11:24] god a need for god i want to be redeemed
[1:11:27] i want to be clean i want to be set free
[1:11:28] i don't want to go to church
[1:11:32] i don't just want to have religion but i
[1:11:34] want god amen and i got to be sprinkled
[1:11:37] by that blood purified by that blood
[1:11:39] washed in that blood now how am i going
[1:11:41] to get that blood
[1:11:43] and when the people shrug their
[1:11:44] shoulders the people just keep going to
[1:11:46] church and keep going home keep going to
[1:11:48] church and they come in singing about
[1:11:50] the blood and they go out
[1:11:53] with the same desire
[1:11:57] that they came in with
[1:12:00] is that right
[1:12:03] they come wanting to be washed in the
[1:12:04] blood wanting to be redeemed by the
[1:12:05] blood wanting to be cleansed by the
[1:12:07] blood but they come to church to worship
[1:12:10] sing the songs hear the sermon and
[1:12:12] they're just like the worshiper
[1:12:16] long ago they walk out
[1:12:18] with the same desire
[1:12:20] that they went in with
[1:12:24] that wasn't god's program
[1:12:30] i'm so thankful
[1:12:32] that god gave us the reality
[1:12:38] let's read this again
[1:12:40] the literal blood of jesus christ could
[1:12:41] not come upon each one of us
[1:12:43] because he just had so much blood in his
[1:12:45] body
[1:12:46] and it's dripped off out of his body
[1:12:48] into the ground 2 000 years ago but it
[1:12:50] wasn't to be for a token the life the
[1:12:53] life that was in the blood
[1:12:56] that was the token now
[1:12:59] and the passover it was the chemistry of
[1:13:01] the blood had to have an application so
[1:13:03] it could be seen
[1:13:04] and then you knew that you'd met
[1:13:06] jehovah's requirements but there's a
[1:13:08] token today and that token is not
[1:13:10] physical chemistry of physical blind but
[1:13:13] it's the life that was in the blood
[1:13:16] because we know that the blood is the
[1:13:17] life the life is in the blood we know by
[1:13:19] scripture so now that life that was in
[1:13:22] that blood that becomes my token
[1:13:25] that's what must be on display on the
[1:13:27] outside of my house
[1:13:29] he says the life the life that was in
[1:13:31] the blood was a token now i'll prove it
[1:13:33] to you just in a minute by the bible it
[1:13:35] is the token that's to come upon each of
[1:13:37] us to show that we have been identified
[1:13:40] with our sacrifice and have carried out
[1:13:42] jehovah's requests
[1:13:45] in the passover you could go outside and
[1:13:47] look at the door
[1:13:50] and say yep
[1:13:51] we're under the token
[1:13:54] but there's a token for today
[1:13:56] a true token a sure
[1:13:58] token what is that token
[1:14:04] it goes on in the same quote peter said
[1:14:05] on the day of pentecost repent every one
[1:14:07] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:14:09] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:14:11] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:14:12] holy ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:14:15] to your children and to them that's far
[1:14:17] off as many as the lord our god shall
[1:14:19] call see not showing it just to them as
[1:14:21] many as the lord will call
[1:14:24] there is many think that they're called
[1:14:26] but the the lord calls those who he for
[1:14:28] for knew he called all he called he
[1:14:31] justified all who he justified he is
[1:14:33] glorified already the thing is settled
[1:14:36] and then when you take a person that
[1:14:38] doesn't believe the holy ghost is for
[1:14:40] the day
[1:14:41] see what they're doing they are denying
[1:14:43] the token which is the very symbol of
[1:14:45] the being
[1:14:47] of being connected with your sacrifice
[1:14:51] when they don't even believe the holy
[1:14:52] ghost is for today
[1:14:54] and i'll go further than that they don't
[1:14:55] even believe the word for the day
[1:14:59] they don't even believe the word for
[1:15:00] today
[1:15:02] they're denying the token which is the
[1:15:04] very symbol of the of being connected
[1:15:06] with your sacrifice it's the life that
[1:15:08] was in the word the life that was in
[1:15:10] jesus christ the life that was in the
[1:15:12] blood
[1:15:13] so you don't even believe there's a holy
[1:15:14] ghost you're denying the token which is
[1:15:16] the very symbol of the being of being
[1:15:18] connected with your sacrifice
[1:15:20] see what i mean it's very simple if you
[1:15:22] just look at it in the way that god has
[1:15:23] got it rolled out now the blood carried
[1:15:25] us shows the symbol of the holy spirit
[1:15:28] that is the life
[1:15:31] and again in token this is another token
[1:15:33] message
[1:15:35] but now the life that was in the blood
[1:15:38] becomes the token
[1:15:40] so now what is my token what is my
[1:15:43] evidence that i have met jehovah's
[1:15:45] requirements
[1:15:47] because i will only be saved in this day
[1:15:49] of destruction if i met jehovah's
[1:15:51] requirements
[1:15:53] and what is the evidence that i've met
[1:15:56] jehovah's requirements the token what is
[1:15:58] the token the life that was in the blood
[1:16:03] because i'm saying now when we identify
[1:16:05] ourselves in his death burial and
[1:16:08] resurrection by believing on him and
[1:16:11] being baptized into his death burial and
[1:16:12] resurrection then we rise up the holy
[1:16:15] spirit is there to give us a token an
[1:16:18] eternal token written across your heart
[1:16:21] soul
[1:16:22] makeup mind body everything else that
[1:16:24] you are a separated person from unbelief
[1:16:27] you are a separated person from the
[1:16:28] things of the world you are separated
[1:16:30] from death you are separated from
[1:16:32] everything and you are a product that
[1:16:33] god has sealed into the kingdom by his
[1:16:35] holy spirit
[1:16:37] there's the token
[1:16:39] but there it's
[1:16:41] but here it's his own life
[1:16:43] that was in the blood
[1:16:45] his own life that was in the blood
[1:16:48] it's the it's the life that was in the
[1:16:50] blood when the blood was shed the life
[1:16:52] was released but before when the life
[1:16:54] was released the life could never come
[1:16:56] back because the animal didn't have a
[1:16:58] soul and he has a different spirit than
[1:17:00] man and he cannot come into the man so
[1:17:02] it was just an atonement it was just a
[1:17:04] covering it was a substitute showing
[1:17:06] that would one come but when the life of
[1:17:08] a man
[1:17:10] a man
[1:17:12] god took on the life of a man
[1:17:15] because that spirit can come back into
[1:17:17] you amen the life of a man not the life
[1:17:19] of an animal but the life of the man so
[1:17:21] god became a man amen why did god become
[1:17:24] a man because of the fall in eden god
[1:17:27] became a man
[1:17:30] because he's got to take care of the
[1:17:32] problem with the blood amen he's got to
[1:17:35] fix the problem from eden so to fix the
[1:17:37] problem from eden he had to become a man
[1:17:41] what kind of man a full-blown
[1:17:44] human man
[1:17:47] but was born without sin amen no sex to
[1:17:51] it at all he was virgin born why was he
[1:17:54] virgin born because of the fall in eden
[1:17:57] eden god what's god doing he's fixing
[1:18:00] the problem he's redeeming us he's
[1:18:02] bringing out us out of corruption he's
[1:18:04] bringing us back to himself what does he
[1:18:06] do he comes as a man because there's got
[1:18:08] to be a life in the man and he creates
[1:18:11] blood he creates blood and it's the
[1:18:13] blood of his own life
[1:18:18] and when that blood is spilled now that
[1:18:21] life that leaves that sacrifice is now
[1:18:24] the same kind of life you have human
[1:18:26] life and now that life can come into you
[1:18:29] because you have a soul
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:32] and that life coming into you amen
[1:18:35] changes your life quickens you until
[1:18:37] that life begins to live itself and that
[1:18:40] is the token to escape destruction in
[1:18:43] this day that's the token
[1:18:46] the life that was in that sacrifice
[1:18:53] i'm going to keep reading
[1:18:54] there's still more i want to get to i'm
[1:18:56] not
[1:18:57] not near done yet
[1:18:59] be patient we're close
[1:19:01] but kind of
[1:19:08] read that again but the life itself is
[1:19:09] the token
[1:19:11] for without the circumcision without the
[1:19:13] token you're not even in the covenant
[1:19:16] the whole thing works together if you
[1:19:18] say you're circumcised to the word and
[1:19:19] then only then you believe the word
[1:19:22] if you believe i want you to listen how
[1:19:24] simple brother branham never makes this
[1:19:26] complicated
[1:19:29] if you believe the word
[1:19:31] then the token has got to come
[1:19:34] for he said repent and be baptized every
[1:19:36] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[1:19:38] for the mission of sins and you shall
[1:19:40] receive the gift of the holy ghost there
[1:19:42] you are
[1:19:44] believe him
[1:19:46] now you can't go get baptized in jesus
[1:19:49] name and not believe it i mean you can't
[1:19:50] just go through the motions but first
[1:19:52] you have to believe
[1:19:54] you have to repent what are you
[1:19:55] repenting from i'm born wrong
[1:19:58] everything about me is wrong
[1:20:01] you can say i grew up in the message i
[1:20:02] never smoked never drank never i mean i
[1:20:04] didn't even use a curse word i just used
[1:20:05] some bad slang one time
[1:20:09] you can still repent because you were
[1:20:11] born wrong amen if you come from a
[1:20:13] mother and a father you were born wrong
[1:20:15] and must repent and recognize that i'm
[1:20:17] wrong i'm hopelessly wrong i will never
[1:20:19] be right whether i was born in the raids
[1:20:21] in the message or not whether i never
[1:20:23] say i swear word my whole life and go to
[1:20:25] church every sunday i am still wrong
[1:20:29] i need to repent i need something else i
[1:20:31] need another life the life in me is
[1:20:33] wrong it's corrupted it's perverted it's
[1:20:35] wrong it's wrong it's wrong it'll be
[1:20:37] wrong everybody needs a new birth no
[1:20:40] matter where you're born or what church
[1:20:41] you attend and what home you were
[1:20:43] growing up in
[1:20:46] because it's wrong amen but god created
[1:20:49] a sacrifice amen god himself became a
[1:20:53] living being a human being with human
[1:20:56] life amen so that he could that he could
[1:20:58] die amen and that blood could be shed
[1:21:01] and the life that was in that blood
[1:21:03] could come back into you after you
[1:21:05] repent believe god believe the full word
[1:21:08] of god amen repent and are baptized in
[1:21:10] the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:21:12] the remission of your sins and if you go
[1:21:14] through those steps you shall receive
[1:21:17] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:21:20] it's an absolute guaranteed promise of
[1:21:22] god and that holy ghost amen is the
[1:21:25] token is the evidence that you've met
[1:21:27] his requirements what are his
[1:21:28] requirements repent
[1:21:31] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:21:32] jesus christ
[1:21:36] that's it
[1:21:38] what are the rest what's the rest of the
[1:21:39] list brother
[1:21:40] chad that's it
[1:21:43] but i thought we had to the brother
[1:21:45] brother told us how a christian should
[1:21:47] dress and we shouldn't go to these
[1:21:48] certain places and how a man should
[1:21:50] treat his wife and listen
[1:21:52] get the holy ghost and it'll take care
[1:21:54] of the rest of that amen that's not you
[1:21:57] can't get the car before the horse meet
[1:21:59] his requirements and repentance
[1:22:01] recognize you're wrong you're completely
[1:22:04] wrong you're all wrong and there's no
[1:22:06] way for you to be right
[1:22:09] but god made a way himself amen and if
[1:22:12] we accept that by faith and believe that
[1:22:14] it was for us recognizing our failure
[1:22:17] and repent and give our life to him and
[1:22:19] believe the whole world and are baptized
[1:22:21] in the name of the lord jesus christ he
[1:22:23] has given a promise god will not go back
[1:22:26] on that promise
[1:22:28] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:22:29] ghost when you receive the gift of the
[1:22:31] holy ghost then everything brother ben
[1:22:33] says in the message makes sense
[1:22:38] then we stop asking silly questions
[1:22:42] like
[1:22:42] like on a boy how long is long hair like
[1:22:45] if it's over my ears if it's down my
[1:22:48] all that goes away
[1:22:50] because if you listen to what the
[1:22:51] prophet said with the life in you you
[1:22:54] say absolutely
[1:22:56] i want to look as clean and as holy as i
[1:22:59] possible i want to be everything that
[1:23:00] jesus christ would be in my flesh
[1:23:02] because it's jesus christ living in your
[1:23:04] flesh
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:09] meet the requirement
[1:23:11] and then you'll receive the token
[1:23:13] the token is the evidence you've met the
[1:23:15] requirement
[1:23:16] and then it's not a life that we live on
[1:23:18] our own it's a life he comes in and
[1:23:19] lives through us
[1:23:25] in the message calling jesus on the
[1:23:27] scene he says now
[1:23:30] the spirit life lays in the blood
[1:23:33] and when the blood cell of a lamb or an
[1:23:35] animal was broken the life that was in
[1:23:37] that cell could not come back on the
[1:23:38] worshipper because it was an animal and
[1:23:40] we are human being we are different the
[1:23:42] animal doesn't have a soul the human
[1:23:44] being has a soul
[1:23:45] so the spirit could not come back upon
[1:23:47] him after he made his offering but yet
[1:23:50] he made it
[1:23:52] and sincerely speaking with faith that
[1:23:54] he believed that the perfect offering
[1:23:56] was coming
[1:23:57] but when the blood cell was broken jesus
[1:23:59] christ
[1:24:00] god was released
[1:24:04] i want you to catch that
[1:24:06] this is a profound statement
[1:24:08] when the blood cell was broken jesus
[1:24:10] christ god was released
[1:24:14] see he was god the blood wasn't jewish
[1:24:16] the blood wasn't gentile that was a
[1:24:18] creative blood cell god himself
[1:24:22] and now through that blood making a
[1:24:23] propitiation for our sins cleanses the
[1:24:26] believer takes all of the sins away from
[1:24:29] him as if he had
[1:24:30] never had sinned
[1:24:33] god puts them in the sea of forgiveness
[1:24:35] and the same god that was upon jesus
[1:24:37] christ continues in the believer doing
[1:24:40] the same works that he did here for it's
[1:24:43] the same spirits
[1:24:45] praise be to god
[1:24:47] there's there's a statement brother
[1:24:48] brandon makes in um
[1:24:51] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:24:52] and he's talking about god's great plan
[1:24:54] that he had in the back part of his mind
[1:24:56] to get preeminence into man give
[1:24:57] preeminence and a people and when he
[1:24:59] comes to this second part this is what
[1:25:01] he says this is paragraph 144 he said
[1:25:03] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[1:25:06] body of believers that is his bride that
[1:25:08] he might live in people
[1:25:10] so that's the second full purpose of his
[1:25:13] threefold plan what god's great plan was
[1:25:15] he wanted to live in people
[1:25:18] now listen what he says next
[1:25:20] now he could do that in adam and eve
[1:25:24] that's what they were created for
[1:25:27] that's what god wanted he wanted to
[1:25:29] become a family upon the earth and live
[1:25:31] in the people
[1:25:33] he said but sin separated them so now
[1:25:36] there had to be some way to get it back
[1:25:39] again so what's he doing he's getting it
[1:25:42] back again
[1:25:44] what happened what happened in the
[1:25:46] beginning what was it blood amen so
[1:25:48] what's he doing blood
[1:25:51] he's bringing it back again
[1:25:54] he has to get it back again
[1:26:01] amen
[1:26:02] now again in christ's mystery god
[1:26:04] revealed he says christ is risen and has
[1:26:06] paid the price of our redemption what
[1:26:08] god in christ manifested he gave that
[1:26:10] flesh that and blood that in the blood
[1:26:13] might come the life and the flesh be
[1:26:15] redeemed
[1:26:16] that god in his redeemed flesh could
[1:26:19] manifest his word for the day as he did
[1:26:22] in that day
[1:26:23] god could do that in adam and eve but
[1:26:25] sin separated it so he had to find a way
[1:26:27] to get it back and his plan to get it
[1:26:28] back was blood
[1:26:32] he goes on to say as i said
[1:26:35] if the life of beethoven was in you
[1:26:39] you would live like beethoven
[1:26:41] pretty simple
[1:26:43] if the life of hitler was in you you
[1:26:45] would live like hitler and when the life
[1:26:46] of christ is in you you'll live like
[1:26:48] christ and the works of christ you do
[1:26:50] and that'll be if christ lived today he
[1:26:53] would do exactly what the word said he
[1:26:55] would do today
[1:26:56] so he said if christ was living today he
[1:26:58] would do he would live that portion of
[1:27:00] the word for this day which is the
[1:27:02] bride's portion you're living today if
[1:27:05] you've been born again by the spirit of
[1:27:07] god amen that life has come back in you
[1:27:09] what is christ doing in you he's living
[1:27:11] that portion of the word for the day
[1:27:13] the bride manifestation the bride
[1:27:15] portion
[1:27:20] in galatians 3 i'm just going to read
[1:27:21] this galatians 3 26 for you are all
[1:27:24] children of god by faith in christ jesus
[1:27:26] for as many of you have been baptized
[1:27:28] into christ have put on christ
[1:27:31] now it's christ
[1:27:32] not me
[1:27:34] now let's go to hebrews chapter 12
[1:27:37] and i want to just wrap up with this
[1:27:38] thought here
[1:27:40] hebrews chapter 12.
[1:27:55] hebrews chapter 12
[1:27:59] verse 22
[1:28:02] but you are coming to mount zion into
[1:28:04] the city of the living god
[1:28:06] the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable
[1:28:08] company of angels to the general
[1:28:11] assembly to the church of the firstborn
[1:28:13] that are written in heaven into god the
[1:28:15] judge of all and the spirits of just men
[1:28:18] made perfect
[1:28:19] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[1:28:21] covenant into the blood of sprinkling
[1:28:24] that's purifying
[1:28:25] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:28:27] abel
[1:28:29] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:28:31] abel
[1:28:34] it this is an interesting scripture i've
[1:28:36] looked at brother bram says much about
[1:28:38] him
[1:28:39] but you've come to jesus the media of
[1:28:41] the new covenant into the blood of
[1:28:42] sprinkling that's the blood of your
[1:28:44] purifying
[1:28:45] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:28:48] abram
[1:28:49] if we could turn to genesis chapter 4.
[1:29:01] genesis chapter 4
[1:29:08] in verse 9.
[1:29:12] and the lord said unto cain where is
[1:29:13] abel thy brother and he said i know not
[1:29:16] am i my brother's keeper
[1:29:18] and he said what hast thou done the
[1:29:20] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[1:29:22] me from the ground
[1:29:25] and hebrews talks about now we've come
[1:29:28] to the blood of jesus the blood of
[1:29:30] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:29:33] than abel
[1:29:34] and the blood of abel was crying out to
[1:29:37] the lord
[1:29:38] and brother branham told us if you look
[1:29:40] into the message he said the blood of
[1:29:42] abel was crying out against cain
[1:29:46] the blood of the of the one that was
[1:29:48] slain the blood of the righteous that
[1:29:49] was slain was crying out to the lord but
[1:29:52] it was crying out against the guilty
[1:29:55] and it was a cry against the wounded and
[1:29:57] done slaying and the lord could hear the
[1:30:00] voice of
[1:30:01] of
[1:30:02] the blood of abel crying out to the lord
[1:30:05] from the ground and it was crying out
[1:30:08] against it was speaking against cain
[1:30:11] but we've come to the blood of
[1:30:12] sprinkling of a purification that speaks
[1:30:15] better things than the blood of abel
[1:30:17] because now that blood is not crying out
[1:30:20] against the guilty it's crying out for
[1:30:23] the guilty
[1:30:24] on behalf of the guilty that blood is
[1:30:26] crying out to have mercy crying out for
[1:30:29] grace crying out for an atonement crying
[1:30:32] out for a covering amen we've come
[1:30:34] there's a different voice this voice of
[1:30:36] the sprinkling of this blood is crying
[1:30:37] out better things than the voice of
[1:30:39] abel's blood abel's blood was crying out
[1:30:42] against cain his blood is crying out for
[1:30:44] us amen for redemption for salvation for
[1:30:48] atonement for recovering for redemption
[1:30:51] to cover the mistake in the garden
[1:30:56] this blood of this sprinkling is
[1:30:57] speaking better things
[1:30:59] than that of abel
[1:31:01] this is not a voice of condemnation
[1:31:03] anymore but this blood is crying out for
[1:31:05] mercy crying out for grace crying out
[1:31:07] for an atonement
[1:31:09] can you hear the voice
[1:31:11] is it calling out forgive them father
[1:31:14] they know not what they're doing
[1:31:17] you see the voice of abel amen you can
[1:31:19] find that same kind of life
[1:31:22] unregenerate life in the souls under the
[1:31:25] altar and the fifth seal because those
[1:31:27] jews they haven't been born again by the
[1:31:29] spirit of god they were just living as
[1:31:31] true to the word as they knew how but
[1:31:33] the souls under the altar i mean they're
[1:31:35] crying out how long o lord till thou
[1:31:37] avenge us
[1:31:39] those souls were voices blood that had
[1:31:42] been shed martyrs that had been martyred
[1:31:45] blood of jews of innocent have been shed
[1:31:47] and they like abel are crying out
[1:31:49] against the guilty
[1:31:53] but when jesus when his blood was being
[1:31:55] spilled from his body on calvary and
[1:31:57] he's nailed to the cross and the blood
[1:31:59] is leaving his body and running to the
[1:32:01] ground he's saying father forgive them
[1:32:04] they don't know what they're doing
[1:32:07] i tell you the voice of this blood
[1:32:08] speaks better things than that of
[1:32:10] abel but when that life comes into you
[1:32:13] and i now our voice the life the the
[1:32:18] the the voice of that blood life is now
[1:32:21] crying out through a people and it's not
[1:32:23] crying out against the guilty it's cry
[1:32:25] out god have mercy god forgive god's
[1:32:28] save god cover what is it you're crying
[1:32:30] out we're crying out the gospel friends
[1:32:32] we're crying out the word we've got the
[1:32:34] blood we've got the life now there's an
[1:32:37] atonement that's still available
[1:32:42] praise be to god
[1:32:44] brother says in the token now sign of
[1:32:47] the full obedience fear is gone paul
[1:32:48] tells us that the blood speaks better
[1:32:50] things
[1:32:52] you say the blood speaks yep the blood
[1:32:54] speaks
[1:32:55] in genesis 4 10 we find out that god
[1:32:57] said the cane or abel's blood spoke out
[1:32:59] of the earth we find out in hebrews 12
[1:33:01] that the blood of the covenant of christ
[1:33:02] speaks better things than that of abel
[1:33:04] we find out the blood does speak it
[1:33:06] speaks in your behalf
[1:33:09] the life that's in you
[1:33:11] speaks from the shed blood
[1:33:14] what's crying on your behalf the life
[1:33:16] that's in you
[1:33:18] it's not crawling out from the ground
[1:33:20] it's not calling out from under the
[1:33:21] altar it's calling out from inside of
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:25] it's speaking on your behalf
[1:33:28] i mean oh brother i wish everybody could
[1:33:30] see that if you can see that it's the
[1:33:32] life that's in you the blood is
[1:33:34] identifying you with it it's the token
[1:33:36] what it is the blood was shed for you
[1:33:38] you've accepted and the life has come
[1:33:40] into you you have the token that's the
[1:33:43] holy spirit
[1:33:46] this is where brother brown makes that
[1:33:47] statement we've mentioned it many times
[1:33:49] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:33:50] revealed he said the church is the blood
[1:33:53] of christ
[1:33:55] the church is the blood of christ by the
[1:33:57] spirit because where is the life of
[1:33:59] christ all that god was he poured into
[1:34:01] christ
[1:34:03] all that christ was he poured where
[1:34:05] into the church
[1:34:07] so where is the spirit of christ in the
[1:34:09] church where is the life that was in
[1:34:11] that blood in the church it's in you and
[1:34:13] i brother it's crying out it's crying
[1:34:16] out on our behalf it's the token
[1:34:18] speaking for us that we've met jehovah's
[1:34:20] requirements we're safe from wrath we're
[1:34:22] safe from destruction we've been saved
[1:34:26] what declares you've been saved his life
[1:34:28] in me declares it's the token that
[1:34:30] declares i'm saved
[1:34:35] outside of that there's no guarantee
[1:34:42] see his life has come in you and you
[1:34:44] have the token
[1:34:45] that's the holy spirit
[1:34:47] the church is the blood of christ
[1:34:50] by the spirit because the life is in the
[1:34:52] blood
[1:34:54] where
[1:34:55] i can no longer find the chemistry of
[1:34:57] the
[1:34:58] blood but the life that was in that
[1:35:01] blood is here
[1:35:03] it's crying out from earth
[1:35:07] from dirt
[1:35:13] all the way back in leviticus he tells
[1:35:15] those who are hunting and those who slam
[1:35:17] an animal to take the blood and cover it
[1:35:19] in dust
[1:35:23] but in this day god has taken that blood
[1:35:25] life and he's covered it in dust
[1:35:27] my dust and your dust
[1:35:30] and that life is living on the inside of
[1:35:33] earthen vessels
[1:35:36] and it's crying out
[1:35:37] but it's a cry it's crying for us on our
[1:35:40] behalf
[1:35:43] he goes on
[1:35:45] the same possessing the gate to the
[1:35:47] enemy
[1:35:49] i spoke on it at houston somewhere
[1:35:51] i mean dallas the token
[1:35:53] a jew could show down in israel that he
[1:35:55] was a jew by circumcision but god said
[1:35:57] when i see the blood
[1:35:59] and the blood shall be a token unto you
[1:36:01] it shall be a token the life that was in
[1:36:03] the blood could not come in the
[1:36:05] worshipper because well it was animal
[1:36:06] life it was only a shadow coming up to
[1:36:08] the real life then the chemistry of the
[1:36:10] blood itself had to be read upon the
[1:36:12] door and the post of the door
[1:36:14] applied by hyssop we're coming back to
[1:36:16] this thought and i want you we've
[1:36:18] mentioned before but i want you to hone
[1:36:19] in on it again
[1:36:21] applied by hyssop which is just a common
[1:36:24] weed
[1:36:25] showing that you don't have to have
[1:36:27] super faith
[1:36:28] you just have to have some to have the
[1:36:31] same the faith you got like you have to
[1:36:33] start your car come to church a lot of
[1:36:35] people think that they got to have
[1:36:36] something but no that's wrong just
[1:36:38] common faith is all you have to apply
[1:36:40] the blood by
[1:36:42] hear the word
[1:36:44] believe the word apply it
[1:36:46] that's all
[1:36:50] i'm waiting until something
[1:36:52] magnificent happens
[1:36:55] i'm waiting for some super duper faith
[1:36:58] till i can speak something into
[1:36:59] existence
[1:37:01] he said no just take the common faith
[1:37:03] that you've got
[1:37:05] to believe the word of god
[1:37:08] and believe what he said and then apply
[1:37:10] it
[1:37:12] and if you believe it and apply it
[1:37:13] according to the scriptures then the
[1:37:15] tokens got to come
[1:37:19] and the token is the evidence that you
[1:37:21] believed the word and applied it
[1:37:27] he goes down a couple paragraphs later
[1:37:31] but when jesus the son of god virgin
[1:37:33] born shed his blood the life that was in
[1:37:35] that blood was god itself
[1:37:38] the bible said we are saved by the life
[1:37:40] the blood of god not the blood of jew
[1:37:42] not the blood of a gentile
[1:37:43] but the life of god god created this
[1:37:47] this blood cell virgin born
[1:37:50] then he goes on to say now that in doing
[1:37:52] this he coming from him was god the
[1:37:56] spirit that spirit became upon the
[1:37:58] believer therefore the life that was in
[1:38:00] our sacrifice we are identified by that
[1:38:03] same life
[1:38:05] that
[1:38:06] is our token
[1:38:09] the
[1:38:12] the blood
[1:38:13] was the plan from the beginning
[1:38:16] because the blood
[1:38:18] what brought life into corruption
[1:38:21] but god is going to bring our life out
[1:38:23] of corruption
[1:38:24] and someday he'll change the very
[1:38:26] elements of this body but right now he's
[1:38:28] changed us by injecting his own life
[1:38:31] into us
[1:38:33] what do i have to do to get that brother
[1:38:35] to do i have to pray all night do i have
[1:38:36] to fast for three days
[1:38:41] take the simple faith that you got to
[1:38:43] believe his word
[1:38:44] do you believe his word
[1:38:46] then you've got the hyssom
[1:38:50] did he provide the blood
[1:38:52] he provided the blood he's given us the
[1:38:54] word he's told us how to apply it just
[1:38:56] take the hyssop that's in your hand
[1:38:58] and repent
[1:39:01] repent for your wrong life repent for
[1:39:03] being born wrong repent for everything
[1:39:06] in you being wrong
[1:39:09] repent for delaying repent for putting
[1:39:11] him off repent for over complicating
[1:39:13] things
[1:39:16] take him out his word and said if he
[1:39:19] said if i repent
[1:39:21] and are baptized in the name of jesus
[1:39:23] christ for the remission sins i shall
[1:39:25] receive the gift of the holy ghost then
[1:39:27] that life that was released at calvary
[1:39:29] will come into me and that is my token
[1:39:32] that is my evidence that i met jehovah's
[1:39:34] requirements
[1:39:37] it's the life what's the blood all about
[1:39:40] the blood through the whole bible is
[1:39:41] about life
[1:39:43] that's what it's about it's about true
[1:39:46] life the real life the genuine life our
[1:39:49] life was perverted but his life wasn't
[1:39:51] so unperverted life comes to correct our
[1:39:53] perverted life to bring us back into an
[1:39:55] unperverted life again
[1:39:57] that's the whole story of the bible
[1:39:58] that's the gospel that's why it's blood
[1:40:00] from the beginning blood to the end
[1:40:02] that's why he was a lamb slain from the
[1:40:04] foundation of the world and your names
[1:40:06] were put in there because god knew what
[1:40:07] was going to happen he
[1:40:09] he allowed it to go this way so that we
[1:40:11] would gain understanding through this
[1:40:14] life but he provided everything we
[1:40:16] needed in this life
[1:40:17] and he provided a blood as a substitute
[1:40:20] because ours was corrupt and now he's
[1:40:21] provided a life from the blood because
[1:40:24] our life was corrupt
[1:40:26] to bring us back to the right life
[1:40:29] look at first john chapter 1.
[1:40:45] first john chapter 1
[1:40:48] and verse 5 5 first john 1 5.
[1:40:53] this then is the message which we have
[1:40:54] heard of him and declare unto you
[1:40:57] that god is light and in him has no
[1:40:59] darkness at all
[1:41:01] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:41:03] him and walk in darkness we lie do not
[1:41:05] the truth
[1:41:06] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:41:08] the light
[1:41:09] we have fellowship one with another
[1:41:12] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:41:14] cleanses us from all sin
[1:41:17] what must i do to have this sprinkling
[1:41:19] of this blood
[1:41:20] walk in the light
[1:41:22] as he is in the light
[1:41:24] let's turn to the gospel of john john
[1:41:27] chapter 1.
[1:41:36] john chapter 1
[1:41:41] and verse 1.
[1:41:46] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:41:48] word was with god and the word was god
[1:41:52] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:41:55] we know later in verse 14 he says and
[1:41:56] that word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:41:58] us when that word was made flesh it had
[1:42:00] blood
[1:42:01] created blood
[1:42:03] god's created blood
[1:42:05] and when that shed it was
[1:42:07] the blood
[1:42:09] of the word made flesh
[1:42:12] that's why brother ben would later come
[1:42:13] and say the word it bled for you
[1:42:16] it died for you
[1:42:18] because the full word of god was made
[1:42:20] into a flesh body and that flesh body
[1:42:22] was going to be the sacrifice the lamb
[1:42:24] of god there was a life inside that life
[1:42:27] and that life was the life of god that
[1:42:29] was released at the shedding of that
[1:42:31] blood and that life now could come back
[1:42:34] in the believer what god wanted to do in
[1:42:36] eden but was ruined by sin now he can do
[1:42:40] what he couldn't do for the entire old
[1:42:41] testament
[1:42:43] by the shedding of that blood that life
[1:42:44] can now come and dwell inside of you and
[1:42:47] god can dwell with his people again
[1:42:51] but it was the word that made an
[1:42:53] atonement for
[1:42:54] us that's why it's the word that brings
[1:42:57] us back to him
[1:43:00] and it says he goes on here in verse 2
[1:43:02] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:43:04] what the word
[1:43:06] all things were made by him and without
[1:43:07] him was not anything made that was made
[1:43:10] in him was life remember what's this
[1:43:12] whole issue of blood it's about life
[1:43:16] in him was life
[1:43:18] and the life was the light of men
[1:43:22] that life was the light of men the
[1:43:24] illumination of men that life is what
[1:43:26] gave men life and light and that
[1:43:29] was perverted in the garden but now if
[1:43:33] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:43:34] light what's light the life is the light
[1:43:38] what is walking what is if we walk in
[1:43:40] the light as he is in the light we're
[1:43:42] walking in his life
[1:43:45] because his word is spirit and his life
[1:43:49] it's all about life that's why in this
[1:43:52] day we can't look i mean we can't we
[1:43:54] can't talk about things that had
[1:43:56] happened eons ago and thousands of years
[1:43:58] ago but we have to we have to walk in
[1:44:00] the light as he is in the light because
[1:44:02] he is the life and the life is the light
[1:44:04] amen in the word has life and the word
[1:44:07] was made life in the word bled and died
[1:44:09] for us so we must come to him and walk
[1:44:12] in the light as he is in the light
[1:44:15] and if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:44:17] the light the blood of jesus christ his
[1:44:19] son cleanses us from all sin
[1:44:22] that's why these denominational systems
[1:44:25] will fail and continue to fail and
[1:44:27] they're not really getting anybody
[1:44:28] anywhere
[1:44:30] because god has come and he's given us
[1:44:32] the light to walk in
[1:44:35] and if we walk in that light that's
[1:44:37] where the life is and this issue of
[1:44:38] blood is all about life
[1:44:42] and it's the life that's purifying our
[1:44:44] life
[1:44:47] and when we walk in this life and
[1:44:50] then we really know what we were
[1:44:53] and we know that god changed us
[1:44:56] we could we we couldn't overcome
[1:44:58] ourselves we couldn't live this word
[1:45:01] but another life come inside
[1:45:04] and that life began to walk us step and
[1:45:06] step with the word and as he revealed
[1:45:08] the word we would repent and we would
[1:45:10] line up to the word and as he would
[1:45:11] review more we would repent and line up
[1:45:13] to the word and we begin to walk in the
[1:45:15] light as he is in the light and the
[1:45:16] blood of jesus christ is cleansing us
[1:45:20] from all sin
[1:45:23] in that life that is in us
[1:45:26] causing us to line to the word
[1:45:29] that life is our token
[1:45:32] it is my evidence
[1:45:35] i had no capacity to live right before
[1:45:39] i could fake it on sunday
[1:45:41] but i couldn't live it in my private
[1:45:43] life
[1:45:45] i could pretend to be a believer sunday
[1:45:47] and wednesday and when other believers
[1:45:48] were around amen but when i was a boy
[1:45:51] growing up in the church i could pretend
[1:45:53] i knew the cliches i knew the catch
[1:45:54] phrases i knew when to raise my hands i
[1:45:56] knew when to respond
[1:45:59] and i wasn't doing it to be a hypocrite
[1:46:01] although i was a hypocrite i was doing
[1:46:03] it genuinely because i did love the lord
[1:46:05] and i wanted to be right
[1:46:07] i had a desire to be right so i was
[1:46:10] doing everything because i wanted to be
[1:46:11] right but no matter how much i did right
[1:46:13] inside i could never be right
[1:46:19] i would go to church and worship and
[1:46:21] leave with the same desire to cause me
[1:46:23] to sin the day before
[1:46:27] but something changed with this message
[1:46:31] all of a sudden
[1:46:33] i realized that god is his word
[1:46:37] how can i receive the baptism of the
[1:46:39] holy ghost and have the life of the word
[1:46:41] on the inside and refuse to live the
[1:46:43] word
[1:46:44] refuse to believe the word to refuse to
[1:46:46] acknowledge the message
[1:46:49] it's impossible
[1:46:50] because the life of the word is the life
[1:46:52] that's in me
[1:46:56] something changed
[1:46:58] and now when nobody's looking
[1:47:01] i still serve god
[1:47:04] doesn't mean i've lived a life without
[1:47:06] failures without regrets without
[1:47:07] repentances without things that i'm
[1:47:09] still ashamed of but something changed
[1:47:11] friends it's different now now it's not
[1:47:13] about uh uh i'm i just want to be right
[1:47:16] i still want to be right but it's not
[1:47:18] about the it's the desire has changed i
[1:47:20] don't want anything of this world i want
[1:47:22] nothing i want nothing to do with it i
[1:47:24] don't want anything else what i want
[1:47:26] more than anything else is i want him i
[1:47:27] want to please him i want him to be
[1:47:29] happy with me i want to satisfy him
[1:47:31] that's all i want in this life
[1:47:34] i want him to live through me
[1:47:38] but did it
[1:47:40] i'll tell you what did it for me
[1:47:43] recognizing that what that prophet said
[1:47:44] was the truth
[1:47:46] and it was the scripture
[1:47:48] and as simple as taking a little bit of
[1:47:50] hyssop that was in my hand
[1:47:53] and saying
[1:47:54] lord i'm sorry
[1:47:57] for misunderstanding you all these years
[1:47:59] i'm sorry for living a hypocritical life
[1:48:02] i'm sorry for trying to be a christian
[1:48:04] i'm sorry for all of those things
[1:48:07] but i'm going to repent and i'm going to
[1:48:09] be baptized according to the scriptures
[1:48:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:48:15] that was the simple act of obedience
[1:48:18] that it took for something to change
[1:48:21] inside of me
[1:48:22] to come to the word to acknowledge the
[1:48:24] word and take the simple faith that is
[1:48:26] in our hands and just apply the word
[1:48:30] and believe it
[1:48:32] and let god
[1:48:34] bring the token the evidence
[1:48:36] that you've met his requirements
[1:48:39] a false repentance won't do it
[1:48:42] a baptism with no sincerity
[1:48:45] but a repentance and a sincerity and
[1:48:47] obedience to the word
[1:48:49] will bring the promise of the word
[1:48:53] let's just keep it simple
[1:48:56] how many are thankful that there's been
[1:48:58] blood
[1:49:00] we've been born wrong you know you were
[1:49:02] born wrong
[1:49:04] with no hope
[1:49:05] but he was born right
[1:49:08] and he lived right and he surrendered
[1:49:10] right and he did everything right and he
[1:49:12] was the perfect man with the perfect
[1:49:14] life and the perfect surrender but now
[1:49:16] that life has been sprinkled upon me
[1:49:19] to purify my life and i've received the
[1:49:22] token that i've met jehovah's
[1:49:23] requirements and i'm as secure as secure
[1:49:26] can be
[1:49:27] not by works
[1:49:29] but i'm secure the same way abel was
[1:49:30] secure
[1:49:32] because he met jehovah's requirements
[1:49:35] he understood what happened he knows why
[1:49:38] and now we're not just going through
[1:49:39] motions
[1:49:41] we're not just repeating after parents
[1:49:44] you know my dad did i do my grandma did
[1:49:46] i do the pastor says i repeat but now
[1:49:49] the message has come to show us
[1:49:51] why it's blood
[1:49:53] what happened to the life what the
[1:49:55] substitutes were all about and why we
[1:49:57] don't still offer animal sacrifices
[1:50:00] because the substitutes were only
[1:50:02] pointing to the true the true has come
[1:50:04] now that's done away with now we have
[1:50:05] the truth but now how do i get the
[1:50:07] application of the blood i receive that
[1:50:09] life i received the word and received
[1:50:10] the life of the word and when i received
[1:50:12] the life of the word the life of the
[1:50:13] word comes in me and lives the word out
[1:50:15] of me
[1:50:18] that simple
[1:50:20] that's what this blood is all about it's
[1:50:23] about life
[1:50:25] now to have his blood
[1:50:27] is to have his life
[1:50:29] to have his life is to have the token
[1:50:32] to have the token is to have an evidence
[1:50:36] that he's received
[1:50:38] i've obeyed
[1:50:39] his commandments and i've met his
[1:50:41] requirements
[1:50:43] and he's accepted me
[1:50:46] i say thank you lord jesus
[1:50:48] what a day we live in friends
[1:50:51] no more
[1:50:53] no more confusion
[1:50:55] but an absolute understanding of what
[1:50:58] christ has done for us
[1:50:59] i thank god let's all stand
[1:51:02] musicians if you could come
[1:51:06] i just had a question
[1:51:08] why blood
[1:51:10] and a couple days later
[1:51:12] i was really happy
[1:51:14] looking at why blood
[1:51:16] what is it with all this blood
[1:51:19] it's about life friends
[1:51:21] it's about his life
[1:51:23] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:51:26] lord jesus we thank you for the
[1:51:28] privilege of being here this morning
[1:51:31] god not just being here this morning but
[1:51:33] being in this age lord

[1:51:37] your bible

[1:51:41] reveal to us lord what
[1:51:43] has happened in this life

[1:53:14] name of the lord jesus christ for the

[1:57:56] and then we'll go into the song service
[1:57:58] and the communion
[1:58:00] just want to add one one thing
[1:58:02] when god had a way of escape when he had
[1:58:05] a token available for his people
[1:58:08] he didn't make it complicated
[1:58:10] he made it possible
[1:58:13] he didn't make them go through
[1:58:14] extravagant things he didn't tell them
[1:58:16] you know bring me the foreskins of 400
[1:58:18] egyptians he didn't make it grand feats
[1:58:21] and difficult accomplishments and he
[1:58:23] didn't make it marathons and all of
[1:58:25] these things he made it something they
[1:58:28] could do
[1:58:29] he gave him something they could do and
[1:58:31] what they did proved that they believed
[1:58:33] what he said and accepted it to be true
[1:58:36] and their worship vindicated that they
[1:58:38] received the life of the lamb
[1:58:40] and in this day god requires a new birth
[1:58:43] does he require a token
[1:58:45] he requires a token just like in the
[1:58:47] passover requires a token why would god
[1:58:49] require a token and not make it possible
[1:58:51] for his people to have it
[1:58:53] or make it so difficult and so
[1:58:55] complicated but he's put it in our hands
[1:58:58] we've got enough faith to receive the
[1:59:00] word and say i'll just do what he said
[1:59:02] do and believe that he'll do what he
[1:59:04] said he would do
[1:59:05] let's just receive it that way and
[1:59:07] receive the holy ghost
[1:59:09] receive it
[1:59:11] just receive it upon the basis of the
[1:59:13] word receive it upon our conduct our
[1:59:16] action and obedience to the word now
[1:59:18] receive the holy ghost of the gift
[1:59:21] and let god do what god's gonna do but
[1:59:23] quit putting it off and quit jumping
[1:59:25] through some man-made hoops and quit
[1:59:27] making things complicated there's no
[1:59:29] maze to get to the holy ghost
[1:59:32] there's no difficult journey there's
[1:59:35] just a simple obedience and a surrender
[1:59:36] to the word and do what he said do and
[1:59:38] if you do what he said do then believe
[1:59:40] that he'll do what he said he would do
[1:59:42] now you'll receive the gift
[1:59:44] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:47] nowhere in the bible did god make it
[1:59:49] impossible for his elect seed
[1:59:51] to find redemption
[1:59:53] he made it within their reach
[1:59:55] and god has made it within our reach all
[1:59:57] he asks us to do is believe the word and
[2:00:00] apply it
[2:00:01] let's just do that with the simple faith
[2:00:04] that we have
[2:00:05] then god bless you as you go let's sing
[2:00:07] that song again brother ben
