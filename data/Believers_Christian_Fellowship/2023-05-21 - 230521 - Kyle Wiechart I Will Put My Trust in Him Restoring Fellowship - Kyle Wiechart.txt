this day of the resurrection and go to church the Lord by your grace you've assembled us today Lord we believe it was for a purpose and Lord we just asked Lord that you would bless our time pray Lord that you would take my lips and you pushed me out of the way Lord and say those things that are needful Lord to help your people Lord I am insufficient I am unable but Lord you are more than able to do things that we have no idea what we could possibly do when we just yield ourselves to thee so father God speak through my lips and hear through the ears that are before me Father we love you we commit this time into your hands in Jesus name amen amen I'll let you have your seats for just a moment well it's good to be with you again I always would rather be sitting in the chair by my wife but it followeth my lot to be here then knowing brother Isaiah was here and I was like well I'd really rather be sitting in my chair today such a song brother I inspiring song So enjoyed the service Wednesday night how many enjoyed the service I was really blessed by the service and that was the first time I got the opportunity to hear our brother Isaiah and I was truly blessed I really really enjoyed it and I was so encouraged uh you all know what happened with me a couple years ago when I mowed the yard and I hit a bunch of stones and it threw it on my Jeep and threw a stone at the neighbor and the neighbor started cussing me out and I got a little bit angry and then to hear Brother Isaiah Brooks kind of had a little similar situation and it made me feel a little better that we're all growing we're all maturing in the grace and knowledge of God and it's certainly not him that willeth nor him that runeth it's God that showed us Grace and it's his grace that keeps us it's his grace that holds us it's his grace that gives us just enough Faith to take the next step right before us bringing us back into his presence with fellowship with him so I sure enjoyed it brother Isaiah wanted to obviously let you know brother Chad better Ben told us he's down in Junction City Ministry into the group down there and the family is there with him so you all be praying for him just a lovely group I was there last month and boy they're fun to minister to very open very hungry and just a real honor um as you all know oh I have the I think I have it right brother Franco there was some pictures um there was a baptism on Thursday me and brother Wesley were invited um last month when I was down in Junction City a young man from Holmes County had come down he said the Lord told him to come down to the meeting and when he was there he uh we we spoke on walking in the light and he had a desire to be baptized he called me and he said brother I went to my pastor I asked him to re-baptize me in the name of the Lord he said I'll be praying about it he came to him a couple days later and said I don't feel comfortable in doing that and so he called me and said brother will you baptize me I said it'd be an honor brother and so I had a couple pictures from that we drove over on Thursday to Danville and uh just probably the most beautiful setting for a baptism I've ever been a part of um me and brother Ron were baptizing in Pakistan in a drainage ditch this was a little bit of an upgrade from that just slightly so I was really like wow this is nice we should do them all like this and just a beautiful Bridge there that they found that was a deep enough for a baptism and about 35 people showed up almost the entire group from Junction City showed up and a couple unique things about it was you see this couple right there before you that's an Amish couple and uh they had just so happened the the lady there said hey we should go for a bike ride today and told her husband and so they went for a bike ride and she said well let's go to that bridge of Dreams we'll go ride our bikes up there so they're riding their bikes and wouldn't you know they know Jesse Jesse's the one we baptized they did not know anybody else there but they knew Jesse Jesse lives an hour away but they knew Jesse now I don't even know the full connection but they saw him like Jesse what are you doing here he said I'm getting baptized in the name Lord Jesus Christ I'm like whoa we're gonna stay and so they stayed and I um I uh thought I would just share a couple scriptures on baptism and I end up preaching for like 35 minutes um and I it was such a unique it was just like a poll I didn't even like hardly get to say hi I'm Kyle I just they're standing there we all gathered in the shade and I just kept I just went I just went I don't know what else to tell you I just went and uh they stood there locked for 35 minutes that Amish couple and um there was another man there I won't Point him out but there's another man there who came he's the father of one that was baptized a couple months ago part of that Junction City group he's still in the Amish and he came and then after the baptism and after hearing the things he said well looks like I'll be getting re-baptized soon and this son told him he says that means this is a big deal for him he's kind of an elder in the Amish church that he's a part of this is uh pretty much a clear rejection that he's approaching but he's convinced and uh and even that Amish couple they went away and they they said you know what our daughter called us this morning and said you know what something really good is going to happen and they're like now we see what this was this was that really good thing that was supposed to happen they shook my hand thanked me and just was really happy to be there so I don't exactly know what all is going on but something's happening something is clearly happening over there and I'm just so happy to see it to see those those you know their eyes light up when they hear the word it's just like it's so freeing to him you know the truth shall set you free and to see they just light up and they're so hungry and they're so open like I pull no punches I'm saying things as hard as I know how to say them and they're like liking it I'm like wow this is great this is refreshing and um so God's doing something and we're all he'll take it I don't know but this I know God usually gives just enough light to see if you'll take that next step and thus far I believe now 25 people 26 people have taken that step and we're trusting God to give a little bit lower light and to continue to walk in those next steps and so because we find that's the nature of God and that's what God's doing with all of his children he's just putting forth just enough light before you to see if you'll walk in that light with him and so it was just a real honor to be there and then here is our the brother Jesse and just a sweet man I just the first time I talked to him he came to that baptism of the 17 in Junction City it's the first time I met him he sat beside me by the campfire and we just started talking and uh he came out of the Amish uh came out of from what I gather a pretty bad situation at home and he said to think just a year ago I was addicted to drugs and now here I am set free from those things and know the love of God and I'm walking with God it's just a real humble sweet sincerity that just really was awesome it was so good to see and he just after the baptism he just asked everybody will you be he said will you pray for me so I can show the love of God to my parents I said well we'll be praying for you we believe that that's a sincere hearts desire and God's going to bless him in in doing that so he wants to show love to his parents so you peering for him be praying for him and so that was awesome and uh then I just wanted to let you know brother Chad had mentioned a little bible study so on Friday night we had a Bible study and I wanted to share just a reason why that bible study um a few months back about six months ago I was cleaning out my office which I tried to do every five to seven years it's kind of my pattern and when I was cleaning out my office like six months ago my wife's a better cleaner than me and I know she loves to do it otherwise you know just kidding um I came across this paper and this paper I hadn't seen this for 10 years or eight years or something and this paper inspired me and about 10 years ago a lot of the men here had a men's meeting we were over in poke again and the former Pastor asked all the men a question he said what something like this he said what did this message reveal to you about Christ and I said well that's easy I grabbed my pen and I started writing and I filled out the front and the back and when I began to look at it I realized I did not know who he was I had heard about God but it was too far away from me and I began to realize this message meeting personal it made me understand the character I said it's like it was all foggy it was all blurry and now I can see the detail of his character and of his nature and what he likes and what he doesn't like it's like I've now personally come in contact with the person of the word that I heard about it's like that scripture I have heard but now I see and I began to look at those and I began to realize how much of this has meant so much to me and I had wrote down the holy spirit's very timid he can only lead a lamb-like nature I understand correct baptism I understand the anointed ones at the uh at the end time I can now see the wise and foolish version the foolish version not damn but let's go through tribulation I realized in predestination I wasn't looking for God he came looking for me and I filled this out and every one of these was like a stepping stone for me that brought me into his presence so when I was looking at that six months ago something struck me about it and then I a couple months later was reading in Hebrews and in Hebrews 5 it says you know he's talking about Melchizedek and when he's talking about Melchizedek he said oh I have a lot of things I'd like to tell you and he says but this strong meat and you can't handle it and he says when you ought to be teachers you have need for somebody to teach you the first principles and when I read that I thought first principles so in order for me to step in and see the complete mystery of God I got to make sure I have a good grasp of these first principles then he drops down and he says you know let us move on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of what of repentance unto dead works and a faith in God and of baptism and of laying on of hands and all of these things he said but thus we will do and when it struck me and I thought oh now the burden's there and it's not going away I feel to do this so I talked to brother Chad and I said Hey Brother um if it's all right I like to start doing a Bible study especially for the young people but anybody that's babes or anybody that would like to pull up some of these stepping stones and look at them together and uh and maybe it'll help our faith and then I want to be found faithful I always want to be bound faithful to do my part first to my family and then to the youth you know it's a tremendous honor that you parents get get to allow me to minister to your youth I appreciate the confidence and I feel a responsibility to do my best so that's the burden and if anybody wants to come if you're a new believer or you'd like to look at some of those stones you're more than welcome to come we'll be having those Bible studies the first and third Friday night and we took that first one uh not repentance of dead works and having faith to God realizing this has nothing to do with your Merit you didn't Merit a thing this this is God's grace Abraham didn't do anything God came to Abraham and it was his Covenant that God made with Abraham not that Abraham could keep that Covenant but God would keep that Covenant unconditionally we find we are of the same offspring of Abraham and we're going to go on into water baptism I want to go into mystery Babylon mother harlots the Seal of God the mark of the beast some of those foundational truths that we know I understand we know it but some of us may need to look at it a little bit more clearly and just realize they're just stepping stones into his presence and so you're more than welcome to come if you should like to do so so now you understand why all right I got all the announcements that I can think of off my mind yep why don't you stand with me I'd like to sing a song while we kind of change the order here for a moment the song struck my heart this morning was my faith looks up to thee I think it's an old song I don't know how often we sing it but if brother Ben if you could help us [Music] of God Save Your Divine foreign [Music] [Music] me thy right to praise him on [Music] my face [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus be ugly Life Starts [Music] around me spread ready now my God [Music] [Music] prayer today [Music] [Music] [Music] way that's cool [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and this trust removed oh Lord hear me sing along [Music] amen if you will turn in your Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 8 . thank you musicians appreciate it how many's faith is looking to him that's where I'm resting in my faith is resting in his infallible word my faith is not resting in my human intellects or my human abilities anybody that walks with the Lord long enough you become to be getting less confident in yourself more confident that God will never fail God keeps his word God will perform his word this is his victory not mine and I was preparing yesterday and just not just alone and just kept wandering and walking and praying and meditating and walking and praying and meditating and hit nothing for hours and hours and hours and then around 7 30 8 o'clock at night I read a scripture as soon as I read the stricture it lit up for me and I went for a walk and started crying and began to think some things through it and that's what we're going to go into I believe in I believe Paul was unorganized but spirit-led I believe that the Holy Ghost takes us in our his hands and he he just guides our footsteps one foot at one step at a time and I'm just trusting I'm walking out here by faith he's gonna light one thing up for me I'll take a step in that he'll light another thing up for me I'll take a step in that because I still want him to be my guide I can't guide myself you can't guide yourself I need a guide I need somebody that I can have faith and confidence in that I take his hand and he leads me through each and every day all the way into his presence and so I want to take a look at these scriptures and I'm truly trusting him and you'll be praying you be pulling you look to God I'm just a man I'm insufficient in every way possible there's only a couple things I'm good at and that's really failing I'm really good at failing God can never fail I can fail are you good at something failing that's what you're good at that's what we are good at as human beings we're good at messing things up I'm so glad that he cannot fail and his word can't he cannot lie that word will never fail it will never the whole world will pass away but that word will never pass away and if I can just place my faith and if I have faith in God that came from God that was a free gift of God if I can just rest right there on his word and wait for for him he'll perform every promise that he promised he would make and so I'd like you to look here in Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 19. Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 19. it begins like this behold the voice of the Cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the Lord in Zion question mark is not her King in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities the Harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black and astonishment hath taken Hold On Me is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the of the daughter of my people recovered we also turn to Hebrews chapters 2 verse 8. Hebrews chapters 2 verse 8. the word of God reads thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it becometh him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they whom are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren and in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee e and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me it's powerheads Heavenly Father once more we come before you Lord take the word speak to our hearts Lord you be the Divine interpreter and Lord brood amongst your people we pray in Jesus name amen it may be seated for a title I'm drawing from that last portion of scripture it says I will put my trust in him anti is a subtitle which I'm not good at subtitles but I I like them I like to at least say I have a subtitle restoring Fellowship and as I was walking there yesterday and I was walked outside and I began to meditate on that scripture of I will put my trust in him my daughter came up to me and she gave me a hug said I love you walked away then about an hour later I'm inside still sitting there meditating my wife came up kissed me on the back head walked away and as a father and as a husband again I think my I sure love them they're thinking of me here I am I don't know what I'm going to preach tomorrow I don't have a clue where this is going I'm not good at this I shouldn't even be doing this brother Isaiah's here he should do this there's others here far more with ability and confidence and experience they should do this and uh but as I'm sitting there I'm realizing just how much I love the fellowship of my family boy it means so much to you when someone just comes up puts their arms around and say I love you I'm praying for you Daddy man that meant a lot to me and then instantly I began to think about God and began to think about what happened back there in the garden you know this whole thing he God loves Fellowship God wants Fellowship God just doesn't want to be known God wants Fellowship he wants you to come into His presence he wants to walk with you he wants to be known he and you can't walk with him unless you know him and how can you know him except he expresses himself and he takes you through circumstances and situations and problems and darkness he wants to express these attributes he'll allow you to get sick just so he can express that he's the Healer he'll allows you to go into darkness just to bring forth the light of Deliverance in your life he has all these attributes because he's a father he's a savior he's a Healer he's a guide he's all of these things he's everything and everything is put under his feet and I'm not looking to me I'm looking to him because he's everything and as I began to sit there I began to think oh what did God feel that day when man rejected his leadership when man grieved him when man stepped away from the protection and the covering of the veil of the word of God and by a lust Veil who lusted for knowledge lusted for things that God didn't share with him and it brought them out from behind the veil of God's word and he separated Fellowship Ma you can imagine what God felt in that hour my how it grieved him how it broke his heart the highlight of his day was coming down in the cool of the evenings no doubt seeing hey children did you enjoy your day how did I saw I saw you guys are over by the lake and I saw you over there with Leo the Lion did you have a great day oh Father we had just a wonderful day and you know every father that comes home you like to hear how you kids did that day every every husband wants to hear how'd your wife do that day you want to sit there you want to hear if they had a good day and you like to hear you're like Eliana she's so expression my little six-year-old she's so expression she can make a boring story exciting you know it's just the reality they can just they just light up with certain things and it's such a highlight for a father and a mother to hear their children to have a good day oh I had such a wonderful time with their friends for doing this or doing that it's a it's a highlight it's a highlight in my evening to come home to have dinner with the family and hear how everybody's doing how'd you do and how'd the wife doing and all those things it's my highlight I love that fellowship with my family and in fact I love you all but I'd rather spend time with my wife and daughters more than all of you now I'm just being honest you would say the same thing if you were here we love each other but there's just something about that closeness you have with a husband and a wife and your children you love them you love being with them and you begin to think about God wanting that Fellowship having that fellowship and then it's broken like a husband that comes home and he sees his wife's despondent we've all been there we see our wives she's quiet she's distance and it just eats you up like what's wrong what what happened did I do something what you can't rest am I the only one I'm a little bit weird about that you know I see my daughter she's kind of down a little bit I was like Hey the world stops what's going on I want to know what's happened I want to know what what what what happened someone hurt you someone say something did you do something what happened you know it's in me as a father to want to understand and I want my family happy I want my children happy I want my wife happy I want to see Smiles I don't want to see frowns you know and it's just in me to go about to do whatever I can do to put a smile back on their face it's just something in us it's something in a father something in a mother it's something in us that's doing that and I began to think oh my goodness what did he feel that hour what did he feel how did he feel oh man but he wasn't going to let it stay separated God rich in Mercy went to action to restore Fellowship that's what this entire mystery plan of God is it's restoring Fellowship that's what God wanted in the beginning that's his heart's desire not just to know about God but to know God I know him in the power of his resurrection we his benefactors partakers of his divine nature and that's when I had that little piece of paper I started looking at all these truths all of these truths were bringing into view the nature and the character of the person Jesus Christ and when I began to understand him again to understand why he said this why he said that why he did this why he did that you look at the tender hand of Jehovah without the revelation of this message and how he dealt with Israel through the Old Testament you would stand back and say what kind of God is this I'm a little bit scared I'm a little bit nervous but under the revelation of the mystery of the message and this hour it brought into view the tender hand of Jehovah God loves his children so much he'll spank you so hard sometimes because he loves you he wants fellowship with you he's going to restore fellowship at all costs that's God's purpose that's God's desire Fellowship not that we should just all gather as a group of people and come to a church and agree with a certain set of doctrines or certain set of truths no this is the fellowship of his attributes connecting again with the divine nature of God that's his heart's desire I'm a partaker of the divine nature of God that's what I'm Desiring that's what he desired to restore Fellowship and you cannot have Fellowship unless you understand one another you know a husband has to understand a wife a wife has to understand a husband in order for there to be Fellowship a brother has to understand the brother another you know for Fellowship there's got to be understanding for Fellowship so this whole thing was to bring about Fellowship restored attributes of God bringing them back into fellowship and I found it interesting when brother branham's first recorded sermon it is Faith is the substance the last recorded message of brother Branham is communion in communion he says I realize I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham I am a Son of God and he goes on to say and in the presence of God he said like a little Eagle I've been called up higher now in the presence of God now you understand what this is all about now do you see the pyramid we're climbing everyone God's all had us on a journey to bring us back into Fellowship again restoring that which was lost in the Garden of Eden now he's restoring that Fellowship in the devil's Eden Satan's Eden God's restoring his attributes again oh my goodness this is awesome to me this goes beyond just trying to mentally intellectually try to put something together I see the purpose of God God's doing all of these things to restore me back into my position with God that I had with him before the foundation of the earth redeeming those attributes for Fellowship Hebrews 11 5 says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death in that he was not found because God translated him and before his translation he had this testimony he that he pleased God but without faith without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him so the entire first step of this walk or this journey back to fellowship begins with what everyone faith Faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness in the Capstone of divine love but it's all settling on this first set of foundational truths and that is faith Faith did it salvation is a free gift of God everyone you didn't do anything to earn it not of Works lest any man shall boast none of us can boast in our Salvation none of us can say I earned it I married it I'm doing a pretty good job nope remember you're good at one thing failing we're all good at making mistakes we're all good at messing up the plan of or messing up what God would intend for our lives but oh God rich in mercy God rich and mercy came our way redeemed that attribute out of mud and muck and restores the fellowship let you learn some things sometimes let you go into some Dark Places just to show you I'm still there I never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what a precious promise we have you believe that you actually believe that God promised and said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll always be with you you know what my faith says amen my faith says amen I didn't Merit that I don't deserve that I should have grieved him away and he should have left me and found somebody else way better than me a long time ago everyone but it's election God's election God foreordained me to stand in this hour God foreordained me to come across this message God forordained that that light would strike your life God foreordained the situation God even foreign major problems sometimes just as the vehicle to bring you and Usher you into the very Presence of Jehovah God you look at Jonah my what a bad situation Joan is in backslidden running from God from the carnal mind it looks like it we all know brother Benham said no I was prophets of God can't backside but he was certainly doing his best to get away from what God had purposed him to do so none of us are in this bad of a state brother Benham said he says I look this way whale's belly I look this way whale's belly I'm all tied up in seaweed I'm laying in vomit but what did Jonah do he remembered Solomon prayed a prayer and when Solomon prayed a prayer he said if any of your children be in trouble let them look this way and God would deliver them Jonah in the belly of a whale covered in vomit remembers the promise of God and he went to delivering so then what happened the very vehicle that looked like his destruction was the very vehicle God uses to deliver him to fulfill his purpose so many times we get so upset why this situation why this problem why am I in this don't you realize this could be the very vehicle that God is using to test your faith to turn you back to the promise of God and God will take that vehicle to Usher you right back into fellowship with him I believe that I'm going to be real honest I absolutely believe these things with all my heart my carnal mind doesn't understand it but something down inside of me says that's nothing but the truth God's word can't fail I will fail God can't and I'm resting in that my faith is resting in that my salvation is resting that he did this work me being a part of that elect bride of Jesus Christ I realized I didn't Merit you can't Merit it you ain't figuring your way into this gun guys this is a sovereign Act of God God's Victory not my victory his victory and he is bringing me into his presence I'm not figuring this out I'm not trying to say okay if I make that one and I figured this one and then I do this and then I do that forget about it I have no confidence in myself I have Supreme confidence that this is all God's plan all things were created by Him and for him he said he would have a bride of who's choosing his choosing oh my I'm so glad I didn't go looking for him he came looking for me you did not go look for him he came looking for you you have nothing to boast in you have nothing to be prideful in the goodness and the mercy and the grace of God came your way elected you you saw something why did you see something why do you believe it like why millions and billions of people that are way smarter than you know way more scriptures than you have rejected these things so it's not based upon intellect he says to Peter who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God oh blessed art thou Simon barjona Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven revealed this to you he reveals himself to you you don't figure him out he Reveals His word to you and you by faith if you have faith can say amen that's nothing but the truth and your agreeance and just having faith in God will produce the promise that God has made to you you just believe it you may look at yourself and say I'm not worthy of this correct you've done a proper analysis you are a miserable failure you have done nothing good but God rich in Mercy in order to restore Fellowship play something inside of you that at the right time will say I will put my trust in him not him that willeth nor him that runeth I put my trust in him and you rest the sum of the Christian life is what rest just rest little bride just rest he's going to perform his will just rest just believe don't doubt don't get discouraged just rest it's so important Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he was yesterday he still is today what he is today he will forever be I'm resting in that I'm resting he's never failed I'm resting that never one has one of his promises and one of his words ever failed I'm resting in the fact that he that makes the promise keeps the promise I'm resting in the fact that he started this work in me he'll finish this work in me I'm trusting that he's the author and the finisher of this faith I can't oh foolish Galatians what hath Bewitched you you came out by the hearing of the word of what faith you came out by faith what does hinder you to make you think you can add one inch of your stature by doing or keeping a certain law or doing this or doing that you know what I'm here to do I'm here to restore your faith back in the promises of God this is God's doing not yours everyone I want you to have such enough confidence and faith and saying what is this inside of me that says Amen to the word of God though I can't mechanically put it all together I'm saying amen little sister had he right I'm sure she couldn't mechanically say that happened because of this and that happened because of this no she heard the word and said that ain't nothing but the truth everyone I can't mechanically put all the piece of this together but I know God's restoring fellowship with me and all along the way by God's grace and his Sovereign Grace to me I'm saying that ain't nothing but the truth brother that ain't nothing but the truth sister that is nothing but God's Vindicated word bringing it to pass in my life that's him that's not me that's him not me even looking at Holmes County not even understanding what's going on here we're not trying to do anything it's just like something keeps happening we just keep getting pulled over there and things start happening we're not trying to do anything God rich and mercy is doing something God's doing something you may not even understand why you make the decision to make why do they take this job why did I move here why did this happen God rich and mercy knows exactly what he's doing he's intending to bring you back into Fellowship just don't get discouraged if all you ever see is whale's belly around you just look to the promise look up your redemption's here boy who would have thought you think Jonah was thinking my Redemption it's a whale's belly vomit seaweed wrapped around mine and my this is my Deliverance this is going to take me to the promise so I can fulfill my purpose that God has brought me to this earth how many of us have been that situation we start to question God we start to say Lord surely this is not working hey that why do you think God gets angry sometimes that's why I read that Jeremiah jumped off the page at me don't they know I'm there don't you know the kings in our camp you know God gets angry sometimes it gets angry he gets frustrated he got angry at Moses one time he said why are you crying under me all the time Moses then I give you exactly what you need to fulfill the commission stop crying and complaining all the time go do what I called you to do you've got a Divine Purpose now go do it everything you have need of you got it take it go get out there everything you know oh lord I can't speak or Lord be quiet Moses shut up get going stop it stop looking at all the things you're not start looking at all the things God has already equipped you with him that's the problem with us too carnally minded too carnally minded trying to figure out how to do something or figure out this you know God said not man was never created to shift for himself we were to re totally into completely rely upon God for everything that we have need of in this Earthly Journey oh but oh foolish Galatians what Bewitched you what Bewitched you you know there's a spirit Bewitched his Rebellion to what faith in God's word something bewitches you something pulls you away something tries to pull you away from just simple faith that God will keep his word every promise in the book is for me every promise in the book is for you oh my God I have no idea where I'm at okay let's read a quote and we'll keep on going it is the rising of the sun now the very essence of the message that was sent is this he is risen from the dead and we are his benefactors we who share the resurrection with him and draw benefits from this by providing to the world what uh that he is alive or proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some traditions of man we can only reflect the things that we are pointed to everyone my so I think like a like a mirror would reflect the sun let's just stay in the right position let's just stay before the word let the word do the work let's just can let's just commit ourselves to staying in the presence of the word not being pulled away by the man said he's you let so many things take it away from you you let your job you let your wife you let the cares the world you let this problem you let that brother say this about you you let this and you let that and then all of a sudden he pulls you away and you're no longer reflecting the life of God back to the world in which you're living in you let so many things get up get in the way and block the light so let's just get back into position by God's grace get back into position not let anything pull us away from that position he said I'm afraid that we're getting too many people or we're not getting enough people to Christ we're getting them to a church or we're getting them to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one the only one that has life he that hath the son hath life and if the life of a man that is dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived oh there's the check there's the check there's the mirror now off the same life that he lived is not seen in you then you better see what you're pointing to everyone what are you in line with what are you reflecting if you stay in the presence and the Darkness of this world I promise you you will reflect Darkness to this world but if you stay in the presence of the light you will reflect the life and light of God he says and this is light that he is life that light was his life now if you want to be the light of the world that means the life's going to come into view not just a a correct understanding of a teaching but the literal life of Jesus Christ reflected in me and you the same thing he was I am we are his what benefactors what is this message he is alive how do I know he's expressing his life in me he's expressing his life in you I may not be able to explain everything but by God's grace I'm reflecting something I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but by God's grace I am certainly not what I used to be right brother gay it's not him that willeth or him that runeth God's doing something God's quickening God's calling us up higher God knows just the path he's got to take you on to get you into his very own likeness that's the purpose not that we'll know about him but that will know him we've got to know him everyone that's the purpose turn in your Bibles to John 17. John chapter 17 verse 3. it says and this is life eternal that we might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and oh Father and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was that I find to be my continual prayer Lord glorify me May that perfect attribute that Perfect Image that you had of me before the fall and before the world come back into view again Lord restore me bring into view again that which I was in you before the foundation of the world glorify me Lord bring me back into view the real me cause this ain't me this ain't me I promise you this ain't me anybody that knew me 20 euros knows this is not the same Kyle that used to live and walk and talk and I'm still not what I want to be but something's happening I'm pressing towards the mark of the High Calling of God wherein I once was not pressing now something's pulling me something's guiding me somebody's got a hold of me taking me places I never thought I could go somebody's got a hold of you taking you a place that you never thought or imagined you could possibly we go how could you an unworthy unrighteous individual ever come back into the presence of a holy God oh it's Grace everyone it's Grace like Isaiah when he got caught up into that Temple and here's the holy cherubins and Pharisees and seraphins and they're all saying holy holy holy so much so when they screamed the pillars of the temple would Shake in his presence that's the Holiness of God as soon as he's in the Holiness of God he falls to the ground like a dead man and says I am a man of unclean lips and I'm living amongst a people of unclean lips oh my oh forgive me no he couldn't do that you know what God did God sent an angel and an angel goes and gets a coal from off the Altar and touches them and says this shall cleanse thee what did Isaiah do he just confessed I am unworthy I am filthy I am no good then God went to work and then after that you know what he says and I love it I'm sharing with the kids he's standing there he says now there's work to be done who shall go for us where can we find a man where's somebody that can bring my will into view I just wonder hmm then Isaiah he's like oh hey I'll go send me I'll go now God knew he was going to say that and so many times God just brings things to view and you realize the mercy and grace of God he's waiting for a reaction to the action he's waiting for you to say you know what I'll go Lord if you want me to do that I'll do it you want me to say something to that person I'll say it you you want me to go do that I'll do it not looking at your ability you got none everyone not looking at your great intellectual Concepts you got nothing I've always said the greatest amongst us is a bird brain and the only person that knows anything God had to give it to him if you know anything it was a gift you didn't earn it you didn't Merit it you didn't figure it out God gave it to you how many in here could say I am I I want to glory in the fact that I can see or I can hear you can't God gave you that gift how many people were born with no sight how many people are born with no hearing how many people are born how many people died this morning how many people won't make it through this day I would say God's been good to you now if that's in the carnal realm of things what do you think in the spiritual realm of things did not God rich in Mercy come down and give you spiritual eyes to see where he was in the hour in which we're living We're Not Looking Back to a god that was we're recognizing the present tense I am this is not something to be taken lightly and I think God can get angry sometimes and say do you not see what I'm doing can you stop complaining long enough to recognize I'm there in the boat with you can you not realize I never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you through the end God has a right to get angry sometimes with us he's gotten right to get angry with me at some times he's got that right you imagine a husband every day working every day paying the bills working hard paying all the the light bills electorals and every time the wife comes home I'm upset I'm nervous I'm scared I don't know the light's going to get turned off we're going to have enough food happen one day you say honey stop it happened for three months you say honey it's enough that's enough I will die before I'll let you guys go hungry I will die before I let you be put out of this home I'll work myself to death to see to it that I provide all of your needs now what do you think God you know he's a he's a person it's not some Creed I don't love a Creed everyone I don't love a doctrinal teaching I love a person Jesus Christ his character came into view and I've seen him for what he is I've seen the divine nature of God and I love that person I'm unworthy to even walk with him but I love him and with everything in me I want to walk Closer by his side I just want to be in his presence you ever have that a real spiritual person someone you really love you just want to be with them you don't think you have anything to offer you just still like to be with them that's how it is with God I don't feel I have anything I can do for God I have you know I remember sitting in brother Lonnie's Bible study I was like my goodness forgot more than I'll ever know and you don't say nothing you don't think you could add any value but I sure like going to the Bible studies I like to be with her I like to hear what he was saying I like to hear from that experience I sure did that's a man what about God my goodness you don't think he sits there he says my have you not recognized do you not see is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician have not I given you my word have you ever seen my word fail have you ever seen me fail Through the Bible what did I do for Israel did I not constantly provide for them every day of their life and yet they scoffed and complained murmured against God did not I send them a Vindicated Prophet thoroughly Vindicated him then not I do these things delivered you from all your enemies didn't I do that you know God has a right sometimes I just burned me up he has a right to say hey stop it stop complaining look to the promises of God try me look I love that God says try me test me sometime why don't you see if I'll fail that's God who said that try me you know like any husband you say honey give me that bottle of pickles or that jar of pickles try me I'll open that can you sit there oh boy that is done I've had a couple times like hold on hold on yeah still got it it's the nature of a man right how much more than nature of God oh my he's all power there is no such thing I mean he defines power he defines strength he defines faithfulness he's the definition of all those things you shouldn't look in the Bible and see uh strength that you should see strength is God you should see uh when you look at you know you look into a dictionary and you say oh uh safety well that's God protection that's God or Providence oh no that's God this interpretation is God and this interpretation is God and this interpretation god well you begin to find out he's all of it he's everything he's everything to me is he everything to you that's the question he wants to be your everything not a part of your life your life you know Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the entire mystery of God men and women yielded surrendered and dependent the real sign of maturity helpless dependent upon him for each and every day guiding leading and providing brother banham says in Christ the mystery says first was to express himself completely in the threefold mystery of God and God in Christ secondly to have the preeminances by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could he could have the preeminence to express himself through them thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly positioned that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowshipped with them oh we're going back so many times we put the third portion of that mystery way too far ahead we put it in the Millennium and brother sister I'd like to say I could be wrong sure looks to me like God wants to restore that Fellowship right here and right now go back to Eden what was it back before eating in the cool of the evening God's walking with his children walking with them talking with them asking them questions back in a unity in a fellowship and a Oneness with God communion again where was brother Brandon the last sermon communion back in the presence of God where's the bride going to be in the end back in the presence of God walking with him talking with him in the cool of this evening hour my that's my promise you is that for you I promise this for me everyone I believe these promises and this message was for me I can't I don't Merit it I don't deserve it I fail I make way too many mistakes I still in my heart believe it's for me still believe that I do believe that with everything and brother band's preaches in 1961 the basis of Fellowship he said we find the first thing that he tried to do was he tried to cover himself with fig leaves do you see to make himself now religion is your covering we know that that is what it is it's a covering the first thing he tried to do was to cover himself you see he took some aprons from a fig leaf and he found he found out that that would not work in the presence of God God condemned The Works of his hands he just wouldn't do it he tried to build a tower so he could go and get way up out of the way of the floods and out of Destruction and find his way back on this Tower and babble back to God but God condemned it then God confused their languages and then the tower dropped and every time that man tries to make his own way he fails after he lost his fellowship with God he became a Wanderer had to shift for himself God had taken care of him before but now now he finds that he has to shift for himself and it's a pretty hard thing so he doesn't have a a loving father to watch over him or to protect him or to guide him or to direct him or to feed him or to clothe him and to care for him like he did so instead of coming back he tries to find his own way he wants to make his own way back man wants to make his own way back that's how he's always been wow now you see what are you fighting against your own religiousness your own desire to restore yourself or do something add something to the plan of God add something to try to bring past his will for your life rather than have faith in God and trust that he'll guide you he'll feed you he'll lead you he'll be with you he'll do it all everyone that's the promise you read it and I read it you'll do it all why are we always shifting why do we get nervous why do we allow fear and worry and doubt take us away from faith in God's word don't you realize the spirit of the age is just trying to get you to not have faith in God's word God is his word man shall not live by bread alone by whatever word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God have faith in God the very Foundation of this journey towards his presence have faith that God will keep his word God hiding himself in Simplicity 1963 so it pleases God to reveal himself and then to hide himself and hid himself and then reveal himself in the little things it just goes right over the head of man and you'd say why would a god do that is because that man was made up in the beginning to not shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're likened unto Lambs or sheeps sheep cannot lead themselves he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us so man is made that way and God made all of his work so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple so simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple you ever felt so good to be simple you ever felt so good to not be sufficient never felt so good my God went to Great Lengths so that he could get to you made it so simple that's what I love about that brother we baptize he's simple he just said oh that's what the Bible said oh Pastor why aren't you baptizing me according to the Bible he's not some great intellect he saw the light he walked in the light and now God will lead him into the next step stop trying to shift for ourselves everyone the bride is not to shift for herself the bride should not be shifting she shouldn't be trying to figure anything out she should have faith in God and realize the same God that starts this finishes this the same God that lit up my path 15 years ago is going to light up the path for me tomorrow and then the next day and then the next day and then the next day he's going to not give brother bam said in the Masterpiece he said God does not give you so much light that you can see the beginning from the end you do not see the whole picture of God I promise you you're not seeing everything because that would be counteractive to his nature and his purpose for Fellowship god brother Byron says God gives you just enough light like a lantern in your hand to light up The Path before you so you can take a step in the Darkness that's God that's his nature that's his character that's the person you know why he wants to be your guide he wants to be your guide you can't take that attribute away from him that attribute is a part of God just as God is love God is faith God is a guide God is a father God is a heavenly father and the leader of his church a holy ghost filled and led body of Believers not resting in their ability resting in his ability not having faith and confidence in what they can do or what they can figure out but faith and confidence that God will perform exactly what he said he would do that's the Church of the Living God it always has been you tell me this Hebrew children those three Hebrew children down there in Babylon they say oh my hey we're going to heat up this furnace seven times hotter than it's ever been you think they sat there and said okay so this is what God's going to do so we're going to get really close everybody behind us is going to die of the Heat and when we get in there God's going to come down nope they didn't know they didn't know because they had to fulfill the scriptures that's part of me everyone that furnace was heated up seven times hotter this layout to see an age is worse than it's ever been the filthy rot and nasty Demons of Darkness that around you every day and every night there to destroy you it's here everyone you have arrived but he had three faithful children they said no matter what we inbound the knee no way I don't know how God's going to do this I don't know what he's going to do but I'm not bowing the knee and if this is the place that I die you'll know that I died having faith in God and when they had faith in God an angel goes I think Gabriel or something goes to God says Hey God you know what's going on down there right I just want to make sure it's getting pretty pretty close you've been watching this he said don't worry sit down worm would come sometimes Lord have you have you been seen what's happening I just want to remind you I know you're busy I know you got a lot going on you might not have noticed you've got really you got three faithful Hebrew or three uh faithful Hebrew children down there and they're going to burn them up uh that's sit down warm one sit down this I go myself now I've seen the faithfulness of my children God was testing his bride for without faith it's impossible to please him you cannot please him with faith and you cannot have faith if you have a complete perfect understanding of what God's going to do at all times you have to have faith you have just enough Faith to take that next step so God rich in Mercy right when it looked like it was their destruction they could not they this is it this is it we're not bowing the knee but we're gonna have faith in God came down how many times could Jews testify in your own Earthly Journey thus far God came down you know it okay now that's what he was but is that what he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God rich in Mercy can't change his character can't change his nature to the same one that came and delivered you there he'll deliver you tomorrow he'll deliver you next year he'll deliver you every day of your life every moment of every hour of every second of your life he'll be there just call him on the scene just have faith in his word knowing he's there he promised he'd be there I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I think God is trying to awaken you to his presence I think God's awakening us all to the reality that he's here even if he has to scold you scold me say stop it I'm here was this not my promise did not I say I would be there did I ever say I would let you go into this alone no that's what gives us such a faith and love and confidence in him he promised he would do these things for me now brother Branham says again in the basis of fellow she said no God laid down the program in the Garden of Eden and he condemned man's work of his hands to begin with as soon as man made his first mistake he tried to find his way back through a fig Leaf religion to get back again and God condemned it and what did he do he killed some animals and he got some sheepskins and I believe it it was I believe that's what it was so it shows through that it takes the blood has always been God's program and it always will be God's program God in the beginning she laid out the program and the only way for Fellowship back with God and with one another is through the blood of Jesus Christ his son he's killing the lamb or the sheep and he and the sheepskin something had to die for us you can't organize it you can't educate it you can't scientifically figure it out you have to accept it upon the basis of faith that something has died for you and that brings Fellowship amen that brings Fellowship you know we're living in an hour right now where AI heard of AI artificial intelligence brother Brandon preaches in the countdown he said you can look at science and see where the church is okay what is science trying to do through there they're building another Tower if you hadn't noticed they're building another place to not have to come into the judgments of God they're trying to extend their life they're trying to actually become so smart they could take their Consciousness and they think you're just made up of memory thoughts and things of that nature they're trying to escape the judgments of God just as they were doing back there in the Tower of Babel they're doing it again everyone and they're connecting with an artificial intelligence to make them smarter to try to make them live longer try to even make it to a point there they wouldn't have to die if you go look into this I have so it's very interesting so what are they trying to do they're trying to avoid the judgments of God through science and education they think they can bypass the plan or the headed destruction that they know this world is headed in but news flash for you that was only showing you where the church is there's another artificial intelligence here to lead the bride and it's not the intelligence of her own mind it's the very mind of Christ and the leadership of the Holy Ghost to guide you to lead you unto all righteousness he's foreordained a planned and the works that you should walk in and the Holy Spirit the little Dove was only looking for what everyone Lambs Lambs he was looking for a lamb because the dove can only lead a lamb that's the only thing he can lead that's the only nature that a dove can rest upon is the Lamb and I remember in in the Bible in Revelation he says behold the lamb and what the Lamb's wife so what nature are we going to see displayed right now it's going to be the aggression the fight we got it figured out we know what to do watch out forget it just forget it where's the lamb because only the lamb can take the book only the lamb can loose the seals Revelations 10 verse 8 John takes the book John eats the book and then John through his life Thunders out the complete mystery of God as he walks it out in everyday dependence upon God Enoch just walked with God and what did he do he brought back into view God's mystery Secret preeminances in a man just walking in the revelation of the word as God showed him he walked in it and God showed him the next day he walked in it he didn't show him the end from the beginning but he showed him just enough what he needed to see to keep walking with him you know God knows how to keep you right by his side I think that's what he wanted you know if you're uh if there's only one light and you and your wife are walking through the woods you walk real close to each other if you know there's Cliffs on all sides you'll walk right beside your wife or whoever's got the light so you can walk right with him maybe God rich in Mercy and his grace to restore Fellowship he's going to make it in such a way we have to get real close to him it's getting dangerous everyone there's traps and potholes everywhere it's getting really rough the lights just shining I'm gonna have to get real close so I don't miss step or fall off the cliff here God knows exactly what to do to restore Fellowship because that's his desire turn in your Bibles to Second Peter second Peter chapter one wow you know I'm on page 3 of 12. that's a paradox everyone I'm usually the guy that has maybe two scriptures maybe two quotes there's no way we'll get through it um yeah so second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. it says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and to Virtue whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these he might be a partaker of what the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust I would say that God's Great purpose was this Fellowship in you and I would say that the mystery plan of God was to see himself in his children the very divine nature of God expressed in you not the knowledge per se in the form of teachings but the knowledge of God who expresses himself as the person of the word in you I have heard but now I see many of us have heard the word but now I'm wondering do we see it do we see it in US it's got to go from something I understand or something I can conceptualize or something I could even explain to somebody else it's got to go from thought to word to word to life that's the great condescension of God when God came down and found the preeminances in a man now it's got to find the same path of preeminence is in the bride it goes from the thought to the word to the word to the life and I'm resting in that and my faith is built upon that and that's what I want to be a partaker of how many of you want to be a partaker of I want the part I want to partake of the divine nature I want the divine nature see when I understand his nature then things change there's many things that's so interesting to me that now we couldn't find an exact scripture of it but because we're understanding the divine nature of God we can say this is that or this is that or that doesn't match his divine nature and character it's very interesting next let's slide here first John 1 5. and this is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and we walk in darkness we lie and we do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin I think God wanted to go on a journey with us I think even in the life that we have even in the mistakes that we make even in the disappointments that we would disappoint our heavenly father in I think he wanted us to learn something I think he wanted us to understand him as one who would restore us I think he wanted us to understand that he was he was our great strength there's such a walking you see that walking in the light and then that's where brother Branham says in the Masterpiece he did not give us so much light that we see the beginning from the end he shows us so much light that we have to walk with him that was his desire that was his basis of Fellowship we have to have fellowship with him how do we have fellowship with him we must walk in the light each and every day as he is in the light so that those two lives a husband and wife can come back in unison again and continue this journey back into the garden back where there is no more fig Leaf religion covering ourselves with good works forget about it it's a waste of time it's filthy righteousness your righteousness is of filthy rags in the presence of God Abraham made a lot of mistakes but it was an imputed righteousness to Abraham because he had faith and confidence that the promise that God make you would keep his promises how many are the children of God now I don't say that so that you go out and do whatever you want because if you do whatever you want and sin willfully then you prove something's wrong everybody there should be enough a love of God in your heart you wouldn't want to disappoint them you have such a love for his character and of his nature and the more you understand of him it motivates you to be Desiring to walk with him and do the things that you know make him happy it's not a fear-based religion this is not fear-based this is love based everything because remember God wants to be loved brother bam said it God wants to be loved so there you got to bring all this into view this is a big objective God wants to be loved and if I force love it's not love if I force you to do anything you're not doing it because you love me you're doing it because you're afraid of me you're afraid of what I will do if you don't do it any husband and wife if you told your wife if you don't do these things I will put you away in divorcement then you have to question every motive and every objective and everything that she does from that point on now take that back into view you could do all the right things you could do every code every conduct keep every law do it off but for the wrong reason and it missed the point it missed the mark that wasn't the objective you missed the divine nature of God that wasn't his divine nature then you can do all the right things you can make all the right decisions and you're doing it because you love the Lord you're doing it because you want to walk with him you're doing it because you want to have fellowship with him and the Very thought of anything that would grieve his presence from you just destroys you and then you do do something wrong because we all do we all make mistakes brother bam said when we make big ones like getting angry at the neighbor you know and stuff like that we make big mistakes but then there's something to restore that Fellowship again there's something that's so longs to have that nature and that Spirit next to me leading me and guiding me that lamb like nature wants that Dove there with him at all times everyone that's just what the lamb wants the Lamb's defenseless a lamb cannot lead itself aren't you happy to be the Lambs of God how how anybody raise Lambs and are lambs smart you ever go to the fairgrounds they're pretty dumb they're not real smart they're not we're Lambs we're not smart we're not great we're not got strong defenses we don't have great abilities to defend ourselves nope we just trust the guide that's the bride she just trusts the guide the guide says that okay I'm just standing behind him you imagine a wife you know a wife walking through somewhere that they don't understand what does she do the husband takes her hand says all right hold on we're gonna cut right through this she gets behind her husband she just stands right behind him keeps all impressing too now what would the husband feel like if the wife gets in front of the houses now I got this hold on tight I'm cutting us a path right brother Gabe your wife says get behind me brother Gabe and get us through to the end whoa imagine he said no way stop that sometimes we see the attitude amongst the bride that's not a feminist attitude that's not a bride-like nature I'm not strong in my own ability I'm resting in his ability he goes before me David said I always put the word before me I just keep him before me that I should not sin against thee but go keep going okay all right all right we'll keep going uh brother Brown says in 1959 in reaction to an action and you must be sure that you're born of the spirit of God and that you have the Holy Spirit and that the promises of God are all yours and you don't care what the devil does and you can rest assured that Faith takes in its unmovable stand Faith rests upon not upon the shifting Sands of man's theologies but it takes its solemn stand on the Rock of Ages that immovable that rest and that Assurance that's God's word amen faith cannot rest on the shifting Sands of a man's ideas don't have confidence in me I'm a man I'll make mistakes but you have confidence in God have confidence in his word how many of us get are getting smarter as men we're learning things we all do we all have to go back and repent and say man I didn't have that right I had that wrong I I was because we're men we make big mistakes we're learning we're growing we're understanding more of God As we walk with him an older person you could I love talking I like old people I like young people sometimes too but I like I like older people because they've been there they've walked with God they've learned things about God they're calm they're settled sometimes a young person they might be more zealous and ego is like they could do it they're strong sometimes God just has to take them to the place of weakness so that they'll actually understand it's not me it's just God it's just I'm resting in his strength and not in my strength oh but I've been in that before I I think I can do it then I fail miserably I realize I can't do it and all of us have been there we think we can do it and then we fail men certainly realize we can't do it can't do it and then he says okay take my hand I'll be your guide I love that about him my faith is resting on his promises not my ability Fellowship brother bam says now A man was born to have Fellowship man in the beginning back in the beginning when we had a wonderful Fellowship God would come down and have fellowship with his man and this woman every evening and the cool of evening God would come down under the big palm trees and perhaps his sacred light and it was shining all around Adam and Eve and that great big Cathedral there fellowshipping with God had nothing to worry about as long as they were there fellowshipping with God now when God was fellowshipping with Adam in the garden Adam had nothing to worry about everything was smooth and everything was right he didn't have to worry about his clothes he didn't have to worry about what he ate he didn't have to worry about getting sick he didn't have to worry about death he didn't have to worry about sorrow he knew nothing about those things just had a freedom like a little child he had a heavenly father who was watching over him and his Fellowship was with him daily he wouldn't be a marvelous thing if we could just get back to that again and do you know that every redeemed soul today that that's living under their privileges of that kind of a fellowship with God do you know do you know that do you believe that God will take care and provide of everything that you have need of in this Earthly journey and and and and and then at the end of the close of our old Mortal Tabernacle God has promised us to then provide us another one he's just saying hey I'm here I'm providing everything I'm doing everything for you there's nothing to worry about and that's the kind of Fellowship that he's promised to restore for me and you no more shifting no more scared no more worry no more afraid no more fear no more doubt God's in the presence of his people this is what he promised he would do let's see Wow way too many notes now I'm nervous way too many notes can I pull up some stories before you to show he's the same yesterday today and forever let's look at David Psalms or Samuel first Samuel 17 44. let's look at him because what he was he still is what he is he will forever be first Samuel 17 44 and the Philistine said to David come to me you come to me or you come to me and I'll give you this thy flesh unto the fowls of the air into the beasts of the field then David said to the Philistine thou cometh to me with the sword and with the spear and with the shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts and the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and I will take thine head from thee and I will give the carcass to the host of the Philistines this day and unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast of the earth and that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword and a spear for the battle is the Lord's he will give you into our hands amen the battle's the Lords it's not him that willeth nor him that is running now this is his victory this is what I'm resting in and just to think about it when brother Branham said there he said Saul seeing him he tried to he said oh you're not ready to meet this giant he said let me give you some of my teaching let me give you some of my theology he said no that ecclesiastical best couldn't fit this man of God he said let me go just the way I met God he had faith that God would deliver him and when he threw it all off he had faith in God now his confidence wasn't in his sword or his spear or his well you would say breastplate and all this that Saul had nope his faith was in the word and when he had complete confidence and faith in the word then God took control of that man and God guided that stone and God knocked that thing down and then God and strengthened him to pick up that sword and cut off his head David had faith in God that's what God was looking for not great big strong intellectual Giants little Ruddy fellas that had faith in God rugged faith that God would keep his word that's what he wanted can I bring up shamgar I love shamgar only the prophet of God could make us love shamgar so very very much and to think about it here it goes Trump Trump trump right after the Harvest right after all that effort here comes 600 armed Philistines to take everything that he had I seen him look down he looked over at his little wife with ragged sleeves about naked he looked at his little children they were completely pale starved to death now these big old husky Philistines come in there and take what he had got and they would starve in the winter it's about like the little church today brother pale anemic what we need is the courage to take God at his word and stand out there and let the old robbers come up and run them away now sham guard said now looky here I know I am not a warrior and I can't fight and there are 600 men and that what am I going to do I can see him pacing back and forth he didn't know what to do coming closer Trump trump a few minutes and all his oats would be gone his wheat his corn everything gone that he had laid up for and his family was starve everything he had done would be taken away in the big taken over to the enemy country over there giving away to the enemy then the first thing you know God began to move on him like that it began to get angry my he looked around he thought I am an Israelite I am circumcised that's the uncircumcised Philistine coming up there I'm not a soldier and I ain't got time to get out here and take some lessons or learn how to duel or how to fight but I tell you God is my God so he just reached up there grabbed an old Ox goad you know what an ox goat is a little thing with a brass knob on it you beat the cattle from the Corral he reached up there got the ox go didn't have time to train he wasn't some kind of a fighter the emergency was at hand and he had to do it the brother and brother we ain't got time for all these schooling and all these other things and teach it this way and then teach it that way the time is at hand arise take what God has given you and let's go men and women are dying everywhere he grab that Ox go and he jumped out there and he slew 600 Philistines Hallelujah why he had the courage to trust God and to step out there not till I learn to go off and to learn how to do it oh my God is my teacher Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will back up his word every time amen God will back up his word every time and I began to think about it's like legitimately I would never stand in this Pulpit if I would for one second stop and say do I understand everything I would never come here I would never do it I would never be able to stand the criticism and the reproach and the rejection I don't have that in me to do it but I have confidence that God keeps his word I have confidence that this is his chosen method that he takes the fullness foolishness of a preacher who makes mistakes who doesn't have a complete understanding of the picture and he anoints the man to say just the right word at the right time in the presence of the right person that can just say Amen a little how do you write just that's the truth and then God brings to past the promises that she never thought possible could be happening in her life that's God's promise and brother banham said he said so I just come out here I do the best I can and I trust that God takes the stones hits the right spots at the right time just knows what he's doing that's my confidence that's my faith and brother banham said he said you know what if you're a preacher go preach the man said one time to me he said shall we go learn all the the doctrines of the Creeds the Greeks and they said no no no no he said your candle will be half burned out by the time you get out there he said go take what's in your hand and go do something and then brother Brian said if you can't preach sing a song and if you can't sing like brother Isaiah whistle him Brother Band said just whistle to him he said do something do something if you can't sing that's fine you can't hum that's okay smile just be happy brother Branham said conduct yourself with joy in the midst of the trials that what he sees fit to bring your way and what are those trials he uses them like bits in a horse's mouth just to guide you right back into his presence again for Fellowship my goodness everyone we are the happiest people on Earth because we have faith in God we're not looking at whale's belly we're not looking at circumstances we're not looking at seaweed and vomit we're looking at a promise I will trust in thee Thy word will never fail you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me his promises are yea and amen turn in the Bible if you don't mind well you don't have to it's one verse Luke 4 4 and Jesus answered saying unto him man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Romans 9 16 it's not him that willeth or him that runeth it's God that showeth you Mercy and we realize that in Philippians I want you to turn to Philippians chapters 3 verse 4. Philippians 3 chapter or chapter 3 verse 4. I want to bring into view Paul for a second a man if any man had confidence or ought to have confidence it was Paul Paul should have confidence Paul had a complete revelation of the mystery of Christ and Paul if there was one man that could boast if one man that could stand with the shoulders back and say he has the he has the ability to make it this was Paul but look at the attitude of Paul in the scripture that's not the attitude that's not the divine nature attitude of God look at his nature he says though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I am more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is of the law blameless but what things were gained to me I have counted loss for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but don't that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if listen to this if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead did you think Paul would drop that in there if if I might Attain he realized he's resting in Christ not his ability Christ not my ability You're Not Strong we're not strong people we're not great people we just serve a great God we serve a great powerful Mighty Everlasting nobody to be compared to it you should just tell people how great God is just keep bragging on him I keep bragging on him I like it when my wife brags on me God certainly likes it when his wife brags on him because he's worthy to be bragged upon he's worthy to say there's no one like him the more I see about him his character comes into view there's no one like him no one like him then it's real easy to tell people about him because then you're just bragging on Christ just bragging upon the Everlasting presence of Jesus Christ amongst his people that's his promise not as though I have already attained either were already perfect but I'm following after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth to those things which are before I press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Paul never lost that attitude to reach out to apprehend the thing that apprehended him I don't think we ought to either let's not be too confident let's not be too proud let's not become arrogant let's become humble become little see how little you can be remember if you'll obey yourself God will exalt thee in due time will you stand with me musicians will you come I hope that wasn't too hard I'm sorry something just there in the beginning you get to wondering um yeah we serve a great God we serving Almighty omniscient God he provided everything that I had need of for this Earthly journey and my big mistake was when I thought I could do it on my own that's our big mistakes that we've made when we get overconfident you know Samson got a little overconfident there was a woman that came in one day and flattered him told him how great he was ooh you know he wasn't quite used to that attention he said you know what I am pretty great yeah you know I am see what the devil was up to tempting him yeah I'm a powerful being yeah I did do that to those Philistines look at me what he forgot where his strength came from bride don't forget where your strength comes from it ain't you it ain't you God sure knows how to make sure you realize it's not you at times he's certainly good at that but it's gone when that woman came in and started flattering him making him feel real special making him think it was him boy what did he do he got him separated from those Seven Locks which what were they brother Benham said that was the Covenant of God's word he separated him from the word and there his strength went away the devil slick is a subtle enemy he's very slick remember wherever the spirit of God is the Antichrist spirit's really close brother Branham said those trees branches were intertwined in the garden my they're close I always thought that with brother Brown's telling brother Jeremy I'd look at brother Brown brother bams get to ask the question she says brother Benham could you be Christ he says now sister in one way that's absolutely the truth but in another way you make me an antichrist bride be careful just be real careful in one way you are the very righteousness and display of God but be careful in another way you could become Antichrist I know that's hard I know that's a strong statement but you have to understand the Spirit by which I'm saying it remember our help and our strength Cometh From The Lord my hopes are built on nothing less than Jesus words of righteousness all other ground is sinking sand I can't put my faith in any place else but his word sing us that song brother my hopes are built a solid rock I hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness [Music] this is [Music] [Music] changing Grace [Applause] [Music] other ground taking [Music] all other kisses [Music] well [Music] far when all around my soul gives way he that is [Music] this season [Music] when he shall come with Trump is let him be found dressed in his righteousness [Music] [Music] of all other Brown [Music] sinking sand oh another round this is just power heads for a word of Prayer [Music] Heavenly Father we come before you now even myself I'm convicted even myself father I realized I put too much confidence in myself at times father I just first asked for forgiveness myself personally Lord forgive us as an assembly forgive us as a people forgive us Lord for the subtlety of the enemy Lord that would come in and try to exalt ourselves above our measure forgive us father Lord for not having faith and confidence in your promised word Lord I pray that you would help us Lord I pray that you'd help me pray Lord that you would take our hands and I pray Lord that you would help me to firmly stand behind thee and not in front of Thee Lord lead us and guide us that's my prayer Lord search our hearts as individuals father we are individuals standing before you Lord you know every secret chamber you know every hidden thing you know every motive and every objective why we do what we do father your word said you would cut like a two-edged sword even to the dividing of asunder between the spirit and the soul Lord I believe that word has cut I believe it went way down deep sometimes Discerning between what's ought to be there and what's not Lord I just pray that you would help us as individuals Lord we want to say we're thankful thank you Lord thank you for what you've started in us thank you for your grace thank you for your free gift of Salvation not of Works lest any man should boast thank you for Faith father in our hearts to believe you thank you Lord for shining the light before our path thank you Lord that you keep the light not showing the whole path thank you Lord for just the step right in front of us Lord we know you're holding that Lantern in your hand and Lord we want to just walk real close to you father wherever that light wherever that path leads we just want to be found walking with you father so Lord God may you become our everything no longer a part of our life but our life Lord whatever hindrances and whatever things that are trying to take us away from the reality of what you're trying to get across to your church pray Lord that you would remove it Lord I pray as we as individuals sometimes your prophet of God said you're there and then you'll hide and then you'll come back and then you'll hide again like in Song of Solomon knocking at the door and then the bride running out and can't find her where'd he go what's going on Lord I believe you want to be pursued I believe you want a bride that comes after after you so Lord God if We've ran after the things of the world that cares of this world or something like a fig Leaf religion forgive us father Lord we want to walk with you you are our righteousness Lord the word is our clothing and it's an imputed righteousness not earned Lord it was your grace father forgive us if we should be that which is O foolish Galatians forgive us Lord we came out by the hearing of Faith Lord in this journey we'll continue this journey by faith in your word Lord if we build our house upon sand shifting Sands of man's ideas forgive us Lord may we find ourselves re-establishing our lives upon the solid Bedrock of your word each and every day Lord resting upon your promises Lord we love you we commit ourselves to you help us Lord in this journey help us to fulfill our purpose in being here upon this Earth and Lord help us to do all that we can Lord with the strength that we have and the little faith that we have to point others
