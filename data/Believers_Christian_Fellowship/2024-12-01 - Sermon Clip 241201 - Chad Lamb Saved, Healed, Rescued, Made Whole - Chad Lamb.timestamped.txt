[0:00] now I find myself in this last days with
[0:02] the many of the believing Christians
[0:05] identified in his ministry he is the
[0:07] same yesterday today and forever I find
[0:09] myself in this day identified in his
[0:12] ministry do you find yourself that way
[0:15] believing it walking in it amen notice
[0:18] the works that he did he said the
[0:19] believer would do the same thing the
[0:21] works that I do shall you do also then
[0:23] can you be identified with him then when
[0:25] the reproach comes on the word Can You
[0:28] Stand The reproach like he did see
[0:30] identified with him I was identified
[0:33] with him brother BR goes on and he goes
[0:36] example after example and and listen you
[0:38] you you you read these things and what
[0:40] what is he saying it sounds so extreme
[0:42] but the reality is if I am part of God I
[0:46] am part of God and wherever God was I
[0:48] was there too because I have
[0:50] representation there because what God is
[0:53] amen and what I am are not two separate
[0:55] things I'm certainly not fullness but a
[0:57] little measure is still part of God
[1:00] part of Jesus Christ part of the word to
[1:02] be the bride you have to be part of the
[1:05] word and wherever the word was you had
[1:07] part in
[1:09] that and this message came to break our
[1:12] spiritual Amnesia to recognize where you
[1:14] can say I was with the Hebrew
[1:17] Chen I was with the Hebrew children in
[1:19] the fiery furnace how I don't have
[1:22] conscience of it I didn't see anything I
[1:24] can't describe it to you but whatever is
[1:26] alive in me now was there whatever power
[1:29] is working and me was there rescuing
[1:31] them bringing through because it was the
[1:33] fourth man it was
[1:35] Christ and if you're part of Christ and
[1:37] Christ is you and you're in Christ then
[1:39] you were there why because whatever was
[1:42] there is in
[1:44] [Music]
[1:46] you amen Were You There When the sons of
[1:49] God shot her for Joy I don't remember it
[1:51] I don't have consciousness of it I can't
[1:53] describe it to you but something inside
[1:55] of me jumps up and down and says amen
[1:57] when I hear the prophet say that
[2:00] why because brother bham said they were
[2:02] shouting for Joy when he showed them his
[2:04] Plan of Redemption and we're in the day
[2:06] when he's taken the veil off his Plan of
[2:08] Redemption and I'm shouting for Joy
[2:10] today at the same thing I shouted for
[2:12] joy in that day if I can rejoice in the
[2:15] opening of the seals the peeling back of
[2:17] the entire mystery of redemption and
[2:19] shout and clap my hands then I certainly
[2:21] can believe I did it there when I was
[2:23] with him
[2:26] there he said to be a true Christian you
[2:29] you have to identify yourself
[2:32] there you see that's a pretty big
[2:35] leap it's a leap that only faith can
[2:39] make human mind can't make that leap
[2:42] it's impossible
