[15:27] Francis for uh Friday Saturday and
[15:30] Sunday so be prepared to flip your
[15:33] calendar from May to June real fast cuz
[15:35] may is going to breeze on by but uh
[15:37] there's a lot happening and I'm excited
[15:39] about it all and so I just wanted to uh
[15:42] keep reminding us of those things so we
[15:43] don't lose track of those and ask you to
[15:46] be in prayer for all of that and so we
[15:48] look forward to iten let's all
[15:51] stand and uh let's turn to the book of
[15:54] Ephesians
[15:57] together I want to welcome welome all
[15:59] our visitors and I see sister Carolyn
[16:02] Kai's parents back there God bless you
[16:04] it's good to have you both with us again
[16:06] amen and anybody else who visiting God
[16:08] bless you let's look at Ephesians
[16:10] chapter
[16:15] 5 Ephesians chapter
[16:19] 5 verse
[16:22] 30 for we are members of his body of his
[16:25] flesh and of his bones for this cause
[16:28] shall a man leave his father and mother
[16:30] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[16:32] they too shall be one flesh this is a
[16:35] great mystery but I speak concerning
[16:37] Christ and the church man God bless you
[16:40] may you may have your seats may the Lord
[16:42] bless us as we look into his word and
[16:45] may he give us eyes of understanding
[16:48] amen amen I'm going to continue on with
[16:51] the thought I had from a little while
[16:52] ago on the Lamb's wife this will be the
[16:54] Lamb's Wife Part Two it's quite a a bit
[16:57] of a different direction than we were in
[16:59] before but these things have been on my
[17:00] heart actually for several months and
[17:03] I've just been waiting for God to kind
[17:05] of give the right inspiration where I
[17:07] felt comfortable preaching on it and so
[17:09] God started dealing with me a lot this
[17:11] week and and so I want to just do a
[17:13] quick review uh of last time and we went
[17:17] to the uh quote on choosing of a bride
[17:19] it says again the kind of woman that a
[17:21] man would choose will reflect his
[17:23] Ambitions and his character if a man
[17:25] chooses the wrong woman it reflects his
[17:27] character and what he ties himself to
[17:29] shows truly what's in him a woman
[17:32] reflects what's in the man when he
[17:33] chooses her for wife it shows what's
[17:36] down in him no matter what he says
[17:38] outside watch what he married so we see
[17:40] that works in the natural but also
[17:42] that's working spiritually because God
[17:44] is going to choose a bride that's going
[17:46] to reflect his very nature amen and many
[17:49] of us look at that and say well why
[17:50] would he choose me and how could he
[17:52] choose me I've got all these bad
[17:53] characteristics but he's not choosing
[17:55] you based off your genetics necessarily
[17:57] he's choosing you based off a seed
[17:59] that's down inside and he knows the
[18:01] potential that's laying inside each one
[18:03] of us and the potential is there to
[18:05] reflect his very life because it is his
[18:08] life that's trapped
[18:09] inside further down in the same message
[18:12] he said but you know you have to plan
[18:14] look Pray when you're choosing for we
[18:16] see by this the Word of Promise she the
[18:19] bride that a man would choose is going
[18:20] to reflect his character it reflects
[18:23] what's in him a little further down he
[18:25] says now then when we change back now
[18:28] for a moment to the spiritual side when
[18:30] you see a church that's in the world
[18:31] acts like the world participates in the
[18:33] world partaking of the world counting
[18:35] God's Commandments as if they never had
[18:37] wrote them then you can just imagine
[18:40] Christ ain't going to take a bride like
[18:41] that could you imagine taking the modern
[18:44] church today for a bride not my Lord uh
[18:47] I could hardly see that no remember now
[18:49] a man and his wife are one and so that's
[18:52] what we want to look at that's what we
[18:53] started looking at last time is is is
[18:56] Christ and his bride are one and if
[18:58] Christ is a lamb he can only marry a
[19:00] lamb he couldn't marry anything else a
[19:03] lamb must marry a lamb so this bride
[19:05] must become a lamb praise God let's turn
[19:08] to Romans chapter 8
[19:25] together Romans chapter 8
[19:29] in verse
[19:32] 29 for whom he did for for whom he did
[19:35] for know he also did predestinate to be
[19:37] conformed to the image of his son that
[19:39] he might be the firstborn among many
[19:41] Brethren so God by predestination knew
[19:44] the bride that he would choose and he's
[19:46] predestinated us amen he's predestinated
[19:49] us unto the adoption of children by
[19:50] Jesus Christ and he's also predestinated
[19:52] us to be conformed to His Image praise
[19:55] God how many are you thankful that he
[19:57] decided before the foundation of the
[19:59] world that we would be conformed to his
[20:00] image and that he predestinated us unto
[20:03] adoption because if it was left to us
[20:05] there's no way we would ever have made
[20:06] it we couldn't have made it we were
[20:08] doomed to fail from the from our birth
[20:10] cuz our birth came wrong we were wrong
[20:13] with the wrong nature with the wrong
[20:14] desires Born In the Flesh amen we were
[20:17] in enmity with God our minds were
[20:18] alienated from the things of God we had
[20:20] a darken mind amen we come hating the
[20:22] things of God but God had a seed planted
[20:25] down inside of us and he knew how to
[20:27] bring the light in the right seed season
[20:28] to Quicken that seed because there's
[20:30] where for predestination is that's what
[20:33] his for knowledge was knowing where that
[20:35] seed would land and the potentials that
[20:37] are in that seed and he knew what seed
[20:39] we had for what day we lived in so we
[20:42] may feel totally inadequate to face the
[20:44] challenges of the day but the adequacy
[20:46] is not in your mind the adequacy is not
[20:48] in your willpower the adequacy is in the
[20:50] seed that lays down inside of you
[20:52] because he knew what seed would come
[20:53] forth in what hour so we got to quit we
[20:57] got to quit looking at at ourselves and
[20:59] saying I can't that that that's true
[21:02] absolutely we can't amen but With God
[21:05] all things are
[21:06] possible he said I am the vine you are
[21:09] the branches if you IDE in me amen so
[21:13] he's going to bear fruit from what
[21:15] because we're connected to the vine the
[21:17] Vine's bringing life through the
[21:18] branches and bearing the fruit he's not
[21:20] asking the branches to do it all on
[21:22] their own he's only asking the branches
[21:24] to stay connected to the
[21:26] vine praise God
[21:29] amen so now all the potential lays in
[21:32] the seat and he's going to have a wife
[21:34] and that wife is going to come to
[21:36] manifestation in the end time and she is
[21:38] coming into manifestation amen she's
[21:40] already standing on her feet she's
[21:42] maturing into what into the very image
[21:45] of the
[21:46] Lamb it'll be Mr and Mrs
[21:49] lamb praise
[21:52] God Amen let's go to Ecclesiastes
[21:55] chapter 3 this is where I'm going to
[21:57] take a little turn and a little
[21:59] deviation so that that is our
[22:03] review review's over amen Now we move
[22:07] forward and like I said I'm going to if
[22:09] if you'll just bear with me it's Sunday
[22:11] morning we got a little bit of time and
[22:13] I don't say that to strike fear and
[22:14] Terror into everyone's heart but I want
[22:17] us to relax cuz I'm going to go around
[22:19] the cowshed so if you'll let me go
[22:21] around the cowshed to get to my point
[22:23] let's just stay on the journey together
[22:25] and let's enjoy it together amen I think
[22:27] it's a little Cal shed so I think we'll
[22:30] be okay Ecclesiastes
[22:33] 3 verse
[22:36] 1 to everything there is a season and a
[22:39] time to every purpose under the heaven a
[22:43] time to be born and a time to die a time
[22:45] to plant and a time to pluck up that
[22:47] which is planted A Time to Kill and a
[22:49] time to heal a time to break down and a
[22:52] time to build up a time to weep and a
[22:55] time to laugh a time to mourn and a time
[22:58] uh and a time to dance a time to Cast
[23:01] Away stones and a time to gather Stones
[23:03] together a time to embrace and a time to
[23:06] refrain from embracing a time to get and
[23:09] a time to lose a time to keep and a time
[23:12] to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time
[23:15] to swow a time to keep silent and a time
[23:18] to speak a time to love and a time to
[23:21] hate a time of war and a time of
[23:25] Peace boy that's an interesting
[23:27] scripture to read right now when we're
[23:29] talking about the Lamb's wife but if
[23:31] you'll let me go around the cowshed
[23:32] we'll find out that this applies exactly
[23:34] to the thought and the desire I have to
[23:36] share what's on my heart we know that in
[23:39] Ecclesiastes the preacher who is Solomon
[23:42] is writing from the from the wisdom from
[23:44] the things he's seen and he recognizes
[23:46] there's a time there's an appropriate
[23:48] time for different action we don't
[23:50] always have the same action or the same
[23:52] reaction in every situation or in every
[23:55] time but but there's a time there's a
[23:58] Time to to plant there's a time to pluck
[24:00] up there's a time to Ren there's a time
[24:02] to sew amen there's a Time For Peace
[24:04] there's a time for war and and there's
[24:07] times amen for different kinds of action
[24:09] and different kinds of
[24:11] reaction and so we want to look at that
[24:14] a little bit now and I'm going to to
[24:17] begin speaking about the four anointings
[24:21] amen that were over the church ages and
[24:23] and we're going to talk about that uh
[24:25] for just a little bit of time now in the
[24:27] fifth sea brother B says now notice as
[24:29] the Antichrist went forth on his Beast
[24:31] of ministry God sent forth a beast to
[24:34] combat it now watch then every time the
[24:37] Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist
[24:39] rode on his horse on his Beast to
[24:41] announce his ministry God sent his Beast
[24:44] also in his own Mass to announce his
[24:46] combat to it now the scripture says when
[24:48] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[24:50] spirit of God raises a standard against
[24:52] it and so when the enemy went out as an
[24:54] antichrist God sent a certain type of
[24:56] power out to meet him
[24:58] and so down through the church ages as
[25:01] the enemy would try one tactic God would
[25:04] have a power or an anointing that would
[25:06] come over the church amen that would
[25:08] combat that tactic of the enemy amen but
[25:11] there's a time and a season for
[25:13] everything so when the enemy would
[25:15] switch his horses and move his tactic a
[25:17] little further God would bring another
[25:19] anointing or another power to the church
[25:21] amen to comat that
[25:23] anointing and this combat was going down
[25:26] amen and and you couldn't stay amen just
[25:29] in the previous anointing or you
[25:31] wouldn't have the power to overcome amen
[25:34] this new challenge to the church but you
[25:36] must move with the the anointing with
[25:38] the with the power that God is sending
[25:40] in its season in its time and in that
[25:43] time amen you would have overcoming
[25:45] power that was supplied by the Holy
[25:46] Ghost as God sent a power to combat the
[25:49] power of the devil amen so there was a
[25:51] season in a time for all of these things
[25:54] to
[25:56] manifest when
[25:59] when when we go uh in the fifth seal
[26:01] again I'm going to read another quote
[26:02] out of the fifth seal he said but when
[26:04] we get to the fifth seal there's no
[26:05] Beast now just notice and when he opened
[26:08] the F seal I saw under the altar right
[26:10] quick there's no beast and Beast
[26:13] represents power we know that there's no
[26:15] living creature now one of those
[26:17] creatures we find out in studying in the
[26:19] Revelation in the church is one of them
[26:21] was a lion the other one was an ox the
[26:23] other one was a man the other one was an
[26:25] eagle we find out in the church ages
[26:27] that those four beasts meaning four
[26:29] powers was gathered around the Acts of
[26:32] the Apostles just the way the Tabernacle
[26:34] in the wilderness so now he's going all
[26:36] the way back and he's starting to show
[26:38] us these four powers that were with the
[26:40] church amen were the same four powers
[26:43] amen that were gathered around the
[26:44] Tabernacle in the wilderness amen and
[26:47] they were gathered around the book of
[26:48] Acts so we're going to talk about that
[26:52] you understand it cuz I won't I won't
[26:53] take time to go into it we draw it out
[26:56] here and showed just exactly so we're
[26:57] going to do do the same we're going to
[26:58] take a look at those things he's
[27:00] referring to but I want you to catch
[27:02] this statement he makes they were
[27:04] watching over this the lamb and the word
[27:07] to perform the word so what were they
[27:09] watching over they were brother M called
[27:11] them Throne guards they were guards
[27:12] around the Throne of God and these four
[27:15] cherubs these four anointings or these
[27:17] four beasts or Powers were always around
[27:20] the Throne of God Amen and what they
[27:22] were doing he says here he said they
[27:24] were watching over the lamb and the word
[27:26] to perform the word
[27:29] just as they did the Ark of the Covenant
[27:30] in the Holy place in the wilderness and
[27:33] so forth now we even positionally showed
[27:36] by the tribal colors of Israel how many
[27:38] heard the seven Church ages I guess most
[27:40] have notied that even the nature of the
[27:42] Beast was exactly a tribal
[27:45] emblem which the 12 tribes set for are
[27:48] three tribes on each side and the four
[27:49] Beast set and watch these tribes from
[27:51] all four ways and when we went and got
[27:53] the gospels and showed exactly when you
[27:55] enter into the ark they was a guarding
[27:57] the AR Arc the Covenant and we find out
[28:00] that the Covenant of the new church its
[28:02] representation on Earth was the Holy
[28:04] Spirit the blood had sent back to us the
[28:07] Holy Ghost and the four beasts
[28:09] represented the 12 tribes of Israel as
[28:11] it watched and find their natures and
[28:13] taken the same nature and bring it to
[28:15] each one of these four gospels exactly
[28:18] was exactly the same one talked to the
[28:20] lion the other the ox the four gospels
[28:23] there it is the four gospels is the
[28:25] protection of the holy spirit so here
[28:27] he's talking about these four powers of
[28:28] these four anointings again and he's
[28:31] referring to them to the four gospels
[28:33] watching over the Holy Ghost so I want
[28:35] us to turn if we could together to
[28:37] Revelation chap
[28:52] 4 in in Revelation CH
[28:56] 4 we see in in chapter 4 that John was
[29:00] caught up into heaven through an open
[29:01] door he sees one sitting on the throne
[29:04] and he sees the whole he sees the whole
[29:06] scene of the throne room and in verse
[29:08] six he said and Before the Throne there
[29:10] was a sea of glass like under Crystal
[29:12] and in the midst of the throne and round
[29:14] about The Throne were four beasts full
[29:15] of eyes before and behind and the first
[29:18] Beast was like a lion and the second
[29:20] beast like a calf and the third Beast
[29:21] had a face as a man and the fourth Beast
[29:24] was like a flying eagle and the fourth
[29:26] Beast and the four four Beast e had each
[29:29] of them six wings about him and they
[29:31] were full of eyes within and they rest
[29:33] not day and night saying holy holy holy
[29:36] Lord God Almighty which was and is and
[29:38] is to come so we see these these four
[29:41] beasts are around the throne and this is
[29:43] what brother B's referring to they're
[29:45] always around the
[29:46] throne amen we find these four beasts
[29:50] are called cherubims and we find them in
[29:52] Ezekiel Ezekiel chap 1 we're not going
[29:54] to turn there but you can jot it down
[29:56] Ezekiel 1:6 6 to 10 refers to him and
[30:00] Ezekiel 10: 14- 15 so we also know that
[30:05] cherubs were placed amen at Eden when
[30:08] man was cast out of Eden the cheram were
[30:10] placed there with a flaming sword he
[30:13] placed cheram amen there he didn't say
[30:15] how many he placed he just placed them
[30:17] there with a flaming sword to keep the
[30:19] way of the tree of life and so they were
[30:22] keeping or guarding or protecting the
[30:24] way of the tree of life so once again
[30:28] brother B told us that that there was a
[30:30] throne in Eden and in that Throne Amen
[30:32] in Eden was where they would come to
[30:34] worship and that's why the the boys Cain
[30:37] and Abel came to the Eastern Gate of
[30:39] Eden because there was a throne back
[30:41] there but they couldn't get back there
[30:43] because of sin but there was cherubims
[30:45] there to prevent them from getting back
[30:47] to the tree of life but they were
[30:48] keeping the way of the tree of life so
[30:50] that the way of the Tree of Life
[30:51] wouldn't be lost who was guarding it who
[30:54] was keeping it it was
[30:56] cherubims and Heaven who's around the
[30:59] throne these four chams and so and he
[31:01] refers to it to the gospel in the books
[31:03] of Acts and he throws it all the way
[31:05] back to the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[31:08] so we're going to draw that out but I
[31:09] just want to read one more quote here in
[31:12] The Sixth Seal he says and father today
[31:15] we stand here by your grace and it's not
[31:17] because that it's a special people but
[31:19] it's because just like the day of the
[31:21] lion or the ox or the man it's the eagle
[31:24] time so he's telling us what time what a
[31:27] anointing is for our age it's the eagle
[31:30] anointing it's the eagle time it's the
[31:33] anointing of the hour
[31:36] it's it's the time that we're living in
[31:39] it's the working of the holy spirit for
[31:41] this particular time to prove that Jesus
[31:43] is not dead that the things that he said
[31:45] that he would do just before evening
[31:47] lights went out so we find that brother
[31:51] Benham says now this this Eagle time
[31:53] these four beasts now the anointing for
[31:55] the hour is the eagle anointing it's
[31:57] Eagle time the anointing for this hour
[31:59] and he says it's the working of the holy
[32:01] spirit amen so it's the Holy Spirit
[32:04] working in a specific way in each
[32:07] age amen so I'm I'm going to brother
[32:11] Franco if you could turn on the
[32:12] Whiteboard for me I'm going to uh draw
[32:14] this out and once I draw this out then
[32:17] I'm going to try my best to tie this
[32:19] together and get back to the Lamb's wife
[32:22] what does this have to do with the
[32:23] Lamb's wife I hope you're asking
[32:25] yourself that question
[32:27] because when I started studying this I
[32:29] started asking myself the question how
[32:31] am I going to get this back full circle
[32:34] back around
[32:36] so when
[32:38] we when we look here at
[32:41] Revelation uh chapter 4 verse
[32:45] 6 it says round about The Throne were
[32:48] the four beasts so they're surrounding
[32:50] the
[32:51] throne when you go over to chapter
[32:56] 6 it says chap CH 6:1 and I saw when the
[32:59] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[33:02] as it were the noise of thunder and one
[33:04] of the beasts saying come and see verse
[33:07] three and when he opened the second seal
[33:09] I heard the second beast say come and
[33:11] see uh we go go on down uh verse 6 and I
[33:15] Heard a Voice in the midst of the I'm
[33:17] sorry not not that one verse 5 and when
[33:20] he had opened the third seal I heard the
[33:21] third Beast say come and see and verse 7
[33:24] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[33:26] heard the voice of the fourth Beast came
[33:27] come and see so as we go through the
[33:30] opening of the seals amen it shows that
[33:33] these anointings amen have to do with
[33:35] the seals and have to do with the church
[33:36] ages and after each seal was open
[33:38] they're saying come and see for the
[33:40] first four seals so the these anointings
[33:43] are really important so let me see if I
[33:46] can just draw this
[33:47] out so when we when we have the throne
[33:51] in
[33:54] heaven we have a throne in heaven
[33:58] and round about The
[33:59] Throne we
[34:02] have the
[34:04] lion the
[34:07] oxx the
[34:09] man and the
[34:11] eagle these are the cherubim they're in
[34:14] heaven they're they're worshiping God
[34:16] constantly and and these are four
[34:18] anointings but we know that these are
[34:20] the four anointings are the four ways in
[34:22] which the Holy Ghost is working through
[34:23] the church ages so don't separate it
[34:26] from the Holy Ghost amen this is going
[34:29] to this is something that I I hope I can
[34:31] explain we we'll get to it in a minute
[34:33] so this is the picture in heaven and I
[34:35] drew them this way for a certain reason
[34:37] you'll find out as we go on because when
[34:39] Moses led the children out of Egypt
[34:41] there was a tabernacle on
[34:45] Earth and on Earth we had a
[34:47] Tabernacle in the wilderness and in the
[34:50] Tabernacle was a holy of holies and in
[34:52] the holy of holies was the Ark of the
[34:53] Covenant and in the Ark of the Covenant
[34:55] was the hidden Mana amen and and and
[34:58] there also was the two tables of stone
[35:00] so there was the word and in there was
[35:03] the word and there was the the bread of
[35:05] life if I could say it that way and this
[35:08] was God's Throne on Earth and he he had
[35:11] camped around he had Specific
[35:13] Instructions on the way the nation of
[35:15] Israel would Camp around this he would
[35:17] have so many tribes three tribes on the
[35:19] south three tribes on the north three
[35:21] tribes on the East three tribes on the
[35:23] west and they always had to camp in a
[35:25] specific order and there was a leading
[35:27] tribe on each side and that leading
[35:29] tribe on each side each had a banner
[35:31] amen and that Banner each had a
[35:33] representation that each had a
[35:34] representation of an
[35:36] animal and so on this
[35:40] side uh was Judah Judah camped on this
[35:44] side and judah's emblem was the
[35:48] lion over here was
[35:51] Ephraim I got to make sure I spell
[35:53] Ephraim
[35:55] right Ephraim and and his emblem was an
[35:59] ox over here we had Dan on the North
[36:02] side and
[36:04] Dan was an
[36:06] eagle and over here was
[36:11] Reuben and Reuben was a
[36:14] man and so when God placed the children
[36:18] of Israel in their tribal order around
[36:21] his throne around his throne on Earth
[36:25] you had the lion ox man and Eagle cuz as
[36:27] they would set their camp and put their
[36:28] standard up they would have this emblem
[36:30] on the standard so God was reflecting on
[36:32] Earth what was in heaven and you could
[36:34] not get to God's Throne unless you came
[36:37] through these anointings am remember
[36:39] they were watching over the word
[36:41] watching over the lamb and the word to
[36:42] perform the word amen so they had to
[36:45] keep the way what were they doing on
[36:47] Earth they were keeping the way Amen to
[36:50] life amen because God was back there the
[36:52] shikina glory of God was back behind the
[36:54] veil he said I will meet you back here
[36:56] the shakina glory will come between the
[36:58] wings of the cheram Over The Mercy Seat
[37:00] and so God had a mercy seat he had a
[37:02] throne he had a place on Earth to meet
[37:04] them and these four anointings were
[37:06] keeping the way to
[37:08] life because in
[37:10] here in here was the word which is the
[37:14] Covenant he gave Moses which was two
[37:15] tables of stone and in here was the
[37:18] hidden
[37:21] Mana which was bread and this hided Mana
[37:24] never spoiled in the presence of God so
[37:27] it
[37:28] is symbolic of the bread of
[37:32] life that's what's on the throne that's
[37:34] what need these anointings are guarding
[37:36] and they're keeping the word amen
[37:38] because nobody could get to that Throne
[37:40] unless they pass through this anointing
[37:42] so they were keeping away everything
[37:44] that would defile everything that was
[37:46] corrupt everything that wasn't coming
[37:48] the word way they would keep it away but
[37:50] every trueborn Israelite that was coming
[37:52] according to God's way amen they kept
[37:54] the path open they kept the way to come
[37:56] to meet God
[37:59] so let's go back to this one so when we
[38:03] when we go to the throne in heaven when
[38:05] they look at the throne in heaven when
[38:07] John sees it he sees one sitting on the
[38:09] throne amen and we know on the
[38:13] throne in the hand of
[38:15] him is a
[38:18] book and this is The Book of
[38:21] Life so what are they guarding they're
[38:24] guarding the word they're guarding life
[38:26] they're they're around the Throne of God
[38:28] it has to do with life it has to do with
[38:30] the lamb because the lamb sits on this
[38:32] Throne it has to do with with eternal
[38:35] life so let's keep
[38:38] going now brother bam tells
[38:42] us that there's a book of
[38:46] Acts and this is the Holy Ghost
[38:50] dispensation when Christ said I will not
[38:52] leave you comfortless but I will come to
[38:54] you the person of Life himself will come
[38:57] to to the believer but he said
[38:59] surrounding this brother B said were the
[39:07] gospels and it was
[39:11] Matthew
[39:13] Mark
[39:15] Luke and
[39:17] John and brother tells us even the
[39:20] natures of the Gospel the natur of the
[39:21] Gospel matches these anointing there's
[39:23] an anointing on each gospel and over
[39:25] Matthew you have a lion anointing
[39:27] because the lineages start off showing
[39:29] us this is the lineage of the king the
[39:31] king is now coming amen Mark is the
[39:34] sacrifice it's the ox Luke was written
[39:36] by a physician it's the wisdom and
[39:38] cunning of a man and John is the eagle
[39:41] anointing because John starts off where
[39:43] the others start off amen there was a
[39:45] man in the wilderness or a lineage and
[39:47] John starts off in the beginning was the
[39:48] word and the Word was with God it's an
[39:50] eagle anointing amen so you see these
[39:52] same Powers these anointings of the Holy
[39:55] Ghost over these Gospels protecting the
[39:57] way to what this is also a throne and
[40:01] this is also life eternal
[40:05] life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[40:10] these things have to do with
[40:13] life they have to do with eternal life I
[40:16] I want to draw if I can one more I got I
[40:20] got so much
[40:22] stuff now remember we're going around
[40:24] the
[40:25] cowshed so just let's go around around
[40:27] the cou and let's grab all these pieces
[40:30] and see if God can put them together for
[40:32] us when when Christ descended on high he
[40:35] sent gifts to man and those gifts were
[40:37] for the perfecting of the church until
[40:40] we all come into the unity of the faith
[40:42] so then God sent a fful
[40:47] Ministry and in that fful Ministry he
[40:50] said we have Apostles I'm sorry I've got
[40:53] to erase
[40:55] this oh man I got to figure out how to
[40:58] do this it worked I am so you know if
[41:02] brother Simon was here he would already
[41:04] be doing amazing things on this I'm
[41:06] thrilled because I can erase a messed up
[41:08] Mark God help
[41:13] us
[41:17] Apostles
[41:25] prophets evangelists
[41:33] pastors and
[41:36] teachers brother Bon would even go to
[41:38] explain to us that these five full
[41:40] Ministries fall under these Beast
[41:43] anointings so the the
[41:46] Apostle is the lion
[41:49] anointing they are they have the
[41:53] authority like a lion and they're bold
[41:58] these were the apostles who wrote the
[42:00] New Testament who started the New
[42:01] Testament Church who went out and so
[42:03] that's the anointing of the Apostles in
[42:05] in the the prophet anointing and the
[42:09] Evangelist anointing both fall under the
[42:11] ego according to brother
[42:13] banam and this is
[42:16] Vision they have clear perspective even
[42:19] the Evangelist brother B says flies high
[42:21] and operates under this moving of the
[42:23] eagle anointing because they can move as
[42:25] they see spirits in the congregation and
[42:27] begin to address stuff and so the
[42:28] Evangelist moves under the eagle
[42:30] anointing said the Pastor is the ox
[42:33] which is
[42:35] labor and
[42:40] sacrifice and the teacher moves under
[42:42] the man
[42:43] anointing which is Godly
[42:49] wisdom and
[42:54] understanding so even
[42:59] even the the anointings of the Holy
[43:02] Ghost that are upon the ministry gifts
[43:04] match these four
[43:06] anointings and everything has a season
[43:09] and a time and a place there's a time
[43:11] for the Evangelist and a time for the
[43:13] Apostle there's a time for the pastor
[43:15] there's a time for the teacher amen
[43:17] remember everything has a time and has a
[43:19] place everything has a position and
[43:22] these four anointings don't forget are
[43:23] the anointings of the Holy Ghost working
[43:26] in a certain specific way in an age or
[43:28] in a person now we look at these
[43:31] anointings
[43:34] now over the church
[43:37] ages so we had in the first church under
[43:42] the
[43:44] apostles it was the anointing of the
[43:47] lion but then in the Dark
[43:51] Ages we under the anointing of the
[43:54] ox then in the Reformation
[44:00] we were under the anointing of
[44:03] man and now in the end
[44:08] time it's the eagle the
[44:11] prophetic so even over the church ages
[44:14] there's these four anointings which is
[44:16] the anointing of the Holy Ghost specific
[44:18] to a specific purpose all right are we
[44:21] all on the same page we dropped a bunch
[44:23] of nuggets there listen I'm not going to
[44:25] go deep into this this is not about a
[44:27] bunch of uh minutia I just wanted you to
[44:29] see these anointings were all they've
[44:31] been here the whole time amen and what
[44:33] they're always doing is watching over
[44:35] the lamb and the word to perform the
[44:37] word and keep the way to life they've
[44:39] always been doing the same thing they're
[44:41] doing the same thing in heaven they're
[44:42] doing the same thing on earth they were
[44:43] doing the same thing in Israel they were
[44:44] doing the same thing in the gospels
[44:46] they're doing the same thing in the
[44:47] anointings over the fivefold ministry
[44:49] the fivefold ministry is here Amen to
[44:52] watch over the lamb and the word to
[44:53] perform the word and to keep the way to
[44:56] life praise God to keep everything that
[44:58] defiles away amen but to keep the path
[45:01] open for everybody that wants to come as
[45:02] a true born Christian Son of God Amen so
[45:06] it's the same thing over and over and
[45:08] over and God he doesn't change the
[45:10] anointings he keeps using the same
[45:12] anointings over and over and over again
[45:14] amen because these are you could say
[45:15] these are four uh H I hate to say it
[45:18] this way but just bear with me these are
[45:20] four aspects of the Holy Ghost are four
[45:22] faces of the Holy Ghost amen but then
[45:25] brother Benham comes in in in
[45:29] uh the revelation of Jesus Christ out of
[45:32] the church age
[45:33] book and he says ever since then people
[45:36] have failed to realize that there is
[45:37] just one God with three offices or
[45:39] manifestations they know there is one
[45:41] God according to scripture but they try
[45:43] to make it the Fantastic theory that God
[45:45] is like a bunch of grapes three persons
[45:48] with some same definity shared equally
[45:50] by all but it plainly says here in
[45:53] Revelation that Jesus is that which is
[45:56] that which was that which is to come he
[45:58] is the alpha the Omega which means the
[46:01] he is a to z or all of it he is
[46:05] everything the almighty he is the rose
[46:07] of Sharon the lily of the valley the
[46:09] bright and Morning Star the righteous
[46:11] Branch the Father the Son and the Holy
[46:14] Ghost he is God almighty God one God so
[46:18] we find out it's all God Amen when you
[46:20] look in heaven amen God is sitting on
[46:22] his throne in heaven and around before
[46:24] him is seven spirits around him is these
[46:27] four beasts then there's 24 elders and
[46:29] and then you have a lamb and you have
[46:31] all of these things and a mighty Angel
[46:32] but really it all came out of him amen
[46:35] it's all him and Christ is God and
[46:38] everything is in him he's the A to Z
[46:40] he's the all of it so what are these
[46:42] four anointings they're the four
[46:44] anointings of the Holy Ghost what is the
[46:45] Holy Ghost it's Christ returning to his
[46:47] church it's the it's the power and
[46:49] spirit of Christ working in certain ways
[46:51] through certain ages or through certain
[46:53] Ministry
[46:55] gifts because the fivefold Ministry it's
[46:58] not their own Ministry it's the ministry
[46:59] of Christ we don't want individual
[47:02] Ministry we want the ministry of Christ
[47:04] but Christ sent gifts himself to the
[47:06] church and now he's working through a
[47:08] fivefold Ministry to feed his Sheep amen
[47:11] but it's the ministry of Christ but the
[47:13] ministry of Christ is coming in five
[47:16] different facets to to work in different
[47:18] ways in the church under four of his
[47:22] anointings okay so that means now we're
[47:27] coming back to the lamb to the
[47:31] lamb that means in the lamb is a lion ox
[47:37] man and
[47:39] Eagle you think that's fair to
[47:42] say in the lamb is the lion ox man and
[47:47] Eagle When Jesus Christ was here on
[47:50] Earth Amen in the son of man Ministry
[47:52] 2,000 years ago amen he displayed all
[47:56] four of the those
[47:58] anointings but yet he was the Lamb of
[48:00] God come to take away the sins of the
[48:02] world when he was introduced by John the
[48:03] Baptist John the Baptist didn't
[48:05] introduce him as liono man and Eagle he
[48:07] introduced him as the Lamb of God and he
[48:10] always was the Lamb of God his Earthly
[48:12] Journey was as the Lamb of God but as
[48:15] the Lamb of God Amen he exhibited the
[48:17] full nature of God and the full
[48:20] attributes of God and the full
[48:22] attributes of the power of the Holy
[48:23] Ghost was manifest in him so you can
[48:25] look in Jesus as life and you can see
[48:27] lion ox man an
[48:29] eagle amen can we just turn to some
[48:31] scriptures together and look at that
[48:33] let's go to John Chapter
[48:42] 2 and there's a reason I'm going through
[48:45] this and we'll just let the cat out of
[48:47] the
[48:48] bag because if we don't look at the word
[48:51] and whole we get such a simplistic idea
[48:54] of things and we say that Jesus Christ
[48:56] is this way amen he's the lamb he's this
[48:59] way so we must be this way but when
[49:01] Jesus was here he was very dynamic in
[49:04] his personality and in his ministry and
[49:06] he operated many different ways in
[49:08] different
[49:09] circumstances and God the nature of God
[49:12] now in one man cannot come down and be
[49:14] simplistic to the way that he was just
[49:16] this one facet or this one this one way
[49:19] that I want Jesus to be no he's the full
[49:21] gamut all wrapped up in the one he was
[49:23] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[49:25] poured into one vessel and he was
[49:27] manifesting all the power all the
[49:29] manifestation all the
[49:32] characteristics so we don't want to
[49:34] narrow our vision down but we want to
[49:38] see the lamb and all of his glory and
[49:40] all of his power and John
[49:46] 2:3
[49:47] says and the Jews Passover was at hand
[49:50] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found
[49:52] in the temple those that sold oxen and
[49:54] sheep and doves and Changers of money
[49:56] sitting and when he had made a scorge of
[49:59] small Co cords he drove them out of the
[50:01] temple and the sheep and The Oxen and
[50:03] poured out the Changers money and
[50:04] overthrew the tables and said unto them
[50:07] old does take these things hence uh make
[50:10] not my father's house a house of
[50:12] merchandise now I'm going to read this
[50:15] again I'm going to read just one verse
[50:17] and I want you to think of a
[50:22] lamb when he had made a scorge that's a
[50:25] little whip of small cords he drove them
[50:28] out of the temple and the sheep and The
[50:30] Oxen and poured out the Changers money
[50:32] and overthrew the
[50:35] tables are you thinking lamb no way or
[50:39] are you thinking lion are you thinking
[50:41] the king are you thinking the authority
[50:43] that came into the temple to purge it
[50:45] and clean it but was he still the lamb
[50:48] yes he was still the lamb he was the
[50:49] Lamb of God he was he was the the Son of
[50:52] God Amen he was here in a son of man
[50:54] Ministry but inside of him was was also
[50:57] a lion he was a lion of the tribe of
[50:59] Judah
[51:01] amen let's go to John
[51:14] 19 John
[51:17] 19 verse
[51:22] 16 then delivered he him therefore unto
[51:25] them to be crucify ified and they took
[51:27] Jesus and led him away and he bearing
[51:30] his cross went forth into a place that's
[51:32] called the place of the skull which is
[51:34] called in Hebrew galtha where they
[51:37] crucified him and two other with him on
[51:39] either side one and Jesus in the
[51:42] midst he was the lamb the sacrificial
[51:46] lamb he was under the anointing of the
[51:49] ox a beast of burden and of
[51:52] sacrifice let's go to Luke chapter 20
[52:00] Luke Chapter
[52:08] 20 Luke 20 verse
[52:14] 21 and they asked him saying Master we
[52:16] know that thou sayest and teachest
[52:18] rightly neither accept thou the person
[52:20] of any but teach us the way of God truly
[52:23] is it lawful for us to give tribute unto
[52:25] Caesar or no but he perceiving their
[52:28] craftiness and said unto them why tempt
[52:30] you me show me a penny whose image and
[52:32] subscription hath it they answered and
[52:34] said Caesars and he said unto them
[52:36] render therefore unto Caesar the things
[52:38] which are Caesars and unto God the
[52:39] things which be gods and they could not
[52:42] take hold of his words before the people
[52:44] and they marveled at his answer and held
[52:47] their
[52:47] peace that's the cunning of a man amen
[52:51] he's under the man anointing there now
[52:53] let's go back to John chapter 1
[53:06] John
[53:08] 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him
[53:10] and saith of him behold an Israelite
[53:13] indeed indeed in whom is no guile
[53:16] Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest
[53:17] thou me Jesus answered and said unto him
[53:20] before that Philip called thee when thou
[53:22] was under the Fig Tree I saw
[53:25] thee I saw thee he's under the eagle
[53:29] anointing the prophetic anointing and we
[53:30] know that he was the great prophet that
[53:32] Moses was speaking to when that Prophet
[53:34] comes a prophet like unto me so Jesus
[53:37] was under the the lion anointing the ox
[53:39] anointing the man anointing and the
[53:41] eagle anointing but the whole time he
[53:43] was a lamb so in the lamb are also these
[53:47] four Powers Yeah amen amen why because
[53:50] they're they're part of the Holy Ghost
[53:52] they're part of the power of God they're
[53:54] part of the demonstration of God and he
[53:56] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[53:59] we got many other examples in Jesus's
[54:01] Ministry he he says the we we've got him
[54:04] at the woman at the well Discerning the
[54:05] woman's life and she says I perceive
[54:07] that you're a prophet because he says
[54:09] what he says go fetch your husband she
[54:10] says I have none he says what you've
[54:12] said is right because you've had five
[54:13] and the one you have now is not your own
[54:15] and she say I perceive you to be a
[54:16] prophet amen what is that that's an
[54:18] eagle but he's Still the
[54:21] Lamb amen when they brought the woman
[54:24] caught in adultery amen they tried tempt
[54:26] him and trapped him with this woman in
[54:28] adultery and quoting Moses's law and
[54:30] what does he do he totally unravels
[54:32] their whole plan by writing something in
[54:34] the sand amen he writes something he
[54:36] stands he tells them that you are the
[54:39] without sin cast the first stone he goes
[54:41] back to writing in the sand whatever
[54:43] he's doing I don't know but he's
[54:45] absolutely unraveling their plan they
[54:48] had a tight plan to get him trapped in
[54:50] this thing amen and and when he when he
[54:52] rose amen he rose and he acted like he
[54:55] was surprised
[54:58] he said woman where are thine accusers
[55:00] is there no one to accuse you he said
[55:01] none my Lord he said neither do I accuse
[55:03] you go and S no more what was he it was
[55:05] the cunningness of a man dealing with
[55:07] them and he would deal with them out of
[55:09] the scriptures and they would say Amen
[55:11] what about the resurrection of the dead
[55:12] he says don't you know the word amen
[55:15] that he's the he's the God he's the he's
[55:17] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's
[55:19] not the god of the dead but he's God of
[55:21] the living and he kept unraveling until
[55:23] they got to the place where they would
[55:25] ask him no more questions
[55:30] praise
[55:33] God he discerned their thoughts he
[55:36] healed their
[55:38] sick in John chapter 8 he looked at the
[55:41] Pharisees and he said you're of your
[55:43] father the
[55:45] devil now remember he's a
[55:48] lamb see the reason I'm saying this is
[55:50] when we think lamb in Lamb nature amen
[55:53] we start thinking just Meek and just
[55:55] humble But realize in the lamb was these
[55:57] four
[55:58] anointings Amen in the Holy Ghost are
[56:01] these four
[56:04] Expressions perfect
[56:07] amen even Jesus was acting the part of a
[56:11] pastor he acted the part of an
[56:13] evangelist he acted the part of a
[56:14] prophet he acted the part of a pastor he
[56:17] acted the part of a
[56:18] teacher why because it was all in
[56:22] him he he in Matthew 15 he says Jesus
[56:25] called us disciples and them said I have
[56:27] compassion on the multitude because they
[56:30] continue with me now 3 days having
[56:32] nothing to eat and I will not send them
[56:34] away fasting L they faint in the way he
[56:38] he cared for the people wanted to make
[56:39] sure they had something to eat so he
[56:41] worked a miracle in the breaking of
[56:42] Loaves and Fishes why because he had
[56:44] compassion on the people then on the
[56:47] Pharisees he called them
[56:48] Devils
[56:50] amen some were blatant Sinners some were
[56:53] some some were hidden Sinners and he
[56:55] exposed exposed their sin and called
[56:57] them Whited seers with hidden sin some
[56:59] had open sin and he openly forgave them
[57:02] of their sin amen why he he is the
[57:05] fullness of God and the fullness of God
[57:07] is not this simplistic little narrow
[57:09] Vision the fullness of God has all these
[57:16] manifestations amen let's go to Proverbs
[57:23] 26 I hope and pray that these
[57:26] meanderings and ramblings come together
[57:28] in your heart to start to paint a
[57:45] picture Proverbs
[57:48] 26 before I read this just want to say
[57:52] you know how brother Benham would say
[57:53] that the the the the difficult that the
[57:56] Pharisees and some of the religious
[57:58] leaders had in the day Jesus was there
[58:00] is that sometimes he was so rough with
[58:02] them and and he was unpredictable they
[58:04] couldn't control him and brother R even
[58:06] used the analogy they would say now this
[58:08] man he tears up the temple he tears on
[58:10] the religion he speaks evil of your
[58:12] preachers amen but but what about your
[58:14] kind old priest I mean he fed you when
[58:16] you were poor and he took care of dad
[58:18] when he was out of work and when you
[58:19] were sick he gave you money and they
[58:21] start trying to show that the nature of
[58:24] Jesus Christ was the wrong kind of
[58:28] nature
[58:30] amen praise God maybe it's just a whole
[58:34] lot more
[58:35] complex than our simple minds want to
[58:38] frame it right we want to make him this
[58:41] or we want to make him
[58:43] that but maybe the fullness of the
[58:47] godhead has the full expression of
[58:51] God sometimes God's a lion and sometimes
[58:54] God's an ox and sometimes God's an eagle
[58:56] amen sometimes God's a man
[58:58] yes am amen what are these anointings
[59:02] doing watching over the lamb and the
[59:04] word to keep the word what are they
[59:07] doing they're keeping the way of life
[59:09] keeping the path to
[59:12] life and
[59:14] so maybe it's not so
[59:18] simple the question is when should you
[59:21] be a
[59:22] lion and when should you be an ox and
[59:26] then when should you be a man and then
[59:28] when
[59:31] should I thought I was supposed to be a
[59:33] lamb you are supposed to be a lamb be
[59:36] the lamb like he was the lamb yeah amen
[59:39] but how now how am I supposed to act in
[59:41] every situation let's go to Proverbs 26
[59:46] now verse
[59:50] 4 Proverbs
[59:52] 26:4 answer not a fool according to his
[59:55] folly
[59:56] lest thou also be like unto him verse
[59:59] five answer a fool according to his
[1:00:02] folly lest he be wise as his own
[1:00:07] conceit so am I supposed to answer a
[1:00:09] fool or not answer a
[1:00:13] fool let's read it again answer not a
[1:00:17] fool according to his folly lest thou be
[1:00:20] like unto him answer a fool according to
[1:00:23] his folly lest he be wise in his own
[1:00:25] conceit
[1:00:27] I'm
[1:00:29] confused do I answer a fool in his folly
[1:00:32] or do I not answer a fool in his
[1:00:36] folly maybe there's a time to answer and
[1:00:38] a time not to answer maybe in everything
[1:00:42] there's a time in a season maybe there's
[1:00:43] a time to speak and maybe there's a time
[1:00:45] to refrain from speaking maybe there's a
[1:00:47] time to love and there's a time to hate
[1:00:49] maybe there's a time of war and a time
[1:00:51] of Peace maybe there's a time for
[1:00:54] everything amen and maybe there's an
[1:00:56] anointing of the Holy Ghost for every
[1:00:58] need yeah when it's time to speak when
[1:01:01] it's time to answer questions when it's
[1:01:03] time to refrain from answering maybe
[1:01:05] there's a holy ghost anointing that can
[1:01:07] match the need for the me the moment
[1:01:09] that we're
[1:01:11] in
[1:01:14] amen you can
[1:01:16] say you know H you can say but we're
[1:01:20] under the eagle anointing absolutely
[1:01:23] we're under the eagle anointing but even
[1:01:25] under the eagle anointing the the great
[1:01:28] prophet Eagle of our day under the eagle
[1:01:30] anointing sometimes took the ox
[1:01:33] anointing remember when he was standing
[1:01:35] in the wings of a meeting ready to go
[1:01:37] out on the platform and there's somebody
[1:01:38] out there telling a lie about he
[1:01:40] couldn't make it his brother's sick and
[1:01:41] and he's standing out there amen the
[1:01:44] prophet should have exposed the
[1:01:47] a but the ox
[1:01:50] suffered suffered the reproach because
[1:01:52] he didn't want to hurt that man's
[1:01:53] Ministry
[1:01:58] amen but then when they got challenged
[1:02:01] in Chicago by all those ministers who
[1:02:03] were challenging on his teaching of
[1:02:04] serpent seed and godhead and brother
[1:02:06] benam was really nice to him but he says
[1:02:07] you know now any of you who've got
[1:02:09] question just won't you take your Bibles
[1:02:10] and come stand alongside of me and let's
[1:02:12] talk and later when he got back to his
[1:02:14] church he says he said nobody come he
[1:02:18] said they were smarter than I thought
[1:02:19] they
[1:02:23] were sometimes he would take the
[1:02:25] challenge sometimes he would
[1:02:28] pass sometimes he would expose what was
[1:02:31] going on in somebody's life sometimes he
[1:02:33] wouldn't say a
[1:02:34] word when Gordon Lindsay came to give
[1:02:37] him documents that would take away his
[1:02:39] tent and cause him to lose his magazine
[1:02:41] he signed the documents knowing exactly
[1:02:43] what was happened there was a brother
[1:02:44] with him he told him before Gordon
[1:02:46] Lindsay got there all that was happening
[1:02:48] he signed the documents let him go as he
[1:02:50] was walking out the door he said wait a
[1:02:52] minute brother
[1:02:53] Lindsay can you imagine that man's heart
[1:02:55] heart it probably hit the floor and
[1:02:57] bounc
[1:02:58] back he says won't you come preach for
[1:03:01] us
[1:03:08] sometime sometimes he would hide
[1:03:10] someone's sin sometimes he'd expose
[1:03:11] somebody's
[1:03:14] sin times he would rant and sometimes he
[1:03:17] would smooth
[1:03:22] over praise God Amen
[1:03:28] brother B says in the
[1:03:30] Masterpiece said notice here the life
[1:03:32] that was in the husk in the stalk and
[1:03:34] the tossel and the husk all gathers in
[1:03:36] the seed and the life that was in the
[1:03:38] stalk went one went to make the other
[1:03:41] justification made a way for
[1:03:42] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:03:45] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:03:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:03:48] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:03:51] in Perfection back to the word again to
[1:03:54] manifest itself
[1:03:56] if the fullness of the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:58] returned then all the power and
[1:04:00] anointings of the Holy Ghost is here
[1:04:04] am
[1:04:06] Amen brother bam tells us after he got
[1:04:10] done preaching the seals and the
[1:04:11] Revelation series he's telling us that
[1:04:14] God now has a throne and that Throne is
[1:04:16] in the heart of
[1:04:18] man he said that Throne came into the
[1:04:21] heart of man on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:24] when the Holy Ghost came into the human
[1:04:26] heart now there's a throne and there's
[1:04:29] Throne guards around the
[1:04:31] throne the four gospels amen are leading
[1:04:34] the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:37] right the four anointings over the
[1:04:39] fivefold ministry are leading people to
[1:04:42] the baptism of holy ghost in Union with
[1:04:44] Christ what are they doing these four
[1:04:46] anointings are ushering people into the
[1:04:48] presence of the Tree of Life the four
[1:04:51] gospels and the four anointings amen and
[1:04:53] the four anointings of where the Tre
[1:04:55] other Church ages they were all doing
[1:04:57] something they were all empowering the
[1:04:59] church to overcome a a discrepancy that
[1:05:01] was coming in their day or Antichrist
[1:05:03] Spirit there was another anointing that
[1:05:05] would come in every age to combat that
[1:05:07] anointing and the whole time what they
[1:05:09] were doing they were bringing the church
[1:05:10] out of the Dark Ages and bringing them
[1:05:12] back to where the Holy Ghost was once
[1:05:14] again enthroned in the heart of his
[1:05:16] church what were they doing they were
[1:05:17] keeping the way of the tree of life and
[1:05:19] they were ushering where once those
[1:05:21] choms and at the Gate of Eden were were
[1:05:24] keeping them from the tree of life amen
[1:05:26] now they're ushering man back into the
[1:05:29] tree of life and these anointings over
[1:05:31] the church ages and anointings over the
[1:05:32] fivefold ministry and the anointings of
[1:05:34] the Holy Ghost and the anointings over
[1:05:36] the gospel are trying to bring us back
[1:05:38] into Union with God Amen and when we
[1:05:41] come back into Union with God we come
[1:05:43] back to a marriage of the lamb in order
[1:05:45] to be married to the lamb you have to be
[1:05:48] a lamb and these anointings are bringing
[1:05:50] us back to a lamb nature to be United
[1:05:53] back with the lamb so you have Mr and M
[1:05:55] is lamb
[1:06:00] again I thought I was under an ego
[1:06:02] anointing that's the anointing of the
[1:06:04] age this is the anointing of the
[1:06:06] prophetic this is the anointing of Clear
[1:06:08] Vision this is the anointing when the
[1:06:10] word has been unfolded and we clearly
[1:06:12] see the word from beginning to end we're
[1:06:14] under an eagle anointing but don't
[1:06:16] forget that eagle anointing is still
[1:06:18] there to push you back into the presence
[1:06:20] of the Lamb because he wants you to sit
[1:06:22] on his throne with him and he wants to
[1:06:24] sit on the throne of your heart with you
[1:06:26] so that you can come to an invisible
[1:06:28] union he wants us to come back to
[1:06:31] fullness not partial am
[1:06:37] fullness brother brandham I just want to
[1:06:40] show some examples from The Prophet's
[1:06:42] life because he was this he was this uh
[1:06:46] this portion of the prophecy that came
[1:06:47] to full manifestation before our eyes we
[1:06:51] get to see a mature adopted son of God
[1:06:54] and he was the Great Eagle for our age
[1:06:57] he was under the eagle anointing do you
[1:06:59] believe that the eagle anointing was the
[1:07:01] anointing on brother brenham's life yes
[1:07:03] but do you realize also that there was
[1:07:05] other powers that worked in his life at
[1:07:07] other times for specific
[1:07:11] needs brother B made a statement now he
[1:07:14] says and now he got a question on
[1:07:17] questions and answers in the seals now I
[1:07:19] just it goes to show that people without
[1:07:21] the baptism and not called to the office
[1:07:23] a minister has no business to be in the
[1:07:25] pool pit somebody asked him a question
[1:07:26] and he didn't like the way it was
[1:07:28] phrased that's right he said I could
[1:07:30] take that person now by the help of God
[1:07:32] and tie them in such a knot and make
[1:07:34] their head swim I don't care what and he
[1:07:38] stops says now I don't mean now that
[1:07:40] don't sound right right forgive me I
[1:07:44] didn't mean that Lord I felt him check
[1:07:47] me on
[1:07:48] that I didn't mean to say it that way
[1:07:52] I'm sorry I believe that the Holy Spirit
[1:07:54] could reveal to that person some secret
[1:07:57] that sounds
[1:07:59] better here you have the prophet of the
[1:08:01] age if anybody's got a right to rail
[1:08:04] down amen the call down fire from heaven
[1:08:06] on false teaching and he and he does it
[1:08:09] many many times not to individual people
[1:08:11] but he does it to the age and to the
[1:08:13] denominations but here he comes to a
[1:08:15] place where he starts to take that same
[1:08:17] how dare this person how dare you take
[1:08:19] the word and I could tie him in knots
[1:08:21] and all of the sudden the spirit of God
[1:08:23] checks him amen why because there's more
[1:08:25] anointings than just the eagle anointing
[1:08:27] at work in the Holy
[1:08:30] Ghost and he begins to
[1:08:33] repent he said then the next thing he
[1:08:36] says this is what I want to start paying
[1:08:37] attention to said just like tuning an
[1:08:40] instrument when you do something wrong
[1:08:43] you can tell it as a
[1:08:47] Christian said you do something wrong he
[1:08:50] didn't like
[1:08:51] that he was so tuned in to the spirit of
[1:08:54] God that when he did something that God
[1:08:57] didn't like amen he caught it and he
[1:08:59] began to repent and said he didn't like
[1:09:05] that I mean I thought the prophet of an
[1:09:08] age would have the right to say whatever
[1:09:09] he wants and straighten out everything
[1:09:11] that's no he had to be a
[1:09:16] lamb more than just an eagle he had to
[1:09:19] be a
[1:09:20] lamb and in the lamb was all four
[1:09:23] anointings
[1:09:27] he goes
[1:09:29] on brother brandham it's amazing how
[1:09:32] when he begins the rail on one
[1:09:34] individual the spirit of God checks him
[1:09:37] just stops him in his tracks and the
[1:09:39] Lord didn't like that but then he comes
[1:09:41] to the indictment and he begins to rail
[1:09:43] on the whole
[1:09:44] age amen and he starts to scream out I
[1:09:47] indict this
[1:09:49] generation and he starts to say some
[1:09:51] rough things about the generation this
[1:09:53] sin loving gener I am this cursed sin
[1:09:56] loving generation for the second
[1:09:58] crucifixion of Jesus
[1:10:01] Christ where was all that soft I
[1:10:04] shouldn't have said well maybe the Holy
[1:10:05] Ghost could show him a better
[1:10:07] way to everything there is a season and
[1:10:10] in a time and in a place a time to speak
[1:10:13] a time to refrain from
[1:10:18] speaking remember brother B was talking
[1:10:20] about that time that he was in the
[1:10:21] meetings and the the young couple was
[1:10:23] kissing and and and making love in the
[1:10:25] front row and he had been told before a
[1:10:27] great test was coming because we know
[1:10:29] that the Elisha Ministry the Elijah
[1:10:31] Ministry failed that test before when
[1:10:33] Elisha called the she Bears to come down
[1:10:35] and and now the God speaks to him and
[1:10:37] says whatever you say and and then uh
[1:10:40] now he now he's watching this couple and
[1:10:42] he's upset about what they're doing but
[1:10:44] he looked down at him and he says says I
[1:10:46] looked down there I said I forgive you
[1:10:50] now listen that's exactly what he
[1:10:53] wanted amen but the eagle
[1:10:56] anointing yeah the eagle anointing came
[1:11:00] to bring the word to bring separation
[1:11:02] and bring judgment upon the Earth that's
[1:11:04] why God had him throw a stone in the air
[1:11:06] and start a little Whirlwind and go and
[1:11:08] judgment striking the West Coast because
[1:11:09] his ministry his ministry was to come
[1:11:12] and call out a bride out from among the
[1:11:14] denominations Amen to be a separate
[1:11:16] people and it was also to begin the
[1:11:18] wrath of God and the judgments for those
[1:11:19] who
[1:11:21] rejected amen but yet here he stands
[1:11:25] and the anointing of Elijah and says I
[1:11:28] forgive you which was not happening in
[1:11:30] the Old
[1:11:32] Testament they were bringing judgment
[1:11:34] and curses and railings and judgment but
[1:11:37] now under the same anointing of the same
[1:11:40] Prophet Elijah anointing he looks down
[1:11:41] and says I forgive you and that's what
[1:11:44] God wanted for That
[1:11:49] season amen praise God
[1:11:55] here's another
[1:11:57] one do you remember when brother
[1:12:00] Benham had a friend take his rifle and
[1:12:03] Bor it out to be a
[1:12:05] weatherbe sent it
[1:12:07] to sent it to weatherbe and had it bored
[1:12:10] out and he took it down to the rifle
[1:12:12] range and when he shot it there was too
[1:12:14] much pressure there wasn't enough
[1:12:15] clearance they messed up on the
[1:12:16] Machining and it exploded it put a bunch
[1:12:19] of shrapnel in his eye and around his
[1:12:21] eye almost took out his vision he said
[1:12:23] it was the hand of God that protected
[1:12:24] him was a what the doctor told him blew
[1:12:27] the barrel out to the 50 yard line blew
[1:12:29] the bolt he said to the deer pin I don't
[1:12:32] know where the deer pin
[1:12:34] was and he talks about that he talks
[1:12:38] about that story and then he comes a
[1:12:40] little bit later after he tells that
[1:12:42] story to the church and he makes this
[1:12:43] statement he says now I know the
[1:12:46] spiritual application to it there are
[1:12:49] three of us in this room right now that
[1:12:51] knows what it is and it raised the hair
[1:12:54] on your head
[1:12:55] but I wouldn't tell no one just these
[1:12:58] three people for a confirmation now it's
[1:13:00] all right it's it's all right God knowed
[1:13:04] all about it and forewarned it and
[1:13:06] everything else and we know it it was
[1:13:08] partly my fault and I had something I
[1:13:12] took up for a man one time when I should
[1:13:14] not have took up I I I could have just
[1:13:17] shook the liver out of him instead of
[1:13:19] doing it I had to pay for it that's all
[1:13:21] right it's me and it's forgiven now and
[1:13:24] we'll go on
[1:13:26] wow he looks down at a couple doing
[1:13:28] wrong and he says I forgive
[1:13:31] you he goes the rail on a man that
[1:13:33] that's got the wrong Doctrine and asking
[1:13:35] a question and God checks him and
[1:13:36] shouldn't have said it like that the
[1:13:37] Lord didn't like it he comes to the to
[1:13:39] the indictment he starts railing on the
[1:13:41] whole generation and and and it's like
[1:13:44] it's back and forth and up and down and
[1:13:46] when are you rough and when are you soft
[1:13:48] and when do you forgive and when do you
[1:13:49] don't forgive and now there's a man amen
[1:13:52] that had done something wrong and
[1:13:53] brother bham St took up for him defended
[1:13:56] him protected him when he shouldn't have
[1:13:59] he should have shook the liver out of
[1:14:02] him and because he took up for the man
[1:14:04] when he should have corrected the man
[1:14:07] God allowed this accident to happen is
[1:14:09] what brother B said it was my fault yeah
[1:14:12] and God showed him it was his fault cuz
[1:14:14] he shouldn't have done
[1:14:19] that are you
[1:14:22] confused when do you answer a fool
[1:14:25] according to his family when do you not
[1:14:26] answer a fool according to his
[1:14:30] folly I want to propose to you that
[1:14:32] there's absolutely no intellectual way
[1:14:34] to figure this
[1:14:36] out there is zero way there's no
[1:14:39] textbook there's no manual there's no
[1:14:41] Creed there's no code of conduct well we
[1:14:43] will ever figure out how God wants us to
[1:14:45] act in every
[1:14:47] situation amen and I think it's supposed
[1:14:50] to be that way because if we come into a
[1:14:53] uniformity of cond cond and we find out
[1:14:56] in this situation you act this way and
[1:14:57] in this situation you act this way then
[1:14:59] all of a sudden we'll just go through
[1:15:00] the motions we all become a little
[1:15:03] robots little 10 soldiers but God wants
[1:15:05] to manifest himself in his bride the
[1:15:08] same way he manifest himself in Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ and in Jesus Christ was the lamb
[1:15:13] but in the lamb was the fullness of the
[1:15:15] godhead bodily and sometimes he spoke
[1:15:18] and sometimes he didn't speak and
[1:15:19] sometimes he judged and sometimes he
[1:15:22] forgave amen sometimes he healed
[1:15:25] sometimes he didn't heal yeah many times
[1:15:27] brother Brandon would pray for people
[1:15:29] with the phone they'd be healed he would
[1:15:30] fly out or drive out to somebody pray
[1:15:32] for them they'd be healed and then
[1:15:34] sometimes God would stop him and say
[1:15:35] don't
[1:15:39] go
[1:15:42] amen here's another
[1:15:44] one you remember brother brandham said
[1:15:47] one time he went to the Pentecostal uh
[1:15:49] there was a Pentecostal preacher and the
[1:15:51] Pentecostal preacher wanted to uh
[1:15:52] introduce his wife to brother brandham
[1:15:55] and he saw her in her tight clothes and
[1:15:56] her makeup and all these things and
[1:15:58] jewelry whatever I don't remember the
[1:15:59] full description and and and brother B
[1:16:02] said I thought you told me your wife was
[1:16:04] a saint she looks more like a haint to
[1:16:08] me this is the man who got corrected for
[1:16:12] saying I could take the Bible and tie
[1:16:14] that man in knots and God didn't like
[1:16:17] that yeah now a man introduces his
[1:16:23] wife and he says I thought you said she
[1:16:26] was a saint she looks more like a haint
[1:16:28] to me now I I don't know about you but
[1:16:36] I if I said that and you overheard me
[1:16:41] what would you think of
[1:16:43] me brother Chad's not a good pastor he
[1:16:46] should have never said that that's not
[1:16:48] the way you're to handle that we're
[1:16:50] supposed to have a lamb
[1:16:53] nature maybe we're too quick to judge
[1:16:55] each other based off our own
[1:16:58] Paradigm we get in our mind the way
[1:17:00] Christ would operate in every situation
[1:17:02] but listen it's way more complex than
[1:17:04] you and I could ever figure out the the
[1:17:06] nature of God is so deep and so complex
[1:17:09] and so diverse and there's so many
[1:17:10] things God's trying to accomplish maybe
[1:17:12] there is a time to correct and maybe
[1:17:14] there's a time to refrain maybe there's
[1:17:16] a Time amen like brother brandom said he
[1:17:19] he he made a quote one time I'm not
[1:17:21] going to quote it right I could bring it
[1:17:22] here but I've never brought it to the
[1:17:23] pull pit but it's I laugh every time I
[1:17:25] read it brother R said if you got a good
[1:17:27] gospel Pastor it'll take take the gospel
[1:17:31] and hold his children down and spank
[1:17:34] them right good with
[1:17:36] it this is a quote if you want me to I
[1:17:39] can put it on the
[1:17:42] overhead he said then you'll find a a a
[1:17:46] a church that's an order where people
[1:17:47] want to come and the spirit can
[1:17:50] move pastor's not supposed to hold his
[1:17:53] children down in space think him right
[1:17:55] good with the Bible unless sometimes he
[1:17:59] is and then maybe sometimes he's not
[1:18:01] supposed
[1:18:03] to maybe sometimes he should be
[1:18:07] patient but maybe sometimes he's too
[1:18:10] patient maybe there's times a daddy
[1:18:12] should be patient maybe sometimes a
[1:18:13] daddy's too
[1:18:19] patient you see what I'm
[1:18:21] saying we we judge people so quick yes
[1:18:25] they should have never said that to
[1:18:26] their child they never should have said
[1:18:27] that to that brother I know that was
[1:18:29] wrong but the way he said it that that
[1:18:31] how do you know that wasn't exactly what
[1:18:33] God wanted and how do you know that
[1:18:35] wasn't exactly what was needed how how
[1:18:38] can you say what you needed was an ox
[1:18:39] anointing when God was calling for a
[1:18:43] lion I I'm to the place now where I I
[1:18:46] don't want to touch God's anointed I
[1:18:49] don't know what God's doing I'm to the
[1:18:50] point where I don't have it figured out
[1:18:52] friends I don't know what should happen
[1:18:54] in every conversation in every situation
[1:18:57] but I do know one thing that we're going
[1:18:58] to have to completely depend on the
[1:19:00] leadership of the Holy Ghost and God is
[1:19:02] going to have to take control of his
[1:19:04] bride if she's going to operate to the
[1:19:06] same level that Jesus Christ operated in
[1:19:08] his Earthly Ministry she's going to have
[1:19:10] to be just as surrendered to the will of
[1:19:12] the father amen so that when brother
[1:19:14] when when Jesus Christ walks down
[1:19:16] through the pool of Bethesda he will
[1:19:18] tiptoe around sick people and infirmed
[1:19:21] and B motherss with babies and'll go to
[1:19:23] the one God said and do that and that
[1:19:26] only no matter what everybody else
[1:19:28] thinks how could you do that how could
[1:19:30] you walk past that b you didn't even
[1:19:31] pray for you didn't even stop and talk
[1:19:33] to her and tell her that you wished her
[1:19:35] baby would get how could you
[1:19:37] be the Lamb of
[1:19:39] God you weren't sweet enough you weren't
[1:19:42] kind enough you weren't hard
[1:19:43] enough you tolerated too much you didn't
[1:19:46] tolerate
[1:19:49] enough God help us am it's all I can say
[1:19:53] is God help us amen how do you know that
[1:19:57] that Mom and Dad aren't handling that
[1:19:59] situation in their home exactly the way
[1:20:01] God wants them to handle it amen it may
[1:20:03] be wrong I don't
[1:20:06] know how do you know that that the
[1:20:09] minister who comes and preaches a soft
[1:20:12] easy message wasn't exactly what God
[1:20:13] wanted or if he comes and he preaches a
[1:20:15] raing hard message wasn't exactly what
[1:20:17] God wanted
[1:20:23] right and how how many times we go out
[1:20:25] and says he never should have said that
[1:20:27] never should have done that that was
[1:20:28] wrong and maybe it was what God was
[1:20:31] calling for and if we say that what have
[1:20:34] we said about the spirit of
[1:20:39] God could we be calling a holy thing
[1:20:42] Unholy
[1:20:47] right I hope you're sufficiently
[1:20:49] impressed that this is way more
[1:20:51] complicated than a human brain will
[1:20:53] figure out amen am our brains are not
[1:20:56] going to figure out that our years of
[1:20:58] experience are not going to figure this
[1:20:59] out our knowledge of of quotes are not
[1:21:02] going to figure this out it's going to
[1:21:03] take the direct leadership of the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost brother venam tolds that man your
[1:21:10] wife you said she was a saint she looks
[1:21:12] more like a hint to me I mean if I was
[1:21:15] standing there when he said that I would
[1:21:16] have found some excuse to walk
[1:21:19] away it's just me I would have blushed I
[1:21:23] would have walked away and and thinking
[1:21:25] my goodness how could he say something
[1:21:27] like
[1:21:30] that there was things brother Bram said
[1:21:32] they're in marriage and
[1:21:35] divorce that I don't know that I could
[1:21:37] ever say over a
[1:21:39] pullit describing a woman of the world
[1:21:41] and how low she can be and the names he
[1:21:45] used was it right or was it
[1:21:49] wrong was he right was it the anointing
[1:21:52] of the Holy Ghost or was he wrong
[1:21:56] what if somebody else comes and does
[1:21:58] that are they right or are they
[1:22:00] wrong it's a good
[1:22:03] question I personally am tired of being
[1:22:05] a know- it
[1:22:07] all I want to go back to being a know
[1:22:11] nothing I want to go back to the
[1:22:13] security of just trusting God saying God
[1:22:16] I don't have it figured out I'm
[1:22:17] uncomfortable with this I'm not going
[1:22:19] down that path but I don't know I'm not
[1:22:20] touching it I'm letting you sort it all
[1:22:22] out yeah amen
[1:22:25] here's another
[1:22:28] one brother manam says here some time
[1:22:31] ago a man met me out here aside I had a
[1:22:35] Pianist here had a little uh had a
[1:22:37] little short little skirt and wasn't
[1:22:39] just exactly I guess just right and the
[1:22:42] lady had short hair and she was just a
[1:22:44] babe in this way and she was playing the
[1:22:46] piano and a man met me out there just
[1:22:49] tearing me to Pieces said and you're a
[1:22:51] Pentecostal preacher and let that woman
[1:22:53] sit up there with short hair and just
[1:22:54] going on like that everything well I
[1:22:56] said I think the woman has a good spirit
[1:22:58] in her I certainly do not agree with
[1:23:00] that you know I don't agree and he says
[1:23:04] and I think that any woman now he comes
[1:23:07] down a little bit later in the quote I
[1:23:08] think that any woman that's motherly and
[1:23:10] godly and a sisterly ought to go to such
[1:23:13] a person and with sweetness of the
[1:23:15] spirit just sit down and talk to that
[1:23:17] lady and if she's of God the holy spirit
[1:23:19] will understand those things and she'll
[1:23:21] correct herself but when you really
[1:23:23] quickly condemn her and drive her away
[1:23:25] you might harm that Young born baby see
[1:23:28] I wouldn't condemn the
[1:23:30] person God so there brother brandham was
[1:23:33] even allowing a Woman Who Wasn't dressed
[1:23:35] right with short hair playing the piano
[1:23:38] somebody condemned him but he says but
[1:23:40] she's got a good spirit she's just a
[1:23:41] baby in the way and I wouldn't condemn
[1:23:43] her or harm her and then he talks to the
[1:23:45] man whose wife was playing the piano
[1:23:47] with makeup and jewelry and he said
[1:23:49] she's a ha
[1:23:52] yeah you see the circumstance are
[1:23:54] totally
[1:23:56] different and the response is dictated
[1:23:58] by the circumstances and by the
[1:24:00] leadership of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:24:01] Bram didn't want to discourage that
[1:24:03] newborn baby he wanted her to learn he
[1:24:05] wanted her to be right but he didn't
[1:24:06] want to discourage her when the other
[1:24:09] one was the uh a minister's wife who had
[1:24:11] been who knows how long in the church
[1:24:13] should have known
[1:24:14] better to everything there is a season
[1:24:17] and a time a time to speak and a time to
[1:24:20] refrain from
[1:24:22] speaking so you just go and figure out
[1:24:25] when to speak and when to
[1:24:27] refrain and you let me know how it
[1:24:30] goes you tell me when to answer a fool
[1:24:33] according to his folly and then tell me
[1:24:35] when not to answer a fool according to
[1:24:37] his
[1:24:39] folly you know what's shameful some of
[1:24:42] you are in the room right now trying to
[1:24:43] figure the answer to that question
[1:24:45] thinking well in this circumstance or in
[1:24:48] give it up just quit just
[1:24:52] stop and recognize this isn't an
[1:24:54] intellectual exercise this isn't years
[1:24:57] experience this is the leadership of the
[1:24:59] Holy Ghost memorizing scriptures won't
[1:25:02] solve this problem it's going to take
[1:25:04] the spirit of God directing our mouths
[1:25:06] directing our mind moving Us by his
[1:25:09] Spirit that's the only thing that's
[1:25:10] going to
[1:25:14] work brother Bram said in the paman
[1:25:16] church age said those in the bride do
[1:25:19] only his
[1:25:21] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:25:24] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:25:26] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:25:28] God in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:25:30] his own word he did not complete all his
[1:25:32] work while in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:25:34] now he works in and through the bride
[1:25:36] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:25:39] for him to do certain things that he
[1:25:40] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:25:43] through the bride that work which he
[1:25:45] left for this specific time amen so is
[1:25:48] God going to work in and through the
[1:25:50] bride absolutely how is that going to
[1:25:52] happen she will do only his will amen
[1:25:56] we've got to get to a place where he's
[1:25:57] got preeminence and we absolutely
[1:25:59] surrender our thinking our feelings amen
[1:26:01] there's been times you you've been there
[1:26:03] too many of us we've been times where
[1:26:05] God is moving us to say something to
[1:26:07] somebody and it's like a pushing force
[1:26:09] behind you and you do not want to say
[1:26:13] it you do not want to question the
[1:26:15] brother or sister or or tell them that
[1:26:17] you disagree or or something said in a
[1:26:20] in a conversation and you want so bad to
[1:26:22] let it go cuz it's against your person
[1:26:24] personality you don't want to create a
[1:26:25] fuss you don't want to hurt their
[1:26:27] feelings but there's something driving
[1:26:28] you inside and and something saying say
[1:26:31] it say it say it and and you have no
[1:26:34] option but to say it Hey listen that's
[1:26:36] where we've got to be under absolute
[1:26:38] control where he has
[1:26:42] preeminence there's been times in the
[1:26:44] pull pit where I've had that same thing
[1:26:46] something inside of me a voice saying
[1:26:47] say it say it and I'm swallowing it down
[1:26:50] and swallowing it down and swallowing it
[1:26:53] down cuz I don't want to say say
[1:26:55] it and shamefully there's been times I
[1:26:58] was too afraid to say it and had to
[1:26:59] repent
[1:27:01] afterwards because I failed
[1:27:03] God because of my personality my fear of
[1:27:07] hurting
[1:27:08] feelings yes we may have to get beyond
[1:27:11] our personalities and our fear of
[1:27:13] hurting feelings we may have to get
[1:27:16] beyond our concept of what is
[1:27:18] appropriate and not
[1:27:20] appropriate our own concept remember we
[1:27:23] all have our own concept
[1:27:27] maybe we need to be
[1:27:31] completely totally dependent on God Amen
[1:27:35] for
[1:27:37] everything brother benam says now here
[1:27:41] you are a person I'm preaching the word
[1:27:43] saying that he is not dead he's alive
[1:27:45] he's alive and promised to identify
[1:27:48] himself in our flesh human flesh like he
[1:27:50] did back there all that God was he
[1:27:53] poured into Christ
[1:27:55] did we see it
[1:27:56] manifest he was the lamb who acted like
[1:28:00] a lion in the temple who acted like the
[1:28:03] eagle who we saw all that God was he
[1:28:07] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:28:10] was he poured into the church that's him
[1:28:13] Christ in us and he wants to be
[1:28:16] expressed just like he was 2,000 years
[1:28:20] ago amen where does he want to be
[1:28:21] expressed he wants to be expressed in
[1:28:23] you and in me
[1:28:25] what's it going to take preeminence amen
[1:28:29] Lord I've decided that I want to express
[1:28:31] you this
[1:28:33] way I want to I want to marry the the
[1:28:37] young couples bury the dead kiss the
[1:28:39] babies that's the way I want to express
[1:28:42] you I want to always be friendly always
[1:28:44] be nice don't ever use me for correction
[1:28:48] I don't want to do that don't ever use
[1:28:50] me to take a stand at work I don't want
[1:28:52] to do that either I only want to be used
[1:28:54] like
[1:28:57] this I don't think that's the way it
[1:29:00] should
[1:29:03] be he says in the invisible Union of the
[1:29:05] bride of Christ life is in the grain
[1:29:07] again what is it just exactly like the
[1:29:09] same grain that went in the ground the
[1:29:11] same Jesus in The Bride form same power
[1:29:14] same church same thing same word the
[1:29:17] same word sucked up through these and
[1:29:19] come out here and come to a head here
[1:29:21] and all that life that come through here
[1:29:23] through the church age
[1:29:24] all that life that come through here
[1:29:25] picked up its people and now it's
[1:29:27] forming into the head for a Rapture what
[1:29:30] is it the same Jesus in Bride form that
[1:29:33] means all the power all the anointing
[1:29:36] all the demonstration it's all here
[1:29:39] amen then he says in Christ is the
[1:29:41] mystery of God revealed he said Satan
[1:29:43] said oh but she turned around and
[1:29:46] listened to him but that even the last
[1:29:49] day is not going to do it because she's
[1:29:52] predestinated not to do it yes God's
[1:29:54] going to do it he knows he'll have it he
[1:29:56] said church with will be there withouts
[1:29:59] spot or wrinkle she's going to stand
[1:30:01] there in the Splendor of him his word
[1:30:04] made
[1:30:05] manifest she'll be a token to the world
[1:30:08] Amen why because it was his word his
[1:30:10] mind his idea his desire his expression
[1:30:14] through
[1:30:17] me
[1:30:19] amen now I want to come back to the lamb
[1:30:24] he's a lamb we have to be a lamb I think
[1:30:28] sometimes in our own thinking we think
[1:30:30] well you have to have a lamb nature well
[1:30:31] if you have a lamb nature then you don't
[1:30:33] ever say anything rough if you have a
[1:30:36] lamb nature you never stand against
[1:30:39] anything you're just Meek and get pushed
[1:30:41] that's not
[1:30:42] Christianity that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:30:46] all those other four anointings are
[1:30:47] mixed in the lamb the lamb is the
[1:30:50] fullness the lamb was Jesus Christ the
[1:30:52] Lamb of God and in him was all that
[1:30:55] manifestation and we saw it in the
[1:30:57] prophet in our day what do you think
[1:30:59] we'll see in our day I have to be a
[1:31:00] lamb's wife I just have to be super nice
[1:31:02] to everybody and really sweet and no
[1:31:04] matter what's said right or wrong and no
[1:31:06] correction
[1:31:08] no my goodness you know what will happen
[1:31:10] to us if we stay there we'll be off the
[1:31:12] word in no time amen but sometimes he's
[1:31:15] got to come like a lion and stand for
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] word sometimes you got to come with a
[1:31:20] man and take the scriptures and expose
[1:31:22] the evil and and and totally pull it
[1:31:25] apart sometimes he comes as the ox where
[1:31:28] we just suffer and let it go because
[1:31:30] that's the right thing to do right there
[1:31:33] sometimes the eagle comes and can see
[1:31:35] from the end to the beginning of this
[1:31:37] situation and it's all got to be the
[1:31:40] bride but she has to be the lamb right
[1:31:43] so then I started really thinking what
[1:31:44] does it mean to be a lamb maybe it's so
[1:31:46] much more complex than what I thought I
[1:31:48] thought if she's a lamb she's just going
[1:31:49] to be I mean just just kind of there
[1:31:54] say anything not do anything but that's
[1:31:55] not the way he was when he was the lamb
[1:31:58] and it's the continuation of his
[1:32:00] ministry right and what was poured into
[1:32:02] him he's now poured himself into us so
[1:32:05] what should it look like it might look
[1:32:07] like what it looked like when he was
[1:32:09] here it might look like what it looked
[1:32:11] like in the prophet of the age who was
[1:32:12] under the eagle anointing but exhibited
[1:32:14] all the
[1:32:16] anointings maybe it's going to look the
[1:32:18] same way so what makes her a
[1:32:22] lamb we go back to the Token
[1:32:26] message Jesus was baptized by John and
[1:32:30] the Bible said and he saw the spirit of
[1:32:31] God like a dove coming down upon
[1:32:34] him therefore if if it would have been a
[1:32:37] wolf or if it would have been any other
[1:32:39] animal the nature of the dove could not
[1:32:40] have blended with the nature of the wolf
[1:32:43] neither could the nature of the dove
[1:32:45] blend with any other animal but the
[1:32:48] lamb and those two Natures come together
[1:32:51] then they could agree with each other
[1:32:55] further down in the token he says what
[1:32:57] if the dove had come down instead of
[1:32:58] being a lamb there would have been some
[1:33:00] other animal like a
[1:33:02] lion a man an
[1:33:08] eagle I hope you catch just stay you may
[1:33:11] not catch it but you will stay with
[1:33:14] me it would have quickly took its flight
[1:33:16] and went back but when he found that
[1:33:19] nature that he could blend into it just
[1:33:22] became one
[1:33:24] then the dove led the lamb and notice it
[1:33:28] led the lamb to slaughter now the lamb
[1:33:31] was obedient to the dove no matter where
[1:33:33] it led it was willing to go
[1:33:37] amen what makes her a lamb like he was a
[1:33:40] lamb because she never raises her voice
[1:33:43] she never criticizes anybody she never
[1:33:45] brings a correction she that's not what
[1:33:47] makes her a lamb what makes her a lamb
[1:33:50] is because wherever the dove leads she
[1:33:52] humbly follows amen she doesn't snarl
[1:33:56] she doesn't growl she's Meek and humble
[1:33:59] to the dove amen that's what makes her a
[1:34:04] lamb Matthew 4:1 says then was Jesus led
[1:34:07] up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to
[1:34:09] be tempted of the devil what made Jesus
[1:34:12] a lamb wasn't that he didn't speak out
[1:34:14] against evil that he didn't correct the
[1:34:16] wrong that he didn't call the phes a den
[1:34:18] of Thieves and he didn't call them
[1:34:19] whiteed seers and and he and he called
[1:34:22] them of their father the devil it wasn't
[1:34:24] because he was a lamb that he was so
[1:34:26] quiet no he was a lamb because the lamb
[1:34:29] was totally submissive to the father and
[1:34:31] he was led like a lamb by the dove which
[1:34:34] was the spirit of God and he followed
[1:34:36] like a lamb follows the dove that's what
[1:34:39] made him a
[1:34:41] lamb and what will make his wife a lamb
[1:34:44] because she has the same nature he has
[1:34:47] the same thing was in him now he's
[1:34:49] poured himself into her it's the same
[1:34:51] Jesus now in Bride form doing the same
[1:34:54] acting the same the same word this is
[1:34:56] what the prophet told us and now what
[1:34:58] will distinguish the lamb and make her
[1:35:01] Mrs lamb what will make her a lamb also
[1:35:04] is because she'll follow the
[1:35:09] dove brother brandham preached a
[1:35:13] message on the wings of a snow white
[1:35:15] dove and in that message he was
[1:35:18] preaching about going to Sabino Canyon
[1:35:20] and having the sword put in his hand and
[1:35:22] then 3 days later he said he went down
[1:35:24] another Trail and the Lord told him to
[1:35:25] lay his hands on a rock and he was bare
[1:35:27] chested had no shirt on and and and the
[1:35:29] Lord spoke to him and said what's that
[1:35:30] under your heart and he set back and in
[1:35:32] white quarts was written the word
[1:35:34] Eagle in white quarts and here's what he
[1:35:38] says I want you to catch what he says I
[1:35:40] was so excited I run home I got a camera
[1:35:43] and I came back the next day and took
[1:35:45] the picture of it I was still it still
[1:35:47] there wrote In The Rock White Eagle Dove
[1:35:50] leading
[1:35:51] Eagle why because the the dove leted him
[1:35:54] down the right path both days and the
[1:35:56] dove was leading the eagle and he comes
[1:35:58] further down in his prayer at the end of
[1:36:00] the service he said dear God I thank you
[1:36:02] for these things father you give Noah
[1:36:04] the sign you gave the world the sign and
[1:36:07] you gave me a sign and the next day
[1:36:09] seeing that eagle flying oh God there's
[1:36:11] a message coming forth now and I pray
[1:36:14] God that you'll let the dove lead
[1:36:16] granted Lord It's led me to Faith I
[1:36:19] never had
[1:36:20] before the dove leading the eagle
[1:36:24] think about this look at the contrast
[1:36:26] and the character of these two
[1:36:28] birds the eagle is an aggressive bird it
[1:36:32] rips it tears it it flies solo it's
[1:36:35] independent it's aggressive it's a
[1:36:37] killer yeah
[1:36:41] right it's got to be led by the dove
[1:36:44] amen or else it'll go
[1:36:48] wrong what do you think leads the
[1:36:51] lion the dove what do you think leads
[1:36:54] the ox the dove what do you think leads
[1:36:58] the man the dove if you isolate any one
[1:37:01] of these anointings and try to operate
[1:37:03] in that anointing without the leading of
[1:37:04] the dove you'll destroy somebody's life
[1:37:08] you say this is I'm just under a line
[1:37:09] anointing if you're not being led by the
[1:37:11] dove and you take and add and mix your
[1:37:13] own personality in with that you'll
[1:37:15] destroy somebody acting like an apostle
[1:37:17] somebody who's got the word and an
[1:37:19] authority on the word and you'll start a
[1:37:20] whole new segment of unbelief amen you
[1:37:23] take the man's annoying say I'm a
[1:37:24] teacher and I've got this figured out
[1:37:26] and I can put this together but you're
[1:37:27] not being led by the dove I mean you'll
[1:37:29] absolutely sww the wrong seed into the
[1:37:31] people's hearts you do the same thing
[1:37:33] I'm under the eagle anointing we're
[1:37:34] Eagle people we ate the book to prophesy
[1:37:37] again that's absolutely the truth this
[1:37:39] bride is under an eagle anointing she
[1:37:41] must prophesy again but only by the
[1:37:44] leading of the
[1:37:45] dove the white dove leading the eagle
[1:37:48] not not her own thinging not saying
[1:37:50] we're Eagles and I just blasted
[1:37:53] yeah I stood down there in the corner of
[1:37:55] the Baptist Church and everyone that
[1:37:57] came out I told
[1:38:00] him did the dove lead you
[1:38:03] there and did the dove say condemn and
[1:38:10] criticize there are times the dove will
[1:38:12] lead you to
[1:38:14] speak and most of the time when you
[1:38:16] don't want to speak right when you can't
[1:38:18] wait to say it it's probably a good
[1:38:19] indication you shouldn't amen next time
[1:38:23] I the first open door
[1:38:30] I what makes her a lamb like he's a
[1:38:34] lamb not our own ideas get those ideas
[1:38:38] out of our
[1:38:42] head the fful ministry is the ministry
[1:38:46] of the Lamb it's the Min Ministry of
[1:38:48] Christ but it comes under individual
[1:38:52] anointings if the the Evangelist is just
[1:38:54] raking you over the coals does it mean
[1:38:56] it's not the spirit of Christ working
[1:38:58] through him that's not the lamb the lamb
[1:39:01] doesn't talk that way well ask the
[1:39:03] Pharisees if the lamb talks that
[1:39:06] way go ask Peter if the lamb ever talks
[1:39:11] that way when Peter turned when God
[1:39:13] turned around to Peter when Jesus turned
[1:39:15] around Peter and said get thee behind me
[1:39:17] Satan
[1:39:19] amen you tell me if the lamb ever talks
[1:39:22] that way or not go back and read the
[1:39:25] gospels the bride shouldn't this and we
[1:39:27] shouldn't that we should we should do
[1:39:29] exactly as the dove leads us to
[1:39:33] do there's a time for
[1:39:36] everything a time to speak and a time to
[1:39:39] refrain from speaking a time to Rend and
[1:39:43] a time to sew that was render a time to
[1:39:47] plant and a time to pluck out what's
[1:39:49] been
[1:39:50] planted guess what God sends the right
[1:39:52] anointing by the leadership of the dove
[1:39:55] to meet every need in our lives and as
[1:39:58] we walk in this earth in this end time
[1:40:00] May that Dove lead us may we be the lamb
[1:40:05] led by the dove little lambs the Bride
[1:40:08] of Jesus Christ led by the same Dove
[1:40:11] that led our Prophet by the same Dove
[1:40:13] that led Jesus Christ Our
[1:40:16] husband and let's not criticize each
[1:40:19] other
[1:40:20] anymore if there's a problem and you
[1:40:22] think somebody was too rough or too just
[1:40:24] go talk to him about it just go tell
[1:40:27] them hey I don't understand why you said
[1:40:29] that or did that or and you may find out
[1:40:31] that they didn't want to do that they
[1:40:33] did it because they felt like the Lord
[1:40:34] wanted them to do that and then you can
[1:40:37] still be confused about it and you can
[1:40:38] still not feel right about it but I
[1:40:40] would I would advise you not to speak
[1:40:42] against
[1:40:43] it unless it's off the
[1:40:47] word let's go to Romans 8 I want to
[1:40:49] finish with Romans 8
[1:41:01] Romans chapter
[1:41:05] 8 verse
[1:41:08] 14 for as many as are led by the spirit
[1:41:11] of God they are the sons of
[1:41:15] God you know what we need more than
[1:41:17] anything in the world is the leadership
[1:41:20] of the
[1:41:21] dove we need need God more than we
[1:41:24] needed him ever before we need him every
[1:41:27] moment of Our Lives I need that little
[1:41:29] buzzer that was in brother Brandon when
[1:41:31] he started the rail against that man and
[1:41:32] he felt that that wasn't right and
[1:41:33] stopped right then and said he that that
[1:41:36] didn't please him he didn't like that I
[1:41:38] got to have that in my life I'm begging
[1:41:41] for God to put that in Greater measure
[1:41:42] in my life I'm not going to make it on
[1:41:44] my own I can't take my own idea or my
[1:41:46] own leadership I can't take just every
[1:41:48] inspiration I fall under cuz you get
[1:41:50] with different Brothers you'll get
[1:41:51] different Inspirations I need the
[1:41:53] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:41:55] leadership of the dove to come and make
[1:41:57] me match his desire for me that moment
[1:42:01] and what he had me do in the last time I
[1:42:03] was in this situation may not be what he
[1:42:04] has me do the next time I'm in the
[1:42:06] situation I need the
[1:42:09] dove we need the dove we come to a time
[1:42:12] of desperation friends where where we
[1:42:14] should be fearful to make a move without
[1:42:16] God's leadership in our
[1:42:20] lives there's no textbook
[1:42:23] there's no manual no Creed what what are
[1:42:28] we going to
[1:42:30] do answer not a
[1:42:32] fool according to his
[1:42:35] folly next verse answer a fool according
[1:42:38] to his
[1:42:41] foly when do I do
[1:42:44] which just as he
[1:42:49] leads every circumstance is different
[1:42:52] God is trying to accomplish something
[1:42:54] different through each
[1:42:56] one sometimes maybe if I answered that
[1:42:58] fool according to his folly he would
[1:43:00] just take me down a path of folly and I
[1:43:01] would become like him there's no good
[1:43:04] but maybe that poor man's caught in
[1:43:07] foolishness and God wants to open his
[1:43:08] eyes now I answer a fool according to
[1:43:11] his folly that he wouldn't be deceived
[1:43:13] by his own
[1:43:15] conceit God knows what will work and
[1:43:17] what won't work yeah amen says cast not
[1:43:20] your Pearls Before Swine for they
[1:43:22] trample Under Foot and turn and ren you
[1:43:23] how do I know if they're swine or not
[1:43:27] swine well brother Chad if you use this
[1:43:30] formula and you if you watch you can
[1:43:34] tell really we're going to go back to
[1:43:36] that kind of
[1:43:37] nonsense I saw their eyes and when they
[1:43:40] resisted
[1:43:43] I I don't know I haven't got it figured
[1:43:46] out and every time I thought I did I
[1:43:49] embarrassed
[1:43:50] myself thank you God that embarrassed
[1:43:53] myself thank you God that he let me get
[1:43:56] embarrassed and he let me fail so that I
[1:43:58] stopped trusting in my own
[1:44:01] inspiration I want the dove to lead this
[1:44:06] lamb I want to be a lamb not not that I
[1:44:09] am afraid to speak When God says speak I
[1:44:11] want to speak when he says speak when he
[1:44:14] wants me to correct I want to correct
[1:44:15] when he wants me to console I want to
[1:44:17] console when he wants me to smooth it
[1:44:19] over I want to smooth it over when he
[1:44:20] wants me to Bear it I want to Bear it I
[1:44:21] want to do whatever he want wants me to
[1:44:23] do but I cannot in myself figure out
[1:44:26] what I'm supposed to do
[1:44:29] intellectually I want to be a lamb and
[1:44:32] be led by the dove and if he wants to
[1:44:35] anoint me as a lion and say something
[1:44:37] I'll say it if he wants to anoint me as
[1:44:39] an eagle to expose him I'll expose it if
[1:44:41] he wants me just to Bear it I'll bear it
[1:44:43] but it's going to have to be his
[1:44:44] anointing in me and his leadership under
[1:44:46] that anointing or else I'm going to get
[1:44:49] embarrassed again I'm going to hurt
[1:44:51] somebody
[1:44:53] what makes her this is just me friends
[1:44:56] what makes her a lamb what makes her a
[1:44:58] lamb is not because she is this syrupy
[1:45:01] sweet and always nice and everybody's
[1:45:03] always okay and we're all one that's not
[1:45:05] what makes through a lamb what makes
[1:45:07] through a lamb is she's led by the
[1:45:11] dove and she's totally submissive to the
[1:45:15] leadership of the Holy Ghost to me
[1:45:18] that's what makes her a lamb cuz that's
[1:45:20] what made Christ a lamb and she's
[1:45:23] willing to surrender her thoughts her
[1:45:25] dreams her Ambitions her ideas her
[1:45:29] Creeds and lay it all down to follow the
[1:45:32] dove even if it leads us into the
[1:45:34] Wilderness to be tempted by the devil
[1:45:36] the lamb follows the
[1:45:39] dove amen let's all stand
[1:45:44] together I've said it many times and
[1:45:47] I'll say it again and I'll say it
[1:45:48] probably for the rest of my days on this
[1:45:50] Earth but this this message is no
[1:45:54] joke this isn't a formula this isn't
[1:45:57] Church
[1:45:59] attendance this isn't a new set of
[1:46:01] doctrines this is literally the life of
[1:46:04] Jesus Christ to be display in people on
[1:46:06] the Earth people who take the nature of
[1:46:09] the Lamb people who follow the
[1:46:11] leadership of the dove it's got to come
[1:46:13] to full manifestation and he's
[1:46:15] prophesied it will in this day and he
[1:46:17] sent everything we need for it to
[1:46:19] manifest his word is here in full
[1:46:21] measure his spirit's returned measure
[1:46:23] Christ himself is here to take his bride
[1:46:25] by the hand and walk her all the way
[1:46:27] home what does he need he needs somebody
[1:46:29] willing to give it all up and surrender
[1:46:31] and take the nature of a lamb and follow
[1:46:34] him amen that's what I want I know
[1:46:38] that's what you want amen let's bow our
[1:46:40] heads together and pray dear heavenly
[1:46:43] father I thank you Lord God we
