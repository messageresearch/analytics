[7:46] already and there's many demands upon

[7:50] as the monday begins to encroach
[7:53] lord may we just again set everything

[8:20] felt may your word have preeminence
[8:21] bless your people we pray the name lord
[8:23] jesus christ amen
[8:26] amen i'm just going to read again from
[8:27] revelations chapter 10
[8:30] verses 8 to 11.
[8:32] revelations chapter 10
[8:35] and verses 8 to 11.
[8:37] again i want to reiterate it's a
[8:39] wonderful privilege to be together with
[8:40] you we've enjoyed the fellowship we've
[8:42] had
[8:43] through the years and brother chad and i
[8:45] were
[8:46] fellowshipping on one of the first times
[8:48] i ever preached here at your church
[8:50] and
[8:52] he remembers it maybe a little bit
[8:53] differently than i do but he remembers
[8:55] that i was preaching a sermon i was just
[8:57] a young
[8:58] really really young
[8:59] almost 20 years ago maybe
[9:01] um and i was talking about the rivalry
[9:04] between coke
[9:05] and pepsi and then he says that i said
[9:08] but dr pepper's the right one baby
[9:11] uh-huh
[9:12] and uh
[9:14] i uh
[9:16] i don't know that i said that but i'm
[9:19] i'm i'm pretty sure i said dr pepper's
[9:21] the right choice
[9:23] but it just shows how revelation strikes
[9:25] and stimulation
[9:26] and i could say dr pepper's the right
[9:29] choice and he's like amen uh-huh baby
[9:33] you know so
[9:35] and it's just how it's just how it works
[9:38] um but we've uh we've always um had a
[9:41] you've had a special place in our heart
[9:43] we appreciate the opportunity to be here
[9:44] together with you and so if i hit myself
[9:47] a little bit between services to get
[9:49] ready it's because boy you can just feel
[9:50] the uh the pressure and the burden of
[9:52] the word comes upon your heart so we
[9:54] just wanted to steal away and be sure
[9:56] that we are ready for this afternoon
[9:58] service may god bless you hope to shake
[10:00] your hands if we don't get the
[10:01] opportunity we love you very much if
[10:03] anything other than the word comes
[10:04] across i want you to know that we love
[10:06] you and that you can sense that um in in
[10:09] our service to you revelations chapter
[10:11] 10
[10:12] verses 8 to 11 and the voice which i
[10:13] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[10:15] and said go and take the little book
[10:17] which is open in the hand of the angel
[10:19] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[10:21] earth
[10:21] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[10:23] him give me the little book
[10:25] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[10:27] up
[10:28] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[10:30] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[10:33] and i took the little book out of the
[10:35] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[10:38] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[10:40] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[10:42] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[10:44] before many peoples and nations and
[10:46] tongues and kings amen you may be seated
[10:50] i'm just going to continue on the
[10:52] subject of bittersweet and
[10:55] it i will admit that to me it's a little
[10:57] unique how the lord's impressed some of
[10:59] these details on my heart but we just we
[11:02] know that if we're faithful to deliver
[11:05] what he burdens us with and there's a
[11:06] blessing for you in it and for myself
[11:09] likewise
[11:10] but verse 11 says thou must prophesy
[11:12] again before many peoples and nations
[11:14] and tongues and kings we looked at how
[11:16] the bride is the voice of god or she is
[11:19] his voice his body performing his works
[11:21] on earth bill abraham said she is him so
[11:24] this is the ministry of jesus christ on
[11:26] earth in physical form
[11:29] and what we were looking at this morning
[11:30] is how there's a conditioned precedent a
[11:32] condition that must be fulfilled an
[11:34] event or a state of affairs that must
[11:36] occur before she can fully manifest him
[11:40] so she's not just anointed to be him and
[11:42] just overnight she changes into this uh
[11:44] this uh image of christ and this great
[11:47] manifestation and the mystery of christ
[11:49] and the ministry of christ but rather
[11:50] the word of god brings her through a
[11:52] process there has to be something
[11:54] happening beforehand we called it a
[11:56] conditioned precedent before this before
[11:58] this
[11:59] ability to fully manifest christ occurs
[12:02] and we see this
[12:03] in verses 9 and 10 as the angel said
[12:05] take the book and eat it up and tells
[12:08] them when you eat it it's going to make
[12:09] your belly bitter but it'll be sweet in
[12:11] your mouth and so john describes it how
[12:14] he experiences it first he says i took
[12:16] the book and i ate it up and it was in
[12:18] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[12:20] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[12:23] and we know that we must take all the
[12:24] book and eat it just not part of it we
[12:26] want to take all the book and eat it and
[12:28] it must be sweet in our mouth
[12:30] if it's not sweet in your mouth you
[12:32] won't want any more of it you won't come
[12:33] back to that well you won't partake of
[12:35] it and so i believe to the believer the
[12:37] word is sweet in their mouth i believe
[12:39] it's something that doesn't grow old and
[12:41] you just think there's people in this
[12:43] congregation right now who've been
[12:45] listening to the same sermons you've
[12:46] been listening to for 40 or 50 years
[12:49] been listening to it there's some who
[12:51] are still today listening to the tapes
[12:54] and they were in the meetings why
[12:55] because it's sweet to them it doesn't
[12:57] get old it's a voice that thrills them
[12:59] it's a message that excites them and
[13:01] they just listen to it over and over
[13:03] again it's must be sweet in our mouth
[13:05] but it also must become bitter in our
[13:06] bellies
[13:07] and brother branham showed us how that
[13:09] that bitterness in john's belly was when
[13:11] you digest it and when you digest it
[13:14] that's when you fully begin to
[13:15] understand it you fully begin to
[13:16] comprehend it becomes a part of your
[13:18] person and there's a consequence for
[13:20] digesting this book there's a there's a
[13:22] bitterness that comes when that word
[13:24] strikes deep in your belly and some read
[13:26] the scripture and they say well there's
[13:28] blessings in the book and there's
[13:29] cursings in the book and john was it was
[13:32] sweet to see all the power and glory
[13:33] that would be in the church but it was
[13:35] sad to see all the persecutions and that
[13:37] that type certainly exists but us as
[13:39] individuals we take this book so there's
[13:42] something sweet to us and there's a
[13:43] bitterness that also comes when you
[13:45] digest this book
[13:47] and so the the condition proceeding it's
[13:49] not just a sweet taste in the mouth but
[13:51] it's a bitterness in the belly and we
[13:53] mentioned just briefly how that
[13:54] bitterness means a harshness or a
[13:56] piercing and the belly speaks of a womb
[13:58] or even a stomach so there's a piercing
[14:00] and a harshness that comes with the
[14:02] sweetness
[14:04] and this is and i know it's review and
[14:06] some of you are saying man this we just
[14:07] heard this this morning but i'm saying
[14:09] this just by chance maybe someone showed
[14:10] up this afternoon and wasn't here this
[14:12] morning i know brother daniel ratliff
[14:14] said he was coming a pastor there near
[14:16] ann arbor in brighton and he desired
[14:18] just to be in fellowship with you
[14:19] tonight and said he was on his way down
[14:20] so i'm not sure if he's here yet he told
[14:22] me to take my time
[14:24] so that if he's a little late i still
[14:26] have
[14:27] still have more to go and i just try to
[14:28] please everybody so i i just feel pulled
[14:30] but none of you who wanted me to be
[14:32] short said anything
[14:33] so
[14:34] don't say it now don't say it now
[14:37] but the part that's really uh impressed
[14:40] upon me is how the bitter belly
[14:42] represents the consequence for eating
[14:44] the word and that it's uh it's the
[14:47] i don't want to say say the negative
[14:48] side but it's the hard part the
[14:50] difficult side the difficult things that
[14:52] come with the word there's a lot of
[14:54] glory a lot of praise a lot of wonderful
[14:55] things but what comes with it is that
[14:57] bitter part
[14:59] and so we must we must eat it till it
[15:00] hurts
[15:01] not just sympathize with the message not
[15:03] just believe it not just kind of be a
[15:05] you know a believer a closet believer we
[15:08] don't want anybody to know but we must
[15:09] believe it live it manifest it till it
[15:11] hurts
[15:12] and the bitter part has a purpose to it
[15:15] it's not just merely to make you hurt
[15:16] and make you feel pain and to make you
[15:18] suffer but suffering brings forth
[15:20] perfect character and that god has a
[15:22] purpose and a reason for things
[15:24] otherwise he would be the author of
[15:25] frustration and not of peace so he has a
[15:28] he desires that there would be a perfect
[15:30] work that would be undertaken in your
[15:32] life and so the bitter parts to produce
[15:34] the humility
[15:35] it's there to produce a meekness not a
[15:37] roughness not an exterior of someone
[15:38] who's been hurt a lot and people who
[15:40] would draw themselves and they go into a
[15:42] shell but it's a to produce a humility
[15:44] and a meekness so that the power of god
[15:46] can work freely in the proper vessel
[15:49] the word bittersweet it means pleasure
[15:50] accompanied by suffering
[15:52] and so there's a there's a pleasure that
[15:54] we experience with the word of god but
[15:56] there's also a suffering that we
[15:58] experience in so eating the book
[15:59] produces power and glory and we can say
[16:01] amen to them it produces power and glory
[16:04] but it also produces humility and
[16:05] suffering so that that power and glory
[16:08] could be the right expression of christ
[16:10] and and i want to read a statement now
[16:13] and kind of just picking up where i left
[16:15] off this morning
[16:16] and if i could say this the power and
[16:18] glory of christ can only be achieved
[16:20] through the humility and suffering of
[16:21] christ
[16:22] he was who he was because of what he
[16:24] obeyed and what he did and what he went
[16:26] through and so there's a similar path he
[16:28] laid for us an example that we should
[16:30] follow in his steps is what the
[16:31] scripture says
[16:33] and the in the message
[16:34] desperations and it just even the
[16:36] subject matter for you message believers
[16:39] you know he preached desperation the
[16:40] night after he preached the token so
[16:42] he's continuing on the thought of the
[16:44] token the type of the exodus and and a
[16:47] translation of a bride as he uses the
[16:49] the
[16:50] first token as an example and then when
[16:52] he preaches desperation he adds this
[16:54] element and layer to it that there's got
[16:56] to be some some desperation in your
[16:58] heart there's got to be some sense of
[17:00] urgency and you have to really be
[17:01] serious about what we're doing because
[17:03] you can't just eat it
[17:05] they said they had to eat in haste they
[17:06] had to have the shoes on they they ate
[17:08] it like we're going on a journey they
[17:09] just weren't kicking back wearing
[17:11] whatever they wanted to wear cook it
[17:13] however you want to cook it have the
[17:14] house wherever you want to have it no
[17:16] those elements of the first exodus were
[17:18] written for our example that how we
[17:20] dress matters what we eat matters and
[17:22] all these different things it all
[17:23] matters i mean how it was cooked
[17:25] mattered you couldn't just take the lamb
[17:27] i want it medium rare make sure you cook
[17:29] it with this make sure you cook oh make
[17:30] a good mutton curry mama that'll be
[17:32] really really good no you had to do it a
[17:34] particular way otherwise it was no
[17:36] benefit to you
[17:38] and so he adds this this layer test
[17:40] there's got to be a desperation and what
[17:42] usually causes desperation is crisis
[17:45] what usually causes desperation when
[17:47] there's a real need it's life or death
[17:48] and you're not sure what you can do and
[17:50] i'm sure some of you have experienced it
[17:51] before when your life or death situation
[17:54] the sister wrote that testimony when
[17:55] that car just decided not to not to turn
[17:58] and it backslid and what did she she
[18:00] called on the lord there's desperation
[18:02] in that and you it's usually when you
[18:03] get right down to something in it and
[18:05] you're going through it it's some
[18:06] difficulty it's life or death or great
[18:08] loss you get desperate well brother
[18:10] branham brings this idea into view when
[18:12] he preaches desperation
[18:14] am i just listen to how rich these
[18:16] things are and now the entire holy
[18:19] spirit visits the church making god in
[18:21] human flesh
[18:24] i like that he says as he did before
[18:27] sodom so now we see luke 17 30 coming to
[18:29] view the burning there which was a type
[18:32] then abraham he appeared to him and all
[18:34] the things that he hasn't done down
[18:36] through the church ages in the through
[18:39] the ages in the church ages he is now
[18:41] doing
[18:42] so now he's doing something different
[18:45] what he's done through the church ages
[18:46] was one thing now he's doing something
[18:48] different because now the entire holy
[18:49] spirit visits the church making god in
[18:51] human flesh fulfilling luke 17 30. he
[18:53] says back to the word because the
[18:55] messages and the messages and the
[18:57] messages has to wind up in the entire
[19:00] word
[19:00] so the entire holy spirit the entire
[19:03] word is he's come to produce the
[19:05] entirety of the life god bless you with
[19:07] daniel he made it i was just kind of
[19:09] vamping here for a little while until
[19:10] you made it all right we can start now
[19:12] everybody ready
[19:13] praise the lord
[19:15] he says so he is now doing back to the
[19:18] word it has to wind up in the entire
[19:19] word and in the last days the seven
[19:22] seals being opened was to pick up every
[19:24] straggle that's been left off in it and
[19:27] make the whole thing in one great big
[19:29] body of the
[19:32] bride
[19:33] wow that we did it for you
[19:35] right now sister brenda lewis wrote that
[19:37] song he did it for me
[19:39] he did this for you
[19:41] that's why he did it he didn't do it
[19:42] just for him he didn't do that for the
[19:44] prophet so it could come together in a
[19:46] great big body of the bride that them
[19:48] who live back there were not perfect
[19:50] until this church be perfected this
[19:53] bride group in the last days to bring
[19:55] them in and all together be taken up so
[19:58] this is this is the this is the view
[19:59] that we're looking at this is wonderful
[20:01] he says the token jesus christ the holy
[20:04] spirit is amongst us he says we should
[20:06] reverence that
[20:09] we can't humble ourselves enough
[20:12] taking off your shoes or getting on your
[20:14] knees wouldn't expel it it wouldn't
[20:16] satisfy wouldn't suffice us but a life
[20:19] that brings forth the fruit of the
[20:20] spirit
[20:22] that's what will sacrifice that's what
[20:23] will satisfy in light of what he's done
[20:25] the entire holy spirit visiting the
[20:27] church making god in human flesh what
[20:29] he's doing now he hasn't done in the
[20:31] church ages it's back to the word to
[20:33] wind up in the entire world opening the
[20:35] seven seals to make the whole thing one
[20:37] great big body of the bride and he says
[20:40] we must reverence that
[20:42] this doesn't produce an arrogance he
[20:44] says we should humble ourselves we
[20:45] couldn't humble ourselves enough taking
[20:47] off your shoes get it on your knees
[20:48] nothing would satisfy you saying or
[20:50] suffice but a life that would bring
[20:52] forth that word
[20:54] a life that brings forth the fruit of
[20:55] the spirit
[20:57] and then he says in a few paragraphs
[20:59] later he says i truly believe that we're
[21:00] on the verge of one of those mightiest
[21:02] things that has ever struck the earth
[21:04] since the days of the lord jesus but now
[21:06] we can only be known as and he says
[21:08] it'll be so humble
[21:11] when man calls mighty god calls
[21:12] abomination but what man calls foolish
[21:15] god calls mighty he says so now watch
[21:17] and see it it'll be so humble that
[21:18] you'll miss it
[21:20] if you not got the token there to
[21:22] examine it
[21:23] you've got to have the token to examine
[21:25] it otherwise you'll be looking for
[21:27] something in the flesh some fantastic
[21:28] some pie in the sky something big and
[21:30] great something that sensitizes the
[21:32] flesh some denominational idea of how
[21:34] god has to fulfill his word how the
[21:36] church is going to look how it's going
[21:37] to act how it's going to operate but he
[21:39] says we have to humble ourselves and he
[21:41] says he couldn't do it enough and he
[21:44] says that the natural act of taking off
[21:45] your shoes or getting on your knees
[21:46] won't do it it's got to be your life
[21:48] that does it
[21:49] that's how you're going to reverence it
[21:51] you're going to reverence for you with
[21:52] your life he says because there's
[21:53] something great striking the earth and
[21:55] it's going to be so
[21:56] humble it's going to be foolishness to
[21:59] the world but mighty to god the world's
[22:00] going to call it an abomination the
[22:02] world will call it blasphemous but to
[22:03] the bride it's great because it's the
[22:05] humility of christ being expressed in
[22:06] simplicity
[22:08] and if you think about the first token
[22:10] and in the exodus god's going to bring
[22:12] the uh the children of israel with his
[22:14] mighty hand and what he asked him to do
[22:16] the night that the death angel passes
[22:18] through the land was not anything pretty
[22:21] and and to imagine how it was to look
[22:23] that token that was applied in that day
[22:25] which was a visible token it was hideous
[22:28] to take the lamb and to slay it and
[22:30] bleed it out and then take the hyssop
[22:32] and then put it on your doorpost and
[22:33] lentil so everybody could see
[22:37] there's blood upon the door posted and
[22:39] it was such a
[22:40] an outlandish thing to do and i'm sure
[22:43] the question was as why do you need to
[22:44] do that
[22:45] can't god just spare you can he is that
[22:48] their grace and mercy enough why would
[22:50] you need to do something like like that
[22:52] why would you need to do something
[22:53] outward why does it even matter why does
[22:55] the outward appearance even matter well
[22:56] god said to do it so we'd do it
[22:59] and it was a hideous thing and it was a
[23:01] shameful thing but it was a public sign
[23:03] that the people in that house believed
[23:04] the message
[23:07] you could tell when you walked around
[23:08] the corner and go no
[23:10] oh
[23:11] there's those believers
[23:13] [Applause]
[23:14] why because it stinks to the world it's
[23:16] hideous to the world but to the son that
[23:18] was in that house he could look at that
[23:19] say that's power over death
[23:22] that child would have been in
[23:23] desperation as he heard the cries of
[23:24] those children dying down through the
[23:26] valley he said daddy are you sure the
[23:28] tokens applied says son i'm sure i
[23:30] obeyed the prophet's message and listen
[23:33] we're living in a desperate time when
[23:34] all hell the lid has come off hell and
[23:37] the world is full of insanity you need
[23:39] the token now more than ever
[23:40] [Applause]
[23:42] and it may seem to be a hideous thing
[23:43] may seem to be a shameful thing but it's
[23:45] the protection for you and your family
[23:47] [Applause]
[23:49] it was a humbling thing to apply the
[23:50] token in that day
[23:52] it's very different the way that it was
[23:54] spelled out
[23:55] and i believe it's the same today the
[23:56] visible token is to the world
[23:58] foolishness
[24:01] he said thou must prophesy revelations
[24:03] 10 11 i must prophesy
[24:05] again before many peoples and nations
[24:07] and tongues and kings
[24:10] as we're speaking on the subject
[24:11] bittersweet
[24:13] that sounds glorious and grand doesn't
[24:14] it
[24:15] i mean i have a ministry to kings and to
[24:17] prophets and peoples and nations
[24:19] but it doesn't look like what the flesh
[24:21] thinks it'll be
[24:22] people can even describe the ministry of
[24:24] brother branham and he preached to kings
[24:26] and he did this he traveled the world
[24:28] but look at the suffering he went
[24:29] through
[24:30] look at what he had to lose what he had
[24:32] to go through to be able to have the
[24:34] kind of ministry that he had
[24:37] this this to me is i'm just reading
[24:38] these things sharing these things with
[24:39] you knowing that we're going to be
[24:40] coming to the communion table just to
[24:42] parry in our minds and our hearts
[24:44] it's a huge it's through humility
[24:47] and he says
[24:49] hollywood shines just going to read
[24:50] these statements hollywood shines with
[24:52] glitter while the gospel glows with
[24:54] humility
[24:55] it's going to be it'd be easy to produce
[24:57] glitter
[24:58] but it takes the word to produce a glow
[25:01] he said there's quite a difference
[25:02] between shining and glowing
[25:05] the gospel glows and humility and
[25:07] meekness and humbleness and power while
[25:09] hollywood shines and everybody
[25:12] hurrah and hollering and going on
[25:15] he says god is not in class and glamour
[25:18] we try to put him in and we pentecostal
[25:20] people he says god is in humility this
[25:24] is where god is he's in humility not on
[25:26] the glitter not in the glamour not in
[25:27] the hurrah in hollering but in the
[25:29] humility in the sweetness the meekness
[25:31] he says humbleness and power
[25:33] in the masterpiece he says that's not
[25:35] the way god polishes his he don't polish
[25:38] his with education he polishes in
[25:40] humility in power of his manifested word
[25:43] showing off the shape of the grain that
[25:45] it went from
[25:46] amen i love that he says he polishes
[25:49] with humility in power of his manifested
[25:51] word showing off this of the shape of
[25:54] the grain that it went from that's how
[25:56] god polishes his bride that's how the
[25:58] masterpiece is polished in humility not
[26:01] something that's going to glitter like
[26:02] the world but it's going to it's going
[26:03] to glow like the word
[26:06] he says in presence of god unrecognized
[26:08] god ain't in these great fine fancy
[26:09] places and all this stuff that we see he
[26:11] comes in humility in the form of
[26:13] meekness and gentleness and pass right
[26:15] through and he says and if you're
[26:17] acquainted with the word you'll see it
[26:20] if you're acquainted with the word
[26:21] you'll see it why so many times he's
[26:23] trying to get them to see the presence
[26:25] of god unrecognized so as we would see
[26:27] jesus
[26:28] and all these different sermons he
[26:30] preached and he's trying to get them to
[26:31] see do you recognize jesus christ in our
[26:34] myth now he says if you're acquainted
[26:35] with the word you'll see it because it
[26:37] comes in humility in the form of
[26:39] meekness and gentleness and if you don't
[26:41] if you can't catch it it just passes
[26:42] right on by you
[26:45] so it takes humility the gospel glows
[26:47] with humility god is in humility
[26:50] he polishes in humility
[26:53] and the power of his manifested word he
[26:55] comes in humility in the form of
[26:56] weakness and gentleness
[26:58] and if you're acquainted with the word
[26:59] you'll recognize it
[27:02] but the braham said the spirit of god is
[27:03] always ready for correction sweet and
[27:05] humble and willing
[27:07] see if it stands up and say i'll do it
[27:09] anyhow he says just remember arrogant
[27:11] spirits are not of god
[27:13] arrogant spirits are not of god
[27:16] but a spirit that is ready for
[27:18] correction sweet humble and willing
[27:21] that's the spirit that's pleasing to the
[27:22] lord amen and i realize this challenges
[27:25] our notion
[27:26] that um the full word has been unfolded
[27:29] to us
[27:30] and it challenges our thought process
[27:31] when we believe that there's no more
[27:33] error in the word of god there's no more
[27:35] the full word's been unveiled so there
[27:37] we don't have an excuse ignorance is no
[27:39] excuse now at the open of the word we
[27:41] believe all things the full word's been
[27:42] restored we have the mind of christ and
[27:44] we have a perfect word and it challenges
[27:46] our notion when it says the zeal of this
[27:48] age is to repent or you've got to be
[27:50] willing to take correction you got to be
[27:51] sweet and humble and willing to receive
[27:53] instruction and it challenges this idea
[27:55] we have our minds but we got the full
[27:56] word we've got all the word we've got
[27:58] all the truth and listen that may be so
[28:00] about the message
[28:02] and that may be so about the perfection
[28:03] of it it may be soul even about your
[28:05] soul if it's been sealed through the
[28:06] baptism of the holy ghost but there's a
[28:08] lot of correcting of this nature that we
[28:10] need by the word of god so that it can
[28:12] come in harmony with the word that's
[28:13] down inside of us the spirit of god is
[28:16] always ready for correction he says if
[28:18] it stands up and says i'll do it anyhow
[28:20] he's saying that's not of god
[28:22] something that's going to try to push
[28:24] past the word of god the word of god
[28:25] says don't do it and then we justify
[28:27] ourselves and say that we can do it in
[28:30] light of the clear scripture or word
[28:32] that says we shouldn't he says that's
[28:33] not of god
[28:35] well i know brother branham said but
[28:38] or i know the word says this but you got
[28:40] to be careful with that quote it doesn't
[28:42] mean what you think it means well he
[28:43] said that because he was preaching to a
[28:45] bunch of pentecostals and needed to tone
[28:46] them down he said that because he was
[28:48] afraid to defend the baptist over here
[28:50] you know what i don't know why he said
[28:52] it to them but i know why he said it to
[28:54] me and that's so that i would line up
[28:56] with the word of god because the bride's
[28:58] revival is when she lines up with the
[29:00] word the bride's revival has nothing to
[29:02] do with the song service has nothing to
[29:04] do with dancing or emotion or even the
[29:06] manifestations of the spirit the bride's
[29:08] revival is when she begins to line up
[29:10] with the word of god and that tells me
[29:13] every single one of us can have a
[29:14] revival when we humble ourselves to the
[29:17] word of god and desire to walk in it
[29:20] that's the bride's revival
[29:23] so he says this arrogant spirit that
[29:24] will say i'll do it anyhow it reminds me
[29:27] of king uzziah
[29:29] in the second chronicles chapter 26 you
[29:31] read the first 15 verses it begins to
[29:33] describe the life of uziah he was a good
[29:35] king who did that which was right in the
[29:36] lord's sight
[29:38] so he starts out good says he sought the
[29:40] lord and the god made him to prosper we
[29:42] see how god helped him in battle
[29:45] he served the people he built uh towers
[29:47] to protect the the herds out in the
[29:49] desert he dug wells he planted vineyards
[29:51] there's a lot of great things that he
[29:52] did he had a great army
[29:54] he was a brilliant leader and the bible
[29:56] says his name was known far and wide
[30:00] and then it says in verse 16 but when he
[30:02] was strong
[30:03] his heart was lifted up to his
[30:05] destruction
[30:06] you see now why god
[30:08] knowing that we're human beings knowing
[30:10] that we are born of a woman knows just
[30:12] how to temper us just how to raise us up
[30:14] just how to instruct us so that all men
[30:17] and women born of a woman could defeat
[30:18] death
[30:20] it's got to be through the channel of
[30:21] bitterness it's got to be through
[30:23] suffering it's got to be through
[30:24] humility because it says here when he
[30:25] was strong his heart was lifted up to
[30:27] his destruction so what does god do he
[30:29] always keeps us in opposition he always
[30:31] keeps things coming against us he always
[30:33] keeps us in a test or a trial why
[30:35] because our hearts cannot be get lifted
[30:37] up to our destruction because this bride
[30:39] cannot fail
[30:42] when he was strong his heart was lifted
[30:43] up to his destruction for he
[30:45] transgressed against the lord his god
[30:47] and went into the temple of the lord to
[30:49] burn incense upon the altar of incense
[30:52] he intruded upon an office that he
[30:53] wasn't called to
[30:55] and what caused him to do that he got
[30:57] lifted up and his successes where he was
[30:59] he was successful as a king and he got
[31:01] to a place where he thought god is
[31:03] blessing me so much in what i'm doing
[31:05] that i can do whatever i want and
[31:07] presumed and thought that he could go
[31:09] forward and do had so much vindication
[31:11] so much good so much power the people
[31:13] the will of the people behind him he
[31:15] entered into an office that displeased
[31:16] the lord that he had no right to enter
[31:18] into
[31:20] and as you read this scripture you find
[31:21] that he's in their burning incense and
[31:23] these valiant men these valiant priests
[31:25] rebuked him
[31:27] and the priest who he was intruding on
[31:28] their office they stood up in defense of
[31:30] the word and said god oh king you can't
[31:32] do that and the bible says he was wroth
[31:36] instead of saying oh what am i doing i'm
[31:38] so sorry i'm putting down the the
[31:40] incense or the scepter putting those
[31:41] things down the bible says he was wroth
[31:43] and he continued to burn the incense
[31:47] he had this attitude towards them who
[31:49] are you to tell me what to do i'm the
[31:51] king
[31:52] who are you to tell me what i can do
[31:54] look at the vindication look at all the
[31:56] things i've done look how many years
[31:57] i've been doing this look how much god
[31:59] has blessed me look at all these great
[32:00] things i'm doing and he was indignant
[32:02] towards them and because he continued to
[32:04] burn the incense he was struck with
[32:06] leprosy
[32:08] what he liked was the humility to
[32:10] apologize and say he was wrong
[32:12] when this valiant man said hey
[32:14] what do you think you're doing instead
[32:16] of him saying
[32:17] i don't know what got into me
[32:19] i have no idea what i was thinking
[32:22] he pushed past the rebuke he pushed past
[32:24] the correction of the word of god and
[32:26] continued to do it and he was struck
[32:27] with leprosy
[32:29] brother man said now that's exactly what
[32:30] uzziah done a good man you say well that
[32:33] person was he says i was a good person
[32:35] too fine person a god blessed man
[32:38] but no matter what it was he must always
[32:41] stay in his place
[32:42] because god give him an opportunity to
[32:44] influence others by being a righteous
[32:47] king not a priest so take that example
[32:50] go in the place that god put you is the
[32:52] place that you can rightly influence
[32:54] others when you get into another
[32:55] position that's when you're a negative
[32:57] influence on others
[32:59] it's only in the place that god put you
[33:00] can you be a good influence he says in
[33:02] the word forbid him to do that so he
[33:05] went in and was going to offer and when
[33:07] he was called down the word was given to
[33:09] him that he wasn't supposed to do that
[33:10] thing and that god had blessed him in
[33:13] his business and whatever it was but not
[33:14] to try to take the priest's place he was
[33:16] out of the word well he was going to do
[33:19] it anyhow no matter what anyone said now
[33:21] isn't that the attitude of too many
[33:23] people today they won't take correction
[33:25] of the word
[33:27] what is it we must humble ourselves to
[33:30] the word of god brother man said when
[33:32] cain wouldn't humble himself to the word
[33:33] of god that showed the serpent scene
[33:36] so the very thing that the bride
[33:38] possesses that nobody else possesses is
[33:40] the ability to completely and totally
[33:42] humble herself to the word of god some
[33:45] can do it so far but not all the way but
[33:47] the bride can become absolutely and
[33:50] completely dependent upon him from start
[33:52] to finish
[33:54] there's no point where the bride gets to
[33:56] the place where he says god i think i've
[33:57] got it from here but she feels in her
[33:59] heart lord you began this lord you need
[34:02] to finish it lord you started it lord
[34:04] you finish it i am unable lord no matter
[34:06] how much you've done for me no matter
[34:08] how much you've shown me no matter how
[34:10] much you've used me i'm nothing without
[34:12] you
[34:16] and what a great what a great uh a
[34:19] relationship then because he's saying i
[34:21] can't do this without you
[34:23] you're my body you're my voice there's a
[34:25] work that i had that i didn't finish in
[34:27] the days of my early ministry but i now
[34:29] work by and through the bride so i need
[34:31] you to finish my work and she said i
[34:32] need you to finish your work and it's a
[34:34] perfect example of how being mutually
[34:36] dependent we get the job done
[34:42] he says and uzziah ought to have taken
[34:44] that heed now remember we call him today
[34:46] a christian
[34:47] that god had blessed
[34:49] he wasn't just some ordinary man he was
[34:50] a man that was blessed by god
[34:53] but he did not want to stand correction
[34:56] no matter how much the word said it was
[34:58] so he didn't want to understand that
[35:01] because he felt secure enough that god
[35:03] would let him get by with something else
[35:06] and that's what's the matter with our
[35:08] peoples today around the world they
[35:09] think that god will let them get by with
[35:11] something contrary to this word he will
[35:13] never do it we must come back to
[35:15] correction and stand by and stand
[35:17] correction by the word
[35:19] he says and because of his arrogant way
[35:21] he acted he paid no attention to what
[35:23] this minister had to say he would do
[35:25] what he wanted to do
[35:28] my
[35:29] humbling ourselves to the word of god
[35:31] amen correcting ourselves disciplining
[35:33] ourselves that's the whole reason why
[35:34] god opens up the word to us to see him
[35:36] and his program so we can correct
[35:38] ourselves discipline ourselves and learn
[35:39] how to live and act in this evil age
[35:43] so we must correct we must be able to be
[35:45] corrected by the word of god humble
[35:47] ourselves to the word of god even when
[35:48] it hurts no matter how much we've been
[35:50] blessed no matter how successful we've
[35:51] been we must be able tender willing and
[35:54] humble as he said willing to be led by
[35:56] the spirit
[35:57] always ready for correction sweet humble
[35:59] willing
[36:00] but uzziah through his arrogance he said
[36:02] because of his arrogance he didn't pay
[36:04] attention to the word of god
[36:06] didn't pay attention to what the message
[36:08] was saying through his arrogance he
[36:09] thought he was so blessed he thought he
[36:11] could get away with everything he felt
[36:12] secure enough that god would let him get
[36:14] by with something else
[36:17] wow what a what a caution to us to not
[36:19] get be lifted up in this great ministry
[36:21] that god has given us
[36:22] the bride's ministry the ministry of the
[36:24] son of man and because we've been given
[36:27] a ministry it's appropriate to consider
[36:28] what brother branham said were the three
[36:31] dangers to a minister
[36:32] you all familiar with this
[36:34] and um i'm still pretty young in
[36:36] ministry and i had a minister's
[36:38] convention here our minister's meeting
[36:39] here recently and i was asked to speak
[36:41] at it i haven't spoken at very many
[36:42] ministers conventions or meetings uh
[36:44] maybe one or two and this one i was
[36:45] asked to speak to about 30 or so
[36:47] ministers i was probably the youngest
[36:48] one in the room and i was like i want to
[36:50] speak on the three things that a
[36:51] minister must watch many women in
[36:53] popularity they're all like
[36:55] we're supposed to debate the seventh
[36:56] seal not talk about these things
[36:59] they said there's three things that a
[37:01] minister must watch
[37:02] that hurts ministers hinders a minister
[37:05] brings the minister back to the rut
[37:07] wrecks a minister's life from the start
[37:10] those are all different ways he
[37:11] described these things he must watch
[37:12] them it hurts ministers hinders the
[37:14] minister brings the minister back to the
[37:15] right wrecks a minister's life from the
[37:17] start he said it was money women and
[37:19] popularity
[37:21] and if you pay attention to those three
[37:23] different instances money women in
[37:24] popularity it's not always the first
[37:26] thing we think of well it's going to
[37:27] hinder a minister if he's rich or it's
[37:29] going to hinder a minister if he has an
[37:30] affair with the woman it's going to
[37:32] hinder her minister if he's the most
[37:33] popular minister there's other ways that
[37:34] the money women in popularity can
[37:36] manifest itself
[37:37] a pastor cannot handle the tithes
[37:39] correctly use it to manipulate or
[37:41] control or to buy influence and that's
[37:43] the way that money becomes a problem too
[37:45] he may not be very disciplined in the
[37:47] way that he manages his money and
[37:49] therefore he constantly finds himself in
[37:50] debt and it's not because he has a lot
[37:52] of money that he hinders them it's
[37:53] because he doesn't know how to handle
[37:54] money that hinders them so there's a lot
[37:56] of different ways these things could be
[37:57] applied also with the woman it doesn't
[37:59] necessarily mean that the minister lust
[38:00] after a woman or has taken an adultery
[38:02] though that part applies but the woman
[38:04] is also a church
[38:06] and when a man lusts after a church or
[38:07] even as abusive towards a church there's
[38:09] a lot of ways where a minister's
[38:11] relationship to the woman which is the
[38:12] church is thing something that hinders
[38:14] him or brings him back to a rut erects
[38:17] his life from the start
[38:19] then the other one was popularity
[38:22] and i mentioned this because if the
[38:23] bride's going to have a ministry she's
[38:24] got to watch many women in popularity
[38:26] how do you mean how does the bride need
[38:28] to watch women she doesn't need to
[38:29] pattern herself after the other women
[38:31] should have to try to be like the other
[38:32] churches she don't have to chase after
[38:34] those other things and brother branham
[38:36] equates popularity with pride and uses
[38:38] saul as the example
[38:40] we find with money women in popularity
[38:41] they correspond with the the lust of the
[38:43] flesh the less of the eyes and the pride
[38:45] of life
[38:46] and the three temptations of eve in the
[38:48] beginning the temptations of christ in
[38:50] the wilderness and brother branham says
[38:51] that the bride will have to stand and
[38:53] face the same thing under temptation of
[38:55] the enemy so we'll be faced with the
[38:57] temptation the lust of the eyes the lust
[38:59] of the flesh and the pride of life money
[39:01] women in popularity
[39:02] those three things that are in the world
[39:05] and brother branham uses these
[39:07] statements when he begins to think he is
[39:09] something when he's talking about this
[39:10] pride of life or this popularity
[39:13] and if you think you're better than
[39:15] somebody else
[39:17] then you must work to prove it
[39:20] you thought about that
[39:22] if you think you're better than somebody
[39:23] else then you're gonna have to work to
[39:24] prove it so if you think you're a better
[39:26] cook than sister so-and-so and she bakes
[39:28] a pie at that church potluck and you
[39:30] think you're better than her then you're
[39:31] out of work to try to cook a better one
[39:33] the next time
[39:35] because you got to prove it to yourself
[39:36] you got to prove it to others so when
[39:37] you think you're better than somebody
[39:38] else you're always trying to work your
[39:40] way to be better and prove yourself to
[39:42] be better and that's not a work you need
[39:43] to undertake
[39:45] this might start to be getting a little
[39:46] prac a little practical about being
[39:47] bittersweet but i want you to ponder
[39:49] that and think about that if you think
[39:50] you're better than somebody else then
[39:52] you got to prove it to yourself and
[39:53] prove it to others
[39:54] and many times being unable to prove
[39:56] that we're better we just try to make
[39:58] the other person worse
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:03] brother braham says in the message
[40:04] second miracle he said there's three
[40:05] things that i've watched in my life in
[40:07] reading other ministers when god blesses
[40:09] the minister just a little bit on the he
[40:11] says now we're all friends aren't we he
[40:13] says
[40:14] i guess he knew he was about to step on
[40:15] some toes
[40:17] you're my friend right we're all friends
[40:18] here
[40:21] i hope you don't have to line me up over
[40:22] here to the side and make everybody make
[40:24] right with me their thoughts they had
[40:25] about my wife's preaching before they
[40:26] take communion
[40:28] i resented you brother aaron when you
[40:29] said that
[40:32] he says when he blesses him just a
[40:34] little bit above maybe someone else or
[40:36] give him an opportunity to do a little
[40:38] more work for him or something the first
[40:40] thing that satan goes to work in with
[40:42] that administers three things three
[40:44] major things the first thing is money
[40:46] women popularity he'll work on him with
[40:48] money or if he can get him like his
[40:50] first bait like that's like in the
[40:52] garden of eden he says well or if he can
[40:54] get him thinking he's something when he
[40:57] ain't nothing he's got him right then
[41:00] that's the popularity when he gets him
[41:03] thinking that he's something when he's
[41:05] ain't nothing he's got him right then
[41:07] you have to guard against and if i could
[41:09] put this maybe in terms that makes sense
[41:11] and in the bride's ministry and
[41:13] fulfilling revelations 10 11 we can't
[41:15] think ourselves to be more than what god
[41:17] has made us
[41:18] we don't want to go presuming we don't
[41:20] want to go forth in the flesh and we
[41:22] don't want to have this arrogant idea
[41:23] well i'm going to be creating squirrels
[41:25] and i can rebuke the devil no i want to
[41:27] stay right behind his word i want to
[41:29] stay humble under his protection i need
[41:31] his protection i need his grace i'm no
[41:34] only in christ am i more than a match to
[41:36] the devil only in christ can i handle
[41:38] the things that are coming my way only
[41:40] in christ can i do the things that i
[41:42] desire to do that are right and correct
[41:44] i'm never able on my
[41:46] own the mark of a mature christian is
[41:49] total dependence upon christ
[41:52] a christian is reaches a full and
[41:54] supreme maturity when he realizes that
[41:57] in nothing he can do he can't do
[41:59] anything without christ
[42:01] that he's nothing on his own it's the
[42:03] exact opposite in the world we recognize
[42:05] that a person's mature when they can
[42:07] sustain themselves on their own they can
[42:08] live on their own they could they're
[42:09] sovereign they can to pay their own
[42:11] bills they can pay their own rent they
[42:12] can live on their own we think that's a
[42:14] man who's arrived when he can live on
[42:16] his own and support his own family but
[42:17] we've arrived when we've shed all our
[42:19] ability and stand before christ and say
[42:22] lord take me and use me for your glory
[42:25] brother said we must master the thought
[42:27] of human
[42:28] ability brother man says being popular
[42:31] popularity usually leads to sin and
[42:33] disgrace
[42:36] we shouldn't try to strive to be the
[42:37] most popular church the most influential
[42:39] church the most visible church he says
[42:41] popularity usually leads to sin and
[42:43] disgrace
[42:44] and the message show us the father he
[42:46] says there are three things that i
[42:47] noticed in the bible that always it's
[42:49] either cutting the tape it says and
[42:50] maybe it says hinders or hurts a
[42:52] minister he says one of them was money
[42:54] the other one was popularity and women
[42:57] so i know that saul fell because of
[42:59] popularity
[43:01] and he brings us to the mind of of saul
[43:04] so i know these three things balaam
[43:06] because of money samson because of women
[43:08] so then i know these three things was a
[43:09] hindrance that we must always keep
[43:11] covered up
[43:12] and money of course would be the
[43:14] greatest he says or trying to think
[43:16] you're just a little better than
[43:18] somebody else
[43:21] this is a this is a it's a paradox it's
[43:23] bittersweet
[43:25] how can we be pure gold
[43:27] how can we have the very life of christ
[43:30] on the inside of us how can we be all
[43:31] these things that brother braham says
[43:33] about the church the church of christ
[43:34] the bride is like and under pure gold
[43:36] her identity is found in him what he is
[43:38] she is to reflect what he has she is to
[43:40] manifest in fact and her is summed up
[43:41] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[43:43] purpose of god but the expression is
[43:45] completely humble
[43:47] completely broken completely sweet
[43:49] so in so how it has to be dressed this
[43:52] great power this great glory this great
[43:54] deity is is once again behind badger
[43:56] skins as it were once we get behind
[43:59] something stinky and filthy something
[44:00] meek and lowly something humble
[44:04] we cannot think that we're better than
[44:06] somebody else
[44:08] and the example of saul is quite
[44:10] striking
[44:11] he was he was the people's choice to be
[44:14] king
[44:15] and they chose him because he was taller
[44:16] than everybody else he was tall he was
[44:18] handsome he's very charismatic
[44:20] and he was one that looked like a king
[44:23] and he seemed to start out right when
[44:25] they went to find him he was hiding
[44:28] he was reluctant
[44:29] but the scripture says something that
[44:31] gives you a clue that something's not
[44:32] right with saul because it says when he
[44:34] was anointed be king god gave him
[44:36] another heart
[44:37] that meant the heart he had wasn't the
[44:39] right one to rule so god had to give him
[44:41] another one but when it came to god's
[44:43] choice god didn't say he gave david
[44:45] another heart he said david already had
[44:47] a heart like his
[44:49] and so david had the kind of heart that
[44:51] god could mold that god could correct
[44:53] that god could use to fulfill his word
[44:55] but with saul he had to give him another
[44:56] heart just to be a good kind of king but
[44:58] when saul would not take correction
[45:02] that anointing left and he was given
[45:03] over to his worst behavior in his worst
[45:06] instincts and an evil spirit came upon
[45:08] him
[45:09] and you look at the mistakes of saul
[45:11] saul made a mistake by being impatient
[45:14] and he was and the
[45:16] prophet told him i'll be there in a few
[45:17] days and after these several days i'll
[45:18] be there and offer worship that time
[45:20] passed and the saul got anxious and
[45:22] wanted to offer sacrifice for his men
[45:24] before they went to battle and if you
[45:25] just described it you would think that
[45:27] saul was doing an honorable thing to
[45:29] protect his men and give glory to god i
[45:31] offered sacrifice before battle to give
[45:33] lord you the first place to offer
[45:35] protection upon my men and to glorify
[45:37] you but he intruded on an office that
[45:39] wasn't his
[45:40] and it's because he was impatient
[45:42] because he did that that little mistake
[45:44] samuel shows up and says because you've
[45:46] done this this kingdom will be taken
[45:48] away from you
[45:50] and you think my goodness oh that's all
[45:52] it took but saul would never humble
[45:54] himself
[45:56] as a matter of fact when saul once again
[45:57] was found disobeying the lord and he was
[45:59] told to destroy all the amalekites and
[46:01] he went and he he was to destroy them
[46:03] all and then samuel shows up and he says
[46:05] and saul says oh i've obeyed the lord
[46:08] samuel
[46:10] he even saved tells him presuming i've
[46:12] done exactly what you've asked sam says
[46:13] what's this bleeding of rams why do i
[46:15] hear all these things he goes oh oh
[46:17] we've saved those to offer to the lord
[46:21] and then when he gets called out he's
[46:22] all the people made me do it
[46:25] and what is he doing i may be getting my
[46:26] different instances mixed up in verse
[46:28] chapter 13 or 15 but then he grabs the
[46:30] prophet in his anger and he rents his
[46:32] clothes he says because just as you have
[46:35] rent this vesture from me so will the
[46:37] kingdom be rent from you and given to
[46:38] another that is better than you
[46:42] it's one thing for god to say it
[46:44] but you'll never find david saying it
[46:48] david never told saul he was better
[46:50] but he but the word said he was
[46:53] david never gloated over saul david
[46:55] never bullied saul david never went out
[46:57] of his way to try to provoke saul all he
[46:59] had to do was be himself and minister
[47:01] and that would be enough to provoke saul
[47:03] and listen i'm getting just venturing
[47:05] off into other territory here but i just
[47:07] believe it would be a blessing a
[47:09] necessary for one of us even if it's
[47:11] from my own reminder for myself but if
[47:13] you look at the mistakes of saul and
[47:15] compare him to the mistakes of david
[47:17] saul would still be your choice
[47:20] offered sacrifice
[47:21] for his men before battle without the
[47:23] prophet
[47:24] kept the best of the flocks and the pure
[47:27] the pure beast of the flock to offer
[47:29] sacrifice to god those were saul's
[47:31] mistakes that took the kingdom away from
[47:33] them
[47:34] but saul was an adulterer
[47:37] and then a murderer
[47:40] and yet god kept the kingdom with him
[47:44] one's an adulterer and a murderer the
[47:46] other one just worships out of season
[47:49] the other one just tries to do god's
[47:50] will but just doesn't doesn't wait
[47:52] properly and and he's trying he's doing
[47:54] his best wanting to give god first you
[47:55] first you can't take what david did and
[47:57] try to whitewash it and spin it where
[47:59] it's something righteous and something
[48:00] gloriful glorious it's something awful
[48:04] but yet david was a man after god's
[48:05] heart saul was it and you'll find the
[48:07] difference is when paul saul was rebuked
[48:09] he could never humble himself when david
[48:11] was told david you're that man he fell
[48:14] and broken man said lord i'm sorry
[48:16] please forgive me i've sinned against my
[48:18] god and he accepted the consequences for
[48:21] his action
[48:23] the difference was the ability to humble
[48:24] himself and repent and make things right
[48:26] listen we believe we are the sinless
[48:28] pure spotless virgin pride of the lord
[48:30] jesus christ but we still make mistakes
[48:33] and the difference between you and the
[48:35] rest will be you will be willing to say
[48:37] lord i'm sorry please forgive me
[48:41] lord i made a mistake and i'm sorry lord
[48:44] let that blood cover
[48:46] me not sit back and say well i did it
[48:49] because of this i did it because of that
[48:50] and blame everybody else but say lord
[48:52] let it rest upon me i'm sorry
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:57] god allowing david to do something that
[48:59] just so boggles our minds
[49:01] to think it would be a child of that
[49:03] union that would be that would be the
[49:04] one that would take the throne solomon
[49:09] but yet before solomon could take the
[49:11] throne
[49:14] david owns up to his mistakes
[49:17] and david there in his brokenness before
[49:19] god and before the prophet
[49:21] says i am that man
[49:24] and the bible tells david don't fear the
[49:26] prophet nathan said don't worry
[49:29] about you don't worry about your throne
[49:31] but the child will die
[49:35] well who died the innocent
[49:38] the one that didn't sin
[49:40] but god took the sins
[49:42] and passed them over david upon the
[49:44] innocent son of david
[49:46] portraying christ
[49:48] and because he took our sins and they
[49:51] bypassed us and they've been placed upon
[49:53] his son jesus christ we have a right to
[49:56] ascend to the throne
[50:02] the saul was made more obstinate
[50:05] the correction didn't produce humility
[50:07] with him it just encouraged his
[50:10] arrogance and so this as we're saying
[50:13] speaking on bittersweet
[50:15] i just hope it makes sense to you
[50:17] i trust that god the holy spirit's piece
[50:19] it together i
[50:21] m by nature i i i can study for years
[50:24] before i preach a sermon just trying to
[50:26] wait on the lord wait on the lord and i
[50:28] want to know just just how the message
[50:29] teaches it and these things and and i
[50:31] just this message is just burning on my
[50:33] heart and god gave me this channel to
[50:35] express it and it may seem to be
[50:36] scattered and all over the place that i
[50:39] just trust god's putting it together in
[50:40] your heart
[50:45] bitterness is a suffering
[50:49] it's to produce
[50:50] a character
[50:52] to shape our hearts to be like christ
[50:54] amen
[50:55] james 1 2 4 my brother counted all joy
[50:58] when you fall into diverse temptations
[50:59] that didn't mean doesn't mean fall into
[51:01] sin
[51:02] but when you suffer tribulation
[51:05] not for not for your own evil sake but
[51:07] for god's sake for god's will for the
[51:08] word's sake
[51:10] it says knowing that this that the trend
[51:12] of your faith worketh patience
[51:14] but let patience have her perfect work
[51:16] that you may be perfect and entire
[51:18] wanting nothing
[51:20] if you can have patience it's virtue
[51:23] he says let patience have her perfect
[51:25] work that you may be perfect and entire
[51:28] wanting nothing but what's going to
[51:29] produce uh patience the trying of your
[51:31] faith
[51:33] you have faith you have a great faith
[51:34] you have a faith of god's elect of faith
[51:36] that has been given in the end time to
[51:37] triumph over death but that faith
[51:39] faith has to be tested
[51:41] this is the bitterness we experience the
[51:43] trying of our faith falling into diverse
[51:45] temptations
[51:46] but as brother chad even pointed it out
[51:48] and this is where i was wanting to come
[51:49] to in the remainder of the time that we
[51:51] have together this afternoon is we
[51:53] cannot let the things we experience make
[51:56] us hardened or bitter
[51:58] bitterness cannot produce more
[51:59] bitterness our bitter experience our
[52:01] bitter suffering should not produce a
[52:02] bitter attitude a bitter demeanor and an
[52:05] attitude towards others and certainly
[52:06] not an attitude towards god
[52:09] [Music]
[52:10] but a softness a sweetness to us a
[52:12] humility
[52:14] now i'm just going to go further in this
[52:15] i want this to be maybe more instructive
[52:17] than something that might seem to be uh
[52:19] revelatory or exciting or even
[52:21] evangelistic but just instructive he
[52:24] says i think one of the horriblest
[52:25] things is to see a man or woman that's
[52:26] constantly complaining
[52:30] you can always complain about the bitter
[52:31] part and that wouldn't be pleasing to
[52:32] the lord i've always thought god keep me
[52:35] from it
[52:36] see that weakens faith all the time you
[52:39] know if we're to have faith to triumph
[52:41] over death if we're even wanting faith
[52:43] for our own divine healing you cannot
[52:45] achieve it by complaining
[52:47] if we're always complaining for
[52:49] expressing bitterness and not processing
[52:51] the bitterness in our bellies then it
[52:53] weakens our faith he says i know and
[52:55] this he just he enters into our
[52:57] suffering i know as they get older each
[52:59] one of us we're going to get something
[53:01] happen and something happened and i know
[53:03] these little things are going to keep
[53:04] accumulating as you get older they just
[53:06] got to
[53:08] and that's what happens to us the longer
[53:09] we serve the more things we go through
[53:11] we think oh finally we're through a
[53:12] trial what happens we're in another one
[53:14] oh finally we're going to go forward
[53:16] finally that hurts been healed finally
[53:17] i'm moving past that well there's
[53:19] another one and there's another one and
[53:21] there's another one where are we going
[53:22] to catch our breath
[53:24] you might think even as an assembly
[53:25] maybe even as a minister brother chad as
[53:27] a pastor when am i going to catch my
[53:28] breath when am i going to be able to
[53:30] rejoice in what god is doing when i
[53:31] might be able to have my hands lifted up
[53:33] with no sorrow no suffering no
[53:35] persecution it may seem like you can
[53:36] never catch your breath brother is
[53:38] identifying these things will just keep
[53:40] accumulating he said they just got to
[53:43] but i think one of the most horrible
[53:44] things is for satan to crown some
[53:45] person's life a crabbed old man or old
[53:48] woman
[53:50] wouldn't it be the worst crown for bcf
[53:52] it's just a he says a crabbed old man or
[53:56] old woman
[54:00] could you imagine if you had to change
[54:01] the sea to crabbed
[54:04] vcf
[54:07] just so hardened just so bitter bitter
[54:10] crab fellowship
[54:16] i might want to stop using those
[54:18] initials
[54:19] do you go to bcf no i go to believers
[54:21] christian fellows
[54:27] he says i hope that i don't get to that
[54:28] place
[54:29] i hope that i can bear it to my burdens
[54:32] and get to that spot where i want my
[54:34] life crowned with the glory of god
[54:36] his long-suffering gentleness peace
[54:38] meekness and filled with the holy spirit
[54:42] not exactly what he said we don't the
[54:43] only thing that would suffice in this
[54:45] hour of desperation we can't humble
[54:47] ourselves enough it wouldn't satisfy it
[54:49] would suffice but a life that brings
[54:50] forth the fruit of the spirit
[54:54] i know the devil can impersonate all
[54:55] these
[54:57] but the bride is the one that can
[54:58] perfect all these
[55:01] and you know we complain because hurt's
[55:03] been afflicted on us
[55:06] and we can begin to complain brother
[55:07] bram says oh someone is constantly
[55:08] complaining it weakens their faith we
[55:10] begin to complain because we've been
[55:12] hurt
[55:12] and then we criticize because we desire
[55:14] justice
[55:16] someone hurts us and we complain but
[55:18] then we criticize because we desire
[55:20] justice and then when we don't get it we
[55:21] get bitter
[55:25] and it's the bitterness that'll rob you
[55:26] of every single victory in your life
[55:30] he says that indifference and prejudice
[55:31] and everything exists among the people
[55:33] get that out of your soul right now the
[55:35] canker will canker you
[55:37] it rots you it rots into the life away
[55:38] it takes life out of you james says
[55:41] grudge not one against another brethren
[55:43] lest you be condemned behold the judge
[55:45] standeth at the door
[55:47] behold the judge has standeth at the
[55:49] door the the word has been opened to us
[55:51] grudge not against one another lest ye
[55:53] be be condemned
[55:55] graduate means to complain or groan and
[55:58] what does complaining lead to your
[56:00] condemnation not theirs yours
[56:08] the word messes word became flesh
[56:09] brother brown says
[56:13] he says i'm by myself but not by myself
[56:16] there's one who brought me from my
[56:17] mother who's fed me who's taken me
[56:19] through these deep trials
[56:21] his grace has brought me safe thus far
[56:24] i'm trusting that to take me on through
[56:27] that he says he's honest with himself
[56:29] and i've come to a place where i have
[56:31] says i want to ask the church one more
[56:33] thing before we get someplace study in
[56:35] the scriptures that it is that you will
[56:37] pray for me
[56:38] i've developed a critical spirit and it
[56:40] haunts me
[56:42] this is his honesty he says i i'm not by
[56:45] myself the lord's with me he's brought
[56:46] me from my mother's womb he's fed me
[56:48] he's taken me through these deep trials
[56:49] it's his grace that's brought me thus
[56:51] far i'm trusting that'll take me further
[56:53] but he acknowledges that the trials have
[56:54] created a critical spirit
[56:57] i've developed a critical spirit and it
[56:59] haunts me could we have the humility to
[57:01] at least admit to it and also that it's
[57:02] not a benefit to us
[57:04] said i told my wife yesterday the first
[57:06] time something happened now that i was
[57:07] sitting in the yard and i told her she'd
[57:09] reminded me i told her about it said
[57:11] honey i've got to a place to become
[57:13] critical of people i don't want to be
[57:15] whose job is it it's not mine and god's
[57:17] the one to criticize not me
[57:23] what we suffer what we go through should
[57:24] never create in us this attitude where
[57:27] we get offended and by those offenses we
[57:29] were hurt and so we become uh
[57:32] this affliction on us we begin to
[57:34] complain and we desire to see god's
[57:35] justice and god's wrath oh god how could
[57:37] you let that continue how could you let
[57:39] them get away with it
[57:41] and then we get bitter when we don't see
[57:42] justice
[57:44] it's a vicious cycle amen
[57:47] what we're doing what i'm wanting to
[57:48] remind you if we acknowledge the bride's
[57:50] going to suffer great offenses and great
[57:51] hurt everyone says this little
[57:52] persecuted bride she's going to have
[57:54] before that before she shows this great
[57:56] power manifestation this little hunted
[57:58] persecuted bride she's going to be
[57:59] hunted she's going to be persecuted
[58:01] then she'll display god's power and
[58:02] glory and go home to be with the lord
[58:05] what does he tell us we must do we must
[58:07] conduct ourselves with joy amidst the
[58:09] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[58:10] come to pass
[58:12] not being crabbed up as he says and the
[58:15] bride's crown is a crabby spirit he says
[58:18] no let my life be crowned with the glory
[58:20] of god
[58:21] not a critic not a complainer says i've
[58:24] developed a critical spirit
[58:26] and and i'm just saying this to be
[58:28] instructive too i'm just saying this
[58:29] from my heart and i believe it's very
[58:31] practical critic usually sees in others
[58:33] what he's unwilling to see in himself
[58:36] you've heard the phrase the pot calling
[58:38] the kettle black
[58:40] you heard that phrase before
[58:42] the pot's black the kettle is polished
[58:45] so when the pot calls the kettle black
[58:47] what does he see
[58:48] his own reflection
[58:50] that's that's what that phrase
[58:51] originally meant and the origin of it a
[58:54] pot calling the kettle black he's he's
[58:55] beholding his own blackness in the
[58:57] kettle and he's criticizing the kettle
[58:59] but what he sees is himself
[59:03] jesus says in matthew chapter 7 verses 1
[59:05] to 5 judge not that you be not judged
[59:08] for with that what judgment you judge ye
[59:09] shall be judged and with that what
[59:11] measure you meet it will be measured to
[59:13] you again
[59:14] and why behold this thou the mote that
[59:16] is in thy brother's eye the sliver
[59:18] just the little sliver you're going
[59:21] come here come here
[59:23] real close real close let me just look
[59:24] look
[59:25] yeah see it you see it yeah you've got a
[59:28] sliver in your eye
[59:29] he says
[59:31] but consider not the beam that is in
[59:33] thionai
[59:35] and he's saying whoa watch it as you get
[59:36] close there
[59:42] or how will it i'll say to that brother
[59:43] let me pull out the mote out of thine
[59:45] eye and behold a beam is in thine own
[59:47] eye
[59:49] he says thou hypocrite first cast out
[59:51] the beam out of thine own eye and then
[59:53] thou shalt see clearly to cast out this
[59:55] mote out of thy brother's eye
[59:58] let's start with us
[1:00:01] say lord start with me
[1:00:03] if i'm ever going to be an effective
[1:00:05] husband
[1:00:06] effective teacher to my children then
[1:00:08] lord teach me first lord i need to learn
[1:00:10] to follow you if my wife's going to be
[1:00:12] able to follow me lord i have to be
[1:00:14] under subjection to you first if i can
[1:00:16] ever expect my wife to be under
[1:00:18] subjection to me lord let it begin with
[1:00:21] me lord remove the being from my eye
[1:00:25] maybe i'm beholding the molt in others
[1:00:27] merely because of the beam in mine
[1:00:32] but when the beam can be moved from mine
[1:00:33] then i can see clearly to help my
[1:00:35] brother
[1:00:38] when we're just fault finders and
[1:00:40] critics and always complaining we view
[1:00:41] ourselves better than everyone else
[1:00:44] and when we do that we lose focus on the
[1:00:46] work that god's doing in our own lives
[1:00:49] to clean up our lives as brother chad
[1:00:51] said this afternoon when he closed the
[1:00:52] service too much self get self out of
[1:00:54] the way
[1:00:57] as i said before if you think you're
[1:00:59] better than somebody else then you'll
[1:01:00] try to work to prove it
[1:01:02] i'll say also if you think you're better
[1:01:03] than somebody else it's easy to
[1:01:04] criticize them
[1:01:08] and your criticism is your effort to
[1:01:10] prove it
[1:01:12] but do you realize when you criticize
[1:01:14] something you make yourself subject to
[1:01:16] the thing you criticize
[1:01:20] you've given the very thing you've
[1:01:21] criticized power over you
[1:01:23] and you come under its influence
[1:01:25] no wonder brother brown says it weakens
[1:01:27] our faith
[1:01:28] because when we complain we come under
[1:01:30] the power of it
[1:01:33] brother brahman says in the message
[1:01:34] flashing red light of the signs of his
[1:01:37] company says i'm getting old i know that
[1:01:39] each day i get a new ache and pain
[1:01:42] i accidentally covered up the clock
[1:01:43] that's why i'm not paying attention here
[1:01:45] so now i know what time it is
[1:01:48] maybe i'll just cover it back up that
[1:01:49] was feeling that was that was feeling
[1:01:51] good there not knowing what time it was
[1:01:56] i'm getting old i know that each day i
[1:01:58] get a new ache in pain every one of us
[1:01:59] do you might as well tell the truth
[1:02:02] i thought god don't let me
[1:02:04] one of the most miserable things is to
[1:02:06] see a man or a woman who's never
[1:02:08] accepted christ and just lived an old
[1:02:10] moss back church member meaner than
[1:02:12] satan himself
[1:02:13] and see him out there with a crabbed old
[1:02:15] something well i tell you
[1:02:17] he says that's the horriblest crown that
[1:02:18] satan could crown a life with a grouchy
[1:02:21] old woman about 60 or 70 years old with
[1:02:23] fat hanging down her underarms and the
[1:02:25] wrinkles all over her face and her hair
[1:02:27] bobbed up in four or five different
[1:02:28] colors and strutting herself down a
[1:02:30] little pair of shorts if that ain't the
[1:02:32] crowning of satan i've never seen him or
[1:02:34] some old crabbed man
[1:02:41] he says oh god give me grace to never
[1:02:43] complain
[1:02:45] so i'm glad he brought it down to that
[1:02:47] because i don't think we'll have if i
[1:02:48] even have hair it won't be four or five
[1:02:50] different colors
[1:02:52] he says i want my life lord
[1:02:55] i want my people's life
[1:02:57] god grant that our life could be crowned
[1:03:00] no matter if we suffer
[1:03:02] whatever takes place how many turns
[1:03:04] against me
[1:03:06] i know this one thing in my life as i
[1:03:08] get older my friends the streams behind
[1:03:09] me will soon be running out narrower and
[1:03:11] narrower as i go down the road
[1:03:14] why because notice that's exactly what
[1:03:15] happened in his ministry
[1:03:17] the more narrow it got more the more you
[1:03:18] got to that point in the climax of that
[1:03:20] capstone the fewer people could follow
[1:03:22] him in it
[1:03:23] he says i know one thing it'll come past
[1:03:25] after a while that there'll be nobody
[1:03:26] come to me and say and ask me advice
[1:03:32] the one who knows me in my younger days
[1:03:35] will be going on if i shall live
[1:03:37] my friends will get fewer and fewer as i
[1:03:39] get older now
[1:03:41] he saw he saw he could see it
[1:03:46] but yet he persevered for our sake
[1:03:49] he knew he would go into a place where
[1:03:50] he'd be used
[1:03:51] because of his gift for an offering
[1:03:54] but he did it to put a message on tape
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:09] not ashamed of this messenger
[1:04:16] he says my friends will get fewer and
[1:04:17] fewer as i get older now
[1:04:19] and i know that someday i've got to die
[1:04:22] i hope that god never let satan crown me
[1:04:24] as an old crabbed and different man
[1:04:26] in my wife an old nagging woman or your
[1:04:29] wife or you that way
[1:04:32] even if we're to walk the same road the
[1:04:34] prophet walked
[1:04:35] suffer the same rejection fewer friends
[1:04:37] narrow and narrow even if we're to go
[1:04:39] the same way christ went lord don't
[1:04:41] crown my life as an old crabbed and
[1:04:42] different man don't crown my wife as an
[1:04:45] old nagging woman or your wife for you
[1:04:46] that way i pray brother
[1:04:48] that our lives will be crowned with the
[1:04:50] fruits of the spirit love joy
[1:04:53] longsuffering gentleness peace patience
[1:04:55] truth faith in the holy spirit
[1:05:00] that's the crowning of the bride's
[1:05:02] ministry
[1:05:04] through her pain through her sorrow
[1:05:05] through her difficulty there's a crown
[1:05:07] to be won through your bitterness
[1:05:09] hebrews 12 15 looking diligently lest
[1:05:12] any man fail the grace of godless any
[1:05:14] root of bitterness springing up trouble
[1:05:15] you and thereby many be defiled
[1:05:18] we must look diligently
[1:05:20] lest we of this grace he says lest any
[1:05:22] root of goodness spring up and what
[1:05:24] happens to root of business it troubles
[1:05:25] you and defiles many
[1:05:29] it's not just a root of businesses it's
[1:05:30] not without consequence
[1:05:33] so the only thing the matter is get all
[1:05:35] these little differences away from you
[1:05:36] little isms and little funny feelings
[1:05:38] around you for the brethren things like
[1:05:39] that shake it away don't let no root or
[1:05:42] business ever get into your soul if you
[1:05:44] do it'll canker you
[1:05:46] keep love i don't care how much people
[1:05:48] hate you you love them anyhow
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:54] he says in the message why they already
[1:05:56] can prove that man that hold grudges and
[1:05:58] women who fuss and stew and fight and
[1:05:59] argue they'll die it'll cause cancer
[1:06:01] fungus and everything else said in
[1:06:03] ulcers
[1:06:05] and they have scientifically proven that
[1:06:07] harboring anger and a lack of
[1:06:08] forgiveness creates a chronic state of
[1:06:10] anxiety
[1:06:12] and the tenseness and the and the way
[1:06:14] the nerves are stretched it becomes
[1:06:15] toxic to physical health
[1:06:19] is he says they can already prove that i
[1:06:20] found a number of studies at least maybe
[1:06:22] a eight or so where studies show that
[1:06:24] people who forgive are happier and
[1:06:26] healthier than those those who hold
[1:06:27] resentments
[1:06:29] study after study from university after
[1:06:31] university after brethren said they can
[1:06:32] already prove it that holding grudges
[1:06:34] these things the lack of forgiveness
[1:06:35] will actually cause your body to weaken
[1:06:37] and die they've proven it through
[1:06:39] scientific study
[1:06:41] studies have shown that the habit of
[1:06:43] fault-finding and constant criticize
[1:06:44] criticism is a precursor to stress and
[1:06:47] that stress wreaks havoc upon the body
[1:06:50] what fault finding negativity
[1:06:53] why brother brahman said a critical
[1:06:54] spirit just weakens faith
[1:06:57] you're not only weak in faith but it
[1:06:58] harms your physical body
[1:07:00] it says a root of business will trouble
[1:07:02] you and defile many
[1:07:10] our attitude is so important
[1:07:12] he says your attitude towards christ
[1:07:14] will make a great impression on what
[1:07:15] your children will be
[1:07:17] your life that you live before your
[1:07:18] family will make an impression on what
[1:07:20] your children will be
[1:07:23] our attitude yes we have the truth
[1:07:26] yes we believe precious things that are
[1:07:27] ridiculed and mocked and sometimes even
[1:07:29] by people that are close to us
[1:07:31] but we never have the license to have
[1:07:33] the wrong attitude
[1:07:35] we never have a right to be cocky or
[1:07:37] arrogant we never have a right to be
[1:07:38] mean or harsh
[1:07:40] there's a phrase that says bride won't
[1:07:41] persecute bride brother i said bride
[1:07:43] won't persecute bride i believe that do
[1:07:45] you believe that
[1:07:46] i also believe that bride doesn't
[1:07:47] persecute anybody
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:52] so i don't i don't have a a persecuting
[1:07:54] a pitchfork in my hand i said well
[1:07:56] brother are you bride okay then i won't
[1:07:58] use it on you
[1:08:01] she doesn't have persecution in her bag
[1:08:04] she doesn't persecute anybody
[1:08:08] so you want to know bride bride's the
[1:08:09] one not persecuting
[1:08:12] because not only does bride not
[1:08:13] persecute bride bride doesn't persecute
[1:08:17] our attitude towards christ the attitude
[1:08:19] with which we carry this word i meant to
[1:08:21] bring the statement to to the pulpit i
[1:08:23] just forgot
[1:08:24] but there's a there's a statement that's
[1:08:26] been shown through a number of different
[1:08:27] studies how that children millennials
[1:08:29] and children these days and teenagers
[1:08:31] and young adults are leaving
[1:08:32] christianity because of the the way that
[1:08:34] their parents lived and expressed what
[1:08:36] they believed
[1:08:38] they're not leaving because of what they
[1:08:39] have a disagreement with christ or the
[1:08:41] bible they're leaving leaving because
[1:08:43] they have a disagreement with those
[1:08:44] people who believe the christ of the
[1:08:46] bible
[1:08:47] the life that was lived has not been the
[1:08:49] proper expression of the grace and
[1:08:50] humility of christ
[1:08:54] i just have a few more statements to
[1:08:55] read here several more statements and
[1:08:57] i'll we'll turn we'll approach the
[1:08:58] communion table but i hope that there's
[1:09:00] something building in your hearts
[1:09:02] to have a real sweet time in the
[1:09:04] presence of god when we take communion
[1:09:06] tonight
[1:09:08] the message how can i overcome he says
[1:09:10] lord jesus you see those hands
[1:09:12] as he's asked maybe for a response here
[1:09:14] at the end of this message how can i
[1:09:15] overcome how did jesus overcome by the
[1:09:18] word and humility
[1:09:21] as your servant stand between the living
[1:09:22] and the dead i condemn everything that's
[1:09:25] bothering these people and myself
[1:09:27] and i ask in the name of jesus christ we
[1:09:30] can leave it laying here on the altar of
[1:09:32] god and walk away this morning free as
[1:09:34] overcomers
[1:09:36] if our sisters haven't had the grace
[1:09:37] before may it be granted now lord if our
[1:09:40] brothers haven't had the grace may be
[1:09:42] granted now could we all just say lord
[1:09:44] for me
[1:09:45] i haven't had the grace before today
[1:09:48] lord even though i've known i've known
[1:09:49] these things these things have been
[1:09:51] preached but lord if i haven't had the
[1:09:52] grace before may i have it now
[1:09:54] he says in may in humility mother with
[1:09:57] her children instead of being arrogant
[1:10:00] she knows she's a preacher to them
[1:10:01] little children her life is an example

[1:10:11] head of the house the mother has been
[1:10:13] trying to boss him around she'll never
[1:10:14] do it no more if he's been using her for
[1:10:16] a doormat it'll never be done no more
[1:10:19] she's a helpmate he says granite lord
[1:10:22] may all these things that hinder us lord
[1:10:24] be taken away we are consecrating
[1:10:26] ourselves
[1:10:29] father for what time of life we have
[1:10:31] ahead of us knowing this that we got to
[1:10:33] come to the end of it the right and that
[1:10:35] right away so this morning we take this
[1:10:38] opportunity after this message we take
[1:10:40] the opportunity lord to come because
[1:10:42] we're bidden to come cast your cares
[1:10:44] upon him for he careth for you i know
[1:10:47] you care lord you cared enough to die
[1:10:49] for us and we surely can care enough to
[1:10:51] come and accept what you died for
[1:10:54] sanctify us lord fill us anew with the
[1:10:56] holy spirit may the holy ghost just
[1:10:59] reign in our hearts supremely that we'll
[1:11:01] walk forgetting the things that are in
[1:11:03] the past the muck and the mire that we
[1:11:04] once lived in will press towards the
[1:11:07] mark of the high calling where our light
[1:11:09] can shine in sweetness and humility till
[1:11:12] every passerby can say there's a
[1:11:14] christian that lives on that hill
[1:11:18] that person that man
[1:11:19] that woman is a real consecrated flower
[1:11:22] of god they're so sweet and kind always
[1:11:25] loving and sweet and understanding
[1:11:26] granite father let us be salty that the
[1:11:28] earth might thirst granite father and
[1:11:31] overcome the things of this world and
[1:11:33] the cares of this life
[1:11:36] you realize the precision with which he
[1:11:37] zeroes in on how can i overcome he's not
[1:11:40] merely saying i need to put away
[1:11:41] drinking and put away cigarettes and put
[1:11:43] away the television and lord help me put
[1:11:45] away the shorts and put away the pants
[1:11:47] and cut my hair as a man and not cut my
[1:11:49] hair as a woman but he says let me be a
[1:11:51] godly woman a mother to my children let
[1:11:53] me be a wife to my husband let a husband
[1:11:56] love his wife correctly let the wife
[1:11:58] respect her husband correctly oh god
[1:11:59] let's sanctify us fill us anew with the
[1:12:02] holy spirit consecrating ourselves let
[1:12:04] us shine with sweetness and humility and
[1:12:06] let us overcome the things of this world
[1:12:08] and the cares of this life
[1:12:13] this is the day of small things it could
[1:12:15] be said
[1:12:16] the bible says don't despise the day of
[1:12:18] small things
[1:12:19] the brother would come and preach to
[1:12:21] this afternoon about overcoming
[1:12:23] cigarettes there wouldn't be one of us
[1:12:24] that would need to come to the altar
[1:12:26] perhaps and preaching about overcoming
[1:12:27] certain things of the world
[1:12:29] whether it be some fashions or some
[1:12:31] perversions there might be a lot of us
[1:12:32] that feel that we're free and sanctified
[1:12:34] in those things but we can't be lifted
[1:12:36] up in that sanctification and be living
[1:12:38] free from those things but living as a
[1:12:40] brute in our homes and cheating our
[1:12:41] wives as a doormat or a woman who can
[1:12:43] claim to go to church or pair ties and
[1:12:45] understand the mysteries but yet we'll
[1:12:47] boss her husband around it's time for
[1:12:49] the full word to take effect
[1:12:54] arrogant spirits are not of god and the
[1:12:56] way he's describing is a humility within
[1:12:58] the family where the wife sees that she
[1:13:00] reverenced her husband but the husband
[1:13:02] loves his wife
[1:13:11] now i just i i want to bring it now to
[1:13:13] my my closing statement
[1:13:16] i'm done calling witnesses
[1:13:19] i'm just going to go to my closing
[1:13:20] statement
[1:13:24] brother brahm says in the message
[1:13:25] greater than solomon is here he says if
[1:13:26] you want to manifest christ jesus christ
[1:13:28] in your life he says come on
[1:13:31] if you want to manifest jesus christ in
[1:13:33] your life come on don't play church no
[1:13:35] more
[1:13:36] the hour is here we mustn't trifle with
[1:13:39] this great thing that god has given us
[1:13:42] no more play in church
[1:13:44] this isn't about perfecting church order
[1:13:46] this isn't about getting our worship
[1:13:48] services just perfect and our deacon's
[1:13:50] just perfect our trustee is just perfect
[1:13:52] and everything built just right we can
[1:13:53] have great church services if we don't
[1:13:56] leave and live the life then our church
[1:13:58] services are in vain
[1:13:59] no matter how pretty it can be in here
[1:14:01] no matter how perfect it can be in here
[1:14:02] if it's not changing the inner man
[1:14:05] and we don't come to play to church but
[1:14:08] we've got to get serious we must not
[1:14:10] trifle with this great thing god has
[1:14:12] given us
[1:14:13] we're not living to go to church we go
[1:14:15] to church to live and our church
[1:14:17] experience should be feeding our life
[1:14:19] experience
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:21] i don't want to just go to a church that
[1:14:23] entertains me on two times on sunday and
[1:14:26] once on wednesday and then i don't have
[1:14:27] any ability to learn and to achieve a a
[1:14:30] relationship with christ that allows me
[1:14:32] to live in overcoming life monday to
[1:14:33] saturday we need ministries that make
[1:14:35] the seventh seal relevant monday to
[1:14:37] saturday just not on sunday morning
[1:14:40] wow we must not trifle with this great
[1:14:42] thing god has given us
[1:14:45] let's not play church anymore the hour's
[1:14:47] here lord i consecrate myself to you
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:54] in the message paradox
[1:14:56] brother branham gives the vision of the
[1:14:57] black mamba
[1:14:59] and he says that mamba was certain death
[1:15:03] he says that everyone was scared to
[1:15:04] death
[1:15:05] and brother brother brad had a feeling
[1:15:07] for his brother he saw him like leaping
[1:15:08] away everyone was scared they're scared
[1:15:09] of death if you got bit by that
[1:15:11] it was certain death and he said we were
[1:15:13] just two-thirds
[1:15:14] of the way what was it bringing us to
[1:15:17] the third pool
[1:15:19] come in there to the jordan for this
[1:15:20] third pool
[1:15:23] and we know that
[1:15:24] in the vision
[1:15:26] that he gives
[1:15:29] the angel tells him to bind him
[1:15:31] and he binds them
[1:15:33] and and just just skipping some of the
[1:15:36] details of that he says and a voice came
[1:15:37] from above and said you've been given
[1:15:40] power to bind him the worst or any
[1:15:43] the greatest and the least
[1:15:45] you've been given power to bind him
[1:15:48] the death you've been given the power to
[1:15:50] bind death he's the greatest and since
[1:15:52] you combine him you can bind them all
[1:15:55] he says you've been given power to bind
[1:15:56] him the worst or any and i said well god
[1:15:59] what must i do
[1:16:01] now right that there immediately is
[1:16:03] instructive
[1:16:05] immediately it's corrective because if
[1:16:07] someone came and said just saith the
[1:16:09] lord you've been given power to blind
[1:16:11] the devil we would all go
[1:16:13] and run out and start binding devils
[1:16:16] where's the devil let me find him i need
[1:16:18] to bind a devil come here come here
[1:16:19] devil where are you i'm going to bind
[1:16:22] you
[1:16:22] [Applause]
[1:16:24] but brother branham knew enough
[1:16:26] to say then what must i do
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:30] what must i do this that power cannot be
[1:16:33] given unless there be some consecration
[1:16:35] lord if you've been giving me power to
[1:16:37] bind the greatest delays he recognized
[1:16:39] and inability himself he knew at that
[1:16:42] very moment i'm not to leave here
[1:16:43] arrogantly i'm not the face of black
[1:16:45] mamba arrogantly what must i do he said
[1:16:48] you must be more sincere
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:53] he said there's one thing you must do
[1:16:56] you must be more sincere you must be
[1:16:58] more sincere i said well god forgive me
[1:17:01] for my insincerity let me have sincerity
[1:17:04] [Applause]
[1:17:06] if brother branham could say that how
[1:17:08] much more ought to we when we're told
[1:17:10] these great things in the world of god
[1:17:12] what we are and the voice of god is in
[1:17:14] us we are the glory and power of christ
[1:17:16] oh god what must we do
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:20] amen we must be more sincere
[1:17:23] because it's the sincerity of our hearts
[1:17:25] that determines the extent to which the
[1:17:26] power of god can work
[1:17:28] and if we haven't seen the power of god
[1:17:30] working in our lives like we should then
[1:17:32] we need to check our sincerity
[1:17:37] as we come to the communion table he
[1:17:38] says let us keep the feast
[1:17:40] not with old leaven
[1:17:42] neither with the leaven of malice and
[1:17:43] wickedness
[1:17:44] but with the unleavened bread of
[1:17:46] sincerity
[1:17:47] and truth
[1:17:52] must be more sincere
[1:17:54] speaking about a greater consecration
[1:17:57] this is the bitterness
[1:18:00] this is what happens when you eat the
[1:18:01] word
[1:18:03] you have to become more consecrated
[1:18:06] you have to be brought low
[1:18:08] you have to suffer the loss of all
[1:18:09] things
[1:18:25] he says in the message recognizing your
[1:18:26] day i just have two statements to read
[1:18:28] to you and we'll close it
[1:18:31] he says god created me a revival
[1:18:34] let me be the revival
[1:18:37] let each one of us be the revival the
[1:18:40] revival in me
[1:18:42] make me lord to hunger
[1:18:44] make me to thirst
[1:18:46] create me lord that which is needed in
[1:18:48] me
[1:18:49] let me from this hour on
[1:18:52] be thine more consecrated servant
[1:18:56] a better servant more blessed of you
[1:18:58] more able more humble more kind more
[1:19:00] willing to work
[1:19:02] more looking to the things that are
[1:19:03] positive
[1:19:04] and forgetting the things that are in
[1:19:05] the past and the negative
[1:19:07] let me press toward the mark of the high
[1:19:09] calling of christ
[1:19:11] would that be your prayer this afternoon
[1:19:14] there's healing and communion
[1:19:17] i believe there's great power in
[1:19:18] partaking of it
[1:19:21] maybe you could join this with your
[1:19:22] prayer if it strikes in your heart but
[1:19:24] from this hour on let me be your a more
[1:19:26] consecrated servant
[1:19:28] more blessed of you more able but then
[1:19:30] he says more humble more kind more
[1:19:31] willing to work more looking to the
[1:19:33] things that are positive
[1:19:35] forgetting the things that are in the
[1:19:36] past and the negative
[1:19:37] let me press toward the mark of the high
[1:19:40] calling of christ
[1:19:42] musicians if you please come
[1:19:51] create in me
[1:19:53] a revival let me be the revival
[1:19:56] so he says let each one of us be the
[1:19:57] revival
[1:20:00] he says make me to hunger make me the
[1:20:02] thirst
[1:20:05] i just if the musicians have a song in
[1:20:07] their heart just play
[1:20:08] as you would feel led
[1:20:10] i want to read a lengthy statement to
[1:20:12] you but i just felt
[1:20:14] so impressed by the holy spirit to share
[1:20:17] this with you
[1:20:18] we've been
[1:20:19] over over an hour now
[1:20:22] and if it's been lengthy for communion
[1:20:24] service i
[1:20:25] i i just trust that god would still take
[1:20:28] these things
[1:20:29] and use them for your benefit for his
[1:20:31] glory
[1:20:33] in the message i've heard but now i see
[1:20:35] he describes an instance where a woman
[1:20:37] washes jesus feet and the way he
[1:20:38] describes it
[1:20:41] it's appears as if it would be from luke
[1:20:43] chapter seven
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:47] and he says
[1:20:48] we see a woman who believed on him
[1:20:51] she had had need
[1:20:54] and seen he had need
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:00] had need for his feet to be washed
[1:21:02] she'd only she had only to be inspired
[1:21:04] to go into action
[1:21:06] he says now before we close
[1:21:09] she only had to be inspired to go into
[1:21:11] action
[1:21:12] because she had already heard about him
[1:21:15] she heard that he forgive a woman of her
[1:21:17] sins a harlot
[1:21:18] and said which one of you is without sin
[1:21:20] cast the first stone
[1:21:22] she had heard about him but now she'd
[1:21:24] seen him
[1:21:25] she was inspired to serve him that's the
[1:21:28] only thing you have to be
[1:21:31] let the holy spirit tell you that you're
[1:21:33] a sinner
[1:21:35] let the holy spirit tell you you're
[1:21:37] wrong
[1:21:38] let the holy spirit prove you by the
[1:21:40] scriptures that you're scripturally
[1:21:41] wrong
[1:21:42] because it'll only stir through one
[1:21:44] straight channel of every scripture of
[1:21:46] god it won't bypass for nothing
[1:21:49] don't be afraid to let the word tell you
[1:21:51] you're wrong
[1:21:52] if you do
[1:21:54] he says if you don't you'll never do you
[1:21:56] any good
[1:21:57] because the holy spirit can inspire it
[1:21:59] to you but if the soul isn't right with
[1:22:01] god as we've been through this week it's
[1:22:03] no good anyhow
[1:22:04] remember false anointed ones will rise
[1:22:06] in the last days not false jesus is
[1:22:08] false christ anointed ones and will
[1:22:10] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:22:12] possible and if you go and study that
[1:22:14] message you'll find in the very
[1:22:15] beginning brother bram says what i'm
[1:22:16] preaching you to today and i'm
[1:22:17] paraphrasing it is prophecy
[1:22:20] false anointed ones wasn't so much an
[1:22:22] assessment of what was going on then but
[1:22:23] a prophecy for the bride to be able to
[1:22:25] recognize the false anointed ones now
[1:22:29] she says notice she had a service to do
[1:22:31] for him
[1:22:33] she had heard of him
[1:22:35] now she had seen him with her eyes she
[1:22:38] had a service to do
[1:22:40] she had nothing to do it with
[1:22:43] that's what we have to come to realize
[1:22:44] we've got nothing to offer him
[1:22:47] nothing that we can give
[1:22:49] she wasn't she was a harlot she wasn't
[1:22:51] rich by any means she had nothing she
[1:22:52] could give but she rushed for it anyhow
[1:22:55] to do the service
[1:22:56] god furnished the water the towels to
[1:22:59] wash his feet
[1:23:01] she had heard of a living god all of her
[1:23:03] life but now she'd seen him with her
[1:23:05] eyes all cajun members of this church
[1:23:08] tonight members of the body of christ
[1:23:10] put yourself in this story
[1:23:15] she knew it was him and inspiration
[1:23:17] struck her
[1:23:18] she said this is the messenger he needed
[1:23:21] a service she had nothing to serve him
[1:23:24] by his feet were dirty but she rushed
[1:23:26] forward anyhow to do him a service
[1:23:29] because she was inspired to do it
[1:23:32] he says oh backslidden church member
[1:23:34] denominational man or woman can't you
[1:23:37] see the need jesus has tonight
[1:23:40] if inspiration can only strike you this
[1:23:43] is the hour to do it how much more can
[1:23:45] we my inspiration say oh bride of jesus
[1:23:48] christ can't you see the need that jesus
[1:23:51] has tonight
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:54] if inspiration can only strike you this
[1:23:56] is the hour to do it
[1:23:58] but she's seen him with her eyes
[1:24:01] the others there were even mocking him
[1:24:03] they didn't believe his message
[1:24:06] frankly the host pastor pastor wholesale
[1:24:08] simon had got him down there to make fun
[1:24:10] of him
[1:24:11] they didn't believe he was a prophet
[1:24:13] so then when it seemed like the devil
[1:24:15] had worked it just in right for them to
[1:24:17] say this
[1:24:18] he said to himself if this man was a
[1:24:20] prophet
[1:24:21] he would know what kind of woman that
[1:24:23] was at his feet if he was a prophet
[1:24:26] see it wasn't even revealed to him who
[1:24:28] he was
[1:24:29] there couldn't be any inspiration strike
[1:24:31] him because there's nothing there to
[1:24:33] strike
[1:24:35] but it was struck to her
[1:24:37] why cause you've been smitten
[1:24:40] you've been struck
[1:24:42] her eyes seemed beyond his criticism
[1:24:45] she believed he was the word of the
[1:24:47] prophets she know that was all the words
[1:24:50] of the prophets was vindicated to him
[1:24:52] she had heard he was on earth but now
[1:24:54] she sees them bride of jesus christ
[1:24:56] we've heard but now we see
[1:25:02] he says what was she done
[1:25:04] she seen the word made flesh the messiah
[1:25:06] the emmanuel
[1:25:08] when she gave vent to her pulsation of
[1:25:10] faith of revelation of who she was in
[1:25:13] the time she was living
[1:25:15] oh let us give vent
[1:25:18] all to this bitterness in our belly to
[1:25:20] this great rumbling down within our
[1:25:21] souls through our pain for our
[1:25:23] difficulty through our strife and
[1:25:25] through our anguish let us give vent not
[1:25:27] a frustration but of inspiration
[1:25:30] not of pain but of love
[1:25:33] not of complaining and criticism but
[1:25:35] glory and praise and honor and adoration
[1:25:38] let your word live in me oh god
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:43] she gave venture pulsation of faith
[1:25:45] of the revelation of who he was and the
[1:25:47] time she was living
[1:25:49] that he was god's lamb for sinners as
[1:25:51] she was
[1:25:52] she went forth to serve his needs
[1:25:54] without knowing how she would do it
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:57] that's why we've got to come to a place
[1:25:59] of humility lord i bring nothing to this
[1:26:02] ministry i bring no gift no talent no
[1:26:04] ability i just bring you me
[1:26:10] she went forth to serve his needs
[1:26:12] without knowing how she would do it
[1:26:14] that's the way a genuine healing comes
[1:26:16] when it's revealed to you
[1:26:17] he was wounded for your transgressions
[1:26:19] bruised for your iniquity with the
[1:26:21] stripes you're healed when it's inspired
[1:26:23] you to see his presence here of luke 17
[1:26:26] 30 that is going to reveal himself in
[1:26:28] the last days among his people in human
[1:26:30] flesh like he did in sodom when you see
[1:26:33] that and something strikes you the

[1:30:50] take me as a lump of clay
[1:30:52] take this vessel lord and use it for
[1:30:54] your glory
[1:30:56] and say lord whatever that whatever it
[1:30:58] means
[1:30:59] i remember the night that i gave my
[1:31:01] heart to god and was filled with the
[1:31:02] holy ghost i said no matter what it
[1:31:04] takes
[1:31:06] that's just maybe my own personal
[1:31:08] anecdote and it doesn't have to mean
[1:31:10] anything to you i only share it to say
[1:31:12] that i know that when god sees somebody
[1:31:15] that means business he's more willing to
[1:31:17] give you the holy ghost than you want it
[1:31:19] he's more willing to meet you right
[1:31:20] there where you're standing tonight oh
[1:31:22] he wants to see us somebody that'll turn
[1:31:24] and face him
[1:31:26] seek you with seek him with your whole
[1:31:27] heart and you'll be found of him
[1:31:30] you say i'm done playing with church
[1:31:32] anymore yes i believe the seals are open
[1:31:34] yes i believe the bright age yes i
[1:31:36] believed all these wonderful mysteries
[1:31:38] but i realized there's not something
[1:31:40] deep down the inside that allowed me to
[1:31:42] live this word and humble myself to it
[1:31:44] and tonight with no shame i'm making
[1:31:47] myself bear lord meet me in my need
[1:31:51] and it remarkable he said let the holy
[1:31:53] spirit tell you
[1:31:55] let him tell you that you're a sinner
[1:31:57] let them tell you that you're wrong
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] are we willing to be corrected
[1:32:04] with our heads bowed
[1:32:06] if you need prayer you want to submit
[1:32:08] yourself to the lord tonight you can do
[1:32:09] it before the lord by lifting your hands
[1:32:13] however you feel that you need to meet
[1:32:14] the lord tonight

[1:32:19] our gracious heavenly father

[1:32:22] and must now yield
[1:32:26] the pulpit to you
[1:32:28] completely
[1:32:30] as we worship
[1:32:32] that you could come now behind it
[1:32:34] the word which has been preached
[1:32:38] and deal with hearts individually lord
[1:32:42] without you continue to use my voice and
[1:32:44] to use my
[1:32:46] my yielding to the gift lord now father
[1:32:48] come behind it
[1:32:50] penetrate that heart lord
[1:32:53] i believe that you could allow a
[1:32:55] minister to preach one sermon for one
[1:32:57] soul
[1:32:58] and we would rejoice in it
[1:33:00] we would greatly rejoice
[1:33:02] and father whatever the needs are that
[1:33:04] your word is meeting tonight may the
[1:33:06] individuals who have been pricked by
[1:33:08] your word the ones that are being struck
[1:33:09] and smitten tonight by your word may we
[1:33:11] yield to you now as we lift our hands in
[1:33:13] worship and praise and say god do this
[1:33:15] great work in me

[1:33:19] heart like david that can be corrected
[1:33:21] that can be molded that can be
[1:33:22] strengthened
[1:33:24] and the only thing that would make us
[1:33:25] all tonight is to refuse it

[1:33:32] name of the lord jesus christ

[1:36:42] surrendering ourselves to his word can
[1:36:43] we all come into one mind and one accord
[1:36:45] to believe that what we're about to do
[1:36:47] is pleasing to him and that by partaking
[1:36:49] of this cup which represents his blood
[1:36:51] and eating this bread which represents
[1:36:53] his body we're doing something that's a
[1:36:54] divine ordinance that's pleasing to him
[1:36:57] and there's reviving in it
[1:36:59] and of one mind and one accord we
[1:37:00] believe the holy spirit can have his way
[1:37:06] him
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:32] is
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] you've been pricked
[1:38:01] i've been pricked
[1:38:04] you know what it's going to take
[1:38:06] total surrender
[1:38:09] complete dependency
[1:38:11] no more self
[1:38:13] and then we're going to see god move
[1:38:16] like we've never seen him move before
[1:38:19] what was brother branham
[1:38:21] a surrendered vessel
[1:38:24] and he was smitten
[1:38:26] brother
[1:38:27] rejected
[1:38:29] persecuted
[1:38:31] and aren't you glad you got to watch him
[1:38:32] wrestle through it
[1:38:35] i feel sorry for him
[1:38:37] but on tape he wrestles through it and
[1:38:38] all the feelings and the criticism and
[1:38:41] wanting to pull away and leave the field
[1:38:43] and we watched him wrestle through it
[1:38:46] and he was honest about it and he
[1:38:48] wrestled through it because we're going
[1:38:50] to wrestle through it
[1:38:52] the wave chief it was a wave chief in
[1:38:54] more ways than just the dynamic of the
[1:38:57] spirit he was the wave chief and just
[1:38:58] showing what it was going to take to
[1:39:00] bring full maturity
[1:39:04] we should be encouraged
[1:39:06] and corrected
[1:39:08] and challenged
[1:39:10] amen i'm so glad that god had a wave
[1:39:12] chief
[1:39:14] we could watch
[1:39:15] what it's like to come to maturity what
[1:39:17] it's like for a fully mature son of god
[1:39:20] and what is how you face rejection how
[1:39:22] you wrestle with your own emotions and
[1:39:24] how you wrestle with your own feelings
[1:39:27] and how you subdue that and surrender
[1:39:29] and go back to service
[1:39:32] that's the way i want to live
[1:39:34] say god help us
[1:39:36] i just feel before we take communion
[1:39:38] we've this has been two heavy services
[1:39:40] and we've heard a lot instead of just
[1:39:42] moving into the ritual into the form and
[1:39:44] just going i think we need some time
[1:39:45] just to pray
[1:39:48] just some quiet time for just a few
[1:39:49] minutes just to just to reconsecrate
[1:39:52] ourselves and repent for those things
[1:39:54] that were exposed today and ask god to
[1:39:56] take out of us some things that we
[1:39:57] realized we had today
[1:39:59] and god to bring us into a greater
[1:40:01] surrender
[1:40:02] and that we can be used by him
[1:40:05] amen
[1:40:06] would you like to pray
[1:40:08] you can all be seated
[1:40:11] you just pray your seat you can turn
[1:40:13] around and kneel at your seat you can
[1:40:14] come and pray at the altar however you
[1:40:16] want to pray but we're just going to
[1:40:18] take a few minutes and pray if you could
[1:40:20] just play really softly brothers and
[1:40:22] let's just take some time and pray
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:49] god bless your friends
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:59] and as we
[1:41:01] move to communion let's not let the
[1:41:03] atmosphere change
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:08] god knew what we would need
[1:41:11] so he offered himself a sacrifice
[1:41:14] because he knew
[1:41:15] we would mess up
[1:41:18] he knew
[1:41:19] once man fell what it would take
[1:41:22] to make things right
[1:41:24] so as we partake of the communion
[1:41:28] we take of the bread the broken body of
[1:41:31] jesus christ and
[1:41:33] take of the blood and the life that was
[1:41:34] shed
[1:41:36] given for us so that his life could come
[1:41:38] back into sanctified vessels
[1:41:41] so we take that let the power of it head
[1:41:43] us with impact
[1:41:46] though we failed
[1:41:48] he didn't fail
[1:41:50] though we've made mistakes
[1:41:53] he didn't
[1:41:55] he made a way for us
[1:41:58] as we take the bread and drink the cup
[1:42:01] let the power and gravity of what's been
[1:42:03] done for us
[1:42:04] let it affect us
[1:42:07] i don't know about you but i've got a
[1:42:09] greater desire than ever in my life to
[1:42:11] give him everything
[1:42:13] to give him all
[1:42:15] and sometimes we don't even realize what
[1:42:17] all is until somebody comes and preaches
[1:42:19] a message and shows you that there's
[1:42:21] more to giving your all
[1:42:24] we thought
[1:42:25] i've said this before i thought when i
[1:42:27] come to the message and i got rid of my
[1:42:28] tv and my shorts that i gave him all
[1:42:31] and i realized that was just a starting
[1:42:34] point
[1:42:36] amen
[1:42:37] he wants all
[1:42:38] and you know what i want him to have all
[1:42:41] and you want him to have all and because
[1:42:43] we have a desire to give him on his
[1:42:45] mercy he would send a minister to show
[1:42:47] us what more all is like
[1:42:50] so that we can say god i want to give
[1:42:51] you that too
[1:42:53] my attitudes and
[1:42:54] the bitterness i've held because of
[1:42:56] hurts and
[1:42:57] the things the attitudes that i've had
[1:42:59] lord i want to give those to you too
[1:43:02] the complaining or the wrong thinking i
[1:43:04] want to give that to you too the critic
[1:43:05] criticalness i want to give that to you
[1:43:07] too lord i want to give you all and now
[1:43:10] you're showing me there's more to my all
[1:43:12] but i want to give you that too
[1:43:14] you want a greater sincerity lord i want
[1:43:17] to be more sincere
[1:43:19] help me god
[1:43:22] you will it's going to take a greater
[1:43:23] sincerity god give me a greater
[1:43:25] sincerity because i'm giving you all
[1:43:27] i've got and it's insufficient so come
[1:43:29] down yourself and bring a greater
[1:43:31] sincerity out of me
[1:43:33] a greater consecration bring it out of
[1:43:35] me lord but i'm laying myself before you
[1:43:38] and i want to give you all
[1:43:40] is that your heart's cry
[1:43:42] you want to give him all and every time
[1:43:44] you hear a sermon like this we realize
[1:43:46] there's more to the all you want to give
[1:43:48] him that too
[1:43:50] plus anything else lord just take it all
[1:43:52] i want you to have all
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:56] let's just take communion with that
[1:43:58] attitude

[1:44:04] your all to heal me you gave your all
[1:44:06] the sanctified you gave your all to me

[1:44:21] scripture
