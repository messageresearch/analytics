bethany goff with us and their four children god bless you i was looking around for him and i should have just looked for the texas flag on your face that was a tip off remember it's good to have them here i accuse them of every time they're coming back have another child i don't know that's exactly true but they are coming back with four and so praise god for that god has been good to them amen we're going to continue on from where we were last wednesday in the message i titled honoring god and uh i want to begin here first samuel this is the scripture we started with last time first samuel chapter 2 and verse 30. first samuel chapter 2 and verse 30 wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said unto thee i said and i said indeed that thy house in the house of thy father should walk before me forever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honor me will i honor and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you for this word for this opportunity to be here lord we just appreciate it so very much and god we come to this time now where we're looking to you defeat us from the manna from heaven lord while we're not looking to any human being do anything lord because the human being's incapable the lord we're looking to your provided way lord i pray that you would come down with your own hand and feed your sheep today that we might receive from you the portion that we have for this hour we might be strengthened by your word have your way have preeminence among us we pray in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated amen we started here last time and uh talked about he that honors me will i honor and he that despise me shall be lightly esteemed and so we talked about many things and i'm going to back up and kind of do just a little bit of a review lay again a little bit of a foundation and move on to the next one but i'm going to end up preaching on a subject that i don't know that i've ever preached on before i've touched on it but i wanted to preach on tithe and offering and tithe and offering is not something that's fun for a preacher to preach on especially a pastor it's an uncomfortable thing but it's still part of the gospel and it's needful and when i didn't mean to go into that i was just searching something else and god caught my attention with something and it was profound to me and i really appreciated it and once i saw that it became easy for me to preach on the subject so we're going to wind up there but i want to back up a little bit and talk about this honoring god who you who honors me i will honor and he that despise me shall be lightly esteemed let's turn while we're in sir samuel over to first samuel 24. i want to look at a couple of examples out of david's life as we lay the foundation here and move on first samuel 24 and verse 4. now in in this part of samuel david has already been anointed king he has already been with saul saul he's been one of saul's uh mighty men of valor he put him as a captain in the army and he's had a lot of victory and then all of a sudden saul's jealousy rose up and he becomes jealous of david and he starts to attack david physically and threaten david and david's on the run and and saul is chasing him from place to place well david happens to be hiding in a cave that saul comes into amen and this is where we pick up the story and saul is asleep in the cave where david and his men are and let's look at verse 4 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul's robe privily now he all his friends david's mighty men and his friends that are with him are saying this is the day this is your deliverance god said he'll deliver your enemies go get him god's brought him right into your hand and he went down there and he didn't kill saul but he just cut the the edge of his skirt uh in verse five and cut off saul's skirt in verse six and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord's anointed to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way so david told him he said don't do this far be it for me to do this to the lord's anointed and we realize that the attitude of david david would not do this because of the lord not because of saul saul was not worthy of this kind of treatment saul and his attitude saul and his uh and his and his conduct he was worthy of the repercussions of david he had done evil to david he had done wrong to david and he deserved whatever he was going to get in the way of deserving something but david it wasn't for the merit of saul that he withheld his hand it wasn't because of saul's nature or even his love for saul but it was his love for god he loved god more than he loved anything else and he honored god because god had anointed this man to be king and i will not touch whom god has anointed it was him honoring god not him honoring saul see this is why david was a man after god's own heart but now let's go to his failure here in second samuel ii samuel chapter 12. we read this scripture last time but i want to bring it to your memory again ii samuel chapter 12 and verse 9. wherefore how thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife see when we look at the story in just in a human carnal way as we look at the story we would think that david had wronged uriah that he had despised uriah but when god looks at this story and although that's still true god takes a personal offense to david's actions and says why did you despise me when you did this see to honor god amen is critical and the the despise god is to not honor his word and not obey his word and not keep his commandments is to despise god so david here was honoring god by honoring god's anointed but here he was despising god by breaking god's commandment so we find out for us to honor god as we honor god by his word amen honor god according to his word and we dishonor god we dishonor god by dishonoring his word it becomes really simple now amen and it's not it's not it's not even so much about doing right acting right speaking right it's about understanding who god is and loving god right and giving god his first place because you know in in religion we can get into religion into a religious mode where we think we can be honoring god amen by doing right speaking right acting right and living right and all these other things but we can be doing that and still not honoring god because it goes deeper everything we're understanding now and the reason i wanted to bring this last time and this time is it goes deeper than what's just on the surface what's just on the surface all the christian picks up amen but for the child of god amen all these things go deeper amen it's a love between you and god i won't honor i will not dishonor god because i love him amen not just because i fear repercussions or just because i free fear hell but it's my love for him that causes me to honor him let's go to isaiah 29. there's two scriptures i want to compare so i'm going to have you first turn to isaiah 29. isaiah 29 and verse 13. but i want you to hold your place in isaiah 29 and 13 and go ahead and turn to matthew 15 and hold your finger if you can in both of these places we'll start by reading in isaiah but then we're going to come to matthew 15 quickly so matthew chapter 15 verse 7 will be the next reading so if we found that let's go back to isaiah 29 and 13. isaiah 29 and 13 says wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me better remove their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men now he he's speaking through isaiah and he says these people they draw near me with their mouth we call it giving lip service they draw near me with their mouth and with their lips they do honor me they're saying the right thing what they're saying sounds right they're saying the right thing he said but their heart that's the problem he says their heart they have moved they have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men so their fear honor or reverence and all towards me is taught by the precept of men it's not coming from the heart it's coming from the rules let's pick this up over in in matthew 15 jesus is going to quote this same scripture in matthew 15 verse 7 he says ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men this is what jesus was dealing with they had had a religious system so long that the religious system had taught men how to honor god with their lips how to honor god and they had they had sacrifices and ceremonies and washings and and feast and they had all of that and it was given by god and then men through their own reasoning they would con they would attach extra things onto the things that god had given them and they came up with a whole order where men were now fearing the lord by precept or teaching of men and now they would keep the order they would keep the order of the church and they in the washing of hands and the washing of pots and and the serving and all the extra things that were added on by the by the by the priest over the hundreds of years that they've been adding on to this and now they have been taught they've been taught to fear the fear of the lord by the precept of man i must wash hands to be pleasing to the lord i must give this offering i must do this and i must say this and i must attend this amen and we have absolutely done the same thing in christianity but their heart wasn't in it amen and god said amen your tables have become full of vomit to me god despised even the offering they were giving because they were only doing it by commandment they were only doing it by order they were only doing it by church system but it wasn't a reverence in their heart for god there was no honor in their heart for god and god and he looked past all of that and it didn't matter uh how right the conduct and correct to the teaching and and the honor with the mouth amen god was saying your heart is far from me you're not honoring me and fearing me from the heart you're honoring and fearing me from the outward commandments rules and all of these other things but god wants a deeper honor than that he wants more than that amen brother brother brahms says in the message god's power to transform i read this before but there's a phrase i grabbed out of this and i want to refresh your memory with this also so which is all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from god divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom i don't care how much science we have and want more education it's of the devil i'll prove it to you the lord willing in a few minutes it's of the devil civilization is of the devil i just got through preaching on that all culture in the earth all powers of science and everything is of the devil it's his gospel he preached of knowledge in the garden of eden and he has took that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of god that's the phrase that i we grabbed last time and repeated over and over but i want to lock that in his perverted knowledge was contrary to the word the will and the plan of god and i think what's been given to us this day is not a new church system the message is not a new church system not a new denomination not a new set of rules or code of conduct or our mode of operation what it is it brought back the mind of god so that we would have the word with the will and the plan of god so that we would be able to take every commandment deeper amen everything we there's a greater understanding amen because god has opened himself he's it's the unveiling of god god has revealed himself he's revealed his plan the mystery of god amen has been unsealed has been revealed amen and it gives us more than a new set of doctrine or a new set of rules or a new church order but if all the message becomes is a new church order or the best church order or the correct church order we could find ourselves in the same place amen the jews found themselves when in jesus day because if it's just an exchange of a baptist order or a pentecostal order for a message order then we've done the exact same thing but god didn't want to give us a new order he wanted to reveal himself to us so that we would know him that we would know the why behind the why behind the why why because this is time for uniting amen christ is uniting with his bride he's whispering the love secrets in her ear he's telling her why he's showing her his word and his will and his plan and his plan and for her when she catches the word the will and the plan of god amen it is no struggle amen to follow the commandments of the lord the struggle goes away because now all of a sudden you understand what he's saying why he's saying it what it means amen so he he took his knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and the and will and plan of god and now he had he has had six thousand years to do just exactly what god did you notice satan is always a copycat he's not original in any way he just takes what god does he copies god only does it in a perverted fashion and now he has 6 thousand years to do just exactly what god did only in a perverted way so he's done exactly what god did god for six thousand years brought about in eden placed his man there to rule over and and the satan has done the same thing only in a perverted way and he took the same amount of time to bring his own eden and now he has gotten eden here on earth and it's filled with wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science never did god ever cater to such he says in the message the god of this evil age says civilization knowledge perverts god's word to suit their own taste that's the truth every denomination does the same thing satan then preaches his own gospel of knowledge in his church amen they pervert god's word to suit their own taste and that's why now you can get over 40 000 different flavors baskin robbins can't even come close because whatever flavor of christianity you want to suit you you can find it because you've been taught the man has been taught to the fear of god by the precept of man but their heart is far from him their heart is still in their cells i want to turn to genesis chapter 3 there was a thought that i didn't get to fully express and i'm going to back up and hit this and then move on genesis chapter 3 verse 21. we were talking about morality we talked about so many things last time morality and divorce and marriage and illicit relationships and homosexuality transgenderism abortion we talked about all kinds of things and why god hates those things and why they're wrong and we we talked about they're not just wrong because uh they're repulsive they're wrong because they don't match god's word and his will and his plan remember last time we talked about desensitization and how desensitization makes things that were one time sickening normal one time we were repulsed by certain things we saw uh tattoos and piercings and certain lifestyles that were flaunted in front of us they were sickening but but now those things have become normal by desensitization at one time everybody agreed that this was wrong just a few generations ago everybody agreed that this was wrong amen now but by desensitization by the devil creating his own eden and perverting the word of god to suit man's own taste he's now got man to where now now things that were wicked before are now good the things that were good are now evil sounds like the scripture to me and so but we found out we can't we cannot begin to describe to people or explain to people why it's wrong using reasoning statistics intellects uh history none of that matters anymore amen we've had so much evil and so much corruption in the last in my lifetime in the last 40 50 years amen that they now have data to prove that their way is better data can be manipulated right whatever you're looking for you can get it to say what you want and now they can prove alternate lifestyles i mean used to be christians would say it's not healthy amen there's more disease amen the couples don't stay together a long time hey but now they're proving all of that differently by their statistics i don't know where they come from but i don't really care i don't need statistics my point is it wasn't in the original plan of god and if it wasn't in the original plan of god it's wrong if it wasn't part of god's word his will and his plan it's wrong it's contrary to his word his will and his plan it is therefore wrong i don't need statistics i don't need reasoning i don't need proofs i don't need evidence i don't need exhibit a and exhibit b all i need to say is in god's original plan that wasn't what he intended therefore it is wrong and if we try to get sucked into debate amen on anything else than that we're going to eventually find ourselves that we lose because we're not going to be able to out debate the devil and you can't out fact the devil so you might as well just take him to something that defeats him any time under any condition in any place brother brahm told us amen the word will defeat him anywhere anytime under any condition so we just stick with the word of god has been revealed to us in the day by the opening of the seals we know why god did what he did we know what god's heart purpose was what he wanted in creation what he was after what he was expressing and that was what he wanted and that's what he still wants praise god so i want to go back here and look at genesis 3 21 after the fall of man the veil of innocence innocency has now been torn and now the the the woman and the man are under a lust veil because of that god is going to institute clothing here in genesis chapter 3 verse 21 said unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them so it's interesting that god made coats of skins and clothe them and i told you last time that this word coats in the hebrew is taken from an this is right out of the concordance strong's concordance it says uh this word that's translated codes is from an unused root root word meaning to cover so god's in god's purpose and intent with clothing who created clothing who's the first fashion designer the first one to create clothing started when god did it god did it with a purpose god did it with his will and mind with his plan in mind he did it for his children because they they had lost the veil of innocency and now they were trapped under a lust veil and god was going to now institute something that would be for their protection amen and when he did he put them under coats of skin that coach means to cover our covering and god's intention in clothing was to cover and this is the this is the thing that i wanted to get i wanted to get it to everybody because it's a tool that we can keep in our hands god intended for clothing to conceal right because once the veil of innocency had been torn and they were under a a veil of lust now under a lust veil and now god's intention was to take the body that would be tempting and he was to use clothing to conceal or to cover but remember the devil always does what god does only in a perverted way so now the devil is going to pervert the word of god which will the man a covering for his nakedness and now he's going to take the very covering that god made him and he will pervert the covering and what god intended to conceal the devil will use to reveal see how tricky he is so it's not just about the amount of skin that's covered you see what i mean it's about what was god's original purpose for clothing in him is my attire lined up with god's original purpose for clothing or has the perverted purpose begun to influence me and now i'm taking from the world amen and what god intended to conceal the devil's trapped me into revealing and so i just wanted to give that to you as a tool because i have no desire in my heart to become a fashion police and and start measuring and you know you need this and that and this much fabric and this many inches and to me i don't want to do that that's not my job i don't want to do that amen that's what started you know all these other movements that's gone into legalism amen because now you know we want to make sure we're safe we want to make sure we're all right we don't want to be deceived amen and and so we've come up with one pattern of dress and everybody in our church has to have this pattern of dress and these are the approved colors teaching teaching the fear of the lord by the precept of man that's exactly what that is teaching honor to god by the precept of man and not the original plan and purpose of god give the word amen and let the holy ghost go to work on the word amen and lead and guide you into all truth what did god want amen now that's what i want and then you don't have to explain how many inches this and how many fabric of this and tight and loose and this and that what's the point of explaining it go back to the original the original explains it and under the leadership of the holy ghost when you have the revelation of god on the word of god with his original intent you just say god lead me in your original intent lord and now you have something which to judge amen judge yourself judge your motives judge your clothing judge the influences that are around you now you can stand in front of a mirror and you can say is this god's original intent and purpose and clothing or is this something else and so please don't call me because i don't know i don't care what style before i talked about fashion you know i don't care what fashion trends go as long as it's modest and it matches god's original purpose as long as you don't get caught in the spirit of fashion because the spirit of fashion will take you the wrong way the styles change i mean look around we're not dressed the same way we were in the 70s style change i could care less if they change as long as is what i put on matches god's original intent and purpose i don't even care about the colors just let the lord lead you in his original intent and purpose so don't ask me i don't want to answer any questions i will plead the fifth and point you right back to genesis 3 21 and say what i said again that doesn't mean i won't if you really have a question i'll talk to you but don't call me every time you get dressed for church please just let god work on your heart with his original plan and purpose so i just wanted to leave that with you as a tool i want to leave it for for all the brothers and the sisters and the young ones coming up that god's original purpose for clothing was to conceal and the devil's perversion of god's provided way is to reveal praise god now i want to move on in the second seal brother brahm says now watch satan's duty is to pervert the word of god to wisdom's reasoning then he marks his subjects by rejecting the original word that's how he marks the subject by rejecting the original word what did we go back to in genesis 3 the original word and that gets rejected by wisdom's reasonings wisdom's reasoning on clothing was you know well other people are doing it and you know i've got so much surface area of my body covered that's wisdom's reasonings but it gets them to reject the original word the original word comes with the original purpose now brother bram says in enticing spirits from 1955 give me a preacher give me a christian give me a housewife that's a christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that'll put god first in everything i'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him this is what we're coming down to put god first what was the second fold purpose of his threefold plan and then the one purpose the one plan he had in the back part of his mind it was to have preeminence in a body amen and he's doing that now what's preeminence first place in everything and that's what we're desiring to give him amen but if we'll give him first place mother said if you give put god first in everything i'll show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him now let's get into the subject of tithe and offering let's go to malachi malachi chapter 3. malachi 3 many of us know this but i want to go over it together malachi chapter 3 verse 7 even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you saith the lord of hosts but you said wherein shall we return will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but you say where and have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings you're cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation and i'm going to read two more verses verse 10 bring you all the ties into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts and all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delightsome land saith the lord of hosts amen i've i've never really taken a service to preach on tithing offerings one because i really never felt the need to because i don't see it as an issue for the believers here me personally i haven't seen it as an issue and but as i was reading and studying and meditating god dropped this in my heart so i want to preach it in a way to encourage you amen because it's very exciting when we begin to look at this scripture and what god has promised us but first he says will a man rob god ye have robbed me when we talk about honoring god i can't think of any worse way amen to show dishonor than to steal from god so we're talking about honoring god amen god has says you have left me amen come back to me return to me and i'll return to you and they say where have we left you and they says shall a man rob god he goes right to this he says shall a man rob god and he says you have ye have robbed me but you say where have we robbed thee in tithes and in offerings you're cursed with the curse if you have robbed me even this whole nation so now he who honors me i will honor but if you despise me i will lightly esteem you what they were showing was they despised god because they weren't keeping his commandment and tithe and offerings and they were cursed with a curse and i began to look at this scripture and it became very fascinating to me because you cannot you cannot steal something that was yours is that true so we have to lose the concept and i know most of us have because of the your lives and i i see the way you demonstrate your faith but we've got to get away from the idea that god wants you to give 10 of your money to him because with that mentality if you keep it back you haven't robbed god because it's yours but if you've robbed god it means it never was yours it always was his because you can't rob what's yours so we can't have the mentality god is asking me to give 10 of my money to him god doesn't need your money so god is not begging for money god is not in need god is not in need of your money you're in need of a concept here the children of god are in need of a revelation and understanding god is not in need god has never had a need for money or resources if you if you if you if you doubt me just think of this god with his spoken word created everything that exists does he need your money he has never had a need he has never had a lack a for material substance amen god creates it all by his spoken word and then he created it from nothing there was nothing and he created everything that is from nothing by his power of his spoken word god does not need your money you need to understand a principle this is not for god this is for you and i friends so we've got to get away from the notion amen that god is asking me to give 10 of my money to him because to start the premise is wrong to begin with because you can't rob what's yours it's not yours praise god and he didn't ask for 10 he asked for 10 plus offering 10 still isn't enough because you've robbed me and tithe and offering praise be to god why you just said why does god lay down these principles if he doesn't need my money he doesn't need my resources because we need to understand who's the creator of the world and who gave us everything god when when when when he was bringing the people uh the nation of israel into the land you realize that even to this day that land is not palestinian land that land is not canaanite land that land is not jewish land god calls that his land i don't care what the deed says on your property you didn't create it how can you own what you didn't create only by privilege of the creator the whole world thinks they own god's creation they own poor portions of it i have this field i have this i dug out of the earth and i got the minerals and i i built blocks and i built this tower and i have this factory this is my house and my factory and my this and you don't realize none of it is yours because you didn't create it you're only allowed to possess it by permission of the creator this is the principle that's got to be drove down into us because any time we move off of this principle we are not honoring god and we're not recognizing where the source of everything comes from so when god moved them into the land god moved them into his land amen not their land his land that he gave to abraham and to abraham's descendants but it was god's land to give he didn't give them the canaanite land he gave them his land and when he gave him his land and he moved them into the land he started to give them principles by which they should live and and part of those principles was to take the increase of their flocks and take the increase of their fields and they would give him a tithe of the increase and they would bring it to the storehouse and they would give a tithe to the levites and give an offering into the storehouse now realize god didn't need the grain god didn't need the sheep god needed their understanding he needed their honor he needed their reverence he needed them not just for him for them they needed to understand who he was and that maintains the right relationship you know even the israelite who would move into the land he would begin to sow seed and there was a principle a law of reproduction that was working and the law of reproduction he would take the seed that was germanized by the law of reproduction he would put it in the ground and then the laws that were in nature and then we'd begin to work and and the cycle of the cycle of weather would begin to change and the sun would come and the rain would come and then the mid the the the dermatized seed would begin to sprout forth and then we begin to suck minerals out of the ground and it would begin to grow amen and it was god who created the minerals and god who created the soil god who created the sea god who created the cycle god who put the laws that hold the whole earth together god who created the law of reproduction and the law of increase so the man who would go and work in the field and and he would labor and he would sow the seed and he would keep the weeds out and keep the animals out build a stone fence and do all the labor that he did and he would make this increase in his crop and he would bring it back to god and said god i'm giving you my seed ha you're giving god what i'm giving you a tenth of my seed no you're not that's the principle here you're not giving god anything you're giving back to him honor and reverence and respect you're not giving him material goods amen you're not giving him something you're not giving him anything other than honor reverence and respect i hope that makes sense this is what was becoming alive to me well i worked who gave you life i labored who gave you health who gave you strength in him we move and breathe and have our being amen i did this by my intelligence who gave you intelligence amen who gave you a mind who allowed your mind to work right amen who gave you eyesight amen who gave you breath in your lungs who gave oxygen for you to breathe who created everything and every principle by everything that works by nature works amen it all works by the law and the word of god it was all given by god you have done nothing when it comes down to it you've done nothing on your own he's given you life he's given you strength he's given you a mind he's given you eyes he's giving you hands he's given you feet he's given you material to work with he's given laws by which you can operate under his laws and his laws are so consistent amen because it's his word that it brings forth every time amen and we begin to work in his law by his life by his breath by his strength by his eyesight and we think we're going to give him something we're giving him nothing he's giving us everything and so you see why it is so wicked to withhold the tithe it is so evil i don't say that because i want you to pay more tithes it'll affect me not one drop whether one or two or 10 or 20 of you quit paying ties or don't what it is is it shows a disrespect and dishonor for god that's why it's wicked and that's why it's evil to withhold the tithe and the offering what it does is you begin to take the place of god i worked i earn my money i have sounds like lucifer i will i will i will see when we come to the principles we get down to the core of things we begin to realize every time i open my eyes i can see it's god's grace every time my lungs expand and take in a little bit of air it's by god's grace it's by his laws and by his word and by his will i have nothing i created nothing i've done nothing all i've done is yield surrender take what he's given use it according to his purpose and his plan and when i bring my tithe and offering back to him all i'm doing is acknowledging who has everything and who has given everything praise god i just want to hit so many things in this principle it's so much more than 10 of my income it's not even your income it's just what god's given you and you know it's it's like it's 10 percent and no more 27 32 and a half cents wrong approach because what we're doing when we when we do that with tithe and offering what we're acknowledging is that i have the fear of god by the precept of man i've been taught to give a tithe and so i'm just going to give exactly a tithe and put it in and i'm not even going to be super thrilled about it and it's going to be painful every time i do it do we see the principle do we see how easy it is with denominational and human understanding to miss the principle we do the quick calculation to the penny now some people just like things to the penny and and that doesn't matter because they give an abundance of offering that's not what i'm talking about but i'm talking about when we just barely do what the precept of man has taught us to do just so i'm okay with god that's not honor that's not respect that's not evident reverence so we need to get to the place where we understand where everything comes from and get really happy with joy in our hearts that we get the privilege of recognizing where everything comes from the privilege of i have a privilege of giving baptize and offering according to the will and commandment of god i have some way to express my honor and reverence for god who created all things and sustains all things and sustains my very life and now it becomes now it's not a treasury not a chore not a precept of man that we must keep in order to please god now it becomes something we do with joy amen with expectation because this is how i show god that i know who he is and i know what he's given me and i know how much i love him it becomes a form of worship it becomes a form of adoration amen i really want to labor on the principles i'm going to get into some details that brother branham gives us so that we just understand how things are to work but really the principle is what matters most to me amen i'm going to read a couple quotes here out of god being misunderstood from 1961. he says but now this is a question he's getting does a christian not get to heaven because they do not pay tithe good question he said i could not say yes or no to that but i do believe that every christian is obligated to pay tithes because it's a commandment of the lord and blessed are they that do all his commandments that they might have a right to enter into life the tree of life now i do believe that tithe paying is essential to a christian experience why is it essential to a christian experience because without it you don't understand who god is and what god has done for you then he goes down a little bit further in the same message he gets another question he's doing our questions and answers here and he says brother branham don't you feel that everyone who claims to be a christian should pay tithes pay their tithe into the storehouse of the lord please give scripture to to this question is that all right that's right that's that the bible said in malachi the fourth chapter will a man rob god and you say where have we robbed thee in tithe and offerings bring all your tithe and offering into my storehouse and prove me saith the lord if i will not open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive that's a challenge to to any individual and if only i had time we would not get to this little scripture that i wish to get to in about the next 10 minutes i would like to give you a personal testimony of how that i was even hungry my mother and them hungry and my daddy's sick but i took my tithes on ties out first and give it to god and you ought to see what happened i have never seen in my life that any man or a woman that if they only make one dollar a week will bring that 10 cents of that money and put it into your storehouse your church where you come if god don't bless that call me a hypocrite yes sir that's a challenge to anybody and every christian that goes into the that goes to this other question every christian should pay tithes that's right it should be done now brother branham is talking about the promise that comes with it so i want to come back to malachi 4 and look at this again and i want to look at verse 10. he had just finished saying you've been withholding the tithes you've robbed me and you're cursed with the curse this whole nation but he comes to verse 10 and he says bring you all the tithes unto the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine castor fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts and all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delight in some land saith the lord of hosts god is now listen this is amazing god says you're robbing me of tithe and offering so if you're robbing god you've stolen what's his he's not asking you to give him anything he's asking you to give back what's already his and he's promised to bless you you know if i gave you 10 bucks i said here hold this for me i don't have any pockets here's 10 bucks and i come to you later and i say can i have my 10 bucks back and you give me 10 i'm not going to say i thank you here's a 5. you get the point but god so loves the reverence the respect the understanding he said if you get this part right if you understand i will bless you amen your vine will not cast forth early amen i will not let the devourer destroy amen i will bless you if you just honor reverence and respect me and understand where everything comes from now when i look at malachi chapter 3 there's of course there's a rebuke there of course there's a curse there but that's not the part that gets me excited what gets me excited is when he begins in verse 10. god himself what he does is he fills out a contract he takes a contract a binding contract and he lays it right in front of you and he's saying do you want to sign it is that what he's done in malachi he's made himself a binding contract he said prove me see if i won't pour out a blessing that you cannot contain this is a contract friends and this contract in order to seal the contract all you have to do is give the tithe an offering that's your signature on the contract and if you sign this contract god himself has obligated himself to this contract and all you had to do amen in order to initiate the contract and the action was to give the tithe and the offering and when you give the tithing offering you put god into action because his word won't fail his promises won't fail amen he will never fail to keep his into the bargain amen and when you give your 10 percent and an offering what you have done you know none of this money is ours we've established that we all understand that we're all in agreement it's not our that god has allowed us energy strength jobs all of these resources so that we can have some goods and then it all comes from god amen it's not ours but god is going to ask us to return unto him a portion to signify that we know where this come from and who he is and that we give honor and respect unto him and in return he says i will let you keep 80 to 90 percent depending on how much your offering is i will let you keep the rest but the 10 in the offering you give to me is security against the rest that you won't lose the rest i'll prosper the rest i'll bless the rest i'll grow the rest of it and it's not yours anyways this is the best deal going if you could find a business model like this you would sign people up in droves it can't fail it won't fail it's a promise of god in the word of god and all he's asking for you to do is catch a revelation of who he is and where everything comes from who the creator is and who god is and to acknowledge it amen by signing the contract by getting yourself in contract with god by paying the tithe and the offering and whatever he's allowed you to remain he says now i'll bless it i'll prosper it i'll stop the devourer from taking from it i'll plug your bag with holes in it now see when we take the mentality it's mine and god's asking for 10 or more of mine then we now enter into contract with god we have no protection i'm going to ask you what you'd rather have would you rather have 85 of your earnings under the protection and prosper prosperity of god's promise or a hundred percent under your own protection which would you rather have now listen you don't have to have you don't have to have a master's degree in finance to understand through this question you have one that has a guarantee by god almighty opponent and you have another one that has no guarantee it's based on your strength your intelligence amen i would say luck but we don't believe in luck but anyways you see what i'm saying circumstances you're taking i'm going to hold 100 by having the concept that it's mine or being stingy with god and just barely letting out just enough to keep the precept of man you're not even acknowledging who god is but god said if you'll just acknowledge me i will secure whatever remains it won't get lost it won't be devoured your vine won't cast forth everything that you have will grow i i'm not a business major but i would sign that contract giving up you see realize we come back to human understanding you're giving up nothing to gain everything well no i'm giving up 10 15 to 20 you're giving up nothing it's not yours you're giving up nothing to gain everything to gain god's promise and security over the portion that remains in your hand is now absolutely protected by a promise of god i said god i'm going to sign the contract i'm going to sign the contract and god's not looking for lip service he's not looking for somebody who honors me with their mouth he's looking for somebody who understands who he is and demonstrates it by their obedience to his word and says i am so excited i hope what happens amen next week or next two weeks or next month whenever you get paid and you go to give the first portion of that to god i hope now you fill out that check and you're whistling and your foot's patting on the ground and you're thinking i'm going to secure everything that's left over in my account amen this is the best investment i've ever made in my life amen all i have to do is give god back what's already his and the portion of his that he lets me keep he's promised to prosper protect it shield it from danger protect it from loss you know when you start with the premise god wants me to give him 10 of my money you miss the whole point of how loving how wonderful god is how magnificent and how much he loves us and how much he cares for us amen we miss the whole picture of who god really is and how much god loves us when we start with the idea that god wants me to give him 10 of my money amen you already have a wrong understanding of who god is but when you say god is giving me the opportunity to express my faith in him my love for him my appreciation for him and god has given me a physical way to do this i can't wait to show him i do love him i do believe him i do know who he is and i know where all blessings come from and in doing in just in obedience he is so good and so wonderful that he's promised to take care of the rest amen you don't need a federally insured savings account you have a heavenly insured savings account you don't need the government to protect your assets you got god who will protect your assets praise be to god god's just looking for somebody with faith enough to take him up on the contract not by the precept of man botanize the words of their mouth but by the expression of faith in their heart that they can take god at his word man i'm going to read a couple more quotes and then i want to get in a few more scriptures he said message 1959 let us see god but you know i feel like this that a member of a church their first obligation is with their tithe and offerings is to support their church if you're members of these fine churches that's represented here you support your church that's your first duty to god bring your tithe and offerings into the storehouse and the storehouse you surely know what that is that's where you get your food so there's where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to your church and not to an evangelist like me it's taken up somewhere along in the meetings when we have campaigns like this where you have a little laying aside to help support it that takes care of me so brother branham is there at a campaign meeting that's a gathering of many churches that come together to support him and he's telling the people don't give your tithe an offering to me amen you give it to your local church the storehouse where you get your food see these are still the principles of god joseph would tithe an offering he says now there's a little bit on the side that you've got a little extra you give to the campaign that's what helps me but his brother branham is making the first priority of the local church that's the story but the man tells us in many places that that's the storehouse now let's go to genesis genesis chapter 14. genesis 14 and 18. and melchizedek king of solomon saw salem sorry brought forth bread and wine and he was priests of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him a tithe of all so this is the first time that we see in the scriptures that there's a pang of tithe and it's abram and abraham gives ties to melchizedek when he meets melchizedek who's priest of the most high he gives him he gives him tithe of all and he's blessed by melchizedek and we're going to get into this a little bit more but i pointed this out to show why brother branham is so adamant on paying tithes because there's such a discussion in christian churches that tithe paying was part of the law entire thing was old testament not new testament but abram precedes the law so this is before the law and then we are all children of abraham by faith amen so abraham is absolutely displaying the faith seed amen how the faith seed operates and before there was a law abraham paid tithe to melchizedek so tithe precedes the law so it's not just the law this was before the law amen so it's after the law and brother ben's clear on that it's old and new testament it's it's a it's part of the christian experience let's go over to hebrews chapter 7. we'll read about this in hebrews chapter 7 where paul writes about it hebrews chapter 7 and verse 1. hebrews 7 and 1 for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them receiveth tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better now brother branham is going to talk about this in the message hebrews chapter 7 part 1 from 1957 he says now watch this if you want to see something but he whose do sin is not counted from them receiveth tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promise and brother bram says abraham had the promise and this man blessed abraham who had the promise who was this the sons of levi paid tithes or their brethren paid tithes to them they had a commandment of the lord to take a tenth of what their brothers made for their living because they were the priesthood now that lets out the melchizedek priesthood as you talk about right there that's right but even the one who had the promise the greatest man on earth abraham met this man and paid ties to him he had to be greater listen and without any contradiction the less is blessed of the better certainly watch who he is and here men that die receive tithes that's the priesthood of the order of the priests and preachers so forth men that receive tithe die see but here he receiveth them of whom and his witness that he liveth what would a man take tithings for if he never was born and never will die and was from beginning to end and never had no father or mother or descent or own the whole heavens and earth and all why would he take tithe why would he ask abraham to pay tithes see i love this principle brother branham's driving down he said why did melchizedek take ties melchizedek didn't need tithes he had no beginning of days he had no ending of life he had no father no mother brother bram said whoever he was he's still alive today and the brother of mum says it this way he says no father or mother or descent and owned the whole heavens and earth and all in it why would he take ties why would he ask abraham to pay tithes you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes tithing is right every christian is duty bound to pay tithe that's right never has been changed brother venom is taking us back a little bit deeper and he's going back before the law he's going back to melchizedek who is the priest of the most high god and we know that that it was a it was a pre-figure of jesus christ god come down in the flesh as the priest of heaven he had no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of life brother ben said he owned all of heaven and earth he didn't need abraham's tithe it wasn't about melchizedek's need it was about abraham's need paying tithe is not about god's need it's about your need my need amen to recognize who we stand before and who's in control of everything so why would he ask abraham to pay tithes he really said you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes brother is bringing us back to the principles that when he come in contact with god and he began to commune and take communion he paid tithes and when we begin to commune with god a sure sign that you've met melchizedek that can commune with him as you pay tithes amen now i'm going to go through some more principles that brother benham lays out he says would it be wrong to use ties on church building funds he said now here's a touchy little thing for the church now no correctly tithes go to the minister that's right in the bible they had a box they set up at the door of the old testament in the building this box was a fund where the people put in there for the repairing you've read it many times in the old testament they kept up the building and things like that all the repairs on the building was taken care of out of the fun but a tenth of that tenth of the tithings all the tithings went to their priest their pastors yes tithings are to go for nothing else i know people take their ties and give them to a widow woman that's wrong if you got anything to give to the widow woman give her but don't give her god's money that's not yours in the first place that's god's if you sent me down down to get a loaf of bread and you give me 25 cents to get that loaf of bread and i met somebody on the street wanted something else and i give him the 25 cents i give them your money if they ask me for something let them get it over here in this pocket and give them my money but this is your money and a tenth of it is the lord's and levi the priest could live by the tenth the tenth is to be a tithing that's to be brought into the storehouse with a promise of god to bless it and a proof he said if you don't believe it come and prove me and see if i won't do it see that's right the tithing goes into the church for the pastor and so forth like that to live on and the building funds and things like that is a separate fund all together now that is scriptural i say that because it's a question that comes up many times amen you cannot take your tithe and send your tithe anywhere else amen the tithe has to come to the storehouse amen your local church where it's fed amen and that tide has to go to the levites that's that's the way it's set up that's the way brother branham explains it to us so you can't determine where your tithe goes but you can determine where your offering goes you can bring it into the storehouse and you can say i want to give the missions i want to give to the general fund i want to give to this but tithing is tithing it comes to the storehouse and it goes for the levites and there's a really good reason for that i'm going to read this this other quote here and then get into this 1961 the church choosing law for grace god will provide the works if you if you'll just walk in grace you'll be more at work than you are right now with the ladies aid society and all this other nonsense that's been added to the church soup suppers to pay the preacher where you'd ever get such a thing as that in scripture tithes pay the preacher he's delivered by the tithes of the people i want to pick this up in scripture go to first corinthians chapter nine we'll see what paul says here in first corinthians chapter nine and then i want to get to the principle so i always like to go deeper than the surface and go down to the underlying principle first corinthians chapter 9. verse 9 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn does god take care for an auction or say it all together for our sakes for our sakes no doubt that is written that he that plows should plow in hope he that thresheth and hope should he be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ do you not know that they which minister about the holy things live of the holy things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live with the gospel what paul just did right there is he took a principle that was laying in the old testament and he brought it right into the new testament because he said verse 13 do you not know the day which minister about the holy things he's talking about the levitical priesthood and the levites do you not know that they that which minister about the holy things live of the holy things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar and then he goes on to say even so that even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live with the gospel this is a super important principle amen because the principle is god after after the the pattern is laid down with abraham and melchizedek melchizedek being priests of the most high god then god is going to come along later and establish an earthly priesthood with men and that priesthood is going to be able to receive tithes and only excuse me only that levitical priesthood is going to be able to receive tithes now you think how important this is if there's a commandment to pay ties there has to be a way to pay tithes you have to be able to get tithes to god but how are you going to get your physical coins and paper to god understand when abraham come in contact with god in the form of a priest a man and a priesthood abraham gave the tenth of all to him because now he can give to god through this priest in flesh and it was accepted by who it was accepted by god that's why brother bannon says your tithe can't go to the widow it can't go to this it's got to go to the storehouse and go for the pastor for the preachers for the levites because he's picking up paul's principle where paul brought it over they that preached the gospel must live of the gospel those that attend to the altar eat of the altar amen he's bringing it in because if you're going to give god tithes amen there's a contract laying there that if i give tithes and offerings to god if i give god tithes god has secured the rest of it so how do i get ties to god i've got physical money i live in a physical body how do i get ties to god the only way to get ties to god is find a place where god has ordained somebody to receive those tithes and when god has ordained somebody to receive those tithes it has closed the loop of blessing for you that's the scriptures so brother them says that's why you can't pay tithes to an institution or to an organization even if there's not a levite there to receive the tithes does that make sense this is the word that's why we don't just pay tithes into an organization and we don't just pay tithing to a program that's not god's way amen the tithes are to go to the levites amen to the preachers those that preach the gospel live of the gospel there has to be somebody that can receive tithes on behalf of god and tell me who can do that today we live in a day who can do that only god's ordained ministry can do that they're the only ones that can do that you know i say this but for me this is a very uncomfortable thing to say you know i mean i remember when i first became pastor amen you have no idea how hard it was for me to take tithe i would rather work but that was back when i had a wrong concept of things i would rather labor because i felt like that was my money and i could take my money and do what i wanted with it and when i when i thought of other people laboring other men laboring taking what they labored with and what they gave to god and now i take that and i use it you know for food and i use it for housing and and and you know what was really hard for me is to take a vacation with my children with tithe money that may sound funny but put yourself in that place all the men around you are working hard and working hard jobs and working overtime and they're they're struggling and they're making it and god's blessing them but they're taking what what they earn by the sweat of their brow they're giving it to god you're taking it and you're going to go play with your children for a vacation that is so hard harder than you could ever imagine but if there's not somebody in flesh that's been ordained of god to receive tithes then the contract is not fulfilled there has to be there has to be an ordained way for god to keep the cycle there has to be a plan of god for your blessings and part of that plan is there's got to be a storehouse for you to bring your tithe and offering to and in that storehouse there has to be a priesthood there that can receive tithe and offering and when i began to understand that then i began to understand god's principles it's deeper it's more than just i wish i wish i could work and earn my own money that wasn't my own money anyways it was all a concept in my mind given to me by the world but those who preach the gospel must live off the gospel and why amen why is it so important there's levites on earth to receive tithe amen so that the circle of blessing can continue so that the contract can be fulfilled when abraham gave tithe he was blessed because there was somebody physically there to receive them there's a there's a symbiotic relationship that god wants and then god wanted the levites to be selected and separated unto him for his service and in doing that they were serving on behalf of the whole nation but the rest of the nation would support the levites so the levites could be separated out amen to do what god had called them to do amen and they were doing it on behalf of the whole nation right and they were the only ones authorized to receive tithe nobody else that's why i stress it's so important that tithe does not go to organizations institutions programs they've got to go to the local storehouse where there's a pastor ministry there that can receive tithes because that's god's plan too many times we get the wisdom of man injected and we mess everything up amen but that's god's plan and it closes the loop and it keeps the blessings of god flowing levi depended on his brethren for his support and his brethren depended on levi to serve in the temple it's a symbiotic relationship shepherd god has set this up where the shepherd is not independent of a sheep and the sheep are not independent of the shepherd where does the shepherd get his clothing from the sheep where does the shepherd get his milk from the sheep where does the shepherd get his meat from the sheep what does the shepherd get is where does the shepherd get his income from the sheep where does the sheep get their leadership from the shepherd where do they get their security from the shepherd you see what i mean there's a symbiotic relationship and god will not allow either one to operate independent of the other that is god's plan whether there they're mute there's a mutual dependency and god wants it that way so that the shepherd can't run off and leave the sheep and the sheep can't go without the shepherd but god put the two together and when the two come together and work right god blesses it on both sides that's why this principle is so much deeper than just the surface you better pay your tithe it's a it's a program of god it's a plan of god it's recognizing god's plan and recognizing god's program and being thankful for it i want to go back to genesis 14 and i want to show you something that really blessed me in genesis 14. this has become my desire here i'm going to go right back to verse 18 what we just read before and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was a priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithe of all now melchizedek said blessed be the most high god which would deliver thine enemies into thy hand so was it abraham's victory or was it god's was it abraham's effort or was it god's victory or was it god's deliverance where did all this spoil come from anyways from abraham or from god i say according to scripture it all came from god which had delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all and the king of sodom and said king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up my hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take from a thread even to a shulachim and that i will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say i have made abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me anor eshko and mamrie let them take their portion so abram he gets the spoil and he recognizes that this all comes from god it's not his anyways it's come from god amen he pays a tithe of it all amen and he takes what's left and he gives it back to the kings of sodom and they want to get they want to take the people and give him the goods and he says i've lifted my hand to god i will not take anything lest it's be said that you made me rich and i want all my blessings to come from god this is basically what he's saying and god honored this he had paid the tithe he had recognized who gave him the deliverance he had recognized who was standing for him in the before him in the melchizedek priesthood and when he saw god in flesh he gave him tithes of all and then he refused to be enriched by man because he wanted to be blessed by god and look at what happens in the next verse 15 verse 1 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward oh this is my prayer he says i'll open up the heavens and give you a blessing that you cannot receive it i said god don't just give it in material things amen don't just give it in good things but let my portion be you amen if i can have the faith of abram amen of abraham if i can recognize you and i can recognize your way and i can recognize who's delivered me and where all these goods come from and i can recognize your plan on how i can actually give you tithe and who is able to receive it and i operate in that faith oh god would you open the windows of heaven and give me what you gave abraham i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward what do you want your reward to be for recognizing god and obeying tithe and offering do you want me more money is that all you want or do you want it to be him i want my reward to be him god almighty amen and this is the chapter where he promises him the son amen i want him to be my portion and i want to give him them to give me the promised son amen it's a it's a bigger picture than 10 of a paycheck it's a bigger picture than giving money into a church or supporting a worker doing it it's so much more than that it is recognizing who god is and who we are and how it all fits together amen and where god's working and where god's speaking through it who's able to receive dies on behalf of god how can i come and contract with god how can i fulfill this contract with god to receive his blessings and the blessings i want are the blessings that abraham got i want him to be my shield and my great reward exceeding great reward so much more than a pool for money or somebody who needs your money and brother bam said i don't need your money i can work yet for that it's not about enriching it's not about a church it's not about a program it's about you recognizing god and you fulfilling amen the desire of your heart to honor and respect and reverence god and who honors god god will honor and who despises god he'll lightly esteem we can thank god we can thank god that he has made a way for us to enter into this contract and that way is still open and that he's promised us he'll open the windows of heaven listen friends when he opens the windows of heaven amen that's not just material goods but heaven is consistent of the word and i want to do i want to recognize god in all things i want to give him the do and the honor and the respect and i want to do it his way according to his plan through the priesthood he's put on earth and i want him to open the windows of heaven like he promised and pour out on me a blessing that i'm not even able to receive it to your heart and soul is so bursting forth your flesh cannot even contain the revelation because he's poured open the windows of heaven and he says i am your shield and i am your exceeding great reward you weren't looking for riches abraham wasn't looking for riches he didn't give ties to get rich he had his opportunity he turned it down all he wanted was god amen he didn't want more money and more goods and more this but because all he wanted was god god gave him more goods and more money and more servants because he got the first things first and honored god and god honored him we don't enter into this contract with god so that i can get more money and more goods and more of this i entered this contract with god because god has promised me he'd open the windows of heaven he would protect my livelihood he's given me he would protect the gifts that he's given to me but he would open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing and i could receive the promise of abraham because i'm seed of abraham say god you are my shield and my exceeding great reward and above everything else of course i don't want the devourer to devour the things you've given me of course i don't want my vine to cast forth it's fruit of course but the thing i want more than anything is for you to be my shield and my exceeding great reward what you gave abraham is what i want if i can have the faith of abraham and do as abraham i want to receive what abraham received let's go to revelation 21. revelation 21 and verse 23 when we talked about the principle of clothing we started there god initiated clothing to cover because the lust veil had come upon his children and the veil of innocy has been taken away and that that god began according to the scriptures continues all the way through to new heavens and new earth but when god initiated tithe tithing runs all the way through new heavens and new earth it's a principle that's before the law in the law after all the old testament after the millennium all the way in new heavens and new earth because it's a principle of god it doesn't fade away let's look at chapter 21 verse 23 and the city had no need of sun neither of moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall not be night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it brother tells us the glory and honor of the nations that they're bringing into it these are not the people who live in the city these are those who are saved that are outside the city that were saved at the white throne judgment and the nations that are outside the city are bringing their tithe and offering their glory and their honor into the city there is a perpetual tithing all the way through eternity and the new heavens and new earth let's skip down now verse chapter 22 uh verse 2 and in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yield her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations the leaves of the tree were not for the healing of the elect the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations what are the nations doing they're breathing their tithe and offering into the city here's what brother benham says in future home the leaves will be for the healing of the nations that is the kings that live and there bring their honor in when they bring their honor in and lay it before the throne of god just like the 11 tribes brought it in every one of them attempt to levi what's brother branham doing he's bringing the principle of tithing all the way here to new heavens and new earth in the new jerusalem just like the 11 tribes brought every one of them attempt to leave i see when they bring their honor in from the blessed land they'll reach from the reach from the tree of life and break off a holy leaf or a tree of life leave and they'll walk out together there is no more war everything is at peace the leaves are a memorial for the healing of the nations this principle is so important to god amen that the the the regions of the saved outside the city when they bring of the increase of the land they bring their their tithe and offering into the land their their uh their glory and their honor into the city and they lay it before the throne they can reach over of the tree of life what's happening here there's an exchange taking place because they honor and reverence god god honors them with eternal life this principle goes all the way through the bible friends if you honor me i'll honor you and the new heavens and earth there's still an honoring our reverence and respect of god and god is allowing them to partake of the tree of life for the healing of the nations perpetually month after month new moon after new moon and i say god be praised if that if that cycle if that picture of that principle is that effective i want it to work in my life i believe it do you believe it how many of you are excited to write out your next title oh i hope you leave from here not beat down not feeling like somebody was correcting but you you have an opportunity to show my love for god and to have that exceeding great portion which is him let's all stand musicians if you would come brother ben if you would come i want to prove that i've met melchizedek and i've communed with him and i want to prove it in bringing my glory and my honor to god now it's not about i have to the precept of man fear of the lord but now i recognize who he is and who i am and what his program is and who honors him he honors and who despises him he lightly esteems i say god i recognize just like just like melchizedek told abraham god delivered the kings to you abraham didn't do anything he was just the hands that god used i've not earned anything i'm just the hands that he uses it's a life he's given me it's the job he's gave me the mind he's given me the tongue the eyes the hand it's all what he's given me and i want to give back to him honor and glory and respect and in return he'll open the windows of heaven he'll curse the devourer he'll not let the vine cast forth he'll protect me you know protect what he's given me and he'll give me of himself i say thank god for that i hope tithing i don't believe it was for most of you a negative thought or idea but i hope it's flipped completely to the wonderful positive absolutely fantastic plan of god for his children to express their love for him let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your goodness and your mercy to us lord god we are so privileged to be able to take part in an active demonstration of your word of our faith in your word you've brought us to an original understanding you've brought us to a greater picture than maybe what we've ever had before and god my desire like never before is to honor you to honor you in my giving to honor you and my tithe to honor you in my dress to honor my conduct and my speech and honor you in every way let me give you honor and praise for your worthy of it oh god i pray to receive it lord with the thanksgiving that's in our heart and lord you've made us promises that if we come that way you've promised us great and precious promises lord and we receive them now by faith lord let the devourer depart because i've kept the word let the vine
