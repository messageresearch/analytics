[0:00] so there's a spoken word but when the
[0:02] spoken word goes
[0:03] it goes and goes and goes
[0:07] looking for a lodging place
[0:10] and there's got to be a predestinated
[0:12] lodging place
[0:15] and that word is moving now there's been
[0:17] a prophet messenger in our day
[0:19] spoke the word of god and that word is
[0:21] moving amen and that word
[0:23] has a predestinated lodging place in the
[0:27] elect
[0:27] predestinated seed of god and that word
[0:30] is moving
[0:31] looking for somebody who will say be it
[0:34] unto me that's the truth i believe
[0:36] i am what you say mary wasn't just
[0:40] saying
[0:40] you're a good messenger you are gabriel
[0:43] amen you
[0:44] are and it's time for that that's not
[0:46] what she was saying friends
[0:47] it wasn't saying you're malachi 4. this
[0:50] is luke 17
[0:51] 30. you're the elijah that's not what
[0:53] she was agreeing to friends
[0:56] amen zacharias wasn't doubting gabriel
[0:59] he wasn't doubting that he was an angel
[1:01] come from the presence of the lord he
[1:03] was doubting his part in the mystery
[1:08] so when mary said amen be it unto me
[1:10] according to my words
[1:11] she wasn't saying i agree you're gabriel
[1:14] i agree you're the messenger and i agree
[1:16] the word you say is true
[1:18] she was saying i agree i
[1:21] am the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy
[1:24] it was a big statement you see friends
[1:26] it wasn't just something that said
[1:28] oh yeah that sounds good amen amen
[1:30] that's the truth amen that's good
[1:32] but she was absolutely actually
[1:33] accepting the fact
[1:35] that when god spoke a word that was in
[1:37] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:39] world
[1:39] that she was the recipient of that word
[1:44] amen this is not agreeing with the
[1:46] message agreeing with the messenger
[1:48] agreeing that brother bran look at those
[1:50] miracles look at those signs
[1:51] obviously he's elijah he did everything
[1:53] he was supposed to be that's the son of
[1:54] man ministry
[1:55] amen that's not the faith that god's
[1:57] looking for in this day
[1:58] he's looking for the faith that mary had
[2:00] that would say you call me bride
[2:03] you say i'm sinless you say that god's
[2:05] gonna bring forth the manifestation of
[2:07] jesus christ through me
[2:09] i'm saying that's the truth and i
[2:11] receive it in the name of jesus
[2:14] it's a much bigger statement than just
[2:17] recognizing
[2:18] that what the messenger says is true
