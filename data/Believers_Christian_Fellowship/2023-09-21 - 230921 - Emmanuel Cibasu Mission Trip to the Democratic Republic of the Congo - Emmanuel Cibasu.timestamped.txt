[10:27] God bless you may be a city musicians
[10:29] thank you
[10:33] while the musicians are going to their
[10:36] places
[10:38] I just want to say it's good to be back
[10:41] home
[10:42] and good to see beautiful faces tonight
[10:47] and
[10:50] I don't know where to start from
[10:55] just want to let you know that there are
[10:58] many many Souls
[11:02] that are being blessed
[11:04] by your stand for the word of God
[11:09] that's the greatest compliment I can
[11:11] bring to you
[11:13] Brothers pastors anybody who would hear
[11:18] about BCF in the stand we do have for
[11:20] this at BCF even in languages that are
[11:24] being translated not English in
[11:27] different languages
[11:29] they get a little bit of
[11:31] Maybe videos coming from this place
[11:34] sermons from this place
[11:37] when they approach you they know you
[11:39] coming from there
[11:41] there is a
[11:43] an atmosphere
[11:45] of love that we would like to have what
[11:50] you have
[11:52] and they are sending greetings to you I
[11:55] might not be able to cover it as we will
[11:57] be going through the the report
[12:02] we are bringing greetings from over
[12:07] 450 or close to 480 pastors
[12:13] of churches representing over 45
[12:19] 000 believers
[12:22] so you can hear the magnitude
[12:25] brother Franco thank you so much for all
[12:28] your work just even to condense the
[12:31] pictures the videos just that I can
[12:33] bring it to share here
[12:35] it's a daunting task itself
[12:38] just to tell you the magnitude I might
[12:41] not be able to tell it all
[12:44] who just want to thank you so much for
[12:47] thanking our pastor and the vision that
[12:50] he has and the church and in your
[12:53] support and the prayers and
[12:56] in all that you have done that I could
[12:58] be sent
[13:00] so because a missionary is someone who
[13:03] is sent if my church my pastor didn't
[13:05] support me in sending me I could not be
[13:08] there so it's you my person you who or
[13:12] the fruit who are the beneficiaries of
[13:15] this report it's not my report it's
[13:17] nobody's report it's your report it's
[13:20] what you believed doing created and I'm
[13:25] just bringing you the feedback of what
[13:26] you did
[13:28] so this is what I'm I'm going to be
[13:29] telling you so if I miss it it's uh it's
[13:34] you it's you who did all this uh this
[13:38] work here
[13:39] so before we we went we go to that
[13:43] there's a little thought that came in I
[13:46] was uh
[13:47] a few years back
[13:49] just reading uh this is the third
[13:51] message that is recorded of the pro of
[13:54] our prophet
[13:56] it recorded 1947. it's one of those uh
[13:59] first messages it's a third message it's
[14:02] uh the angel of God preached in 1947.
[14:06] November 2nd 47. because I believe that
[14:11] even then even before he preached he was
[14:13] still the anointed prophet of the age
[14:16] even before 63
[14:19] is every move he was ordained to be a
[14:23] prophet of this age
[14:25] his very birth it's already a message to
[14:29] us
[14:30] so in this message he's saying something
[14:32] it's a minor Sims great to you but he
[14:37] had little impact upon me
[14:40] the prophet of God goes and say now
[14:43] notice
[14:44] then at the time of the promised
[14:48] they raised up a pharaoh who did not
[14:51] know Joseph we know the story
[14:54] and they put burdens upon the people
[14:57] and the people were so burdened that
[15:00] they could not make the bricks and
[15:02] things that they were supposed to do
[15:05] and then would you think that God would
[15:08] plag his people in in that manner yes
[15:13] for the word of God is eternally true is
[15:16] that right and he promised he would
[15:19] deliver them
[15:20] in no other way he had to do it but this
[15:25] away now I'm looking at it this way
[15:28] he said so therefore at the time of the
[15:31] persecution of Israel
[15:33] then God had an angel to come down to
[15:37] the Earth that's the first thing
[15:41] but before he had the angel come
[15:45] there is a prerequisite there
[15:49] he saw that the children of Israel were
[15:51] in bondage
[15:53] he wanted to deliver them according to
[15:56] his promise he had a promise given to
[15:58] their grandfather great-grandfather
[16:00] Abraham 400 years ago
[16:04] now he wanted to send them an angel to
[16:07] deliver them
[16:08] but before he could send them an angel
[16:12] he had a little boy
[16:15] born down
[16:18] there by the name of Moses
[16:21] so here's a God the great Jehovah
[16:24] wanting willing because he can only be
[16:28] one with his word his word was already
[16:31] given out he was ready to fulfill his
[16:34] word ready to send the mighty Angel but
[16:37] he needed something on the Earth
[16:40] a baby had to be born there
[16:44] now God could have sent the angel down
[16:47] couldn't he he could have let the angel
[16:50] come himself
[16:51] but instead of that he sent the angel to
[16:56] speak through the voice of a man
[17:02] God always used man for his work
[17:08] is that right he don't use organizations
[17:10] also forth in Mechanical Devices but he
[17:14] uses men
[17:16] the Holy Spirit fell upon man that's
[17:20] God's instrument here on Earth
[17:24] with this
[17:26] just skipping it short with the
[17:28] revelation we have sometimes we wonder
[17:31] how this church how are they going to be
[17:34] growing up I know many times I have
[17:37] spoken to my pastor and in other
[17:39] ministers the conditioners have been
[17:41] traveling to the Congo just helping on
[17:44] the charity of which many God bless you
[17:47] families here that have been supporting
[17:50] in any shape in any way to just help
[17:53] those that are in need physically and
[17:56] mostly the churches
[17:57] as I was going there seeing
[18:01] the churches big and small churches
[18:04] within the message
[18:07] and when you are observing coming closer
[18:09] to the brothers of those places maybe
[18:11] they invited us to go and preach there
[18:14] you're finding that he or holding to the
[18:16] message
[18:17] but the life of the message is not
[18:19] within them
[18:23] and I know I I don't condemn them for
[18:26] that because I I used to be that way too
[18:28] and I something just
[18:32] started pounding Within Me how can these
[18:35] people be helped
[18:37] they are by thousands tens of thousands
[18:40] if not hundreds of thousands the Congo
[18:43] if you don't know the um the stats of
[18:46] the message it's the country is I'm
[18:50] gonna show up it has has been the voice
[18:53] of God has uh noted it tactic is the
[18:56] first country that has a great number of
[19:00] message believers
[19:02] and you see those thousands there
[19:06] holding on to the message but the very
[19:09] life the very Spirit the very unction
[19:13] anointing of the message not living in
[19:16] people
[19:18] so it's not daunting on me
[19:21] in a while I
[19:23] read this quote I said
[19:27] I don't have to wait on somebody to do
[19:30] that
[19:31] God I know before you can send your
[19:34] angel you need a little baby Moses to be
[19:36] born there even within his weaknesses
[19:39] you even waited on him to mature you
[19:42] even did what you could to use him
[19:45] you can use anybody God is it any way we
[19:49] can find a way to go and start bringing
[19:53] this message to those that already have
[19:55] the message because it seems that they
[19:57] have it but there's no life inside
[20:00] so that's the burden was getting growing
[20:04] bigger as we were helping the charity
[20:06] with the charity work in the Congo the
[20:09] charity work was mostly among message
[20:11] believers
[20:13] and that's what I did that observation
[20:17] that God is it anything you can do
[20:21] and I know that as I was praying the
[20:24] Lord just seeming to lead me that
[20:27] we have brothers here in this country
[20:30] that are that has already he got matured
[20:33] that could be
[20:35] come sharing the same light to those
[20:38] people in in the messages in many places
[20:42] so last year's yesterday last year to
[20:45] give it a short brother Randy Sayers I
[20:47] will be showing him
[20:49] so I spoke to him
[20:52] um they invited me to go this is brother
[20:53] Nathaniel Sciences Church brother Randy
[20:56] uh is his father he was a pastor for the
[21:01] last 47 years so brother Nathaniel
[21:04] science became the pastor as of January
[21:07] of this year but last year as they
[21:10] invited me I went to share the word of
[21:11] God so after the service we were just
[21:14] fellowshipping and I was just telling
[21:15] him about the burden that was upon me
[21:18] for those thousands of Believers in the
[21:21] Congo
[21:22] and then brother uh Randy is telling me
[21:27] that you know what
[21:29] 40 years ago I have told my wife without
[21:32] knowing that I would be one day in the
[21:34] Congo
[21:37] I said after the service I had an
[21:41] intention and I was asking you if
[21:44] possible that we can go to the Congo
[21:47] but yet he was still the pastor it was
[21:49] last year
[21:51] though so we we just put it under the
[21:54] rug last year and then after January
[21:58] first that he was no longer pastoring
[22:00] the church God touched him that he felt
[22:02] the burden to be on a mission field
[22:06] then he called me up and then we start
[22:09] talking if you know brother Randy signs
[22:11] we can talk on the phone for two hours
[22:13] so we did a lot of talking and then we I
[22:19] agree that we would plan a trip to go to
[22:22] the Congo and I told him okay so I need
[22:24] to let my pastor know so we did I spoke
[22:28] to my pastor was uh something he gave me
[22:30] the green light so we we planned for the
[22:33] trip
[22:34] and this is something so he came to
[22:37] remember that he told his wife not
[22:39] knowing why he would just said 40 years
[22:42] ago that he would be in the Congo so we
[22:44] made all the arrangement to get him the
[22:46] Visa so that's how we ended up going to
[22:50] the Congo uh this uh last month in
[22:53] August
[22:55] and so before I start the slides I just
[23:00] want to say thank you again to my pastor
[23:04] into the church
[23:05] to the brothers sometimes it's easy to
[23:08] forget I know the brothers when I travel
[23:10] to Africa the Congo they give me
[23:13] clothing sisters here I don't want to
[23:15] embarrass you they give me clothing for
[23:17] the Sisters back there they are very
[23:19] appreciated
[23:22] it's we don't have time to say those
[23:25] things up here but you'll find sisters
[23:27] with only one dress
[23:29] maybe two dresses that's what they have
[23:32] a brother that have no shoes maybe you
[23:34] have sandals or something's been using
[23:36] and a little thing you have done one
[23:39] would be give maybe a hundred dollars
[23:40] here and there in churches they have
[23:42] many needs so you'll just go some throw
[23:46] some of them here and I just don't want
[23:49] to forget that I would tell all of you
[23:52] that everything you have done for your
[23:55] brothers and sisters is very much
[23:57] appreciated
[23:58] God richly bless you it's beyond words
[24:01] so brother Franco I'm I want to start I
[24:04] don't know we can go quicker
[24:07] so this is the uh the country Democratic
[24:10] Republic of the Congo we we left no
[24:14] August 9th
[24:16] and we return back September 12th so 31
[24:21] days as a brother Chad said
[24:23] on the ground in the country and three
[24:25] days flying so over the seas over the
[24:29] Lakes you can can tell it so
[24:34] this is uh the country itself it's uh
[24:37] it's about 112 million it's the 15th
[24:42] most populated country in the world
[24:44] so they have official languages they
[24:46] have French for those that go attend
[24:48] school and they have four national
[24:50] languages four national languages one
[24:53] north east north west north east south
[24:56] west south east
[24:58] and beyond that this is gonna crack you
[25:00] they have
[25:04] 420 dialects
[25:08] meaning when we're moving from one
[25:10] Province to another Province ahead to be
[25:13] the translation from English into French
[25:15] I have one speaking in one language we
[25:18] go in another Province French English
[25:20] French and other language so think that
[25:23] they are places that it's French one
[25:27] language and dialects
[25:29] it's you cannot comprehend it but that's
[25:32] the way it is so 95 are Christians and
[25:36] the capital is inches I would have to go
[25:38] uh quicker so you'll see where we
[25:41] um Africa the country is there so we
[25:44] flew from Cleveland to Chicago Chicago
[25:46] Brussels from Brussels we headed down to
[25:50] Kinshasa so Chicago Brussels almost
[25:53] eight and a half hours or nine and
[25:55] Brussels to Kinshasa had Aiden eight
[25:58] hours and 30 minutes
[26:01] then that's the country it's uh we
[26:04] landed in the south west which is the
[26:08] Kinshasa let's see okay
[26:10] that's we spent there two weeks then we
[26:13] took a flight two and a half hour flight
[26:15] to Goma it's Northeast
[26:18] and then from there we took a ship going
[26:22] down to bokavo the second town there and
[26:25] then a week later we were turned back to
[26:27] Kinshasa from Kinshasa we went to the
[26:30] another Province South in bansango there
[26:34] so that's brother Randy science for
[26:36] those that don't know him I know he's a
[26:39] good friend bro to brother Tom sister
[26:41] Barb and many of us here that's brother
[26:43] Randy there and his wife sister Alice
[26:46] and on the left his uh sitting on his uh
[26:49] suitcase
[26:51] we're at the airport there so I took
[26:53] that shot and said hey my buddy we're

[26:58] a little selfie there so
[27:00] as 120 years together of selfie two
[27:04] people two people 120 years together so
[27:07] and then so we landed in Kinshasa
[27:11] um that's the family we stayed in that
[27:14] the home of the brother and sister and
[27:16] his daughter in between us for about 24
[27:20] days so his wife his daughter and his
[27:23] wife they were cooked they were cooking
[27:27] for us because they don't have just
[27:29] microwaves or things in the freezer and
[27:31] put in a microwave they had to go do
[27:34] shoppings and make and make sure they
[27:36] cook good because they wanted to keep us
[27:39] safe from not getting sick so everything
[27:41] cooked and they would wake up four in
[27:43] the morning
[27:44] get our breakfast by seven seven in the
[27:46] morning our breakfast was ready seven
[27:48] seven thirty sometimes breakfast was
[27:51] ready by 5 30 if we have to leave early
[27:53] they were just working tirelessly by
[27:56] noon or one o'clock food because we had
[27:59] ministers that came to visit us every
[28:02] time we had if we didn't have a service
[28:04] in the morning we had a question and
[28:06] answer with the ministers so I've been
[28:08] talking for more than a month
[28:12] because you have to take from Brother
[28:13] Randy to tell those people whatever
[28:16] anybody says the brother Randy I had the
[28:18] translation I've been sometimes I've
[28:20] been closing my minds but speaking
[28:23] and they would feel sorry for me because
[28:25] we have to go to the service that
[28:26] evening
[28:27] so
[28:29] and then so that's them their house so
[28:32] this is the first place we we went for
[28:35] the service we arrived on Thursday a
[28:37] night and then we had to travel to go to
[28:41] a remote area on Friday early morning
[28:45] and that's the place we went I'm showing
[28:48] them the reason I'm showing this is uh
[28:50] because those buildings are in addition
[28:53] to their church and it's a throw our
[28:56] church here contributed to those that
[28:59] have contributed to literal our charity
[29:01] that's the money that built that church
[29:03] to add because people have been just
[29:05] coming to church and the church is uh
[29:08] the people it's growing so they have to
[29:10] do some additions to the church so this
[29:13] is you that's your money what you've
[29:15] been supporting in any shape in any way
[29:18] so this is you doing that
[29:19] so you can see that the roof the
[29:22] addition then all the church was on the
[29:25] left even the chairs it's you guys who
[29:28] have been helping there so this is
[29:31] before we got to that church that's the
[29:33] job we had to do on the road a couple
[29:34] times because you can go with a Jeep you
[29:37] have to stop somewhere there's no roads
[29:39] there may be a little stream of water
[29:40] have to create something so you can you
[29:43] can cross else you can be walking for
[29:45] Miles so brother Randy and I and the
[29:48] brothers we're trying to get some older
[29:51] Metals somewhere hey create a put
[29:53] somewhere to have a little road so the
[29:55] Jeep that's behind there can come it
[29:58] crosses then we can go back in it
[30:00] so that's brother Randy getting
[30:03] acquainted with the people in that
[30:05] little village is saying hi to a sister
[30:09] there
[30:10] quick so we have the service that
[30:12] evening with brother Randy at that
[30:14] church just go quick so that's a little
[30:17] congregation not little congression it
[30:19] has over um in Kinshasa in the Congo yes
[30:23] 350 Believers there so
[30:26] and after the service some ministers and
[30:29] we have some Sunday school there was
[30:31] we're around there
[30:34] um wonderful time so we had the weekend
[30:36] Friday and then Saturday Saturday
[30:39] morning we went visiting some sisters
[30:41] and some brothers little houses though
[30:44] they were sick they were in need and
[30:46] just just being acquainted to one
[30:49] another as we were brothers and so let's
[30:51] talk together
[30:52] and then we this is another a week after
[30:56] the weekend we just passed it so this is
[30:59] a church the reason I'm showing brother
[31:01] Randy myself there's a pastor on
[31:04] my left side and there was a lady there
[31:07] this late the pastor they just bought a
[31:10] new place new location they were
[31:12] building
[31:13] they put a foundation to build the
[31:15] church they didn't tell anybody in the
[31:18] area that we're building a church
[31:20] and then that lady she was a neighbor
[31:22] she's a Seventh Day Adventist she had a
[31:25] dream
[31:26] in her dream so she came to see the
[31:28] pastor
[31:30] that I have a dream that I want to tell
[31:33] you so
[31:34] that's coming back so the dream was that
[31:37] is she said I know that I don't know
[31:40] what you're building but in my dream it
[31:42] showed me that you're Building a Church
[31:44] and before this church could be complete
[31:47] this white men two people one is white
[31:50] and one is black they're coming here to
[31:52] preach at this church and as we will be
[31:54] preaching the power of God will be
[31:57] spreading in the entire neighborhood and
[32:00] it's going to be lingering for a long
[32:02] long time
[32:03] so she told him in February in February
[32:08] brother Randy and I have not even
[32:10] finalized for the trip yet we finalized
[32:12] it in May
[32:13] so that's in February and the brother
[32:16] said I don't see any white men coming in
[32:18] to preach I don't even know how how long
[32:21] the church will be taking to build
[32:22] because I don't even have enough money
[32:25] so he forgot about it and in May there's
[32:29] a brother who was doing
[32:31] um scheduling for us to go to certain
[32:34] churches because there were just so many
[32:36] people on the list and he the brother
[32:38] who was scheduling happened to remember
[32:39] that oh there's a brother he had a she
[32:42] had a church but they are moving to a
[32:44] certain place to build the church I
[32:45] don't know if he would be interested but
[32:47] we can go to his church so he called him
[32:49] up
[32:50] say that hey I have a are you open to
[32:54] receive some ministers he said we we
[32:57] relocated we're trying to build a church
[33:00] we're not even ready yet and the brother
[33:02] said okay I'm going to put your name on
[33:04] the list that they want to be coming to
[33:05] your church he had no idea where were
[33:08] they coming from he said okay just put
[33:10] my name there but it was when we arrived
[33:12] and he was already scheduled that we
[33:15] came to church you know he came to visit
[33:17] us first at the brother's home
[33:20] and then he found out that oh brother
[33:22] Randy was white and I was we're coming
[33:24] from America he said there's something
[33:27] let me go back then he found out there
[33:30] was a
[33:31] dream that has a sister a neighbor told
[33:35] the
[33:36] told him so when we had service he
[33:38] called that neighbor to come and just
[33:40] relate to us what the dream was about so
[33:43] this is the church we we went there we
[33:45] can see it they don't have roof so they
[33:48] need a roof right now uh even the it's a
[33:51] bare floor but they're trying their best
[33:52] people it's a new area the people are
[33:55] just coming to the message so they're
[33:57] flowing in and so it's if it's rain they
[34:00] have to to stop the service so that's
[34:03] what we preached so it's a brother Randy
[34:06] myself there and the Believers there
[34:09] that's the church it was getting darker
[34:12] so we we had to just keep going and
[34:16] after the service
[34:18] we don't probably I don't have those
[34:20] pictures you have to deserves the power
[34:22] of God because when we just to mention
[34:24] that sometimes the music we are just so
[34:29] blessed that
[34:31] it's a revelation
[34:33] he has not hit many churches yet who are
[34:37] sitting there
[34:38] before we can even come to the pulpit to
[34:41] just preach the music was making our
[34:45] bodies vibrating
[34:48] too loud
[34:49] and uh
[34:50] as we knew that most churches will be
[34:53] finding things like that except in a few
[34:55] churches when we would come the first
[34:58] thing we would look at the musicians
[35:00] could you
[35:02] bring down the base
[35:05] you'll stop playing just the piano
[35:07] itself could you bring the music low so
[35:10] we're setting that in almost every
[35:12] Church except in a few and as they would
[35:15] play
[35:16] themselves they have to tell us after
[35:19] the service that we have never had a
[35:21] service like this
[35:22] just melowness just quietness and then
[35:26] the Holy Spirit would start the word of
[35:28] God setting the atmosphere and after the
[35:31] service people were just those that were
[35:33] just getting healed or had many
[35:36] testimonies at people just being touched
[35:39] by the Lord and some just making a
[35:41] commitment
[35:42] most places more than 75 percent before
[35:47] I skipped that of pastors after the
[35:50] service they would come back in the back
[35:52] room the pastor would say could you
[35:54] please pray for me
[35:55] I want to come back to what you brought
[35:58] it's the message I've been preaching for
[36:01] 25 years or plus but I have not this
[36:04] atmosphere in the church I don't have
[36:06] this result I want could you pray for me
[36:08] who said if you that's your desire
[36:11] that's already your prayer so it was um
[36:14] just that and when they had people to be
[36:17] baptized or just tell them please do as
[36:20] you always do take them because we don't
[36:22] want them to think that special people
[36:24] baptize them you just take them after
[36:26] service as you always do just to keep
[36:29] things like that so this is in another
[36:31] church and the reason I'm putting it
[36:34] there is always a little Charity here
[36:36] whatever your support that's the church
[36:39] will give them some means to build up a
[36:42] church so it was still in construction
[36:44] they wanted us to come and preach anyway
[36:47] so brother Randy's and
[36:49] a pastor's office there
[36:52] preparing for the service
[36:53] so dusty but I said hey we're here for
[36:56] the word of God so that's the church so
[36:59] the congregation here you provided the
[37:02] roof there so everything you see there
[37:04] is built with little help here
[37:07] and the pastor in the congregation they
[37:09] are very appreciative of every little
[37:11] thing that we we do for them that's the
[37:15] place
[37:17] and then that's uh brother Randy and I
[37:19] going to the pulpit and the past of that
[37:22] congregation
[37:23] this is a miracle because he came to see
[37:26] us he couldn't preach someone was
[37:28] preaching couple people were preaching
[37:29] there for a couple of weeks he has
[37:32] sciatic nerves he couldn't stand up he
[37:35] came to visit us at the home of the
[37:37] brother
[37:38] as we just prayed together this is the
[37:41] prayer of faith and two days after he
[37:43] called us he said you know what when you
[37:45] will be coming to appreciate my place
[37:46] I'll be walking
[37:47] God has touched me has healed me so he's
[37:50] there testifying
[37:52] and then this little place there have a
[37:55] little video I can go quick I hope
[38:00] this little small church
[38:03] this is before the service after the
[38:06] service it was overflowing outside
[38:09] people were standing some have to get
[38:11] new chairs just to come out there
[38:15] and again
[38:17] this place a little Charity here
[38:19] provided for some chairs provided for
[38:22] the tin roof and whatever they have
[38:24] there so these are places as we go we
[38:27] see the needs of people Desiring to do
[38:30] God's will so we are happy to join in
[38:34] whatever way we can do to to be together
[38:37] so that's the congregation
[38:40] now we passed us another another church
[38:43] so that's the pastor of a church myself
[38:45] brother Randy that's his congregation
[38:47] almost same thing
[38:48] and then here it's uh the brother has a
[38:53] big house and he has it has three level
[38:55] the third level he put it just it's like
[38:59] a church in his home that every time he
[39:01] has visitors he goes up he calls us the
[39:03] upper room so we were receiving in the
[39:05] morning after breakfast receiving
[39:07] ministers and it will have a question
[39:09] and answers uh series or just praying
[39:13] there together sharing something
[39:14] together before we go to another service
[39:17] so after
[39:19] Minister's meeting question and answers
[39:21] we would come down and just get
[39:24] something to eat and then everybody
[39:26] would be talking I'd be exhausted all
[39:29] the time talking back and forth so I was
[39:31] talking twice as much
[39:34] okay this is another congregation we
[39:36] went in uh this is the past congregation
[39:39] very excited by the word that was
[39:41] hearing uh the place
[39:44] and then one day we took off uh brother
[39:46] Randy and I who went in town so we can
[39:49] just get some free free air so that's
[39:52] him and I there in Kinshasa there are
[39:54] some ministers visiting us the one in
[39:57] between brother Randy and I brother
[39:59] Roger has come here twice has visited us
[40:02] so we we had him with us because he was
[40:06] the one who knows the the Easter
[40:08] provinces I never been there so we
[40:10] wanted him to be with us so we got the
[40:14] to go together
[40:15] this is another congregation we who are
[40:19] in
[40:21] um
[40:22] brother Randy and I so you see those
[40:25] similar this is Brother Rogers a little
[40:28] church so has probably over 300 inside
[40:31] there so
[40:33] we went there so people
[40:35] and then that's another church just go
[40:38] quick another church then we traveled
[40:40] from Kinshasa to Goma the pastor closer
[40:44] to me and uh with brother Randy brother
[40:47] Roger and there is a trustee there they
[40:50] came to get us from the airport they
[40:52] took us to the hotel it's a Catholic
[40:55] Hotel this is the the window from the
[40:58] hotel that's the lake there so we were
[41:01] like Moses in the pharaoh's house so who
[41:04] were in the Catholic Hotel said they
[41:06] don't know what we're doing here we're
[41:08] destroying their works
[41:10] yeah
[41:11] and then we had to preach at one Church
[41:14] there let me see I think it's a little
[41:17] video there they put them put together
[41:19] we had
[41:21] we had four meetings this place a
[41:24] weekend and the ministers meeting in
[41:26] every city every Province would have a
[41:28] Minister's meeting
[41:30] so they were coming in by hundreds
[41:37] [Music]
[41:46] so
[41:48] there's a little worship there
[41:54] one of the few
[41:56] the worship could still be
[41:59] regulated by the Holy Spirit
[42:07] [Music]
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:08] [Music]
[42:18] [Music]
[42:26] very nice brother the pastor there very
[42:30] very humble brother and he said please
[42:32] tell your pastor many of them tell your
[42:35] pastor and ministers they were waiting
[42:37] for you here so so anytime so that's
[42:41] where at his place after the services
[42:42] the weekend services so he's there
[42:45] brother Randy the pastor and myself
[42:47] then we head to the next morning we had
[42:50] to take a ship to travel to bokavu
[42:53] brother Randy and I on the ship with
[42:55] brother Roger on a big lake the lake is
[42:58] between separating the Congo and two
[43:01] more countries so we're on that Lake for
[43:04] uh seven hours
[43:05] therefore we got the bokavo so this is a
[43:08] place we had to preach for another
[43:10] weekend I think we had three-day meeting
[43:12] also a three-day meeting and one
[43:15] Minister's meeting mostly four meetings
[43:16] at that place too that's the little
[43:18] church and we provided also for the
[43:21] windows they didn't have windows they're
[43:23] still building so here and there so this
[43:26] is you'll see your your work there again
[43:28] a little video there
[43:30] very poor area
[43:35] foreign
[43:41] [Music]
[43:54] [Music]
[43:58] [Applause]
[43:59] [Music]
[44:04] this is before before the service start
[44:07] started so after the service the people
[44:10] outside they have to take speaker phones
[44:12] outside so because of the Overflow
[44:15] a flow crowd crowd so this is the inside
[44:19] brother Randy and I preaching there and
[44:23] then this is The Minister's meeting they
[44:25] came pastors some of them took boats to
[44:28] come to join us some of them airplanes
[44:30] we've even provided for we helped some
[44:32] to get the tickets to come and join us
[44:34] the world needing wanting so bad to come
[44:36] from other provinces because the Congo
[44:39] has 26 provinces so we only went to four
[44:42] so people from other provinces were hey
[44:45] why don't you come to all places because
[44:47] we haven't seen any ministers from
[44:49] America for a long time and we want to
[44:51] be a part of it so we would we did
[44:54] manage to provide tickets for some other
[44:56] people some were coming by by Ship by
[45:01] by by cars
[45:03] so this after The Minister's meeting
[45:07] questions and answers so it would take
[45:09] probably half a day
[45:10] just to go with the ministers meeting
[45:14] good settings so these are sisters that
[45:16] were taking care of us I took a little
[45:18] snap they were cooking for the brothers
[45:20] they have all those four days three day
[45:23] meeting and we went to another small
[45:25] Church there wasn't that big because you
[45:28] will say that we will go to churches of
[45:30] thousands but there were some Churches
[45:32] maybe 20 people 30. they invited us we
[45:35] had to go do the same thing so just be
[45:38] one with them that's a little
[45:39] congregation somewhere
[45:42] okay you preach there and then we're
[45:44] leaving now bokavu you can see how the
[45:47] it's crowded there we'll get into that
[45:50] big ship ship there
[45:53] and so when we came back to Goma you
[45:57] will see something there the poor Poor's
[45:59] name
[46:01] poor Emmanuel seems like they were
[46:03] respecting me there
[46:05] they baptized support because they know
[46:07] they knew I was coming
[46:10] yeah so and then we a brother we headed
[46:14] to go to another church just in the open
[46:17] so they don't have any roof they're
[46:18] sitting outside yeah they invited us to
[46:20] say hey we're here for the world we
[46:22] don't care about outside so let's just
[46:24] uh so we're there and it's getting
[46:26] darker so somewhere had a little lamps
[46:29] back
[46:30] and then we we came back to Kinshasa
[46:33] this is a Minister's meeting uh this
[46:36] meeting I think we had over 250
[46:38] ministers
[46:40] they were there and after The Minister's
[46:43] meeting because just telling them how
[46:47] things have they have opened the doors
[46:50] that let the enemy flood in with his
[46:53] music with his uh just anything within
[46:56] the message church and just bring them
[46:58] to the word the word and so the pastors
[47:01] were weeping of the service the
[47:04] atmosphere were singing somewhere just
[47:07] on knees crying and after the service
[47:10] they said you know what we want the
[47:12] Revival to come back in our churches we
[47:14] are guilty these are pastors have been
[47:18] pastoring their churches for years they
[47:21] are coming they were coming just so
[47:22] simply and said we don't want nothing
[47:25] but this word the life to come back in
[47:29] in our churches were guilty because we
[47:32] in another pastors said I inherited this
[47:35] from my past so I just knew that this is
[47:37] this was good to let this kind of music
[47:39] and this kind of thing I never knew any
[47:41] better so
[47:43] those are kind of things you're finding
[47:44] there so this was life because they have
[47:46] some people across Africa even Europe
[47:49] streaming so the ministers meeting or
[47:51] slim the lives you can there
[47:54] and so the next day we had to preach to
[47:57] that church too and that's the inside of
[47:59] the church this is
[48:02] it's outside people or people are it's
[48:06] overflowing so outside people are
[48:08] standing on the hallways and sitting
[48:10] outside so
[48:12] and we had a little video there of the
[48:15] worship after the service
[48:19] this about this church contains about
[48:22] seven thousand
[48:24] believers
[48:26] even with the camera it was difficult to
[48:28] get the size
[48:34] and after the service even the pastor
[48:36] everybody will just come and recognize
[48:38] that you know what please come back
[48:40] again
[48:41] what what you have started and this is
[48:43] it seems like this is the first time
[48:45] that when we went in we were above their
[48:48] doctrines just the word no Doctrine
[48:51] because every time any American Minister
[48:54] would go there he would stay with the
[48:55] people that believes the way he sees
[48:58] things
[48:58] and this time we included everybody even
[49:03] where we know that these are completely
[49:05] in the world we will go there as long
[49:07] they believe the message will go there
[49:08] that you know what we have the right God
[49:11] will come down but we've got to be the
[49:13] Moses that he can send the angel on us
[49:15] let's speak to them so that's how we
[49:18] work and then from there we went to
[49:20] another Province this is the lower
[49:23] church out Church inside
[49:27] the brother or India and some ministers
[49:29] and we had a ministers meeting the
[49:31] following day we had a three-day
[49:33] meetings there with the ministers
[49:35] meetings as well
[49:36] came back again to Kinshasa this is one
[49:39] Church
[49:40] this one
[49:42] this doesn't show it it has it has a
[49:45] large basement that contained over three
[49:48] or four thousand Believers the cry room
[49:50] I showed prank of one of the Kratom they
[49:53] have to cry room one might be just this
[49:55] is a cry room another one
[49:58] so this church should be a crime room
[50:01] so this they had
[50:04] they said on Sunday if it's packed it's
[50:07] 21 000.
[50:09] and they have another building nearby
[50:12] that they would put eight thousand more
[50:14] there so 29 000 but in this church so
[50:18] this is the inside of it but we brought
[50:21] already and I we couldn't speak there
[50:22] because of uh stole the brother chat
[50:24] about it that the ministers so we didn't
[50:26] feel the LED to do that for now
[50:30] so that's the church inside you will see
[50:32] the pictures of the the pastors almost
[50:35] over the place so we we didn't speak
[50:38] there
[50:39] but um it's a brother Randy is standing
[50:42] there
[50:43] and then you will find some small
[50:45] churches and to supporting supporting uh
[50:48] putting the roof there I said hey do
[50:50] what it is in a remote Village so we're
[50:53] helping them to do that
[50:55] and then this is another church brother
[50:58] Diego Richard has come here in 2003 when
[51:02] we're still in all the sanctuary
[51:05] and um
[51:06] invests the church we preached there too
[51:11] that's the worship
[51:17] this is about 11 000 when it's stacked
[51:22] 11 to 12.
[51:24] [Music]
[51:32] [Applause]

[51:39] [Music]
[51:51] oh yeah
[51:53] foreign
[51:56] so those are your brothers then sisters
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] he has kept the word
[52:04] even the worship even the yours see the
[52:07] life you can fully easily recognize the
[52:10] Believers from this
[52:12] Church any place because of the Stanley
[52:15] stand
[52:16] in the world
[52:18] [Music]
[52:25] it's so beautiful who cannot cover it on
[52:28] the cell phone
[52:32] [Music]
[52:37] and that's the pastor there in between
[52:39] me and brother Randy brother diyoka he
[52:42] has come has come here in 2003 uh
[52:45] preached for us here and then he has a
[52:50] printing facility
[52:53] they do the translation of the message
[52:55] from English into French they have
[52:58] completed from English and to French all
[53:00] the messages
[53:01] they are now
[53:03] printing messages for even other
[53:06] countries with fun message print for
[53:08] Hindu to send to India message to send
[53:11] to Angola message to send to Brazil to
[53:14] to Spain so they in many languages it's
[53:19] huge I I don't know what I probably took
[53:22] is probably maybe one tenth or one
[53:25] fifteenth of the building so just to
[53:27] show a lot of machines a lot of work and
[53:30] he's doing it with just a little money
[53:32] from his church he
[53:34] we we
[53:35] shared together he said sometimes he
[53:38] needs he has message books printed
[53:40] because of proofread and corrected but
[53:44] sometimes it needs a means or bicycles
[53:46] to send to some other areas where
[53:48] there's no trucks or boats or ship could
[53:51] could reach
[53:52] so these are when I show this is
[53:56] this is just the ink room the ink room
[53:58] is almost half of the congregation just
[54:00] for the ink of the uh of the way
[54:03] correctness
[54:05] the ink that's being used to print
[54:07] message books people are working there
[54:09] he has over 70 I think between 50 and 70
[54:13] people that are full-time
[54:15] sometimes with a little less salary just
[54:17] ensuring that the message has to be
[54:19] printed and shipped out
[54:21] they're translating so
[54:26] that's the when they are proofreading
[54:29] and then we went to another church there
[54:32] and this we were about to come back home
[54:34] on Sunday we forgot that there was a
[54:37] brother who wanted us to preach on his
[54:38] church and it was Sunday we had to go to
[54:40] the airport we already dressed up like
[54:42] like Cowboys or I don't know so he said
[54:45] no you've got to come in you've got to
[54:47] come in you cannot go so we were walking
[54:49] in the church right now
[54:51] so that's Brother Andy and neither of
[54:54] the pulpit on Sunday morning in the
[54:56] congregation just to exhort to speak
[54:58] something that we would encourage them
[55:00] so I said brother we cannot do this look
[55:03] how he said I don't people don't care
[55:05] about how you're dressed up come on here
[55:07] so I did that
[55:10] and then we were happy to get back home
[55:13] oh brother Franco we made it over 80
[55:16] slice of made it in less than an hour
[55:19] so that's all that we had but overall
[55:32] God bless you overall we we are the one
[55:36] to thank you and to clap hands for God
[55:38] for what uh he's been doing and he's
[55:42] doing it because there's a Moses on
[55:43] Earth here so that angel is walking
[55:46] through you guys to send us on a mission
[55:48] the work is great it's it's a lot so it
[55:53] seems like that as I've been going there
[55:55] with the experience there's a lot to do
[55:58] a lot to do the people that have
[56:00] received this precious word they don't
[56:03] know what it is they don't know what it
[56:05] is somebody has to to
[56:07] translated
[56:09] within their own language to tell them
[56:11] what is inside what is it so they have
[56:14] the message but they just need the
[56:16] people that can bring the anointing of
[56:19] the message to them the very life of the
[56:21] message to them going there I don't want
[56:25] to say this but I'm I'm thinking I said
[56:28] can I sit in the office
[56:30] getting money thousands of dollars with
[56:33] what I've seen there thousand dollars
[56:35] don't make any anything sense to me
[56:38] I would rather have maybe a few pennies
[56:40] but being there to help others because
[56:42] the time is so precious
[56:44] this message this is the only hope
[56:48] this is the only Abiding Place this is
[56:51] the only blood
[56:54] judgment is coming he's on the way and
[56:57] the only way we can save people it's
[56:59] presenting this message in its trueness
[57:03] so it's um it's it's changing your
[57:07] perspective of life
[57:09] what we used to see like great things in
[57:11] life they become completely no reason no
[57:14] value
[57:15] no value at all
[57:18] yeah it's a it's a great but thank you
[57:21] so much for sending us
[57:23] for all you do they are expecting as I
[57:25] said please do not stop this should not
[57:28] be the first please come on come come
[57:31] and visit us anytime bring us encourage
[57:33] us so the only purpose in every
[57:35] congregation we were we just want to
[57:37] encourage them that you are on the right
[57:39] path but you know what let God come in
[57:42] create an atmosphere let your music
[57:44] create an atmosphere that God could come
[57:47] and import life to you guys because he
[57:51] cannot come in shouting you're making
[57:53] noise you're doing everything loud music
[57:55] no create and they saw it as we're
[57:58] coming in every congregation we would
[58:00] just create that atmosphere
[58:03] and they will see they said we have
[58:05] never heard the word just simple word
[58:07] simple message but just the atmosphere
[58:10] was there and God could come stake the
[58:13] same words sentences they have heard
[58:15] many years and be real new to them
[58:20] in life was important to them many
[58:23] details but I don't want to take your
[58:26] time uh I think we have probably 10
[58:29] minutes there we can if you don't mind
[58:32] we can stand and just read the
[58:34] scripture I don't have anything special
[58:36] just encouraging you with something that
[58:40] God just is burning within me I don't
[58:42] know where I'm going to be going with it
[58:43] but I just want to read it so as a word
[58:46] of God
[58:47] you can turn it into
[58:51] Isaiah chapter 32.
[59:01] and thanks again for your patience
[59:10] it's just a little simple thing it's not
[59:13] something deep I
[59:15] maybe maybe after I talk to my pastor he
[59:18] will show me more or the Lord will
[59:20] reveal more to unto this
[59:23] it's Isaiah 32 it's we can just be
[59:26] reading uh the first of four verses
[59:31] behold the king shall reign in
[59:33] righteousness
[59:34] and princes shall rule in judgment
[59:39] and a man shall be as a hiding place
[59:43] from the wind who heard that
[59:46] who heard that
[59:48] who saw that a man
[59:51] shall be as in a hiding place from the
[59:53] wind
[59:55] in the cover from The Tempest
[59:58] is the rivers of water in a dry place
[1:00:01] is the shadow of a great rock in a weary
[1:00:04] land
[1:00:05] now there are people that saw that
[1:00:09] and there are people that heard that
[1:00:12] what just Isaiah under inspiration is
[1:00:16] saying that a man
[1:00:19] in a man shall be as in a hiding place
[1:00:24] verse 3 said in the eyes of them that
[1:00:27] see
[1:00:29] they just saw what happened in versa 2.
[1:00:32] shall not be dim
[1:00:35] in the ears of them that here shall
[1:00:38] hearken
[1:00:40] the heart also of the rash shall
[1:00:43] understand knowledge in the tongue of
[1:00:46] the stemmerer shall be ready to speak
[1:00:50] plainly
[1:00:52] it's bowhead again you can pray precious
[1:00:54] Lord we just read your word
[1:00:57] father just something simple it's
[1:01:00] burning within us as we look in the
[1:01:02] scripture we can see your your prince
[1:01:06] everywhere
[1:01:07] in what you are trying to achieve Lord
[1:01:10] through these bodies you created you
[1:01:13] ordain us to be your representative on
[1:01:16] this Earth we just love you so much as
[1:01:19] you're revealing Lord what this pride is
[1:01:22] she's seeing things she's hearing things
[1:01:25] and she can only speak
[1:01:28] be with us father bless the reading of
[1:01:30] the word in Jesus Christ then we pray
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:33] maybe seated again just a few minutes as
[1:01:36] I was reading this
[1:01:38] just a little father is a man
[1:01:42] shall be an hiding place
[1:01:46] that's strange there because we know
[1:01:48] that God as we know it God is my Hiding
[1:01:51] Place even in the psalm
[1:01:53] uh the book of Psalm
[1:01:57] 32 verse 7 in David is speaking saying
[1:02:02] Thou Art my Hiding Place and that's God
[1:02:05] thou shall preserve me from trouble
[1:02:09] Thou shalt Compass me about with songs
[1:02:12] of Deliverance Sila and after he
[1:02:15] finished that the verse 8 God is
[1:02:18] answering to David
[1:02:20] that I will instruct thee and teach thee
[1:02:24] in the way which thou shall go I will
[1:02:27] guide thee with mine I in the prophet of
[1:02:30] God in the messenger God's Great
[1:02:32] presence
[1:02:34] they are in the message God's eye he
[1:02:36] said I love that speak I love that David
[1:02:40] speaking that God is his hiding place
[1:02:45] how I love to think that we have a
[1:02:47] hiding place
[1:02:49] that's God's Great presence can be our
[1:02:53] hiding place
[1:02:55] so in this message the prophet of God
[1:02:56] wants to show us that God great presence
[1:02:59] is our hiding place
[1:03:03] this is not only his presence his great
[1:03:06] presence
[1:03:08] and the prophet of God is going to be
[1:03:09] showing us what what is the greatness of
[1:03:12] God how is it shaped in which form his
[1:03:15] greatness is manifested
[1:03:18] he said God's Great presence can be our
[1:03:21] hiding place where we can hide from the
[1:03:24] things of the world and World troubles
[1:03:27] arrived here is our hiding place
[1:03:33] now how could we fathom the greatness of
[1:03:36] his presence
[1:03:38] the prophet of God says that he
[1:03:41] hides himself
[1:03:44] in simplicity
[1:03:46] and reveals himself
[1:03:48] in the same
[1:03:50] so meaning he's not leaving that place
[1:03:53] God is still here
[1:03:55] hiding himself in that Simplicity and
[1:03:58] revealing himself in that simplicity so
[1:04:00] he he dwells there
[1:04:03] he dwells in that simplicity and the
[1:04:06] prophet of God tells us says we don't
[1:04:07] even have time he said that Simplicity
[1:04:10] it's only the word of God
[1:04:13] when Adam and and his bride in the in
[1:04:16] the Garden of Eden
[1:04:18] God fills all space they think that God
[1:04:21] was absent when they they fell
[1:04:25] and then afterwards they heard the voice
[1:04:26] of God's presence coming them they think
[1:04:29] oh maybe he was somewhere else he's just
[1:04:31] coming back to us no it was the word
[1:04:34] because they stepped out of his word and
[1:04:37] then they were hiding from him instead
[1:04:40] of being hid in his word
[1:04:44] in in the book of Ephesians the Paul
[1:04:46] said for far above all principalities is
[1:04:50] talking about Christ that he is above
[1:04:52] all principality
[1:04:53] and power and might and Dominion in
[1:04:57] every name that is named not only in
[1:05:00] this world but also in that which is to
[1:05:02] come
[1:05:04] and hath put all things under his feet
[1:05:07] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:05:10] things to the church which is his body
[1:05:13] the fullness of him that filth filth all
[1:05:18] in all
[1:05:20] so this great presence
[1:05:23] God's presence fills all space and all
[1:05:27] time is the prophet of God says
[1:05:29] now how we're going to be hiding into
[1:05:32] this great presence that fills all time
[1:05:37] that's where the prophet of God says
[1:05:39] he's so big in the message here him he's
[1:05:42] so big that he fills the old space and
[1:05:44] yet
[1:05:45] will become so small
[1:05:49] that's where he's turning us his
[1:05:51] greatness will become so small that he
[1:05:56] will come to a poor
[1:05:58] Lost Sinner's heart
[1:06:02] that's what makes him great
[1:06:07] so his greatness is not how he can fill
[1:06:10] the space and time
[1:06:13] his greatness is not how he can Thunder
[1:06:17] but his greatness is how he can become
[1:06:19] so low
[1:06:21] and make himself so simple
[1:06:23] and come to the poor through a sinner
[1:06:26] like me and just Redeem Me
[1:06:30] the greatness of God is when he was
[1:06:32] seeing us lost because he was not
[1:06:34] surprised he always had a button for a
[1:06:38] way back
[1:06:40] his Redemption is a button for you and I
[1:06:43] to come back
[1:06:45] Israel was not going to the Homeland
[1:06:47] no they were returning back to the
[1:06:50] Homeland
[1:06:52] because they were in Abraham the promise
[1:06:55] was given so they were in Egypt they
[1:06:59] were not going to the Homeland they were
[1:07:01] in Abraham before they left the land
[1:07:04] they were returning to the Homeland
[1:07:08] and where we're not going into the
[1:07:09] Rapture we're not going to God we're
[1:07:11] returning back to God
[1:07:14] I let that button there of the
[1:07:16] resurrection of of everything returning
[1:07:19] the prophet of God preached the message
[1:07:20] wave way back
[1:07:23] so what we are here it's not something
[1:07:26] new
[1:07:27] we're just wiping our little eyes oh
[1:07:30] where am I like a prodigal son let me
[1:07:34] return back home
[1:07:35] that's all this message has come just to
[1:07:37] give us the isaf let's return back home
[1:07:41] and he is in that greatness in the
[1:07:44] returning back home where
[1:07:46] to his simple word
[1:07:48] I like how the prophet of God said that
[1:07:50] God saved the World by simplicity
[1:07:55] what can be simple than faith
[1:07:58] Faith humanely speaking it's the most
[1:08:02] ridiculous notion ever ever given to man
[1:08:06] that you don't do nothing
[1:08:10] what you have to do just take what I
[1:08:12] give you
[1:08:13] I'm the one giving it to you you don't
[1:08:15] work your way out it's just take it you
[1:08:19] accept it
[1:08:20] nothing you have to do
[1:08:22] and it's so simple and once you accept
[1:08:24] it it hides you somewhere
[1:08:29] it hides you
[1:08:34] the prophet of God says in God hiding
[1:08:36] himself in Simplicity he said when
[1:08:39] Elisha was back in that cave the smoke
[1:08:42] went across blood thunder lightning and
[1:08:46] all these kinds of Sensations we have
[1:08:48] had blood in the face and the hands in
[1:08:50] Sensations and everything they never
[1:08:53] bothered that prophet he just laid there
[1:08:55] but he heard a small still voice
[1:09:03] what was it
[1:09:06] that was the greatness
[1:09:08] if the prophet of God says that was the
[1:09:11] word
[1:09:13] he hide himself in the Simplicity of his
[1:09:16] work
[1:09:17] and he reveals himself in the Simplicity
[1:09:20] of his word
[1:09:21] so when you're finding your way back to
[1:09:24] little word that God has spoken you can
[1:09:27] anchor your soul there because that's a
[1:09:31] hiding place I'm just thinking about a
[1:09:34] little Miriam
[1:09:36] here's Moses born
[1:09:38] in their family and his mom
[1:09:41] hit him for three months in the best
[1:09:45] place ever Dad Mom brother and sister
[1:09:49] but after three months they couldn't
[1:09:51] hide him any longer
[1:09:53] so what did they have to do
[1:09:55] put him on the basket there close to the
[1:09:58] body of water now just with thinking I'm
[1:10:02] just imagining the drama of a Pharaoh's
[1:10:06] daughter coming there because she had no
[1:10:08] child coming there with all the pump
[1:10:09] with all the bodyguards and people
[1:10:12] around her they might have been hundreds
[1:10:14] don't know
[1:10:16] because she was the daughter of a
[1:10:18] pharaoh
[1:10:19] she had had she must have a lot of
[1:10:22] people following her but among all those
[1:10:24] people there here's a seven or eight
[1:10:27] years old that is taking up to speak
[1:10:31] and what she's speaking out is she
[1:10:34] didn't even ask a question she just
[1:10:37] speaking in Pharaoh's daughter
[1:10:40] right away takes that little word of
[1:10:43] that little girl there it becomes thus
[1:10:46] saith the Lord for her
[1:10:49] said can I get to your mother a Hebrew
[1:10:52] mother who can come and nurse that baby
[1:10:54] there was no question who are you
[1:10:57] why are you telling me that no question
[1:11:01] he was just little word that God put
[1:11:05] into that little girl there
[1:11:09] she never hesitated she did exactly with
[1:11:12] those hundreds of bodyguards around her
[1:11:15] she obeyed the word of little girl there
[1:11:20] and they went to get to fetch a mother's
[1:11:23] mom
[1:11:25] Moses's mother
[1:11:29] mother's mother came home to the the
[1:11:32] house of pharaoh
[1:11:34] and now I can imagine Pharaoh himself
[1:11:36] maybe one morning he is putting a decree
[1:11:40] there because he already had his degree
[1:11:42] there to kill all the children of Israel
[1:11:44] and little Moses was growing up there
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] Grandpa was picking up Moses
[1:11:50] little baby how you doing Moses keep
[1:11:52] quiet and he would call his people
[1:11:56] did you make sure that you killed all
[1:11:58] the Hebrew children
[1:12:01] because he must be among those children
[1:12:04] you need to eliminate him I don't want
[1:12:07] to did you do it oh Moses sorry sorry
[1:12:09] could you keep quiet
[1:12:12] the very one he's looking for
[1:12:16] head
[1:12:18] in the open
[1:12:20] hid in the word because when Mother's
[1:12:24] mother was hiding him there was no word
[1:12:27] he was she was hiding him they were
[1:12:31] hiding him with the love of a mother of
[1:12:34] a father of the siblings but there was
[1:12:36] no word so he was still in the open
[1:12:40] but when God put little words into that
[1:12:44] little girl she spoke
[1:12:46] that was the hiding place for Moses
[1:12:50] she was in the pharaoh
[1:12:52] Pharaoh's mentioned being protected by
[1:12:55] the word of his sister
[1:13:00] Moses keep quiet God's coming in how
[1:13:03] many did you kill today
[1:13:05] at Moses sorry what do you want a candy
[1:13:12] that's how God the great God works
[1:13:15] sometimes in a ridiculous way
[1:13:18] sorry to say those words but it seems
[1:13:21] like it and that's the way of Faith his
[1:13:23] hiding place is not in the greatness of
[1:13:26] him
[1:13:31] one word you can be hid there
[1:13:35] when Elisha went to Elijah went to the
[1:13:37] that widow woman
[1:13:39] who had no other just the food
[1:13:43] flour and oil just remaining for one
[1:13:45] cake that would eat and die
[1:13:49] when she just took the word of that
[1:13:52] prophet
[1:13:53] she was secured hid from the famine the
[1:13:57] entire time the feminine lasted in
[1:14:00] Israel
[1:14:02] she just took the word of the prophet
[1:14:05] and that become became her hiding place
[1:14:11] a word of a prophet
[1:14:14] how much more if you would take the word
[1:14:16] of God
[1:14:18] only the word of God it's our hiding
[1:14:22] place in simplicity
[1:14:24] and the prophet of God says remember
[1:14:26] friend don't look for great big you say
[1:14:30] God he speaks of great big things
[1:14:33] there will come a time there will be
[1:14:35] this that or the other great big things
[1:14:37] I hope you're catching what I'm taking
[1:14:39] I'm I'm take talking about great big
[1:14:42] things and oh when this comes to pass it
[1:14:45] will be great big like this and it will
[1:14:48] be so humble you'll miss the whole thing
[1:14:51] and just go right on
[1:14:53] you'll go back and say well that never
[1:14:56] did come see
[1:14:58] pass right over the top and you never
[1:15:00] even seen it
[1:15:02] see it's so simple God lives in
[1:15:07] simplicity
[1:15:10] and as we travel around
[1:15:12] I'm seeing that God I had too many
[1:15:15] things that were still attached to me I
[1:15:18] need to drop that
[1:15:21] you have so the value it's when he opens
[1:15:24] up to you the things the value drop
[1:15:27] right away
[1:15:29] said God lives in Simplicity to manifest
[1:15:33] himself in greatness what makes him
[1:15:36] great
[1:15:37] because he can simplify himself
[1:15:41] and God has looked
[1:15:44] this is he lived by him lived by himself
[1:15:46] he has looked his God the most wise God
[1:15:50] looked for the simplest form he could
[1:15:53] express himself in
[1:15:55] and that's one word
[1:15:59] and that's where his greatness dwells
[1:16:03] his word is our hiding place
[1:16:06] as we trample on it
[1:16:08] we hiding away from him
[1:16:11] we don't like Adam and Eve they thought
[1:16:14] they had a great mind they
[1:16:17] just snipped themselves they walked away
[1:16:20] from the word so they were uncovered our
[1:16:24] hiding place is in his simple word
[1:16:33] in the mystery in the fifth seal the
[1:16:35] prophet of God says
[1:16:37] let me review that just for a minute
[1:16:39] what makes God great so this is just he
[1:16:43] wants to show us I don't know if I want
[1:16:44] to finish this but he's showing the
[1:16:47] greatness of God how is he revealing
[1:16:49] himself in that greatness in that
[1:16:52] greatness is not up high it's just low
[1:16:55] down through the word he's been
[1:16:57] preaching to you every day in this place
[1:17:01] he's giving you every single day at this
[1:17:05] place God has been providing himself so
[1:17:09] you can be heard if you and I who can be
[1:17:12] here in him in his simple word
[1:17:14] said what makes God great is because he
[1:17:18] can make himself so simple
[1:17:21] that one makes him great God is great
[1:17:23] and he can make himself in such a simple
[1:17:27] form that the wise of this world can't
[1:17:30] find him they just can't find him
[1:17:32] because he makes himself too simple now
[1:17:35] watch in this in itself
[1:17:39] this simplicity
[1:17:42] greatness revealed in simplicity
[1:17:45] this in itself is the mystery
[1:17:49] of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] he's hiding himself
[1:17:58] in the word
[1:18:00] and other people cannot see him cannot
[1:18:02] find him because he's in the world the
[1:18:03] rejecting the word but in the same time
[1:18:06] because he is in the word the same word
[1:18:08] he's revealing himself to his bride
[1:18:11] he said I'm I'm head here to others but
[1:18:14] to you I'm revealed
[1:18:19] there can be nothing greater than God
[1:18:21] and you can't make anything as simple as
[1:18:24] he makes himself thou what makes him
[1:18:27] great
[1:18:30] and he said no God is so great he hide
[1:18:32] himself in simplicity
[1:18:34] and then reveals himself in the same
[1:18:36] thing he hide himself in
[1:18:39] how he said we know that David said the
[1:18:42] Lord the the name of the Lord is uh is a
[1:18:46] mighty tower
[1:18:48] the righteous run into it they say and
[1:18:51] and are safe
[1:18:53] oh glad we are to have his this hiding
[1:18:57] place at the end time so the name of the
[1:19:00] Lord becomes the mighty tower
[1:19:03] it's a refuge we can hide ourselves in
[1:19:08] but the Revelation in the Revelation
[1:19:10] tells us what is the the name of the
[1:19:13] Lord
[1:19:14] it's his word revelation 19 13 said and
[1:19:18] he was clothed with a vesture dipped in
[1:19:22] Blood and his name is called the word of
[1:19:25] God
[1:19:26] his greatness is revealed in his
[1:19:30] simplest what is which is his word
[1:19:35] as we take hold of of God's word
[1:19:38] we get we take a hold of his name
[1:19:41] as we take a hold of his name
[1:19:44] we take a hold of the mighty tower
[1:19:48] is also we take a hold of his name
[1:19:52] we're married to him
[1:19:54] when once you take his name
[1:19:57] you're married to him so you are married
[1:19:59] to him and dwelling in his Tower and you
[1:20:02] are HID away from the world
[1:20:04] that's who he is
[1:20:08] there's a scripture here I don't for the
[1:20:10] time sake of the time I don't want to go
[1:20:12] into there
[1:20:13] but just as we we're winding down two
[1:20:16] more minutes I don't want to keep you up
[1:20:19] in the Masterpiece and the prophet uh
[1:20:22] the identified Masterpiece 1964 the
[1:20:25] prophet of God said and when he made his
[1:20:28] first masterpiece
[1:20:30] he put him behind the word
[1:20:33] when he made his second masterpiece
[1:20:37] he was the word
[1:20:40] so his second masterpiece
[1:20:44] is the word and he was the word not
[1:20:48] behind the word but he was the word so
[1:20:52] the Masterpiece we know that it is a
[1:20:55] complete it's complete in the Oneness
[1:20:58] of a male and female
[1:21:02] does the Masterpiece can only have both
[1:21:04] male and female
[1:21:07] and this is the second Masterpiece we're
[1:21:09] talking about Christ and his bride they
[1:21:12] are to be the word
[1:21:15] his bride will be no less than God's
[1:21:19] word itself
[1:21:22] and if his bride is the word
[1:21:24] then we can read
[1:21:27] Isaiah 32 differently
[1:21:31] we can read it
[1:21:33] and a man
[1:21:36] a woman
[1:21:38] a son
[1:21:39] a daughter
[1:21:41] shall be is in a hiding place
[1:21:44] for from the wind
[1:21:46] a cover from The Tempest
[1:21:48] as the rivers of water in the dry place
[1:21:51] is the shadow
[1:21:53] great Rock
[1:21:55] in the weird land
[1:21:58] let us stand I I just don't want to drag
[1:22:01] it but how many would desire more to
[1:22:05] abide in his hiding place
[1:22:09] that tells me that you want to take
[1:22:11] every one of his word you want to live
[1:22:14] in his word in every word that he has
[1:22:17] spoken
[1:22:18] and as you live in it
[1:22:21] you are
[1:22:22] as in Hiding Place yourself
[1:22:25] let's bow our heads again precious Lord

[1:22:33] you have Lord allowed us to witness Your

[1:23:44] our ears have heard

[1:23:49] would say in the Book of Revelation

[1:23:57] because the spirit was to speak
[1:23:59] and those ears can only hear what the
[1:24:02] spirit says and father thank you for

[1:26:06] from our growth in love in humility and
[1:26:10] simplicity encouraging them Father
[1:26:14] we thank you again we love you
[1:26:17] in Jesus Christ and we pray
[1:26:19] amen
[1:26:21] God bless you all
[1:26:23] am I saying something there
[1:26:26] is a brother Shadow would come
[1:26:28] Jesus heals me
[1:26:32] oh Lord don't refuse me for sure
[1:26:38] for she there's a work that I can do
[1:26:46] and even though it's humble
[1:26:51] help my will to crumble
[1:26:56] though the costs be great I'll work for
[1:27:01] you thank you
[1:27:05] and Jesus Jesus Use Me
[1:27:10] Oh Lord don't refuse me
[1:27:16] there's a work that
[1:27:23] any
[1:27:26] tumble
[1:27:29] help my will to crumble
[1:27:33] though
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:42] amen God is so good amen
[1:27:46] oh I loved what he was saying at the end
[1:27:48] that that he is our hiding place and he
[1:27:50] is the word
[1:27:52] but we're hidden the word
[1:27:54] but the word is hidden us
[1:27:56] and if we're hitting the word then the
[1:27:58] word is hidden us then we also become a
[1:28:00] hiding place oh while he was speaking I
[1:28:04] was just thinking of a quote just kept
[1:28:05] coming into my mind and I don't know
[1:28:07] that I have it exactly right so forgive
[1:28:09] me if I don't but it said the word
[1:28:11] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[1:28:14] name of God
[1:28:16] and that name is a strong tower that the
[1:28:18] righteous run into and are saved and the
[1:28:21] manifestation the word interpreted and
[1:28:23] we had the word interpreted in our day
[1:28:25] it's a manifestation of the name of God
[1:28:28] it is a strong tower that we run into
[1:28:30] amen but it's not just the tower we run
[1:28:32] into because the word interpreted is
[1:28:35] interpreting a hiding place for Christ
[1:28:38] in this day and he is hid in the bride
[1:28:42] amen God God be praised is all I can say
[1:28:46] if we only knew how safe we were in that
[1:28:49] word and with that word in Us and how
[1:28:50] secure we were wrapped up in that and
[1:28:53] that word wrapped up in US it makes us
[1:28:55] all one together
[1:28:57] we thank God for that God is so good man
[1:29:01] I so appreciated the report and what God
[1:29:03] is doing
[1:29:04] I hope you were as blessed as I was to
[1:29:06] see how God could take a vision if you
[1:29:09] remember brother Emmanuel spoke a couple
[1:29:10] years ago at watch tonight and he began
[1:29:13] to share just how he was touched by a
[1:29:16] charity work that came to him when he
[1:29:17] was a boy living in the Congo something
[1:29:20] was done for him and he saw and it
[1:29:22] blessed him he said someday I want to do
[1:29:24] something to help my country remember
[1:29:26] that and then God gave him the desire of
[1:29:29] his heart and he started doing just
[1:29:30] simple charity helping out with the poor
[1:29:32] helping with schools helping with stuff
[1:29:34] and by that God began to turn his desire
[1:29:37] and steer him to where he's at today and
[1:29:39] he's doing such a work to help the
[1:29:41] Believers and spread the word it's
[1:29:43] amazing how God can take a desire from a
[1:29:46] boy who was affected by something and
[1:29:48] allow him to have the desire of his
[1:29:49] heart and then steer it and move it to
[1:29:51] where it is today I said God be praised
[1:29:54] don't despise the day of Small
[1:29:56] Beginnings amen because if God be in it
[1:29:59] God will take it wherever he wants
[1:30:01] I'm so thankful for that I'm thankful
[1:30:03] for brother Manuel's willingness to Just
[1:30:05] Surrender
[1:30:06] it's not easy to leave home it's not
[1:30:08] easy to travel like that those aren't
[1:30:10] easy trips to make it's hard on the body
[1:30:12] it's taxing and you know he said he was
[1:30:15] exhausted interpreting I've been there
[1:30:16] I've watched it done it's absolutely
[1:30:19] exhausting the most most tired person of
[1:30:21] all is the translator
[1:30:23] he suffers more than the minister he
[1:30:25] suffers more than anybody else let's say
[1:30:27] God bless you brother amen may God give
[1:30:30] you strength amen
[1:30:31] I've been thinking and meditating for a
[1:30:33] little bit and I've talked to some of
[1:30:35] the brothers on the mission board and
[1:30:36] talked to brother Emmanuel
[1:30:37] but I'd like to make it one of our
[1:30:39] objectives at The Retreat coming up next
[1:30:41] week is to take a collection just for a
[1:30:44] need for another church it was on my
[1:30:46] heart because we've been so blessed and
[1:30:49] we look at if we're just looking at the
[1:30:51] pictures we realize that we're so
[1:30:53] blessed in so many ways if in fact if
[1:30:56] you take every way possible we have that
[1:30:58] blessing blessed in the word blessed
[1:31:01] with the facility blessed with
[1:31:02] Fellowship blessed with brothers and
[1:31:04] sisters blessed we're so blessed and
[1:31:07] even that we can go to a retreat what a
[1:31:10] special privilege that is to go to a
[1:31:12] place like that and spend time like that
[1:31:14] together and so I'd like to use that
[1:31:17] time to do something for another church
[1:31:19] as well
[1:31:20] so I'd like to take one night and we'll
[1:31:23] make it the the Saturday night service
[1:31:25] at the Saturday night service at Retreat
[1:31:27] I'd like to take a collection
[1:31:28] just for another church and you know the
[1:31:31] church where he told the story where the
[1:31:33] woman The Seventh-Day Adventist woman
[1:31:35] had a dream
[1:31:36] brother Emmanuel was telling me about
[1:31:38] that church is that they had some funds
[1:31:41] to build the church but before they
[1:31:44] could even get started so many people
[1:31:45] kept flooding in they had to build the
[1:31:47] church larger than they originally
[1:31:49] planned so they exhausted their funds
[1:31:51] and just putting up the wall and
[1:31:53] couldn't finish the floor or the roof
[1:31:54] because of the influx of people
[1:31:57] I'd like to help him get a roof amen and
[1:32:00] a floor whatever else they could do I
[1:32:01] just I touched my heart I'd like to do
[1:32:04] that so when Brother Kyle and I were
[1:32:06] brother with brother Nester at his last
[1:32:09] anniversary meetings his annual
[1:32:11] anniversary meetings he always makes it
[1:32:12] point to take up a mission collection
[1:32:14] the Third Church of their anniversary
[1:32:16] meetings for another mission work and
[1:32:19] what brother Nestor said touched me so
[1:32:21] much he says nobody give nothing
[1:32:24] everybody give something because it
[1:32:28] becomes a blessing so I think brother
[1:32:30] nesters learned and I've seen him teach
[1:32:31] it I've seen him teach it he's taught it
[1:32:34] in the poorest countries he's taught
[1:32:36] tithing and offering and giving to
[1:32:38] missions with people who had nothing
[1:32:39] because he said I've never seen it fail
[1:32:41] if people give they're blessed
[1:32:44] and so I'd like to say this for
[1:32:46] everybody
[1:32:47] if you're if you're if you're in your
[1:32:49] 80s
[1:32:51] if you're eight years old if you're five
[1:32:55] bring something
[1:32:57] even if you bring a quarter bring
[1:32:59] something and I encourage your children
[1:33:01] don't go to Dad and get something get
[1:33:03] something you've got
[1:33:05] amen give something a quarter a couple
[1:33:08] nickels a bag of Dimes whatever you got
[1:33:11] and you want to give let's all give
[1:33:13] something and see if we can't do
[1:33:14] something to bless another assembly
[1:33:16] somewhere if there's money left over
[1:33:18] that there's always more needs there's
[1:33:20] needs for printing work there's needs
[1:33:22] for those who are traveling brother
[1:33:23] dondon's taking a trip to Cambodia
[1:33:25] there's always needs in mind and now
[1:33:27] there's always needs so we'll take and
[1:33:29] see if we can't meet that need and if we
[1:33:31] do then we'll move it on to another
[1:33:32] church how many like to see that church
[1:33:35] have a roof I'd love to do that I think
[1:33:37] it'd be so rewarding while we're in the
[1:33:39] middle of huge blessings at Retreat to
[1:33:41] do something to bless somebody else not
[1:33:43] just to be a receiver but to be a giver
[1:33:44] too
[1:33:46] amen that would bless me anyway so
[1:33:48] Saturday night and I'll remind you again
[1:33:49] Sunday so don't forget kids bring bring
[1:33:53] something even a quarter and I hope I
[1:33:56] know how this goes the kids will
[1:33:59] probably outdo us so that's old folks
[1:34:01] you better bring more than a quarter
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] amen these kids are generous I've
[1:34:06] watched them in Sunday School
[1:34:07] amen God bless you so good to be here it
[1:34:11] was so good to hear what God is doing
[1:34:13] and see the hunger in people
[1:34:16] I hope we never lose our appetite for
[1:34:18] the word
[1:34:20] I hope we never you know if somebody
[1:34:22] doesn't have an appetite you can hardly
[1:34:24] keep them alive
[1:34:26] you could sit him at a smorgasbord you
[1:34:28] could surround them with good food but
[1:34:29] if there's no appetite there's no
[1:34:30] nourishment I hope God God help us never
[1:34:33] lose our appetite for the word may we
[1:34:36] always be hungry for more we've been fed
[1:34:38] good we've been blessed abundantly but
[1:34:40] let's never lose our Hunger for More I
[1:34:42] need more to gain more strength I need
[1:34:44] more for more nourishment I believe I
[1:34:46] have more to grow in I want to grow amen
[1:34:48] and I need good nourishment from the
[1:34:50] word of God man from our hiding place
