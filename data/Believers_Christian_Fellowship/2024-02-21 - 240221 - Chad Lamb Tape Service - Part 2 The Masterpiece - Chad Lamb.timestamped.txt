[15:08] you all thank you
[15:10] musicians amen I I love the tape service
[15:13] and I'm been looking forward to get into
[15:15] the next part last time we just started
[15:18] getting into the real heart of his
[15:19] message and this time he's going to jump
[15:21] right into it so I'm ready I'm all
[15:23] geared up and ready to take a Jump Right
[15:25] In amen no lead up amen you guys can go
[15:27] ahead and have your seats for just a few
[15:30] moments before we go into the review
[15:33] just for a second I want to remind you
[15:34] that the uh uh Church age Bible study
[15:37] will be here in the fellowship hall uh
[15:40] tomorrow
[15:41] night if we could go ahead and pull up
[15:43] the PowerPoint that would be great also
[15:45] I want to uh take our books and just I
[15:47] want to review just one or two uh little
[15:50] quotes here to keep us fresh of where we
[15:53] where we
[15:54] are in the message before we move on
[15:59] um if you go to page 10 in your book if
[16:01] you open your book and go to page 10 and
[16:03] go down halfway down to paragraph 47 I
[16:07] want to read paragraph 47 and 48 just to
[16:10] catch the and remind ourselves of the
[16:11] theme that brother Ben was talking about
[16:13] now we know the message is the
[16:14] Masterpiece he preached this July 5th of
[16:18] 1964 and so in paragraph 47 he says but
[16:21] finally there came forth upon the earth
[16:23] a Perfection and that was a man and he's
[16:25] speaking of Jesus Christ and then he
[16:28] could see in that man that it looked
[16:30] like him so now when he looked upon him
[16:32] he was the reflection of what his
[16:34] creator was oh no I'm sorry this is Adam
[16:36] I'm sorry he looked upon him he was a
[16:38] reflection of what his creator was and
[16:40] God had now been able to achieve the
[16:42] thing that he wanted a man in his own
[16:43] image and then I might say to this that
[16:46] when he made this man there was
[16:47] something about him yet that didn't look
[16:49] just right because he was by himself and
[16:53] that's how God had been by himself he
[16:55] was the Eternal and the man now in the
[16:57] image of God also existed on Earth by
[16:59] himself so he must have struck a little
[17:02] blow over on his left side and from
[17:03] there he took the piece that struck off
[17:05] of it and made him a help meat a wife
[17:08] then he wasn't by himself he was he had
[17:12] somebody with him and that's his great
[17:14] work amen so let's go over here to
[17:17] paragraph 51 on the next page top of
[17:20] page 11 so we see that that he after he
[17:24] had made his Masterpiece he placed it up
[17:27] up here on the Earth and put it in the
[17:29] most beautiful place there was in the
[17:31] Garden of Eden he placed his Masterpiece
[17:33] the two being one in the Garden of Eden
[17:36] how it must have pleased him that he saw
[17:38] his Masterpiece was well he after that
[17:41] we find out that he rested he was so
[17:43] well pleased with his work now remember
[17:45] that my opinion the Masterpiece is the
[17:47] stroke that marred St Angelo's uh Moses
[17:51] Masterpiece in the monument and it was
[17:53] the stroke that cut the side of his
[17:55] Masterpiece that brought out the bride
[17:57] and now we see him as a masterpiece
[17:59] family in the Garden of Eden how
[18:01] beautiful it was and it so pleased him
[18:04] till he took his rest in he said I'll
[18:07] rest so we see now God was foreshadowing
[18:10] in his first Masterpiece amen The Great
[18:12] Masterpiece that he's finishing in this
[18:14] day amen he showed it in his first son
[18:17] that he made And that son was a
[18:19] masterpiece it was a it was a piece that
[18:22] reflected the artist it reflected God
[18:24] himself and now he had a reflection upon
[18:26] the Earth but he saw that there wasn't
[18:28] something quite right I love that
[18:31] because God's the one who did it he's
[18:34] the one who made it he's the one who
[18:35] fashioned it and when he saw it wasn't
[18:37] quite right it it showed that God never
[18:39] failed in any of his works it wasn't
[18:41] that he made a mistake amen he did this
[18:44] in a way so that we could see he wasn't
[18:46] complete yet he wasn't quite finished he
[18:48] didn't go to his rest cuz he had some
[18:50] more work to do as the great sculptor
[18:52] and so in order to finish his
[18:54] Masterpiece it was a masterpiece yes but
[18:57] not the total vision what he had in his
[18:59] mind so what he did is he struck a
[19:00] little blow and he took from it a rib
[19:02] and he made a second part of the
[19:05] Masterpiece amen from a piece off of the
[19:07] first one amen and then he United the
[19:09] two back together and now they were a
[19:11] masterpiece family now his great work
[19:14] the two being one he placed it in Eden
[19:16] and now he could take his rest because
[19:18] he couldn't rest till he was
[19:20] done so we're all on the same page we
[19:22] see what the Masterpiece was and so then
[19:24] we're going to find out as we begin that
[19:26] the Masterpiece was marred it fell
[19:28] amen but God wasn't going to let it stay
[19:31] that way because he came and left his
[19:33] rest to go back to work to remake the
[19:35] Masterpiece once again and that happens
[19:38] to we happen to be in the final rubbing
[19:42] down of that
[19:45] work amen praise God that's so good so
[19:50] we're going to begin at the bottom of
[19:52] page 11 and we're going to begin at the
[19:53] beginning of paragraph
[19:55] 56 uh this evening and we're going to go
[19:57] all the way to page 25 all the way to
[20:00] the very bottom to the last sentence on
[20:02] page
[20:03] 25 so I'm going to go through our
[20:06] questions for this time also want to let
[20:09] you know that uh I I mentioned before
[20:11] that brother brandom had an interview a
[20:13] private interview just before he came
[20:15] out and preached this message and that
[20:17] was with sister Georgia Bruce and it's
[20:19] the O as far as I know the only recorded
[20:21] private interview that we have and so
[20:24] he's going to refer to that I said last
[20:25] time it would be the last time but it's
[20:26] not it's this time and so when he gets
[20:28] to that and he refers he Saidi had that
[20:30] on a private interview a little bit ago
[20:32] you know which private interview you
[20:33] were with this is one of the few times
[20:35] there's many times brother Brenham
[20:37] mentions the private interviews in his
[20:39] sermon but this is the first time we can
[20:41] go back and hear exactly what he said in
[20:43] the private interview and he was talking
[20:46] to her because she she never had a
[20:48] definite experience of being sealed with
[20:50] the Holy Ghost and she wanted God to
[20:53] speak it to brother bram's heart but he
[20:55] come and told her whatever it was that
[20:58] changed you from your first nature and
[21:01] it changed you to what you are now he
[21:02] said who did that she said Christ he
[21:04] said there you are sister that's it and
[21:07] so when he refers to that it'll be good
[21:09] that that's still in your mind all right
[21:12] let's let's go to our questions so you
[21:14] can jot these
[21:16] down uh question number one why did God
[21:20] change to an unconditional
[21:22] Covenant why did God change to an
[21:24] unconditional Covenant we know that it
[21:26] wasn't originally that way um because
[21:30] his original Covenant
[21:33] was uh the original Covenant was if you
[21:38] if you don't eat of this tree you'll be
[21:41] saved but if you eat of the tree uh that
[21:44] day you'll die so the original Covenant
[21:46] was on condition and it was on condition
[21:48] of obedience so it was a conditional
[21:51] Covenant do we understand that so God
[21:53] changed it to an unconditional Covenant
[21:55] and we want to know why all right
[21:58] next question there's three parts
[22:00] there's an A B and C to this question I
[22:03] don't know if that's cheating I don't
[22:04] know if that's three questions or one
[22:05] question but you'll see they go together
[22:08] what is the foundation of the
[22:10] Masterpiece so there's a foundation it
[22:12] sits on what is the foundation of the
[22:14] Masterpiece that's a Part B what makes
[22:19] up the body of the
[22:21] Masterpiece so what makes up the
[22:26] body and part see what is the head so
[22:30] it's all the Masterpiece what what is
[22:32] the foundation what makes up the body
[22:35] and what is the head of this masterpiece
[22:41] amen question number
[22:44] three what does the what does the Old
[22:47] and New Testament represent now when I
[22:50] when I give you this question if I just
[22:52] gave you this question unrelated to this
[22:54] message there's many things that you
[22:55] could answer there there's not one
[22:57] answer that fits but I'm talking in
[22:59] relation to what brother Bam's going to
[23:00] use how he's going to use it in this
[23:02] message what does the Old and New
[23:03] Testament represent here as he gets to
[23:06] it here in the
[23:07] Masterpiece what does the Old and New
[23:10] Testament
[23:12] represent and then question number
[23:15] four what does the three stages of wheat
[23:19] development
[23:21] produce what does the three stages of
[23:23] wheat development
[23:26] produce
[23:34] all
[23:36] right give you a second get those wrote
[23:52] down all right
[23:55] now as we get started I'd like to read
[23:57] through our scripture again because I
[23:59] don't want us to lose sight of the
[24:00] scripture brother Brenham opened with so
[24:02] if you could take out your Bibles and
[24:04] let's just stand for the reading of the
[24:06] scripture and go to Isaiah 53 because
[24:09] brother Brenham took this as his context
[24:11] for the this message out of Isaiah 53
[24:15] verse
[24:22] 1 Isaiah chap 53 verse
[24:26] 1
[24:28] who hath believed our report and to whom
[24:31] is the arm of the Lord
[24:33] revealed I love how brother Benham
[24:35] answers this in another message who hath
[24:38] believed the report and to whom is the
[24:39] arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the
[24:41] Lord is the Deliverance strength power
[24:43] and authority of God who is the arm of
[24:45] the Lord revealed to those that believe
[24:48] the
[24:48] report praise the Lord so that's you and
[24:51] I we've believed his report who has
[24:54] believed our report to whom is the arm
[24:55] of the Lord revealed for he shall grow
[24:57] up before him as a tender plant and as a
[25:00] root out of dry ground Heath no form nor
[25:03] comeliness and when we see when we shall
[25:05] see him there is no beauty that we
[25:07] should desire him he is despised and
[25:10] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[25:12] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[25:14] were our faces from him he was despised
[25:17] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[25:19] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[25:22] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[25:24] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[25:27] for for our transgressions he was
[25:29] bruised for our iniquities the
[25:31] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[25:33] and with his stripes we are healed all
[25:36] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[25:38] turned everyone to his own way and the
[25:41] Lord ha laid on him the iniquity of us
[25:43] all he was oppressed and he was
[25:46] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he
[25:48] is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[25:50] and as a sheep before the shears is dumb
[25:52] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[25:54] from prison and from judgment and who
[25:56] shall declare his generation for he was
[25:58] cut off out of the land of the living
[26:01] for the transgressions of my people was
[26:03] he stricken and he made his grave with
[26:06] the wicked and with the rich in his
[26:07] death because he had done no violence
[26:09] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[26:12] it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath
[26:14] put him to grief when thou shalt make
[26:17] his soul an offering for sin he shall
[26:19] see his seed he shall prolong his days
[26:21] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[26:22] prosper in his hand he shall see of the
[26:25] travail of his soul and shall be
[26:26] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[26:29] righteous servant justify many for he
[26:31] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[26:33] will I divide a portion him a portion
[26:36] with the great and he shall divide the
[26:38] spoil with the strong because he ha
[26:40] poured out his soul unto death and he
[26:42] was numbered with the transgressors and
[26:44] he bare the sin of many and made
[26:46] intercession for the
[26:48] transgressors praise God we'll let you
[26:50] be seated brother Venom when he reads
[26:53] that we just see what an
[26:55] amazing scripture and description to be
[26:57] begin with the
[26:59] Masterpiece despised rejected Afflicted
[27:04] it's amazing so if you want to take your
[27:06] books now and turn to page 11 down to
[27:09] paragraph 56 we can go ahead and bring
[27:12] up the the message and we'll go ahead
[27:14] and start right
[27:21] there but the great
[27:25] sculpture when he seen the fall of his
[27:30] family the
[27:32] Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to
[27:34] leave it lay there face
[27:38] down and ruined he went to work
[27:41] immediately to build it up
[27:45] again he wasn't willing that it should
[27:48] perish lay there like that all the time
[27:50] because he's God and he will not be
[27:53] defeated so he went to work immediately
[27:56] and began to build
[27:59] again unto his own image a
[28:04] man now we find that the Andel luian
[28:08] world come along and destroyed the whole
[28:12] thing because the covenants that was
[28:14] made was made conditionally if you will
[28:17] not do this or if you will do that God
[28:20] the great sculpture seen that man could
[28:23] not could not keep a covenant he just
[28:27] can't do it there's just no way at all
[28:31] on the interview a few moments ago I was
[28:34] speaking to a person in the room it's
[28:37] present now I said but brother brandom I
[28:40] have so many things that I I know that's
[28:44] wrong in a a Godly little woman I said
[28:47] but but look sister you don't look at
[28:51] yourself it's just what your desire is
[28:54] and what you try to
[28:56] do and if you really love the Lord you
[28:59] try to serve him with all your heart and
[29:02] then all your mistakes is hid in the
[29:04] blood of the Lord
[29:06] Jesus he made a way so he began now
[29:11] taking man from uh his covenants of of
[29:16] saying that if you will I will and he
[29:18] began with the man called Abraham and
[29:22] give to Abraham a covenant
[29:26] unconditionally every time he'd start a
[29:28] masterpiece Satan would get it because
[29:31] the
[29:32] word but when he started with Abraham he
[29:35] said I have already done
[29:38] it now this is
[29:41] unconditionally not what that that if
[29:43] you will I will but I've already done
[29:47] it now he the the sculpture is
[29:51] Determan to have this
[29:54] masterpiece then from Abraham come the
[29:58] Patriarchs and the Patriarchs really now
[30:01] what's God doing he's rebuilding this
[30:05] masterpiece that have
[30:08] fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we
[30:11] find was Abraham now watch every
[30:14] Masterpiece is put on a
[30:18] foundation a
[30:20] sculpture
[30:22] Angelo's uh Monument of Moses on three
[30:25] or 4ot piece of marble it's got a
[30:28] foundation so God in preparing this
[30:32] masterpiece he put it on a foundation of
[30:35] the
[30:37] Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation
[30:40] First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob
[30:44] then Joseph the four
[30:46] corners and now
[30:49] Abraham was the foundation of faith that
[30:53] said had four
[30:55] foundations the foundation of Faith was
[30:58] Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac
[31:02] the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's
[31:06] grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in
[31:10] Joseph was
[31:12] Perfection there's where he could set
[31:14] the
[31:15] monument up all not the First Foundation
[31:18] the second Foundation third Foundation
[31:20] but on the fourth
[31:23] Foundation Abraham portrayed Christ of
[31:26] course
[31:28] so did Isaac in love Abraham did in
[31:31] faith Isaac did in love Jacob did by his
[31:35] grace because Jacob means
[31:38] deceiver and that's what he was but
[31:40] God's grace is with him but when it come
[31:43] to
[31:45] Joseph there's nothing against
[31:48] him just one little
[31:52] scratch for the foundation must also be
[31:55] a masterpiece when he told his father
[31:58] the prophet say to
[32:01] Pharaoh that your people
[32:04] are are cattle raisers they not
[32:07] Shepherds because a Shepherd is an
[32:09] Abomination uh to the Egyptian but when
[32:12] the old prophet got before Pharaoh he
[32:14] said your servants are
[32:17] Hersman so it's scratched it see that's
[32:20] what still makes it the Masterpiece now
[32:22] the foundations is laid through faith
[32:25] love Grace and to Perfection through the
[32:28] Patriarchs now the Bodywork that come on
[32:32] to this Great Masterpiece was the
[32:35] prophets which was the
[32:38] word I hope you can read
[32:42] it the
[32:44] prophets not the
[32:47] laws the prophets for the prophets was
[32:51] the Vindicated word which makes the body
[32:56] not the p
[32:57] Patriarchs the prophets they were the
[33:01] word finally as he started way back in
[33:05] the days of Moses and come down through
[33:08] the prophets to each one and finally
[33:11] building up the body coming closer all
[33:14] the time and the greatest of all of them
[33:17] was John the Bible said so Jesus said it
[33:21] there's not a man ever born of a woman
[33:24] as great as John the Baptist amen for he
[33:27] was the one that could introduce the
[33:33] word and then come finally the great
[33:38] head the head of all of it the rest of
[33:41] the body just spoke of
[33:45] it the foundation was laid by the
[33:48] patriarch but the body was built by the
[33:50] word which was the prophets and here
[33:53] comes the head of all of
[33:55] it Jesus Jesus came on the
[33:59] scene there when this headpiece was put
[34:03] up on it we find in him the entire
[34:06] handiwork of
[34:08] God we find in him the perfect
[34:11] reflection of the word for he was the
[34:15] word the fullness of the
[34:18] word now again God has the perfect
[34:23] Masterpiece
[34:25] again as I is said behold my
[34:29] servant my
[34:32] masterpiece that I have portrayed
[34:34] through all the ages of this perfect one
[34:37] coming in here he stands right before me
[34:41] a perfect there in his own image
[34:45] reflecting
[34:47] God for he said in St John 14 when you
[34:51] see me you see the
[34:55] father and then in the beginning was the
[34:59] word and the Word was with God and the
[35:02] Word was heed
[35:05] out and reflected what the word was at
[35:09] the
[35:11] beginning him the word reflected in the
[35:15] Masterpiece in his own
[35:17] likeness God back again in his own
[35:21] likeness the word form being reflected
[35:25] in the image of a
[35:28] man the
[35:30] Masterpiece all the prophets had
[35:33] flaws all the ones was a potion but here
[35:37] at last coming up through that finally
[35:41] comes the master
[35:43] piece the perfect
[35:47] one no fault in him at all amen so
[35:52] perfect reflected of the Builder himself
[35:57] his own image was reflected in his
[36:00] work God and Christ were one in so much
[36:04] until he put his own Spirit into him and
[36:08] then even the image and the Builder
[36:11] became
[36:13] one God and His sculpture work his
[36:17] Masterpiece where MOS Moses was in the
[36:22] work of St Angelo was a or Michelangelo
[36:25] rather was a
[36:28] uh sculpture work that was dead because
[36:30] it been made out of stone but you're the
[36:33] master
[36:35] builder when he got his
[36:38] handiwork
[36:40] perfected he stepped into it
[36:46] Hallelujah so perfected a redeemer of
[36:51] man so
[36:53] perfect so Godly
[36:57] yet there was no Beauty we should desire
[37:00] him when this virgin born son of the
[37:04] Living
[37:06] God become so perfect and humble and in
[37:09] the image of God until the Great Master
[37:13] who had brought his life up through the
[37:14] prophets and he was the fulfilling of
[37:17] all the prophets he was so perfect until
[37:21] God seeing
[37:24] this he smoked him and cried out
[37:30] speak as Michelangelo did
[37:34] speak you say is that so St Mark 9:7 we
[37:39] find upon on the mount
[37:41] Transfiguration when there stood Moses
[37:45] the law there stood Elijah the prophets
[37:48] all the way back from the Patriarchs the
[37:51] fathers the law the prophets and all of
[37:54] them stand there we hear a voice coming
[37:56] down from the cloud and said this is my
[37:59] beloved
[38:00] Son hear ye him and if they're going to
[38:04] hear he's got to speak just a few days
[38:07] before he was smitten amen this is my
[38:11] son who I'm pleased to dwell
[38:14] in I have molded him I've been 4,000
[38:18] years bringing him to this amen and now
[38:23] he is so perfect I've got to Smite him
[38:25] so he can speak
[38:28] amen hear ye him he's the perfected one
[38:33] he he is the
[38:35] Masterpiece remember he was portrayed
[38:37] all times back through the Old Testament
[38:40] we find him being The Rock in the
[38:42] wilderness that was smitten Rock in the
[38:44] wilderness I am that rock that was in
[38:46] the wilderness but that was a
[38:50] stone it had not come to its Perfection
[38:54] yet but in tight form it it followed the
[38:57] church to draw from it that that he
[39:00] could draw give life to those who he
[39:03] could give life to but he was that rock
[39:06] in the wilderness he had not been made
[39:09] man yet he was only intip Moses saw him
[39:12] standing on this
[39:15] rock he saw him pass by and he said it's
[39:17] the back part of a man you see the
[39:21] sculpture was presenting to
[39:25] Moses which was was a potential image of
[39:29] Christ what the Great Masterpiece would
[39:33] look like when it was perfected he
[39:36] passed his he injected or or projected
[39:40] to Moses the vision of what the
[39:43] Masterpiece was going to look like it
[39:46] was the back part of a man when it
[39:49] passed by in the
[39:51] wilderness remember Angelo could only
[39:54] cry out and smile might the image and
[39:57] say
[39:58] speak but how different it was to God
[40:01] the great sculpture when he made a man
[40:02] in his own image so perfect that
[40:04] reflected him God spoke through the
[40:07] image of
[40:09] man showing what he would do he spoke
[40:12] through the prophets as they were in
[40:14] their potential image as his bringing up
[40:18] to the head but when he come in the head
[40:19] he was all the image of God Amen he was
[40:23] portraying
[40:24] himself then smitten for us now he is
[40:28] the Masterpiece to us the gift of God
[40:33] Jesus Christ eternal life I hope we
[40:36] never forget that as we see the days
[40:39] darkening as we see the Shadows falling
[40:42] when I predicted just a few more turns
[40:45] of the sun this nation's gone do you
[40:48] know
[40:51] yesterday Fourth of
[40:53] July Thomas
[40:55] Jefferson had signed the Declaration of
[40:58] Independence him and the other uh board
[41:01] that was with him and the liberty bell
[41:03] rang and we was declared an independence
[41:05] as a nation according to history there
[41:08] has never been a democracy at any time
[41:10] last over 200 years and that was 1776
[41:15] July the
[41:16] 4th and we're just 11 years
[41:20] left will it make it
[41:24] no can't 11 years and if it does it'll
[41:28] break all
[41:29] history and we see the condition of time
[41:33] we see the condition of the people we
[41:36] see the condition of politics we see the
[41:39] condition of the world it can't
[41:44] stand it's got to sink like the
[41:48] Titanic it must go down for there's give
[41:52] room one nation gives room to another as
[41:56] it falls and this Kingdom Must Fall in
[42:00] every other Kingdom to give room to that
[42:02] Kingdom that's
[42:04] coming which cannot Paul while we
[42:07] receive a kingdom that cannot be moved
[42:09] through this perfect image of God the
[42:14] Masterpiece God when he looked upon him
[42:17] he was so
[42:20] inspired he was so to seem the way he
[42:24] looked and to see the the form of him he
[42:28] was so inspired that it would be the
[42:31] perfect Masterpiece of a
[42:35] redeemer Jesus the
[42:38] Redeemer so God in order to be smitten
[42:42] himself because to pay his own penalty
[42:45] God and Christ became one so God could
[42:49] be smoked in the
[42:52] image he could be scarred and that's why
[42:55] Isaiah said we did esteem him smitten
[42:58] and Afflicted of God yet he was wounded
[43:01] for our transgressions he was bruised
[43:04] for our iniquity the Chas of our pieces
[43:07] upon him and with his stripes we were
[43:08] healed the perfect image of God man God
[43:14] and and Maria had changed from
[43:17] Supernatural to the vision and the
[43:20] vision was projected into the image and
[43:24] the image was smitten so that the
[43:26] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[43:30] death God's perfect
[43:32] Masterpiece he could not do it in
[43:35] Moses he could not do it in the prophets
[43:38] Isaiah who was saw with saws till he was
[43:41] saw to Pieces he could not do it in the
[43:44] prophets that were stoned he could not
[43:46] do it because he couldn't feel it there
[43:49] was just a potion of him but in this
[43:53] perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness
[43:55] of a godhead bodily he can not only
[43:58] project Moses he can project his entire
[44:01] being into this person and taste death
[44:04] for the whole human
[44:05] race God's perfect
[44:09] Masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it
[44:12] he become the Redeemer of all ages to
[44:15] speak for those in the backgrounds who
[44:17] had been before and now all promises was
[44:21] met in him he was the Perfection of the
[44:25] perfection all types is fulfilled in him
[44:29] our kinsman redeemer and Ruth and
[44:32] Boaz our lawgiver from Mount
[44:36] siia our Prophet from the
[44:39] Wilderness as he come from the mountain
[44:42] as he come from the Wilderness as he
[44:44] come from
[44:47] eternity and become
[44:49] man The Perfect Image God down through
[44:53] the age heeing Away by the Patriarchs
[44:55] and madees platform and brought him up
[44:57] from the different things that he laid
[44:58] this Foundation upon upon this he begin
[45:01] to build his word the prophets and then
[45:03] finally come out to the perfect Prophet
[45:06] the perfect
[45:07] Foundation the perfect vision God
[45:13] had now in order for this to speak he is
[45:17] the
[45:18] word and for the word to speak he must
[45:21] come into the image and then for the
[45:24] image to speak is got to be smitten amen
[45:29] Lord he comes into the
[45:32] image and then in order to speak the
[45:35] perfect Redeemer all the types of the
[45:38] Old Testament was met in him as I said
[45:41] the other day Jehovah of the Old
[45:44] Testament is Jesus of the new yes like
[45:48] many of you man women my age we used to
[45:52] have around the country a lot of Chinese
[45:55] laundries
[45:56] when the Chinese first started in they
[45:59] come from the West Coast moving Eastward
[46:02] coming over from the Eastern country
[46:05] moving this way and uh as they did they
[46:08] were people who were not acquainted with
[46:11] our language in our ways but they were
[46:14] fine
[46:16] laundrymen and uh they couldn't write
[46:18] the ticket so you could get your right
[46:20] laundry back but the he got
[46:24] himself a bunch of little
[46:26] cards with nothing on it at
[46:29] all so when you come for your laundry he
[46:33] would take this card and tear it in a
[46:35] certain way and hand you one piece and
[46:39] he kept the other
[46:42] piece and now it's a little better than
[46:45] what we have now because when you come
[46:48] back to claim what was your
[46:52] own those two pieces must Dove tail
[46:56] you couldn't impersonate it if you had
[46:58] to there's no way of do you can make
[47:01] copies of letters but you can't
[47:03] impersonate that
[47:06] tear it's got to fit exactly with the
[47:09] other
[47:11] piece Therefore your dirty clothes that
[47:14] you brought
[47:15] in you could redeem them by this ticket
[47:18] because it match the ticket that was
[47:20] turned
[47:22] in and when
[47:24] God by the prophets that under the law
[47:27] condemned us to
[47:28] sin and the law has no Grace it's only
[47:33] tells you you are a
[47:36] sinner but when Jesus came on the scene
[47:39] he was the
[47:42] Fulfillment he was the the Fulfillment
[47:45] of everything God had promised he was a
[47:48] perfect identical image of the promise
[47:51] amen therefore all Promises of the Old
[47:55] Testament was met in Jesus Christ it
[47:58] couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be
[48:00] met in any of the prophets but it was
[48:02] met in the masterp it matched all that
[48:05] it said it was going to
[48:08] be so will the church have to be a match
[48:12] to everything God has promised amen amen
[48:16] must be that piece is smitten off of
[48:19] it so if the original is the word so
[48:23] will the subjects that's been taken from
[48:25] it be the word
[48:27] word to match its
[48:30] side therefore the chiman you could
[48:33] claim where the law condem you said you
[48:36] were dirty and you were guilty and could
[48:40] put you in the
[48:43] prison but when he came he was the match
[48:46] piece for it that could take you out and
[48:49] bring you back too to be the complete
[48:54] ticket the Redemption that God had
[48:57] promised back in the Garden of Eden thy
[48:59] seed shall bruise the Serpent's head but
[49:01] his uh heel shall bruise uh bruise its
[49:06] head now we find this perfect
[49:10] Masterpiece that God had
[49:13] completed now we notice that he was all
[49:16] that it was promised to be he's all the
[49:19] promises all the prophecies everything
[49:22] that God had made a promise of thy seed
[49:25] shall bruise the Serpent's head now he
[49:28] could not bruise it with the law he
[49:31] could not bruise it with the prophets
[49:33] but he did do
[49:35] it when the woman's seed became the
[49:40] Masterpiece Christ he was a stone that
[49:44] Daniel saw HW out of the mountain he was
[49:47] the one could Smite he's the one that
[49:49] could bruise bruise the Serpent's
[49:53] head his life matched exactly the
[49:57] life of Moses his life matched David
[50:04] let's see if it was if he's the matching
[50:05] piece notice David a rejected King over
[50:10] his own
[50:12] people he was one day while he was his
[50:15] own son rose up in Mutiny against him
[50:18] and he separated and divided the armies
[50:20] of
[50:21] Israel and he was David was drove
[50:26] are driven by his own people from his
[50:31] throne and on he rolled
[50:33] out there was a man who hated
[50:37] him and he's walking along there
[50:40] spitting on
[50:41] David that guard pulled his sword said I
[50:44] let that dog's head stay on him spit on
[50:46] my
[50:47] King David said let him
[50:51] alone God told him to do it don't you
[50:54] see
[50:56] a man of sorrow acquainted with
[50:58] grief he stands like a sheep before
[51:01] shears
[51:04] dumb he said that perhaps David didn't
[51:06] know what he was saying but about 5 600
[51:11] years afterwards or a little
[51:14] more the son of David was going through
[51:16] them same streets amen and he was spit
[51:22] upon but notice what happened when David
[51:24] Al
[51:26] out of his when he became a fugitive and
[51:28] out of his Exile when he when he came
[51:30] back that man begged for peace Mercy
[51:34] even those who smote him will see him
[51:37] one day when he
[51:41] returns and we find out then in Joseph
[51:44] and Joseph was a peculiar born boy the
[51:48] last top part of the
[51:50] foundation where the Masterpiece was to
[51:52] be built upon it come from faith and to
[51:56] love and to Grace it come to
[52:02] Perfection and so did it from the feet
[52:05] of the beginning come forth unto
[52:07] perfection in Christ notice how that he
[52:11] was portrayed in Joseph the top of the
[52:15] foundation the most perfect of all of
[52:18] them we find that Joseph was born to his
[52:23] family and he was by the legal woman
[52:27] actually which was um Jacob's
[52:33] wife and
[52:35] notice also that when he was born his
[52:38] father loved him and his brothers hated
[52:41] him without a cause why did they hate
[52:45] him because he was the
[52:48] word
[52:50] amen see the very
[52:53] Foundation see how the head of the
[52:55] Foundation come look at the head of the
[52:56] body comes I watch the head of the Bride
[53:01] come he was the
[53:04] word and they hated him because he was a
[53:08] sear he fores saw things and told him
[53:10] they happened no matter how long it
[53:12] lered it happened just the same and by
[53:15] being spiritual he was excommunicated
[53:19] from his
[53:20] Brethren they ought to have loved him
[53:23] but they hated him because he was a
[53:26] prophet he was spiritual and they hated
[53:29] him notice he was sold for almost 30
[53:32] pieces of
[53:33] silver thrown it into a ditch and
[53:36] supposedly be dead but was tuck up from
[53:39] the ditch and in his time of Temptation
[53:42] the prison the Butler and the the baker
[53:46] we know that the butler was saved and
[53:48] the baker was lost and in Christ's
[53:51] prison house on the cross one was saved
[53:54] and the other was lost lost two
[53:57] thieves two
[53:59] wrongdoers and we notice he was taken
[54:02] from his prison to the right hand of
[54:07] pharaoh that no man could speak to
[54:10] Pharaoh only through Joseph and when
[54:13] Joseph left that Throne of pharaoh the
[54:15] trumpet sounded throughout Egypt the
[54:18] blast went forth and said bow that he
[54:21] everybody Joseph is coming
[54:24] forth so will it be with
[54:27] Jesus how he was loved of the father and
[54:31] hated of them denominational
[54:33] Breen Without a Cause he was sold for 30
[54:36] pieces of silver as it was and put into
[54:38] the ditch supposedly to be dead on the
[54:41] cross one lost the other and saved and
[54:43] was lifted up from the cross and sits at
[54:46] the right hand of God in the Majesty the
[54:49] great
[54:50] spirit which have been reflected in him
[54:53] and no man can speak to God only through
[54:55] Jesus
[54:57] Christ think of it and when he leaves
[55:00] that Throne starts forth a trumpet will
[55:03] sound and every knee shall bow and every
[55:06] tongue shall confess oh amen remember he
[55:09] was a son of prosperity everything that
[55:12] he did prospered whereever his prisoner
[55:14] wherever it was it come out right and as
[55:18] he promised for his children and make
[55:20] everything work together for the good
[55:23] what it was sickness prison house death
[55:25] Sorrows whatever it was they would work
[55:27] for the good to them that loved him hall
[55:31] hallelujah he promised it it must be so
[55:36] it's got to be there it's figured he
[55:38] spoke to us in him he was that perfect
[55:41] image of God now we see here
[55:46] also that when he comes again remember
[55:50] Joseph by
[55:52] Revelation save the world by his great
[55:56] prophecy the world would have
[55:59] died if it hadn't been for Joseph and
[56:03] the world would would been dead if it
[56:06] hadn't been for Jesus for God so loved
[56:09] the world that he gave his only begotten
[56:11] son that whosoever believeth on him
[56:13] should not perish God is reserving
[56:19] life on and on we could go because he
[56:22] was simply the match of David he was was
[56:25] a match of Moses he was the match of
[56:27] Elijah he was a match of Joseph
[56:30] everything is a pitor for told by in the
[56:34] Old Testament matched right into that
[56:36] what is it showing a perfect Redeemer
[56:40] that we can put old dirty clo to the
[56:42] laundry go claim it again it's been
[56:45] washed in the blood of the Lamb prise
[56:48] the Lord
[56:50] hallelujah we can claim what's our own
[56:54] and everything thing that he died for we
[56:56] can claim
[56:58] it so he was a perfect word portrayed it
[57:03] pleased God the great sculpture to Smite
[57:06] him and to do it this way we see him in
[57:10] Isaiah here is read we all did a Ste him
[57:14] we turned our face from him there's no
[57:16] beauty that we should desire him
[57:18] everybody talking about make fun of him
[57:20] I'm talking about him now in this day
[57:22] everybody making fun of him see
[57:25] we did esteem him we saw him esteem
[57:28] means to look at we did Este him smitten
[57:31] Afflicted of
[57:33] God yet he what did he do this far he
[57:36] was wounded for our
[57:38] transgressions amen he was bruised for
[57:40] our
[57:41] iniquity now we could go on and on with
[57:45] that but I believe you have the picture
[57:46] of what I mean now God building back his
[57:50] Masterpiece but let us not
[57:53] forget that in the beginning when he
[57:56] smoke the side of Adam he took something
[57:58] from his
[58:02] side now the smiting of Christ was for a
[58:07] cause that he might take from
[58:10] him one to be a family the
[58:14] bride you might take him a bride so when
[58:18] his Masterpiece was
[58:21] perfected then he had to Smite it
[58:26] to take from him not another piece not
[58:30] another
[58:31] creation but all the same
[58:36] creation my brother don't think bad of
[58:39] this but think a minute if he took from
[58:42] him the original creation to make the
[58:46] bride for
[58:48] him he never made another creation he
[58:52] took a part of the original
[58:56] creation then if he was the word what
[59:00] must the bride
[59:03] be it's got to be the original word
[59:08] Living God in the
[59:13] word Kimberly South Africa once I was
[59:17] looking at diamonds how they was brought
[59:19] up out of the ground and I seen him
[59:21] laying there as well the the
[59:24] superintendent of the plant or the mine
[59:27] was one of my ushers in the prayer line
[59:29] and uh I noticed the diamonds valued of
[59:32] tens of thousands of dollars piled
[59:34] together but they didn't Sparkle even
[59:36] under the light and I said to the
[59:39] superintendent of the minds I said why
[59:41] don't they sparkle he said sir they
[59:43] haven't been cut
[59:45] yet they must be cut then when they are
[59:49] cut then they reflect the
[59:51] light there you are
[59:55] the Masterpiece must be cut
[59:59] notice cut for what is the piece cut off
[1:00:02] no no the piece is cut off is made of
[1:00:05] vrola needle and the vcta needle is put
[1:00:08] upon a a a record that's unseen music to
[1:00:14] the world but the needle is what brings
[1:00:16] it
[1:00:17] out brings out the true interpretation
[1:00:20] of the
[1:00:22] word his life met to all the peoples it
[1:00:26] pleased God to Smite him and now why did
[1:00:29] he Smite him for the same cause he had
[1:00:32] to Smite Adam now we see him stricken
[1:00:36] smitten of God and
[1:00:39] Afflicted the perfect lamb for SL siners
[1:00:43] slain a perfect Masterpiece now for
[1:00:46] nearly 2,000 years God has been again
[1:00:51] making him a
[1:00:53] masterpiece because he struck at
[1:00:56] him to get a a piece off of him part of
[1:01:00] him a rib to make a wife for him and now
[1:01:04] that perfect Masterpiece that he struck
[1:01:07] at
[1:01:08] Calvary he got a piece off of
[1:01:12] him it's just the New Testament that's
[1:01:14] all he fulfilled the Old Testament now
[1:01:17] it's the New Testament another piece to
[1:01:18] be fulfilled see the new and old is
[1:01:21] husband and
[1:01:23] wife
[1:01:25] and it taking the new to for the old to
[1:01:28] fores show the new Christ come the
[1:01:29] Masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[1:01:31] bribe will fulfill everything that's in
[1:01:33] the New Testament another masterpieces
[1:01:36] in making as it taken him 4,000 years to
[1:01:40] make this
[1:01:42] masterpiece now he's been for nearly
[1:01:44] 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a
[1:01:48] bride far Christ another
[1:01:51] Masterpiece and so doing it he he does
[1:01:54] it by his never changing method the same
[1:01:57] way he made the
[1:01:59] Masterpiece amen his
[1:02:02] word that's the way he makes his
[1:02:05] masterpieces because he can only be a
[1:02:07] perfect Masterpiece when it's a perfect
[1:02:10] word any dirt trash injections it'll
[1:02:13] break but the heavens and earth will
[1:02:16] pass away but that word will never
[1:02:19] break remember cutting a diamond you
[1:02:21] have to have a perfect tool to do it
[1:02:23] with not just any piece will do it I've
[1:02:26] seen tons of them big Grinders crash
[1:02:29] right through it and move them big tons
[1:02:31] over pass that diamond right on through
[1:02:33] no you don't break the diamond has to be
[1:02:36] cut now he's doing the same thing and
[1:02:40] his never changing method we find out
[1:02:42] Mali 3 he said I'm God and I change not
[1:02:45] he cannot change his
[1:02:47] method now as he started in Abraham
[1:02:51] after the follow of the first
[1:02:53] Masterpiece he started in Abraham on the
[1:02:55] foundation to build another Masterpiece
[1:02:58] he started on the day of
[1:03:01] Pentecost to build another Masterpiece
[1:03:04] The Original Seed
[1:03:07] word start in the first church what was
[1:03:10] it the seed word the word manifested the
[1:03:15] promise that had been given Joel said it
[1:03:18] shall come to pass the night day sayith
[1:03:20] God I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:03:21] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:03:23] prophesy your old old man shall dream
[1:03:25] dreams your young man shall see Visions
[1:03:27] what he would do in the last days two
[1:03:29] last 2,000 years
[1:03:31] notice and it started out as the
[1:03:35] original as Jesus said the word of God
[1:03:38] is a seed that is sore
[1:03:40] sold and he was the
[1:03:43] soar the seed was the
[1:03:45] word and notice any seed that abides
[1:03:49] alone never does nothing it's got to
[1:03:51] fall into the ground to bring forth its
[1:03:55] production again and this seed that
[1:03:59] perfect Church fell to the ground at
[1:04:04] nasia Rome when she become a
[1:04:08] denomination now
[1:04:10] historians
[1:04:12] remember and you going to hear this tape
[1:04:15] check it up and find out that's not
[1:04:16] right the church died at n seea Rome
[1:04:21] when she took dogmas and creeds instead
[1:04:24] of the original word what was it God had
[1:04:28] showed by that first church that he was
[1:04:33] God
[1:04:35] Amen he had a church
[1:04:39] perfected but the church like all other
[1:04:42] seeds must fall into the ground and
[1:04:45] die now it fell into the ground and die
[1:04:49] and wasted away you know I read a book
[1:04:51] here not long ago someone wrote a a book
[1:04:53] and said the silent
[1:04:56] God you might have read it I forget I I
[1:04:59] think brck no I don't I'm not sure who
[1:05:01] it was wrot it but I can't remember I
[1:05:04] got it in my study the silent
[1:05:07] God said God to Thousand Years of Dark
[1:05:12] Ages set still and never moved a
[1:05:17] hand and watch faithful Martyrs go to
[1:05:21] the Lion's pit and be burn
[1:05:25] by the
[1:05:26] Romans assassination of all
[1:05:29] kinds women stripped of their
[1:05:32] clothes Set Fire to the long hair with
[1:05:35] tar and burn him remember short hair
[1:05:38] first began in
[1:05:40] Rome and the women of Christians had
[1:05:42] long hair so they they dipped it in tar
[1:05:45] and set them a fire and burned them and
[1:05:47] then
[1:05:49] naked V him to the
[1:05:52] lines and this right goes to say where
[1:05:55] is that God oh the blindness of man
[1:06:00] sometimes do you not know that that seed
[1:06:04] had to
[1:06:06] die he never tried to deliver
[1:06:09] lamb they went down in
[1:06:12] Victory they went down bleeding and
[1:06:14] dying giving their lives why it was a
[1:06:16] seed that had to fall into the ground
[1:06:19] first John 12 tells us the corn of
[1:06:22] wheat it's got the fall into the ground
[1:06:25] and there die not only die but
[1:06:28] rot but little did that denomination
[1:06:31] know that that lifee was still in there
[1:06:33] oh the church in itself that n i see a
[1:06:36] council of 15 days of bloody politician
[1:06:40] debate when them Aristocrats come in and
[1:06:43] want to inject these big dignitaries
[1:06:46] into the church and Prophets come out of
[1:06:48] that Wilderness there eating herbs and
[1:06:51] wrapped in animal skins Janu and
[1:06:55] Prophets and they throw them
[1:06:58] out why the seeds got to fall into the
[1:07:02] ground it's got to die it died in the
[1:07:06] Dark Ages down beneath the dark
[1:07:10] dirt they thought it was
[1:07:13] gone you know St John 12:24 Jesus said
[1:07:17] except the corn of wheat falls into the
[1:07:19] ground it abides alone and the first
[1:07:23] church was that reproduction that
[1:07:27] bride that seed that word made
[1:07:30] manifest that fell into the ground and
[1:07:33] now I see a
[1:07:34] Rome listen Church throughout the
[1:07:37] Nations that'll hear
[1:07:39] this there is your dirt as them
[1:07:45] denominations there's where the
[1:07:48] word was
[1:07:51] crucified and they accepted
[1:07:55] dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:07:59] years of Dark Ages the power and
[1:08:02] manifestation of the word was hid from
[1:08:05] the world only Catholicism
[1:08:10] ruled we all know that as reading
[1:08:13] history only Catholicism
[1:08:16] rule but you you can't hide a gerti
[1:08:22] seed it's got the to come
[1:08:24] forth because why the great sculpture is
[1:08:29] on the
[1:08:31] jobah go to build
[1:08:33] again so he the seed went down the
[1:08:38] word why we see St Paul Peter James John
[1:08:45] all those who wrote the word in the road
[1:08:47] they were they wrot become alive and
[1:08:52] lived and it live lived and when we find
[1:08:56] after it be to get
[1:08:59] ripe John began to write in Epistles he
[1:09:01] was St on the aisle of patmas after
[1:09:03] being burnt in a for 24
[1:09:05] hours but the word must come forth has
[1:09:09] got to be wrote they couldn't borrow the
[1:09:12] holy ghost out of him with all so he
[1:09:15] come forth his work wasn't finished he
[1:09:17] died in not natural death
[1:09:20] polycarp which was a disciple of John
[1:09:23] carried the word
[1:09:26] on and from pcarp came irenius and
[1:09:30] irenius the great uh man of God who
[1:09:34] believe the very same gospel that we
[1:09:36] believe the word is right the church
[1:09:39] trying to squeeze it out finally come to
[1:09:42] Nar Rome and there she fell into the
[1:09:45] ground after St Martin and was
[1:09:49] murdered St Martin beli the same thing
[1:09:51] we believe he stood the same thing the
[1:09:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism
[1:09:56] and water in Jesus name he stood in the
[1:09:58] very same thing that we do and he was a
[1:10:01] prophet amen Believe the full word of
[1:10:04] God and finally they were crucified and
[1:10:06] mashed into the ground and laid there
[1:10:09] for hundreds of years and till it rotted
[1:10:14] the outside seed the old bodies just
[1:10:16] rotted away I've been in San Angelo in
[1:10:19] the catacombs and see where they died
[1:10:20] and there broken bones and everything
[1:10:22] they finally Ro until their bones were
[1:10:25] gone but the life was still
[1:10:28] there the corn of wheat that fell into
[1:10:30] the ground on at the Nia Council begin
[1:10:33] to sprout again in Martin
[1:10:35] Luther like any corn coming up or wheat
[1:10:38] at the seed's Rock the life Springs
[1:10:42] forth and it begin to bring forth in
[1:10:45] Martin Luther what did he do the first
[1:10:46] thing reject the denomination of
[1:10:49] Catholicism right protested that it was
[1:10:53] wrong
[1:10:54] where he said the just shall live by
[1:10:57] faith what was it a little weak life it
[1:11:00] put up a couple little shoots that was a
[1:11:02] Luther's it sure don't look like the
[1:11:04] green that went in the ground but the
[1:11:06] life is coming out
[1:11:07] now then it went on to a
[1:11:10] stock then what happened in the days of
[1:11:14] John Wesley what did he do when he
[1:11:16] brought out
[1:11:17] sanctification he stayed with the word
[1:11:20] and what did he do the Lutheran had
[1:11:22] organized
[1:11:24] and made an organization so it was time
[1:11:27] for something to happen amen the
[1:11:30] Masterpiece is being built now what did
[1:11:33] he do what did he do he protested that
[1:11:37] angle in
[1:11:38] church came out in the Reformation as a
[1:11:44] tossel what is it the seeds coming to
[1:11:46] life growing now now the stock doesn't
[1:11:49] look like the seed neither does the
[1:11:52] tossle now Pentecostal Brethren
[1:11:56] throughout the Nations I want you to
[1:11:58] listen my brother if this is the last
[1:12:00] message I'll ever
[1:12:02] preach this is my
[1:12:06] masterpiece do you notice when the
[1:12:08] Wheats the corn of wheat that falls into
[1:12:11] the ground when it begins to farm back
[1:12:13] to its its grain
[1:12:17] again what's
[1:12:19] nature nature exactly is God God working
[1:12:23] in nature it's all it can but from the
[1:12:26] Pentecostal Revival as they think was
[1:12:29] the seed it wasn't now watch but
[1:12:32] something come forth just like the
[1:12:34] seed watch what Jesus said in St Matthew
[1:12:38] 24:24 that the two Spirits at the last
[1:12:42] days would be so close together it would
[1:12:44] deceive the elected if
[1:12:47] possible now that stalk don't look
[1:12:50] nothing like a seed neither does a
[1:12:52] tossel look like a seed
[1:12:54] but notice now not in Luther's day but
[1:12:57] in the last
[1:12:59] day the first thing there's wheat
[1:13:02] Farmers studing here the first thing
[1:13:04] that comes forth on a wheat
[1:13:06] seed you would almost think it was a
[1:13:09] seed but what is it it's the
[1:13:14] husk it forms a little outside thing
[1:13:19] like to hold the
[1:13:21] seed it forms a husk
[1:13:24] but the husk is not the seed no more
[1:13:26] than the tosser of the stalk
[1:13:30] was it's only a carrier of the
[1:13:34] life the corn of wheat then of St John
[1:13:37] 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat
[1:13:42] after the tossel after uh Wesley puts
[1:13:47] forth the
[1:13:48] husk which is the foremost like the
[1:13:52] grain of anything
[1:13:55] else the husk is more like the green
[1:13:57] it's coming more like the green all the
[1:13:59] time the one that went in the
[1:14:01] ground and when it comes forth the stock
[1:14:04] it's got life in it but it sure isn't
[1:14:06] the green comes forth the tossel the
[1:14:09] pollen it still isn't the green and then
[1:14:13] it comes forth the husk and it's just in
[1:14:16] the shape of the
[1:14:19] wheat just exactly like the grain of
[1:14:22] wheat but yet it isn't the
[1:14:26] wheat just exactly in the same
[1:14:29] shape perfectly the Pentecost has come
[1:14:32] out just like the wheat would each one
[1:14:35] comes out from the other coming out from
[1:14:37] the other but they're only a carrier
[1:14:40] they go to denomination and that's what
[1:14:43] Pentecost did went to the
[1:14:45] denomination and what did Pentecost will
[1:14:47] do when it come out just like the grain
[1:14:50] it went right back like in Revelation 17
[1:14:52] to1 one of the sister
[1:14:56] denominations that's exactly what that's
[1:14:58] what Jesus said now what the gospel is
[1:15:00] going to come out through Luther through
[1:15:01] Wesley into the Pentecost and at the
[1:15:02] last days they'll see the very
[1:15:05] elected if it's
[1:15:08] possible the
[1:15:10] elected oh Pentecostal Brethren can't
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:17] see the wheat in its first beginning is
[1:15:19] just like the seed when it begins to
[1:15:22] form like the seed but it's a husk it
[1:15:24] denominated exactly done the same thing
[1:15:27] that did down here in
[1:15:30] Luther Revelation 17 it proves the same
[1:15:33] thing other churches now the Green Seed
[1:15:37] in the original fell at Nia for it was
[1:15:41] the first
[1:15:44] denomination notice here the life that
[1:15:48] was in the stalk tossled all now ends up
[1:15:52] in the the
[1:15:54] seed the life that come out of the
[1:15:56] original seed come up through different
[1:16:00] processes three different processes and
[1:16:03] then turns back till its original
[1:16:09] condition
[1:16:11] hallelujah oh my the happiest person in
[1:16:15] the world that God is let me see
[1:16:19] this watch how perfect the word and
[1:16:22] these works together just like we Pro
[1:16:26] the resurrection rise the sun setting
[1:16:27] and the sun rising again the leaf going
[1:16:29] out of the tree down in the sap into the
[1:16:31] root and comes back up and and the leaf
[1:16:33] comes back up with it again it falls on
[1:16:35] the ground the life of the tree sucks it
[1:16:37] right back to calcium and poish and
[1:16:38] brings right up to another Leaf again
[1:16:40] see all nature everything works right
[1:16:42] with with the word of God and here it is
[1:16:45] exactly perfectly in these Church ages
[1:16:47] that's the reason the Holy Ghost came
[1:16:49] down and draw those things and made them
[1:16:50] out farest way he has amen it's exactly
[1:16:54] no is share the life that was in the
[1:16:56] husk in the stalk and in the tossel in
[1:17:00] the husk all gathers in the seat and the
[1:17:04] life that was in the stalk went one went
[1:17:07] to make the
[1:17:09] other justification made a way for
[1:17:13] sanctification sanctification made a way
[1:17:16] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:17:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:17:21] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:17:23] in Perfection back to the word again to
[1:17:25] manifest
[1:17:30] itself
[1:17:32] amen that was good I so enjoy you know
[1:17:36] we all listen to the messages we all
[1:17:39] spend time in the word but it's really
[1:17:41] special to listen together I love to
[1:17:43] hear your amens amen amen it makes the
[1:17:47] amen pop out of me more and more so I
[1:17:50] get excited let's go go if we can pull
[1:17:53] up our questions all right first
[1:17:55] question why did God change why did God
[1:17:59] change to an unconditional Covenant
[1:18:01] let's go to paragraph
[1:18:04] 57 at the top of page
[1:18:09] 12 says now we find that the anti anti
[1:18:14] deluvian world came along and destroyed
[1:18:16] the whole thing because the Covenant
[1:18:17] that was made was made conditionally if
[1:18:20] you will not do this or if you will do
[1:18:22] that God the great sculptor seeing that
[1:18:24] man could not could not keep a covenant
[1:18:27] he just can't do it there's just no way
[1:18:30] at all how many can say amen that's what
[1:18:33] Paul said amen Paul said though I would
[1:18:35] do good evil is present with me why
[1:18:37] because man was sold into sin in the
[1:18:39] garden and he come into a hybrid
[1:18:41] condition and now man cannot keep the
[1:18:44] word perfectly in and of himself so he
[1:18:47] could not keep a covenant on the
[1:18:49] interview a few moments ago this is
[1:18:50] where he speaks about sister Bruce I
[1:18:52] speak speaking to a person in the room
[1:18:54] that's present now said but brother bham
[1:18:56] I have so many things that I know that's
[1:18:57] wrong and a Godly little woman I said
[1:19:00] but look sister you don't look at
[1:19:02] yourself it's just what your desire is
[1:19:04] and what you try to do if you really
[1:19:06] love the Lord you try to serve him with
[1:19:08] all your heart then all your mistakes is
[1:19:10] hid in the blood of Jesus see he made a
[1:19:13] way so he began now taking man from his
[1:19:17] covenants of saying that if you will I
[1:19:18] will and he began with the man called
[1:19:20] Abraham and give to Abraham a covenant
[1:19:22] and unconditionally every time he would
[1:19:25] start a masterpiece Satan would get it
[1:19:27] because the word but when he started
[1:19:29] with Abraham he said I have already done
[1:19:31] it now this is
[1:19:33] unconditionally now that if you will not
[1:19:36] that if you will I will but I've already
[1:19:38] done it now he the sculptor is
[1:19:41] determined to have his
[1:19:43] Masterpiece why is he doing this because
[1:19:46] he's determined to have the Masterpiece
[1:19:48] because it was the image he had in his
[1:19:50] mind and the desire he wanted to express
[1:19:52] of himself and he's not going to let
[1:19:54] anything even our hybrid condition stop
[1:19:57] that
[1:19:58] plan so he had to come with an
[1:20:01] unconditional Covenant so he wouldn't
[1:20:03] say CU if he would have said if you'll
[1:20:04] do this I'll do that then God could have
[1:20:07] never fulfilled his masterp because man
[1:20:09] can't keep the word of God Only God
[1:20:12] himself can keep his word
[1:20:16] amen uh paragraph 16 now then from
[1:20:19] Abraham came the
[1:20:21] Patriarchs now what's God doing he's
[1:20:24] rebuilding this masterpiece that had
[1:20:27] fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we
[1:20:29] find was Abraham let's go to paragraph
[1:20:32] 118 from here let's jump over to page
[1:20:36] 23 page 23 paragraph
[1:20:41] 118 it says but you can't hide a
[1:20:44] germatize seed it's got to come forth
[1:20:47] because why the great the great sculptor
[1:20:49] is on the job he's going to build again
[1:20:52] why but we go back over here to
[1:20:54] paragraph 59 on page 12 at the bottom
[1:20:58] said but I've already done it he the
[1:21:00] sculpter is determined to have his
[1:21:02] Masterpiece so that's what he did he put
[1:21:05] the life in the seed and he planted the
[1:21:07] seed because he knows that that life
[1:21:09] will come forth why cuz it's got life in
[1:21:11] it why cuz he's determined to have his
[1:21:14] Masterpiece I'm so thankful that God's
[1:21:17] determined aren't you thankful he wasn't
[1:21:19] leaving it based on our determination
[1:21:21] because we were set up to fail by the
[1:21:23] fall and none of us could do it amen
[1:21:26] Jesus Christ was the only one without a
[1:21:29] scratch praise God all right let's look
[1:21:32] at our second question what is the
[1:21:33] foundation of the Masterpiece let's go
[1:21:35] to paragraph 61 here on page
[1:21:39] 12 now watch every Masterpiece is put on
[1:21:41] a foundation a sculpture Angelo's
[1:21:44] Monument of Moses is on a three or 4ft
[1:21:46] piece of marble it's got a foundation so
[1:21:48] God in preparing this masterpiece he put
[1:21:50] it on a foundation of the Patriarchs and
[1:21:52] the patriarch Foundation First was
[1:21:54] Abraham then Isaac then Jacob then
[1:21:56] Joseph the four corners and now Abraham
[1:21:59] was the foundation of Faith let's say he
[1:22:01] had four foundations the foundation of
[1:22:03] Faith was Abraham the foundation of love
[1:22:05] was Isaac the foundation of Grace was
[1:22:07] Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows
[1:22:09] that but in Joseph was Perfection there
[1:22:12] is where he could set the there is where
[1:22:14] he could set the monument upon not the
[1:22:16] First Foundation the second Foundation
[1:22:18] the third Foundation but on the fourth
[1:22:21] Foundation praise God I I want you to
[1:22:23] hold that in your mind he had to set it
[1:22:25] on the fourth Foundation let's go to uh
[1:22:28] read this next paragraph Abraham
[1:22:30] portrayed Christ of course so did Isaac
[1:22:31] in love Abraham did in faith Isaac did
[1:22:34] in love Jacob did by his grace because
[1:22:36] Jacob means deceiver and that's what he
[1:22:39] was but God's grace was with him but
[1:22:41] then it came to Joseph there was nothing
[1:22:43] against him just one little scratch for
[1:22:45] the foundation must also be a
[1:22:48] masterpiece so I thought that was
[1:22:50] amazing that he couldn't set it on the
[1:22:52] first or the second or the third but
[1:22:54] he's going to set it on the fourth
[1:22:55] Foundation which was Perfection but when
[1:22:58] it comes to Joseph he tipes Perfection
[1:23:00] and he had no flaw except one little
[1:23:02] scratch for the for the foundation must
[1:23:05] also reflect the Masterpiece he needed
[1:23:07] that scratch and he needed it for more
[1:23:09] than one reason because he had to
[1:23:10] reflect the Masterpiece but also he
[1:23:13] couldn't have a perfect man yet because
[1:23:15] only Jesus Christ could be the perfect
[1:23:16] man so he had to have that little
[1:23:19] scratch amen but yet he typed perfection
[1:23:24] praise
[1:23:25] God let's look now at our next question
[1:23:28] question what makes up uh the body of
[1:23:31] the Masterpiece so what is the
[1:23:32] foundation the Patriarchs what is the
[1:23:35] body let's look at paragraph
[1:23:37] 66 now the bodyw work that come onto
[1:23:40] this Great Masterpiece was the prophets
[1:23:42] which was the word I hope you can read
[1:23:44] it see the prophets not the laws the
[1:23:46] prophets for the prophets was the
[1:23:48] Vindicated Words which makes the body
[1:23:50] not the Patriarchs the prophets they
[1:23:52] they were the word finally as he started
[1:23:55] way back in the days of Moses and come
[1:23:57] down through the prophets to each one
[1:23:59] and finally building up the body coming
[1:24:01] closer all the time and the greatest of
[1:24:03] all of them was John the Bible said so
[1:24:05] Jesus said it there's not a man ever
[1:24:07] born of a woman as great as John the
[1:24:09] Baptist for he was the one that could
[1:24:11] introduce the word what was he
[1:24:13] foreshadowing he was
[1:24:15] foreshadowing the Elijah of our day amen
[1:24:19] the greatest of the church age
[1:24:20] Messengers John was the greatest prophet
[1:24:22] of all why cuz he was going to introduce
[1:24:24] the word brother Brandon was the
[1:24:25] greatest of the church age Messengers
[1:24:27] why because the same exact reason that
[1:24:29] John was the greatest of the prophets
[1:24:32] because he was going to introduce the
[1:24:34] word praise
[1:24:37] God so the prophets made up the body I
[1:24:40] think it's interesting that he said the
[1:24:42] prophets made up the body because we
[1:24:44] know this is an image of the word he
[1:24:45] said not the laws but the prophets he
[1:24:47] said because the prophets were the
[1:24:48] Vindicated word they were the Living
[1:24:50] Word they were they were betraying a
[1:24:53] great prophet that was coming they were
[1:24:54] fleshing out the word not just what was
[1:24:57] written down but what was living showing
[1:24:58] this is the body of the image it's the
[1:25:01] Living Word the word living in flesh
[1:25:05] that made up the body now what makes up
[1:25:07] the head paragraph 68 and then came
[1:25:10] finally the great head the head of it
[1:25:12] all the rest of the body just spoke of
[1:25:14] it the foundation was laid by the
[1:25:16] patriarch but the body was built by the
[1:25:18] word which was the prophets and here
[1:25:20] comes the head of it of all of it Jesus
[1:25:23] come on the scene there when his
[1:25:25] headpiece was put upon it we find in him
[1:25:27] the entire handiwork of God we find in
[1:25:29] him the perfect reflection of the word
[1:25:32] for he was the word the fullness of the
[1:25:33] word now again God has the perfect
[1:25:37] Masterpiece and is as as Isaiah said
[1:25:40] behold my servant my masterpiece and I
[1:25:43] portrayed through all the ages of this
[1:25:44] perfect one coming and here he stands
[1:25:46] right before me a per a perfect there in
[1:25:49] his own image reflecting God for he said
[1:25:51] in John 14 when you see me you see the
[1:25:54] father and then in the beginning was the
[1:25:57] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:25:58] Word was hewed out and reflected what
[1:26:00] the word was at the beginning him the
[1:26:02] word reflected in the Masterpiece in his
[1:26:05] own likeness God back again in his own
[1:26:07] likeness the word form being reflected
[1:26:10] in the image of man the
[1:26:13] Masterpiece so you could call this the
[1:26:17] capping of the monument the head coming
[1:26:20] down the capping off the full word in
[1:26:23] Perfection to cap off the Masterpiece
[1:26:25] and to complete the Masterpiece let's go
[1:26:27] to paragraph 70 on page
[1:26:30] 14 all the prophets had flaws all the
[1:26:33] ones was a portion but here at the last
[1:26:36] coming up through that finally comes the
[1:26:37] Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in
[1:26:40] him at all so perfect reflected of the
[1:26:43] Builder himself his own image was
[1:26:45] reflected in his work God and Christ
[1:26:48] were one in so much until he put his own
[1:26:51] Spirit into him and then even the image
[1:26:53] and the Builder became one God and His
[1:26:55] sculpture work his Masterpiece there
[1:26:58] where Moses was in the work of St Angelo
[1:27:01] or Michelangelo rather was a sculpture
[1:27:03] work that was dead because it had been
[1:27:04] made of made of stone but here the
[1:27:07] master builder when he got his handiwork
[1:27:09] perfected he stepped into it oh I love
[1:27:13] that let's go to paragraph 78 at the
[1:27:15] bottom of the next
[1:27:17] page God when he looked upon him he was
[1:27:19] so inspired to see him the way he looked
[1:27:22] to see the form of him he was so
[1:27:24] inspired that it would be the perfect
[1:27:26] Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the
[1:27:28] Redeemer so God in order to be smitten
[1:27:30] himself because to pay his own penalty
[1:27:33] God and Christ became one so God could
[1:27:36] be smoked in the image he could be
[1:27:39] scarred praise God that and that's what
[1:27:41] Isaiah said we did esteem him is smitten
[1:27:44] and Afflicted God yet he was wounded for
[1:27:47] our transgressions he was bruised for
[1:27:49] our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:27:51] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:27:53] we were healed praise God that was the
[1:27:57] headship coming to this body the
[1:27:59] completion of the Masterpiece and God
[1:28:02] stepped into it so that he could be
[1:28:05] smitten for us it's
[1:28:08] beautiful next question what does the
[1:28:12] Old and New Testament represent let's go
[1:28:15] over to um paragraph 85 on page
[1:28:21] 17
[1:28:22] and when God by the prophets and under
[1:28:24] the law condemned us to sin and the law
[1:28:26] was has no Grace it only tells you
[1:28:28] you're a sinner but when Jesus came on
[1:28:30] the scene he was the Fulfillment he was
[1:28:32] the Fulfillment of everything God
[1:28:33] promised he was the perfect identical
[1:28:36] image of the promise therefore all
[1:28:39] Promises of the Old Testament was met in
[1:28:41] Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses
[1:28:43] it couldn't be met in any of prophets
[1:28:44] but it was met in the
[1:28:46] Masterpiece and I'm it matched all that
[1:28:49] it said it was going to be praise God
[1:28:53] let's read the next part so will the
[1:28:54] church have to be a match to everything
[1:28:56] God has promised it must be the peace
[1:28:59] that's smitten off of it so if the
[1:29:01] original is the word so will the
[1:29:03] subjects have been taken from it be the
[1:29:05] word to match its side we'll come back
[1:29:07] to that again later now let's go over to
[1:29:10] paragraph 108 on page
[1:29:16] 21 page 21 paragraph 108 now for nearly
[1:29:20] 2,000 years God has been making him a
[1:29:23] masterpiece because he struck Adam a
[1:29:26] piece off of him part of him a rib to
[1:29:28] make a wife for him and now that perfect
[1:29:30] Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he
[1:29:32] got a piece off of him it's just the New
[1:29:35] Testament that's all he fulfilled the
[1:29:37] Old Testament now it's the New Testament
[1:29:40] another piece to be fulfilled see the
[1:29:43] New and Old Testament is husband and
[1:29:45] wife and it takes the new the old to for
[1:29:48] fores show the new Christ came the
[1:29:50] Masterpiece to fulf fulfill that now his
[1:29:53] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:29:55] the New Testament another Masterpiece in
[1:29:57] the making and it taken him 4,000 years
[1:30:00] to make this masterpiece now he's been
[1:30:03] for nearly 2,000 years making another
[1:30:05] Masterpiece a bride for Christ another
[1:30:08] Masterpiece and so doing it he does it
[1:30:10] by his never changing method the same
[1:30:12] way he made the Masterpiece his word
[1:30:15] that's the way he makes his masterpieces
[1:30:17] because he can only be a perfect
[1:30:19] Masterpiece when it's the perfect word
[1:30:23] what is the old New Testament husband
[1:30:24] and wife Christ and his bride he come
[1:30:27] down the capping off to fulfill all the
[1:30:30] Old Testament for 4,000 years he built
[1:30:32] back Adam that had fallen the Son of God
[1:30:35] now he was the last Adam he was the
[1:30:37] perfect Masterpiece and so he did the
[1:30:39] same thing he did to Adam he smoted him
[1:30:41] and took a piece for a bride and for
[1:30:42] 2,000 years he's been building back a
[1:30:45] masterpiece of a bride and now in the
[1:30:47] end time the Capstone is coming back to
[1:30:50] this bride which is what the same
[1:30:52] headship that capped the first one is
[1:30:54] capping the next one it is Christ
[1:30:56] himself the word coming down to make her
[1:30:59] a perfect reflection of the piece that
[1:31:01] was smoken off now she's to fulfill he
[1:31:04] fulfilled the Old Testament she's to
[1:31:06] fulfill everything that was written in
[1:31:07] the New
[1:31:09] Testament and she's not Jesus fleshed it
[1:31:13] out and lived it we're here to flesh it
[1:31:15] out and live
[1:31:17] it amen and amen and amen how are we
[1:31:21] going to do it cuz the headships come
[1:31:23] down the same one who lived the word is
[1:31:25] the same one here living the word it's
[1:31:27] not us ourselves but it's the headship
[1:31:29] of Christ has come down and the life of
[1:31:31] that word is coming to us to manifest
[1:31:35] itself amen now the the last question
[1:31:40] what does the three stages of of of
[1:31:42] wheat development
[1:31:44] produce we all know this but I just love
[1:31:46] going through it again let's look at
[1:31:47] paragraph
[1:31:50] 122
[1:31:52] he types it with the church
[1:31:54] ages and the paragraph 122 at the bottom
[1:31:57] of page 23 the corn of wheat that fell
[1:31:59] into the ground at Nia Council began to
[1:32:01] sprout again in Martin Luther like any
[1:32:04] corn coming up or wheat after the seeds
[1:32:06] rough the life Springs forth and he
[1:32:08] began to bring forth in Martin Luther
[1:32:10] what did he do the first thing uh reject
[1:32:13] the denomination of Catholicism protest
[1:32:16] that it was wrong for he said the just
[1:32:18] shall live by faith what was it a little
[1:32:20] weak life that put up a couple little
[1:32:22] shoots that was the Luthers it sure
[1:32:24] don't look like the grain that went in
[1:32:26] the ground but the life is coming up now
[1:32:29] then it went on to stalk then what
[1:32:30] happened in the days of John Wesley what
[1:32:32] did he do when he brought out
[1:32:33] sanctification he stayed with the word
[1:32:35] and what did it do the lutherans had
[1:32:37] organized and made an organization so it
[1:32:39] was time for something to happen the
[1:32:41] Masterpiece is being built now what did
[1:32:43] he do what uh what did he do he
[1:32:46] protested the Anglican Church came out
[1:32:49] in the Reformation as a tassel what what
[1:32:51] is it the seed is coming to life growing
[1:32:54] now now the stalk doesn't look like the
[1:32:56] seed neither does the tassel let's go
[1:32:58] down paragraph 127 now that stalk don't
[1:33:01] look nothing like a seed neither does
[1:33:03] the tassel look like a seed but notice
[1:33:05] now not in Luther's day but in the last
[1:33:07] day the first thing there is a wheat
[1:33:09] farmer sitting here the first thing that
[1:33:11] comes forth on a wheat seed you would
[1:33:13] almost think it was a seed what is it
[1:33:15] it's the husk it forms a little outside
[1:33:18] thing like to hold the seed it forms a
[1:33:20] husk but the hus husk is not the seed no
[1:33:23] more than the tassel of the stalk was
[1:33:25] it's only a carrier of the life the
[1:33:27] corner wheat then St John 12 you see
[1:33:31] Jesus speaking the wheat after the
[1:33:33] tassel after the Wesley puts forth the
[1:33:35] husk which is the foremost like the
[1:33:37] grain of anything else the husk is more
[1:33:39] like the grain it's coming more like the
[1:33:41] grain all the time the one that went in
[1:33:43] the ground and when it comes forth the
[1:33:45] stalk it's got life in it but it sure
[1:33:48] isn't the grain it comes forth the
[1:33:49] tossel the pollen it still isn't the
[1:33:51] Grain and when then it comes forth the
[1:33:54] husk and it's just in the shape of the
[1:33:56] wheat just exactly like the grain and
[1:33:58] wheat but yet it isn't the wheat just
[1:34:00] exactly in the same shape perfectly
[1:34:03] let's go down to paragraph 134 notice
[1:34:06] here the life was in the stalk tossel
[1:34:08] all now ends up in the seed the life
[1:34:10] that come out of the original seed come
[1:34:12] up through the different processes three
[1:34:14] different processes and then turns back
[1:34:16] to its original condition here's where
[1:34:20] we really get down to our answer what
[1:34:21] does the three stages of wheat
[1:34:22] development produce it brings it back to
[1:34:25] its original condition what was Luther
[1:34:28] Wesley and Pentecost supposed to do
[1:34:29] bring it back to its original condition
[1:34:32] what's the original condition Pentecost
[1:34:35] amen what happened in the first at the
[1:34:37] first when the Holy Ghost first fell is
[1:34:39] to bring us back into the original
[1:34:42] condition amen come up through the
[1:34:44] different processes three different
[1:34:46] processes and then turns back to its
[1:34:48] original condition he goes now he says
[1:34:50] oh I'm the happiest person in the world
[1:34:52] that God has let me see watch how
[1:34:54] perfectly the word in these nature works
[1:34:57] together why is brother Benham so happy
[1:34:58] to see this because the church ages has
[1:35:00] been so confusing amen the Pentecostal
[1:35:03] Revival has been so confusing but now
[1:35:05] he's the happiest person in the world
[1:35:07] that God has cut away all the confusion
[1:35:09] and explained what it's all been about
[1:35:11] because brother brandom couldn't say
[1:35:12] Luther wasn't a real Christian he
[1:35:14] couldn't say Wesley wasn't he couldn't
[1:35:15] say the isusa Street Revival wasn't a
[1:35:17] real Revival and they weren't real
[1:35:18] Christians but then it goes and then it
[1:35:20] goes to denom ation then it then it
[1:35:22] refuses to move on with the word and
[1:35:24] it's so confusing until God comes back
[1:35:27] and types it with nature and say no I
[1:35:29] will restore sayeth the Lord I'm it's a
[1:35:32] restoration process that seed amen that
[1:35:35] fell on the day of Pentecost had to go
[1:35:37] into the ground at NAA and die and then
[1:35:40] come back through three stages of growth
[1:35:42] to do what to bring it back to its
[1:35:45] original condition
[1:35:47] again that is what the church ages have
[1:35:50] been about
[1:35:52] now let's read paragraph
[1:35:54] 136 notice here the life that was in the
[1:35:57] husk in the stalk in the tossle in the
[1:35:59] husk all gathers in the seed and the
[1:36:02] life that was in the stalk went one went
[1:36:04] to make another justification made a way
[1:36:07] for sanctification sanctification made a
[1:36:10] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:12] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a
[1:36:14] way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:36:16] right down in
[1:36:18] Perfection back to the word again to
[1:36:21] manif EST
[1:36:22] itself what is this bride supposed to be
[1:36:25] she has to come back to
[1:36:29] Perfection you say brother Chad that's
[1:36:31] impossible look in the mirror listen I
[1:36:34] know In the Flesh humanly that's
[1:36:36] impossible but he's washed her with he's
[1:36:38] washing her with a perfect word to bring
[1:36:41] forth A Perfect Bride what's The Perfect
[1:36:43] Bride I I I I don't know what it will be
[1:36:47] like at the moment before the
[1:36:49] translation of the body I can't tell you
[1:36:51] I can't say that it'll be perfectly
[1:36:53] Flawless but what I believe a Perfect
[1:36:55] Bride will be is a bride perfectly
[1:36:58] submitted to the headship of the
[1:37:00] word that's what I believe and that's
[1:37:03] what God is washing all the
[1:37:05] denominations and all our idea by the
[1:37:07] washing of the water of the bleeding
[1:37:09] word he's washing everything away and
[1:37:11] bringing a bride into Perfection who
[1:37:14] will just stay with his
[1:37:17] word that's I think what he calls A
[1:37:19] Perfect Bride
[1:37:22] that's what we're coming to friends am
[1:37:26] amen I just want to make just a couple
[1:37:28] other quick little points let's go to
[1:37:30] paragraph
[1:37:40] 84 before we do that I think it's
[1:37:42] interesting that brother Venom says this
[1:37:44] process of three brought us back to the
[1:37:47] grain back to the
[1:37:49] original and then he says it wasn't the
[1:37:52] first second or third
[1:37:53] Foundation that the it could be said it
[1:37:56] could only be set on the fourth
[1:37:57] Foundation cuz the fourth Foundation
[1:38:00] amen was Perfection was Joseph and now
[1:38:04] the first three stages of the wheat
[1:38:05] plant the restoration of the brid tree
[1:38:07] he couldn't set that headship down on
[1:38:09] any of those it couldn't come until it
[1:38:12] come back to the fourth back to the
[1:38:13] grain itself so we've had to come
[1:38:16] through Luther Wesley and the
[1:38:18] Pentecostal Revival and we had to go
[1:38:20] beyond that because it's got to come
[1:38:22] back into its original condition the
[1:38:25] fourth amen the fourth stage back to the
[1:38:29] original and that's what's transpiring
[1:38:31] right
[1:38:33] now praise
[1:38:35] God all right let's look at paragraph 84
[1:38:39] I'm not going to read 84 but we're I'm
[1:38:41] pointing to it to show this is where he
[1:38:42] begins talking about the China
[1:38:44] laundrymen the China men and the Chinese
[1:38:46] ticket the ticket that was torn the two
[1:38:48] pieces have to come back and match and
[1:38:49] it's so interesting the way brother
[1:38:51] bandam uses this if we go down to the uh
[1:38:55] paragraph
[1:38:57] 85 let's go to the second paragraph
[1:38:59] under
[1:39:00] 85 so will the church have to be a match
[1:39:03] to everything God has promised it must
[1:39:06] be the piece that was smitten off of it
[1:39:09] so if the original is the word so will
[1:39:11] the subjects been taken from it be the
[1:39:13] word to match its side so the bride what
[1:39:17] does the bride have to do for these two
[1:39:19] pieces of the laundry man's ticket to
[1:39:20] come back together what's the first
[1:39:22] piece the first piece is the Old
[1:39:24] Testament it's the word off of that came
[1:39:27] the new testament which is the word one
[1:39:30] is the bridegroom one is the bride and
[1:39:33] these two must fit back together again
[1:39:36] that's why there's been a restoration of
[1:39:38] the word because nothing else will fit
[1:39:41] but a perfect reflection of the New
[1:39:43] Testament amen when Paul told us how to
[1:39:46] dress we've got to dress that way when
[1:39:47] Paul told us not forsake the assembly we
[1:39:49] can't forsake the assembly amen when
[1:39:52] when when Peter told us to baptize in
[1:39:53] the name of Lord Jesus Christ we must
[1:39:55] baptize it's not just going through
[1:39:57] motions it's a actually a restoration
[1:39:59] back to the word because only the word
[1:40:01] will fit back into the side of this
[1:40:04] masterpiece so he's got to wash he's got
[1:40:06] to bring us through the stage he got to
[1:40:07] bring us back to the original to believe
[1:40:10] what the apostles and Prophets and the
[1:40:12] disciples had written in the word so
[1:40:14] that it can be fleshed out and manifest
[1:40:17] what is she the New Testament that's all
[1:40:19] she's everything that was written in the
[1:40:21] New Testament if they laid hands on and
[1:40:23] prayed for we lay hands on and prayed
[1:40:24] for if they Anointed with oil we anoint
[1:40:26] with oil if they believe for healing We
[1:40:27] Believe for
[1:40:29] healing if they had gifts we have gifts
[1:40:32] why it's got to be the full reflection
[1:40:34] of the word to connect back amen what
[1:40:37] for for Redemption to bring it back to
[1:40:41] Eden praise God that's what this message
[1:40:45] is doing for us amen it's bringing us
[1:40:48] back into that amen word
[1:40:52] image
[1:40:55] Amen Let me
[1:40:58] see all
[1:41:06] right yeah let's go to paragraph
[1:41:09] 101 on page
[1:41:19] 20 101
[1:41:21] but let us not forget that in the
[1:41:22] beginning when he smoked the side of
[1:41:24] Adam he took something from his side now
[1:41:26] the smiting of Christ was for a cause
[1:41:28] that he might take from him one to be a
[1:41:30] family the bride he might take him a
[1:41:32] bride so his Masterpiece was perfected
[1:41:35] then he had to Smite it to take from him
[1:41:37] not another piece not another creation
[1:41:40] but of the same creation my brother
[1:41:42] don't think bad at this but think a
[1:41:44] minute if he took from him the original
[1:41:46] creation to make the bride for him he
[1:41:48] never made another creation he took a
[1:41:50] part of of the original creation then if
[1:41:53] he was the word what must the bride be
[1:41:55] it's got to be the original word Living
[1:41:58] God in the
[1:42:00] word the word has got to connect back to
[1:42:03] the word why because it what was smitten
[1:42:06] off was the
[1:42:07] word then let's go to paragraph 105
[1:42:10] because I think brother Benham he'll
[1:42:11] take an analogy and he just keeps
[1:42:13] breaking it down and using it in so many
[1:42:15] different ways he said Jesus Christ was
[1:42:18] the other half of the laundry ticket to
[1:42:20] the word to the promises so he when he
[1:42:24] fulfilled all the promises then he come
[1:42:26] to complete the word and the promises
[1:42:27] and when that connected back together
[1:42:29] that unlocked Redemption for you and
[1:42:31] I then he showed that out of him came
[1:42:34] the bride and now when they come back
[1:42:37] together when those two half it's the
[1:42:38] completion of redemption to go back to
[1:42:40] Eden so he just keeps break he keeps
[1:42:43] working an analogy over and over so you
[1:42:44] don't stop and you're thinking it's only
[1:42:46] this amen he keeps using it but then
[1:42:48] he's going to take this analogy now of
[1:42:51] the diamond and The Cutting of a diamond
[1:42:53] because the diamond doesn't shine light
[1:42:55] until it cuts and he's going to show
[1:42:57] that we have to be cut by what by the
[1:42:59] word because only the right kind of tool
[1:43:01] can cut the diamond and so it reflects
[1:43:03] the light but then he's also going to
[1:43:05] use Christ the word is the diamond and
[1:43:07] the piece cut off what's the purpose of
[1:43:09] that and I thought this was interesting
[1:43:11] 105 the Masterpiece must be cut cut for
[1:43:14] what it's the piece cut off no the piece
[1:43:17] that's cut off is made of victrola
[1:43:20] needle
[1:43:21] now hold on stop here there's young
[1:43:23] people amongst
[1:43:24] us I got to stop for just a
[1:43:27] minute you may have been in a museum
[1:43:30] sometime and seen a vinyl
[1:43:34] record and they used to take this
[1:43:36] plastic vinyl record and they cut
[1:43:37] grooves in it and you'd put a little on
[1:43:40] a little plate and that plate had a
[1:43:42] motor and it would Spin and you would
[1:43:44] take a little needle and put a needle
[1:43:46] down and as that needle moved on those
[1:43:48] grooves it reproduced sound out of a
[1:43:50] speaker that's how we actually used to
[1:43:52] have music and stuff a long time
[1:43:54] ago I know it's blowing your mind now
[1:43:57] but we didn't have anything digital
[1:44:00] right but that little needle and
[1:44:03] originally they would use a piece of
[1:44:04] diamond on that that little victrola
[1:44:07] needle now listen to what he said that
[1:44:09] piece that's cut off it's made of
[1:44:10] victrola needle and the victrola needle
[1:44:13] is put upon a record that's unseen music
[1:44:15] to the world but the needle is what
[1:44:18] brings it out brings out the truth true
[1:44:21] interpretation of the word do you
[1:44:23] believe you're a piece that's smitten
[1:44:25] off the great Diamond then what are we
[1:44:27] supposed to be doing we're supposed to
[1:44:29] be following the rhythm of the word and
[1:44:33] reproducing the word in
[1:44:37] manifestation amen this is the word this
[1:44:40] is the record that that has the grooves
[1:44:42] cut in it and nobody can read that and
[1:44:45] understand what it is you can look at
[1:44:46] all the grooves on a vinyl record and
[1:44:48] you can't make the music it's going to
[1:44:50] take the needle to replicate the sound
[1:44:52] amen and that's what all the pieces that
[1:44:55] are smitten off of that great Diamond
[1:44:57] we're here to be those needles that
[1:45:00] reproduce the what the true
[1:45:02] interpretation of the word what does it
[1:45:04] mean to be a church what does it mean to
[1:45:06] be modest what does it mean to be holy
[1:45:08] what does it mean to submit to the
[1:45:09] headship of the word what does it mean
[1:45:11] that's what we're here to play that
[1:45:14] record praise God oh I love that I love
[1:45:19] how how brother B could just keep
[1:45:20] working in
[1:45:23] analogy
[1:45:27] amen praise be to God all right we might
[1:45:30] be
[1:45:34] done oh paragraph 96 on page 19 I don't
[1:45:38] want to leave without making note of
[1:45:40] this this blessed me so
[1:45:43] much paragraph 96 on page
[1:45:47] 19 remember he was the son of prosperity
[1:45:50] everything he did prospered whether it
[1:45:53] was prison or whether it was it came
[1:45:55] outright and hasn't he promised for his
[1:45:58] children that he'd make everything work
[1:46:00] together for the good whether it was
[1:46:02] sickness prison house death sorrow
[1:46:04] whatever it was that it would work for
[1:46:06] the good to them that loved him he
[1:46:08] promised it and it must be so it's got
[1:46:10] to be there it's figurative spoke to us
[1:46:13] in him he was the perfect image of God
[1:46:16] he's taking the type of Joseph Joseph is
[1:46:18] the perfect reflection of Jesus Christ
[1:46:20] Joseph was a Prophet Joseph was loved of
[1:46:22] his father hated of his brothers sold
[1:46:24] into slavery in the prison house and one
[1:46:27] was saved the Baker and one was lost the
[1:46:29] baker the butler however it was then he
[1:46:31] ascended on high to the right hand of
[1:46:33] the throne no one could go to Pharaoh
[1:46:35] but by him and he's using that analogy
[1:46:38] in showing now Jesus Christ is the son
[1:46:40] of prosperity everywhere Joseph went it
[1:46:43] prospered in the prison house it
[1:46:44] prospered in slavery it prospered in his
[1:46:46] family it prospered at the right hand of
[1:46:48] the throne it prospered but
[1:46:51] now he's our son of prosperity and now
[1:46:54] because we're his children we get the
[1:46:57] same benefit of the Perfection of the of
[1:46:59] the child of prosperity and he's
[1:47:01] promised for us everything will work out
[1:47:05] just like it did for Joseph just like it
[1:47:06] did for Jesus no matter where we wind up
[1:47:09] no matter what trial we're going through
[1:47:11] we are married connected children of God
[1:47:14] and part of the son of
[1:47:17] prosperity cuz why his word can't fail
[1:47:21] he's determined to have a
[1:47:23] masterpiece we go through things yes we
[1:47:25] go through things and sometimes it gets
[1:47:27] scary sometimes it gets dark but don't
[1:47:29] forget who we're connected
[1:47:32] to God is so good praise God let's all
[1:47:36] stand musicians if you please
[1:47:42] come God is so good I love that part
[1:47:46] where brother Benham was talking about
[1:47:48] this nation no nation's gone years we
[1:47:50] won't go back and read it but you
[1:47:51] remember said this nation's only got 11
[1:47:54] years left he said will it stand no he
[1:47:56] didn't see any way it was going to make
[1:47:58] it we've crossed 250 years but I love
[1:48:02] what he said it's got to fall every
[1:48:05] nation has got to fall every Kingdom's
[1:48:08] got to fall to make room for the kingdom
[1:48:11] that's not going to fall and we're
[1:48:13] watching it
[1:48:16] fall we're W it's right before our eyes
[1:48:19] this nation this kingdom is
[1:48:22] falling but Prophet said it has to fall
[1:48:25] to make room for his
[1:48:27] kingdom every other Kingdom has the fall
[1:48:30] when we see it
[1:48:32] falling listen if you get too patriotic
[1:48:34] you're going to be too heartbroken and
[1:48:36] it's a shame and it's a sad thing but
[1:48:39] every Kingdom has to fall why to make
[1:48:41] room for his
[1:48:43] kingdom the collapse of America is
[1:48:45] making room for the King of Kings to
[1:48:48] come and Rule and reign
[1:48:50] and that will not break our
[1:48:53] hearts that's what our hearts are
[1:48:55] longing for amen I love you all it's so
[1:48:59] fun to go through these messages
[1:49:00] together I love it amen let's sing give
