[0:00] So you must understand now here's Jesus
[0:04] and remember what happens to him will
[0:06] happen to the bride the same way. Amen.
[0:08] Wherever it's written of Christ you must
[0:10] see the bride is part of Christ and he
[0:12] sits in the
[0:14] temple and he opens the book and what
[0:17] does he do? He finds himself.
[0:20] He finds himself. He said it is written
[0:22] of me.
[0:24] Okay. So when when when when when he
[0:27] finds himself in that way, he closed the
[0:29] book. He said, "The whole book is
[0:31] written of me." Praise God. Brother, you
[0:33] come to a place in your time where you
[0:36] find your name in the book.
[0:39] I've seen people healed and I know there
[0:43] is a there is a there's a question of
[0:44] our mind and so forth and we have to
[0:46] deal with it. Amen.
[0:49] Amen. People consist of body, soul, and
[0:52] spirit. You have there's healing for all
[0:53] three of them. Amen. But the healing of
[0:55] the soul in reality is the revelation of
[0:58] who you are. Amen.
[1:00] Amen. And then we have healing. Brother
[1:02] William said God has many ways to heal.
[1:05] He heals by love. He leads by surgery.
[1:07] He heals by by by understanding. Okay.
[1:10] Amen. So please understand the way the
[1:13] time comes when you find yourself in the
[1:15] book. God allows it. You need it in
[1:18] order to go home. Now here's brother
[1:20] Brandon. Okay. Memphis, Tennessee. The
[1:23] plane is not uh is there is a there is a
[1:27] storm. He hears the voice go and he just
[1:29] goes and here is that mama and I just
[1:32] call it mama just okay. Brother said she
[1:34] hangs over the fence. Yeah. Okay. And
[1:37] brother Brandon passes by and she she
[1:39] says hello parson. Yeah. Amen. He says
[1:42] how do you know that I'm a minister?
[1:44] Look God is in humor. Amen. Normally it
[1:47] was brother Brandon revealing the
[1:48] people. Your name is Eva. I see you in a
[1:51] car accident. But that woman is now
[1:53] revealing brother Brennan. She He does
[1:56] not know who she is, but she knows who
[1:58] he is. Understand?
[2:01] Amen. Amen. You're the prophet Elijah
[2:03] and I'm the Shunomite woman. But I tell
[2:06] you one thing, to find Brother Benham in
[2:08] the Bible, it's not very difficult. But
[2:10] you must find yourself.
[2:12] She did not only say this is brother
[2:14] Brandham, you are the prophet Elijah. He
[2:15] said you are the prophet Elijah and I
[2:18] am.
[2:20] Amen. That's all. Therefore, you read
[2:23] the book of Esther. He said, "That's
[2:25] me." Esther had no father and she had no
[2:28] mother. Types Melchazedc.
[2:31] Esther had two names. One was the
[2:32] American name. The other one was her
[2:35] eternal name. Eternal identification.
[2:38] Can you say amen? Blessed be the name.
[2:41] And that's the love of the father. Amen.
[2:43] That is God revealing himself to us. So
[2:46] we understand at the end of our life,
[2:49] I'm not the son of Charles and Ala
[2:50] Brrenham. No, no. I am I come from God
[2:54] and I go back to God. This message
[2:57] really revealed our identity.
