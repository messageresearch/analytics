[8:10] with you today
[8:12] amen if you could take your bibles while
[8:13] we're standing and turn to daniel
[8:17] um i want to start off this morning
[8:21] and speak a little bit about the
[8:22] election and what we're seeing in the
[8:24] nation i know there's a lot of quotes
[8:26] flying around and a lot of things
[8:29] going on and i thought would just be
[8:30] good to re read the quotes together
[8:32] amen and then watch and see what god's
[8:34] doing
[8:36] i'd like to read here in daniel
[8:39] chapter 4 daniel chapter 4 together
[8:48] daniel chapter 4
[8:52] and verse 31.
[8:55] while the word was in the king's mouth
[8:57] there fell a voice from heaven saying o
[8:59] king nebuchadnezzar to thee it has
[9:01] spoken the kingdom has departed from
[9:03] thee
[9:03] and they shall drive thee from men and
[9:05] they in thy dwelling
[9:07] shall be with the beast of the field
[9:09] they shall make thee to eat grass as
[9:11] oxen and seven times shall pass over
[9:13] thee until thou know that the most high
[9:15] ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth
[9:17] it to whomsoever
[9:19] he will god's in charge
[9:23] and i'm thankful for that amen let's bow
[9:25] our heads and pray
[9:27] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[9:29] jesus for this day
[9:31] for your wisdom lord for your word god
[9:33] we thank you for the
[9:34] gift of love that you've given to us by
[9:37] sending a prophet revealing your word
[9:39] and giving a word lord and
[9:41] i pray god as we look at that you give
[9:43] us wisdom lord as we move forward in
[9:44] this life
[9:46] lord as we as we look into the
[9:47] scriptures lord for the life that we're
[9:49] to live
[9:50] i pray that you would open it to us lord
[9:51] that we might see it the way you
[9:53] intended for it to be seen
[9:55] we love your god we ask your blessing
[9:56] over everything we say or do
[9:58] may you have preeminence and may we be
[10:00] pleasing to you
[10:01] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[10:04] you can all have your seeds i just want
[10:07] to read some quotes and make a few
[10:08] comments but it's not really what i want
[10:09] to preach about i have another subject
[10:11] that i want to preach on so hopefully
[10:13] this only take a couple of minutes
[10:16] let's turn to second chronicles read
[10:19] another scripture in second chronicles
[10:27] second chronicles chapter 20.
[10:35] and i'd like to read verse 6 second
[10:37] chronicles 20 and 6
[10:39] and said o lord god of our fathers are
[10:42] not thou got in heaven and rule us not
[10:44] thou
[10:44] over all the kingdoms of the heathen and
[10:46] in thy hand is there not power and might
[10:48] so that none is able to withstand thee
[10:52] and so we realize that god's the one
[10:54] who's ruling over all the kingdoms and
[10:55] god's the one who gives us kingdoms and
[10:57] take it away
[10:58] he rises kings and he puts kings down so
[11:00] god's in control
[11:02] so if god's in control there's nothing
[11:03] to worry about nothing to fret about
[11:05] and there's also i would say this
[11:07] there's nothing for us to figure out
[11:10] god's already figured it out amen and i
[11:12] just want to talk about this for a
[11:14] minute in context of some things brother
[11:15] branham said because i find it
[11:16] fascinating and very interesting
[11:18] and by the way if i cough a little bit
[11:20] don't worry about me because i have an
[11:22] allergy cough and it doesn't bother me
[11:24] and i hope it doesn't bother you amen
[11:27] this is one of those areas that i battle
[11:29] with and i fight the devil and i believe
[11:31] i'm going to gain victory
[11:32] by the blood of jesus christ but i'm
[11:34] going to fight the good fight and preach
[11:35] anyways
[11:37] so you just pull anyhow don't feel sorry
[11:39] for me just pool
[11:41] it works and then one thing i want to
[11:44] say about the election is
[11:46] uh you know you all know i'm sure you
[11:48] know by now that
[11:50] most the news agencies has declared
[11:52] biden to be the
[11:53] the victor and it's not a it's not
[11:55] official yet it's not been
[11:57] certified i guess it's the official term
[11:59] and so there's
[12:00] it's contested we know all of those
[12:02] things always a big fight
[12:04] always a big show amen
[12:07] and i'm not interested in the show i'm
[12:10] tuned to another channel and i'm
[12:11] interested in what we're reading in the
[12:12] word of god amen
[12:14] so i'm tuned out of that channel but
[12:15] interesting it's quite interesting
[12:18] but but there's a lot of quotes going
[12:20] around and i thought we'd just read
[12:22] those together because i find them
[12:23] fascinating
[12:24] and everything god does everything that
[12:26] happens god does for a reason
[12:28] and we we cannot make american politics
[12:32] insignificant though we can't get caught
[12:34] up in it
[12:35] we've got to be careful we don't get
[12:36] caught up in it because we know that
[12:38] america
[12:39] shows up in revelation chapter 13 as the
[12:41] beast that rose
[12:42] out of the earth and it's significant in
[12:44] end time prophecy so what happens here
[12:47] has significance as significance
[12:49] globally has significance with end time
[12:51] prophecies
[12:52] and it's america who's going to turn the
[12:54] world back to the beast
[12:55] so so we know that these things are
[12:58] happening with significance everything
[13:00] happens with significance
[13:01] the danger for us is get calling get
[13:03] caught up into politics because brother
[13:05] branham said politics is the devil
[13:07] he said i'm neither republican or
[13:08] democrat they're all crooked
[13:10] and so i was reading excuse me i was
[13:13] reading a quote one time
[13:15] my brother venom said you know there's
[13:17] three great isms in the world nazism
[13:19] communism
[13:20] fascism and he says they're spirits
[13:23] he said they're spirits and he said and
[13:25] they get on you
[13:27] they're spirits that they can get on you
[13:29] and we know that methodism is a spirit
[13:31] pentecostalism the spirit
[13:32] there's spirits to get on you but i'd
[13:35] also say this and i say this
[13:37] i hope you forgive me for saying it i'm
[13:39] your brother
[13:40] but patriotism is a spirit
[13:43] that can get on you conservatism
[13:47] is a spirit that can get on you
[13:51] liberalism is the spirit everybody says
[13:53] amen liberalism is a spirit amen
[13:55] liberalism is a spirit that can get on
[13:57] you
[13:59] but then i'll say conservatism
[14:05] they're against abortion and you know
[14:10] right you see the devil's using it all
[14:13] he's playing this game and
[14:15] it's not for us to get caught up in
[14:17] those arenas amen and get
[14:19] it's just a distraction it's just a
[14:20] distraction to take us from what we're
[14:22] supposed to be focused on
[14:23] and get our focus in and and and to the
[14:26] thing that's all corrupt
[14:28] but the member said it's all corrupt
[14:30] politics is all corrupt why focus on
[14:32] it's all corrupt
[14:33] and when they do something corrupt it
[14:34] shocks you why are you shocked the
[14:36] prophet said it's corrupt
[14:38] there's nothing shocking about
[14:39] corruption there's nothing shocking
[14:41] about
[14:41] about any of the things that we see amen
[14:44] as an american you can be shocking be
[14:46] disappointed discouraged but as a
[14:47] christian who believes the message this
[14:49] shouldn't be shocking
[14:51] it shouldn't even be discouraging
[14:55] because god is in control so
[14:58] the one thing i want to do as we move
[15:00] forward like i said there's quotes that
[15:01] are fascinating interesting i'm
[15:02] interested i'm watching with great
[15:04] interest
[15:04] my intention is peaked amen because of
[15:07] some things that that
[15:08] transpired um but
[15:13] i want to be cautious and say let god
[15:16] interpret his word by bringing it to
[15:18] pass
[15:20] because you know i feel like in the past
[15:23] i have done damage to my testimony by
[15:27] getting ahead of god and presuming and
[15:30] speculating and my speculation and
[15:32] presuming
[15:33] i'll start off saying well this is just
[15:34] me speculation and presuming and i'll
[15:36] speculate and presume time convinced of
[15:38] my own speculation and presumption
[15:40] and then i start to claim it as fact
[15:44] and then you know and then all of a
[15:45] sudden i just disappoint and discourage
[15:47] myself
[15:48] and others that around me and i don't
[15:50] want to do that this time
[15:53] amen i don't want to do that with any of
[15:54] the word i just want to be
[15:56] simple-minded i want to be a simple
[15:58] believer to take god's word
[16:00] believe it hold on to it let god bring
[16:02] it to pass the way he chooses to bring
[16:04] it to pass
[16:05] and i just want to watch what he's doing
[16:08] and fight this urge there's an urge
[16:11] excuse me there's an urgent all
[16:14] christian and maybe it's just a human
[16:16] nature thing there's this urge always to
[16:18] be the first one who knew
[16:20] or the first one who figured it out
[16:23] i mean you'll start hearing terms that
[16:25] you didn't hear a week ago
[16:27] you'll start hearing things like oh i
[16:28] knew i had a feeling
[16:30] i thought it was going to be mine i
[16:32] thought it was going to be this i
[16:33] thought it was going to be that
[16:34] why didn't you say anything two weeks
[16:36] ago
[16:38] i mean i'm not discounting that maybe
[16:40] you had that feeling maybe you had that
[16:42] thought
[16:42] but you realize the point is there's
[16:44] something in human nature
[16:46] a man wants to know and he wants to
[16:49] prove that he knows he wants to be the
[16:50] first to know and he wants to know the
[16:52] most
[16:56] and i say forget all of that just be
[16:58] simple humble farmer shepherd
[17:01] let god do what god's going to do and
[17:03] then recognize what he's doing as he
[17:05] does it
[17:06] god interprets his word by bringing it
[17:08] to pass amen he brings it to past and he
[17:10] shows you what he did
[17:13] right and so let's just let's just
[17:16] remain humble and just observe just say
[17:19] hey
[17:20] this is what the prophet said and i and
[17:22] i and i say let's focus on what the
[17:24] prophet said let's take those quotes and
[17:25] hold them
[17:26] and let's watch and say wow this is
[17:28] interesting in light of what the prophet
[17:30] said
[17:30] but don't say well if this then that and
[17:33] this means this and then that
[17:35] oh that's where we're going to get in
[17:36] trouble friends i say just be
[17:38] humble be a humble know nothing nobody
[17:42] amen ignorant to the ways of the world
[17:44] and the eyes of the world an ignorant
[17:46] nobody no nothing because that's the
[17:49] ones he's looking for that he wants to
[17:50] use
[17:52] not the ones who's constantly getting
[17:53] ahead
[17:55] and saying well then this and then that
[17:57] and this will happen and that
[17:59] and then it doesn't happen
[18:03] i mean don't discourage our children in
[18:05] the message by talking this way at home
[18:08] well this is gonna that's gonna happen
[18:10] and your children are watching they're
[18:11] not dumb
[18:14] and when everything he says is going to
[18:15] happen doesn't happen
[18:18] we just proved one thing you're not
[18:20] brother branham
[18:24] so i mean maybe that's a good lesson for
[18:25] the kid
[18:29] but i say that as a caution so we have
[18:32] the right mental attitude the right
[18:34] approach the right
[18:35] just be simple just be humble don't be
[18:38] the first one off the line the first one
[18:40] to jump on sunday
[18:41] the first one that figured it out i
[18:43] don't care if i'm the last one that
[18:45] figured it out
[18:46] as long as i caught the true revelation
[18:48] of the lord and recognized the genuine
[18:50] word of god
[18:52] i don't have to be the first i don't
[18:53] have to be in the front running i don't
[18:55] have to
[18:56] i don't have to be the expert on these
[18:58] things hey i could be last
[19:00] as long as i gets the true revelation of
[19:03] the true word
[19:04] can identify and identify myself with it
[19:07] then i thank god for that because that's
[19:09] by his grace
[19:11] so there's a couple quotes that i want
[19:14] to go through
[19:15] and anytime something like this happens
[19:17] it's funny
[19:19] there'll be quotes flying all over the
[19:20] internet
[19:22] facebook and watch out and you'll get
[19:24] them text to you and all of this stuff
[19:26] and it's just it's just interesting to
[19:28] me i don't know
[19:29] it's just interesting and so i've never
[19:32] felt the need to share a quote
[19:35] you know in the in the light of 50 other
[19:38] people doing it at the same time let
[19:40] them do it they're already sharing it
[19:41] why would i send it out
[19:43] it's making its rounds everybody's going
[19:45] to get it but anyways
[19:47] in the message the door inside the door
[19:49] in 1960
[19:51] and the quotes i'm going to start
[19:52] reading are from i think all of them are
[19:54] going to be from 1960.
[19:56] and this one's in july of 1960 and in
[19:58] july of 1960
[20:00] there's there's a presidential race on
[20:02] for an election that's going to be in
[20:04] that november
[20:05] and that election is going to be between
[20:06] richard nixon and john f kennedy
[20:09] so here brother branham is in july
[20:11] before that
[20:12] and this is the statement that he makes
[20:14] he's in prayer he's praying
[20:16] out of service he's saying now we thank
[20:18] thee
[20:20] for the holy spirit that gives us
[20:21] comfort in this hour and we pray father
[20:24] that he will abide with us forever as
[20:26] the shadows are lengthening out
[20:28] and we know the sun is setting on
[20:30] civilization
[20:31] god we would pray now for this great
[20:33] nation of ours that's in the time of the
[20:35] changing of presidents
[20:37] it might seem like a light thing but god
[20:38] it might change the destination of this
[20:41] nation
[20:42] oh lord thou who would choose the
[20:44] prophets and anoint the kings
[20:45] we pray that your holy spirit would
[20:47] anoint the right man for us in this hour
[20:49] granted lord where the great rallies are
[20:52] going on on both parties father we
[20:53] realize that you're not interested in
[20:55] parties
[20:56] it's man that you can trust so i pray
[20:58] father that somewhere along that
[21:00] they'll choose the right man for the
[21:02] hour
[21:03] we know that the hour has to come when
[21:05] the wrong man will be chosen too
[21:08] so we pray father that you'll give us a
[21:10] little more time to bring in the lost
[21:12] may
[21:12] if there be any of those here tonight
[21:14] seeing the shadows lengthening out
[21:16] may they come sweetly to the lord jesus
[21:18] and be saved heal the sick and afflicted
[21:20] strengthen the church for we ask it in
[21:22] jesus name
[21:23] amen so brother baby's praying and he's
[21:25] asking he said lord
[21:27] would you have them pick the right man
[21:29] because we know there's coming a day
[21:30] that they'll choose the wrong man
[21:32] and that was brother branham's prayer
[21:34] he's at a meeting in oregon
[21:36] and the message doors and doors he's
[21:37] praying that and he says
[21:39] would you choose the right man we know
[21:41] that they'll choose the wrong amen and
[21:42] he says
[21:43] in god's and brother ben's motive is
[21:46] that we'll have more time
[21:48] to save the lost
[21:51] but a couple months later in this
[21:53] election brother venom comes back later
[21:55] says they chose the wrong man
[21:58] he says exactly he chose the wrong man
[22:00] and you think but even brother branham
[22:02] as a man
[22:02] as a citizen of the united states uh as
[22:05] a minister in these meetings
[22:07] uh he's praying for for the nation he's
[22:09] praying for the direction of the nation
[22:11] he's praying that they'll choose the
[22:12] right man
[22:12] but he says we know that one day they'll
[22:14] choose the wrong man
[22:16] but he's asking god to choose the right
[22:17] man and he comes right back and says
[22:19] they chose the wrong man
[22:21] and you see god has a purpose and a plan
[22:24] and a timing and an appointed person
[22:27] and a point of time and he'll do it
[22:29] regardless
[22:30] brother man was asking for the right man
[22:32] and brother ben said they chose the
[22:33] wrong man
[22:34] but god still answered his prayer
[22:37] because he gave us more time to save the
[22:39] lost
[22:41] right how long has the goal has that
[22:44] been that brother brandon prayed that
[22:45] prayer from 1960 to now
[22:47] it's been 60 years and god is merciful
[22:49] and that he's given us more time to save
[22:51] the lost
[22:52] because that was brother bennett's
[22:53] motivation behind the prayer
[22:55] and god answered that prayer and still
[22:57] allowed his prophecy to move forward
[22:59] according to his perfect time
[23:01] and allowed the wrong man to get elected
[23:04] so praise be to god no matter
[23:10] no matter what ideas we get
[23:14] or what things we conjure up in our mind
[23:17] god already has a plan and god's gonna
[23:20] work his plan
[23:23] again in september he says september the
[23:26] same year 1960
[23:27] five definite identifications of the
[23:30] true church of the living god
[23:31] he says but did you notice in revelation
[23:34] 13 when the united states come up is the
[23:36] only beast in the bible
[23:39] that come up that did not come out of
[23:40] the waters the bible said it come up out
[23:42] of the earth
[23:43] where there was no peoples that was the
[23:45] new kingdom
[23:46] and it looked like a lamb but after a
[23:48] while it spake like the dragon
[23:50] that's this country it's got to happen
[23:52] someday they'll make a mistake and elect
[23:54] the wrong guy
[23:55] they'll raise up a pharaoh that doesn't
[23:58] know joseph
[23:59] they tried it before and they'll do it
[24:01] again if they fail in this time
[24:04] brother was talking about the current
[24:05] election that was going on between
[24:06] kennedy and nixon
[24:08] he said they tried it before and they'll
[24:10] do it again
[24:11] if they fail this time so they were
[24:14] trying to raise up a pharaoh that knew
[24:16] not joseph
[24:18] it's finally come the bible said so and
[24:20] i'm not a politician both sides of them
[24:22] are crooked
[24:23] amen can you say amen
[24:26] all righty both sides of them are
[24:28] crooked i'm casting my vote on jesus
[24:30] christ he's the only one i'm interested
[24:32] in
[24:33] but i tell you you'd better wipe your
[24:34] glasses off now if you expect any
[24:36] freedom for your children
[24:38] i don't know how close it is pray all
[24:41] right oh that was an interesting
[24:42] statement too
[24:44] brother benham he knew what this meant
[24:46] you know he knew what was happening
[24:49] in the message conference this is uh
[24:51] november 25th this would be after the
[24:53] election
[24:54] november 25th he says we now have a
[24:58] president
[24:59] now he's now he's going back in prophecy
[25:01] he's going to talk about
[25:02] roosevelt now he's talking about the
[25:05] vision that he had in 1933 of the seven
[25:07] things that had to happen
[25:08] we now have a president and he's
[25:09] referring back then and this mr
[25:11] roosevelt will cause the world to go
[25:13] into the world
[25:14] war through his time of his
[25:15] administration
[25:17] as president and then said and during
[25:19] this time they have permitted women to
[25:21] vote
[25:22] which will be a curse to the nation
[25:24] they'll elect the wrong man sometime
[25:26] and they did the other day so brother
[25:29] branham before the election was praying
[25:31] god
[25:32] and get the right let them choose the
[25:34] right man we know sometimes they'll
[25:35] choose the wrong man let him choose the
[25:36] right man that we have more time to save
[25:38] the laws
[25:38] he comes right after the election and he
[25:40] said they allowed the women to vote
[25:42] which would be a curse for this nation
[25:45] and if brother ben said it's true it
[25:47] doesn't matter what feministic ideas we
[25:48] pick up out of laodicea it's still true
[25:52] [Music]
[25:53] he said it'd be a curse to this nation
[25:56] they'll finally elect the wrong man and
[25:58] they did he said they did
[26:00] so this is the pharaoh who knew not
[26:01] joseph this is the wrong
[26:03] man that brother ben was talking about
[26:05] now i want you to be careful
[26:07] and understand that brother bannon is
[26:09] not saying he's the wrong man
[26:11] for prophecy he said he's the wrong man
[26:14] for the nation
[26:16] he's not the wrong man in god like god
[26:20] made a mistake
[26:21] oh god you put the wrong man in brother
[26:23] branham is clear i'll read it another
[26:25] quote he's the wrong man for the nation
[26:27] he's
[26:28] not the wrong man for prophecy
[26:32] he was the right man for prophecy
[26:36] all right
[26:39] he says in when he's preaching the
[26:41] ephesian church age in december of 1960
[26:43] he says now
[26:44] it said there at that time there'd be a
[26:46] great woman stand up in the united
[26:47] states and
[26:48] she was dressed and beautiful but she
[26:50] was cruel and hard and i got in
[26:51] parentheses on this vision even yellow
[26:53] paper said perhaps the catholic church
[26:56] and the woman being permitted the women
[26:58] being permitted to vote would help
[26:59] elect the wrong person for this nation
[27:02] and that's what they've done
[27:03] exactly now said that would be the
[27:06] beginning
[27:08] so all the way back there when the women
[27:10] were allowed to vote they vote the wrong
[27:11] man and that would be the beginning
[27:12] that would be the beginning of something
[27:14] the beginning of a cycle at the
[27:15] beginning of something setting in
[27:17] the beginning of an end time prophecy
[27:19] moving forward that brother branham
[27:21] prophesied about this that would be the
[27:22] beginning
[27:24] so we look back that was the beginning
[27:28] now he's preaching just the next week in
[27:30] the later scene church age
[27:32] he says but they'll be a powerful woman
[27:35] now remember this is on tape too a
[27:37] powerful woman great woman
[27:39] she'll either be president or it'll be a
[27:41] woman representing the catholic church
[27:43] which i think it is will take over here
[27:46] someday
[27:47] and she'll rule this country now
[27:50] excuse me what brother branham was
[27:53] seeing
[27:54] and he states it emphatically here in a
[27:56] little bit i'll read it just in a minute
[27:57] but brother branham is stating that he
[28:00] believes that
[28:01] the election of john f kennedy as the
[28:03] first catholic president was an
[28:05] open door for the catholic church to
[28:06] begin to move in and take over the
[28:08] country
[28:09] and and he was exactly right he said
[28:11] that'll be the opening that they need
[28:13] and they'll fill the cabinet with
[28:15] positions of
[28:16] of those who are catholic and we realize
[28:18] now that our supreme court is the
[28:19] majority catholics
[28:21] uh congress as uh catholics every
[28:24] office every position in the high higher
[28:26] parts of the land the higher offices
[28:28] are catholic and brother ben said the
[28:30] ushering in was the electing of kennedy
[28:32] as president
[28:34] and so we realized brother bam knows
[28:36] what he's talking about he's right it
[28:38] needs to be the catholic church that
[28:40] comes in
[28:41] amen and and he's correct and he states
[28:43] that like i said emphatically here
[28:45] shortly
[28:45] so i want to keep that straight in her
[28:47] mind
[28:49] here's a quote that i found to be very
[28:51] very interesting this goes all the way
[28:53] back
[28:53] to july of 1960 before the election
[28:58] said everything is a woman and remember
[29:00] thus saith the lord there will be a
[29:01] woman ruled before the end time
[29:03] she'll either be president vice
[29:05] president or it'll be the catholic
[29:07] church as a woman
[29:08] i've seen her this is the one that's
[29:10] making its rounds on the internet
[29:13] because it says vice president and i
[29:15] don't think wrongfully so i don't think
[29:17] it's wrong to look at this this is what
[29:18] the prophet said
[29:19] so i don't think you're wrong in drawing
[29:21] attention to this or focusing on it
[29:23] but so i don't i don't mean that in any
[29:25] disregard ever i think it's fascinating
[29:27] she'll either be president vice
[29:29] president or it be the catholic church
[29:30] as a woman
[29:31] i've seen her a great woman the nation
[29:34] bowed to her
[29:35] it'll be one before the end time thus
[29:37] saith the lord write it down and find
[29:39] out you young people
[29:40] see if it happens if it isn't i'm a
[29:41] false prophet
[29:45] then i want to read from the message
[29:47] once more
[29:49] from 1963 right at the end of 1963 and
[29:52] november 17
[29:53] he he has this statement he said in 1933
[29:56] the holy spirit came one morning and
[29:58] told me seven things
[29:59] that would take place before this nation
[30:01] was destroyed
[30:02] one of them is that it's it's on on old
[30:05] paper here at the church many has looked
[30:06] at it
[30:08] how they will go to war with hitler how
[30:10] germany would fortify
[30:11] and build imagine online or the
[30:13] siegfried line i believe it was 11 years
[30:15] before it was ever
[30:15] thought of and how that automobiles
[30:18] would constantly shape like eggs and
[30:20] how that they would permit women to vote
[30:21] and in doing so they would elect the
[30:23] wrong president
[30:24] and then this would be a woman's and in
[30:27] this
[30:28] would be a woman stand up that would
[30:29] govern the united states
[30:31] not actually a woman but a church then i
[30:34] seen her with nothing but ashes it's
[30:36] going to happen
[30:38] so brother branham is emphatic that that
[30:42] he he believes he saw
[30:46] this woman rising the power and he
[30:48] believes it's the catholic church he
[30:49] said not a woman but a church
[30:51] and so i don't ever want to forget that
[30:53] don't ever forget what the brother
[30:54] brother
[30:55] emphasized and what brother brahms
[30:56] stated it was and what brother brahm
[30:58] declared him
[30:59] himself to believe it was what he saw
[31:01] happening and what we've seen happen
[31:02] since and so now if we want to know that
[31:06] great woman that's rising the power in
[31:08] the united states
[31:09] i can say it's the catholic church
[31:15] praise god and i don't want to throw
[31:19] away what brother venom said
[31:20] or what he thought i want to hold it
[31:22] with great value because we've seen that
[31:25] he saw it he declared it we see it
[31:29] but i'm not done reading
[31:34] this is what i think is interesting this
[31:37] is why i just want to watch these things
[31:39] i just want to watch them
[31:40] i don't want to make predictions and i
[31:42] don't want to i don't want to fill in
[31:44] any blanks if there's a blank i'm
[31:46] content to leave it blank
[31:49] if i don't know i'm comfortable saying i
[31:52] don't know
[31:53] but he says in the laodicean
[31:56] church age out of the church age book
[31:58] now remember the church age book was
[32:00] edited you know in 1963-64 and it came
[32:03] out towards the end of 1965 so brother
[32:05] branham had an opportunity to carefully
[32:07] read over
[32:08] what was in the church age book edit it
[32:10] make corrections and put it in print
[32:12] and he even was doing that after the
[32:14] seals so
[32:16] that's why i really like the church age
[32:17] book but he says
[32:19] here it says then in the sixth vision
[32:22] there rose up in america most beautiful
[32:23] but cruel woman
[32:25] she held the people in her complete
[32:26] power i believe that this was the rise
[32:28] of the roman catholic church
[32:30] though i knew it could possibly be a
[32:32] vision of some woman rising in great
[32:34] power in america
[32:35] due to a popular vote by women but i
[32:38] think that's interesting
[32:39] he said i believe it was the catholic
[32:40] church but i knew that it
[32:42] could possibly be a vision of some woman
[32:45] rising in great power in america due
[32:47] to a popular vote by women so brother in
[32:49] the church age book he's not ruling out
[32:51] the possibility
[32:53] and so when you read this sometimes you
[32:55] just you wonder brother ben said it was
[32:57] the catholic church we know it's the
[32:58] catholic church we know it's the church
[32:59] it's the spiritual church
[33:01] it's that spiritual anointing that has
[33:02] to rise up and take power
[33:04] because they're going to point back amen
[33:06] to the catholic church it's going to be
[33:07] a tie-in for the nation back we know
[33:10] that
[33:10] but also we know that prophecy has
[33:13] natural and spiritual types and multiple
[33:15] fulfillments and
[33:16] all of that so the question is will god
[33:19] also raise a woman into power as a
[33:21] natural type of what's happened
[33:23] spiritually
[33:24] i say i don't know is it possible yes a
[33:27] scripture worked that way before in the
[33:28] past
[33:29] absolutely i won't rule it out i won't
[33:32] say this is this and this is that
[33:34] and this is that and that or not this or
[33:36] not that i'll just say i'm watching this
[33:38] interesting because i'm very interested
[33:40] in this
[33:42] another thing that he says two
[33:44] paragraphs later
[33:46] and out of the church age book he said
[33:49] the catholic church is on the rise
[33:51] we have had one catholic president and
[33:53] will no doubt have another
[33:55] that's an interesting statement because
[33:57] from the time of kennedy on we never had
[33:59] another catholic president
[34:01] and brother ben made the statement he
[34:03] says we've had one and no doubt
[34:05] we'll have another but we haven't had
[34:07] another
[34:08] unless joe biden is confirmed as
[34:11] president he'll be the second
[34:13] catholic president we've had the first
[34:15] was john f kennedy
[34:17] and so i i thought i thought this is so
[34:20] interesting
[34:20] because we've watched over the last
[34:22] several years so many things that are
[34:24] happening
[34:24] uh happening in society happening in
[34:27] politics
[34:27] happening around the world it's it's
[34:29] almost like a repeat of the 60s
[34:33] it's almost like the end of brother
[34:35] bannon's ministry
[34:36] what he was watching going in america
[34:38] and go around the world
[34:39] and social unrest and and uh
[34:42] uh uh he was watching this social unrest
[34:45] he was watching the movement
[34:47] of the homosexual movement coming in the
[34:50] uh
[34:50] he was watching marriages divorces and
[34:52] remarriage take
[34:53] run rampant in america he was watching
[34:55] immorality spread to america drug abuse
[34:57] rebellion he was looking at riots in the
[34:59] street political corruption
[35:04] right all of this was happening at the
[35:06] end of the prophet's ministry starts
[35:08] declaring it declaring it declaring it
[35:10] and in in so many ways it feels like
[35:13] this last handful of years
[35:14] we've repeated the cycle
[35:17] even brother branham i mean just as is
[35:20] as simple as this
[35:22] that brother branham would say marilyn
[35:24] monroe he saw her die and he says you
[35:26] know they're going to say she committed
[35:27] suicide but it wasn't suicide
[35:31] and i think it was four or five years
[35:32] ago
[35:34] there was a magazine a magazine that
[35:36] came out
[35:37] and the cover of the magazine was a
[35:38] picture of marilyn monroe and the word
[35:40] says it was not suicide
[35:44] why did that come out now what's this
[35:47] thing given down
[35:48] who's left in america that cares i don't
[35:52] mean that to be mean but
[35:55] but it's in every magazine rack and
[35:57] every walmart and every grocery store
[35:59] there's a picture of marilyn monroe and
[36:00] the great bold words it was not
[36:03] suicide just to get our attention
[36:05] friends to recognize
[36:06] amen that there's a repeat in the cycle
[36:10] he says they'll say it was but you say
[36:12] it was not suicide
[36:13] amen so we've been saying it's not
[36:15] suicide and now there's a magazine that
[36:17] comes out and says this wasn't suicide
[36:20] and it's a trivial thing that's not a
[36:21] big deal but it's another confirmation
[36:26] so i think it's i think it's fascinating
[36:28] so we remember one catholic president
[36:30] the catholic president came in brother
[36:32] brennam said listen this is the prophet
[36:34] of god
[36:35] he said he came in by the vote of women
[36:38] they voted in the wrong one and by
[36:40] crooked voting machines
[36:46] hey crap he said the fbi proved it this
[36:48] is what brother branham said
[36:50] crooked voting machines the fbi approved
[36:52] it and why won't they do anything about
[36:53] it because those people don't want to
[36:55] lose their jobs he said something like
[36:56] that
[36:57] and i thought of all the allegations
[36:59] we're hearing and all this stuff and
[37:01] then
[37:01] i was like it's surreal pinch yourself
[37:03] it's like it's almost like the bride is
[37:06] walking right through some of these same
[37:07] scenarios and god's pointing some of
[37:09] these things
[37:10] just to get our attention to see and i'm
[37:12] not saying this is this and this is that
[37:14] drawing i'm not
[37:15] i'm just saying this is interesting it's
[37:16] like a little flag waving say look over
[37:18] here
[37:19] look over here and i tell you my friends
[37:20] i'm looking
[37:22] i'm interested i'm watching i think it's
[37:24] amazing i think it's amazing that
[37:26] if this confirmation goes through if if
[37:29] this vote is certified it goes through
[37:31] we know it'll have legal contesting and
[37:32] all this
[37:33] and you know and it's there's a
[37:34] possibility that trump will pull a
[37:36] rabbit out of the hat
[37:37] and he'll remain president i don't know
[37:39] what's going to happen i have no idea
[37:41] but god's allowed this to happen so far
[37:44] would you agree what's happened has
[37:46] happened so far to get our attention
[37:48] what happened next i don't know so i'm
[37:50] not going to say because if it was one
[37:51] where the other then i'm going to have
[37:53] to come back and say i'm sorry i was
[37:54] wrong
[37:56] that was just me that wasn't the lord
[37:57] will you pray for me
[37:59] and i i'm tired of doing that friends
[38:04] i just i'm getting burnt out on all that
[38:08] so let's not pollute the prophecy with
[38:11] our own thinking
[38:13] let's not corrupt the words of a prophet
[38:15] with our own interjections just let him
[38:18] say what he said
[38:19] and watch what happens and let god bring
[38:23] clarity
[38:24] by the events that unfold not by our own
[38:27] secret understanding and why do we piece
[38:29] together and what my mind has conjured
[38:31] up
[38:31] just let god bring the clarity let him
[38:33] make the picture more clear
[38:35] by bringing more to pass and let's just
[38:38] be comfortable with that
[38:40] but is it worth watching yes
[38:44] uh i watched the acceptance speech last
[38:48] night
[38:48] and kamala hare spoke first and then joe
[38:51] biden
[38:52] and kamala harris it was interesting it
[38:54] was surreal friends i
[38:55] this is when all these things start
[38:57] click click click click click
[38:58] popping off i realized i didn't realize
[39:01] until yesterday joe biden was catholic
[39:03] that shows you how interested i am in
[39:04] politics
[39:07] but uh i'm watching this
[39:11] and she's the first woman ever to be
[39:13] vice president
[39:15] the first woman of color first person of
[39:16] color i think to be vice president as
[39:18] well
[39:19] so many things they're claiming as
[39:20] milestones if it goes through and it's
[39:22] confirmed it'll it'll
[39:23] it'll um you know be new records new new
[39:26] achievements in that way
[39:29] but when she's standing there speaking
[39:33] she's giving all credit to that day that
[39:35] this what she calls success
[39:37] she's giving 100 credit to the right for
[39:39] women to vote
[39:46] she's giving all the credit say so many
[39:49] years ago
[39:50] we fought for the right to vote and
[39:52] women have fought and that has secured
[39:54] this victory here today
[39:56] you know statement like that so what was
[39:58] it it was the women's vote
[40:01] that got in the right guy for prophecy
[40:03] possibly i don't know it's not confirmed
[40:05] i don't want to jump ahead
[40:07] but if it is the right guy for prophecy
[40:11] and that guy who was the right guy for
[40:13] prophecy was the one who ushered in
[40:15] authority to the woman
[40:17] to the catholic church
[40:21] as i was reading through some quotes i
[40:23] come across an interesting one now
[40:25] friends these are just things that are
[40:26] interesting to me
[40:27] so please don't get ahead of the program
[40:30] and don't misinterpret what i'm saying
[40:33] what i'd like to say more than anything
[40:34] to you is i don't know
[40:36] if you walk away from here from anything
[40:38] and you want to ask me a question
[40:40] it's going to be the same answer i don't
[40:41] know but i'll tell you something i'm
[40:43] interested
[40:44] i'm curious i'm watching
[40:49] joe biden happens to be when he's
[40:51] inaugurated he'll be if it happens if it
[40:53] goes forward
[40:54] he'll be 78 years old he'll be the
[40:56] oldest president ever inaugurated
[41:00] so i don't know what the statistics are
[41:04] but it leaves an open door
[41:09] leaves an open door also
[41:13] [Music]
[41:15] i was reading some quotes throughout the
[41:18] day last couple days
[41:19] i was reading some quotes and i come
[41:21] across this quote where brother branham
[41:23] was talking about john f kennedy
[41:25] and he says his wife has more influence
[41:28] than him
[41:29] she's influencing the nation and i said
[41:32] he says and he's more she's more popular
[41:35] than he is
[41:36] and he makes this statement he he goes
[41:39] he even said
[41:40] i'm her husband i'm her husband that's
[41:43] the statement i'm her husband
[41:45] and brother branham said imagine that
[41:47] the president united states i mean
[41:48] brother ben was disgusted at this
[41:49] because what he's seeing is he's seeing
[41:51] a man take a submissive role amen and
[41:54] point to lifting up and putting women in
[41:56] prominent positions
[41:57] where they don't belong and brother
[41:58] madam knows that this is wrong not that
[42:02] the man liked his wife i mean that's not
[42:03] what he's but he's looking at it on a
[42:05] bigger scale
[42:06] and that she has more influence than him
[42:07] and he says then you know
[42:10] she's my i'm her husband that's how he
[42:12] wasn't the president united states i'm
[42:14] her husband
[42:14] because she was so popular and last
[42:17] night in
[42:17] in the acceptance speech joe biden made
[42:19] the statement he stopped and he looked
[42:21] and he goes
[42:22] and i'm jill's husband
[42:25] it's his wife and i'm joe's husband and
[42:27] i just read that quote a couple of times
[42:29] over the last couple days
[42:30] and all of a sudden it hit me like
[42:33] i can't believe what i'm hearing it's
[42:36] like a repeat
[42:38] starts promoting his wife and how
[42:39] wonderful she is and what a good first
[42:41] lady she'll be
[42:42] and then i i was told and i haven't
[42:44] confirmed it that joe biden also made
[42:45] the statement that
[42:47] that that uh i remember
[42:51] i'm her he's talking about camilla
[42:54] harris she's the vice president i'm her
[42:56] running mate or something like that
[42:59] but you see he's he's doing the same
[43:01] thing kennedy did he's promoting the
[43:03] women
[43:03] because this is a woman's nation the
[43:06] catholic church is represented as a
[43:07] woman
[43:08] the woman has to take over and i'm not
[43:10] talking about just women in general
[43:12] i'm talking about that woman female
[43:13] dominating spirit
[43:15] from all the way back in the book of
[43:16] genesis that first amen moved outside
[43:19] from the authority of the word and when
[43:20] their own reasoning
[43:22] wanted and desired to have that tree
[43:26] i mean she'd be moved without authority
[43:27] and she moved outside of authority amen
[43:30] she took it herself and there's always
[43:31] been that struggle amen that jezebel
[43:33] spirit that female dominating spirit
[43:35] which is on the catholic church which is
[43:37] on the nation
[43:41] and when you start seeing these things
[43:42] i'm sorry i'm i'm hearing the same
[43:44] things
[43:45] the same phrases and i thought this is
[43:48] super curious and super interesting
[43:51] where it'll go next i don't know what
[43:53] will be confirmed
[43:54] i don't know i don't know what to say i
[43:56] don't know what will happen next
[43:58] all i know is i'm curious enough to
[44:00] watch
[44:02] my interest is peaked i want to look at
[44:04] the quotes i want to look at what
[44:05] brother branham said
[44:06] i don't want to take away what he said i
[44:08] don't want to change what he said
[44:10] i don't want to manipulate what he said
[44:11] i just want to take what he said and
[44:13] watch what happens
[44:14] because this is interesting friends this
[44:17] is interesting
[44:18] what god will do next i don't know but
[44:20] what i want to caution you
[44:22] in is don't draw your own conclusions
[44:25] don't don't try to be the first one that
[44:28] figured it out
[44:30] don't try to be the ones that i knew i
[44:33] had a hunch
[44:34] i felt like well that's fine
[44:38] but let's just watch and see what
[44:40] happens
[44:42] i can tell you i gotta hunch i know what
[44:43] happened next and i could be a million
[44:45] miles from right
[44:46] i just i'm just i'm content just
[44:49] watching
[44:50] i'm content saying god you're doing
[44:51] something you've got our attention
[44:53] you're
[44:53] you're waving a little flag too many
[44:55] pieces are coming together that are too
[44:57] interesting and i'm just interested i
[45:00] feel like we're
[45:00] i feel like i feel like just me
[45:03] personally i feel like in many ways
[45:04] the bride is walking right in the
[45:06] footsteps of brother branham what he did
[45:08] at the end of his ministry the things he
[45:10] saw the things he knew and experienced
[45:11] was going on we're in so many ways
[45:14] moving through that same cycle
[45:15] and to me it's just fascinating i'm
[45:18] fascinated by it
[45:19] and that doesn't give me any any way of
[45:21] saying this means that or this will
[45:23] happen next
[45:24] but it's just super interesting to me
[45:26] and i hope it's super interesting to you
[45:29] so we can sit down at dinner and we can
[45:31] have some talk and say is this a
[45:32] possibility with that matter and maybe
[45:34] this and maybe that
[45:35] and you know we can have fun doing that
[45:36] we do that about heaven we do that about
[45:38] the millennium
[45:40] but when we get up from the table we got
[45:41] to be willing to say the real reality is
[45:44] i don't know the real truth is
[45:48] i don't know and god has surprised me so
[45:50] many times
[45:55] i mean it's almost like he does it on
[45:57] purpose friends
[45:58] it's almost like he'll show you
[46:00] something and
[46:01] everything lines up so good it's like
[46:04] god did it on purpose
[46:07] so you're so confident in what you're
[46:09] seeing so confident
[46:11] in the pieces that are together and i
[46:13] think i've got
[46:14] i mean i'm pretty sure that this is it
[46:16] and it's got to be that
[46:18] and god will pull a switcheroo so fast
[46:21] it leaves you dumbfounded how did this
[46:23] happen and it's like you're hanging out
[46:24] nowhere
[46:25] you're totally exposed and you're like
[46:27] god you did that on purpose you did that
[46:29] on purpose
[46:33] and at the end of the day you're
[46:34] thankful because if you let it work out
[46:37] once i try it again
[46:40] before too long i'd be off in my own
[46:42] religion with my own interpretation with
[46:44] my own understanding
[46:47] so i love it when god pulls a switcheroo
[46:50] on us
[46:51] and leaves your jaw dropped and be like
[46:52] i didn't see that coming
[46:55] i never foresaw that happening and then
[46:58] you can just relax and say
[47:00] i don't have to i don't have to foresee
[47:03] it i don't have to predict it i don't
[47:04] have to figure it out i don't have to be
[47:06] ahead of the curve
[47:07] all i got to do is stick with this
[47:08] prophet
[47:10] god will interpret his word by bringing
[47:12] it to pass and when he brings it to pass
[47:14] there'll be a witness in my heart says
[47:16] that's the truth
[47:18] i don't have to be super smart
[47:20] superhuman super nothing
[47:22] all i've got to do is be a believer
[47:25] so praise god don't set yourself up for
[47:29] a switcheroo
[47:31] don't get too far down the road friends
[47:34] just watch what god's doing
[47:35] and and be like all of us are just watch
[47:38] what god's doing and be amazed
[47:41] be amazed and say i
[47:44] didn't know that you could go checkmate
[47:46] from over here on the board
[47:49] god you've got moves that i've never
[47:53] dreamed of
[47:54] if anything i think 2020 would teach us
[47:56] that we don't know anything
[47:59] and we're failures at predictions
[48:03] praise god that's our protection friends
[48:06] that's our safety
[48:07] let god show us how ignorant we are let
[48:09] god show us how in our own mind and our
[48:11] own thinking we're never going to figure
[48:13] out what he's going to do
[48:14] what he's going to do he's already
[48:16] determined from before the foundation of
[48:17] the world
[48:18] it's going to happen it's going to
[48:19] happen right on time it's going to
[48:21] happen without our
[48:22] consultation he's going to do it and
[48:25] he's going to surprise us he surprised
[48:27] us
[48:27] and he will continue to surprise us
[48:30] and i'm excited about the surprises
[48:34] because every surprise so far has been
[48:35] exciting
[48:37] may not have been pleasant but they've
[48:39] been exciting
[48:41] so let's just let's just commit
[48:43] ourselves
[48:45] to trusting in the lord believing his
[48:48] word
[48:49] believing the prophet and letting god be
[48:51] god
[48:52] and him be in control let's all stand
[48:55] and we'll turn to another scripture i
[48:56] want to switch subjects
[48:58] because that's about as interested as i
[48:59] am in politics
[49:03] because we've got something that is sure
[49:08] we have something that's unmoving
[49:09] unchanging that's fixed it's not
[49:11] flexible by man's ideas
[49:13] it's not flexible by political waves
[49:15] movements
[49:16] it's fixed and it's sure let's look at
[49:19] galatians chapter 6.
[49:22] ernie i'm sorry genesis i'm sorry
[49:28] this is why you can't depend on me for
[49:30] anything
[49:31] i can't even give you my scripture
[49:32] reading right
[49:34] genesis chapter 6
[49:37] and we're going to begin with the first
[49:39] verse
[49:42] and it came to pass when men began to
[49:44] multiply on the face of the earth and
[49:45] daughters were born unto them
[49:47] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[49:49] of men that they were fair
[49:51] and they took them wise of all which
[49:52] they chose and the lord said my spirit
[49:55] shall not always strive with man
[49:57] for that he is also flesh yet his day
[49:59] shall be a hundred and twenty years
[50:02] there were giants in the earth in those
[50:04] days and also after that
[50:06] when the sons of god came into the
[50:07] daughters of men they bear children to
[50:10] them
[50:10] the same became mighty men excuse me men
[50:13] of old men of renown
[50:15] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[50:17] was great in the earth
[50:18] and that every imagination of the
[50:20] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[50:22] continually let's be seated you can all
[50:25] be seated and we'll continue on
[50:28] i want to take a minute and look at this
[50:29] and for a title i just want to look at
[50:32] the unscientific salvation of the
[50:34] righteous seed
[50:35] the unscientific salvation of the
[50:37] righteous seed
[50:38] and you'll see why we got to that in
[50:40] some quotes that we get to in a minute
[50:42] but i'd like to start by reading this
[50:43] quote and christ is the mystery of god
[50:44] revealed
[50:46] it says all right now search the
[50:48] scriptures he said moses and all the law
[50:50] and so forth and the prophets in psalms
[50:51] spoke of him and again he said the
[50:53] scriptures testify of him
[50:55] he is the principle theme of the entire
[50:57] bible
[50:58] if you read the bible and don't see
[51:00] christ in every verse of it go back and
[51:02] read it again see
[51:03] if you can't see christ in every verse
[51:05] of the bible then you read it again
[51:07] because you missed something the bible
[51:09] is christ he is the word
[51:11] when you read in the beginning god
[51:12] created there is christ from that to the
[51:14] amen in revelation is every word
[51:16] testifying of jesus christ and that's
[51:19] why when i read that i get excited when
[51:21] i go back through the bible again
[51:23] and i'll tell your friends i i have to
[51:25] confess that there's times that i read
[51:26] things and i don't see it
[51:28] where is jesus christ and i don't see it
[51:30] i don't see the great story i don't see
[51:32] the great mystery
[51:32] amen but the key is brother said read it
[51:35] again
[51:36] read it again it may not be in the fifth
[51:38] reading or the 10th reading or the 25th
[51:40] reading but
[51:41] but god at some point he keeps unlocking
[51:43] this word to us
[51:44] and we'll read it again and read it
[51:46] again and all of a sudden you say
[51:47] i see it i see it and i've been just
[51:50] going through genesis just myself
[51:52] for my own personal devotions and very
[51:54] much enjoying it and you know
[51:56] we look at the the seventh seal
[51:59] displayed all the way back in the
[52:00] beginning when
[52:01] when god began to create by spoken word
[52:03] he formed himself
[52:04] a world and formed in eden and placed a
[52:06] man there and made that man god over the
[52:09] earth and that was his son
[52:10] but his son was alone and needed
[52:12] companionship and he pulled without of
[52:14] him
[52:15] something that came from him that would
[52:17] be united back with him
[52:19] in the crowning act of all creation and
[52:21] god was displaying a seventh seal all
[52:23] the way back there
[52:23] when you look back at that story amen
[52:25] what as a child or when we were in
[52:27] denominations was a story
[52:29] a story of creation now all have become
[52:31] all of a sudden became a story of christ
[52:34] and every story every story begins to
[52:37] fit that same pattern we start to see
[52:39] christ
[52:39] here christ here it's all speaking of
[52:41] christ
[52:42] and we we want to look at this scripture
[52:44] that we're reading that
[52:46] that we know men began to multiply on
[52:48] the face of the earth and we know that
[52:49] there's two seed lines and
[52:51] and and god is working with the
[52:53] righteous seedline seth we talked about
[52:54] wednesday night
[52:55] seth was a replacement for abel abel
[52:58] went down
[52:59] amen he was killed by cain and but seth
[53:02] came up
[53:02] brother bam said as a type of the
[53:04] resurrection amen because christ died
[53:06] for us and he was resurrected
[53:08] and so seth the type of the resurrection
[53:10] and when he came back he came back with
[53:11] the same nature the same spirit he was a
[53:14] replacement seed for the seed of
[53:16] of abel and he and he came down to that
[53:18] righteous seed as a herdsmen as a as a
[53:20] farmer as a shepherd and
[53:22] humble amen but cain's line cain was a
[53:25] tiller of the soil
[53:26] and as he was a tiller of the soil he
[53:28] became a craftsman amen he began to till
[53:30] in the soil and find all the materials
[53:32] he needed
[53:33] to where he would build a city he would
[53:34] have a son and build a city and name the
[53:36] city after the name of his son and
[53:38] so civilization started with cain
[53:42] now god's line was just simple humble
[53:46] farmers worshipping jehovah amen
[53:49] meditating but cain's line was was the
[53:52] lion who was
[53:53] seeking to acquire to gain to have
[53:56] they were manipulating creation for
[53:58] their own
[53:59] glory for their own good
[54:02] and now we see that in genesis 6
[54:05] that there becomes an intermingling
[54:08] god was working with with the line
[54:11] through seth through god's line but
[54:12] they're becoming intermingling and
[54:14] and god became angry
[54:18] and he says let's read verse two or
[54:20] we'll start verse one again and it came
[54:22] to pass when men began to multiply on
[54:24] the face of the earth
[54:25] and daughters were born unto them the
[54:26] sons of god saw the daughters of men
[54:28] that they were
[54:29] fair they took them wives of all which
[54:31] they chose
[54:32] the lord said my spirit shall not always
[54:34] strive with man
[54:35] but he is also flesh yet the spirit
[54:37] shall be a hundred and twenty years
[54:40] there were giants in the land in those
[54:42] days and also after that when the sons
[54:43] of god came into the daughters of men
[54:45] and they bear children to them
[54:46] the same became mighty men which were of
[54:48] old men of renown
[54:49] and god saw the wickedness of man was
[54:52] great in the earth
[54:53] and that every imagination of the
[54:55] thought of his heart was only evil
[54:56] continually when you look at that phrase
[55:00] the imagination of the thoughts of his
[55:01] heart the word imagination means
[55:04] the form or purpose so his purpose
[55:07] his form his framework his purpose his
[55:10] foundation or his
[55:11] whole purpose or whole mode of operation
[55:14] the imagination of his thoughts his
[55:15] devices or his plans
[55:17] of his heart of his inner man was evil
[55:21] continually started
[55:24] all the way back when eve was seduced by
[55:28] the serpent
[55:29] and she was seduced to leave the word
[55:32] because
[55:33] satan was beguiling her into seduction
[55:35] he was unlocking her lusts
[55:37] and brother brenham said she had a lust
[55:39] for knowledge she wanted to know
[55:42] and the serpent was manipulating that
[55:45] desire to know
[55:46] and i would say one thing that we
[55:49] learned wednesday when we talked
[55:50] wednesday that this word that's
[55:51] interpreted new testament lust so many
[55:53] times in a negative way
[55:55] is also interpreted in a positive way on
[55:57] desire
[55:59] like the prophets of old desire to see
[56:01] your day it's the same word
[56:03] jesus when he went to the last supper he
[56:04] said i've desired to eat this supper
[56:06] with you
[56:06] it's it's it's not a bad word in that
[56:09] context
[56:10] amen because what the prophets desired
[56:12] was the word
[56:13] what jesus desired was fellowship with
[56:15] the attributes
[56:16] those were not wrong desires and i would
[56:18] say eve
[56:19] and her desire to know i would say
[56:22] foundationally it may not have been a
[56:24] wrong desire
[56:25] she wanted to know this mystery she
[56:28] wanted to know the mystery of life she
[56:30] wanted to know
[56:31] this great mystery amen there was
[56:33] something there
[56:34] amen that she wanted to know about and i
[56:37] would say
[56:38] it may not have been at its core it may
[56:40] not have been evil it may not have been
[56:42] wicked her desire to know amen i'd say
[56:44] friends there's things that we want to
[56:46] know
[56:47] there's things we want to know about
[56:48] life there's things we want to know
[56:50] about prophecy
[56:51] there's things we want to know what the
[56:52] prophet said and how it'll work and how
[56:54] it'll come to pass
[56:55] there are things that we want to know
[56:57] and that the basic foundation of our
[56:59] desire to know is a love for the word
[57:03] but satan can come in and can manipulate
[57:05] that desire
[57:06] and he can bring it to a fleshly lust
[57:09] and now we want to know
[57:11] and it may no longer be for pure motives
[57:15] and because we want to know amen he
[57:17] begins to give us
[57:18] opportunities and ways in which we can
[57:21] find answers
[57:24] and those ways in which we can find
[57:26] answers and we can know amen
[57:28] they're going to lead us into death and
[57:30] not into life and that's the whole
[57:31] purpose
[57:32] amen he took a desire that may not have
[57:34] been wrong at the beginning
[57:36] but he began to manipulate or seduce
[57:38] until all of a sudden she had to know
[57:40] how to know
[57:41] because it was all of a sudden something
[57:42] was going to be satisfying to her to
[57:44] know
[57:45] on a fleshly way pleasing to the eye one
[57:48] to make one wise
[57:49] amen good for food it become it becomes
[57:52] a it becomes something that become
[57:54] personal
[57:56] for the flesh amen we can get
[58:00] off in the weeds so easily amen even
[58:03] with doctrine even with
[58:04] things that the message that teaches us
[58:07] because we have
[58:08] maybe not at the core or wrong desire to
[58:11] know
[58:11] to do what brother brennan meant by that
[58:13] to know this truth of the bible what
[58:15] this scripture means
[58:16] that's not necessarily wrong but when
[58:18] the devil comes in and begins to
[58:20] manipulate that desire
[58:22] amen and begins to turn it to a fleshly
[58:24] desire a
[58:25] thirst a craving to know or to know
[58:27] first or to know more
[58:33] it's the same scene repeating over and
[58:36] over
[58:37] and over again
[58:41] we've got to be so careful with the word
[58:44] that we just leave the word the way god
[58:46] gave it to us
[58:48] and we believe it and we trust in it
[58:53] and we stick with it amen and we have a
[58:57] desire to see it fulfilled
[59:00] but we wait for god to do it his way
[59:03] because his way is perfect
[59:07] eve she found a way
[59:10] she came to an understanding and she was
[59:13] able to reproduce a life
[59:15] but that brought death corruption
[59:19] and we're all suffering from the same
[59:21] thing and now god looks down at man
[59:24] and he sees all of mankind is in this
[59:26] same situation now
[59:28] their whole framework their whole
[59:30] purpose the imagination
[59:32] of the thoughts of their heart the whole
[59:33] purpose and all of their devising
[59:36] and devices and planning of the inner
[59:38] man is
[59:39] all evil continually it's all given over
[59:42] to lust of the flesh
[59:44] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[59:46] life is now the motivation that's
[59:48] motivating everything
[59:51] and god said in verse 6
[59:55] genesis 6 6 and it repented the lord
[1:00:00] thee made man on the earth and it
[1:00:02] grieved him at his heart
[1:00:05] and the lord said i will destroy man
[1:00:07] whom i have created
[1:00:08] from the face of the earth both man and
[1:00:10] beast in the creeping thing and the
[1:00:11] fowls of the air
[1:00:12] for repenteth me that i have made them
[1:00:16] he goes on to say in verse 8 but noah
[1:00:18] found grace in the eyes of the lord
[1:00:22] they realized when noah found grace in
[1:00:24] the eyes of the lord
[1:00:25] it didn't mean that all of a sudden noah
[1:00:29] started doing something good and god
[1:00:31] noticed that he's a good boy
[1:00:32] if god if noah was a recipient of grace
[1:00:35] he was a recipient of grace before the
[1:00:37] foundation of the world
[1:00:39] all the world had corrupted itself every
[1:00:42] every imagination of the thoughts of the
[1:00:43] heart
[1:00:44] were evil continually it was all corrupt
[1:00:46] but there's a recipient of grace from
[1:00:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:50] amen a part of that righteous line and
[1:00:53] god he's a noah found
[1:00:55] of all that was wrong and all that had
[1:00:57] corrupted his it
[1:00:59] grieved him at his heart that he had
[1:01:01] made man and he wanted to destroy
[1:01:02] all of man but he could not destroy all
[1:01:05] of man
[1:01:06] because there was a recipient of grace
[1:01:07] on the earth
[1:01:10] and noah found grace in the eyes
[1:01:13] of the lord
[1:01:16] and let's read again verse 8 but noah
[1:01:18] found grace in the eyes of the lord
[1:01:20] these are the generations of noah noah
[1:01:22] was a just man and perfect in his
[1:01:24] generations
[1:01:24] and noah walked with god and noah got
[1:01:27] three sons shem ham
[1:01:28] and japheth now this is this is
[1:01:31] interesting terminology
[1:01:32] when he says he's perfect in his
[1:01:34] generations that word murphy
[1:01:36] perfect means complete whole entire or
[1:01:39] sound and when you turn to the word
[1:01:41] generations
[1:01:42] it means descendants results proceedings
[1:01:44] generations or genealogies
[1:01:48] so it wasn't just that this is the way i
[1:01:50] understand it
[1:01:51] it wasn't just that noah amen was
[1:01:54] perfect in that generation like he was
[1:01:56] the only one who was good in all of them
[1:01:58] but he was actually whole or complete in
[1:02:00] his genealogies
[1:02:02] he came from adam and man he wasn't part
[1:02:05] of the corruption the mixture
[1:02:07] of the seed lines i mean that's the way
[1:02:09] i understand it that that
[1:02:10] that he was perfect in his in his in his
[1:02:13] generation
[1:02:15] and so if god he found grace in the eyes
[1:02:18] of god and god was going to work through
[1:02:19] noah
[1:02:20] amen that he was going to bring bring
[1:02:21] about a salvation through noah
[1:02:24] now let's look at verse 22. we're going
[1:02:26] to back up but i just want to go to
[1:02:28] verse 22.
[1:02:29] and i want to read this together
[1:02:32] thus did noah according to all that god
[1:02:35] commanded him
[1:02:36] so did he now let's look at
[1:02:39] chapter 7 verse 5 and noah did according
[1:02:42] to all that the lord commanded him
[1:02:45] now we're going to find out that what
[1:02:49] noah did that was so spectacular
[1:02:52] what noah did that created the only
[1:02:54] means of salvation through the wrath of
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] what noah did that was so outstanding
[1:02:59] that we still talk about it today
[1:03:01] what noah did amen the the way that he
[1:03:04] figured out how to save his household
[1:03:06] the way that he preserved his life and
[1:03:09] the life of his household
[1:03:10] and preserved the seed line that would
[1:03:12] carry on preserve the plan of god
[1:03:14] preserve the word everything it was so
[1:03:16] amazing this event that took place
[1:03:18] and what did noah do amen how did he
[1:03:21] accomplish it
[1:03:22] how did he figure it out how did he come
[1:03:24] to this understanding
[1:03:26] and one way he just obeyed the lord
[1:03:30] all he did was just obey the lord noah
[1:03:32] didn't figure anything out
[1:03:34] he didn't use mathematics skills science
[1:03:36] skills reasoning
[1:03:37] understanding he didn't do anything to
[1:03:39] preserve salvation he didn't do anything
[1:03:41] to preserve
[1:03:42] the lineage he didn't do anything to
[1:03:43] preserve his life or the life of his
[1:03:45] family
[1:03:45] are all the created beings that were on
[1:03:47] the earth what did he do
[1:03:49] all he did was believe god and act on
[1:03:52] what god said
[1:03:53] he obeyed god amen and we come to this
[1:03:56] day where there's another destruction
[1:03:57] that's coming amen there was a
[1:03:59] destruction by water then but he
[1:04:00] promised never to destroy by flood again
[1:04:03] this time there's going to be a
[1:04:03] destruction by fire amen and there's an
[1:04:06] ark of safety today friends
[1:04:09] there's an ark that's been built there's
[1:04:10] an invitation to come into the ark
[1:04:12] amen and and we we are standing here
[1:04:15] like noah amen
[1:04:16] uh building on the ark making everything
[1:04:18] ready inviting people to come into this
[1:04:20] ark of safety
[1:04:21] and what do we have to do to ensure
[1:04:24] figure out
[1:04:25] i mean what mechanism do we have to use
[1:04:27] there's the same one
[1:04:28] noah used and that is obey god
[1:04:32] so simple so simple but so
[1:04:36] complicated for so many people
[1:04:39] sim i would say this way it's simple but
[1:04:41] hard
[1:04:45] it's not hard but it's hard it's simple
[1:04:49] but it's complicated
[1:04:51] i'll say it this way all know it had to
[1:04:54] do with what god said
[1:04:57] but to do what god said made his life
[1:04:59] really complicated
[1:05:03] god told him what to make how to make it
[1:05:07] what the dimensions were how to
[1:05:09] construct it we're going to find out at
[1:05:10] all that's for a reason
[1:05:12] and noah didn't have to figure out why
[1:05:15] he didn't first have to go to school to
[1:05:16] become an engineer
[1:05:17] he didn't have to he didn't have to
[1:05:19] maybe have all the understanding of why
[1:05:21] he was building it this way or why he
[1:05:23] was doing it this way but he had to have
[1:05:25] enough faith in god to obey god and do
[1:05:27] it god's way
[1:05:30] you know and there's so many times for
[1:05:34] years sometimes
[1:05:36] when we're when we're new believers or
[1:05:38] give our hearts to the lord we don't
[1:05:39] always understand
[1:05:40] why why does this commandment matter why
[1:05:43] is brother bam
[1:05:44] so why is he so firm on this
[1:05:48] feminist spirit why
[1:05:52] there's a way i dress why is he so firm
[1:05:54] on clothing and entire
[1:05:55] why does he say it so hard and so firm
[1:05:58] why
[1:05:59] amen and it's not for us to figure out
[1:06:01] it's for us just to obey
[1:06:04] we don't have to go to the school of
[1:06:05] theology first we don't have to have the
[1:06:07] answer to the question first
[1:06:08] god did not have to tell noah amen the
[1:06:12] engineering qualities of the design of
[1:06:15] the ship
[1:06:16] before noah started building it the way
[1:06:18] god said build it
[1:06:20] we don't always have to understand why
[1:06:23] it has to be this way
[1:06:24] or why god cares about this or why we're
[1:06:27] to obey this
[1:06:29] why do we structure our services this
[1:06:31] way because that's the way god wanted it
[1:06:35] why does it why is the clothing i put on
[1:06:37] my body matters so much that brother ben
[1:06:39] would preach about it
[1:06:40] all the time
[1:06:44] all the time why why why
[1:06:47] you don't have to understand why
[1:06:50] but we're going to find out is noah
[1:06:52] built this ship
[1:06:55] god is a master craftsman
[1:06:59] there's not a human engineer can
[1:07:00] out-engineer god
[1:07:04] and god knew exactly how high the waves
[1:07:06] would be
[1:07:08] he knew how much rain would fall he knew
[1:07:11] what course the ship would have to take
[1:07:13] he knew he knew everything that was
[1:07:15] going to have to happen he knew how many
[1:07:17] animals would have to hold how much food
[1:07:18] it was going to have to hold
[1:07:21] like can you imagine god says okay i'm
[1:07:24] going to take two
[1:07:25] of every kind of unclean beasts seven
[1:07:27] pairs of every
[1:07:28] uh clean beast we're going to keep them
[1:07:30] of every kind we're going to put them in
[1:07:32] the ark got to have enough food and
[1:07:33] provisions
[1:07:34] and i'm not going to tell you how long
[1:07:35] but just have lots of food and
[1:07:36] provisions
[1:07:37] and figure it out
[1:07:41] i would be like one two three
[1:07:46] how many animals how many square foot
[1:07:47] per animal
[1:07:50] how much food does each species eat i
[1:07:51] mean what kind of food how much food
[1:07:53] what quantities we need to have see god
[1:07:55] told him all that because god already
[1:07:56] had it all figured out
[1:07:58] and friends i'll tell you today god's
[1:08:00] got it all figured out
[1:08:02] he sent a prophet and he doesn't always
[1:08:04] give us the explanation of why
[1:08:06] he just tells us the truth he shows us
[1:08:08] in the word we take the word we don't
[1:08:10] always know why
[1:08:11] but we know it's got to be this way
[1:08:16] so many times people question what the
[1:08:17] prophet said because they
[1:08:19] don't clearly see it they don't clearly
[1:08:20] understand it and then they want to
[1:08:22] regulate it to the prophet's opinion
[1:08:26] because if i regulate to the prophet's
[1:08:27] opinion i can use my reasoning on the
[1:08:30] word amen and i can still accomplish my
[1:08:32] own lust
[1:08:34] amen but i'm telling you if the prophet
[1:08:37] is telling us something
[1:08:38] over and over and over again and he's
[1:08:39] telling us it's the word and he's
[1:08:41] telling us god
[1:08:42] it doesn't you know what it doesn't even
[1:08:44] matter if you can piece it together in
[1:08:46] the bible
[1:08:48] that's a vindicated prophet of god amen
[1:08:51] i would say god just help me lord help
[1:08:53] me to obey
[1:08:54] help me to be simple-minded enough of a
[1:08:57] farmer and a shepherd and not an
[1:08:58] engineer or theologian
[1:09:00] where i can just take what he said and
[1:09:01] say be it unto me lord
[1:09:03] let me obey that with all of my heart
[1:09:06] if that's the way you want me to act if
[1:09:08] that's the way you want me to dress is
[1:09:09] this what you say about marriage and
[1:09:10] divorces this is how we're supposed to
[1:09:12] raise children if this is how we're
[1:09:13] supposed to conduct church
[1:09:16] if this is who qualifies for this
[1:09:18] position and this who qualifies for that
[1:09:19] amen i'm going to say
[1:09:21] amen lord help us to do it exactly the
[1:09:23] way you said do it
[1:09:28] so god ends up telling noah to do what
[1:09:32] god told noah to do was
[1:09:34] simple but it made noah's life
[1:09:36] complicated
[1:09:38] because now noah has got to in the face
[1:09:41] of all kinds of opposition
[1:09:43] he's got to take what god told him and
[1:09:45] he's got to do the opposite of what
[1:09:47] culture is doing
[1:09:48] he's got to do the opposite of what
[1:09:50] science says is good
[1:09:52] science amen he's going to do the
[1:09:53] opposite of everything his generation
[1:09:56] his society his culture
[1:09:57] calls normal calls correct calls saying
[1:10:00] he's got to do
[1:10:01] different than all of that and no doubt
[1:10:04] but he dramatizes it many times but he
[1:10:06] goes through all kinds of ridicule
[1:10:08] scorning
[1:10:09] shaming amen all kinds of conflict and
[1:10:12] difficulty
[1:10:13] just to accomplish it and the fact that
[1:10:15] it was a lot of work
[1:10:18] that it was a lot of work that he
[1:10:21] actually
[1:10:22] labored at the commandment of god
[1:10:25] he labored to bring forth the
[1:10:27] commandment of god
[1:10:30] amen so it was simple what god's asked
[1:10:33] us to do today is simple but hard
[1:10:37] not complicated but can be complex
[1:10:41] we just have to obey him
[1:10:44] brother ben said in the message of god
[1:10:46] hiding himself in simplicity
[1:10:49] then revealing himself in the same and
[1:10:52] so you can imagine how education and
[1:10:54] science is such great
[1:10:56] of such great tokens that we have left
[1:10:58] that there was such a civilization he's
[1:11:00] talking about all the things that you
[1:11:01] can find left over
[1:11:03] what a great civilization that must be
[1:11:05] by these memorials how that science
[1:11:07] and modern civilization and education
[1:11:10] must
[1:11:11] was was a must with people they must be
[1:11:13] it had to be
[1:11:15] there was hardly any i guess any
[1:11:17] illiteracy among them at all
[1:11:19] and so god searching through the great
[1:11:21] economy at that day in their system
[1:11:23] could not perhaps
[1:11:24] find the right type of a man until he
[1:11:26] found an illiterate maybe farmer
[1:11:28] in the name of noah a sheepherder
[1:11:32] and he gave him his message to preach to
[1:11:33] the people that was so simple
[1:11:35] to the scholarship of that day until the
[1:11:37] people stumbled over the simplicity
[1:11:39] of the message
[1:11:42] you know i i thought it was interesting
[1:11:45] also in
[1:11:46] the acceptance speech of kamala harris
[1:11:48] and joe biden
[1:11:49] they both referenced science as a major
[1:11:52] guiding post for their agenda
[1:11:55] though as it was in the days of noah
[1:11:59] so shall it be science
[1:12:03] we're going to use sound science they
[1:12:05] said
[1:12:07] my goodness i have a uh i have a que i i
[1:12:11] have problems with that term
[1:12:13] sound science because if science is so
[1:12:16] sound why can't we use the same
[1:12:18] textbooks your granddad used in school
[1:12:21] why can't you go to college with your
[1:12:22] grandpa's chemistry book under your arm
[1:12:25] if science is so sound and so solid and
[1:12:29] so trustworthy
[1:12:31] why can't you use the curriculum from 20
[1:12:33] 30 40 years ago
[1:12:35] and go to school and pass the test you
[1:12:37] can use the same math book
[1:12:42] you can use the same history book you
[1:12:46] use the same
[1:12:46] engineering principles of course your
[1:12:50] history book wouldn't have the last 30
[1:12:51] years i mean
[1:12:54] but you see what i'm saying sound
[1:12:56] science that sounds science you put so
[1:12:58] much confidence it's
[1:12:59] constantly finding itself in error and
[1:13:02] changing its ideas
[1:13:04] and adjusting its theories and
[1:13:06] hypotheses and sometimes even
[1:13:08] reversing its conclusions
[1:13:11] and this was the day that noah lived in
[1:13:13] lowell lived in a super scientific day
[1:13:15] when everything was already figured out
[1:13:18] and no one began to take simply just
[1:13:20] simply take what god had told him
[1:13:22] and begin to share what god had told him
[1:13:24] and they began to laugh him to score him
[1:13:25] because he said water is going to fall
[1:13:27] from the sky
[1:13:28] and a thing called rain brother man said
[1:13:30] it had never rained on the earth before
[1:13:33] but i just want to make it clear just
[1:13:34] because you've never seen something
[1:13:36] happen before doesn't mean it can't
[1:13:38] happen
[1:13:42] and they they begin to say we can shoot
[1:13:45] the moon
[1:13:45] amen with a with a laser which they just
[1:13:48] did a few years ago
[1:13:50] again shot the moon with a laser to
[1:13:52] measure it
[1:13:54] we could shoot the moon with the laser
[1:13:56] amen and
[1:13:58] and we can tell there's no moisture up
[1:13:59] there i mean it doesn't matter whether
[1:14:01] there's moisture up there or not amen
[1:14:03] god knows how to put moisture up there
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:06] and all of their science they were
[1:14:08] taking only what they could see and what
[1:14:09] they know
[1:14:10] but they couldn't understand that god
[1:14:12] knew amen he knew how to disrupt the
[1:14:15] earth
[1:14:17] he knew what tilting in on its axis
[1:14:19] would do he knew if he threw it off the
[1:14:21] taxes and
[1:14:21] moved it slightly out of orbit he knew
[1:14:23] that that water would come
[1:14:25] bursting out of the fountains of the
[1:14:26] deed gush upon the water amen that there
[1:14:28] would be
[1:14:29] a great evaporation and condensation
[1:14:31] because
[1:14:32] now the earth tilted it's moved and now
[1:14:34] heating and cooling and
[1:14:35] he god knew exactly how to get water to
[1:14:38] fall from the sky
[1:14:40] and all the elements were right there
[1:14:42] amen even their scientific achievement
[1:14:44] of a nuclear blast that god needed to
[1:14:46] make it happen
[1:14:50] because brother branham said some great
[1:14:52] blast a nuclear blast or something
[1:14:53] knocked it off attacks and knocked it
[1:14:54] out
[1:14:55] out of kilter so
[1:14:58] god was using their own science amen to
[1:15:00] destroy themselves and man
[1:15:02] always destroys himself
[1:15:06] god told noah said i will destroy the
[1:15:08] earth i will destroy everything that
[1:15:10] breathes
[1:15:11] with the breath of life in his nostrils
[1:15:14] i will destroy it
[1:15:16] but how did god destroy it he allowed
[1:15:18] man to take a scientific achievement and
[1:15:20] the violence that was all over the earth
[1:15:22] and warfare that would break out and one
[1:15:24] would launch a bomb or multiple bombs or
[1:15:26] however many
[1:15:27] nuclear weapons on another and the blast
[1:15:29] would move the earth and knock it out of
[1:15:31] kilter
[1:15:31] amen and god said i will destroy and
[1:15:34] when god destroyed he just let man loose
[1:15:36] in his own laboratory
[1:15:38] and we know that there's coming a
[1:15:40] volcanic and atomic fire that's going to
[1:15:42] renovate this earth
[1:15:43] and god's going to do it he's going to
[1:15:45] renovate the earth but how he's going to
[1:15:46] renovate the earth i believe he's going
[1:15:48] to do it the same way he renovated back
[1:15:50] then
[1:15:50] he's going to let man who's come to all
[1:15:52] of his knowledge and all of his science
[1:15:54] and his lust for power and violence
[1:15:56] spread upon the earth and he's going to
[1:15:58] do the same thing
[1:15:59] he's going to let a nuclear holocaust
[1:16:00] break out that'll cause
[1:16:02] whatever volcanoes or whatever happens
[1:16:05] upon the earth
[1:16:07] man thinks he's so smart he's always
[1:16:10] defending himself
[1:16:12] and his defense is his destruction
[1:16:16] see you realize so many times god gives
[1:16:19] us a word and god puts us out on the
[1:16:21] front line
[1:16:22] and god it gives us something to say and
[1:16:24] somebody to say it to
[1:16:25] or a stand to take and so many times we
[1:16:27] back up and pedal back on that
[1:16:29] amen because we're trying to protect
[1:16:31] ourselves amen but the moment we go
[1:16:33] silence on the word the moment we stop
[1:16:35] obeying the word
[1:16:36] is the moment we're bringing our own
[1:16:38] death and destruction
[1:16:41] man and trying to defend himself will
[1:16:44] destroy himself
[1:16:45] man trying to protect himself you know
[1:16:48] because nuclear weapons are a deterrent
[1:16:50] against war
[1:16:54] how do we keep from having war will we
[1:16:56] just build bombs
[1:16:59] i mean it makes sense to me right we
[1:17:02] don't want war to break out
[1:17:03] so we're going to build a bomb a big one
[1:17:06] so they know if they do anything bad
[1:17:07] we'll blow them up
[1:17:10] so then this country over here for a
[1:17:11] deterrent from them using their bomb i'm
[1:17:13] going to build another bomb
[1:17:16] what is this peace
[1:17:21] this is how smart man is
[1:17:24] this is the wisdom this is the
[1:17:26] achievement of politics
[1:17:28] this is the politics of peace
[1:17:31] and god is going to use that wisdom
[1:17:33] right there
[1:17:35] to destroy man and renovate this planet
[1:17:37] for you and i
[1:17:41] see if anything i've learned from going
[1:17:44] back and diving into the book of genesis
[1:17:46] and spending time
[1:17:48] in here if anything i've learned is as
[1:17:50] it was in the days of noah so shall it
[1:17:52] be
[1:17:53] come in the son of man it's the same
[1:17:55] thing same spirit same
[1:17:56] attitudes same approaches same
[1:17:58] scientific achievements
[1:18:00] same reliance on man and what man can do
[1:18:03] same security that comes from politics
[1:18:05] economics
[1:18:07] science and we're in the same boat
[1:18:13] praise god praise god
[1:18:19] so as it was in the days of noah so
[1:18:21] shall it be also
[1:18:22] in the days of the son of man let's look
[1:18:25] at chapter 6
[1:18:26] 14.
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:33] i'm not going to get very far i'm just
[1:18:34] going to go into one more thing and i
[1:18:36] think we'll wrap it up today
[1:18:37] because i don't want to go into the next
[1:18:40] thing and i just feel the labor on this
[1:18:41] and
[1:18:42] then we'll stop genesis chapter 6
[1:18:45] verse 14.
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:50] make thee an ark of gopher wood room
[1:18:52] shout out making it
[1:18:54] in there excuse me and shall pitch it
[1:18:57] within
[1:18:58] and without with pitch and this is the
[1:19:01] fashion which thou shall make it of the
[1:19:03] length of the ark shall be
[1:19:04] 300 cubits the breath of it 50 cubits
[1:19:06] and the height of it 30 cubits
[1:19:08] a window shalt thou make to the ark and
[1:19:10] in the cubit shalt i'll finish it above
[1:19:12] and the door
[1:19:13] of the ark shall thou set in the side
[1:19:14] thereof with lower second and third
[1:19:17] story shalt thou make it
[1:19:20] so when god tells him the instructions
[1:19:22] he begins to tell him the dimensions and
[1:19:25] the rooms and the three levels and the
[1:19:27] window up top and the door and the side
[1:19:30] and we know that all of this is speaking
[1:19:32] salvation and all this is speaking of
[1:19:33] christ
[1:19:35] so noah may never have
[1:19:38] known what the door represents or the
[1:19:40] three levels represent
[1:19:42] he's just building it and it's serving a
[1:19:44] purpose in that day the door is the way
[1:19:46] by which they'll enter in amen
[1:19:48] and when they enter in then they'll be
[1:19:50] three levels for the animals and
[1:19:52] up top there'll be a window up in the
[1:19:53] top of the ark and
[1:19:55] and all of that served a function all of
[1:19:56] that served a purpose and
[1:19:58] if you realized amen what god was trying
[1:20:01] to accomplish
[1:20:02] amen in in the salvation of man
[1:20:06] he's showing a picture of the salvation
[1:20:09] of man
[1:20:11] what he will do to save man and he's
[1:20:13] showing it here because the ark is a
[1:20:15] type of christ and christ is the only
[1:20:17] ark that you can go into and be safe
[1:20:21] and i just i'll labor on this and if the
[1:20:24] children could pay attention you know
[1:20:25] to understand that this arc is more than
[1:20:28] just
[1:20:28] a cue story about animals and they all
[1:20:31] show up and they go in the ark but
[1:20:32] but god is actually showing our
[1:20:34] salvation in that salvation
[1:20:36] that salvation is a foreshadow of our
[1:20:38] salvation
[1:20:40] and god he told him he said make a door
[1:20:42] and he told him to only make one door
[1:20:44] because we know the scripture says that
[1:20:46] there is only one way to enter in
[1:20:48] into life and jesus christ is the door
[1:20:52] he is the door he's the only door so
[1:20:55] this ark this way of salvation this plan
[1:20:57] of salvation
[1:20:58] amen in the day when scientific
[1:21:00] achievement was at its height and
[1:21:02] the earth was filled with violence and
[1:21:03] all flesh had corrupted himself
[1:21:05] the only way of salvation was through
[1:21:07] the door
[1:21:09] and that door is jesus christ it's just
[1:21:12] as true today as it was in noah's day
[1:21:15] that if you want to be saved from the
[1:21:16] wrath of god you've got to go through
[1:21:18] the door
[1:21:20] and jesus christ is the door and jesus
[1:21:23] christ is the word of god
[1:21:24] he is the anointed word of god the
[1:21:27] anointed word of god is the word that's
[1:21:29] anointed for this day
[1:21:31] and the only way to enter in is through
[1:21:33] the word amen the word that's given us
[1:21:35] in this day
[1:21:37] we enter into the ark and then it's no
[1:21:40] coincidence that there's three levels to
[1:21:41] the ark
[1:21:42] because once you enter in you've got to
[1:21:44] go through justification
[1:21:46] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:21:48] holy ghost
[1:21:50] and so you know these aren't stories for
[1:21:54] sunday school
[1:21:55] and that just is a cue story to pique
[1:21:57] the kids interest about animals
[1:21:59] but god was showing us that if there's
[1:22:01] going to be salvation this is my method
[1:22:03] for salvation
[1:22:04] the method for salvation is coming in
[1:22:06] through a single door
[1:22:08] amen and working your way up from one
[1:22:10] level to another level to another level
[1:22:12] till you get to the very source of life
[1:22:14] at the top
[1:22:15] and that is the light itself the person
[1:22:17] of the word
[1:22:23] excuse me
[1:22:26] brother bam said so it is at our ark
[1:22:29] jesus christ god opened the door for us
[1:22:31] on calvary
[1:22:32] he'll close it just as sure as he opened
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:36] john 10 7. we know this but i want to
[1:22:38] read the scripture in this context
[1:22:40] john 10 7 jesus said unto them verily
[1:22:44] verily i say unto you i am the door the
[1:22:46] sheep
[1:22:47] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:22:49] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[1:22:51] them i am the door
[1:22:52] by me if any man enters in he shall be
[1:22:55] saved
[1:22:56] and she'll go in and out and find
[1:22:58] pasture
[1:23:04] brother rem says in the seventh seal it
[1:23:07] says the kingdom of god is coming and
[1:23:08] it's becoming more from negative to
[1:23:10] positive as it
[1:23:11] has been now that ought to choke people
[1:23:13] from justification to sanctification
[1:23:16] to the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:23:18] then here
[1:23:20] so brother brahma is showing us that
[1:23:22] that through salvation he comes through
[1:23:23] luther justification wesley
[1:23:25] sanctification uh
[1:23:26] the pentecostals and the baptism the
[1:23:28] holy ghost but to hear to the person of
[1:23:30] the word to the place we've arrived to
[1:23:32] here
[1:23:33] and we know that that if we go all all
[1:23:35] the way over to revelation chapter three
[1:23:38] at the end of the literacy and church
[1:23:39] age and move into chapter four
[1:23:41] i mean we've come through luther's age
[1:23:42] wesley's age pentecostal age
[1:23:45] but then when he gets there there's an
[1:23:47] open door in heaven
[1:23:49] and in the ark there's an open window in
[1:23:52] the top of the ark
[1:23:53] amen you come in through christ
[1:23:56] you come in through justification
[1:23:58] sanctification baptism holy ghost
[1:24:00] but you enter the heavenlies from above
[1:24:04] the door to the rapture's been opened
[1:24:05] the source of light is revealed
[1:24:07] the heavenlies are on display through
[1:24:10] this open door
[1:24:12] so god excuse me
[1:24:15] is typing this with us even here today
[1:24:20] he's made it simple but in simplicity
[1:24:22] he's hid it from the wise
[1:24:24] from the wisdom of the wise
[1:24:33] i want to go on
[1:24:36] he says when he made this ark
[1:24:39] he pitched it he sealed it inside on the
[1:24:43] inside
[1:24:44] and on the outside i think that's super
[1:24:47] interesting
[1:24:48] and brother venom will take that
[1:24:49] pitching of the seal and they'll type it
[1:24:50] with christians and it'll say
[1:24:51] that they took another tree and they
[1:24:53] took that tree and
[1:24:54] they would beat it down and take the
[1:24:56] resin out of that tree and they would
[1:24:57] pour it into this gopher wood and gopher
[1:24:59] wood was really porous wood
[1:25:00] and he said it wasn't good wood to build
[1:25:02] with and he said it would sink if you
[1:25:03] put it out there would soak up the water
[1:25:05] but the way it would float is if it was
[1:25:07] filled amen with this resin from this
[1:25:09] other tree
[1:25:10] so christ was the tree that was cut down
[1:25:13] and beat and his life came out
[1:25:14] that would pour in us and he says go he
[1:25:16] said christians
[1:25:17] are absorbent to the holy ghost
[1:25:20] they're special trees that are made to
[1:25:23] be in this art special trees
[1:25:25] that are worthless and no good for
[1:25:27] salvation no good for floating in heart
[1:25:29] no good for building with until the
[1:25:31] resin of the holy ghost comes in
[1:25:33] and when it comes in he says it becomes
[1:25:35] hard as a rock
[1:25:38] and so god he's typing us with this but
[1:25:40] i think it's also another interesting
[1:25:42] type that lays here that he pitched it
[1:25:44] on the inside
[1:25:45] and on the outside because if you go to
[1:25:47] the seals you realize brother benham
[1:25:49] starts talking
[1:25:50] about the seven seals on the inside of
[1:25:52] the book but there's seals on the
[1:25:53] outside
[1:25:54] of the book because this plan of
[1:25:55] salvation is sealed on the inside and
[1:25:57] the outside
[1:25:59] there's two seals on the inside and the
[1:26:01] outside there's the seals that were
[1:26:03] revealed
[1:26:03] in revelation chapter six is the symbols
[1:26:05] but there's also the thunders that have
[1:26:07] been sealed up which brother bram says
[1:26:09] is on the backside
[1:26:11] on the outside
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:14] and so this ark is just an amazing
[1:26:20] ark
[1:26:26] oh i just i just want to hit one other
[1:26:28] point i don't want to spend any
[1:26:30] any more time there's a lot of things we
[1:26:31] could go into but
[1:26:34] but it's amazing that
[1:26:38] there's a seal on the inside and outside
[1:26:40] and the seal like we spoke before
[1:26:42] is to preserve it's pitched on the
[1:26:45] inside and outside
[1:26:46] it's to preserve it's to strengthen it's
[1:26:48] to hold the thing in place amen
[1:26:51] and and the word has been preserved and
[1:26:53] we've been preserved by the word and by
[1:26:54] the life of the word
[1:26:56] and we went from useless material
[1:27:00] to the bride now is a very arc
[1:27:04] she's holding the word she's holding the
[1:27:06] door she's standing in the door of the
[1:27:07] ark
[1:27:08] amen building on this ark by by what by
[1:27:11] working in the word by laboring in the
[1:27:12] word
[1:27:13] she's holding the door open there's an
[1:27:15] ark on earth amen
[1:27:16] and she's went from being useless amen
[1:27:19] to being
[1:27:19] being part of a very arc of safety
[1:27:23] holding the door open standing in the
[1:27:25] door calling to them what did it
[1:27:27] it was the very life of jesus christ
[1:27:29] that has come back into these vessels
[1:27:31] amen that were nothing that were dead
[1:27:33] we're as good as dead
[1:27:34] amen where we're not fit and sufficient
[1:27:37] for salvation
[1:27:39] but he poured his life into the bride
[1:27:42] amen and now she's become
[1:27:43] a place of safety
[1:27:48] but i want to finish up with this
[1:27:49] thought
[1:27:51] on the raven in the dove if you could go
[1:27:55] with me to genesis chapter 8.
[1:28:00] verse four and i heard a brother i had a
[1:28:04] little bit of fellowship with the
[1:28:05] brother
[1:28:05] in south carolina and he was talking
[1:28:07] about this and i was just
[1:28:09] fascinated by it i've been looking at it
[1:28:13] in genesis 8 and 4
[1:28:17] it said and the ark rested in the
[1:28:19] seventh month on the seventh day of the
[1:28:21] month upon the mountain of
[1:28:23] ararat so the ark had been floating
[1:28:27] yeah you know it'd been rain 40 days and
[1:28:29] 40 nights they went into the ark seven
[1:28:30] days before
[1:28:31] and god shut the door and the fountains
[1:28:33] of the deep broke open and the heavens
[1:28:35] open and it began to rain and
[1:28:37] and and so you know many people believe
[1:28:39] that they were in the ark 40 days and 40
[1:28:41] nights but
[1:28:42] really when you read the scriptures they
[1:28:43] were in the ark just a little over a
[1:28:45] year
[1:28:46] they were in the ark for the rain then
[1:28:48] the waters on the face of the earth
[1:28:49] and the time for the waters to abate and
[1:28:51] then noah wait 40 days and he sent out a
[1:28:53] raven and he sent out
[1:28:54] a dove and then the dove came back he
[1:28:57] waited seven days in it more
[1:28:58] and by the time it's all said and done
[1:29:00] it's about 370 some days
[1:29:03] that they're actually in the ark and
[1:29:06] then
[1:29:07] let's keep reading here the ark rested
[1:29:10] on the seventh month they come to rest
[1:29:12] on top of the mountain
[1:29:15] and the waters decreased continually
[1:29:17] until the tenth month
[1:29:18] and then the tenth month and the first
[1:29:20] day of the month were the tops
[1:29:21] of the mountain scene and it came to
[1:29:24] pass at the end of 40 days that noah
[1:29:25] opened the window of the ark
[1:29:27] which he had made and he sent forth a
[1:29:29] raven which went forth to and fro until
[1:29:31] the waters were dried up from off the
[1:29:33] earth
[1:29:34] also he sent forth a dove from him to
[1:29:37] see if the waters were abated from off
[1:29:39] the face of
[1:29:40] the ground but the dove found no rest
[1:29:43] for the soul of her foot
[1:29:44] and she returned unto him into the ark
[1:29:46] for the waters were on the face of the
[1:29:48] whole earth
[1:29:49] then he put forth his hand and took her
[1:29:51] and pulled her and pulled her
[1:29:53] in unto him in the ark and he stayed yet
[1:29:56] another seven days and again
[1:29:58] excuse me he sent forth the dove out of
[1:30:00] the ark
[1:30:01] and the dove came into him in the
[1:30:03] evening and low and her mouth was an
[1:30:05] olive leaf plucked off
[1:30:06] so no one knew that the waters were
[1:30:08] abated from off the earth
[1:30:10] and he stayed yet another seven days and
[1:30:12] sent forth the dove
[1:30:13] which returned not again unto him
[1:30:15] anymore and it came to pass in the 601st
[1:30:18] year in the first month
[1:30:19] the first day of the month the waters
[1:30:21] were dried up from off the earth and
[1:30:22] noah removed the covering of the ark
[1:30:25] and looked and behold the face of the
[1:30:27] ground was dry
[1:30:29] and in the second month on the seventh
[1:30:30] and twentieth day of the month
[1:30:32] was the earth dried and god's speaking
[1:30:34] to noah saying go forth of the ark thou
[1:30:37] my wife my sons my son's wives with thee
[1:30:42] so we look at this i want to just look
[1:30:43] at the raven and the dove
[1:30:45] because brother branham in the
[1:30:46] scriptures all the time will use these
[1:30:49] birds as
[1:30:50] spirits symbols of spirits and we know
[1:30:52] the dove was a great symbol of the holy
[1:30:54] spirit and the raven
[1:30:55] is a great dove of the representative of
[1:30:57] the antichrist spirit
[1:30:59] and noah at the end of the destruction
[1:31:01] when the destruction is coming to an end
[1:31:03] amen he sends out of the window amen
[1:31:06] two birds he sends out a raven and he
[1:31:09] sends out a dove
[1:31:10] and the whole interaction between the
[1:31:12] two is very interesting and brother ben
[1:31:13] has a lot of things to say but he says
[1:31:17] the that raven brother tells us now that
[1:31:20] raven could go and eat on dead carrion
[1:31:23] all those dead bodies that were
[1:31:24] destroyed in the destruction when god
[1:31:26] overthrew man
[1:31:27] he could feast on all of that he can go
[1:31:29] to and fro and back and forth and
[1:31:32] i mean it was no problem for him but
[1:31:34] when the dove went out of the ark amen
[1:31:36] she found no place to put the sole of
[1:31:39] her feet
[1:31:40] she couldn't rest on the dead bodies she
[1:31:43] couldn't rest on the
[1:31:44] dead on the judge amen she had to look
[1:31:46] for something else
[1:31:47] she had to look for something with life
[1:31:49] or potential for life in it
[1:31:51] he said the dove can only eat the seed
[1:31:53] the wheat seed amen but a crow is a
[1:31:55] hypocrite can eat both it can
[1:31:57] it can feed with the dove like a dove
[1:31:59] and be in church and it can feed with
[1:32:00] the world like the worldly amen
[1:32:02] is that it's a hypocrite bird a
[1:32:03] hypocrite spirit and so the
[1:32:05] the crow goes out of the window and the
[1:32:08] crow finds plenty of places to rest her
[1:32:10] feet
[1:32:12] right and plenty of substance
[1:32:16] out there on the dead bodies
[1:32:20] and brother branham says the message i
[1:32:22] will restore from 54
[1:32:24] now look at the vine grow up it started
[1:32:26] right there on these two spirits from
[1:32:28] these boys that come on down
[1:32:29] pro and con starting about cain and abel
[1:32:32] down through the bible even in the ark
[1:32:34] there was a dove and a raven sitting on
[1:32:35] the same roof
[1:32:37] the dove can say i could fly raven says
[1:32:39] i can too one could call the other one
[1:32:41] could too
[1:32:42] noah turned one loose and he was
[1:32:44] satisfied the raven fly on those old
[1:32:46] dead bodies and eat but when he turned
[1:32:48] the dove loose
[1:32:49] she could find no rest for the soles of
[1:32:51] her feet and she came back and
[1:32:53] knocked on the door to get in
[1:32:56] i thought the the terminology that we
[1:32:58] have here is interesting and
[1:33:00] the symbol i'd say the symbology to me
[1:33:02] is fascinating
[1:33:04] because two spirits go forth if you just
[1:33:06] stick with me this way two spirits go
[1:33:08] forth the holy spirit
[1:33:09] in an unholy spirit they go
[1:33:12] forth but the holy spirit can find no
[1:33:15] place
[1:33:16] to rest her feet but the raven is
[1:33:18] satisfied with what the raven finds and
[1:33:21] the raven can go back and forth to and
[1:33:22] fro
[1:33:23] and be completely satisfied with what
[1:33:25] the raven finds
[1:33:27] and this this terminology to and fro
[1:33:29] reminded me of job chapter 1 verse 7
[1:33:32] when the sons of god presented
[1:33:33] themselves into unto god that came
[1:33:35] before him and satan came also
[1:33:38] and he said and the lord said unto satan
[1:33:40] whence cometh thou
[1:33:41] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:33:43] from going to and fro in the earth and
[1:33:45] from walking up and down in it
[1:33:47] so satan had been sent out of heaven and
[1:33:49] had been cast out of heaven
[1:33:51] and he was going to and fro and he come
[1:33:54] back to
[1:33:55] the presence of god and god said where
[1:33:57] have you been he goes i've been going to
[1:33:58] and fro
[1:33:59] and all the earth because he's satisfied
[1:34:02] with what he finds on the earth
[1:34:05] just like this raven spirit goes out and
[1:34:07] satisfied
[1:34:08] with the dead bodies of those that have
[1:34:11] been judged
[1:34:13] and if i could if you could just stick
[1:34:15] with me in my analogy and then
[1:34:16] the typology and we could look at this
[1:34:18] maybe with with
[1:34:20] spiritual eyes
[1:34:25] after judgment when man is judged you
[1:34:28] know god
[1:34:29] two spirits come out because satan was
[1:34:32] overthrown he was cast down to earth and
[1:34:35] he come to earth and he corrupted
[1:34:37] earth and the judgment set in upon man
[1:34:41] amen and man now is under the wrath of
[1:34:44] god
[1:34:44] and two spirits had gone out and one
[1:34:47] spirit
[1:34:48] found a place amen because the scripture
[1:34:50] says that we were all dead in sin and
[1:34:52] trespasses
[1:34:54] we were all dead amen and actually i
[1:34:56] want to read this scripture together
[1:34:58] let's go to ephesians chapter 2.
[1:35:00] i want you to catch my thinking in the
[1:35:03] context of where i'm coming from
[1:35:07] ephesians chapter 2 and i'll start with
[1:35:10] verse 1.
[1:35:18] ephesians chapter 2 and 1 and you hath
[1:35:21] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:35:23] and sin
[1:35:24] so you start this life dead you start
[1:35:28] this life in judgment
[1:35:29] and brother branham actually will begin
[1:35:31] to to type us from the first destruction
[1:35:34] of the world all the way back in genesis
[1:35:36] 1
[1:35:36] chapter 1 verse 2 when water covered the
[1:35:39] face of the deep but there were seeds
[1:35:40] down inside that was the first judgment
[1:35:42] by a flood
[1:35:43] and brother bennett even types us with
[1:35:45] that that your soul is covered over with
[1:35:47] water
[1:35:47] darkness covers the deep but god has to
[1:35:49] bring the light to penetrate it the
[1:35:51] light moves back the water
[1:35:52] the light hits the seed and the seed
[1:35:54] comes forth he's even typing
[1:35:56] our new birth typing us from coming from
[1:35:57] a phase of destruction
[1:35:59] to coming to new life so
[1:36:03] he's typing that and here he says we
[1:36:04] were we were we were dead in trespasses
[1:36:07] and we started off dead
[1:36:09] we started off judged like the earth was
[1:36:11] judged we started off
[1:36:13] shrouded in darkness with no form and
[1:36:15] void and darkness cover the face of our
[1:36:17] deep
[1:36:19] he said where in time passed you walked
[1:36:20] according to the course of this world
[1:36:22] according
[1:36:22] to the prince of the power of the air
[1:36:25] she walked according to this spirit
[1:36:28] this raven spirit according to the
[1:36:31] prince of the power of the air the
[1:36:32] spirit that now worketh
[1:36:34] in the children of disobedience among
[1:36:36] whom also we all had our conversation in
[1:36:38] times past in the lust of our flesh
[1:36:40] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:36:42] of the mind and we're by nature
[1:36:45] the children of wrath even as others
[1:36:48] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:36:51] great love or with he loved us
[1:36:53] even when we were dead and sins hath
[1:36:55] quickened us together with christ
[1:36:56] by grace ye are saved
[1:37:00] so the raven and the dove go forth
[1:37:05] and everything's let me say it this way
[1:37:07] everything's spiritually dead
[1:37:11] spiritual death is crept in
[1:37:14] and the raven is satisfied with this
[1:37:17] environment
[1:37:19] the raven can go to or for over the face
[1:37:21] of the earth
[1:37:22] fly about and be be filled and be
[1:37:24] satisfied and brother ben said he was
[1:37:26] out there just a glutton
[1:37:29] plenty to feed on plenty to satisfy his
[1:37:32] desires
[1:37:34] but the dove of the holy ghost is
[1:37:37] out here over the judgment just follow
[1:37:40] me
[1:37:41] over the judgment and that dove has no
[1:37:44] place to put her feet
[1:37:46] can fly over can move around can observe
[1:37:49] but no place to put her feet so noah
[1:37:53] takes the dove back in
[1:37:56] and noah waits seven days
[1:38:00] now brother branham says there's been a
[1:38:02] seventh-day
[1:38:03] sabbath for the old testament and a
[1:38:04] sabbath for the new testament
[1:38:07] so i want you to look at this is seven
[1:38:08] day old testament seven day new
[1:38:10] and there's been a sabbath for the old
[1:38:11] testament after seven days he sends her
[1:38:14] back out again
[1:38:15] and then when he sends her back out
[1:38:17] again remember the first time she found
[1:38:19] no
[1:38:19] everything was spiritually dead
[1:38:21] everything was under the judgment
[1:38:23] and then she could find no place to set
[1:38:25] her feet but this time when she was sent
[1:38:28] out
[1:38:28] amen after seven days she came back with
[1:38:31] a hot
[1:38:31] with an olive leaf i kept calling it
[1:38:34] holly leaf during devotions and the kids
[1:38:36] kept laughing at me
[1:38:38] they told me i better be careful if i
[1:38:39] preached this if i say holly leaf from
[1:38:42] here on out i mean olive leaf
[1:38:44] there that's my disclaimer come back in
[1:38:47] with an olive leaf in her mouth
[1:38:49] amen which means that the that the holy
[1:38:51] ghost had found a place that she could
[1:38:54] rest upon and where did he find that
[1:38:56] place in the jordan river amen when the
[1:38:58] holy ghost descended like a dove
[1:39:00] and rested upon jesus christ
[1:39:04] now there was something amen coming out
[1:39:06] of the destruction there was something
[1:39:08] not just something that come out of
[1:39:10] destruction but something that was going
[1:39:12] to be pre-peace upon the earth
[1:39:14] because the holy ghost when returned to
[1:39:15] noah returned with an olive leaf in her
[1:39:17] mouth brother brahm said
[1:39:18] see a symbol of peace now there was
[1:39:21] peace coming upon the earth
[1:39:25] so after the the first one
[1:39:28] went forth
[1:39:31] she could find no rest and after seven
[1:39:33] days she went out again
[1:39:37] and this time she found a place to come
[1:39:39] down
[1:39:40] matthew 3 16 it says in jesus when he
[1:39:43] was baptized went up straight way out of
[1:39:44] the water
[1:39:45] and lo the heavens were opened unto him
[1:39:47] and he saw the spirit of god descend
[1:39:48] like a dove and lighting upon him
[1:39:51] and lo a voice from heaven saying this
[1:39:53] is my beloved son in whom
[1:39:55] i am well pleased
[1:39:58] so the dove lighted the dove had a place
[1:40:01] to set her feet now
[1:40:04] upon the earth this portion that was
[1:40:07] this tree
[1:40:08] it was the tree of life but this tree of
[1:40:11] life who was going to be nailed to a
[1:40:12] roman tree
[1:40:13] it meant so that you come back with an
[1:40:15] olive leaf a token of peace
[1:40:17] and return back and say there's now
[1:40:19] peace on the earth
[1:40:21] and john 1 32 says and john bear records
[1:40:24] saying i saw the spirit descend from
[1:40:26] heaven like a dove
[1:40:27] and it abode upon him and i knew him not
[1:40:30] but he that sent me the baptized water
[1:40:32] the same said unto me
[1:40:33] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:40:35] descending and remaining on him
[1:40:38] the same is he which baptized with the
[1:40:41] holy ghost
[1:40:42] so now now in the destruction
[1:40:46] the earth is the earth is under
[1:40:48] destruction it's under judgment but now
[1:40:49] under the judgment the holy ghost has
[1:40:51] come out after seven days
[1:40:53] and it's returned with an olive leaf
[1:40:55] there's now peace
[1:40:57] the price has been paid peace is coming
[1:41:02] but i want to look at the third time
[1:41:05] because it comes back in
[1:41:06] and then another seven days he sends it
[1:41:08] out a third time
[1:41:12] and let's read that together let's go
[1:41:15] back to genesis
[1:41:19] chapter 8
[1:41:27] genesis chapter 8 verse 11
[1:41:31] and the dove came into him in the
[1:41:34] evening and low in her mouth was an
[1:41:35] olive leaf plucked off
[1:41:37] so no one knew that the waters were
[1:41:39] abated from off the earth
[1:41:40] and he stayed yet other seven days and
[1:41:43] sent forth the dove
[1:41:44] which returned not again unto him
[1:41:48] any more
[1:41:51] there's coming a time in the redemption
[1:41:54] the
[1:41:54] end of the cycle of of judgment and
[1:41:57] destruction
[1:41:58] when judgment is being abated and it's
[1:42:00] and it's coming back
[1:42:01] to what god intended and he's preserving
[1:42:04] life there come a time where
[1:42:05] the the the the holy ghost could find no
[1:42:09] tree to rest upon until the tree of life
[1:42:11] came in jesus christ
[1:42:13] could rest on that tree and bring peace
[1:42:15] a token of peace back because now
[1:42:17] that tree paid the price for our peace
[1:42:20] but there's coming a time where the holy
[1:42:22] ghost is sent out again
[1:42:24] at the end of the new testament and when
[1:42:27] that holy ghost is set on again
[1:42:30] it doesn't come back anymore
[1:42:34] what was that dove looking for a place
[1:42:37] to rest her feet
[1:42:39] amen and god his whole goal was always
[1:42:42] to dwell among his people
[1:42:44] his goal was to dwell with his people
[1:42:46] amen but the curse had separated us from
[1:42:48] that
[1:42:48] and he paid the price he gave the the
[1:42:51] token of his life and he paid the price
[1:42:53] so that the the holy ghost would come
[1:42:55] out again and rest upon jesus christ and
[1:42:57] bring peace upon the earth amen and the
[1:42:59] holy ghost came on the day of pentecost
[1:43:01] to rest upon the people but they left
[1:43:03] the word
[1:43:05] but there's going to come a time at the
[1:43:07] end of seven days when the holy ghost
[1:43:09] comes out
[1:43:09] when it will be by the by the preaching
[1:43:11] of the end time message amen that the
[1:43:13] holy ghost will come back
[1:43:15] in the church again and now not to come
[1:43:17] back to return to come back and return
[1:43:19] because the plan is filled now
[1:43:20] the plan is finished now the purpose the
[1:43:23] intent amen was their god to dwell
[1:43:25] among his people and we live in that day
[1:43:29] friends when the holy ghost has come
[1:43:32] in the full measure by the opening of
[1:43:33] the seals it's come at the end of
[1:43:35] destruction it's come
[1:43:37] for new life come not to return again
[1:43:41] come not back and forth but we're at the
[1:43:43] end of the last seven days
[1:43:45] the last cycle and the holy ghost has
[1:43:48] come back
[1:43:49] the lord jesus christ has returned in
[1:43:51] the full measure of the word return in
[1:43:52] the form of the holy ghost
[1:43:53] the person of the holy ghost has come
[1:43:55] back to what to unite with you and i
[1:43:59] and god showed all the way back in the
[1:44:01] ark and the simplicity of abraham or
[1:44:03] implicity of noah sitting on a dove
[1:44:05] sitting on a raven coming back going
[1:44:07] back
[1:44:08] he was just a shepherd he was just a
[1:44:10] farmer
[1:44:11] but he was showing we come through the
[1:44:14] door
[1:44:14] we go through justification
[1:44:16] sanctification bats and the lord goes to
[1:44:17] the doorway to heaven
[1:44:19] there's been two spirits working at the
[1:44:21] destruction of man
[1:44:23] two spirits working one couldn't find a
[1:44:25] place and then jesus christ came and
[1:44:27] could find a place to rest her feet
[1:44:29] but now at the restoration of the word
[1:44:31] now
[1:44:33] the land becoming clear the water's
[1:44:35] drying up amen the curse coming to an
[1:44:38] end
[1:44:39] now the holy ghost can come out and now
[1:44:42] it's christ in you
[1:44:44] the hope of glory this has been god's
[1:44:47] great plan this has been god's great
[1:44:49] goal
[1:44:51] that dove now lives in you and i
[1:45:00] brother brahms said in the feast of
[1:45:02] trump this is the message i was alluding
[1:45:04] to
[1:45:05] the holy spirit has been bound by the
[1:45:06] denominational rivers for almost 2
[1:45:08] 000 years but is to be loosed in the
[1:45:11] evening time
[1:45:12] by the evening time message the holy
[1:45:15] spirit
[1:45:16] back in the church again christ himself
[1:45:19] revealed in human flesh
[1:45:20] in the evening time he said he promised
[1:45:25] now let's look at genesis 8
[1:45:28] and 13. right after that
[1:45:32] said and it came to pass in the 601st
[1:45:34] year
[1:45:35] in the first month the first day of the
[1:45:38] month
[1:45:39] the waters were dried up from off the
[1:45:40] earth and noah removed
[1:45:43] the covering of the ark and looked and
[1:45:45] behold the face of the ground was dry
[1:45:49] after all that finally
[1:45:52] noah removes the covering of the ark and
[1:45:55] i tell you friends at the end time the
[1:45:57] covering has been taken off of our ark
[1:45:59] so that we can see we can see all about
[1:46:02] him we see who we are and what he's been
[1:46:03] doing what he's been doing through the
[1:46:05] old testament what he's been doing
[1:46:06] through the
[1:46:06] two new testament how he's been saving
[1:46:08] how he's been redeeming how he's
[1:46:09] preserved life
[1:46:10] how it's all happened now he takes the
[1:46:12] covering off the ark
[1:46:14] and we can see and the next thing that
[1:46:18] happens
[1:46:20] after all of that is known as family go
[1:46:23] out into a bright new world
[1:46:25] a purged world a clean world a fresh
[1:46:29] world
[1:46:29] perched from sin perched from
[1:46:31] destruction perched from the once of man
[1:46:33] and friends we've been all the way
[1:46:35] through this journey but now it's time
[1:46:37] we've come to the time the covering's
[1:46:39] been taken off the ark the holy ghost
[1:46:40] has come back into the church the
[1:46:42] coverings taken off the ark
[1:46:43] and now it's time for us to step into a
[1:46:45] bright new world
[1:46:47] not burn over by water but burn over by
[1:46:50] fire
[1:46:52] noah a great prophet
[1:46:56] told us all these things but we didn't
[1:46:59] know what it meant
[1:47:00] until another great prophet come along
[1:47:02] and showed us the story within the story
[1:47:05] the great story the great story that all
[1:47:07] stories are telling
[1:47:08] all stories match this story this story
[1:47:10] interprets all stories
[1:47:11] this great story is the unlocking of the
[1:47:13] bible
[1:47:14] and now we can see we don't have to be
[1:47:17] smart
[1:47:19] we don't have to be geniuses friends
[1:47:21] let's all stand
[1:47:23] musicians if you want to come
[1:47:26] we don't have to figure anything out
[1:47:28] noah to lay down
[1:47:30] such a beautiful type that will mean so
[1:47:32] much for us in this day
[1:47:33] noah didn't have to figure anything out
[1:47:34] he didn't have to be exceptionally
[1:47:36] bright
[1:47:36] brother branham said he could have been
[1:47:38] illiterate
[1:47:41] but all he had to do was obey the word
[1:47:43] and we here who are in the fulfillment
[1:47:45] of
[1:47:46] all of these types all of these shadows
[1:47:48] all of these types come into fulfillment
[1:47:50] what do we have to do do we have to
[1:47:52] figure him out
[1:47:53] do we have to understand do we have to
[1:47:55] have
[1:47:56] degrees and comprehension and know what
[1:47:59] god's doing
[1:48:00] we don't have to understand friends all
[1:48:01] we have to do is believe and obey
[1:48:05] and then just like these shadows and
[1:48:07] times get clearer and clearer
[1:48:08] if we'll just accept believe obey leave
[1:48:11] it the way the prophet said it
[1:48:12] not not manipulate it not change it not
[1:48:16] try to get
[1:48:16] gain out of it not try to get personal
[1:48:18] praise out of it but just leave it the
[1:48:20] way it is
[1:48:20] be a humble shepherd a sheep herder
[1:48:24] believe it and leave it the way it is
[1:48:26] then all of a sudden you can look back
[1:48:27] and say aha
[1:48:29] aha aha aha
[1:48:32] i get it i see it
[1:48:35] i know what god's doing and when it
[1:48:37] happens that way
[1:48:39] who gets all the credit for it god does
[1:48:44] i say we live in a strange time
[1:48:49] but i say we live in a good time
[1:48:53] i say like jesus said to his disciples
[1:48:55] many prophets
[1:48:57] and righteous men desired to see the
[1:49:00] things you see and hear the things you
[1:49:02] hear
[1:49:05] they had it in types they had in shadows
[1:49:07] they knew it was pointing to something
[1:49:08] else
[1:49:09] but what it pointed to they couldn't
[1:49:11] figure out they couldn't grasp it
[1:49:12] amen and we're living in the day when
[1:49:14] the shadows and types are graspable
[1:49:17] they're unfolding before our eyes we're
[1:49:19] looking back and saying aha
[1:49:21] that's what it was aha that's what it
[1:49:23] was
[1:49:24] and now the very things that the prophet
[1:49:26] of god has said 50
[1:49:27] 60 65 70 years ago that you just scratch
[1:49:31] your head
[1:49:31] we're coming to the time where we're
[1:49:33] looking and saying aha
[1:49:34] aha that's what it was
[1:49:38] and god's going to continue to do that
[1:49:40] friends but he's going to do it with the
[1:49:41] same kind of people he's always used
[1:49:44] ignorant unlearned
[1:49:48] sheepherders now don't go dropping out
[1:49:50] of school
[1:49:53] brother bram said you need an education
[1:49:54] to live in this life
[1:49:56] but what i mean is you don't need to
[1:49:58] have your spiritual
[1:50:00] intellectual humanistic revelation
[1:50:04] understanding teaching a man-made doctor
[1:50:07] you don't have to figure it out
[1:50:09] you don't have to figure it out anymore
[1:50:10] noah figured out all you got to do is
[1:50:11] believe and say god
[1:50:12] i believe that word your prophet said he
[1:50:16] meant and it's coming to pass
[1:50:18] i see stuff i don't understand but i'm
[1:50:20] going to wait on you
[1:50:21] to interpret your word by bringing it to
[1:50:24] pass
[1:50:26] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:50:29] lord jesus we thank you we thank you god
[1:50:32] for a word that's so
[1:50:34] true and so right so
[1:50:37] solid lorn god when everything around us
[1:50:40] is shifting
[1:50:42] the modern thinking the trends
[1:50:45] understandings and teachings and things
[1:50:48] that have seemed
[1:50:49] solid lord for generations are now very
[1:50:51] flexible lord
[1:50:53] moral ideas and even the
[1:50:56] rule of law and order things that in the
[1:50:59] natural
[1:51:00] in this united states that seem so fixed
[1:51:02] and so
[1:51:03] certain are now so uncertain lord
[1:51:07] and god i pray that you'd give us the
[1:51:09] capacity
[1:51:10] to get our eyes off of the earth and
[1:51:13] back on you lord
[1:51:15] that we wouldn't be taken uh and
[1:51:18] distracted by all of these things lord
[1:51:20] you rise up and you tear down you
[1:51:23] appoint and you place
[1:51:25] you move lord you do as you wish and we
[1:51:27] rejoice in all that you do

[1:51:36] you
[1:51:37] work a miracle as you work your word and
[1:51:39] you unfold your word
[1:51:41] and you pull surprises and you take
[1:51:42] turns we never expected
[1:51:44] but we want to say lord we love you for
[1:51:46] it because only you can do this
[1:51:50] help us lord to be like noah lord and
[1:51:52] all the prophets of old
[1:51:54] they didn't have to know everything to
[1:51:57] obey
[1:51:58] they didn't have to be able to answer
[1:52:00] every question to believe
[1:52:02] lord your prophet dramatizes and tells
[1:52:05] us noah had so many questions from the
[1:52:07] scientific community
[1:52:08] and all those that were around him so
[1:52:10] many questions he couldn't answer
[1:52:12] so many evidences and proofs that they
[1:52:15] would show to him and
[1:52:16] they would have data and they would have
[1:52:18] charts maybe and
[1:52:19] and perhaps they would have uh
[1:52:21] significant bits of information but lord
[1:52:23] he didn't matter to him because you said
[1:52:27] help us take the same spirit lord
[1:52:30] and god may that dove that went out the
[1:52:33] third time
[1:52:35] may it find a permanent place in my
[1:52:38] heart lord
[1:52:40] may it find its place lord as the waters
[1:52:43] have dried up off of my heart lord
[1:52:45] lord you've spoken and brought the light
[1:52:47] and brought the life to the seed and the
[1:52:49] seed is grown now into a tree of life
[1:52:51] within my heart
[1:52:52] i pray lord that that holy ghost that
[1:52:55] dove finds its place in our hearts as
[1:52:57] your children lord
[1:52:58] and there you abide for that's your
[1:53:01] promise
[1:53:02] god help us to receive your word and
[1:53:04] stick with it
[1:53:06] help us to rejoice in it and take
[1:53:07] delight on it help us lord to see
[1:53:09] ourselves to see your plan of redemption
[1:53:12] and ourselves in that plan in every
[1:53:14] story
