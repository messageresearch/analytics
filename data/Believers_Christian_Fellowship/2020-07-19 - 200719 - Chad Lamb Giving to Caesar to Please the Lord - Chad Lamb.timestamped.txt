[7:32] first thessalonians 5 18.
[7:42] also um i received a text message that
[7:46] was forwarded to me
[7:48] and i haven't had time to validate this
[7:51] information so if it's false i'm very
[7:53] very sorry for that
[7:54] but i've heard twice that it may be true
[7:57] that brother donny reagan is requesting
[7:59] prayer for his daughter
[8:01] erica who's age 40 and they found a
[8:04] tumor on her liver
[8:06] the text i said that was sent to me said
[8:09] that the doctor said the
[8:10] tumor didn't originate there but she's
[8:12] going for further testing and brother
[8:14] donnie's asking for prayer
[8:16] so we want to hold our brother and
[8:17] sister up and the whole family up in
[8:19] prayer
[8:20] and their whole assembly as we as we
[8:22] pray with the scripture so let's read
[8:24] this together first thessalonians 5
[8:25] 18 in everything give thanks
[8:30] for this is the will of god in christ
[8:32] jesus concerning you
[8:34] amen let's bow our heads and pray dear
[8:37] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[8:39] day that you've given us
[8:41] to be upon this earth lord to shine
[8:43] forth your glory
[8:44] to sing your praises to minister lord
[8:47] your word
[8:48] god we pray that you would open this
[8:50] these lips of clay lord and
[8:52] more than the thoughts of a man would
[8:54] come forth but your word would be
[8:55] preached lord
[8:57] and it's true in its trueness and it's
[9:00] honesty and it's purity
[9:01] may you speak lord and god i pray that
[9:04] you would take
[9:04] absolute control over us your children
[9:07] that you would take your
[9:08] word and shape us lord into your very
[9:10] image that we would be the reflection on
[9:12] earth of who you
[9:13] are and god i pray you would take
[9:15] control of the service i pray you calm
[9:17] every spirit lord
[9:18] that you would take every evil spirit
[9:20] and move it out of the way knowing that
[9:22] your holy spirit might have free reign
[9:24] in our hearts and lives no we pray for
[9:27] our brother donnie
[9:29] for his daughter erica for their
[9:30] children and spouses and all that's
[9:33] associated with the whole church
[9:34] lord that's our brother our sister this
[9:38] is a family lord that's going through a
[9:39] trial
[9:40] we just want to bind our faith with
[9:42] theirs and as your children we want to
[9:43] bind together
[9:45] with our brothers and sisters and ask
[9:46] that you would deliver lord
[9:48] that you would heal that you would show
[9:50] yourself mighty on their behalf lord
[9:53] and god that there would come forth a
[9:54] tremendous testimony lord that would
[9:56] encourage
[9:57] your bride around the world god be high
[10:00] and lift it up in every situation
[10:02] and bring forth your glory we pray in
[10:04] jesus christ's name
[10:06] amen god bless you as you're seated
[10:11] so like i said we've got some talking to
[10:13] do
[10:14] we find ourselves in a
[10:18] different situation than we found
[10:20] ourselves in a wednesday
[10:22] since from wednesday to today
[10:26] allen county has went under a mandatory
[10:28] mask
[10:30] order from the governor from the
[10:33] department of health
[10:34] and so you know that's
[10:38] that's a change in what's been going on
[10:40] that order
[10:41] is actually a different direction than
[10:43] the way things have been going
[10:45] and it caused a lot of for me a lot of
[10:48] misunderstanding
[10:50] a lot of uh soul searching trying to
[10:52] understand what we're supposed to do now
[10:55] and it came about i guess thursday night
[10:58] was the decision or thursday
[11:00] went into effect friday night at 6 pm
[11:02] for allen county
[11:04] for everyone this order is different
[11:06] than the other orders because this order
[11:08] isn't specific to an entity a church or
[11:10] a business
[11:11] this order is specific to the individual
[11:14] it's no longer a business and mandates
[11:16] for a business
[11:17] it's no longer a church of mandates for
[11:19] a church
[11:20] but now this order moved from the church
[11:24] from the entity from the businesses and
[11:26] put it upon the people
[11:27] now each individual is responsible for
[11:30] this
[11:31] for this order so the church hasn't had
[11:34] to change anything we as an assembly
[11:36] we haven't had to change anything we
[11:37] haven't had to do anything
[11:39] uh differently uh what we're doing is
[11:42] fine what we're doing is in compliance
[11:43] with everything we've been asking in
[11:44] fact
[11:45] the restrictions were reduced for us as
[11:47] a church and that stayed the same
[11:49] but this changes for the individual and
[11:52] so i want to talk about that today
[11:54] and talk about what that what i believe
[11:56] that means and
[11:58] more than anything i just want to share
[11:59] with you uh
[12:01] the result of a wrestling match that
[12:03] i've had with myself over the last
[12:04] couple of days
[12:06] because i feel like i've been through
[12:07] gethsemane again
[12:10] and you know
[12:14] some of us are wearing masks some of us
[12:15] aren't but you know there's a lot of
[12:17] reasons for that
[12:18] some of us drove from outside the county
[12:20] and may not have realized that we're
[12:22] under
[12:22] this mandate some maybe maybe we thought
[12:25] that we're still under a religious
[12:27] exemption and it didn't apply in the
[12:28] church
[12:29] maybe somebody has a medical exemption
[12:31] and they by law they have a right
[12:34] not to wear the mask so
[12:37] maybe we just didn't have time to
[12:38] thoroughly consider the implications of
[12:41] what it meant for us
[12:42] or didn't know maybe we just felt like
[12:45] we would get to church and find out what
[12:46] happens there
[12:48] you know there's a lot of reasons for
[12:49] somebody wearing one and not wearing one
[12:51] so
[12:52] this morning just relax just relax
[12:55] let me share from the scripture from the
[12:58] word what i've been wrestling with
[13:00] and and let god speak out of his word to
[13:02] us
[13:03] and bring to us a proper understanding
[13:05] of what he wants from us
[13:07] the one thing i don't want to do is i
[13:09] don't want anybody
[13:11] to look around and judge i don't want
[13:12] anybody feel uncomfortable
[13:14] these things are new we don't know how
[13:16] to handle them we've never handled these
[13:18] things before
[13:19] we've never been down this road before
[13:21] we've never been asked to make these
[13:23] decisions as believers before
[13:25] this is our first time we may stumble
[13:27] around a little bit
[13:29] we may not exactly hit the mark first
[13:31] time out
[13:32] but by the grace of god he's going to
[13:34] bring us to where he wants us in his
[13:35] word
[13:36] he's going to guide us he's going to
[13:38] direct us we're going to know what he
[13:40] wants his bride to do and the bride will
[13:42] submit to what he wants
[13:44] so let's take our bibles and turn to
[13:46] first peter chapter
[13:48] two and we're gonna read several
[13:49] scriptures together
[13:51] share several quotes and if i
[13:55] if i could i have the liberty just to
[13:58] share
[14:00] my own wrestling match and use myself as
[14:03] an example
[14:04] because i'm an easy target
[14:08] first peter chapter 2 verse 13.
[14:15] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[14:17] man for the lord's sake
[14:19] whether it be to the king as supreme or
[14:22] unto governors as the
[14:23] to them that are sent by him for the
[14:25] punishment of evil doers
[14:27] and for the praise of them that do well
[14:30] for so is the will of god that with well
[14:32] doing you may be
[14:33] you may put to silence the ignorance of
[14:35] foolish men
[14:36] as free and not using your liberty for a
[14:39] cloak of maliciousness
[14:41] but as the servants of god honor all men
[14:45] love the brotherhood fear god honor the
[14:48] king
[14:49] servants be subject to your masters with
[14:51] all fear not only to the good and gentle
[14:54] but also to the forward for this is
[14:56] thank worthy if a man
[14:58] for conscience towards god endure grief
[15:00] suffering wrongfully
[15:01] for what glory is it if when we be
[15:04] buffeted for your faults
[15:06] you shall take it patiently but if then
[15:08] you do well and suffer for it you take
[15:10] it patiently
[15:11] this is acceptable with god so this
[15:14] is the first scripture that i want to
[15:18] look at
[15:19] that i've been looking at and wrestling
[15:21] with
[15:24] and there's a couple statements that i
[15:26] want to pull out of here
[15:29] submit yourselves verse 13 to every
[15:32] ordinance of man for the lord's sake
[15:34] that's a this is a scriptural mandate
[15:37] coming from peter
[15:38] that has no wiggle room amen and we'll
[15:42] talk about i mean
[15:43] immediately all of everybody's minds or
[15:45] many people's minds goes but
[15:46] this but this but this but this but just
[15:49] let me finish talking
[15:51] because there are butts
[15:54] right and brother bam talks about that
[15:56] and we'll talk about that
[15:58] but we want to make sure we want to make
[16:00] sure
[16:02] that for me i shouldn't say we i'll say
[16:05] me
[16:06] for chad lamb this issue became an
[16:10] issue of self-will
[16:13] it was not an issue of serving god
[16:18] but initially i tried to make it an
[16:20] issue of serving god
[16:22] and i tried to use my own religious
[16:24] pride
[16:26] to justify my disobedience to the
[16:29] authorities
[16:30] and i've had to wrestle that out with
[16:34] myself
[16:35] through a lot of tears and a lot of
[16:36] prayer and a couple sleepless nights
[16:39] but i wrestled it out and i found out
[16:42] that the real problem i was having with
[16:44] this order
[16:45] wasn't my worship to god my real problem
[16:49] i was having this order
[16:50] with this order was my pride
[16:53] it was the real issue that i was
[16:55] struggling with personally was my own
[16:57] personal pride
[16:59] and i had to go through gethsemane again
[17:02] and die to my own pride because
[17:05] initially
[17:06] when anything is said about the church
[17:09] about the word or if anything even
[17:11] remotely applies
[17:13] i'm ready to take up arms and fight
[17:16] right but fighting is not always what
[17:20] god wants
[17:22] there may be a time to resist there may
[17:24] be a time
[17:25] to stand fast but we have to know what
[17:27] that time is
[17:29] when we're there and when we're not and
[17:32] the only guiding principle that i know
[17:34] that i can rely on is the word because
[17:36] my reasoning failed me
[17:38] my own desires failed me what i thought
[17:42] was spiritual i found out was carnal in
[17:46] myself
[17:47] and i'm not putting that off on anybody
[17:49] else that's just me
[17:50] what i thought was spiritual i later
[17:52] realized was carnal
[17:55] and so it says submit yourselves to
[18:00] every ordinance of man for the lord's
[18:02] sake whether it be to the king as
[18:04] supreme or to governors as to them that
[18:06] are sent by him
[18:08] for the punishment of evil doers and for
[18:10] the praise of them that do well
[18:13] let's keep reading and there's a word i
[18:15] want to pull out here
[18:16] for so is the will of god that with well
[18:18] doing you may put to silence the
[18:20] ignorance of the foolish men
[18:22] as free and not using your liberty for a
[18:24] cloak of maliciousness
[18:26] that's an interesting statement we're
[18:28] free
[18:29] we're free unto god we don't worship god
[18:33] by the permission of government that
[18:36] right
[18:37] we don't worship god by permission of
[18:38] government we should worship god by
[18:40] commandment of the word
[18:43] but let's not use our freedom our
[18:46] liberty as a cloak of maliciousness
[18:49] and this word maliciousness means
[18:52] malignant
[18:53] malice ill will desire to injure
[18:56] wickedness depravity
[18:57] wickedness that is not a shame to break
[19:00] laws
[19:01] and i didn't make that up it was right
[19:03] there
[19:05] it is wickedness that is not ashamed
[19:08] to break laws and so
[19:12] let's just keep looking let's go to
[19:13] titus chapter 3.
[19:33] titus chapter 3
[19:37] verse 1 put them in mind to be subject
[19:40] to principalities and powers
[19:42] to obey magistrates to be ready to every
[19:46] good work
[19:46] to speak evil of no man to be no
[19:48] brawlers but gentle
[19:50] showing all meekness unto all men so
[19:53] here paul the apostle is telling timothy
[19:55] to teach this to the believers
[19:57] put them in mind to be subject to
[19:59] principalities and powers
[20:00] and to obey magistrates to be ready to
[20:04] every good work
[20:06] now let's go to colossians together
[20:11] colossians chapter 3
[20:15] verse 22.
[20:22] colossians 3 and 22 servants obey in all
[20:26] things your masters according to the
[20:28] flesh
[20:29] not with eye service as men pleasers but
[20:31] in singleness of heart
[20:32] fearing god and whatsoever you do do it
[20:35] heartily as to the lord
[20:37] and not unto men knowing that of the
[20:39] lord you shall receive the reward
[20:41] of the inheritance for you serve the
[20:43] lord christ
[20:46] so even in a servant in a master
[20:49] relationship
[20:52] not just the good but the forward also
[20:55] the evil the wicked
[20:59] god is saying the way you serve them is
[21:01] the way you serve me
[21:04] that that you serve them as
[21:07] unto the lord not not in men pleasers
[21:09] but in singleness of heart fearing god
[21:12] so whatever we do do it heartedly ask to
[21:14] the lord
[21:15] and not unto men and see
[21:18] i titled this this morning giving to
[21:20] caesar to please the lord
[21:23] not giving to caesar to please caesar
[21:26] but giving to caesar to please the lord
[21:29] let's turn together to romans 13.
[21:43] romans 13
[21:48] and verse 1.
[21:52] this is the i would say this way this is
[21:55] the scripture that pierced my soul
[21:58] this scripture right here in it and it
[22:01] brought me down
[22:03] i was wrestling with these things i was
[22:05] debating
[22:06] wrestling with myself asking the lord
[22:09] for answers for direction
[22:11] what should we do what do you want done
[22:14] and you know i had some conversations
[22:17] with different brothers and i had
[22:18] two brothers in the assembly that made
[22:20] comments to me that just kind of peeled
[22:22] away
[22:23] some of my reasoning and i realized
[22:26] after talking to them
[22:28] that i was trying to justify my own
[22:30] reasoning
[22:31] but i come to this scripture then after
[22:33] that and it pierced me through
[22:35] and romans chapter 13 says let every
[22:39] soul be subject unto the higher powers
[22:42] for there is no power but of god the
[22:44] powers that be
[22:45] ordained of god whosoever therefore
[22:48] resisteth the power
[22:49] resisteth the ordinance of god and they
[22:52] that resist this shall receive to
[22:53] themselves
[22:54] damnation so let's back up and read that
[22:58] again
[22:59] because it's in multiple readings where
[23:00] i was slayed again
[23:02] and again and again
[23:05] let every soul be subject to the higher
[23:07] powers for there is no power but of god
[23:10] but the powers that be are ordained of
[23:12] god whosoever therefore resisteth the
[23:14] power
[23:15] resisteth the ordinance of god and they
[23:17] that resist
[23:18] shall receive to themselves damnation
[23:22] for rulers are not a terror to good
[23:23] works but to the evil
[23:25] wilt thou then not be afraid of the
[23:27] power do that which is good and thou
[23:28] shalt have praise the same
[23:30] for he is the minister of god to thee
[23:32] for good but if thou
[23:34] do that which is evil be afraid for he
[23:36] beareth not the sword in vain
[23:38] for he is minister for he is the
[23:40] minister of god a revenger to execute
[23:42] wrath upon him
[23:43] that do with evil wherefore you must
[23:46] needs be subject not only for wrath
[23:48] here's another kicker but also for
[23:50] conscience sake
[23:53] not just because you'll get in trouble
[23:54] or you'll get a ticket or you'll get a
[23:56] fine
[23:57] or you'll have to pay back taxes or you
[24:00] could get arrested
[24:01] that's not not for wrath's sake do we
[24:03] obey
[24:04] therefore you must need to be subject
[24:06] not only for wrath
[24:07] but also for conscience sake for your
[24:10] own
[24:11] conscience with god
[24:16] for this cause pay you tribute also for
[24:18] they are god's ministers attending
[24:20] continually upon this very thing
[24:22] render therefore to all their dues
[24:24] tribute to whom tribute is due
[24:26] custom to whom custom fear to whom fear
[24:30] honor to whom honor
[24:34] see i i sat my family down last night
[24:40] late like 8 30 and i explained to them
[24:42] that i read these scriptures and we
[24:43] talked
[24:44] and i shocked the daylights out of them
[24:46] because what they were hearing from me
[24:49] was different than what i told them last
[24:50] night
[24:52] i had a different opinion i had
[24:56] reasonings for my difference of opinion
[24:58] i had an
[24:59] action plan that i thought was right and
[25:03] i was i was working it out thinking that
[25:06] we'll be right we can do this and
[25:08] we can whatever and so when i
[25:12] when i sat them down and went through
[25:13] these scriptures and i began to tell
[25:15] them
[25:15] what the scripture says and what i was
[25:17] seeing
[25:19] i mean my family was shocked because
[25:21] they were hearing different out of me
[25:23] so many of you have been hearing me
[25:26] speak
[25:26] maybe differently with a different slant
[25:29] and a different angle
[25:30] on on this but if i have and if i've
[25:34] influenced you
[25:34] i'm sorry i don't i don't want to do
[25:37] that i don't want to influence anybody
[25:39] the wrong way
[25:40] but what i want to do is realize that we
[25:43] do influence each other
[25:45] we have a lot of influence over each
[25:46] other and sometimes
[25:49] our influence is not righteous
[25:55] sometimes our influence is just to try
[25:57] to get other people to see it our way
[25:58] because if many people who are good
[26:00] believers see it our way
[26:02] we believe it's the right way and really
[26:05] what we want to do is see it the
[26:06] scriptural way
[26:08] what does the bible say what does god
[26:10] want from me
[26:11] as an individual in this circumstance
[26:14] today
[26:15] what is my responsibility to christ in
[26:17] this situation
[26:18] not what is my responsibility to the
[26:21] church to other believers
[26:22] but what's my responsibility to christ
[26:26] i mean even coming here
[26:30] and having to have this conversation is
[26:31] not fun for me i don't like it
[26:34] having to wear a mask in the church i
[26:37] don't want to do it
[26:40] i don't do it for me and i don't do it
[26:44] for governor dewine
[26:46] i do it for christ because he told me to
[26:51] i don't want to i don't want to talk
[26:53] like this i don't want to repent to my
[26:55] family and tell them that i have a
[26:56] lord's leading me another way that i
[26:59] don't want to have to tell you that
[27:00] i had uh you know had the wrong idea
[27:04] because of selfishness
[27:06] and pride i don't want to have to come
[27:08] around back with a mask on my face and
[27:10] face all you guys that way
[27:14] but he that will humble himself will be
[27:16] exalted
[27:18] and when you find out that you've not
[27:20] really had the right attitude
[27:22] with the word then it's easy
[27:26] just adjust your attitude to the word
[27:29] and forget about what people think
[27:31] and forget about who's judging you i
[27:34] know who i have to stand before
[27:36] i know who has a string ideas this way
[27:39] and who has extreme ideas this way
[27:41] i know who's judging my comments now and
[27:43] who's not
[27:45] i know i know the possibility of
[27:48] backlash
[27:49] on either side i understand that but one
[27:53] thing that i will not do
[27:55] if i can help it by the grace of god is
[27:58] knowingly
[27:59] go against what god tells me to do
[28:02] if it if it it's cost me and it's
[28:05] costing me and it probably will cost me
[28:07] some more
[28:08] and i want to say that's a good thing
[28:11] that's a good thing
[28:12] you know some people may not have wore
[28:15] mass today because
[28:16] they would have felt funny when somebody
[28:19] looked at him funny
[28:22] that'd have been me somebody wouldn't
[28:24] have wanted the
[28:25] criticism that comes from being
[28:27] unchristianized for
[28:30] giving up your religious rights
[28:34] when in fact i don't see any religious
[28:36] right that was given up
[28:38] that's the real situation i had to be
[28:40] honest with
[28:42] what religious right was given up
[28:46] what
[28:50] brother ma'am used the scripture all the
[28:51] time give unto caesar with a caesar and
[28:53] then the gods what is god's
[28:55] okay and i will give caesar this but
[28:57] i'll give god this
[28:59] but when i thought about my reasoning
[29:01] was
[29:02] i just want to worship with freedom
[29:04] nothing over my faith
[29:05] and and all of these things that i was
[29:07] telling myself
[29:09] and really i just didn't want to wear a
[29:11] mask
[29:12] the reality was i just didn't want to
[29:14] wear a mask
[29:16] and the truth was i was using religious
[29:19] reasons and rhetoric to justify my own
[29:21] desire not to wear a mask
[29:25] but was my reasoning for god
[29:29] or was my reasoning for me that's the
[29:32] million-dollar question that we all need
[29:34] to ask ourselves
[29:35] was my reasoning for god or was my
[29:37] reasoning for me
[29:39] why why did i feel like
[29:44] that somehow i would be off the word or
[29:47] displeasing to god if i worshiped him
[29:49] with a mask on my face why
[29:51] what scripture was i reading what
[29:54] scripture
[29:55] forbade me to do that what scripture
[29:58] limited
[29:59] me in any way from worshiping god with
[30:01] the mouth what scripture
[30:03] and i had to come to terms with the fact
[30:05] no scripture what scripture was i
[30:08] violating by wearing a mask i had to i
[30:10] had to answer myself honestly
[30:12] no scripture i wasn't violating any
[30:15] scripture
[30:16] and i may be missing something you may
[30:17] know something i don't know
[30:19] you may have already wrestled this out
[30:21] and have the answer
[30:22] but i didn't have the answer but for me
[30:26] to move forward without a mask i would
[30:29] have to say
[30:30] there is a scripture that i am going
[30:33] against
[30:35] the scripture to obey those that are in
[30:37] authority i have to
[30:39] i have to disobey this scripture
[30:44] to disobey this order
[30:48] that's just the honesty we have to come
[30:50] down to and i'm not saying
[30:53] that that's wrong there's times as
[30:55] there's orders and laws that will come
[30:56] down that have in the past and will come
[30:58] down
[30:58] that must be disobeyed but they're
[31:01] disobeyed because the word
[31:03] says not because i don't want to
[31:08] not because it's uncomfortable i'm
[31:10] ashamed i'm embarrassed it makes me feel
[31:12] funny
[31:12] and i'm worried about what other people
[31:14] will think of me
[31:16] that's a horrible reason to forfeit the
[31:19] word of god
[31:20] for my own self-will and that's where i
[31:24] was at friends
[31:25] and i was groping struggling you know
[31:28] why i prayed so much didn't take very
[31:32] long to find these scriptures
[31:35] it was very quick but you know what i
[31:37] was praying so much
[31:39] i was wrestling with god i laid on my
[31:41] face and wept before the lord
[31:43] because i wanted him to show me a way
[31:46] around the scripture
[31:48] and that's why i had two sleepless
[31:50] nights that's why i prayed for hours and
[31:53] hours and hours
[31:54] is because i wanted god when i get down
[31:57] to the honesty above all honesty
[31:59] religious rhetoric would say oh i just
[32:01] want to find the will of god his will is
[32:03] his word
[32:04] he gives you his will in his word and so
[32:07] when it come down to it i was begging
[32:10] god to show me a way around this
[32:12] ordinance
[32:15] and then i went through all the same
[32:17] reasoning you go through
[32:18] but is it really a law i mean it's the
[32:20] department of health allen county said
[32:22] they're not going to enforce it if they
[32:23] don't enforce it is it really a law
[32:26] the bible doesn't say if it matches the
[32:29] constitution
[32:32] do you understand we get so much
[32:35] americanism in our mind
[32:38] we get so much laodicea in us
[32:41] people's rights and and our rights and
[32:44] and i got rights to this and legally
[32:47] they can't and the law
[32:48] says and blah blah blah blah blah blah
[32:51] blah
[32:51] when the bible doesn't say that say if
[32:53] it's a magistrate obey them if it's a
[32:55] governor obey them if it's a king
[32:56] obey them it didn't tell me
[32:59] if what they said matches the
[33:02] constitution
[33:05] that sounds funny but that's exactly
[33:07] where our minds have been
[33:09] carnal carnal carnal
[33:13] well it won't hold up in court will it
[33:16] hold up in god's court
[33:18] that's my question i had to ask myself
[33:21] what about i'm not worried about man's
[33:23] court what about
[33:25] god's court well my action with my
[33:28] attitude and my approach
[33:30] and my self-will will it hold up in
[33:32] god's court
[33:34] when he asked me why did you not keep
[33:36] this scripture
[33:38] can is the answer i give him going to
[33:41] satisfy him
[33:43] or is the answer i'm giving to everyone
[33:46] else satisfying me and trying to satisfy
[33:50] them
[33:52] i mean i think this trial
[33:55] is specifically designed to break me
[34:01] and if it has any other effect on you
[34:03] that's fine too
[34:04] but i believe that this this ordinance
[34:07] this trial
[34:08] these circumstances as they change and
[34:10] they fluctuate
[34:11] and and it goes one way it goes in i
[34:13] believe it's all
[34:15] all come down to break chad lamb
[34:19] to break my self-will to break my
[34:22] selfishness
[34:23] to break my pride and if it accomplishes
[34:27] that
[34:27] i say god did a good job
[34:31] and if this one don't do it the next one
[34:33] will
[34:35] and then the next one will chip away
[34:36] what's left and the next one will
[34:39] grind the powder away until eventually
[34:41] you have a bride that's
[34:42] absolutely submissive and wants no mind
[34:45] of her own and has no desire for
[34:47] self-will
[34:47] and she is broken and she is bare and
[34:49] she is honest
[34:54] and says not my will but thine will be
[34:56] done
[34:57] we say that but sometimes god puts us in
[35:00] situations where we actually have to
[35:02] face it
[35:03] you know we talk death to self death to
[35:05] self death to self
[35:07] is an easy thing to ring off the lips
[35:10] and it is the true desire of our heart
[35:12] but when it really comes down
[35:14] to nuts and bolts death to self is
[35:18] hard it
[35:21] takes sacrifice and it takes
[35:24] laying your life down and moving on to
[35:27] the altar of sacrifice
[35:29] and being burnt cut
[35:32] bleed out so that christ can live
[35:37] it took me like i said a lot of
[35:40] wrestling
[35:42] i didn't send any notification to the
[35:44] church because i didn't know what to
[35:45] notify until last night
[35:47] i didn't know what to notify and still
[35:50] in my human spirit i was waffling
[35:54] but in my soul i knew what god was
[35:56] asking me to do
[35:59] and so there had to come a submission
[36:02] you know the whole wrestling match in
[36:04] gethsemane
[36:05] was was wrestling between
[36:09] jesus christ own self-will in the word
[36:12] of god
[36:14] and his wrestling and guessing he was
[36:17] wrestling
[36:18] and that wrestling brought him into
[36:19] agony he knew what the father said
[36:23] he knew what the scripture said he
[36:26] already testified before what was going
[36:28] to happen
[36:29] he knew the word but when it come down
[36:31] to facing the word
[36:33] gethsemane was all about destroying
[36:37] self-will and laying self-will on the
[36:40] altar
[36:40] of god's will and
[36:44] jesus christ born in perfect flesh
[36:47] with no sin when he come to that
[36:50] wrestling match he wrestled it out so
[36:52] much
[36:52] that the sweat was falling as great
[36:54] drops from a blood of
[36:57] great drops of blood from his from his
[36:59] brow amen
[37:00] what do you think that's going to do to
[37:01] us amen when we've got
[37:04] you know a carnal spirit that tries to
[37:06] influence us in a
[37:07] in a body that's not been changed yet
[37:09] amen we've got to stick with the word
[37:12] and stay with the word and say god
[37:13] i've got to die to this and so
[37:15] gethsemane to me
[37:17] is the wrestling match between self-will
[37:19] and god's will
[37:23] and it sounds easy but it's harder than
[37:25] we think
[37:27] and i wonder how much harder it will get
[37:30] yet
[37:34] why because god wants his bride to be
[37:36] perfected
[37:38] by the word see we have a headship and
[37:42] that headship is in our thinking or our
[37:44] reasoning
[37:45] are our spiritual religious
[37:46] justifications
[37:49] but the headship is the word
[37:54] brother branham i'm just going to use
[37:55] some examples of brother benham just
[37:57] to to paint the picture in the message
[38:00] it is the rising of the sun he says as i
[38:02] was tired my arm hurting me from
[38:05] shots that the nurse gave me for leave
[38:07] overseas now as you know in a few days
[38:09] and i must
[38:10] have these shots son and i with cholera
[38:12] yellow fever and everything
[38:13] i was pretty weary making me sick which
[38:16] caesar requires to have these shots
[38:18] before you go into the other nation and
[38:19] i said
[38:20] give caesar that which is caesar's but
[38:22] then give god that which is god's
[38:25] and he's talking about the same
[38:26] experience of having these shots several
[38:28] times but i like
[38:29] he adds to it in different places and
[38:31] another message says when i go overseas
[38:34] they give me so many shots that i look
[38:36] like a guinea egg to get into a place
[38:38] where they just
[38:39] the shots with yellow fever and all
[38:40] kinds of toxins
[38:42] they say that keep you from taking it i
[38:45] didn't want to take it
[38:46] but you have to take it anyhow so that's
[38:49] all right
[38:51] see brother rem didn't want to take it
[38:54] but he said you have to take it anyhow
[38:55] give the caesar what caesar's
[38:57] so it's not that obeying
[39:01] giving up your will and obeying it
[39:03] doesn't mean you want to
[39:05] it doesn't mean you even have to like it
[39:09] you don't have to like it and you don't
[39:11] have to want to
[39:13] because brother bam didn't want to and
[39:15] he didn't like it
[39:17] but he did it because that's what the
[39:19] law required
[39:20] and another time he says monday at two
[39:22] o'clock i have to be down to fort knox
[39:24] kentucky to take some more of those
[39:26] shots to go overseas
[39:27] i try to tell them that i don't need it
[39:33] try to tell them that you don't need it
[39:40] i try to tell them i don't need them but
[39:42] they won't listen to me
[39:45] my arms get so sore and i don't need
[39:47] those things
[39:48] the law says i must have them so the
[39:50] bible said give caesar what caesar's
[39:52] god's what's god's so if i have to take
[39:55] the shots and then preach the gospel to
[39:56] them
[39:57] won't i so that'll be getting god what's
[40:00] god's
[40:01] caesar what's caesar's
[40:04] i'll take the shots because that's what
[40:05] caesar wants and then i'll go preach the
[40:07] gospel
[40:08] and then caesar will get what caesar
[40:10] once and god will get what god wants
[40:15] i ask you the question is that true or
[40:18] not true with a mask
[40:21] can caesar get what caesar wants and god
[40:23] will get what god wants
[40:31] i don't care anymore about my rights as
[40:34] an american citizen
[40:39] i don't care anymore i don't want to
[40:42] have to be a constitutional lawyer to
[40:44] figure out if i obey or not
[40:47] i just want to be a child of god i want
[40:48] to be simple
[40:51] i just want if this is what god wants
[40:54] and i have to look like a fool
[40:56] and i have to be uncomfortable and
[40:58] ashamed
[41:00] and feel awkward and hate it every day
[41:05] i still want to be a son of god i want
[41:08] to obedient to my father
[41:10] see we're not wearing a mask
[41:15] because we're afraid of getting a
[41:18] disease
[41:20] right we were here wednesday and we
[41:22] weren't afraid
[41:23] we were here sunday and we weren't
[41:25] afraid in fact there's no mask required
[41:28] in
[41:28] a in a residence inside a residence i
[41:31] had a residence there's no mask required
[41:32] so we can go over there and all of us if
[41:35] we could pile into one residence we
[41:36] could be in there without a mask
[41:40] and not be afraid of getting anything
[41:42] because it's not about being afraid
[41:45] amen if it was fear then we would be
[41:47] wrong
[41:48] because we should trust god
[41:52] brother branham didn't get a yellow
[41:53] fever shot because he's afraid of
[41:54] getting yellow fever
[41:56] so if it's based on fear i say we're
[41:59] wrong take the mask off
[42:02] but if it's obedience to the word i
[42:06] i want to obey the word
[42:10] and that's like i said
[42:13] things have changed for me and my
[42:15] attitude towards this over the weekend
[42:18] but i don't see wiggle room in it i
[42:19] don't see a way around it
[42:21] i can't see i just can't i can't
[42:25] i can't justify it i can't manipulate it
[42:27] anymore
[42:29] and so when we were faced with it we
[42:31] kept kicking it down the road it won't
[42:32] happen
[42:33] it won't happen it won't happen and boy
[42:36] i was praying that it wouldn't happen
[42:40] but then all of a sudden it happens and
[42:42] when it happens we have to ask ourselves
[42:45] what does god want now now i've really
[42:47] got to deal with it
[42:48] and if i don't really take time to
[42:50] consider what god wants to deal with it
[42:52] i'll make the wrong
[42:53] decision i'll make them i'll make a
[42:54] mistake and that's what i was doing not
[42:56] taking time to actually consider
[42:59] scripturally what i'm supposed to do
[43:01] but what i would do is just you know
[43:04] well you know
[43:05] this and that and the other but when it
[43:08] came down to having to do it now
[43:10] now it throws us into desperation and
[43:13] say
[43:13] god what what am i supposed to do now
[43:19] when the when the health department and
[43:21] the governor they give out guidelines
[43:23] i say thank you for the guidelines
[43:26] because i feel no obligation to keep
[43:28] guidelines
[43:30] but when they make it an ordinance in a
[43:32] law that changes
[43:35] it's different so guidelines
[43:39] are guidelines i appreciate your
[43:41] guidelines
[43:42] those are nice guidelines you did a good
[43:45] job on guidelines
[43:47] but when it comes to an ordinance and a
[43:49] mandate it's different
[43:52] it's different it's a lull
[43:57] let's turn to matthew 17.
[44:14] matthew chapter 17.
[44:22] just so everybody knows the person
[44:24] officiating the service is not
[44:26] required to wear a mask who wants to
[44:34] preach
[44:36] praised god nobody wants to preach this
[44:39] service but after that maybe
[44:42] i didn't want to preach this service but
[44:46] i don't want anybody to feel odd in
[44:48] their mind
[44:50] and that's another thing i'd like to see
[44:52] before we go further
[44:56] i've been watching this thing and
[44:57] because of the church and the trustees
[44:59] and i and the deacons we've been trying
[45:00] to read what we can read and i've been
[45:02] trying to read
[45:03] you know what the ohio department of
[45:05] health puts out and the
[45:07] guidelines and what you find many times
[45:09] is what people
[45:10] think is mandate is suggestion or
[45:13] guideline
[45:14] and what people think is guideline is
[45:17] and there's a lot of confusion in this
[45:19] area and some people would look at
[45:21] somebody and think
[45:22] you're breaking the law when they're not
[45:23] breaking the law they're doing exactly
[45:25] like children 10 and under don't have to
[45:27] wear a mask
[45:29] so people with um uh health reasons a
[45:33] medical exemption
[45:34] they don't have to wear a mask they're
[45:35] not breaking any law
[45:37] and so and there's other exemptions
[45:39] there's other reasons other times
[45:40] there's other places
[45:42] and so let's not let's not become
[45:44] self-righteous on the flip side
[45:47] just leave everybody alone
[45:51] because when you read a news article
[45:52] i've read news articles before
[45:54] that rephrase what's in the guideline
[45:57] what's what's in the order
[45:58] and they rephrase it in a way that's
[46:00] misleading but it's not actually what's
[46:02] said
[46:02] so you can't just read the news article
[46:04] and think that you know exactly what the
[46:06] guidelines are
[46:07] because you don't in fact i spent a lot
[46:09] of time
[46:11] friday friday evening and saturday
[46:13] trying to figure out exactly what's
[46:14] required
[46:15] and i still don't know exactly what's
[46:17] required
[46:19] but i know one thing in allen county if
[46:21] you're indoors and not a resident you're
[46:22] supposed to wear a mask
[46:26] i i don't know past that saturday i
[46:29] tried to call the covet 19
[46:32] state of ohio coven 19 hotline
[46:35] so i called the hotline i waited i got
[46:37] passed on you can tell when you get past
[46:41] and i got passed to a call center in
[46:43] india
[46:45] and an indian woman with a heavy indian
[46:48] accent
[46:49] picked up the phone and i asked some
[46:52] questions
[46:52] and we got nowhere fast
[46:57] so the coven 19 hotline didn't help
[47:01] because i want to know so i'm going to
[47:05] call
[47:05] monday or tuesday pray for me i'm
[47:07] calling monday or tuesday the local
[47:09] health department here in allen county
[47:10] and ask specific questions about every
[47:13] phase of what we're doing
[47:15] can we hear what do we do here what's
[47:17] and then we'll know exactly
[47:18] there won't be any guessing because some
[47:20] people think it means this and some
[47:21] people think it means that
[47:23] and some people think well if you can do
[47:24] this in a restaurant we can do this in
[47:26] the church but because you can do that
[47:27] in a restaurant doesn't mean you can do
[47:28] this in a church
[47:30] all right so pray for me i got a phone
[47:34] call to make
[47:35] and every time i've talked to the health
[47:36] department here in allen county they've
[47:38] been wonderful to deal with
[47:39] it's been easy they've given good
[47:41] answers they've been sympathetic
[47:43] it's been great so i'm praying that god
[47:46] really makes somebody over there have a
[47:47] really good day
[47:49] and that they're in a really good mood
[47:52] because
[47:53] because a lot of the interpretation is
[47:56] up to the local health department
[47:58] and if the local health department says
[48:00] yeah according to the men that you're
[48:02] allowed to do such and such then we're
[48:03] allowed to do such and such
[48:04] so pray that god just shines sunshine
[48:07] down on somebody in the morning
[48:08] there's no traffic on the way to work
[48:10] their coffee tastes better than it's
[48:12] ever tasted
[48:13] so that we can find out because we'll
[48:16] take advantage of any liberty in the law
[48:18] we can have because we're not afraid of
[48:20] disease
[48:22] for me it's just obedience to the lord
[48:25] that's all i want i want to obey the
[48:26] lord
[48:27] at all cost matthew 17
[48:31] verse 24.
[48:38] matthew 17 24 and when they were come to
[48:41] capernaum
[48:43] they that received tribute money came to
[48:44] peter and said doth not your master pay
[48:47] tribute
[48:48] he saith yes and when he was coming to
[48:51] the house jesus prevented him saying
[48:53] what thinketh thou simon of whom do
[48:55] kings of the earth take customs or
[48:57] tribute of their own children or of
[48:59] strangers
[49:01] peter sayeth unto him of strangers jesus
[49:04] saith unto him
[49:05] then are the children free
[49:08] notwithstanding
[49:09] lest we should offend them
[49:12] lest we should offend them
[49:16] go thou to the sea and cast a hook and
[49:18] take up the fish
[49:20] and the first cometh up and when thou
[49:22] hast opened his mouth
[49:24] thou shalt find a piece of money thou
[49:26] shalt take and give
[49:28] unto them for me and for thee
[49:32] jesus very clearly is king of the earth
[49:36] he every he was in the earth and
[49:39] everything was made by him and for him
[49:41] that was made
[49:42] the fish the coins the gold that caesar
[49:45] stamped his face
[49:46] on was his it was made by him and
[49:50] for him and he says
[49:53] who do who do kings who they take taxes
[49:55] of of their own
[49:57] of their own or of of strangers that are
[49:59] strange and are the children free
[50:01] yeah the children are free but but
[50:04] but because we're here in this order
[50:08] because we're living life this way that
[50:12] day will come in the millennium
[50:15] but so we shouldn't offend them
[50:19] go get a coin and pay the tribute for
[50:22] thee
[50:22] and for me jesus christ
[50:25] obeyed the law of the land
[50:29] so that he wouldn't offend them
[50:32] my if my lord can do that i can do
[50:37] lord help me to do that brother branham
[50:40] says in the message and knoweth it not
[50:42] yesterday coming up in the car we drove
[50:43] it in two days from tucson
[50:45] here right 2 000 miles billy and i and
[50:48] so
[50:48] we now that wasn't breaking any speed
[50:50] laws we stayed right
[50:52] i sat there if he's driving i rolled up
[50:55] my fist
[50:56] back like a shotgun with the hammer back
[50:58] i seen him go over i said wait a minute
[51:00] boy
[51:00] now we're told give caesar what's
[51:02] caesar's
[51:03] how would you like to drive the car next
[51:05] to brother branham
[51:09] he cocked back his hand and you go to
[51:11] the speed limit he punched you down and
[51:13] say wait a minute slow down
[51:15] if you've read the message brother bam
[51:17] talks about not speeding
[51:19] over and over and over it's not a
[51:22] one-off statement
[51:23] it's over and over and over in fact when
[51:26] he was coming up to pray for bill dowell
[51:28] he said he goes i drove everything to
[51:30] get up to him i drove everything that
[51:32] the law would allow
[51:35] and nearly tore the tire off of my car
[51:38] right but not over what the law would
[51:41] allow
[51:42] he drove everything because he had
[51:44] somebody sick he had to get to and heart
[51:46] failure that he had to pray for it's
[51:50] interesting
[51:51] he didn't justify his speeding because
[51:53] of the heart failure
[51:58] see i've had to repent for more than
[52:01] just my attitude about a mask
[52:05] when i go to look at when i go to look
[52:08] at the life of brother branham
[52:10] what he told us and the way he lived as
[52:11] an example to this age
[52:14] i realized it requires total
[52:17] submission total submission
[52:21] not my reasoning away why i don't have
[52:24] to do this and reasoning away why i
[52:25] don't have to do this
[52:26] but total submission is what is
[52:28] requiring and you cannot have total
[52:30] submission till you come to total
[52:32] humility
[52:36] it's easy to become so religious that we
[52:38] can get around
[52:39] simple things like not speeding
[52:44] like being really honest with our taxes
[52:46] and any paperwork we fill out
[52:49] like obeying every ordinance of man
[52:53] it's amazing if religion
[52:59] can allow us to circumvent these
[53:02] scriptures we've read
[53:04] we need to dump our religion
[53:08] and have the life we need to repent and
[53:12] say lord i'm nothing special
[53:16] in this life made of the same dirt
[53:19] everybody else is made of
[53:20] inside is a piece of god absolutely
[53:23] but outside is a piece of dirt that's in
[53:26] the process of being redeemed
[53:28] back to god and god put me
[53:31] subject to local authorities local
[53:33] magistrates and local laws
[53:35] and it doesn't matter whether i think
[53:36] they make sense or don't make sense
[53:40] am i keeping the law is not
[53:43] based on whether or not the law makes
[53:45] sense or not
[53:47] or that i agree with it that's
[53:50] interesting
[53:51] well i didn't have to do that because i
[53:53] didn't agree with it well praise god
[53:55] try that a few times
[53:58] see brother branham was was strict
[54:02] for something like speeding he says
[54:05] here in the statue of a perfect man
[54:08] hebrew children had patience sure they
[54:10] did god had promised them
[54:12] told them don't you bow down to any
[54:14] image but they had patience said
[54:16] our god is able but nevertheless we're
[54:18] not going to bow to your image
[54:19] patience knowing this that god will
[54:21] raise them up in the last days again
[54:24] this life don't mean so much after all
[54:26] see god will raise it up again in the
[54:28] last days
[54:28] but when it comes to bowing to an image
[54:30] we won't do that now we'll give caesar
[54:32] what caesar but when it comes to caesar
[54:34] interfering with god
[54:35] god is first is that true god is first
[54:40] this was one of my justifying quotes
[54:43] self-justification quotes
[54:46] but really when i when i took it back to
[54:48] every example brother had been amused
[54:51] every example is straightforward
[54:52] clear-cut and absolute violation of
[54:55] scripture
[54:56] bowing down to an image is an absolute
[54:59] violation of scripture
[55:02] wearing a mask in church is not what i
[55:04] can find a violation of scripture
[55:08] it violates my comfort level it violates
[55:11] my personal
[55:13] prestige it violates my personal comfort
[55:18] it even it can even hinder my liberty
[55:21] and this was my big stance that i was
[55:23] taking if it hinders liberty to worship
[55:25] then it's wrong
[55:26] but it doesn't hinder god's ability to
[55:29] receive worship
[55:30] i'm only limited by myself
[55:34] my own thinking my own
[55:37] pride my own arrogance my own need to
[55:40] look good feel good be comfortable
[55:42] god's not limited in receiving praise
[55:44] and praise is not limited
[55:46] the limitation to my praise is me
[55:50] and i realized i'm going to have to get
[55:52] over myself
[55:57] see a dead man don't care
[56:02] and i realized i wasn't as dead as i
[56:04] thought i was
[56:06] a dead man don't care what he looks like
[56:08] you can put anything on him you want
[56:10] he don't get offended he don't care what
[56:13] you say about him what you say to him
[56:14] he don't care what you do to him because
[56:16] he's dead and i want to be
[56:19] more dead please god make me more dead
[56:23] make me to where it's not about me it's
[56:26] about you
[56:26] it's about your word it's about staying
[56:28] true to what you told me to do
[56:30] regardless of how it makes me feel
[56:31] regardless of how it makes me look
[56:33] regardless of what i've said in the past
[56:35] and still have to take a strong stance
[56:37] just to pretend to to protect my
[56:40] previous position
[56:42] because a lot of defiance now is people
[56:45] protecting
[56:46] a previous position and not enough pride
[56:48] to say
[56:49] this is different i was too hard-lined i
[56:51] need to change
[56:53] and some of us
[56:57] you get so uh fixated on the image
[57:01] that that we can't back up on something
[57:04] we said before
[57:05] or a position we took or a claim we made
[57:07] i'll never
[57:08] i'm not going to you'll never see me
[57:12] in a
[57:18] and sometimes we look at the scriptures
[57:22] we have trouble in our heart but we come
[57:25] up with spiritual
[57:26] justification not to be right with god
[57:28] but to protect
[57:29] what we said before because i told
[57:32] everybody i'll never wear one of them
[57:39] god has been slaying me
[57:43] slaying me filleting me shaving me down
[57:48] i'm surprised i could still get my suit
[57:50] on this morning
[57:53] he's been cutting me down and cutting me
[57:55] down and cutting me down
[57:58] until i can say what is me and what is
[58:02] god
[58:03] because i was trying to make this god
[58:05] when this wasn't god it was really me
[58:12] you know a lot of people have forced
[58:15] themselves to die on a mountain they
[58:17] didn't need to die on
[58:19] because they were too prideful to say i
[58:22] was wrong and so they stay on the
[58:25] mountain
[58:26] and die on the mountain and i don't want
[58:30] to die
[58:31] on the mountain of my own self-will my
[58:32] own idea my own foolish speaking without
[58:35] thinking
[58:36] i want to die on the altar of sacrifice
[58:39] and let god take me
[58:41] and use me for his glory do what you
[58:44] want with me lord
[58:47] what would happen what would happen
[58:51] if america is invaded tomorrow
[58:55] communists take over russia takes over
[58:59] and we now become a russian proxy with
[59:01] new laws
[59:03] would you still try to live by american
[59:05] laws
[59:09] and think that that would be right with
[59:11] god
[59:12] or would we just subject to the powers
[59:14] that god allowed to be in power and
[59:16] rulership
[59:20] see we've never had to answer that
[59:21] question but we've had brothers and
[59:22] sisters all over the world that have
[59:24] went through that very thing
[59:25] multiple times those little countries in
[59:29] the eastern bloc
[59:29] change hands change hands change
[59:31] rulership change rules change laws
[59:34] and they've been faced with issues like
[59:36] this time and time again
[59:37] but we've been insulated in america amen
[59:40] but now we're seeing the insulation come
[59:42] off
[59:43] and things are beginning to change and
[59:44] now we're having to face things our
[59:46] brothers and sisters have faced for
[59:47] years
[59:48] and we have to say what's god and wants
[59:51] me if god
[59:52] amen if god removes our government and
[59:55] puts russia
[59:56] in place what are we supposed to do
[1:00:01] get a gun and start shooting people
[1:00:05] fight what are you fighting for rights
[1:00:09] what rights
[1:00:16] see
[1:00:19] laodicea takes a while to wash out
[1:00:25] a merit the american spirit takes a
[1:00:27] while to wash out
[1:00:29] it's got to be washed out i say god
[1:00:32] wash it out of me please wash away
[1:00:35] laodicea wash away
[1:00:37] all those natural carnal things to where
[1:00:39] i can take your word and your word
[1:00:42] only and stand on your word and let your
[1:00:44] word be my guiding principle
[1:00:46] and you give me the spirit amen to obey
[1:00:48] your word at all costs
[1:00:56] so when it comes to caesar interfering
[1:00:58] with god god is first
[1:01:01] of course he said don't you bow to that
[1:01:03] god said don't you bow to that image and
[1:01:04] i won't do it
[1:01:06] our god is able to deliver us if he
[1:01:08] don't i'll not bow down to that image
[1:01:11] so here the three hebrew children they
[1:01:14] had
[1:01:15] an exact direct violation
[1:01:19] of a commandment of god and they're
[1:01:21] commanded to bow before this
[1:01:22] image which they know is a direct
[1:01:25] violation of a commandment of god
[1:01:27] and they refuse but how did they refuse
[1:01:33] how do they refuse i'm not obeying your
[1:01:36] stupid law don't you know i serve god
[1:01:38] and god's better than you
[1:01:39] you better watch out you're gonna turn
[1:01:41] to crispy critters in five minutes
[1:01:48] but that's the very attitude we can have
[1:01:53] and it does not please god
[1:01:58] they said o king live forever
[1:02:05] o king they showed respect
[1:02:08] honor and reverence
[1:02:12] these three had obeyed
[1:02:16] the king in everything they were
[1:02:19] counselors they were wise men
[1:02:22] they had obeyed the laws they had obeyed
[1:02:25] the king
[1:02:26] they had served the king but they come
[1:02:28] to a place now
[1:02:29] when that rule is interfering with god's
[1:02:32] commandment and they said o king live
[1:02:35] forever
[1:02:37] we cannot bow we cannot bow
[1:02:41] it wasn't arrogant it wasn't brash
[1:02:45] it wasn't hateful
[1:02:49] see if god brings the bride which
[1:02:52] someday i believe god will bring the
[1:02:53] bride to have to take a stand and have
[1:02:55] to refuse the king's order
[1:02:58] but i believe when it comes to that time
[1:03:00] this is just brother chad
[1:03:01] it's not going to be well you know
[1:03:04] maybe it's this maybe it's that it's
[1:03:06] going to be clear violation of the
[1:03:08] scriptures
[1:03:09] a line we can't cross and if we come to
[1:03:12] that place
[1:03:13] how what should our attitude be
[1:03:17] arrogant brash hateful
[1:03:21] or should it be submissive and gentle
[1:03:24] and say oh governor o
[1:03:28] president old judge your honor
[1:03:33] i'm sorry that it has to be like this
[1:03:36] i respect you and i respect the laws but
[1:03:38] i can't cross this line
[1:03:42] see we this may just be training
[1:03:47] for what comes next and i want to pass
[1:03:51] this test so i don't fail the next one
[1:03:55] i want to have the right spirit i want
[1:03:57] to have the right attitude the right
[1:03:59] approach i want to be scriptural in all
[1:04:01] things
[1:04:02] i want to be gentle meek kind loving
[1:04:11] and i'm ashamed of myself
[1:04:14] for the rough speech in which i've
[1:04:18] spoken about governments and authorities
[1:04:21] and i want to apologize to any of you
[1:04:23] have heard me speak that way i'm sorry
[1:04:27] i don't agree with what they're doing i
[1:04:30] personally
[1:04:31] i personally don't
[1:04:34] believe all the hype i don't personally
[1:04:38] believe
[1:04:40] anything i read coming from the media
[1:04:45] i don't believe anything the government
[1:04:47] says
[1:04:49] i believe the word
[1:04:52] i personally don't believe that masks
[1:04:55] are helping that much
[1:04:57] but that's me i could be wrong what if i
[1:05:00] make my decision not to wear when i'm
[1:05:01] wrong
[1:05:03] because i believe they're not really
[1:05:04] that effective i believe them
[1:05:07] you understand it's still me me me me me
[1:05:11] and my feeling hasn't changed i don't
[1:05:13] want to wear one
[1:05:15] i don't know where i'm gonna go out i
[1:05:16] don't wanna wear one to church i
[1:05:19] i don't think it's going to solve all
[1:05:22] the problems i don't think
[1:05:24] i can't change that thinking but i can
[1:05:27] change my attitude how i respond to it
[1:05:31] i can say that's who god put
[1:05:34] that's who god put an authority over me
[1:05:37] and i will not speak evil of men
[1:05:42] i will not speak evil of magistrates and
[1:05:44] presidents and
[1:05:45] i can say i disagree with him look how
[1:05:48] brother branham dealt with john f
[1:05:49] kennedy
[1:05:50] brother ben told us that john f kennedy
[1:05:52] amen the catholic church
[1:05:54] came in on the back of john f kennedy
[1:05:57] he told us what was happening he he
[1:05:59] typed him with ahab
[1:06:03] but when that man was shot look at the
[1:06:05] respect and reverence brother branham
[1:06:07] showed john f kennedy that when he found
[1:06:09] out he was assassinated he talked to the
[1:06:11] crowd and he says
[1:06:12] now i differ with the man and his ideas
[1:06:16] he said but nobody should be shot down
[1:06:18] like that and leave that poor mother
[1:06:20] with them poor babies
[1:06:22] he did not say well that's what he gets
[1:06:25] for doing what he was doing
[1:06:31] but what would you say if anti-mass
[1:06:34] protesters stormed the capitol building
[1:06:37] and tore it down would you
[1:06:40] secretly be happy for them
[1:06:51] now we're cutting close aren't we
[1:06:54] i mean i wouldn't do it that's not right
[1:06:56] to do but i mean
[1:06:57] if you're going to push to people what
[1:06:58] do you think is going to happen
[1:07:04] or would you say that's a shame human
[1:07:06] beings would act that way
[1:07:08] it's a shame they would treat a woman
[1:07:11] that way
[1:07:12] a man that way to shame somebody would
[1:07:14] speak evil to somebody else
[1:07:21] now we're shaving tight now we're doing
[1:07:25] heart surgery and say god
[1:07:30] you're supposed i'm supposed to be a
[1:07:32] reflection of you
[1:07:35] i don't mind saying i disagree with that
[1:07:37] i don't think it's the right decision i
[1:07:39] don't think it's going to help
[1:07:40] no problem but don't speak evil of
[1:07:42] people
[1:07:44] don't speak evil of those who have the
[1:07:46] rule over us or an authority
[1:07:48] just say i don't understand why they're
[1:07:49] doing that you can say
[1:07:51] what he did was wrong there's nothing
[1:07:54] wrong with that
[1:07:55] but don't speak evil and don't wish evil
[1:07:57] and don't hope that evil things happen
[1:07:59] to the people
[1:08:04] i mean what's worse the person who
[1:08:07] throws the strict
[1:08:08] brick through the building or the person
[1:08:11] that enjoyed that somebody else threw
[1:08:12] the brick through the window
[1:08:15] how does god see that
[1:08:19] what does god see when he looks in our
[1:08:21] heart well i would never throw a brick
[1:08:24] through the cavity i wouldn't spray
[1:08:25] paint that message on there but it's the
[1:08:27] truth i mean
[1:08:33] do you understand let's let this thing
[1:08:36] cut us deep let's get cut to ribbons
[1:08:39] this morning
[1:08:41] and say god i'm not into politics
[1:08:47] i want to love the left
[1:08:50] and the right the same nobody deserves
[1:08:53] to be evil spoken of nobody deserves to
[1:08:55] be threatened nobody deserves
[1:08:57] violent speech being spoke about him
[1:08:59] nobody deserves that kind of treatment
[1:09:01] nobody deserves to be afraid or have
[1:09:03] their family being afraid
[1:09:04] nobody deserves to be treated evil
[1:09:08] when they're going to work and doing
[1:09:10] their job even if i disagree with every
[1:09:12] decision they make
[1:09:13] i still want them to be happy have a
[1:09:16] happy family
[1:09:17] have a wife be content be safe
[1:09:20] i don't want anything bad to happen to
[1:09:22] them
[1:09:23] and if we do or we're somehow gratified
[1:09:27] by violent evil conduct because it
[1:09:30] matches what's in our heart
[1:09:31] i say before god that god is not
[1:09:34] separating us too far from the people
[1:09:36] who do the acts
[1:09:38] that's just me brother chad i could be
[1:09:39] wrong
[1:09:41] but i think our attitude has got to
[1:09:43] change my attitude i'm not saying
[1:09:45] anybody else my attitude
[1:09:46] had to change and that's why god allowed
[1:09:49] this masked thing to come to allen
[1:09:51] county
[1:09:51] so that he could get me on my face so
[1:09:54] that i could wrestle
[1:09:55] not with him but with myself until i
[1:09:57] figured out that
[1:09:58] i'm the biggest problem in the whole mix
[1:10:04] god has orchestrated coven 19 for me
[1:10:09] sorry i apologize to the rest of you
[1:10:14] but is god correcting you is god
[1:10:18] fixing you through covet 19
[1:10:22] i hope i hope what i believe
[1:10:27] is that i don't believe i know these are
[1:10:29] the judgments that are rolling upon the
[1:10:30] earth
[1:10:32] because the judgment cycle started back
[1:10:34] when brother branham threw that stone in
[1:10:35] the air and
[1:10:36] and the earthquake hit alaska and he
[1:10:38] says judgment's beginning
[1:10:40] on the west coast and we're under
[1:10:41] judgment cycles this is judgment for the
[1:10:43] world
[1:10:44] but at the same time through the same
[1:10:46] circumstances god is using to judge the
[1:10:48] world
[1:10:48] he is perfecting his bride and the very
[1:10:51] same circumstance judgment on one hand
[1:10:53] perfection on the other hand
[1:10:55] and i i don't want to miss
[1:10:59] the point of the whole show
[1:11:02] the whole event the whole thing i don't
[1:11:05] want to miss the point
[1:11:06] and put them over there and them over
[1:11:07] there and they're under judgment but now
[1:11:09] god's allowed to come to my door
[1:11:11] amen come to my church come to me as a
[1:11:14] person
[1:11:14] and to where i have to face myself with
[1:11:17] this word
[1:11:18] and i've got to i have got to subdue
[1:11:20] myself
[1:11:23] and then i realized that this whole
[1:11:26] covenant 19 thing and these orders and
[1:11:28] mandates
[1:11:29] are here to perfect me because god
[1:11:32] doesn't want me to continue on the way i
[1:11:34] am
[1:11:37] praise be to god
[1:11:42] see there's many many times in the bible
[1:11:44] and many times in the history of the
[1:11:46] church
[1:11:47] that the people refused to keep the
[1:11:49] king's commandments
[1:11:51] but if you watch when they did it was
[1:11:54] straightforward
[1:11:55] it was obvious and easily discerned by
[1:11:57] the scriptures
[1:12:00] not by making some spiritual parallel
[1:12:06] and this means this and
[1:12:10] see that's what i was guilty of trying
[1:12:11] to do
[1:12:13] laboring in prayer looking for a type
[1:12:16] looking for a scripture looking for a
[1:12:19] scriptural principle
[1:12:20] that i could use to justify my anti-mask
[1:12:24] campaign
[1:12:27] and i laid before the lord and i prayed
[1:12:29] and i prayed and i prayed
[1:12:30] and i could not find oh i tried to
[1:12:33] manipulate a few into place
[1:12:36] but somehow when i shoved them in they
[1:12:38] kept popping out
[1:12:40] shove it in it pops out because it
[1:12:41] wasn't an exact
[1:12:43] fit and i realized
[1:12:48] i spent all this time trying to find a
[1:12:51] detour
[1:12:53] around the scriptures when i should have
[1:12:55] just submitted
[1:12:56] and obeyed and saved myself a lot of
[1:12:59] trouble
[1:13:01] and then i realized the wrestling match
[1:13:03] for me was the point
[1:13:06] was the point of the whole thing
[1:13:11] brother bram says this is another
[1:13:13] example i want to look at
[1:13:15] he says in the message once more now we
[1:13:18] are sorry that we didn't
[1:13:20] did not have room to accommodate the
[1:13:21] people each night nearly when i've come
[1:13:24] up
[1:13:24] there's been great throngs of people all
[1:13:26] up and down the street walking trying to
[1:13:27] get in
[1:13:28] and some crying some different you know
[1:13:31] but i know that it's
[1:13:32] they they have a law here a fire
[1:13:34] marshal's law
[1:13:35] just so many you have to leave so much
[1:13:37] aisles and so forth
[1:13:38] and they cannot help and that they
[1:13:41] cannot help because that we are
[1:13:42] as christians we've got to do that
[1:13:46] for the bible said jesus told us to give
[1:13:48] caesar the things that are
[1:13:49] pertained to caesar and then to god the
[1:13:51] things that belong to god
[1:13:52] so we try to and if we will not obey
[1:13:55] caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey god
[1:14:00] that's a stinger
[1:14:04] if we won't obey caesar it's doubtful
[1:14:05] that we'd obey god
[1:14:07] and as long as caesar's law doesn't
[1:14:09] interfere with god's we must obey god
[1:14:11] first
[1:14:12] and then these fire hazards and so forth
[1:14:14] well they know how to take care of that
[1:14:16] and they told us i was asking for mercy
[1:14:19] for the people
[1:14:20] brother branham is going talking to the
[1:14:21] fire marshal whoever he's talking to
[1:14:23] he's asking for mercy for the people for
[1:14:25] them to stretch the law to let him have
[1:14:27] more people
[1:14:28] in i asked for mercy for the people
[1:14:31] seeing them up and down the streets and
[1:14:32] things and sick
[1:14:34] and trying to get in and bring them in
[1:14:35] cabs from across somewhere else in new
[1:14:37] york or long island and jersey
[1:14:39] or different places in manhattan well
[1:14:41] you see but
[1:14:42] we can only ask and then when i find out
[1:14:45] that that's the law
[1:14:46] why he said if the fire marshal would
[1:14:48] come in and catch us crowded like that
[1:14:50] we would close the whole meeting so that
[1:14:52] would cut everybody out
[1:14:54] so brother branham what was his motive
[1:14:57] what was his objective
[1:14:59] to get more sick and needy people into
[1:15:02] the church
[1:15:02] so that he could pray for more people
[1:15:05] because god told him
[1:15:07] you've got a gift of healing you're
[1:15:08] going to take a gift of healing to the
[1:15:10] peoples of the world
[1:15:11] so he has a justifiable reason
[1:15:14] to want to pray for the sick people
[1:15:16] because an angel of the lord
[1:15:17] told him he was to take a gift of
[1:15:19] healing to the people of the world
[1:15:22] you see how easy it is to make the lines
[1:15:25] fuzzy
[1:15:28] well this is a greater spiritual reason
[1:15:35] it'd be easy to make the lines fuzzy
[1:15:40] but brother branham said well that's the
[1:15:41] law that's the law he asked for mercy he
[1:15:44] tried
[1:15:44] he talked to somebody they explained to
[1:15:46] him the law he said well that's just it
[1:15:47] then
[1:15:49] he didn't say well don't tell nobody
[1:15:51] just slip a few more in
[1:15:55] praise god we're dealing with important
[1:15:58] things we're dealing with praying for
[1:15:59] the sick preaching the word the gospel
[1:16:01] going forth people hearing the gospel
[1:16:04] and brother brahma stayed in the law
[1:16:09] let's go to acts 23.
[1:16:23] acts 23
[1:16:29] acts chapter 23 and verse 1.
[1:16:36] and paul earnestly beholding the council
[1:16:38] said men and brethren
[1:16:39] i have lived in all good conscience
[1:16:41] before god until this day
[1:16:43] and the high priest ananias commanded
[1:16:45] them that stood by him to smite him on
[1:16:47] the mouth
[1:16:48] then said paul unto him god shall smite
[1:16:50] thee thou wided wall
[1:16:53] god shall smite thee thou white a
[1:16:54] walford for sitteth thou
[1:16:56] to judge me after the law and command us
[1:16:58] me to be smitten contrary to the law
[1:17:01] he just defied the law the high priest
[1:17:04] he commanded him to be smitten contrary
[1:17:07] to the law
[1:17:09] verse 4 and they that stood by said
[1:17:11] revilest thou are
[1:17:13] reviled us thou god's high priest then
[1:17:15] said paul i wish not brethren that he
[1:17:17] was the high priest for it is written
[1:17:19] thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler
[1:17:21] of thy people.
[1:17:24] paul because of the word backed down
[1:17:28] it wasn't that what paul said was wrong
[1:17:30] it was the truth
[1:17:31] but it was who he was addressing he had
[1:17:34] another scripture that told him not to
[1:17:36] address the ruler of god's people that
[1:17:37] way
[1:17:38] and paul repented himself and backed
[1:17:39] down because of the word
[1:17:41] not because the merit of the high priest
[1:17:44] because the high priest was wrong had
[1:17:46] him smitten contrary to the word
[1:17:48] and i'm sure that paul may have been a
[1:17:50] little offended in his spirit
[1:17:53] being smote across the mouth
[1:17:56] and what he speaks is the truth amen
[1:17:59] but then when he finds out who he's
[1:18:00] speaking to then the word comes back to
[1:18:03] him
[1:18:03] and says oh i didn't know that was the
[1:18:05] high priest for the word says
[1:18:08] i'm not supposed to speak to him that
[1:18:10] way.
[1:18:12] i mean my first response my heart i'm
[1:18:14] like you get him paul
[1:18:18] he had it coming
[1:18:24] but paul was ashamed when he found out
[1:18:25] who that was can we be ashamed of paul
[1:18:29] because paul violated the word or do we
[1:18:32] still
[1:18:32] are we still proud of him
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:38] do you understand friends this is the
[1:18:41] reality of living life
[1:18:44] in a fallen human body we got way too
[1:18:48] much fight in us
[1:18:51] god doesn't want the fight and the bride
[1:18:53] god wants to fight for his bride
[1:18:57] he wants us to submit he'll take care of
[1:19:00] everything else
[1:19:00] he wants to be the bridegroom he wants
[1:19:02] to be the king but so many times we want
[1:19:04] to be the one with the spear
[1:19:07] and we want to be the one to do the
[1:19:08] killing when god
[1:19:10] wants us to just stop and be still and
[1:19:12] he'll do the killing
[1:19:17] it's our own personality that gets in
[1:19:20] the way
[1:19:24] brother branham is in questions and
[1:19:26] answers in 64 and he tells this little
[1:19:28] story
[1:19:29] he said i'm going to say this just look
[1:19:31] at a person a few minutes ago
[1:19:32] it was asked me by a fine boy the other
[1:19:34] day we was hunting squirrels
[1:19:36] the morning i got five i left one of
[1:19:38] them for that afternoon
[1:19:39] you only get six in the state of
[1:19:41] kentucky that's the limit
[1:19:43] so this certain person said i got nine
[1:19:46] christian boy fine kid
[1:19:48] christian boy fine kid i got nine
[1:19:51] i said you done wrong you did wrong
[1:19:55] he said well i said i had five that
[1:19:57] morning saved one for that afternoon
[1:19:59] and when i got that one squirrel looked
[1:20:01] in the tree and counted five or six
[1:20:02] setting right there
[1:20:03] where i could look at them walked out
[1:20:05] and left them i said i walked up through
[1:20:07] here not long ago and there was about 15
[1:20:09] or 20 sitting there
[1:20:10] i just took the limit and walked away
[1:20:12] and left the rest of them there
[1:20:14] i said if i come to this country
[1:20:16] preaching to you boys and you people
[1:20:18] here
[1:20:18] that things that's right i've got to
[1:20:20] live that example
[1:20:22] christianity ain't what you say it's
[1:20:24] what you live
[1:20:25] what you do it's an example you're the
[1:20:28] salt of the earth i said
[1:20:30] then the law says jesus said you give
[1:20:32] caesar them things that belong to caesar
[1:20:34] you break that speed low out there what
[1:20:36] are you doing you're doing wrong
[1:20:38] you sin give caesar what's caesar's in
[1:20:40] god what's god's
[1:20:42] say well the law's wrong i can't help
[1:20:44] what wrong it is
[1:20:45] it's wrong to break jesus's commandment
[1:20:51] it's good but it hurts it hurts good
[1:20:54] it's right but it's too right
[1:21:03] if and if you don't give caesar the
[1:21:05] things that caesar's then you did what
[1:21:07] jesus told you not to do
[1:21:09] and a transgression of the law is sin
[1:21:11] that right
[1:21:12] we're all guilty i'm glad he said that
[1:21:16] we're all guilty we do it but when you
[1:21:20] see yourself
[1:21:21] wrong stop it
[1:21:25] amen amen
[1:21:28] when you see yourself wrong stop it boy
[1:21:31] wouldn't that be nice if we could do
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:33] and quit playing scenarios in our mind
[1:21:34] but what if in scripture says it
[1:21:36] brotherhood says and blah blah blah blah
[1:21:37] blah and just say
[1:21:38] i'm wrong i'm going to stop it
[1:21:42] i'm wrong i'm gonna stop it
[1:21:47] we're all guilty i'm gonna read that
[1:21:48] again we're all guilty we do it
[1:21:51] but when you see yourself wrong stop it
[1:21:53] people are watching you
[1:21:55] people won't go to church but they'll
[1:21:57] read you
[1:21:58] see what you do so
[1:22:02] we've got to be right
[1:22:07] brother rem tells another story of going
[1:22:10] to africa
[1:22:11] in 1965 and we've talked about many
[1:22:14] times you know but
[1:22:15] just before he left his visa was was
[1:22:18] was marked that he could come in as a
[1:22:20] hunter only that he could not preach
[1:22:22] so there was a restriction put on him by
[1:22:24] the government
[1:22:26] and and brother branham was saying
[1:22:29] before that
[1:22:30] he definitely felt led of the lord to go
[1:22:32] to africa that they're going to have big
[1:22:34] meetings that he's going to go up there
[1:22:35] like a hunter and he's going to come
[1:22:37] down amen and they've already got the
[1:22:39] hall rented and don't even know it we've
[1:22:41] already got a plan
[1:22:42] we're going to work this out
[1:22:46] and he got the visa just a little bit
[1:22:49] before he left
[1:22:50] restricted and he said i nearly fainted
[1:22:54] somebody come on anyways because i
[1:22:55] thought the lord wanted me to
[1:22:57] and here he is just before he leaves
[1:22:59] he's in johannesburg there's a little
[1:23:01] bitty tape segment at the end of the
[1:23:02] message of shame
[1:23:03] and he's talking about this restriction
[1:23:05] and all of that he's standing outside
[1:23:07] and they record this he's not allowed to
[1:23:09] preach
[1:23:09] but they're outside somebody's private
[1:23:11] home
[1:23:12] and he's he's standing there addressing
[1:23:14] them talking to them and somebody
[1:23:15] recorded it just while he's speaking
[1:23:18] and he says here he goes i remember that
[1:23:21] great meeting here in johannesburg i
[1:23:22] remember the boy with the short leg
[1:23:24] coming
[1:23:25] long again normal and the the lady that
[1:23:27] little girl was healed from the back
[1:23:28] condition and her mother
[1:23:29] fainted and fell back in the cot and
[1:23:32] brother bannon was speaking and there
[1:23:33] was an interpreter interpreting in the
[1:23:35] afrikaans
[1:23:36] and the interpreters interjects the
[1:23:38] interpreter speaks in english
[1:23:40] brother branham that was my wife's
[1:23:42] cousin
[1:23:44] years ago that woman who fainted when
[1:23:46] her little daughter was healed of a
[1:23:47] background
[1:23:48] faint and fell back in the car he said
[1:23:49] that was my wife's cousin brother man
[1:23:51] said to your wife
[1:23:52] oh there are so many great things no
[1:23:54] doubt there was
[1:23:55] many of those people attended those
[1:23:56] meetings are with the lord now
[1:23:58] i've gotten old too since then it won't
[1:24:00] be too long until we my time
[1:24:02] to go up then we'll then we will be
[1:24:04] together forever no visas
[1:24:07] then listen what he says next i feel
[1:24:11] like bringing the message
[1:24:13] but it is written in the scripture given
[1:24:15] to caesar the things that are caesar's
[1:24:18] and to god the things that are god's
[1:24:21] he felt like preaching right there right
[1:24:25] outside somebody's home
[1:24:26] i feel like bringing the message but he
[1:24:28] pulled himself back
[1:24:29] and pulled his gift back
[1:24:35] because of what because of what a
[1:24:38] carnal authority in a visa office
[1:24:42] stamped on his document and wrote a
[1:24:43] restriction
[1:24:45] here the prophet of the age who now is
[1:24:47] with believers who
[1:24:48] who i feel like bringing a message pulls
[1:24:50] his gift and pulls himself
[1:24:52] back because of what a man wrote on a
[1:24:54] piece of paper
[1:24:56] because he subjected himself to the
[1:24:58] authorities
[1:25:01] i said oh how easy it would have been
[1:25:03] for him to just let loose and start
[1:25:05] preaching
[1:25:06] sneak in somewhere where they're not
[1:25:07] looking get into a church
[1:25:09] but the prophet of god wouldn't would
[1:25:11] not violate that visa restriction
[1:25:15] even though he felt it was the leading
[1:25:16] of the lord to go he felt god wanted him
[1:25:18] to preach
[1:25:18] he felt that he should go over there and
[1:25:20] pray for the sick again
[1:25:22] but he had to take and surrender his
[1:25:24] feelings in what he
[1:25:26] thought was the leading of the lord and
[1:25:27] it very well was the leading of the lord
[1:25:29] but not according to what he thought
[1:25:32] he had to take what he thought the
[1:25:35] leading of the lord meant and what he
[1:25:36] thought he was supposed to do and he had
[1:25:38] to subject it because
[1:25:40] god allowed that visa to be restricted
[1:25:44] and if god allowed that visa to be
[1:25:47] restricted
[1:25:48] brother branham obeyed what god allowed
[1:25:54] do you think god allowed the mandate
[1:25:55] we're under
[1:25:57] or does he have nothing to do with it
[1:26:01] it affects his children if god allowed
[1:26:04] it then what did he allow it for
[1:26:07] did he allow it for my protest for my
[1:26:09] defiance for my willfulness to come to
[1:26:11] the surface
[1:26:13] yeah so that he can purge it out of me
[1:26:20] the question is there's coming a time
[1:26:23] that the bride will have to put god
[1:26:24] first
[1:26:26] that you put see give to caesar what
[1:26:28] caesars give to god what's gone
[1:26:30] and there come a time in order to give
[1:26:32] god what is god you're going to have to
[1:26:33] deny caesar what he's asking for
[1:26:36] my question to you is this mask order
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:40] time and you have to answer that in your
[1:26:43] own heart
[1:26:45] is this a direct violation of the
[1:26:48] scriptures
[1:26:50] is this the same thing that three hebrew
[1:26:52] children went through it's the same
[1:26:53] thing daniel went through
[1:26:54] is this the same thing that peter went
[1:26:56] through when they told him not to teach
[1:26:58] in his name anymore
[1:27:01] that's a good question
[1:27:04] god's already answered the question for
[1:27:06] me
[1:27:08] but don't take my answer
[1:27:11] don't take my answer don't take my
[1:27:13] actions don't look at my family to
[1:27:15] decide what to do
[1:27:16] read the scriptures read the bible
[1:27:20] read the message lay in prayer get
[1:27:22] humble and broken
[1:27:24] and throw all self-will out the window
[1:27:25] and all pride out the window
[1:27:27] and forget what you've already been
[1:27:29] blasting off with the mouth telling
[1:27:30] people for months
[1:27:31] just just wipe it all away and sit down
[1:27:33] there and say
[1:27:34] god what do you want me to do right now
[1:27:37] with this order
[1:27:39] i've even was justifying in my own mind
[1:27:41] but if i give here
[1:27:42] what next and if we give a little bit
[1:27:45] here and give a little bit here
[1:27:47] what next that's a good question what
[1:27:49] next
[1:27:51] do we know if there's a next do we know
[1:27:53] if there's something coming after that
[1:27:54] there may there may not why why would i
[1:27:57] disobey the word here because of what
[1:28:00] might come next
[1:28:03] i don't know what's coming next i'll
[1:28:05] deal with it when it comes next
[1:28:07] why can't we take this by itself and say
[1:28:10] what does god want me to do with this
[1:28:12] regardless of what might come next
[1:28:19] oh praise god i tell you he's been
[1:28:22] slaying me
[1:28:24] slaying me all my reasonings
[1:28:28] all my justifications all my religious
[1:28:32] surmisings
[1:28:34] all my types and spiritual types
[1:28:37] god just pulled the string
[1:28:40] and they all fell apart and i had to be
[1:28:43] honest
[1:28:44] with the scriptures
[1:28:48] let's look at the scripture together in
[1:28:49] romans 14.
[1:28:58] romans 14 1.
[1:29:07] before we read that i just like to say i
[1:29:10] think sometimes for me
[1:29:13] it's the fact that i so know that the
[1:29:15] bride has to make a stand
[1:29:17] and i know at some point that the bride
[1:29:20] is going to have to say no
[1:29:22] and i believe that so strongly that i'm
[1:29:24] always watching for that time
[1:29:28] and if anything gets close i'm ready to
[1:29:30] go into action
[1:29:34] instead of waiting for god did say
[1:29:38] now how does he tell me through his word
[1:29:43] not my own desire through his word he'll
[1:29:46] show me
[1:29:47] through the word and then i make my
[1:29:49] stand on the word
[1:29:52] not for my religious freedoms
[1:29:55] that come from a united states
[1:29:57] government
[1:30:01] we don't stand up for that we stand up
[1:30:03] for the word
[1:30:06] not for my own willful desire or my own
[1:30:09] thoughts
[1:30:12] but we stand for the word
[1:30:16] god leads us by the word
[1:30:22] so convinced that there's coming a time
[1:30:25] when we all come to show down
[1:30:26] we all have to stay on the word
[1:30:29] irregardless as if it brings persecution
[1:30:31] or rejection or
[1:30:32] or even if legal consequences there may
[1:30:35] come a time for that
[1:30:36] when that time comes i want to be able
[1:30:39] to make that stand but i
[1:30:40] i feel like we're so confident that
[1:30:42] that's coming and we're so confident
[1:30:44] that we're on the precipice of that
[1:30:45] possibly
[1:30:46] that we're ready to spring into action
[1:30:48] anytime anything looks like it might be
[1:30:50] that
[1:30:51] instead of waiting and saying is this
[1:30:53] that
[1:30:54] is this this time is it contrary to
[1:30:56] scripture is it forbidding me from
[1:30:57] keeping the word
[1:31:00] is this time to defy or is this not time
[1:31:03] to defy
[1:31:05] so good questions really good questions
[1:31:09] romans 14 verse 1.
[1:31:12] i'm going to use this as an analogy but
[1:31:14] the analogy doesn't fit
[1:31:16] exactly so just don't don't let me
[1:31:19] explain after after i read this
[1:31:21] let me look here at yeah romans chapter
[1:31:24] 14 verse 1
[1:31:25] him that is weak in the faith receive ye
[1:31:27] but not to doubtful disputations for one
[1:31:30] believeth that he may eat all things
[1:31:31] another who is weak
[1:31:33] eat his herbs let not him that eateth
[1:31:35] despise him that eateth not
[1:31:37] and let not him that he does not judge
[1:31:39] him that eateth
[1:31:40] for god hath three god hath received him
[1:31:43] who art thou that judgest another man's
[1:31:45] servant
[1:31:46] to his own master he standeth her
[1:31:48] falleth yea he shall be holding up
[1:31:51] for god is able to make him stand one
[1:31:53] man esteemeth one day above another
[1:31:55] another esteemeth every day alike let
[1:31:58] every man be fully persuaded in his own
[1:32:00] mind
[1:32:01] he that regardeth the day regardeth it
[1:32:03] unto the lord
[1:32:05] and he that regardeth not the day to the
[1:32:07] lord he does not regard him
[1:32:09] he that eateth eateth to the lord for he
[1:32:11] giveth god
[1:32:12] thanks and he that he is not to the lord
[1:32:14] he eateth not and giveth god thanks
[1:32:16] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[1:32:18] man die to himself
[1:32:20] for whether we live we live unto the
[1:32:21] lord and whether we die we die
[1:32:23] unto the lord and whether we live
[1:32:25] therefore or die we are the lords
[1:32:28] for to this end christ both died and
[1:32:30] rose and revived
[1:32:31] that he might be lord both of the dead
[1:32:34] and the living
[1:32:35] but why does thou judge thy brother or
[1:32:37] why dost thou said it not thy brother
[1:32:39] for we shall all stand before the
[1:32:41] judgment seat of christ
[1:32:42] for it is written as i live saith the
[1:32:44] lord every knee shall bow to me every
[1:32:46] tongue shall confess to god
[1:32:47] so then every one of us shall give
[1:32:49] account of himself to god
[1:32:51] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:32:53] any more but
[1:32:54] judge this rather that no man put a
[1:32:56] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[1:32:59] in his brother's way now let's jump down
[1:33:02] to verse 22
[1:33:05] hast thou faith have it to thyself
[1:33:07] before god
[1:33:09] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[1:33:11] in that thing which he alloweth
[1:33:15] he and he that doubteth is damned if he
[1:33:18] eat
[1:33:18] because he eateth not of faith for
[1:33:21] whatsoever is not of faith
[1:33:23] is sin i want to bring it to this
[1:33:26] subject
[1:33:27] at hand
[1:33:31] we've got the scriptures we've got the
[1:33:33] quotes we can read the scriptures
[1:33:40] we'll come to church wednesday night
[1:33:43] some people may wear a mask some people
[1:33:45] not
[1:33:46] it's not my job to judge them they've
[1:33:50] heard the word
[1:33:51] they stand before god they may have a
[1:33:53] medical exemption
[1:33:55] and if i judge them in my heart then all
[1:33:58] of a sudden i'm wrong
[1:33:59] because they're not doing anything wrong
[1:34:04] they they could have a medical reason or
[1:34:06] another reason that i don't know about
[1:34:08] they may be exempt by some order of the
[1:34:10] law that you don't know about and you
[1:34:12] haven't read yet
[1:34:13] judge nobody that's a brother you let
[1:34:16] them
[1:34:17] be judged by their master
[1:34:20] but don't let their choice influence
[1:34:23] your decision
[1:34:28] don't let whether it goes on or comes
[1:34:31] off
[1:34:31] don't let that influence your decision
[1:34:34] let your decision be
[1:34:35] influenced by the word and the
[1:34:37] leadership of god according to the word
[1:34:41] let's not use peer pressure to try to
[1:34:43] build a political party
[1:34:45] amen let's just leave everybody
[1:34:46] completely alone to seek the lord for
[1:34:48] themself
[1:34:49] to read the scripture to read the
[1:34:50] message and decide god judge my heart
[1:34:53] amen am i matching your word or not
[1:34:57] and then let everybody take that
[1:34:58] decision on their own
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:01] and then i would say this statement
[1:35:03] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[1:35:06] and that thing which he alloweth
[1:35:09] don't allow it and be condemned yourself
[1:35:13] make sure that what you're doing see
[1:35:16] like i said for somebody who doesn't
[1:35:19] have
[1:35:19] a medical exemption or some other
[1:35:21] exemption to the law
[1:35:23] and they refuse to wear a mask where
[1:35:25] it's ordered to wear a mask
[1:35:26] they have violated the scriptures
[1:35:29] and that may be okay depending on why
[1:35:33] they violated the scriptures
[1:35:36] but you better know for sure for sure
[1:35:39] for sure for sure that when god asked
[1:35:42] you
[1:35:43] why did you not keep my commandment to
[1:35:46] obey those that rule over you
[1:35:48] your answer will hold up in the face of
[1:35:51] christ
[1:35:53] and that's only something an individual
[1:35:54] can do by themselves nobody else can
[1:35:56] judge that
[1:35:57] for anybody else so don't
[1:36:00] don't condemn somebody if you see
[1:36:02] somebody sitting over in church
[1:36:04] and all of a sudden you see them take
[1:36:05] their mask off don't say what are they
[1:36:07] doing they're rebound
[1:36:08] they may be dizzy
[1:36:11] i mean it may be that simple they may be
[1:36:14] dizzy and require a little oxygen
[1:36:18] don't start judging one another leave
[1:36:21] everybody alone
[1:36:22] we've got enough trouble to judge
[1:36:24] ourselves for me to accurately judge
[1:36:26] myself
[1:36:26] has taken me about 70 hours
[1:36:30] of tears and pain and suffering to
[1:36:33] actually be able to judge
[1:36:34] my own heart how in the world am i going
[1:36:36] to look from across the room in a few
[1:36:38] minutes and judge somebody else
[1:36:42] don't watch each other watch the word
[1:36:45] don't look to the group this is not herd
[1:36:47] mentality
[1:36:48] this is the individual before god
[1:36:52] we we won't answer as a group will
[1:36:54] answer as an individual
[1:36:57] unless you're a father
[1:37:03] brother branham said in choosing of a
[1:37:05] bride
[1:37:06] 1965 the other is pregnant by the word
[1:37:10] of god and will bring forth the body the
[1:37:12] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:37:14] the bride
[1:37:15] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:37:16] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[1:37:18] one and christ is one
[1:37:20] body the word the bride will have to be
[1:37:22] the rest of that body
[1:37:23] and two together will make one body
[1:37:25] again like adam was at the beginning
[1:37:29] man his wife are one now she the true
[1:37:32] bride so sold out to him
[1:37:33] that she uses no mind of her own his
[1:37:36] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:37:40] is his word so what do you think
[1:37:44] friday night and all he said i was
[1:37:45] praying about god what's your will what
[1:37:47] do you want us to do
[1:37:48] what's your will and it was so simple
[1:37:50] his will
[1:37:51] is his word not my feeling
[1:37:55] or not some feeling that i get or think
[1:37:59] or spiritualize but his will is his word
[1:38:06] in another message there's only one way
[1:38:08] provided by god for anything
[1:38:10] his word is always the truth always the
[1:38:12] truth his believing children believe for
[1:38:14] it and cry for it
[1:38:15] until his word is vindicated and his
[1:38:17] word is always his will
[1:38:20] if you want to know what the will of god
[1:38:21] is find it in the bible
[1:38:24] it's god's word anything contrary to it
[1:38:26] is
[1:38:28] perverted
[1:38:31] you know what
[1:38:35] i can say that scripture i can read that
[1:38:37] quote
[1:38:39] because i was looking for a way around
[1:38:43] the word
[1:38:45] and i was looking for god to give me the
[1:38:48] justification around the word
[1:38:50] and i was looking for a scriptural type
[1:38:53] or a bible verse or a quote
[1:38:55] to get around the word and what i needed
[1:38:57] to do is just humble myself and be
[1:38:59] honest with the word
[1:39:01] and be really honest with the situation
[1:39:03] at hand and be really honest with what
[1:39:05] the word says
[1:39:06] what i needed to do was just humble
[1:39:07] myself and die
[1:39:09] and just obey the word because his word
[1:39:11] is his will
[1:39:14] and anything contrary to it is perverted
[1:39:18] i'm so happy today that god stopped me
[1:39:21] because my desire was to pervert the
[1:39:23] word not because i wanted to pervert the
[1:39:26] word but because i hadn't i wanted to
[1:39:27] have my own way
[1:39:28] and in order to have my own way i know
[1:39:31] now that i chadlam me personally would
[1:39:33] have had to pervert the word to have my
[1:39:34] own way
[1:39:37] and that's not what the bride is here
[1:39:39] for
[1:39:40] we're here to stand on the word and the
[1:39:42] word alone
[1:39:44] she must be a word bride he was by the
[1:39:47] word we must be by the word
[1:39:48] he believed every word and act and we
[1:39:50] must believe every word and act on it
[1:39:56] it's god's word anything contrary to it
[1:39:58] is perverted
[1:39:59] and don't don't get into that hybrid
[1:40:02] condition
[1:40:03] what god said that's the truth
[1:40:09] the way up is down
[1:40:14] if you'll be abased in due time you'll
[1:40:17] be exalted
[1:40:21] i don't want to fly so high in
[1:40:23] revelation
[1:40:24] that i can't keep a simple commandment
[1:40:26] of the word
[1:40:29] what good is it if
[1:40:33] the revelation should produce the life
[1:40:35] of jesus christ
[1:40:37] and jesus christ always obeyed the word
[1:40:42] i don't want to be so revelated that i
[1:40:44] come up with a revelated way to deny the
[1:40:47] word
[1:40:48] i want to be so revelated that the abcs
[1:40:51] never change in my life
[1:40:53] that the simple fundamental routine
[1:40:57] building blocks is the word never change
[1:41:00] and i don't circumvent them
[1:41:01] for some mysterious
[1:41:04] explanation i just believe the word
[1:41:08] and stand with the word i can say all of
[1:41:11] this
[1:41:11] because my desire was to do it all my
[1:41:14] human
[1:41:15] my human effort was trying to do all
[1:41:17] that and god stopped me and i thank god
[1:41:19] for it
[1:41:25] let's go to matthew 16.
[1:41:43] matthew chapter 16.
[1:41:46] 24
[1:41:53] then said jesus unto his disciples if
[1:41:56] any man will come after me
[1:41:58] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:42:00] cross and follow me
[1:42:02] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:42:04] lose it
[1:42:05] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:42:07] sake
[1:42:08] shall find it
[1:42:12] i want to lose my life
[1:42:16] i want to die to myself
[1:42:19] i want to stand on his word in his word
[1:42:22] alone
[1:42:25] you know the zealots in jesus day
[1:42:29] they didn't have a bad idea
[1:42:32] you know the zealots what did they want
[1:42:34] to do kick rome out
[1:42:35] kick paganism out re-establish the
[1:42:38] temple
[1:42:40] the vision seemed right
[1:42:43] but they had the wrong timing
[1:42:47] and if the timing was wrong it wasn't
[1:42:49] the will of god
[1:42:50] and the zealots although they had a
[1:42:52] desire unto the temple
[1:42:54] it was a religious desire but it was not
[1:42:56] the will of god
[1:42:58] and they were willing to fight they were
[1:43:00] willing to kill
[1:43:02] for their ideas and it wasn't the will
[1:43:05] of god
[1:43:06] because it wasn't the time of god peter
[1:43:09] got to a place
[1:43:11] where peter so denied the simple
[1:43:14] word of god when jesus looked at him and
[1:43:16] said the son of man will be taken
[1:43:18] and cruelly treated and crucified and
[1:43:20] raised again the third day
[1:43:22] peter denied and said that'll never
[1:43:23] happen to you lord and he was denying
[1:43:25] the word
[1:43:26] but why was he denying the word because
[1:43:29] he loved god or because he loved himself
[1:43:33] it looked like he was denying the word
[1:43:35] because he loved jesus
[1:43:37] but it wasn't a love for jesus that
[1:43:39] caused him to deny the word
[1:43:40] it was a love for himself because he
[1:43:42] believed jesus was coming into his
[1:43:43] kingdom and he was going to be part of
[1:43:45] that
[1:43:47] he had the right idea but in the wrong
[1:43:49] way and selfishness got in the way
[1:43:52] until peter was willing to kill to
[1:43:55] defend his religious ideas
[1:44:04] i said god do something different in me
[1:44:09] different than the way i've lived in the
[1:44:10] past different than my ideas
[1:44:12] strip me down to nothing i want to be
[1:44:16] nothing so that you can just lead me by
[1:44:20] your word so i don't complicate it i
[1:44:21] don't reason it
[1:44:22] that i don't explain it away that i just
[1:44:24] take it and i just obey it
[1:44:27] this is the journey i've been on the
[1:44:28] last few days friends and it's not been
[1:44:31] fun it's been rough
[1:44:32] it's made me sick i've been physically
[1:44:35] sick because of this strain but i wasn't
[1:44:38] wrestling with the lord i was wrestling
[1:44:39] with chad
[1:44:41] until chad died when chad died
[1:44:44] everything got easier as soon as chad
[1:44:47] died and i submitted to the word it was
[1:44:49] amazing how easy
[1:44:50] everything became then you just do it
[1:44:54] no more reasoning thinking about you
[1:44:56] just obey and when you just obey
[1:44:58] it's just so much easier to obey
[1:45:03] don't let don't let
[1:45:06] a commandment to wear a mask steal our
[1:45:09] joy
[1:45:13] so you have to wear a piece of fabric on
[1:45:15] your face
[1:45:17] i don't like it who here likes it
[1:45:21] does anybody really like it like are you
[1:45:23] going to keep doing it when the
[1:45:24] ordinance goes away
[1:45:29] who wanted to do it nobody who likes it
[1:45:32] nobody
[1:45:33] i don't like it you don't like it
[1:45:36] but maybe that's why god taylor made it
[1:45:39] to get us
[1:45:40] to humble ourselves to look at his word
[1:45:43] and to say not
[1:45:44] my will but thy will be done
[1:45:50] i don't want it to take my joy away and
[1:45:53] i'll tell you
[1:45:54] this whole mask mandate took my joy away
[1:45:58] but why i have to put a mask on my face
[1:46:03] but who's going to take the word out of
[1:46:04] my heart
[1:46:07] who's going to change the revelation of
[1:46:09] the word that's climbing higher and
[1:46:11] higher
[1:46:11] who's going to change my position in
[1:46:13] christ who's going to change the
[1:46:14] knowledge of the word that god's given
[1:46:15] us in the understanding of
[1:46:16] christ who's going to take away the
[1:46:18] unveiling of god because they made me
[1:46:20] put a mask on my face
[1:46:22] i'm not going to get down i'm not going
[1:46:24] to grumble i'm not going to complain
[1:46:26] but i'm going to say god be praised
[1:46:28] because nothing has changed with my
[1:46:30] position with god
[1:46:31] nothing has changed with the word that
[1:46:32] he's given me and i'm still
[1:46:34] happy and free because all of these
[1:46:36] things god is using to bring me out of
[1:46:38] here god is perfecting me through every
[1:46:41] trial
[1:46:42] god is honing me down amen through every
[1:46:44] decision through every hardship through
[1:46:46] every temptation god is whittling me
[1:46:48] away
[1:46:49] to rescue me out of this land and i say
[1:46:51] praise be to god
[1:46:53] keep going god
[1:46:57] the judgment of the world is the freedom
[1:47:00] of the bride ones and judgment ones in
[1:47:03] perfection
[1:47:04] when it comes to the exodus amen when we
[1:47:07] go to the exodus journey moses shows up
[1:47:09] and he tells them
[1:47:09] god's going to lead you out
[1:47:13] they hurt him god's going to lead you
[1:47:14] out he's going to take you to a land
[1:47:16] that flows with milk and honey they
[1:47:17] begin to rejoice
[1:47:18] amen they they in the scriptures you
[1:47:20] read it they began to rejoice
[1:47:22] they were so happy and then they went to
[1:47:24] pharaoh and they asked him can we go and
[1:47:26] worship
[1:47:30] and pharaoh says you guys got too much
[1:47:32] time on your hands
[1:47:35] we're gonna we're gonna cause you to
[1:47:38] keep your quota of bricks every day
[1:47:40] but we're gonna take all the straw away
[1:47:42] because you've got too much time on your
[1:47:43] hands
[1:47:44] you're gonna work harder
[1:47:48] god just said he's delivering us
[1:47:52] and now our life got worse
[1:47:57] they cried on the pharaoh pharaoh it's
[1:48:00] not fair it's not
[1:48:01] us it's your people they won't give us
[1:48:02] and he says you be idle
[1:48:04] you have too much time you want to go
[1:48:05] and worship you'll not diminish
[1:48:07] ought of your bricks and you'll not get
[1:48:09] any straw you'll have to go find it
[1:48:11] yourselves
[1:48:11] and they left and they cried to moses
[1:48:13] and moses why is this happening you said
[1:48:15] you're going to deliver us
[1:48:16] immediately after god promised the
[1:48:17] deliverance it got worse
[1:48:22] then moses cried to the lord god why did
[1:48:24] you even say this
[1:48:25] and why did you bring this upon the
[1:48:26] people
[1:48:28] you know what god's answer was
[1:48:32] i will surely bring them out with a
[1:48:34] strong hand
[1:48:37] everything was working in his plan
[1:48:41] he told him i'll bring him out he moved
[1:48:44] pharaoh's heart
[1:48:45] to punish the people the people cried
[1:48:47] out in desperation
[1:48:49] but it was all part of the plan
[1:48:52] it had to go this way
[1:48:56] you think those plagues especially the
[1:48:57] first half of the plagues were pleasant
[1:48:59] for the children of israel
[1:49:00] they were afflicted by the same plagues
[1:49:03] israel was afflicted by do you think
[1:49:06] that was pleasant
[1:49:07] you think that was easy you think
[1:49:08] they're they're asking why why is
[1:49:10] everything getting worse
[1:49:11] why is it getting harder why is
[1:49:13] everything diminishing
[1:49:16] why does it look weaker and why why why
[1:49:19] are the sudden we're under restrictions
[1:49:21] and
[1:49:21] more restriction then they lift and then
[1:49:22] they come back amen and it gets worse
[1:49:25] and it may get worse yet
[1:49:27] why does the bride look so weak
[1:49:33] why do they look so weak why are the
[1:49:36] churches so weak and so feeble and
[1:49:40] hallelujah
[1:49:44] what if god
[1:49:47] will allow a mask mandate
[1:49:52] to get each of us to be honest with
[1:49:54] ourselves
[1:49:56] and honest with the word so that he can
[1:49:59] perfect
[1:50:00] us and purge out some of our own self
[1:50:06] what if by that mandate
[1:50:09] he's bringing us up higher
[1:50:13] what if by the purging and the honesty
[1:50:16] and the obedience to the scripture god
[1:50:19] is drawing us up higher
[1:50:22] i used i was reasoning a couple days ago
[1:50:25] how can you be free in your spirit to
[1:50:26] worship god
[1:50:27] with a mask over your face is that
[1:50:30] really what god wants
[1:50:32] us to be limited in that way
[1:50:36] but as i was meditating i thought what
[1:50:38] if the sweetest verbal praise god wants
[1:50:43] is praise through the muffle of a face
[1:50:45] mask
[1:50:46] but that comes out of an obedient heart
[1:50:52] he want the verbal tone or does he want
[1:50:55] obedience
[1:50:56] from a pure heart
[1:51:01] for me it was obedience
[1:51:05] that's what god wanted out of me for me
[1:51:08] it was obedience
[1:51:10] and i want to give him what he deserves
[1:51:15] i'll give caesar what caesar asks but
[1:51:18] not
[1:51:18] for caesar i'll give caesar what caesar
[1:51:23] asks
[1:51:24] for christ obey every ordinance of man
[1:51:28] for the lord's sake what you do
[1:51:32] not as men pleasers not to please men
[1:51:34] but what you do do it is unto the lord
[1:51:37] and i want to do unto the lord
[1:51:44] if you don't see it the way i see it
[1:51:46] that's fine
[1:51:48] i won't be angry with you i won't be
[1:51:50] upset
[1:51:52] i won't try to persuade you to see it
[1:51:54] the way i see it
[1:51:56] if if you come wednesday and don't wear
[1:52:00] a mask
[1:52:01] i'll say god bless you because obviously
[1:52:05] you have a pure heart you know what
[1:52:06] you're doing you have a medical
[1:52:08] exemption
[1:52:08] god spoke to you directly in some way
[1:52:10] you see another scripture or something
[1:52:12] god bless you i'm not going to judge you
[1:52:15] because i've already judged myself
[1:52:17] and that was the whole point
[1:52:21] the question i have is can we all judge
[1:52:24] ourselves
[1:52:26] can we really be honest and judge
[1:52:29] ourselves
[1:52:31] and can we be happy can we sing
[1:52:36] can we praise the lord because he's
[1:52:37] worthy to be praised can we be in the
[1:52:39] happy in the midst of our trial
[1:52:41] amen can we be happy in the midst of our
[1:52:43] submission
[1:52:44] amen maybe what god wants is just to
[1:52:46] whittle us down
[1:52:48] and break self-will and bring us into
[1:52:50] total submission
[1:52:51] so the bride will quit fighting for
[1:52:53] herself so that he can finally show up
[1:52:55] and fight for us
[1:52:58] maybe he wants us so submissive and so
[1:53:00] broken and so humble
[1:53:02] and so pushed around by the world that
[1:53:04] he's got full justification for coming
[1:53:06] on the scene and doing the miraculous
[1:53:08] because we're not defending ourselves
[1:53:09] anymore and we're not trying to play law
[1:53:12] games and lawyer games and
[1:53:13] and but then we just humble ourselves
[1:53:18] instead of telling the health department
[1:53:19] guy when he shows up say
[1:53:21] try to try to get me in a court of law
[1:53:24] what about the court of god's law what
[1:53:27] about
[1:53:28] god allowing us to be so broken so
[1:53:30] humble
[1:53:31] so pushed around
[1:53:35] what if he's drawing the enemy into his
[1:53:38] trap
[1:53:41] weakening his bride so humble
[1:53:45] so submissive that that anybody thinks
[1:53:48] that they can push her around
[1:53:51] because she'll keep the word at all
[1:53:52] costs she won't take her own will she
[1:53:54] won't fight back
[1:53:55] she won't speak evil she won't take a
[1:53:57] stand where the word doesn't take a
[1:53:59] stand
[1:54:00] so simple so humble that god is drawing
[1:54:03] the enemy into his trap
[1:54:05] and as the enemy gets in and gets in he
[1:54:06] goes so far and god says
[1:54:08] that's exactly the line i was waiting
[1:54:10] for you to cross
[1:54:14] i'm tired of fighting there's no more
[1:54:18] fighting me god fights
[1:54:21] and if god wants to fight through me he
[1:54:23] will but i'm tired of fighting in my
[1:54:26] flesh
[1:54:27] i'm tired of resisting in the flesh i
[1:54:29] just want to submit
[1:54:31] completely to the lord i pray that you
[1:54:35] understand what i'm saying i pray that
[1:54:36] you understand
[1:54:38] that i'm talking about what i went
[1:54:39] through and what i see in the word
[1:54:41] and what i believe to be the truth and
[1:54:43] how it's affected me
[1:54:46] there's no mandate here in the church
[1:54:48] we're not here to enforce anything
[1:54:50] we're not asking anybody to do anything
[1:54:53] against their conscience before god
[1:54:55] we're not asking by to take one position
[1:54:57] or the other and the church is not
[1:54:59] responsible in forcing anything
[1:55:01] and we will not enforce anything
[1:55:05] this is between the individual and god
[1:55:09] we won't judge one another but we'll
[1:55:12] love one another
[1:55:13] and let each one stand before their own
[1:55:15] master
[1:55:17] and let god have preeminence
[1:55:21] let him have preeminence let's all stand
[1:55:25] musicians if you could come
