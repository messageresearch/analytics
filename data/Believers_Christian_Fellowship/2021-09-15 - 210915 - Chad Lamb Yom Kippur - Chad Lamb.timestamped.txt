[6:49] and to hear from you lord what you would
[6:51] speak back to us
[6:53] we pray god now as we turn to the
[6:55] the breaking of bread to the preaching
[6:57] of the word we pray that you would take
[6:58] over lord
[7:00] you would take control of this vessel
[7:01] that's standing here as i surrender
[7:03] myself to you
[7:04] that by the power of your holy spirit
[7:06] you would take this gift
[7:08] you would lift it up lord and you would
[7:09] use it for your glory
[7:11] may you shape your living stones may you
[7:13] feed your sheep may you accomplish all
[7:15] that you desire accomplish
[7:17] in this evening service
[7:19] lord we give ourselves holy and
[7:21] completely unto you
[7:23] may you take preeminence among us
[7:25] in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:28] amen and while you're standing let's
[7:31] take our bibles and go
[7:33] to the book of leviticus chapter 23.
[7:39] leviticus chapter 23
[7:42] and we'll read one portion of scripture
[7:44] out of leviticus
[7:46] and then we'll let you have your seeds
[7:51] leviticus 23 and 27.
[7:55] let me get there myself
[7:57] also on the tenth day
[7:59] of this seventh month there shall be a
[8:02] day of atonement it shall be a holy
[8:04] convocation unto you and you shall
[8:07] afflict your souls and offer an offering
[8:10] made by fire
[8:11] unto the lord god bless you as you have
[8:13] your seats may the lord add his blessing
[8:15] to the reading of the word keep your
[8:16] finger here we're going to we're going
[8:18] to go back to this scripture but
[8:20] i just want to give you an update on the
[8:23] passing of our brother john matthews
[8:25] sunday afternoon brother john passed
[8:27] away and i don't
[8:29] recall exactly what time it was that he
[8:31] passed away but it was in the afternoon
[8:33] and i was quite shocked because i had
[8:35] been to seam on saturday and on saturday
[8:38] was stable
[8:39] every indication that he was going to
[8:41] recover i felt like he was going to
[8:43] recover
[8:44] and
[8:45] and
[8:46] the medical staff did too that he was
[8:48] going to have to wear that mask for a
[8:49] few days
[8:50] but
[8:51] later i learned that somewhere along
[8:53] midnight on saturday night that brother
[8:56] john pulled his iv pulled his mask off
[8:59] and threw it to the side and wouldn't
[9:01] wear it anymore and then sunday
[9:02] afternoon his son-in-law come in and
[9:04] spoke with him and
[9:06] tried to encourage him to wear the mask
[9:08] and saying you're only going to have to
[9:09] wear this for a couple days and you'll
[9:10] be better they put the mask on on
[9:13] brother john and brother john took it
[9:15] off and he laid it to the side he said
[9:16] i'll be okay
[9:18] and that was it
[9:19] and i i realized when i heard that
[9:22] testimony when i heard that shared that
[9:25] our brother just had no desire to fight
[9:27] anymore he just had no will to fight and
[9:30] since his wife wilma had passed away
[9:32] brother john had longed to go to his
[9:33] heavenly home it was his desire to pass
[9:36] over and god gave him the desire of his
[9:38] heart
[9:39] and it's hard to mourn for somebody
[9:42] that wasn't sad for himself amen it's
[9:44] hard to mourn for somebody who got the
[9:47] desire of their heart and so we thank
[9:49] god that he's had that blessed reunion
[9:52] with his wife
[9:53] and he's happy and our brother's free
[9:56] and so they made the arrangements for
[9:58] the
[9:59] visitation and funeral for this friday
[10:01] it's going to be down in urbana the the
[10:03] vernon funeral home
[10:05] but they've they've limited it they
[10:07] wanted to limit it they don't want to
[10:08] have too many people so they asked that
[10:10] it would just be very close friends and
[10:13] family because
[10:15] brother john died of coven and some of
[10:17] the family had different exposure to him
[10:19] they just don't feel like amassing a big
[10:21] crowd right now so it's just going to be
[10:23] for family and those that were close to
[10:25] him
[10:26] but they would like to have a
[10:27] celebration of life memorial service for
[10:30] him later on october 9th here at the
[10:33] church where they can invite everybody
[10:35] we've got room here and by then
[10:37] everything will be settled out and the
[10:39] family will know how the covet issue
[10:41] will settle out so we can have it here
[10:43] october 9th at 10 30 in the morning so
[10:45] we'll be announcing that we'll have it
[10:47] on a flyer already i think out on the
[10:49] bulletin board so keep that in mind so
[10:51] we'll be able to celebrate the life of
[10:53] our brother and share testimonies and
[10:56] preach the word amen and as his family
[10:58] told me we want to have a long service
[11:00] so you can preach because brother john
[11:01] would want to hear preaching
[11:03] i say praise god
[11:05] amen and we'll preach what brother john
[11:08] liked to hear amen he liked to hear the
[11:10] message of the hour the word of this day
[11:12] the present tense truth and so we
[11:14] appreciate the family wants to honor him
[11:16] in that way and that'll be a blessing
[11:18] for us
[11:19] uh i want to go back here to leviticus
[11:21] 23 and pick up here in the scripture we
[11:23] read and there's a reason and some of
[11:25] you might know the reason that i went to
[11:27] the scripture today but leviticus 23 27
[11:31] says also in the tenth day of the
[11:33] seventh month there shall be a day of
[11:34] atonement it shall be a holy convocation
[11:37] unto you and ye shall afflict your souls
[11:40] and offer an offering made by fire and
[11:42] to the lord so we know that this is in
[11:44] the seventh month and this is in the
[11:46] cycle of jewish feast and the feasts
[11:49] they're the not the jewish feasts i'm
[11:50] sorry they're the feast of the lord and
[11:52] the lord established these through moses
[11:54] these seven feasts that would span the
[11:56] first seven months of their calendar of
[11:59] the religious calendar and in the
[12:00] seventh month amen which would be the
[12:02] sixth feast on the tenth day of the
[12:04] seventh month would be the feast of
[12:06] atonement and and they have a name for
[12:09] that called yom kippur and yom kippur
[12:12] means day of atonement and today happens
[12:15] to be yom kippur amen
[12:18] so i thought that was unique and that
[12:20] was kind of amazing and so i was
[12:22] meditating on this and and god was just
[12:24] really dealing with me so the jews are
[12:27] are celebrating yom kippur today but
[12:29] they can't celebrate it in the way that
[12:31] moses told them because they have no
[12:32] temple they have no high priest they
[12:34] have no holy place and on the day of jan
[12:36] capur was the day
[12:38] that the high priest that was selected
[12:40] by god of the right family would
[12:42] approach god the appropriate way and he
[12:44] would make an atonement uh he would make
[12:47] a sacrifice and put blood on the altar
[12:50] on the holy of holies and he would make
[12:52] an atonement for the for the sins of the
[12:54] entire nation
[12:56] and it was a huge event amen in the year
[12:59] because the the israelites the jews were
[13:02] given ways in which they could approach
[13:05] under god and when they had failed and
[13:07] when they had committed transgressions
[13:09] and iniquities they had sacrifices that
[13:12] they could bring amen but the day of
[13:14] atonement wasn't necessarily for those
[13:16] the day of atonement was for the sins of
[13:18] error or the sins of ignorance to cover
[13:21] even the things that the children of
[13:22] israel didn't know they were doing wrong
[13:24] so that they could be right with god
[13:27] so they had a high priest to intercede
[13:29] on their behalf and that high priest
[13:31] would come god's appointed way and he
[13:33] would be the appointed person and he
[13:35] would come with blood on that day and
[13:37] that day only the the day of atonement
[13:40] and he would sprinkle the blood amen
[13:42] upon the mercy seat and when he did that
[13:45] he was he was uh covering that atonement
[13:48] means to cover he was a covering or
[13:50] offering a purification for all of
[13:52] israel for all their sins for the whole
[13:55] year for everything that they did that
[13:56] they weren't even aware that they did
[13:58] and then everybody would wait outside
[14:01] amen they would be all the way outside
[14:03] even the outer court outside the outer
[14:05] curtain amen watching the gate on the
[14:08] eastern side because he was in there
[14:10] atoning for them amen he was in there
[14:13] appeasing god for them he was in there
[14:15] purifying all of their sins and they
[14:18] would watch on that day and when the
[14:20] high priest would go and do the ceremony
[14:22] and do everything he did when he would
[14:24] come in when he would emerge out of that
[14:26] tabernacle and he would step out the
[14:28] people would be relieved for now they
[14:30] know that their sins were gone
[14:33] they knew that they were clean they were
[14:34] covered for they were purified in the
[14:37] eyes of god and this cycle would repeat
[14:39] year after year after year and it would
[14:42] keep the nation of israel covered and
[14:44] clean and purified before god and god
[14:47] would accept them and dwell with them
[14:49] that was the that was the whole premise
[14:52] for setting up the day of atonement in
[14:54] the feast and the sacrifices and all of
[14:56] that
[14:57] but we know it was showing forth
[14:59] something that would come in the future
[15:02] we know that it was a shadow amen
[15:04] showing us bringing us to another
[15:06] reality and so
[15:08] on the day of atonement being probably
[15:10] the the most important day in the year
[15:13] for the israelites as a nation
[15:16] amen they they had this ritual year
[15:18] after year until 70 a.d when the temple
[15:21] was was destroyed and tore down by titus
[15:24] and since then they've been longing to
[15:26] come back because they want to be right
[15:28] with god not realizing that they've
[15:30] missed the high priest that have come to
[15:32] make intercession for them
[15:36] brother graham says in the feast of
[15:38] trumpets he says now there is the
[15:40] calling out time
[15:42] at the sixth seal when it opened the
[15:44] persecution struck the jews in the
[15:46] literal standpoint and here comes the
[15:49] persecution to the church in the
[15:50] ecclesiastical standpoint because the
[15:52] bride is already called
[15:55] the sabbaths are over and ready for the
[15:57] jews to be called whereto the feast of
[15:59] atonement oh church don't you see that
[16:02] called to the feast of atonement to
[16:05] recognize the atonement not no more
[16:07] chickens and geese and what they they've
[16:10] been doing the lamb of god slain from
[16:12] the foundation of the world israel
[16:14] israel is going to know that
[16:16] so brother i'm saying that there's
[16:18] coming a time that they're coming to
[16:19] their feast of atonement
[16:21] they're coming to the true feast of
[16:23] atonement when they're going to
[16:24] recognize what it was all about amen
[16:26] what they had been doing for for
[16:28] centuries centuries and generations with
[16:30] a tradition that they've been upholding
[16:32] what it was pointing to they're going to
[16:34] come and realize that and friends
[16:35] they're going to realize it really soon
[16:39] now as they're over in israel
[16:41] celebrating a yom kippur we know that
[16:43] there's one coming amen and it may not
[16:45] come on the exact day but there's one
[16:47] coming and it's coming through the
[16:49] witness of two prophets amen
[16:52] if we could pull up the white board
[16:53] brother franco i'm going to try to draw
[16:56] squiggly lines and then i'll tell you
[16:57] what they mean
[16:59] i had somebody tell you but the chat
[17:01] when you draw on the right white board
[17:02] if you didn't tell me what you were
[17:03] writing i'd have no idea what you were
[17:04] writing
[17:06] i said well praise god maybe i just do
[17:08] it for myself
[17:10] so i will interpret the squiggly lines
[17:13] but i just want to write down seven
[17:15] numbers
[17:25] so those are going to represent seven
[17:27] months and in this seven month period
[17:30] and
[17:31] god never changes his numbers he's going
[17:33] to complete a cycle of redemption in
[17:36] seven months in these feasts and the
[17:38] feast of the lord there's going to be
[17:39] seven of them but in the first month
[17:44] i'll draw a line here
[17:46] in the first month we're going to have
[17:48] three
[17:49] and it's going to be the feast of
[17:51] passover
[17:55] the feast of unleavened bread
[18:01] how do you spell 11
[18:03] and the feast of first fruits
[18:10] those will be the first three feasts
[18:14] the last three feast
[18:16] over here is going to be the feast of
[18:18] trumpets
[18:23] the feast of atonement
[18:28] and the feast of tabernacles
[18:35] we've been through this many times but
[18:36] i'm just jotting it down so you have a
[18:38] visual aid a memory
[18:40] now in between there's five months the
[18:43] second third fourth fifth and sixth
[18:45] month when you come into the third month
[18:48] here you're going to have another one
[18:50] that's called pentecost
[18:55] and pentecost is weeks pentecost means
[18:58] weeks it's the feast of weeks it takes
[19:00] seven weeks to complete or seven weeks
[19:02] to come to the feast of pentecost but
[19:04] brother branham he does something like
[19:06] this
[19:07] he tells us that in between this time is
[19:10] the feast of pentecost that fills up
[19:12] this gap there's a gap in this feast if
[19:15] you can look at that there's always a
[19:16] gap if you look in prophecy
[19:19] all through the book of revelation
[19:20] there's a gap but in the gap the first
[19:23] part of this he has passover jesus
[19:25] christ comes to be the passover lamb he
[19:27] becomes the unleavened word that will be
[19:29] measured out through seven church ages
[19:31] and he is the first fruits of the
[19:33] resurrection and he he dies on passover
[19:36] day he lays in the grave at the
[19:37] beginning of the feast of unleavened
[19:39] bread and he resurrects on the first day
[19:41] of the week on the feast of first fruits
[19:43] so god does everything according to the
[19:45] pattern that he's laid down and then we
[19:47] know that 50 days later or seven weeks
[19:50] later we come to the feast of pentecost
[19:52] when when the
[19:54] holy ghost descends the pillar of fire
[19:56] comes into the upper room and breaks
[19:58] itself up and they're all have licks of
[20:00] fire when they're all filled with the
[20:01] holy ghost and that feast of pentecost
[20:04] spans those five months or
[20:07] we could look at it this way those
[20:08] number five is grace a measure of grace
[20:11] that has been given to gentiles
[20:14] and then there is going to take the
[20:17] seven the dispensation of the seven
[20:19] church ages are going to take place in
[20:21] this gap amen but at the end of the
[20:23] seven church ages he's going to come
[20:25] back to the feast of trumpets through
[20:27] the feast of atonement and to the feast
[20:29] of tabernacles and brother branham
[20:31] teaches us all of this and he lays it
[20:33] down and he explains all of this to us
[20:36] but but
[20:38] these are the feast of the lord showing
[20:40] redemption and you know we have to come
[20:43] to the passover lamb
[20:46] we have to recognize the unleavened
[20:48] bread of the word that's measured out in
[20:50] each age and we have to recognize that
[20:52] he was the he was the first fruits of
[20:54] the resurrection so it's not it's not
[20:57] that the the gentiles are are banned
[21:00] from this the gentiles partake in these
[21:02] feasts spiritually
[21:05] we partake in all these feasts
[21:06] spiritually and then the feast of
[21:08] pentecost is the grace that's injected
[21:10] in when he turns from the gentiles for
[21:12] rejecting or returns from the jews from
[21:14] rejecting him and now there's been a
[21:16] dispensation of gentiles for seven
[21:19] church ages and then he at the end of
[21:21] that he's going to turn back
[21:24] he's going to turn back to the jews but
[21:26] when as he turns back to the jews he is
[21:28] going to spiritually complete trump its
[21:31] atonement and tabernacles for the bride
[21:35] because we're going to go through that
[21:36] spiritually and then the jews are going
[21:38] to go through that as well amen the
[21:40] church ages won't go through that but
[21:42] those who are called out of the church
[21:43] ages will go through that
[21:47] so brother branham's telling us
[21:50] that we're at this time when he's at
[21:53] feast the
[21:54] feast of the tabernacles
[21:57] he said the sabbaths are over
[21:59] and ready for the jews to be called
[22:02] brother bill i'm telling we've come to
[22:04] the end of the gentile dispensation he
[22:06] keeps telling us that that's what he's
[22:07] saying we're at the end time we're at
[22:09] the end of the denominational age we're
[22:11] we're at the end of the gentile
[22:13] dispensation so we've come to the end
[22:15] the sabbaths are over ready for the jews
[22:17] to be called where to the feast of
[22:20] atonement and what calls them to the
[22:22] feast of atonement amen there's two
[22:24] prophets and those two prophets show up
[22:26] at the feast of trumpets the trumpets
[22:28] are calling the trumpets have been
[22:31] working
[22:32] the trumpets have been working because
[22:34] it's the it's the feast of trumpets that
[22:36] have been gathering the jews in this end
[22:38] time back to the homeland
[22:41] it's been happening for the last 70 some
[22:44] years the feast of trumpets have been
[22:46] having their effect drawing the jews
[22:48] back because those 144 thousand have to
[22:51] be birthed in the homeland
[22:54] so god is now in under this feast of
[22:57] trumpets he's been gathering back his
[22:59] jews and now the jews are in the
[23:02] homeland and they're ready for those two
[23:04] prophets to appear and the two prophets
[23:06] will appear under the seventh trumpet
[23:09] because under the seventh trumpet they
[23:11] will explain the trumpets
[23:14] what god's been doing how god's been
[23:16] gathering why they were dispersed and
[23:18] why all the things happened to them and
[23:20] why they've been gathered back and he's
[23:21] going to show them the grace of god that
[23:23] god has given them grace because they
[23:25] have rejected amen the the rejected the
[23:28] messiah they've been dispersed but by
[23:30] grace they've been regathered and under
[23:32] the seventh trumpet they're going to
[23:33] reveal to them all the trumpets and
[23:36] bring them to the feast of atonement
[23:40] and brother branham said the seven
[23:42] sabbaths the sabbaths are over and ready
[23:44] for the jews to be called
[23:46] he said this in 1964.
[23:50] where to
[23:51] the feast of atonement
[23:53] so brother of them tells us the sabbaths
[23:55] are over
[23:56] the jews are ready to be called
[23:59] where to the feast of atonement
[24:02] and so hold that in your mind
[24:06] it's a church don't you see called to
[24:08] the feast of atonement to recognize the
[24:11] atonement
[24:12] so he's not calling them to a feast of
[24:14] atonement to build a taber
[24:16] a tabernacle or a temple and go back
[24:18] into a holy blaze they're calling them
[24:20] to the feast of atonement to show them
[24:21] that jesus christ was the atonement amen
[24:24] he is atoned for your sins amen and he's
[24:26] done the work of intercession he's
[24:28] immediated for your sins and he's come
[24:30] now so that you can be introduced to the
[24:33] atonement
[24:36] that's what they're coming to
[24:39] he says again in feast of trumpets think
[24:42] of it it's the end time folks hallelujah
[24:44] the great day of the lord is at hand
[24:46] gather yourselves together feast of the
[24:48] messiah they'll reject him and they'll
[24:51] find out that there is
[24:52] that there is their messiah
[24:55] the bible said them striking things like
[24:57] this would take place in revelations 11
[25:00] call their ministry will be the ministry
[25:02] of moses and elias calling to israel out
[25:05] of the jewish traditions
[25:07] so when these two prophets show up
[25:09] they're going to be showing up under the
[25:11] seventh trumpet to explain to them
[25:14] everything just lying mother baby said
[25:16] the seventh trumpet to the jews is the
[25:18] same thing the seventh seal is to us and
[25:20] the seventh seal to us is explaining
[25:23] christ the mystery of god revealed the
[25:25] mystery that laid under those seven
[25:27] thunders for all that time
[25:29] the mystery of the entire bible
[25:32] and the seventh trumpets to them will be
[25:34] the same thing that the seventh seal was
[25:35] to us
[25:37] bringing them to the true atonement
[25:41] now their ministry will be that of moses
[25:43] and elias
[25:45] and we'll be bringing them out of the
[25:46] jewish traditions that's what they were
[25:49] doing today friends
[25:51] today over in israel and around the
[25:53] world they were celebrating the jewish
[25:56] traditions of yom kippur amen and they
[25:58] were going back and reciting prayers and
[26:01] going to the synagogues for for times of
[26:04] prayer and recitations and reading of
[26:06] scriptures but these two prophets are
[26:07] going to come and unveil to them the
[26:09] whole mystery so that they understand
[26:11] what's been going on for the last 2000
[26:13] years and who the messiah really is and
[26:16] they're going to bring them out of that
[26:17] tradition and bring them to the reality
[26:21] because today they had the tradition but
[26:23] soon they're going to have the reality
[26:28] there's a reason we're going into this
[26:29] because what god does for them amen god
[26:32] has done for us amen we've got to look
[26:34] back and see what god has done
[26:37] for us for his bride
[26:39] he's done for us what he's going to do
[26:41] for the 144 000.
[26:44] he said now
[26:46] i'm going to continue on he's calling
[26:48] to israel out of the jewish traditions
[26:51] just as the seventh angel's message
[26:53] called the bride out of the pentecostal
[26:55] tradition
[26:56] remember moses and elijah is to call
[26:58] israel out of the old atonement of the
[27:00] lamb and sheep and blood and goats and
[27:03] sacrifice to the real living sacrifice
[27:06] to the word
[27:08] so what what is this feast of atonement
[27:11] going to be they're going to recognize
[27:13] the word amen not anymore a tradition
[27:16] not any more a symbol amen not something
[27:18] that symbolizes something or foreshadows
[27:20] something they're going to come to the
[27:22] end of all the symbolism and all of
[27:24] foreshadowing and they're going to come
[27:25] face to face to the reality of what
[27:28] every symbol was pointing to
[27:30] what every feast was pointing to and
[27:32] they're going to come face to face with
[27:34] the word
[27:35] which brother bam says is the real
[27:38] living sacrifice
[27:43] and the seventh angel's message brother
[27:45] ben is paralleling these two things
[27:47] together so i want you to catch the
[27:49] parallel
[27:50] because we can say oh there's going to
[27:52] be two prophets show up those two
[27:54] prophets show up is going to show up
[27:55] under the seventh trumpet to reveal to
[27:57] them the trumpets
[27:59] how god redeemed how god brought him out
[28:01] how god watched over him what god did
[28:03] how he got him to the land what god's
[28:05] doing amen the mystery of christ through
[28:07] the bible and you're going to bring him
[28:08] to the feast of atonement which is the
[28:10] real living word the real living
[28:12] sacrifice the word he's going to do that
[28:14] but brother branham is showing a
[28:15] parallel what we can see what's going to
[28:18] happen to them but let's open our eyes
[28:20] and see what's already happened to us
[28:23] this has already happened for us
[28:27] the seventh angel's message under the
[28:29] same trumpet same everything exactly the
[28:32] same seal is to what call the people the
[28:35] bride out of the pentecostal and world
[28:38] tradition to the genuine atonement the
[28:43] what did this prophet come to do in the
[28:45] end time the prophet come to explain to
[28:48] us the trumpets what were the trumpets
[28:50] the seven gospel trumpets amen that were
[28:52] gathering the elect through the church
[28:54] ages he comes and sounds them all and
[28:56] gives us the interpretation begins to
[28:59] show to us that god has been gathering
[29:01] his elect through trumpets
[29:04] and then what does he do after he
[29:06] reveals that he brings us to the real
[29:09] living sacrifice to the word amen no
[29:12] more a church tradition no more a
[29:15] repeating of a word or no more of a
[29:16] going through symbolisms no more going
[29:19] through rituals but he brings us face to
[29:21] face with the real atonement the one
[29:23] that atoned for us the living word amen
[29:26] not a word from long ago but the present
[29:28] tense living word
[29:31] and brings us in contact with the
[29:32] atonement
[29:35] this is why to miss this is to miss
[29:38] everything
[29:39] [Music]
[29:41] because you know we want to say
[29:44] that what worked in previous ages was
[29:46] good and what worked in previously what
[29:48] worked in previous ages was good in the
[29:50] age that it worked in
[29:53] and it was the way god was drawing his
[29:54] people and the way god was revealing
[29:56] himself and the way god was working amen
[29:58] but but now when when we go beyond that
[30:01] and to the next dispensation we cannot
[30:04] rest back in the in the revelation of a
[30:06] previous dispensation and saying all
[30:08] will be well with me all is not well
[30:11] with you because if you don't move into
[30:12] the real living sacrifice the word and
[30:15] then you stay back here you're rejecting
[30:17] the atonement
[30:20] and you're staying impartial and not
[30:22] moving to the fullness and the fullness
[30:24] has come amen we're not waiting it's
[30:26] here amen the real living sacrifices
[30:29] come is among us i mean we've been
[30:31] introduced to the atonement jesus christ
[30:34] the lamb of god alive
[30:36] amen
[30:37] and present
[30:41] and now we cannot rest in previous
[30:43] dispensation
[30:45] and we cannot tell other people you're
[30:47] fine in previous dispensation
[30:51] because god he laid out the plan in the
[30:55] feast amen and god when he laid out this
[30:57] plan was showing that i know exactly
[31:00] what i'm going to do
[31:02] i've already planned that this is my
[31:05] plan of redemption this is how i'm going
[31:07] to re redeem this is the plan this is
[31:10] the pattern so that when it happens
[31:11] you'll recognize that this is me because
[31:14] i've already foreshown the plan
[31:17] and so now we're standing in this day
[31:18] where we can look at the plan and say
[31:20] i've gone through here i've gone through
[31:22] here i've gone through here i've gone
[31:23] through here i've gone where am i
[31:27] i hope by the end of this service you're
[31:29] gonna know where you are in the feast of
[31:31] the lord
[31:34] because we're not jews
[31:38] and we're not pentecostals
[31:41] so where are we
[31:43] if you're not pentecostal
[31:45] then the sabbaths are over
[31:49] the feast of pentecost is over
[31:53] if you're not a jew
[31:55] then you're not in the feast of trumpets
[31:57] because that's where the jews
[31:58] are so what are you
[32:02] i'm bride where's the bride
[32:05] i hope as we go along the lord will
[32:07] reveal it through the prophet
[32:12] the seventh angel's message i'm
[32:14] continuing the same quote from the feast
[32:15] of trumpets
[32:17] the same trumpet same everything exactly
[32:19] the same seals to what to call the
[32:20] people the bride out of the pentecostal
[32:23] world tradition to the genuine atonement
[32:25] the word
[32:27] christ impersonating in his word here
[32:30] made flesh among us
[32:34] what are you looking for
[32:37] the real genuine atonement
[32:39] what is it the word
[32:41] christ
[32:42] impersonating his word here made flesh
[32:45] among us
[32:48] i'm looking for the atonement i'm
[32:50] looking for the atonement brother i've
[32:51] just told you where the atonement has
[32:53] come to now
[32:55] it's the ministry of jesus christ
[32:57] himself the son of man the word amen now
[33:01] a made flesh among us that the the
[33:03] atonement the person of the atonement
[33:05] the lamb of god the word of god amen has
[33:09] returned back into the church
[33:13] that's the real living sacrifice the
[33:14] word that's the genuine atonement the
[33:16] word
[33:17] christ impersonated his word made flesh
[33:19] among us science has proved
[33:22] it by pictures
[33:27] if brother branham says science has
[33:29] proved it by pictures what are you
[33:31] looking for
[33:33] because brother branham's saying it's
[33:35] past it's history amen it's already been
[33:38] proved by the pictures
[33:43] praise god
[33:45] i love the word
[33:47] it's been proved by pictures the church
[33:48] knows it the world around we firmly know
[33:51] it for he's never told us one thing and
[33:53] thus saith the lord but what's been the
[33:54] truth did he not say down there on the
[33:56] river as john the baptist was sent so
[33:58] will this message
[34:00] so he stops there
[34:02] what will this message do forerunner's
[34:04] second coming brother branham's saying
[34:06] the pictures have proved it
[34:09] the atonement has come
[34:12] the person of the word
[34:15] the real living sacrifice
[34:17] has come
[34:19] in the message the indictment
[34:22] the prophet of god says and that's the
[34:23] only place he meets with man today is
[34:25] under the shed blood of the sacrifice
[34:27] see
[34:28] i don't care if you're a methodist
[34:30] baptist presbyterian if you can forget
[34:31] your differences roman catholic whatever
[34:34] you might be and will come under the
[34:36] shed blood god will meet with both of us
[34:38] there that's where we can all meet and
[34:40] fellowship on the same grounds but
[34:42] otherwise he will not meet just because
[34:44] you're a methodist he will not meet just
[34:46] because you're a pentecostals he will
[34:48] meet with you under one condition that's
[34:50] under the shed blood when your sins has
[34:52] been confessed and expelled in his
[34:55] presence then by the blood and the blood
[34:57] is always before him and therefore
[35:00] he only can see you through that shed
[35:02] blood
[35:03] and you're white as snow see when you've
[35:05] confessed your sins otherwise you're not
[35:07] there you cannot fellowship that's the
[35:09] reason that you don't see things
[35:11] happening in the churches they confess
[35:13] that they believe the blood but they
[35:15] reject the very plan to get to the blood
[35:18] the word
[35:20] this is an important statement that
[35:22] brother ben's making he's saying you're
[35:23] seeing in this day why things aren't
[35:25] working amen because they confess we
[35:27] believe the blood we believe the blood
[35:28] you've got to be under the blood you
[35:30] must have the blood the blood of jesus
[35:32] saves us and purify we
[35:34] like all of christianity knows that
[35:37] so you can express to all of christian
[35:40] them and express to them
[35:43] how what's the means of salvation by the
[35:45] blood where's purification under the
[35:46] blood where are my sins washed away
[35:48] under the blood then ask the question
[35:50] how do i get under the blood
[35:53] that's when you'll start to hear a
[35:54] myriad of of answers but i'll tell you
[35:57] how to get under the blood the most
[35:58] simplest way to get under the blood is
[36:00] to believe the word amen
[36:03] to believe him amen to receive him as he
[36:07] is to receive the i am amen
[36:12] so everybody wants to be under the blood
[36:14] by saying i'm under the blood
[36:19] and is god obligated
[36:21] to your definition of under the blood
[36:25] when the churches have rejected the plan
[36:27] to get to the blood
[36:30] which is the word
[36:31] now we're going to find out what this
[36:33] means as we keep moving forward because
[36:36] brother branham is explaining himself
[36:38] through the message
[36:39] like you know sometimes when you're just
[36:41] reading the message and going along
[36:43] brother bennett says some things and
[36:44] they sound so odd especially when you
[36:46] first come to the message and like i
[36:48] don't understand what he means by that
[36:49] statement and i just tell you stay in
[36:52] the message he explains it amen he's got
[36:55] his own way of seeing it in his own way
[36:57] of explaining it and what is he doing
[36:59] he's explaining his revelation of what
[37:01] god has showed him how this word has
[37:04] come to pass what the word is in our day
[37:06] and he's using whatever means he has at
[37:09] his exposure his language and his terms
[37:11] to explain it
[37:13] just keep reading
[37:16] in the message the token
[37:18] he says today is the calling out of the
[37:20] bride out of the church the exodus for
[37:22] the rapture
[37:24] for the church truly goes through the
[37:25] tribulation period as you pentecostal
[37:28] brothers has preached i believe that the
[37:30] church goes through it but not the bride
[37:32] no sir
[37:33] someone discussing that with me not long
[37:35] ago said the church will have to go
[37:37] through for a purification
[37:40] i said that is the truth because she
[37:42] rejected the blood
[37:45] no she doesn't believe she rejected the
[37:48] blood
[37:51] if you go
[37:52] now we don't know who's foolish virgin
[37:54] and not foolish versus not like you can
[37:55] go up to somebody with a label foolish
[37:56] version and ask them a question but
[37:58] just in a way of an analogy if you would
[38:01] ask somebody who was foolish virgin
[38:03] are you under the blood yes i'm under
[38:05] the blood
[38:07] but if you're under the blood you don't
[38:10] wind up in tribulation
[38:13] so if you wind up in tribulation you're
[38:14] not under the blood if you wind up in
[38:16] tribulation you've rejected the blood
[38:21] now they didn't reject that jesus christ
[38:23] died 2 000 years ago for the sins of the
[38:25] world they didn't reject that they
[38:27] didn't reject his blood was the price of
[38:29] redemption that's not what they rejected
[38:31] so what was rejected amen i'll tell you
[38:34] what was rejected the i am was rejected
[38:37] the same one that was in moses's day for
[38:40] salvation the same one that was a noah's
[38:42] day for salvation the same one that was
[38:45] in paul's day for salvation it was
[38:47] always the same one for salvation always
[38:50] the same person always the same means
[38:53] always the same mechanism and is always
[38:56] believing the i am
[39:00] and now they've rejected the i am
[39:04] who is the word
[39:06] they rejected the path to the blood
[39:09] which is the word
[39:11] so she must go through tribulation for
[39:14] purification
[39:16] because he's rejected the blood because
[39:18] the blood is our purification
[39:24] but if the tribulation period catches
[39:26] the bride his own wife in the
[39:27] tribulation no sir
[39:29] the blood of jesus christ has cleansed
[39:31] us from all sin
[39:34] and there is no more purifying
[39:36] and the blood of jesus christ
[39:38] and that token as identification that it
[39:41] has been purified
[39:45] so brother branham is preaching the
[39:46] token and he's showing us
[39:48] that the token is the evidence of the
[39:50] purification
[39:53] we'll get into that too
[39:56] i want to read a quote here out of the
[39:58] invisible union of the bride of christ
[40:01] it says he the bridegroom took away your
[40:03] shame
[40:05] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[40:06] by the washing of the water of the word
[40:09] and the blood of life that's what the
[40:10] bible said your first husband that you
[40:12] were married to the world the anointed
[40:14] bridegroom which for ordained you has
[40:16] washed you by the washing of water
[40:19] what what is the bride received by the
[40:21] blood purification what is the token
[40:23] evidence of that she's been purified how
[40:25] is she going to be purified she brother
[40:28] is telling us in the invisible union how
[40:30] the bride is purified
[40:33] and the difference why the foolish
[40:36] virgin must give their lives in
[40:38] tribulation because they have to give
[40:40] their they have to give their life for
[40:42] purification because they rejected the
[40:43] blood
[40:44] but the bride has been purified by the
[40:47] blood so she does not have to go to
[40:49] tribulation she spared from tribulation
[40:51] because she's been purified by the blood
[40:54] is that clear
[40:55] so let's look at what brother branham
[40:57] says and shows about purification of the
[40:59] bride and invisible union of the bride
[41:02] of christ
[41:04] see he put it in the sea of forgiveness
[41:06] by the washing of water of the word and
[41:08] the blood of life that's what the bible
[41:10] said your first husband that you were
[41:11] married to the world the anointed
[41:13] bridegroom which forward daniel has
[41:15] washed you by the washing of the water
[41:17] by the church congregation says no that
[41:20] don't sound right does it no you might
[41:23] find that in the almanac but not in
[41:24] god's bible by the washing of water by
[41:27] the word in the word see
[41:30] you are standing completely justified as
[41:33] though you never did it at the beginning
[41:35] brother branham was talking about the
[41:36] purification that brings a true
[41:39] justification to the bride and he's
[41:40] talking about a washing of the water of
[41:42] the word and then you have to say but i
[41:45] thought the bride was purified by the
[41:46] blood he hasn't changed his mind
[41:51] amen stay with him
[41:54] i thought it was the blood that's what
[41:56] he's talking about
[41:57] but he's saying word
[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] he's a prophet of god he knows what he's
[42:03] talking about
[42:06] amen
[42:08] by the washing of the water by the word
[42:10] in the word see you are standing
[42:13] completely justified as though you never
[42:15] did it at the beginning this is my
[42:18] message to the church now as we go off
[42:19] the air just in a minute are you
[42:21] standing if you're standing on god's
[42:23] word and with god's word every amen
[42:28] that every
[42:30] every jot every tittle
[42:33] that means the full word
[42:36] where are you standing i'm trying to
[42:38] tell you pull away from them shucks and
[42:40] get out here in the weed where you can
[42:42] get right before the sun i hear the
[42:44] coming of the combine you're standing
[42:46] complete justified like you never did it
[42:48] in the first place hallelujah talk about
[42:50] a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more
[42:53] thankful for that than anything i know
[42:55] you are the pure
[42:57] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[43:00] living god every man and woman that's
[43:02] born of the spirit of god and washed in
[43:04] the blood of jesus christ and believes
[43:06] every word of god stands as though you
[43:08] never sinned at the first place you are
[43:11] perfect
[43:13] he drops down a couple paragraphs and he
[43:14] says you're standing completely
[43:17] you never sinned at the first place
[43:20] god don't even know it's in the sea of
[43:22] forgetfulness you never did it
[43:27] praise god that's how effective this
[43:29] washing is in this end time amen that's
[43:31] what's been given to the bride at the
[43:33] end time that can wash such a
[43:35] purification that a prophet of god can
[43:37] look at you and say this bride if you're
[43:39] standing with the word and you're
[43:40] standing on the word every jot every
[43:43] tittle what's he saying there's no more
[43:45] unbelief amen you're not i'm the an
[43:47] unbeliever of the word but the full word
[43:49] has come and you're standing with the
[43:51] full word
[43:53] you believe it you've received it you've
[43:54] submitted to it he says you're perfect
[43:57] amen and he's not talking about you know
[44:00] the little mistakes that you make and
[44:01] he's not talking about you've come to
[44:03] sinless perfection and you'll never make
[44:05] another blunder brother venom is not
[44:07] talking about that because he says
[44:09] otherwise later
[44:11] but what he's talking about is the
[44:12] condition of your soul your condition
[44:15] before god because you've come to the i
[44:17] am you've come to the atonement amen
[44:20] himself and when you come to that
[44:22] atonement the full word that is coming
[44:24] this day through a prophetic ministry
[44:26] you said that's nothing but the truth i
[44:28] believe it i give my whole life to it
[44:30] and that word washed you from all the
[44:33] sins of unbelief in your life and in
[44:35] your heart and he says you're sinless
[44:37] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[44:39] you never did it in the first place
[44:41] because this original word comes to
[44:43] awaken an original seed inside of you
[44:45] and under the washing of the original
[44:47] word it takes that seed to its original
[44:49] condition and brings it to life and that
[44:52] seed never did it in the first place
[44:55] that seed was part of god part of god's
[44:57] thinking it never was in sin to begin
[44:59] with and the washing of the water of the
[45:01] pure word washes everything away from
[45:03] that seed and springs it to life in an
[45:06] original form which is pure
[45:10] god washes away all the evil all the
[45:13] misconceptions all the wrong doctrines
[45:15] and wrong understandings
[45:18] it brings a purification
[45:22] he's not saying
[45:25] that your flesh is now pure
[45:27] no your flesh is redeemed
[45:32] he's not saying your mind is now pure
[45:35] that spirit will go and be no more
[45:37] someday
[45:39] but what he's saying is i've washed you
[45:41] back to the original
[45:43] this word has washed away all the hybrid
[45:46] this word has washed away all the
[45:48] unbelief and it's quick in that original
[45:50] scene
[45:51] you're perfect
[45:57] he says you never sinned at the first
[45:58] place
[46:00] it's in the sea of forgiveness you never
[46:02] did it you were accused of it by the
[46:04] accuser
[46:06] but really from the beginning you were
[46:07] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[46:09] of god
[46:10] you're standing there washed and your
[46:12] old book of divorcement is put away
[46:14] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[46:18] even in the mind of god
[46:24] when the devil comes and get in your
[46:25] mind it's time for you to get in god's
[46:27] vines
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:29] because in god's mind it's not there
[46:34] praise be to god
[46:38] you're the virtuous bride of christ
[46:41] washed in the blood of christ precious
[46:43] virtuous sinless son of god standing
[46:45] with the pure
[46:47] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[46:50] by the water of his own blood
[46:53] i thought he said he washed it in the
[46:54] water of the word
[46:56] he did
[46:57] now he washed it in the water of his own
[46:59] blood
[47:00] he did how many times you've been washed
[47:02] it's the same washing
[47:06] that become flesh the washing of the
[47:08] water of his own blood
[47:10] that became flesh and manifested that he
[47:12] might take you which were predestinated
[47:14] in the bosom of the father before the
[47:16] beginning the same as he was
[47:20] you catching that
[47:22] why is he doing this so he can come and
[47:24] gather you to himself you who were
[47:27] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[47:29] before the beginning the same as he was
[47:32] you were predestinated the same way he
[47:33] was
[47:37] he was that great attribute of god
[47:40] called love
[47:41] so if he was that great attribute of
[47:43] god called love then you're part of that
[47:45] love
[47:47] and that's why you're a recipient of
[47:48] grace
[47:51] john 1 14 we know it well it says and
[47:53] the word
[47:55] was made flesh
[47:57] that word that was made flesh is the
[47:59] word that became the sacrifice
[48:02] and that word that became sacrifice
[48:05] had the life of the word
[48:08] and it had blood
[48:10] and that that word when it was made
[48:12] flesh had blood had created blood of god
[48:15] in it
[48:17] and when that word was nailed to a cross
[48:20] when that word was beaten when that word
[48:21] was stabbed with the spirit that word
[48:24] bled
[48:27] was jesus christ the word made flesh
[48:30] was he for the full word made flesh
[48:32] what was it all the word at all
[48:34] dispensations in all time made flesh
[48:36] well then if all the word and all times
[48:38] and all dispensations is made flesh
[48:41] then that word bled
[48:46] so when moses begins to preach a portion
[48:49] of the word
[48:52] moses is preaching a portion of the word
[48:55] there's an elect seed that will believe
[48:57] what moses is preaching and by believing
[48:59] what moses is preaching they'll have
[49:01] righteousness imputed unto them
[49:04] and declared righteous not because they
[49:07] do everything perfect but because they
[49:09] believe the i am
[49:13] and so now as time moves on they go and
[49:15] they they lay in a grave amen and now
[49:18] you come to a next dispensation you know
[49:20] in jeremiah's day and in elijah's day
[49:24] you go through each of these
[49:25] dispensations and there was always an
[49:27] elected of god that would believe the
[49:29] present tense word the i am and they
[49:31] would believe that and then
[49:33] righteousness would be imputed unto them
[49:35] and then they would lay away in a grave
[49:37] and they were laying there waiting for
[49:38] something amen they were waiting for
[49:41] that word that they believed to bleed
[49:43] for them
[49:46] what
[49:48] what was bleeding on the cross the word
[49:51] that they believed in this day was made
[49:53] flesh in that vessel
[49:55] the thing that they they saw as god the
[49:57] thing they said that's the truth the
[49:59] thing they said i'll give my life for
[50:01] the thing that they stake their
[50:02] salvation on the very thing that they
[50:04] recognize is the i am the word of god
[50:06] amen my portion they grabbed a hold of
[50:09] that they believed it with all their
[50:11] heart amen and when they believed it
[50:12] with all their heart that word that they
[50:15] believed became flesh one day and was
[50:18] nailed it was a sacrifice and that word
[50:20] bled for them
[50:24] and because they believed that word when
[50:26] it bled for them they were atoned for
[50:30] and that's why when jesus resurrected
[50:32] all those saints who believed the i am
[50:34] resurrected with him
[50:36] because now the word that they believed
[50:40] now was shedding blood
[50:44] i hope you understand this i hope it's
[50:45] not too far
[50:47] too abstract to catch the word that they
[50:50] were believing was now paying a price of
[50:53] redemption
[50:54] was now becoming purification to cover
[50:57] for all of them amen and now because the
[51:00] word that they believed had been made
[51:02] flesh and died for them now when jesus
[51:04] resurrected they resurrected because
[51:07] everything was paid for
[51:10] in christ
[51:16] that's why
[51:21] oh i don't want to get into that right
[51:23] now i'll get that to a minute
[51:28] in the invisible union again he says
[51:30] what is sin
[51:32] sin is unbelief
[51:34] and what the word unbelief in god which
[51:37] is the word
[51:39] that's as simple a definition as we can
[51:41] get
[51:43] can't simplify it that's it
[51:46] pure
[51:47] unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon
[51:49] for the skies
[51:51] amen standing ready think your garments
[51:53] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[51:56] the word become blood
[51:59] the word bled for you
[52:03] you understand that now now do you
[52:05] understand what brother branham's saying
[52:06] the word bled for you
[52:09] so the word of justification that
[52:11] luther's day would believe in was
[52:12] bleeding on the cross
[52:15] and that word was bleeding for them
[52:17] because come down the road there's going
[52:19] to be a dispensation of time when god is
[52:22] going to open a seal and break a
[52:24] revelation to a church age messenger and
[52:26] it's going to be the revelation of
[52:28] justification by faith and justification
[52:30] by faith already bled
[52:34] so when they come to the dispensation
[52:37] where god opens justification by faith
[52:39] that is the i am that is the word for
[52:42] their day that is the present tense word
[52:46] and when the elect of god see it they
[52:48] say that's nothing but the truth i'll
[52:50] sacrifice my whole life i'll stake
[52:52] everything i have on that truth and when
[52:54] they when they sacrificed everything
[52:56] they had on that truth that word had
[52:58] already bled for them already purified
[53:00] them and now they come into their
[53:02] purification by the blood by the washing
[53:05] of the water of this word that had
[53:08] already bled for them
[53:13] this is why brother brahm says what he
[53:15] says
[53:16] he says why he's using the terminology
[53:18] he's using
[53:20] that's why in luther's day you could not
[53:23] reject luther's message
[53:26] because it was the i am
[53:28] it was the fountain that was open in
[53:30] that day for washing and cleansing and
[53:32] purification
[53:35] in wesley's day there was a message of
[53:38] sanctification that broke open god had
[53:40] broken another seal of revelation and
[53:43] now the church age messenger was giving
[53:44] out another dispensation of truth and
[53:47] that was another part of the word that
[53:49] had held on calvary
[53:52] i hope we don't look at the word as
[53:54] black words on paper and say i gotta
[53:56] agree with this doctrine and agree that
[53:58] the word is a person amen the word is
[54:00] god amen god was the word the word was
[54:02] with god the word was god amen we're not
[54:05] talking about we're not talking about
[54:07] fragments of sentences and
[54:08] pronunciations and things that come off
[54:10] of human lips we're talking about the
[54:12] very thoughts of god when they're moving
[54:13] in the manifestation is the word
[54:16] and it is god amen and it you cannot
[54:19] reject god
[54:23] and now this word
[54:26] bled
[54:28] for us
[54:31] so that when the word was presented to
[54:33] us
[54:35] and whatever day that we live the
[54:38] portion of the word that was coming
[54:39] forth the part of the fountain that had
[54:41] sprung open and now was spurting out
[54:43] clean water for purification now the
[54:46] place to receive purification from
[54:48] stands is under that fountain
[54:53] well brother branham would call the
[54:54] fresh kill of the word
[54:58] where the blood is
[55:01] because if that word had already bled
[55:02] and now that word is coming into its
[55:04] manifestation and it sees it and it's
[55:06] opening up a fresh kill of the word with
[55:09] blood in it
[55:16] he says
[55:20] i want to read this again on an
[55:21] invisible union of the bride of christ
[55:23] so we can catch him
[55:24] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[55:28] the word become blood
[55:30] the word bled for you
[55:32] and you are washed and bleeding word the
[55:34] word bleeding
[55:38] the life of god in the word and the word
[55:40] was bled for you so the life of god was
[55:42] in the word
[55:44] and the word bled for you that you might
[55:46] be washed from the filth of these
[55:48] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[55:50] sanctified by the washing of the water
[55:52] of the word and makes your mind and
[55:55] heart stayed on god
[55:57] and on his word
[56:00] we have to be washed
[56:02] we have to be washed of the filth of the
[56:04] prostitute spirits
[56:07] but we have to be washed by the bleeding
[56:10] word
[56:13] now let's turn to first john chapter one
[56:33] i hope all of these things that the
[56:34] prophet has said over the years become
[56:36] richer and richer and clearer and
[56:38] clearer as we keep moving on
[56:41] first john 1 7
[56:43] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[56:46] the light we have fellowship one with
[56:48] another and the blood of jesus christ
[56:50] his son cleanses us from all sin
[56:53] so where does this washing and cleansing
[56:55] take place if we walk in the light as he
[56:58] is in the light
[57:00] so as he is in the light as present
[57:03] tense i am
[57:04] so wherever the light is we walk in the
[57:07] light as he is in the light amen the
[57:09] present tense word the present tense
[57:11] illumination the present tense
[57:13] revelation if we walk in the light as he
[57:16] is in the light then we have fellowship
[57:18] one with another and the blood of jesus
[57:20] christ cleanses us from all sin
[57:23] why because the light is the word
[57:26] and the word bled for us
[57:28] and if we walk in the light as he's in
[57:30] the light there's a fountain of blood
[57:31] that's flowing for cleansing
[57:35] these aren't just odd statements it's
[57:37] all it's all
[57:38] leading to the same thing amen
[57:42] brother brahma says in the message
[57:43] there's a man here that can turn on the
[57:45] light
[57:46] and to you man that's listening to this
[57:48] across the world wherever you may be
[57:50] there is something wrong with your
[57:52] experience when you say that you love
[57:53] god and refuse his word
[57:55] there is something you refuse the very
[57:57] no wonder the things the church is in
[57:59] its condition and things cannot be done
[58:01] as god promised is because you won't
[58:02] even receive the word or walk in the
[58:04] light
[58:06] the bible says let us walk in the light
[58:07] as he is in the light then the blood of
[58:09] jesus christ god's son cleanses us from
[58:11] all sin sin is unbelief
[58:15] brother branham he comes back to this
[58:17] and he's using this scripture and he's
[58:19] not talking about it's going to cleanse
[58:21] you from smoking and cleanse you from
[58:23] bad language and cleanse you from all of
[58:24] that those are all side effects of sin
[58:28] those are all things that are hanging on
[58:30] to sin but if we walk in the light as he
[58:33] is in the light so we walk in revelation
[58:35] as he is in present tense revelation
[58:37] walking in the presence of the i am amen
[58:40] then the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[58:42] us from all sin sin is unbelief why are
[58:45] you cleansed from unbelief because
[58:46] you're receiving the word for your day
[58:49] you're not disbelieving god the i am
[58:51] when he's made manifest before you you
[58:54] now you are free from unbelief amen
[58:57] because you have believed god and it's
[59:00] imputed unto you for righteousness
[59:10] then
[59:12] continue on the same quote
[59:14] then if we are walking in the god-given
[59:16] light of the hour then god takes that
[59:19] word that's given for the hour and
[59:21] vindicates
[59:23] for walking in god-given light of the
[59:26] hour
[59:27] that's so key
[59:30] and the message the token he says as we
[59:31] see the great end time signs on the
[59:33] earth today we know
[59:35] that that's right
[59:37] that that's right now look i've waited
[59:39] for this for a long long time for this
[59:42] message to you
[59:44] what message the token
[59:47] brother branham's waited for a long long
[59:49] time to preach the token
[59:52] he could not preach the token until this
[59:54] time
[59:55] when's he preached a token he preaches
[59:57] it september 1st
[59:58] 1963.
[1:00:00] what happened in 1963 in 1963 you have
[1:00:03] the cloud appear you have brother brown
[1:00:05] get caught up in a constellation of
[1:00:06] angels you have the opening of the seven
[1:00:08] seals the preaching of the seven
[1:00:09] thunders you have christ as the mystery
[1:00:11] of god revealed you have the indictment
[1:00:13] and now he comes along after all this
[1:00:15] has transpired something has shifted
[1:00:17] dynamically in the first part of 1963
[1:00:21] and after a dynamic dispensational shift
[1:00:23] he comes and he said i've waited a long
[1:00:25] long time to preach this but now i'm
[1:00:27] going to preach the token
[1:00:32] so what is the token
[1:00:34] it's the literal life of jesus christ in
[1:00:36] you
[1:00:38] he said i've had to wait to preach this
[1:00:41] to wait for this dynamic shift
[1:00:44] to take place
[1:00:47] i've waited this for a long long time
[1:00:48] for this message to you and you've seen
[1:00:50] the end time signs and i've preached it
[1:00:52] to you and showed it to you but
[1:00:54] everything that christ said is that
[1:00:56] right
[1:00:57] you'll admit that we're at the end time
[1:00:59] i don't see nothing left
[1:01:01] so this is the time that brother brenham
[1:01:03] can preach the token
[1:01:05] we've come to the end time
[1:01:08] i don't see nothing left now we can
[1:01:10] preach the token
[1:01:14] again in the token he preaches in 1964 a
[1:01:17] different token message he says there
[1:01:18] you are
[1:01:20] the blood the blood the token not the
[1:01:22] blood chemistry
[1:01:24] but the token the holy ghost the life
[1:01:27] out of the blood
[1:01:29] not the chemistry amen in in a token
[1:01:33] he's always typing with the passover
[1:01:35] amen when they took the passover lamb
[1:01:36] and they slayed and they took the blood
[1:01:37] and they painted on the on the lentil in
[1:01:40] the doorpost amen it was a sign that a
[1:01:42] lamb had died and there was an outward
[1:01:44] sign on the outside of this house that
[1:01:46] there's now an application of blood
[1:01:49] showing that the lamb has died for this
[1:01:51] house and we are inside feasting on the
[1:01:53] lamb that's what all of that represented
[1:01:55] so the token was the blood on the
[1:01:57] outside showing that a lamb had died for
[1:02:00] this house and they were eating the lamb
[1:02:03] that's what the token meant and brother
[1:02:05] branham's preaching a token that can
[1:02:07] only be preached at the end time when
[1:02:08] there's nothing else left
[1:02:11] and that token is going to be a display
[1:02:14] amen that in this house a lamb has died
[1:02:17] for this house and in this house they're
[1:02:19] feasting on the lamb
[1:02:22] and that house is you
[1:02:28] he said
[1:02:30] the token not the blood chemistry so now
[1:02:33] brother behind saying not the chemistry
[1:02:35] that came out of the blood that
[1:02:36] chemistry that came out of jesus veins
[1:02:39] brother branham said it dripped into the
[1:02:41] judean soil and went back to the
[1:02:43] elements it came from
[1:02:46] so when you talk in a denomination a way
[1:02:48] about an application of the blood
[1:02:50] what blood
[1:02:54] how is it applied
[1:02:56] where do you get it and how do you put
[1:02:58] it on yourself
[1:03:00] how do you strike it on the lenthil in
[1:03:02] the doorpost when that blood that was
[1:03:05] shed went into the judean soil and
[1:03:07] turned back into the minerals is made
[1:03:08] out of what blood are we talking about
[1:03:11] to have an application it's not the
[1:03:13] chemistry of the blood it was the life
[1:03:15] that was in that blood and that blood
[1:03:18] when it was broken and shed released the
[1:03:20] life which was the life of god and that
[1:03:22] life came back at pentecost and broke
[1:03:25] itself up in the tongues of fire and
[1:03:27] went into his body amen which is the
[1:03:29] church and now they have the literal
[1:03:32] life of jesus christ
[1:03:36] but the church would begin to fall amen
[1:03:38] and compromise on the word
[1:03:41] and we know
[1:03:42] that the holy ghost is the life of the
[1:03:45] word
[1:03:47] and the blood life is the life of the
[1:03:49] word
[1:03:50] the blood the word was made flesh and
[1:03:53] blood but the life in that blood was the
[1:03:55] life of the word
[1:03:58] so the life of the word when you begin
[1:04:01] to compromise on the word you begin to
[1:04:05] limit the life of the word
[1:04:09] brother brahm says this we're going to
[1:04:10] get into it so as the church ages begin
[1:04:13] to fall under nicholatenism and man
[1:04:15] began to rule over the church and begin
[1:04:17] to compromise on the word and change it
[1:04:20] what they were doing is they were
[1:04:21] limiting the life that was in the blood
[1:04:24] from the people
[1:04:26] brother benham tells us that the holy
[1:04:28] ghost has been bound by these
[1:04:29] denominational rivers but it's going to
[1:04:31] be loose what bound the holy ghost it
[1:04:34] was the denominational rivers
[1:04:39] so there had to be a time at the end
[1:04:41] time when there was nothing else left
[1:04:43] that brother branham could preach the
[1:04:44] token
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:46] that life back in the house on the house
[1:04:51] not limited
[1:04:52] but in fullness
[1:04:55] the blood the chemistry but the token
[1:04:56] the holy ghost the life out of the blood
[1:04:58] that comes what does that life does
[1:05:00] comes and confirms what the token has
[1:05:03] been purchased for
[1:05:04] the token confirms the blood bought you
[1:05:06] bought for you the blood purchased your
[1:05:09] redemption the token is the evidence of
[1:05:11] it the blood he was wounded for our
[1:05:13] transgression bruised for our iniquity
[1:05:15] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:05:17] him and with his stripes we were healed
[1:05:19] see all blood blood blood then when the
[1:05:22] token comes it shows that you've been
[1:05:24] identified with that sacrifice
[1:05:29] again in another token message
[1:05:32] 1964 he says now therefore the blood
[1:05:34] itself understand now
[1:05:36] the red chemistry chemicals of the blood
[1:05:38] had to stand out on the door as a token
[1:05:41] that the lamb had died now because the
[1:05:43] life of the lamb could not come back on
[1:05:44] the human worshiper but today see it was
[1:05:47] only a type today it isn't the chemical
[1:05:50] blood of the lord jesus our lamb but
[1:05:52] it's the life that was in that blood
[1:05:54] which is the holy ghost
[1:05:57] which is the life of the word
[1:06:02] it comes back and is the token that you
[1:06:04] have accepted and did exactly what god
[1:06:06] told us to do and then by having the
[1:06:08] token we are identified with our
[1:06:10] sacrifice perfectly i don't see how
[1:06:12] anything more could be any plainer
[1:06:15] then in the token and preached in
[1:06:17] september of 63
[1:06:19] he says the lamb was killed in the
[1:06:21] evening time
[1:06:23] after being kept up for 14 days and then
[1:06:25] the lamb was killed and the blood was
[1:06:27] applied in the evening time you get it
[1:06:29] the token never come into existence
[1:06:32] until the evening time
[1:06:34] now brother branham is trying to show us
[1:06:37] this is the evening time amen it shall
[1:06:39] be light in the evening time this is the
[1:06:42] time of the setting of the sun on the
[1:06:44] gentile dispensation this is the time of
[1:06:47] the evening time amen for the for this
[1:06:49] world amen the evening time for the
[1:06:52] denominationalism the evening time
[1:06:55] but the token never come into existence
[1:06:57] until the evening time
[1:06:59] and this is the evening time of the age
[1:07:01] that we live in this is the evening time
[1:07:03] for the church this is the evening time
[1:07:05] for me this is the evening time of my
[1:07:07] message i'm dying i'm going i'm moving
[1:07:09] out in the evening time of the gospel
[1:07:11] and we've come up through justification
[1:07:13] and so forth but this is the time that
[1:07:15] the token has to be applied
[1:07:20] brother braham said it come into
[1:07:21] existence in the
[1:07:22] evening time
[1:07:24] what is the token
[1:07:26] the life of jesus christ in you
[1:07:29] manifesting out from you
[1:07:32] a sign
[1:07:34] that you've been
[1:07:36] a a recipient of that blood
[1:07:39] that you've been identified with your
[1:07:40] sacrifice that you've been purged and
[1:07:42] you've been cleaning
[1:07:46] he says again in the token it's been the
[1:07:48] lamb all the way through
[1:07:50] it was the lamb and luther's time it was
[1:07:52] the lamb in wesley's time but now
[1:07:55] is the token time
[1:07:58] that each house must be covered by the
[1:08:00] token
[1:08:02] brother man makes an interesting
[1:08:03] statement he said it was the lamb and
[1:08:05] luther's time and it was the lamb in
[1:08:07] wesley's time
[1:08:09] and
[1:08:10] and what's different about that than our
[1:08:12] time
[1:08:14] was it not the lamb now yes it's the
[1:08:16] lamb it's the life of the lamb
[1:08:19] they in luther's time was looking back
[1:08:21] to the lamb
[1:08:23] wesley's time was looking back to the
[1:08:25] lamb
[1:08:26] but now the life of the lamb has come
[1:08:30] not impartial but in fullness the full
[1:08:32] life of the lamb has come now it's token
[1:08:35] time it's not partial time it's the life
[1:08:38] that was released when that blood was
[1:08:39] shed now when the fullness has been
[1:08:41] unlocked and unleashed to come back upon
[1:08:44] the church again
[1:08:46] and he says this he says now
[1:08:50] now it's token time that each house must
[1:08:51] be covered by the token each house of
[1:08:53] god must be covered by the token all
[1:08:56] that's inside of it must be covered by
[1:08:57] the token and the house of god is the
[1:09:00] body of jesus christ and by one spirit
[1:09:02] we're all baptized into this token and
[1:09:04] become part of it that god said when i
[1:09:06] see this token displayed i'll pass over
[1:09:08] you what an hour that we're now
[1:09:11] living
[1:09:13] so the token
[1:09:15] must cover your house
[1:09:19] my house
[1:09:22] let's go to leviticus 25.
[1:09:25] just have a couple more things i'd like
[1:09:27] to read as we wrap up
[1:09:30] leviticus 25.
[1:09:44] leviticus 25
[1:09:46] and i'm going to read verse 9.
[1:09:50] then shall thou cause the trumpet
[1:09:53] of the jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[1:09:56] of the seventh month in the day of
[1:09:57] atonement
[1:09:58] shall you make the trumpet sound
[1:10:00] throughout all your land
[1:10:03] every
[1:10:04] seven
[1:10:05] sabbaths or every 50 years
[1:10:09] there would be a special day of
[1:10:11] atonement
[1:10:13] and on this day of atonement they would
[1:10:15] blow the jubilee trumpet and when they
[1:10:17] blew the jubilee trumpet it was a sign
[1:10:19] of freedom everything that was bound or
[1:10:22] enslaved or all of your inheritance that
[1:10:24] had been sold now comes back to its
[1:10:26] rightful owner so not every atonement
[1:10:29] did that but after after 50
[1:10:32] years then on the day of atonement when
[1:10:35] the high priest would go in and when he
[1:10:38] would pay the price and he would cover
[1:10:40] for the sins of air then there would be
[1:10:42] a blowing of a jubilee trumpet and now
[1:10:45] everybody that had been sold in slavery
[1:10:46] goes free
[1:10:48] and everybody that had sold their land
[1:10:50] and given up part of their inheritance
[1:10:52] they get it all back amen so there's a
[1:10:54] special atonement that comes every once
[1:10:57] in a while and that atonement comes with
[1:10:59] a jubilee
[1:11:02] this is what the jews are about ready to
[1:11:04] get
[1:11:05] they're about to come through the feast
[1:11:07] of trumpets through those two prophets
[1:11:08] those two prophets are going to bring
[1:11:10] them through the feast of trumpets and
[1:11:11] bring them to the feast of atonement and
[1:11:13] this is a feast of atonements going to
[1:11:15] be a special atonement friends it's
[1:11:17] going to be the feast of atonement with
[1:11:19] a jubilee trumpet and everything they
[1:11:21] lost given us been taken from them it's
[1:11:23] all going to be restored to them in this
[1:11:25] atonement
[1:11:29] but remember what we can see will happen
[1:11:31] for them has already happened to us
[1:11:33] friends there's already been a feast of
[1:11:35] atonement in this day there's been a
[1:11:37] trumpet blast that's went forth and that
[1:11:39] trumpet blast is restored to us all the
[1:11:41] denominations are taken away all of our
[1:11:43] inheritance that we're lost and all the
[1:11:45] slavery that we've been bound in under
[1:11:47] traditions of men and dogmas of men we
[1:11:49] have been set free under this atonement
[1:11:51] that has come in this day
[1:11:58] brother branham says in the feast of
[1:12:00] trumpets he said the holy spirit has
[1:12:01] been bound by these denominational
[1:12:03] rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to
[1:12:07] be loosed in the evening time by the
[1:12:09] evening time message the holy spirit
[1:12:11] back in the church again christ himself
[1:12:14] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:12:17] time he said he promised it
[1:12:21] listen when they were sitting there on
[1:12:23] yom kippur and today being yom kippur
[1:12:27] they would sit outside the tabernacle in
[1:12:30] the wilderness and they would watch the
[1:12:32] gate that was to the east and they were
[1:12:34] watching for that high priest to come
[1:12:35] out because he had to go in that high
[1:12:38] priest was not a perfect high priest so
[1:12:39] he had to go twice first to offer for
[1:12:41] himself so that he could be purified and
[1:12:43] then he would take the offering in for
[1:12:45] the people
[1:12:47] so he would go in once and they would
[1:12:48] watch him come out then they were
[1:12:49] relieved because now he's going to be an
[1:12:51] intercessor for us
[1:12:54] then he would go back in and that's when
[1:12:56] they would hold their breath because if
[1:12:57] he didn't if god did not accept it then
[1:13:00] they were not accepted
[1:13:02] if god did not accept the atonement then
[1:13:04] their sins weren't atoned they still
[1:13:06] were bearing their sins they were not
[1:13:07] free so they would watch for him to come
[1:13:10] and when when he would begin to come
[1:13:11] amen he was coming from the west to the
[1:13:14] east because they were standing on the
[1:13:16] east watching the gate there's to the
[1:13:18] east they were standing there watching
[1:13:19] him come from the west to the east and
[1:13:21] when he would come out then all of a
[1:13:23] sudden the relief we're free we're free
[1:13:25] we're free you can sound the jubilee our
[1:13:28] sins are covered for we are clean we are
[1:13:30] purified we are free
[1:13:34] in 1963
[1:13:36] brother branham heard a blast that came
[1:13:38] out of the west coming to the east
[1:13:41] and he saw a constellation of seven
[1:13:43] angels and what appeared in the seven
[1:13:45] angels when he was told to turn the
[1:13:47] picture to the right he turned and he
[1:13:49] said it's jesus christ he said it's our
[1:13:51] lord up there amen everybody was back
[1:13:54] east he left all the brethren back east
[1:13:59] what were they watching for
[1:14:01] they were watching from melchizedek to
[1:14:02] come again from behind the veil and when
[1:14:05] melchizedek come from behind the veil
[1:14:07] you can say i'm free i'm free i'm free
[1:14:11] this is my atonement i am covered all
[1:14:13] the sins of ignorance all the sins of
[1:14:16] unbelief it's all been atoned for now
[1:14:18] and i'm free the atonement is coming to
[1:14:20] me
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:27] brother banham preached to us the
[1:14:29] trumpets the seven gospel trumpets
[1:14:32] to bring us to the feast of atonement in
[1:14:34] 1963 when melchizedek would come back
[1:14:36] from behind the veil
[1:14:39] when the lord himself would come showing
[1:14:42] that our our sins of ignorance have been
[1:14:44] atoned for
[1:14:46] all the ignorance to the church ages and
[1:14:48] all the misconceptions and not even
[1:14:50] knowing where we were before the
[1:14:51] foundation of the world or what happened
[1:14:52] in the garden of eden or what where who
[1:14:55] we really are and the attribute of god
[1:14:57] and where we're really going all the
[1:14:59] misunderstanding he come out from behind
[1:15:01] there and said it's all been paid for
[1:15:03] it's all been covered now this is a
[1:15:05] jubilee atonement
[1:15:08] everything you're lost comes back to you
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:13] and from that atonement
[1:15:16] he comes to feast the tabernacles
[1:15:20] because where did that high priest go
[1:15:24] did he go back
[1:15:26] that high priest now came into
[1:15:28] tabernacles of flesh
[1:15:30] he came into your booth in my booth our
[1:15:32] tabernacles of flesh to dwell on this
[1:15:35] earth in his body now many mini-membered
[1:15:37] body
[1:15:40] we go to levitt leviticus 23
[1:15:44] and 34.
[1:15:46] read this
[1:15:50] speaking to the children of israel
[1:15:52] saying the fifteenth day of the seventh
[1:15:54] month shall be the feast of tabernacles
[1:15:56] for seven days unto the lord
[1:15:59] on the first day shall be a holy
[1:16:00] congregation you shall do no servile
[1:16:02] work therein
[1:16:03] seven days you shall offer an offering
[1:16:05] made by fire unto the lord and on the
[1:16:08] eighth day shall be a holy convocation
[1:16:10] unto you and ye shall offer an offering
[1:16:12] made by fire unto the lord
[1:16:14] it is a solemn assembly and you shall do
[1:16:16] no servile work
[1:16:18] therein
[1:16:20] at the end of the seven days there's an
[1:16:22] extra day
[1:16:24] a great day
[1:16:25] it's called in john 7 the great day of
[1:16:27] the feast
[1:16:28] when jesus stood up in the midst in the
[1:16:30] temple and cried all who are thirsty
[1:16:32] come to me and drink and out of thy
[1:16:34] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:16:37] that was on this eighth day this great
[1:16:39] day
[1:16:41] brother ram says in the message the
[1:16:43] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:16:45] and the earthly bride
[1:16:47] he says
[1:16:49] to an old man and an old woman don't you
[1:16:51] be discouraged
[1:16:53] if you are represented up here in this
[1:16:55] attribute of god this god if you have it
[1:16:58] if you're represented here you cannot
[1:17:00] you're in the eternal and you've crossed
[1:17:02] from the seventh day into the eighth
[1:17:07] are you in god
[1:17:09] is god in you
[1:17:11] have you crossed from the seventh day to
[1:17:12] the eighth oh praise god moved out of
[1:17:15] the card onto the supernatural moved out
[1:17:17] of time into eternity that's what's been
[1:17:19] made available at the end of this
[1:17:21] dispensation of time
[1:17:25] he says now
[1:17:26] if you cross from the seventh day into
[1:17:28] the eighth you got into the eternal by
[1:17:30] the baptism of the holy spirit you're
[1:17:32] included in this
[1:17:33] now if you're just trusting upon a
[1:17:35] sensation or jumping up and down or do
[1:17:37] this i keep my sabbath day i don't eat
[1:17:38] meat and things like that that's going
[1:17:40] to perish anyhow see
[1:17:42] but this is the eternal this is the
[1:17:44] eternal the feast after the feast of
[1:17:46] tabernacles
[1:17:48] what's the feast after the feast that
[1:17:49] eighth day feast the eighth day brings
[1:17:51] you into eternity or back to the first
[1:17:53] day again or back to original life
[1:17:58] the feast of tabernacles was the last
[1:18:00] feast the seventh feast
[1:18:02] we are worshiping now under the feast of
[1:18:05] tabernacles the seventh church james
[1:18:08] that's what the prophet said
[1:18:11] so where are we at
[1:18:13] at the end of the seven dispensations
[1:18:16] in the seventh church age
[1:18:19] the seventh month the seventh church age
[1:18:21] at the end of the sabbath
[1:18:23] you come to trumpets
[1:18:25] the seven gospel trumpets
[1:18:27] you come to atonement melchizedek coming
[1:18:30] out behind the veil
[1:18:32] and you come to tabernacles
[1:18:35] god dwelling in vessels
[1:18:41] and at the end of the seventh
[1:18:43] that great day
[1:18:46] jesus cries with a loud voice all that's
[1:18:48] thirsty
[1:18:49] come to me amen
[1:18:52] why did he cry it because he was there
[1:18:56] he was present in the seventh feast
[1:18:59] he said come unto me
[1:19:02] and drink
[1:19:04] and out of your belly shall flow lit
[1:19:05] rivers of living water and he was
[1:19:07] speaking of the holy ghost that would
[1:19:08] come
[1:19:11] brother said we're worshiping now under
[1:19:12] the feast of tabernacles the seventh
[1:19:14] church age
[1:19:15] in the millennium will be under the
[1:19:17] feast of tabernacles again
[1:19:20] now we're in it spiritually there will
[1:19:22] be in time
[1:19:26] in the seventh day but then after the
[1:19:28] seventh day we have a holy convocation
[1:19:30] go back into eternity how by the eternal
[1:19:33] one that came and redeemed us and taken
[1:19:35] us back letting us recognize that we are
[1:19:37] part of this
[1:19:38] now how do you know you're a part
[1:19:40] because the word of the hour the promise
[1:19:41] of the day what is it a restoration back
[1:19:44] to the first day the first and he shall
[1:19:47] restore the hearts of the children back
[1:19:49] to the fathers bringing a restoration
[1:19:51] again of the pentecostal genuine not

[1:25:25] feast of trumpets or the recognition of
[1:25:28] the atonement who's he speaking of he's

[1:25:51] way so that the feast of trumpets can
[1:25:52] break forth on 144 000.
[1:25:55] so where are we that's where we are
[1:25:58] friends
[1:26:01] in the homeland waiting for the feast of
[1:26:03] trumpets or the recognition of the
[1:26:05] atonement
[1:26:06] and to wait for the coming to mourn for
[1:26:08] the rejection
[1:26:10] of the first time that they rejected it
[1:26:12] they're in the homeland for that waiting
[1:26:14] what are they everything is positionally
[1:26:17] placed brother branham as a prophet of
[1:26:19] god he's telling you everything's in
[1:26:21] position

[1:26:33] as a minister of the gospel i can see
[1:26:34] one i can't see one thing left but the
[1:26:37] going of the bride
[1:26:39] and the bride has got to be taken away
[1:26:41] before they can recognize what happened
[1:26:44] they cannot come to the feast of
[1:26:46] atonement till the bride is taken out of
[1:26:48] the way
[1:26:52] the bride has to be taken away before
[1:26:54] they can recognize what happened
[1:26:56] they were bound scattered i mean they
[1:26:58] were scattered blinded and now gathered
[1:27:01] what's left the bride to be taken out of
[1:27:03] the way waiting for the going of the
[1:27:05] bride so their prophets of revelation 11
[1:27:08] can call them to the feast of trumpets
[1:27:10] to to make them to recognize what they
[1:27:13] have done
[1:27:16] where are we friends
[1:27:19] what are we waiting for
[1:27:22] what did the prophet tell us to wait for
[1:27:24] he said i can't see anything left
[1:27:26] but they're going away of the bride
[1:27:29] and she's going up word by word
[1:27:32] one by one
[1:27:34] moving into the rapture one by one
[1:27:36] moving into the great day at the end of
[1:27:39] the seventh feast into the holy
[1:27:40] convocation moving into eternity amen
[1:27:43] being raptured up and lifted up out of
[1:27:45] denominationalism and being connected
[1:27:47] back with god one by one until the last
[1:27:49] one comes in then they'll all be taken
[1:27:52] out of the way so that they can come to
[1:27:53] the recognition the jews can come into
[1:27:55] the recognition of what they've done
[1:27:59] it's all done
[1:28:01] it's finished
[1:28:02] the prophet did what he was supposed to
[1:28:04] do we're moving in one by one by
[1:28:06] revelation upon the word the message has
[1:28:08] been given to us we're here to preach it
[1:28:10] and it's truth we're here to we're here
[1:28:12] to preach it pure under the pure washing
[1:28:14] of the word amen to bring every
[1:28:16] predestinated seed into this position
[1:28:18] and when the last one comes into this
[1:28:20] position she's taken out of the way amen
[1:28:22] and the feast of atonement breaks open
[1:28:24] on the 144 thousand that's what we're
[1:28:26] supposed to be doing not sitting on our
[1:28:28] heels waiting for god to do something
[1:28:30] he's done everything friends
[1:28:34] this is where we're at
[1:28:37] where are we in prophecy this is where
[1:28:39] we're at where are we in redemption this

[1:28:55] amen to preach a pure word amen preach a
[1:28:58] real living sacrifice a real atonement
[1:29:00] and
[1:29:00] present a real atonement to the people

[1:29:05] they can unite with their melchizedek
[1:29:07] they can come one with the atonement and
[1:29:09] they can move into the feast of
[1:29:10] tabernacles where that atonement now
[1:29:12] lives in them
[1:29:14] then they can get caught up
[1:29:16] into the eighth day
[1:29:18] and one by one we get out of the way
[1:29:23] one by one we get out of the way until
[1:29:25] the last one gets out of the way and

[1:29:58] way till that last one moves into that
[1:30:00] great day of the seventh feast
[1:30:03] let's preach a word amen that somebody
[1:30:05] can grab a hold of and move and rapture

[1:30:53] and god can reveal himself like joseph
[1:30:56] did to his brethren
[1:30:58] through the ministry of two prophets
[1:30:59] moses and
[1:31:00] elijah then they can follow the same
[1:31:03] path that you've just been through
[1:31:06] they can come through feast of
[1:31:07] atonements through prophet
[1:31:09] two prophets a prophetic message that
[1:31:10] reveals to them what's been going on
[1:31:13] through the trumpets
[1:31:15] brings them in contact with the living
[1:31:17] sacrifice the word
[1:31:20] and brings them into union with that
[1:31:23] word
[1:31:24] and and takes care
[1:31:26] of the rest of the redemption

[1:31:40] is good
[1:31:43] the prophet come to tell us
[1:31:45] who we are
[1:31:47] and he also come to tell us where we are
[1:31:50] if you don't know where you are
[1:31:52] we get distracted with all kinds of
[1:31:54] things of the world
[1:31:56] we start playing games and playing
[1:31:57] around and getting distracted and
[1:31:59] running to and fro because we don't
[1:32:01] realize where we are
[1:32:04] and we won't realize what's waiting for
[1:32:05] the next step to transpire and we forget
[1:32:08] our commission and we forget our calling
[1:32:11] when you know where you are and you know
[1:32:13] who you are you know what you're
[1:32:15] supposed to be doing
[1:32:17] you're supposed to be preaching this
[1:32:19] word
[1:32:20] presenting a real living sacrifice
[1:32:22] a true atonement to the people
[1:32:25] so they can come in contact with that
[1:32:28] and it can live in them
[1:32:30] so we can get out of the way
[1:32:33] are you ready to get out of the way
[1:32:36] i'm ready to get out of the way
[1:32:38] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:32:40] we thank you for your word
[1:32:43] lord i think over and over what would we
[1:32:45] do if you haven't sent a prophet lord
[1:32:49] what kind of system will we be in what
[1:32:51] would we be believing lord
[1:32:54] we would still have a hunger in our
[1:32:55] heart to worship but how would we know
[1:32:58] the proper way to worship the proper
[1:33:00] place of worship
[1:33:02] how would we know where we are in
[1:33:03] redemption how would we know where to go
[1:33:05] and where to
[1:33:07] oh god if you hadn't come through that
[1:33:10] prophet
[1:33:11] we would be so lost
[1:33:14] we would be so blind
[1:33:16] so uncertain of what's going on
[1:33:20] but god you sent the eyes in this day
[1:33:22] through the prophet
[1:33:23] to open our eyes so that we could see
[1:33:25] where we're at
[1:33:27] so you could show us on the map of
[1:33:29] redemption where we are
[1:33:30] and what we're supposed to be doing
[1:33:33] god help us to be faithful in that
[1:33:35] calling
[1:33:36] help us lord to get out of the way
[1:33:39] oh god how we love you and thank you for
[1:33:42] your mercy and your kindness
[1:33:44] for your goodness and your grace lord
[1:33:47] i'm god was just a people lord just born
[1:33:49] in flesh
[1:33:51] but god inside is something you
[1:33:53] predestinated

[1:33:58] in this age and because of that you've
[1:33:59] opened our eyes you've given us i sav

[1:34:04] everything that we need

[1:34:08] the end of the redemption of the
[1:34:10] gentiles and here we stand at the very
[1:34:12] end we stand at the precipice where
[1:34:14] we're as far as we can possibly go
[1:34:18] god let us be faithful in this position

[1:34:25] eyes

[1:34:36] others and accomplish your purpose
[1:34:38] and may you draw through the light that

[1:34:42] the last of your predestinated seed to
[1:34:44] this place
