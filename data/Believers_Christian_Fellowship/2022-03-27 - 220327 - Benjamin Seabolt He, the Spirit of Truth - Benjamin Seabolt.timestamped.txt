[1:43] let's just sing this
[1:53] [Music]
[1:55] we
[1:56] want to
[1:58] see
[1:59] jesus
[2:04] [Music]
[2:15] and say that we
[2:20] [Music]
[2:25] oh
[2:38] [Music]
[2:52] [Music]
[2:59] one more time
[3:02] oh
[3:09] [Music]
[3:21] reach out
[3:27] [Music]
[3:39] [Music]
[3:48] [Music]
[3:56] [Music]
[4:07] he wants you
[4:10] [Music]
[4:15] praise the lord let's pray together
[4:18] precious lord jesus we just thank you
[4:21] for this opportunity that you've given
[4:23] us to
[4:24] once again
[4:25] gathering around you lord
[4:28] father and as we're just singing that
[4:30] you would
[4:31] give us eyes to see and ears to hear you
[4:34] father but
[4:35] we stand before you today such a
[4:37] privileged people
[4:41] lord that
[4:42] you have come and you have told us what
[4:44] to be looking for to see you father and
[4:47] that you've sent the prophet across the
[4:49] scene to tell us that we
[4:51] aren't searching for a man walking
[4:53] around with nail scars and a crown on
[4:55] his head father but we are looking for
[4:58] the word made manifest and that is
[5:01] christ
[5:03] so father we are grateful for that
[5:06] revelation that we're not stumbling in
[5:08] darkness or that we're not wandering to
[5:10] and fro
[5:12] seeking something that we don't know
[5:13] what it is lord but that we can truly
[5:16] seek you because we know what we're
[5:18] looking for
[5:20] lord may we never take that for granted
[5:22] that we can recognize the form that you
[5:24] have come in in this age lord
[5:27] i pray now that you would just come that
[5:29] you would anoint both speaker and hear
[5:31] that you would just have the preeminence
[5:33] here father and that you would come and
[5:35] do what no man can do lord and to take
[5:37] the book and to loose the seals father
[5:40] to take the bread and to break it for
[5:42] your children lord we just commit
[5:44] ourselves to you lord in the name of the
[5:47] lord jesus christ and the bride says
[5:50] amen god bless you if you have your
[5:53] bibles
[5:54] we'll go to the gospel of john chapter
[5:57] 16.
[6:03] the gospel of john chapter 16.
[6:06] trust everybody is ready to have church
[6:08] this morning
[6:12] you know the bride is a
[6:15] very
[6:16] peculiar
[6:18] type of people they're really the only
[6:20] ones that can have church because church
[6:22] means called out ones
[6:24] and you have to be a little bit
[6:26] different to want to come to a service
[6:29] every week or maybe twice a week to get
[6:31] called out
[6:33] you know that don't fly in the low to
[6:35] see and age they don't want to be called
[6:37] out about anything they would get their
[6:38] feelings hurt they would get a complex
[6:41] you would be considered hate speech
[6:44] possibly so the bride is a very select
[6:47] group of people that can actually have
[6:50] church and be called out and be happy
[6:52] about it be happy that you're called out
[6:54] and your sins are made known and you can
[6:56] repent and line up with the word of god
[6:59] so we're a very unusual type of people
[7:03] let's read here beginning in verse 12
[7:05] john
[7:06] 16
[7:09] and verse 12.
[7:11] jesus speaking
[7:13] says i have yet
[7:14] many things to say unto you
[7:18] but ye cannot bear them now
[7:21] how be it when he
[7:23] the spirit of truth is come
[7:25] he will guide you unto all truth for he
[7:28] shall not speak of himself but
[7:30] whatsoever he shall hear
[7:33] that shall he speak
[7:35] and he will show you things to come
[7:37] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[7:40] of mine
[7:41] and shall show it unto you god bless you
[7:44] as you would have your seats and the
[7:46] topic that i want to speak on this
[7:48] morning is he
[7:51] the spirit of truth
[7:53] and i would
[7:55] i would think we would all agree as
[7:57] we're in the closing moments of time
[8:00] and anybody that's been around
[8:03] i won't even say the message but i will
[8:05] say the religious world foreign any type
[8:08] of time of time of all at all
[8:12] has noticed that there is an exorbitant
[8:15] amount of teaching on what we would
[8:18] consider the baptism of the holy spirit
[8:20] or receiving the holy ghost uh whatever
[8:23] term you want to put to it there
[8:25] and i don't intend to preach anything
[8:28] earth shattering here this morning i
[8:29] don't think this is going to be
[8:31] uh you know anything
[8:33] extraordinary new but it's something
[8:36] that i want to go back and take a look
[8:39] at to
[8:40] maybe just bring a little bit of clarity
[8:43] to that topic
[8:45] because
[8:47] this is extremely important this is the
[8:49] new birth we know the the prophet said
[8:51] that the true baptism of the holy spirit
[8:54] was the new birth and he preached that
[8:55] in the token he said that's one of the
[8:57] mysteries that was revealed under those
[8:59] seals
[9:00] so
[9:01] he also said that
[9:03] satan does not care what doctrine you
[9:05] have or how right you are in your doctor
[9:08] and he says if you miss that life you're
[9:10] not going to come up anyhow so i would
[9:13] venture to say by default this is the
[9:15] most important thing to have a proper
[9:17] understanding and a true experience of
[9:20] the true new birth and if that is the
[9:23] most important thing then i don't
[9:24] necessarily think we can over emphasize
[9:27] the truth of that
[9:28] and
[9:30] it's it's one of those things that
[9:32] really my point here this morning
[9:35] is if it's something
[9:38] even carnally speaking if you are
[9:40] seeking something or if you are looking
[9:42] for something
[9:44] you have to know what it is you're
[9:46] looking for
[9:48] or one of two things is going to happen
[9:50] you're never going to find it
[9:53] or you may find it and you still won't
[9:56] know that you have it
[9:59] does that make sense
[10:00] and i find that when it comes to people
[10:03] that are unsettled and people that are
[10:06] unstable that is usually in a spiritual
[10:10] sense that is usually one of the two
[10:13] problems
[10:14] they don't know what they're looking for
[10:16] or they have actually found what they're
[10:19] looking for and they can't recognize it
[10:21] for what it is and because of that there
[10:23] is an unsettledness and you say well
[10:25] that'll never happen if you if you get
[10:26] that holy spirit you're going to know it
[10:28] you're going to be settled you're you're
[10:29] not going to have any issue there but
[10:31] i'll remind you of the interview with
[10:32] sister bruce
[10:35] who was all tore up about it and she had
[10:38] a vindicated prophet tell her you're
[10:39] fine you have it i know you have it i've
[10:42] seen you under discernment you have it
[10:46] but she was all tore up because she
[10:48] didn't recognize it for what it was
[10:51] and the prophet in that interview he
[10:53] made it so simple for her he said sister
[10:55] bruce what did you used to be
[10:57] and what was your desires in the past
[11:00] and she explained them
[11:02] and he says but what is your desires now
[11:04] and what are you now
[11:06] and he asked her the simple question
[11:08] what did that
[11:10] what did that
[11:11] what could change you born in sin shaped
[11:14] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[11:16] lies and all the carnal and human hybrid
[11:18] human elements that would be in our
[11:20] being what has the capability to change
[11:23] that other than christ himself
[11:26] it can be self-reformed to to some
[11:29] extent
[11:31] but i'm we're talking and and the
[11:33] prophet and her we're talking about the
[11:35] very innermost being the soul itself the
[11:38] desires is what he was talking about
[11:40] there is nothing that can change that
[11:42] but god
[11:44] so
[11:45] those are the two elements that we run
[11:46] into is not knowing what you're seeking
[11:49] and if you don't know what you're
[11:50] seeking you're probably not going to
[11:52] find it but there is a slight chance
[11:54] that you would but if you still did not
[11:56] know what you were seeking you would not
[11:59] know what you had found and again it's
[12:02] something that will unsettle a person it
[12:05] is something that they will go all their
[12:06] lives
[12:08] have mental conditions be unstable and
[12:12] remember the prophet said that there's
[12:13] teaching that's to come into the church
[12:15] to settle the people and i'm not
[12:17] standing here before you trying to
[12:18] declare myself as a professor you
[12:20] remember there's all types of teaching
[12:21] there's kindergarten teachers so you
[12:24] know that's that's not a self
[12:26] exaltation so just just bear that in
[12:28] mind that's where i want to deal with
[12:30] this this morning is to really teach on
[12:32] this subject because we must know what
[12:35] we have saints
[12:38] we must know what we have
[12:40] because there's going to come a point in
[12:43] time and i would say in the very near
[12:45] future and may currently be going on
[12:48] that we are going to be pressed into a
[12:51] situation that we must know where we
[12:53] stand and we must know what we have when
[12:55] we must know that it will it will stand
[12:57] the test
[12:59] we have to know that
[13:01] we're going to have to know that and i'm
[13:03] not here to declare that we don't have
[13:05] that i just want to reaffirm
[13:08] and have a proper understanding of that
[13:11] so as we look here
[13:13] in john 16
[13:16] this is jesus himself speaking the
[13:18] fullness of the godhead bodily in flesh
[13:20] speaking
[13:22] and he says i have many things to say to
[13:24] you
[13:27] this is the topic
[13:28] i have many things to say to you
[13:31] in other words he has words to say
[13:35] but you cannot bear them now
[13:39] how be it when he
[13:41] personal pronoun
[13:45] when
[13:46] he the spirit of truth so now he gives a
[13:51] title
[13:52] to a person
[13:56] the spirit
[13:57] of truth
[13:59] is he that will come and tell you the
[14:03] words that i want to tell you right now
[14:05] but cannot
[14:08] he
[14:09] the spirit of truth
[14:11] the spirit of truth is a title to a
[14:13] person
[14:15] and the spirit of truth
[14:17] we know the person
[14:19] is god himself
[14:21] the spirit of god himself
[14:23] but now jesus the fullness of the
[14:25] godhead bodily gives a title that has
[14:28] not been declared yet to the spirit of
[14:30] god himself
[14:33] and that is the spirit of truth
[14:38] he self he defines this spirit that is
[14:42] to come and it is the spirit of truth
[14:45] this is extremely important
[14:48] of all the things that he could attach
[14:50] to this spirit
[14:52] the spirit of praise the spirit of
[14:53] worship the spirit of
[14:55] signs of wonders of healings of miracles
[14:58] anything that he could attach to this
[15:01] promise that is to come
[15:04] he simply says this is the spirit of
[15:07] truth that will come
[15:10] and he attaches that to the person that
[15:13] is to come and we know that person that
[15:15] has to come it was the spirit of jesus
[15:17] it was the spirit of god
[15:19] but so that we would understand and so
[15:21] the disciples would understand what is
[15:23] to come
[15:24] he gives this definition to it
[15:27] when he the spirit of truth is come
[15:31] he
[15:32] person again
[15:34] will guide you unto all truth for he
[15:38] person again shall not speak of himself
[15:41] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[15:44] he speak and he will show you things to
[15:47] come verse 14 he shall glorify me
[15:51] for he shall receive of mine
[15:55] if you'll do a quick count there there
[15:56] is one two three four five six seven
[16:00] eight times that he says he in two
[16:02] sentences
[16:05] not the sharpest tool in the shed but i
[16:06] think he's wanting us to catch something
[16:08] this is not a thing
[16:12] this is not a thing
[16:15] this is a person
[16:18] and this person
[16:21] has a title
[16:22] that when he comes in this dispensation
[16:25] when this promise is fulfilled
[16:28] he is going to come with the title
[16:32] i am the spirit of truth
[16:37] and remember what jesus said when he
[16:39] started this conversation in verse 12
[16:43] i have many i'm going to use my verbiage
[16:46] here i have many words of truth that i
[16:49] want to tell you right now but i can't
[16:51] because you can't bear them
[16:53] and then he immediately starts talking
[16:55] about a promise that is to come and a
[16:57] person that is to come and a spirit that
[16:59] is to come and it just so happens that
[17:01] this spirit's title is the spirit of
[17:03] truth
[17:06] what do you think the function of this
[17:08] spirit of truth is going to be it's
[17:10] going to be to be to declare the things
[17:12] that jesus could not declare at that
[17:14] time
[17:16] so i would say that that's probably the
[17:18] most important thing that we want to
[17:20] remember this morning
[17:22] is the holy spirit
[17:25] is
[17:26] by the scripture i don't care what
[17:28] anybody else says
[17:30] i don't care what anybody else says
[17:33] by the scripture the baptism of the holy
[17:36] spirit is defined as receiving the
[17:39] spirit of truth
[17:41] period
[17:43] you do not have to receive the spirit of
[17:46] anything else
[17:48] to receive the baptism
[17:50] baptism of the holy spirit but simply
[17:52] receive the spirit of truth
[17:57] john 4 24
[17:59] god is a spirit and they that worship
[18:02] him
[18:03] must worship him in spirit
[18:06] and in truth
[18:08] john 5. don't try to turn to these i'm
[18:10] going to go through them quickly you can
[18:12] jot them down or just uh go back and
[18:14] catch them later first john 5
[18:17] verse 6 this is he that came by water
[18:20] and blood even jesus christ not by water
[18:23] only but by water and blood and it is
[18:26] the spirit that beareth witness because
[18:28] the spirit is truth
[18:32] of all the things that he can say the
[18:35] spirit is he says the spirit is truth
[18:40] for there are three that bear record in
[18:42] heaven the father the word and the holy
[18:45] ghost these three
[18:47] are one again the father the word
[18:51] and the holy ghost these three are one
[18:55] and the verse right before that declared
[18:57] them as the spirit
[18:59] of truth
[19:02] first john 4 6 we are of god he that
[19:05] knoweth god heareth us he that is not of
[19:08] god heareth not us heareth not what
[19:11] words
[19:13] words that's what he's talking about
[19:16] he heareth the words he that is not of
[19:18] god heareth not us
[19:21] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[19:26] and the spirit of error
[19:28] so we recognize now there is a spirit of
[19:31] truth and a spirit of error and the only
[19:34] way to properly and accurately discern
[19:37] those
[19:39] we are of god
[19:41] he that knoweth god heareth us
[19:44] and he that is not of god
[19:47] heareth not us
[19:48] so if you do not want to hear the truth
[19:51] or you cannot hear the truth you are not
[19:53] of god and you have no capability to be
[19:56] of god
[19:58] that's hard but that's not my saying
[19:59] i'll read you the scripture here in just
[20:01] a second
[20:02] if you have no capability to hear the
[20:04] truth you are not of god and if you are
[20:07] of god
[20:08] you have the capability to hear the
[20:10] truth and that is given of god by his
[20:12] grace
[20:15] but paul or i'm sorry john starts
[20:18] bringing in what i would call
[20:20] scriptural spiritual discernment
[20:24] and he says if you want to discern
[20:26] between the true spirit the two spirits
[20:29] he he defines the two and he says if you
[20:31] want to discern between those two
[20:33] there's only one way to do it
[20:37] you have to have the capability to hear
[20:39] from god
[20:40] ephesians 5 verse 8 for ye were
[20:44] sometimes in darkness but now are ye
[20:46] light in the world
[20:49] walk as children of the light for the
[20:51] fruit of the spirit
[20:53] is in all goodness and righteousness and
[20:57] truth
[21:00] so now paul comes and he starts
[21:01] describing the fruit of the spirit
[21:05] and we know this spirit is the spirit of
[21:06] truth
[21:07] so it just so happens that one of its
[21:09] fruits
[21:11] is it is in all goodness and
[21:13] righteousness
[21:14] and truth
[21:16] truth of the word is always tied to the
[21:20] true holy spirit to the true baptism of
[21:24] the holy spirit to the true receiving of
[21:27] the holy ghost to the true new birth you
[21:30] put whatever terminology you want to on
[21:32] it i'm okay with that
[21:34] but if it doesn't come back to receiving
[21:36] the truth for your age it is not the
[21:39] true holy spirit it is not god's spirit
[21:43] it is not he
[21:45] himself
[21:49] and if it is the truth for your age
[21:52] it is none other than he himself
[21:58] john 14 verse 17 even the spirit of
[22:02] truth
[22:04] whom the world cannot receive
[22:06] because it seeth him not
[22:09] neither knoweth him
[22:11] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[22:14] you
[22:17] notice he does the same thing that he
[22:18] did earlier
[22:20] he
[22:21] he gives the the declaration of this
[22:23] title of this spirit that is to come
[22:26] even the spirit of truth
[22:29] whom the world cannot receive
[22:31] because it seeth him not
[22:34] and immediately goes to the person
[22:37] personal
[22:38] pronoun him
[22:41] it seeth him not neither knoweth him
[22:46] but ye know
[22:48] him
[22:49] i thought he was talking about a spirit
[22:50] of truth
[22:52] why is he keep talking about a person
[22:56] for he dwelleth with you
[22:59] and shall be in you
[23:02] verse 18
[23:03] i
[23:04] now it gets
[23:06] really specific
[23:09] i will not leave you oh i thought you
[23:11] said he wouldn't leave me i thought you
[23:12] said the spirit of truth wouldn't leave
[23:14] me but now you're saying i won't leave
[23:16] you
[23:18] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[23:21] come to you see this is why i say it is
[23:23] so important that we recognize what
[23:25] we're after
[23:27] and if we have got what we're after
[23:30] because if we have really received the
[23:33] baptism of the holy spirit we have
[23:34] received none other than the person of
[23:37] christ
[23:38] jesus himself god himself
[23:42] that should settle you saints that
[23:44] should make us very very stable
[23:49] and how can you be sure
[23:53] because ultimately he reveals himself as
[23:56] the spirit of truth
[23:59] the capability to receive the truth for
[24:02] your age
[24:04] self defaults to you being his bride
[24:08] there is no one else capable to do that
[24:12] we should
[24:13] of all things we should get on our face
[24:16] and thank god every day that he has
[24:19] placed something within us to receive
[24:21] truth
[24:23] not that he just sent truth because he
[24:26] sent truth across the globe seven times
[24:31] but there was a
[24:33] extreme minority that had the capability
[24:36] to receive that truth
[24:39] what a privileged people we are saints
[24:42] what a privileged people we are
[24:47] but we want to recognize that privilege
[24:50] for what it is
[24:51] and we don't want to be seeking
[24:53] something and continue seeking something
[24:55] when we've got what we're seeking and we
[24:58] want to allow that to bring the rest and
[25:01] the peace and the stability and the
[25:03] settledness that it's supposed to
[25:10] john 14 15 verse 26
[25:14] but when the comforter so now there's
[25:16] another description coming in
[25:18] but when the comforter has come and this
[25:21] is why it's so important that i'm
[25:22] speaking on this
[25:24] this is a scriptural title of the
[25:27] comforter
[25:29] if the comforter has come why should you
[25:32] still be tore up
[25:39] it's in his very title that he's to take
[25:42] that away
[25:44] what good is the comforter coming if you
[25:47] still remain tore up
[25:53] this is a function of the baptism of the
[25:56] holy spirit it's so that you won't be
[25:59] tore up
[26:00] because it's the comforter coming
[26:02] to bring you comfort
[26:05] of your stability and your position in
[26:07] christ
[26:10] the comforter has come whom i will send
[26:14] you from the father
[26:16] even the spirit of truth
[26:20] so now the comforter and the spirit of
[26:23] truth is the exact same thing
[26:32] don't pray for peace and comfort if
[26:33] you're not ready to receive the truth
[26:39] if you're not really sold out
[26:42] completely given over
[26:44] to the truth for your age
[26:47] don't bother praying for peace and
[26:48] comfort
[26:50] you're not going to get it
[26:53] it's impossible
[26:54] because of the same thing
[26:59] but when the comforter has come
[27:02] whom i will send you from the father
[27:05] even the spirit of truth
[27:08] which proceedeth from the pro father
[27:10] he shall testify of me
[27:13] and ye also shall bear witness
[27:16] because ye have been with me from the
[27:18] beginning you want comfort and peace
[27:22] you want a settledness of stability get
[27:24] that revelation
[27:26] get that revelation that because i have
[27:30] the capability to receive the truth for
[27:33] my age
[27:35] i by default
[27:39] have been with him from the beginning
[27:42] if that don't comfort you if that don't
[27:45] settle you if that does not bring you
[27:47] peace
[27:48] i've got nothing else to offer
[27:52] nothing
[27:54] like if that don't work you're hopeless
[27:58] it's just the facts
[28:01] but if you can gather a proper
[28:04] revelation
[28:06] that because i can receive the truth for
[28:10] my age
[28:12] that means
[28:14] i had to have been with him in the
[28:16] beginning
[28:19] jesus said
[28:21] the reason that you can be taught of me
[28:23] now is because you were taught of the
[28:25] father before
[28:29] those scriptures are not wishy-washy
[28:32] based upon the bad situation you had at
[28:34] work yesterday
[28:36] or the fight that you had or the
[28:38] argument that you had or the ups and
[28:40] down in your emotional realm
[28:42] it's not subject to that
[28:45] you were to bring all of that subject to
[28:47] this revelation
[28:49] because all of those things will change
[28:52] can change and have changed
[28:54] this is something that will not change
[28:58] not on your best day not on your worst
[29:00] day not on your mediocre days
[29:02] this is something that was settled a
[29:04] long long time ago
[29:09] this is the answer to the laodicean
[29:12] problem
[29:13] this is the answer
[29:15] to the nervous tension sweeping the
[29:17] world
[29:19] it's because they're seeking something
[29:21] they can't get
[29:24] but if you have the capability to
[29:26] receive this do not allow yourself
[29:29] to be left in that nervous tension
[29:31] condition of laodicea
[29:33] accept it for what it is
[29:36] and be grateful
[29:38] and again we're not talking about
[29:41] sinless perfection in our flesh
[29:43] we're talking about a proper
[29:45] understanding of the grace of god that
[29:47] has been extended to us
[29:49] as revealed by the
[29:52] fruit that i have the capability to
[29:55] receive the truth and walk in the truth
[29:58] and love the truth for my age
[30:01] we should never
[30:03] take that lightly
[30:04] it's such an anomaly to us because
[30:09] we
[30:10] we i would say we take it for granted
[30:13] because
[30:15] as believers we came to the world as
[30:18] believers even when we didn't know we
[30:20] were believers we were we were believers
[30:22] and as believers we functioned and we
[30:25] responded to the word of god as
[30:27] believers
[30:28] even when we didn't know we were
[30:29] believers
[30:30] so
[30:32] really all that we've ever known
[30:34] is too above to be a believer
[30:38] that was a mouthful i know
[30:43] but we can't even as a unbeliever
[30:47] or i'll say it this way we can't even in
[30:50] an unbelieving state
[30:52] respond as a true unbeliever
[30:55] we can't think like that we can't
[30:57] function like that we can't operate like
[30:59] that and because of that there's not
[31:03] this there's there's possibly not this
[31:06] huge
[31:07] uh junction in time and moment that we
[31:10] can say oh oh oh this has changed this
[31:14] is different i've never i've never felt
[31:16] like this i've never acted like this
[31:17] especially for those of you that was
[31:19] born and raised in this message there
[31:21] may not be this
[31:22] huge dividing line
[31:25] because you were always in the proper
[31:27] atmosphere and you was always around the
[31:29] truth and you just walked in the truth
[31:33] but don't ever take that lightly and do
[31:35] not ever
[31:37] don't
[31:38] um
[31:40] do not
[31:43] not allow that to be what it is
[31:47] allow it to be what it is
[31:49] the capability to receive the truth for
[31:52] your age is the evidence that you have
[31:54] been with him from the
[31:58] beginning it is worthy
[32:02] of the significance
[32:04] that it stands for
[32:08] ephesians 1 12
[32:10] that we should be to the praise of his
[32:12] glory
[32:14] who first trusted in christ
[32:17] in whom he also trusted
[32:20] after
[32:21] that ye heard
[32:23] the word of truth
[32:27] the gospel of your salvation and in whom
[32:30] also after ye believed believed in what
[32:34] the words of truth
[32:36] ye were sealed with that holy spirit
[32:40] of promise how were you sealed with the
[32:42] holy spirit
[32:44] not because you came up here and cried
[32:46] not because you came up here and shouted
[32:48] not because you danced around you spoke
[32:50] in tongues you have a ministry you have
[32:52] gifts of healing you have supernatural
[32:54] you have prophecy you have this that and
[32:56] the other
[32:58] you were sealed with the holy spirit
[33:01] under one condition
[33:04] after that ye have heard the words of
[33:07] truth the gospel of your salvation you
[33:10] believed
[33:14] do not allow somebody to tell you that
[33:17] it's anything other than that can it
[33:19] come with all of those things that i
[33:20] just described absolutely but you can
[33:23] also have all of those things i just
[33:24] described before this happens
[33:30] in and of itself
[33:32] there is only one evidence for the true
[33:34] baptism of the holy spirit
[33:36] receiving the truth for your age
[33:40] period
[33:43] that might make you jump and shout and
[33:45] stand on your head
[33:46] it may make a tear trickle out of the
[33:48] corner of your eye or it may have
[33:50] absolutely no response on you except for
[33:54] a changed life
[33:57] that it will have
[34:00] but that changed life may not even be
[34:02] represented in a physical viewing it may
[34:05] simply be that you changed within
[34:08] because again you take somebody that's
[34:10] born in this message in a real godly
[34:13] christian atmosphere and home
[34:15] they may already be walking the walk
[34:18] and talking the talk
[34:21] and may have all of you fooled
[34:25] but the only person they can't fool is
[34:27] themselves
[34:29] and they know they don't have the goods
[34:31] because they don't have the peace and
[34:32] the comforter on the inside
[34:34] but when they hear the words of truth
[34:36] and they believe on that they receive
[34:39] the comforter and the peace on the
[34:41] inside and they're the only ones that
[34:43] know about it and there's nothing
[34:45] external that changes
[34:49] that's why i say it can come with a lot
[34:50] of things or it may not come with
[34:52] anything outwardly
[34:54] but one thing is for certain
[34:56] you as the individual will know
[34:59] maybe nobody else will know but you will
[35:01] know
[35:02] that you have received the words of
[35:04] truth for your age
[35:06] and it doesn't really matter what
[35:08] everybody else knows and what everybody
[35:09] else sees and whatever everybody else
[35:11] thinks
[35:13] you're the one
[35:15] you're the one that has to know
[35:17] you're the one that matters
[35:22] that is the evidence and we'll touch on
[35:24] that in a little bit
[35:27] of being sealed with the holy ghost the
[35:29] holy spirit the new birth the token
[35:33] the baptism of the holy spirit
[35:35] whatever terminology you want to put on
[35:37] it
[35:38] i don't care what's been preached on it
[35:40] and or who you've heard it from this is
[35:42] one thing that i can say
[35:45] hear the words that i'm speaking unto
[35:46] you because they're truth
[35:49] this is what the scripture says
[35:52] and the religious world
[35:55] the rel the goal of the religious world
[36:00] is to change this and make it something
[36:02] other than this
[36:05] because if they don't change this
[36:09] that the holy spirit is receiving the
[36:11] words of truth and believing them if
[36:13] they don't first change this they can
[36:16] never build a denomination
[36:18] they can never have a religion
[36:20] another religion
[36:22] they first have to chip away at this
[36:25] and make the evidence something else
[36:29] they have to this is where they have to
[36:30] start
[36:32] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[36:34] brother branham says then jesus said in
[36:35] john 14 when he the holy ghost is come
[36:39] he will bring these things to your
[36:41] memory i just want to interject this
[36:42] because i like it it makes me feel good
[36:44] he does not say that he's going to
[36:46] reveal this to you and it's all new he
[36:47] says it's going to he says it's going to
[36:49] bring things to your memory
[36:52] if he's bringing things to my memory it
[36:54] means i knew something before and i
[36:55] forgot it
[36:57] don't
[36:58] don't take that lightly
[37:02] if you had the capability to forget
[37:05] something that the holy spirit is going
[37:07] to bring to your remembrance it means
[37:08] that you knew it before and the only way
[37:10] that you knew it before is that you was
[37:12] in him in the beginning
[37:15] we take these things lightly and his
[37:16] cliches and his catchphrases
[37:21] really grasp it saints because if you do
[37:24] the comforter will come into your life
[37:27] the rose of sharon the prince of peace
[37:30] he will come
[37:32] he will come he will bring these things
[37:34] to your memory see show you what day
[37:37] you're living in so now we have a
[37:38] vindicated prophet on the scene and he
[37:40] comes along and he says when you receive
[37:42] the holy ghost it will show you what day
[37:44] you're living in so if you don't know
[37:45] what day you're living in do not try to
[37:47] tell me that you have the holy ghost
[37:50] vindicated prophet by default it's
[37:52] impossible
[37:54] you have to have a proper understanding
[37:56] of what day that you're living in in
[37:58] order to have the holy spirit that is
[38:00] what the holy spirit does
[38:03] per the prophet
[38:05] you cannot have the holy spirit without
[38:07] that that is the evidence of the holy
[38:10] spirit is receiving the truth and the
[38:12] truth is recognizing what day that you
[38:14] live in
[38:15] you have to know what day that you live
[38:16] in in order to receive the word for that
[38:18] day because if you don't even know what
[38:19] day that you're living in how can you
[38:20] say i've received the word for this day
[38:22] or what word did you receive the word
[38:24] for this day
[38:26] well what day do you live in i don't
[38:27] know well then how do you know that you
[38:29] received the word for your day
[38:30] i know that's silly but just really
[38:32] think about it it's it really is as
[38:34] simple as brother random made it and as
[38:37] the scripture makes it but the devil has
[38:39] to complicate it
[38:42] because he's got to keep you tore up
[38:44] and the only way to keep you tore up is
[38:46] to make you think that you're not okay
[38:48] so he has to he has to attack this
[38:52] but i just want to
[38:54] encourage you this morning allow it to
[38:57] be as simple as it is
[39:00] really just allow it to be that simple
[39:03] that i was in him in the beginning and i
[39:05] can't be lost
[39:06] because i love his word and i receive it
[39:08] and whenever i have something that don't
[39:09] line up with his word i repent of it and
[39:11] i line up with his word
[39:14] it really is that simple saints there is
[39:16] no other people on the face of the earth
[39:19] that has that capability
[39:23] we take that for granted but there is no
[39:25] other person that has that capability
[39:29] i wasn't going to do this but i'm going
[39:30] to do it anyhow go to revelation chapter
[39:32] 5. i've just got to do this
[39:35] you've got to catch how important this
[39:37] is
[39:38] this isn't in my notes so if i mess this
[39:40] up you just forgive me but i want you to
[39:41] catch this i was thinking about this the
[39:43] other day when i read something
[39:45] revelation chapter five very very very
[39:48] familiar portion of scripture
[39:53] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[39:54] sat on the throne a book written within
[39:56] and on the back side sealed with seven
[39:57] seals and i saw a strong angel
[39:59] proclaiming with a loud voice who was
[40:01] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[40:03] seals thereof and no man in heaven nor
[40:05] in earth nor under the earth was able to
[40:08] open the book neither to look upon and i
[40:10] wept much because no man was found
[40:11] worthy to open the book and to open and
[40:13] to read the book neither to look thereon
[40:15] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[40:17] not behold the line of the tribe of
[40:20] judah okay so now we're going into
[40:21] descriptions right
[40:23] weep not
[40:25] weep not because the line of the tribe
[40:27] of judah
[40:29] judah was where the kings came from
[40:31] the root of david
[40:34] hath prevailed and opened the book and
[40:36] to loose the seven seals thereof i'm
[40:38] gonna make this really short so i don't
[40:39] get carried away and lose track of where
[40:41] i'm going
[40:43] brother random says this was the most
[40:45] sublime portion of scripture
[40:48] and when he the lamb which we know is
[40:50] god which we know is jesus christ the
[40:53] only one worthy
[40:55] he attaches
[40:56] one
[40:57] name to his description in the most
[40:59] sublime portion of scripture
[41:02] the root of david
[41:04] he attaches a human name to him other
[41:08] than jesus
[41:12] the one that's worthy to loose the seals
[41:14] the one that's worthy all redemption is
[41:17] hanging on this and in the description
[41:19] he would attach a humanistic name to it
[41:23] other than jesus christ
[41:26] this is profound this is significant the
[41:29] question is
[41:30] why
[41:33] why david
[41:36] why david why not moses why not abraham
[41:38] why not william branham why not why not
[41:40] another name
[41:44] david
[41:47] why david
[41:50] david had one characteristic
[41:54] unlike any other in the scripture
[41:57] david
[41:58] had plenty of mistakes i believe he did
[42:00] we would all agree on that
[42:03] david
[42:06] planned a man's death so that he could
[42:09] take his wife who he had already had
[42:11] impregnated
[42:12] prior to the man die
[42:14] like david did some stuff
[42:19] but his name is attached in the
[42:22] description
[42:23] of the most sublime portion of scripture
[42:26] the prophet says
[42:27] his name is attached to this one coming
[42:31] and opening the book why
[42:33] because the characteristic that david
[42:36] had
[42:37] was regardless of anything that david
[42:40] did david would always repent and line
[42:43] himself up with the word
[42:47] and the characteristic of the one
[42:50] loosing that book
[42:52] was attached to the name of david for
[42:54] that reason
[42:56] that's why i say saints we should never
[42:58] take it lightly that we have the
[43:00] capability to repent and line ourself up
[43:02] with the word because this is the same
[43:05] characteristic that god himself said
[43:07] because that man has that virtue i will
[43:10] mention him in the description
[43:13] of the one who will come and take that
[43:15] book
[43:17] the capability to repent and line
[43:20] yourself up with the word to even have
[43:23] that unction to even have that desire
[43:26] look at where it puts you scripturally
[43:29] saints
[43:31] the devil has a heyday in your psyche
[43:33] and in your emotional realm i would just
[43:35] bring that up to him
[43:38] i'm not saying that he's not going to
[43:40] continue to do that every day he's going
[43:42] to continue to do that every day
[43:45] but this is the answer to the devil's
[43:46] question
[43:49] this is why the seals had to be broke
[43:52] to reveal this to us
[43:55] do not ever take lightly the capability
[43:57] to repent and line yourself up with the
[43:59] word
[44:00] there is only a select group of people
[44:02] on the face of the this earth that has
[44:04] that capability
[44:06] and they're also known as the bride
[44:08] you can't be you can't
[44:10] you can't have that capability and not
[44:13] be the bride saints
[44:14] somebody catch that this morning god's
[44:16] wanting somebody to catch that you
[44:18] cannot have this capability and not be
[44:21] the bride i'm sorry yes i think i said
[44:23] that correctly you understand what i'm
[44:25] trying to say if i didn't say it
[44:26] correctly
[44:27] to have the capability to repent
[44:30] and line yourself up with the word means
[44:33] you are the bride by default you can't
[44:36] have one without the other
[44:40] so if you have the desire i'm going to
[44:42] say it a different way because i've said
[44:43] it every other way if you have that
[44:46] desire to repent and line up with the
[44:47] word
[44:50] do not let satan tell you that it's
[44:52] something different than being the bride
[44:55] only the bride has that
[44:58] i'm not talking about fake repentance
[45:00] i'm not talking about a little bit
[45:01] repentance i'm talking about a full
[45:02] repentance to the word of god only the
[45:05] bride has that
[45:12] brother and says john 14 when he the
[45:14] holy ghost is come he will bring these
[45:16] things to your memory he will show you
[45:18] what day you're living in and then
[45:20] another thing you'll know by him
[45:23] him by
[45:24] he'll show you things to come
[45:27] see
[45:28] right back to the prophetic again
[45:31] when he's come
[45:34] brother branham says when he's come we
[45:36] don't look for nail scars
[45:38] we look for the word made manifest what
[45:41] is the word made manifest him showing
[45:45] things to come he declares something
[45:48] and then he manifests that thing that he
[45:50] declared that was to come brother
[45:52] branham says that is the holy ghost
[45:59] john 6
[46:00] 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[46:03] flesh prophetess nothing the words that
[46:04] i speak to you they are spirit
[46:07] what is spirit the words that i speak to
[46:09] you and they are life
[46:11] what are the words that i speak to you
[46:13] they are life
[46:14] what are the words that i speak to you
[46:15] they are spirit what is the spirit
[46:18] they're the words that i speak to you
[46:19] which is truth revealing the day that
[46:21] you're living in and telling you things
[46:22] to come
[46:25] you will not find any scriptures that
[46:26] says the holy spirit is screaming
[46:29] shouting
[46:30] jumping speaking in tongues prophecy
[46:32] ministry healing you will not find any
[46:35] scripture for that the only scriptures
[46:37] that you will find defining the baptism
[46:38] of the holy spirit and the new birth of
[46:40] receiving the holy ghost is receiving
[46:42] the truth for your age
[46:45] and i'll say like paul says
[46:47] if any man
[46:49] if any angel let alone a man
[46:51] if any angel preaches any other gospel
[46:53] let him be accursed
[46:55] if any minister would preach any other
[46:57] gospel to bring confusion to that let
[47:00] him be accursed per paul
[47:02] because let it be as simple as what god
[47:05] said it is
[47:06] the ability to receive truth for your
[47:08] age is the is receiving god's spirit
[47:13] don't take away from my comforter
[47:19] don't take away from the rose of sharon
[47:21] the prince of peace
[47:24] let him be as simple as what he wants to
[47:26] be
[47:26] let him be a comfort that he wants to be
[47:30] don't try to make his spirit something
[47:32] else
[47:38] john 6 28 then said they unto him what
[47:41] shall we do that we might work the works
[47:43] of god
[47:46] so if you have the spirit of god by
[47:47] default you're going to work the works
[47:49] of god correct
[47:52] and they ask him the question what might
[47:53] we do that we work the works of god
[47:56] jesus answered and said unto them
[47:59] this is the work of god
[48:03] this is the work of god that ye believe
[48:06] on him who he hath sent
[48:12] that's pretty simple
[48:14] allow it to be simple
[48:17] allow it to bring the comfort that
[48:20] simplicity brings
[48:26] the work of god
[48:29] there may be
[48:30] many works of god that christians do
[48:35] there may be many works of the spirit
[48:37] that people do
[48:39] prior to and after and maybe even during
[48:43] them receiving the true new birth and
[48:44] the baptism of the holy spirit
[48:47] but the one
[48:48] baseline evidence
[48:52] that all true born-again christians will
[48:55] have
[48:56] is that they will believe
[48:58] on whom god has sent
[49:03] also by default that means giving up
[49:06] your own idea
[49:08] because you cannot totally believe on
[49:10] whom god hath sent if you still reserve
[49:12] part of your opinion
[49:15] about what they had to say and whether
[49:17] they were right or not
[49:25] that is the work of the spirit of truth
[49:29] to remove your ideas
[49:32] about
[49:33] everything
[49:35] and to receive the ideas from the
[49:37] vindicated messenger messenger of god
[49:39] that he has sent
[49:41] if you can't do that do not try to tell
[49:44] me you have the holy spirit
[49:48] you can't have one without the other
[49:52] and again
[49:53] this brings us to a peculiar group of
[49:55] people
[49:56] because what people has the capacity to
[49:59] give up any of their own ideas and just
[50:03] believe
[50:04] a man
[50:07] it would have been fine if it was jesus
[50:08] christ he wasn't born in sin but now in
[50:10] our day we're talking about a man that
[50:12] was hybrid in his flesh
[50:15] and brother branham says the hardest
[50:16] thing that god has ever tried to do is
[50:18] get one man believe another
[50:21] so again saints
[50:22] look at the
[50:24] look at the capabilities that we have
[50:27] that no other human beings have
[50:30] we have an ability to forsake our own
[50:33] understanding and take what a vindicated
[50:36] prophet of god has said about everything
[50:40] and don't try to tell me you're doing
[50:41] the works of god if you haven't done
[50:42] that first
[50:44] because per the scripture that is the
[50:47] baseline work of god that's where you
[50:49] have to start forsaking your own ideas
[50:52] and believing on who him whom god hath
[50:55] sent
[50:58] if you have not totally sold out
[51:01] to him whom god hath sent and just in
[51:03] case somebody doesn't know him whom god
[51:06] hath sent in our age was william branham
[51:08] brother william branham i'll make it
[51:10] really clear i'll even spell it if you
[51:12] want me to so there's no
[51:13] misunderstanding that was the one that
[51:15] god sent and that is the one that you
[51:17] have to sell out all of your thinking to
[51:21] because
[51:22] that is whom god sent
[51:25] and that is the only way that you can
[51:27] even
[51:28] start to have the spirit of truth in the
[51:30] holy spirit and the new birth
[51:32] is to default
[51:34] to whom god hath sent that's not my
[51:36] words that's jesus's words they ask him
[51:39] the question point blank how can we work
[51:41] the works of god
[51:44] believe on whom i've sent to you
[51:47] i've got nothing else to say on the
[51:49] topic jesus said it
[51:56] john 8 48
[51:58] jesus said unto them
[52:00] if god were your father you would have
[52:02] loved me for i proceeded forth and come
[52:04] from god neither came i of myself but he
[52:08] sent me
[52:09] so he's making it real clear for them oh
[52:11] by the way i'm the one that he sent if
[52:13] you don't believe on me you're going to
[52:14] die in your sins
[52:17] why do you not understand my speech
[52:21] even because you cannot hear my word
[52:26] ye of ye are of your father the devil
[52:33] and the lust of your father ye will do
[52:35] what was the lust of their father
[52:38] keeping his own
[52:44] opinion what did the fairs
[52:47] i'm not making that upstairs what did
[52:48] the pharisees do they kept their own
[52:50] opinion
[52:53] jesus said you're going to do what your
[52:54] father did
[52:56] well if we don't know what the father
[52:57] did we just have to wait and see what
[52:58] the pharisees did and then we'll know
[53:00] what their father did what did the
[53:01] pharisees do they kept their own opinion
[53:03] of the word and the of whom god sent
[53:07] that's what satan did in the beginning
[53:11] that's what cain did god told him do
[53:13] this like your brother what did cain do
[53:15] he kept his own opinion
[53:20] spirits die or i'm sorry men die spirits
[53:23] don't die
[53:25] what did the scripture say how can you
[53:26] discern between the spirit of right and
[53:28] wrong
[53:32] forsaking your own opinion
[53:36] year of your father the devil and the
[53:37] lust of your father ye will do he was
[53:39] the murderer he was a murderer from the
[53:41] beginning a murder of what a murderer of
[53:42] the truth
[53:45] and abode not in the truth
[53:47] because there is no truth in him
[53:51] look at the definitions that he's
[53:53] attaching to this
[53:54] why didn't he just say he was nasty he
[53:56] was evil he murdered he did this because
[53:58] he wanted us to know and properly be
[54:00] able to discern
[54:02] in the final closing moments of time
[54:04] between right and wrong
[54:08] he abode not in the truth
[54:13] because there is no truth in him
[54:15] when he speaketh the lie he speaketh of
[54:17] his own
[54:18] his own what his own opinion
[54:22] he is a liar and the father of it
[54:25] and because i tell you the truth ye
[54:28] believe me not speaking to them not us
[54:31] we believe him when he tells us the
[54:33] truth
[54:34] because that's what our father did
[54:39] you say well how do you know that's what
[54:41] your father did because what i do
[54:43] brother brandon says he spoke his word
[54:45] he had to believe his own word for it to
[54:46] manifest
[54:49] so even if i didn't know what the father
[54:50] did i can recognize what i'm doing and
[54:52] what am i doing now that i've received
[54:54] the spirit of truth i believe the truth
[54:56] i believe the word i believe on whom he
[54:58] whom he hath sent
[54:59] and if that's what i'm doing as his son
[55:01] that means that must have been what he
[55:02] did
[55:06] 65 ashamed
[55:10] when god made the promise of the baptism
[55:12] of the holy ghost and you receive it
[55:15] there is something that settles within
[55:17] you
[55:17] that there is nothing takes its place
[55:21] hold this phrase
[55:24] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[55:26] ghost
[55:27] now i'm going to continue
[55:29] when a man ever meets god
[55:34] not in some emotional workup some
[55:36] enthusiasm or some religious doctrine
[55:38] some catechism or creed or a dog dogma
[55:40] that he has accepted for a comfort for
[55:42] himself but when he really comes to the
[55:45] place like moses did on the side of the
[55:47] desert
[55:48] walk up face to face with almighty god
[55:52] and you see
[55:53] the voice speaking to you
[55:56] exactly with the word and the promise of
[55:58] the hour there is something it does to
[56:02] you
[56:03] see you're not ashamed of it it does
[56:07] something to you
[56:08] now i want to go back and just pull the
[56:10] phrases that he attaches to this
[56:14] what does something to you
[56:16] the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:19] when a man ever meets god
[56:22] face to face with almighty god
[56:24] the voice speaking to you
[56:27] exactly with the word and promise for
[56:30] the hour
[56:32] those four descriptions are the same
[56:33] thing
[56:35] if you ever meet god face to face he's
[56:38] going to tell you the word exactly for
[56:40] the hour that and promise for the age
[56:42] that you're living in that is you
[56:45] meeting god and that is the baptism of
[56:48] the holy spirit
[56:50] you're not ever going to have any of
[56:52] those happen without all four of them
[56:53] happening
[56:59] i'll say it again
[57:00] it really is that simple
[57:06] all right
[57:12] continuing in ashamed now we're going to
[57:14] take a little bit of a turn here because
[57:15] remember we started out the ability to
[57:17] judge between truth and error
[57:21] he says remember
[57:22] you might meet a spirit that would act
[57:25] like god
[57:29] a spirit that would act like god
[57:33] you might meet a spirit would do this
[57:35] that or the other follow it a little bit
[57:37] and see how it compares with the word of
[57:39] god
[57:41] it's pretty good advice
[57:44] because the word of god is the spirit of
[57:46] god and if i want to discern this spirit
[57:48] maybe i'll see what it does with the
[57:49] word maybe i'll see what it does with
[57:51] whom he hath sent
[57:54] maybe i'll see what it does with the
[57:55] promise for this hour
[57:58] then i can accurately discern the spirit
[58:02] he says this spirit might be acting like
[58:05] god though
[58:07] maybe it's coming on a white horse
[58:10] but it don't have any arrows
[58:15] you might meet a spirit that would act
[58:16] like god you might meet a spirit would
[58:18] do this that or the other follow it a
[58:20] little bit and see how it compares with
[58:21] the word of god you might meet a spirit
[58:24] that would tell you you are saved and
[58:27] give you a glorious feeling
[58:30] and you would shout and scream
[58:33] then when it comes to denying the word
[58:35] how can the holy spirit that wrote the
[58:36] word deny his own word
[58:42] that's deceptive saints this is a spirit
[58:44] this is not a spirit acting like a man
[58:47] with a you know
[58:48] fork tongue and horns and a sharp pokey
[58:51] spear
[58:54] this is a spirit
[58:56] that would act like god in so much that
[58:58] it would try to tell you that you are
[59:00] saved and give you a glorious feeling to
[59:03] make you shout and scream
[59:12] you say that's that's close i'll never
[59:14] be able to discern that you're right you
[59:16] won't only the word can
[59:21] that's why he doesn't say
[59:23] anything else to do
[59:25] except for check it by the word
[59:27] see how it responds to the word see how
[59:30] it responds now we say that and we
[59:33] oh yeah of course we
[59:35] we check it by the word no we have to
[59:38] check it by the word of he whom was sent
[59:43] that's the big difference
[59:45] it's not you going back and picking up
[59:47] the scripture and trying to discern
[59:49] whether it's right or wrong you can't
[59:51] even discern that scripture without he
[59:53] whom he hath sent
[59:56] so when i say you ha when you have to
[59:58] check by the word i'm not saying you
[1:00:00] check it by the word through your own
[1:00:01] filter
[1:00:02] you check it through he whom he hath
[1:00:04] sent filter
[1:00:06] because if not you're going to find
[1:00:08] yourself giving over to that spirit
[1:00:10] that's acting like god and making you
[1:00:11] believe that you're saved because it
[1:00:12] gave you a glorious feeling to make you
[1:00:14] scream and shout or some other gift of
[1:00:16] the spirit or some other sensation
[1:00:19] it is only if you run it through the
[1:00:21] filter of he whom he hath sent that you
[1:00:24] will be properly judging it by the word
[1:00:28] remember the baseline evidence
[1:00:31] is believing on he whom he had sent
[1:00:34] that's the work of god that's the work
[1:00:36] of the spirit of the truth that's the
[1:00:37] baseline we can never deviate away from
[1:00:39] that as we progress
[1:00:41] he says you might meet a spirit that
[1:00:43] would tell you you are saved and give
[1:00:44] you a glorious feeling now here's the
[1:00:46] question
[1:00:49] here's the question
[1:00:51] why
[1:00:53] why if the devil is such an evil
[1:00:55] horrible fellow would he do that
[1:01:00] why wouldn't he just come and tell you
[1:01:01] you're a rotten piece of earth and you
[1:01:03] don't stand a chance
[1:01:06] that's true
[1:01:08] that's true
[1:01:11] but he knows that'll never cut it with
[1:01:12] the believer because there's something
[1:01:13] in the believer that they keep coming
[1:01:15] back and he don't know that they're a
[1:01:17] believer
[1:01:18] but he just has to deal with this person
[1:01:20] that won't quit repenting
[1:01:23] like give it up already you're a
[1:01:25] worthless piece of dirt
[1:01:27] you will never line up to the word of
[1:01:29] god
[1:01:30] and then you repent again and he's like
[1:01:32] just go away already so finally remember
[1:01:35] the brother brother says he's a very
[1:01:37] shrewd smart individual he's not some
[1:01:39] dummy
[1:01:41] so if you have somebody who won't quit
[1:01:43] repenting because they know they're not
[1:01:45] right with god what other options do you
[1:01:47] have besides trying to tell them okay
[1:01:49] you're okay now
[1:01:51] whether they're not whether they are or
[1:01:53] not
[1:01:55] if that's what they're after
[1:01:57] and he only knows that by their actions
[1:01:59] but they keep repenting and they keep
[1:02:01] seeking god and they keep seeking the
[1:02:02] word
[1:02:03] finally he's going to recognize you know
[1:02:05] what telling them they're never going to
[1:02:07] get it it's not going to work
[1:02:09] telling them that they're worthless and
[1:02:11] they'll never arrive like they already
[1:02:12] got that they understand they're okay
[1:02:14] with that they believe that
[1:02:19] i'm just gonna i'm just gonna have to
[1:02:21] tell them that they've made it
[1:02:24] i'm just going to have to act like the
[1:02:27] one that they're seeking
[1:02:30] and tell them they're okay
[1:02:33] that's the only chance he has saints
[1:02:36] because if not you're just going to keep
[1:02:37] repenting until you really do get it so
[1:02:40] before you do really get it here he
[1:02:42] comes this is his last tactic
[1:02:46] i'm going to tell him they've arrived
[1:02:47] when they really haven't
[1:02:51] and that will get you every time if you
[1:02:52] don't check it by the word
[1:02:55] from whom he hath sent
[1:02:58] because the word from whom he hath sent
[1:03:00] will be the word for your age and that's
[1:03:03] the one thing the devil will not do
[1:03:06] he'll tell you you're saved he'll tell
[1:03:08] you you're okay he'll give you glorious
[1:03:10] sensations he'll give you glorious gifts
[1:03:12] he'll give you glorious manifestations
[1:03:14] but one thing that he will not go close
[1:03:16] to
[1:03:17] is letting you see the word for your day
[1:03:21] because by default if he allows you to
[1:03:23] do that
[1:03:24] you've arrived and you really have got
[1:03:26] it and brother branham says he can't go
[1:03:27] that far
[1:03:28] he has no capability to go that far
[1:03:30] that's not my idea take it back to cain
[1:03:34] cain could not go that far judas could
[1:03:36] not go that far the pharisees could not
[1:03:38] go that far
[1:03:40] they could come all the way up brother
[1:03:42] brandon says judas could come all the
[1:03:44] way up
[1:03:45] but could not go to pentecost
[1:03:48] he won't go that far
[1:03:50] but he will go right up to that
[1:03:55] so the only way that you can make sure
[1:03:57] that this is not a deceiving spirit
[1:04:00] that's trying to tell you you are saved
[1:04:02] when you're really not is if you check
[1:04:04] it and see whether it's telling you the
[1:04:06] revealed word for your day
[1:04:09] and again you will not know the revealed
[1:04:12] word for your day unless you first
[1:04:13] received him whom he had sent
[1:04:16] i know i keep going around and around
[1:04:18] the cow shed but somebody's going to
[1:04:19] catch it this morning
[1:04:22] allow it to be that simple saints
[1:04:24] because if not we're going to find
[1:04:26] ourselves deceived
[1:04:27] we're going brother branham says the
[1:04:29] satan's deception today right now his
[1:04:32] deception was one thing
[1:04:34] to make people believe they're saved
[1:04:36] when they're not
[1:04:40] it's the religious spirit
[1:04:42] he's had his days to where he would just
[1:04:44] kill you if you profess the name of
[1:04:46] jesus christ he had those days
[1:04:49] but it didn't work he tried to kill it
[1:04:51] out which is what brotherhood says
[1:04:53] that's what he would do to you right now
[1:04:54] if god would allow him but he can't take
[1:04:56] your life
[1:04:57] so because he can't take your life and
[1:04:59] take you off the scene the fact that you
[1:05:02] keep repenting and lining yourself up
[1:05:04] with the word of god he only has one
[1:05:06] tactic left
[1:05:10] he's got to make you think you're okay
[1:05:12] when you're not
[1:05:14] and the only way that you'll properly be
[1:05:16] able to discern that is if you take it
[1:05:18] back to the words of the prophet if
[1:05:20] you'll take it back to the teaching and
[1:05:22] the principles that brother branham laid
[1:05:24] out
[1:05:25] it's the only way that you're going to
[1:05:26] be okay and properly discern it
[1:05:30] so
[1:05:31] this is the little angle that we're
[1:05:32] going off on here
[1:05:35] is
[1:05:37] as we come to the closing moments of
[1:05:39] time remember the scripture said it
[1:05:40] would be so close it would deceive the
[1:05:42] very elective it was possible
[1:05:45] and this is all hinging on the new birth
[1:05:48] this is all hinging on the true baptism
[1:05:49] of the holy spirit
[1:05:53] so that is what
[1:05:54] once you receive that like satan's done
[1:05:57] we have that understanding right like
[1:05:58] once you're born again satan's done so
[1:06:01] whatever
[1:06:02] whatever he's going to accomplish or try
[1:06:05] to accomplish prior to that he has to do
[1:06:07] prior to that
[1:06:09] because once you've arrived you you've
[1:06:10] arrived like you can't be born again and
[1:06:13] then unborn again
[1:06:17] you can backslide we all know that
[1:06:19] that's not what i'm talking about we're
[1:06:20] talking about the soul we're talking
[1:06:22] about the new birth we're talking about
[1:06:23] receiving the spirit of truth
[1:06:25] once you receive the spirit of truth you
[1:06:27] can't unreceive the spirit of truth
[1:06:29] you can receive a spirit of partial
[1:06:31] truth and then unreceive a spirit of
[1:06:32] partial truth but you can't unreceive
[1:06:35] the spirit of the truth
[1:06:38] because it's a person
[1:06:41] and once you've got jesus you can't lose
[1:06:43] jesus because it wasn't you getting
[1:06:45] jesus to begin with it was jesus getting
[1:06:47] you
[1:06:49] so whatever he's going to deceive
[1:06:52] whatever deception he's going to bring
[1:06:54] on the scene that would deceive the very
[1:06:56] elected he has to do it prior to your
[1:06:58] new birth
[1:07:02] and it's not the deceiving times won't
[1:07:04] happen after the new birth
[1:07:07] but the ability to discern those and
[1:07:10] withstand those
[1:07:13] lays within the new birth
[1:07:16] so it's not that deception won't be
[1:07:18] attempted or tried
[1:07:19] or that deception quits coming it keeps
[1:07:23] coming
[1:07:24] but after this
[1:07:26] you're not going to be deceived you may
[1:07:28] be confused
[1:07:30] you may be confused for a long
[1:07:33] long time
[1:07:35] but at the end of it you're not going to
[1:07:37] be deceived
[1:07:41] he says
[1:07:43] you might meet a spirit that would tell
[1:07:44] you you're saved and give you a glorious
[1:07:46] feeling you would shout and scream
[1:07:48] then when it comes to denying the word
[1:07:49] how can the holy spirit that wrote the
[1:07:51] word deny his own word that spirit must
[1:07:53] punctuate every promise of god with an
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] if it isn't
[1:07:58] then you never met god
[1:08:00] you met a deceiving spirit
[1:08:03] and the world is full of it today
[1:08:08] 1965 the easter seal
[1:08:10] and the same thing is with every true
[1:08:12] believer when the preaching of god's
[1:08:15] word comes forth
[1:08:17] hold that in your mind
[1:08:19] when the preaching of god's word comes
[1:08:21] forth
[1:08:22] and it's vindicated
[1:08:24] and proved that it's god work god's word
[1:08:27] for this hour
[1:08:30] then there's something within the
[1:08:32] believer
[1:08:33] if that church is teaching contrary to
[1:08:36] this hour of the baptism
[1:08:38] of the holy ghost message
[1:08:43] what is the message
[1:08:45] the holy ghost message
[1:08:48] what is the message for this hour the
[1:08:50] holy ghost message
[1:08:53] what is the preaching of god's word that
[1:08:55] is to come forth the holy ghost message
[1:09:00] he
[1:09:01] the spirit of truth
[1:09:03] that is what is to come forth
[1:09:06] there's something in him that screams
[1:09:07] out now when this holy spirit
[1:09:09] represented as the eagle flying over the
[1:09:11] land and finds the believer it isn't
[1:09:14] your own thinking your own drawing it's
[1:09:17] god drawing now the holy spirit is here
[1:09:20] on earth looking out those individuals
[1:09:23] that god has ordained to life in this
[1:09:24] age and as soon as it finds it it does
[1:09:27] just like it did on jesus christ the
[1:09:29] great super son of god who redeemed us
[1:09:31] all it comes down watch what it does it
[1:09:35] comes down and takes its place of abode
[1:09:38] in the human life now notice it brought
[1:09:40] the quickening power now that quickening
[1:09:43] power that comes that came upon jesus
[1:09:46] quickened him to manifest
[1:09:48] the promise
[1:09:50] manifest what promise
[1:09:52] the promise for his age
[1:09:56] but look what he says now
[1:09:58] to manifest every promise
[1:10:01] of the word of that day
[1:10:04] so does the holy spirit that came upon
[1:10:07] us in this day
[1:10:09] if it's not a mockery holy spirit
[1:10:16] a mockery holy spirit
[1:10:20] talk about deception
[1:10:22] satan again is not coming riding on a
[1:10:25] black horse as the grim reaper
[1:10:28] he is coming
[1:10:30] as a spirit that would make you
[1:10:33] feel that believe that you're saved when
[1:10:35] you're not he is coming as a
[1:10:39] mockery
[1:10:40] holy spirit
[1:10:46] this this so jumped out to me when i was
[1:10:49] listening to this in this terminology
[1:10:52] a mockery
[1:10:54] holy spirit
[1:10:56] if i was a mockery holy spirit what
[1:11:00] would i do
[1:11:06] i'm going to back up once one step
[1:11:10] the only thing that i can't do
[1:11:13] is reveal the truth for the age that you
[1:11:16] live in
[1:11:17] because if i do that
[1:11:19] i'm the holy spirit
[1:11:22] but i'm only a mockery holy spirit so if
[1:11:26] i am a if i want to be the best
[1:11:30] mockery holy spirit
[1:11:33] in the closing moments of time where i
[1:11:36] will deceive the very elect if it was
[1:11:38] possible what all would i do
[1:11:45] i would do
[1:11:47] everything the holy spirit does
[1:11:50] except for tell them the truth for the
[1:11:52] day that they live in based upon the
[1:11:55] message of whom god hath sent
[1:12:00] that's what i would do
[1:12:01] maybe i'm just a dummy but that seems
[1:12:03] like the right thing to do if i want to
[1:12:05] be a
[1:12:06] really good mockery holy spirit
[1:12:09] now if i
[1:12:10] wanted to just be an evil spirit i'd
[1:12:12] come make you commit adultery smoke
[1:12:14] cigarettes live in sin i'd just make you
[1:12:16] do all that other stuff
[1:12:18] but if i was really trying to get as
[1:12:20] many as i could and if i was really
[1:12:22] trying to get the elect if it was
[1:12:24] possible
[1:12:25] i know
[1:12:26] remember brother brown says satan is a
[1:12:28] religious spirit he knows
[1:12:31] he knows he's not going to get us out
[1:12:33] there we've already seen too much
[1:12:37] so the only thing that he can do is
[1:12:39] imitate as best as he can that real holy
[1:12:43] spirit but remember there's a line that
[1:12:45] he can't cross or he would be the holy
[1:12:47] spirit
[1:12:50] if i was going to be the best mockery
[1:12:52] holy spirit
[1:12:54] i would do every manifestation and every
[1:12:58] gift
[1:13:00] and every emotional realm workup that i
[1:13:04] could
[1:13:09] but i sure wouldn't let you know what
[1:13:10] the truth of the hour was
[1:13:14] and i sure wouldn't let you know that if
[1:13:16] you have the ability to repent and
[1:13:18] constantly line yourself up with the
[1:13:19] truth of the hour that that means that
[1:13:20] you're broad i sure wouldn't tell you
[1:13:23] that
[1:13:25] i definitely would make it way more
[1:13:27] complicated than that
[1:13:31] and i would definitely tell you
[1:13:33] every time you messed up
[1:13:35] and didn't line up with the word
[1:13:38] and i would say that right there's your
[1:13:39] evidence because you're not lining up
[1:13:42] with the word
[1:13:44] i would tell i would i if i was going to
[1:13:47] be the best mockery holy spirit i would
[1:13:50] probably even tell you that more than
[1:13:51] once a day
[1:13:53] but that's that's just me i don't know
[1:13:55] what he would do
[1:13:56] i've never really dealt with him you
[1:13:58] know
[1:14:00] but that's probably what i would do
[1:14:03] if it's not a mockery
[1:14:06] holy spirit
[1:14:08] by default that means there is a mockery
[1:14:11] holy spirit like it or not
[1:14:15] if it's not the devil mocking the holy
[1:14:18] spirit but if it's the real true holy
[1:14:22] spirit it'll manifest the promise of
[1:14:25] this
[1:14:26] hour
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:30] you say well what is the promise promise
[1:14:32] of this hour
[1:14:34] glad i don't have to use my own
[1:14:35] interpretation there because the prophet
[1:14:37] interpreted that for us he says what is
[1:14:39] the bride
[1:14:41] the manifestation of this hour
[1:14:44] what is the manifestation of this hour
[1:14:46] the bride what is the bride the word
[1:14:48] made manifest
[1:14:50] the whole word made manifest that's this
[1:14:53] hour not impartiality
[1:14:57] so the one thing the devil is not going
[1:14:59] to tell you
[1:15:01] is that you are the bride and you are
[1:15:02] the fullness of the word made manifest
[1:15:04] in this hour
[1:15:07] he'll tell you everything other than
[1:15:09] that some bad
[1:15:11] some good
[1:15:14] because you have this gift in your life
[1:15:17] means you're okay means you're the bride
[1:15:19] he'll tell you that
[1:15:22] you're a minister there's no way that
[1:15:25] you're not the bride
[1:15:27] you believe god sent a prophet there's
[1:15:30] no way
[1:15:31] that you're not the bride
[1:15:35] he believes god sent a prophet
[1:15:39] but he sure won't repent and line up
[1:15:41] with what he had to say
[1:15:45] see the difference
[1:15:47] see the difference
[1:15:48] the ability to repent and line up with
[1:15:51] the spirit of truth is the only evidence
[1:15:53] you can hang your soul on saints
[1:15:55] it's the only one you can hang your soul
[1:15:58] on
[1:15:59] it'll manifest the promise of this hour
[1:16:01] notice if he's a true eagle he will
[1:16:04] understand the message of the hour if
[1:16:06] he's an eagle
[1:16:08] you say ah
[1:16:10] it's too deep i can't understand it if
[1:16:12] you're an eagle you will understand the
[1:16:14] message of the hour
[1:16:17] what really is the problem when people
[1:16:19] confess that is they make the message
[1:16:22] more complicated than what it really is
[1:16:25] when you make the message more
[1:16:26] complicated what than what it is then
[1:16:29] you can't understand it but i just want
[1:16:31] you to answer me one question
[1:16:33] if in malachi 4
[1:16:35] god sent you a prophet
[1:16:40] you have to make that personal because
[1:16:41] if you just say god sent a prophet it
[1:16:43] does no good the devil believes that
[1:16:46] but if god sent you a prophet
[1:16:50] and you can't understand the principles
[1:16:53] of what he had to teach
[1:16:55] what good did it do for god to send a
[1:16:57] prophet
[1:16:59] and if you are the elect of god
[1:17:03] why would god send you a prophet you
[1:17:05] can't understand
[1:17:07] see the problem is we let that little
[1:17:10] deceiving mockery holy spirit come in
[1:17:13] and try to make it something more deep
[1:17:14] and more mysterious than what it really
[1:17:17] is
[1:17:18] and it's not that it's not deep and it's
[1:17:20] not that it's not mysterious as brother
[1:17:23] chad said a little while back the
[1:17:24] message is simple but it's not
[1:17:26] simplistic
[1:17:30] there is a truth to that it is deep it
[1:17:32] is mysterious but i'll tell you the most
[1:17:34] deepest and mysterious thing in the
[1:17:36] whole wide world you want to hear what
[1:17:38] that is
[1:17:39] it's a people
[1:17:42] that will continually
[1:17:44] come to a service and get called out
[1:17:46] about what is wrong in their life and
[1:17:48] repent and line up to the true word of
[1:17:51] god
[1:17:52] that's the most mysterious thing in the
[1:17:54] world
[1:17:56] you say well no it's not yes it is
[1:17:58] because the person that's telling them
[1:18:01] and calling them out
[1:18:03] and preaching the true word of god
[1:18:06] is born in sin and shaped an iniquity of
[1:18:08] themselves it would be no mystery if
[1:18:10] jesus christ was standing here himself
[1:18:12] in his 16 elements
[1:18:14] and preaching to us well that would be
[1:18:16] easy to line up with
[1:18:18] but now he would come and use a hybrid
[1:18:20] vessel to preach the true word of god
[1:18:22] and a people would be able to receive
[1:18:25] that and line up to it
[1:18:27] that's deep that's mysterious
[1:18:30] brother iran says that's the hardest
[1:18:31] thing god has ever had to do
[1:18:39] now the little eagle probably in the
[1:18:41] barnyard barnyard
[1:18:43] was eating all right but he knowed it
[1:18:46] wasn't just exactly right
[1:18:49] but then when he heard the truth
[1:18:52] then he received the truth
[1:18:55] now in john 5 24 jesus said he that
[1:18:57] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:19:00] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:19:03] shall not come unto the judgment but is
[1:19:04] passed from death and to life
[1:19:06] just
[1:19:07] think how simple that is
[1:19:13] he that believeth
[1:19:16] now the correct way of saying that is he
[1:19:19] that understandeth
[1:19:23] so the prophet even comes along and says
[1:19:26] think how simple that is
[1:19:28] the ability
[1:19:30] to understand
[1:19:32] the spiritual principles
[1:19:34] from he whom god hath sent
[1:19:38] remember understanding the spiritual
[1:19:40] principles does not mean that you can go
[1:19:42] to somebody and tie it together from
[1:19:44] genesis to revelation you may have no
[1:19:46] capacity to do that
[1:19:48] it takes a gift to do that
[1:19:49] even gifts have a problem doing that
[1:19:53] that does not mean that you do not
[1:19:55] understand the message the message is
[1:19:59] the principles from the tree of life
[1:20:03] the message is the principles of truth
[1:20:06] and you receive the principles of truth
[1:20:10] when you receive that and you repent of
[1:20:12] your own ideas and line up to that
[1:20:18] you can receive the principles of the
[1:20:20] message and not be able to rightly
[1:20:23] divide
[1:20:24] the message to anybody
[1:20:26] that has nothing to do with it
[1:20:28] it takes a gift to
[1:20:30] to divide that brother brandon even so
[1:20:32] much in questions and answers he says go
[1:20:34] be a witness go be like go go tell
[1:20:36] somebody about the love of christ he
[1:20:38] says but
[1:20:39] now if it comes to something you just
[1:20:40] can't tie together he says that's fine
[1:20:42] take them to the pastor
[1:20:46] didn't say that means you're backslid
[1:20:47] that means you're not elect that means
[1:20:48] you're not bright he didn't he didn't
[1:20:49] make any qualms about it he says that's
[1:20:51] fine just tell them about the love of
[1:20:53] christ if it comes to something you
[1:20:54] can't tie together in the scriptures
[1:20:55] that's what the preachers are for
[1:20:57] that's what those gifts are for that
[1:20:59] doesn't make them any better because
[1:21:01] they may not even have been able to
[1:21:02] testify to that person
[1:21:07] it doesn't make anybody better or less
[1:21:09] or anything it's just operating in the
[1:21:11] capacity and the ability that god has
[1:21:13] given to us
[1:21:15] i want to lay emphasis on letting it be
[1:21:18] as simple as god made it
[1:21:20] because if you don't
[1:21:23] you're not going to stand the test of
[1:21:25] time that is coming you are not going to
[1:21:28] stand the pressure that is coming
[1:21:30] you are going to be deceived by some
[1:21:32] other spirit
[1:21:33] that would tell you you're okay when
[1:21:35] you're not
[1:21:36] line up with the word of god and when
[1:21:39] you line up with the word of god
[1:21:41] let it mean what it means
[1:21:44] for you to have that ability
[1:21:48] i've been a little over an hour now
[1:21:51] so we're going to come to a close
[1:21:53] i want to read you a couple more quotes
[1:21:55] if that's okay do i need to make you
[1:21:56] stand up and do jumping jacks run some
[1:21:59] laps
[1:22:00] stand on your head
[1:22:02] okay
[1:22:04] in the church age book brother branham
[1:22:05] says now get the real meaning of what
[1:22:07] we're going into i must caution you to
[1:22:10] ever keep in mind that religion
[1:22:12] spiritual matters if you like is
[1:22:15] composed of two parts that intertwine
[1:22:19] but are as opposite as black and white
[1:22:21] religion
[1:22:22] and spiritual world and the spiritual
[1:22:25] world are made of these two trees which
[1:22:28] had their roots in eden
[1:22:29] both the tree of life and the tree of
[1:22:31] the knowledge of good and evil stood in
[1:22:33] the midst of the garden and no doubt
[1:22:34] their very branch branches intertwined
[1:22:37] with each other
[1:22:39] the church is made up of the same
[1:22:43] it is made up of good and bad remember
[1:22:45] he says the spiritual world and the
[1:22:47] religious world
[1:22:48] they intertwine they're made up of the
[1:22:51] same good and bad
[1:22:53] two vines make the church
[1:22:56] but one is true
[1:22:59] the other is false catch this statement
[1:23:02] this is profound
[1:23:04] now god will
[1:23:07] speak to each one
[1:23:13] he just says there's true and there's
[1:23:15] false and god will speak to both of them
[1:23:18] god will talk to the false fun
[1:23:22] god will speak to this false fine
[1:23:28] not kind of speak will speak god
[1:23:32] will
[1:23:33] speak to the mockery holy spirit
[1:23:36] to the false vine
[1:23:38] that's why people like to make prophecy
[1:23:40] and whether it comes to pass the end-all
[1:23:42] be-all but it's not
[1:23:44] just because somebody prophesies and it
[1:23:46] comes to pass that is not the end-all
[1:23:48] be-all the prophecy must line up with
[1:23:50] the word
[1:23:52] the prophecy must line up with the
[1:23:54] characteristics and the principles of
[1:23:56] the vindicated messenger for that age
[1:23:59] look at balaam did what balaam say come
[1:24:02] to pass
[1:24:03] yes
[1:24:05] who was talking to balaam
[1:24:10] god was talking to balaam brother
[1:24:12] branham says god will talk to both vines
[1:24:16] he will give them prophecies he will
[1:24:18] give them ministries he will give them
[1:24:20] gifts remember god talking is not
[1:24:22] necessarily verbage it may be
[1:24:24] manifestations that is god talking
[1:24:27] god will talk through a healing ministry
[1:24:29] god will talk through the gift of
[1:24:30] prophecy god will talk through the gift
[1:24:32] of discernment god will talk he will
[1:24:34] speak to the false vine
[1:24:37] gifts and callings are without
[1:24:38] repentance
[1:24:42] now god will speak to each one and he
[1:24:46] will talk about each one
[1:24:52] he will call them the church
[1:24:55] both groups
[1:24:57] he will call them the church
[1:25:01] and only the elect will really know
[1:25:03] which is the true spirit
[1:25:06] only the elect will not be deceived
[1:25:11] this is god himself
[1:25:13] speaking to truvine and the false fine
[1:25:16] he will speak to them
[1:25:20] he will speak about them
[1:25:23] and brother branham says only the elect
[1:25:26] have the capability to discern
[1:25:30] what he's really saying
[1:25:32] and which is which file
[1:25:36] like i said don't ever take lightly the
[1:25:38] capabilities that we have
[1:25:40] to hear the truth
[1:25:42] and to know that he's talking to us
[1:25:44] we should never underestimate that
[1:25:46] ability in that capability
[1:25:49] only the elect will not be deceived
[1:25:51] matthew 24 24 for there there shall
[1:25:54] arrive false christ false christ false
[1:25:57] anointed ones we know this
[1:25:59] false prophets shall show great signs
[1:26:02] and wonders and so much that if it were
[1:26:03] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:26:05] elect so way back there in the early
[1:26:07] church a very short period after
[1:26:08] pentecost the false vine got to
[1:26:11] intertwine itself around the true vine
[1:26:13] and we find the deeds of the
[1:26:14] nickelodeons what that was the deeds of
[1:26:16] the niculadians to overthrow the laity
[1:26:21] and that spirit is going to be found
[1:26:23] fighting the true vine until it is
[1:26:25] destroyed by god what spirit
[1:26:29] the false vine spirit a spirit a mockery
[1:26:32] holy spirit
[1:26:34] is what's going to be fighting the true
[1:26:35] vine a mockery holy spirit that god will
[1:26:38] speak to
[1:26:41] and about
[1:26:47] that's why god speaking through somebody
[1:26:49] is not even any evidence
[1:26:52] god may speak through somebody and it's
[1:26:54] no evidence god spoke through a donkey
[1:26:56] one time you think he had the holy ghost
[1:27:04] it'll be so closely to deceive the very
[1:27:05] elected
[1:27:07] that is why above all things saints
[1:27:10] above all things and i shared this with
[1:27:11] brother chad i said you know we we pray
[1:27:13] as we're coming to minister you know
[1:27:15] what the mind of the lord is and what we
[1:27:17] what he wants us to say i said but
[1:27:18] anymore i don't even feel like preaching
[1:27:20] i said i just want to stand before the
[1:27:22] people and tell them how grateful that i
[1:27:23] am that god sent me a voice that i know
[1:27:25] the right the way of right and wrong
[1:27:30] god sent me a voice
[1:27:34] god sent he loved me so much that he
[1:27:38] sent me a voice
[1:27:41] that i would not be deceived because if
[1:27:42] it wasn't for that voice i would not
[1:27:44] stand a chance and as we see the world
[1:27:47] dissolving into chaos and madness on
[1:27:49] every handstand people are losing their
[1:27:51] mind i cannot tell you in the last month
[1:27:54] how many phone calls i've got just
[1:27:55] because of the nature of the business
[1:27:57] that i do of people out of their minds i
[1:27:59] don't know what spirit was released in
[1:28:01] the last month but it was a bad one and
[1:28:03] people are insane they are absolutely
[1:28:06] nuts
[1:28:10] people brother brown says it's going to
[1:28:11] be what they've seen in their
[1:28:13] imagination becoming real before them
[1:28:15] but they won't know that it's not real
[1:28:17] i'm telling you saints we have arrived
[1:28:20] we have arrived if you knew of the
[1:28:22] amount of people that thought that there
[1:28:23] was cameras in their house and people
[1:28:25] listening to them
[1:28:26] and drones flying around following them
[1:28:28] each and every day and radar affecting
[1:28:30] their body and people are believing that
[1:28:33] other people have the capability to
[1:28:35] implant something in their brain and
[1:28:37] speak to them they call it a voice to
[1:28:38] brain technology
[1:28:40] and they want me to fix it i can't fix
[1:28:43] it
[1:28:45] doesn't matter how much you pay me i
[1:28:46] can't fix it
[1:28:48] i've got something that will fix it but
[1:28:50] i can't fix it but i'm telling you i
[1:28:52] don't know what released that spirit but
[1:28:54] it is it is rampant right now people are
[1:28:57] losing their minds they are crazy
[1:29:03] and i would be the same way
[1:29:05] and you would be the same way
[1:29:08] if god had not loved us enough to send
[1:29:10] us a voice
[1:29:12] and that's all that i want to declare
[1:29:14] this morning as we stand i'm just going
[1:29:15] to stop if i go farther we're going to
[1:29:17] be here for another hour but i want to
[1:29:19] stand here and declare thank you god
[1:29:22] thank you jesus that you loved me
[1:29:25] that you would send me a voice so that i
[1:29:28] would be able to properly discern as the
[1:29:29] musicians would come that i could
[1:29:31] properly discern between right and wrong
[1:29:33] and that i would be able to properly
[1:29:35] discern who he the spirit of truth is
[1:29:39] saints of god forsake your own idea
[1:29:44] believe on him he whom god hath sent
[1:29:47] totally
[1:29:48] forsake all
[1:29:50] give over to that voice it's the only
[1:29:52] chance we have and god loved you and me
[1:29:55] enough
[1:29:56] that he would not let us be deceived but
[1:29:58] he would send us a voice how grateful we
[1:30:00] should be saints
[1:30:02] there is a lot of things to preach there
[1:30:04] is a lot of glorious things in the word
[1:30:06] of god there is beautiful shadows and
[1:30:08] types
[1:30:09] but above all i just want to say how
[1:30:12] thankful i am he sent me a voice
[1:30:15] the grace of god where would i be where
[1:30:17] would you be if he did not send us a
[1:30:19] voice
[1:30:21] and how foolish how foolish we would be
[1:30:24] not to yield to that voice
[1:30:26] to recognize it for what it is and to
[1:30:28] forsake our own ideas and our own
[1:30:29] opinions
[1:30:31] how foolish we would be the scripture
[1:30:33] says that how foolish you would be to
[1:30:35] cast to cast eternal life away
[1:30:40] how foolish we would be
[1:30:42] that god would love us enough
[1:30:44] number one just even let us recognize
[1:30:46] who that voice was
[1:30:48] and then give us the capability to hear
[1:30:50] that voice
[1:30:52] and give us a capability to repent as
[1:30:54] david would repent
[1:30:57] and line up to that voice
[1:30:59] how thankful we should be that we have
[1:31:01] that capability don't take it lightly
[1:31:03] and don't let satan try to tell you the
[1:31:05] holy spirit in receiving the new birth
[1:31:07] and the gift of the whole the baptism of
[1:31:09] the holy ghost is something other than
[1:31:10] that
[1:31:11] that is it
[1:31:13] that is the wholeness of it the ability
[1:31:18] to receive
[1:31:19] the word for your age the ability to
[1:31:22] hear that voice let's pray together
[1:31:24] before i keep preaching
[1:31:27] precious lord jesus lord there's plenty
[1:31:30] more to say here lord
[1:31:31] i don't feel that i've got very far but
[1:31:33] i just i feel that it's far enough for
[1:31:35] today lord
[1:31:38] lord we just want to bow here
[1:31:40] humbly
[1:31:42] lord and as i said there's a lot to
[1:31:44] preach there's a lot to say there's a
[1:31:46] lot to bring out but lord we just want
[1:31:48] to close this service in thanksgiving
[1:31:50] father
[1:31:52] lord that you would look down upon us a
[1:31:55] hybrid sinful hell-bound race of people
[1:31:59] lord and you would say
[1:32:02] i'm not going to let that one go that
[1:32:04] way
[1:32:05] i'm not going to let the end that one go
[1:32:08] to that end of destruction
[1:32:10] lord but you would look down and say i'm
[1:32:13] going to place something within that one
[1:32:16] because i know he'll respond to it that
[1:32:19] she'll respond to it
[1:32:21] lord and and you would place that within
[1:32:24] us before the foundation of the world
[1:32:26] and then in your
[1:32:27] amazing intelligence and sovereignty and
[1:32:30] simplicity
[1:32:32] lord you would just send us a voice
[1:32:35] that would bring that seed to life
[1:32:38] lord
[1:32:40] knowing
[1:32:42] that your seed would quicken to the word
[1:32:46] father we cannot be thankful enough
[1:32:49] father
[1:32:50] lord we cannot we do not have words
[1:32:53] and vocabulary to express our gratitude
[1:32:56] but we would just pray that you would
[1:32:58] look down on each and everyone's heart
[1:32:59] here this morning
[1:33:01] lord and and just see how grateful and
[1:33:04] thankful and how we praise your holy
[1:33:06] name
[1:33:07] for the voice that you have sent us
[1:33:09] father that we do not have to wonder in
[1:33:11] chaos and and confusion as the rest of
[1:33:14] the world is doing nowadays
[1:33:17] as
[1:33:18] as satan would finish setting up his
[1:33:21] edom on this earth and destruction and
[1:33:24] sin is rampant
[1:33:26] and confusion is rampant
[1:33:29] but we can stand a solid
[1:33:32] stable
[1:33:34] right-minded people
[1:33:37] because you sent us a voice
[1:33:40] to write our minds lord
[1:33:43] to bring us a proper understanding
[1:33:45] lord we are so grateful for that and we
[1:33:47] worship your name for that lord and we
[1:33:50] would just pray
[1:33:52] that
[1:33:53] as we have recognized that for what it
[1:33:55] is
[1:33:57] that you would come
[1:34:00] in your sovereign ability
[1:34:02] and allow us
[1:34:04] to die out to ourselves lord
[1:34:07] reveal to us those things that we
[1:34:10] have have need to yield to you
[1:34:12] and to line up to your word father
[1:34:15] for if you don't come and reveal them to
[1:34:17] us lord we just won't know
[1:34:19] lord warren we're incapable
[1:34:22] we're fragile human beings we're
[1:34:24] confused already lord
[1:34:27] if you don't come in your grace and your
[1:34:29] mercy and reveal to us
[1:34:31] what we need to change lord we have no
[1:34:34] ability to
[1:34:35] but we think we're thankful lord that
[1:34:38] that's your desire as it is our desire
[1:34:40] for you said you would have a bride
[1:34:42] without spot or wrinkle
[1:34:44] and that is our desire lord to be
[1:34:45] without spot or wrinkle

[1:34:49] lord for what you have placed within us
[1:34:51] lord and what you have brought to us
[1:34:54] and we would just ask as we would depart
[1:34:57] that we
[1:34:59] would relax
[1:35:00] and allow that to mean what it really
[1:35:03] means lord that we would take stability
[1:35:05] in that and that we would allow the
[1:35:07] comforter to be the comforter
[1:35:09] and that we would not be tossed about
[1:35:11] but we would allow your word to stand as

[1:35:16] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
