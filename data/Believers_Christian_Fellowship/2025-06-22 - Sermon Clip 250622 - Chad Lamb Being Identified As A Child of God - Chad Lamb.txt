TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You never believed because you wanted to believe. You couldn't help but believe this message. You believed this message when it was inconvenient. You believed this message when your heart was broken. When you were rejected, when you were dejected, when you were cast out, when all your friends turned against you, you couldn't help but believe. Peter gets to a place, amen, where everything is falling apart. Everything was going so good in the ministry of Jesus Christ. The crowds were big. The people were healed. Jesus was putting the Pharisees uh to rest. I mean, they they couldn't answer him. They finally got to the point where they ask him, "No more questions." Yeah. Can you imagine Peter? Peter with his chest stuck out. I'm with him. Right. I'm the campaign manager on this campaign. Yeah. And all of a sudden, everything started falling apart. People started leaving. Jesus started saying things and and and the more people left, the more odd things Jesus said. Can you imagine Peter? This is how this is the way brother Brandon describes it to us. Peter says, "Listen now, you can't say it like that. You can't say that. People aren't understanding. They're leaving." Right? And Jesus says, "Well, if you stumble at that, what about this?" Because it was never about intellect. It was never about conduct. It was never about will. It was never about understanding. It was always been about faith from the beginning to the end. It's about faith. And faith is not something that you conjured up. You worked up, you manipulate, you have faith is a gift from God. It is embedded into that seed gene of God that was placed in you before the foundation of the world was placed in your soul and come to life after the hearing of the word. Amen. That is involuntary. You didn't decide to get it. God decided before the foundation of the world. Amen. And and now the only thing that you can do is just surrender to it and yield to it and give over to it. Amen. Amen. It got so bad. Amen. That Jesus finally turned to the 12 because everybody else was gone and say, "Will you go also?" And that's where Peter says, "To whom shall we go?" Where am I going to go? Thou believe that thou alone have the words of eternal life. Amen. There was something in him. He didn't comprehend. He didn't understand. And he didn't like what was happening. Listen, friends. We don't have to understand what's going on. We don't have to like what's going on in our lives. We don't have to enjoy the trials, the tribulations, the things that are going on. They don't have to be fun. They don't have to be enjoyable. They don't even have to be understandable. But there's one thing that'll hold when nothing else will hold. And that's that involuntary faith to believe the word of God. That's why when you're feeling low, when you're feeling down, when you're discouraged, the worst thing you can do is stay home and miss a service. The very worst thing you could ever do if you got trouble in your mind and trouble in your life and trouble in your home, the worst thing you can do is bail out. Because what you need is a good dose of the word to bring that faith that's in your soul back up to overcome the problems in the mind, to overcome the problems that are all around you. Because you're not going to overcome by taking a mental break and get mentally sorted out. You're never going to get mentally sorted out. And the more you stay away from fellowship and stay away from the word, the worse you're going to get mentally. What you need to do is get right back into the thing that attracted you in the beginning. Right back to the thing that gave you life. Right back to the thing that birthed you. And that's this message of the hour that called you out and connected you back to your father and gave you a positive identity of who you really are. Everything else is a lie. Amen. And that's the thing that identifies who you are.
