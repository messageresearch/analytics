TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but the opening of The Seven Seals in Revelations 10 in the full word being born into a manifestation again and it was Vindicated by the spirit of God in its full strength here upon the Earth manifested here in the same way it's doing the same things here on Earth you see it it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you see it that's my question have you seen it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever fully manifested manifested is to be made flesh God veiled in human flesh again Discerning the thoughts and the intents of your own heart I had a conversation with a brother a while ago about a month ago when brother Jean Kadima and I told him in my heart it's burning I says it's like I just Abba Father Abba Father I want to preach on it and then we got to talk and we talked for an hour almost an entire hour and just sharing what what was stirring in my heart brother John Kadima comes up that night and his opening scripture is Galatians 4 and Abba Father and he preaches everything we talk about that morning who is this in our midst is what is going on do you notice it's not a public show do you notice how calm and quiet these things are do you notice there's not a lot of screaming and shouting in the public running in to see something but it's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Discerning and identifying what you're talking about in your home what you have a cup of coffee with a brother over here on this side who is this in our midst but see it's just as calm and settled as can be will the bride have a great ministry yes but it'll be so humble it'll be so humble people won't even realize it it won't be screaming and shouting in the public coming from all places to see a skeptical or spectacle nope you know after the resurrection when Jesus came back on the scene he went to people privately if what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is where God himself is individually coming to you meeting you when you're discouraged out like Peter fishing by the seashore he comes to you in your place of discouragement and begins to talk to you and you read this in the Bible and then the brother says this to you when you call him and then the minister preaches on the same thing that you have need of that day who is this is this the Mighty God unveil it is the Mighty God unveil he's here he's doing the same things that he did then doesn't that declare him to be the same yesterday today and forever he is he's here but see how quiet and personal and private it is now it's in silence not a lot of screaming shouting and Gathering everybody in no he's meeting you quietly in the secret of your own prayer life of your own devotion and walk with him he comes to you here he comes to you here it comes to you here so shocking now but see so humble
