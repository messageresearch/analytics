[0:00] you know the coming of the Lord when
[0:02] Jesus Christ came to Earth it was so
[0:03] simple it was a baby a man who was
[0:06] birthed from a mother and and a stable
[0:09] laying there and in a manger and poor
[0:12] Shepherds poor literate Shepherds amen
[0:14] were told by angels that it was there
[0:15] and they're the ones running through the
[0:17] town poor illiterate Shepherds
[0:20] not priests not not not not not
[0:22] individuals who were respected not those
[0:24] who had a good reputation or those that
[0:26] would be trustworthy or people would
[0:28] listen to
[0:29] but poor literate Shepherds were running
[0:31] through Bethlehem and saying guess what
[0:33] happened Angels talked to us and told us
[0:35] that Messiah is in that stable over
[0:38] there go past the cow move around the
[0:40] sheep look beyond the donkey and down in
[0:43] there that's the Messiah that's Christ
[0:45] the lord
[0:47] that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah's
[0:49] prophecy it's all right there and it's
[0:51] so simple it's so it's it's an actual
[0:54] baby laying down wrapped in swaddling
[0:57] cloth the the the cloth off a yoke of
[1:00] oxen and laying there in a teenage
[1:02] mother holding it and you look at that
[1:04] and say that can't be what Isaiah was
[1:06] talking about but that's exactly what
[1:08] Isaiah was talking about
[1:10] and in this day you'd be like no no no
[1:12] amen that that that man from Kentucky
[1:14] with a seventh grade education amen
[1:17] every day meeting an angel in a room
[1:19] amen that's giving him the revelation of
[1:21] the Seven Seals that can't indicate the
[1:23] coming of the Lord but it is the
[1:25] indication of the coming of the lord
[1:27] it's the very thing that shows he's here
[1:29] that he's come that the mighty Angel has
[1:31] come down to take dominion over the
[1:34] Beast of the sea and over the Beast of
[1:36] the land and he's taking dominion over
[1:38] everything

[1:43] was there in that Prophet that day amen
[1:45] he was there giving out the revelation
[1:47] of the Seven Seals it wasn't he it was a
[1:50] son of man revealing the son of man it
[1:52] was Christ Jesus he had already broken
[1:54] the seals and was opening the seals it
[1:57] wasn't that man it was Christ in the man
[1:59] and it was so simple you said that can't
[2:01] be the coming of the Lord but it is the
[2:03] coming of the Lord
[2:08] and who does he get the talent
[2:09] illiterate
[2:12] unrespected unknown uneducated they're
[2:16] the ones who believe the message of the
[2:18] angel

[2:22] place what it was prophesied what was
[2:25] talked about what they've looked for for
[2:27] thousands of years was in that stable
