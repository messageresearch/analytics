[0:00] church, it's it's very simple. Why would
[0:03] we WHY WOULD WE TRY TO DO THE MAGIC?
[0:09] &gt;&gt; When it's so simple.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID WHAT DID MARY DO MAGIC?
[0:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; TO THAT THE LIFE THAT she became
[0:18] actually the life house of God.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID SHE SHE JUST said amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; TO THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL.
[0:28] AND SHE REMEMBER DON'T FORGET HOW THAT
[0:31] message started.
[0:34] THE ANGEL CAME DOWN AND BEFORE HE TOLD
[0:36] her
[0:38] &gt;&gt; the message, he said, "Mary, I WANT YOU
[0:40] TO understand what is happening to you
[0:43] now. It's God's grace."
[0:47] &gt;&gt; DID THE ANGEL NOT SAY
[0:49] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU ARE HIGHLY FAVORED AMONGST
[0:53] &gt;&gt; HIGHLY FAVORED MEANS YOU FOUND GRACE.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY AGAIN, NOT MERCY BUT
[0:58] GRACE.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GRACE GOES BACK TO
[1:01] PREDESTINATION.
[1:03] WHEN GOD SAVED YOU, I'M SAVED BY GRACE,
[1:06] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY FOR ME.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE LOVED ME. Is that
[1:12] right?
[1:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE FOR
[1:16] ME.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me say that again. Amen.
[1:23] [clears throat]
[1:24] &gt;&gt; And I trust we can understand that
[1:26] proper because I think sometimes it's so
[1:28] important that that we that we really
[1:31] understand what happened in our day.
[1:32] That's why brother Adam called it it's
[1:34] the message of grace.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; He never said it's a message of mercy.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; It's a message of God's grace.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? BECAUSE REMEMBER IN
[1:47] THE GARDEN OF EDEN when the lamb was
[1:49] shed, it was shed for Adam and God was
[1:52] clothing him with that lamb skinin.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY THAT ADAM WAS
[1:58] ON HIS WAY to hell.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HELL IS NOT CREATED FOR ADAM AND
[2:02] HIS RACE.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; HELL IS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS
[2:09] ANGELS.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO WHEN GOD SAVED
[2:13] YOU AND YOU CAN SAY I'M SAVED BY GRACE
[2:15] THEN YOU ARE NOT THAT'S WHY WHEN GOD IS
[2:18] NOT FEELING PITY for us
[2:20] &gt;&gt; we should not feel pity for ourselves
[2:26] &gt;&gt; AND SARAH FELT PITY FOR HERSELF POOR ME
[2:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[2:31] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT POOR ME SHE
[2:33] DEVELOPED a negative attitude right
[2:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:39] &gt;&gt; amen church it will be very simple to be
[2:41] changed
[2:42] It will be as the prophet would say I
[2:44] believe it will be just a daily routine.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[2:48] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M NOT WAITING
[2:50] FOR THE CHANGE. I am the change. THE
[2:53] RAPTURE IS NOT COMING TO ME. I'M A PART
[2:55] OF IT.
