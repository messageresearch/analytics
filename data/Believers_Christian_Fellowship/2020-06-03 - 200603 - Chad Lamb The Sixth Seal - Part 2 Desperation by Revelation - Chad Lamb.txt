you father for the privilege lord to say we love you to be able to gather together and lift our hands and praise your name we're so thankful lord that we can do that we're so thankful you've called us lord in this hour when there's darkness gross darkness you've shined a light in our hearts and awakened the seed lord to spring to life and everything in us wants to sing your praises and tell of your glory god we pray you'll be glorified that you'd be high and lifted up in this place today may your word take preeminence in our lives lord may you take preeminence in this place god i pray that you'd use this vessel for your glory and that you would touch each one of us as we surrender ourselves to you i pray you would take full control have your liberty lord among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you while we're standing let's turn to revelation chapter one i just want to make a couple of announcements here uh jack and emily sanders will have their open house reception on june 13th but if you could please sign up by this sunday they need everybody to sign up by this sunday signups are on the bulletin board also pray for brother ben siebel he's going to be going up to michigan and preaching for brother dan ratliff this sunday so he'll be away this sunday in michigan preaching so i'm sure he'll appreciate your prayers and i just got word that just shortly ago brother ron and sister becky garvin had their baby girl so praise the lord that she was induced this morning earlier today at least and they have a healthy baby girl we don't know any details so you have to come back sunday for more details the problem is you guys all have social media so you'll probably find out before sunday but i'll announce it again on sunday amen but we're happy for them and keep them in prayer amen let's look at revelation chapter 1 verse 1 again the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god under the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand man that's wonderful isn't it the time is at hand blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and jesus says you cannot hear my words so it's more than just hearing amen it's hearing with understanding amen you can be seated i'm going to continue on some things that i didn't finish in the sixth seal so this will be part two of the sixth seal but it's just a little bit different from me god i was up here praying at the altar just a little bit ago about six o'clock and all of a sudden god shuffled everything for me and so i was in the back jotting down notes feverishly so i don't have i may not have all my quotes together i don't even have my act together but praise god we want god to have god has his act together that's for sure so just pull and just bear with me as i stumble around and try to share what god has laid on my heart to share i'm going to do just a little review and go through a couple quotes from last time and then move forward brother branham says in the sixth seal said for we know that the six seals is the the sixth seal is the judgment seal it's the judgment seal exactly what it is now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word amen so we can find this sixth seal it's the six seals the judgment seal of the word word so we can find it all through the word amen god is bringing judgment under this sixth seal all through the word he says in handwriting on the wall but but now while we're speaking on this it came on my heart that this would be a very unusual but a timely message for the people now any bible reader here knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some most all of it has a duel a time there or two times or more that it will be answered as a revolving history we've read that many times but it's important to know because if we can catch that concept we don't get stumbled up amen when we when you see it's fulfilled here and it's fulfilled there and it's fulfilled here and this applies and this applies and this applies and this is what stumbled theologians for years and they've divided into separate camps and depending on which university you went to to get your doctorate degree is the way you would interpret certain prophecies being fulfilled and would not allow for any other fulfillment and then we'd miss much of the word amen because it's not intellectually uh received it's received by revelation amen and god gives the revelation on the word and the revelation i would say this way the revelation oh i'm going to say something that might get me in trouble but you understand me the revelation is fluid not rigid [Applause] revelation in the word is fluid not rigid and i don't mean that in that you can misinterpret the word what i mean is a man would want man wants safety and security and he wants to use the word to build a wall to hide behind to be safe and secure but that's not why god sent his word god did not send his word and i know the word is a wall i'm not i'm not i'm not changing any of that i'm talking about what man does with the word and what man wants man wants a word where he can say one plus one equals two every time 1 plus 1 is 2 and this and this but god absolutely will break our understanding and he'll use the word in different ways and in different times and man wants it to be simple and logical amen and predictable so that he can feel comfortable and an intellectual understanding of the words but that's not what god gave of the word for god gave his word to reveal himself to us and the revelation of him is a strong tower because the lord is a strong tower that the righteous into that's the wall that we hide behind not an intellectual understanding because somebody said this scripture means that it always means that stamped sealed approved amen but this scripture can mean this and it could mean something else in another application and something else in another application amen and if we depend on intellectual understanding we get nervous with the way that the flex the flexibility and the and and the fluidness of the scripture make us nervous but with revelation once you see the seventh seal it doesn't matter anymore once you see the seventh seal your security is not an intellectual understanding of the word your security isn't knowing the word himself because that's the seventh seal that's the one you've met and now you can see him in this verse and in this verse and in this verse and now i see the seventh seal in other places than revelations 8 1 because if you go looking for him in revelations 8 1 you won't find anything because revelations 8 1 where he's supposed to be he's hiding behind the silence do you understand what i'm saying i hope you understand what i'm saying we we what man has done to the word amen we human beings try to do to the message try to to we try to hem it in we try to trim the edges we try to make it predictable amen so that we can use these scriptures as building blocks you know and we can build predictably our own walls and our own our own doctrines and our own understandings and all we're trying to do is create a security and it's a false sense of security this is the reason there's such doctrinal debates because the doctrinal debates come from insecurity because i you know if i've created my doctrine to make me feel secure like i'm bride and i'm safe and everything's fine with me because of my understanding on these few points or whatever it is then if you challenge that i must destroy your challenge because this is my security does that make sense now do you understand why there's so much fighting because now i have to absolutely destroy your viewpoint because my security is coming from my doctrinal understanding and my security did not come from contact with the seventh seal himself because if i've made contact with the seventh seal himself even if my understanding of the scripture is wrong he'll correct my understanding of the scripture because i'm united with him the seventh seal which is the mystery of the whole book he'll right every wrong he'll fix every wrong so there's no reason to argue and fight amen if somebody sees it differently that's okay i mean that's fine because i don't need you to see like i see to make me feel good about the way i see because i've been into the little room and i've seen him and i've met the seventh seal and everything is fine it's all okay well what does this scripture mean i don't know what a brother a man in being by that i don't know but i am united with a husband who knows it all he is the word and he will reveal to me the word that i need as i need it praise be to god so this whole idea of the flexibility of the word i don't mean that to take the word loosely and do whatever we want with it but i mean to take it and let god do whatever he wants to do with it because there's so many times that you find people who are trying to correct the prophet of god in his misuse of the scriptures and the prophet of god didn't misuse the scriptures he just didn't use it according to an intellectual understanding he caught a revelation and that revelation allowed him to see the mystery in every type and in every character and all through the bible and because of that oh we're getting into good stuff friends because he saw the mystery in the whole bible and he could identify the mystery amen in noah the mystery and abraham and sarah the mystery here in the mystery there he no longer needed to quote the bible verbatim to preach because now he can quote it i mean i i don't want to say cruel wrong but he can rephrase the words in the bible and say it according to the application that he's applying this scripture to and he's absolutely correct but if we get the old denominational rule around we'll be like that's not exactly what he said what exactly he said was this word in this word in that word the prophet knows what he's talking about he knows the way he's using the scripture amen so we've got to allow for god to do what he wants with his own word and if he wants to take these two scriptures that don't have anything to do with one another and put them together and say they go together then praise god they go together how i don't know but they go together you see we've got to allow the word to lead us instead of us leading the word and we've got to allow for the word we have to allow the word to paint the picture that god once painted and used the scriptures that he wants to paint the picture even if he wanted to paint the picture differently before with the same scriptures you understand because he's gone it's his word and his objective in his word was to reveal himself to his bride to his people and that's the goal that's the purpose amen now brother graham goes on to say in this day the scripture is fulfilled from 65. he said in history has many times repeats itself history does and so does the promises of the bible for instance like matthew 3 where he said out of egypt i've called my son now if you run the reference on that it was jacob his son he called out of egypt that was his lesser son but his great son jesus was called out of egypt too so it had a compound answer it goes down that same same uh same message further down he says in history always repeats itself probably said always history always repeats itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation so praise be to god we love that so now we were looking at the scripture last time in matthew 24 when brother branham goes through the six seals and he goes down through the five the five seals and then then he skips over to to verse 29 in matthew 24 and talks about after the tribulation of those days and points back to the holocaust and the tribulation the jews went through and shows the sequence of events but the other places goes back and he picks up the the application of the sixth seal in between amen to the jews that were judged in a.d 70 when titus came in and and sieged laid siege to jerusalem and totally destroyed him and and the reason i want to look at that for just a minute as i want to remind you of something that we read and then i want to move on from there it says now in questions and answers from 1964 he says and according to the history there wasn't one of them that believed in jesus and believed the word but what was watching for that to happen titus coming in you know they may not have known it was titus but they knew something was coming he may not have had the name and they may not have had the date but by god's mercy and grace he sent his elect a prophet and that prophet gave him the word and when they saw the word coming to pass they knew to flee he said not one was caught and they escaped and went to jerusalem and to judea and fled for their lives not one of them because they were worn by their shepherd and was watching for that hour to come when they heard titus was coming they took off run for their lives and got out of the city and we looked at that because we typed it with the old church with the denominational system because titus was going to trap them behind the walls of their own church and that's exactly what's happening today through the ecumenical movement amen the rome the spirit of rome titus represented rome he was a roman general amen and then the the rome is trying to trap the world behind the walls of their own religion including the jews including the muslims including every other religion they're trying to pull them together and let you remain what you want to be and that was kind of a a benchmark that was something unusual in rome amen most uh if we could put it this way uh many times in in history when there was a dominating nation that nation would dominate another country and convert them to a new religion but rome was unusual and rome would let you still keep your religion that's just history and so that spirit has not died rome will not let you keep your religion but come under their rulership that's the same thing that vatican do is accomplishing letting you remain a presbyterian and a baptist and a pentecostal but coming under the headship amen and the pope will be the head of all even though they didn't intend for it to be that way rome's pulling the strings so much so that i i read an article uh several years ago this has come to my mind in indonesia the indonesian government which is predominantly muslim they're like 80 muslim the indonesian government was was doing a new census and they passed the law that everybody had to declare a religion they wanted they wanted everybody registered they wanted everybody to declare a religion on their senses and they've got some indians that live back in in the jungles and those indians back in the jungles i think at that time they didn't even have a written language and they didn't have a formal religion and there was only a few choices i don't remember the choices i don't remember all the circumstances but they had ancestry worship they worshiped their dead ancestors and they didn't have a formal religion didn't have a name for religion they were just they were just bush people but they the government was forcing them to pick a religion so when it came down to it they picked the catholic church because the catholic church let them keep their ancestor worship and in the article i read they interviewed the catholic priest that was in charge of this area and the catholic priest he didn't make no bones about it he didn't whitewash it he says no because we believe in in intercession of saints there is no conflict between the catholic church and their religion and we allowed them to maintain their worship of their ancestors and they became catholic praise god that spirit just shows itself now remember you're never fighting flesh and blood remember above if you could remember anything remember this and lock it in you are never fighting flesh and blood the moment it becomes a flesh and blood ordeal in your mind you're wrong you've missed the boat you're on the wrong path you better stop and repent and ask god to help but it's spirits that we're fighting and that spirit that that was coming in i mean through the roman system was allow them to have their own religion and then trap them during passover behind the walls of their own religion and then build another wall around their wall and when they build another role a bigger wall around their wall which is the world council the church is an ecumenical move another wall you can keep your wall you can come in for your feast days but once you're inside we're going to build another wall around your wall and when we build that wall we're going to starve you out there's no more spiritual food this is the spirit of rome now that spirit continues and is pervasive and is trying to work on you and me don't throw this off anywhere else that spirit is trying to work on you and me amen that that that you can have your religion that you can build your wall that you can come in behind your wall for safety and security you can keep doing things the way you want to do amen but but there's going to be an overarching authority that's going to be rome and eventually that thing's going to take full control and starve everything out but we've already been told amen just like when jesus christ was here he told the elect and the elect saw the signs and ran from that thing and we're not trapped in that and i say god you have already told us your mercy to your elect has already told us we got to run away from all formalism all traditionalism every sign of denominationalism we must have an individual walk by revelation and come into an individual contact with the seventh seal himself that's the only security that a believer has because we don't want any walls we want to be free we want to be completely free no walls now let's look at genesis chapter 6. i feel like i'm going off like a shotgun here a little bit but god help us let it all come together i pray i pray genesis chapter 6. now i want to look at something here genesis chapter 6 we're coming into another type of the sixth seal we're going to see that the earth is going to move into a sixth seal because the sixth seal is the destruction of the earth also in the destruction of the unbelievers and now we're coming to genesis chapter six it's the story of noah and let's just read here starting at verse one and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters and men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose oh praise god what's happening they're starting to mix they're starting to mix and god hated the mixing and god still hates the mixing verse 3 and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping and the creeping thing and the fouls of the air of it repenteth me that i have made them but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so here we are under the sixth seal and in the sixth seal there's going to be a remnant that finds grace under the sixth seal because that's what we see at the sixth seal under the sixth seal there's a remnant the bride is called amen between the sixth and second seventh trumpet the bride is called and the sixth trump and the sixth seal sound at the same time and you know 144 000 are called so now you see that noah found grace in the eyes of the lord let me let me keep reading these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god so let's let's go down to verse 11. the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth make thee an ark of gopher wood room shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch now i just want to take a look and look into this for just a minute now we know this destruction came uh when noah was in his 600th year so in the sixth chapter of genesis in the 600th year of noah we're going to see a type of the breaking fourth of the sixth seal but under the sixth seal which is a judgment seal and god is declaring judgment because man has is hybridizing man is mixing two lines together the the false vine and the true vine amen mixing it together and god hated that mixing but it says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and in it verse 9 it says noah was a just man and perfect in his generations now look at that word perfect in his generations that word perfect means whole or complete whole or complete in his generations which means his genealogy that means he was the true seed of god he wasn't mixed amen he was the true seed of god he was perfect in his generations and now you go back to the previous verse and said noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and i want to ask you what did noah do to find grace in the eyes of the lord nothing he was perfect in his generations he was a perfect seed that had come down through he was of the right lineage he was of the right seed now we're looking natural but i want you to look spiritually amen if you're of the right seed if you're of the right if you're perfect in your generations meaning you are a seed that came from the mind of god amen then you're perfect in your generations and you can find grace in the eyes of the lord that's what grace is grace is god's love expressed amen in his love was for his own for his own genes for his own attributes amen and now he noah found grace in his eyes because noah was of the perfect seed line noah was perfect in his generations so what conduct did noah have amen what what what good deed did noah do amen what did noah do if you look down here at verse 11. he says in verse 12 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth everything he saw was corrupt but noah found grace because he was the right seed what did you do to earn the grace that's been extended in you and i nothing but we are perfect in our generations we come from god we go to god what does that mean perfect in your generations and under the sixth seal those who are perfect in their generations will find grace in the eyes of the lord noah found grace in the eyes of the lord praise be unto god so god's grace was going to be extended to noah and the question is how is god's grace going to be extended to noah to escape damnation and judgment god is going to give him a revelation of the pending judgment and he's going to give him the word for his day oh praise god there's no other way to escape damnation and judgment there is no other way than to receive the word for your day [Applause] god because he was because he was perfect in his generation because he received grace amen because he was uh he received grace in the eyes of the lord he was now given a revelation of the word for his day and when that word was made manifest the word for his day was there's going to be rain and there's going to be a flood and you need to build an ark amen so the evidence that he believed that word was that he started building an ark see it doesn't do any good to say that we believe the word and we're not willing to nail boards to the ark amen it doesn't do any good say i believe the message i believe the message i believe the message but we're not spending any time building the ark we're not spending any time in the world we're not spending any time watching it come together because the christ is the ark of safety and christ is the word and he's the word made manifest in your day the word for your day is christ is the ark that we're supposed to get on amen but noah found grace in the eyes the lord was given the revelation that would save his life and that revelation had to move from a revelation in his heart into actions in his body and that word had to be made manifest and when that word was made manifest it was the manifestation of the revealed word to a son of god that brought deliverance and that same story repeats again and again and again what what brings deliverance the manifestation of the revealed word to a son of god brings deliverance [Music] to who to the one that finds grace in his eyes not because they did something special but because they believed his word abraham was justified not in his works but in his faith because he believed the word of god noah was a just man why because he believed the word of god praise god i want to read a bit of a lengthy quote and then i want to get into the real heart of what i want to say brother bam is preaching here in july of 1965 he's preaching a message called trying to do god a service without it being the will of god he said i wonder today if all of our drawing in and great crusades and revivals we haven't been filling up the methodist ark the baptist arc the presbyterian art but what about the ark of christ the word and if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day the word for this day oh my goodness i i could explode when i read something like that listen if she if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of christ that means you come from christ part of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word she's got to be the word the word not for his day you understand there was a word in jesus christ's day when he when he was here in flesh and that was the word for his day she's got to be part of the word but not that part of the word that part of the word was already expressed amen so she is part of the bridegroom she must be of christ part of the bridegroom she must be part of the word amen but not the word of his day now you see what's wrong with the nominationalism looking back to his day and trying to be part of the revelation of his day and they're missing it by a million miles amen because they got to be part of the word but the part of the word for his day has already been spoken it has already been manifest and now to be part of the word you have to be part of the word for your day and that's the bride listen this quote i'm telling you this quote is absolutely lit me on fire the word the word not for his day the word of this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his word forth to mold his bride and make her so what is the what is the objective of the word for this day to mold and make a bride so we are in the bride time or the bride age or the bride manifestation of the word a revelation amen that's got to go beyond just a revelation in the heart but it's got to become a manifestation all over us that there's a manifestation of the bride just like there was a manifestation of the boat amen there's got to be now a manifestation of the bride all right let's keep going he sent forth that he the that he promised would be in this day the word of this day that he promised would be in this day that he sent his word forth to mold his bride and maker hope we see it don't get some idea of your own now and don't take somebody else's idea take the vindicated word here the bible it says god has promised in his word how he will choose his bride in the last day oh we're getting into some good stuff he's he's talking about the choosing of the bride how will he choose his bride he's going to do it by the word and the question is has the word chose you or did you make a decision did you decide to go along with mom and dad did you decide to go along with husband and wife did you decide to go along with a pastor or a teacher or preacher or or or has the word called you out god has promised in his word now how he would choose his bride in the last day did you know that he promised it how he would do it and that by his original plan of choosing christ of choosing the times choosing the seasons he can't miss it on his bride because she is part of the word he can't choose it by a denomination when he didn't choose christ by the nomination did christ come to a denomination did he come by the nomination no they rejected him well that's what the denomination done then then when he chooses a bride can he come any other way he can't choose by denomination or by denominational teaching how did he bring christ here by the word of the prophets how did he bring christ here by the word of the prophets is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophets how did he identify him when he come by a man with the spirit of elijah upon him come out of the wilderness how will he identify his bride he promises in malachi 4 the same thing before he destroys the earth like it was in the days of sodom now i want to say hold on time out he's saying how did he identify christ in his first coming he said by a man with the spirit of elijah how will he identify his bride wait a minute i thought the voice on the river in 1933 said that your ministry will forerun the second coming of christ but he's saying now the spirit of elijah to identify christ is the spirit of elijah that's going to identify the bride of christ because when he identifies the bride of christ he's identifying christ because she's part of christ she's part of the word and she's the word to be on display in this day she is the word for this day just as much as jesus christ was the word for his day now jesus christ in the bride is the word for this day and there'll be a malachi 4 ministry with the spirit of elijah just like john the baptist to identify her praise be to god i i was looking for him to point out a man with nail scarred hands i was looking for it to be the exact same way that he didn't know it's the same thing it's always the same thing jesus christ was the word made flesh in his day he was the fullness of the word the completion of the old testament now standing on display and now his bride his wife part of him it's him it's him we've got to get away from the notion of making the bride anything other than him because if we make the bride something other than him then all of a sudden we're false in all of our beliefs and all of our doctrines and all of our teachings but if you make the bride part of the word that's been reserved for a manifestation in this day and it's not your skin it's not your flesh it's not your mom and dad's genetics but it's that very word which come from the mind of god amen that is birthed alive in your soul that is christ down in your soul that's to take dominion over this earth and begin to flesh out the word that's for this day and when that takes place that's christ and if christ when he come to the full measure at the end of the old testament had to be identified with a prophet with the spirit of elijah now when christ is going to come to full identification of his bride at the end of the new testament they're going to have to have a repeat of the same sequence and in the repeat of the same sequence there's going to be a prophet here with the spirit of elijah under the ministry of malachi 4 to identify her [Applause] because she is him oh phrase be the god now you see why denominational understanding's got to crumble because we're talking about the word and the word when it whatever form the word comes in when that word comes in the manifestation that's christ brother said it was christ in jeremiah it was christ in noah it was christ and david it was christ and moses what was it it was christ moses would have ran away to the wilderness and never come back and been a redeemer moses would have failed a hundred times over but it wasn't moses it was christ in moses it's not you you'll fail a thousand times over and get everything as wrong as wrong can be but he didn't leave it up to you in your natural birth amen he left it up to himself through a new birth amen to quicken something he placed inside of you before the foundation of the world and ordained that it would be here and at a certain time he made contact with that to bring that to life so that that would begin to dominate you so that it wouldn't be a life you live but it'd be a life that he lives through you and then when he lives that life through you it would be christ on display and if it's going to be christ on display amen there's going to have to be elijah here to point him out the confusing part is when he pointed out christ he was pointing to a woman it's got everybody all confused well oh no no no that's that's female no jesus christ is male 1 that's female well we better wait for it's coming [Music] praise god going on in the same quote says remember sodom burn is that right well this world is to burn jesus said so and it'll be the time that that luke 17 chapter 30 verse in the days it'd be like the son of sodom and gomorrah when the son of man would be revealed and then what happened according to malachi he would burn the earth again and the righteous and the millennium will walk out on the ashes of the wicked is that right so we're right at the end time we're sitting here at the door now waiting for him to come notice god promised this his word that he would choose his bride by his original way he chose his the bridegroom he foretold it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it so he's going to bring the bride the same way he foretold it by a prophet he's going to send a prophet to identify it it's the same pattern praise god the prophet said standing in the banks of jordan behold they said you're the messiah aren't you he said no i'm not the messiah you must be the messiah he said but i'm not him but he is standing among you in his shoes i'm not worthy to loosen when he comes makes himself known and today he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same make himself known how will he make himself known when the bride and the groom become the same he makes himself known where in her praise god make himself known and one day you'll see that the one that you you'd feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one you've united by the word and the word was in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning which is god said you're united by the word how did i unite with christ by the word when i saw him the word then i could unite with him my husband the revealed word my mate my husband the revealed word i cannot unite with him until i can see him do you understand that i cannot unite with him until i can see him but he said we don't look for nail scars what do we look for the word made manifest and when i would see him as the revealed word made manifest that's my bridegroom that's my husband the revealed word and now i can embrace the revealed word and be united with him praise god you've united by the word and the word was in the beginning with we'll go back to the beginning which is god and that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you and me hallelujah we're here he didn't say it's coming but he gets to that scripture in that day you know that i and the father follow me i in you and you and me what does that make that makes the oneness of the godhead on display where where on earth is it on display in her i in you you and me i am the father the father and me if he's in the father the father's in him and he's in you and you're in him then you guys are all together like this united by the word he said now oh praise god he said now we're here hallelujah i'm so glad to see him personifying himself right among us and see what he's promised for the word not what somebody's emotions singing and jumping and dancing but by his word amen he is making himself known how is he making himself known not through a sensation but he's making himself known by the word praise god and when we see that word that was promised for today and he reveals to us himself to us as the word amen now we see that's him and now we can embrace him and be united with him and we become united by the word what word the revealed word not for his day but for our day we have to know the day we're living in let's turn to isaiah chapter 6 oh i pray that god will put these pieces together friends there is so much i want to say here in the next few minutes and i don't intend to go long i just intend to drop this in as god dropped it in my heart amen i heard a preacher say something recently and when i heard him say it it lit something in my heart it's a brother that i just became acquainted with and i thought oh man i'll get to that someday and that's really good and all of a sudden god just absolutely unlocked it and just drove something into my heart not exactly what the brother said but something that he said just lock unlock something for me and i want by the grace of god to share it with you and i pray that god will unlock something isaiah 6 and 1 isaiah 6 and 1 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple now isaiah brother man preaches it from this text many times in the message influence and in other places and he talks about isaiah isaiah was a true prophet of god he was a true seed of god he was an elective god but he was he was leaning on the arm of flesh he was dependent on uzziah a godly king to get him through and and and we could say it like this isaiah had a church walk isaiah was part of the right church he had there was a good leader amen in the kingdom and and isaiah was part uh of the of the right dispensation i should say that way so isaiah was comfortable and confident just following uzziah's lead but towards the end uzziah got off and he ended in disgrace and and god took him off the earth and in isaiah it threw isaiah into desperation and and this is absolutely perfect friends because the we're in isaiah 6 so what seal do you think we're going to talk about because when you get to the sixth seal the sixth seal can also throw us into desperation amen but in the time of desperation amen there's always something that happens to the elect seed and in the times of desperation the elect seed come in contact with a revelation of god if you look at jacob brother brethren when he preached the sixth seal he went to jacob in jacob's trouble leaving laban's house and we've talked about this recently and traveling over and he's in trouble now because he's going to have to face esau and he's cheated esau he's done wrong to esau and what's amazing to me is at this point in the journey jacob has the birthright and he has the blessing but having the birthright and having the blessing still will not bring security to his heart he's still afraid he's still nervous and it won't change his behavior the very thing that he did to get the birthright amen and to get the blessing is the very thing he did to his father-in-law laban to get all the cattle so he had the blessing he had the birthright but he hadn't had a change yet this is important so now the circumstances come full circle where jacob's in trouble and he knows that he deserves judgment he knows that he's wrong he knows his brother's mad he's assuming his brother is coming to kill him and all that he has and he knows that he deserves it that's the important part of this he knows he deserves it when god allows all of this to throw jacob into a state of desperation amen and the state of desperation is going to put him all by himself he puts his wives and children across the brook across the river he's all alone and when he's all alone he's finally in the place god wants him he's broken amen he's afraid i mean he's unsure he's uncertain and he's all by himself amen praise be to god if we can be broken and walk into that little room amen that little wooden room under the tabernacle all broken and uncertain and not depending on any doctor not depending on any theologian and not depending on anything our parents told us but walk into that little room desperately in need of god to change the situation many of us would come out better but most of the time all we want to do is walk across the platform amen with a group of people and have the same thing everybody else gets but this was a one by one individual getting alone into the little room and coming in personal contact with the shekinah glory and then they came out the other end of the room and they were changed whatever they were before they were different afterwards without the ability to explain the reason for the change the new birth and now jacob's coming to the same place he's guilty he's wrong he deserves what he's got coming amen and in desperation he's all alone and in desperation when he's all by himself there's going to be the seventh seal come to him in a mysterious way at first he won't know what it is but he'll get a hold of it he knows it's something special amen because when we come in contact with it we may not have been able to properly identify it early on but we knew it was something special and we got a hold of it and wouldn't let it go and he gets a hold of this man and won't let him go and he wrestles with the man amen through the night and the man's got to leave he says let me go he said i won't let you go until you bless me jacob had the birthright jacob had the blessing but he needed something more than blessings from god he needed something more than the birthright he needed a change in his walk amen he needed a touch from god that would change him forever and he walks out of this scenario halting on his leg and it changes his walk and he goes and he faces his brother the next day and god takes care of everything see desperation put him in a condition for a revelation and an encounter with the seventh seal jacob left in case we doubt whether that's the counter with the seventh seal when jacob left he said i have seen god face to face so now we go back to isaiah isaiah 6 isaiah is in the same situation his confidence is rattled what he knew to be true what he was depending on he saw fail he's now alone we understand this same pattern he's now alone he said in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is filled full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts what did he see he got a revelation of heaven and the holiness of god he got a revelation that caused him to realize that he was unclean see he was part of the church he was part of the system and he was depending on those that were over him amen to set the tone and he was leaning on the arm of flesh and comfortable in his denomination do we see it then his denomination fails amen he sees a failure he he gets alone and all of a sudden because he can find grace in the eyes of the lord what did isaiah do to bring this vision what did he do nothing he didn't have to do nothing because god had mapped out isaiah's life and knew right where he was and knew he was perfect in his generations knew he was an elective and knew when the conditions were right when the man is broken when he's lost confidence in his denomination now is time for me to reveal myself to him and when he caught the revelation from heaven and realized woe unto me i thought i was a christian i hope you've come to that already i hope you've come to the place raised in church always been in church i hope you've come to the place where you realize i thought i was a christian but until i really saw him i realized that i am nothing and those that i'm with are nothing woe unto me for i'm a man of unclean lips amen i'm not even speaking the word right i'm not even confessing the word right because i've never had the revelation of the seventh seal i've been saying what they say before but i'm not even saying the right word you can be quoting the message without the right revelation and not speaking the right thing amen what do we need what do we need we need a revelation of him the one sitting upon the throne a revelation of heaven and recognize his holiness his perfect word how perfect he is in the realms of heaven and we need to realize everything i thought i knew is rubbish and what i thought i was is nothing amen and woe is me for i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell amongst a people with unclean lips oh my goodness that's the best thing that could ever happen to us jacob got a hold of that one he met because jacob knew that the way he had lived his life wasn't going to work anymore he knew he had to have something more than what he's had before and when he came in contact with something he knew was greater than him which was the revealed word for his hour he got a hold of it and wouldn't let it go until it blessed him and changed him that's what we need not a casual contact with the message of the hour but we got to realize everything about me is wrong and everything about me has failed i don't care if i was raised this way i don't care if i believed it for 40 years but i got to have something that'll change the repeating history of my life failure upon failure upon failure upon failure i can't do it but by the grace of god if i'm perfect in his generations he knows when to open a heaven and give me a vision and show me the thing i've been missing all along i ask you this when isaiah got the vision of heaven was that when heaven appeared is that when heaven come in the and the realization is that when the seraphim started singing no it was happening all around him all the time but he was missing it because he was in his old thinking in his old denomination amen so god has to when he gets to desperation under the sixth seal amen and he's crying out he's needy amen god now opens a vision of what's been going on all around him the whole time it's not a new message we don't have a new message same message but there's those that are catching it and saying it's become a new book to me why because what was going on all around what's going on all around heavenly worship revelation amen a vision of god amen seraphim singing and shouting around the throne it's going on right here right now but we've got to have god open the vision of our eyes to see what's in our hands what's going on all around move from the carnal to the spiritual and god opens his eyes he says woe is me woe is me amen i'm a man of unclean lips i'm not i've not been speaking this thing right praise god let's read this again verse 5 then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of the people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts who did he see the seventh seal you know he had religion he had religion listen he was in the message you understand that he was in jerusalem he was a prophet he was where god was working he was in the right dispensation and he was the right person but he didn't yet have a heavenly vision so he's in religion doing religious things but he realizes in an instant how dirty his mouth is he realizes in an instant how pure this message really is because if we can say we believe the message and love the message and want to be part of the message and go to a message church and message his message message and then absolutely defile our speech and don't care about the revelation of the word and only go to church on sunday and on wednesday all we have is religion we haven't seen the king of glory coming yet because if we did we realize how precious how pure how holy how sacred this message is it's not something to leave on the desk it's not something to leave amen leave on your phone app that's never been touched it's not something that we talk about on sunday it's not something we give lip service to but it is something that's more than anything we've ever imagined before because this message is christ it is the king of glory it is the lord of lords it is holy and clean and pure and this message will sanctify all filth out of our lives if we'll let it because it's perfect and it's holy and it's pure sometimes we take it too lightly we just take what's all around us too lightly and we get caught up in the religion of the thing and miss what's really happening he says then flew one of the seraphims unto me oh praise god what did isaiah do to give himself a vision nothing what did isaiah do to clean himself up nothing isaiah was a seed of god and at the right time god would open heaven and reveal himself to isaiah and when isaiah caught the revelation of the king he said what was me woe is me amen i dwell amongst people of unclean lips i'm a man of unclean lips and then now and upon his confession and his desire amen god sends an angel to go get something from heaven and bring something from heaven a perfect burning fire from the altar of heaven and bring it down and touch him on his lips and purge him of his iniquity what purged him amen when that angel took something fresh hot alive a living coal off the altar of god and brought it down and touched him he was purged and i want to tell you there's been an angel in this day that has reached up before the throne of god and grabbed a hot burning purifying ember of the word amen and if you want him to if you can confess that i am undone and i am nothing amen he can bring that angel can grab that coal from fire from heaven amen and he can touch your lips with the pure word from the presence of god and purge that vessel what's gonna do it when i start a good works program when i finally quit that bad habit no first first first first he has to come to you and open your eyes to see him and until that happens nothing else is going to happen friend you can beg you can plead amen you can do whatever you want but unless unless god amen opens the windows of heaven and opens your eyes and lets you see that this is me and it's bigger than what you thought and when you can catch that and realize my religion is worthless my righteousness is filthy rags all of my service and duty has amounted to nothing then he's ready to take that prophet that angel amen and bring that fire down from heaven and touch you and purge you from iniquity that's what this message does amen it was the vision amen of heaven that opened up isaiah amen to his true need and it was the vision from heaven that purified him in his need praise be to god you see why revelation is so critical you see this is this message is not religion this religion is about coming in contact with the living god that's what this message is it's coming it's seeing heaven open and coming in contact with the living god and that contact amen will purge you and it will change you when jacob came in contact with that vision of the seventh seal it changed him amen when he recognized his need he could have made a casual contact he said hey how are you you look pretty nice to me and let him walk on by but he recognized this was the thing i needed to change my life and isaiah was the same way oh praise god let's keep reading for just a moment then flew one of the seraphims into me having a live coal live coal live coal live call living word not a dead cold not an old coal not a coal from a previous dispensation or a previous fire a live coal from the altar of god not from a textbook not from a church system off the altar of god having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged what good deed did he have to do to have his sin purged nothing all he had to do was see god recognize his need and call out and despair and god would make sure the word got to him amen if he would just hold still and let the angel do the work the word the live coal off the altar would purge him of his iniquity and purify his iniquity and purge him of his sin praise be to god and i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me that's the process friends now when isaiah saw heaven open and he saw the lord he recognized there was a need that he couldn't meet but when he recognized there was a need he couldn't meet then god made sure there was an angel there and a living colon everything he needed to put him in the condition where god could use him and after isaiah caught the revelation of heaven and after he went through this experience all alone by himself making contact with god and being purged by the living coal after that he said who will go forth he said here am i send me and after that brother bam said isaiah gets the revelation of the seven seal book what do you mean brother chad brother bear said he got the revelation of the entire bible because he wrote 66 chapters in in isaiah and there's 66 books in the bible he said isaiah wrote the whole bible [Music] what happens when you come in contact with a living god and you're purged from a living cold off the altar you can see the whole bible your bible becomes a new book the seals tear open the bible and now you see the bible that's what isaiah that's the revelation isaiah isaiah got the revelation of the whole bible after this experience that's why he wrote 66 books and then we find out in the next chapter chapter seven he gets another revelation of the seventh seal revelation 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son shall call his name emmanuel what is that he caught the revelation that god is going to come through the virgin he caught the revelation that the virgin will bring forth christ guess what that's still the revelation that's ongoing today that the virgin amen this virgin bride will do all that's written of her in the bible concerning the virgin same prophecy isaiah caught the revelation of it and the revelation is continuing to this day let's turn over to revelation chapter 4. oh praise be to god revelation chapter 4 verse 1 after this i looked after what after the church ages oh don't you love the word of god when did isaiah get a vision of the throne in heaven after uzziah died after the church system in his life died after his church ages he saw the throne in heaven john is coming he's going to see the same vision and he's coming to the same experience the same way why because prophecy repeats and history repeats it's got compound meaning and compound revelation what isaiah saw and went through is what john's going to go through he said after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately it was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in the sight likened to an emerald and around about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats i saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raymond they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god so now we see that john now gets a fission there's a door open in heaven he's called up in the spirit now he sees now he sees one sitting on the throne he sees the throne room of god he sees all of this going on what isaiah saw he now sees when did isaiah see it after uzziah died when did john see it after the church ages do you see the pattern i'll tell you even if we were born in this message the church ages have to cease so we can see this vision in heaven because we can't take it with carnal understanding it's only going to come by spiritual revelation so now let's go to chapter 5 verse 1. and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side and sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon what are we what do we have taking place here we have a court case which is a type of judgment john is going through a type of the sixth seal and after the church ages he's cut up into heaven and he sees what's going on here and now he sees the book the title deed of all redemption the book written on the front side on the inside sealed with seven seals and he sees this book and a strong angel proclaims who's worthy to take the book said no man in heaven on earth or under the earth was found worthy and i wept amen why was john weeping amen because john himself wasn't worthy [Music] now just if you could just listen to me for a minute and take what i'm saying by default john was judged because he knew this was the book of all redemption if nobody claimed that book all is lost all of earth he himself is lost and so now because he is not worthy to take the book he's lost he he's in a desperate condition he's in a needy condition he needs somebody who can take this book because no man in heaven no man on earth no man under the earth he himself couldn't take the book but if nobody took the book all is lost and now john is in desperation under the sixth seal but praise god john has come from the mind of god and his name is on that book and so there's got to be one amen who can take the book and john is now in a desperate condition he's just like isaiah woe is me for i'm a man of unclean lips i'm not able to take the book neither anybody that i've ever known or any patriarch that i've ever loved or anybody i've ever read about in the old testament is worthy to take that book now he's realized religion won't work oh praise god friends it's the same story over and over and over again now he's in this desperate condition i can't do it i can't save myself if he doesn't do something for me i'm finished oh do you see how the vision in heaven always puts us in the same spot i see how perfect i see oh holy i see how pure i see how wonderful and i see me and there's nothing i can do about it i can't bridge this gap jacob couldn't do it isaiah couldn't do it now john can't do it and neither can you and i do it so he says in verse 5 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood on lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he does worship breaks out in heaven then we come down to verse 13 in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne what happened john realized i've been saved i've been saved i've been saved not by my conduct not by my deeds not by my church not by the patriarchs i've not been saved by any man or any system or any teaching i've been saved by the seventh seal himself when he comes and takes the book i'm free and if you've seen him come and take the book amen my question is if you have seen him come and take the book then you should be able to move from weeping for all his loss to rejoicing for all has been found and everything is fine there is no problem friends there's nothing going out of kilter there's nothing wrong why because after you left the church ages after you came out of laodicea there was a window a door open in heaven and you saw the mighty god unveiled and when you saw the mighty god unveiled you realize woe is me i'm not able to save myself i am nothing i am rotten my flesh is rotten amen but if you caught the vision amen of the seventh seal of the lamb taking the book and tearing open the seals and revealing the seals then all of a sudden you should be able to move like john moved from weeping and grumbling and complaining and saying i'm not worthy i'm not able see the problem is we've got believers who are still stuck pre-seals we have believers in the mess we have believers stuck pre-seals i'm not worthy i'm not able i can't overcome i say lord give him a vision of the lamb taking the book give me a vision of the lamb taking the book and let it settle in my heart forever that everything's redeemed everything's fine everything's okay nothing now is lost i'm gonna make it there's no questions and nothing about me is in jeopardy anymore because i saw the lamb take the book and loose the seals thereof amen we shouldn't be amen pre-seals in our condition all the time saying woe is me i'm undone woe is me nothing's good low is me look at all the problems there is no problem the lamb took the book and loosed the seals and then he sent it down to the seventh church age messenger who gave it to me and i have now eaten the book and become one with christ in the little room and i'm united with the word there's no more problems friends everything is wonderful everything is great oh i still cry and we still get sick we still have those problems but i'm talking about a condition of the soul that can rejoice in the midst of trouble knowing that the lamb has taken the book redemption is finalized and i'm here in the wrap up moments of everything going back to the way it should be and i'm part of that plan why would i weep anymore because the lamb's taking the book amen it was in jeopardy listen it was in jeopardy through seven church ages will it be finished will it be complete we'll all come in but when the lamb takes the book there's no more questions anymore everything's finished how do i get there brother chad leave laodicea fly a little higher if he can open a window in heaven and you can see there's more than what i've had there's more than what i believe there's more than the way i've lived and he can open a vision of the mighty god unveiled amen all you got to do is get up into that higher realm and say oh god i'm lost and i'm undone and i'm unable won't you come and save me if he can show you the lamb taking the book and loosing the seven seals thereof and you can hear the rejoicing in heaven over the lamb taking the book then you should be able to say all that is in heaven all that is in the earth all that is on earth heard me shouting and screaming and praising god for my destiny is secure everything is fine and i ask you friends if you saw the lamb take the book and open the book and you know you're of the book what are you part of the words written on the book if you know that you and your redemptions wrapped up in that act and you know the completion of redemption is wrapped up in the lamb taking the book then my goodness we should be happy people friends we should be rejoicing and looking all the time for god to do wonderful things amen because he's got the book of redemption and he's given it to us we know the story and it doesn't matter if i suffer every day of my life from now on because i saw him loose the seals i know amen i know what it's like if i go beyond the veil of this life i know the green grass and the white robes and the saints that are there to greet me and hug me i know it's perfect love i know it's beyond description i know it because i saw the seals open i know the deliverance that's in store for the bride i know the overcoming that the bride will have in this last day i know why because i saw the seals open and if i suffer every day of my life nothing's going to change those things being true for me and if i suffer the next 20 years or 30 years or 40 years i'm still going to be in the millennium ruling and reigning with christ for a thousand years and it will still be far beyond anything i've ever imagined in this life so everything is fine with me if i don't get my prayer request amen if i don't get what i want it doesn't matter he's already given me everything i could want plus more why would i want something lousy in this life when he's given me everything else in the next sometimes what we've got to do is remember the vision that he's given us of heaven that we've seen the mighty god unveil and we were desperate and in our desperation as a human being you saw the lamb to you before your eyes he took the book and loosed the seals and then you realized everything's fine with me if i suffer i suffer it doesn't matter because now my vision's been lifted above the church ages and now i can see beyond jesus for the glory that lay ahead endured the cross despising the shame why because he had vision of what was coming next can we have a vision of what's coming next praise god brother branham i just want to finish for a few minutes with this last bit of thought here brother branham comes to serve is this the sign of the answer he's going to talk about the vision he's had of going out west and and then he's going to talk about getting caught up in the constellation of seven angels which told him to go out west for the revelation of the seven thunders and then come back or the revelation to the seven seals and come back and he says here's what brother graham says he gets down to the end of that message he said i feel like isaiah in the temple that day when he saw the angels flying back and forth with wings over their faces and over their feet and flying with wings holy holy holy oh how that young prophet was shook he began to age up a bit and when he seen that though he had seen visions he screamed out what was me father maybe i felt somewhat like that when i seen those angels the other night or the other morning rather woe is me for i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell among an unclean people father cleaned me when isaiah got a heavenly vision it put him in desperation when john got a heavenly vision and put him in desperation when brother branham gets a heavenly vision it puts him in desperation why i'm telling you if you ever really see what this message is it'll throw you in desperation you'll cry for god to change you because you can't go on like you were and be the bride of jesus christ there's got to be a change there's got to be a manifestation of where there's got to be a living life living through me there's got to be something there's got to be a change for this is real this isn't another church this is real this isn't another denomination this is the reality of christ living in a people it's real it's not lip service it's not something we talk about it's the reality friends he says now i feel like isaiah i've seen heaven open i caught a vision and it put brother branham in desperation this is what he says and here i am send me lord whatever it is i stand at this pulpit where i've been for 30 years if there's something lord you want me to do here i am i'm ready lord but may i find grace in your sight humbly i pray you are god and there is no other but you receive us lord forgive us of our sins i'm repenting from all my unbelief for all my iniquity i plea on the altar what does brother abraham do he saw a constellation of seven angels he got caught up in that constellation he saw the vision he interpreted the dreams he knows he's to go out west for the interpretation of the seven seals and he knows that comes right out of revelations 10 he already quoted it and he knows that's the tie into revelations 5. he knows all of those things and when he saw that vision it put him in desperation because there's no way he as a man can do that there's no way he can interpret that there's no way he said could this be the interpretation of the seventh thunders could that be it friends could it be this could it be that and he knows he's completely insufficient and completely incapable of handling something so holy and when he saw the vision it put him in desperation and he started to repent started to say forgive us of our sins i'm repenting for all my unbelief this is a prophet of god 1962 i'm repenting for all my unbelief for all of my iniquity i plea on the altar of god god people don't understand that they think it would be so much joy but lord what a weary what a dreadful thing for a human being to come in the presence of a great mighty being of god i pray for forgiveness of my little church here that you sent me down to lead into guide then further down he says every one of you cleanse all your heart why because he's standing in the junction standing in the breach standing in this spot where he knows some another revelation has to come amen the seven seals have to open but he can't open it and the only one who can open it amen is one who doesn't have dirty hands and dirty lips and in this state he recognizes he needs something he's like jacob he's like isaiah he's like john amen there's nobody worthy woe is me i'm weeping because nobody's worthy and he's telling the church cleanse your heart i repent you repent let's all repent why because he's in the junction he's seen the heavenly vision he knows what time we're coming to but he can't do it it's going to take christ himself the mighty angel descending to do it and then after you see christ himself come down and open the seals then we move to rejoicing and shouting and praising and all the hallelujahs ringing out because we've made it through the breach we've made it through the transition we've moved from the church ages to the heavenly realm and we've seen the seals open brother branham had a difficult job he he was the prophet of the age like isaiah when isaiah come to the vision of heaven and said what was me isaiah was purified from the living coal and when isaiah was purified he saw the whole word is that right john comes to the same place and john says woes me but when he sees that there's a bleeding bloody lamb that died in his stead that could take the book and loose the seals now he begins rejoicing and after john's rejoicing what does john see john sees the whole word unveiled and he hears the revelation of the seven thunders which is the mystery of the seals john gets the revelation of the whole thing and what happens to brother branham the same pattern i tell you friends i think the same thing can happen to you and i yes i think the same thing can happen to you and i lord you've opened my eyes enough to see the mighty god unveiled i know this message is true i know this is you and i know you're the mighty god but woe is me and god there's not a living soul that can help me i can't help me nobody else can help me there's not a church that can help me if i can't get help in this church the next church ain't going to do it if it's this one or this denomination or that one or this way of thinking it's not going to help me god i've seen how pure you are and how fallen man is and there's nobody that can bridge the gap i need you to bridge this gap for me and i need you i need to see you open the seals for me and when god can open the seals for you and i individually then we begin to see 66 books we begin to see one story one theme one goal god has had all this time and every character and story and type has been to reveal this one goal that god has i'm going to stop but i want to share one more thing but i just want to leave this right here i just feel to leave this right here the same pattern is unfolding and once we see when god comes down and does something for us and opens our eyes and cleanses us by the word it opens up 66 books when the seals are opened by the lamb when we see the lamb take the book not because somebody else said so you understand friends not because somebody said it happened but because it happened to me i got the revelation i saw the vision john saw the lamb open the book that was important because then he wasn't depending on the angels to worship because the angels worshiped because they saw it that everybody else worshiped in heaven because they saw it but john can only worship himself because john saw it and if we're going to worship the one who's opened the seals then we have to see him open the seals he's got to reveal himself to us individually amen praise god oh i'm going to stop let's all stand god bless you i don't want to go any further because i want to end right there on that note musicians if you could come everything went completely different backwards than i expected god changed it all just a little bit ago but i hope like anything else you can see the pattern see the pattern and this message came to open our eyes this message came to lift this out of the to take the same journey isaiah took the same journey john took the same journey brother branham took it came to do the same thing for you and i it's not good enough that isaiah did it and wrote 66 books you understand that it's not good enough that john did it and was able to hear the thunders it's not even good enough that brother branham moved through this progress and he got the interpretation of the thunders that's not good enough yet amen because god wanted this book to come back into the hands of his elect seed and now we've got to go through the same process and now the prophecy is being revealed in a revolving history for me now it's my turn it was isaiah's turn it was john's turn it was brother branham's turn but now it's my turn now it's my turn and how am i going to get my eyes open there's nothing you can do to open your eyes how am i going to find grace under the sixth seal i don't know noah found grace in the eyes of the lord not in his own eyes and god can open something in your heart to where you can say this is god i know that this message is god i know that this is heaven open for me i know it because heaven is consistent of the word and when you open the word he opened heaven and when he opened heaven you could see god because god is his word and you say i know this is god but god who is me can you take a living coal off the fire and cleanse my lips can you give me eyes to see that book opened up can i see what isaiah saw 66 books can i see the whole word opened up in the mystery it's not about knowledge kick that out of your mind right now i feel that coming right now it's not about understanding and being able to recite those seals mean this verses it's not about that the opening of the seals is christ coming to you personally and revealing that you're the mystery you're the secret of the seventh seal what's the secret of the seventh seal he's coming in the virgin and you're the virgin that he wants to come in what do you mean brother daddy open the scissors if i haven't seen him open the seals i'm not talking about telling me what a white horse is and what a red horse is and what a black horse is i'm talking about the secret of it all and the secret of it all is the bride coming of christ not so you can say bride coming of christ so that you can be the bride coming of christ and we've got to go through this journey so that we can rejoice and say he's opened the seals to me he's opened the seven is the seventh seal open it's not debatable anymore you can debate others can debate but you won't suck me into debate because the seventh seal has opened right here and i don't need a quote to see it i met the one who gave all the quotes do you understand it's not religion it's not a doctrine it's not fussing it's not fighting it is seeing god it is seeing heaven it's seeing heaven open it's recognizing your need and it's watching him come down and break the revelation right to your heart you're my sweetheart and i want to marry you that's it not for the neighbor not for the person over here but for me so i want to ask you is the seventh seal open it's open and it's alive and i can't prove it by nothing else than my own experience and what's alive in my heart and it's christ god took isaiah through god took john through god took brother branham through and god has taken me through too i may not be able to explain it like john would explain i may not be able to explain like brother branham would explain it i may not even be able to explain it but one thing's for sure i experienced it and it's released a joy and rejoicing in my heart like none other and now i don't need angels to sing and i don't need my neighbors just saying i can sing myself because i s he's opened the seals i can worship and rejoice with a pure worship because he sanctified my lips with the living cold of word and he's opened the seals to me is he here he's here where is he at it's a mystery friends it's not a mystery i can solve for you it's a mystery only he can solve for you amen let's pray lord jesus we thank you for your word god only you know what you're trying to accomplish right now i don't know lord because this isn't what i plan to preach god i had another agenda i had another idea i felt you're leading lord and then you switched oh i don't understand what's happened here tonight i don't understand what was said or why but i know one thing you're in control god i pray that whoever is the target for the word tonight that that word will be a living cold lord let them cry in desperation for more but let this word come forth through the anointed preaching of the word and let it come forth as an anointed coal and touch the lips of one who's seeking for help i pray god that you would send revelation upon revelation not above all i pray that you would find all of your elect seed and god that they would find grace in your eyes and you would give them the living word the revelation for them personally don't know how i can't do it i'm just a man i can't do anything i can't help anyone i can't solve any issues lord i'm as in bad in need as anybody else's in need but god i'm asking you to do it we've seen the pattern in your word lord if we could just come by ourselves to desperation seeing your words seeing the perfection of your word seeing the beauty of your word but knowing we have a lack lord we can trust you to fill the need god would you meet the need right now by giving revelation let your children see you open the book lord and loose the seal in their heart that they would recognize that you're wanting to unite with them and live through them let it be more than words this time lord let it be beyond lord an altar call or a prayer let it go beyond those things lord let the reality touch down in the heart god that's the greatest desire of my life is that your children would come to a new birth lord god not in the fashion of a of a prayer not in the fashion lord of a of a statement but in the reality lord in the reality of a life lived god bring forth your elect seed in this hour by revelation god i ask that you would put those in need in desperation and through desperation i pray that you would meet their need we love you father take us from here and live your life through us lord guide us in every step of the journey guide us everywhere you want us to go have preeminence in us and let the reality strike our hearts we pray in jesus christ's name amen bless you change my

on preaching this message preaching it like this but only god knows what he's doing right now only god knows whose heart he's pricking and what he's trying to accomplish but i just want to say this message is god it is heavenly realm opened up it is heaven made open for you and i it's not a form of teaching it's not as form of beliefs it's not any of those things it's not another church like any other church that's on the planet it's not a religion it's none of those things this is christ himself amen i pray that god gives you a revelation that goes beyond church that goes beyond doctrine that goes beyond teachings that goes beyond a message book i hope i pray god reveals this to you i'm not just saying words i i'm not belittling anything but there's i hope there's a revelation that goes beyond all of those things into the reality of what's all around us right now amen it's here it's right here he's here heaven is here the angels are singing right here everything's taking place right here right now don't wait for something else don't wait for another place heaven has been opened by this message the door is open at the end of the laboratory in church age amen if god can give you eyes to see say god catch me away bring me out of this touch me with the coal of fire lord let me see the book open in my life let me connect with you and let the reality of all of that live right here we can forget it when we go to work and we can have problems and family problems and work problems and we can slip back into spiritual amnesia but we need to constantly go back to the word to shake ourselves out of the mental and cardinal and back to the reality that we're supposed to live in this is real friends the job's going to go the family's gonna go this world is gonna go the government's gonna go everything's gonna go but everything that you've held in your heart is gonna materialize before let's put all of our attention on that oh god bless you i know you love the word
