========================================

[Music] lift it and up this thirsting of my soul bread of heaven fill [Music] my [Music] is oh praise the lord amen it's good to see you all today wonderful the devil don't like us tries to send a snowstorm every saturday but he loses amen while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to john chapter 5 and read verse 39. we're continuing on in the same vein of thought that we've been in this scripture says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me while you're stating let's turn to matthew 13 and read one more portion of scripture before we see it in matthew chapter 13. and i'm like to begin at verse 10. matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and said to him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given so if in order for you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom you already have to have something amen you already have to have sin because to him that hath it shall be given amen and and he shall have in more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even take away even that he hath so this is very strange language very strange terminology because if you have if you already have then you're going to receive it shall be given that you shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath so he has something but he doesn't have the right thing amen it's not that he didn't have anything but he didn't have the second group doesn't have what the first group has amen and that's the seed of god amen that's the predestinated election that come from god so if you have it more will be given if you don't have it even what you have will be taken away hallelujah verse 13 therefore speak i to them in parables because they they seeing see not in hearing they hear not neither do they understand praise the lord let's bow our heads their heavenly father we thank you lord for your word it is so rich and so precious to us lord and we just appreciate every time that we get to gather together like this and now we ask all that you would come on the scene in such a supernatural way and do what only you can do by using the foolishness of preaching to save the lost i pray that you move the man out of the way and take this vessel of clay lord and use it for your glory speak your eternal words lord through these lips and that you might be glorified forever we give ourselves to you and ask that you would have preeminence this morning in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated so so we find out that jesus intentionally taught in parables amen it was on purpose and intentional that he taught parables because there's only a certain group who's intended to know the mysteries of the kingdom amen so there is a group who's intended to know and a group who's not intended no and the group who should know already hath and the group is not intended no does not already have it's that simple amen and so if you find yourself in the category where you have something and the mysteries are being opened to you you should be the happiest person on this planet because that doesn't come to everybody amen that's a very special position that you didn't put yourself in that you didn't work yourself up to you have nothing to do with it god had predestinated before the foundation of the world and if god is revealing his mysteries to you and it's opening up not in a way that i'm just going to repeat what somebody else says but i see the picture amen it's real it's a reality to me i see it and i'm part of it amen that should make you sing and shout and dance and be happy every day of your life amen because even here if every day is a treachery and every work day is hard and sickness and strife and financial issues hit you all the time nothing can take away what you already have amen nothing can stop the mysteries from being unlocked in your life and after this life of toil and pain and suffering is over you go back to that which you came from hallelujah so the message isn't a new form of belief it's not something else it's not something that's a little bit better or a little bit higher it's more than that it's christ amen and it came to reveal christ that's why the message came to reveal you to yourself amen what is the opening of the seals revealing christ who was identified in that opening in the fields it says first seal i'm going to i'm not going to call you church i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand hallelujah amen if you've been unveiled under those seals you should be happy happy happy brother brahm says in the kinsman redeemer 1960 says and this story was written in all the old manuscripts when they were segregating the bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together in the old testament this book of ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted so we've been through tamar we've been through rahab and now we're going to begin to look at ruth he said ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why if it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in it amen there's a hidden revelation amen the book of ruth is just another parable in the bible and you can read it and read it and read it and miss the parable but if you have the mystery will be revealed to you hallelujah there's a hidden revelation in it and then this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning and it'll bring you real close to god i'm excited to read ruth and i pray my whole soul this morning that god will catch every heart so spellbound till he'll reveal himself just what he is in this story what he is to you how to accept him and then you once see it it's so simple you wonder how you ever went over the top of it amen but it can only be revealed by the holy spirit and that's the amazing part of the mysteries being revealed i mean you go back and comb through the bible and the words haven't changed the print there's not a new version there's not an updated release it's the same king james bible that we've been reading since 1611. the ink on the paper is not changing but the bible's becoming new it's changing for me but it's not changing amen so i must be changing if it's the same and i'm seeing it different reading it different the change is not here the change must be right here amen hallelujah i'm so thankful for that so thankful every time we read through it's a new book every time we go back to the word it's constantly unfolding and opening and unfolding that shows that the bride is maturing that she's growing into her predestinated position because if you go back to the message again and it's the same message you've read a dozen times you go back to the word it's the same word you've read a thousand times you've stopped growing i said god don't ever let me stop growing amen god keep opening up your mysteries keep revealing yourself to me that it's new all the time that it's fresh every time i pick it up it's like i know i've read this message i know i put those marks on that book but that's like i've never read this portion before it's as if it's the first time all over again oh talk about talking about keeping people excited about coming to church you don't have to do a program you don't have to pull people or lay a guilt trip on them to come to church all they got to do is come and see the word open the breaking of bread and they'll come back amen the seed of god will come back week after week after week because that's the most exciting part of our lives is to see the word broken and open and unveiled hallelujah amen he goes on to say now many reading the bible read it just stand up and read a page and read a page you'll never get it because it's in riddles and jesus thank god for making it like that said you've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and we'll reveal it and reveal it to babe such as we'll learn as i've often said and mrs branham sitting back there this morning but when i'm overseas she'll write me a letter she'll say dear bill i'm sitting here tonight with the children i'm thinking of you and she'd go ahead and write what she's going to do but i love her and i know her so well i can read between the lines i know exactly what she's saying whether she writes it on here or not because i know what she's saying why is that that's a close contact we're one and she knows my nature i know hers so now brother ben can take a letter that his wife is written in when he's overseas and she'll write a letter amen and she wants to convey to him certain things certain emotions certain feelings certain longings that she's having for him but she doesn't want anybody who picks up the letter to know her deepest desires and longings and all that she's really trying to convey it might be embarrassing it might make her blush a little bit so she writes it in such a way that only he knows the message she's trying to get across and how does she know that he's going to get the point of what she's saying is because they're so close he knows her nature she knows his nature and she knows how to word it in such a way that he's going to get it amen and that's exactly how god has written his bible it is a love letter amen and he's written it in such a way that you could read it and read it and read it and read it and never get the point the point is not the kids have went to bed and i'm all alone that's not the point the point is i'm missing you wish you were here beside me but you could read it and read it and read it and never get the point amen but if you've come into that union that oneness that closeness and you know his nature he knows your nature now you're not reading it like a textbook you're not reading it like it's written to somebody else you're reading it like it's written just to you right now today and that's how we have to read the bible not as though it was written to those that were that were back in in palestine when they first cross over jordan he didn't write it for them he wrote it for us oh he wrote that those were instructions given to them in the exodus journey no those are instructions given to you in your journey amen and then you know what he's saying to us if we could go to matthew chapter one and keep going forward in this thought that we're in i love reading this and it feels like we've been out of it for a couple weeks now so i want to jump right back in and do a little review and move forward matthew chapter one says the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren so you notice it doesn't mention any of the brethren and only mentions judas from this point on we're only going to follow judah's lineage because he was prophesied that out of judah judah will have the scepter out of judah will come the law giver so if i would like to read the two verses that state that if we could go together to genesis 49 we read this several weeks ago but i just want to lay it in here again as a review genesis 49 so we can understand why the lineage is following judah genesis 49 and verse 8. this is as israel as jacob's beginning to bless his children one at a time and speak over them he comes to judah in verse 8 he says judah thou art he who thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee judah is a lion's wealth from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be so here of all the 12 children this is the one who's going to have the scepter the lineage of the lawgiver the kingly race is coming or the kingly line is coming through judah now if we turn over the first chronicles we'll pick this up again first chronicles chapter 5. so you have samuel king's chronicles first chronicles chapter 5 and we'll read verse 1 and 2. so first chronicles 5 1-2 now the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright so now the the birthright was rubens as the firstborn but it was transferred from reuben who was the firstborn of the first woman leah the first wife and it was transferred and given to the firstborn of the second wife rachel and rachel was the one that he was jacob was after from the beginning he'd never wanted to marry leah he wanted to marry rachel and that's important because brother brenham said god from before that foundation of the world always wanted a gentile bride it was god's desire from the beginning to have a gentile bride amen but in order to get the gentile bride he had to come and redeem leah first work the seven years for leah and afterwards he could get a gentile bride rachel and then after he got rachel then he had to work seven more years for rachel go through the seven church ages amen but at the end of seven years amen then joseph is born and joseph is the firstborn amen of the desired wife let's put it that way and so when reuben sinned reuben had to sin reuben had to fail because god's plan has to be displayed here so when reuben falls in sin the birthright doesn't go from him to levi the second born no it goes down to rachel's firstborn who is joseph who's the type of christ who gets the firstborn birthrights so then we go to the next one next verse verse 2 for judah prevailed above his brethren and of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was joseph's so now judah who is the fourth born uh uh first born of jacob f fourth born of israel is the deliverer and he's the kingly lion who is the deliverer one two three four four is god's number of deliverance amen so we find that the king is going to come through the fourth born and this number four is going to run all the way through the bible just like the number seven and all these other numbers so so we just say this in a way of review this is why we're coming down through judah because matthew is describing the coming of the king because you have matthew mark luke and john the number four again you have four cherubims around the throne of god around the mercy seat and there's four faces on each one the lion the ox the man and the eagle and matthew is the lion gospel amen so it starts off with the lineage of the king and perfect everything in this bible is perfect amen so we start the beginning showing now we're coming the the covenant the covenant to abraham the covenant to david now we know we have jesus christ amen the son of abraham the son of david why is it jumping around by hundreds of years because he's showing there's two covenants here there's a covenant that abraham's seed shall possess the gates of his enemy shall possess all things and it's really a restoration promise of everything adam lost is given to abraham's seed so christ is coming as abraham's seed and the son of david amen and david was promised that forever you shall have a son sit on the throne so now these two covenants are coming together in jesus christ it's beautiful so this this matthew is the lion gospel it's the coming king gospel and it starts off with the heritage the lineage of the king so then we go the the verse three and judas begot pharas and zerah of tamar and pharaohs begot ezram and ezram begot aram and aram begot a meena dab and a meenada begot nayasan and naasan begot salman and solomon begot boaz of rahab and we just went through rahab the harlot of jericho amen and boaz begot obed of ruth amen so this is where we're at now ruth we've talked about tamar we've talked about rahab and now we would like to spend a little time talking about ruth but as we get into ruth you find out that rahab and ruth are tied together in fact they're all tied together this lineage is very linked and we're going to get in to many ways of that in the future maybe not today but in the future but i want to back up and cap off rahab to move in to ruth because you can't you can't understand what's going on a ruth without understanding what happened with rahab and there's there was there was a quote that i just completely missed last time we ministered and i couldn't believe it when i got back and said i missed that and it was my favorite one of the whole message so i'd like to share that with you so we find out when when they crossed over when the nation of israel crossed jordan to go in and possess the land the first obstacle they come to is the great big denomination of jericho and they had confidence in their walls and it says jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in so they really drew their denominational lines and they said we're not going to hear any of your heresy we're not going to hear any of your false doctrine they had shut the doors to the revival to the truth that was coming into the land but it was too late there had been two spies already slipped in brother brennan said it must have been a couple tape boys got in there and played a tape and rahab heard the message and believed and so rahab was given because she believed amen she was given a true token that her whole household could be saved but her household was not automatically saved by her token they had to believe her and come under her token amen it wasn't a magic spell that she had where she could go jingle the token and say oh my family's saved no the instructions were all that are in your household and brother graham said the household of faith and then so she had to get out there and share the message amen and she had to share and they had to believe rahab rahab held the token and in all of jericho now when the spies leave and the spies go out now amen now and all of jericho there's one little humble woman that's holding the secret of salvation from the oncoming judgment and that little woman is holding the secret amen in order to come in order to come to the place where you can be saved from the judgment that's about to strike you had to hear what this little woman had to say and you had to believe her now think of how hard that would be in the day you live in jericho not the mayor not the governor not the priest not the wise men not the scholars the harlot in jericho that everybody knew is the harlot she's now the one holding the secret she's now got the message and a true token and she's telling you the way to escape and pending judgment and you had to listen to the humble little harlot woman from jericho why would we think it's so strange that you have to hear what the bride is saying in this day to escape the appending judgment why would that be so complicated it's already happened i mean there's a humble little woman that's outcast amen amen the denominations are shut up against israel hallelujah but there's a little woman that knows the secret and by faith amen by her expression of faith she was given a true token so that anybody that would come under this token could be saved hallelujah so then we know that they cross over and they circle now they've got to go through the church ages you know so now they circle six times six days they circle once amen one time each day but when they come to the seventh day or the seventh church age there's got to be seven circlings around the city because all seven ages have to be explained in the seventh all that was left off all the mysteries and everything that the reformers had left off through the church ages now has to be explained so around we go seven times amen tying together all the loose ends from all the previous church ages in the seventh and after seven times around then the seven priests with the seven trumpets all blow together as one blast and then the walls come crashing then the people shout join them and shout and then the walls come crashing down but this is the quote that i wanted to share with you and i left it off in in 1963 in the seventh seal it says notice but when the seals were announced they were all in one great divine thing to call out a group of people there was one trumpet sound and seven seals were broke see if you go back to joshua 6 and i'll just read it to you joshua 6 20 says so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet when they were all to bless all seven priests amen representing the seven church age messengers because each church aged messenger sounded a trumpet brother branham told us they broke a seal they sounded a trumpet when when their message was refused they went off the scene and a plague poured out so now each one sounded the gospel trumpet to gather into elect and declare war spiritual warfare so now we have the seven priests amen all blasting with the trumpet the full the full word from seven church ages all sounding at once and when they they heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat so the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city so now on the seventh seal he says notice but when the seals were announced they were all in one great divine thing to call out a group of people there was one trumpet sound and the seven seals were broke same thing's happened in our day we've come now and now watch broke down the denominational walls in our life it's the revelation of the seven seals amen those walls are broke flat and what did you have to do for your trinitarian understanding for your false uh your false understandings of the blood and false understandings of baptism and false understandings of godhead what did you have to do for that wall to be broken down in your mind all you had to do was hear the trumpet recognize its jubilee and shout amen the victory all you had to say is amen that's nothing but the truth you didn't have to do anything else you just had to recognize that certain sound and when you recognized the certain sound then you had to amen and shout and rejoice in jubilee with the trumpet and say we're free victory is ours [Applause] and the walls of denomination started crumbling all around us hey amen and then verse 21 joshua 6 goes on to say and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and oxen sheep and ass and the edge with the edge of the sword but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the heartless house and bring out against the woman and all that she hath as you swear unto her this is the part i wanted to get to as we bridge over to the next section brother bram says in the message the token from september of 63 so when god's wrath destroyed that big city the token sign held her house safely amen what the sign was on her token or the token was on her house when the rest of the city shook to the ground what was it what was it joshua the messenger of god now listen carefully this next statement god himself recognized his messenger's message that should make you really happy amen god himself recognized his messenger's message and if god amen as he's collapsing walls and bringing down a mighty city if god could hold amen this little house up and preserved while everything else was falling flat under his destruction if he could do that why did he do that for because of the messenger's message was believed by faith in this little house would hold it up and god honored her his messenger's message if god honored it in that day will god honor in this day amen that's why you can stake your soul on it you can rest assured that god will honor this messenger's message amen because god called the messenger god vindicated the messenger god anointed him to preach it's not our job to figure out where he's right and where he's wrong and where he made mistakes it's our job to believe the messenger's message and god himself will honor the messenger's message amen it's not for rahab to say well i think joshua was a little bit wrong i think when those two spies came amen they played that tape there was a little there was a little misstep there my goodness it wasn't her job it wasn't her job to preach it it was her job to believe it it wasn't her job to sort it out it was her job to believe it and she believed it it's not our job to correct the prophet it's not our job to use intellect and understanding in a concordance to correct him hallelujah it's our job to believe believe the message and god will honor his messenger's message that message promises a rapture and a catching away a translation before the first bomb falls you think god's going to fail to honor his messenger's message amen so all i want to do is believe the message stick with the message because god called him vindicated him backed him up told him what to preach revealed the word to him and i'm going to believe it and rest my soul there hallelujah goes on to say why and what in the message why it had to be shepherds from december 64. and another reason i might say notice the babe was born in bethlehem which bethlehem and the hebrew interpretation as we had a couple years ago here bethlehem means house of god's bread and we proved in the scripture he could not come any other place bethlehem was founded by rahab and her husband rahab was a heart at that a general quartered from the israelite army and after they had taken jericho and by faith she believed the message of god in her condition and she was saved this is the part i love by faith she believed the message of god in her condition she didn't have to get out of her condition than believe she believed in her condition as a harlot in the city amen she didn't have to clean her life at first she didn't she believed it amen and she was saved hallelujah and then we know that that afterwards she was taken out of the camp and out of the camp of israel out of the camp with the nomination she separated out and solomon goes out of the camp of israel and he finds her outside the camp and the two are united together because we find christ outside of the camp he went out of the camp we have to come out of the camp and we unite with him outside the camp and now she went from the harlot in jericho to the wife of solomon and solomon by birthright is the next in lineage for the kingly line of judah so judah's moving down first born to first born to firstborn the firstborn he's moving all the way down and now we come to solomon and solomon is the prince of the house of judah and the prince of the house of judah is the one who finds rahab outside the camp and marries her so instantly she changes from harlot to princess hallelujah have you made that change amen have you made that change from denominational or worldly person amen to a princess amen hallelujah it might take in rehab a little bit of time to get accustomed to that but she was going to have to get accustomed to that and quit acting like the harlot and jericho and start acting like the princess in judah because that's who she was and what made her that was marriage made her that she couldn't make herself that all she could do was believe the message when she believed the message amen the message saved her and brought her out of the camp you believe the message the message will save you and bring you out of the camp of men's ideas out of the camp of your own ideas out of the camp of worldliness and that's where you meet christ amen in an invisible union with christ that's where you're changed rahab couldn't say i'm no longer the harlot i'm a righteous woman treat me better treat me with respect she couldn't do that in her own marriage she had no merit that was able to change her condition amen now realize it was faith in the message of god that brought her salvation in the day of destruction and that faith caused her house to stand when all others fell and that faith was what obligated the servants of god to take her and bring her out of the camp and out there she meets solomon the prince of the house of judah and married to him and that's when everything in her life changes do you see yourself yes everything changes now her title changes her characteristics change i don't think someone would stand by and let somebody call his little bride a harlot right i think and brother bam said he was a general in the army i think you would be looking for a big fight if you would bound badmouth rahab from that point on because she wasn't rahab the harlot she was mrs solman miss salman benjuda [Laughter] nobody was going to say anything to her she got preferential treatment then she would come into the land and as joshua would divide the land there was a portion that was given to solomon and that portion that was given to solomon happened to be bethlehem amen and so rahab and her husband founded bethlehem bethlehem is the house of god's bread so out of bethlehem is coming god's bread that's why christ the manna that came from heaven that bread that came down from heaven had to be born in bethlehem how was bethlehem founded it was founded by rahab and solomon now you're starting to see the love letter of the bible come together like never before it's brother man said this is one story it is one story amen so this is why this is why because rahab married solomon and solomon was given the land that's bethlehem because of that that forced caesar to tax the whole world so why was there a taxation on the whole world because rahab and solomon settled in bethlehem that's why there was a taxation of the whole world the whole world is moving according to god's plan uh secular governments are moving to to bring about god's plan amen because christ had to be born in bethlehem because bethlehem was founded amen by this gentile woman who was married to the prince of judah and that was going to force caesar caesar probably didn't even know why he was doing it maybe the circumstances god worked out worked it out to where that was a reasonable choice that made sense and maybe that caused political turmoil in his day maybe there was a section in the senate that was against him in a section that was for him and he had to take a stand and say we're going to do this taxation why does he have to do all this what's happening because the manna has to come from the house of god's bread right in line right where it's supposed to come it's beautiful friends it's beautiful but the band preached in december of 63 why little bethlehem and he says and then this rahab after she was spared she got all of her people in everything that was under the cord was saved just like when god in egypt when all was under the blood was saved all was under the scarlet cord was saved all under the blood of jesus is saved all out from under it is lost and is ready for destruction and we find out now in doing this then we understand by history that she courted some general i don't know his name right now in israel and she finally married this man and they settled up there near near this little place and here solomon was one of the founded bethlehem shia gentiles connected with it to begin with a gentile rahab the harlot now we find out that solomon founded this little city of bethlehem and he got boaz and boaz was the one who married ruth and another gentile and we're following this lineage now ruth she got she was a moabite and she married boaz and came into his little city just in barley season oh if we had time this morning to own that i'd i'd owe my wife six dresses because he promised his wife he wouldn't go long he'd buy her a dress i've never made that promise they said now to dwell on the subject naomi represented the orthodox church was went away on the account of a famine went over into the land of moab like the scattering of israel all out among the nations and then she come back she brought back ruth to moabite and she returned just in barley season just the gathering in the first barley that is that gentile church coming to god just at barley season again what a beautiful picture there and then she and boaz being married and their famous son obed was begotten there and also born and then his son great son jesse came from obed there also he begot david his son the king david came out so brother branham is telling the story of bethlehem but he's got to go back to solomon and rahab and then shortly after that you have boaz and ruth and then it comes down to david but he says in the breach now look at the book of ruth gives a beautiful picture of this how boaz and naomi had lost the estate you know you heard me preach on that haven't you raised your hands up if you heard me preach on it boaz had to become a redeemer and he was the only one that could he had to be a kinsmen and near kinsmen and redeemed naomi he got ruth that was jesus boaz typing christ and when he redeemed israel he got the gentile bride so brother branham really quickly there explains the whole book of ruth very quickly he says now it's about a kinsmen redeemer boaz has got to redeem naomi the jewish church and when he redeems naomi he gets the gentile bride and that's what the book of ruth is about amen it's amazing that the book of ruth let's just turn to ruth ruth chapter one it's amazing that the book of ruth is the eighth book of the bible it's gonna tie in very good to the number eight amen let's read ruth chapter 1 verse 1. we may not read the entire book but we're going to read quite a few passages there's four chapters in the book of ruth and they're divided out really well in four phases of ruth's journey and we're going to get into that but chapter 1 verse 1 it says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech in the name of his wife naomi in the name of his two sons melon and chileon ephrathites of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and their two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah in the name of the other ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years and melon and chileon died also both of them and the women was left of her two sons and her husband so we set the scene here in the book of ruth and we find out that that there was a time of famine in the land amen because this is going to type the church ages really well because the church ages come in a type of famine in the land and what they do is they begin to leave the promised word and the first church age and start adding their own interpretations and own ideas and starting denominations and nicolaitanism and all that begins to come in amen be because they're never to leave that promised land and the church was never to leave the pure word they began to journey out to try to find what bread they left the house of god's bread in a time of famine to go look for bread this is amazing why would there be a famine in the house of god's bread you know it doesn't give us record of anybody else leaving now we realize boaz would have been there solomon or boaz saul and boaz is solomon's son so at the same time this famine is going on solomon may be alive boaz most certainly is alive at that time but they don't leave the land somehow god was able to sustain them through this hard time but elimelech wasn't willing to go through the hardship amen he was looking for an easier way to get bread and so he was willing to leave the house of god's bread to go into moab which is a type of denominations [Applause] and what is the denomination a man adding his own interpretation to the word of god and then what do they do when they have it all figured out and they have their own interpretation then what did they do they built a nice little wall around it so that they don't lose what they found and they don't grow any more from there now we got to be careful because it's easy to say denominations and baptism but we've got to realize we can do the same thing it is so easy for us to do the same thing the same failures the same faults that's happened year after year generation after generation don't think that the devil now after the opening of the seal says i'm not going to touch that bride amen he's going to use the same tactics that have always worked he's going to try the same tactics and where is he working he's trying to work in the elect amen he's not working brother said he's not working in the bar room amen he's not working on the street corner he's trying to disrupt god's plan so you got to be careful that you know god god allows these hard times to come just to test the people god loves to prove his people god loves to prove who's his and who's not who has faith and who does not and we have to remember faith must be tested and a faith that is not tested is a faith that can't be trusted i've got faith i trust in faith we'll find out whether you can trust in your faith when the hard time comes when the testing comes and you had great faith when the testing comes and you run away you didn't have what you thought you had and sometimes god will do that to his children so they realize what i have is not sufficient and i've got a substitute but what i need is the real thing amen so don't don't mourn if you've been there we've all been there amen that's the grace of god to expose that we're standing on a false foundation so that we'll drive to the real thing and say god i'm not going to be satisfied till i get the real thing amen the faith that will endure every trial every hardship every phase of my life has to be founded on faith in god's word amen if i've got an intellectual faith if i've got to hand me down faith amen if i've got faith like i caught the flu i just rubbed off from those around me that's not going to stand the test but i need the one that'll stand the test amen and boaz did not leave the house of god's bread amen in time of famine elimelech did it's amazing brother ben says in kinsmen redeemer from 1960 now this story starts out something on the manor as a lovable sweet woman her name was naomi which means pleasant alimonleck was her husband means worship pleasant worship was her family they had a son molon one of the that means sickness and chilean the other meant weary gloomy sadness there was the family and they came a famine in the land of israel and the first mistake a jew ever makes is leave that land god gave them that land when abraham was given that land god told him not to leave that land and when he made a mistake and went down into guerrer got in trouble a jew is never to leave palestine that's his lotted place mother man says in the message the comforter from 61 he said i live by the word jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and this is it and that is given to us as a heritage it's our heritage the word oh god let us think of it in deepness in the deepness of it our heritage our inheritance amen our land is the word of god amen and in the first church age they never should have left it they never should have left it to seek a more clear understanding amen even peter says some things that paul writes are hard to be understood so men wanted a clearer understanding we don't need a clear understanding we need faith to believe it amen and we need a holy ghost revelation not a clear understanding the clearer understanding comes with the holy ghost revelation it is a clearer understanding sometimes we try to substitute the work of the holy ghost by a teaching session or a seminar amen that's not going to do it the work of the holy ghost is to give you a clear understanding [Applause] a revelation and it's amazing brother branham says we're talking about the book of ruth he says when we see it we're going to see the plan of god in there and it's so simple we're gonna wonder how we ever missed it because it's written in riddles amen and when the riddles are revealed you find out it's so simple not complex super simple and it's been laying right there and been breezed over for generations but it's simple so now we find out they go they leave their portion of land that's been given to them amen once god gives it to you he expects you never to leave it that's why sometimes i wonder when people say i got a revelation of this you name the subject whatever it is i got a revelation of this and a few weeks later they're willing to leave that revelation to go to another one if god gives you a revelation don't ever leave it if god gives you a portion of the word he gives you a place to rest don't leave it don't go anywhere else stay right there amen hallelujah so so elima like left looking for easier bread and he went into the denominations looking for easier bread and there see there's consequences for leaving the land amen and there they have two sons and the two sons are named sickness what what brother of him say sickness and weary gloomy sadness sickness and gloominess or sadness the the the reference in my scofield bible says sickness and pining so why did they name their sons sickness and pining why did they name them that name brother branham said there's a lot to a name why did they name them sickness and pining amen i don't know brother bem doesn't say but maybe it has something to do with the hardship in the land because the famine was affecting them amen and they were looking at circumstances not at the promise because if you're looking at the promise amen everything's wonderful everything's joyful amen but everything is going wrong in your life i'm not looking at my circumstances i'm not looking at the scene i'm looking at the unseen i'm looking at the promise and everything is perfect in my life everything i'm going through was ordained before the foundation of the world and it's bringing me into a position god wants me to be in everything in my life is perfect [Applause] the bad days are perfect there's things that god wants me to conquer overcome put under my feet and if he wants me to be an overcomer he's got to give me something to overcome and if he wants me to rise above something there's got to be something to rise above and if he wants something under my feet he's got to give me something to put under my feet and we look at the fulfilling of these promises because it's a promise for us to be overcomers is that right it's a promise for things to be put under our feet is that right so fulfilling the promise god gives you trials and tribulations to keep his word amen you mean this trial yes god's keeping his word so that you can be the overcomer because the promises are to him that overcometh and god wants to make sure you get the promises so you've got to be him that overcometh so now in the in the famine when there's no more view of the promise of god amen there's children that are born in bethlehem that are named sickness and pining hallelujah i say they missed a revelation somewhere something was wrong in the understanding somewhere you're living in bethlehem you're living in the house of god's bread out of bethlehem shall come a governor that shall rule the people you're in the place you're in the place solomon brought rahab amen and built the city off of this great story that's taken place in the house of god's bread and you're naming your children sickness and pining so there's a lack of revelation how are you doing well you know i got problems and things are going wrong and it doesn't seem like anything's going right you're in the house of god's bread you're in christ you're in the word the word has been revealed in this day you're smack dab in the middle of it how can you be talking like that amen you should be saying everything's clicking just right on time god's timepiece is moving just right in my life amen there's some things that i'm going to get to overcome here recently and i'm working on a few more testimonies today hallelujah amen because we've got a revelation we know the truth brother madam's told us these things they're not mysteries to us anymore they're absolute facts in our life we know that nothing happens to a child of god unless it first crosses god's sacred desk and he signs off on it amen there's nothing happening to you that god has not permitted to happen to you and it's all for the kingdom of god so with that revelation we don't have problems we've got victories in motion amen we've got overcoming that's taking place now amen there's going to be mighty things that are taking place don't name your children sickness and binding name them victors and conquerors and overcomers but don't name them sickness and pining hallelujah so now down in the land moving away from the promised land out from where they belong now these boys each marry moabitis girls and so that we know orpah and ruth come on the scene and and melon marries ruth and chilean mary's orpah and we know the father dies then the sons die and so now we come through the first three church ages and now we've come to the dark ages for naomi amen the the three have died she's here in the dark ages nothing's working out but she hears there's bread in bethlehem and god is going to start a restoration process back because there was four insects that ate the bride tree down and brought it right to thyatira to the dark ages where there was nothing left but what was in the root but then through the next three church ages he brings it back then after the church ages he caps it with fruit amen so there's four stages down and there's four stages back so hold on to that number four because we're going to see it here in ruth let's look at ruth one and six and she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people and living and giving them bread she heard about luther's revival amen the words coming back that just shall live by faith amen and giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return into the land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant you that meant that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto the people now now let's pay close attention what's happening here there naomi's decided to go back there's now a return to the land a return to the word that is going to take place and in this there's there's two vines there's two women there's two churches there's the false vine and the true vine there's there's there's the the foolish virgin and the true virgin all right and the wise virgin so now she looks at them and says now you stay here amen you stay in the system you stay and all of this i'm going back i've heard there's a restoration going on i'm going back and they both lifted up their voices and wept and they both said we'll go with you amen they both made a declaration we're going with you we want to go back to the word we want to go back to the house of god's bread and they both declared they wanted to go then naomi says in verse 11. well let's let's read it again verse 10. and they said unto her surely not just i'm thinking about it i've considered it it's impossible no surely we will return with thee unto thy people so they both make a sure declaration surely we will return with you unto your people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have a husband and if i should say i have hope if i if i should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for agree with me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave under her and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people unto her trinity doctrine my sister in law hath gone back into her people unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go whither thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her i want to tell you this is exactly what god does to the tea this is the hand of god they no doubt love their mother-in-law after so many years of living in their household they would they would dearly love them and and orpah amen and ruth they had made a sure declaration surely we will return with you and she tried to get him to stay back she goes return to your mother's house the lord deal kindly with you for the way you've dealt with the dead and with me and returned back and they both wept they they raised up their voice they wept and they said surely we will return with you into the land but then naomi starts to describe the hardship that you'll have to suffer i don't have any more husbands for you to marry if i would have a husband today and i should conceive in my old age and bring forth would you wait and keep from having husbands until they were grown and could take you well there's no she's saying there's no hope for you there is no chance for you to have your hopes and dreams there's no hope for you for marriage there's no hope for you for children there's no hope for your own family naomi is saying it's a hopeless cause if you come with me you have to die you have to give up all your hopes and all your dreams to follow after me and orpah said i love you kissed her and left and went right back to her gods why because there she could live her life there she could follow her dreams there she could have her successes she could marry she could raise children she could find her own satisfaction in her own desired life back there but ruth was not that way ruth didn't care if she never got married again ruth didn't care if she never brought forth a child ruth says where you go i go where you sleep i sleep where you die i die god do unto me and more so if odd but death separate you and i what was ruth doing she was declaring that she was the seed orpah was not it doesn't matter what you have to go through amen when when god called paul and then he told ananias go tell him what things he must suffer for my name's sake god let off by projecting the suffering and paul said i'll do it well it proved it proved that paul wasn't a lexied of god and ruth's declaration do you think ruth had it figured out do you think she knew what life was going to be like she didn't have anything figured out but she knew one thing something in my heart says this is right amen i've got to go back to bethlehem i've got to go back to the house of god's bread and i know it's right amen i don't understand it but i know it's right and where you go i'll go where you live i'll live amen your god will be my god where you die i'll die and naomi says when she saw verse 18 when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her sometimes you know we wonder why i give my heart to the lord and i come to the message and i i know that it's true and i'm going to go along with it i'm going to go all the way and all of a sudden everything comes against me it's trying to find out if you're orpah or if you're ruth and you realize you're going to start losing friends and you're going to start losing family and people are not going to like you so much and you're going to be rejected by the way you wear your hair and the way you dress your clothes and the way you want to raise your children we're going to find out who's orpah and who's ruth because orpha will kiss her and say i love you you've been good to me i think the world of you you're right you're probably right but it's not for me and we'll go back to our gods ruth couldn't explain it something burning on the inside amen look at what ruth said i mean ruth didn't just say she didn't repeat the faith surely i'll go with you right she already said that it didn't work for orpah naomi wasn't going to believe surely i'll go with you no now she was expressing the deep desire in her heart where you go i go where you live you all live where you die i'll die when your god shall be my god that was something deeper than ruth's mind and it was it was deeper than her emotions orpah was going to go along because she loved her mother-in-law but we found out that orpah loved herself more than she loved her mother-in-law and she loved herself more than she loved bethlehem the house of god's bread but it wasn't so with ruth ruth had a love that wasn't based off what i get see we're going to follow this message it's going to be the ruth kind of love that we've got to have because it's not about what i get it's about what i know is true what in me says this is right and i'm willing to give my life for it amen if i lose my family if i lose my friends if i lose my reputation if i lose my job whatever i have to lose amen this is where i'm going to stay regardless of what happens to me because it's right amen so after that she went through the testing phase then naomi said okay i won't say anything else i won't persuade you because when you come to the truth you've got to go through a testing phase and it's of gone orpah failed the test ruth passed the test brother benham said in revelation chapter 5 in 1961 he says now now we want to give one more little illustration on the fifth verse here and then we'll start over get our sixth verse and start off now i want you to notice in the plan of redemption how god foreshadowed it he worked it out perfectly in ruth and boaz that's where we ended up last sunday now i want to begin right here now today on ruth and boaz now there is four stations or four junctions in ruth and boaz so remember the number four four cherubims four faces four gospels for the number of deliverance judas the fourth son of israel i mean on and on and on we could go four stages of restoration of the wheat plant four stages of restoration of the bride tree the number four so ruth happens to be in four stations the first is ruth deciding that's what we just read about ruth deciding how many ever heard me preach the message let's see your hand well all of you i guess i've heard i've had it here and i had it on tapes and so forth ruth first she had to decide whether she was going to go into this land or not with naomi she had to make a decision then after she got there the next thing she had to do was serve in the field of boaz out there barefooted gleaning behind the reapers serving and then after she had found grace in boaz's site then she had to wait till boaz has done the kinsmen redeemership to take back all new and all naomi lost in order to bring in ruth the moabite and then the next stage is ruth rewarded so we have ruth deciding ruth serving ruth resting ruth rewarded you have justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and the holy ghost itself amen you have the the stalk the torso the shock and the wheat you've got the same thing over and over again ruth rewarded now watch ruth deciding perfectly oh if anybody said that the bible isn't inspired there's something wrong with them every word of it's inspired every word of it fits right together just like a dovetail on a plank it just goes perfectly to get together like the cogs on a mighty wheel turning just time to the millionth of a second just exactly right that's the word of god amen brother ben said in the masterpiece 64 he said now there here life was the life that was in the husk the stalk the tassel the house all gathers into the seed and the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism in the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so we look at ruth we're going to see ourselves in the four chapters of ruth ruth deciding ruth serving ruth resting and ruth rewarded this is the path of the church ages but it's also our path we're going to find the same thing praise the lord so brother bram says here in blind bartimaeus from 1959 if you'll just stay with the holy spirit stay on his hands he loves you well enough to come to you and bless you and save you then stay on his hands don't you remember jesus teaching about the unjust judge how he said i fear neither god nor man but the woman torments me day and night crying after me how much more will god give to them the holy spirit who cry after him day and night we got faith to believe that god can do it and we'll do it let's take hold of it and hold on just don't let it go stay right with it if it don't come now it'll come ten minutes later hours later two weeks later a month later no matter when it comes i gotta hold and i'm going to stay with it amen that was ruth she got a hold of something real and then she was going to stay with it now ruth wasn't just a fly-by-night making a quick decision ruth had 10 years to watch this right ruth had 10 years to watch and she watched she she no doubt watched the life and heard naomi talk about the homeland then they only talk about the stories of of how that bethlehem was founded amen and the stories of jericho and the exodus march and what god had done in egypt amen this wasn't a fly by night a quick decision that she had made she had lived in this household under naomi and these two boys for quite some time but it came time for her to make her decision remember a lot of the young people here are raising the message amen they've heard about the exodus they've heard about the miracles they've heard but there comes a time that you've got to make your decision and god many times is going to bring you to face your decision amen and you got to choose am i going to be orpah or am i going to be ruth amen what's inside of me amen when i heard man when i heard about the exodus when i heard about christ when i saw the cloud picture when i heard about the opening of the seals what's happening inside of me amen what's stirring in me and when it comes down to decision time amen it's something more than just well you know i don't want to separate from mom and dad and you know i've got a lot of friends that go there and you know the message is probably true that's not going to work friends amen there's going to come a time that you'll end up kissing the message and walking away but there's got to be something more something real amen something with life in it something that persistence something that's got grit something that will hold on brother man said faith he has muscles and hair on its chest is not something that's weak and wishy-washy and flips around faith says it's mine and that's the response ruth had you're not going to shake me off let's go back to the land orpah says yes let's go back rue says yes let's go back she says wait a minute you're not going to have anything you're going to lose everything orpah says i love you but i'm going back to moab and she tells ruth she says your sister-in-law is gone now you go and ruth says no way you can't get rid of me we've got to have a certain kind of resolve something inside of us that says no matter how many times i'm tested no matter what goes wrong in my life no matter how many names that i've been called how many times i get sick after i believed how many trips to the hospital doesn't change anything i'm going to have it because god promised it i'm going to stick with the message because it's the truth and god's going to honor his messenger's message and i'm going to be under the true token you're not going to shake me off amen you get to the point where you say god you're not going to shake me off hallelujah you think how could you say something like that that's what he's looking for jacob he crossed the river in a time of trouble amen and he met a man and he wrestled with a man all night [Applause] and he messed messes with the man and afterwards he names the place penile or pineal or whatever he names it which means he says for i have seen god face to face so this man was god in flesh and he wrestles with a man all night and it comes to the break of day and the man says let me go and jacob says i will not amen who's he talking to who's he wrestling with amen if god wants to come push me down i'll just fall over he's not pushing me off of my promise amen if god brings a win to try to move me off i'll resist the wind here comes a man wrestling they wrestle all night amen and he comes to break a day let me go i will not let you go until you bless me maybe this message isn't for you maybe you're not a lex seed and maybe god won't fill you with the holy ghost i will not let go [Applause] until you fill me with the holy ghost what is god looking for amen what was it amen that angel didn't strike him dead that man did not strike him dead that god in flesh didn't kill him didn't ruin his life he blessed him and he changed his name from jacob sir planet to israel because thou art a prince with god because thou has prevailed who did he prevail over he prevailed over god when god was trying to shake him away and discourage him amen who did ruth prevail over ruth prevailed over naomi when naomi was trying to shake her away and when naomi says she saw that she was steadfast minded she left off trying to convince her maybe god's looking for steadfast mindedness somebody says you have to accept me because i believe it you have to take me because i believe it i have to be one of them because i believe it and i will not turn it loose and and the story of jacob was in genesis 32. he says he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let it go except thou bless me and he said and then what is thy name he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god that word power with god is not just like like you're really strong that's endurance and persistence [Music] you have endurance and persistence with god hallelujah friends sometimes we have to have endurance and persistence with god praise god i know that's the truth your faith will be tested and god wants it that way he god loves to prove his children he's not looking he what is he looking for he's looking for character what kind of character a character like unto his own character and what is it it's the seed inside that's rising up and saying it's mine it's mine it's mine where'd that seed come from came from god god when he created the world spoke and he had to believe his own words so what god operates by faith is that right god spoke and he had to believe his own word so god operates by faith it's a law he himself operates by so what is he looking for christ says when i come into the world will i find faith what's he looking for he's looking for steadfast-minded faith hallelujah don't shake off so easy god will you heal you yes it's in the word i'll heal you but you're gonna get sicker [Laughter] the promise is sure you're healed you're already healed but you're gonna feel worse and then we're going to add another symptom and another diagnosis now what are you going to do now what are you going to believe lord i went up for prayer i believed you were going to heal me i was anointed with all i kept the word i did exactly what you said was going to happen and now i got sicker well it must not have worked i guess i'll just ask the doctor for more pills no he's going to test you to find out if you believe your own confession do you believe i believe if i've got to go back to the doctor 100 times you're still going to heal me amen if i got to be sick 100 more days you're still going to heal me because you said so you've promised it i've kept your word so you're no longer jacob but israel for as a prince thou has power with god and with men and has prevailed sometimes we just have to endure and prevail with god brother venom said i know what it's we're talking about this story here and he was talking about jacob wrestling he says i know what it's like to wrestle with god i've done it many a time myself praise the lord brother branham had to wrestle it out but his faith prevailed i want to look at second kings if we could just skip over a couple books to the right to second kings chapter two let's pop over here and have a quick look at something i remember under ruth deciding she had to make her decision she had to operate by faith and she had to be steadfast-minded but she was going to go into four stages of restoration first his decision then serving then resting then rewarded but i want to look at a similar thing over here in second kings 2 verse 1. and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah unto heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went into bethlehem so here we're coming to the the same thing now you have to realize when we get here that elijah has already been told by god to anoint elisha to be prophet in his room in his place and he's already walked by him when he was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen and thrown the mantle over him and then elisha left and his father and mother he come to follow elijah so elisha is ordained to be the prophet instead of elijah he's the right one amen it's already spoken by an angel elijah knows elijah's already called him already threw the mantle on him to call him into the ministry now he comes in but now elisha's going to go through his testing time and elijah says i'm there in gilgal and he says i'm going to go to bethel you stay here now elijah has been the master the whole time get this elijah is the master elijah's the boss elisha's the servant elisha is the one who pours water on his hands he serves elijah when elijah says go he goes light says come he comes now elijah says you stay here elisha says not on your life as we read it we're going to find out why as we move down through verse 3 and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace elisha knew that god was going to take elijah and elisha was not going to separate from elijah no matter what elijah said ruth was not going to separate from naomi no matter what naomi says naomi's been the mother-in-law naomi's called the shots naomi told the girls hey you're fixing dinner tonight hey i want you to do the dishes and now now the same one who's been the matriarch of the home the same one who's called the shots in the home now is saying go back to your mother and say no then try it again so go back to your mother and and orpha says okay and ruth says no praise god you got to realize there's something in a believer that's different than the rest of the world there's something in a believer that reflects back the very nature of god to god and god wants to see it and if god's got to try to shake you off a little bit he'll try to shake you off a little bit just like jesus did with the woman who had a sick daughter and she comes up she's a gentile woman comes to the table stands behind the lord says lord will you heal my daughter and he ignores her as though she had not spoken orpah would have left say well he doesn't want to talk to me i prayed but i didn't hear anything back i went to the church that day and i said lord would you speak to me through that preacher so i know it you and i didn't hear one thing i guess it's not for me i'll go back but that woman didn't give up she said again lord would you heal my daughter and he looked at her and he says it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs he ignored her then called her a gentile dog and said i can't do it it's not good for me to give you the meat orpah would have been long gone now here comes a ruth test here comes an elisha test i'm not supposed to give you this bread it's not good for me to give you what belongs to the children to dogs he says yay lord i'm a dog but even the dogs get the scraps that fall the crumbs that fall from the master's table and jesus was so blessed by her faith that he healed her daughter what's he looking for this kind of faith this persistent wrestling with the lord himself to overcome to have power with god and man and prevail that's what he's looking for you wonder why sometimes you pray and it goes the opposite direction because you've got to prevail you've got to hold on amen it feels like he's taking 100 miles an hour around the curve and you're hanging on to dear life and it's just your fingertips just holding on to the car door and what's he trying to do to see if you'll hang on amen are you persistent are you persevering do you believe are you here for the benefits are you here for the friendships are you here for the camaraderie or are you here for christ [Applause] you're here because i'll get a good family out of there are you here because i'm looking for a good spouse why are you here with christ why is it for benefits or what if you say you're never going to get married you're never going to have a husband you're never going to have children it's never going to work out what do you want to do i'll go back ruth says where you die i'll die if i have nothing i have if you have nothing i have nothing i'm going where you're going now we come to elijah and elijah and elijah's going to be taken up and it's testing time for elisha and elisha is a type of the bride verse 4 and elijah said unto him to elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord saith unto me to jericho the lord sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho it came to the point where elijah couldn't fight elisha okay if you want to come come it come to the point where naomi couldn't fight ruth it's come to the point where christ can't fight his own bride he can't shake her off because she believes no matter how many wins no matter how many times she shakes she's still there she believes now how many times things go wrong she's still there she believes verse five and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him knoweth thou that thy lord will take away thy master from the head i mean it gets worse for elisha elijah says go away elisha already knows elijah's gonna be taken away elijah says you get away amen and then they go from gilgal to bethel and then all the preachers out of beth will come and says you know the lord's going to i know i know i know leave me alone then they go from bethel and he says i'm you stay here in bethel i'm going down to jericho amen you stay behind he says no i'm not going to leave thee amen and so before they leave all the preachers amen and bethel come up and say hey you know you know that that i know i know hush leave me alone god's going to make sure there's plenty of people to tell you it's not going to work plenty of people to confirm what the lord's already trying to do the lord is trying to shake you off trying to get to get you to see if you're going to hold on to your faith to believe it or not and all of a sudden you're sick another week you're sick another month and then everybody in the church has a herbal concoction for you everybody's got a home remedy or a method or a certain doctor or somebody amen and all the preachers start coming along amen not that that's not good and not that god can't help you that way but god's gonna lead you by faith by faith and if there's a vitamin or a supplement that will help god will lead you by faith not by experiment so now everybody's going to come up and you need this and you need that and you need this and you walk out of church with bag loads of stuff that you need and sometimes you just need to shake it off and believe the first thing he dropped in your heart that by his stripes i am healed and if god gonna lead me somewhere through a doctor's end of medicine god's going to lead me there amen we're not against doctors we're for them but in their place by faith led of the lord by faith elisha goes along and now now not only does he have elijah against him now all the prophets are telling the same thing elijah says stay behind i'm not going to lay behind he comes over and says you know that he's going to go would you all leave me alone i believe the word i'm staying right here so he goes to jericho he says yes i know it hold your peace verse 6. and elijah said in them terry i pray thee hear for the lord has sent me to jordan. now he's saying terry i pray he's saying would you please stay here what are you going to do elijah's always been the boss would you please stay here elijah said unto them terry i pray there pray thee three here for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they too went on and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they too stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the water and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked now behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten in the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over they had a perfect a perfect testing ground for elisha the bride elijah says i'm in gilgal but i'm going from gilgal we're going from justification to sanctification we're going to see there's four stages in this journey just like there's four stages in ruth just like there's four stages of the restoration amen four stages of deliverance i'm in gilgal but i'm going to bethel you stay i'm not staying i'm going with you we go to bethel the lord sent me to jericho you stay behind i'm not staying behind as the lord liveth i will not leave thee then we're in bethel but we're going to go to jericho stay behind i will not stay behind i'm going where you're going then he says and jericho i'm going to jordan stage four i'm going to jordan i pray thee would you please stay here he says as the lord liveth i will not leave thee elisha is going to go all the way through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and is going to cross jordan supernaturally separated out alone with elijah to receive her commission amen they get separated out they went behind the veil of the jordan river they're beyond the veil where nobody else is there but them too no school of the prophets nothing else because the holy ghost made a way for the baptist holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself and now they cross the veil of jordan and went into the secret chamber and now he says if you see me go ask what you will that's what elisha was looking for the whole time for the commission for the promise for the mantle to fall what mantle the mantle that covered the holy ghost that covered elijah for that same mantle to fall back on elijah there was already a promise when he called him he threw the mantle over his shoulders amen but now he's looking for it across the veil he goes to jordan he says you see me go up that's what you really says i want a double portion what do you think the bride gets when the capstone comes with shoutings of grace grace you've got double grace there's a double portion coming to the bride and now now the mantle falls he goes back now the elisha ministry now the bride goes back to jordan and says where is the god of elijah with that mantle smacks the water and it parts and it crosses on dry land see you've got to go through the four stages and not get shucked off anywhere won't you stay here in justification i'm not staying in justification i'm going to sanctificate i want you to stay in sanctification you got a clean lie if you've cleaned up your life just stay i'm not staying in sanctification i'm going to the baptism holy ghost well now you've got gifts in your life you've got tingly sensations you felt the presence of the lord want you to stay there i'm not staying there i want he himself amen i don't want his gifts amen i don't want just his gifts i don't want just his friends i want he himself hallelujah and ruth wasn't willing to stay behind in moab wasn't willing to go back where you go i'll go where you live i'll live will you die i'll die your god shall be my god nothing but death shall separate us when naomi saw that she was steadfastly minded she left off trying to convince her comes a time where god realizes we're steadfastly minded we've got to be willing to go through the test we've got to be willing to endure we've got to be willing for somebody to try to shake us off the devil ever come to you and said you know it's probably not for you you ever have thoughts that come and says well you must not be elect what's what kind of response is god looking for yeah you're probably right no whatever i'm going on [Applause] [Laughter] it'll never work for you you're probably never going to get what they got whatever i'm going anyways nothing shall separate me nothing shall stop me i'll believe this message to my dying breath and whatever god reveals i'll accept it and i'll walk it and i'll stay in it until op but death separate me from this life of believing this word that's what god's looking for friends that was ruth in her first phase her deciding it wasn't an easy thing it wasn't a quick decision it was a real decision based off faith and she committed and when she committed she moved into the land praise the lord we didn't get nowhere but we went a lot of places let's all stand man we love you all it's good to be home it's good to be back we love you all so much i think lord willing will probably continue on with ruth on wednesday so be praying i mean we still have ruth serving ruth resting ruth rewarded and i was super excited about getting me into more of it today but we'll get into it god bless you don't let nothing shake you off of this word don't don't let circumstances or doubts or fears or worries shake you off with this word if you've not gotten to the place that you want to be just hang on amen just refuse refuse to be denied refuse to give it up if you see it in the word and you know that it's true then hang on to it for dear life and refuse to give it over amen and it doesn't matter who says what to you amen it doesn't matter what the school of the prophets are saying it doesn't matter i'm going to stay with it until until what until this word comes to pass in my life because that's what the bride is doing for the translation of the body there's a promise that our atoms are going to change amen and it doesn't matter how many times we try to get shook off of that promise my atoms are going to change and i'm going to hold on to it and stay with it and confess it and believe it until not until the next obstacle not until i get shook off but until my atoms change hold on until i'm healed hold on until i'm delivered hold on until this promise that's promised to me by my god is come to pass in my life there's no quitting no turning back i say thank god ruth had something that ruth didn't put there elisha had something that elisha didn't put there the gentile woman that come behind the table of jesus and disciples she had something that she didn't put there cornelius had something that he didn't put there he had something that was there before the foundation of the world and it's only that seed that has the ability to hold on to the word it's not you and i it's not these hands it's not this mind it's not our willpower but there's something in us that will not be denied amen because it's part of the word and it's believing the word and it'll believe despite all it'll believe how many believes how many is going to lose a few fingernails holding on amen let my scars in heaven amen maybe it won't be stoning or battling from a lion and in the coliseum but maybe my scars are chipped fingernails from holding on to the promise when god himself was trying to jerk it out of my hands you mean god would do that absolutely god would do that when god himself would try to snatch it from me jerk it from my hand what's he want to see he wants to see what you got what you're made of if you reflect his character and you hold on to it and your fingernails are going to be a mess when you get on the other side but you're going to be on the other side praise god let's just pray the heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word we ask god that you would just lord make it more than a sermon lord more than a talk lord make it our life give us lord within us raise up what's in us lord that tenacity lord that determination that that that comes from deep within to say it's mine i know it's mine i know it belongs to me and i will have it oh god we thank you god for your promises we thank you for what you showed us in your word and now god we want to be faithful to live it all through every test and trial strengthen us lord anoint us to the work pour out that double portion upon us lord that we might make this word live make it live in our lives make it manifest itself through us we give you our lives we love you lord let us go carrying this torch into the world let us be a beacon and a light into a dark world we love you almighty god we trust in you and thank you for your word have three minutes in us have your way in us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you can we sing that song i will not be denied let's sing that song i feel like saying that right now i will not be denied i will not be denied amen why because i'm lusting for it with a human lust absolutely not that'll fail but by revelation it's in god's word it's a promise i'm part of that word it's got to be mine it's got to come to manifest i have to be part of it he's got and if he hasn't filled me with the holy ghost yet he's got to why because i've been baptized in his name i've repented for my sins i believed his word repented from my sin been baptized in his name and it hasn't happened yet it has to happen because i believe it's for me that's what he's looking for friends i'm gonna sing the song together as you [Music] dismissed [Music] till jesus i would not till jesus came and he made me [Music] occurring [Applause] not is denied till jesus satan said my lord was gone and he would not hear my prayers is till jesus oh satan said my lord was lord gone work is done in christ the lord is [Music] is again praise the lord when kings of death seize on my soul unto the lord i cried till jesus came and he made it till jesus
