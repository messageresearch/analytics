[0:00] you know that Samson gave all his
[0:04] strength to God but he wouldn't give his
[0:07] heart God is only trying to find one
[0:12] person he can get in his hands he has
[0:16] always tried to do that you notice all
[0:19] down through the Bible when we find we
[0:22] found in Isaiah when we found a Jeremiah
[0:25] then we found a Samson one day but
[0:27] Samson gave his strength to God but he
[0:30] gave his heart to Delilah see you've got
[0:34] to give your all to God your reverence
[0:37] your respects you're everything that you
[0:41] are just be nothing just see how little
[0:45] you are and that's what God wants us to
[0:51] do God's not looking for you to do
[0:54] anything great and big in the eyes of
[0:57] the world did you know that I have
[1:00] struggled with that my whole life I've
[1:02] told the kids I've had a okay you know
[1:05] brother brother Chad said the other day
[1:07] he said you know what a pastor told him
[1:09] he struggled with something it wasn't
[1:10] until he confessed it that it broke I
[1:13] told the kids and brother Gabe was there
[1:14] too I said my whole life I have never
[1:17] felt that I had anything to offer I have
[1:20] struggled with that complex very much I
[1:22] thought there was no value to me and you
[1:25] know what I did from a complex I went
[1:28] out to try to prove my value value to
[1:30] this
[1:31] world I have had success in business and
[1:35] I went out and I would buy houses and
[1:37] you know what with every one of those
[1:38] houses I felt a little better about
[1:40] myself because there was an Evidence of
[1:42] my value and it was all in vain
[1:48] right and it meant
[1:53] nothing because I was already
[1:57] valued I was already a son what more
[2:00] value do I
[2:02] need what more do I need in this natural
[2:04] life than to see the grace of God come
[2:07] my way and reveal to me that I'm a part
[2:09] of him you're a part of him what do you
[2:12] have to prove from this point
[2:14] on you're a son or a daughter of
[2:16] almighty God there's nothing to prove to
[2:19] anybody but often times we do things out
[2:22] of our own complexes we try to cover we
[2:25] don't want the pain of letting a complex
[2:29] be dealt
[2:31] with often times we all do this in our
[2:34] own ways and guess what you all have
[2:36] complexes and don't you act like you
[2:38] don't if you believe the message of God
[2:40] and the prophet of God he said we all
[2:42] got them sir and we all got them I got
[2:45] them
[2:46] too and it's been one of those things
[2:48] I've fought with my whole life and God
[2:51] in his Mercy I believe will help me I
[2:53] believe he's helping me even now
