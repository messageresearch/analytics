one father you decided to use a human being so i make myself available so you can use me this morning have preeminence take control of everything father speak to us how we are waiting upon you you say those weight upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount out with wings wings as an ego give us that mountain power this morning as we asking this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen all right we will take a a a small subject nothing new same thing but say it with my own words so uh pray that it will be a blessing to you uh very familiar scripture we're gonna read is mark 11. uh we will just read it from uh verse 20. you can read the whole thing at home mark 11 okay and in the morning as they passed by they saw that fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remember and say unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursed is withered away and jesus answered unto them have faith in god for very i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen may god bless the reading of the word you may take your seeds so um i would like to to take a part two of my message the last time which was seeking and manifesting god's attributes i want to just call it the part two and this time i want to say give it a subtitle last time we focus on the judge who has come in a cloud is among us we can go to him with any issue and is more than able to judge our enemy amen so um is the fair judge a judge with fairness and his attributes we need we need them so we can also have this the judgment that god has we can have the discernment and so but this morning i want to take a different angle with the same message this time i call the subtitle god's eyes god's faith now you see what i'm i mean by that um god sees think differently from us we see things because we are human we have a feeling of love we have care of life there are so many things that makes us see things the way we see them but as we maturing in god's knowledge then we start thinking things a little differently and we see things the way godzilla thinks and is very important so that's what we're trying to say to this morning so let uh i took this scripture for a reason because um i'm talking about god's eyes and god faith so when you go into the translation of the bible the place that we just read if you look when he say that jesus answer and say unto them have faith in god the true translations actually say have the faith of god seems to be the same thing but it's not the same thing have the faith of god when god says something he believes it if he say let there be light there gonna be light no matter how long it's going to take he say that he believes it amen now talks about a greek man or a greek priest who came to his meeting in the message all things he say i thought this morning that the little greek priest that was with us in the fellowship breakfast uh what a wonderful little character and kind of uh sick kind of seeking after deep experience i've got another lolo greek priest that was led to christ through the tapes his father is a greek orthodox teacher a highly estimated man in greece he came over here to finish his education got a hold of one of the tapes and at first he criticized it that's how we start you know until the hook you start by doing that so um and then he came and was baptized and received the holy ghost and he said brother branham i know that you don't know greek because i understand you don't know you don't know very good english welcome to my world but say if anybody who really knows greek and is a greek scholar say the continue to continuity of your talk with greece is absolutely perfect putting the scriptures together that's why he was battered oversee he said it's a phenomenal and just knowing you don't know it but the way you put your scriptures together the continuity of your scripture runs in the greek it's not the knowledge of the greek or the hebrews but is the the sword the king's sword in his hands make the world come out together amen amen praise god so even this scripture that i just read when i say god have faith in god actually the translation is have the faith of god or have god's faith brother pranam talks about it amen if you read the message you see uh that he talks about that he say god's fate he said there is only one faith is god's faith amen and it could put all these things together because a prophet is a revealer of this written word that's why we don't argue with him because that's his duty that's what god predestinated him to do so and you can see in other places like uh when you look at john chapter 8 18 4 jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and say unto them who seek ye they answer him jesus of nazareth jesus said unto them i am he and judas also which betray him stood with them as soon as they had he had say unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground but the true translation of this is not that he say i am he the true translation is i am so he is telling this uh judas that came to betray him this saudis this priest that came in presence of god who are you looking for they say jesus of nazareth is say ah yem the same who spoke to moses tell them i am send me is standing here and you come with all your arrogance in front of me when you say i am they went on the floor but john did not need to do that john when he saw him he went on a floor he went on the ground he went to his knees because the bride is humble the bride recognized him she's on an on she is in all of him when she sees him amen but these people god has to tell them go to your knees you are in the presence of god and he say to them i am and you can see brother branham later saying that the i am in the old testament jehovah is jesus in the new testament translation of the bible thank god for a prophet amen yes that's what he says he say actually i am and they go down so we go back to this message have faith in god look at god eyes and god faith you see when god says something he believes in what he says it will happen no matter what so he rests upon what he says he believes what he says and his prophet actually when they speak they speak in present tense because their god lives in eternity where everything is present and you can see in isaiah 9 you can see that for unto us a child is born right now like if you go into hospital you will find that child because they're living in the eternity they see the cup full before even he get there so they will announce that it is a done deal now before even he gets there because god sees the end before the beginning for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace let's read content for the faith 1955 brother by name says jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom you can't understand it it's mystic and medical mythical think until you're born again there the very life of god comes in everlasting everlasting eternal life zoe god's own life comes in you and then you are part of god you are a son of god and or a daughter of god and then you see as god sees amen you believe how the god believes then you are a new creature in christ jesus the lord bless you now so you see and when he say sick it's not an effort a desire seek god's attribute and manifest those attributes one of them is to see things see means understanding but it's not intellectual understanding but because the things of god are spiritual amen we compare spiritual things with spiritual as we heard last sunday and therefore only spiritual will see it will understand them and god as we are maturing as we getting his word constantly constantly then we start seeing things like god because he has made us small gods anyway is that right yes you believe as god believed but we got to seek it was we seek it it did it doesn't mean we making an effort because all the potential is already in us is it just to show him a strong desire because we love him so much and he doesn't like things like a formality yeah if you give me it's okay if you don't give me it's all right but he want us to uh mean business and the work of preachers is to bring those things up and tell people sometime because sometimes we get a little lazy sometimes we kind of forgot and god sent the preacher to just remind us and seek god with all your strength amen and as you're doing it's all the green things start disappearing and when you look back because you know christian life is sometimes you look back you know i can say that because i'm old man i look back and say oh i made the right decision you look back yes he was good that i gave all my life to him i dedicate myself now i used to see things differently it exchanged i used to look at people differently i used to judge people differently i write off people like like left and right say this one that one but now when i look back he changed me now i see things differently meaning i discern things differently hallelujah and that's what we're talking about amen expectation 55. do you realize that the very earth that you are sitting over tonight is nothing more than the word of god did you know god made the world out of his own spoken word if you did where did he get the material he said let there be and it materialized and made a world let there be and there was light let there be and he believed his own word and his own word brought the earth into creation he made the world out of things which was not and does not appear yet he made the earth that you are sitting over tonight in a gra in a human mind everything that is of value is things that we can touch and feel but that is not a reality for god because out of nothing god created the material that we see and the kingdom of god is made of things that we cannot touch it's not tangible like love like a passion but i used to say uh give me uh some money i mean i want to go to let me say walmart and buy some love you can't because but that's the reality that's what made the world that things that we see was made with things that we don't see and therefore we're gonna give more up importance to things that are not tangible we cannot just do it by saying it but we will mean it because god in us will be seeing through our eyes brother burnham says that he thinks your thoughts he takes he use even your temperament hallelujah if you give it to him hallelujah 63 door in a door the fate you know the real genuine fate of god you see it translates in greek the real genuine faith of god will punctuate every promise of god with an amen a genuine holy ghost because why the holy ghost wrote the bible it says so man of old moved by the holy ghost wrote the bible see then how could the holy ghost be in you and deny it can do it amen all right i'll continue again um in the message in the message works it's a fake express he say this and he promised you the same thing that is if you could believe that that will happen if you can't believe it it won't happen now i can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe god got to give it to you it's a gift of god to believe not your faith god's faith then god when he say there is an intellectual faith intellectual conception but god can give you his faith you start with the intellectual one it's like a faith but then god gives you his faith and but i'm saying keep going keep asking keep seeking then he give you is is but it's not like you made effort the thing is in you it makes you sick are you with me just like a chicken small chicken in a shell and when god said the time to go out is here demolition time and the chicken will just hit that shell here but i'm saying don't help it because if you help it you start removing some portion of the shell that chicken will die but god has put that in his mind to get out that's why he's seeking to go out amen and god says seek the seek me like you seek money for money oh we we do we do shame we do because there is material then we we put all our strength in it and with all our efforts in it and then when god says seek me that's not tangible well we don't do that we should not do that i should not do that god help me your intellectual faith my my uh believe it fine but unless the faith of god is down in your heart see your intellect your faith can accept it do that and just keep believing it with all your heart until god reveal it to you keep just believing keep just taking in the word that intellectual faith will become god's faith to believe all his words is so critical because when you believe god's word not in intellectual way but god's way no one can take it from you people will fall left and right situation will happen even if you hear that uh this great brother has done this something has happened to them yes you're gonna feel bad but yet you won't be moved no matter who comes or goes you will not be moved because you have god's faith in his word hallelujah is important we're living in a time that is very difficult we live in a time where demons are out 200 million of them really just ran many things can happen can happen to anybody but you need god's faith to stick to keep going you cannot young people you cannot say brothers this and that happened to him keep going if you have god's faith keep going amen he will make you to keep going amen oh my do you love him god's faith that's the only faith that actually exists it's uh it's uh it's called revelation that's what it's called what is the revelation i will give you my definition it is a glance into god's mind and god show you and say that's a revelation and everyone need it it's something it's god telling you in your heart this is the truth this word is the truth somewhere down there you cannot explain it but it tells you and that's why we are seeking for young people we say the religion of your father mother has to become your religion and for that to happen you got to have god's faith a revelation which is a glimpse into god's mind with a whip god allows you to peek inside his mind hallelujah amen it may not come with a sensation he may come with sensation body gotta be as strong faith in god you just know it no one can take it from you it's very important because the seven seals have revealed who christ is but they also have given us a look into the devil's work and none of his work is hidden now all his purpose as the pastor says it often here all the devil purpose when he is getting to you to give you sickness and depression and all this all he's trying to do is to get to your soul so that you can reject the word or you can become indifferent god give us that revelation that the peak in inside your mind oh my and then nothing that comes to me you know but every time we're very specific when you say no matter what it keeps saying no matter what stay with the world no matter what really there are so many things happening in life i'm telling you that to be an old man i can tell you that things happen in life but he said no matter what stay with the world stay with the world amen hallelujah you will never regret that decision there are many decisions that we made in life we will look back and regret not that one not with that one to recognize the message of your time and give all your heart you will never regret that hallelujah the devil he's oh my i'm gonna attack him now hallelujah hey man no matter what he attacks me i'm telling you sometime i punch him so hard so hard oh praise god amen the potential is here for you to have the eyes of god the potential is in you i'm just reminding you what you already have amen praise god amen amen oh my let's take a peek into other believers mind to see where they stand whether but i'm always preached with characters in the bible amen somebody criticized him he felt it but that's the way god made him you know let's look at peter's confession i wrote it this down john chapter 21 you know that we read it last sunday here i guess john 21 15. so when they had dying jesus said to simon peter simon son of jonas lovers doubt me more than this you say unto him yeah lord thou knowest that i love thee he said unto him feed my lambs you say unto him again the second time simon's son of jonas loveth thou me he say unto him yeah lord thou knowest that i love thee you say unto him feed my sheep verse 7 17 he said unto him the third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love has doubted me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus say unto him feed my sheep i want to take that character you know just a little bit of drama you know jesus look at peter everybody's there and he said to peter uh peter do you love me more than all these others peter said yep and then he say the second time peter loved that love that me more than others and peter said sure sure yeah i love you but when he say the third time peter now attention he he attracts his attention just like the prophet we constantly are distracted and the prophet will say before we start the line of prayer i take all spirits under my control in the name of the lord jesus christ amen now i need god to come down and speak to this man love thou may peter at that point he got into piercing because that's me speaking now it's like at the beginning it was just his body his flesh then he repeatedly again he goes into his mind yes you know i love you intellectual conception yeah i love you yeah then peter do you love me at that point peter is going to give an answer that says that lord you are the word amen and the word is like a double edged sword it discerned the thoughts and the intent of the heart even if i say it with my lips but you can go inside me and see that there's there is an eternal seed in me i love you you know it because you place that seed in me now this is not peter just answering in an intellectual way we just had a peek inside as a peer soul and this is peter pouring out his heart to the lord and say to him you know everything recognizing that god knows everything recognizing that the word jesus christ is a discerner of the thought and the intent of heart and nothing can be hidden from him is that right and that was the first message that the angel gave to brother branham he said god tell people that their thoughts are speaking louder they speak louder than the words this is the confession that peter had was the word is a discerner of the thoughts what can i hide from you lord amen are you with me amen oh hebrews 4 for the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two-aged sword preaching even to the dividing ascender of soul and spirit and the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intent of the heart we just look inside peter's heart deep inside him now he's speaking it's not just intellectual discourse this is speaking from the bottom of his heart the words discern the thoughts and the intent therefore i cannot hide from him anything therefore i will go myself to him i don't need god to twist my arm to force me but i will just go to him because i love him very much amen do you understand church does he make sense i will know only when i hear amen somewhere amen hallelujah and i used to preach constantly i knew monday will be a bad day for me because sunday i really beat him you know oh my praise god another confession the greek woman's confession matthew 15 22 and behold a woman of canon came out of the same course and cry unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously a vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciple came and besotted him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said unto and said i'm not sent unto the lost ship of the house of israel the first time the woman said to him we know the story we know how brother branham put it we know that the woman calls him son of david because she heard people saying son of david it was just what she heard other people saying and she just repeated son of david be merciful to me and then jesus did not answer her then when he said i'm not sent to uh i'm only sent to the house of israel then he learned she learned that her doctrine was wrong so she's she somebody said to her don't call him son of david call him the lord they came verse matthew 15 25 then came she and worshiped him saying lord help me but he answered and say it's not meat to take the children bread and to cast it to dogs so this is the third time that is happening this woman is persistent and she's changing the way the first time she says um son of david and somebody maybe have said oh call him lord because that's uh the doctrine she heard it and she repeated lord and jesus want to make sure she means business because all that was maybe something she heard other people saying and she and jesus said to her the last thing that will make her to be discouraged and say that it's not me to take the children bread and to cast it to dogs and this is her confession the greatest thing in this confession is when she say truth lord because the truth lord means that whatever you just said i don't understand it i don't know what it is but it is the truth so the confession of this woman is the word is always the truth no matter if i don't understand it no matter how if it doesn't make sense the word is always the truth that's a powerful church i don't understand it it doesn't make sense to me to because dog but it is it must be the truth i remember going to church with some friends bringing them to church when i found the message all the message found me i brought some friends to church they did not know where we were going and we got to church and they saw people they sit in a church the minister preached about the the throne of god in revelation after the service this my friends say i did not understand anything but it was the truth amen i didn't understand anything but it was the truth he said because the word is not an intellectual thing it's as it's a spiritual that you discern it so today we cannot be apologizing for brother branham say this but here he say that and here he say this we can't i don't understand why it placed things the way it plays but we cannot apologize for it because the truth is the truth even if we don't understand it amen root confession uh i think you get it now as you can see ruth is coming with her mother in law naomi the it's a movement that everybody is talking about going to palestine and it was like a movement but yet after a naomi speaks to her daughter in law about uh if you go to palestine i don't have children for you to marry i don't have anybody of age that can take you as wives she start laying in front of them all the obstacles that come in a christian's life and when they saw this then orpah decided that i can't keep going she was a borderline christian so she he could go with the word to a certain point but look ruth did not have anything that she could put her hands on she did not know where they're going what house they gonna have where they're gonna sit where they're gonna be living but she declared that thy people shall be my people look a root said in trade me not to leave thee and to return from following after thee for wither thou goes i will go whether thou lodges our lords thy people shall be my people and thy god my god hallelujah oops sorry now i just wanted to to take that subject and and again show a pattern of when you look at all these characters that we have in the bible it looks like at the end at the at the end at the third portion the portion of god because there is the body there is the spirit and the soul and at the third level we can see exactly what is inside these people what is actually move these people there is a confession of the life what they truly believe that's what we see and we see it at the third time we see the woman we see the greek woman she first says the son of david that was the first then she says the lord then she will make a confession that comes deep from her heart and that's what she really is because god is not really interested in the formality what we say because somebody else said but he want to read what is inside us amen the reality how we look how we look at god what what is our view about him are you with me discernment of the body of the lord 1959 and now our eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see and what we hear but is determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear come in the church and hearing the word the way we hear it and just go back and say well it's okay i've been there they preach they preach just like us and it's the same thing but the prophet says that our eternal destination is not determined by what we see but but the discernment we have about what we see and what we hear it's about the discernment and see things the way god sees them hallelujah i want to turn a little bit a different gear the other day i was thinking to a message i want to give my message titled end of doctrines and i said okay end of doctrines then i uh i said this one i was thinking that this one will have a lot of disclaimers and of doctrines ah everything we do is doctrines but i'm talking about the fight for doctrines so it just came to me that i want to talk about the end of doctrines because doctrines are part of church ages they are part of cycles it's just me trying to express something and then i came to church on sunday and i heard a pastor saying the seventh seal is not a doctrine oh so i was not that far off end of doctrines you see ah luke chapter 18 says that when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on earth is not finding doctrines it's not finding good behavior but is to find faith what faith the faith of god and the faith of god recognized the message of your time and his hour it makes end to doctrines why why can i say that is because when you recognize him when he comes then he is the one who will adjust your doctrine therefore the problem is to recognize him first therefore the seventh seal is the seventh seal is not the doctrine he's a person he comes you recognize him and when you recognize him he starts adjusting your doctrines you recognize him receive his word manifest his word then there is no doctrine what that means we can't fight about doctrines because we recognize him and he say when the son of man cometh will he find faith that's what the most important what faith now we know is the fate of god and that's what matters because you will see as we reading that everyone had a doctrine and jesus when he came he was not he was not like what is your doctrine are you a what a pharisee yes he never asked that is the problem is to recognize him recognize when he comes so today let me just say if you recognize him in the formation of his bride and you start manifesting his attribute there will be no fight about doctrines amen there will be no fight because he's going to adjust that fight he's going to adjust that doctrine i mean yeah you will tell me oh no brother when the squeeze comes and then we will have the same doctrine because brethren say that yeah in some way but you can be squeezed only if you are squeezable you gotta be in that [Music] fight you gotta be in the body to be squeezed out is that right yeah so therefore i this is the end of the dying world the end of the seals the end of the ages the end of everything a rocket has been blown out and a rocket open another rocket and another rocket and and there is the ushering of the millennium where are the doctrines it's the end we used to have we used to have we we used to but we come to the end now we gotta recognize him if you recognize him that he came and he is in the body that i have to manifest him i'm telling you there'll be no doctrines [Music] thank god the uh the pastor had an opening for me i could not miss that one the woman of the uh the woman at the well had a doctrine do you know that let's read john 4 the woman say unto him sir i perceive that art a prophet and then she start her doctrine okay she has a fight with the jews about the doctrine but what she did first was i recognized you are a prophet recognizing the message of your uh of your time that's what the son of man is looking for then the doctrine will be adjusted our father's worship in this mountain and he say that that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus say unto her woman well yeah this the question you asking is for the end time you know if we could update the answer but believe me we isha neither in the mountain nor yet in jerusalem worship the father he worship he worship he know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in this in spirit and the truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is the spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth he just adjusted corrected her doctrine but you know first it was up she has to recognize him when it comes can you imagine people say we are waiting for the squeeze to come and they don't recognize him when he come in the formation of the bride and the waiting for his squeeze see he did not say that he said when the son of man comes will he find faith it was about faith the faith of god in his word is that correcting the woman i won't go into the details of it but he said well in terms of doctrine i am more close to the jews because you know they were god chosen people and god give them some things to do and he he give them the tabernacle he give them the sacrifice and all that so but all the things actually were just types and shadows but the reality will come at the end when christ comes in is the formation the formation of this bride all the shadows and types are over so where are the doctrines well you could say to her like in this message the dedication because she's talking about temples she talks about mountains should we go to jerusalem or should we go to the mountain and the night and that night the lord came to this seer and the prophet nathan and say go tell my servant david see i like that in other words i admire his courage and his thoughts of me to build me a place but he say i have not dwell in house i have not have a place to stay when i come down to earth to look my people over you see i never complain that i don't have a place to stay yeah david the idea of building something to for me is good i appreciate it but i never asked you know and you say this i have had a place to stay even since i brought up israel i have not commanded any of the judges to build me a house of cedar but i have went from 10 to tent that's what i like i like to go from tenth to tenth now i put your spiritual you know mask now you know put your spiritual mask oh that was good that is that is not just about the form of it today no this is important no this is important i have to repeat that he say i never asked for a house all right i went from 10th to 10th okay let me do it again i went from 10th to 10th to 10 to 10 to 10 i'm happy with it i never asked for a temple are you with me i love and he said now brother bottom comment is that is not just about the form of it today it's not the form of it today is that what he's doing today god in formation of the bride going from 10th to 10th praise god amen i've went from 10 to 10 and never asked for a house well if you make a house it's okay it's still me in the house me in a tent temple amen hallelujah praise god i've went from ten to ten you know what about them say that [Music] in my father's domain there are many houses some houses have blue eyes green eyes brown eyes dark hair god house hallelujah you are the saint of god the house the woman had a doctrine about mountains temple christ say to her because she recognized him he said i'm going to correct your doctrine if we do believe in him in as he came in our time is going to correct all that the end of all doctrines that's what a chad's fault god has never in the way back 62 but ibn says god has never left himself without a witness and god had a witness in that day but his father hated this uh witness and his name was elijah the prophet and his mother hated this witness but yet it was god witness stood just the same god's always got a people somewhere that he can point to and and say that's it and i want to be among that number i'm sure we all want to be there it's the desire of every heart amen that's what god's looking for when he comes somebody recognize him and some somebody lives his life and whatever i'm saying i want to be there it's the end of doctrines we want to be among that number that god can say this is my people look at them they are an example of what i am they are reflecting my life in theirs they have surrendered their life and i am reflecting my life through the earth if i reflect christ's life you reflect christ's life these are the persons who reflect this the church to reflect there will be no fight for doctrines because the reality is here he is not a doctrine he is a person and his name is the word amen amen amen nicodemus doctrine i'm going with characters john 3 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night brother branham defended nicodemus for coming that night so he came anyway and when you come to jesus you don't go back the same and say unto him rabbi we know that art a teacher come from god and no man can come do these miracles that thou do as except god be with him but accept it it will be a problem political problem we cannot accept it but i came to tell you this and jesus answered him very very i say unto thee except a man be born again you cannot see the kingdom of god once again it brings him back to the faith of god god faith the revelation nicodemus you have a false doctrine you think that god thinks is a group thing you say we in our group in up in our synhendren with the pharisees we we believe that you are a teacher from god nicodemus that's a problem but i'm glad that you came now i'm gonna talk to you so you cannot walk with too many people this is an individual walk with god you are starting wrong it's good to have fellowship with one another but this is an individual walk with god [Music] nicodemus you need to be born again you need this message to become a personal revelation of god [Music] and that's the problem you have of course they had a long conversation where nicodem did not understand anything and jesus had a sense of humor to tell him you were a doctor in what and you don't know these things he didn't say that sorry but yeah it did the right thing church i'm going back to say if we recognize the word that came in our time we reflect that word all the arguments and things will disappear nathaniel doctrines was a very simple one nothing can come up nothing can come out of another church like nazareth if anything good come it will be us therefore who is preaching the doctrine we always preaching the christ as come in the formation of the bride do we know where he comes from what school is he from anything good must come from us it's an arrogant spirit i kind of say it sarcastically but that's the only humor maybe i missed when people were you know receiving good humor and i came late and they gave me some and that's what you hear john chapter 1 verse 45 philip findeth nathanael and say unto him we found him whom moses in the law and the prophet did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip said unto him come and see so he has already the doctrine but the problem is he has to recognize whom god sent at that time no matter what is doctrine he has to recognize the message and his time when in the time not to recognize when is past but now present time everything starts by faith faith of god and that the foundation the foundation of the house is faith in the word of god that god sent for you in your time do we agree jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nothing is say unto him whence taoists knowest doubt me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee nothing answered and said unto him rabbi thou are the son of god thou art the king of israel doctrines god something good can come from nazareth i heard the word even there her word has answered my question oh my amen do we agree amen maybe we will stop those things is the end of christianity i come from a pentecostal background when i left we we bought with us the pentecostal luggage in the message boom we start repeating the same thing and the cycle is still going until when we got to stop that it's over when he say that it's the end of the church ages the end of this the end of vows the end of this the end of that even the ushering into the millennium would you know what is ushering is well the wedding is starting the ashes are ushering he said waiting there or not the ushering so basically it's telling us that christ came in the name of sons son of man son of god right son of man before he comes as son of david but now the prophet said this is everything that was stopping him from going into son of david is over is it ushering into the millennium it's going to switch and go to israel and tell us is already being assured in hallelujah is later than we think amen i want to take another one oh my the mistake sometimes we make david instruction to solomon first king two one now the days of david drew night that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments judgment and testimonies as it's written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and with wither with her so ever thou turn us thyself that the lord may continue his word with which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take yeed to the way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul they shall not fail thee say he a man on the throne of israel moreover thou knowest also the what joe joab the son of zeroia uh did to me and what it did to the two captains of the host of israel unto abner the son of nir and unto hamas amassa the son of jeter whom he slew and shed the blood of war and peace and put the blood of war upon his girl that was about his loins and his shoes that were on his feet what he's doing now is telling his son solomon i'm leaving but you will have to deal with people that i did not avenge from you will avenge me you will do this we'll do that and let's continue do the therefore according to that wisdom and let not his uh head go down to the grave in peace but show kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gilead gilead died and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother and behold that has with thee she may the son of gera a benjamite of ba huram which cursed me with grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanna him but he came down to meet me at jordan and i swear to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword now therefore hold him not the guitarness giftless for thou art a wise man knoweth and knoweth what taoist to do unto him but his head will bring thou down to the grave with blood so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david i want to just take a few moments here i'm winding down and i mean the subject is wrong but let's just say that but you see david was a war man he did his part what god called him to do and he turn and say solomon there is a second part okay and david what he did was uh secure israel get rid of the philistines and have the borders of israel well defined david place the word and separate the message with the denominations he made sure that we know the true baptism is in the name of the lord jesus christ that there is only one god his name is jesus christ he placed all the things the serpents seed and all the things that it clearly shows the difference between us and the denominations and you have no question if you come from a denomination you get there you know that there is a clear uh difference between where you come and where you ended up he did that then he turned to solomon and say solomon now go after the house of israel now we can establish good doctrine and good fences like that that is clear that we have the truth but we got to bring it home in the message community we cannot feel to tell the truth because love true love is corrective we gotta speak to ourself in a message community to tell each other the truth the world doesn't tell each other the truth you got to be correct this way that way but in in the message community we gotta tell the truth no matter what of course we tell it with love we tell us it for a good reason that no one is left behind like good marines that go into war you don't want anyone left behind we look inside ourself solomon i'm going but you turn to the house of israel and do a cleanup don't spare this don't spare that are you with me and that's the thing we do and when we do it is not arrogance it's not look at us we are this and that it is a true love of god no one is left behind you know maybe one day young people if the lord tarries when we say the lord terrorists that these bodies are not changed with it doesn't come now to take us home maybe one day you will look back and say because usually spiritual things usually you look back and see are you with me maybe you will look back and say one of the best things that happened to my church was the day we addressed the music issue it was a serious issue maybe some people get you know did not understand but that's the cleaning of the house of israel me i can say that because i can look back i can see people that we were baptized with where they are you know you two young people you may see that that something actually changed when the pastor spoke against the music of the world creeping in the message you know why because they it it has anointing yeah well some good songs get left off yeah yeah yeah i still need i still have my meat even if i chop something remove this i still have my meat you know you understand yeah something can go here and there that's not the point the point is to address that to address the music the world music then when you look back something happened because those things have anointing demon's power i heard a musician in a conductor of music classic music in boston saying that the music goes straight to the soul well i i never heard barbara i'm saying that but that seems to be right straight to the soul it give to you people this cold and different attitude it comes with an anointing it comes with a fashion and a way of singing a way of dressing the way of doing this it has anointing and when the world comes no matter how much the pastor has seek god faith and cry out and get some manna it doesn't do anything because what the anointing under which the children are therefore addressing that was critical amen i remember one time uh in a church where a a girl went to church when she thinks that i have to go to church because my parents would not let me stay home so she had her headset on her way to church i'm telling if she's listening to that music of the world is she comes with the anointing when the message is being preached okay she will go uh i'm not criticizing it go to the bathroom but staying long time you know and then come back and then when the church is over she puts back that's it what is it wiping out everything shared and inviting those demons have code and different demons to come again and you wonder why the message has no effect is the music somebody has to say it hallelujah somebody has to say it it's demon powers they're coming but they can't hide because the seals are open and i'm pointing that to the people and it's done in love no arrogance god has no arrogant spirit but he got to be saved praise god i heard the testimony but it's just a testimony i don't know but it could just be true because brother i'm talking about a demon spirit he knew it very well but he just talked about it in doctrinal way or teaching way but he's in you sometimes when he say don't do this young people don't do that don't wear those shoes like this he sees he could see the demons they followed him at home at the hotel where he slips they come sometimes they come like with chains sometimes they appear face to face with him you have no you have no power with god they tell him you have no power cold and different all that why are they telling him to discourage him yeah i heard the testimony let's say that one day brothers went to a hotel they spent the night at that hotel and they heard that it was in the time of brother branham that they heard this were in voices in that room but the pranam is my god they went to tell brother branham we were at the hotel room and we heard this but i'm saying the people that believes me to be jesus way in the room right well they create an atmosphere and the devil loves to live in those type of atmosphere that's why we cannot neglect the good atmosphere of what we say what we do it has spirits no it's not the legalism is the truth it's the opening of the word that tells us 200 million the demons are after the bride the way we fight back is with the world church i want to just say that solomon did a great job to clean up the house of israel of course it was killing this kill this one spare this one but it was old testament killing in old testament was to destroy anything that is contrary to the word of god but solomon forget the first instruction to walk in god's word so again the three things first of all david secured the borders of the message second thing he said solomon go after the message community all right and the third thing that solomon should do was to talk to come here amen he went after the house of israel but he has to come into this house his own house he forget that once we forget this is not outside there it is in us then you see where solomon ended up the women brought him back into idolatry i want to take a few minutes to talk about another cold and and different spirit the cleaning up that solomon did praise god it gave us courage to continue to speak the truth sometimes people can call it whatever they want to call it they can call it the legalism but somebody needs it somebody say god search me if there is anything in my life but taking those demon spirit this anointing from the young people maybe one day they will look back and say something changed since that time are you with me cold and indifferent to jezebel you know when we talk about jezebel we can see her need for power and domination we heard that and when we look at elijah we can see self-preservation all that when but we also know elijah as a spirit in a human being it was moody right so after it has destroyed all these 400 prophets iran and what i want to just look at it is uh that code and different spirits because we can see here and first king 19 and he have told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all uh all he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he rose and went for his life and came to bathsheba which belonged to judas and left his servant there so you can see that this moment words were powerful she was but i'm saying a woman is not made of iron it's a soft part but she did not care remember elijah has established the word by rebuilding the altar of god that was broken is that right then god vindicate the restoration of the word with a fire with wonders miracles and wonders and then it destroyed those prophets i'm telling you the cold spirit jezebel heard about that she was not moved she did not care well the fire came from heaven to vindicate the message she did not care cold and different spirit it's an anointing it can be in those music comes with fashion [Music] it comes in some ways something in the world and the model brother brandon look at the movie stars and say huh is says behind this is a woman that has been uh married and divorced married universe many times you place it in front of kids they think that's good because it's an anointing it makes them be like well as long as you just go to church it must be okay and different cold spirit she did not even look at anything that elijah did she swear by her gods that i will be dead if i don't kill that elijah no wonder elijah was oh my he ran because nothing moved her the fire that came from heaven did not move her and today sometime in our message community people try to look for miracles miracles don't change anybody the word changes miracles don't change anybody ask about the billy paul he talked about it with tears he saw kinds of miracles he saw the angel of the lord in the hotel room and he went back to the pillar of fire he saw it he was scared he didn't stop him from going to work in the world only the word changes the word transform the word makes us a new creature start with the word the miracles will follow action actually the miracles happen every day right the strange thing sometimes those miracles we cannot talk about it it has strength when barbarians say he will be private and all that now i start thinking that it may be that god does something for you but you cannot even share with people because it's involved this wonderful and then people say there is nothing happening happening her words created an atmosphere that's scary atmosphere our words create an atmosphere like i just said they were in the hotel they were worshiping the prophet worshiping the messenger instead of the message giving the heart to the message the one to worship the messenger it creates atmosphere what we say to in our homes and places have an atmosphere has spirits god help us the more we mature the more we get aware of that they we see things as god sees them it will not be legalism anymore it will be something we are aware of knowing what we know knowing i am a sons of god i am a prince from where i come from i'm conducting myself just with that awareness amen and now painted faced jezebel and now jezebel had threatened him and everything else well you say brother branham wait a minute before you leave jezebel that little woman may not have had a chance she was born a pagan she didn't have a chance yes she did too she had a pastor pastor elisha and elisha wasn't afraid to tell her about it don't think god always put the light there she just refused to walk in the light that was all right yes and she didn't want to call elijah her pastor certainly not she had one as a former dignified man for a pastor but god sent elijah to be her pastor no matter how much she hated him she hated him because the really religious jews was too straight for her that's why you hear today oh you are legalistic no you don't want the truth and that's why look very closely i'm going to talk to ministers now you know look when you see somebody rejecting the you usually they're rejecting you because you are an authority figure that showed them god all right so they start by attacking you then later on they will say i'm going to this church or whatever watch them after a few years they're back in the world what they actually reject was not the head the authority figure it was actually god it was his word i'm very tough today maybe i have a mentor of an evangelist today so well god has a diversity and he knows how to do things ah well i'm going to almost stop but i want to i want wanna oh god so much oh powerpoint presentation ah let me just talk about this one the lord solomon did everything right his father did his part he has to do his part but he forget to bring himself to the lord look out ourselves straight up at our self sometimes it can be a frightening experience because we will see things that we don't want to see right but the thing is you are not going there alone you go into the house you open the house for him you open the door for him so you are not alone when you open the door to him because because you love him and you want to reflect him you are not alone otherwise it will be a frightening experience but he is there but i'm going to preach this message many times door is in door in a different form i want to end with this now on the right hand side of the human heart when you walk into the door there is a little door on this right side and that's called in there the door of pride there may be different doors for everyone there is so many things there are doors for preachers preachers have to be careful with money women and popularity and is it they are traps when you're looking for it's hard to actually repent and say what i say was not right it's hard but god wants to not just have doctrines place the philistines are out this is the message this is what we preach that's good we clean up the house that's good now we bring it home to ourself and we go with him and we have to open that door he cannot do it for us are you with me lord just open the door and get in you're strong enough no because the prophet said the holy ghost is timid and he's a gentleman when he comes in your house even if you say make yourself a home you won't put his feet on your table is a gentleman so you got to guide him to the house the most frightening house the thing that you don't want to clean up the house you cannot say open east tells you will is timid you say you open but i am with you whatever we see there we're going to clean up oh my don't you go to enter that door they don't want the lord in there on that door that pride i'm a blue blood i take care oh yes now look i'll tell you see it's pride don't you mento in there now you can't feel welcome as long as you keep that bright door shut and this is is a is a demon of this age in this time god help me help help my brothers and sisters humble thyself and god will rest the way up is down we heard all that now we need to live it amen how can i overcome the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him oh he overcome for you he knows the way we don't he gave us all the potential the devices everything that we need the little chicken has the beak to hit that shell well is that an effort well depending if you think it's an effort it is but it's not it is something that is in that nature is god-provided way how can you get out you scream you cry you say lord i want the word vindicated in my life i'm actually quoting brother burnham somehow [Music] yes god provided way a child has to cry scream god help me seek god with all his heart is going to answer is going to change us seek him listen to his word submit yourself to his word the transformation will come lulu by lola you don't even know just like how i learn when i i learned english i did not know that i was learning i didn't know how to ask even direction wow it was such an adventure i don't want to bore you with it and then little by little i said oh i can hear brother branham speak whoa that's the benefit wow and little by little all the green things are gone and the the fruit is wipe out and you see like a god you deserve like him the humanity is there but he is dimming do you want that amen god bless you musicians you can come by the blake the thing to overcome i will just uh read what buddha bam says here in a very small character uh that i'm not displaying it like a little chicken it's being born you know if you ever notice one of the little fellows right on top of this little bacon any bird that's born from an egg it's got it's maturing this old eggshell the old inner part of the eggs has to to rot away and it has to take this little beak and scrap back and forth until it breaks the shell out we call it peeping it way out and down in kentucky where i come from peeping this way out they have never found a better way crying to him listening to the word pray listening to the word cry seek him god i want you more than my life god i love you god i want to live your life then it will never be a problem of doctrine anymore it's over the time of christianity is gone all the time of argument it's over christ is living in his dance hell some tents have blue eyes green eyes yes christ is living that's what you want to see that is purpose god give us the faith of god a real and only faith that exists give it that faith amen do we want to tell him that do can we sing lord i give you my heart i give you my soul and say it really in depth like like you know brother ben was telling us that we don't just have to sing the way we sing it got to be down deep in there we have to mean business that's why when we seek sicky we we just we want is meaning business it's like really i love you lord i truly love you i seek to have the attributes your attribute in my life i love you that's what we're trying to tell him can we sing that if he's ready change my heart oh god make it ever true change my heart oh god [Music] may i be like you one more time change my heart oh god make it ever true change my heart oh god may i be like i am the [Applause] hold me and make me this is what i pray change my heart oh god make it ever true [Music] may i be like you are the poor hold me and make me this is what i've made change my heart make it ever true heavenly father thank you thank you for bringing this little broken up message to your people father i pray that that can help them [Music] help me father you have a way of doing things you can feed the preacher and feed the people the same time [Music] you had something that you wanted to share with your people today heavenly father hopefully hopefully it was delivered to them now i place them in your hands oh god can you water your own seed in your people oh god let them really mean business when they come to you you don't appreciate formality but you appreciate reality the depth the deeper desire to serve you granted father answer the prayers be with them as they came to you this morning and no one that comes to you goes back the same so be merciful upon all of us we commit the pastor in your hands the people in the name of the lord jesus christ we prayed amen you may be we can stand up see i don't have a habit of preaching i don't know all those little things god bless you [Music] make it ever true [Music] change my heart oh god may i be like [Music] i am the clay this is change my heart oh god make it ever true [Music] change [Music] oh praise god i appreciate god's word i appreciate the leadership that our brother was under this morning and there's many things i've been thinking on the last few days and he was touching on them and and some things that i'm still meditating on god was just unlocking them for me and i said i love that i love god's way when it comes down to it when it's all said and done the revelation come to do one thing become the revelation come to give you a correct understanding and that correct understanding was meant to produce a life that comes from the inside out you know there's a lot of details that go with that we can talk about all the details there's a lot of doctrine and understanding and tying together loose ends and there's a big picture that was painted with all kinds of details and we can talk about all those details but the end result still has to come down to the same thing that god opened the seals to open the seals around our life so that we would know god and who we are in god and in understanding that it would bring a change from the within and we would begin to match what we saw and begin to live it if we miss the living part we miss the point we can catch the doctrine part but if it doesn't transform us from the inside out and begin to reflect the life of jesus christ then we've still missed the point i love what he was saying solomon was able to obey his father and root out the things out of the church but but there was nothing rooted out of solomon say god root me out of all self and selfishness and self desire self root it all out of me god so that i that i can reflect your heart your nature your life amen may the revelation come not to create arrogance not to create contention i mean what point would god come to open the seals to bring us tie together all the loose ends and bring the greatest revelation on the scripture that has ever been on the face of the earth and god would do that for contention and strife and arrogancy for separation and division amongst brethren no he did it to call the eagles up higher so that they wouldn't act like chickens anymore it's pretty disgraceful when eagles who were meant to fly and given a scream to call them up higher jump off the post and get back in the chicken yard again i said god root us out of there and keep us flying high and higher and higher till all the atmosphere to the world begins to fall away and keeps falling away i love the word i love when the word challenges me and i love when there's a cry inside of me and say that's what i want oh there's nothing like the preaching of the word delay a challenge right in your lap amen no matter how long you've been a believer no matter how long you've served the lord and believe this message then when the challenge is laid in our lap i mean we have a decision we can say well that's his opinion that preacher doesn't know what he's talking about or we can take the challenge and say oh god change me more and make me more like you and i love when the word brings a challenge and there's something inside that says lord i want that to challenge me and i want to be changed amen god is sure good to us well we're going to ask emma pris nick and her folks to make their way around back we're going to have her baptism in just a few minutes and we look forward to that we love it that god is still calling god is still seeking he's still calling he's still changing also i forgot to mention before that i was texting with brother emmanuel sabasu uh this morning he had a surgery actually it was yesterday morning saturday morning uh into the afternoon he had a surgery for have his appendix removed and when he came out of surgery he had a little bit of fluid on his lungs so they kept him
