[13:34] amen well I'd like to start the morning
[13:37] off with a special announcement I'd like
[13:40] to announce the birth of a new baby girl

[13:48] shorts
[13:49] into the world
[13:51] amen so we're so excited for them and

[13:56] birth of little riddenly now we've added
[13:58] to the assembly to parents
[14:00] four grandparents and a whole parcel to
[14:03] uncles
[14:06] so pray praise God for that it's an
[14:09] exciting time and we thank God for her
[14:11] safe delivery and that she's healthy not
[14:13] doing well and I was I was just
[14:15] meditating on that I thought my how a
[14:18] birth brings a dispensational change to
[14:20] so many
[14:21] and is the true in our lives spiritually
[14:23] too of birth brings a new title and with
[14:26] a new title will come a new
[14:27] manifestation
[14:29] we have parents who've never been
[14:30] parents before now it will manifest in
[14:32] their lives what Parenthood is for them
[14:34] how they display Parenthood for four
[14:38] individuals two sisters and two brothers
[14:41] it'll be Grandma and Grandpa and now
[14:43] there's going to come another
[14:44] manifestation in their lives with the
[14:46] new title and for these uncles we'll see
[14:49] how good they do amen
[14:52] but it's it's true in life and life you
[14:55] know the natural types of spiritual and
[14:57] for us amen a birth in our lives gave us
[15:00] a new title and then it's manifest what
[15:02] that title will be in us as we reflect
[15:05] that so it's exciting amen we're we
[15:07] thank God for what he's doing for their
[15:09] family and we rejoice in it amen I was
[15:13] wanting one one baby per month
[15:15] so far we're doing good but I don't know
[15:18] that we're going to get it this year but
[15:19] so far we're doing good and then also
[15:22] I'd like to say it's an exciting service
[15:24] because of the announcement but also at
[15:26] the end of service we're going to have a
[15:28] baptism we're going to baptize young
[15:30] Pippa Grillo in the name of the Lord
[15:32] Jesus Christ
[15:38] so we're very much looking forward to
[15:40] that as well amen I wanted to greet
[15:44] sister sabilla God bless your sisters
[15:46] Builder from Germany it's good to have
[15:48] her here she came in on Tuesday and I
[15:49] neglected the Greet her on Wednesday it
[15:51] was my fault but God bless you she'll be
[15:53] here for a couple of weeks so it's
[15:54] always good to have her visiting with us
[15:57] and as you know brother yatzik will be
[15:59] taking the service and ministering for
[16:01] us and so I've been very much looking
[16:02] forward to his visit we've had wonderful
[16:04] fellowship and I'm looking forward to
[16:06] the word amen God is so good to us
[16:09] because brother yatzik is here it
[16:12] afforded me the privilege of waking up
[16:14] at 3am and watching the funeral service
[16:17] for brother Gideon ratif and and it was
[16:19] quite a blessing and so just be
[16:21] remembering that assembly his family you
[16:25] know the it's quite a loss for them and
[16:28] I also got word that Wednesday brother
[16:30] George Martin from South Africa passed
[16:32] away another Pastor in the area and
[16:34] brother George also had a tremendous
[16:36] Ministry brother George Martin and I
[16:39] didn't know him personally but I had
[16:40] benefited from his ministry I had
[16:42] watched him a couple times and really
[16:43] rejoiced in the word and so it's a tough
[16:46] time for all of South Africa especially
[16:48] that area so I remember his assembly as
[16:50] well and keep them all in prayer
[16:54] [Music]

[22:35] day
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:39] [Music]
[22:45] God bless you Saints I greet you in the
[22:47] pressures the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:49] or the privilege and joy in our hearts
[22:51] to worship him in the spirit and Truth
[22:54] to know that God has come to us and he
[22:57] revealed to us his only chosen place of
[22:59] worship
[23:00] and how privileged people we are we are
[23:03] chosen generation and holy nation indeed
[23:06] because God Sanctified Us by his
[23:08] presence he came down and opened our
[23:10] eyes to realize that we are chosen to
[23:14] see him in this hour
[23:17] not just to worship god of History to
[23:20] worship Jesus of the history knowing
[23:22] about the things are coming we know
[23:24] there are great promises concerning a
[23:27] future but how blessed you are knowing
[23:30] who is he today
[23:33] to see he's coming
[23:35] to be part of his coming to understand
[23:38] that the bride how can Bridal come and
[23:41] with the media right is impossible in
[23:43] this age but he promised that and he is
[23:45] here to fulfill it
[23:47] so I bring the greetings on the sage
[23:49] from Poland from our congregation from
[23:51] the south of Poland we really enjoy the
[23:53] fellowship with the pastor chart last
[23:55] year he visited us he preached for us in
[23:58] the several places around it was a
[24:00] blessing so it's uh it's nice when we
[24:03] are part of the journey and we are just
[24:05] moving forward and just some days are
[24:07] passing by and still we are just
[24:10] brothers
[24:11] fellow ministers and we are just going
[24:14] the same direction I believe you can
[24:16] cherish also this Revelation that there
[24:19] is a brother or sister a side of you and
[24:22] we're still just moving the same
[24:24] direction we are still the same uh part
[24:27] of the same battle that is going on so
[24:30] this is really a wonderful because we
[24:32] know that God has got the skin upon
[24:34] himself
[24:35] God in flesh the word in flesh so this
[24:38] is really wonderful to hear the
[24:39] wonderful sermons and Promises even
[24:43] testimonies but to see God in flesh in
[24:46] the form of the Bride in the form of my
[24:48] brother and my sister this is really
[24:50] great
[24:51] we have to cherish these moments and
[24:54] fellowship like this I really appreciate
[24:56] yesterday the men's meeting I didn't
[25:00] expect at the beginning you know when I
[25:02] heard I supposed to be there and having
[25:04] a nice breakfast it was great and so
[25:08] once once again thank you as sisters for
[25:10] providing providing for us a wonderful
[25:12] food
[25:13] but I didn't expect you know I thought
[25:15] it would be more for the young Brothers
[25:17] meeting but yesterday I just realized it
[25:21] was from the 16th up to the 70 80 even
[25:25] more
[25:26] but it was wonderful I really appreciate
[25:29] the freedom of the spirit and the way
[25:31] when he was moving Among Us and I
[25:33] appreciate every brother and appreciate
[25:35] every sister and I appreciate you this
[25:38] morning and I believe that you you
[25:40] prayed and you are under expectation
[25:42] also to help me to preach to express
[25:45] myself I I need you
[25:48] I need your confidence your attitude
[25:51] your faith and then God can do something
[25:53] Among Us
[25:54] and I believe this is the reason why we
[25:57] are here to see him
[25:59] he promised that that he's be he's going
[26:02] to be here he's here already and you
[26:04] will see him according to your
[26:06] expectation
[26:08] so I invite you to open the Bible with
[26:11] me in the book of Deuteronomy 16.
[26:16] because of the autonomies chapter 16
[26:19] from the verse 16
[26:21] the verse 17.
[26:25] well you read the two portions one from
[26:28] the Old Testament one is from the New
[26:30] Testament my subject is that the three
[26:33] main Feasts are the shadow of the
[26:36] threefold mystery of God
[26:39] and I believe the holy spirit will lead
[26:43] us to the scripture I will say from the
[26:46] beginning I don't want to uh bring those
[26:49] things this is maybe uh could be a bit
[26:53] teaching but uh design my heart is to
[26:57] bring the word from a different
[26:59] perspective this morning that even the
[27:02] things that will sound at the beginning
[27:03] may be a little complicated for some of
[27:05] you
[27:06] not for everyone but for some of you but
[27:09] my desire is to bring the word of God
[27:11] with the help of the holy spirit in such
[27:13] a way that you will see it uh for a
[27:16] personal gain for the personal uh use uh
[27:21] something that we not just overwhelm you
[27:23] as like a doctrine that you say I don't
[27:25] understand it what I supposed to do to
[27:27] to to see the picture uh God will show
[27:30] you some things but you know there is
[27:33] something very uh personal in this
[27:35] sermon and I believe the Holy Spirit can
[27:38] make it this way for you and me
[27:41] so uh let's read from the Deuteronomy uh
[27:46] 16 from the verse 16.
[27:49] three times in a year shall all thy
[27:52] males appear before the Lord die God in
[27:56] the place which he shall choose
[27:59] in the face of unleavened bread
[28:02] and in the Feast of Weeks
[28:04] and in the Feast of Tabernacles
[28:07] and they shall not appear before the
[28:09] Lord empty
[28:10] every man shall give as he is able
[28:14] according to the blessing of the Lord
[28:16] thy God which he had given thee so it
[28:21] was a very very important time and God
[28:24] said he will not come before me uh
[28:27] coming to the appointed by me place with
[28:29] an empty hand
[28:31] you you cannot just come with the
[28:33] attitude uh okay what's new today I'm
[28:36] coming to one of the feasts of the Lord
[28:37] what's new for me is prepared for today
[28:40] what the priests what the minister will
[28:43] bring not this way exactly you you
[28:46] couldn't come with the empty hands
[28:47] because you you you've been obligated to
[28:51] come with the offering according to the
[28:54] blessing of God and it was a time of the
[28:57] Harvest as exactly we are living in the
[28:59] time of the Harvest and you know the
[29:02] cities reproduce and we we cannot stand
[29:05] here with the empty hands or empty heart
[29:08] or empty mind we have to bring the
[29:10] offering according to Revelation
[29:12] according to blessing the lord gave it
[29:15] to you and me
[29:16] so this is uh one of the purposes why we
[29:19] are here
[29:20] and we heard about the three major fees
[29:23] out of seven will deal with seven but
[29:26] will be focused on the three major
[29:28] Feasts and now let's read from the Saint
[29:31] John Chapter 7
[29:34] Saint John chapter 7 from the verse 37.
[29:47] Saint John chapter 7 from the verse 37
[29:52] Jesus is coming secretly
[29:55] when he was asked to come he said no I
[29:58] will not come
[29:59] but now he comes secretly
[30:01] and this is a Feast of Tabernacles
[30:05] no one recognized him
[30:07] he's failed but some people they are
[30:10] aware his disciples
[30:11] that he is there secretly in the Feast
[30:14] of Tabernacles in his coming
[30:17] Saint John 7 from the verse 37. in the
[30:21] last day that great day of the feast and
[30:24] it was a Feast of Tabernacles Jesus
[30:26] stood and cried saying if any man
[30:29] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[30:33] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[30:36] had said out of his belly shall flow
[30:39] rivers of Living Water
[30:41] but this spake he of the spirit
[30:44] which they that believe on him should
[30:47] receive for the spirit
[30:49] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[30:52] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[30:55] may the Lord will add the blessing to
[30:58] the word of God
[31:00] well let's pray
[31:03] precious heavenly father with him this
[31:06] as a wonderful privilege to be gathered
[31:08] together in the Heavenly places in
[31:10] Christ Jesus father we just realized
[31:12] once again that you have chosen Us in
[31:15] love before the foundation of the world
[31:17] but you have chosen us a predestinated
[31:20] us for the adoption in the last days for
[31:23] the hour we are living right now
[31:25] father we are so thankful we want to
[31:27] give you praise and honor and this is a
[31:30] so important Lord because we are living
[31:32] in the hour and the age of the worship
[31:34] we just realized that a book that was
[31:37] sealed up is open

[33:30] I'm in rest I I trust him I'm I'm I have
[33:35] a confidence in my heart that he is here
[33:37] and I I yelled at myself to him and I
[33:41] want to express one purpose one goal to
[33:43] glorify him by the message of the hour
[33:46] and say some things preach the word of
[33:49] God from the open book we are very
[33:51] privileged because the evening light has
[33:54] come
[33:54] it's not only the the book is open but
[33:57] also the evening like has come God
[34:00] restore the eyes
[34:01] for what would have an open book if you
[34:04] don't have eyes
[34:05] then for what you'd have eyes if you
[34:07] wouldn't have a light but there is a man
[34:09] that was able to turn on the light and I
[34:12] believe he did it personally in your
[34:14] life and this is a very very important
[34:16] when you listen the word of God don't
[34:19] think about the preacher don't think
[34:20] about
[34:21] the congregation don't don't think
[34:25] globally just be focused on the word of
[34:29] God the word of God is uh is sent to
[34:31] your heart to Enlighten your position to
[34:35] give you a deeper understanding not the
[34:38] shallow of understanding but deeper
[34:39] understanding we have to go deep deep
[34:42] and deeper because we are living in the
[34:44] hour of the rapture
[34:46] just to forgive me the there's a story
[34:50] I'm going to relate right now but it
[34:54] will just give a little light on the
[34:55] direction we go but um this is a story
[34:59] that probably happened
[35:02] um in reality there was a man he had a
[35:04] problem uh with a memory he was losing
[35:07] his memory so he came to the doctor as
[35:10] many people would do
[35:12] and he came with a question what to do
[35:15] because I'm losing my memory I I'm
[35:18] losing the you know the pictures of the
[35:20] of the past and sometimes I don't know
[35:22] exactly the details so the after certain
[35:27] interview the doctor he prescribed some
[35:30] pills and he gave it to the patient you
[35:32] know so the patient he went away
[35:34] and after one month he came back to the
[35:36] same doctor he said oh doctor just my
[35:38] memory is working perfectly everything
[35:41] is all right with my memory but the
[35:43] problem is I'm losing my side
[35:46] so after certain interview you know and
[35:49] uh the doctor he just prescribed some
[35:52] other appeals for his restoration for
[35:55] the healing of his side after a certain
[35:57] time the man is coming back
[35:59] and he said well um my side is okay my
[36:05] vision is okay but I've got a game
[36:07] problem with my memory
[36:09] you know the doctor you can imagine he
[36:11] was a little upset
[36:12] he said how many times you'll come to me
[36:15] take decision what do you prefer you
[36:17] want to have a good memory or good side
[36:20] good vision
[36:21] he pondered a little and he said well
[36:24] it's not so important where I was whom I
[36:27] met the history the main thing for me is
[36:31] to know where I'm heading
[36:33] I want to have a good Vision this is my
[36:36] choice have a good Vision good side
[36:38] okay so the doctor he was focused on the
[36:41] one thing and help this man but he's a
[36:43] really a big lesson for all of us
[36:46] you have to take a choice in your life
[36:48] you you can be linked to the past to
[36:51] many many things that happen in your
[36:52] life you can have in your mind the
[36:54] pictures of the people and the important
[36:57] events and different things but uh
[37:00] finally today I tell you it's not so
[37:03] important
[37:04] it's not so important what happened but
[37:06] the main thing in your life and my life
[37:08] is the direction we are heading
[37:11] what is your vision where you go if you
[37:14] understand the direction this is the
[37:17] main thing and this is little connected
[37:19] with the my subject
[37:21] about the three major uh Jewish feasts
[37:25] that are typed uh of the threefold
[37:28] mystery
[37:29] and it sounds maybe mysterious but uh by
[37:32] the help of the Holy Spirit I believe on
[37:34] the end of the meeting it will not be
[37:35] like this because as a ministers we are
[37:38] not sent to preach the Mysteries because
[37:41] the Mysteries were sealed in the Bible
[37:43] in the book of redemption and we we are
[37:46] sent to just give a pictures clear-cut
[37:49] pictures bright pictures for you and me
[37:51] you know to to come up higher to see to
[37:55] understand
[37:56] and I believe the the preaching of the
[37:58] word of God is the one of the ways how
[38:00] the holy spirit gives the answer for for
[38:03] your heart
[38:04] maybe you have some questions God knows
[38:07] so uh first I will explain and maybe uh
[38:10] definitely you will know many things but
[38:13] just to build out the picture for you to
[38:16] understand better what I wanted to say
[38:18] but God established uh seven feasts it's
[38:23] called The Seven Feast of Jehovah and
[38:25] it's very very important because it
[38:27] covers the whole religious calendar
[38:29] whole religious year in uh in Israel so
[38:33] that's how it started and finished it
[38:36] started by the first feast and finished
[38:38] by the seven the last one because it was
[38:41] only seven Jewish feasts
[38:44] and these seven Jewish fees that are
[38:47] divided for uh for the spring and Autumn
[38:51] time and it's uh correlating wonderful
[38:54] way with the first coming and the second
[38:56] coming of the Lord because brother
[38:58] blankie said this uh uh Jewish feast
[39:01] they are connected with the seven Church
[39:04] ages
[39:05] so it's really like a calendar it's it's
[39:08] really like a road map it's really
[39:11] showing you where you are where the
[39:14] Christians in the past where they were
[39:16] where Jesus was when he came first time
[39:18] what was about the people in the seven
[39:20] Church ages and where we are now and
[39:24] where we are heading all those things
[39:26] are really depict in the seven Jewish
[39:30] feasts
[39:31] so the first four of the feasts that
[39:34] connecting the first coming of the Lord
[39:35] and the last three are connected with
[39:39] the second coming of the Lord
[39:41] you know the first Feast was the Feast
[39:43] of unleavened bread
[39:45] and it was fulfilled of course in the
[39:48] Lord Jesus Christ Ministry in his first
[39:50] coming because Jesus he said I am the
[39:52] bread that came down from heaven
[39:55] and he said Beware of the Pharisees of
[39:59] the eleven
[40:00] because they are hypocrites they are
[40:03] teaching right but they are not
[40:04] practicing or they teach the people so
[40:07] Jesus he said uh do what they teach
[40:10] do what they teach but don't follow them
[40:13] because there is a a difference between
[40:16] the preaching and their life they are
[40:19] not living a life worthy of the Gospel
[40:22] but Jesus Christ he was a purebred
[40:25] coming down from heaven without n11
[40:28] without any hypocrisy without any
[40:31] denomination not adding not taking away
[40:33] from the world
[40:35] so Jesus he fulfilled the first Feast
[40:38] the second Feast that was in fact
[40:40] connected very much uh with the first
[40:43] Feast the second Feast the Feast of
[40:45] Passover was a feast that was showing us
[40:49] a real uh uh Passover Lamb sacrificial
[40:54] lamb it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:56] because we know that in the Old
[40:58] Testament was a natural Lamb with a
[41:00] natural blood but it was not able really
[41:02] to redeem the worshiper all the time the
[41:05] people who are coming back all the time
[41:07] and with their sacrifice but so they had
[41:10] a certain relief but there was no
[41:12] solution
[41:13] this is the type of uh churchgoer
[41:17] there's nothing wrong with this it was
[41:19] nothing wrong with the person that was
[41:22] uh observing you know the the sacrifice
[41:25] that God
[41:27] obligated people to do if someone just
[41:30] brought their sacrifice like this it was
[41:33] all he knew it was all that was
[41:35] available but it was not complete
[41:38] solution of the problem of the sin
[41:41] the same is today someone is just coming
[41:43] to church or telling okay I'm in the
[41:45] message I'm born in the message I'm
[41:47] arranged the message I this and that I
[41:50] declare I just uh I take a stand this is
[41:53] nice
[41:54] but really what we need is a personal
[41:57] revelation
[41:58] which is a which is a personal
[42:01] experience of the new birth
[42:03] and it can happen only by accepting the
[42:06] perfect sacrifice of the Lord Jesus
[42:08] Christ the bloody word when you will
[42:10] accept it God is responding because the
[42:13] life that was in the in the real uh lamb
[42:16] the Lamb of God is coming back on the
[42:18] worshiper and this is a vast difference
[42:21] between the Old Testament and New
[42:23] Testament all coming on the New Covenant
[42:25] so there is a reality and Jesus Christ
[42:28] he fulfilled
[42:30] the second fees the Feast of Passover by
[42:33] being crucified on Calvary
[42:35] they're down Calvary it was such a
[42:38] realitybraham he told us that that day
[42:40] on Calvary solved completely the problem
[42:42] of sin
[42:44] for a True Believer when you really
[42:46] believe that it's finished
[42:48] when he said one sentence is finished
[42:50] it's really finished
[42:52] you don't have to live under
[42:53] contamination
[42:55] you don't have to just receive any
[42:57] Temptation and and think how I will
[42:59] overcome this temptation in my life you
[43:02] don't have to even fight with this you
[43:04] can ignore it because it's finished
[43:08] nothing can defeat you if you see that
[43:12] their own Calvary that he redeemed you
[43:14] he paid a complete price of redemption
[43:17] so no one of us
[43:19] should live beneath the Privileges we
[43:22] are so privileged people no they will be
[43:24] we are now
[43:27] you are the possessor of all things only
[43:30] because he paid the price of redemption
[43:32] for you and me in this day on Calvary
[43:36] if we are looking back messenger said if
[43:39] we are looking back and we are comparing
[43:42] and trying to dig in the past is only a
[43:45] proof that this day on Calvary didn't
[43:49] influence us enough
[43:51] because when you see the whole
[43:54] perspective how great the work it was
[43:56] you will not look back
[43:58] thank you okay I'm coming from this
[44:00] family on that family and there was some
[44:03] problems maybe I inherited something no
[44:06] it's finished
[44:08] so the Lord Jesus Christ he fulfilled
[44:10] the second
[44:12] the second feast and the third Feast was
[44:15] a feast of their first fruit
[44:17] and the first the third fees the Feast
[44:20] of first fruits was the type of the
[44:23] Resurrection
[44:25] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:27] then when it was fulfilled it was the
[44:31] shadow in the Old Testament when there
[44:34] was a Harvest Time
[44:37] coming to the maturity whole grain and
[44:39] the
[44:40] the farmer could come
[44:42] with the priest and he took the the
[44:45] sheath of the first ripen uh portion of
[44:49] that field and he gave it to the priests
[44:52] and Priests he just waved before the
[44:55] Lord as a wife offering
[44:58] showing that there is a wheat that is
[45:01] reproduced that is ripened and there is
[45:04] a beginning of the Harvest Time and when
[45:07] God accepted this sheath of the ripened
[45:11] grain he accepted also the entire field
[45:14] it's very important to understand the
[45:17] third Feast because then how you can
[45:19] understand I am accepted in the action
[45:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:24] when he was resurrected in fact I was
[45:26] resurrected because when he was
[45:28] crucified I was crucified
[45:30] when he was raised I was raised
[45:33] you know this graying the the ripenberry
[45:36] chief was taken from the ground from the
[45:39] earth higher and waved amen
[45:43] there was a power a dynamic that was
[45:45] included in that feast but of course
[45:49] they had the shadow in the Old Testament
[45:51] they were depending on those things but
[45:54] all those things that were Justified the
[45:57] reality that was fulfilled in the Lord
[45:59] Jesus Christ
[46:01] amen but he was not the end of the way
[46:04] amen
[46:05] it was just the end of the Old Testament
[46:08] fulfillment of the Prophecies of the Old
[46:11] Testament but they were also their
[46:13] prophecies and the promises connected
[46:15] with the New Testament
[46:17] with the end of the New Testament that
[46:19] we are living right now
[46:22] so the fourth Feast that was connected
[46:26] with the first coming of the Lord and
[46:28] was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:30] the fourth Feast was the Feast of the
[46:33] weeks
[46:34] the seven sabbaths seven stars seven
[46:37] times seven Forty Nine and then was the
[46:39] Feast of the weeks the Pentecost
[46:42] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[46:44] and it was a very important Feast
[46:47] because it was the second of the three
[46:50] the major ones
[46:52] they passed over that was connected with
[46:55] the unleavened bread and that was a
[46:58] daddy on Calvary and then after seven
[47:00] sabbaths amen
[47:03] God that was with them in the tent
[47:07] of the body of Emmanuel the same God the
[47:10] same Spirit move in the fourth face in
[47:14] the Feast of the weeks to go into the
[47:17] people
[47:18] it was very important because of Jesus
[47:20] when he came down first time Emmanuel
[47:23] God in flesh he was a great great thing
[47:26] but he was a God that was above us he
[47:29] was with us
[47:31] prophetic Ministry son of man Ministry
[47:34] unveiling of God in flesh
[47:36] great moments but it was not everything
[47:39] because God wanted to dwell in the
[47:41] people
[47:42] he was not satisfied to show himself
[47:45] amen by the scripture he was showing who
[47:48] he was letting them by themselves to
[47:52] just extract you know from his speech
[47:54] who he was because he didn't tell them
[47:56] openly our Messiah I am son of man no no
[48:00] he took a Moses and Sons and and the
[48:03] prophets but they had to listen
[48:05] carefully and he took maybe a six hours
[48:07] of the sermon but their eyes became open
[48:10] and they realized they are walking with
[48:12] the word of God it was great because it
[48:15] was a God himself he was above her above
[48:18] them he was with them but still they
[48:21] needed to experience something more
[48:25] so now you know the fourth Feast the
[48:27] Baptist of the holy spirit is very
[48:29] important all the fees are very
[48:31] important this is like a journey you
[48:34] start with the first Feast you have to
[48:36] experience a second and the third and
[48:39] the fourth
[48:40] and then you are coming to the six
[48:41] months of the drought in Israel not so
[48:44] much rain so we have to walk by faith
[48:47] but you you are uh recharged by the
[48:50] experience of the first four feasts and
[48:54] now we are coming to the seven Church
[48:56] ages
[48:57] long long way almost 2 000 years ago
[49:00] before the between the first husband of
[49:03] Christ and the second Advent of Christ
[49:06] and now we are coming to the seven month
[49:09] it's called tishiri and the seven month
[49:12] starts with a trumpet
[49:13] 10 days of trumpets
[49:15] trumpets with a certain message
[49:19] it's up to the sound of the trumpet
[49:21] certain sound of the trumpet gave a
[49:23] certain message but the different sound
[49:25] of the same trumpet gave a different
[49:27] message and that's a Paul he explained
[49:30] that we have to be train
[49:32] to understand the certain sound of the
[49:36] trumpet this is a war a wedding or
[49:39] whatever it is maybe Feast we have to
[49:42] understand if we don't understand you
[49:44] know the voice of the trumpet then we
[49:47] will do something different then we'll
[49:49] not do the service according to the will
[49:51] of God but we will try to do a cervix
[49:54] against his will only because we'll say
[49:57] okay this is voice of the trumpet but we
[49:59] don't understand the time the season
[50:02] amen but we have to recognize our day
[50:05] and our message
[50:06] we have we have to have an ear inner ear
[50:09] to understand what he's speaking right
[50:12] now
[50:14] so that's the way how for 10 days the
[50:17] trumpets in the seventh uh month now we
[50:21] are coming to the last days
[50:23] because the last three fees that were
[50:26] connected with the second coming of the
[50:27] Lord
[50:28] because brother he said the the the
[50:30] seventh month is connected with the
[50:34] seventh Church age we are living now
[50:37] God is going with the numbers all of you
[50:39] you know it
[50:40] so after 10 days of
[50:44] of the trumpeting there was a Yom Kippur
[50:47] it was a fifth
[50:49] it was a
[50:52] the sixth Feast Yom Kippur
[50:55] maybe we read quickly you know this just
[50:58] to remind you but uh it's in the
[51:00] Leviticus
[51:02] Leviticus 23
[51:05] Leviticus 23 verse 27
[51:10] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[51:13] also on the 10th day of this seven month
[51:17] there shall be a day of atonement Yom
[51:21] Kippur
[51:22] so you see it was in the seventh month
[51:27] it shall be a holy convocation unto you
[51:30] you shall afflict your soul
[51:32] and offer offering made by fire unto the
[51:36] Lord
[51:37] and you shall do no work in the same day
[51:40] for is the day of atonement to make
[51:43] atonement for you before the Lord your
[51:47] God
[51:48] so uh it was not the Feast for bring a
[51:54] sacrifice
[51:56] no because the sacrifice was already
[51:58] offered in a Passover
[52:00] and we know the Yom Kippur is a type
[52:02] when the two prophets will come in the
[52:05] tribulation period when the branch will
[52:08] not be here anymore she'll be in the
[52:10] palace but the two prophets will come
[52:12] and by the mighty voice of the trumpet
[52:16] they will just turn the heart of the
[52:18] hundred forty four thousand to Messiah
[52:21] but it will not be a time that Jesus
[52:23] Christ will have to die again
[52:25] so you see the Yom Kippur is not
[52:27] connected with the bloody sacrifice
[52:29] because when Jesus will come and they
[52:32] will see his wounds they will only ask
[52:34] him from where you got it what happened
[52:37] I got it in the house of my friends
[52:40] when it happened two thousand years ago
[52:42] he will referring to this but now they
[52:45] will come they will be gathered together
[52:46] to come under the seventh trumpet they
[52:50] suffer already under the trumpets they
[52:52] paid the price of the rejection of the
[52:54] Lord Jesus Christ because they missed
[52:56] that their own Calvary they miss their
[52:58] true Passover they means that through
[53:01] the Feast of the weeks that means the
[53:03] understanding what really Jesus who he
[53:06] was how he fulfilled the Shadows
[53:09] completely perfectly they will have to
[53:11] pay the price
[53:12] so we know there will be a killed in the
[53:15] tribulation period that will be
[53:16] resurrected for the Millennium they will
[53:18] be around the bride they must be there
[53:21] but uh you know we see that there are
[53:25] six
[53:26] fees that Yom Kippur was not a really
[53:28] long feast
[53:30] it took only five days
[53:32] it's showing us that God requires quick
[53:35] repentance
[53:37] you know I I'm living in the Catholic
[53:40] country 97 percent of population of our
[53:42] country or more they are Catholics so
[53:45] the Catholics are well known from the
[53:47] constant endless repentance that
[53:50] bringing no fruits
[53:52] because they are repenting for this and
[53:54] that for smoking and drinking and and
[53:56] every Sunday are coming to the church
[53:58] for Mass because they are obligated to
[54:00] be there they believe God is just in the
[54:03] church in the building by holy priest we
[54:06] don't believe it God is with you
[54:08] wherever you are
[54:10] amen such a priesthood is over we are
[54:13] under Melchizedek now it's a different
[54:15] story friends especially in our time but
[54:18] you know those people they are repenting
[54:20] repenting uh you know they say I would
[54:22] like to be better this and that or no
[54:25] fruits
[54:26] God is showing by Yom Kippur that he
[54:28] gave only five days from the tenth day
[54:31] of the seventh month to the 15th day he
[54:34] gave only five days of the quick
[54:36] repentance
[54:38] amen repentance must be real quick solid
[54:43] not talking about amen
[54:46] after five days of the Yom Kippur in the
[54:49] 15th day of the seventh month we are
[54:51] coming to the Feast of Tabernacles
[54:56] Miracles that was a probably the
[54:58] greatest of all seven
[55:00] because the seven is perfection
[55:03] seven is completion one two three four
[55:06] five six is not the completion there is
[55:10] no sign of perfection but when the
[55:13] worshiper was coming through all these
[55:15] feasts and coming to a seven one he hit
[55:19] the seven and seven is very important
[55:21] because we know that by sevens God is
[55:25] working also in our time
[55:27] there was a seven Church ages
[55:30] it was leaving the Seven Seals seven
[55:32] Thunders seven trumpets seven five seven
[55:35] seven seven
[55:37] leading us to a seventh day in a
[55:39] millennium yes honeymoon of the Bride
[55:42] the bride room
[55:43] you see the Feast of Tabernacles was
[55:45] very very important I cannot stress it
[55:49] enough I don't know how to do that
[55:50] friends but I know the Holy Spirit can
[55:52] do it
[55:54] he said in the future home of the
[55:57] Heavenly bridegroom and the early bright
[55:59] paragraph four five four and four five
[56:04] five the Feast of Tabernacles was the
[56:07] last feast the seven Thief we are
[56:10] worshiping now under the Feast of
[56:13] Tabernacles the seventh Church age we
[56:16] are I don't know who is who but he said
[56:20] we at least we as at least more than one
[56:23] so program he meant himself and everyone
[56:27] that got the same revelation
[56:29] is in the same line of Revelation the
[56:33] the the unity of faith in the last days
[56:36] he said we are worshiping now
[56:39] what do you think now is not anymore now
[56:42] we see this is still now because the
[56:45] Seven Feast the Feast of Tabernacles was
[56:48] the last one
[56:49] is like a bridge One Foundation is here
[56:52] the other Foundation is on the side
[56:54] there is a river between
[56:56] the river of unknown but God provided a
[57:00] bridge
[57:01] and brother Brown taught us that the
[57:03] Feast of Tabernacle starts in the
[57:05] seventh Church age
[57:07] Amen in a seventh day
[57:09] and through the bridge of the Holy
[57:11] Spirit it leads us to the millennium
[57:14] because he said in the Millennium we
[57:16] will be
[57:18] future tense Millennium will be it's not
[57:22] yet will be
[57:24] in the Millennium we will be under the
[57:26] Feast of Tabernacles again in the
[57:29] seventh day so we need these Bridge
[57:31] friends we we have to establish
[57:34] something now where we are on the way
[57:37] where you are on the mat amen
[57:41] when we withdraw from Washington DC by
[57:45] car to Dayton until we met by the child
[57:48] and he picked us up you know so we we
[57:51] cover maybe a 700 or 800 kilometer or
[57:53] something like this
[57:54] being in some places you know if you
[57:57] would be around let's say Dayton you
[58:00] want to reach Dayton and you see there
[58:02] is a 50 miles to Dayton you are happy
[58:06] okay you know Direction but now we are
[58:10] driving let's say 20 minutes and you see
[58:12] 70 miles Dayton
[58:15] there is a question
[58:17] then you continue for the next 15
[58:19] minutes and you see 80 miles
[58:22] then you've got a really a question you
[58:25] have to realize you are just wandering
[58:28] around Dayton
[58:30] changing directions
[58:32] but you really miss the only Direction
[58:35] we have to understand friends Where We
[58:38] Are
[58:39] on God's map we cannot only repeat that
[58:43] we believe the message yes which part of
[58:46] the message because there is a
[58:48] progression in the message
[58:50] even the angel of the Lord came to
[58:52] brother Branham in his life telling him
[58:55] be careful don't depend you are in the
[58:57] message you have a message you have to
[58:59] realize and recognize in which part of
[59:02] the message you are right now
[59:04] you've got the first part the body the
[59:07] second part the spirit and now is a time
[59:09] for the third part the soul the Inner
[59:13] Man the gene of God super race amen
[59:22] he was a changing of dispensation really
[59:26] a turning point yet to just realize I'm
[59:29] going away from the goal or I'm just
[59:33] coming in the direction of my goal
[59:35] that's the reason the vision is so
[59:37] important
[59:38] please forgive me if you don't
[59:40] understand always my English uh I
[59:43] explained last time three years ago you
[59:44] know this I never went to school I never
[59:46] learned English you know all I have the
[59:48] Holy Spirit depend on him but I trust
[59:50] that you understand what I'm talking
[59:51] about
[59:52] we have to understand where we are on
[59:55] the spiritual map
[59:56] and a messenger he said we are
[59:59] worshiping now
[1:00:02] when I say now it's connection inside of
[1:00:05] me with that great I am because when
[1:00:08] Jesus he he came he said he will not
[1:00:10] recognize that I am now not I am to the
[1:00:15] days of Moses or the other prophets I am
[1:00:18] that I am now he was standing there so
[1:00:22] it's very important to understand that
[1:00:24] the Feast of Tabernacles we are
[1:00:26] worshiping now under this Feast now
[1:00:30] who will worship worshipers
[1:00:33] worshipers not on this mountain that
[1:00:36] mountain oh brother you you went to this
[1:00:38] church oh now we are defiled now we are
[1:00:40] notified by coming to this church at
[1:00:42] other church people are afraid of the
[1:00:44] different things they will be defiled by
[1:00:46] meeting this brother sister man or woman
[1:00:49] no no no people are defiled from inside
[1:00:53] by the wrong Vision or lacking of vision
[1:00:56] but you cannot be defied and you will
[1:00:59] never defy the brother or sister you
[1:01:01] understand there is a Feast of
[1:01:03] Tabernacles going on in my life
[1:01:06] I understand I came to the seventh
[1:01:09] Church age I came to seven I came to
[1:01:11] completion I came to Perfection not
[1:01:14] because I was trying so much Holy Spirit
[1:01:16] Led me until now
[1:01:19] you know so now you understand uh
[1:01:23] I remind I reminded you a bit you know
[1:01:25] the seven feasts but the three of them
[1:01:28] there are major ones
[1:01:30] and they are itemized by Moses
[1:01:34] God said these three are very important
[1:01:37] extremely important is that every man
[1:01:40] which is the head of the house head of
[1:01:43] the family
[1:01:44] is connected with the responsibility
[1:01:46] every man will come three times a year
[1:01:51] to the Feast of the unleavened bread
[1:01:53] which is a Passover
[1:01:55] and you have to experience
[1:01:58] Passover
[1:01:59] you have to experience that they're on
[1:02:01] Calvary it must be yours
[1:02:05] not because you heard this hundred times
[1:02:07] or thousand times
[1:02:09] not because you are raised in the
[1:02:11] community they are talking about those
[1:02:12] things no it must be a personal
[1:02:14] revelation for you
[1:02:17] that he took my place on the calvary and
[1:02:21] now literally I can take his place
[1:02:26] nothing left
[1:02:29] when you experience that you are already
[1:02:31] changed person but it's not enough
[1:02:34] because you have to come to the baptism
[1:02:36] of the Holy Spirit you have to come to
[1:02:38] the Feast of the weeks Jubilee amen
[1:02:42] Jubilee trumpet we are free even you are
[1:02:45] free from the things you didn't realize
[1:02:47] you said okay Jesus he died for me I'm
[1:02:49] so happy Jesus Set Me Free but after a
[1:02:52] certain time you see some things
[1:02:55] that are attached to your life
[1:02:57] you've got the thought that you don't
[1:02:58] like you want to cast it out and you
[1:03:01] you're struggling you are fighting and
[1:03:03] and Paul he said don't fight don't punch
[1:03:05] in the air
[1:03:06] be more precise
[1:03:08] when you heat he's really the enemy
[1:03:10] don't hit the brother and don't hit
[1:03:12] yourself don't stand before the mirror
[1:03:15] and don't just blame yourself for
[1:03:16] everything
[1:03:18] amen there's a reason when the Baptist
[1:03:21] of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:22] is coming as a confirmation that you
[1:03:25] experience that day on Calvary
[1:03:27] the little Life of Christ is coming
[1:03:29] inside of you
[1:03:31] you are receiving the very anointing
[1:03:34] that was not only Upon Jesus but Jesus
[1:03:37] was that anointing
[1:03:40] there's a reason many people today they
[1:03:42] are coming and they have a anointing and
[1:03:45] they are looking for anointing for the
[1:03:47] feeling for the experience nothing
[1:03:49] against it but people only with the
[1:03:52] anointing they will be deceived finally
[1:03:55] but we have to become this anointing the
[1:03:58] bride today she became him
[1:04:02] she's him
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:05] if you will become that anointing you
[1:04:08] cannot be deceived
[1:04:09] Matthew 24 24.
[1:04:12] you cannot be deceived it's just
[1:04:14] impossible why because you became him
[1:04:18] you became the word
[1:04:20] you've been a thought the attribute you
[1:04:23] became the word and this is not the end
[1:04:25] of the way because you have to come to
[1:04:27] the glorified body
[1:04:30] this is a journey
[1:04:31] and God helps us by showing us in the
[1:04:34] scripture in the word from the open book
[1:04:37] where we are
[1:04:39] but the baptism of the holy spirit is a
[1:04:41] part of the journey but this is not the
[1:04:44] end
[1:04:44] because there is a third
[1:04:47] the last major Feast is the Feast of
[1:04:50] Tabernacles
[1:04:51] after that down Calvary you are coming
[1:04:54] to the Battle of spirit this is not the
[1:04:56] end of the way
[1:04:58] amen that's the reason a Pentecostals
[1:05:01] charismatics they didn't realize the
[1:05:03] turning point
[1:05:04] change of dispensation allowed this year
[1:05:07] there is another age
[1:05:09] come up higher amen
[1:05:12] and you will see the things that are to
[1:05:14] be they cannot see it because they
[1:05:16] rejected the messenger
[1:05:18] with the message
[1:05:20] that was sent only to the bride
[1:05:22] Hallelujah to call us out from the
[1:05:25] Pentecostal understanding to the real
[1:05:27] feast what a change today in my country
[1:05:31] Catholics Protestants everyone they are
[1:05:34] receiving but the Holy Spirit Catholics
[1:05:36] are dancing prophesying and singing a
[1:05:38] spirit everything
[1:05:42] you don't have a revelation you will not
[1:05:44] understand
[1:05:46] but we have a revelation God unveil
[1:05:49] himself
[1:05:50] amen unveiling of God in Christ
[1:05:54] but now the branch is unveiling of
[1:05:56] Christ
[1:05:58] the continuation friends this is so
[1:06:00] wonderful when you can see those things
[1:06:03] you are so happy inside because you know
[1:06:05] I I didn't deserve for that
[1:06:07] I didn't deserve for the for the Feast
[1:06:11] of Passover no he did it for me
[1:06:13] above the whole spirit amen it's God he
[1:06:16] did it for me and now we are coming the
[1:06:19] Feast of Tabernacles
[1:06:21] the third and the last major feast
[1:06:25] the third from the three the major feast
[1:06:27] and the last also from the seven
[1:06:30] completion we are worshiping now on the
[1:06:33] Feast of Tabernacles
[1:06:38] was preaching
[1:06:41] theory about the Revelation Book of
[1:06:44] Revelation he said
[1:06:46] in the 1961
[1:06:49] 18 of
[1:06:50] June paragraph
[1:06:54] 208 he said
[1:06:56] this is the time when everything must
[1:06:59] worship
[1:07:01] remember how appropriate
[1:07:03] now don't let us miss
[1:07:06] this now
[1:07:07] don't let us miss this now listen close
[1:07:11] when all the mysteries of church age was
[1:07:15] finished
[1:07:16] when all the mysteries of the plans of
[1:07:19] redemption
[1:07:20] Seven Seals were open
[1:07:23] immediately after this now look is a
[1:07:26] time for all everything in heaven and
[1:07:30] everything on the earth to worship God
[1:07:34] this even was such a great event in the
[1:07:37] Revelation 5 when somebody was Worthy
[1:07:41] your husband your representation
[1:07:43] Kingsman Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:45] he took that book and opened the book
[1:07:49] open the Seven Seals there's a one thing
[1:07:52] scripturally you can find it easily in
[1:07:55] relation five after the seals become
[1:07:57] open there's a one thing scripturally
[1:07:59] worship
[1:08:00] Worship in heaven worship on the Earth
[1:08:04] you worship God Amen two thousand years
[1:08:07] ago John saw you he saw me John is
[1:08:11] typing the bride John also he saw
[1:08:13] himself but also he saw you the redeemed
[1:08:16] ones what they did what was they respond
[1:08:19] where the seeds become open glory honor
[1:08:22] Hallelujah because you redeem us
[1:08:25] it was not Angels not the Heavenly
[1:08:28] beings it was you and me
[1:08:30] Amen in eternity but now as brother
[1:08:34] Brown he said the world she was in
[1:08:35] heaven now is on the Earth all the
[1:08:37] sceneries moved down on the earth that's
[1:08:39] the reason it was a silence in heaven
[1:08:41] for about a half an hour
[1:08:45] people they say if I could go there if I
[1:08:48] would understand it if I would meet God
[1:08:50] don't look up so high
[1:08:53] he came down he humbled himself for you
[1:08:56] and me he came down to the Satan season
[1:08:59] he's looking for you he knows you by
[1:09:01] name he was the only one worthy to open
[1:09:04] the book when he released the seals he
[1:09:07] released the names
[1:09:09] when he broke the Seal of your life your
[1:09:11] ministry is released
[1:09:13] amen you have a Ministry
[1:09:15] because brother he said the broken sin
[1:09:17] means releasing Ministry
[1:09:21] now we understand what to do
[1:09:23] Caesar open I understand I'm part of the
[1:09:25] book I took the book from the seven
[1:09:27] messenger I ate it up amen he preached
[1:09:30] it was he was cut on the tape I receive
[1:09:32] it amen and now I'm part of it
[1:09:35] I have open book Hallelujah I'm ready to
[1:09:39] prophesy to worship give him praise
[1:09:41] honor
[1:09:42] you can go to the mega churches
[1:09:44] everything is Mega Everything Is
[1:09:46] Beautiful wonderful like laodicea and
[1:09:49] they don't need Holy Spirit
[1:09:53] they need maybe a Passover yes they need
[1:09:56] that Baptist Holy Spirit the Feast of
[1:09:58] the weeks but they know nothing about
[1:10:00] the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:10:02] but you know because the messenger
[1:10:04] connected you with the mind of God Amen
[1:10:07] you understand the things that you could
[1:10:09] understand before
[1:10:10] what are the privileged friends aren't
[1:10:12] you happy aren't you privilege aren't
[1:10:15] you blessed by God not by Man by God
[1:10:20] this is so wonderful
[1:10:22] it's coming to me one story about a
[1:10:25] certain Explorer
[1:10:26] he was going to a jungle creating a Maps
[1:10:30] measurements different things
[1:10:32] looking for the new places to put them
[1:10:35] on the map
[1:10:36] one day he lost his path in the jungle
[1:10:39] and there was a Darkness coming and this
[1:10:42] man he had nothing you know he was a
[1:10:45] very very
[1:10:46] serious and complicated situation but
[1:10:49] this man here the three matches in his
[1:10:51] pocket
[1:10:52] three matches and he knew if I will just
[1:10:55] reach a fire I will just lead the fire
[1:10:58] and around the bonfire I will be a safe
[1:11:00] because the wild bees will be afraid of
[1:11:02] the fire
[1:11:03] it's always this way
[1:11:05] the point was it was after the rain so
[1:11:08] everything was wet he had the only three
[1:11:10] matches
[1:11:12] so you know he used the first one
[1:11:15] didn't work sorry
[1:11:18] he used the second
[1:11:20] didn't work
[1:11:22] now here the last one the third one and
[1:11:25] the last one
[1:11:26] all his life was in this little match
[1:11:29] I don't know if he was the utterist or
[1:11:31] he was a Believer or who he was I don't
[1:11:33] know but I definitely dare to pray
[1:11:36] and he prayed Lord
[1:11:39] I have a one match help me now my life
[1:11:43] is
[1:11:44] in this last and third March and he
[1:11:49] and it worked
[1:11:51] he was saved
[1:11:53] friends sometimes like that
[1:11:55] you have to understand where you are
[1:11:58] and this is a very serious hour
[1:12:01] I'm not here to put a fear
[1:12:03] upon no one
[1:12:05] but the Holy Spirit sometimes when he's
[1:12:07] showing us where we are now
[1:12:09] if we don't have a light in the Satan's
[1:12:12] Eden the present light
[1:12:14] you you you will say okay I will just
[1:12:16] run to this man this is maybe the man of
[1:12:18] the hour maybe we have a new preacher
[1:12:20] maybe he is a solution of the of the of
[1:12:22] the moment no you need the the fine side
[1:12:26] you need the light inside amen you need
[1:12:30] something is working for you on daily
[1:12:32] basis
[1:12:33] for me friends this is the Feast of
[1:12:36] Tabernacles
[1:12:39] if you will not understand me that
[1:12:42] that's normal praise the Lord you have a
[1:12:44] pastor you know to to correct and just
[1:12:46] answer because on Tuesday we are going
[1:12:50] but still I'm available this uh today
[1:12:52] afternoon
[1:12:54] but you know
[1:12:57] the things I present they are from the
[1:12:58] Bible
[1:12:59] they're exactly from the message
[1:13:02] amen not in one place you can rest on
[1:13:05] this
[1:13:07] you know when the Feast of Tabernacle
[1:13:09] started naturally in the Israel it
[1:13:13] started with the Sabbath and he finished
[1:13:15] with the Sabbath
[1:13:16] and he had to be a real Sabbath no work
[1:13:19] no civil work at the beginning in the
[1:13:23] first day and the seventh day amen
[1:13:26] you know when Jesus we read the
[1:13:28] scripture
[1:13:30] when Jesus came secretly in the Feast of
[1:13:33] Tabernacles in the Saint John 7 chapter
[1:13:36] he said to his brothers no I will not go
[1:13:39] because they suggested he make it more
[1:13:41] public he said no
[1:13:43] no I will not go but he went
[1:13:46] that's how brother explained us that
[1:13:48] Jesus was a dual being
[1:13:51] sometimes it was Jesus speaking
[1:13:52] sometimes it was a father speaking
[1:13:55] they won in one flesh but Jesus could
[1:13:58] say no I will not go but if the father
[1:14:00] inside gave him a picture go he went
[1:14:06] fullness of godhead badly amen God and
[1:14:10] the man
[1:14:12] so he went there secretly
[1:14:15] you know that uh in the Old Testament
[1:14:17] when they practice the Feast of
[1:14:19] Tabernacles it wasn't for seven days so
[1:14:22] every day there was a procession of the
[1:14:24] priest was coming down from the uh from
[1:14:27] the temple Mountain they were coming
[1:14:29] down to Siloam pool and it was called uh
[1:14:35] Living Water here they they had a golden
[1:14:37] pitcher and took the the water that was
[1:14:40] called The Living Water
[1:14:42] because it was connected with the major
[1:14:45] uh fountain that whole Jerusalem was
[1:14:49] provided by water
[1:14:50] so every day the morning there was
[1:14:52] coming down and they took the water they
[1:14:54] were climbing up
[1:14:57] and they did it once a day
[1:15:00] there was an altar nothing about the
[1:15:03] sacrifice
[1:15:04] but they poured the water upon the altar
[1:15:07] the next day they did the same the third
[1:15:09] day the same the 14 was saying fifth day
[1:15:12] the same
[1:15:13] six are the same the seventh day they
[1:15:16] were coming down they took a water
[1:15:18] coming up and
[1:15:21] went around seven times around the altar
[1:15:24] and then they poured the water
[1:15:26] and in that shadow in that picture was a
[1:15:31] prayer to God for the blessing of the
[1:15:34] water for the next Harvest of the next
[1:15:36] year because it was the end of the year
[1:15:39] like we are now in the Harvest Time amen
[1:15:43] but there's a Feast of Tabernacle
[1:15:45] connect about the future
[1:15:46] yes that's what they did Amen in the
[1:15:50] last day of the great day of the feast
[1:15:52] it was exactly when they circulated the
[1:15:54] seven times and they poured the water
[1:15:56] upon the altar Jesus was standing there
[1:16:00] in the last day of the great day of the
[1:16:02] feast in the seventh day he was standing
[1:16:05] there
[1:16:06] pouring the water amen without a request
[1:16:10] to Jehovah please send us a rain for the
[1:16:13] next season
[1:16:14] in the same time
[1:16:16] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:16:19] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[1:16:23] amen they had a little water they call
[1:16:26] it a living water but there was a living
[1:16:28] water in flesh
[1:16:29] he was standing there messiah in the
[1:16:31] face of Tabernacles and they didn't know
[1:16:33] it
[1:16:35] they practice all day things you know
[1:16:38] like they did it from the forefathers
[1:16:40] and the fathers and and everyone was
[1:16:42] doing that precisely
[1:16:44] but it was only religion
[1:16:47] because they got that introduced all
[1:16:50] these feasts at the feet of Tabernacles
[1:16:52] were standing there
[1:16:53] telling come to me if you are thirst
[1:16:57] let come any man that is thirst let him
[1:17:01] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[1:17:04] on me as the scripture had said
[1:17:07] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:17:10] Living Water so this is the evidence of
[1:17:12] Holy Ghost
[1:17:13] this is the evidence that you experience
[1:17:15] all these three Feasts
[1:17:18] Passover
[1:17:20] Pentecost
[1:17:23] Feast of Tabernacles Jesus he said
[1:17:26] everyone that believed on me as the
[1:17:28] scripture says amen what will happen in
[1:17:31] his life out of his belly shall flow the
[1:17:34] Waters of the Living Water
[1:17:37] that's what the prophet taught us
[1:17:39] the evidence of having holy ghost is
[1:17:42] clear understanding of the scripture
[1:17:44] you see the picture you see where you
[1:17:46] are you see where it's the messengers
[1:17:48] where is the the word where is how it
[1:17:51] unveils
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:55] but despake he of the spirit which they
[1:17:58] that believe on him should receive for
[1:18:01] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:18:03] that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:11] amazing story he's standing there and
[1:18:14] they're still pouring the water
[1:18:16] according to our religion
[1:18:18] they didn't realize how the shadow
[1:18:20] became a reality
[1:18:26] we are waiting for four friends
[1:18:29] for what we are waiting
[1:18:31] what's your expectation
[1:18:32] Bryce Revival
[1:18:34] Great Awakening
[1:18:35] men of the hour that will just summon
[1:18:37] all the churches together
[1:18:39] what we are looking for
[1:18:41] I would say that what we are looking for
[1:18:44] is here
[1:18:46] if you are looking for messiah if you
[1:18:48] are looking for Perfection we are
[1:18:50] looking for the the last Revival if you
[1:18:52] are looking for the Rapture everything
[1:18:54] is here
[1:18:55] Messiah the anointed world for that age
[1:18:58] is here right now
[1:19:00] but don't look him around that becomes
[1:19:03] special anointing you must be anointing
[1:19:06] anointing is not enough
[1:19:08] anointing will not take the people to
[1:19:11] the rapture
[1:19:12] as the anointing doesn't take them to
[1:19:15] the field of Tabernacles it must be
[1:19:16] something inside of you
[1:19:19] because there's something inside of you
[1:19:21] from within you will hear the voice this
[1:19:24] is the way you're supposed to follow
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:31] now
[1:19:32] we see the Promise being fulfilled it's
[1:19:35] from the sermon Christ The Mystery of
[1:19:37] God revealed Christ the true headship
[1:19:39] going in
[1:19:41] coming in his bride doing the same works
[1:19:45] that he did at the beginning
[1:19:48] don't misinterpret what I read now
[1:19:51] because he didn't say the headship is
[1:19:54] going incoming in me he said coming in
[1:19:57] his bride
[1:19:59] Where is the headship
[1:20:01] what is the seventh what is the
[1:20:02] Perfection What is the fullness
[1:20:05] in the bride of Christ
[1:20:08] in the midst of his coming amen
[1:20:11] I'm sorry but the first coming was
[1:20:14] rejected
[1:20:16] handful of people recognize who he was
[1:20:19] even those on the end of his three years
[1:20:22] and half of his ministry they were so
[1:20:24] shaken some of them they left they
[1:20:26] denied completely who he was
[1:20:29] some of them are so afraid that like a
[1:20:31] Peter he denies I don't know this man he
[1:20:34] was a message believer
[1:20:36] the main preacher
[1:20:38] someone with the key
[1:20:40] it was someone under the people waited
[1:20:42] if there's a different opinions let's
[1:20:45] call Peter he will open the door
[1:20:48] but he said I don't know this door I
[1:20:51] don't have any keys
[1:20:52] he said to the woman before certain
[1:20:55] church I don't know this ministry
[1:20:59] friends
[1:21:00] but now is also even more mysterious
[1:21:04] is more complicated for the people
[1:21:07] in the life like your life my life your
[1:21:10] body my body
[1:21:12] God revealed himself he is dwelling
[1:21:14] inside of this man I know this brother I
[1:21:16] know he's a shortcomings are sorry we
[1:21:19] are coming to church of 30 years
[1:21:22] I know all those things even more than
[1:21:24] all the others
[1:21:25] right right it doesn't work this way
[1:21:29] they were trying to catch Jesus and you
[1:21:32] were trying to catch Jesus they caught
[1:21:33] him
[1:21:36] they said how in the world in the
[1:21:38] Harvest time he was going the Sabbath
[1:21:39] and he was breaking the summer and
[1:21:41] taking the grain stealing you know and
[1:21:42] giving to his own disciples
[1:21:45] it couldn't be a messiah
[1:21:47] he felt the pain yes he healed the
[1:21:50] person he resurrected the boy but then
[1:21:52] he felt the pain and he sit down he
[1:21:54] cannot be Messiah
[1:21:57] all the leaders don't accept him
[1:22:01] it was the surroundings of the first
[1:22:03] coming
[1:22:04] but Jesus he fulfilled all the feasts
[1:22:08] now is the time for you and me
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:12] is a prize coming of Christ
[1:22:14] you have to experience that down Calvary

[1:22:57] this guy
[1:22:58] why we stand justified in Christ
[1:23:02] before him because he cannot pass
[1:23:05] judgment for he has already judged that
[1:23:08] body in which I am part of
[1:23:13] how am I part of it
[1:23:16] here is it
[1:23:17] here it is it's in me

[1:25:55] God built up for himself attend Jesus
[1:25:58] was the tent of the almighty one
[1:26:02] that's the reason he had to be crucified

[1:26:39] happened really in those days
[1:26:41] what happened in those days
[1:26:43] three men came to Abraham
[1:26:46] when he was in the tent with his wife
[1:26:49] he rushed to them and he greeted only
[1:26:51] one of the three he said welcome my Lord
[1:26:54] welcome Elohim
[1:26:57] what it was he was a God in history of
[1:27:00] funny in the flesh
[1:27:02] amen God created a body for Michael for
[1:27:06] Gabriel for himself
[1:27:08] he stepped in and he came to Abraham
[1:27:10] Jesus he said as it was in those days
[1:27:12] you will see in the end of the history
[1:27:14] of this world repetition
[1:27:18] so Abraham he killed the cars you know
[1:27:21] he prepared the the bread and they sit
[1:27:23] around the table having a fellowship

[1:27:54] theophanese and they said we would like
[1:27:56] to come down in flesh and eat and drink
[1:28:00] so how Abraham could sit together with
[1:28:02] the Elohim and with the two angels and
[1:28:04] eating and and rejoicing and being happy
[1:28:07] that he he honored my my home by his
[1:28:10] presence
[1:28:11] theophany doesn't drink and doesn't eat
[1:28:14] God was in the tea or funny living
[1:28:16] inside of the body but the body was a
[1:28:18] dust on the on the body was a hungry and
[1:28:21] thirsty wanted to eat and drink amen
[1:28:25] as it was in those days you will see in
[1:28:28] the last days amen
[1:28:30] very mysterious Feast of Tabernacles God
[1:28:34] can use not only one tent he had a 110
[1:28:37] he was a Jesus
[1:28:38] fullness of God badly in flesh but he
[1:28:42] promised the Feast of Tabernacles plural
[1:28:45] many Tabernacles many tens your ten my
[1:28:48] tent amen maybe a weak tent but God is
[1:28:51] living inside

[1:29:24] Holy Spirit
[1:29:25] God had a desire before the foundation
[1:29:27] of the world that's the reason he
[1:29:29] created your body knowing will be a
[1:29:31] problem with the body but he redeemed
[1:29:33] you he redeemed your soul your spirit
[1:29:36] and the body amen and soon you will be
[1:29:39] manifested because this body will be
[1:29:40] changed
[1:29:42] but now is God in the tent if you can
[1:29:45] recognize it
[1:29:46] threefold mystery
[1:29:49] that God had in his mind
[1:29:51] is a type
[1:29:53] of the three major Feasts
[1:29:55] God wanted to come down

[1:31:45] said how many churches they believed
[1:31:46] that there's that eight of 20. too much
[1:31:51] but he didn't teach us that we have to
[1:31:53] stay at home and push and play or just

[1:31:59] message because the spoken word is the
[1:32:01] original seat is still alive amen we

[1:32:07] will listen to tapes amen we love it and
[1:32:09] we we support it and everything but we
