[0:00] When Adam fell, he lost the title deed.
[0:05] That went back to God. In the book, and
[0:08] I don't know how to explain the book,
[0:10] but he said in the book was also all the
[0:12] names of all God's children that were to
[0:14] come into manifestation.
[0:16] So God took the book. Adam, Satan could
[0:19] not take it because he had no rights to
[0:21] it. So God had to watch over down
[0:23] through time to make sure that all of
[0:25] his children came into manifestation.
[0:28] That's right. Right?
[0:28] And then he had to watch over them. He
[0:30] had to lead them and he had to guide
[0:31] them so they could fulfill God's plan
[0:34] for their lives.
[0:35] Um and then when you begin to understand
[0:37] that the title deed,
[0:40] well, when you get into into into
[0:42] Revelation, John, you eat the book.
[0:46] What is the book? The title deed of
[0:48] redemption, the title deed to the earth,
[0:50] title deed to the rulership. So where is
[0:52] this title deed now?
[0:55] In us. Amen.
[0:56] Everything Adam lost as a result of the
[0:59] fall, we possess.
[1:02] But it'll only operate on our ability to
[1:05] believe it.
[1:06] The more that you understand God, the
[1:08] more you can take and you can begin to
[1:10] to apprehend and and and and over time I
[1:13] I mean, I've seen this manifested in
[1:15] different in different occasions. I know
[1:17] we were in Jamaica once and there was a
[1:19] hur tornado hurricane that was coming
[1:22] and it was going to go right over the
[1:23] top of us and we all prayed
[1:27] and we said well Lord if it comes right
[1:30] over the top of us
[1:32] there can be a lot of destruction so
[1:34] Lord would you just kind of move it for
[1:36] us we didn't ask for it to go away we
[1:38] just asked to move so instead of taking
[1:40] discourage all of a sudden it made a jog
[1:43] praise God
[1:44] because that's the power we have.
[1:48] I know. I was with my brother in
[1:50] Arkansas, I think it was, or one of
[1:51] those states down there. There was a
[1:53] tornado coming and we saw it coming and
[1:56] we looked for a place. Where could we
[1:58] go? Where could we hide? What could we
[1:59] grab hold of? And so I just says, "Well,
[2:02] Lord, just let it go around us." So it
[2:05] went from one to two, went around us,
[2:07] joined back together, and continued on
[2:09] its journey.
[2:11] I'm not trying to brag, but I'm merely
[2:13] trying to say that power we have.
[2:17] But and sometimes when we pray, we we
[2:19] don't realize what we are praying. We
[2:21] don't realize that here again it's God
[2:22] using our voice to be able to speak to
[2:24] be able to to achieve what we want. But
[2:27] you know, I begun to apply that in other
[2:28] areas of my life. If I get up in the
[2:31] morning and aches and pains that come
[2:33] with um maturing
[2:35] um I can look at myself and I can say,
[2:38] "Oh, it's going to be a terrible day. Oh
[2:40] man. Oh yeah. Oh, I overdid it
[2:42] yesterday. Oh, it's gonna be a horrible,
[2:44] horrible, horrible day. Well, I've just
[2:46] spoke it. Enjoy it.
[2:48] But I get up even with the eggs, same
[2:50] aches and pains. I say, "God has given
[2:51] me another day to enjoy him.
[2:54] God has given me another day to enjoy
[2:55] his presence, another day to worship
[2:57] him, another day to get into the word,
[2:59] another day to see his beauty all around
[3:01] me." And so now I've spoken that I
[3:04] expect a good day
[3:06] because I spoke it.
[3:07] Amen. Whatever I speak, that's what I
[3:10] expect.
