[0:00] is the book of life your marriage
[0:01] certificate was your name written there
[0:03] before the foundation of the world
[0:05] then what do you have to be worried
[0:06] about amen what what is all the struggle
[0:09] what is all the condemnation
[0:11] what is all about throw the condemnation
[0:13] away he chose you before the foundation
[0:15] of the world he has washed you in his
[0:17] own blood he has sealed you with his own
[0:19] life
[0:19] this is a day like no other day before
[0:22] there's no condemnation to the bride
[0:25] it doesn't mean that she won't fail it
[0:27] doesn't mean just like we watched with
[0:28] the wave chief brother branham's life
[0:30] he failed he he he had his wife lied to
[0:33] the lawyer
[0:33] he got a wrong spirit in the book and
[0:35] said something harsh about a brother
[0:38] god corrected him right in the pool but
[0:40] he said i shouldn't have said that it's
[0:41] not that the outer man won't make a
[0:43] mistake but the life on the inside will
[0:45] take control
[0:48] hallelujah sometimes we won't even
[0:52] accept what the prophet says about the
[0:54] bride
[0:54] until we've come to a perfect life and
[0:57] never making a mistake
[0:58] and i tell you friends if you try to get
[0:59] to that place before you accept what's
[1:01] been told
[1:02] you will never get there and you will
[1:04] never be able to
[1:05] you'll never be able to circumvent
[1:06] condemnation in your life amen feeling
[1:08] like i never measure up and i'm never
[1:10] good enough
[1:11] because you're trying to attain amen to
[1:13] something in the flesh
[1:14] that's going to require the change in
[1:16] your flesh
[1:18] [Music]
[1:20] and we're going to try amen trying
[1:24] to be perfect and once somehow uh we
[1:27] don't say this out loud this is not in
[1:29] our main conscience but subconsciously
[1:31] we're saying when i can be perfect amen
[1:33] when there's no longer a fault in me
[1:35] amen then maybe i can say what the
[1:37] prophet said about me
[1:38] but i'm telling you if you believe
[1:40] you're the bride of jesus christ you can
[1:42] say what the prophet said about you
[1:44] this is the word of god this is the
[1:46] promise that's in the scripture amen
[1:48] there is now
[1:49] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:50] christ jesus
[1:51] [Applause]
[1:53] no condemnation then why do i feel so
[1:55] condemned because you're letting the
[1:57] devil play in your mind
[1:59] amen you're letting him lie to you and
[2:01] you're not taking the word of god and
[2:02] driving back the enemy
