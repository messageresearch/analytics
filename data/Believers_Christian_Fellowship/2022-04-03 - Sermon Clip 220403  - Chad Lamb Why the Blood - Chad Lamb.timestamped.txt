[2:04] jesus christ
[2:07] that's it
[2:09] what are the rest what's the rest of the
[2:10] list brother john

[2:14] but i thought we had the the brother
[2:16] brother told us how a christian should
[2:18] dress and we shouldn't go to these
[2:19] certain places and how a mansion treats
[2:21] his wife and listen
[2:23] get the holy ghost and it'll take care
[2:25] of the rest of that amen

[2:29] the horse meet his requirements and
[2:32] repentance recognize you're wrong you're
[2:34] completely wrong you're all wrong and
[2:36] there's no way for you to be right
[2:40] but god made a way himself amen and if
[2:43] we accept that by faith and believe that
[2:46] it was for us recognizing our failure
[2:48] and repent and give our life to him and
[2:50] believe the whole world and are baptized
[2:52] in the name of the lord jesus christ he
[2:54] has given a promise god will not go back
[2:57] on that promise
[2:59] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[3:01] ghost when you receive the gift of the
[3:02] holy ghost then everything brother bam
[3:04] says in the message makes sense
