[0:00] you know there's a problem we can't bear
[0:01] with one another and the person we
[0:03] should look at is the person in the
[0:04] mirror and say God why can't I just die
[0:06] to myself why can't I stop defending
[0:08] myself why can't I stop getting offended
[0:10] why can't I stop being so
[0:13] hurt I mean there's reasons but we need
[0:15] God to heal us we can't just stuff these
[0:18] things down and put a jar a lid on the
[0:20] jar and act like they're not there but
[0:21] we need actual Deliverance ourselves in
[0:23] order to be F be able to flesh this out
[0:26] we need God's help and that's why it's
[0:28] so good to look at these things and say
[0:30] you know what this is the Commandment
[0:32] this is what Paul's telling us this is
[0:33] how we need to act with one another and
[0:35] if I can't come to this I need something
[0:37] more from God to work on me so that I
[0:39] can come to fulfillment of this
[0:41] scripture because this is the word and
[0:43] the word has to be made flesh and where
[0:45] is the word going to be made flesh in
[0:47] the bride amen are you part of the Bride
[0:50] then this word has to be made flesh in
[0:52] you and I it can't just stay on the
[0:54] pages of the Bible it can't be a good
[0:56] teaching it can't be a good idea it has
[0:58] to actually become flesh
[1:01] and how many of you think God wants us
[1:02] to flesh out this word this commandment
[1:05] from the Apostle Paul for the Saints do
[1:07] you think God wants us to flesh that out
[1:09] then how are we going to flesh it out
[1:10] unless somebody needs
[1:12] forgiven
[1:15] amen like we've been saying I I want I I
[1:18] want so bad for my attitudes to change I
[1:21] I'm praying about it all the time that
[1:23] God will get a hold of this vessel and
[1:24] help me die to the outer man because I I
[1:27] I I always look at offenses and it and
[1:29] then it always is the same story how
[1:31] could this be happening and why is this
[1:33] happening and why did they do this to me
[1:35] and blah blah blah blah blah and and I
[1:38] need to get past that where I can
[1:39] actually die to myself and it doesn't
[1:41] matter anymore for if God allows it it
[1:43] has a purpose and it gives me an
[1:45] opportunity to flesh out the very nature
[1:47] of Jesus
[1:49] Christ and what happens too often is I
[1:52] flesh out the nature of the old man of
[1:54] Chad Lamb and I'm tired of that guy I
[1:56] want to flesh out the very nature of
[1:58] Jesus Christ
[2:00] so God's going to give us lots of
[2:04] opportunities how many have had lots of
[2:06] opportunities well just hold on you're
[2:08] going to get some more because this has
[2:10] to be made flesh it has to be made flesh
[2:13] and you can say why did my brother do
[2:15] that to me well in order for you to
[2:17] forgive your brother you to F to fulfill
[2:20] the scriptures yes that's a scripture
[2:23] that has to be fulfilled in order to
[2:25] forgive a brother you have to some point
[2:28] along the way have to have a brother who
[2:29] needs forgiven amen right so you mean
[2:33] the very fact that I have a brother who
[2:35] needs forgiven is part of the
[2:40] word we can't fulfill the word unless we
[2:43] have the opportunity to fulfill the word
