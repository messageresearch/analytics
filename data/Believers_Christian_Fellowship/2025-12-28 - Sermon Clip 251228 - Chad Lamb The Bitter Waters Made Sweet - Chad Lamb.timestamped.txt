[0:00] He was the provision. He was the answer.
[0:04] ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO WATCH FOR HIM.
[0:06] AND WHEN HE CAME, they received him into
[0:08] the boat. And when they received him
[0:09] into the boat, instantly they WERE AT
[0:12] THEIR DESTINATION. THE PROBLEM WAS
[0:13] SOLVED. EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THEY WERE
[0:15] ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE PROVISION. AND THE VERY
[0:20] PROVISION SCARED THEM AT FIRST. THEY
[0:22] DIDN'T REALIZE THIS LOOKS SCARY. I DON'T
[0:24] UNDERSTAND THIS. WHY IS IT HAPPENING
[0:25] THIS WAY? THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAD THING.
[0:27] BUT IT WAS THE VERY THING THAT they
[0:29] needed. It was him coming on the scene.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "It is I. Be not
[0:38] afraid.
[0:39] Don't be scared. I've been watching you.
[0:41] Don't be scared. I've got a provision.
[0:43] DON'T BE SCARED. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO
[0:45] DELIVER YOU FROM THIS. I WAS ALWAYS
[0:47] GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH THIS TRI. I
[0:49] WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU TO THE
[0:50] OTHER SIDE. AMEN. I TOLD YOU TO GET IN
[0:52] THE boat to GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. I WILL
[0:54] TAKE CARE OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:00] Oh my. Hey, listen. We do what we can.
[1:03] We try with the ores and we try with the
[1:05] sail and we try. BUT SOMETIMES WE come
[1:07] to the end of any of our mental power,
[1:10] our ability, even sometimes to the end
[1:12] of our willpower. We've come to the end
[1:14] of all of our reasonings. We've come to
[1:16] the end of our strength. And sometimes
[1:17] you just lay in bed at night with tears
[1:19] rolling down your tree cheek and say,
[1:20] "God, I CAN'T DO IT ONE MORE DAY." AMEN.
[1:23] BUT INSTEAD OF GOING THERE, WHY DON'T WE
[1:25] GO TO GOD? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT
[1:27] YOU'RE GOING TO DO. YOU HAVEN'T led me
[1:29] here in vain. You've never forsaken YOUR
[1:31] CHILDREN. YOU'VE PROMISED TO LEAD AND
[1:33] GUIDE ME. YOU'VE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME
[1:34] ALWAYS. AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE LAY IN BED
[1:37] AND TURN EVIL INTO GOOD? WHY CAN'T WE
[1:39] TAKE AND BEGIN TO CONFESS THE WORD AND
[1:42] AND AND AND PREDICT GOOD, NOT EVIL?
[1:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE BE BELIEVERS
[1:49] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE WORD? Let's
[1:52] believe the word
[1:54] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF JUST GOING TO A SERMON AND
[1:55] HAVING IT PREACHED AND SAYING, "THAT'S
[1:57] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, BROTHER." AND THE
[1:58] NEXT TRIAL WE FALL TO PIECES AND FALL TO
[2:00] A A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE GROUND. WHY
[2:02] DON'T WE GO AND TAKE THE WORD AND SAY,
[2:05] "HE'LL NEVER LEAVE ME. HE'LL NEVER
[2:06] FORSAKE ME. HE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME
[2:08] ALWAYS. He's going to come on the scene.
[2:10] IF HE WALKS ON THE WATER, IF HE OPENS
[2:12] THE RED SEA, if he becomes the meal
[2:14] offering, if he's the TREE IN THE WATER,
[2:17] I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL COME, BUT I'M
[2:19] LOOKING FOR HIM TO come on the scene.
[2:21] YES.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; I'M CALLING FOR HIM TO COME ON THE
[2:24] SCENE. LORD, I NEED RESCUED. LORD, I
[2:26] NEED YOU. GOD, SHOW ME LIKE YOU SHOWED
[2:28] MOSES. WHERE IS YOUR PROVISION?
[2:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. There going to come a time this
[2:36] bride's going to be a believer of the
[2:37] word. NOT JUST A CONFESSOR, BUT a
[2:39] believer of the word. And she's going to
[2:41] act LIKE IT AND TALK LIKE IT AND STAND
[2:43] ON IT.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING TO HAVE PATIENCE. patience
[2:47] is going to do a perfect work where she
[2:49] that this BRIDE CAN ENDURE THROUGH EVERY
[2:51] TRIAL BEING STEADFAST AND FAITHFUL TO
[2:54] THE WORD.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; And you wonder why we go from trial to
[2:59] trial because that's the goal.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; To trust the Lord, to trust his word, to
[3:04] stand fast upon the word of God.
