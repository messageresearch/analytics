TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just remember take up your cross daily and follow me and the cross that he's talking cuz he was the innocent one he did nothing a Miss he did not deserve what happened to him it was my sins and your sins that put him there and listen whatever happened to you you have to come to that place and go I did nothing a miss many times we'll spend years blaming ourselves it was my fault they'll twist things and you don't get up in your mind and you think it no I had to sit across the table of that little itty bitty boy and I had to say Gabriel Smith it wasn't your fault you are innocent and when I did that it gave me such Freedom it gave me such Liberty to say it was not my fault and when you do that then you know what then I could I could really understand what Calvary was cuz I could really say yes Lord I don't need them I don't need them to apologize to me that's right cuz I'm forgiving them I I because I am a Christian I am Christlike that's right and I am forgien I'm not cutting him off never to talk to him again but I'm releasing them and what that does it's really empowering because what you say is I am going to pay the price is that not what Steph said when he was being stoned all he was doing was standing for the gospel and he was being an intercessor and he said Lord lay it not to their charge and and and and Paul Paul was standing there holding the coats but what he was doing was being an intercessor he was mediating he was portraying Christ and when we catch a revelation and we understand when we can go back to when we was a 6 8 10 12 year old little boy or girl and the most horriblest things happened to us and we was broken as broken could be but the whole you say brother Gabe I can't do it we can't that's right in our own selves that's right we cannot listen friend I I I know what pain is and I know what Brokenness is but I also know what freedom and liberty is and there is such a peace that happens when you're able to lay at that cross and say father forgive them amen
