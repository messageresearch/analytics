[2:17] place he was looking for a
[2:23] body Hallelujah and that body church we
[2:26] must accept that his coming or allow me
[2:30] to say his
[2:33] appearance his appearance is a proof

[2:56] God telling this we should not doubt it
[2:58] anymore amen because he he he told us I

[3:05] down unless the body is ready
