[0:00] so what is end time Evangeline finding
[0:02] the stones and it's also shaping the
[0:03] stones
[0:05] so now it you can take this and this is
[0:08] where I want to take this understanding
[0:10] you can take this and say okay we we
[0:14] have to shape people into sons of God
[0:16] well my goodness you can shape all day
[0:19] long if they're not already sons of God
[0:20] you're not going to shape them in the
[0:22] sons of God
[0:24] all the preaching and all the shaping
[0:26] and all the doctrine and all the rules
[0:28] and all the legalism none of it will
[0:30] ever turn anybody into a Son of God but
[0:32] brother Brenham says you have to shape
[0:34] them and get them to quit this and stop
[0:35] that and square them up and get them to
[0:37] fit in
[0:39] it can be confusing it's like so do we
[0:42] shape them or or how do we shape them
[0:44] and listen all that we're doing amen is
[0:48] we're taking the word of God and we're
[0:49] presenting the word of God and that word
[0:51] of God Amen will cause somebody to
[0:54] reject part of their natural life and
[0:56] for forsake their own thinking and
[0:58] forsake their habits forsake their
[1:00] family tradition lay them all down so
[1:02] that the Son of God that's on the inside
[1:04] can grow to manifestation and not be
[1:08] hindered by the hindrances of the
[1:09] outside man
[1:11] to me this is shaping the stones
[1:14] not making something that's not a son
[1:18] into a son but no by the word of God by
[1:21] the preaching by the fellowship by
[1:23] whatever tool God uses amen taking and
[1:26] lopping off the things that aren't in
[1:28] the seed amen lopping off things that
[1:31] are hindering the growth just like the
[1:33] father is the husband man what's the
[1:34] husband been doing he's cutting off
[1:36] everything that's not bearing fruit snip
[1:38] snip snip snip snip
[1:40] he's not making it a Vine he's not
[1:44] making it a branch he's not turning it
[1:46] into something it's not what he's doing
[1:48] is the husbandman has found a Vine he's
[1:52] found a branch and that branch has the
[1:55] potential to bear fruit it's an original
[1:56] it's taking life out of the root so
[1:59] what's he doing he's he's clipping off
[2:01] everything that's dead and he's taking
[2:03] the vine and he's cleaning it purging it
[2:06] bringing it up putting it into place so
[2:07] that it can manifest the life that's on
[2:10] the inside of it
[2:13] so for me shaping the stones is not
[2:15] turning something that's not a son into
[2:17] a son it's not making somebody look like
[2:20] a Christian act like a Christian amen go
[2:22] along with Christians that's not in time
[2:25] evangelism end time evangelism is
[2:27] preaching the word of God because the
[2:29] word of God is calling for the life to
[2:32] come out of the seed
[2:34] it's calling for manifestation it's
[2:37] drawing life out but the word of God is
[2:39] also corrective it's also telling you
[2:41] what's not the life of Christ what is
[2:44] not his motive what is not his objective
[2:46] what is not his goal in this day what
[2:48] his character is not so that you can
[2:50] repent and say God forgive me take that
[2:53] out of my life a husbandman come and
[2:55] prune this out of me
[2:57] so that I can be the full potential of
[3:00] the life of the inside
