take control and have your Liberty as we surrender ourselves aresh to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing together if you could take your Bibles we'll turn together to the Book of Genesis chapter 3 and I want to let you know that uh tomorrow evening I'll be doing the church age book Bible study we'll be doing the next section I'm sorry I didn't give you much notice but with the visitors coming and all the schedule being a little bit shifted for me I just pulled the trigger yesterday and made a final decision or Sunday made a final decision Sunday evening and uh we'll do it tomorrow for those who can make it in the fellowship hall at 630 we'll get into the next part of the church age book Bible study also wanted to remind you that brother Samuel walk will be coming this weekend he'll be preaching here Sunday morning so please be praying for him and also he'll be preaching at the youth meeting in the afternoon at the wert's place and so please please remember that in prayer as well amen we want to remember brother Michael and sister Maran as they head home that we'll be praying for them on Friday may God bless you we've enjoyed having you and take our love back home amen man God bless you let's look at Genesis chapter 3 uh chapter 3 :4 Genesis 3:4 the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat amen God bless you as you have your seats may God bless us as we look at his word amen so I want to continue on from Sunday and uh but I have a different title and I want to conclude with maybe something a little different a little different angle but the same theme the same thought uh in some ways and for a title I'd like to take the seed and the garden the seed and the garden and then a subtitle controlling life and uh uh hopefully we'll it'll all come together I just trust trust that God will bring it all together for us when we look here we want to remember what we were talking about uh on Sunday we were talking about the rise of the woman how the woman is coming to power and control in this end time and we know it's a spirit it's the spirit of the false church it's the spirit the female dominating Spirit that's taking over the entire world and we see it manifest so many ways and as I was uh going through that on Sunday and meditating on it and doing some more reading it just kept growing and growing and so they're just one more aspect I'd like to bring to your attention I want to re read a quote from the thyon church age that I read Sunday uh out of the church age book it said it is most worthy of note that the very name thyra means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world I think that's amazing that brother Bram said of all the greatest curse in the world is a dominating female and uh we talked about it Sunday but I just want to uh review so we can carry on Amen all the way back in the Garden of Eden I mean this is why brother Brandon when he makes these statements he makes statements and he makes strong statements and and and and uh and he really starts to really labor on the condition of the world the the condition of society the condition of women the things that were changing all around him in politics and society and in churches and he starts to show the condition of things and there's a and because the prophet is seeing a spirit behind it he's seeing the spirit of the church falling away and it's showing up on the women in a physical way and so he really starts to rail on this and he starts to to Really labor and spend time on it amen and and and and I love it because it seems in some ways especially if you read it with a a mindset of 2024 it seems like he's so hard and so straight but he knows exactly what he's talking about amen because he sees Spirits behind things and why they are the way they are and he can tie what he's seeing today with what happened in the Garden of Eden amen because there the woman took the leadership outside of the leadership of a man and outside the leadership of a woman outside the leadership of the word she took leadership and brought death and brought ruination and that's what happens every time the woman takes the lead and so there's all types of woman there's a nation is a woman a church is a woman a a mother and a wife is a woman amen and so we ourselves as the church are typed as the woman and whenever the woman takes the lead or takes control outside of the headship of the word it'll bring death and so brother R is is is nailing these things down in the culture social issues news issues he's looking at these things and and they they're not just news to him they're not just political happenings they're not just a change in Society to him it's showing the condition of the world at the end time because that Spirit that's been going all along and growing is coming to fullness and the same thing's true for us he began to point it out so that we can now see it again in the tharan church as he said from the Garden of Eden onward women has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man so that's been a problem that's been a battle that's been going on for ages and here we find it hey friends it's coming to its climax it is absolutely coming to its climax it is all around us brother benam said uh how many years ago 60 years ago it's a woman's world and I'm telling you it's it's the way it is right now we see that environment all around us and and let's look at Genesis chapter 2 now let's go back Genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 Genesis 2 and 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so all the way back in the beginning God he had had given a command to the man to multiply and replenish the Earth and then then he had formed the man into a a a a vessel of the earth he made him flesh and put him in the uh Earth in the garden and then he found that the man was alone and he said it's not good that man shall be alone I will make a help meat for him so God is the one who's instituting all of these things amen he put man in flesh but inside the man was both men male and female amen inside one vessel but God was going to separate now the feminist spirit and he took a rib out of Adam and split the feminist and masculine Spirit put the feminist Spirit into the woman and now he United back together Amen in what brother B said called the the the first the first Union the first marriage all the way back in the Garden of Eden so it shows that it's God's institution it's God's plan it's God's desire it's God's way and he said that now he he he he saw that the man was alone so he made a help me for the man and now there's a prophecy of multiply and replenish and the woman no doubt knows the prophecy but but the but the serpent comes along to beguile the woman and begins to get her to look at this thing she's not supposed to look to and and he says for God does know in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil so he tempted her with this saying and brother mam says she thought she was doing right she was trying to do right she was trying to keep the word but she went down the road of reason reing an intellect in her own feelings and she left the headship of the word amen to do so it says and then the woman saw the tree was good for food here we go right to the senses right to the intellect she saw that it was good for food that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise and she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat right there the woman took the leadership and it brought death she went before the B she went first she went outside of headship and she took the leadership she took control she took control of the situation not because she wanted to be evil but because she thought she was doing good but she went down the road of reasoning and feelings and senses and she took control she took the leadership and she brought death amen so we're on the same page praise God let's keep going now in the church age book in the pergan church age section we read just a bit of this before but it's the section where the angel told Brother bam to pick up his pen and write and so in the church age book it's an it's it's italicized because he said it's a message amen from the uh from the Lord to his bride to the church and so he says the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die amen so why was the woman given to the man was it because God saw the man was lonely he made a help me for him but he was given a wife to reproduce himself that's why she was given all right we're together let's keep moving 1 Corinthians 11 I just want to lay in a little Foundation here and start building off of it 1 Corinthians 11 in verse 8 1 Corinthians 11:8 Paul is going to bring us back to this understanding and he's going to he's teaching the church here 1 Corinthians 11:8 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man that goes all the way back to Eden she's come out of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God so now the man never came uh from the woman but the woman was from the man and thenan the man wasn't made for the woman but the woman was made for the man to serve a purpose to be a help meet and to help him reproduce himself on the the Earth all right but now because they chose they chose sex by sex desire God said if you want to go that way then that's fine and so now amen now that's that's how reproduction is coming upon the Earth amen from the time of the Fall so now he's saying that that man is now not independent of the woman because man has now come through the woman The Woman come out of the man she's from the man he's not from her and he's not for her she's for him but he's not independent of her because now if any man's going to be born on the Earth he's got to come through the woman there's a partnership so that a man can reproduce himself upon the Earth and in order to reproduce himself upon the Earth he's going to have to have a wife he's going to have to have a woman he's going to have to have a womb there's going to be a womb somewhere that he can so seed into to reproduce himself upon the Earth all right there we go praise God now I want to read this quote uh and why we are not a denomination from 1958 said that's all we can do but look Brethren then God reconciled or recognized Abraham's Faith he give him the seal a sign of circumcision as a seal of the Covenant see he said now Abraham I recognize your faith so I'm going to give you a sign now that I have received you so he circumcised Abraham and that was a seal of the Covenant and now in this day now a woman could not be in that Covenant only a married woman well it's obvious that a woman couldn't be in it because the sign of the Seal of the Covenant was circumcision and a woman can't receive circumcision so the only way she can is under the headship of her father who's under the Seal of circumcision or under the headship of her husband who's under the Seal of circumcision but a woman independently couldn't be under that seal without headship amen and so now I want to read that again now a woman could not be in the covant and only a married woman we find out couldn't circumcise a female so it had to come in so her and her husband are one they're not no more two they are one how many knows that the scripture says so so her being married then she become one and go on down here and look over here in Timothy said the same thing now not withstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continues in faith and Holiness with all sobriety so as I was uh look looking at this whole uh scene this political scene and the social scene that's going on all around and looking at the things that brother Brenham had said and all the things that we went into Sunday there was something that kept popping up over and over as a major theme through this last political season and it had to do with Reproductive Rights for women I don't know if you know that was a major issue it was a major issue and and and there come a motto that said my body my choice my body my choice voice and it was all about abortion it was all about uh uh uh birth control and the woman's right to control her own body amen but I began to look at this because it becomes a major issue and it had to become a major issue because we're in the end time and and everything has to come to full full fruition or full manifestation in the end time and I began to look at this and and I I I read an article back in July uh of this year where the Republican Party changed their platform that they had for 40 years where on the platform they were dedicated to reversing Row versus Wade amen and and putting a ban on abortion but in July under the uh uh under the headship of Donald Trump they knew they couldn't win an election that way because of the popular vote of women women have the power in this country I'm telling you statistically they've got 53% of the vote they have the majority vote women have the majority vote so they have to to the desire of the women in order to win an election so Donald Trump could not run on this platform so he gets the Republican party to abolish that and he does it cleverly getting it off his hands by saying it's a state issue not a federal issue we'll push it off to the states and they have to deal with it amen it wasn't be oh my goodness it was a political move so that he could win an election because of the popular vote of women has everything to do with women yes they're controlling the whole show amen and so when they did that they put it off to the states well I watched in this last election they had 10 state issues 10 different states had issues on abortion on and it wasn't whether to allow it or not they all already allow abortion it was either to uh entrench it in their in their own state constitution with an amendment to expand it to reinforce it so or give more rights in abortion and out of 10 races 71 three lost so they pushed it to the States but it didn't matter because the popular vote of the women moved it anyways it was all a political move it's coming anyways and then the churches who are supposed to be amen against abortion against all of this they they still side amen with this party even though they changed the platform they still side they still align they still pray for Trump they still pray to they still do all of that why because it's their only hope for any control whatsoever amen but they're already delving in the Realms of compromise because they've left the word and trying the woman's trying to take power by reasoning by senses amen by education by intellect she's trying to take power and dominion and control but she's left the word and has no more power by the word and now she's moved by moving into the politics you automatically move into the realm of compromise yeah because politics is built on compromising so that we can move an agenda and as soon as the church aligns with politics they move to compromise and they've all they've listen they've given up the fight on Banning abortion just go read some articles they've given it up what they're trying to do now is Ban late term abortion and they're losing that cuz it's a woman's world because it's a woman's world and so as I as I looked on that I mean many of us know those things we've looked at those things and and none of that's new we've been seeing that it's been going that way for for decades now but as I began to look at what was being said and even today uh when vice president Harris conceded she she talked about she's always going to fight for the Reproductive Rights of woman to make decisions for her own body and that's reasonable it's reasoning and blah blah blah but when it comes down to it it's absolutely Antichrist it's so far off the word it couldn't be any farther off of the wood because that's denying the very purpose for God bringing a woman onto this Earth she created women in the beginning so that Adam could reproduce himself on the earth and now what she's trying to do is take control of the very Purpose with which God made her and deny the very Purpose with which God made her and become a goddess herself to control this thing that God built her for amen it's it's horrible let's go to Matthew 19 now don't worry I'm not here to give a speech on abortion it's a sign it's just a physical sign showing there's a spirit behind it and that's what I want to look at is the spirit behind it Matthew 19:4 and this is now Jesus being questioned by the Pharisees on a marage and divorce he says have you not read verse four and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them in the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put us under amen go and let before I go on let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 now I want to catch that right here while I'm here Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians 5 and verse 30 for for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church that's why this issue is so important because this is just a manifestation of a great mystery and that mystery is Christ and his church and now when you see what the people are doing it's only manifesting what the churches are doing yeah man they're trying to take control of life amen and and they're trying to to to take it out of the man's hands and take it into their own hands yeah amen if I could uh yeah let me go here to First Timothy there some interesting things that brother brandham says here 1 Timothy Chapter 2 1 Timothy CH 2: 13 says for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness and sobriety I'm going to get to this scripture in just a minute but when when you start to hear hear the motto my body my choice amen there's such a Defiance in that there's a Defiance of male and and and then they make statements like no man is going to tell me what I can do with my body but then you deny the very reason God made a woman to begin with because she's to be a help meet to a man and she's to become one flesh with a man so that he can reproduce himself on the earth and she's saying no you can't use my body for that I'm in control amen but Jesus says that they're one amen Adam and Eve were one a man and his wife when they're joined together are one even a man that joins himself to a harlot becomes one flesh with her and she starts saying my body my body my body and not recognizing that that body was built and made to become part of a man to come into Union with a man under the headship of a man to reproduce that man upon the Earth not so you could take control amen if you want to take control that brings us right back to the Garden of Eden where you want to control how life's going to come forth yeah this is a huge issue friends and I'm not talking about the social issue I'm talking about the issue of the churches trying to take control over receiving the seed oh my goodness say God help us help us come to a full realization of what what we should be doing what our purpose is on the earth why Christ has a bride amen not so that we can say my body my choice not my body not my choice he purchased me with his blood it's it's not my choice it's not my decision it's his decision I don't control life life comes from him it's not up to me it's up to him I'm not taking the leadership the only thing I can do is surrender to his leadership and lay myself down under his authority and he's got life his word is life his seed is life and all the only thing I can do is surrender to that life and receive that life and bring forth that life but I cannot control that life I cannot control the male I cannot control the life right oh praise God you see what this this whole abortion and this whole birth control and this whole fertility rights has to do with has everything to do with putting the woman in control of when and where and how life will come forth and now it's not up to the man but brother Brenham said The Germ of life is in the man the man's carrying the life not the woman she can't bring forth life without the man because she's dependent on the man for life she's got to find a way to take control over the man's life stream yeah right my my my my God help us look at the day we live in friends look at how absolutely Wicked it is Satan's Eden has come to its peak the things that have begun the seeds that have been swn they're coming to full fruition and they're everywhere they're all around us and what was absolutely Dreadful just 60 70 years ago is becoming so common openly talked about accepted and celebrated and praised we look at this scripture now referring back to the Garden of Eden again in Timothy for Adam was first formed in Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing listen this is an odd scripture has anybody else read this and said this is I don't quite understand it clearly I I'm still there okay I'm not telling you I got the perfect definition of this I've read this for years amen and there's only a little bit that brother bandam says about it and we're going to look at one aspect of it but it's tied all the way back to the Garden of Eden it's tied to the original purpose of the woman it's tied to the fall it's tied to the deception right so Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety and you look at that and say okay so the only way for a woman to be saved is if she has a baby what if she never gets married what if she gets married and never has a baby so this can't be what the scripture is telling us that's the only way she can be saved but it's showing a picture it's telling us something that has to do with the woman being in the transgression and Adam not being deceived but she was in questions and answers brother BS asked this question about what this means he says not by having a baby makes her saved but because that she is raising raing children doing her Duty raising children doing her Duty not raising cats dogs and what more to take the place of a child as they do today giving it a mother's love so that she can go out and run around all night some people do that sorry but they do it that's awful rude for me to say it but the truth is the truth they don't want a baby to be tied down with but in childbearing if she continues in faith Holiness and all sobriety she'll be saved but the if is you shall be saved too if you're born again if you you can be healed if you believe you can receive the Holy Ghost if you believe it get ready for it if you're ready for him and she shall be saved if she keeps doing these other things so brother random he says but not because she's a woman so brother Bram was not saying and brother B in another place he said that's a Catholic doctrine that the woman has to if she marri she has to bring forth children she's saved and child bearing he said that's a Catholic Doctrine he said he didn't believe in that but what he's showing is the woman was made for an original purpose and when she submits to that purpose when given the opportunity amen God blesses it and God loves it and this is part of the Redemption of the woman because she's the one who chose sex in the beginning because she chose sex by sex desire that's now how everybody's going to be born on this Earth and now in order for her to redeem herself she must play her part that doesn't mean if you're not married or if you can't have a child that you're not included no what what it's saying is if you've got the opportunity but you refuse you don't want to give your body you don't want to give your time you don't want to give yourself to your husband you don't want to give up your career you don't want to give up your social life you don't want to give up but you want to preserve my body my decision that's absolutely evil amen because the woman was made to bring life on this earth when she denies that she denies the very purpose for which she's made that's what's going on friends she's trying to change her purpose oh yeah she wants to take the man's place she wants to be the leader she wants to be the boss she wants to be have the education she wants to make the decisions and she knows if she Ms submits herself to this realm to the headship of a man to bring forth children she will hinder herself in competition with the man yeah right so she is denying her purpose yes and choosing her own purpose her god-given purpose and choosing her own purpose the church is doing the same thing same exact thing in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother re says the complete total insanity this world will go into right away it's almost here now while you see the footsteps of it there it's marching right out on the street right down the church pew total in sanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being civilized look what Hollywood has done to the woman look how it's it's robbed the sacred virtues of woman on and on we could go see all this she lost how did she do it because there was a subtle instrument called The Church like there was in the Garden of Eden a subtle person the devil walked into the church just like he did in the Garden of Eden and deceived her into it she is deceived the woman thinks she don't mean mean to be wrong Eve didn't mean to do wrong it wasn't willfully the Bible said in second Timothy 1 Timothy 3 she was deceived and deceived is not when you willfully do it it's when you're deceived into doing it and that's just exactly what happened today she's been deceived by television by magazine by these people this all these fine things that they're going out on the street modern girls they look at magazines they look at pictures they look on the street they see the clothing in the shops how Satan that great instrument of hell has come down amongst the people and and deceive them into these things and the woman thinks she's all right and she is dead and don't know it she is as far from God see how she lost all this and how subtle it was today I want you to notice Jesus spoke of it also you'd like to read it Jesus made mention that this thing would come to pass did you know that in the last hours just before his crucifix just let's just read it uh in Luke the 23rd chapter beginning the 27th verse I believe I got it marked out here uh let's listen St Luke 23:27 I believe it is he says and there followed him a great company of people and women which also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming and they that they shall say blessed are the barren and the wound that never bear and the PS which never gave suck brother brandham is he's attaching it right to the woman losing her sacred virtues because of Hollywood and modern culture think today a disgrace for her to have a child then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and Hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall they do in a dry speaking of the day that when women wouldn't no more want children they want a dog or a cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore why she's old mother hubard if she has a child she don't want that's the remarks of Hollywood it don't want this woman to be an old mother hubber so she'll he'll have some operation performed to himself or her one that'll keep them from having children they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on us she'll practice birth control so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with baby a baby nursing her it'll disform her when she's pregnated it'll be it'll this former she won't look like she used to and her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a Child Jesus spoke of it and he said when they're doing this at that time they'll go to cry for crying then for the rocks to fall on them it's the coming of the Lord are we here have we arrived is it the talking point in the news is it the issue is it the debatable issue of the day is it the thing that's being promoted and protected and glorified listen it it it's it's right in front of us and has everything to do with life and has everything to do with the way life comes has everything to do with who's going to control the coming forth of life and the woman wants control because the church wants control but we don't want control there's a true bride who wants to be submissive to her headship and she doesn't want tool control anything all she wants to do is say Lord I'm here I'm Yours anytime you want to use me use me my body is yours my mind is yours my mouth is yours I'm all yours I have no agenda of my own no motive of my own I don't need Amen to accomplish anything amen listen to what brother B says in power of transformation he says now he had 6,000 years to do it with his poison spray and how did he do it now this is a striking part and listen close he did it by Civilization now that sounds strange but that's what I'm going to make a statement here that will keep you guessing maybe for a few minutes I hope not but did you realize this now I'm not trying to support ignorance but did you know that Civilization Science Education and the things that we cherish so great today is the very instrument of Satan even civilization civilization never come by God civilization come by Satan now I'll prove that to you by the word just in a few minutes civilization is not of God for let me show you in this civilization the more civilized we get as we work through science we are always killing ourselves see and this civilization has built up to this Pinnacle now and we got death in this civilization we got sin in the civilization we got sickness in the civilization that can't be of God man you realize that Civilization is that's what we're living in Satan's even come to the Pinnacle civilization and Science and education do you know that that that the ones who are promoting this agenda this abortion agenda are the educated women right not the non-educated women they start doing polls the ones who are pushing for it the ones are are taking advantage of it the ones who want uh fertility rights and all of that are the educated women amen some of the humble women are still happy to get married and still happy to have a baby and still happy to take care of their children by Science Education civilization man is killing himself he's become an absolute Barbarian amen by trying to educate and civilize and become better and greater and greater and control everything till he's got to a place where there where where men and women I I mean heathenistic aboriginies and the pygmy Indians in the middle of Africa who can't read or write won't kill their children they will have babies and call it a blessing the most ignorant the most uneducated have the most basic fundamental of humanity in mind this is the survival of the human race and we so become so educated and so civilized and have so much scientific understanding that we absolutely will destroy the furthering of the human race by what civilization it looks like such a great thing we we got schools and we got education and we got listen it's the college campuses that is pumping this out it's the college campus that are teaching the women these things and it's passing all the way down through Hey listen this is not godliness this is Antichrist this is off the word this is Satan's Eden and it's a way for man in his intellect and his wisdom and his abilities to kill himself by destroying his offspring you don't have absolutely nobody to take care of him at the end of life you have a woman woman that gets trapped into this doesn't want to get married or she gets married wants to maintain her career wants to be a lawyer wants to be a CPA wants to do all these things wants to achieve high ranking positions finally she gets so so so of age she tries to have a baby she can't have a baby she lives the rest of her life without it her and her husband get old and then what do they do they made money they stockpiled money they put it away they have retirement they have 401ks they have all of that so that they could pay a nursing home because they have nobody to take care of them when they get older what have they done civilization education science they destroy themselves absolutely foolishness for what I will decide my body my choice evil statement let's go to Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter 1 go to verse 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools that's this modern civilization it's all these agendas that's all of that's what's pushing empowering the woman is death bringing her into rulership is death allowing her to take the lead brought death when she went first when she took the lead when she used the reasoning and Science and education to make the decision on how this word will be fulfilled she brought death to the human race listen this is why brother brandham is hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering he said when a woman gets out of the kitchen she gets out of her place he says statements like uh a woman doesn't know which side of the house she belongs on listen we're we're in I mean we're in the Pinnacle of Leo deia right now in women's rights you go around work and start spewing that stuff out and see how well that goes but he was trying to point out what was going on in the society where he was seeing drastic changes in the conduct of women and the way families are structured and the way homes operate and the way women operate dress themselves conduct themselves and take care of their families and brother bandam says when you break motherhood you break the backbone of a country he saw the collapse of civilization and the collapse of motherhood when the woman was given a position that she should never have so he starts hammering the way she dresses he starts hammering I'm not into this modernistic idea of women working a woman should be at home a keeper he starts hammering all of these stuff what's he trying to do he's trying to show us the world's going in the the wrong direction this is not God's way this is this is Eden but we're supposed to be coming back and reversing eaten 1 Corinthians 3 let's turn there quickly 1 Corinthians chapter 3 1 Corinthians 3:18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain listen brother bam said the old mammies in Kentucky know better yeah than the modern women yeah I'm telling you the the ignorant of the ignorant somewhere out in the jungle somewhere know better than this modernistic American woman and man too oh yeah so we see that the whole thing has gone the wrong way because a woman wants to say I control when life comes forth and I decide if you'll use my body for life to come or not you see mankind shaking his fist in the face of God right and it has to do with same-sex marriage gender confusion G self- gender selection and all these other it's all the same thing it's everybody looking at God and saying I can do whatever I want but God's put you on free moral Agy do whatever you want that's fine but you're destroying Yourself by what civilization science and education oh let me be an ignorant Bible believer let me be somebody doesn't know the ways of the world and maybe I don't so much know how to fit into society and I can't quite cope with the way things are but let me cope with this Amen Let Me Be ignorant to The Wilds of the world maybe a little poorly educated maybe not well spoken and maybe not able to keep up with things but if I can just stick with this word and surrender it everything will be fine let my wisdom become foolishness that I can become wise in God cuz his wisdom is greater than the wisdom of the world his foolishness is greater than the wisdom of the world Amen in the pergan church age I'm going just the next step now in this pick up your pin and WR section so he told us first that Adam was given a bride to reproduce himself on the Earth but then he says the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with the Beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest it wasn't a scripture it was a person The Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest where was he going to be made manifest in her through her but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her what did she have to do just accept just receive the word which is the seed and the seed has its own life and it'll produce its own life amen you remember when we we were been speaking of Abraham and Sarah so many times and and Abraham remember brother B said because Abraham and Sarah were married that Sarah was part of Abraham and when God came in flesh to the tent and began to discern amen the thoughts in Sarah's heart and the T behind him amen she denied what he had said lied to his face and God said brother said God would have struck her dead then but he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham she was part of Abraham amen that means Sarah couldn't say my body my choice no it was Abraham's body that's why Eve the woman in the Garden of Eden she couldn't say my body my choice no no no no no amen that was Adam's Body because he called their name Adam he put them together they were one flesh in the guys Eyes Of God they were one and when you're joined to your wife you're one there's no more my body my choice no amen that's not what God wanted he wanted the two to become one that's God's purpose that was God's intention in the beginning the two to become one and so now God could not fulfill the promise through any other vessel but then part of Abraham because the promise was to Abraham that out of his loin shall come a son that shall inherit amen so there could be no nothing else but part of Abraham to produce the promise to Abraham that's why when they tried to take Hagar and produce through Hagar would never work Hagar wasn't part of Abraham amen Sarah was part of Abraham and when the promise was to Abraham it was to Sarah also she was included amen what Abraham needed Abraham needed a womb and Abraham had one and his wife because they were one flesh can you imagine her trying to deny him the right to bring forth a promised seed and works as Faith expressed brother B starts picking up this about Mary the Virgin Mary he says now notice Mary now says now Lord wait a minute I never knowed a man this is impossible nothing like this never happened oh oh no nothing like this ever happened how am I going to have this baby I don't know any man so it can't happen uh angel you're just mistaken I've got an iCal illusion you know my church says these days are gone nah it would never have fell in such a place like that Mary never questioned he says she said how can it be I know no man he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee that's how it's going to happen she said behold the hands made of the Lord no question no question see Isaiah when God produced the word by thought Revelation Into the Heart of Isaiah it fell into the right grounds it was a prophet the prophet didn't care for any man's Wisdom he didn't care for any man's intellectual he didn't care about the person of anybody he was a dedicated channel to God and God spoke and God spoke and he spoke that's all whether it hurt whether it didn't whether it sounded crazy whether it didn't sound crazy didn't make any difference to him it was God not the man and when the word went forth now it becomes a seed it has to fall somewhere if God said it there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into so Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that was God he didn't worry about the science the education he didn't worry about the civilization he didn't worry about whether it made sense or didn't make sense he just said what God Said a virgin shall conceive that that word was a seed that seed moved out it had to find a good ground to get planted in it had to find a womb somewhere and that somewhere was the Virgin Mary amen and when the angel of the Lord came to the Virgin Mary when Gabriel came to the Virgin Mary and said listen now it's you you're the one that's going to happen to you she said how's that possible I don't know a man he said the Holy Ghost should overshadow you she said be it unto me according to your word not let me think about it not give me some time you know I've got my own plans I want to accomplish some things in life I I I'm going to Bear a reproach you know I I I will become pregnant it'll change the way I walk it'll change my life it'll take over me it'll change my physique it'll change my plans it it yeah she didn't care about her plans she didn't care about her physique she didn't care about anything the word had come to her and there was something in her that says I'll receive that seed you can have my body you can have my womb you can have my whole life if it brings me rejection if it brings me if it if it ruins my future marriage to Joseph whatever happens happens it doesn't matter cuz I'm not here to dictate how life will come I'm not here to control life I'm not here to control the word control the SE control life I'm only here to receive the seed to give it a place to come forth on this Earth amen we are the garden that God wants to plant his seed in he's the gardener he has the seed he wants to plant his seed in the in in in his garden amen and it's not up to the Garden it's up to the gardener it's up to the male not to the female and the garden can't say you can't plant that seed now I'm not ready when he was ready he came to Mary Mary didn't say well give me 10 more months let me go I want to get my degree first I want to I want to see if I can become CEO I want to Mary's our example not this modern Church who's got agendas and wants to accomplish things and they don't want to surrender to the word of God because it would take over their bodies it would change their walk they couldn't keep doing what they want they can't go on with their own agendas and their own program and their own ideas and their own scientific achievement and their own accomplishments they're going to have to be bear reproach they're going to have to be rejected they're going to have to give up their life in order what in order to receive this seed that comes from Christ that's why the churches the churches are trying to control the life they're trying to decide listen can you imagine the garden telling the gardener you can plant listen you can plant figs but you can't plant out you can plant daffodils but don't do lies that's what the church is doing yeah right I'll take that commandment but I'm not going to take that one I'll take this word but I don't think that counts for today anymore and the church is trying to control life and Satan zeden brother B says having faith in all his word his seeds his seeds brought an Eden of Holiness love and eternal life God had swed seeds and he knew the power that was in the seed and that seed in the right condition had brought forth a perfect Eden and it had brought forth an Eden of Holiness love and eternal life that's what God's Eden produced Holiness and it brought an Eden of Holiness of love understanding Perfection eternal life that's what God is planting his word his seed that's what his church will be at the end it'll be the same thing what will this church be at the end she'll be the Garden of Eden and what's he going to plant in her he's going to plant all his seeds of his word in her and he's going to have a garden of Holiness and love and understanding and Perfection once again where's it going to be where's this life going to come up and begin to flourish and Bloom and bear fruit it's going to come in The Bride of Jesus Christ which is his garden which will be eaten again for him yeah turn with me to Song of Solomon I'll finish almost finished hey we're doing good on time you're pulling fast let's go to the Song of Solomon and let's go to chapter 4 Song of Solomon 4:12 he says a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed now he's talking about a woman he's describing a woman and he's describing her as a garden enclosed that means it's got a wall around it a fountain sealed this is showing that she's separated she's separated by a wall and she's a virgin she's a fountain seal and he's talking about a woman a woman who's separated and guarded from outside influences and she's a fountain sealed she's she's in a virgin condition separated and virgin this is the type of the Bride of Jesus Christ says a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse who's the sister and spouse of Jesus Christ how much I'm sorry uh a spring shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits campfire with nerd nerd and safron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myr and allows with all the cheap spices a fountain of gardens a well of Living Waters and streams from Lebanon this is what the bride is to the bridegroom this is what he's trying to produce he's trying to sew the seeds of his word to bring back his garden bring back life bring back fruit bring back fragrance bring back everything that was lost but then here the bride speak to the bridegroom awake Oh north wind and Come Thou South blow upon my garden that the spices thereof May flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits here we see a picture of the gardener the garden the garden is the bride the one who planted the seed The Gardener the one who's caretaking it the one who wants to enjoy it amen is the bridegroom and and he found her a Walled Garden and enclosed garden and a fountain seal and planted all of this inside of her and now she's bringing forth the fruit of the word all of the word not just one thing not just two things look at all the list amen she's bringing forth the full life of the full manifestation of all the word amen and she's saying come into your garden enjoy it it's all for you amen I'm I'm here for you I I want to be here for him seow your seed in me SE all your seed in me whatever you want to plant here's a garden amen if you want to plant Holiness planted if you want to plant whatever gift whatever thing you want to plant if you want me to dress a certain way I'll dress that way you want me to conduct myself I'll conduct myself separate I'll separate I'll do whatever your word says because I want to be the garden that you can plant your seeds in you imagine the garden of the modern Church casting out seeds it's what they're doing right casting out seeds the seed that brings life the seed that contains life the very word of God with life in it they're casting it out they're throwing it out they're refusing it they're rejecting it they want they they they want the benefits of being married but they don't want to give all this modern society we live in and the issues that we're facing is only showing where the church is at they want to control the seed they want to control the life they want to decide they want to decide what they do and what they don't do what they listen to what they don't listen to what seed gets planted and what seed doesn't get planted and which ones get plucked up and Cast Away it's what these issues in society are all about there's a spirit behind it but oh I thank God that he's going to have good ground he's promised it he's predestinated it he's going to have a place where he can sew his seed and there's going to be somebody like Mary says be it unto me according to your word I'll give my body for that I'll give my mind for that I'll give my tongue for that I'll give my eyes I'll give everything for that I don't want to have an agenda I don't want to have my own will I don't want to have to get my own accomplishments in life I don't want to be that kind of woman I want to be the kind and listen we can't control life the woman can't control life life is in the mail this is what brother bam said says life comes from the male life comes from Christ life comes from this word life comes with from Christ and I can't control him amen all I can do is receive him when he comes to me the woman can't control life she can't produce it she can't force it she can't make it happen it has to be the will of the man but now in this Modern Age the woman's trying to Desert her own will and her will over the will of the man and her control over the life that the man carries but not this bride this bride doesn't want any control we can't control the life I don't want to control the life he alone has the life all I want to do is when that life comes to me and when he comes knocking on my door I want to say Here I Am Lord you can have me I surrender all to you you can have you can sew your life into me and now I can't control the life I can't dictate when it will come I can't I can't control it neither will I cast it out the only thing I can do is nurture it and give my whole life for it what did Mary do Mary gave her life amen she couldn't control the time she couldn't control when he would come she had no seed amen but he came to her in due season at the appointed time and she said be it unto me according to your word she received that life and then that life took over her life and all she could do was serve the life on the inside when she had hunger pain she fed it she was feeding that life on the inside of her I hope you receive life and have some hunger pains for this message and feed that life on the inside then that life come forth and she carried it she nursed it she swaddled it she bathed it she fed it she helped it walk what did she do she was there she can't control life she can't dictate life she's not there to do that she's only there to receive life and nurture life what is the bride here to do receive life and nurture life love it care for it give her all for it brother B says and message marriage and divorce and so it is with the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not lutherans we are not Wesley neither are we Pentecostals we got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child anden I hope you understand could be couldn't be pregnated no so what did he do he put her away in divorcement that's right but she dared put him away he put her away he went he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating himself by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing are they're becoming Children of the word not children of the church Children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any manmade Theory she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen amen I hope you get that out on the air she will be the pregnated daughter of God see what a great honor a woman can be see what a great thing the church can be what was a woman made for to be a help meet to the man to reproduce him on the earth what is the bride been created for to be a helpmate for my Lord so that he can reproduce himself on this Earth it's a partnership but I can't control it I can't control it I have no desire to control it it's a partnership but all I can do is surrender to it Paul tells the church he said I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you a Chase virgin to Christ he was guarding that little first church and he wanted her to stay virgin and he was jealous over her and wanted he was presenting her to Christ as a chased virgin but we know that church fell fell but God restored the brid tree in this day amen he's presented to Christ again through another Prophet another messenger he's restored to the church to the Christ again another virgin bride amen but then he goes on in Galatians to say my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you Paul wanted to do more than just present her a virgin he also wanted Christ to be formed in her he wanted her to become the pregnated daughter of God we know that church first church fell but this church won't fall she's predestinated not and when the churches are dictating to Christ what they'll do and what they won't do what they'll receive and what they won't receive and when and where and how there's got to be a church somewhere that'll just say Lord I'm Yours I surrender all I don't have an ambition I don't have a desire I don't have a program I don't want to control your life I just want to receive your life I just want to nurture your life until eventually brother bam comes and says this is the mystery it's revealed in this day Christ in you the hope of glory this is the age of pregnation to be the pregnated daughter of God no wonder society's going crazy with fertility rights for women because this is the age of the impregnation of the Bride amen I'm so glad that God called me I'm so glad there was an angel messenger came to Mary I'm so glad an angel messenger came to me I'm so glad that that I can find myself in the scripture I'm just like where Mary was Mary was just a common person doing common things in a common way and nothing special but there was a messenger from Heaven came to her an angel came to her and said hey it's time for this scripture to be fulfilled and you're the one God wants to use does that sound familiar I heard an angel in this day come to me and say this is time for certain things to be fulfilled he wants to bring forth his life on this earth now it's time for the marriage it's time to reproduce the son of man again he wants to reproduce himself on the earth and he needs a bride and I'm so glad God put something in my heart not to say well maybe later and another season in life I got some other things I want to accomplish I want to get my degree I want to start I just want to say God be it unto me according to your word amen I want to be that virgin bride who surrenders all to be the place where you can plant your seed and it can come forth and reproduce you on the earth then let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come please the world's all moving one way it's moving the wrong way but Christ has a bride that's moving the right way he sent his word he's he's delivered his word through his Prophet she's received that word word and now that word is producing itself that life that's been sewed into this Garden is starting to bring forth I I believe and I hope and I want to bring forth the fragrances that are Pleasant to him just like in the Song of Solomon let your seeds come to life let the camper and the frankincense and all that come wind and blow on the garden and let my beloved come into his garden and enjoy the seeds that he's planted amen let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord we thank you God that in the face of civilization and Science and education everything going the wrong direction opposite to your word totally contrary to your desire God you have opened our eyes to see well when the world is getting swept up and modern church is getting swept up and all kinds of moves Lord you sent a prophet in our day to give us the isav of your word to to rub away all that Civilization has done in all science and education so that we can come back to ourselves to an Awakening of what we're called for God we want to be that kind of woman Lord that you wanted in the beginning we know that Eve failed in the beginning to produce what you wanted but you predestinated Lord a bride in the end time that won't fail because you're here to carry her through Lord I'm so sorry for my own agendas so sorry for my delays and my trying to control I don't want to control Lord I don't want to decide I don't want to control I don't want to lead I don't want to figure out I don't want to go ahead I don't want to accomplish all I want to do is surrender I want to lay my life down and sacrifice myself and surrender to you that you might sew the seeds of your life into me and bring forth your life from me I want to give my body and my mind and my mouth and my eyes and my time all to this purpose Lord I want to be surrendered I want to be a keeper at home I want to be a helpmate I want to be your garden God help me let your spirit come and guide me Lord and guide your people Lord that we might fulfill in this day what you want us to fulfill and may it stand and stark contrast to the direction the world's going when they try to give control to a woman May there be a woman who gives control back to you when they try to control the man may we never try to control you or your word but may we just be submissive and surrendered to your word Lord Jesus we love your headship we love you for you to be in control we love for you to make the CH call the choices the decisions we love to obey your word we love to hear your voice God let your spirit bring us into a greater manifestation of that we pray I Love You Lord and I ask for your blessings over this congregation may we walk in your word Lord greater in a greater way than ever before before may we walk in a greater surrender than ever before we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Solon concluded all this vanity and now my heart believes that it is true it took me all this time to find reality all I ever really want is [Music] you all that really counts all that's really true all that really matters Lord is you oh everything to him nothing [Music] now all I ever really want is you oh so take the grandest thing you know that life can give wait with eternity he bright side and one thing I I have learned it all this life I live there is truly nothing good but God all that really all that's really true all that's really matters Lord Is You [Music] everything to gain nothing now to lose all I ever really want oh let's sing that again oh all that really counts all that's really true all that really matters Lord Is You and everything to gain nothing now to lose all I ever really want is you
