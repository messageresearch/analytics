[0:00] when something happened that was bad or
[0:02] or
[0:03] challenging Joseph would say God what
[0:06] part of the vision are you wanting to
[0:08] express now you remember that I may have
[0:12] the words a little wrong but what part
[0:14] of the vision are you wanting to express
[0:16] now I said oh what a perspective amen
[0:20] what a perspective when we hit life's
[0:23] trials and difficulties if we could just
[0:25] say God what part of your nature are you
[0:27] trying to express now now what I think
[0:30] should be expressed I sometimes I think
[0:33] the lion should come on the scene when
[0:34] God wants the
[0:36] lamb I think the lion should be there
[0:38] when God wants a sacrificial Ox yeah
[0:41] amen I think it should be the eagle who
[0:43] screams out amen from from Revelation
[0:45] and calls but maybe God wants an ox
[0:49] expression maybe a lion maybe the man
[0:52] maybe instead of me determining what
[0:54] should be respon maybe we should just
[0:56] say God what part of your life do you
[0:59] want to express
[1:00] today why is all this happening he said
[1:03] say why is all this happening to me God
[1:05] don't you know what's happening to me
[1:07] well of course he knows what's happening
[1:08] to
[1:09] you of course he knows where you're at
[1:11] and of course he knows the circumstances
[1:13] and situations instead of looking at it
[1:15] why God why all of this what's going
[1:17] wrong why not just say God what is it
[1:19] you're trying to accomplish today here I
[1:21] am an empty vessel do through me what
[1:23] you want to do with this
[1:26] circumstance because God brought a
[1:28] condition so that the genes on the
[1:31] inside would have an
[1:33] expression part of his nature part of
[1:35] his life it may be absolutely amazing
[1:39] and Supernatural and blow you away it
[1:42] may be as simple as submitting yourself
[1:44] and allowing your flesh to be
[1:47] destroyed both of those are expressions
[1:49] of the Life of
[1:51] Christ to speak a word to speak to the
[1:54] storm or to surrender to the
[1:57] beating it's not us to decide which
[2:00] portion it's him if we could just say
[2:02] like Joseph said what part of the vision
[2:05] what part of the word are you trying to
[2:07] express to me now God help me to stay
[2:09] tuned in and not interject my own
[2:11] thinking but just let you express
[2:13] through me and Friends there's a reality
[2:16] to this that God will do in you what he
[2:18] wants to do if we'll just get our own
[2:20] thinking out of the
[2:21] way what gives us problems is our
[2:25] mind but there's already a solution on
[2:27] the inside the genes are already there
[2:29] to over come oh let the circumstance
[2:32] bring expression because that's the
[2:34] purpose
[2:35] anyways say oh God let me have Joseph's
[2:39] attitude not I was wrong my vision was
[2:42] wrong I thought I was bride I thought I
[2:44] was a Son of God I must have been wrong
[2:46] no what God what is it you're trying to
[2:48] express now have your expression here
