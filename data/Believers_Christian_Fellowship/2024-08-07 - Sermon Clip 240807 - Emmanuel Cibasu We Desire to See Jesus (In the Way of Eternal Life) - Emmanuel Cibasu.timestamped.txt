[0:00] this is just to coming back to our
[0:03] subject to say that seeing Jesus as a
[0:06] single
[0:08] unit as a man as a a Corporal body as an
[0:14] individual standing in appearance will
[0:17] never do you any good no benefit if he
[0:21] was for benefit pilot would have had
[0:24] benefits herods Herod would have had
[0:27] benefit Judas would have had benefit Ben
[0:30] but it's not that way even if he would
[0:33] come tonight you would have no
[0:38] benefit no benefit at all sometimes we
[0:41] have that Pentecostal or Baptist mindset
[0:46] that if I see him appearing something
[0:49] will happen in my life he could be
[0:52] appearing all the time and you are
[0:56] setting him at not that's right yes sir
[1:00] because you can only see him by
[1:06] faith in the message we s we would see
[1:10] Jesus 1957 the prophet of God said all
[1:14] of us want want want to see him I want
[1:17] to see him you want to see him and
[1:20] that's the desire of the Christian world
[1:23] is to see him that was the desire of the
[1:26] Orthodox Jew uh world of the Jew Jew
[1:29] Jewish church when Jesus came they
[1:32] wanted to see the Messiah but they
[1:35] didn't believe him when he was
[1:41] manifested the main thing is when he
[1:46] manifested we will see the when the the
[1:50] where the What the how or very important
[1:55] in seeing
[1:57] Jesus he said they did believe him when
[2:00] he was manifested and I wonder sometimes
[2:04] if that's just about isn't what we are
[2:07] to we long to see Jesus but when he
[2:11] appears we think it's something else we
[2:15] turn him
[2:17] down the disciples did that they want
[2:20] one time in the
[2:22] boat dark the water tossing the boat on
[2:26] each side and they saw Jesus coming on
[2:28] the water
[2:31] right but they were
[2:33] afraid they thought he was a
[2:35] ghost so they saw him coming but they
[2:38] were still
[2:39] afraid so the how to see
[2:42] him the where to see him went to see him
[2:48] very critical
