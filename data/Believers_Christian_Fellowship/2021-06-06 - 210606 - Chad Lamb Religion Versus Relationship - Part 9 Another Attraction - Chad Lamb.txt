three while we're turning there i'd like to greet some visitors we're privileged to have angie's parents with us over the weekend and they're happy to have him here with us in church this morning so we appreciate that privilege and also brother vincent and sister emeline sitchula is with us after a long absence they're back here for a visit so god bless you it's good to see you guys again amen let's look at genesis chapter three we're going to continue on with the the series we've been on with religion versus relationship this is part nine and i want to minister on the subtitle another attraction another attraction i'm going to back up and we're going to do just a little bit of review and get caught back up and then move from there genesis chapter 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless his word this morning lord jesus we thank you father for the privileged lord to come into this place for it's by your grace lord that you've allowed us to gather like this and lord your mercies have been good unto us and your grace is abounded and lord we consider ourselves a privileged people and as we take this bible lord anybody with literacy can open it and read it but lord only you can open it by revelation that we might know lord what you're trying to speak to us in this day we pray god that you would come and break the bread yourself that you would feed us your sheep as we come expecting we come hungry we come lord needing from you that would that portion that you have allotted for us in this day we ask that you would bless the vessel that would speak only truth and god that you would anoint our ears to hear that we might perceive and receive all that you have for us in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated it's a few things that we've been going over out here but i'd like to just bring to your attention out of this reading that we know here that the serpent is tempting the woman and as he's tempting the woman he's asking her questions about this tree that they had a commandment not to partake of and when he begins to ask her and begins to reason with her she moves she moves from faith in the word of god over to reasoning she's always been walking by faith because god said don't partake of this tree and she believed god and she didn't partake of the tree but now under the questioning of the serpent the serpent begins to speak to her reasoning and he begins to entice her and then by reasoning she takes a look at the tree and and she cannot discern with her reasoning what is wrong with the tree it looks good for food it's pleasant to the eye a tree to be desired to make one wise when she moves from faith to reasoning she is trapped under human reasoning and she falls she takes the tree that she was told not to take and she eats and gives to her husband he eats and immediately their eyes were open amen and they knew that they were naked before they were naked but their eyes were closed it wasn't that they were blind but they were under a veil of innocency that they could look upon each other and there was no lust there was no wrong desire there was there was no shame there was no awareness of nakedness that understanding had not been opened unto them until they partook of this tree and then their eyes were open amen and they knew good from evil and immediately adam goes to sow fig leaves adam and the woman they sow fig leaves and cover themselves and brother venom tells us in the message god hiding himself in simplicity he said in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion and so uh adam now begins to take these fig leaves and sew them together to cover his nakedness because that's what was opened under partaking of this tree he tried to cover his sin he tried to cover his shame with something he made himself his own covering and his own covering is his own religion he makes his own religion to try to cover himself amen but then when they recognizes the presence of god amen how does he recognize the presence of god this is so important for us to understand he does not recognize the presence of god by the simultude or the form he recognizes him by the voice he hears a voice and god coming he hears a voice in the garden and he hides himself from the presence of god so when he hears the voice he knows that god is now present and now he's hiding from the presence of god he didn't have to see something with his eyes to know that god was present when he heard his voice he knew god was present and under the voice of god adam hid himself and god said where are thou and he said i hidden myself because i was naked amen technically he was not naked because he had made fig leaves to cover himself he had made his own religion he made his own covering he made his own buffer between him and god amen but when he heard the voice of god under the recognizing of the presence of god and the voice of god he realized that his fig leaves were insufficient to cover his nakedness he had a fig leaf covering but he was naked because religion will never cover our sin then let's go to verse 21 chapter 3 verse 21 unto adam also unto his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them so now god god slays the first animals that have been slayed in this creation god himself comes down and he takes an innocent substitute that's going to substitute for the life of his children because they have sinned they deserve to die but god is the judge is going to come down and he's going to make a reconciliation and if he's going to get a coat of skins he has to get the skin off the animal so he has to slay the animal amen and he's showing what he's going to do when he brings his own lamb the son of god as god's lamb and he slay that lamb amen to cover the sins of his children so this is a foreshadow of what's coming and so god slays the first beast amen and he slays the first beast to reconcile his children back to them to make an atonement for them and to cover their nakedness to cover the shame of their sin they couldn't come up with their own covering god as the good father he provided a bloody atonement and he provided skins for the covering so man is not going to make his own religion that'll be sufficient god will provide for him a covering and the only covering that's sufficient is the god-provided covering that's why in this day a prophet came to clothe the bride in the word and the word is the only appropriate covering because the word is himself in in the message fellowship from 1960 he said in closing i might say this in the garden of eden when god saw that his children had sinned and had gone from him god himself who is a supreme judge made a reconciliation so that he could restore that fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal so we've been talking about everything begins in genesis everything that we see going on today started in genesis everything that winds up in revelation began in genesis genesis is the seed chapter of the whole bible everything starts there and moves its way through and comes to full fruition amen so god laid down a pattern his fallen children now he would come down himself as a voice expose the nakedness of the of their fig the insufficiency of their religion then he would offer a substitute of an innocent one the shedding of blood for the remission of sins and then he would provide a covering that he would cover them with so that he can restore fellowship with his creation this is the story of the whole bible and god foreshadowed it right here at the beginning because god god wants to restore what satan tried to destroy which was fellowship and harmony between god and his children now let's move over to genesis chapter four like i said we're just doing a quick review and moving through genesis chapter 4 verse 3 and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel into his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell hebrews 11 4 tells us by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh so hebrews tells us that faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice by faith amen faith in it was a revelation god gave a revelation to abel of what it would take to bring a reconciliation amen and by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous it proved he was the righteous one because he could receive by faith what cain could not even follow by instruction because god tried to instruct cain and said just do well send life at the door if you do well amen amen want to be well with thee and cain could not even repeat abel's offering but abel caught it by faith by a revelation amen a you know noah built an ark by faith amen god revealed to him the plan of salvation for his day he believed it he went into action amen by faith all these characters in hebrews 11 operated by faith god revealed something in each age and each day he revealed to noah the plan of salvation was an ark i mean he revealed to abraham his plan of redemption was through a promised seed i mean he brought he keep giving revelation for the for the message of their day and they were able to receive that revelation and that revelation testified that they were righteous and by faith they went into action upon the revelation and in the message god of this evil age he says now notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he came down and offered the fruit the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient every way but without the revelation of the word now we're going to begin to see why faith is so essential and faith is not a concept that's taught you cannot teach somebody and instruct them to have faith because faith is not intellectual amen faith is a gift that comes from god for by grace you're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god so the ability that abel had to believe wasn't an education wasn't a seminary instruction and it wasn't a workbook amen it wasn't anything like that it wasn't even a memorization of scripture or attendance to church abel had something that was a gift from god and cain did not have that same thing he was not able to believe but but abe or cain was not able to believe abel was able to believe because he had faith and when you look at hebrews 11 these are all we call them the heroes of faith heroes of faith amen but the question the question remains how were they heroes amen what did they do amen they only believed what god told them and acted upon their faith and that faith was not their own it was a gift from god proving that they were the children of god the seed of god always operated by faith in hebrews 11 comes to to accentuate that to show you that it was by faith and by faith and by all the way down through it's been by faith faith in want not faith in what had been done faith in the plan of redemption and salvation for your day and abel was able to receive that and cain was not and so now it's testifying right here at the beginning these are two forms of worship amen and in these two forms of worship amen one is cain who's worshiping according to his own intellect in his own desire now it's not that he had a bad offering because the scripture says abel had a more excellent it didn't say that cain's was not a good offering because he offered first fruits and that would be established later as a good offering but it was not the offering that would bring redemption it was the substitutionary lamb that would bring redemption and reconciliation so cain had a form of worship and abel had a form of worship and both of them were sincere in their worship we have to understand cain wanted to worship god and abel wanted to worship god king went through great efforts to provide the offering that he provided laboring tilling in the soil growing the garden building the altar presenting what he had grown what he had labored for what he had produced and he worked really hard abel didn't work all abel did was caught a revelation of god what god wanted and took one of the lambs that were there one of the flock and he took it and he hacked it to pieces and and let the blood flow all over the place and that was what god accepted but abel did not put forth as much effort as cain proving that religious works will not produce faith and religious works in itself does not equal exception by god but we get so many religious forms and these religious forms will produce a system of works a church order amen because there's a comfort in doing something that will get me recognized or find favor with god and if you can do something to produce that it's no longer by grace but now by debt now if you do the work that you're supposed to do then god can no longer save you by grace he saves you by debt he owes you salvation but it's not by debt it's by grace so because it was by grace god required faith to come in contact with his grace it wasn't going to be by works by effort by beauty or even by sincerity because you can be sincerely wrong cain was sincerely wrong cain was rejected and he becomes so roth he eventually killed his brother because he couldn't stand the truth now abel had the voice of truth in the voice of truth and made cain's worship nakedness and cain became angry and he killed his brother what did he kill him over it was all over worship now further on in this god of this evil lady he said and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god that brings accepted worship now i want to move on we reviewed we just touched a review to bring everybody up to speed and now we're let's begin to move forward i'm going to read several quotes from the god of this evil age the prophet of god says notice closely now as we study the word god of this evil age that we're now living may seem strange a very strange thing in this age of grace when god is taking a people for his name's sake that is his bride in this evil age that should be called the age of evil the very age that god is calling a people for his name's sake by grace calling them out and is called an evil age so brother man is going to start laying down a principle here he's going to start showing that the very age of grace perfect grace coming to the to the completion of the work of grace is going to be the very age of evil they're going to run on parallel tracks he goes on to say in the god of this evil age what would god call a people out of this age for his name the reason it is is to try her his bride when she has made manifest been tried been proved proved to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end so why would god call out a bride in such an evil age and satan's eden and the pinnacle of all satan's been trying to do bringing everything that he imagined about till he is the god of this world is that what the bible says he is the god of this world he has control when he took jesus up amen on the pinnacle or on the mountain he showed them all the kingdoms and he said i'll give them all to you if you bow to me he was over them all jesus never rebuked him and said you don't have the authority to do that he has the authority because adam fell adam lost the title deed of all creation amen and now the devil comes as a squatter to set himself up as the god of this world he's the prince of the power of the air and now in this evil age when we've come to the pinnacle of satan's eden we know that god spent six thousand years to create his eden now now the devil satan has made six thousand years to create his eden but in the pinnacle of his creation when he gets to the height of his power when he has control of all the world amen that's when god is going to call a bride out and it seems like a such contrast but god loves the contrast god loves the contrast amen god loves little david a boy who's not even old enough to fight in the army yet amen he loves that little boy killing the greatest soldier amen that ever was what was in that valley god loves the contrast so now in this evil age he's going to call a bride why to try her now listen he brother brahm said it's coming right back to the beginning again because in god's eden the bride was tried the woman was tried and she fell but now in satan's eating listen the woman fell in a realm of perfection in eden was eden perfection perfect love perfect peace perfect creation perfect harmony with nature perfect relationship perfect fellowship perfect everything imperfection she come face to face amen with temptation with the trial and she fell but now god in order to have victory he's going to go to the opposite extreme now not in perfection but in imperfection with and perfect imperfection and perfect perversion when everything that god ordained has been perverted by the devil when the whole society and culture and everything has been perverted by the devil when the devil has absolute control over everything in the world and everything is under a perversion and everything lays in wickedness it's in the face of that he's gonna call out a bride and let her stand the same test that the first one test because god loves to overcome he loves to show his power he loves to show his might amen and if you think that you are able in yourself to overcome in this satan's eden you are mistaken it's not you it's greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world god is going to show himself mighty in this evil generation because he'll have a bride that won't take her reasoning won't take her own thinking but she'll stay with the word of god and won't exchange it for any idea any reasoning continuing on in the same message we find now this evil ages to prove to satan she is not like eve prove to satan why would god do that why would he call us in such a wicked world and let it get into such wickedness amen to prove to satan did did god not already do this once in the bible what about job who was god proving job to to satan the devil comes amen and satan presents himself with the sons of god amen and they have a dialogue and god says what have you been doing i've been roaming to and from and back and forth over the face of the earth and he said have you considered my servant job there is none like him who was god proving job to to the devil and he's going to do the same thing with his bride she is not like eve she is not that type of a woman she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word and she will keep every word again in the god of this evil age he says the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see the spirit of god as is growed into the full stature of god is the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that seed time again from eden here it is again so we see here that the spirit of god is calling out a bride but the spirit of devil he's calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of god amen because the battle is always around the word of god the devil is always working and trying to disrupt what god is doing amen the devil is not he's not any longer working in the bar room in the house of prostitution they're so given over to those spirits that's not where he's trying to win the battle he's trying to win the battle over god amen the war is between god and satan amen that's what the battle this great showdown is between god and satan and has everything to do with the word of god so that's why when he come to eve he perverted the commandment and he and he caused her to fail by a perverted commandment and today he's causing millions to fail by perverting the word of god by their reasonings changing it amen and adapting the word to their own understanding to their own liking to their own feeling to their own desire and they're adjusting the word of god to fit their own desire and plan and thinking and the devil is deceiving millions who go to church pray to mary do rosary beads baptizing father son and holy ghost changing the word to fit their own desire but god is going to in that day raise up a bride who will stick with the word stay with the bible let's go back to genesis chapter 3. chapter 3 and i want to go back to verse 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field so he was wise to the ways of life he had wisdom and craftiness now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now he's contradicting the word of god verse 5 for god does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil now imagine the woman she's not yet eve she doesn't get a name till after adultery she's just woman here her name is adam because genesis chapter 5 says in the day he created them he created the male and female and called their name adam she is mrs adam he is mr adam her name is adam she does not get a name until she becomes the mother of all living and so now the woman is living in a realm of god's perfection everything is at her fingertips she is a joint heir with adam and she is a co-ruler with adam is that true she came from adam she's part of adam her and adam are one god had separated from adam a rib and he formed a woman and united them back together and these two shall be one flesh and god looked down and called them one they were ruling and reigning together in eden she had dominion she had a perfect climate a perfect atmosphere a perfect union and fellowship with her husband a perfect fellowship with god in the cool of the evening when you've come walking in the garden everything was in harmony around her everything was in perfection and she had no need is that true she had no need until the sceptility of the serpent who's anointed by the devil begins to speak to her and he begins to ask questions about the commandment and as he's asking questions about the commandment he begins to sow a doubt about you know you'll not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil she was already a god upon the earth she was already had dominion and rulership and power and authority and everything was subject to her and her husband amen but now the devil amen showed a doubt in her heart and then created a need then all of a sudden she was no longer satisfied with what god gave her now she began to want something that god told her not to have and in wanting it her heart began to lust she had never lusted for evil before until the conversation with the serpent and now he begins to open the lust veil and she begins to desire this thing that god is holding back from me for god doesn't know see the serpent he he goes right to her logic and right to her reasoning and he creates in her desire but he also creates in her a lack she has never known lack before she has never lacked anything before but now he creates through his lie a lack and now she feels she has a need then after this conversation the woman looks at the tree and when the woman saw that tree was good for food that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat see she was in perfection what would cause her to leave perfection to move there had to be an attraction the devil created an attraction of something more and then all of a sudden she began to have the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life see you would never leave perfection without an attraction and then the attraction becomes more appealing than the perfection that you live in this is how the devil brings deception let's look at first john together first john chapter 2 verse 15. first john chapter 2 verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but as of the world and when she began to look at this tree she began to express all three of these lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life she saw that it was a tree good for food pleasant to the eyes and desirable to make one wise and she began to have new thoughts and then she'd begin to have new thoughts about god she began to lean to her reasoning instead of just simple faith in the word of god and she began to reason through and why would she reason why would she even begin to reason this out is because now there was something in her that wanted that tree the devil had to paint the picture in such a way that she wanted the tree so that she would go back and reevaluate the word of god with her reasoning so that she could go forward and feel justified to have what lust had now caused her to want and the devil is working in the same pattern all the time let's look at this in james james chapter 1. james chapter 1 verse 13 let no man say that when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth for sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not air my beloved brethren god don't say i'm tempted of god but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust amen who is your greatest enemy this man right here amen so i probably said my the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that's always getting in god's way this man this the this body of death that i live in it's got to come subject to the word but it's the thing that always wants what it wants amen it has lust it has desires and it wants what it wants amen and the human mind is also fallen and that human mind under the cravings of of a fallen nature begins to try to reason to have what it wants and it'll even take the word of god and begin to reason the word of god to be to fulfill the lust of the flesh so god doesn't tempt you were drawn away of your own lust let's go back to genesis chapter 6. genesis chapter 6 and verse 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wise of all they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years now all of a sudden the sons of god which are supposed to live a separated life amen they begin they begin to get enticed with the daughters of men the lineage of cain and they're supposed to live separated but all of a sudden they're enticed they're led away of their own lust and they begin to take unto them women all which they chose and god now said i'm finished i will my spirit will not always dwell with man there'll be 120 years and i'll destroy the thing because the devil's always working with lust bam said in in the message united under one head so remember beauty is deceitful it was satan's idea to make a better more brighter kingdom than michael's beauty was the downfall to begin with and the devil has used that ever since what a thing it is today to see that kingdom of the devil is made so pretty and a lot of people fall for it now remember the devil is religious let's say amen the devil is religious he's not the sinister one down in the corner trying to sell drugs to your school kids amen that's the product of the fall of man amen that's demons that have been unleashed amen but the devil is religious he was part of worship in heaven part of the true worship of god he participated in that worship amen and he is religious amen he's the one that was anointing cain he's the one that was anointing all the pharisees and sadducees that withstood jesus the day that jesus christ was here when the word was made flesh when everything that moses wrote about was now standing in front of them it was the religious devil that had gotten into the pharisees and sadducees and chief priests and elders that were now calling jesus christ beelzebub and they called jesus christ beelzebub and they have a secret meeting on how they can kill him and then they walk out and they pray prayers and they burn incense and they drop some money in the offering totally anointed by devils and going through all the motions that moses had set out in the law keeping the law and judging other people according to the law that's the deception that's what trips up that's what the devil's trying to use to trip up the children of god and stop the progress of god's plan is religion religion is the problem now remember the devil's religious many people like to go down to church that's got great big high steeples on it and seats set so plush no wonder the preacher can't preach but 15 minutes you'd go to sleep in such a place and with a great big million dollar pipe organ and with the pastor with his collar buttoned in the back and a long robe on with some kind of little ear tickling something of some society or about some politics what we we don't want that the real child of god if he has to stand on the street corner on a little mission and hear the word of god preach and the power and demonstration of the holy ghost he'll pick it amen he won't go for the beauty he'll go for the character of the word i want to read two places in the in the scriptures let's go to ezekiel and then we'll go to isaiah let's go to ezekiel first i want to contrast these two places in the scripture ezekiel 28. all these things are very familiar to us but i want to build them together and get to where my heart is pointing me this morning ezekiel 28 and 11 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation against the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou seelest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty who is he talking about lucifer perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god who is in eden amen it was the devil thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis the topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and the gold the workmanship of thy taverns and thy pipes was prepared in the in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire listen you think by intellect and wisdom that you're going to overcome this creature look at where he was look at what he saw look at what he understood look at his proximity to god in the creation in the garden of eden amen he was a covering cherub he was right there over the throne of god amen you think by intellect and wisdom you're going to outreason him you'll never outreason him but there's got to be a gift of faith that my predestination has been dropped into your soul that when you come in contact with the living word of god something inside says that's the truth because you're not god wisdom in schools and all of these things you're never going to discern you're never going to understand he's wiser he's he's full of wisdom and perfect in beauty and he's religious verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee iniquity is knowing to do good and not doing it by the multitude of thy merchandise i have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast this profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness or illumination i will cast it to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee lucifer himself was corrupted by his own beauty think about this he was so beautiful and so wise he corrupted himself by his own beauty in his own brightness that's the deception the deception is beauty and enlightenment and wisdom knowledge these are the deceptions by which he deceived by those are the deceptions why which he deceived himself by he he became deceived by his own beauty and by his own brightness and that's the very tool that he deceived himself is the very tool that he's using to deceive this world by wisdom by brightness and by beauty now let's go to isaiah 53. isaiah 53 this is a prophecy of the coming of jesus christ isaiah 53 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him oh my he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not see the contrast between christ and lucifer christ comes in humility there was listen i want to i want to read this again verse 2 he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and we will shall see him there is no beauty that we shall desire him amen you realize that jesus christ he was not desirable because of his beauty that's what the scripture says but what made him beautiful was the character that was in him what made him desirable was the very life of god was living through that vessel and that is what became desirable it was the word of god on display it was the word of god being manifest it was the word made flesh and dwelt among us the beauty was the character of the father reflected in the sun it wasn't the outside form amen that's why he was rejected and that's why he was despised because he didn't he had he didn't have the same luster that lucifer had he had something greater than what lucifer ever could have he had the very character and life of god what was the attraction to christ the attraction was the word made flesh was the life of god what was the attraction to lucifer wisdom and beauty see jesus wasn't trying to attract people to his wisdom and he wasn't trying to attract him amen to his flesh he wasn't he was trying to connect them to god and he so was not trying to use his wisdom to attract him because he would say things that didn't make sense and lucifer when he's trying to use wisdom he tries to make the gospel so understandable that that you can't miss it water it down and simplify it until you begin to translate bibles and the bible translations are so watered down they have no meaning anymore because where the goal is to make it so simple nobody can miss it but jesus when he talked to nicodemus he said unless a man be born again he cannot enter to the kingdom and nicodemus says born again what do you mean born again do i have to go back as an adult enter into my mother's womb be borne out and jesus didn't explain it to him he said you're a master in israel and you don't even understand this he wasn't enticing by wisdom he wasn't enticing the intellect he wasn't there to to convince nicodemus he wasn't there to entice his intellect he wasn't there to make it so perfect nicodemus had no choice but to say that's it he jesus christ gave the truth and he gave it so difficult that the intellect was so baffled he looked at a group of disciples that we're following one time he says unless you drink the blood of the son of man and eat his flesh you have no part with him listen if you were standing there that day and you were a common human being with common human being understanding and all he said was unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no part with me what would you think here we are 2 000 years later looking back saying oh he's speaking of communion he's speaking of the spirit that's in him he's speaking of the word but in that day they didn't know that and he didn't stop and explain it he didn't give an explanation that would be easy to understand he didn't water it down so that unbelievers could be receiving it he just said it and he let the truth fall and many said we must go this is a hard saying and he said well if you think that's hard what if you see the son of man ascend up to where he was before what many of his disciples left him because he wasn't there to entice their intellect he was seeking for lost sheep and lost sheep have a secret ingredient the lost sheep have a secret ingredient they have a capacity to believe even when they don't understand there's something in them there's something in them that'll say i don't understand what you just said but i know you're telling the truth that's exactly what peter said he looked at this 12 and he said well you go also he said where would we go you alone have the words of eternal life and peter had no comprehension of what he meant my eat my flesh and drink my blood and ascend up where he was before that came later under the ministration of the holy ghost when he began to break the word down to them but that day he had a revelation he knew that was the son of god and he knew he had the words of eternal life but lucifer comes in and and he tries to use wisdom and beauty in a religious way to overtake the church of god brother rem said in marriage and divorce he said notice now but god is featured in character there is no beauty we should desire jesus but there never was a character like him on the earth now we find out today that the church character satan and his group look after big beautiful churches beautiful thing that's what the world looks at today oh it's the pastor the great so and so time so and so so priestly and godly walk out with his big robes and things like that they call that beauty but the real saints of god look for the character of the vindicated word that's what the saints did in that day when they seen jesus he wasn't nothing to look at but they seemed god was in him they seen god was in him and because they were children of god they were attracted to god and god in his word is the same thing and because they're children of god they're attracted to god and the word of god was god was with god it was made flesh and dwelt among us and when they saw the word of god made flesh because they were children of god they were attracted to god and they may not have been able to understand it it may not have been intellectual and it may not have been beautiful as carnal beauty is considered but there was something in them that was attracted to that until they would leave family they would leave businesses they would leave and they would begin to follow jesus and then when everybody see when they began to follow jesus it was exciting because they got on board and the movement began to grow rapidly you know there's healing campaigns and going from city to city and feeding five thousand all this it was exciting amen but the thing that attracted them was not the big meeting they were attracted to god so when the big meetings begin to fall apart amen and they begin to reject jesus christ more and more as he got closer to the crucifixion he became more and more rejected till his disciples walked away amen this group walked away that group walked away and when they were all walked away that group that was still attracted to god was still attracted to god because god hadn't changed whether the meetings were big whether the meetings were small where there was a lot of miracles where there was few miracles whether it was widely accepted or whether it was rejected god hadn't changed and the place god was dwelling hadn't changed and the word of god hadn't changed and what they were originally attracted to they were still attracted to and it shows those that came on board later when the campaigns were going out and the healing ministry was going out and all of israel was running after him amen when all of israel began to leave him and he began to have hard sayings they walked away because they weren't attracted to god they were attracted to whatever they were seeing there was another attraction but for the children of god there's got to be one attraction in our life that is greater than every other attraction and that's the attraction to god himself like a magnet pulling you through the attraction you're polarized to be attracted to god let's turn to exodus 32. exodus 32 and verse 1. when we look at verse one i want to read from one down to eight he said and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we walk not what has become of him i want you just to note that they had been led this far by moses or seemingly by moses was it moses or was it god and moses wasn't moses strength because when moses and his strength tried to deliver them he killed one egyptian and he got run out of town so was it moses or was it god through moses see but they got their eyes on the vessel and now the vessel was absent now moses was out of sight and they got accustomed to you know when they when they when they had trouble and and pharaoh wouldn't let him go moses showed up lifted his hand said let there be flies and then flies would show up and then when again when the cycle repeated moses would show up and he said let there be frogs and there was frogs and all the plagues came and then they went out with a mighty hand and then when they got to the red sea they saw moses lift up the rod and the waters apart and they walked across on dry land i mean when they come to the bitter waters amen they saw moses throwing a stick and the waters turned sweet amen when they ran out of bread they heard they saw moses go to pray and they saw manna fall from heaven so these were carnal believers because they needed something that they could see or touch or hold on to and now when moses is out of sight amen they have no faith in the god who's led them this far their faith is only skin deep they had faith when moses was there now when moses is gone then all of a sudden they begin to wonder and waver and it tells aaron make us gods that shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we what not what has become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with grape with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and when aaron saw it he built an altar before and aaron made a proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the lord that word lord is jehovah aaron is making an idol so that the people have something to worship something to see something they could lay their hands on something that they could lay in oblation before they wanted something physical and aaron made that but still believing they were going to worship jehovah and they rose up early in the morning offered burnt offerings and and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat to eat and to drink and rose up to play and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou brought us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i command them that they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed therein too and said these be thy gods or israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt see as long as moses was present they had something to look at and they could have faith as long as there was a physical image something there that they could go to and what that vessel could then uh go to god and and and they could be represented through this intercessor but god's great goal was to bring this people to himself so that he would have a people that would love him and he would have people would worship him and he would have a people that would be married to him that's what god desired god was bringing them out of egypt to bring them into a personal relationship with himself that they would be a peculiar people that they would be a nation of priests that he would dwell in their midst and they would have fellowship with him god wanted their fellowship god wanted the relationship but they got so used to what they saw down in egypt that they were now bringing the perversion of egypt so quickly into the exodus journey because they had already seen this form of religion in this form of worship now they're out on their own they're moving to a promised land they're going to become a great nation the last time they were in a great nation this is what they saw so now moses isn't there but we need some form of worship we need something we need a a ritual we need something to see we need we need a church building we need a priesthood we need a so they begin to make the idol and believing that through this idol they could still have a feast to jehovah see man needs something he can manipulate something carnal something he can see something he can make something he can worship before something that that is tangible to him but god doesn't want that god wants your heart and he wants you to be connected to him you see they had been through the plagues and they seen the mighty hand of god they'd come out and spoiled egypt they had all of the spoil of war amen then they come through the red sea crossing they had the the waters turned sweet they had the manna they had all of this and and still they needed something more something that they could have confidence in something they made another form of fig leaves you say look at what you've been through look at what god's brought you through couldn't you just wait and sit still a little bit longer but they began to lust now look at the now look it looks religious it's religious on its surface they got tired of waiting on moses to come back down on the mountain they got a little bit restless and what they really wanted was to satisfy their own lusts they didn't really just want to worship jehovah they just wanted to worship because the scripture says they sat down to eat and they rose up to play they wanted to worship in a way that was gratifying to themselves they didn't want to wait for moses to come back they got a little restless and they had seen worship in egypt for how many years and how exciting was the worship in egypt and how appealing to the flesh was the worship in egypt and now in the absence of moses rather than sitting and waiting and do what he said and trust in god that brought you this far now all of a sudden they begin to get restless and they wanted they wanted to religion to appeal to the carnal senses because as soon as they made a golden calf they declared a feast and in that feast they sat down to eat and drink and they rose up to play what did they want they wanted to satisfy their flesh through religion and still be okay and still worship and still enjoy the feast see that's what's wrong with the american church it's what's wrong with the church in the world they still want to be entertained and call it religion they still want societies they still they still want to have dance routines on the platform and dress any way they want and have social affairs and have all of these things and and bring rock and roll music into the church and have a form of worship that's appealing and appetizing and they they get restless and they want to feed the flesh amen and so what do they do they make themselves a religious system an order where we can worship jehovah this way but really all they wanted to do was raise up and play what they really wanted was not to just sit there and wait for moses to come back and tell us what god wants we want to have worship because there's a craving in the heart of man worship but man wants to worship according to his own desire and his own fleshly lusts cain wanted to worship god abel wanted to worship god abel wanted to worship god the way god wanted to be worshipped so he waited for a revelation on what was acceptable and he realized that blood is the covering that god wants and he offered blood by faith but when cain wanted to worship he had a desire to worship and wanted to worship god he worshiped god according to his own desires what he thought was wise what he thought was beautiful what he thought was an acceptable offering and he labored and he worked and he toiled and he brought of the fruit of the field to the labor of his hands and he brought something beautiful he brought something enticing and when he offered it he liked the offering he enjoyed the offering do you think abel enjoyed his offering taking the choicest lamb of his flock the very best he cared for he protected he was probably there when it was born he may have assisted in the birth he took the choicest of what he had and he had to lay it down and put his knee upon it and take a sharp rock and hack its throat because he caught a revelation that god will take a substitute an innocent substitute for my sin it wasn't that abel wasn't satisfied after he worshipped that he had done what god told him it wasn't that there wasn't satisfaction but the question is who enjoyed their worship most one was worshiping a living god according to what god desired the other was worshiping a living god according to what the worshiper decided and the question is to give god proper worship do you worship according the way the worshiper wants to desire or do you worship according to the way the worship he wants to be worshipped this is where the devil cunningly gets into religion and he begins to satisfy hungers and cravings and desires because man has a desire to worship he has a craving to worship he was made to worship and the devil will get in here and begin to pollute worship amen and he'll begin to change it to a worship that becomes satisfying and appealing to the flesh and when he mixes the worship of god with carnal satisfaction he's got a program that will win millions you can build mega churches on this platform is that what they've done you can build mega churches on the platform of mixing a man's craving to worship a true god with the lust and desires of man to worship according to his own heart's desire and if you mix those two things together you have a recipe for success that they have written books about and begin to propagate why would they leave what god was bringing them to why would they go back to idolatry god was rescuing them out of an idolatrous nation he was bringing them into their own land why would they bring this perversion with them when they had a pillar of fire they had a they had a pillar of fire they could see leading the camp they had a cloud they had the pillar of fire that would come and stand between them and the egyptians they had a way of dry ground through through the red sea why why would they bring that old idolatry and bring it into this system it's because they wanted it remember you're enticed when you're drawn away by your own lusts it's what james tells us let's go to numbers 22. numbers 22 and verse 1. and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho and balak the son of zappor saw all that israel had done to the amorites and balak the son of support saw that israel done for the amorites and moab was so afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox looketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time he sent messengers therefore into balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me per adventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the lamb for i walk that he whom thou blesses is blessed and he whom now curses is cursed we know this story quite well as they're marching in the in the exodus journey going to the promised land they they come up against moab and now balak the king of the moabites he becomes nervous and he doesn't want to give them passage through he's afraid because they wiped out the amorites he's afraid he's going to be wiped out so he's going to go sin for a prophet of god and he's going to ask this prophet of god to come down and curse this people because he knows that he's a prophet and if he what he curses will be cursed and when he blesses will be blessed and so he sends down and we know the story we're not going to go into that but he goes the first time he's refused god told him not to goes the second time god told him to go but that wasn't the original plan of god and he goes down and three times he tries to curse israel three times they offer seven bullocks and seven rams on seven altars brother bam said showing that fundamentally they had the fundamentals of the faith moab was a church like israel was a church the moabs had seven clean offerings seven rams seven bulldogs speaking of the coming of christ they had a prophet who could genuinely hear from god they had a church they had a church the church of the israelites had moses a prophet the church of the moabites had balaam a prophet they had altars they had burnt offerings they had worship now this church was afraid of that church why did cain kill abel because abel was a threat to cain's fig leaf religion there was a reason you don't kill somebody unless they're a threat to you somehow why did cain kill abel because his deeds were evil is what the bible says this church was afraid of that church so balak calls up balaam says curse them and they have the three times seven bullocks seven rams from seven altars fundamentally brother better said they were correct quoting scriptures having services and three times he failed to curse them because he could only say what god put in his mouth and every time the curse turned into a blessing and so balaam the prophet was forbidden by god to lay a curse upon what god had blessed so there's fear the moabites fear the israelites this is the church of the called out amen with the prophet for their age following the word for their day the moabites here have a perverted word and they're afraid of this nation that god's in and now they have to come up with a plan balak gets angry at balaam and he says these three times now i called you to curse my enemies these three times you have blessed them and not cursed them the whole plan was failing because you cannot curse what god has blessed but let's go to numbers 25. i want to read a couple scriptures that will explain something here numbers 25. verse 1 and israel bowed and him and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab and they called the people into the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself and developed peor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel now there's three attempts at cursing three failed attempts and instead of a cursing comes a blessing bailey gets angry at balaam but balaam has another approach the direct approach of attacking and cursing is not working so they're going to try another approach let's look down at verse 16. same chapter 25 16 and the lord spake unto moses saying vex the midianites and smite them for they vex you with their wiles their craftiness and they were coming there was something sneaky and crafty and wily about what they were doing it wasn't as straightforward as it appeared where they vex you with their wiles therefore they have beguiled you that's deceived seduced beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cosby the daughter of the prince of the midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peor's sake now let's go over the numbers 31 and verse 15. and moses said unto them have you saved all the women alive they went out to destroy the midianites and they saved the women alive moses and then have you saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the council of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now all of a sudden moses is saying there's been a council the cursing failed but the council will work and balaam began to counsel balak and counsel the moabites and the midianites on how they might accomplish their task a different way because trying to just curse them was not going to work try to just come against them openly was not going to work but there's a council they've been taking and it causes them to be wily in their approach in revelations 2 14 in the pergamus church age he says but a few things i have against thee because thou has their them that hold the doctrine of balaam what is doctrine teaching so now there's a teaching of balaam what is that his counsel now the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication here's what the prophet of god says about this whole thing in the pergamian church he says now what did balaam do when he found out that he couldn't that he couldn't curse israel he told balak it would be a good idea then for him to invite these people to the festival of the gods they had a great festival up there where they were going to have the festival called the feast of baal pior it was a feast to worship and balaam said now i'll i'll tell you balak i'll give you a good idea if you god won't curse them that's all there is to it so i'll tell you what we'll do we want we can't get rid of them but if you'll just invite them over you'll swing the whole thing your way so exactly exactly what constantine did perfectly that's the reason the doctrine of balaam what did they do balak's teaching came down amongst israel and they invited all the israelites up to this big feast the big blowout they had oh some big party shindig of something up there they had and when they got up there why these israelite people begin to see these pretty sexy dressed moabite women yes wasn't like they're common girls down there now he's using beauty and wisdom and craftiness to entice them they were beautiful moabitus they were attracted to something other than what god gave them what god gave them may have been common in the eyes of man amen but it was beautiful in the eyes of god if it had the character of god in it and now he begins to entice them oh they look so pretty my how they were made and oh how they could show themselves and they fell for it and began to commit adultery and balaam knowed if god wouldn't curse them he'd take them over on this denominational side and cause the anger of god to kill them anyhow let god kill them himself if he could ever get them out of the way of the truth and we know that's exactly what happened when they begin to go up to the feast of beopeora and commit whoredoms with them amen god allowed a plague to come and that plague began to kill thousands of them why because they brought a corruption on themselves because god wanted this nation to stay isolated and separated to him alone and now they begin to mix with another religion bringing in what we're a church you're a church the moabites came amen from lot lot laid with his oldest daughter she had she had moab moab was a cousin to them they were related they they believed in jehovah they got that from lot they were fundamental but when they began to mix themselves together that's when god began to bring a punishment he says i'm not going to have that mixing god hates that mixing in 1965 and god does does god ever change his mind about his word he said there we find out that balaam went down there and he began to teach the people and he had an error and he run the way of balaam how they that he did and taught balak and the children of israel committed adultery and a plague struck the nation of israel and people and thousands of them died in one day and while they were all there before the altar of god praying here come an israelite man with a midianite woman a denominational woman and went into the tent and the priest's son walked over there and took a javelin and killed them both and that stayed god's wrath you know that scripture is that right everything that was natural to israel spiritual to the church god hates that fornication with those denominational spirits he hates the mixing of the pure word with man's idea about the word we're christian they're christian we're all the same it's not the same moab and israelites were not the same god was calling a nation out of a nation to separate him to himself and he was revealing himself to them amen and there was a perversion form of jehovah worship over here mixed with idolatry and they were wanting to blend the thing together it's exactly what's happening in this day and that's the way constantine found to trip up the christians amen couldn't curse them tried to kill them amen and then just kept growing their faith kept growing tried to kill them out tried to torture him in coliseums so what did constantine try to do he decided just to mix them in with the pagan religion of rome and his plan was successful he said but what happened balaam he succeeded in weakening israel what was the strength of israel their separation what was the strength of samson his nazirite vow what is the nazarite vow it's a vow of separation separation unto god but when he cut the locks of his vow he lost his strength what was the strength of israel there's separation from all other nations what is the strength of his bride church today her separation from all denominations denominations are man-made not god-made the word is god's plan and the revelation on the word is god's plan he let them weaken their camp and polluted the whole camp and when some doctrine starts it's not the bible truth it pollutes the whole camp somebody raise up with a different idea like cora and say well this that and the other and i got a different idea it pollutes the whole camp and that's what's done the whole church camp today teaching as he did weakening the whole camp for kadish barnia the word showdown when they got to katie's barnea then the weakening of the camp they came back they had went right after remember they had eaten angels food they had the word of god every night made manifest that they eat food they drank from the rock they did all seen the miracles they watched moses and seen his words seen as prophecies everything and then finally when they listen to this false teacher come in among them and teach wrong he weakened the camp and prospered by it you have to understand when what did these israelites have that went up to the feast of bail pior what did they have what did they lack what did they need they had everything god had provided food in the wilderness he provided water when they needed it he gave them protection what did they need they had no need they were just as secure as eve was in the garden of eden they were under god's leadership they were under his divine protection they had a prophet in their midst amen they had a pillar of fire they had manna that fell every morning they had a smitten rock that was producing water they had quail that would even show up amen they even had when when they even when they began to murmur and they were bitten by the fiery serpents god even gave them an atonement he even gave them a serpent on the pole that they could look to and be healed they had divine healing they had supernatural provision they had supernatural protection they had supernatural leadership what did they need they didn't need anything why did they go to the feast of baal pior what was lacking in the camp of israel i tell you nothing was lacking in the camp of israel nothing was lacking in eden god was not lacking he was not holding anything back from his children in eden and god was not slack in providing everything that the israelites needed in the exodus journey they had everything what would move them there must have been another attraction that was greater than the attraction in the camp of israel the only way to get you to leave something that's good is if you find something that's better there was something in them that liked what they saw there was something in them that craved that kind of worship that they would leave everything to go and take corruption to satisfy the wants of their own flesh it's a sad story but the story continues today let's go to second timothy ii timothy verse four second timothy verse four and or chapter four i'm sorry chapter four let's read verse 9. this is paul writing he said do thy diligence that comes shortly to me for demeth has forsaken me having loved this present world demas left the apostle of the age he left the light to the gentiles the prophecy from isaiah he left the man with the revelation of the word he left the man who would write the new testament he left the man who was taking law and now he's bringing it into grace and he was showing through the old testament christ you had a man the messenger of the age the man who was breaking down the word what what was there in paul's ministry that was lacking what was there lacking in the word that paul was bringing amen paul was bringing a true revelation of the true god and god would use paul to write the almost the entire new testament amen what was it demas could not hang with paul anymore not because there was a lack in paul but he left paul because he loved this present world there was something enticing and the prophet of god said demas never stopped being religious he was just as religious as he always was but he wanted he wanted to satisfy the flesh and worship god at the same time brother brahm said in the god of this evil age the children of obedience and disobedience has nothing in common the disobedience worship their god they say we believe yes it's a mixed tree they add the word and the knowledge to it satan's tree mix see she took from satan's tree good and evil oh we believe the word sure but not all of it eve believed the word too let satan take his tree and pervert it a little bit that's what it is whosoever shall have one word or take one word from him he is still the same yesterday today and forever notice all right this evil age is of darkness yet belongs to church do you believe that this evil age is full of darkness yet belongs to church and see that belonging to church becomes the covering i belong to church i believe in god but it's not believing in god that brings salvation because the devils believe in god and tremble but it's believing god the whole world believes in god the devils believe in god but there's got to be a people that believe god and when god speaks they believe it when god reveals they receive it there's got to be people not just believing in god but believe god that's what the heroes in in hebrews chapter 11 all had that was different than the rest of the world in their day amen the rest of the world in their day believed in god in abraham's day they believed in god in noah's day they believed in god and daniel's day they believed in god is that true but daniel believed god amen abraham believed god noah believed god what god said in that day for salvation noah accepted it and he acted upon it the whole world believes in god but you have to believe god and god is the word he and the word are the same thing the word came out from god it's a part of god it's god expressed the word of god is not something that we just mix and match with our own thinking for our own lustful desires to worship any way we want it's something that that reflects the very character of god and if we love god we love his word if we love his word we love him this evil age is of darkness yet belongs to church their god they love him for it they the way he lets them do they have no condemnation nothing bothers them as long as they belong to church balaam taught the church the same thing let us unite we're all the same it was the last trick god never forgave them for believing such a lie brother branham he has a vision or a dream and he's in in this dream and he's going to see the preview of the bride so familiar with this but but he sees the first new testament church coming through the fresh church out of pentecost he watches them move through all clean and all marching in step and they they go off then he sees the worldly laodicean church moving through and he said oh they were vulgar and dirty and hardly had any clothes on at all and twisting to rock and roll music and they went off into oblivion they began to fall down into the abyss and he was he was heartbroken because he thought of all the labor of all the preaching of all i've done that's the church that i have to present to you lord and then he began to hear marching and a beat and onward christian soldiers and soon he saw another bride coming by that was just like the first one marching in step to time to the word but right in the back at the end right at the tail end this church was getting out of step getting out of line because as they were walking through they were supposed to be living at the review stand and on the review stand was the angel of the lord and the prophet of god and their eyes were supposed to be fixed where the angel of the lord was and working through a prophet of god but they got their eyes off and began to look at the worldly church that was undressed marching the time of rock and roll music moving off into the abyss and as they began to focus on that and get their focus off the review stand they begin to misstep and they begin to get off course and brother benham wakes up screaming get back in line get back in line amen because he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle she's going to be washed by the water of the word and this pure word is going to wash away all the ideas of man all the fallacy of religion all the foolishness of denominationalism there's over 40 000 denominations in the world are they all right are they all wrong is some right some wrong who decides who's right who's wrong who has the authority to pass the judgment on which one's right and which one's wrong it's all man-made god sent a prophet in this day to pull us out of that nonsense and bring us back to the word and the devil's so slick that he tries to get the very bride that he's pulled out and got her marching with the word trying to get her to interested in what the worldly church is doing what's that music they're listening to there's something about it i kind of like keep focusing and all sudden that i like that dress it's kind of cute they're christians i'm christians they're believers i'm a believer how did the israelites walk out of the camp of israel with a tabernacle and a pillar of fire how did they walk out of their tent that morning and gather up an overfull of manna and go inside and eat it and think you know what i think i'm going to go up to that feast of baal pure how how could they do such a thing they begin to watch the moabites and they begin to watch the millions until something inside of them a lust a craving for that kind of worship was awakened and they left what was pure and good and clean and under god and they began to go to worship in a way that was appealing to the flesh i say god scream out in this day get back in step get back and step to the word forget what the worldly church is doing forget what the denominations are doing there's a camp here there's a king in the camp a shout of the king is in the camp the atonement is here the pure food from heaven is here the pure water from the rock of christ is here everything that you need is here there's no reason to leave this camp of the message there's no reason to get wondering and curious about what they're doing and they're doing this and well they're cousins to us if they can do it i can do it it doesn't matter what anybody else is doing amen you keep your eye on the review stand where that a that pillar of fire was present with that prophet that's how they marched in step remember the first church when pro when brother benham saw in that dream when he saw that original church come by those original little ladies from pentecost none of them looked away from that review stand let that be an example for us today friends look to the review stand don't take your own idea and own reasoning as soon as you begin to look at the worldly church and say well all of a sudden reasoning starts to kick in is it really that bad i mean what's bad about it what makes it bad i know brother branham said but i don't really i don't really see that in the scriptures just because you don't see in the scriptures don't mean it's not in the scriptures the prophet of god is always preaching the scriptures always preaching the scriptures he may not quote the verse but you be diligent you'll find it because it's in the bible this message is the word of god restored back to the church in the end time man ruined it the catholic church took the bibles from the people amen they stripped them down and didn't let them have the word of god but god was faithful through luther's age he began to restore and bring the word back and what is god's goal been he's trying to bring an exodus out of denominationalism and bring people back to the camp of himself amen so that he can reveal himself to his bride and so that he can be unified with her and they will be unified with him and him only and not mix it with ideas of man and concepts by groups of men and theological seminaries and understandings and all of that i tell you i think it's shameful to be in the camp of israel that day to wake up and eat the manna stretch and see the cloud over the tabernacle and ask your neighbor what are the moabites doing did you hear about this feast of baal pure what'd you hear well i heard this and i heard they do this and i heard they had that yeah i mean that's that can't be all that bad what do you think i don't know i i mean they're worshiping jehovah we worship jehovah when they close in prayer they say jesus christ and hate his word and rebel against his commandments well you know they say they believe but do contrary to what the prophet taught us i said let's wake up in the morning and eat some manna and look out at the pillar of fire and say thank you god this is all i want i want nothing more than your word i want nothing more than the revealed word i want all that you have for me i don't want my own idea i don't want my own desire i don't want to worship just in a way that feels good to me god i want to bring you a worship that you desire i want to bring you a worship that's pleasing to you i want to bring you a worship that matches every word in this book that you've given me god did not restore this bible back to his church for us to reject half of what's in there he restored it to us and he sent a prophet in this day to prove that it's still true it's still applicable and the revelation of today will still keep you and he went through great extents to bring us a bible and bring us a prophet with vindication that will bring us back to the right interpretation of this word not so that we could wonder what the moabites are doing and look at the church going off in oblivion and be like i don't know that may not be so bad he wants us to wake up every morning and say i am so satisfied i am so thankful this is the only thing i've ever wanted all my life i just wanted god from the time i was a child i can testify to you from the time i was a little boy the only thing i wanted was god i never wanted a church i never wanted a religion i wanted god but i didn't know what it was so i thought i had to go to church and find him and i thought i had to believe like my parents to find him and i thought i had to do what the preacher said to find him but god planted a seed down inside of me and that seed wanted him and him only i didn't want anything mixed with it i didn't want a hybridization by man i didn't want anything that even come up from my own thinking all i wanted was god and if all you want is god well i got good news this is the unveiling of god this is the revealing of his plan in the last day this is the revealing of the mystery of god why do we as believers want to even look at what someone else is doing we should be so consumed with the manna so consumed with the sweet water so attracted to the pillar of fire that there's no other attraction see when you're attracted to the word you don't need legalism you don't need rituals you don't need rules you don't need a church order none of that is necessary you don't need to say well to go to this church you got to dress this way and you got to look this way and you got to do that you don't need that if all you're attracted to is the word of god then the word of god is available and if you're attracted to the word of god and you see the word of god said just where you say amen you see the word of god says conduct yourself this way amen the word of god says go to church you say amen not because i have to in order to be a believer but because i'm a believer i'm so attracted to the word that i i can't be distracted have you ever seen a couple a teenage couple that is engaged in getting ready to be married they're not distractible you're sitting in the same room everybody's a talking and you're like hey hey hey there's people here and they're looking at each other and one will say [Music] like fill us in can we be part of your conversation all their other friends they don't get the same text messages they used to get they don't get all the visits they something's changed because there's an attraction and that attraction eliminates distraction not a have to not a forced religion not a beating it over somebody's head so you better not do this you better not do that you better not do that oh if you ever get attracted to jesus christ you won't be distracted by all the things of the world all the movies and entertainments and fashions and entertainment places and what every other church is doing it doesn't matter anymore i'm so satisfied with this i haven't even looked up to see but there's an attraction that can lead to a distraction away from the things of god and that is what the devil is attempting to do in this day let's go to numbers 23. we'll read this as we wind down to a close numbers 23 9 this is god speaking through balaam as balaam was trying to curse israel chapter 23 verse 9 says for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations when god looked down that's what he saw when god looked down that's what he wanted he wanted a nation that would stand alone and not be reckoned with the other nations what does god want now he wants a bride that will come out of the churches and not be reckoned with the denominations that will stay alone with god with his word and let his word be her guiding light amen brother baby says in the pergament church age now in spite of the fact that balaam knew the proper approach to god and could bring forth a revelation from the lord by means of a special enduman of power he was still for all of that a bishop in the false group for what did he do now in order to win favor with balak he formulated a plan wherein god would be forced to deal with israel and death just as satan knew that he would begow eve cause her to fall in fleshly sin thus causing god to pass his pronounced sentence of death against sin so balaam knew that if he would if he could get israel to sin god would have to deal with him in death so he planned a way to get them to come over and join in sin he sent out invitations to come to the feast of baal pior come over and worship with us now israel no doubt had seen the feast of the egyptians back in the denominations that they were brought out of so they did not feel it was too wrong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people just a little participation a little bit of mingling where did they see that back in egypt so it's they were desensitized to it what's wrong with fellowship anyway we're supposed to love them aren't we or how can we win them being friendly never hurt anyone or so they thought but when the sexy moabitish women began to dance and undress while they whirled around doing their rock and roll twist the lust rose up in the israelites and they were drawn into adultery and god and wrath slew 42 000 of them and that and that is what constantine and his successors did at nicaea and after nicea they invited the people of god to the convention and when the church sat down to eat and rose up to play partaking of the church form ceremonies pagan feasts named after christian rites she was trapped she had committed fornication and god walked out when any man turns from the word of god and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he is don't join a church don't get into an organization and get taken up with creeds and traditions or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from god that is what has happened in every age sense god delivers the people they come out by the blood sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit but after a while the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back in a second generation and sometimes even before then they no longer have the spirit of god just a form of worship they are dead they have hybridized themselves with creed and form and there's no life in them so balaam got israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion that's why these that's why these stories from the old testament are so pertinent to us amen they happen naturally to israel but these are spiritual these same spirits are alive today spirits don't die what happened to israel as a physical nation has happened to the church amen by these same spirits coming in and causing spiritual fornication and adultery as i said the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire that is what god thinks of organization yes sir the and her daughters will be in the lake of fire denominations are not of god they never have been and never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of god into hierarchy and laity and it's therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people that's what organization and denominations do in organizing they separate themselves from the word of god and bring themselves into spiritual adultery why because their husband is jesus christ the word and when they begin to flirt around with something else they begin to want something other than christ now they don't want to throw away christ they still want christ because they need him to get to heaven and deliverance when they're sick and they need all the benefits of being married to christ but still want to flirt around a little bit like they did before they were married because of the way it makes them feel satisfying and gratifying and i enjoy but christ wants a bride that's reserved to him only let's go to john chapter 6. the gospel of john chapter 6. i quoted this but i'd like to read it together verse 6 or chapter 6 verse 67 jesus had already said unless you drink the flesh drink the blood of the son of man in his flesh you have no part with me they said it's a hard saying and he says what and if you see the son of man ascend to where he was before and they left and jesus then said jesus unto the twelve will you go will you also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life what was attracting peter peter was attracted to the word of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered them have not i chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve jesus had made some hard statements without explanation and in the hard statements that couldn't be comprehended intellectually they walked away hundreds and dozens and they walked away and finally he got down to his 12 and he turned and he says will you go away also and peter because he had a revelation of who jesus christ was he said unto whom will we go thou alone have the words of eternal life what he's saying is there's no other place to get what i'm attracted to there's no other place to go to have the thing that i want amen what was peter declaring he wanted the words of eternal life where should i go thou alone has what i want you alone have the thing i'm craving you alone have the thing that i'm desiring where shall i go to find the mind of god the message of the hour where else will you find the word of eternal life the bible come alive the word restored to its proper place peter when they were leaving masses of people leaving rejection coming on on every hand pressure building everywhere jesus was not trying to keep anybody he wanted them to come by faith by revelation not by enticement not by intellectualism not not by a pool of emotion amen jesus wasn't working on any of those things he was just giving the word and letting it fall giving the word and letting it fall and as he did all of that without trying to save his congregation without trying to pull people he looked at his 12 he got down to 12. he wasn't nervous he wasn't afraid because he knew all that the father has given me shall come to me and all of you given to me i will lose none peter he looked at them will you guys go also he didn't say please stay he said you want to go peter said there's no place else i can go to get what my heart is hungering for the same thing's true today you and i can go anywhere we want there's no strings attached there's no hold on us we can go anywhere i want but i've only ever found one place i've only ever found one place and that's in this restored word in this hour this message that god gave us i've only found one place that satisfies what i've been longing for all my life there's only one place amen that when when this word opens up it begins to draw life out of the inside of me where it's not a put on it's not a religion it's not fig leaves but there's an actual life on the inside of me being unlocked by the word of god and it's not a life i live anymore it's a life he lives through me there's only one place and the only place is in christ and christ is the only one that has the word of eternal life let's become so satisfied so in love so hungry with that that it doesn't matter how many people are walking away how many people are saying what they're saying and how enticing this is and how beautiful that is there was no beauty that we should behold him and when we saw him he was despised and rejected that's what peter saw in the carnal but there was another attraction for peter let's go to jeremiah 15. i'm just going to read a few scriptures right in a row as we close jeremiah 15. jeremiah 15 and 16 thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy in rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts is this scripture talking about you let's read it again and you tell me if this scripture's talking about you thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of host if his word is the rejoicing of your heart don't worry there'll be no other attraction amen let's go to psalms 119. and i would recommend to you this week just read through all of psalms 119. it's the longest book in the bible but what i found it to be about the entire time is love for the word of god the whole chapter of 119 is a respect of reverence a love and a fear for the word of god the longest chapter in all the bible is talking about how much the writer loves the word of god stands by the word of god rejoices in the word of god feeds on the word of god meditates on the word of god let's look at verse 72 the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver let's go to verse 103 how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth verse 127 therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea above fine gold this is somebody who's attracted to the word and they found the greatest attraction of their life it's worth more than gold it's worth more than silver it's sweeter than honey in my mouth this is what peter had found did peter understand it in the day that he spoke it no but peter had found the thing that was satisfying what was inside of him he said thou alone whom will i go thou alone has the words of eternal life but he says have not i chose you twelve in one of you is a devil judas was chosen by jesus christ but he was a devil from the beginning and he didn't have what peter had peter seemingly the ministry was losing everything but peter said i have no place else for me to go there's only one satisfying plow there's only one well that gives me this clean water but judas ran and exchanged the word of eternal life for 30 pieces of silver judas was attracted by something else the greatest attraction in his life was not christ i don't want to be a judas we've known of people who have sold christ for a lot less than 30 pieces of silver they sold him for a man sold him for a woman sold him for a job sold him for family members is that true left the word of god and rejected it for far less than 30 pieces of silver but there's a people in this earth that can find nothing else satisfying but this smitten rock this manna from heaven this word that has been restored to us in this hour let's all stand musicians if you'll come with blake if you'll come i just want to tell you whatever you're attracted to will finally manifest when i say god i'm attracted to your word keep me all gone the greatest thing in my life is this manna the greatest thing that i've ever tasted is this fresh clean water flowing from the throne of god this word is our portion this word is our meat this word is our life let's not be distracted by anything else let's not worry about the moabites this or that let's look up every morning in the camp of israel and say there's no place i'd rather be let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word lord that is so rich god i want to say i'm thankful lord that you put down inside of me something that i could have not pretended made up intellectually received but you put faith down in my heart you gave me the capacity to believe you lord and god i want to stand like peter and i want to declare whom should i go lord you alone have the words of eternal life that's what i want lord your life the life of the word living in me i want to be united with you i want you and you only god i pray that you'd preserve us from man's ideas preserve us from the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life as we follow after you and eat your manna that you're raining down upon us daily and drinking from the smitten rock i pray god that you would take every desire for the world out of us that our greatest desire would be you and you alone god help us to resist the temptation to look what any other group of people are doing lord let us just follow after you as individuals let us not look to the right or to the left but lord let's keep our eye lord we want to keep our eye on that review stand staying focused so we can catch the signal so that we know the steps help us to stay true oh god for it's your grace in our lives you've brought us this far you'll take us all the way god we want no other attraction in our life but the traction of the word it's greater to us than thousands of gold and silver it's sweeter to us than the sweetest honeycomb it is our life god bless your people i pray god that you move with us as we go and may we go rejoicing that we have found the pearl of great price something that's worth selling all others for and taking just this may we be so thrilled we found the fountain of the waters of life we found the bread of life lord we found the source by your grace you've brought us lord out of egypt god let us not get caught up in a feast of baal pure but let us stay true to you by your grace by your will in our lives we commit ourselves to you and we declare unto you that you're our greatest love you are love above all other loves we consecrate ourselves solely unto you in jesus christ's name we pray amen there
