Luke the second chapter at the 41st verse st. Luke the second chapter the 41st verse now his parents were speaking about Jesus Christ went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover and when he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus Terry behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey just goes to show you that you just can't suppose anything and you got to make sure of all things and they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintances and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking Him he came to pass that after three days death burial resurrection they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why has thou dealt with us dealt thus with us behold thy father and I sought thee sorrowing he said unto them how is it that she sought me wist ye not that I must be about my father's business and they understood not they understood not the scene which he spake unto them and he went down with them came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in her heart she pondered these things and Jesus while she was a pondering increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man made God a blessing to the reading of his word I can see from the look on some faces that they are understanding this he already it's the Holy Spirit bringing out his word this morning so we see friends here that over here in the book of Ibuka is speaking about a work that Jehovah God says that he will work in our days and he says that it'll be among the heathen and he says though it be told to you some would not believe it and we know that Paul quoted this over in acts 13 41 he said behold you despise us and wonder and perish for I will work a work in your days a work which he shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you this was Paul speaking when he was up there with the Jews who refused who denied they only savior the Lord Jesus Christ therefore Paul turned from the Jews for it was God's time to turn to the Gentiles and here he quoted this scripture back here in the book of a book the first chapter the fifth verse here so we see friends that God's Word is true it comes to pants but God has a lot of his word for a specific time and season and then all we have to do is so wait until this time and this season our eyes on the scene then God Himself will manifest his own word and it will need no and no interpretation now we find in friends that the work that he's speaking about here is that he is going to work a work and this work is he active work of Jesus Christ that will be in these human temples this is the work that he said he would call out a people for his name from among the Gentiles he would take out a people for his name and then it taking out these people he will work a work in their hearts and many around them friends and families and and so forth would not understand the work for the word said they will not understand the way they will one the Marvis and if what meaneth this they will permanently heart what meaneth this but however God will go on work in the work and Amon inside of man and he will not understand it so then with this thought in mind we begin to get a little understand that God does a hidden secret work away from the prying eyes of the world in the heart then that thought can be planted embedded in our minds in our hearts then we can begin to understand God without it you'll never understand God so we see friends in with this understanding and with this revelation for this is reveal to your hearts Jesus Christ said that he would have a bride in the end time Jesus Christ said that he was sending Loretta according to America for to call out this bride Jesus Christ the Word of God says that st. Luke's 17:30 then he himself would represent himself in this age through a man as the Word of God for the age Jesus Christ said also that in Revelation 10 7 and his own book of redemption there he said that all the mysteries of God would be revealed gives us a clue that when all the mysteries would be revealed then that time that age would have to be the full word age in a while you read minute then you can begin to understand friends that in 63 we entered an - not knowing - the full word age why because all the mysteries was revealed they then God Himself come down and revealed himself you human skin and hid himself to the word Amen praise His name he said that melikhaya fall and that maybe should I hope so would turn the hearts of the ones that I have predestinated to be turned back to they wouldn't want them obviously anymore for they'll see myself in the Word of God expressed on their with the same size wonders and miracles therefore the bride will have to wonder as they still baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ disease these things still right is he still working they would see it for themselves and we have seen we have heard and we have seen with these RS here and a pillow firewood follow it with signs and wonders Americans why is this for this would be the age when there would be all kinds of places of worship the Baptist place of worship the Pentecostal the Methodists and so forth and so on and other groups but however in this age we find that God has only one place of worship you cannot please God you cannot worship God in spirit and truth other than this one place and that is the Word of God which is Jesus Christ all outside of this are lost they are dead and because many have said that I have Christ over here because of no at once I have it over in northern ones he would prove that he was sent forth his word now care for to bring to nought to bring to nothing to take the wise and their own craftiness bring all these places of worship bring it to nothing and so that the true place of worship is in the same Tabernacle a type of back in the wilderness the tabernacle of witness which was Malachi for in this age a man a tabernacle a temple and then and he would be fair in that temple in that place of worship in that terminal who's seeking God who will turn and seek God and come back to the temple and it will look from their ownselves those who seek God who sought God they'd find God in that tabernacle that Tabitha's Malachi 4 it was Malachi 4 now we all understand that but we are all here this morning all of us are wondering pondering Lord what is going on now amen we're trying to figure out what is going on in this hour we know that because Elijah has come we know that God has vindicated Elijah it's here we know that but we want to know what is God doing in this hour at man amen well then this is what my message because this morning is about now we find in better you can worship God outside of Christ the word for the full word came into manifestation in 63 and wants to come on the scene that is his only place of worship they can gather on the mountains they can get up on the hilltops amen they can run to the East the West North itself but they must be in the word to please God amen I don't care where you go ahead but you must be in the Word of God now notice friends how can God bring us how can he bring it to pass he said not by might not by power but by my spirit saith or an amen all right how's it done the word the mechanical word speaks it it must be in here therefore back when God created the earth the word sent let be light to you ain't it that's all then the word had to wait for the snot the power the night but the spirit a meant to create the light there's the word speaker let there be light the Spirit of the Lord moved out and created the light and there was light God has not changed from this system God has said in this hour let there be a bright the word to speak it amos pictus we must wait on the Lord and let the folds of the Spirit of God brood over us and mold us and shape us and create us into the Living Word of God to be expressed in the entire you understand well therefore freeze of you puttering if you're wondering this morning the Holy Spirit God Himself the fullness the anointing because the seven the seven course meal is here because we have a full square meal all the word seven Costa seven seals and because that whole thing is here they caught the fullest himself could be here to create his own work and I like this work in this day though a man declared unto you in oil and you come with signs and wonders and miracles though he declared unto you you will not believe it for the father didn't call you all that the father has given me they will come we don't have to beg and persuade no by this morning comets people can't help but come not into heavenly spaces praise God said let there be a pride okay honey devil said don't be a brain I mean false and oil was around there is gonna be a bird poor Gus take it and the Holy Spirit is doing it now but they can't say it is a secret and they cannot see they cannot discern the spiritual things of God the natural man we're just speaking in tongues or whatever you want to have cannot discern the work that God is doing in the hearts already turn the hearts back to the word and we'll prove it this morning amen praise His name so we find friends that God is going to bring to naught all other places of worship this morning bring them all the north so we see them if we understand this then that as we move through the Pentecostal age when we came in 1963 for God to move he had to move into fullness to bring forth a full word okay did it listen to the statement in then at the opening of the seven seals according to revelation 10 7 the full word all mysteries that's the full word saying is to be born into manifestation and we saw the manifestation through the prophet Elijah then the full word was born name anything and vindicated by the Spirit of God now notice now it will be in full strength manifest in the same wing doing that what it did when it was healing the air other words the full word of God when it walked the earth in a earthly tabernacle Jesus Christ is the coming in his full anointing and walk barrier through melikhaya for another temple another Tabernacle amen but it would be in the secret place in the heart amen and manifest itself and catch away a bread by the manifestation of Jesus Christ and only where the people will know it God Himself will anoint their eyes what I said that they might see it yes no no they understand what is happening the work that is happening in their day and a bright you have understood it you have left your baptism methods and so forth and you have come because God has unknown at your hands to see any in turn amen are you understanding this well then this is the redemptive work of Jesus Christ going on right now in your myths so we find friends that notice now bring the word into your heart and watch it make itself known as it opens up like any other seed once that statement now the seat is in your heart the water the full anointing has come then it opens up the seed and the Sun is here to ripen that seed if it's a word it says it declared that it is the word it believes the word you don't have to beg and persuaded a minute you have to pet it it's not no because a worthy song because of because haha seeds over there amen it just tastes the natural rainfall the natural holy spirit it doesn't need them worked up they don't need no private revelation of a tent somewhere it believes the Word of God amen the seat opens up your faces to seed opens when the Holy Spirit's the word and takes it to your heart you can scream anyway this is Holy Spirit take it to your heart you open up and you see it you understand it God has anointed you I insist and praise God why is it this is the word each the brownies the we teach the Eagle age the Eagle seat and this is going on now this is different from all the rest of the ages altogether different Luther in his time of justification his works testify who he was Wesley his works testified who because who he was the Pentecost is in 1906 their works testifies through speaking in tongues and casting out Devils that was to work in that day but now friends today the sea is a sea turn amen this is green maturing green writing time wine for the seed of God is in your heart and it is producing Christ by itself by the Spirit of God that's why the Prophet came forward and said friends get in Christ a preacher can't save you I cannot save you no man can save you the Prophet knew that all the seeds of God when appreciate last February in 65 that that they would come into a third Pole they would be all confused so he pointed them to Christ the Scriptures also said that those who wouldn't understand when heap into themselves teachers having itching ears for a private revelation somewhere when the word of God will ripen you the Word of God will plant you the Word of God will water you and bring you up and also mature you the way to gotta do it so therefore the work that is going on now the Caesar gone have been sold by the Son of Man himself all over the world through his tapes through his books he put the seed in the heart God is able to raise up those seasoned himself and cannot do it fakes become priests God that man can't do it today he cannot though he tries if he can't do it don't look to man look to Jesus Christ he is the only one amen so we find friends that this age is different now if they work the works of God in 1906 up to 63 by speaking in tells the casting out Devils okay you made me now if they work the works of Wesley by being sanctified and also shaking the spirit if they work the works of Luther just by coming out of the Catholic Church and believing in the Word of God that's all we require well this age is different no longer is speaking in tongues enough this is the full word I just explained it to you therefore we have word Saint John 6:29 the people say well how can we work that works in the full word each Lord by believing on him that is sit are you understanding now well then right now in August is seven nineteen sixty-six you want to know what's going on God is working to works as you believe the word Amen this on tape is in the books he's working the works it's a hit work that's all you have to do share and let God work the work in your heart in this state while the others don't understand it while the others wonder about it pioneer no heart God is working the work you are taking on the nature of the Lamb not a go all wolf amen the Holy Spirit dove is leading you leading it right on into the resurrection it's very simple is very humble and this age man gets no glory big man gets no glory big apostle big bishop prophet he gets nothing so why because only when he identify himself with the dispersed the only the weak things if he put himself there will he saw me I'm so you're nothing nothing go in the silly women are keeping to themselves teachers leading down with lusts when it's the Word of God to work stoked to work the works in this hour it is the Word of God that will work no works that's all are you so we've had friends this morning that this is seat time this is Brad time now we see friends that this work of God goes on in a two-fold way first is hidden from all prey eyes just manifested outside amen all right then the seat of God could not be growing in you until the word age King is that right and it can only grow you under the folds of the Spirit and that came in 63 then God it would be impossible for God to pour the Holy Spirit up on you the way he dare upon His Prophet in 63 for you didn't know the will of God but it's on the message there's the will of God and is it a message for you didn't know what to do you know what to eat but he brought you a seven course meal he bought you a full square meal it takes a little while each of meal enjoy it don't bet you want to run out the door somewhere while you take on your meal need a little water with it amen praise come amen listen be the name of the local praise God but they want to belch and run over here where's all run over there right over there sit still you don't want to stand anyway bliss is a special meal savor the taste average savory amen savory raise this is a delicious meal wonderful newest more gracious name but they never understand it see cuz he says Dora you just sponsors you of the word of God though your tongues in your dissing your that the worry it'll work and work anyway laugh well you won't believe except you have a sign a tongue you won't believe except you see signs and wonders you will not believe a corner st. John for 48 you can't believe Amen but the seed of God believes the Word of God amen praise His name now I know this friends with me over here as we close out here now did you get the thought hey you want to try this fought into your hearts turn to st. Luke 241 praise His name now notice ma'am we're speaking about Jesus Christ this morning man she turned it in this work this word all of God's power is in this word now from 1906 to 1963 all of the peril wasn't there it was the gift of the Spirit are you but now since you have are you are still feasting on a seven-course dinner all of it is there seven is complete it's a full square meal amen well all of it is there all right first of all you're supposed to eat the meal then you stand up later on and tell people what a wonderful meal you had outside somewhere well you still eating the meal you're still growing in wisdom and stature yes the work is going on now friends that's going on right now now notice now the Spirit of the Lord that moved upon the face of the waters is moving over you right now is brooding over you in your homes on your jobs creating molding shaping you into sons of God that's what's good but it's hid a man from that the wise and prudent is Rudy over his people right now he's allowing trial to test you to see how you do you follow me now and we're gonna strike a point here you'll see the whole thing this morning by God's grace you should understand now notice now we see then that the Spirit of the Lord is doing the work what kind of work it is now listen reproducing the grain through the word by the fools of the Spirit did you get it now the grain is being reproduced to look just like the original but it's gonna come the same way for God works twofold first is hidden then is manifest are you falling in now then we ought to do what he did we must follow the same way Johnna back as he was hidden also out in the wilderness did he notice at the word of God amen nor was the work that he was doing was hid from the wise he was actually growing into the statue of a perfect man bill in the arc but that was here from those are the wise and true amen they must have thought that Noor was crazy while he was doing that hidden work of God therefore today they come in here they go out there thank you crazy because they don't know they can't see it it's a hidden work they can't see it hey God is doing a hidden work in your hearts now amen briefs come here no notice now let's get to sitting here let's get the time here this is the time when Jesus Christ now I want to type Mary as the shock I'm only typing her for the Prophet typed her as the champ as the shop for she had to seat in her but Mary was saved of course but she represents the Pentecostal church age so therefore she's a type or you instead is now she is saved I'm not saying that she's a chance to be burned up but she's typing out the champ amen praise the Lord now we understand that okay now here were they at a certain season and a certain time they went up to the feast at Jerusalem amen alright now they went up there and they worship and they praise God and they had a wonderful time then it says here in the 43rd verse and when they had fulfilled the days that all that they were supposed to do as they returned the child Jesus tarried be heard in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposed him to have been to have been in the company that's why I said make your election calling Shore don't think he's there make sure he's with you friends by checking it in the word Amen check it now see and they sought him from among their kin folk and acquaintances and they're doing the same thing today they're looking for God in the Baptist the Methodists the Pentecostal amen and speaking in tongues in a tent over here somewhere they looking for God as some teacher some false another one amen they're looking for all over this seeking God face among their relatives I'm only acquaintances when they should have turned to the word amen go back way I left them in the temple and then when they would have found them amen but no May it can't do the first he looks all out there for the word out there for the word is always in a humble place amen despised few amen those who deep the delight of the day as a spoke here is a night we sit how's it occur and also Micah back here can you imagine King Ahab and King Jehoshaphat sitting upon Thrones and said do we have the word Lord for a hundred true prophets of Israel came by one by one and preached their hearts I suppose 400 men from this message today came through here while I'm coming set over here who would you believe the 400 would you believe I was brother Coleman you would believe the word he had to work amen just want to catch you you would believe the Word of God but some most would believe in one of the four hundred because of for Monday's a warning from the message hallelujah he's in the message the same thing same God same blessing yeah because preach the word yes they would they said it then they'll say no they have already said it the message stands still oh no I'm not going away I want to go play I see it writes amen I'm free show you become an eagle eyed fly God but however Jehoshaphat was Spiritist but it got to be somebody else and to see the guy today that they know they can they can see these men come and go but there's something wrong somewhere they are waiting for that true witness on that two words amen on a true word therefore friends notice Jesus here now here they went looking all around for Jesus among the roses and their friends now notice now the word Jesus though young though he had been saved a long time long enough school you know I'm talking about you know exactly what I'm talking about the word though young speak for himself notice here now but when they supposed him to have been in the company I went and when a day's journey they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not to turn back amen they turned back the bread couldn't read it along the Pentecostals in the Baptist Methodist they turned back to the temple to the tabernacle where they saw God in a tabernacle Malachi 4 the bread turned me just like married in here now notice now again to Jerusalem seeking Him and we do in right manner and it came to pass after three days after with death burial resurrection they found him in the temple praise be to God sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished and his understanding and answers well friends the word though young Amen spoke for itself himself he said I am about my father's business amen alright then this scene I am about my father's business no don't let us subpoena you all know what's going on there do you want a secret you don't know what's going on the inside of this Tabernacle alright it's right here there is the secret of the message I am about my father's business there's your secret there's your big secret we are about our father's business for he has revealed his secret his business for the area for the time and you about it craziest me I hope you don't miss him amen now friends what is the father's business to fulfill the word amen hey I saw Jesus Christ had to fulfill the word it is that simple that doesn't take a big solution to come in here and pound into your brain doesn't it's in a word to fulfill the word Jesus Christ because it is because Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive you had to wait until the virgin conceives and then that had to be fulfilled in Christ had to fulfill that amen and all of the other speeches in the Psalms and all down through there had to be fulfilled by the word itself Jesus Christ okay then Jesus had to fulfill the word now notice this now a little teaching in here I hope you get it the turn when he declared or testified or bare record that he was about his father business his father's business was when don't miss it was when he came of age 12 years old it was winner in the Pentecostal age because it wasn't of age are you getting it wasn't loofas age Wesley's age otherwise it wasn't when Christ was 10 years old 8 years old 5 years old but listen now this is is according the word he says today word comes of age no no is this here at age 12 I don't want to miss this I have some notes right here on alright and age 12 Hebrew boys become a son of the law amen and age 12 they have the bomb mission and so forth at age 12 because according to what we understand they become a son of the law which means that their that they all enough to be a servant of Jehovah at this age they all enough to be a servant of Jehovah then friends when he was eleven ten eight or nine he could not say he was about his father's business but it wasn't until he was all enough to be considered a servant according to Hebrew law that he could say he was about his father's business or you understand well then we couldn't be about a father's business in the Pentecostal age for nobody knew what was truth Amen some thought it was tones some thought it was a Jesus name baptism and some for all kind of things but a perfect came at the word age when it was time and told us what the father's business was to fulfill the Scriptures amen did you understand it all right the word came of age to be about the Father's business when Elijah came forth in 1963 with a full square meal all the word a seven-course dinner amen the word came of age I hope you hit the snow the full word came into view the sacrifice came on the scene and the sacrifice when it walked the earth listen had the blood in it when Chris walked the earth it had the blood in it it was shut after right well the sacrifice the blood leaves the mercy seat and comes into Malachi for the word he that receiveth me if you deny that he is you shall perish therefore if they dinner the forward in Malachi for they will perish for the full word came into view Jesus Christ on your hands what are you going to do with him he went on trial he went all over the country is 64 going on trial did you miss it he would not sure so therefore we find him friends in that the full word could not come interview before 1963 because that was the Pentecostal age goo-goo-goo claim with the tongues fighting amen strength emulations and fussin and feudin and you know talk about amen and also Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child amen but when I grew up came of age and I become a man amen Christ become a man and was about his father's business therefore the bread was calling it to be about their father's business amen for their normal children put away childish things in all the fussin and feudin and jealousies and also pet hates and so forth put it away and be men that's what that's what the Bible says alright now we see the friends that we are to walk in the evening light being about a father's business before nighttime comes D Tribulation Period listen just as days since that is the end of a day well the dependi costal age set in evening time and it turns abruptly into darkness but thanks be to God he sent light in evening time amen God sent light to walk from the Pentecostal end of the age grace to walk right into almost into judgment the evening time light takes you in are you understanding amen amen praise God so therefore now we see them there now is the time that we know what to do for in a Pentecostal age there was all kind of heresies they had to be to manifest those that are approved but now we don't have to wonder we don't have to worry them awful we have the word we know exactly what to do we know who is off the word for the prophet has brought the word and we can see we can understand amen so now it is thus saith the word all right now cause presence and God's name is in the word that's why today if you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how can you be in his presence when his name is in the word that's why we are exhorted to repair the one of us and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now what actually something when Christ the floor word came he gave out a promise that write to his disciples they followed him and then this promise was manifested up in the upper room well the same Christ came through Malachi 4 with a promise to you that you will receive the Holy Ghost same same word same promise and is cut to be done but there's a weak glowing on now in hearts is hidden from the rest but God Himself is brooding over his people he's molding reshaping he's forming you into sons of God he's doing those who walk by the spirit that has been revealed through the word those who walk by that I'm molding them I'm shaping them they are a reproach they're going beyond the camp he's outside of the camp's amen they go beyond the camps and they lay hands upon the sacrifice in their they identify himself with Christ but notice friends in Exodus 12 this is only in evening time when you actually lay hands upon the sacrifice amen only Nev in time not the other agents not too dependent on stage because you can speak in tongues in amen and and and also the others you can shout and scream and holler but this Asian must be in the word so you lay hands on the word and identify it in the word amen okay now notice now as we finish reading here and when they saw him the 14th verse they were amazed and his mother said unto Him son one hen stout thus dealt with us behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing he said unto them how is it that you sought me wist ye know of wishing not that I must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man now notice friends we see them that if we seek Him we shall find him now those who happens here when they found him they found out that he wasn't the little Jesus that they had taken update for something transpired amen when you heard the word your Pentecostal feast your pastors your friends your mother's bow that you was not that same little boy in your church you became of age you saw about my father's business if you were a trinitarian youto your pastors and your brothers and so forth that you want to get baptized and name the Lord Jesus Christ and they said why why I why I'm about my father's business you couldn't help it you come of age to believe all the Word of God it's the age of seat time it's prayer time you can't help but believe the Word of God is in you for these chairs a cry out to God they have to cry out they have to testify if God is in you there's not no horsin universe to keep you from being about your father's business that's exactly right praise God now notice now we find in that Jesus just like today a Jesus here he astounded Mary and Joseph all the ministers and the great bishops amen the doctors of the law Jesus a little tour the old word

and for his glory to be Express on their praise God is that right Hey after you fine this morning the Word of God is talking this morning praise His name very lucky to see five minutes more amen all right we find in that many things happen under pay class but not the full truth but full truth wasn't here it had come of age yet amen okay now what those who have come of age they say I'm about my father's business glory to God I believe all the world they can't help it they already clearly are expressing what's in them what's in the heart comes out what comes out they hate the word come on there well that they don't like you if they are prejudiced against color skin is soft will come out of the heart come out of hearts now kiss the fire out of their spirits if the Spirit of Christ you would testify the Spirit of Christ amen believe that phrase in this hour so they can they can hate you they can do it they want to do but I just go on that's the spirit beloved don't believe all the spears trammel if they be of God and go on then smack in the face just like that a cosmic mother because like he's my Quaker he said we're spin a long ago and left me so you find when you finally go into your secret in a chamber you've the same spiritual figures on you now was not on you friend when you give if you go on your knees and go into your secret chamber the Holy Spirit will say Elijah's message thus set laws the dogs will lick because they have blood if you go into entertainment the Holy Spirit will reveal the message to your heart but he'd never hid because he didn't go in it but like I said when you do go in there you find how we're to spare the Lord minute it was in the word amen so we see friends in that over here when Jesus said mage's tremendous statement see Mary understood not what the word said there is chance did you marry is a chance the husk so Mary understand now under type in it singer Mary the Pentecostal Jesus name three guards whoever you want to call them understood not the word for they don't want to be about their father's business because they want to speak in tongues they want a man a bishop a big fat Bishop they want you follow me now to tell them what to do to give them war work to give them more straw and brick but if you will believe on him I'll set you free the truth shall make you free you won't have to make no more bishops throwing bricks no more aiming for you just believe on him that said that's all you free foot is steep did you believe time and I'm sure come on out but if you want to stay there the defeats your takes a whole and mark your ear in your denomination it screws it in there and you won't hear nothing no war that's right yes stay right there so but now listen this three years in here so forth how long I don't know there go on they go on preaching they go on praising they go on blessing God's name but they're lost and don't know it they don't know it see but the bride the hidden Rick is going on in the bride they go on blaspheming saying all kind of crazy things but it goes on anyway so if will Mary understood not what the word says she pondered these things in her heart today they are pondering now right now to learn this up everybody will know what is going on now all the big boys one big boy turned into Joshu eight down here North Carolina from out of Indiana but what but a brother Brad mentor name on a tape I'm a hitman so and so he said at the prophecy for fifteen years but cut how can he be because be Joshua is not revealed to him that's what the word says Amen all the big boys like they all gathering out here now they don't have a big feast Amen well I mean they must be right the Bible says four hundred was wrong and Michael was right amen so that's what don't look God purposely allows the big boys to strut and prophesy and you can see it just strutting up thicker thicker roosters just strutting around you follow me now but God's messes are Eagles they fly high up into the heavenlies they listen to the tapes they let the spirit Lord reveal the message to them they come forth nothing in themselves just humble like and present the Word of God they may look like anybody you found it now they look like something then God couldn't use him because no flesh shall glory in his presence that's hard for people to accept that they cannot do it but I can't help it I must go on I must be about my father's business amen now long in wandering trying to figure out what's going on the seed knows exactly where they can smack the seat and also turn off side that he know is that he stands still he shall not be move he's standing still haven't done all the Stansted anyway amen stand there praise God put up the shield of faith Christa fire it does he understand when God's when the pillow fight says move move but otherwise stand there we're standing right here was standing here with God's Word and we shout out move now notice now quickly the angels from God the messengers with a message right spoke and reveal just enough to Joseph and Mary are you reading me to enable them to know the mission of Jesus isn't it wonderful angels from God came messengers you know messengers came and revealed my dream also to also my dream and also because revealed the word to Joseph and Mary both of them just enough for them to know that Jesus was to save you the word just not to know that they would not trust in old law Haman just enough to know that they wouldn't trust in the pharisees and sadducees just enough to know to worship God and to know that one day soon he must be about his father's business amen all right but like others like today they were slow to comprehend old fools and slow of heart to believe all that the Scriptures have said all the prophets have said amen well just like everybody else they was because slow to understand it to comprehend that's why God had to take his profit off the scene so that this perish sense but because just Semin January we're just moving that the slow and fools our heart would begin to understand and comprehend the work of God a hidden work going on in the house is that beautiful it's going on right now and now you're writing now you're maturing because you can't say brother Brant and pray for me look anymore you pray for yourself now you seek the Lord now yourself amen you got to do it yourself Amen that's God's purpose you see you can't pull on a Ouija board no more so we find in friends that then this became a hidden work as a child grew in wisdom and stature and we are to grow into the statue of a perfect man that right what's going on there you're growing up in the statue of a perfect man you're growing up French all right he was subject going to them we are subject unto Christ now notice knows this now Mary the type of the chair hugged Jesus see Jesus began to pull away at the Pentecostal feast there right well this see that God is pulling away from the chaff now when Mela when a Malachi 4 Cain the seed began to pull away and once Jesus began to pull away it was no stopping him the holly started to grow in wisdom in the Statue of God in the scripture of God Himself for he's needed by the Spirit of God brooding over molding you shaping you into sons of God that's what's going on now French as Jesus pulled away from married a chair he just pulled all the way to God he saw nothing but Jesus Christ and saw nothing but God Himself that saw the word that's all he saw he was about his father's business the Lambs of God a lamb being led to the slaughter amen that's what's going on now now notice now Mary hung Jesus the word while he grew in secret amen you're going a secret memory right they don't understand you your husbands and fathers and friends and the Pentecostals the rest of them they don't understand what you're doing you still believe this man you still hear tapes you still gather together amen where's the secret where it going on they can understand though all working working there they they all never understand that the spices of God's Word they won't understand it he's doing it now so yeah okay he grew in secret to the world amen the world didn't know that the Savior was right there Jesus Christ hey little carpenter right he was working to the world in secret to the world veiled in human skin right until time to go forth fully ripened with signs one is Americans well now how could he go forth before he was thirty like some want to do now Joshua waves and ten ministries and so forth he had to wait for God's time the Prophet laid out five things you must do must be God's turn the season you must be a call to do it must be according to the message the Prophet must be Vindi how can you do it now friend sit down and wait a while God is doing the hit and working your heart where you're going fish a meal a man is delicious meal if you leave it because you say it because you don't like the meal a minute is still there hey man praise the Lord I hope you got that one there yeah amen finish your meal sit down amen praise God now Christ worked to fold hidden work declared itself by producing the green then right the green is being reproduced what you cannot have the other finished product until this is reproduced first so it's a hidden work going on that you see it no you can't have that over this there but just you must go through here first amen say so therefore rest in the Lord rest in the Lord wait on the Lord he's doing the work amen now he'll manifest the work with science and wonders not quickly God's prophet was hid in a Pentecostal shook all down since 1933 Sarah a hidden work was going on in a man a little humble man down in Anna a hidden work of God he was growing in wisdom and in stature fired in favor with man and dog since 1933 his profit was growing in wisdom and in stature finding favor with men and with God so much favor with God until I angel appeared to him so I'll give you a gift now go on out to the world now you found favor with God you have enough wisdom now to go with this gift in order to do with it amen all right how could God give you the same thing in 63 when you come himself you got a friend failure you have to grow in wisdom and statue with God he'll do the same thing he'll come down a crown will overshadow Peter now we're trying to build other Tabernacles spear to Peter today all in the land you follow me now on the mountains and so forth while they're trying on this holy man on the moon a holy God is holy but they want to build escalators and all kind of crazy up on the mountains amen why are they doing there well Kyle's the second coming of Christ will come and overshadow the whole thing but the true seat will look around they'll see Jesus Christ in the resurrection hey hey man all of the tavern acts will fail aid s right for Christ will be on the scene man all right friends we find in that prophet was hit in the shook and he came forward and they kicked him out there right Christ the word the Prophet was in the shock and they kicked him out finally he was finished in 1960 and he just waited on God that's all when he preached the seventh church ages and offered up the sacrifice he asked God to give him a sign a pillar fire come down the fire come down like he lie until you understand it now and accepted his seven churches which was the Word of God and he was finished and they kicked him out and the Pentecostals were finished with him amen and then he waited for that special last call that he had to do and he did it he gave us a seven-course meal a full square meal and they pull on him they're mad because he died in madness the man that he gave I mean why I put on the waiter after he has put the recall of food before you don't you have enough put on it for more he'd give it to your whole seven-course meal you'll need no more just a glutton if so hey man this guy yes it's very plain isn't it amen we're trying to get you to eat what he put me for you the Bible says some eat one set before you amen mr. word and also don't complain now notice now the word the arch was fully manifested see it was fully manifested in a tear and that's it the natural man screaming look around for Tam somewhere but it was right before them humbled all right Malachi for walking around God himself sail to the tenth seekers and science seekers but unveil to the bride amen and he even told him God hidden in simplicity the turma come when the Son of Man would be on earth the judgment would be fallen and the disciples will come run and scream it while wasn't that supposed to be this wasn't it supposed to be that wasn't he lying supposed to come he's already coming you didn't know what can I tell you believe on him that is sent now the message is here alright friends I'm not I'm probably because I gonna close now it was fully manifested attempt Tabernacles the third pole a secret now notice now as a type because in closing God always does His redemptive work hidden away from prying eyes that right back in the back in the wilderness when Aaron the high priest when he went into the Holy of Holies nobody saw what he did in here amen he went into the third pool in the inner sanctum in the secret room in there there was the Ark right there was the mercy seat in the blood and when he finished his redemptive work the Shekinah glory came not on the top of it but inside of it and set between the two cherubs that write and accepted the whole thing then the high priest walked out and manifested himself after his hidden work there right well he's doing the same thing today he did a hidden work in Malachi 4 on your hearts for in the Hope Chest they are it's called a hope chest amen in that chest in there was the two tablets only knew that I form an old and so forth and also Aaron's rod life in the heart life the rod but it justification it blossom sanctification and it bear annan's fruit amen all right you also had in there the golden mana the golden manner it stay with you all the time amen see what you all the time for is quickened you get it now when the fullness of God come in 63 that spirit quickened the whole Bible and it's breathing up over the whole Bible now in the Pentecostal age it breathable the tongues and so forth and man had great revelation up because along those lines but now just open the Bible and friends if you're called of God if you feed you out of there some way in there because the whole thing is quick in here now he quickened it it means it's made of Lies then it could be spoken into your hearts in you alive before that before most of it was letter this is Malachi 4 st. Loup 1730 revelation 10 7 the white horse rider these things were there in 1962 uh Nicky see that it was a mare could appreciate Paul a bishop from the greatest jesus name organization could have tried to open up the seventh seal he would live full he didn't have the quickening power behind to reveal it but once the quickly power will come it makes alive the word in your heart the whole word in your heart you got it now amen all right Aaron performed His redemptive work in secret away from prying eyes the work went on is going on now in secret amen Disha condition the Shekinah glory come down inside the redemptive work in in avail was hid from all but revealed to the seals of to deceive of God all right now we find in friends that the spirit in the folds of his word is doing this hidden work in our secret place the heart amen doing around there in the heart how by revealing his will to us and then this makes us about our father's business amen okay then the word Jesus is in our temples Tabernacle discussing declaring band reckon with all who cares the missing amen did you get that she's an odd type in our temple now in Mary's time he was in that temple a man sitting there discussing God's Word he's now in Union inside of you payment so we find friends that he assumed to be made benefits we find that by the spell or the head still will come forth with shoutings crying grace grace it's coming forth why for this hidden work that God is doing now will bring forth the headstone to cap it all amen are you understanding now what God has done can you save me hey all right then we are now growing in wisdom and stature unto a perfect man until we are fully ripened until we already prepared vessel for the father's use and then he'll use you for whatever he has deemed necessary to be done whatever needs to be fulfilled he'll do it but once we have grown in wisdom and in stature with God all right then if we understand this let's be about our father's business amen to show the denominations that they are wrong and how you show them you deny what's in there and follow the word and leave the camps amen and go after the Word of God that they are on it's man-made okay friends we find there that this enclosing the world like Jesus has come of age the seed is pulling away from the shuck amen while we are pulling away we are growing in wisdom and in statue right now so if you want to know what is going on what has been what has is this period in here it's a hidden work all the one says amen then in other words you're not looking for anything else you're looking for the hidden work to go on in your heart all right this may if this may help you go into your prayer closet little room Esther as brother Han preached was in her closet in her private room that's what it means closet only one in there was a eunuch dressing her did you get it you follow me now the eunuch dresser nobody's come in there you see there now he put on her clothes well now you are now putting on your clothes you're making yourself ready you putting on your robe of righteousness the wisdom of God and understanding then when the time comes you have already come of age to declare that you about your father's business to all your friends and family but soon he's gonna manifest you out here and then you see it you're in standing them there's a two-fold we're gonna a hidden work now and a manifested work soon in the fullness of God when he moves in the resurrection you'll be made manifest and the others they'll despise it they'll wonder but they won't understand they'll perish but God is doing the work now can you say Amen oh you understand it now and also because you have no fears now you know what God's done for you he's doing it in your secret place in your tabernacle Amen Jesus is found discussing in your Tavener the Word of God he confounds amen because you are pulling away doing this stage pulling away from Mary when Jesus finally pulled away from Mary and his family you stood out there and the spirit of a dove come down on the wings of a snow-white dog amen and the Dove of God led to profit on the wings of a snow-white dog well the Prophet pray for you Eagles let the duck lead you because the eNOS is fierce they're fierce Birds brother you strike those serpents but they got to be led by the Holy Ghost no the old turtle serpents the bits all right there Carla ready to strike the Serpent's they hate the serpents friends today the seed of God in here hates sin we all hate sin we and we praise God when we can see somebody hit that sin and preach that Word of God for God has made you what you are not me not by the hunt but the word has perfecting you right now in the Word of God because you had the words in your heart all the words the word says the word of Jesus Christ stood here himself right here himself he would bless women preachers there he blasts makeup and short dresses and everything else he blasts the bishops the big Pharisees cousin in the long robes he would blast women who continued took snip their hair he'd blast that thing but he's here now the word same Jesus same one but they don't understand it for the work the redemptive work is going on but they have not been bid to it they don't understand it but you do therefore let the Holy sprit breathe over the cut brood up over you mold you and shape you unto a son of God giving you wisdom and understanding that's all it is very simple if we could just simmer down and continue to eat this seven-course meal you got a a few courses left amen praise God is it somebody here this morning perhaps that God has given you understanding and you feel that you've been laying around in sin walling around in these filthy churches for the Word of God says that is Laodicea they're blind wretched poor miserable naked and don't know it is it is that one here this morning that would like to be an eagle that would like to because come of age and follow on to know the word if there's one here you can act because I acknowledge it by letting God come into your heart right now just somebody here well friends we thank God for the word of the Lord Jesus amen you love the Lord do you know what he's doing that then I've only faith looks up to him the lamb of Calvary amen he's all in all he's all that we have it's the lamb of Calvary let's turn to page 66 let's sing it from a horse whoops work in our hearts his hit to the world is hit to the rest they don't know it therefore let us be like lambs going on to the slaughter I feel sorry for people that have come in here in the Holy Spirit has issued forth in a man that he has here for three and a half years and I feel sorry if you ever let me stomp on you or brother hunt before the word was preaches on tapes in the back Dave don't ever let me stumble you brother hunt for this is worried so God purposely choose a certain people to speak a word in a certain age like that's all I can tell you you shouldn't mean no but friends that you set us in 63 and you don't understand the hidden work going on in your heart that if you're the same ol mean spirit that you was back in 63 something's wrong with you Amen I mean I have to tell it to you something's wrong with you you're not allowing the dog to move into your hearts so therefore today open up and let the Dove of God fly into your hearts and lead you like it's never too late it's not too late now because but once he raises up and comes then it's too late he is filthy filthy therefore think on what God has done for us we have no faith in mother father sister brother and cousin but no churches no nothing down here at all our faith looks up to him amen
