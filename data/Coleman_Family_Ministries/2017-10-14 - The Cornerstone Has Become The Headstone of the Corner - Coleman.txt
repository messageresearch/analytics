the lame man took heed give me give me amen they hand it Peter said silver go have a none but such as I have rise up in the name of Jesus Christ notice right after that happened then the Devils moved in the demons come in when the lame man was healed but at that time Peter quoted back from Psalm 118 praise God the The Headstone is the head of the corner there's none other Stone given whereby you shall be saved do he said no other name but he called it the stone there's no other Stone other than a headstone then the Apostolic Church Peter when the signs begin to follow he quickly said the it's the head of the corner he identified so I'm identifying it this morning and then Paul the architect of the seven Church ages took the headstone from their early bride said this is a Cornerstone for the seven Church ages the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was an odd Stone A peculiar Stone and the billers didn't want it then and they don't want it today the stone is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
