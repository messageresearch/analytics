[50:34] and found in the temple those that sold
[50:37] oxen and sheep and dole and doves and
[50:40] the changes of money sitting and when he
[50:42] had made a scourge of small cords he
[50:45] drove them all out of the temple and the
[50:48] sheep and the oxen and poured out the
[50:50] changers money and overthrew the tables
[50:52] and said unto them that sold doves take
[50:55] these things hence make not my father's
[50:58] house a house of merchandise and his
[51:00] disciples remember that it was written
[51:03] the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up

[51:13] Spirit in this little man for the beer
[51:15] and here they were so high in religious
[51:18] and holy well who are you and then the
[51:21] Jews said to him then answer is used and
[51:24] said unto Him what sign show us now unto
[51:27] us seeing that thou doest these things
[51:30] and jesus answered said unto them
[51:32] destroy this temple and in three days I
[51:35] will raise it up unto this temple of the
[51:39] words in three days I will raise it up

[1:13:46] Christ see friends it takes the
[1:13:48] resurrection for the disciples to really
[1:13:51] believe in all that the Prophet had said
[1:13:55] so therefore when he was risen from the
[1:13:57] dead his disciples remembered that he
[1:13:59] had said this unto them and as all he
[1:14:02] did say destroy this temple and I'll
[1:14:06] raise it up he spoke of the temple of
[1:14:08] his body and they believed the scripture
[1:14:11] and the word which Jesus said is really
[1:14:14] a word did you catch that when therefore
[1:14:18] he had risen from the dead his disciples
[1:14:21] remembered that he had said this unto
[1:14:23] them so that after his resurrection they
[1:14:27] believed and trusted in him then they
[1:14:31] believe the word scriptures sing of
[1:14:34] Psalm 16:10 for thou will not leave my
[1:14:37] holding one inhale my soul in Hell
[1:14:40] neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One
[1:14:42] to see corruption they remember
[1:14:44] description and they believed the word
[1:14:48] that he said his words is a reveal word
[1:14:51] was destroyed his temple that was the
[1:14:53] message and st. a Psalm 16:10 was the
[1:14:57] word which was a mystery and he revealed
[1:15:01] that Missy of Psalm 16:10 he unravel the
[1:15:05] mystery said destroy this temple and
[1:15:08] Malikov will reveal the mysteries as I
[1:15:11] will restore the 'litham if the Lord hey
[1:15:14] you are the mystery revealed
[1:15:17] Oh token display do not put your Devils
[1:15:25] in a method that come against it glory
[1:15:30] and they believed the scripture and then
[1:15:32] they believed the reveal word message of
[1:15:35] the Son of Man for this season and the
[1:15:38] attack his message was a true revelation
[1:15:41] of the Old Testament mystery scriptures
