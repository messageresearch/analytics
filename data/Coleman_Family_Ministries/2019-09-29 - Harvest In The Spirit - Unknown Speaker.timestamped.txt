[0:00] let's open a Word of God remember it is
[0:03] that the light of God's countenance is
[0:07] to be seen upon us
[0:08] let us open to the Word of God but is
[0:16] open to Galatians 2:20 I'm a read from
[0:23] Galatians 2:20 from 2nd Corinthians the
[0:27] fourth chapter the 7th through the
[0:30] twelfth verse I'm asking you to pray for
[0:36] me so I'm so weary and my mind's worn
[0:40] out so many things are going on and I
[0:43] changed my job yesterday from a parcel
[0:46] postman to a letter carrier and I spent
[0:50] about 20 years since I stood up and box
[0:52] up mail and also because took it out my
[0:56] legs are kind of wobbly I'm getting old
[0:59] praise the Lord I was really had to just
[1:02] come home yesterday and lay down amen
[1:05] they were throbbing praise the Lord so
[1:09] brother bin knows all about it
[1:11] amen sometimes you can't make that third
[1:14] landing don't obsess but nevertheless so
[1:18] sometimes you think you know I've been
[1:20] thinking Lord is this year that I could
[1:23] maybe a retire some way or something
[1:26] even in my mind I think well maybe I'd
[1:29] break an arm or something and then uh
[1:31] because go out on on conversation or
[1:34] something and then you know get a
[1:37] medical uh because a retirement or
[1:39] something like that you know just so I
[1:41] can serve God more you know but that's
[1:43] never the way you think it is see now I
[1:45] was just trying to I've been figuring
[1:46] out the last two or three years how I
[1:48] could retire because I'm so tired and
[1:50] weary and have more time for the Lord
[1:52] more time to pray and and and read the
[1:55] word and hear the tapes and serve God's
[1:58] people but just to have to go on working
[2:00] you know and so well then I'm thinking
[2:03] that will this be the year this is this
[2:05] is surely the year 1967 68 69 70 71 is
[2:10] the year
[2:11] and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[2:12] moves in about a month ago and this
[2:14] route comes up and tells me to take this
[2:16] first-class route so I'm going from one
[2:18] job to another job praise but that's
[2:21] God's will
[2:22] I'm happy to walk in the will of God but
[2:25] I I thought I liked to route around
[2:27] eighteen up on top of the hill where I'm
[2:31] have about eleven houses now which I
[2:33] have to deliver mail to but in about a
[2:35] month or so it should be cut down to
[2:38] only three houses praise God
[2:41] so up on top of a four George Hill I
[2:43] think it's one of the highest points in
[2:45] Manhattan in the city praise God
[2:47] so we don't understand these things but
[2:49] we just keep walking that's on for maybe
[2:52] I could retire and meanwhile I have to
[2:55] go and deliver mail but it's wonderful
[2:58] to know that in about a month or so
[2:59] after about a month trial you have about
[3:02] a thirty day trial for route I can rest
[3:04] in three houses for the Tonchi but ask
[3:07] me says what are you gonna do with all
[3:09] the time on your hands when you get to
[3:11] know the route I said don't worry
[3:14] praise the Lord I have a whole lot to do
[3:17] with it amen right now it's a struggle
[3:19] you know and I'll just take him type in
[3:22] natural thinking even how the post
[3:25] office department says its inception it
[3:28] was a man on a horse and he was going
[3:30] the wrong way because really going the
[3:32] opposite way on on the in sickness
[3:34] because on the patch and now they
[3:36] changed it last year to Eagle praise God
[3:39] and how the is really the first-class
[3:42] mail that the people wait for and long
[3:45] further to to read those epistles from
[3:49] their loved ones and checks and what not
[3:51] is that first-class letter carrier that
[3:53] the people look for the others because
[3:55] it were in the background the mail men
[3:57] the clerks and the mail handlers of
[3:59] whatnot nobody knows them just that
[4:01] letter carrier praise the Lord he's one
[4:04] see so you understand all these things
[4:06] but God knows what he's doing so you
[4:08] just keep walking
[4:09] praise the Lord so you're playing for me
[4:11] that I'll be able to go through this new
[4:13] a thirty or thirty day trial with the
[4:16] Ralph overcome amen and we'll overcome
[4:20] we know that that third stage which I
[4:23] want to speak about this morning it's a
[4:25] mighty climb uphill on the way on on the
[4:29] highway rather but there's only one door
[4:32] to the highway and that is the door
[4:35] Calvary and we have to stoop way way
[4:38] down to go through that door to get on
[4:41] to the highway Galatians 2:20 praise our
[4:48] God
[4:52] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[4:55] I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[5:01] and the life which I now live in the
[5:04] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[5:07] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[5:11] second Corinthians four the seventh
[5:16] verse but we have this treasure in
[5:20] earthen vessels that the excellency of
[5:24] the power may be of God and not of us we
[5:30] are troubled on every side yet not
[5:32] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[5:35] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[5:40] down but not destroyed always bearing
[5:44] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[5:46] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[5:50] be made manifest in our body for we
[5:53] which live are alway delivered unto
[5:56] death for Jesus sake that the life also
[5:59] of Jesus might be made manifest in our
[6:02] mortal flesh so then death worketh in US
[6:05] but life and you mean a lot of blessing
[6:09] to the reading of his word we like the
[6:14] tightest thought harvest in the spirit
[6:21] excuse me what is the consummation of
[6:30] discipleship in this life what are we
[6:34] looking for what is our goal what are we
[6:38] um endeavoring I don't like to say
[6:40] striving cussed riving sound like you're
[6:42] fighting for something saying and we
[6:45] don't have to fight for this it's freely
[6:47] given just accepted but we're never seen
[6:52] what is the consummation what are we
[6:55] moving out to now as remember that Jesus
[6:58] is our pattern st. John the tenth
[7:01] chapter says this to paraphrase it I am
[7:04] come that they may have life and that
[7:08] they might have it more abundantly other
[7:13] ways that it might be to the full till
[7:16] it overflows I am come that they will
[7:20] keep on receiving it until rivers of
[7:23] living water or actually pouring out of
[7:26] them that is why I am come the son of
[7:30] man came to give us life or ransom for
[7:34] many
[7:36] we know by instinct as Christians that
[7:41] this life is symbolized as the cross and
[7:44] the this principle is embedded is woven
[7:49] in the very nature of God see over in is
[7:55] and is this self giving love is the
[7:59] basic law to give of yourself love and a
[8:04] type of it and the natural is deed Lily
[8:06] it gives up just gives out see and the
[8:10] flowers of course it gives out a
[8:12] fragrance and then it dies you see now
[8:15] and Satan in the beginning or God made
[8:20] all of his beings free moral agents to
[8:24] have their own choice see and Satan
[8:26] because he had the same choice and
[8:29] steady and he wanted self seeking love
[8:33] seeking or the or the admiration and
[8:37] respect and rivers of all the angels to
[8:40] him he want to be like the Most High so
[8:44] he wanted that the graduation and he
[8:47] turned it around and perverted self
[8:49] given to self seeking evil for good self
[8:55] love for selfishness forceful meekness
[8:58] war for peace he just provided see and
[9:03] but Jesus was our example he never lived
[9:09] for himself his life was spent for
[9:11] others
[9:13] see that is perfectly eternal life to
[9:17] live for others see now or when you go
[9:21] to church and you do good things that's
[9:23] wonderful see but when you live your
[9:26] life and do good things to yourself
[9:28] that's not eternal life some people live
[9:32] a life where they don't want nobody
[9:33] outside to touch it they want to come
[9:36] here they'll give their ties and and
[9:37] it'll give an offering to a poor needy
[9:39] person but when they go home they don't
[9:41] one know nothing to come and break up
[9:44] their way of living if they want to go
[9:47] to bed at a certain time they want to go
[9:49] to bed then they want to wash their
[9:51] clothes or cooker so they don't want
[9:53] nothing to interfere with their selfish
[9:56] way of living but that is not the way of
[9:59] a Christian no matter what we do or
[10:02] because what our means and so forth
[10:05] because eternal life is living for
[10:09] others not for yourself see we must live
[10:12] for others and you take Christ's place
[10:17] as sons of God and live for others you
[10:21] live for the person that hates you you
[10:24] live for the person that resents you you
[10:29] live for the person that is jealous of
[10:30] you you live for the person that wants
[10:33] to maim you that's right well I'm
[10:37] getting annoying men just wanna hear
[10:39] Jesus Christ did he died on the cross
[10:43] for murderers for here's for this bag
[10:47] let all that are good for del Turris for
[10:51] wicked says he died for those who hated
[10:53] him is that right praise the Lord
[10:56] see so therefore Jesus did at Calvary he
[11:01] died for those who hated him we
[11:05] sacrifice ourselves to his service to
[11:07] follow him see we don't do this for
[11:11] because we're in the line of duty or
[11:13] because you ought to do it or the thing
[11:16] is right before you and you know what
[11:17] you're supposed to do you don't do it
[11:19] then get a second thought well I should
[11:21] do that because they're after all a
[11:22] Christian would do that I'm in the
[11:25] message and
[11:26] but Arel he's taught that we should do
[11:27] this and we shouldn't do that see well
[11:29] that's not what I'm talking about see
[11:31] what I'm talking about that's when he's
[11:33] selfish you see what I'm talking about
[11:36] is just a normal daily action that's
[11:41] just automatically unconsciously coming
[11:44] out of you see it's like the Sheep just
[11:48] giving wool just a normal thing like he
[11:52] said these a sheep type people would be
[11:54] doing see just like the sheep they were
[11:57] so surprised when did we do that
[12:00] see when did we do it it was a normal
[12:02] thing thing turn him see me now so
[12:07] therefore it was automatically
[12:09] unconsciously see out of love see just
[12:14] his life lived in the people not a
[12:17] second thought see not some great a pity
[12:20] constantly emotion or great ministry see
[12:24] or perils and gifts and signs and
[12:27] wonders no sir it's just that
[12:30] self-sacrifice life that God lives in
[12:34] you automatically doing that which is
[12:38] right just because it is right see just
[12:43] going on don't even think about it the
[12:46] hackers praising are right in there
[12:49] cinema know when you're wet you're on a
[12:52] highway amen God has sent a message and
[12:59] deliverance to cleanse plant through the
[13:05] preaching of the word of God every
[13:08] spirit every every idea that would
[13:12] hinder the saints of God from living
[13:14] normally see the word comes to show
[13:17] these things up and the saints of God by
[13:20] revelation see what they are supplied as
[13:22] opposed to live and then the principles
[13:25] of the Sermon on the Mount can life can
[13:28] for through them praise the Lord
[13:31] you're on the highway only the broken
[13:35] ones in Connecticut ride the spirit
[13:39] broken down completely by the Lord and
[13:42] the most beautiful finger to see a card
[13:45] poker man town look great big strong
[13:48] something of flesh break him down in the
[13:51] spirit break him down in his flesh break
[13:54] him down in his heart break him down
[13:56] into the soul until he's molded and then
[13:59] we saw such a man the prophet of God and
[14:04] I like what the Brotherhood said now
[14:07] sisters don't think that you're gonna
[14:09] find brother branham because for a
[14:11] husband be thankful for what God has
[14:14] given you praise the Lord but
[14:17] nevertheless we is the broken ones you
[14:21] see that enter onto the highway and this
[14:25] Hara we're speaking about about three
[14:27] weeks ago is the way of holiness and off
[14:30] to the side is darkness
[14:32] and Satan stands on the side of the
[14:35] highway with many voices whispering to
[14:38] you as you walk along the highway just
[14:40] trying to pull you off to hide the Kings
[14:43] Highway with a voice a roaring voice it
[14:47] may come through legalism or any kind of
[14:49] thing of the world trying to pull you
[14:51] over to the side and fall down into
[14:53] quicksand but if you do slip off and we
[14:57] have everyday you quickly come back to
[15:01] the Lord
[15:01] and get back up on the highway amen see
[15:06] so the cross is the only entrance to the
[15:10] highway
[15:11] and we must do way down way down low to
[15:14] get on the highway to be broken memes to
[15:19] be not I a stiff neck but Christ liveth
[15:25] in me and we must be broken time after
[15:29] turn will see one say this morning you
[15:32] must be broken this morning
[15:34] what if I say no you must be broken
[15:36] tonight
[15:37] back in Wednesday dr. Sunday morning dr.
[15:40] Sunday night there with their attitude
[15:44] Lord break me Sunday morning break me
[15:47] Sunday night Britney Wednesday night and
[15:49] you see some broken ones who are not
[15:52] afraid to back up from the Word of God I
[15:54] won't be resenting the things you're
[15:56] saying see we must be broken time after
[16:00] time it will be a constant choice before
[16:04] us God brings his pressure to bear you
[16:09] want a scripture first Peter or one six
[16:13] wearing you greatly rejoice though now
[16:16] for season if need be ye are in Hibbing
[16:20] estroux mana for temptations if need be
[16:25] amen well who has the authority need be
[16:29] he has so far or manifold temptation
[16:34] comes if needs be the pressure comes and
[16:38] we appreciate all day long then right we
[16:42] wake up and pressure see where we can
[16:46] let it out in the word Christ only is
[16:51] when the pressure comes there's no way
[16:53] out now
[16:54] and if we get into the word then off the
[16:58] pressure well this is the right thing to
[17:00] do then you feel satisfied
[17:01] otherwise you try to figure it out
[17:03] striving and trying to figure the thing
[17:05] up
[17:06] and you will explode like that same so
[17:09] therefore God brings his pressure to
[17:11] bear on us that we must make the choice
[17:13] ourself if someone hurts us or slights
[17:17] us we immediately have the choice of
[17:21] accepting this slight or hurt C as a

[40:02] got to do that's the great secret of the
[40:05] highway now the grace to go to highway
[40:08] is knowing what to do with sin when sin
[40:11] comes in you see people how are they
[40:13] overcoming like that they know what to
[40:16] do with sin they refuse to let the devil
[40:19] take them to Mount Sinai and they're
[40:22] Tormentum torment you did this hey you
[40:24] said you won't do that you didn't do it

[40:57] the Greeks said we would see Jesus they
[41:00] look for anything up of Jesus we would
[41:02] see Jesus nothing else shall suffice as
[41:06] we would seek Jesus praise our God so
[41:12] the secret is know what to do with sin
[41:14] when sin comes in and it does every
[41:16] moment that they sin comes in don't you
[41:20] think that you're gonna overcome by
[41:22] yourself you will not there's only one
[41:25] way you've seen this year the Holy
[41:26] Spirit been coming down every week on
[41:28] the same thing the secret is always to
[41:31] take that Center Calvary not Mount Sinai
[41:35] get all shook up and everything and so
[41:39] forth and so on
[41:40] if you're trying to do it brother I feel
[41:43] sorry for you
[41:46] no sir it will not work take the secrets
[41:51] that takes in to the cross and see there
[41:55] is sinfulness and put it under the blood
[41:57] go to God go to the cross the word and
[42:00] the lancet that's in my daughter that's
[42:03] in my son oh thank you lord
[42:06] he said we'll put under the blood
[42:09] confess your sin and believe in your
[42:11] heart don't take it to become Mount
[42:16] Sinai
[42:17] you will be condemned all day long and
[42:20] when job's friends get a hold of you I
[42:22] feel sorry for you they'll tear you up
[42:26] jokes friends you don't tell the phone
[42:27] everything else see amen praise God the
[42:34] only thing that comes between us and one
[42:37] another such as resentment Envy
[42:41] impatient the patients jealousy the come
[42:45] between you and I that comes between you
[42:48] and God because God sent me
[42:52] see the competition is between you and
[42:55] God love ye one another John Clare lovey
[43:02] one another when he was leaving here
[43:04] little children and right well God is in
[43:08] you now these barriers and they are here
[43:12] or sometimes no more the little veils
[43:16] you can see through a veil can't you
[43:18] alright you can still see a little bit a
[43:22] little blurred but you can see through
[43:23] it but if you don't remove it
[43:25] immediately thus in unbelief whatever is
[43:28] resentment jealousy and so forth its
[43:29] thickens into a blanket you don't get it
[43:35] back there a brick wall comes up see and
[43:38] then you shut off from from fellowship
[43:40] with God and your brother and sister and
[43:43] easy people shut into themselves trying
[43:45] to do it themselves try and do it
[43:47] themselves you gotta let go let God amen
[43:52] now the effect of these sends them to us
[43:54] is to make us walk in darkness cover up
[43:57] and hide what we really are see and what
[44:01] we're really feeling see and that is the
[44:05] meaning of darkness so my warm up to you
[44:07] and know they are jealous or resentful
[44:10] that's darkness but they say praise the
[44:13] law they're hiding impersonating it's
[44:15] not real and brother you know it deep
[44:18] down into their souls and they know what
[44:20] you know it and look at you anyway how I
[44:22] love you they don't in Lyon they know it
[44:27] and they know what you know in Lyon
[44:29] everyone most of all he knows it so
[44:35] darkness hides sin and light like this
[44:40] morning reveals sin now how many are
[44:43] willing to come to the light see
[44:46] otherwise we're just pretending for the
[44:49] past eight years wearing a mask see this
[44:53] is a highway life
[44:56] this life is quite unspectacular no new
[45:00] doctrine people looking for a new

[45:35] is in our nature and they come here in
[45:38] curses brother come up from the

[46:27] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[46:30] the Son of God who gave his life for me
[46:34] himself now we're here in New York with

[49:44] see that amen
[49:46] praise the Lord see always bearing about
[49:50] the dying of the Lord in the body
[49:53] enclosing the principle of the cross
[49:56] friends is in the very nature of God
[49:59] self given love self-sacrificing there
[50:04] was at the cross there was the cross at
[50:06] the dawn of history when the lamb was
[50:08] slain from the foundation of the world
[50:10] when the styie the lamb was slain from
[50:13] the foundation of world there was the
[50:15] cross there was the cross when he who
[50:19] was rich became poor for us that was a
[50:22] cross there was a court at the manger
[50:25] another cross when he left his earthly
[50:28] home he had nowhere to lay his head the
[50:32] foxes have holding the birds have nests
[50:34] son of man hath not where to lay his
[50:36] head that was a cross training hands he
[50:39] administering for cross mount temptation
[50:45] but another cross a point engine does
[50:48] supreme cross the course was when he
[50:49] gave His life because for us was the
[50:53] word of the Cross and the mystery of
[50:55] that way and a secret revealed to the
[50:58] elective ones is both Alpha and Omega of
[51:01] the disciples way Jesus our beginning
[51:04] and our end and there's your secret
[51:07] don't look for anything else other than
[51:09] Jesus see now in closing the word of the
[51:14] Cross has three aspects as sinners
[51:17] number one we see and receive Christ
[51:20] crucified as our substitute another went
[51:24] to the across for
[51:25] to be an effigy for us and he stood in
[51:29] our stead and died for us we might have
[51:32] forgiveness of sins excuse me
[51:35] justification regeneration and cleansing
[51:40] from guilt he took our place that's one
[51:43] aspect of the cross and many have stated
[51:45] right there they never left there they
[51:47] just right there just praising God for
[51:49] that
[51:49] there's a second aspect many of you know
[51:52] that way is clearly out of the
[51:54] scriptures and realized and experience
[51:57] of all who born with God see in st.
[52:01] Matthew 16:24 look I'll read it the
[52:06] reason on this wise
[52:07] 16:24 speaking here to Peter then Peter
[52:14] took him and began to rebuke him saying
[52:16] be it far from the lord this shall not
[52:19] be underneath when Christ had told Peter
[52:21] because he had to suffer the son of may
[52:23] had to suffer the flesh of Peter didn't
[52:25] want no suffering no what are you gonna
[52:28] suffer for when his Messiah was that his
[52:31] king was there and he was the Lord of
[52:33] all and all he had to do was to live
[52:34] right there in Israel and it had
[52:36] everything he wanted
[52:37] and he took my suffering you want no
[52:39] suffering the flesh you see but he
[52:42] turned and said unto Peter get thee
[52:44] behind me Satan
[52:45] thou art an offence unto me for thou
[52:48] savourest not the things that be of God
[52:50] but that but those that be of men then
[52:53] said Jesus unto his disciples If any man
[52:54] will come after me let him deny himself
[52:56] and take up his cross and follow me
[52:59] he said three things here if any man
[53:01] will come after this coming to the cross
[53:04] let him deny himself that's just a speck
[53:07] right here number two deny yourself and
[53:09] then all those who go on with God they
[53:11] have to they realize that they have to
[53:13] deny themselves and this church and
[53:16] people in this message have been denying
[53:18] them sell these past eight years
[53:20] being identified with Christ on the
[53:23] cross now we couldn't be identified a
[53:26] cross with Christ on the cross and an
[53:29] actual overcoming experience back in
[53:31] 1906 because he hadn't said two words
[53:33] yet we could just by faith
[53:36] and because I feel like praying in a
[53:38] having wonderful meetings and so forth
[53:39] and in the gifts and so forth and try to
[53:42] overcome daily but in 1963 he sent the
[53:45] way how to do it a message so then we
[53:49] saw it and I also knowing it and we come
[53:51] to the cross and there we are on the
[53:54] cross this is the second aspect and here
[53:56] we deny ourselves and that's what's
[53:59] going on right now and then the third
[54:02] phase is uh let him take up his cross
[54:05] and follow me now we all talk about
[54:08] ministries and what not will be I come
[54:11] through this here first
[54:13] denying ourselves see so therefore is
[54:17] clearly laid out here it is commonly
[54:20] called our identification with Christ's
[54:22] cross it's the Malachi 4 message the
[54:26] Christian sees that he has come to the
[54:28] cross but is himself not only that it
[54:30] come to the cross but he himself is on
[54:32] the cross see for Christ died in my
[54:35] place then God sees me there in the
[54:38] sight of God I'm on the cross see and
[54:40] pause summed it up by saying I am
[54:43] crucified with Christ that's what he
[54:46] meant see now when to knowledge to the
[54:50] seven seals is added eager appropriation
[54:54] adding to your faith see going on
[54:56] because like now then the dying of the
[54:59] old man
[55:00] see and the rising of the new man in
[55:02] Christ becomes a permanent and with
[55:04] experience like now saying to the soul
[55:08] and it conforms the outside body to
[55:12] Christ way of life and it's so natural
[55:15] and homeless simple and that they don't
[55:18] know what's going on see and this is
[55:21] also called applying the token there's
[55:24] no because term for it is the turning of
[55:26] the wheat from a green to a going brown
[55:29] it's the eagle baby eagle waiting of
[55:33] high up on the cliff as mother feeds him
[55:36] and he waits about five years old and
[55:39] it's time for him to seek a mate and
[55:40] time for him to go off and fly on his
[55:43] own it's all of these things waiting on
[55:45] the Lord but denying himself waiting on
[55:49] God
[55:50] it is simple daily living day-to-day in
[55:55] circumstances precious of God's choosing
[56:00] see or was what is transpired here in
[56:04] New York City it's been God's choosing
[56:07] it's too simple is too humble people
[56:11] don't see nothing going on all right God
[56:13] wanted us to do is to do what you're
[56:14] doing there
[56:16] believe him that's all see now the third
[56:20] aspect of the cross when you pick it up
[56:23] and you fall out to him but he gotta
[56:25] tell you to do it yeah I mean I don't
[56:28] know if anybody outside of William
[56:30] Brennan the prophet stare out seven
[56:36] angels go back to justice bill Indiana
[56:38] all right
[56:39] Becky come and took up this cross and
[56:42] GOST I'll never leave you nor forsake
[56:44] you praise God now this third aspect the
[56:49] third in the final stage and this upward
[56:52] rudder climb to the summit
[56:54] only a few elective ones Christ very
[56:58] brethren take this vigorous ascent up
[57:03] the mountain many fall off weary time Oh
[57:07] speak plain this morning many of tired
[57:11] weary or they're awesome voices call
[57:14] them off of the highway and they fell
[57:16] off into a swamp over there and another
[57:18] glare somewhere and so forth and they
[57:21] don't know what's going on but there are
[57:23] a few chosen ones that's walking the
[57:25] highway they have a secret they know
[57:28] that that that they are Nate by nature
[57:29] they are sinners so therefore they don't
[57:31] get all upset then they know that
[57:33] whatever is flesh is flesh and what a
[57:37] spirit is spirit they know that they
[57:40] cannot make this flesh over can't do it
[57:44] and the others are struggling and trying
[57:47] to make the flesh over I am good you are
[57:50] not good it is the blood of Jesus Christ
[57:53] but the ones with a revelation they
[57:56] recognize is nothing good in me but is
[58:00] the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:02] and they are the overcome by the blood
[58:06] over the elective ones after they have
[58:09] denounced up these past eight years of
[58:11] Seoul try to die out every thought every
[58:14] eye there and let life come into them
[58:17] there's an elected few who already know
[58:20] to say come in God's sight they're
[58:23] ripened they all mature when the little
[58:26] babies come jiggin and Jagan with
[58:28] resentment and anger and jealousy they
[58:30] don't get man pray for the sidestep it
[58:34] and keep moving say praise the Lord it
[58:40] is the way of the Cross listen for
[58:42] others or what we would say were
[58:45] Redemption it is the law of the
[58:48] spiritual harvest I must say sometime
[58:50] will finish all right hip discipline our
[58:52] the first two aspects come into the
[58:55] cross for salvation and going on the
[58:57] cross to partake of Christ's passion for
[59:00] ourselves like we're doing now we are
[59:03] partaking for ourselves the second
[59:06] aspect here see
[59:07] but the third that's when you're
[59:10] completely dead and you were just stay
[59:12] and it's for the others the third is for
[59:17] others see we all know we push in a
[59:21] third pole we in it we all I don't know
[59:23] about what will come forth out of it
[59:25] will be God in flesh we all know that
[59:30] we've been told Adam the tapes
[59:31] everything away that is that's the
[59:33] message supremely it was seen in Jesus
[59:36] Christ for others he went for from his
[59:40] baptism and his anointing to walk this
[59:43] way for others for others he died daily
[59:46] to his loved ones his home his normal
[59:50] enjoyments he died daily for what for
[59:54] others for others he laid down his life
[59:57] for himself no for others and he did
[1:00:01] this to fulfill the law or the spiritual
[1:00:04] harvest now watch it was anuses
[1:00:07] necessity in closer here's why
[1:00:11] airman Eve
[1:00:13] man had died in the Spirit of God then
[1:00:19] right they were mentioned God's image
[1:00:21] and his likeness with the Holy Spirit
[1:00:23] and when they received the because of
[1:00:28] the unbelief come in and they said they
[1:00:30] died in the spirit the holy spirit left
[1:00:32] sing and their natural spirit was they
[1:00:34] of course see and they died in the
[1:00:36] Spirit of God and the kingdom of heaven
[1:00:39] and come alive in the flesh to Satan in
[1:00:44] the kingdom of Hell think on it and they
[1:00:49] were and in type it had to be a
[1:00:52] sacrifice an atonement for them which
[1:00:55] was the Lamb and for us today they had
[1:00:58] to be a savior and a pioneer had to be
[1:01:01] found and that was Jesus Christ he was
[1:01:04] the one the captain of our salvation who
[1:01:07] could and would die listen to the
[1:01:10] kingdom of Hell as fallen man substitute
[1:01:14] and rise again to the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:17] for fallen man see and thus become what
[1:01:22] the seed corn which by his death
[1:01:26] produces that one hundred full of
[1:01:28] life-giving sea just one hundred full of
[1:01:35] life-giving substance not for itself but
[1:01:39] for those who feed on it this is the
[1:01:41] rough part here just don't get it with
[1:01:46] this joy set before him appreciating
[1:01:49] away the joy of the harvest because we
[1:01:52] approaching it now and you got to know
[1:01:53] it the joy of a mother who cha fails not
[1:01:57] for herself for that little bundle of
[1:01:59] life the joy of the bride who travails
[1:02:05] these past eight years worry and trouble
[1:02:07] and persecution of whatnot now for self
[1:02:10] to bring forth Jesus
[1:02:14] that right that Jesus would be the seed
[1:02:17] corn that others will feed on Jesus in
[1:02:19] the Brian not for herself because when
[1:02:24] she met Jesus back in 63 she knew she
[1:02:27] had turned her life hey man she knew it
[1:02:32] see her since was forgiven she knew that
[1:02:35] but that she'd read our that she was a
[1:02:37] body and he was the head so therefore
[1:02:39] she didn't realize that she would have
[1:02:41] to say come this means x millions around
[1:02:44] the world of waiting and hungry right
[1:02:45] now
[1:02:46] well that bride to come forth and she
[1:02:49] will come forth yes sir
[1:02:52] there's only gonna be a few see the joy
[1:02:57] the harvests the motherhood but travails
[1:03:01] the bride likewise for the joy he
[1:03:04] endured across and despised the shame
[1:03:06] that goes with it how many we've had to
[1:03:10] stand here say come over here that is
[1:03:13] okay you don't have it there see it's a
[1:03:15] cross and they don't understand it but
[1:03:17] we endure that despised the shame that
[1:03:19] goes along with it see I don't see no
[1:03:21] shame in it but because some things so
[1:03:23] something we are ridiculous stand up
[1:03:26] here what are you doing you ain't doing
[1:03:27] nothing once you go over here or do this
[1:03:30] here you've got a great ministry and so
[1:03:31] forth and so on see but in his footsteps
[1:03:35] fall out the first member of the church
[1:03:38] that's right
[1:03:39] they sought a fourth touch of Christian
[1:03:41] living to consist of Milly of not giving
[1:03:44] or enjoying his passion but given out to
[1:03:47] others and there went to early church
[1:03:50] members and that was D in the book of
[1:03:53] Acts so then death worketh in US but
[1:03:54] life in others praise God the early
[1:03:58] church Paul Timothy arenas Polly Clark
[1:04:01] Luthor Wesley right down to our time and
[1:04:03] Supreme me again and William Brennan and
[1:04:07] what and all you heard the story when he
[1:04:10] was sent there buddy a campfire and
[1:04:12] Billy Paul Anson that he should pray for
[1:04:15] himself he says Paul it's not for me
[1:04:19] it's for others
[1:04:21] that's the word what he said it's not
[1:04:24] for me he said Jesus is not for me
[1:04:28] Paul says not for me it's for you if we
[1:04:32] could ever get that man in here brother
[1:04:35] you see a power of God he told that to
[1:04:38] him that day at Calvary in closing page
[1:04:42] 19 he's speaking here but the doing the
[1:04:47] greater works now notice the great works
[1:04:49] that that's to have the power in the
[1:04:52] church not only to heal the sick by
[1:04:54] prayer casts out Devils by prayer but to
[1:04:57] impart eternal life to believers there
[1:05:01] is your greater works the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:04] coming and given into the hands of the
[1:05:06] church to impart life
[1:05:08] that's what Calvary meant it took
[1:05:12] stooped degraded men and women and
[1:05:13] lifted them into the place to be sons
[1:05:15] and daughters of God to heal the sick to
[1:05:18] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost to obedient believers man who were
[1:05:24] once unbelievers be may believe was an
[1:05:27] impart spiritual eternal life poor blind
[1:05:32] Richard people how do you missed it
[1:05:34] don't you see what the greater thing is
[1:05:37] that's the greatest thing that could
[1:05:39] ever happen it was to impart eternal
[1:05:42] life to the people what is eternal life
[1:05:45] the life that he lived the life that was
[1:05:48] in him impart that to others can a man
[1:05:50] do that a son of God can know
[1:05:54] do you understand no do you see what has
[1:05:59] been transpiring a local christening for
[1:06:01] nine years giving out the greatest thing
[1:06:05] ever eternal life by the Word of God I
[1:06:10] am come to Malachi 4 that you might have
[1:06:14] let it be now abundantly I open a place
[1:06:20] in New York City I'll give it the
[1:06:21] rubbish to pour life more abundantly
[1:06:25] many will come against it and many would
[1:06:28] have against it they don't know that
[1:06:30] eternal life is being imparted no
[1:06:34] greater thing greater than healing of
[1:06:37] the body greater in size and one day
[1:06:39] greater than all these things is eternal
[1:06:43] life and they sit right in here and
[1:06:45] don't even know what's going on what
[1:06:48] could I tell you this morning praise God
[1:06:52] brother Perez knows all about it you ask
[1:06:54] him you tell you what it is
[1:06:57] the original corner we came back again
[1:07:00] in william branham to die out in the
[1:07:03] prophet's flesh Prophet died out Christ
[1:07:06] was in his flesh and by his death
[1:07:08] william branham spiritual death in the
[1:07:10] flesh he produced one hundredfold a corn
[1:07:13] of wheat and corn wheat was prepared
[1:07:15] every because kernel were was just right
[1:07:18] and in 1966 it was ready cone of wheat
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:24] and then we saw it and then we want to
[1:07:27] go oh my god so we went to the cross to
[1:07:30] deny ourselves sixty five six seven
[1:07:34] eight nine seventy seventy one denying
[1:07:36] ourselves well if you want to follow me
[1:07:38] take up your cross and come after me
[1:07:42] only a few do that the elected ones in
[1:07:46] the beginning the early church they did
[1:07:48] it
[1:07:48] Iranians in Paulo call from Paul and
[1:07:50] Timothy and Barnabas and so forth and
[1:07:52] William Graham down in the last days he
[1:07:54] did it
[1:07:55] but with those God walks with them and
[1:07:59] they're dying they have to receive the
[1:08:02] insults they're resistant the jealousy
[1:08:05] the people the demons coming and so
[1:08:08] forth but they're dying when love
[1:08:11] projects for these people better devil
[1:08:16] grace takes over for brother Perez tell
[1:08:20] you about it won't love Jesus Christ the
[1:08:26] word the message by our spiritual
[1:08:29] revelation you see it in
[1:08:32] to your flesh and the person and people
[1:08:36] come against you all ideas and this
[1:08:38] you're wrong you say you did this wrong
[1:08:40] I'm not wrong and you say yes brother
[1:08:42] you're home with yourself and grace
[1:08:44] takes over for them do you hear what I'm
[1:08:47] saying that's right
[1:08:51] it'll be worse for a millstone to be
[1:08:53] hung on your neck to say anything and
[1:08:54] guess the least of mine to do anything
[1:08:56] because against them but they recognize
[1:08:59] they want to give out eternal life
[1:09:02] so they die to themselves they won't
[1:09:06] fight against you that you might be
[1:09:09] saved so when you come with your
[1:09:12] accusations and your mean sayings and so
[1:09:14] forth the real seat of God will die in
[1:09:18] the flesh and die a spiritual death like
[1:09:22] the early church did Stephen did stood
[1:09:25] there he died his head right you
[1:09:28] stiff-necked and uncircumcised in the
[1:09:30] heart and there the glory of God came
[1:09:33] upon him and they saw that countenance
[1:09:36] of God made bidam
[1:09:37] they were so jealous you wait what I
[1:09:41] happen all over again the Prophet said
[1:09:46] the bride will be repudiated she's even
[1:09:50] feeling the pangs of it has been feeling
[1:09:52] to pass eight years that's right friends
[1:09:59] you don't do these things because
[1:10:02] there's a spirit here in America to go
[1:10:05] out to the islands Trinidad and Africa
[1:10:08] poor little brown and black people they
[1:10:10] feel so wonderful to because give them
[1:10:12] something and for the little black one I
[1:10:14] feel so good when I do something for
[1:10:16] them or little brown ones and yellow
[1:10:17] ones and so forth that ain't nothing but
[1:10:19] a hypocrite do it because Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] is in you
[1:10:26] live in our life not because you feel
[1:10:29] good doing for little black ones and
[1:10:30] yellow ones and so forth do it because
[1:10:32] Christ Jesus Christ is in you you ought
[1:10:38] to hear some of these ministers talking
[1:10:39] when they go down there to turn their
[1:10:40] thinking though people because our fools
[1:10:42] down there
[1:10:43] the brothers come and tell brother
[1:10:44] Hyundai and Jamaica place his legs head
[1:10:47] and he they're going down there all
[1:10:49] puffed up sweaty doing some tell him how
[1:10:51] I supposed to sing and telling what this
[1:10:52] Bulls are doing so forth now the Prophet
[1:10:55] said you got to do this here just for
[1:10:56] your kness way off and the people just
[1:10:59] humbled they don't say nothing see but
[1:11:02] we got a line into him praise God see
[1:11:07] the man that's our spirit in America
[1:11:09] here apps I'm telling you absolutely is
[1:11:12] an unclean spirit at the puffed up a
[1:11:16] selfish spirit that's what it is you
[1:11:18] might as well know what you know what it
[1:11:20] is when you do something don't do it
[1:11:22] some people feel good if they could do
[1:11:24] some fourth day the underprivileged the
[1:11:26] rich may ask what he feels self
[1:11:28] righteous spirit he comes down into
[1:11:29] Harlem in different places once a year
[1:11:32] because he has a banquet or a ball or
[1:11:34] something like that and give the a
[1:11:35] proceeds and so forth he feels wonderful
[1:11:38] it feels washed and cleansed I did
[1:11:40] something for the poor needy
[1:11:41] underprivileged or Christian doesn't
[1:11:46] because he's got a Christ in him no
[1:11:48] matter what they look like who they are
[1:11:51] that's right
[1:11:53] lovely lovely that's right
[1:11:56] the crippled all messed up ones love
[1:11:58] them how many of them want to go to them
[1:12:02] see the greater works important the
[1:12:07] eternal life and then through the
[1:12:10] preaching of the word hearing of the
[1:12:12] tapes and so forth then the Christian
[1:12:14] man or woman himself dining out to their
[1:12:17] own desires dying out to their own over
[1:12:20] lust over desires see and this dying out
[1:12:25] that the others might see Jesus Christ
[1:12:30] it's very humble many have come and
[1:12:33] testified that they see of what a life
[1:12:36] so all it supposed to be
[1:12:39] that is too humble that is too simple
[1:12:42] our life walked the earth in the first
[1:12:45] Jesus and they saw it but they wouldn't
[1:12:47] join to it nothing same thing today the
[1:12:54] preaching on the word is so humble and
[1:12:55] simple just daily living circumstances
[1:12:58] happening they could believe God and
[1:13:00] whatever it is because God heal your
[1:13:02] whatever is it that this simple
[1:13:04] ain't nobody getting any glory out of
[1:13:05] there well great ministries and so forth
[1:13:09] see unspectacular no great emotional
[1:13:13] experiences brother : and brother hon
[1:13:16] heaven out a great meeting and everybody
[1:13:18] is coming up in the angel Lord is flying
[1:13:20] down through here and so forth
[1:13:21] come on up brother send out telegrams
[1:13:23] and so forth spectacular no rebuking
[1:13:27] correction instruction in the waves of
[1:13:29] righteousness that and casting out
[1:13:32] Devils every time the word is preached
[1:13:34] spirits up on people that the principle
[1:13:37] the kingdom of God might flow and now
[1:13:39] the others come and they feel our life
[1:13:41] something strange
[1:13:42] the women that's just as look right hmm
[1:13:44] brothers look right some life that's all
[1:13:47] it is
[1:13:49] but how didn't you don't have to just
[1:13:52] live a life their soul just plain
[1:13:54] everyday living day-to-day that's all it
[1:13:56] is just doing right being current as
[1:13:59] your heavenly father this connie gives a
[1:14:02] son to the good and evil reign to the
[1:14:05] just and the unjust all right raise a
[1:14:08] lot and you'd be good to them outside
[1:14:10] also as your father see now praise God
[1:14:14] we're gonna close out denying ourselves
[1:14:16] to have one one thing else here to say
[1:14:18] now dying out to these normal advantages
[1:14:23] in the flesh comforts loved ones
[1:14:25] material because advantages in large
[1:14:28] income and pleasures and Michael easier
[1:14:31] gives me a right to claim and to receive
[1:14:34] the harvest in the spirit what is the
[1:14:37] harvest or the produce or the fruit of
[1:14:39] the Spirit
[1:14:40] there's one fruit of the Spirit that one
[1:14:42] fruit is love peace joy temperate and so
[1:14:45] forth when I down in the flesh
[1:14:48] voluntarily on the cross
[1:14:50] then the law of the spirit as Christ did
[1:14:54] see the seed of corn see then that laws
[1:14:56] the law
[1:14:57] then I've got to risk if I burn the
[1:14:59] flesh then the life of Christ must be in
[1:15:02] my mortal body and then it was not for
[1:15:06] me it's for others hey man I want to get
[1:15:10] all my ministry and Here I am so humble
[1:15:14] and I cast our building all sir it's for
[1:15:16] others
[1:15:17] it'll be so humble and simple is going
[1:15:19] on right now and don't even know it see
[1:15:21] it's the way of the harvest friends do
[1:15:24] you love them
[1:15:26] praise God well when as I was saying one
[1:15:32] time that when we have our trials
[1:15:34] tribulations and so forth
[1:15:36] and they come we can resist it as a
[1:15:40] Gatecrasher as I want to said or welcome
[1:15:43] it as a friend these trials with
[1:15:48] corresponding destructive or
[1:15:49] constructive effect if I don't welcome
[1:15:52] what God sends I will destroy myself and
[1:15:57] frustration and striving and worry and
[1:15:59] everything else but if I reckon it is
[1:16:02] for my construction it is to edify to
[1:16:06] build me up if I welcome this little
[1:16:08] unwelcome gate pressure the one that
[1:16:12] want to come into and change your daily
[1:16:13] living how you have all lined out you go
[1:16:17] out of the house something happens BAM
[1:16:18] your plans will smash the brother way
[1:16:20] the phone rings this happens that
[1:16:22] happens see now by the practice or the
[1:16:25] principle the cross losses trials
[1:16:27] whether unsought or delivery chosen
[1:16:29] become positive weapons of offense
[1:16:31] against the devil so you and it's the
[1:16:35] only thing it's what is now when love
[1:16:37] projects grace takes over and God uses
[1:16:41] people to because a shuckers down you
[1:16:45] understand it well the corner wheat
[1:16:47] friends we all know it's right we see it
[1:16:51] the a chaff is ripe also dry it out
[1:16:55] we either one of the other see and if
[1:17:00] there is a corn of wheat then the corn
[1:17:02] we must fall in the ground of the Word
[1:17:04] of God
[1:17:05] whatever God sins if you are corn wheat
[1:17:08] you'll fall into the ground and what
[1:17:10] will come up out of the ground will be
[1:17:12] for others and we're home a lot of
[1:17:15] salesmen will die because we want to go
[1:17:18] into the third stage as we would say
[1:17:20] just as all one actually well this is a
[1:17:22] time when we've been able by the grace
[1:17:24] of God to see it even and out and see
[1:17:26] what it is up to this time we see
[1:17:28] through a glass darkly but when the
[1:17:30] Prophet come he landed out to us we saw
[1:17:33] it we see it now see and we see what it
[1:17:36] is coming to the cross going on the
[1:17:37] cross and then picking up your cross and
[1:17:39] going out for others or world Redemption
[1:17:42] and I believe that we have come down to
[1:17:44] that point now and that's where we are
[1:17:47] resting now do you believe that friends
[1:17:49] I believe that the times are so terrible
[1:17:52] people sick weary worn out and yet God
[1:17:56] has been great in our midst here he's
[1:17:58] been moving right through here and doing
[1:18:02] signs to me and wonders why brother
[1:18:04] Perez a man had a stroke
[1:18:06] my own father had a stroke and he in a
[1:18:08] profit on the restoration of bride
[1:18:11] Sheree said he was healed thus saith the
[1:18:13] Lord but he has not received it all the
[1:18:15] way yet his unbelief that's right my
[1:18:19] mother knows she's sick this morning
[1:18:20] where he worn out from his unbelief he
[1:18:23] refuses to believe that he's altogether
[1:18:25] heal brother Perez he accepted his and
[1:18:28] the Prophet said that's thus saith the
[1:18:30] Lord for my father but he ain't never
[1:18:33] received it yet never believed it yet
[1:18:36] unbelief will kill you friends I say to
[1:18:39] you in the name of the Lord believe God
[1:18:41] and you shall prosper don't try to
[1:18:45] figure out what is going on here you
[1:18:48] just believe God see you just believe
[1:18:51] them and go on don't try to order your
[1:18:55] life your way many people I'm gonna talk
[1:18:57] to your plane now people come to the
[1:19:00] Lord and then they say well Lord I'm
[1:19:01] gonna do this for you all I'm gonna do
[1:19:03] that for you maybe uh if it's a brother
[1:19:06] he with because you won't have a wife or
[1:19:08] sister she don't want a husband or so
[1:19:10] whatever it is I mean you can't you have
[1:19:12] to ask what is God's will in the matter
[1:19:15] Lord let that will be done for my life
[1:19:17] while we have husband and wives here and
[1:19:20] we have single people and we have
[1:19:22] because young people old people and
[1:19:25] every one of them they are having a
[1:19:27] struggle in the trial so it's not
[1:19:29] because you're single or not because
[1:19:31] you're married see is God but the thing
