[15:01] happen at all but if it becomes a real
[15:04] revelation of God to you like it was the
[15:08] Peter whom the men say I the son of man
[15:12] and a man okay on the court so you know
[15:20] what it is Revelation chapter 4 part 1
[15:23] page 573 after Peters rock confession
[15:27] which we know that his confession he was

[1:19:04] 3:20 now antennas able to do exceedingly
[1:19:06] abundantly above all that we
[1:19:09] ask or even think according to the power
[1:19:11] that worketh in US according to the
[1:19:14] power that's in the church now and now I
[1:19:16] got two questions here I don't wanna get
[1:19:18] to the other one or not but what is
[1:19:19] another Ephesians and also to number two
[1:19:23] what is the seventh seal of redemption
[1:19:26] so I don't then I'll make all that today
[1:19:29] paradox so let's get down to paradox
[1:19:32] amen and 1965 paradox in Phoenix
[1:19:38] Amen now we're going to try to get
[1:19:40] through here and probably just make that
[1:19:42] that's all yeah I'll come back another
[1:19:44] time and it sees the word it's just time
[1:19:47] right here but I got to nail down my
[1:19:50] title here amen what is another features
[1:19:53] okay Malachi 4 explains how the seven
[1:19:57] seals a redemption brings on another
[1:20:00] Ephesians now think of all those sisters
[1:20:06] they say we don't need no ministers we
[1:20:10] got the Prophet in the tapes think of
[1:20:13] all those brothers in this message and
[1:20:16] have cursed ministers we don't need them
[1:20:18] we can sit in play tapes now we're gonna
[1:20:22] find out the very ministers apostles and
[1:20:27] prophets and pass advanced and teachers
[1:20:29] is the Ministry of Jesus Christ I know
[1:20:33] there's a whole lot of false around I
[1:20:35] don't blame I'm a really you know a
[1:20:36] whole lot of guys around here they ain't
[1:20:38] got nothing no more than a ldap to teach
[1:20:41] and they put themselves in order a man
[1:20:44] that came from some baptist or whatever
[1:20:45] they come from came in the message
[1:20:46] there's so much teaching anybody can
[1:20:48] teach amen but where they ordained of
[1:20:50] God to rightly divide the word so praise
[1:20:56] God I know how to feel but I can't help
[1:20:58] that amen and I'm here in New York
[1:21:00] amen praise God so what's going to
[1:21:04] happen brethren when they find out that
[1:21:07] these menaces that's been doing the work
[1:21:08] of an apostle or prophet or something
[1:21:10] the Evangelist of pastored been doing
[1:21:13] that work faithfully then um thunders a
[1:21:16] man then it comes time for an
[1:21:18] inheritance and the land is
[1:21:22] the thunders is devided some apostles
[1:21:25] some prophets some pastors some teachers
[1:21:28] some evangelists some gifts of
[1:21:31] discernment and wisdom and knowledge and
[1:21:33] everything else
[1:21:34] places position Amen power where in any
[1:21:38] Fijians Oh hallelujah and they try to go
[1:21:44] over the ministry oh I don't want to be
[1:21:48] in his shoes when the second example
[1:21:51] seed comes behind the prophet and has
[1:21:55] already added add and add up to the top
[1:21:57] and suddenly the charity caps them
[1:22:02] virtues in him then pillar fires in him
[1:22:06] and he goes out as Jesus Christ in the
[1:22:09] book Ephesians Oh
[1:22:12] every sickest he'll shadow heels of
[1:22:16] people in this message maybe in 1992 and
[1:22:21] all those sisters who backed by spoke
[1:22:24] evil against those ministry oh ah
[1:22:28] they're gonna have to pay for that oh I
[1:22:31] wouldn't want to be in his shoes they
[1:22:34] were speaking against Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] I'll answer yes sir okay we're here
[1:22:42] I'm coming a message oh and then another
[1:22:46] seat another Sun comes up another one
[1:22:48] then a sister comes up adopted praise
[1:22:50] God and all of a sudden they are being
[1:22:53] adopted then people in the message
[1:22:56] received the Prophet but rejected
[1:22:58] everything else thunders and ministers
[1:23:00] everything you know suddenly a minister
[1:23:02] comes by and he preaches you the same
[1:23:04] people and they become eternal laws and
[1:23:08] they write in the message because it
[1:23:10] break one word they drop into hell so
[1:23:16] they don't know what to do in running
[1:23:18] their mouths don't know what the saying
[1:23:21] Amen brother brown did the work of
[1:23:24] evangelist but he was called to be
[1:23:25] Elijah
[1:23:28] this is sure as we're standing here
[1:23:30] there's gonna be some apostles and
[1:23:32] prophets of passive and teachers because
[1:23:34] that's the Ephesians Oh hallelujah pray
[1:23:38] I think is about finished now
[1:23:41] and all these women running up and down
[1:23:43] running their mouths and even speaking

[1:24:29] that joy come on now I'll praise God
[1:24:34] okay let me try it at home maybe see
[1:24:37] that Malachi 4 explains how the seven
[1:24:39] seals of redemption brings on other
[1:24:41] fusions okay here we are
[1:24:43] page eight all right a little teaching
[1:24:46] here I have to do it to nail it down
[1:24:47] glory to God amen paragraph 57 Joshua
[1:24:52] here is a book actually it's a book of
[1:24:55] redemption of the Old Testament Joshua
[1:24:58] we would have to consider it to be that
[1:25:00] the book of redemption because it's
[1:25:03] Redemption has two parts Redemption
[1:25:07] anywhere has two parts that is that's
[1:25:10] that it's out of and in two out of Egypt
[1:25:15] and into the Promised Land out of
[1:25:18] Laodicea and into the thunders
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:26] hallelujah praise God amen
[1:25:29] okay it has to it takes two parts to
[1:25:32] make Redemption
[1:25:34] in Moses representative law which
[1:25:35] brought them out of Egypt and where's
[1:25:37] Joshua represented grace that took them
[1:25:40] into the Promised Land another way was
[1:25:43] the law and grace were two different
[1:25:45] aspects of God's command now the law
[1:25:47] brought them out Moses and Joshua took
[1:25:50] him in amen okay you got it now
[1:25:54] Redemption Joshua here is the book of
[1:25:57] redemption of the Old Testament amen
[1:26:00] Redemption has two parts out of Egypt
[1:26:02] today out of denomination a man Egypt
[1:26:05] doing all of them works down in them
[1:26:07] denomination making bricks down there
[1:26:09] for the bishop huh make all those cakes
[1:26:12] and pies give them to me
[1:26:15] amen
[1:26:17] now do you think I want some cakes and
[1:26:18] pies no see I'm a diabetic
[1:26:20] amen praise God amen see yes siree
[1:26:25] okay out of Egypt into the Promised Land
[1:26:28] out of the layout of seeing denomination
[1:26:30] into the holy spirit of seven seals
[1:26:32] seven thunders it also represents
[1:26:35] something for our day on page nine
[1:26:38] paragraph 59 it also represents some
[1:26:42] foul day now it represents as they were
[1:26:45] in the journey coming from Egypt into a
[1:26:48] promised land so have we come out of the
[1:26:50] world
[1:26:51] Egypt chaos and on our road to the
[1:26:53] promised land and he says here in my
[1:26:55] father's house there are many mansions
[1:26:57] if it wasn't so I would have told you
[1:26:59] st. John 14 coming out of Oh hallelujah
[1:27:04] coming out oh my god praise God
[1:27:08] thank you chooses from outer world of
[1:27:12] Egypt chaos on a road of the promised
[1:27:14] land see so we see that this book of
[1:27:17] Ephesians perfectly parallel the Old
[1:27:20] Testament Joshua the book of Ephesians
[1:27:23] positionally places the church apostles
[1:27:26] and prophets past Vance's teachers no
[1:27:29] other book does that phrase as the only
[1:27:31] one that does head
[1:27:33] praise God in that book and I think the
[1:27:36] third chapter said how the mysteries of
[1:27:38] God is revealed to the holy apostles and
[1:27:41] prophets but miss all the mysteries of
[1:27:43] God for that day praise God it's all in
[1:27:47] Ephesians husband love your wives any
[1:27:50] seasons wives reverence your own
[1:27:54] husbands in Ephesians children obey your
[1:27:57] parents in Ephesians also in Ephesians
[1:28:00] put on a whole armor of God put on a
[1:28:06] whole arm of God praise God to go out
[1:28:08] here and do it and go into a panel any
[1:28:10] fees everything is any seasons and God
[1:28:15] save you feed you for last to let all
[1:28:18] these women in the mess and all these
[1:28:19] brothers say what they want against the
[1:28:21] ministry then God comes down and prays
[1:28:24] gotten adopts some apostles prophets
[1:28:26] passive and teachers then they become
[1:28:29] eternal loss and they was in the mess
[1:28:31] for twenty-five years paying it ties and
[1:28:34] off and everything else visit the
[1:28:37] prophet and everything else
[1:28:40] cut prove that they wasn't they didn't
[1:28:44] have no Word of God in them tuple to
[1:28:46] begin with because the Word of God is
[1:28:48] humble that all puffed up will say
[1:28:50] anything
[1:28:51] hallelujah speak evil against the
[1:28:53] dignitaries hallelujah even an angel
[1:28:56] said the Lord rebuke you
[1:28:58] but these second Timothy spirits a heady
[1:29:01] highminded puffed up praise God evil my
[1:29:05] god incontinent fierce meeting Oh
[1:29:12] hallelujah praise God
[1:29:15] yes sir so we see that this book of
[1:29:18] Ephesians perfectly pair of the Old
[1:29:19] Testament Joshua the book of Ephesians
[1:29:21] position he places the church so he
[1:29:23] featured here lets us like Joshua
[1:29:26] positionally now charge away after cross
[1:29:29] into the land then he was laboring
[1:29:31] fighting in the land and I said
[1:29:33] wondering what does Hebrews for me yeah
[1:29:34] I had to rest the Holy Ghost visit labor
[1:29:37] to enter into the rest I never
[1:29:39] understood it in 1960 until I heard a
[1:29:41] statue of a perfect man that I knew I
[1:29:43] had to labor hurt you know
[1:29:45] in the res I'm already under s Prime
[1:29:47] labored in the rest empty and tutor s
[1:29:49] and the Rio rest is charity pursuit
[1:29:53] knowledge temperance patient laboring
[1:29:54] fighting in the promised land
[1:29:59] any features in Joshua cutting every
[1:30:03] denomination devil cut his head off run
[1:30:06] him out of the caves and everything
[1:30:07] other put my foot on them praise God
[1:30:13] hallelujah chop a kinnor ribbons that
[1:30:17] lion lusting in therefore goal in
[1:30:19] Babylonia garments they kill them and
[1:30:21] stone them may be seen it yes sir Oh
[1:30:27] hallelujah praise God laboring in
[1:30:32] fighting in the land I think is about
[1:30:34] six or seven years according to usher
[1:30:35] but the man who does that number three
[1:30:38] then Joshua divided the land by
[1:30:40] inspiration to give each tribe their
[1:30:42] positions a fitting word for Joshua it
[1:30:45] would be the book of Ephesians of the
[1:30:46] Old Testament now two things here Canaan
[1:30:49] represents the age of the overcomer see
[1:30:52] number one is dividing up the
[1:30:54] inheritance number two is setting in
[1:30:56] order the ones who overcome the
[1:30:59] overcomers
[1:31:00] I'm overcome and I'm overcoming oh now
[1:31:04] what is the land promised to the New
[1:31:07] Testament believer we know what Joshua
[1:31:09] was back there
[1:31:10] but brother Bram said the promise is the
[1:31:12] Holy Spirit Joelle 228 and it shall come
[1:31:16] to pass afterward that I'll pour out my
[1:31:18] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:31:20] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:31:22] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[1:31:24] see visions this your land of the
[1:31:27] promise praise God is still here
[1:31:30] hallelujah is now in the book of
[1:31:32] Ephesians you have received the earnest
[1:31:38] of it
[1:31:38] you didn't have the Holy Ghost but my
[1:31:40] god you're gonna receive your full
[1:31:42] inheritance your full sonship the full
[1:31:45] manifestation of sons of God hallelujah
[1:31:48] in ephesians some apostles and prophets
[1:31:51] in past events it teaches the
[1:31:53] inheritance
[1:31:55] Oh hallelujah you may be seated the
[1:32:04] promised land in the natural in Joshua
[1:32:06] but what about today today is the
[1:32:10] promise of the Holy Spirit in the book
[1:32:13] of Ephesians
[1:32:14] because in Ephesians 4 that's why I kept
[1:32:17] reading at 11 through 13 divides the
[1:32:19] inheritance some apostles in prophecy
[1:32:22] after they overcome say do the work of a
[1:32:26] pastor didn't work about of apostle go
[1:32:28] overseas and set the thing in order and
[1:32:30] bring the word don't do to do that work
[1:32:32] Emma always I know who I am I know who
[1:32:43] sent me overseas the prophet of God
[1:32:47] ordained me to go overseas I know what
[1:32:49] I'm talking about
[1:32:50] I let nobody round New York home telling
[1:32:52] me something different or what they
[1:32:54] think I don't care what you think for
[1:32:55] himself hallelujah your thoughts are not
[1:33:01] God's thoughts I hear God's thoughts
[1:33:06] from heaven come to me praise hallelujah
[1:33:09] Lori did you get it x18 after the Holy
[1:33:14] Ghost come upon you you shall receive
[1:33:15] power see the Holy Ghost was the one who
[1:33:19] came down in the upper room on the day
[1:33:20] of Pentecost and set the church in order
[1:33:23] by defining up the Holy Ghost land
[1:33:25] giving each one gifts places position
[1:33:27] and their inheritance come down in the
[1:33:30] upper room Moses led them up to the land
[1:33:33] Jesus led them up to the land but Joshua
[1:33:36] crossed over and defined it the Holy
[1:33:38] Spirit took them over and you find it
[1:33:40] the land praise God hallelujah you leave
[1:33:46] here today you leave with a revelation
[1:33:49] is Ephesians another fission's
[1:33:52] okay hallelujah what is the body of
[1:33:56] Christ when you're born and then
[1:33:59] positionally born into the kingdom of
[1:34:01] God that's what I'm looking for to be
[1:34:03] positionally born then the whole equals
[1:34:06] are set in the church some apostles some
[1:34:07] prophets
[1:34:08] some teachers some parents are some
[1:34:10] evangelists gifts of the Spirit all
[1:34:12] kinds of miracles and signs and wonders
[1:34:14] and what is the inheritance the sonship
[1:34:17] to be a son of God like Malachi reform
[1:34:19] was like the early prime for us like
[1:34:22] Jesus was like Adam wise Oh hallelujah
[1:34:25] praise to get that inheritance back yes
[1:34:27] sir the whole creation is groaning and
[1:34:30] moaning waiting for the manifestation of
[1:34:32] the sons of God when it'll stop sickness
[1:34:35] praise God it'll stop cancer and stop
[1:34:37] all kinds of diseases the plan will see
[1:34:39] the cripples will walk the tear the
[1:34:41] raises up demons will be cast out
[1:34:44] it'll stop please praise God hallelujah
[1:34:47] there's your inheritance hallelujah and
[1:34:50] I don't care what anybody says I'm going
[1:34:52] to have my inheritance
[1:34:53] I've been laboring here for over 28
[1:34:56] years I'm going to have my inheritance
[1:34:59] I'm about an old Lutheran or Baptists or
[1:35:02] whatever or you can stay if you want to
[1:35:04] praise God but I'm going on to the deep
[1:35:06] corn to the teeth hallelujah hang about
[1:35:08] you stay there
[1:35:09] pretty color okay now page 9 amen
[1:35:16] a fitting word page 9 then I got sixteen
[1:35:19] one day Fijians and we find the same
[1:35:21] thing Old Testament I think this book of
[1:35:24] Joshua fits a fitting word for it it
[1:35:27] would be the book of Ephesus a fitting
[1:35:30] word for the book of Joshua would be the
[1:35:32] book of Ephesus and the book of Joshua
[1:35:35] was the book of redemption but they was
[1:35:38] redeemed they went to the promise and
[1:35:40] when you receive the inner spiritual
[1:35:43] redeemed when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:45] you're fully redeemed and then when you
[1:35:48] adopted oh my god you have wrapped in
[1:35:51] grape sprays got you in the kingdom do
[1:35:53] you see it hallelujah
[1:35:59] okay we find us the Old Testament I
[1:36:01] think this book of Joshua fits a fitting
[1:36:04] word for it would be book of Ephesus of
[1:36:07] the Old Testament the book of Ephesians
[1:36:09] of the Old Testament would be a good
[1:36:11] thing to title this book of Joshua
[1:36:14] because it's certainly fitting to this
[1:36:18] why can't you imagine that I don't hit
[1:36:21] on my preaching this maybe it was safe
[1:36:27] for this morning I couldn't get to it
[1:36:30] November 3rd because the Dead had to be
[1:36:32] raised first you go back ahead of tape
[1:36:36] you hear me saying it must be a common
[1:36:38] other seasons I was into it but I had to
[1:36:43] wait for the day so we find Joshua we're
[1:36:45] representing grace or some propitiation
[1:36:48] that it could not exist in the same time
[1:36:50] that the law was in existence amen now
[1:36:53] you got an L both books of redemption
[1:36:56] both of my books of redemption
[1:36:58] Joshua adhesions and it defined both on
[1:37:00] divine inheritance the promised land and
[1:37:02] both of them sets each man in order
[1:37:05] giving them gift places positions
[1:37:07] Ephesians 4 amen hallelujah and then
[1:37:11] when they get their positions and so
[1:37:12] forth then it said put on the whole
[1:37:14] armor of God in fusions 6 praise God to
[1:37:18] go out to this press is coming down my
[1:37:20] god you better have on the whole arm of
[1:37:22] God yes sir this got to be nice features
[1:37:26] also to this journey another Ephesians
[1:37:29] page 10 brother Branham said here and so
[1:37:32] has the church world in its land stage
[1:37:35] has come along it's played as part but
[1:37:38] there's coming a time where it must
[1:37:40] cease it must do it there's got to be an
[1:37:44] Ephesians also of this journey I don't
[1:37:51] have preached about it the message but
[1:37:54] he says it's got to be in Ephesians you
[1:37:57] know why they won't preach because in
[1:37:59] there's ministers in there and they
[1:38:01] don't want no ministers so then anyone
[1:38:04] appreciate it and those those guys who
[1:38:07] are preaching ain't got no life they go
[1:38:11] preach the second Peter one thing got no
[1:38:12] virtues they don't have no life and it's
[1:38:15] certainly not going to preach 2nd Peter
[1:38:16] 1 nor Ephesians
[1:38:21] so they were scared away from it or get
[1:38:25] over there now if they had any fight in
[1:38:28] them had any seed in them they die her
[1:38:30] rep right back this is my over big piece
[1:38:34] of steak

[1:38:55] journey just as it was of other journeys
[1:38:59] there has to be come any thieves and
[1:39:02] Ephesus and Ephesians of this journey
[1:39:07] the striving is down into you now
[1:39:11] hallelujah we want to have a seventh on
[1:39:14] the revival another Ephesians is here
[1:39:18] for seven thundery vital the revival
[1:39:24] will come from Ephesians because
[1:39:28] Ephesians is the seven seals word is
[1:39:35] Jesus Shasha Jehovah Savior that took
[1:39:39] them from their wilderness into the
[1:39:41] promised land
[1:39:43] do you see a church Joshua means Jesus
[1:39:47] Jehovah Savior that took him out of the
[1:39:49] will disinter the promised land and then
[1:39:50] divide the inheritance and today
[1:39:52] Ephesians is the Holy Spirit in the fire
[1:39:55] for ministries brother Ram told him to
[1:39:57] pour the seven virtues into that Brian
[1:39:59] to the perfection of the coming of the
[1:40:01] Son of God to be all come in the unity
[1:40:03] of the faith
[1:40:03] amen one faith one Lord one baptism of
[1:40:06] the knowledge of son of God unto a
[1:40:08] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:40:11] stature of the fullness of Christ in
[1:40:14] Ephesians and that was my prayer that I
[1:40:17] prayed Oh hallelujah glory to God before
[1:40:22] the debt for the dead was even raised I
[1:40:23] prayed that prayer yes sir
[1:40:26] glory to God amen and it's here I know
[1:40:30] it's there
[1:40:31] lugia power guy went down and touched
[1:40:34] brother hiss pop goddess here if now
[1:40:37] pants believe hallelujah glory to God
[1:40:40] may be seated
[1:40:42] Joshua raise up for the exodus now page
[1:40:46] 12 I'm a close I'd leave the next
[1:40:48] question for the next time cuz I know
[1:40:50] I'll be here two hours more amen page 12
[1:40:54] okay let's nail down what my subject was
[1:40:56] here I get my subject in here then I'm
[1:40:59] alright and the subject is the seven
[1:41:01] seals of redemption is that Ephesians
[1:41:05] made manifest I'm gonna try this down
[1:41:08] here we're gonna finish Amen would go we
[1:41:11] ran out of time for today but there'll
[1:41:14] be another day when we shall continue
[1:41:17] and we in a revival Amen okay now page
[1:41:31] 12 and then Joshua raised up for the
[1:41:35] Exodus amen
[1:41:37] now we taught that's why I read in
[1:41:40] Revelation the sixth chapter and reason
[1:41:44] I did that because in Revelation 6 gives
[1:41:46] us the 6 written seals that correct then
[1:41:52] it breaks in with revelation 7 I believe
[1:41:54] and in Revelation 8 start breaking into
[1:41:56] the thunders and so forth I mean the
[1:41:59] trumpets and then it goes in Revelation
[1:42:01] no less then it hits revelation 10 and
[1:42:03] brother Brown thought that he had to
[1:42:05] bring the chumps because he said so then
[1:42:07] God says no less for Moses and Elijah so
[1:42:11] but he did get into the sixth trumpet to
[1:42:13] let us know or where we were at in this
[1:42:17] age and he named the sixth trumpet
[1:42:19] Hitler and Eichmann and staylene he
[1:42:23] named it in the 1938 killed six million
[1:42:26] Jews was the sixth trumpet praise God
[1:42:30] and we could count between 1930
[1:42:33] something and now we between the sixth
[1:42:35] trumpet in the seventh trumpet and at
[1:42:37] the end of the voice of the archangel
[1:42:39] which becomes a voice of the
[1:42:42] resurrection
[1:42:43] I could almost see an angel standing at
[1:42:45] the last of the seven angels message
[1:42:47] crying time no longer praise God and up
[1:42:51] will come Moses and Elijah pup will come
[1:42:54] Elijah
[1:42:55] praise God in all the bride everybody
[1:42:57] else at the last Trump the Trump of God
[1:42:59] the trumpet of God shall sound but right
[1:43:02] now we are still preaching the last
[1:43:03] Commission in the voice of the Archangel
[1:43:06] Oh hallelujah praise God and that's
[1:43:10] stone of powers here
[1:43:11] now let's nail it down here now we're
[1:43:13] taught in revelation 6 chapter I believe
[1:43:16] 6th chapter of the seven seals that
[1:43:19] supposed the book is to be sealed up
[1:43:21] with seven mysteries or seven seals
[1:43:23] revelation 6 and in the last a
[1:43:26] revelation in in the seventh seal
[1:43:29] religion 6 and the last a revelation in
[1:43:33] Revelation we find out that the layout
[1:43:36] of cien last message of the last age and
[1:43:39] during the time of his prophecy that the
[1:43:42] seven seals would be open the seven
[1:43:46] mystery 7 full mysteries that had been
[1:43:51] left off to every Asian had been
[1:43:53] somebody left on the reformer didn't
[1:43:56] have time to take care of it
[1:43:57] and the day is the Luther the only
[1:44:00] justification by faith he was gone they
[1:44:03] made a church after that Wesley he
[1:44:04] preached sanctification and that was it
[1:44:06] and long come to Pentecostals but we're
[1:44:08] promised according to revelation 10 and
[1:44:12] according to Malachi 4 st. Luke's 1730
[1:44:17] amen and so forth that there is got to
[1:44:22] come any fees to this do you say he tied
[1:44:31] it into Ephesians he tired the seals he
[1:44:35] tired the Malachi 4 relation 10 1
[1:44:38] through 7 st. Loup 17:30 into Ephesians
[1:44:43] you tell my church will be in order then
[1:44:45] see Ephesians is not to the local church
[1:44:47] it's the body of Christ other the little
[1:44:51] churches to the local bodies Corinthians
[1:44:53] and all of them so it's not to the
[1:44:55] Corinthians because their little milk
[1:44:56] babies the milk
[1:44:58] you know you wipe it off amen
[1:45:00] see another Hebrew babies they're still
[1:45:03] drinking milk and some friend of ours

[1:47:39] gone hey man you a Baptist woman with
[1:47:44] pants my god yeah amen well anyway
[1:47:49] Malachi for st. Louis 17:30 has got to
[1:47:52] become a feature to this there is
[1:47:54] promise it friends
[1:47:55] there must come in Ephesians that the
[1:47:58] Sevenfold misses of the word of God must
[1:48:01] be unfolded and it's in the Laodicean
[1:48:04] age that this takes place believe we are
[1:48:08] there I believe we are right in the
[1:48:12] shadows of the coming of the Son of God
[1:48:14] and as for Joshua just before the
[1:48:17] Ephesians raised up so did John the
[1:48:20] Baptist raise up before the next
[1:48:23] and we promised another Ephesians is
[1:48:26] predicted here in the scripture
[1:48:28] therefore I think that we're living in
[1:48:30] Ephesians again back to we are promised
[1:48:34] that what was left off doing those seven
[1:48:37] ages did you hear what he said
[1:48:39] Joshua raised up before the first
[1:48:42] Ephesians which was called the book of
[1:48:44] Joshua but that was the Holy Ghost
[1:48:47] promised land in the natural that was
[1:48:49] Jesus Christ do you understand that was
[1:48:53] the word then China pampus became before
[1:48:56] the next Ephesians who was that Jesus
[1:48:58] Christ and he was a son of man he
[1:49:03] revealed all the Misses of the Old
[1:49:05] Testament it's not given to them it's
[1:49:07] given to you to know the mysteries they
[1:49:10] received the Misses as a word of God and
[1:49:12] then took him into the Upper Room
[1:49:15] hallelujah then down come the Ephesians
[1:49:18] in the upper room and define of the
[1:49:20] inheritance that's number two now if in
[1:49:24] the last day of this journey
[1:49:26] this got to come another Ephesians and
[1:49:29] so the Son of man coming self in Malachi
[1:49:33] for revelation 1070 Oh hallelujah praise
[1:49:39] God it's got to come with other visions
[1:49:43] amen remember redemptions in two parts
[1:49:47] out of into the promised land the
[1:49:49] inheritance is defined each man in order
[1:49:52] so did John the Baptist raised up just
[1:49:54] before the next Ephesians Jesus Christ
[1:49:56] to you and we're promised another
[1:49:58] fusions it's predicting the scriptures
[1:50:00] now seven seals redemption okay here we
[1:50:03] are here's my proof it's right here
[1:50:06] seven seals redemption manifested
[1:50:08] another Ephesians ninety one ninety two
[1:50:11] so therefore he says here at page 13 now
[1:50:15] you cannot add nothing to the book or
[1:50:18] take nothing from it now the book what
[1:50:24] is the book Ephesians
[1:50:27] then you cannot take the ministry out of
[1:50:31] Ephesians which is the book the
[1:50:34] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:50:40] hope it drops in I'll read it again now
[1:50:47] you cannot add nothing to the book or
[1:50:50] take nothing from it
[1:50:52] relish try to eighteen says so now
[1:50:54] revelation revelation is the book of the
[1:50:56] revelation of Jesus Christ that was
[1:50:59] revealed a gentleman seein all those
[1:51:02] symbols and things and so forth and he
[1:51:04] even said revelation eight one
[1:51:06] he says remember that dream I had about
[1:51:08] the little Pentecostal babies and so
[1:51:10] forth you say here it is slides right
[1:51:12] into revelation 8 1 so there was no
[1:51:15] symbol but he had the tenth vision for
[1:51:17] the symbol and he's slitting in there
[1:51:22] huh okay he said himself I hope you
[1:51:27] reading it Amen so then for take one
[1:51:32] word he's part ape from the book of life
[1:51:35] now remember we said that before
[1:51:37] oh this bible become on word huh and you
[1:51:44] are the word I think I was preaching on
[1:51:46] one of the tapes and when Peter stood up
[1:51:48] on the day of Pentecost three thousand
[1:51:51] words three thousand names from the book
[1:51:54] of life heard the message then all in
[1:51:59] the New Testament is the believers from
[1:52:02] seven Church ages is the New Testament
[1:52:04] that's on souls in prison and he even
[1:52:07] called it a New Testament of my blood so
[1:52:12] if you're in the bread you are the New
[1:52:14] Testament he didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:52:18] have to write a Bible but he knew that
[1:52:21] Lutheran Wesley would come and
[1:52:23] intellectual age become they would need
[1:52:25] a Bible but Paul said I didn't need a
[1:52:27] Bible that an arrhenius and Martin that
[1:52:30] they had the Holy Ghost
[1:52:34] there no eating told it don't do that
[1:52:37] don't do this the Norwegian the
[1:52:41] conviction that was inside but when the
[1:52:46] Bible would come out would help people
[1:52:48] didn't wasn't want to have the Holy
[1:52:49] Ghost millions times millions yes so oh
[1:52:53] I better I don't know my god anyway
[1:52:58] don't know his part would take me in the
[1:53:00] book of life now we can't annotate so
[1:53:02] therefore now we know Luther could not
[1:53:04] get to it Wesley so forth reformers
[1:53:06] Fannie Calvin down they couldn't they
[1:53:09] didn't get it at all what they had was
[1:53:11] the gospel truth but now in the last
[1:53:13] days we're given the understanding by
[1:53:18] the word that we're going to understand
[1:53:22] it as for us today
[1:53:23] you are going to understand what I'm
[1:53:25] talking about today tonight we're going
[1:53:31] to understand it why because it'll come
[1:53:34] in Ephesians 2 it that's why you're
[1:53:38] going to understand you're going to see
[1:53:40] some people adopt it you're going to see
[1:53:44] the power of God you're going to see a
[1:53:46] seventh under revival and you're going
[1:53:48] to understand it because what did he
[1:53:51] tell me prove my word and by proving my
[1:53:54] word then they will understand and after
[1:53:58] they understand then they will have
[1:54:00] faith to enter into the prize promises
[1:54:03] that's what he told me September 26
[1:54:06] praise God that you would understand
[1:54:08] nothing till another Ephesians come
[1:54:11] along here
[1:54:11] praise God then you are going to
[1:54:14] understand it hallelujah why because
[1:54:17] it's going to come another Ephesians to
[1:54:20] it and we're here and we're here and we
[1:54:27] are here

[1:54:50] I just got about 10 more minutes
[1:54:51] and we're gonna get to this prayer line
[1:54:52] he said so okay and now can you believe
[1:54:57] it
[1:54:57] already so we're gonna understand it by
[1:55:00] the word secrecy God's gonna loose the
[1:55:03] seven seals seven thunder inspiration
[1:55:05] because it'll come in Ephesians a tune
[1:55:08] we hear
[1:55:09] incredible but true seven seals seven
[1:55:12] thunders becomes another Ephesians now
[1:55:15] amen okay rising of the Sun page 45 he
[1:55:22] is the one who opened those seals he is
[1:55:28] those seals then Jesus Christ who is the
[1:55:33] Ephesians is the seven seals
[1:55:40] he's the word is that in the Bible
[1:55:43] seven seals written here within it
[1:55:45] that's Jesus Christ but the devil made
[1:55:48] it so mysterious
[1:55:49] it was so simple 25 years that's right
[1:55:54] all wound up trying to figure the
[1:55:56] thunders and one brother told me brother
[1:55:58] Joe mm-hmm you know all my dirty nasty
[1:56:01] sins when the thunders come we'll be
[1:56:03] done away with and so will yours I said
[1:56:06] brother all my nest area since done
[1:56:08] awaiting the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:56:13] any man Brotherhood the man called me up
[1:56:16] and told me that 1967 when the thunders
[1:56:20] come so ever you can do what you want to
[1:56:21] do now but when the Sun has come they be
[1:56:23] done away with and he didn't know that
[1:56:26] they had a fight in the thunders for
[1:56:29] each promise who do you say this is you
[1:56:36] got a fight in labor and the Thunder
[1:56:39] promised land because the son of man
[1:56:42] hallelujah the evidence of the new land
[1:56:45] amen the son of man see what he did
[1:56:49] oh let me strike this point just
[1:56:52] freelance a little bit praise God
[1:56:54] I can't keep reading here Amy I'm trying
[1:56:58] to nail down Ephesians okay he is those
[1:57:00] seals did you know that he's seven seals
[1:57:03] and under the Seventh Seal with a gonna
[1:57:06] preach I can't email do it next time is
[1:57:08] seven thunders did you understand that
[1:57:11] he took the thunders from here and put
[1:57:14] it in Revelation 8 on just before the
[1:57:17] trumpets put in the fourth seal to utter
[1:57:23] his voices correct correct Oh amen all
[1:57:30] right he is those seals for the whole
[1:57:33] winter God I'm trying to get a groove
[1:57:36] here somewhere and it's so much to be
[1:57:37] said the whole Word of God is Christ
[1:57:39] there's a quote and Christ is the seals
[1:57:42] that was open what is the opening of
[1:57:46] those seals then revealing Christ's
[1:57:48] unquote so you mean at the seventh seal
[1:57:55] brother bear say here he is the one with
[1:57:58] the swept-back wings here he was he
[1:58:01] brought the seventh seal those other
[1:58:04] seals meant something to me
[1:58:05] but I prayed I went to the mountain I
[1:58:08] did this I did that but oh you don't
[1:58:10] know what does seventh seal means to me
[1:58:12] because brother Brennan knew he had
[1:58:14] prophesied it be seven thunders that's
[1:58:17] going to be put under the Seventh Seal
[1:58:20] and Jesus himself when he preached on
[1:58:25] the seals himself on your sixth seal he
[1:58:27] preached in st. Matthew and brother man
[1:58:29] went down through it correct and he only
[1:58:31] opened six seals he omitted the seventh
[1:58:34] seal then when it came to it over here
[1:58:37] with the Prophet he preached he opened
[1:58:39] six seals then opened the seventh and
[1:58:41] incense they open up to tell you what's
[1:58:42] under there one full of it
[1:58:44] seven thunders banging one two people
[1:58:46] five six seven he said now watch I hang
[1:58:48] on time to get the quotes I'll hit it
[1:58:50] again he said but it is connected to his
[1:58:52] coming
[1:58:55] it's right there I have all the pages
[1:58:57] and everything the seven thunders is
[1:59:00] connected to the Seventh Seal the coming
[1:59:04] of the Lord so going back home be nice
[1:59:07] and so forth and then I had another
[1:59:09] quote and he said here a warning in
[1:59:11] judge in 1963 I'll read that this will
[1:59:14] get me understanding do you love them
[1:59:17] paster dear I think what you will think
[1:59:20] of what we are look how far up the road
[1:59:22] we are friends just look back down the
[1:59:25] road from from way down yonder in the
[1:59:27] days of Luther Wesley and on to the ages
[1:59:29] look here where we are right here at the
[1:59:31] top of the pyramid right here where the
[1:59:34] God has proved it that the Bible through
[1:59:37] the seven seals that's written them
[1:59:39] perfectly been revealed
[1:59:42] now watch waiting only now for them
[1:59:45] seven mysteries right at last on the
[1:59:50] coming of the Lord and the rapture 1963
[1:59:55] after the seven seals was revealed the
[1:59:58] prophecy he was waiting for the seven
[1:59:59] thunders the last mysteries the voices
[2:00:02] on the coming of the Lord what shall we
[2:00:05] do with Jesus called the Christ page 43
[2:00:07] he said the book is open just waiting
[2:00:10] for the seventh seal to be identified to
[2:00:13] the coming of the Lord it's connected
[2:00:17] together then he waited until the shout
[2:00:21] message and then he exposed anything he
[2:00:24] said what it was he said did you get it
[2:00:26] he said the Lord Himself does all three
[2:00:28] as he descends he does the shout voice
[2:00:31] and trunk and the shout is the message
[2:00:33] going forth the bread of God to gather
[2:00:36] the Brian to bring it together but way
[2:00:38] to years before that he said that the
[2:00:40] seven thunders gathers a bride together
[2:00:42] well right at last on the coming of the
[2:00:43] Lord it comes together the thunders
[2:00:48] gathers a bride together at nineteen
[2:00:50] sixty five over here the rapture tape
[2:00:53] therefore he says Malachi fourth message
[2:00:56] is the bread gathering the people
[2:00:58] together and over here it was a mystery
[2:01:00] over here it was known
[2:01:04] and it's the same thing and a prophet
[2:01:07] himself said it himself
[2:01:09] all praise God I don't know I mean you
[2:01:12] got it huh
[2:01:14] you know praise God I don't know but let
[2:01:20] me read this to you here proving this
[2:01:23] word pay 52 or 53 I'm a cut-off do you
[2:01:26] believe we lived in the last days when
[2:01:27] the Son of Man was to be manifested
[2:01:30] there would be all the word that's
[2:01:33] gathered up through Luther Wesley
[2:01:35] Baptist and all that and the Pentecost
[2:01:38] no watch all gathered up to the
[2:01:42] revelation of what it's all been and
[2:01:45] seven thunders on the backside holds the
[2:01:48] revelation of what is all being and the
[2:01:54] third pool is to open the word by the
[2:01:57] seven thunders holding the revelation of
[2:02:00] what is all been my god no wise the
[2:02:08] seventh seal angel rather was to open
[2:02:13] what the sixth seal mystery and that's
[2:02:16] why he opened six because he's saying
[2:02:18] that's all he was supposed to do because
[2:02:19] Jesus open 6 and Jesus himself as one is
[2:02:22] a son of man so he opened six seals and
[2:02:27] let them play around for 25 years and
[2:02:30] reveal every mystery in that Elijah and
[2:02:36] that was the seventh seal Jesus Christ
[2:02:40] Christ seventh seal the age of
[2:02:43] representing with the big swept-back
[2:02:45] wings that's brother Browns message and
[2:02:47] he went through 1963 and went on through
[2:02:51] there then it went across the country
[2:02:53] and then earth the earthquake still
[2:02:57] waiting for the coming of the Lord and

[2:03:16] days
[2:03:17] those seven seals would be broke and all
[2:03:21] and a full thing would come into the
[2:03:23] view of the people was to place all
[2:03:26] along the hour of the seven angels

[2:03:32] be made known in that Elijah in this
[2:03:36] last hour every mystery thunders and all
[2:03:41] Ephesians he made known in Elijah then
[2:03:46] Elijah would speak mysteries as a Word
[2:03:49] of God seven thunders on the earth in a
[2:03:53] message and they would turn it down and
[2:03:57] reject it looking for something else it

[2:09:15] voice of the Archangel Christ is the
[2:09:18] voice of the Archangel all see the voice

[2:10:14] prove that he was that Ephesians made
[2:10:19] manifest gentleman announced it but
[2:10:23] Jesus was that he was the word
