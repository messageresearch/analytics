steal and it was really hard on me than ten days because I was only with my mother raising my three brothers so honey have no body you know and the old always treat you down and when I was about 16 years old my father and my father the law used them to bring me to the United States and that's when I really found a true friend in Jesus and he was the one who made me forget everything I used to do and all the bad things the drugs that lies and I used to be even still you know money from my mother the little money she had to going buy drugs and go hunt around with my friends three four days without even telling her so I was really bad then and when I got here he was my Jesus he was the one who helped me and he was the one who took all those sins away from me he really helped me I thank the Lord for sending a prophet will really help me with his words she was the one who brought me up he told me how to behave how to be lucky Christian he was the wall and the spoken word would he was the one who showed me how to be a Christian how to act and how to behave in church and everywhere else whatever the devil is that and today I just thank the Lord for brother coma he took by the Brenna's message and he preached it to us word by word she really helped me along the way and when I was wrong he rebuked me and he told me that things are brother branham preach and in 1983 God

started like you know he said he wanted to be a preacher that he wouldn't go to church unless he could preach and I said and then he started mocking and saying you know like God and everything and I I told him that on he should never mock God because God could kill him as soon as he walked out our house and when he left that that night one of him and his friend walked over and see a bunch of guys caught him and his friend and they was gonna beat him up but when I seen him walking out I seen him he wasn't going up to his house so I prayed for him near I looked up and I said Oh God watch over

thing I'm going to get every last thing I can get out of them yes sir I mean it glory to God amen I'm going to redeem the time so at this point at this time we're going to go into our slide presentation and what can I say about the slide presentation it's about the life of William Ram Marion Branham and just just a few it's about 40 minutes to presentation and you know if you were to perhaps put it all into words or into a presentation I guess we would be here I guarantee you about two or three months to all the testimonies and different things that happen and transpired in the ministry of our prophet William Mary Branham and I have not personally met brother Branham but I'm so glad that the Lord gave me the opportunity to meet it's family and I appreciate them for my heart I'd be raised it's wonderful name just a wonderful things you know just it's talking to them you know last night in a few the times that we were you would get together and dump cheering the different testimonies of how you know brother branham was and the more I hear that's the more I want to know amen and just so many things just it's mind-blowing so I do appreciate them a we all appreciate their presence here this afternoon and just a slide presentation was presented also in pin Harris of this year and a lot of brothers asked for the video tape of the presentation and I felt for the cone when I talked and we felt not to send it out until the Brandon's see personally themselves so therefore we kind of saved it here to the end after after this will make as many copies as is requested but we just wanted to be a blessing to you and just just a small presentation that we would have we pray that the Lord originally bless them may God bless you title of it is a tribute to the Prophet from the young people let's sing a little chorus do you appreciate the presentation [Music] behold [Music] she's my Shelby [Music] and Jesus is the sweet and he's just you're saying here's four [Music] why

chorus we lift our hands to you it's a Becky we [Music] the [Music] one more time [Music] worthy of our praise [Music] Amen praise this wonderful wonderful name tell you what it's very difficult coming behind him presentation like that you know many of us we go through trials we think we do and to think that all the things that brother Branham had to go through to deliver a message to this generation he made a presentation like that you know makes me want to press on [Music] amen all the trials that perhaps you think you have after something like this you know you don't have any any trials whatsoever he managed just encourages you to be a better Christian encourages you to be more sincere he men and it was said by a brother one time that the Branham spent many many days many months in the field away from his family praying for the sick burdened for the people with children back home perhaps needing little touching their bodies as well but he gave his life amen for a message amen and I appreciate the profit that God has sent to this generation I mean that with all my heart so in mine I mean it amen and spoken-word books and different things that ministry that the brendham families has now trying to get the message out it's amazing what effect those books have on the people a man and I just k-11 little buckles one many times you feel that you have a problem that you don't feel it's answered yet you come across a tape that every answer to every problem is on those books and tapes amen so therefore I certainly do appreciate this presentation very much and appreciate the family being here we have a few token of love that we just like to present to brother David and brother Billy Paul just a little something that you could remember New York City by amen the daemon would you come up here buddy yeah my friend brother David yes sister Michelle would you come off also this is to brother David and sister Michelle words could never express what you mean to

just say god bless you and we certainly appreciate being here and for the invitation just to come and to be with you it's an honor for us to be here and it's it's a vacation and yet it's it's coming home and we feel like we're at home with you and we appreciate that and that we just appreciate the kinship spirit and I have a special place in my heart for the Coleman and the family and as I told him before I was sealed with Holy Ghost in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1985 so praise the Lord we just ask that you continue to pray for us as the workload back home is very very great and just continue to pray for brother Joseph as the burden on him is tremendous I just catch a little bit on my shoulders and I think it breaks my leg so I can't imagine what him and my father go through so just continue to pray for us and god bless you the gift that was given to brother Dave and sister Michelle is a Royal Doulton eight piece china set which was already sent to their home and the rest of the pieces are

this was our special salute to Malachi 4 from our precious precious young people what a blessing what a privilege it is to have been here and I'll salute to them and of course special visitors for the Billy sister Loy's for the David and Michelle and we had this presentation Easter services and and you know all you were there you know what an impact it had on the people and then many many wanted the videotape but brother Bob later says no no no no no he says the Brandon family have to come and see it first before we released his table so it has not gone out a man suggests in their honor and we want it and how we've waited 19 years for brother Billy and the family to come back around again and that's a wonderful number and 19 God comes down amen so I know God is here now in his people a man praise God Genesis 19 God come down first Kings 19 God come down praise God revelation 19 Amen right on down and 1946 to 1965 God come down pray you believe that a man 19 years later it's time for God to be here in the prophets family what a blessing there's no way that we can explain it you know we're all like actually we come from heaven and we don't have anything to do with that first book that's just natural lives and the natural deeds and all the things that God has written down that book but he has another section called the blood section praise God and that section is was God's little orphans in the world and they've all mixed up many colors and races and different denominations and religions and then God didn't he had his orphans there he's I will not leave you comfortless as orphans in the world I'll come down myself in the dark and cloudy day and get you and I'll find a body William Brennan to come down to get you you won't have to worry about doctrines and interpretations and revelations because in my orphans and my children I don't care what color they are where where they are will be a seed will be adjourned blood and when I speak through my prophet that's German blood worry and my orphans they'll catch that and they'll gather and I won't lose one I know where they are amen praise God and I'll gather them together and it may look dark in 1987 looks like is the message is nothing but that's just the way I wanted to look cuz I took my children down to the Red Sea one time it was impossible to go over I said Moses take him to make dawn he purposely told him to take him to McDole where he knew there would be a Red Sea where he knew that favor would have come breathing down their backs and at that time don't cry speak and move forward so praise God I don't care how dark it gets how many clouds all around Amen the Sun is still shining behind them clouds amen and how we appreciate it and know that there is a man that can turn on the light praise God praise God praise God so I thank the Lord to know that we are orphans but he sent a comforter to get us it will be no more often we'll be adopted praise God we're going home amen we have a father amen so praise God the message is such now that that really behooves you to stretch out on faith and really believe and really step on say a Red Sea giveaway amen hang up their unbelief hang up their unbelief we're going over praise God so anyway today after the presentation and there's just no way that I would ask brother Billy to speak now because he uh as you saw he's wrapped up into that and he just has a presence and something with him this afternoon I could sense it sitting next to him he just wants to keep it just that way so we won't burden him and ask him we'll just heels picked us in the morning amen praise God you appreciate them yes sir Amen praise come yes sir amen so you appreciate brother Brian cuts and brother Paul Griffin we put the slide presentation on my my praise song the appreciator appreciate the musicians brother Norman and all that had to do with me and brother Havas silver blade oh the youth pastor amen and all the youth workers praise God I'm just so happy amen they'll have a youth pass a man praise the Lord so we just appreciate everything and I certainly want to appreciate two young men over here Danny I mean Donna Lopes and Jerry Deana god bless you have two brothers and we pray that something has happened they today here to touch your hearts and let you know that God is real praise God and I feel it I know as I see you sitting near your mother's and been praying for you a long time and so have we and when the evening shadows fall you'd be back breathe and you pray from now if many others coming back this is family time that the orphans is all out to him praise God but the comforter is here praise got to get his offense all praise God a man so therefore day you may be in some little debt to drugs and the world and some interpretation or something like that there and this evening the message but very soon the dynamics is here now are ready to just explode and the tomb is going to be empty gone so sister Johanna in the group will you come up and sing Gong praise God so we're gonna be gone one these days now amen brother Paul give us a little chorus here as they get ready praise God you appreciate
