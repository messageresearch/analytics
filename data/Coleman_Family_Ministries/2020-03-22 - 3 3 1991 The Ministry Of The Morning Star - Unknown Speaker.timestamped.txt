[0:07] do it and now I believe they all know
[0:09] what it is
[0:10] and so Lord you blessed the first two
[0:12] amen
[0:14] Lord I'm looking for you to bless the
[0:17] third one now so father in the name of
[0:20] Jesus Christ may the power God go out

[0:45] we all brethren amen we have a common
[0:48] cause in the message to lift the message
[0:51] of praise God and not come against one
[0:53] another but with forgiveness amen drop
[0:57] all arts praise God so that's charity
[1:01] can come down upon us and spread out
[1:03] amen and go out with a power
[1:06] praise God amen
[1:08] and we know it's all tied up in
[1:11] forgiveness in law that we cannot
[1:14] forgive you neither can you forgive us
[1:15] that's what your prophet told us because
[1:17] faith is based on forgiveness so it's
[1:20] totally impossible to go out of here in
[1:22] a rapture without forgiving because the
[1:24] seven thunders gives faith for wrapped
[1:27] in grace so we thank your Lord now may

[4:16] Georgian meetings of 1974 the wave she
[4:21] the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says
[4:23] when you come into 1991 you said many of
[4:27] those people they don't want to even
[4:28] know what the message is so you drop
[4:31] back many me telling you that you should
[4:34] drop back first bring out the harvest in
[4:36] January when the with when the fruit is
[4:39] brought forth the harvest has come I
[4:42] believe January 6 the germ seed from the
[4:46] body of Christ all that means something
[4:49] then drop back and pick these people up
[4:52] and let them know that the that the wave
[4:55] sheath which was malachi force message
[4:59] was waived or revealed over the people
[5:05] it was a message full of promises
[5:10] and I preach promises and that's what
[5:15] I'm all about
[5:17] I'm a preacher of promises so now you
[5:22] understand so you can you don't have to
[5:23] squeeze and pick it out
[5:26] you had to we had to go through 25 years
[5:28] of being tested on the promises and I
[5:33] had to preach the promises for 25 years
[5:38] and then in one day about 12 o'clock
[5:43] praise God that LEM come walking down a
[5:46] dusty road see what I'm saying now
[5:49] so y'all should be released not no more
[5:51] figuring out what is it what is it it's
[5:54] love God and you see his love increasing
[5:58] more and more
[5:59] as we look in the Gulf we see all the
[6:02] confused people and then we see the love
[6:05] of God to us for all these years
[6:07] Oh makes you want to run around and do
[6:12] something praise God so the minister the
[6:15] morning star and my subject is the final
[6:18] voice with final mercy to the final age
[6:22] my inspiration is a call to the
[6:25] resurrection amen come you inquired
[6:29] return call spearing the bride say come
[6:34] well hear him Spokane warrants in 1962
[6:37] malachi for was praying he said wait for
[6:41] the right thing to be done or the right
[6:43] word to be spoken for that great faith
[6:47] that we might dash into the blessings of
[6:50] God now I read this quote years and
[6:52] years ago well what a confidence to find
[6:56] out like cuz Peter said the right word
[6:59] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[7:02] Living God and that Elohim is the flesh
[7:06] and blood has not revealed us to you
[7:07] Peter but your father in heaven so may
[7:11] your father in heaven praise God reveals
[7:14] some to you this morning not flesh and
[7:17] blood brother Coleman but your father in
[7:19] heaven or may the right thing be done or
[7:24] the right act of brotherly kindness I'm
[7:26] sorry forgive me may that chop down the
[7:29] blessings of God praise God reason being
[7:35] the time is short
[7:38] and many need to token and and our
[7:42] families have to come in here some of
[7:44] our families and you remember the
[7:46] inspirations our Lord gave me in
[7:47] November 24th before the work the war
[7:51] started when that Saturday afternoon he
[7:53] said behold I come as a thief go in
[7:57] there November 25th and warn them
[7:59] between revelation 16:12 the sixth vial
[8:03] and the seventh vial I'm coming in
[8:05] between and tell them don't be caught
[8:08] naked and it be a shame of the garment
[8:12] that my prophet has we feel to them
[8:14] praise God the only way they could keep
[8:16] it on is through probably kindness and
[8:18] love otherwise you'd be naked you're
[8:23] gonna be spotted and of somehow
[8:25] compassion
[8:27] praise God so what hours upon his chair
[8:31] she told me to chop back and bring these
[8:33] seed messages back in from 74 which was
[8:37] the first phase of it Amy remember that
[8:40] that climax the ministry from 1964 down
[8:44] in Georgia with these three messages and
[8:46] he said don't say anything about just
[8:48] preaching and then I didn't last the
[8:50] last time some have compassion then I
[8:53] figure you know what I'm gonna do next
[8:55] in the ministry the morning star praise
[8:57] God so what hours upon us church we have
[9:00] just come through 42 days of the Desert
[9:03] Storm can we say Amen now I want you to

[9:12] thing see when you say Amen something I
[9:14] might grab the microphone and anointing
[9:18] strike me because you anointed see
[9:22] intellectual people don't understand
[9:23] that they just hear they keep hearing
[9:26] but somebody that's on fine and in it

[20:07] dried up that the way of the kings of
[20:09] the East might be prepared amen

[21:09] Armageddon I told you that a man to
[21:12] bring to pass his word that the whole
[21:14] world would be focusing on the Middle
[21:17] East to make peace for the Arabs and
[21:20] Jews and bring the past Ezekiel 38 and
[21:23] 39 where Gog and Magog and Russia and
[21:26] all them come down there because then
[21:28] because in in Israel is all this a
[21:31] uranium in the Dead Sea is worth

[29:52] will be the final points to the final
[29:54] age yes sir the church is no longer the

[38:55] Desert Storm away from her
[38:57] that's still the question that is the
[39:01] question
[39:01] amen I believe on of a scene on your
[39:06] dollar bill on a pyramid
[39:07] it is Novus Ordo seclorum it's a closed
[39:12] room and somebody was in the New York
[39:14] Times somebody gave it to me then a
[39:16] precious brother
[39:18] he knew about it and so he won't know
[39:21] more about that so last night he called
[39:24] a Catholic Church and asked the priest
[39:27] what the Latin words Novus Ordo seclorum
[39:30] means I said that's really something
[39:35] yes siree call the priests in the
[39:37] Catholic Church you want to know and
[39:39] then the Catholic priest answered me if
[39:41] I if I if I got these words off of a
[39:45] dollar bill and what and was my and why
[39:50] my curiosity and why I wanted to know
[39:54] then he said that's Bush's new world
[39:58] order the Catholic priest said then he
[40:02] asked me if I knew what the other words
[40:04] meant on top of the pyramid and knew it
[40:07] the cult is something or other he said
[40:10] that means what I have started
[40:13] I will finish so hallelujah praise God
[40:19] my my thank you brother for having the
[40:23] boldness to call that Catholic priests
[40:25] amen praise Allah
[40:28] yes sir so now the oncoming storm amen
[40:35] so hit a profit in 1960 appreciate
[40:38] coming storm line 15 number two and
[40:41] there I thought I'd read it back to you
[40:44] to come back on it today here on page
[40:47] five with where my in here page fire
[40:53] Amen you got at the wrong or page here
[40:58] amen amen I'll find it maybe you open
[41:03] your Bible up to st. mark seven
[41:10] yes sir
[41:18] well you're here this yeah beautifier
[41:22] st. Matthew chapter 7 verse 24 this is
[41:26] the two foundations therefore whosoever
[41:29] here at these sayings of mine and doeth
[41:32] them I would liken him unto a wise man
[41:33] which built his house upon a rock and
[41:36] the rain descended and the floods came
[41:38] and the winds blew and beat upon the
[41:41] house and it fell not for it was founded
[41:44] upon a rock and every one that heareth
[41:47] these sayings of mine and doeth them not
[41:49] shall be likened to a foolish man which
[41:51] built his house upon the sand and
[41:53] arranged descending to the floods came
[41:55] and the winds blew and beat upon the
[41:57] house and fell and great was the fall of
[42:00] it o church we are you standing on a
[42:02] rock
[42:03] praise God or on the sand hallelujah
[42:07] praise God
[42:13] wall-e amen
[42:15] everybody ready okay I just want you to
[42:17] read that one page six here paragraph 41
[42:21] brother Brad explains it Jesus was
[42:23] speaking here of a coming storm which
[42:25] has got to strike every man every woman
[42:27] that's born in the world there is just
[42:31] no way out of it that storm will strike
[42:33] you sometime or other high on the world
[42:36] could wait years later when the Bible
[42:38] was written Jesus spoke these words here
[42:40] how in the world could they pick up
[42:43] Desert Storm
[42:44] I don't know having the Holy Spirit in
[42:48] know how to do these things huh
[42:49] and here he talked about the storm and
[42:52] the prophets prophesy no and why you
[42:54] preach the word the oncoming storm when
[42:58] Jesus speaking of a coming storm which
[43:00] has got to strike every man every woman
[43:01] that's born in the world there's just no
[43:03] way out of it that storm will strike you
[43:05] sometime another and it depends on what
[43:07] kind of a foundation that you have
[43:09] whether your house will weather that or
[43:11] not there has been many lives saved
[43:13] because of preparation to for storms it
[43:17] has been many lives many of lives lost
[43:19] because of failing to take heed to the
[43:22] warning of storms that's coming and he
[43:25] speaks about he wasn't but he was told a
[43:27] story I had that happen in Florida and
[43:30] there had been many great storms that
[43:32] sweep through Florida typhoons and came
[43:34] in off to sea and bring water four city
[43:35] blocks up to the city and by the way
[43:38] they were in California's goes down he
[43:40] says Tampa no place will go under so
[43:44] brother is not gonna hit both sides amen
[43:46] and then he said it'll throw a tidal
[43:48] waves back 40 miles back to the Salton
[43:50] Sea so it's really nothing to play with
[43:53] friends and I believe Billy Graham said
[43:55] that that Santa Angie's fault goes down
[43:57] through Mexico and then it goes under
[43:59] the Gulf in a cross landing ocean and it
[44:01] cuts right across North Africa and it
[44:04] goes right over into Egypt and then
[44:06] hips and straight into Mount Olivet my
[44:09] my my
[44:10] right to Mount Olivet Amen which is near
[44:13] the mosque of Ouma
[44:14] so years ago Liz asked all rabbi on what
[44:18] do you think about the mosque of Omar he
[44:19] says the twelve his beard he said well
[44:22] there could be an earthquake ain't be no
[44:25] more that mosque of Omar each Musa a
[44:28] mosque will be gone well praise God God
[44:33] knows how to do it amen so in sweeps out
[44:39] in such storms in some way the elements
[44:41] they can contact the changing of the
[44:43] weather they got the instruments in the
[44:44] atmosphere which was a way to weathers
[44:47] gather which away this weathers gathered
[44:50] that would bring forth one of those
[44:52] stones because they made it a life study
[44:54] and by certain instruments and things
[44:56] that science has provided them then by
[44:58] calling ahead and hearing which way the
[45:01] storm is coming how much wind has got
[45:03] behind him which way other storms are
[45:06] coming then winds whether it's able to
[45:08] combat to shove away the storm and then
[45:12] he said I could stop and preach for now
[45:14] on that that it takes now here's my
[45:16] thought here and it takes a greater
[45:19] storm that's coming
[45:21] it takes a higher wind to turn that
[45:24] stone
[45:26] now the winds s drive in it
[45:29] amen it takes the higher wind to stop it
[45:35] and you know that there's four angels
[45:37] standing in Revelation 7 hold it back
[45:40] the winds of destruction until the
[45:44] 144,000 sealed then what about the bride
[45:48] [Applause]
[45:50] see I could sealed up also because they
[45:54] could steal open three and a half years
[45:56] but we got good seal here just before Oh
[46:01] Holloway they're not playing time left
[46:03] brother aiming a higher win that's my
[46:06] toy to turn s time and so it is today
[46:09] and we all know that we got on coming
[46:11] strong and only win that I know they can
[46:14] turn that strong will be the Russian win
[46:17] that fell on a day of Pentecost Oh
[46:19] hallelujah praise God glory to God amen
[46:25] brother I can hardly keep still oh I
[46:28] hear the sound upon the rain glory come
[46:33] see how that prophet tied that greater
[46:36] win into the storm and I'm coming back
[46:39] and turn it greater went into the desert
[46:41] storm because the question is how can
[46:43] the bride keep that storm back until
[46:46] she's sealed all the way from faith to
[46:49] charity
[46:50] Oh hallelujah praise God keep all the
[46:53] plagues away and everything else shall
[46:56] not come nigh thee
[46:59] maybe seated Russia Winterfell in their

[48:00] Christian and he heard that the great
[48:02] typhoon was coming that way

[52:44] was successful having Stephen stone and
[52:46] Stephen stood there and said you see
[52:47] heavens opening Jesus standing at the
[52:49] right hand of God something got ahold of
[52:51] him it wasn't a messenger but it was a
[52:53] message he hand hey man
[52:55] while the storm swept through the
[52:57] country it caught the chicken house and
[52:59] the farmer they never found his body
[53:02] and his wife frantically fighting and
[53:06] they lived close to the great Okeechobee
[53:08] lake and the waters began to rise as the
[53:11] typhoon lifted the waters all the way up
[53:13] from the bottom of the lake and that
[53:15] that's what makes them go so dangerous
[53:18] now his wife could have been with the
[53:21] Christian in his shelter but her husband
[53:23] knew more he said no I'm the boss here
[53:25] so she had the SUP in the whole family
[53:28] and it was beginning to rise as a
[53:30] typhoon lifted the walls all the way up
[53:32] from the bottom of Lake that's what
[53:33] makes him so dangerous this shallow the
[53:35] boats wrapped and that's how the waves
[53:37] come up and turn the boats beneath them
[53:39] the storms come and just a world's up
[53:42] the water impacts it for miles and the
[53:44] water was sweeping until the mother no
[53:47] there was no hope but to get her
[53:50] children on top of the building and she
[53:51] got her children and got him on top of
[53:53] the building holding onto the chimney of
[53:55] the house
[53:57] hey man and she could have been into.the
[53:59] in a shelter and then the wildlife the
[54:03] cottonmouth moccasin snakes I believe a
[54:06] more deadly snake in your Diamondback
[54:08] rattler they were crawling for safety
[54:11] and they come on the roof with her and
[54:13] by listening to a husband not taking
[54:15] heed to the warning
[54:17] she she had to she had to fight the
[54:20] snakes she stomped and she beat but she
[54:23] had to stand and watch those vicious
[54:26] snakes bite her children until they died
[54:29] on the roof my god and the mother
[54:32] herself was bitten so much until finally
[54:35] she died and that's the only way we got
[54:37] the story after the storm had quieted
[54:40] and the search party's hunting for
[54:42] bodies and so forth they found her
[54:44] laying on top of the roof with the
[54:45] children laying by her side oh it pays
[54:48] to take warning the first thing to do
[54:52] before they can be a warning there has
[54:53] to be a preparation made for safety and
[54:56] there is no need of sending a warning
[54:59] and the warning is only a voice or one
[55:02] having you to prepare for the danger
[55:05] just of all there has to be a
[55:08] preparation made first and then if the
[55:10] preparation is made then the warning can
[55:13] go forward to cause you to make your
[55:15] decision whether you want to listen to
[55:18] it or not if you don't want to listen to
[55:20] it well that's up to you if you do
[55:22] listen to it there is safety
[55:25] Oh hallelujah God has the same method we
[55:28] work on God's method and that way God in
[55:30] the early days when the ant alluvion
[55:32] world when people had gotten so wicked
[55:34] and so sinful that God could not look
[55:36] upon it and be just amen
[55:40] so friends if in many lives say because
[55:43] of preparation for storms amen
[55:45] if the many lives lost because of
[55:47] failing to take heed to the warning of
[55:49] the storms that's coming and so it is
[55:52] today and we all know that we got our
[55:54] oncoming storm amen can you say Amen and
[55:58] that the only thing I can turn that
[56:00] storm will be the Russian wind that fell
[56:03] on the day of Pentecost all thank God
[56:05] for that promise and there's only one
[56:07] thing I can turn that storm that desert
[56:09] storm of 42 days and that's a more
[56:12] powerful storm that that can be set it
[56:15] and change its course here's a brother

[57:12] the hills get off the mountain and
[57:14] everybody rushed out of there praise God
[57:16] and including the Prophet and down the
[57:18] hill he come but a voice that could turn
[57:22] this tongue spoke to him and say go back

[57:29] forest praise God is here today Oh glory
[57:34] don't cut say go back up everybody was
[57:38] running for their life because the storm
[57:41] was there and a prophet walked into the
[57:43] storm well I mean the same God in him
[57:46] was in Jesus when he spoke to the storm
[57:50] and said peace be still praise God
[57:54] hallelujah my god
[57:56] don't be afraid hallelujah and a prophet
[58:02] of God told that storm to cease a man
[58:07] and all of a sudden stop the clouds
[58:10] we're all the way he said let the Sun
[58:13] come out and shine for days that same
[58:17] God is here
[58:19] don't be weary Oh hallelujah praise God
[58:24] before the darkest hand touches my wife
[58:26] tomber it'll be gone

[58:32] like it was on the day of Pentecost you
[58:34] may be seated
[58:36] praise God a me believe us now this
[58:41] hallelujah so now we know that the storm
[58:43] can be spoke to so the prophet already
[58:46] demonstrated already amen
[58:49] Malachi 4 spoke the word wind ceased
[58:52] Tonka Mountain shine for days just like
[58:54] Jesus didn't in the book and the prophet
[58:56] went on down into a gas station and he
[58:58] asked a man what happened to storm there
[58:59] yeah he said I rushed out of here all of
[59:02] a sudden but then all of a sudden he
[59:04] said it stopped
[59:05] we don't know why and a prophet just
[59:07] smile now he said Oh to the stall
[59:13] suited me now he just said oh yeah he
[59:16] went on it's very humble see God can't
[59:19] give you know polish she has some

[59:28] Satan to my I will ascend up then I'll
[59:32] do this eh I'll do that amen praise God
[59:35] by the grace of God will do it
[59:38] with the help of the Lord and even have
[59:40] peace be still how we thank God for
[59:42] these promises for the spiritual and
[59:44] natural realm in the Florida storm
[59:47] warning the family oh my god it it gone
[59:49] they didn't take heed the storm warning
[59:51] the desert storm is real amen
[59:54] so now in defending was destroyed before
[59:58] they can be a warning there has to be a
[59:59] preparation made for safety or there's
[1:00:01] no need to send a warning there's no
[1:00:04] sense in you saying it's gonna rain
[1:00:05] unless you have a place for people come
[1:00:07] in - there's no sense you're saying
[1:00:11] coming to this message unless you have
[1:00:13] some dynamics to take them direction
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:17] so therefore it's then a man is that
[1:00:21] it's built into the message there's a
[1:00:24] promise in there so therefore before
[1:00:26] there can be a warning it has to be a
[1:00:27] preparation made for safety or there's
[1:00:30] no need to send a warning then if the
[1:00:32] preparation is made then the warning can
[1:00:34] go forward for for you to it's up to you
[1:00:37] to make your decision if you don't want
[1:00:39] to listen to the warning then it's up to
[1:00:41] you if you do want to listen then their
[1:00:42] safety how we thank God for his

[1:01:14] refuge
[1:01:15] like it wasn't days of Noah or on the
[1:01:17] outside of it you have to make your
[1:01:20] decision that safety is Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] that he is the only place the only one
[1:01:25] who has eternal life no man can come to
[1:01:28] the Father but by him he is the Ark of

[1:06:37] coming judgments we have sickness in
[1:06:39] trouble and disaster will strike the
[1:06:41] nation's and every nation will break to
[1:06:43] pieces I read in the Bible that's the
[1:06:46] Prophet 1960 prophesied during his
[1:06:49] second pool before he struck that third
[1:06:51] pole him and but did you notice there he
[1:06:55] said before you go to bed tonight read
[1:06:58] revelations 8 and you read it and you
[1:07:02] see it and they open the Seventh Seal
[1:07:03] There was silence then he immediately
[1:07:05] goes into the trumpets there correct and
[1:07:10] it goes all the way through a revelation
[1:07:11] 8 into the ninth right on through there
[1:07:14] and then at the end of the trumpets then
[1:07:16] it drops in Revelation 10 a prophet see
[1:07:21] it the way the Bible was written the
[1:07:22] Amen see but right there but they loved
[1:07:25] what he did he took the seven thunders
[1:07:27] that was stuck to the back of the Bible
[1:07:29] and knowing that he said read revelation
[1:07:33] eight well then in the eighth in the
[1:07:35] first verse Malachi 4 stuck the thunders
[1:07:39] in Revelation 8 1
[1:07:40] so when he opened it there were seven
[1:07:42] thunders banging one two people five six

[1:27:36] see all of those seeds of Abraham are
[1:27:39] reflected by stars they're different one
[1:27:42] from another and we're different for one
[1:27:44] for another and Jesus is that morning
[1:27:45] star the brightest of all of them but we
[1:27:48] find him in Revelation one with seven
[1:27:51] stars in his hand he interprets that and
[1:27:53] says these seven stars are the seven
[1:27:55] angels to the seven churches are the
[1:27:57] seven churches that's coming then he
[1:28:00] said how could it be then if they got
[1:28:01] the morning star I said the stars that
[1:28:04] were in there in his hand were only the
[1:28:07] reflection stars from the morning star
[1:28:10] see for the messenger of that day had
[1:28:12] the word and he is the word he just had
[1:28:15] the portion for that day and the people
[1:28:17] that's ready now wants to come away from
[1:28:20] the world systems and world things and
[1:28:23] walk with Him sees the reflection of the
[1:28:26] morning star through the messenger of
[1:28:28] that age as he did through Noah and on
[1:28:30] Moses and so forth as he reflected the
[1:28:33] old testament finally they all arrived
[1:28:35] to one and soul world it it is at the
[1:28:38] end of the church age it arrived back to
[1:28:40] Jesus that he is the word
[1:28:43] or a we as Christians are only
[1:28:46] reflecting him the moon only reflects
[1:28:49] the Sun in his absence and the believer
[1:28:52] only reflects the Son of God and the
[1:28:55] absence of the Son of God it's the light
[1:28:57] of the Bible the scriptures being
[1:29:00] vindicated in our lives the word that
[1:29:02] makes them light in darkness you are
