TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we wanted to have you up today for an informal time of Fellowship not going to preach to you we're not going to let anybody preach to you but we wanted to have a time to get together with special friends you know like brother says you got friends and you got special friends we could have invited a lot of people and some we did invite couldn't come but the fact remains that this is a a place that people from around the world come to uh see they come to see the things brother R talks about but yet the facility itself was never really formally dedicated in all these years we never had a a dedication ceremony of any kind and now that we have the other part in the house which we're going to talk about later we wanted to have one time where we could all get together and have prayer and just have some some fellowship and let you see what uh the continuing Ministry of William Bram is right here at what he call Memorial as you know when brother Bram came to Arizona then there was the question about why did you go back and you know he told on tape the Lord told me to go back and in 19 in late 1964 uh the Lord led him to this very property to buy the house and it was a spec home the man had built like two three houses here in the area couldn't sell them the house laid vacant for what was 2 years or one year and so the carpet is started going bad and everything and brother B made him you know an offer best offer that guy ever had and so uh he bought it and for the next 12 months after the purchase which is late 64 he was uh had the people here and brother Jean was part of the crew and there's others uh putting in the driveway putting in the rock wall because when they bought it it was a house and a car for it that was all so they landed on the den and so we wanted to like I say have you up have dedicational prayer and so forth um and then I wanted to ask brother Coleman if he would just say a few words this is the first time he's even been in here and yet he was uh his church was part of the uh they bought the first drapes and now they bought this second set of drapes that went in here and so uh somebody new like that that would have a fresh perspective maybe on what this place means to the believer you know and so we'll we'll have him say a few words and and then have a dedicational prayer and then we'll give you an official tour of the din that's what all the things are because there's things here that relate to each one of us almost so brother if you'll just take a few minutes and speak to us and have a prayer and then we'll go on to the tour [Music] I want to greet you this morning name the Lord Jesus TR redeem this honor a blessing uh to even see the then before and been out here many times what uh the just never was possible to see it and so I said well I just leave in the hands of the Lord and one day I will to see it I am to see it so therefore today is uh there's no way I can equate the blessing of being here and then being asked by brother sister Smith to come even come into den and then even say a few words and to uh say a dedicational prer so therefore I'm not going to brother George said say a few and so I like to um um draw your attention to First Kings nth uh 17th chapter and uh stand read so this is the William Brandon moral uh library and den and this is the D ation prayer of the den and so therefore I like to match attention to First Kings the 17th chapter verse 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarit which belong to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to Zar and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and as she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little o and a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the Cru of World fail until the day that the Lord sended rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the sa of Elijah and she and he in her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the Cru of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Elijah God blessed me of the word you may be seated and we know that in First Kings 171 first verse he said uh there neither be due nor rain but according to my word and so we thank God for the word of God and we feel now that uh in the Widow's house she was ordain of God to sustain uh God's prophet in that time of it was going to be a famine and for the word of God and there will be no water and she had a little room a little chamber upstairs a little D for the prophet to go there and then after she had uh well it's like this it's good to hear the thunder from the mouth of the Prophet thus sayith the Lord and I believe we can all say that for we have been eating from the barrel and it has not uh uh because uh uh gone uh empty and we've been drinking from the Cru and it's not going dry can you say Amen to that amen each one of us in here we all uh have partaken of it the blessings of brother Brown's Ministry and I like to say for myself what it means to me personally uh to be here in the den at this time uh 1965 February during the meetings of marriage and divorce and there was a committee of brothers and they uh spoke to brother Hunt I and said that they were planning to build a den and what we a contribute and so forth we wish you and I saw brother bers that night and at the schoolhouse and gave him a check to work the D and so then uh in the summer of 65 um brother Perry green over here he asked me to um meet him at 10 minutes to 9 he had a 2-hour interview with brother brand so I didn't know anything about it he just said come T night so I was obedient and I went there and uh I walk into the holiday in lobby there was the dining room right there and I see brother Ram sitting there and I see brother Perry facing me I said oh my God this I walked back and I realized well he said 10 minutes to 9 CU brother Ram as you know was very prompt and so he was as later brother Perry told me he says one of our color Brethren just walked up in the hallway so uh and he had his back to me so this was the second time and so anyway brother RAM and per walked out and there brother par brother BR this is Brother Coleman this church they uh want the drapes for den and uh he said oh brother Coleman he said you shouldn't have done that and he reached in he P out a check he said let me write you a check for that so I had his hand I want squeeze his hand on and I said no brother BR I said that's a blessing for us and no no no you can't do that he say uh well brother Coman Jesus said and as much as You' done to the least of my little ones you've done it unto me so I was finished right there and so I said I still felt his hand there I had to bless it amen and so anyway the brother the minister brother that spoke to us and told us he now brother Coleman he said this Den is going to be for the foolish virgins and when we go into Rapture he said they'll be able to come and see all the things about all the e all his hunting trophies and and what what he meant to this generation these effects will be in the den and'll be for the foolish regas so I said well I want to contribute sure but I didn't about the foolish versions but uh I want to be I wanted to contribute to the den so well that wasn't right because we were still here it's 27 years later and so actually to me it was for the bride because the bride has come from around the world to see this T and we are told in church history that David when he couldn't build the house for the Lord because he was a bloody man and but his son Solomon would build a house so then David went on anyway even though he couldn't build it he went on collecting things for the temple and they say by the day standard that he must have collected at least two or three billion dollar worth of things to go into the temple and not to mention with Solomon the gold and everything that he put in there so therefore I say today are greater than solom here amen and therefore the den and what it means inside here in the library there's no way that we can put a price on it because it's Priceless it is the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age it is the end of all things it is Jesus Christ himself that has come down and personally reveal himself the word of God so there's no way I mean you can't put it on the same scale you can't measure it and so I thank God to uh be part of this and to know that these 27 years that um uh the the the meal in the barrel is not going dry and the oil is still gr so we give thanks to God for that and the footstep of the righteous order of the Lord and so um uh brother Joy said well what does it mean to you well Breen uh uh what does it mean to me what can I tell you I mean it means that uh just to be part of the bride and to know that uh God called me one in a million uh out of this uh entire world and a journ and me before the foundation of the world and that jourm was in eternity and came down here and took on the name of Coman and that's should be now in time and I had the privileg to see my name in the Lamb's Book so therefore I was transferred from The Book of Life where all life is at except the certain seed and transferred into the Lamb's Book of Life and therefore I thank God I'm able to go back on uh to heaven and John shouted and wept because there was no man uh to open a book and then Elder said don't be J he says the line has prevailed and old my we turn off to Eternity and see the lamb advancing from eternity and coming a bleeding bloody lamb to take that book from the one that set on the throne and John and them wept and cried because every everybody was in handed but they couldn't come back to the Earth because God held the book to the Earth the title thev to this earth and then when Jesus Took the book and Tow off the seals and sent the Revelation down to the prophet just 19 uh 63 March 17th through 24 talking about shouting and screaming and rejoicing I was there and we all were looking for different things and on the Sunday night the seven seal uh they some they would see Angels flying through the Tabernacle they know what they want to see Sunday night it was all worked up and then what I saw I saw brother R step back and step forward I actually saw the face of an eagle so therefore I know what I saw on the night of the seven seal that's what I saw a screaming eagle amen and he's still screaming am praise God so I deem it a blessing and Rebeca and brother George God bless you for inviting sister com I here and give me the opportunity to say a few words in behalf of what it means to me uh I cannot explain to you what it means to me here but I will be able to tell you on the other side shall We Stand almighty God we deem it a blessing honor and privilege Lord to be amongst the Brethren the sisters here and the family family that uh knew brother Brandon personally and Lord I kind of knew him from a distance and from time to time I had uh little uh uh situations or circumstances that I would make contact and I treasure these memories and now father to be asked to say a dedication prayer here in Den room what is such an honor Lord I Thank you for it Lord so now Heavenly Father as the widow woman there used sustained her until the rain would come to the Earth and even her son that died and Elijah took his her son up into the prophet's chamber and there he stressed himself over him three times and he came to life Lord May uh all the widow woman that lost their denominational husbands and this what we carry in us and L L we thank God for the three poles for we know that that reality that we all are searching in this room we searching for it will come to pass in our lives so almighty God May the rain May the spirit of Elijah be in this room and father may you anoint every uh personal effect of brother Brandon's in the room and then here Lord and may when the people would come in from around the world May the spirit of the Lord come upon them Father Lord God may you anoint this room from top to bottom back to front touch everything in here Lord and may the people be able to walk in here and and and sit down and find peace peace wonderful peace so may a real uh Holy Spirit come down here today Lord and uh uh unite us together here

thee Lord for it was your will and your purpose that it be here not for the foolish virgins but for the Bride of Jesus Christ that come from around the world almighty God special blessing on brother George and sister Rebecca and their family and on over the entire home and all the grounds May the angels stand around Lord in gos so now father may you bless us now Bless The Den here anointed and

part of the services in Jesus name we pray and ask the blessing amen amen praise God lord richly bless you you [Music] seated this time Rebecca and I would like to give you a tour of the Dan before I do that I'd like to say that I believe each of you know each other but you may not know my children cuz some of you saw my name was pretty small they're not small than long this is William right here our baby and Angela standing next to the caribou and Steven standing by the door with this wife the terries we don't know we have no way KN him terries these are the kids will be giving your kids and grandchildren a tour on later ter so we want to just tell you that we're glad you're here today and when brother Ram was building this cuz he was he was the general contractor he was looking over it but like brother Coleman said there was people that was out you know scouting getting things done getting money collected and all it always amazed me there were some brothers that were going to put some real fancy doors on this place and they thought they would surprised brother Brandon of course always wonder how was you surprising you and so they collected money privately for some fancy doors then when he found out what they were doing he said now we can't spend that kind of money on doors we just put up some panel door do being a man of integrity and being money was ear marked he said we'll go ahead with the project but I'll decide what's on the panels and that's why on the outside of the door it saysa which means in Spanish eagle nest he came to me one day and he said how do you say Eagles next so I rattle it off said well I can't understand it write it down so I wrote it down he didn't say where he wanted to put it years later you know those deaths I saw where he wanted to put it so that's why it says n I have to have George's help on the tour because of the fact that usually I'm the one that's in the house and George gives tours to everybody but we probably there's thousands of people every year they go through the den come through sometimes singly sometimes a groups of 40 50 people uh they come from out of town they they come in school buses and everything to come and see the den and we always want to have it available I don't care what time day or night because we've had people in the night that have come through town called us and ask if they could come and see the den and it's our pleasure to always have it available for the people who feel like that it's an honor that the Lord has given us to allow us to have to live here and to make this available to the people and to serve the people um it's almost 30 years ago probably the first time that that I ever saw this house was nearly 30 years ago and Dad and Mom had been out driving around in Tucson they've driven around for months trying to find a house and looking at different parts of Tucson they really like this Northwest area uh but they they looked in other parts of Tucson also and then one day they picked us uh they picked his kids up after school and they drove us up here and they showed us the house and they said what do you think well you know it was just a big empty house we love the swimming pool this is the house this is definitely the house this was the only one that we looked at was the swimming pool and the contractor was here that day his name I believe was olon if I remember correctly and uh we were getting ready to leave and we were standing at the at the front door the whole family was standing there and dad was talking to the contractor they're looking at one another and Joseph who was only well he had only been 9 years old I guess at the time he's playing around the door jam of the door and he starts he's running his finger his little finger running it down the door jam now dad was not looking at him but all of a sudden dad reached out and grabbed his hand right before he got to the lock on the door he never quit talking to the Builder but he reached down in his pocket and he pulled out a little pocket knife and opened it up and he looked and he stuck it back in that door jam and pulled it out and there was a scorpion and Joe's finger was about you know that far from the door J you know and the contrast just kind of it's stuned when you can you know imagine because he knew that Dad had been looking at his at him and he couldn't have seen that scorpion you know back in the back in the door jam and um I don't know to me that has always just made the house right even when I was you know I was 19 years old then it made the house special and I thought you know for something like that to happen this is a special house and sure enough just the next week they went and they bought the house and started working on it and sister Norman she and Mom they worked a long time uh she helped mom uh decorate the house and buy furniture and rugs and things like this but um until mom uh went to be with the Lord in 1981 basically the din room wasn't open that maybe once a year or Mom can get Billy call or somebody else to come and show people through the den but she uh just was not able to take care of of the numbers of people and everything that that you know come through to see the den but since 19881 we've kept the D open for the people Lord we love to keep it on keep it open till it [Music] comes after we're gone fo virgin they gone we're gone they can they can come in here when people come to see the den um usually the first thing they ask is to see Blondie well we do not have Blondie here in the den Blondie is back in Jeffersonville but we're going to go around and I'm going to point out some of the things we do have and George will help me out here uh I'm not real good about guns here so uh about the din yeah most of the stuff that's here came out of the den of jonville which any of you all that that were there and did visit it was a very small room very small room and it was right next to my bedroom as a matter of fact I could lay in the lay in my bed and my door was within this far of my headboard I'd lean out at night and look in there in the din with all of these eyes watching me you know oh just that close but um in let's see summer of 1965 we went to Jeffersonville the din room was BAS Al complete we went to Jeffersonville in 1965 they built crates they crated all the animals crated everything up brought it out here and put it in the den and dad did Place everything in the den where it is now we uh Steven cleans the guns and keeps them nice but we haven't changed the animals around before Dad had it the very last thing that was placed in the den was the Le was the leopard oh boy was the mountain line up here and when dad put that in the den he's got this mountain line in northern Arizona he said that it was a fulfillment of the poem that he had written when he was just a young man I yeah right over here uh called the Arizona line and um that was the last thing that was placed in the den the gun that's on it he was really proud he liked to display the gun on his trophy um and that was 22 okay very small okay grace well again um okay this the lion yes was from northern Arizona most of you have heard named Joe Riley he's older gentleman now lives here in Phoenix he's got a son named Dawson and uh Dawson I think he still has dogs well back then he he was a Traer you know call gu and so he had these very expensive dogs and it's not like the guy that had the the $10,000 cat you know to trade for the 2,000 $55,000 dogs these were $5,000 dogs very expensive dogs so when they went out hunting uh he asked brother brand where's your gun we're going to hun big game well I got here she looks at well he says I know who you are you're the only man I would allow to shoot a lion out of a tree with that gun over top my dogs cuz of course if you miss the dog cat comes down here a good dog so uh he shot him with one shot out 22 magnets of course anybody know hun quite some but he was a one shot Hunter he wasn't like some of those machine guns throw a lot of in that direction go ahead well now that we're up in this area the painting he had down on the wall see there's some paintings that you're going to see in the house we want you to just feel free to make yourself at home here today and go through the whole house in fact on the table there there's a guest book you can see where the people do come from around the world but in the house when he bought it there was a painting in the kitchen some Quail around the stove and so forth and in the bathroom some fish and it was done by an artist here in town named K mik she has big studio and stuff and so he saw that you know he liked that work so he commissioned her to paint this on the wall here which is to resemble P Canyon I'll move out over here which is up at the top of First Avenue and uh he wanted the the water running down he wanted to coming out through here well when she had it penciled in it appeared that the water was running uphill he said no no no like this he takes the pencil like this oh water coming down that she added the color and so in P Canyon is where he was hiking when the Lord told him about marriage and divorce he way up in there and from Tucson was when when the cloud came down it it looked like it was old finger Rock which it was but he was back in behind he didn't go up the front of finger Rock he was back in behind there and so that's basically the story of the of the painting now over on the on the right here you see this some of you that's from City might not know this this is a hornet's nest right here this is the Hornets Nest which was in brother R's backyard remember the story pushed the more in and alerted hornets and they came out and he spoke to them and went back well he got it out in the winter time and got it in the house the Bobcat is from there's on a Bobcat now this alligator this is we call him Al the alligator the little kids coming here he's from Florida now brother brandom and brother Welch Evans was out fishing one day in okoi swamp and brother random says to brother Evans I'd sure like to have an alligator in My Den someday a few minutes later he comes Swimming by so brother of course brother Evans you know with that pressure on his mind he takes the or of the boat and cluns him right between the eyes well the alligator goes out and he's belly up but he starts to drift away so brother Evans being Fearless he gets out and water this deep but who knows what H in there to retrieve the trophy and as he's getting back in the boat well the alligator comes too so they had a little wring match and they got him wired up here he is today but U those of you that remember brother Welch kind of relate to that the uh leopard was a gift from Brother Sydney Jackson uh from South Africa and this right here which is a real Trophy this is the Bear That Never Was a cut if you can explain where he come from go ahead this is the bear the silver St G from R British colum brother just come down the mountain no Bush no Rock no nothing and all of a sudden any was I provid now the furniture that you see up here is Furniture it's solid Maple Furniture the brother Brown purchased when he moved into his new house in Jeffersonville in 1948 and of course when you see the how nice it is that shows how good sister Brown took care of things but the chair for sister for Rebecca is that is theair brother Brown like to study when he lived in jille had wide arms like put his Bible on one side no p on the other and that's how he study and that's was his favorite study chair St oh back um I was about 15 years old we were traveling up in the ATAC mountain and um dead pulled into one of these little souvenir shops and bought a couple pillows and black pillows that were filled with balsom and I remember that Mom got very upset with him because they smelled up the car something horrendous I mean just overpowering he loved that have that in his din um fall yeah it's falling apart to smell of his din make it smell like the the outdoors so when we brought the chairs out we brought the pillows out too we kept one pillow there and one over here but just like that one is it's got big holes in it they're just they' worn out and just uh leaving balom all over everything so finally the one that was on this chair I had to throw it away and this is about just about a year Oro about last December and then a month or so later Sister Pam and sister Deborah came out and we were down to a shop here in Tucson we were walking through the shop and all of a sudden I looked up and here's this pillow identical to the one that i' thrown out and it really hurt me to have to throw it out and I'm looking and here's this pillow and this pillow that we found right here in the shop is is identical to the one that I threw out except for the fact that around the edge where the other one was zigzagged and this one has the The Fringe on it um and you know on tape when Dad talks about the Amber Cloud this is the color this is Amber this is the color that dead called Amber so I really felt like the Lord provided us to keep it in the den room here um cuz it's unusual unusual pillow and a find one like thater these Spears up here always draw attention to a lot people attention these were purchased by the Armstrongs when they were some friends ours that lived over in Borneo they brought him back and gave him to Leo and Jean and then they gave him to brother Brown and we assume these are all animal they may be some white missionar we don't know those are from Borneo southf the uh this is a snow shoe up in the North Country this right here is an elephant T that was carved in Africa brought back this is his moose this old gun was an old Trappers gun brother rown traded for many many years ago uh people ask about the bow and arrow well people gave him those bow and arrows he I think practiced some in the backyard but never really killed anything with them um on the arm of the chair are some notes and as you have time you can glance at them please don't be very old that's some brother sermon notes that we laid out there from fure home from future home there probably made on that very chair William will hold up the little black man there I like to explain that this was a gift from Tommy Osborne in 1959 he brought that back from Kenya it was handcarved over there by one of the natives and brother Ram talks about it on a couple different tapes on one of them he says this man took a vow to his God not to speak he says how many Christians have a similar dedication to your God wa um working our way around here um the two big racks above the couch are elk racks from Colorado he love to hunt Colorado all of you big listeners know and the first two guns on this rack right here are the weather be Magnums he's very proud of this weather be Magnum the next gun up is called the 416 Rigby that takes this type of a bullet which great powerful gun the gun on top is not Blondie although it is blonde that was one of the last guns that was given to him as we're all the guns in here were gifts to him the first gun over here is a Remington 721 that's the same thing as Blondie Blondie was that same color too Blondie was not blonde the reason he call it blond because his wife was dark-headed and this was the other 11 his life the two top guns on that rack um brother brandom actually put that those designs in there himself there's you know kits that you buy you do that little work he was very proud of that uh right behind anel's head is the Carib with 42in horn like I say it is a little crowded but you can have time to Mill around and take your own pictures that's the Caribou next to the Caribou is an anvelope then right in the the corner the big gray one that's a ram and the goat is the one the white one next to it goat and the RAM and the car right behind brother Perry is a deer which is in Colorado and then the two fish are from uh Idaho river no turn that's uh the top one is the one he said that the Walt Disney Studios didn't tax work on it and it held world's record for several months weigh 27 pounds and that's not your ordinary rainbow trout rainbow trout never get that big these are steelhead trout CU they go to the ocean in back they get that size above the door are the uh Havalina pigs which is a wild pig we have a family of live out out side of our backyard and uh those represent you know one per year the brother BR 100 and so back years ago there was a sporting good store here in town most of you heard the name Linda rstat her dad had a sporting goods shop here in town hardware store and so forth and during the season he would have a um uh what you call contest contest and whoever brings in the largest pig during the season uh gets a free hunting rifle so typical Hunter brother R drives up there to we in his Pig the last day of the season and as he drives up he sees an Old Gentleman you know a poor fell sitting on the sidewalk out front with his pig that he'd already weighed in and his old gun and so he um he got out and started talking to him man and come to find out that this was the biggest one so far so brother BR knew what he had in the car was bigger he just left his in the car and he thought well if somebody does come up with the big one I'll get mine out and win the rifle anyway but as it turned out he let the old man win the rifle it's kind of man The Peasant that you see next to the door was from our brother G Norman when they had the meetings in waterl Iowa 1957 I believe the next deer is the one you call Big Jim all those four deer on that wall are from Colorado but the big one there is Big Jim and that's the one he said he hunted for many years up there in the mountains of Colorado of course being a hunter you know how would you know the hunter knows that's the same one year after [Music] year the fire uh well the next deer is holding a gun that's brother Brown's 22 rifle that's the one is is squirrel gun it's just a simple 22 rifle with a four Power Scope which as you uh remember hearing he U had it sided in for 50 yard and over on the on the left wall there kind of in the dark is a red squirrel now it's even kind of hard to see from here but brother random would shoot those little guys at four times the distance of this building in one year he shot 135 squirrel during the season six of them were head shots and 129 were eyeball shots 50 yards he preached just like a shot prise you didn't have to wonder what he meant what was that all about exactly what he's doing the white hat on the on the hat rack there brother's old white hunting hat seen many pictures and let's see what else we got back there the picture that's on the the desk is a picture of brother BR when he first came to Arizona when he was going to be Bron Rider you about the chap and had the proper uniform and everything out there guys are you rer don't and so that's when he was was want to be a br um the little table that sister Muse is leaning on you've all read about the executive desk and magazine well that is the executive desk that's where brother Brown studyed for the last 3 years and give witness to how simple this whole thing is there was a man come from Germany few months ago he took a look at that no room for a computer so that kind of tells how he was um in the gun case you'll see many guns and knives collected from around the world um if you care know which one's which Ste can tell you exactly almost down to the serial numbers um in the middle of the room here we have this large table which is a slice of Redwood from California this was donated by Brother Muse's Church before they ever moved over here and as I understand back then in 1966 it cost $600 the eagle was shot in California now that is a golden eagle when a golden eagle is born Pure White and by the time it's four years old it loses all its white feathers so this one's still a young one there's a $5,000 fine for shooting these guys it's a very protected species but somebody in California shot it the state confiscated it had it fixed up and had it in their office or something and a man we all know very well by the name of Ben Bryan who's traveling over there and he purchased it and he donated and there it goes so he he did do a few things right gave us all heart attacks in the meantime when brother ran was here he had a custom of picking up rocks as he went through the desert and through the mountains and everything little rocks he bring them home put them in his tumler and polish him up Real L and you keep him in this little brown Bowl up here that was given to him by ear Jackson in 1951 and when visitors came he would allow them to reach in and get a little souvenir brother Perry will show you one of those at this time you have yours oh this is one of the rocks that brother Brown had in his old box when brother random left he only had a few left so we put those away they're put away but we continue the tradition we have purchased Arizona rocks that been tumble and every one of you can reach in the bowl and take a souvenir home with you souvenir from most to you it's your visit to the de um the stone wall that's right behind us here has a room for a planter in it there's not enough light in here to grow anything so we we can't ever grow plants but that's the wall that you heard about where brother Brown and brother borders had the discussion and everybody was coming in telling brother bers how to do the job all you got to make it square and so brother said hey no problem in heaven things are on the Square here they're on the round so that's why the wall is round and U uh the floor was it comes from a query up in northern Arizona some brothers brought it down and brother brandom and brother bankswood actually did The Cutting and the setting of The Stone in the floor and I like to point it out because any of you that know about stones you usually know when you're walking across a stone floor but this is perfectly smooth it's almost like it was concrete um and last but not least two deer above the window are from Brother ROM's trip when he took the hunting trip and the honeymon together up in New York State uh we got lost on Hurricane M and brother Paul Griffith who's right there with the video camera is a man that lives near Hurricane Mountain and he sent us for nice pictures we to the magazine of the uh of the area have any questions the name Bill on the horn yes the last deer over there above brother Keith one in the corner brother brand was out hunting with another person one day some other brother I believe anyway they they shot two deer each one shot a deer and the deer was so similar the brother BR scratched his name on Thats Right the zebra skin is courtesy of brother Jackson in South Africa which he gave to brother Perry brother Perry is graciously donated it for our use here for a rug and like I said the the drapes that's fine alwaysed push button um brother brand said himself said I'd like to sit in my office chair and look out at my beloved Catalina mountains and push the button and open the drapes I and if we can do this just this year we were able to actually get the electric the wiring was there all the time remote control you know one thing that I'd like to say is that first the den room as Believers this is not a shrine for us that's why we have things in here like like the zebra we don't feel bad about replacing the soapa replacing the draperies you know the Catholics have their shrines that they worship that for us we have no place for candles this is yeah this is a memorial you know to the ministry and we want to keep it nice um I put uh I called brother Perry and asked him about the zebra put it in here because there was so many trophies that Dad got on his last hunting trip to Africa in 1965 including the big uh uh yeah no it's not bual P Buffalo um that were lost the Airlines lost them on the way back some of those trophies that that we have pictures of him with him and everything just to kind of remind people of that trip whenever we're telling them uh the story of the den we just thought it' be nice to have something like that in here to remind people of events and job their memory a little bit um another thing that I'd like to tell you about the general design of the V room for many many years dad carried in his wallet a little picture that he had torn out of a Hunting magazine that showed the den room of a famous hunter that have this ledge on it where that the the rugs were up there know this is a lot of years before he had uh the Silver Tip Grizzly but in this picture of the den room there was a ledge up here where the animals weren't walked on and everything and he carried that uh and he said someday I'm going to get a nice din room and I want it built like this so when brother borders designed this din room daddy gave him that picture for him to go by so um this was in his spots for a long time also uh we put Dad's hat down here dad's uh old hunting hat and feel free to try it on if you'd like you know it's hanging there so that you can do that um see how your head size fits with profits I I was going to go in because it's it's so smashed and so uh out of shape I was going to take in and have it blocked and steamed and fixed up real nice but then wouldn't look quite authentic so we just left it the way it was and you're free to try it on anytime you like it you have any questions three monkeys yes the three monkeys you've all I no doubt heard on paper brother R says I was down in Miami the other day at the airport and I saw these three little monkeys he says it's a good thing for everybody to have on their desk we found these are a little bigger than dust size but it also jogs people's m what the man said at this time we're going to is there still anything we're going to make our way outside we're going to have our official cutting going into the library and we will have lunch a little bit okay we're going to go out here in the front and leave let me check here ready yes it is it's ready we're going to cut the ribbon and go in the new library and I'm going to ask for the David and sister P if they would cut the ribbon because of the hours they have spent and Brother David we appreciate this so much so you and sister pan together you cut the ribbon and let us all in new library okay the front door on the house was dead design that door um been exposed to the element for all of these years it's just recently that we put up the A and brother SOS right there he just re finished the door for us beautiful job we hope that with the addition of the awning that'll keep it nice for many years in the future s p you ready oh just a second we got to get [Music] [Applause] around a little closer welcome to the wed Memorial L hard you got no that was a delivery [Music] Harold you all just come around this way just a little bit some of you short on can stay in the air we're thankful for the next day the Lord's given us start out a little a little cool but uh you only have to ask been taught right we this is the library that we're uh it's evolving into a major seven Church age Library you know you don't start off with everything at one time but we have been able to acquire quite a few uh very old books some uh newer versions of old books um like on this top shelf for example there's a red series of blue and a green brother Bram had one of each of these he had this one the last blue one and the last green one that's what he uh studied from to get the um notes for the seven Church age message you know the revelation of Jesus Christ we went ahead and purchased the rest of the series see it has to do with that study um two people in particular are have been a big help and they're they're continuing to be a big help and that is Brother D mes who has a degree in library Sciences and also brother um uh Morris UNR back in Mississippi uh he's been a big help with books so we're going to ask Brother Floyd if he would uh say a few words he has you know he's going to have the dedication prayer for the the library but before he uh comes I'd like for Brother John to step up in here and tell us a few things that that brother BR told him because he was intimately uh connected with brother brandom in relation to this property and and he actually told him some things that I wanted you to hear he told me also I George I thank all of us that new brother brandom has probably many things for Testimony but the den itself and heing brother Co and speak and pray about it it's 1965 is first time of course we came up here and was personally me my brother Don rutle Richard Blair of course Roy Waters was hug here brother B Paul and uh brother Brown met us here and took us through the den here personally and told us several things happened in fact brother Jee Norman I think drove up and out he was doing some work in and out while we were here that day I think I saw you on film the other day brother brother Norman and uh we stood there right outside where they makes the turn and brother Brown went through the details of why he was doing you know how he always did it I don't know probably two or three times while we were here while he was taking us through brother George he mentioned and you know that this is not my house this is house is a memorial to my Ministry so he made that statement to us probably two or three times and the brothers that were standing there uh at at that time so I'm personally course I know everybody has their own feelings but I'm person personally

one thing that I'd like to say about the the the layout here those of youall that have never been to the house before this right behind this cabinet here there's a doorway that goes into our kitchen at the hours when the library is open that door will be closed and we've also put a set of doors in the hall so actually the library itself will be this L-shaped room the front uh former bedroom which is now an office the bathroom next to it and then there's doors in the hall so when people come they want to do work on the computer which will be available in the front office they want to sit and listen to a tape uh this unit here in the center of the room on the other side of it there is a a video uh entertainment center they can sit down they can watch the videos that we have uh we've tried to make it as versatile as possible they can do everything except to play the piano and they have to have special permission to play the Rebecca's piano but um we can open those doors in the hall and you're welcome to make yourself at home we'd like for you to see the rest of the house you know Dad did not live in this house he never lived in this house so we can't really say uh this is you know the way brother and sister Brandon lived but what we've tried to do is to make this reflect what brother and sister Brandon mean to us not just as my parents but what the ministry means to us when people walk into this Library I want them to know that William Brandon was a very special person that we care about William Brandon that we care about this Ministry it's nothing that we're we're doing it's not done in a in a backwards way we've wanted this to reflect the caring and the love that we feel for William Bram and for his ministry and I appreciate youall being here thank you can you tell the story you H well tell piano it's a special piano yeah it is back in it was 1965 was November of 1965 and we had lived out here for a few years and I didn't have a piano out here and U dad came to me one day and he said I have $900 and he said I'm going to go buy a piano so we headed down to the piano store here in town and and uh we went down to mullers and we walked in the front door and in the front of the shop were were spinets you know little pianos and uh pianos were expensive even back in 1965 and I knew that with the $900 we were definitely in the spin it part of the store that's where we needed to be and so I sat down and I started playing around on some of the Pian and um Dad was wandering around and he they they had opened double doors in the back of the store and they just wheeled this piano out in the back where it just been refin finished and so um Dad went back there and he walks around it and he yells sis come back here and play this one well you know I said dad I don't even want to play on it you know cuz that's out of our price range come back up here with me you know he goes no come back here and play only believe for me on this one so I walked back and I got you know five or six fet and I looked down it said steinle and I said no I am not playing on that because then every anything else in the store's going to sound bad and I'm not going to play on that he says only believe just for me so I sat down and I played only believe and he said this is our piano and the man came out and he and dad says how much is this piano the man said $1,100 dad said this is it I'll come up with the $200 this is our piano so we bought this piano brought it brought it up here to the house delivered up here to the house and this was in November of 65 and every place that George and I have moved we have moved this piano with us I mean it has been cross country it has you know it has had its knocks and a few years ago uh I called I wanted to get an appraisal on it for insurance purposes so I called mullers where Dad and I went and bought the piano and so I told him you know my dad bought me a piano there in 1965 I want to get an appraisal on it can you come out he says oh I won't need to just tell me your name so I told him William Brana so he disappears off the phone and comes back a few minutes later he says I'm looking at a photo copy of a of a check of Reverend William brandom for $900 and here for this piano and I said yes sir he said that's a Steinway we sold it for $900 $1,100 sorry and I said uh yes sir that's the one and he said we sold that piano for $1,100 I said yes sir you did you know well at that time the piano was worth $12,000 oh uh whenever we did the remodeling project here because my piano was going to be a part of the library I wanted to really shine in here and look nice we took it and had it refinished and then we had it appraised again the piano now was worth about $118,000 so from his $1,100 purchase would you play only believe one time for him you all will sing it [Music] all things are possible [Music] all things are [Music] possible and they're not the biggest you know or anything like that but the Lord chose that for him and I think a lot of times in our own lives we think oh I wish I had greater or bigger or better or the best or something like that but you know we got to pray for what the Lord chooses for us we want that specific thing and uh brother BR he he said so many times you know when I go into the Wilderness I go out there and I in other words I tank up I take in I take in so that I can come back to the pull pit and give out and give out and he said that you some people think that it's it's strange that hear a man of God to go out and hunt and kill animals and do you know brother BR said that all of these animals that the lord gave him his gifts was so that he would learn to trust help him to trust the Lord the Lord would say to him you know okay you're going to get a Carib with 42 in Horn and for the believe that he would go into the woods he' get that caribou and it would help him because he was a human being too it would help him when he got in the P pit and he knew that the Lord would keep his word you know it was a reminder that the Lord's going to keep his word he would come to the pulpit he would believe him to be there and he would keep his words and so all of these things that we're looking at here all these animals and everything they were lessons really they were little helps that the lord gave brother brandom to help him when he came to the pull pit and ministered to us and this is this is the little gift that the lord gave him uh does anybody have any questions anything you'd like to ask I know that you all been studying on this and you probably know more than I do but I'll do my best if you got any questions yes sir behalf of the young people at the church they had something to give to you that they loc oh my goodness well so much how sweet
