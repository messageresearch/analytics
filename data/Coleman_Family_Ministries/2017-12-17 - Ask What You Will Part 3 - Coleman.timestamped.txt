[29:41] attention to st. the Gospel of st. John
[29:44] 15 in Ephesians 1 in Ephesians 4
[30:15] I'm reading from st. John 15
[30:20] for verse
[30:25] first seven eight if he invited me and
[30:28] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[30:30] you will shall be done unto you
[30:33] I'm hearing it's my father glorified
[30:35] that ye bear much fruit so shall you be
[30:39] my disciples and st. Ephesians one over
[30:47] in the promised land in the land of the
[30:50] son of man
[30:52] amen
[30:58] glory
[31:03] first Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God
[31:08] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[31:10] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[31:14] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[31:17] and that's what but Nathanael told this
[31:19] morning he already did he hath already
[31:22] blessed us according as he hath chosen
[31:27] us in him before the foundation of the
[31:30] world
[31:36] that we should be holy and without blame
[31:39] before him in love having predestinated
[31:42] us unto the adoption of children by
[31:44] Jesus Christ himself
[31:46] to himself according to the good
[31:48] pleasure of his will
[31:49] Ephesians 4 verse 11 and if some
[31:54] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[31:58] and some pastors and teachers for the
[32:01] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[32:04] the ministry for the edifying of the
[32:06] body of Christ so we all come in the
[32:09] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[32:11] of the Son of God into a perfect man
[32:14] unto the measure of the stature of the
[32:17] fullness of Christ they gather blessed
[32:20] and read him his word so there's nobody
[32:23] gonna slip out first because we have to
[32:26] wait until we all come amen so you don't
[32:30] have to worry as it in this place or as
[32:31] a nap it's not till we all come into the
[32:34] unity of the faith amen wonderful where
[32:38] you may be seated
[32:40] praise God well friends brother Norman
[32:46] I believe a lot of my friends here have
[32:48] some of the tapes and from back in the
[32:53] the new warning a man and way back in 73
[32:58] a preach asked what you will part one
[33:00] then I've reached 75 1975 asked what you
[33:05] will part two so we want to finish it up
[33:09] tonight ask what you will part three
[33:23] amen
[33:30] well glory
[33:36] a man may be seated
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:41] my subject is the manifestation of the
[33:43] sons of God on the Bryant's third phase
[33:48] so by faith I'm stepping out and saying
[33:53] there will be a manifestation of the
[33:55] sons of God on the third phase where the
[33:58] spirit meets the sons a man this is our
[34:05] promise
[34:06] so is speaking my inspiration is first
[34:12] Corinthians 4 20 for the king of God is
[34:15] not in word but in power amen well
[34:21] praise God so I like the kind of thought
[34:26] that people are new and they come son
[34:28] been here for years and different
[34:30] degrees and whatever well like to kind
[34:34] of kind of nail it down in a couple of
[34:35] paragraphs what the message is and this
[34:39] is from a message I preached it's a long
[34:40] time ago now we what we here for now
[34:44] we're starting out so we can
[34:45] positionally find our place to be ready
[34:49] for the out of the great battle
[34:53] I saw is winding down now at World
[34:56] Council of Churches and all these things
[34:58] is going to come into view and the bride
[35:01] is coming along also hey man
[35:06] [Applause]
[35:11] amen Jason praise God
[35:15] it's okay and read something to you it's
[35:19] my own thoughts here positionally
[35:22] finding your place to be ready for the
[35:24] hour of battle though word is in the
[35:26] church in the person this is all
[35:28] prophesied see in other words the seed
[35:31] germ is in the body like it was in the
[35:34] Apostolic pride like it was a malachi
[35:37] for him and you believed that what was
[35:40] spoken by Jesus Christ was confirmed
[35:43] back
[35:44] amen unto the people by them that heard
[35:47] him is that correct
[35:48] God also bearing witness both with signs
[35:51] wonders miracles divers miracles and
[35:54] gifts of the Holy Ghost to his a
[35:55] according to his own will but holy ghost
[35:58] says here did some speaking this about
[36:00] faith now and this was a long time ago
[36:03] here so I'm saying the Holy Ghost is
[36:06] here on the third phase to perform this
[36:09] very thing with the Omega bride as he
[36:12] did with the Alpha bride amen
[36:19] now what is it may be seated
[36:22] the placing of the gifts and callings in
[36:26] Ephesians by the voice angel of
[36:29] revelation 10 8 through 11 which all
[36:32] these years was a manifestation to us of
[36:37] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is that
[36:40] angel tryna get us back to the Bible
[36:45] so we ever cross the world he had an
[36:48] anointing he had a revelation to get the
[36:50] people back to the Bible and that's what
[36:52] the thunders is all about a song no
[36:57] arguments no nothing we don't argue with
[37:01] anybody may be seated a lot of people
[37:04] say the Seventh Seal is closed and
[37:06] they're ready to fight and argue we say
[37:10] is open and we're praising God's name
[37:14] amen
[37:16] we don't have any quarrels on anybody
[37:19] it's opened a god said soul through the
[37:21] Prophet so I'm not going with these
[37:24] people

[37:29] was the angel now that angel has crossed
[37:32] over to Ephesians 4 the voicings you all
[37:37] these years by a manifestation of the

[43:49] he went out in a place of trying that's
[43:53] what he was in and he brought on the
[43:55] adoption season himself so I don't
[43:59] understand why the ministers don't
[44:00] preach it can't figure it out at all I
[44:02] mean the God has a provided way prophecy
[44:06] and now we're moving right on into

[44:19] bringing in the ranch and faith for his
[44:22] church that's right now watch what he
[44:25] said here so tonight I represent that
[44:28] faith the faith
[44:31] [Applause]
[44:36] that was delivered to the Saints in the
[44:39] way of a divine gift so you understand
[44:42] that now so when he went out for two
[44:45] pulls may be seated
[44:47] he went out for two pools and then God
[44:50] gave him divine gift to represent that
[44:53] faith and brother Brown said that Peter
[44:55] and the Apostles they had the same thing
[44:57] the same giving but then the Prophet was
[45:01] to go on further he was to come to a
[45:03] third Pole where he was open up all the
[45:06] mysteries in the Bible and that would
[45:08] bring us back to the faith and that was
[45:14] the third pull the opening of the word
[45:16] amen so he restored back to faith by the
[45:21] seven seals seven Thunder message which
[45:24] revealed the original Word the Apostolic
