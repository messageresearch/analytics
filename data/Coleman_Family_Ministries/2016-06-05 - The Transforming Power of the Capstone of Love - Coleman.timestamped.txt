[7:39] In that place where the cherubam's wings
[7:41] are tipped, the divine presence of the
[7:44] living God to speak back.
[7:49] And Aaron's rod budded in there. May we
[7:53] butt in there tonight. Praise his holy
[7:56] name. Glory to God.
[8:00] Hallelujah.
[8:03] Let's sing that song again
[8:06] that we sung before. I know it was a
[8:09] blood. I know it was the blood for me.
[8:14] [Music]
[8:16] I think a few more times around then
[8:18] we'll really understand
[8:21] and it was a blood for me and for you.
[8:28] Yes.
[8:30] Now you started tonight.
[8:33] Everybody sing.
[8:37] Yes. That's right.
[8:41] my God
[8:44] for me.
[8:48] But one day when I was lost, he died
[8:52] upon that cross. Well, I know it was the
[8:56] blood for now. Is he coming back or
[8:59] what? Well, he's coming. That's right,
[9:02] brother. Yes, he is.
[9:05] Why don't you shake somebody's hand?
[9:06] Tell him that back again for me.
[9:12] Well, one day

[9:27] blood. Hallelujah. Know it was the
[9:30] blood. Yes, I know.

[9:51] He's coming back again.
[9:54] He's coming back again.
[9:57] He's coming back again for me.
[10:04] When I was lost, he died upon the cross.
[10:11] Was the blood for me.
[10:15] Well, I know it was the blood.
[10:20] I know it was the blood. I know it was
[10:24] the blood for me.
[10:29] One day when I was lost, oh he died upon
[10:34] the cross. I know the blood for me.
[10:40] Glory. He's coming back again.
[10:45] He's coming back again.
[10:49] Back again for me.
[10:54] Thank you, Lord. when I was lost. Well,
[10:57] he died upon the cross.
[11:00] He's coming back again for me.
[11:07] How many feel that way tonight? Say,
[11:09] "Amen.
[11:11] Lord, I know you're coming back for me.
[11:15] Thank you, Lord." Oh, praise God. God be
[11:19] praised. God be praised. Thank you,
[11:22] Jesus.
[11:24] Thank you, Lord.
[11:25] [Music]
[11:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[11:31] Did you enjoy that song?
[11:34] The Holy of Holies.
[11:37] Praise God. That's been my inspiration
[11:42] since I first started. And then joined
[11:45] later on by brother Robbo to take you
[11:48] into the holiest of holies.
[11:51] And that song is dedicated sang. They
[11:54] they just got a hold of it the other
[11:55] day. I says, "I want that for Sunday
[11:57] night cuz this is my climax tonight. I
[12:00] won't be seeing you for a while. I'm
[12:03] finally going to take that month off."
[12:05] Amen. So, I wanted to
[12:08] all what I've been trying to do was to
[12:10] take you into the holy holy of holies,
[12:14] pass the riven veil, where the glories
[12:18] never fail.
[12:20] Praise God. Past the outer court, past
[12:24] the holy place, past the brass altar,
[12:28] rip down the curtain of selfwell.
[12:32] Amen. And enter into a holy way. Praise
[12:37] God. Over the mercy seat where the go is
[12:41] overlaid with gold and the blood is
[12:44] sprinkled seven times to the east.
[12:47] Praise God. As an atonement for you and
[12:49] I. Oh, catch a revelation of this.
[12:52] Praise God.
[12:54] And the song says, "So take me into the
[12:56] holy of holies. Take me in by the blood
[12:59] of the lamb. Uh, take me into the holy
[13:02] of holies. Take the cold. Cleanse my
[13:04] lips. Here I am." So, and I want to be
[13:07] there. So, take me in. So, that's what
[13:10] this song was dedicated for. May God
[13:13] Richie bless them for singing it so
[13:15] beautifully tonight. Now, amen.
[13:19] Praise God.
[13:22] Amen. And Wednesday, I want to announce
[13:25] that the message of the Lord laid upon
[13:28] my heart to play for the church and
[13:30] other groups they want to join in is the
[13:32] ministry of Jesus Christ identified
[13:36] in uh Canada. Uh was May 17th, 1986.
[13:42] And I happened to hear it yesterday.
[13:43] Brother Norman gave me a a cassette and
[13:47] I heard it and I couldn't believe that
[13:49] this is exactly what I've been preaching
[13:50] these last eight messages, but it ties
[13:53] it all together and tells you how to
[13:55] climb that pyramid.
[13:57] Praise God.
[13:59] So, um, we we also want to tell you
[14:02] that, uh, some of us went down to
[14:04] Pennsylvania to Lebanon and in the area
[14:07] there. Uh, they had an eastern regional
[14:10] meeting, the different ones that meet in
[14:12] the east. And uh, they invited uh, us
[14:16] down for the first time, but I didn't
[14:18] get the uh, invitation. It was a mix up
[14:21] in the mail, I suppose, until Monday. So
[14:24] I was only able to announce it
[14:25] Wednesday, but of course whoever would
[14:27] have been here Wednesday, they was in
[14:29] service, then they would have known. So
[14:32] if he wasn't here, then of course you
[14:34] couldn't know. But if he was here
[14:35] Wednesday, many of them came down. But
[14:38] of course, if everybody was here
[14:39] Wednesday, would it wouldn't have been
[14:40] enough room. So the Holy Spirit knows
[14:42] how to do it. Amen. So brother Billy
[14:45] Paul did speak and it was a tremendous
[14:48] uh testimony that he gave and I believe
[14:50] brother Michael uh is got it on on
[14:52] video. Brother Michael, you got it. We
[14:54] like to get a a copy of it and sometimes
[14:56] show it to you. So, praise God. Well,
[14:58] I'd like to invite your attention now uh
[15:01] to Genesis 1, first chapter, Romans 12,
[15:06] and 2 Peter 1. And I told you I wanted
[15:09] to come in here on a Sunday night. And
[15:12] so, here I am. And find only a few
[15:15] people here. Amen.
[15:17] So, everything is just right. Only a few
[15:19] people is here. I'm here. Praise God.
[15:21] I'm ready to preach. Amen. It's the same
[15:23] to me if it's 5,000 people. It doesn't
[15:25] matter.
[15:27] Praise God. It's God's word. Amen. So,
[15:30] Genesis 1,
[15:39] in the beginning, God created the heaven
[15:40] and the earth.
[15:42] And this earth was without form and
[15:45] void, and darkness was upon the face of
[15:49] the deep. And the spirit of God moved
[15:52] upon the face of the waters. And God
[15:55] said, "Let there be light." And there
[15:57] was light. And God saw the light that it
[16:01] was good. And God divided the light from
[16:04] the darkness. Now, whenever God says,
[16:06] "Let there be light," he always scatters
[16:09] the darkness every time. Praise God.
[16:14] Amen. Verse 11. And we just about that
[16:16] time now for God to say, "Let there be
[16:19] light of Joseph perfection and watch it
[16:22] scatter." Oh, praise God. Verse 11. And
[16:27] God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[16:28] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[16:32] fruit tree yielding fruit after his his
[16:35] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[16:40] earth." Seed's already there. And it was
[16:43] so. And the earth brought forth grass
[16:46] and herb yielding seed after his kind,
[16:50] and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
[16:53] was in itself. And it it was a a
[16:57] germatized quickened seed. It wasn't
[16:59] dead. Amen. And after his kind. Glory.
[17:03] And God saw that it was good.
[17:05] Hallelujah.
[17:07] Romans 12. Glory to God. Romans 12.
[17:12] Amen. I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[17:15] by the mercies of God, that you present
[17:17] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[17:19] acceptable unto God, which is your
[17:21] reasonable service. And be ye not
[17:24] conformed to this world, but be ye
[17:26] transformed by the renewing of your
[17:27] mind, that you may prove what is that
[17:30] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[17:33] God. Amen. Amen. Second Peter
[17:37] uh first chapter
[17:40] um verse three. According as his divine
[17:43] power hath given unto us all things that
[17:46] pertain to life and godliness through
[17:48] the knowledge of him that Amen. that
[17:51] hath called us to glory and virtue.
[17:54] Amen.
[17:56] Praise God.
[17:59] Yes, sir.
[18:00] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[18:03] great and precious what? Promises. That
[18:06] by these what promises? Ye might be
[18:09] partakers of the divine nature, having
[18:12] escaped the corruption. Amen. Escaped
[18:14] the corruption that is in the world
[18:17] through lust. Amen. Praise God.
[18:21] And besides this, given all diligence,
[18:26] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[18:28] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[18:31] and to temperance patience, and to
[18:33] patience godliness,
[18:35] and to godliness brotherly kindness, and
[18:38] to brotherly kindness charity.
[18:41] Hallelujah. For if if these things be in
[18:45] you and abound, they make you that ye
[18:49] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[18:52] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[18:55] Christ. May God a blessing to read of
[18:57] his word. Amen. Have a word of prayer.
[19:02] Almighty God, as I stand here tonight,
[19:05] Father, weary and weak Lord, and you

[19:11] October 7th and the 21st, and that
[19:14] brother Obla and I was a preacher
[19:16] morning and night, but then the birth of
[19:18] the baby came on the 7th and then you
[19:21] gave me that message that you wanted the
[19:23] whole church to hear at the same time on
[19:25] the seventh. So, you control the birth
[19:28] that Brother Obla couldn't preach then.
[19:30] Amen. May they pick this up now and
[19:33] understand why you wanted everybody to
[19:36] hear Joseph perfection releases the Holy
[19:38] Ghost at the same day, the same time
[19:41] that they might be in the spirit. Praise
[19:43] God.
[19:45] Amen. And now tonight, Lord, may you
[19:49] pour out the Holy Spirit, strengthen my
[19:51] body. I don't care if it's five people

[20:06] the way down to New Zealand and
[20:07] Australia, may the fire shake from one
[20:09] side of the earth all the way down to
[20:11] the other side. Praise God. May there be
[20:14] a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[20:16] here tonight. Oh, praise God. Thank you,
[20:19] Jesus. Lord, strengthen my body to
[20:22] deliver this message. I commit it to thy
[20:25] hand and I pray every person will be
[20:27] shaken in here tonight. May not one of
[20:30] them leave here the same way they come
[20:32] in here. Oh God, send out your
[20:34] transforming power. Yes sir. Father, we
[20:38] commit into thy hands the message to
[20:40] people myself in Jesus name we pray and
[20:43] ask the blessing. Amen and amen and

[21:10] Paul that's right and Wednesday I want
[21:12] to play the tape amen and explains how
[21:15] to climb that ladder and you and see the
[21:18] Holy Spirit just disguises himself as
[21:21] virtue and comes down in virtue and
[21:24] gives you power into your faith and then
[21:27] you begin to climb the ladder, but you
[21:29] got to pray for it. Amen. Lord, pour out
[21:32] virtue that I might be able to to climb

[21:40] God. Amen. So, you're here to tape
[21:43] yourself. Amen. Now, my title tonight,
[21:45] Brother Norman, the transforming power
[21:48] of the capstone of love.
[21:51] And my subject is let Joseph perfection
[21:55] seed come forth after his kind.
[22:00] Let him come forth. Praise God. It's
[22:02] been planted. Praise God. Let it come
[22:05] forth. Amen. And my inspiration is
[22:08] conforming ourselves to the image of
[22:11] Jesus Christ. So we thank the choir for
[22:14] that beautiful song. Take me into the
[22:16] holy of holies. Praise God.
[22:20] Now 19 uh July 27, 1990 here the Holy
[22:24] Spirit told me to break off from my
[22:26] message of July 8th the manifestation of
[22:29] the the the seed word Joseph affection
[22:32] and good ground. He said break off spin
[22:35] off of about three or four or five
[22:37] messages. Amen. So and it spun off. I
[22:40] was just watching it. Amen. and brother
[22:42] brother Oblato, he came in with three
[22:44] and then I saw uh last Sunday uh he told
[22:48] me to preach the 7th and the 21st. I
[22:50] didn't know anything about the 14th at
[22:52] all till he spoke to me uh on a Thursday
[22:54] or Friday and said, "Now you got them up
[22:57] on Joseph perfection and you're going to
[22:59] bring them forth on the 21st." He said,
[23:01] "But they haven't died yet. So now you
[23:03] got to take them in the ground." So
[23:05] that's how last Sunday's message was
[23:07] born. The death of a corner wheat.
[23:09] Praise God.
[23:11] So, praise God. If you've done that or
[23:13] trying to do that, then you will
[23:14] certainly come forth after his kind.
[23:18] And won't nobody else come forth except
[23:20] those that have died and rotted in the
[23:24] ground. Praise God. That's the only kind
[23:26] that can come forth.
[23:28] Amen. So, praise God. uh he said from
[23:32] this message here so I have by God's
[23:34] grace I have endeavored to do this in

[24:01] transforming power of the capstone of
[24:03] love. And brother Robo history message

[24:11] care of Simon. Praise God. And this
[24:14] morning I didn't hear the message this
[24:15] morning. I was busy. So I know something
[24:17] about some leaving your rags over there
[24:20] somewhere. Praise God. And uh and Joseph
[24:23] affection. And so therefore I know it
[24:24] was a masterpiece, but I didn't hear it
[24:26] all. So I got to wait for the tape like
[24:28] you. Amen. So now with brother Roberto's
[24:30] three messages and my five making a
[24:32] total of eight. Amen. I trust and pray
[24:35] to bring a real blessing to you and to

[24:45] so I got to wait for you. Amen. You got
[24:48] to come up here and uh I'll be standing
[24:50] by that malberry tree. Praise God. I'll

[24:56] hearing your prayers. Lord, seal me,
[24:58] Lord. Lord, pour down the virtue, Lord.
[25:02] Lord, send down temperance and patience
[25:04] and godliness. That's what I'll be
[25:05] hearing over there. Oh, and it's not
[25:08] going to stop see unceasingly.
[25:12] So, may you seek God daily
[25:16] until every one of these qualifications
[25:19] that's on that board there uh uh uh is
[25:22] living in you, made manifest. and the
[25:25] capstone cap off the pyramids of your

[25:41] We thank you Lord for this inspiration.
[25:44] We give ourselves fully to you Lord. And
[25:47] may the promise of the bride's promises
[25:49] of dynamics to her mechanics come to her
[25:52] this day in this season and shake this
[25:55] church with the power of the Holy Ghost
[25:57] tonight. Amen. And wherever this tape
[26:00] goes, may it shake and shake and shake.
[26:04] Praise God. May everybody here tonight
[26:07] that's seeking the Holy Ghost, my God,
[26:09] may you be filled, praise God, with the
[26:12] Holy Ghost and fire. May you be
[26:15] refilled. Praise God.
[26:18] So may may we become one soul that great
[26:21] grace and great power can pour out upon
[26:25] each of us here and wherever these tapes
[26:28] go that we might be real witnesses.
[26:31] Amen. For Christ in these last days as
[26:35] love slaves, prisoners unto the Lord. Do
[26:40] you want that there? And then you pray
[26:42] that for me and I'll pray it for you.
[26:45] Amen. And so after tonight, I want to
[26:48] take a long rest after 16 hard years of
[26:51] pounding away with these promises of
[26:53] Malachi 4's message and we and be healed
[26:56] and strengthened when I return to the
[26:58] battlefield. God bless you.
[27:01] Hey, we're here now. I can rest.
[27:05] Praise God. And whatever you sow, that
[27:09] what is what you shall reap. Praise God.
[27:12] Now our title is the transforming power
[27:15] of the capstone of love. Our subject is
[27:18] let Joseph perfection seed come forth
[27:22] after his kind. And inspiration is the
[27:25] conforming ourselves to the image of
[27:27] Jesus Christ. Now question uh what does
[27:30] the transformation mean? And number two
[27:33] what is the transforming power and what
[27:35] does the transforming? So therefore we
[27:38] find on God's power to transform. Amen.
[27:41] On page five
[27:43] and uh page five and about paragraph 37
[27:48] and he's explained by the dictionary and
[27:50] in the dictionary it says that is
[27:52] something that's changed. It's to be
[27:54] changed transformed made different than
[27:57] what it was. It's been uh its character
[28:01] and everything has been changed in it to
[28:04] transform. And when you left the world,
[28:07] became a Christian, you were changed,
[28:10] transformed by the power of God. Amen.
[28:15] Yes, sir. Praise God.
[28:20] Amen.
[28:21] So now it's and it's so therefore
[28:24] transformed meaning it means to be
[28:26] changed. Amen. Paragraph 38. And I think
[28:30] in this morning in Genesis 1, this world
[28:33] was without form. It and it was void and
[28:37] darkness was upon the earth. Nothing but
[28:40] a complete chaos. And when this world
[28:43] was in that condition, the spirit of God
[28:46] moved upon the face of the water and the
[28:49] entire picture was changed. And he's
[28:52] still God. He can change your picture
[28:55] tonight.
[28:56] is not so deep, not too far. Amen. Not
[29:01] too impossible that the spirit of the
[29:04] Lord cannot move upon you. Praise God.
[29:07] And totally completely change you. Halle
[29:11] Don't you ever give up hope. Don't you
[29:13] ever lose faith. He can do it. Yes, he
[29:15] can. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:22] And when you have real faith in this
[29:24] pastor, then he can go and pray for your
[29:27] whole household and they can be changed.
[29:31] When you can get rid of your suspicious
[29:33] uh nature about the pastor, praise God.
[29:35] Then I'll walk in your house with thus
[29:37] says God. I said, "Move aside, brother.
[29:40] The Lord just told me that you have
[29:42] faith in me and sent me over here to
[29:44] pray for you and your entire family."
[29:46] Praise God. and watch the power of God
[29:48] hit your house and watch them come out
[29:50] of there. Some that don't even say thank
[29:52] you or nothing in your home. Praise God.
[29:55] The power of God can come in there.
[29:57] Praise God. And change that whole thing.
[30:01] Oh yes, he can. Praise God. But you got
[30:03] to you got to have faith in the
[30:05] ministry. Praise God. You can't be
[30:07] suspicious of what I'm doing, why I'm
[30:09] doing it. Just trust me. Praise God. I
[30:12] know what I'm doing. Oh, hallelujah.
[30:15] Praise God.
[30:17] may be seated. Praise God. What does
[30:19] transform mean? Uh uh and the whole
[30:22] entire picture was changed from a total
[30:24] chaos to a garden of Eden. That is
[30:27] transforming power of God that can take
[30:30] something that's nothing. Amen. Praise
[30:34] God.
[30:36] And the entire picture was changed from
[30:37] a total chaos to a garden of Eden. That
[30:40] is the transforming power of God that
[30:42] can take something that's nothing and
[30:44] make something wonderful out of it.
[30:46] God's transforming power is the spirit
[30:49] of God. And the spirit of God is here
[30:51] tonight.
[30:53] And I'm showing you on here how he
[30:55] progresses up as he did with his church
[30:57] age. So he does with the individuals
[30:59] according to Malachi 4's message which
[31:02] is thus sayaith the Lord.
[31:04] Amen.
[31:06] My God transforming power. Amen. And
[31:11] page six, he said paragraph 49. Now God
[31:14] in 6,000 years had planted all these
[31:16] wonderful seeds or he had spoke his
[31:19] word. Now we understand we don't know
[31:22] what was in the beginning God. That's
[31:25] it. In the well went in the beginning
[31:28] God.
[31:30] Well when was that? We were way past a
[31:32] theologian's mind. God,
[31:36] no school, no theologian, no bishop can
[31:39] go past in the beginning.
[31:42] Now, you might have had another world
[31:43] over there where the angels lived at. I
[31:45] don't know. Praise God. Will they walk
[31:48] up and down earth? I don't know. But all
[31:51] I know is Genesis 1 says in the
[31:52] beginning, God, you might have planted
[31:55] seeds, had all this oak tree and this
[31:57] kind of tree, everything was already
[31:59] there. But something happened and a
[32:02] judgment went forth. Praise God. Then
[32:04] the world was without form and void and
[32:08] dark and chaos.
[32:11] Hallelujah. Praise God. But God say I'm
[32:14] going to do it again by my word.
[32:17] Hallelujah. It could be. I don't know.
[32:20] Glory.
[32:22] Hallelujah.
[32:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[32:26] Praise God.
[32:29] Yes. Are you in the spirit now?
[32:31] I can feel vibrations coming back.
[32:34] Hallelujah.
[32:36] Stay in the spirit.
[32:39] Glory. Anything can happen. Glory. May
[32:44] be seated. Now God in 6,000 years had
[32:47] planted all these wonderful seeds or had
[32:49] spoke his word. It shall be this way.
[32:52] This tree shall be. This shall be.
[32:55] Everything was perfect. Amen. Perfect.
[32:58] The tree shall be this. It was just
[33:00] good. And he commanded each one of those
[33:02] seeds that they would be uh they would
[33:06] transform themselves into the plant of
[33:10] which kind of life that the word of God
[33:13] has spoken in them should be.
[33:17] That's a good one cuz he told me the
[33:19] same thing in 1964.
[33:22] Cuz I put power in you and you going to
[33:24] transform yourself into Joseph
[33:26] perfection one day. And I believe it
[33:28] because the potentials is in me.
[33:32] The power is in me. Praise God. And
[33:34] that's what I aspire to be. I don't want
[33:38] to be anything else in this world. I
[33:40] don't want no the world's money. I don't
[33:42] want the lust in the things of the
[33:43] world. I want to be Joseph perfection on
[33:46] this earth. A type of Jesus Christ
[33:49] because the potentials is in me. Praise
[33:52] God. He put it in me.
[33:55] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. And that's
[33:57] what you should want yourself. If you
[33:59] don't have that desire, you should be on
[34:01] your knees praying, "Lord God, I'm in
[34:03] the age of Joseph perfection. I don't
[34:05] want no other age." Let that be a
[34:07] revelation in me. Hallelujah. Live or
[34:10] die, sink or swim, denomination, no
[34:13] denomination.
[34:14] Praise God. Husband or no husband.
[34:16] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[34:20] Glory.
[34:22] Hey, let a revelation pour in these
[34:24] people here tonight and out on this
[34:26] tape. Praise God. May come roaring off
[34:29] of there. Praise God. Hallelujah. To
[34:32] leave this world. We got to leave.
[34:35] We can't stay here all the time. But we
[34:38] have to be ready to go.
[34:40] Amen. Amen. I'm not trying to preach you
[34:44] to scare you either. That's right, young
[34:46] sister. I ain't trying to scare you. I
[34:48] don't need to scare you. God don't need
[34:50] you. Praise God. Hallelujah. God will
[34:54] wipe you out of here. Praise God.
[34:55] Talking about I'm preaching to the young
[34:57] people to try to scare them. I ain't
[34:58] trying to scare anybody. Praise God.
[35:01] Amen. If you want to go do your thing,
[35:03] well, go ahead and do your thing. Praise
[35:05] God. And I'm doing my thing. Praise God.
[35:08] I'm trying to be like Jesus. I'm trying
[35:11] to be like Jesus.
[35:13] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[35:16] Yes, sir. Amen.
[35:19] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[35:25] Glory to God.
[35:27] You may be seated, but that's good. If
[35:30] it was an oak tree, it was to bring
[35:32] forth an oak. If it was a palm, it was
[35:35] to bring forth a palm. Because the great
[35:38] creator had just sent forth his word. Do
[35:43] you understand? He sent forth his word
[35:46] seed.
[35:49] and was there before the real seed was
[35:53] ever formed. Yes, sir. And watch. And
[35:56] the word formed the seed.
[36:00] Yes, sir.
[36:02] See, he made the world out of things
[36:04] that does not appear. By the word. When
[36:08] he spoke it, those were words seeds. And
[36:11] the real thing wasn't seen yet. the real
[36:14] seeds cuz it was covered over without
[36:16] form, void, darkness, chaos was already
[36:20] there. The word seeds. All he had to do
[36:23] was say, "Let there be." Praise God.
[36:26] Separate. Praise God. And up they come.
[36:28] Praise God. Cuz the power and the
[36:31] potentials was already in them. And you
[36:34] have the Holy Ghost tonight. Hallelujah.
[36:37] The power and the potential is already
[36:40] in you tonight to be transformed into
[36:43] what he wants you to be. And and you
[36:46] know what? You're going to be that.
[36:50] You are going to be exactly what he
[36:53] wants you to be. Whether the devil likes
[36:55] it or not, there ain't enough devils in
[36:58] hell to stop it. God has spoken. Let
[37:02] there be light. Praise God. The Holy
[37:05] Spirit brooded over the word seed and
[37:09] there was light. Let there be a bride in
[37:12] the last days. Hallelujah. And the Holy
[37:15] Spirit is brooding over you now. And
[37:17] there shall be light. Pray. There shall
[37:20] be light in the evening time.
[37:23] Glory.
[37:25] Hallelujah. Don't you give up now.
[37:27] Praise God. You be encouraged. You keep
[37:29] on pressing. You keep on pressing. Keep
[37:31] moving. Keep moving. Praise God. You're
[37:34] going to be sealed.
[37:36] You may be seated. Amen.
[37:39] Glory to God. He sent forth his word and
[37:41] the word seed was there before the real
[37:43] seed was ever formed. And the word
[37:45] formed the seed. See, he made the word
[37:47] out of things that does not appear. He
[37:49] made the world by his word. God spoke
[37:51] everything into existence. Amen.
[37:55] So therefore uh what uh does the
[37:58] transform transform mean here? And the
[38:01] entire picture was changed from the
[38:03] total chaos to the garden of Eden. And
[38:05] that is transforming power of God that
[38:07] can take something that's nothing and
[38:10] make something wonderful out of it. Oh
[38:12] yes, he can.
[38:14] Amen. And God has sent forth his word
[38:17] only. And the word seed was there before
[38:19] the real seed would ever form. This just
[38:21] bringing it back for your mind. You
[38:22] might have been shouting and missed it.
[38:24] Amen. And the word formed the seed. Yes,
[38:27] sir. Genesis 1:3, God said, "Let there
[38:28] be light." And there was light. God sent
[38:31] forth his word,
[38:33] excuse me, and the word seed was there.
[38:36] Let there be light was the word seed.
[38:39] When he said, "Let there be light," that
[38:40] was the word seed before the real seed
[38:43] would ever form. And then when he said,
[38:45] "Let there be light," that was the word
[38:46] seed spoken from his mouth. Then the
[38:49] Holy Spirit was commissioned to fly over
[38:52] that word seed and brood over that word
[38:56] seed. A Holy Ghost come upon that word
[38:59] seed.
[39:00] Amen. To transform that word seed with
[39:04] the potentials in it to be what he wants
[39:06] it to be.
[39:09] And why are you doubting when the word
[39:12] seed is in you with the potentials to be
[39:14] what it's supposed to be?
[39:17] What you if you don't have the Holy
[39:19] Ghost, what you want to be is
[39:20] germmitized.
[39:22] Lord God, germitize this word seed in
[39:24] me. Praise God. That I might be what you
[39:26] want me to be. And I know I'm going to
[39:28] be it because the word is in me. Praise
[39:31] God. Before the foundation of the world,
[39:33] I was back there shouting and screaming
[39:35] and dancing and these devils can't stop
[39:38] me. Praise God. But what I need is a
[39:40] Holy Ghost. I need to be germatized. I
[39:43] need to be lifted up out of this world
[39:44] and atmosphere and the whole thing.
[39:47] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[39:51] Yes, sir. You may be seated. Don't let
[39:54] nothing stop you. Hallelujah. Nothing.
[39:56] Nothing. Nothing. nothing. Amen.
[40:00] And the Holy Ghost brewed over the word
[40:02] seed and the word formed the seed and
[40:05] there was light. Praise God. And God put
[40:07] seeds in the earth. Amen. Genesis 1 uh
[40:11] 11 and 12 which I just read. So on page
[40:15] 9 here, he speaks about Genesis 1 and 12
[40:20] and everything was under control to
[40:21] bring forth of its kind. Now remember to
[40:24] bring when you put the seed in the earth
[40:26] the seed can only bring forth with the
[40:28] power of life within it. It's got to be
[40:31] in there. Otherwise see when the Holy
[40:34] Spirit I keep telling them get them
[40:36] seeds into you cuz now when he comes
[40:38] he's here what he sweeps over here. He
[40:41] can only bring forth according to the
[40:43] power that's in it.
[40:48] If it's a worldly seed it'll be a
[40:49] worldly seed.
[40:51] But if it's a died out, praise God, uh,
[40:54] sanctified, hallelujah, holding on to
[40:57] the horns of the altar seed, then it'll
[40:59] bring forth that kind and it it has
[41:02] birth pains. It's not afraid to say,
[41:04] "I'm sorry. I repent and not go all
[41:07] around this way and that way and try to
[41:09] figure it out and well, it wasn't me. It
[41:11] was you." Amen. It was you.
[41:15] Praise. People don't even know how to
[41:16] repent.
[41:18] Pray. They put it on a phantom. Amen.
[41:20] No, the Phantom did it. Amen. Praise
[41:23] God. Hallelujah.
[41:26] Glory.
[41:27] Praise God.
[41:29] When he put the seed in the earth, the
[41:31] seed can only come forth with the power
[41:33] of life within it to transform it from a
[41:36] seed to a plant or whatever it was. His
[41:39] transforming power. Now, God put the
[41:41] seed in there with potential. That's
[41:44] Genesis 1 11-12. That it would be what
[41:47] he said it would be. And as long as it
[41:49] stayed in its right category,
[41:52] it would be just exactly what God said
[41:56] it would be. I don't care what they
[41:58] doing in Saudi Arabia. I don't care what
[42:01] they doing on 42nd Street with the the
[42:03] the what the rockers and the what these
[42:06] people the the the crews or somebody. I
[42:09] don't care what they're doing. I don't
[42:11] care all the murders and things that's
[42:12] going on that ain't got nothing to do
[42:14] with me.
[42:16] I mean, I'm going to be a real seed.
[42:20] That's not I ain't got nothing to do. I
[42:21] only hardly read the papers. Praise God.
[42:24] I don't want to look at this stuff. I
[42:26] want to see Jesus.
[42:29] Hallelujah. Glory.
[42:34] Amen. May be seated. Now, God put the
[42:38] seat in there with potentials. Amen.
[42:41] that it would be what he said it would
[42:42] be. As long as it stayed in the right
[42:44] category, it would be just exactly what
[42:46] God said it would be. It It had to be
[42:49] that way because he had made it that way
[42:52] and made a channel and anything that
[42:55] stays in his channel in his line of wor.
[43:06] It cannot move from there because angels
[43:10] are holding you there.
[43:13] You can't move. The Holy Spirit's got
[43:16] you right there. And angels go forth to
[43:19] watch over you and bring you to your
[43:21] salvation. Praise God. Oh, hallelujah.
[43:24] Praise God. You can't make a mist make a
[43:28] mistake. If you step this way, all
[43:31] things work together for good. Don't be
[43:34] all down and sad.
[43:36] Put your shoulders back, Brother Kelvin.
[43:39] Praise God. Put your chest out. Lift
[43:41] your head high. Praise God. The
[43:43] thunderses across the earth. Thank you,
[43:45] brother Burfield. Praise God.
[43:48] Hallelujah. God bless you, my friends
[43:50] down there in New Zealand and Australia.
[43:53] May the Lord richly bless you down
[43:55] there. May God pour out the Holy Spirit.
[43:58] Praise God in your assemblies down there
[44:01] for staying with this message.
[44:03] Hallelujah. Praise God. You may be
[44:05] seated. Cannot move from there. This
[44:07] channel just exactly right. So with
[44:09] everything in the trust in his own son
[44:12] that it would be that way. Then God said
[44:15] it's all good.
[44:17] He rested on the seventh day. And God
[44:20] did the same thing in the seventh church
[44:22] age after his son Malachi forth had
[44:25] planted these seeds. Praise God. And on
[44:28] the wings of the snow white dove, next
[44:31] message coming forth. Exactly. Dove
[44:33] leading eagle. He says, "All good.
[44:37] Report home my servant." Praise God. You
[44:39] have planted every seed from the Bible
[44:41] from Genesis all the way through
[44:42] Revelation. Reveal every mystery. Open
[44:45] the seven seal, thundered out the
[44:47] thunders. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[44:49] Somebody going to pick it up. May these
[44:51] young men pick it up and sweep it on.
[44:54] May these men bring it to life and make
[44:57] more sense out of it. Praise God. Ain't
[44:59] everything is right in the kilter. Ain't
[45:02] nothing out of line. Everything is
[45:04] exactly the way God wants it tonight in
[45:07] your life tonight.
[45:10] Hallelujah. He's brought you this here
[45:12] this way. Hallelujah.
[45:14] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God.
[45:20] He's brought you a few trials. He's
[45:22] maybe taking your son, maybe two sons,
[45:25] and maybe your daughter, they look all
[45:27] messed up, but he did that to break your
[45:31] spirit. Praise God. That you might cry
[45:34] out to him. Praise God. That's right.
[45:36] Husband and wife, both. Praise God. He's
[45:39] doing that. Until you accept his will,
[45:42] he will keep on doing it. So, you might
[45:45] as well accept his will tonight.
[45:49] And when you do, it's finished forever.
[45:53] Hallelujah.
[45:54] Glory to God.
[45:57] Oh, hallelujah. You may be seated
[46:00] is channel exactly right. So everything
[46:02] is trusting his own son. Oh, where' that
[46:04] come from? That would be that way. And
[46:06] then God said, "It's good. I'll just
[46:08] rest." Amen. He's resting now. Praise
[46:12] God. Amen. So I'll just rest. Each one
[46:15] of those uh you know the seven seal
[46:17] open. Praise God. and thundered seven
[46:19] times on the nail prayer. God's resting.
[46:21] God's waiting. Uh he already descended.
[46:24] He does three things. Uh the shout and
[46:26] the voice in the trunk. So therefore,
[46:27] ain't nothing wrong. The shout has
[46:30] already gone forth. What are you talking
[46:31] about? Why are you discouraged? Huh? Why
[46:35] are you discouraged when the Lord
[46:37] himself has already descended from
[46:40] heaven with a shout?
[46:44] You in this age, in the rapture time,
[46:48] So why is your face down?
[46:52] Praise God.
[46:54] I don't understand it.
[46:57] People walking around with long faces.
[47:00] You have everything to shout for,
[47:02] everything to stand up on your feet for
[47:05] to praise God.
[47:08] Glory. You may be seated.
[47:11] Amen.
[47:13] Hallelujah.
[47:14] It's all good. I'll just rest. Each one
[47:16] of those seas has power in itself to see
[47:20] God knows.
[47:24] God knows after the prophet left who the
[47:27] predestinated seeds are and he knows
[47:30] that they have power within themselves.
[47:33] So when he sends the dynamics, he
[47:35] already knows what's going to happen.
[47:37] He's going to have this. He knows that.
[47:42] So why worry?
[47:45] Be happy. Why worry?
[47:49] Huh?
[47:52] Glory to God. Be happy. Why worry?
[47:55] Hallelujah.
[47:56] [Music]
[47:57] Even the man in the world said that.
[47:59] Praise God. You may be seated. Christian
[48:02] is unhappy. Yes, sir. I'll rest. Each
[48:06] one of those seats has power in itself
[48:08] to transform it itself into the species
[48:11] that I desire it to be. Not what they
[48:15] want you to be, but what he wants you to
[48:16] be. I'm not going to be what you want me
[48:18] to be. I'm not going to preach the way
[48:20] you want me to preach. No, I'm not going
[48:23] to say the thing that you want me to
[48:24] say. I'm going to say what I'm what he
[48:26] want me to say. And when I say it, that
[48:29] will deliver you and you and your family
[48:32] if you accept it in the beloved.
[48:37] Hallelujah.
[48:38] You may be seated. Praise God. Amen.
[48:43] That's what I desire to be. That's what
[48:45] it must be because I have given every
[48:47] seed transforming power to make out of
[48:51] itself in its potentials. Now to make
[48:54] out of itself exactly what I want it to
[48:56] be. God has never changed as the same
[48:59] today as he was then. God is determined
[49:02] to do something. He'll do it. Nothing is
[49:05] going to stop him. He'll do it. And I
[49:08] say he'll do it.
[49:11] Yes, sir. Oh, glory. Now, remember, the
[49:14] sea can only come forth with the power
[49:16] of life within it to transform it from a
[49:18] seed uh to a plant or whatever it was by
[49:22] his transforming power. And God put the
[49:25] word seat in there with his potentials
[49:28] that it would be what he said it would
[49:30] be. And as long as it stayed in the
[49:32] right category, it would be exactly what
[49:34] God said it would be. And each uh are
[49:37] and each age of those seeds has power in
[49:40] itself. Each one of those seeds rather.
[49:42] Amen. To transform itself into the
[49:45] species that I desire it to be. That uh
[49:49] that's what I want. That's what it must
[49:52] be. I have given every seed transforming
[49:55] power to make out of itself in its
[49:58] potentials to make out of itself for
[50:01] exactly what I want it to be. How we
[50:04] thank God for this evening time promise
[50:06] of God from Malachi 4 for the end time
[50:09] bride.
[50:11] Oh, I thank him and I praise him. My
[50:15] how are we transformed into this image
[50:18] of Christ? Amen. on now how is it done
[50:22] on page 15 God's transforming power this
[50:25] is the way it's done
[50:28] uh but I'm so glad paragraph 110 and
[50:31] through 112 I'm so glad that God is
[50:34] mindful us again
[50:37] are you glad that God is mindful of you
[50:39] again oh I'm glad that he is Lord here's
[50:43] my hand that you're mindful of me to
[50:45] send me a prophet praise God how to get
[50:48] out of here how to escape
[50:51] I'm so glad that God is mind for us
[50:53] again that he can still move upon the
[50:56] face of the condition. He promised he
[50:58] would do it and call the little flock
[51:01] which would be his bride. Now what are
[51:03] you getting sad about? He promised to do
[51:05] this and he's going to do it. Yes sir.
[51:10] Notice here again now how perfect these
[51:12] church churches type or these Edens. Now
[51:15] watch. God through a seed of his word.
[51:19] And there's only one thing that can
[51:21] quicken the word and that is the spirit.
[51:23] For it is the lifegiver to the word.
[51:27] Now, now here's now here's the mystery
[51:29] here. Now watch. When the life in the
[51:33] word, see, you must be born again. See,
[51:36] otherwise there's a word seed and you
[51:38] will be born again. But if you have the
[51:40] Holy Ghost now and you want to know how
[51:42] to climb, okay, it's right here. if and
[51:45] uh he says um and when the life in the
[51:48] word that's in you down in faith
[51:51] meets the life of the spirit of charity,
[51:55] the Holy Spirit coming down, it produces
[51:58] whatever the seed is.
[52:00] Did you get it? The life in the word.
[52:05] Amen. For this age, look at it. Then the
[52:08] Holy Spirit knows what the life is
[52:11] because the spirit is the word and the
[52:13] word is the spirit.
[52:15] So therefore the life of the spirit can
[52:17] only transform what the life in the seed
[52:19] is.
[52:23] That's all.
[52:24] So they waiting around here for for all
[52:26] these kind of things. They're not going
[52:28] to happen. He's going to transforming
[52:30] according to the life in the sea.
[52:34] When the dynamics fly over there,
[52:36] brother, it'll be according to what life
[52:37] is in that seed. And I know what I put
[52:40] in these seeds there. Adoption time,
[52:43] signs, wonders, miracles. Then that
[52:46] those potentials will be because a
[52:49] transforming power will sweep over.
[52:51] Praise God. And strike that life and
[52:53] that'll come to pass. And you'll see
[52:56] Jesus.
[52:58] Oh, hallelujah.
[53:00] Malachi 4 promise on Satan's Eden. Amen.
[53:05] Did Did you get that now? The life. See,
[53:08] you're sitting there wondering how am I
[53:09] going to get up get up to the top? Well,
[53:12] the Holy Ghost up in the rainbows. When
[53:14] that life breaks in here, see, it's here
[53:16] now, but it's going to go a gusher. Then
[53:18] when that life in the rainbow strikes
[53:20] the life in faith, it begins to
[53:23] transform it.
[53:26] You ain't got anything to do with it.
[53:29] You just follow into his footsteps and
[53:31] where he leads you, that's where you go.
[53:35] And he will send you trials. Praise God.
[53:38] And don't you welch. Say, "I did. I I
[53:41] did it, Lord." Amen. Praise God.
[53:46] The trials are going to come now to try
[53:49] every virtue in you.
[53:53] Oh, I hope you can get that. It's going
[53:55] to try the virtue in you.
[53:57] [Music]
[53:59] So don't try to back up and make
[54:00] excuses.
[54:02] Don't get self-pity spirits.
[54:06] You know, self-pity sit back there and
[54:09] just feel sorry for itself all the time.
[54:13] God can't do nothing for you. Just all
[54:15] time. Well, I don't know why me and
[54:18] Okay. Page 14. Satan's Eden. Having
[54:22] faith in all of his word, his seed
[54:25] brought an Eden of holiness, love, and
[54:28] eternal life. That is what God's Eden
[54:31] produces, holiness. And it brought an
[54:34] Eden of holiness, of love,
[54:37] understanding, perfection, and eternal
[54:40] life. Amen. That is what God is
[54:44] planning.
[54:46] Now, don't tell God that his plans are
[54:49] not going to be complete. because you
[54:51] didn't get the Holy Ghost yet.
[54:54] Because you didn't get healed yet. What
[54:57] kind of prayer are you praying?
[55:00] Lord, fulfill your plan in me.
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:06] Yes, sir.
[55:09] That is what God is planning. His word,
[55:11] his seed. That is what his church will
[55:14] be at the end. It will be the same
[55:17] thing. Yes, sir. Oh, didn't he say that?
[55:21] The three-fold revelation of Jesus
[55:23] Christ. In Christ, the mystery of God
[55:25] revealed. What was the three-fold
[55:26] mystery? Now, God having a preeminence
[55:31] in Christ.
[55:33] Number one. Number two, Christ having a
[55:37] preeminence in the bride for what? To
[55:40] bring her back to Eden.
[55:45] Praise God.
[55:47] Now, here's a thought. Don't forget it.
[55:49] I'll get it to some other time or some
[55:51] other message. But you know, God said,
[55:54] "Let every seed bring forth of his
[55:56] kind." Is that God's commandment? Now,
[55:58] what good is any preacher or anybody
[56:01] else to try to make that word say
[56:04] something else?
[56:07] Catch what I'm saying now? And amen. All
[56:10] these guys that raise up say it won't be
[56:13] that and it won't be this, it won't be
[56:14] that. He said, 'Well, what good is is it
[56:16] for them to do that when his word is a
[56:19] seed?
[56:22] Well, why would these false knowing guys
[56:24] rise up after the pastor plant I mean
[56:26] after the prophet planted the seeds and
[56:28] they rise up against that and say they
[56:30] say you don't need the Holy Ghost like
[56:32] that and there's no more signs and
[56:33] wonders. They don't do it no more like
[56:35] that. He said why would they do that? He
[56:37] said every word is a seed.
[56:40] And these men are trying to change that.
[56:42] Jesus said the so the seed of sold. So
[56:46] if St. Mark 16 is God's word, it will
[56:49] bring forth of its kind.
[56:52] In this age, in this church.
[56:56] Amen.
[56:58] Amen. Brother Lance Lee, how's the
[57:00] Trinidad, man? Praise God. Praise God.
[57:05] Glory.
[57:07] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[57:10] Amen. Every word is a seed of God is a
[57:14] seed. Jesus said so the sewer soul. So
[57:16] if St. Mark 16 is God's word, it will
[57:19] bring forth of his kind. If Malachi 4 is
[57:22] God's word, it will bring forth of its
[57:24] kind. And every other promise must bring
[57:27] forth of his kind.
[57:30] You know what I'm saying? What is Acts
[57:32] 2:38, brother Paul? Repent and be
[57:35] baptized, and you what? You shall
[57:39] you shall
[57:42] hallelujah that's there for eternity
[57:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that
[57:48] will bring forth of his kind in you
[57:52] sir praise God I felt fire on that
[57:56] brother that's a word seed
[58:00] nobody can change it amen you may be
[58:03] seated
[58:05] glory to God. That's what God is
[58:08] planning for his word to see. That's
[58:09] what his church at the end. It be the
[58:12] same thing. Praise God. Amen. If St.
[58:16] Mark 16, St. John 14:12, 14:20,
[58:20] Ephesians 4, 2 Peter 1:4-8, Galatians
[58:24] 5:22 is God's word, then it's a seed.
[58:28] Then it'll bring forth after its kind.
[58:31] Where in this church?
[58:34] you
[58:36] just as sure as Mal God's words see St.
[58:41] Mark uh Malachi 4 St. Luke 17:30,
[58:46] Revelation 10:1-7
[58:49] that brought forth after its kind. Well,
[58:52] so will the rest of these seeds. Praise
[58:55] God that the prophet planted for this
[58:57] bride in the last days. Hallelujah.
[59:00] He'll pour out his spirit upon these
[59:02] seeds and you'll bring forth after your
[59:04] kind. Don't be discouraged tonight. Be
[59:07] encouraged. Praise God. Cuz you're on
[59:10] the verge of the greatest outpouring of
[59:12] the Holy Spirit. Praise God. That the
[59:14] world has seen since the days of the
[59:17] apostles. Oh, hallelujah. Be encouraged
[59:20] tonight. Praise God. Oh, glory.
[59:25] And every other promise must come forth
[59:27] of its kind. Hallelujah. Every seed at
[59:30] this kind will bring forth. Then every
[59:32] seed will come forth at this kind. You
[59:34] may be seated. And that's my inspiration
[59:37] today. Malachi 4 reveal. Amen. that
[59:41] Joseph perfection was the capstone word.
[59:44] I've been over and over and over through
[59:46] that as a fourth light upon the word.
[59:49] Luther was the first, Wesley second,
[59:51] Pentecostal the third, and Joseph was
[59:53] the fourth light upon the word.
[59:56] Therefore, I conclude tonight on this
[59:59] last message here, this eighth message
[1:00:01] before I go take a rest. Therefore, I
[1:00:04] conclude that Joseph perfection capstone
[1:00:06] word is the seed, the time, the age, the
[1:00:10] worry. If that be so, let the same God
[1:00:14] that said, "Let there be light." Let
[1:00:16] that God tonight say, "Let Joseph
[1:00:19] perfection seed come forth after its
[1:00:22] kind."
[1:00:24] Hallelujah. With the potentials in it to
[1:00:28] climb that pyramid tree.
[1:00:31] You may be seated. What kind of a seed
[1:00:33] is Joseph perfection? A perfect type of
[1:00:36] Christ.
[1:00:37] Then what will come forth? A perfect
[1:00:39] type of Christ. I've laid this thing
[1:00:42] down for you. Praise God. For 16 years,
[1:00:46] hallelujah, is going to be every seed of
[1:00:49] its own kind. Yes, sir. Glory.
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:55] Amen. Spoken words, original seed, part
[1:00:59] one, volume three, page 44.
[1:01:02] Yes, Siri. Are you with me?
[1:01:05] Amen. Are you in the word? Glory.
[1:01:10] Now, put her down in your mind now. Put
[1:01:12] down pull down the umbrellas and shake
[1:01:15] the rain off and open up your heart just
[1:01:18] a minute and listen. Remember the Bible
[1:01:20] said in Genesis, the first chapter we we
[1:01:23] read to base our thoughts for the day.
[1:01:25] And so did I. is very is every seed at
[1:01:29] this own kind of nail is down.
[1:01:33] It will have to bring forth after its
[1:01:36] kind. That's right. Every seed will have
[1:01:39] to bring. Remember the earth is full of
[1:01:41] seeds and that the rain makes it bring
[1:01:45] forth after its kind.
[1:01:47] Oh my God. I tell you, I wish you could
[1:01:50] have some faith and to believe that.
[1:01:51] Amen. Well, the Holy Ghost would break
[1:01:54] out all over the place in here. But see,
[1:01:56] condemnation breaks in there and that's
[1:01:58] what holds down the seed. Yes, si. Just
[1:02:02] get that thing off of you. Praise God.
[1:02:05] Be free for once in your life. Praise
[1:02:08] God. No matter what your daughter did,
[1:02:10] what your son or whatever, forget about
[1:02:13] it. Praise God. Between you and God
[1:02:15] anyway.
[1:02:17] So, you might as well might as well be
[1:02:18] free when you come in here.
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:23] Amen. Page 56.
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:26] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:02:29] All right. Every seed must come forth at
[1:02:32] this kind. God made a man in his image
[1:02:34] after his kind to be his word on earth.
[1:02:38] He expressed it in Jesus Christ. What
[1:02:40] was God was in Christ. That's a man
[1:02:43] after his kind. See, when God, which is
[1:02:46] a word, how many know that he's a word?
[1:02:49] When the word was in Christ, a man,
[1:02:51] human man, expressing himself through
[1:02:54] him, that was God, the word in Christ
[1:02:58] expressing himself. And God in the
[1:03:01] beginning made man in his own image. Let
[1:03:04] us make man in our image. And Elohim
[1:03:08] said to the logos, let let us make man
[1:03:11] our image of theophony.
[1:03:14] Praise God. male and female made he
[1:03:17] them.
[1:03:20] Man and woman is one. They don't break
[1:03:22] that. It's God's law.
[1:03:25] Praise God. Don't break it.
[1:03:29] Let no man come between husband and
[1:03:31] wife.
[1:03:33] No man.
[1:03:35] No man,
[1:03:37] no woman,
[1:03:41] no man,
[1:03:43] God to judge that filthy thing
[1:03:46] like it was in the beginning, so shall
[1:03:48] it be an end.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] Glory.
[1:03:56] Amen. And God in the beginning made man
[1:03:58] in his own image. And that's the kind of
[1:04:00] man that God makes today.
[1:04:04] Amen. The seminary and the incubac
[1:04:08] incubator hatchery turns out a bunch of
[1:04:11] hybrids. See the schools. But when God
[1:04:14] calls a man, he's in his own image. The
[1:04:16] word made him alive in him. Now when God
[1:04:19] calls you out of lay out of put you up
[1:04:22] there in them rainbows, that's the kind
[1:04:23] he makes
[1:04:26] right on the chart.
[1:04:28] Call out to lay out a sea of brotherly
[1:04:30] kindness and put in the rainbows as a
[1:04:34] stone.
[1:04:36] That's the kind of man that God makes.
[1:04:38] Praise God. Right in front of you. See
[1:04:40] it?
[1:04:42] Open your open eyes. Praise God.
[1:04:45] Yes, sir.
[1:04:47] Amen. The word made alive in him. That's
[1:04:51] right. There he is. That's God's man.
[1:04:53] Man in his own image, in his very
[1:04:56] likeness. And Jesus said that he'll do
[1:04:58] the works that I do. So God made man in
[1:05:02] his own image after his kind. Now you're
[1:05:05] not going to get the dynamics first.
[1:05:10] Hallelujah. I felt them. Yes, sir.
[1:05:13] You're going to get character.
[1:05:17] Amen. You receive the Holy Ghost. Sure.
[1:05:19] At the bottom, but don't look for those
[1:05:21] great signs and wonders of miracles
[1:05:22] before you form character. Amen. Because
[1:05:25] the power without character is satanic.
[1:05:29] You don't want to go back to a and all
[1:05:31] of them again, do you? Bunch of drunkets
[1:05:33] and whoreongers. Praise God with signs,
[1:05:35] wonders, and miracles. Oh, we don't want
[1:05:37] that. That's why God brought this
[1:05:39] message here. They won't have that
[1:05:41] again. Every seed to be after his own
[1:05:42] kind.
[1:05:45] We have a bunch of Pentecostal mess.
[1:05:47] Praise God. Have a Jesus man, God man
[1:05:51] walking the streets in the 20th century.
[1:05:53] Praise God. Talking like God. Walking
[1:05:55] like God. Praise God. Looking like God.
[1:05:58] Doing like God.
[1:06:00] Amen.
[1:06:01] Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] Yes, sir.
[1:06:07] There he is. God's man may be seated,
[1:06:10] made in his own image, in his very
[1:06:12] likeness. And Jesus said that he'll do
[1:06:14] the works that I do. So God made man in
[1:06:17] his own image after his kind. His kind.
[1:06:21] What is his kind? He is the word. Then
[1:06:25] if a man denies God's word, how can he
[1:06:28] be in God's image? Just ask the
[1:06:31] question. Ask yourself, how can you be
[1:06:33] in God's image and deny God's word?
[1:06:36] See, no way. You see, uh when a word
[1:06:39] expresses is is expressed image of
[1:06:41] himself or he say it doesn't mean that
[1:06:44] expressed image of God. He said yes in
[1:06:47] his own image. is page 57 of his kind to
[1:06:51] be his express word on earth. Now Jesus
[1:06:54] was God's express word. Do you believe
[1:06:57] that? Then what are we to be sons of God
[1:07:00] too with the express word in the church
[1:07:04] carrying on? That's the mystical body of
[1:07:06] Christ carrying on the same work that
[1:07:09] Jesus did when he was here on earth. See
[1:07:12] that's the kind after his kind.
[1:07:18] Let Joseph perfection seed come forth
[1:07:21] after his kind which is a Jesus man.
[1:07:26] Perfect type of Christ for the last
[1:07:27] days.
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. Now this is going to be I
[1:07:33] said in the beginning if you remember a
[1:07:34] seven thunder seed revival.
[1:07:39] That's what I said in the beginning and
[1:07:41] up in Canada for September and October.
[1:07:44] And here's finished. Praise God. And
[1:07:47] something has happened
[1:07:50] and something's going to come forth
[1:07:54] and you're going to pray and water going
[1:07:56] to come down your cheeks and bathe you
[1:07:59] down with revelation that you going to
[1:08:01] be after his kind. Amen. Brother Marcel
[1:08:05] and this room won't be big enough for
[1:08:06] the power. Amen. Brother Marcel said
[1:08:10] that when he got baptized with the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost, there was not enough room for the
[1:08:13] power of God in that came into him. He
[1:08:16] needed more room. He needed a whole open
[1:08:18] field.
[1:08:20] Praise God to run around somewhere.
[1:08:24] The glory to God. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:28] Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] Glory.
[1:08:31] You may be seated. Now you can have the
[1:08:34] luin kind after loofing kind. The
[1:08:37] Methodist kind after the Methodist, the
[1:08:39] Catholic kind after Catholic, the
[1:08:40] Pentecostal kind after its kind, the
[1:08:43] oneness after its, the trinitarian after
[1:08:46] its. But if you're God's kind, that's
[1:08:48] different. See, you are the expressed
[1:08:52] image of the word, making itself
[1:08:56] manifest.
[1:08:57] Oh my, why? It's got to. If watch, if
[1:09:01] the water falls on it, it's got to do
[1:09:04] it.
[1:09:07] Amen.
[1:09:09] Yes, Siri is going to do it. Oh,
[1:09:13] hallelujah. Praise God. Yes, Siri. It'll
[1:09:18] do it. Amen. Praise God. So now, let
[1:09:23] Joseph perfection seed come forth after
[1:09:25] his kind. How? By the transforming power
[1:09:28] of the capstone of love. And let all the
[1:09:30] other seeds to come forth after their
[1:09:32] own kind. Amen. Now, oh my uh why it's
[1:09:36] got to if the water falls on it, it's
[1:09:39] got to do it. Now, you want to start a
[1:09:41] church and we're starting one here. I'm
[1:09:44] talking about a church of the body of
[1:09:45] Christ in there. I'm talking about Amen.
[1:09:47] I ain't talking about this whole three
[1:09:49] kind of believers that's been around
[1:09:50] here for all these years. I'm talking
[1:09:51] about a church.
[1:09:53] We're talking about the word. It's the
[1:09:54] word season. There's going to be a bride
[1:09:57] come out of here. Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:00] Right out of here. A paradox right here
[1:10:03] in Sodom. Praise God. Paradox.
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:10] Yes, sir. Now, page 29 and 30. But if
[1:10:15] you want to uh uh if if you want a
[1:10:18] church, start with the word of God. And
[1:10:21] we started here with the word of God in
[1:10:23] August here. A little new season. And
[1:10:26] we're going to have a church. If you
[1:10:28] want a life of God, start with the word
[1:10:30] of God. Accept the word of God in its
[1:10:33] fullness, every measure of it. Then
[1:10:35] that's and that is the fullness of God
[1:10:37] in you. Then the rain that's falling
[1:10:40] will produce exactly what's in your
[1:10:43] garden. Then now where's your latter
[1:10:46] rain coming up at? Then the works will
[1:10:49] be manifested in him are the same. For
[1:10:53] it is the same seed word of God. God's
[1:10:57] son was the example seed and and what
[1:11:01] his life was when the spirit poured upon
[1:11:05] him after his baptism.
[1:11:08] Remember he returned in power. Well then
[1:11:11] that's the way your life is going to be.
[1:11:16] My God. And he was the example seed. And
[1:11:19] Malachi and the the early bride was
[1:11:21] example church. And Paul was another
[1:11:24] example. And Malachi 4 was the last the
[1:11:27] 20th century example seed. And it's
[1:11:29] coming forth some more example seeds
[1:11:32] from this room tonight.
[1:11:35] Oh hallelujah.
[1:11:37] And now watch. and what his life was
[1:11:41] when the spirit poured upon him after
[1:11:44] his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon
[1:11:46] him. The very life that he produced,
[1:11:50] will that same watering spirit of the
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost which is the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:55] going to water now. Oh, and when the
[1:11:58] life of that Holy Spirit waters, that
[1:12:01] word with the life in it is going to
[1:12:03] transform.
[1:12:05] And when you what you're going to see is
[1:12:07] the same light that's in the gospels.
[1:12:11] That's what you will see.
[1:12:15] I know it's far beyond your intellect,
[1:12:17] brother. But brother, believe it by
[1:12:19] faith.
[1:12:21] Yes, sir. Aspire to it. Be inspired by
[1:12:25] it. I want to be like Jesus. That same
[1:12:29] watering spirit. Did you catch that?
[1:12:33] Not the portion watering the water of
[1:12:35] Luther. Not the water of Wesley, not the
[1:12:38] water of the Pentecostals, but the water
[1:12:39] of the Holy Ghost and rainbows.
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:43] That water, Amen, that's in there will
[1:12:45] pour upon that whole seed cuz the whole
[1:12:47] entire seed is in you.
[1:12:49] Oh my God. Yes, sir.
[1:12:53] Amen. Watering spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] will bring forth the same kind of life
[1:12:58] doing the same thing that he did. If
[1:13:01] it's the same seed, son of God seed will
[1:13:04] bring forth the son of God seed. Now,
[1:13:08] shame on you women with bobbed hair.
[1:13:09] Shame on you preachers denying that the
[1:13:11] truth. Say, "That's all right. Your hair
[1:13:13] has nothing to do with it." But God said
[1:13:14] it did.
[1:13:16] See, see where these guys a million
[1:13:18] miles off. Page page 32. When Now watch.
[1:13:22] When God and his word becomes one,
[1:13:25] hallelujah. Now watch. That's when God
[1:13:30] spirit waters the seed of God.
[1:13:34] Brother Coleman, is that what you're
[1:13:36] trying to do? I've been trying to get to
[1:13:38] the top of that foundation with Joseph
[1:13:41] so that we can can become one with a
[1:13:44] revelation of Joseph perfection. And
[1:13:47] when we can get this church up on Joseph
[1:13:50] and not coexist with Jacob,
[1:13:54] then God's word becomes one. And that's
[1:13:58] when the water waters the sea.
[1:14:02] And that's why I'm preaching this
[1:14:03] message tonight.
[1:14:08] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:14:11] Yes, sir.
[1:14:13] That's when that's what I'm waiting on.
[1:14:15] Amen.
[1:14:17] Praise God. I'll say it again. When God
[1:14:20] and his word becomes one, hallelujah.
[1:14:23] That's when God's spirit waters the seed
[1:14:26] of God. The word of God. It produces
[1:14:30] God. It's not the individual. It's God.
[1:14:33] For what? Now watch. Let's go back to
[1:14:35] last week. You are dead. You are not
[1:14:38] yourself no more. See why I brought it
[1:14:41] in?
[1:14:42] You reckon yourself dead, hollowed out,
[1:14:47] waiting for the seed germ. And don't
[1:14:51] forget the water is in the sea.
[1:14:57] This is a dry word.
[1:15:00] And Jesus descended with the germ in the
[1:15:02] water in the shout
[1:15:05] and poured water up on his entire Bible.
[1:15:08] This Bible grammatized and came alive.
[1:15:12] Because the seed germ descended from
[1:15:14] heaven with a shout
[1:15:18] and a voice of the archangel.
[1:15:20] Will the voice of the archangel be the
[1:15:22] water?
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:25] And you already one with Joseph
[1:15:27] perfection praise God and the voice of
[1:15:29] the archangel
[1:15:31] spouse that water out there. The
[1:15:33] watering spirit will go with you
[1:15:35] everywhere. St. Mark 16:20. And the Lord
[1:15:39] went with them everywhere confirming the
[1:15:43] word.
[1:15:47] Got to be the word. The word. The word.
[1:15:51] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. You see the
[1:15:55] death of a corner wheat. May be seated.
[1:15:59] Hollowed out. Nothing in you. Nothing in
[1:16:01] your mind. Not suspicious about nothing
[1:16:03] about the deacon, the pastor. No
[1:16:05] suspicion. This didn't shake my hand and
[1:16:07] this one didn't do that. Holl it out.
[1:16:09] Dead. Dead to that filth. Don't bring
[1:16:13] that filth in here. Praise God. Dead to
[1:16:16] it. Sister so and so and brother so and
[1:16:18] so. Dead to that. You in a way the one.
[1:16:23] So what if they said it? So what if they
[1:16:25] did it?
[1:16:27] The Lord God giveth and the Lord God
[1:16:29] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[1:16:32] Lord. Sayeth Job.
[1:16:36] The Lord God took your son out, made him
[1:16:39] a drug. Let him be a drug addict. The
[1:16:41] Lord God, let him be a drunken. Blessed
[1:16:44] be the name of the Lord. The Lord giveth
[1:16:46] and the Lord taketh away. And when you
[1:16:48] say amen, then God will bless your home.
[1:16:51] Praise not before.
[1:16:56] Not before,
[1:16:58] not before. So stop brooding about your
[1:17:01] daughter, about your son, your son, or
[1:17:03] whatever, or he'll make the last one
[1:17:05] worse than all of them.
[1:17:09] And you watch that judgment. Praise God.
[1:17:11] So you might as well tonight make up
[1:17:13] your mind. Praise God. Is finished with.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. Praise God. Yes, sir.
[1:17:23] Oh, hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:17:28] It's is that then what uh then uh Amen.
[1:17:31] We're waiting for the seed germ. Then
[1:17:33] what is what is it? It isn't you no
[1:17:35] more. It isn't the man. It's God in the
[1:17:37] man. Is the seed germ like beginning
[1:17:41] spoken word. God's word made manifest in
[1:17:45] the man. Then it isn't the man. It's the
[1:17:48] man that died.
[1:17:51] He died down there in faith. Dead.
[1:17:55] Praise God.
[1:17:56] Holy Ghost come in there. He's rotten.
[1:18:00] Rotten, rotten to his this and rotten to
[1:18:04] this, rotten out to everything. And when
[1:18:06] that man gets up to the top, he is dead.
[1:18:10] And the Holy Spirit goes to the father
[1:18:12] says, "This man's dead here." He says,
[1:18:14] "Uh, uh, put the blood back in there.
[1:18:18] Put the blood of faith and the blood of
[1:18:21] of Irene and the blood of of Martin.
[1:18:23] Blood of Put the Amen. He's been
[1:18:25] inbalmed. Praise God. Amen. Put the
[1:18:29] blood in there. Then the love of God
[1:18:31] comes over that man and there's a
[1:18:33] perfect man. The blood of Jesus comes in
[1:18:35] there. The transfusion too.
[1:18:38] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] Maybe see that man died. He can't be
[1:18:46] hybrid and son of God at the same time.
[1:18:48] He either a son of death or a son of
[1:18:51] life. So if he's a son of death, get it
[1:18:54] over over to the devil and let him kill
[1:18:56] him. That's what I say. Stop brooding
[1:18:59] and trying to hold on to something. If
[1:19:02] if you're snitcher, praise God. Jam
[1:19:05] upside the wall somewhere. Shut up,
[1:19:07] little boy.
[1:19:09] Amen. Stop disrespecting your elders in
[1:19:11] this house here. Straighten your house
[1:19:14] out. Praise God. Speak to your sons or
[1:19:16] whatever. Amen. Don't be afraid of them.
[1:19:19] I know the Bible prophesied that they
[1:19:21] would be your rulers, but you can change
[1:19:23] that
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:27] by being a man of God. Cuz you have
[1:19:29] another scripture tell you to be the man
[1:19:30] in your house.
[1:19:32] Amen. The last days the the the the
[1:19:37] children would be the rulers. Amen. May
[1:19:40] be seated.
[1:19:42] Oh, hallelujah. So if he's a son of
[1:19:44] death, get it over to the devil and let
[1:19:46] him kill. Get it over to God a minute
[1:19:48] and let him kill the devil that's in
[1:19:50] you. Praise God. Run him out. Hollows
[1:19:55] you out. Then let God plan his own life
[1:19:58] in you. Amen. There you are. See why you
[1:20:01] got to die. Get that devil out of you of
[1:20:04] criticism, everything else and gossip.
[1:20:06] Get them devils out of you. Praise God.
[1:20:09] Amen, brother Lance Lee. Yes, sir.
[1:20:13] Kill it. Amen.
[1:20:16] Give it over to God and let and let him
[1:20:18] kill the devil that's in you. Run him
[1:20:20] out. Hollows you out. Then let God plan
[1:20:23] his own life in you. Then it's not you
[1:20:25] no more. It's God's life because it's
[1:20:27] God's word. Watered by the Holy Spirit
[1:20:31] will produce the same thing. You see it?
[1:20:33] I just love to preach on that a few
[1:20:35] minutes.
[1:20:39] My my my You had enough.
[1:20:44] Huh? Are you soaking it up? Praise God.
[1:20:47] Well, amen. There will be a
[1:20:49] manifestation of the God's seed after
[1:20:51] his own kind. Let Joseph perfection come
[1:20:54] forth after his own kind. Amen. On seed
[1:20:56] of discrepancy. Praise God. I'm just
[1:20:58] laying my seeds out here cuz see, I know
[1:21:00] what's going to happen. The rain's going
[1:21:02] to fall, brother. Amen. There's going to
[1:21:04] be a church here. I don't care what the
[1:21:05] unbeliever is saying. Hallelujah. I can
[1:21:08] rest now. I know I can rest now because
[1:21:10] I got to Joseph affection on the top of
[1:21:12] that uh uh platform there. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:15] Page five. And he said the seed of God,
[1:21:18] the word of God, Jesus said in a certain
[1:21:21] place that that the word is a seed and
[1:21:24] every seed will bring forth of its kind.
[1:21:27] Now, if the Christian, the children of
[1:21:29] God, the children of the kingdom has
[1:21:31] become the seed of God. See what I'm
[1:21:34] trying to tell you? When you hit that
[1:21:36] jose of affection, what do you become?
[1:21:38] The seed of God.
[1:21:42] Yeah. I mean you come up through the
[1:21:44] mess you got a revelation that brother
[1:21:46] Brand said the fourth light the word and
[1:21:48] the word is a seed is Joseph perfection
[1:21:51] and you have a revelation that's you
[1:21:53] then you become a seed
[1:21:57] the word for this age
[1:21:59] then when you become one then the water
[1:22:02] falls upon you praise God
[1:22:07] not all this whimpering and why is God
[1:22:09] doing this and why is God doing that and
[1:22:11] crying little babies.
[1:22:15] My God, forget about it. God ain't going
[1:22:18] to do nothing in your life until you
[1:22:19] become the word. Until you accept your
[1:22:22] temptations and your trials that you
[1:22:24] have tonight.
[1:22:27] Accept every trial that you have
[1:22:29] tonight. And then you're on your way.
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:38] Amen. And if I tell you if you lose one
[1:22:40] daughter and I come and tell you what to
[1:22:41] do with the second daughter and you
[1:22:43] don't do it, then you lose the second
[1:22:44] daughter. That's right. But you can
[1:22:46] change that tonight if you want to. I
[1:22:48] already told you not to do that.
[1:22:52] Cuz I'm by discernment telling it to
[1:22:54] you. But I ain't going to tell you that
[1:22:56] I got discernment. I'm just going to
[1:22:57] speak to you cuz you should know I got
[1:22:59] it.
[1:23:04] Therefore, you should trust me. And if
[1:23:07] you don't trust me, you don't get
[1:23:08] nothing.
[1:23:11] Nothing.
[1:23:15] Know it's kind of strong, but that's
[1:23:16] what he said.
[1:23:19] That's what what the prophet said
[1:23:20] anyway. Spoken word original written
[1:23:23] seed book two is in there. He said the
[1:23:24] you can only live by the way the word is
[1:23:26] interpreted to you by the man of God on
[1:23:28] earth. Okay, here we are.
[1:23:32] Now if the Christian the children of God
[1:23:33] to the children of the kingdom has
[1:23:34] become the seed of God then they must be
[1:23:38] the word of God the word of God
[1:23:41] manifested Joseph perfection see the age
[1:23:44] that they are living in for the promised
[1:23:47] seed of that age God gave his word at
[1:23:50] the beginning and each age has had its
[1:23:53] seed its time its promises
[1:23:56] that's why I've been preaching this here
[1:23:57] for all these years oh my you get
[1:24:02] I want to cut off here. I'm tired. The
[1:24:05] word is a seed and every seed will bring
[1:24:06] forth his kind. And if the children of
[1:24:08] the kingdom has become the seed of God,
[1:24:10] then they must be the word of God. The
[1:24:12] word of God manifested in the age that
[1:24:14] they are living in for the promised seed
[1:24:16] of that age. And Malachi 4 said Luther,
[1:24:19] Wesley, Pentecostals, and Joseph
[1:24:21] affection. And Luther was justification.
[1:24:23] Wesley was sanctification. Pentecostals
[1:24:25] the Holy Spirit in the gifts. And Joseph
[1:24:27] affection is what? The capstone word.
[1:24:30] And we become the capstone
[1:24:35] which is Joseph perfection the word.
[1:24:38] We make up the capstone. Do you
[1:24:40] understand that?
[1:24:42] The Lord himself descended with a shout,
[1:24:44] the bread and the prophet laid it out.
[1:24:48] All the mysteries here said that's the
[1:24:49] word. And you accept all of it. You
[1:24:51] become what? The word. And there's
[1:24:54] nowhere else to go but the capstone.
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:24:59] And the word comes first, then the
[1:25:01] spirit comes behind it.
[1:25:05] Then I just read it. Joseph perfection
[1:25:06] capstone word. This is the age of Joseph
[1:25:09] affection. And there's got to be a
[1:25:12] manifestation of the seed word Joseph
[1:25:14] affection. And each age has had its
[1:25:17] seed, its time, his promises. And God
[1:25:20] said our age, Malachi 4, St. Louis
[1:25:22] 17:30, Revelation 10, St. John 14:12. in
[1:25:26] the bride age. Omega. Huh? Is that
[1:25:29] right? Omega. Restoration of the
[1:25:31] original bride tree. And the people of
[1:25:34] that age that manifest that promised
[1:25:36] word is the seed of the age.
[1:25:42] So you don't have to go around showing
[1:25:43] off who you are and whatever. You're
[1:25:45] going to manifest it.
[1:25:47] Oh,
[1:25:49] say nothing just flows out of you. It
[1:25:52] flows like a river. Praise God. I think
[1:25:56] I'm a baritone or something. You know
[1:25:57] what I mean? My God. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:26:00] God. Yes, sir. Amen, brother Joey.
[1:26:03] I might get in your choir, brother Paul.
[1:26:05] Amen. Praise God.
[1:26:09] Amen. The seed of age. Let every seed
[1:26:11] come forth after his own kind. They are
[1:26:13] the children of the kingdom. That's
[1:26:15] right. The manifestation of the Holy
[1:26:17] Spirit, Holy Ghost itself operating
[1:26:21] through his children is those seed of
[1:26:24] the kingdom at that age. So it don't
[1:26:26] matter, brother Lashley. How many in
[1:26:28] Trinidad say they in the message is when
[1:26:31] the Holy Ghost itself picks some seeds
[1:26:34] in Trinidad and pull them out and begin
[1:26:37] to do signs and wonders and miracles
[1:26:40] through that is the children of the
[1:26:41] kingdom in Trinidad.
[1:26:46] in America, in Canada, in Africa, South
[1:26:49] Africa, across the world. That's the
[1:26:51] seed of God. Not what they say.
[1:26:54] Praise God. Hallelujah. That's why I
[1:26:57] ain't never cared what they said. Praise
[1:26:59] God. Having a revelation at the end,
[1:27:01] what was coming forth. Amen. Amen,
[1:27:04] brother Marcel. Hallelujah. Did you get
[1:27:08] that there?
[1:27:09] The manifestation of the Holy Spirit is
[1:27:13] the angel.
[1:27:17] He was the angel that come down with the
[1:27:18] revelation of somehow compassion. That's
[1:27:21] right. That wasn't Joe Cole. That was
[1:27:23] the angel. Down in Georgia and by the
[1:27:27] grace of God, we're going back to
[1:27:28] Georgia next summer.
[1:27:31] Brother Larry Brown, I forgot to tell
[1:27:32] you, he wants to give a meeting and
[1:27:34] getting the the Hilton Hotel in Mon
[1:27:36] already for next July 5th, 6th and 7th,
[1:27:40] 17th year to finish. Going back into
[1:27:43] victory. Hallelujah. You want to go back
[1:27:46] to Georgia?
[1:27:48] Well, brother, I feel like Sherman. I'm
[1:27:50] marching on Georgia. Praise God. Amen. I
[1:27:54] ain't come with no Sherman tank either,
[1:27:55] brother. I'm coming down with a Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost power.
[1:27:59] Yay! Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] Glory. You may be seated. Yes, sir.
[1:28:07] The manifestation, see, that was a
[1:28:09] manifestation of the Holy Spirit was the
[1:28:11] angel that dropped down in 74 trying to
[1:28:13] get the people back to the word. Why?
[1:28:17] Because he can only bless the word.
[1:28:21] So don't get mad at me
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:25] trying to get you a blessing.
[1:28:28] Can't bless with your feelings, what you
[1:28:30] what you think would be right.
[1:28:33] I know it's hard. You can't understand
[1:28:35] me. I know that I can take all that. But
[1:28:38] I know also that he will only bless his
[1:28:40] word.
[1:28:43] Regardless of what you say, what you
[1:28:44] feel.
[1:28:46] Amen. And what are we uh what age are we
[1:28:48] in? Joseph perfection. Oh, amen.
[1:28:52] Every seed will come to a plant or
[1:28:55] harvest. Every seed will come to a
[1:28:57] possession or a manifestation.
[1:29:00] Faith will come to charity. Seed will
[1:29:03] come to fruit. Praise God. Yes, sir. The
[1:29:07] pride will come to Joseph affection
[1:29:09] manifested. How? By his transforming
[1:29:12] power. Praise God. Glory.
[1:29:17] Yes sir. Amen.
[1:29:20] 2 Corinthians 3:18. I got it. But we all
[1:29:22] with open face, beholding as in a glance
[1:29:24] the glory of the Lord or changed into
[1:29:26] the same image from glory from faith
[1:29:30] from glory to virtue, from glory to
[1:29:32] glory to glory to glory to glory.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah. That's how you changed. And
[1:29:37] the life is in the seed. And my God,
[1:29:41] this the life of the spirit coming into
[1:29:44] you connects and transforms that seat up
[1:29:46] to the next step.
[1:29:49] See how it's done.
[1:29:52] But don't forget now charity will be
[1:29:53] here disguised in this church as virtue
[1:29:56] powerful service. The same kind of
[1:29:58] virtue that went out of Jesus.
[1:30:01] Hallelujah. That and they reach for his
[1:30:03] coat and virtue flowed out. That was the
[1:30:05] Holy Ghost. That's the life example seed
[1:30:09] that would be in the church and they
[1:30:10] won't know what's going on. They'll be
[1:30:12] climbing, climbing, climbing, climbing,
[1:30:14] climbing Jacob's ladder.
[1:30:17] Hallelujah. Getting near that boycott.
[1:30:21] Getting near the persecution. And when
[1:30:23] you get to the top, there'll be adopted
[1:30:24] sons to create. Praise God. Speak the
[1:30:28] word.
[1:30:31] Say you can't stop this. Here's a
[1:30:33] revelation that's flowing on and on and
[1:30:34] on and on and on. So don't get filled up
[1:30:37] tonight. There's more to come. Praise
[1:30:38] God. Glory.
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:43] So we behold as in a mirror you're
[1:30:45] changed from glory to glory and there's
[1:30:47] the glory there and when the life in the
[1:30:49] word meets the life of the spirit coming
[1:30:51] in it produces whatever the seed is what
[1:30:53] what you talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:30:55] itself on the top amen comes down with
[1:30:58] little rays coming down through there
[1:31:00] ohoo
[1:31:02] quickening power praise God hey
[1:31:07] the rays are coming all transforming
[1:31:08] power coming all through you get quicken
[1:31:11] oh glory Hey, I couldn't move this hip
[1:31:13] and it got quickened. Amen. Praise God.
[1:31:16] Yes, sir. Amen. That's what I'm talking
[1:31:20] about. I I don't know why I'm I'm
[1:31:22] shouting. I don't feel like shouting.
[1:31:24] That's transforming power. Praise God.
[1:31:29] Amen.
[1:31:31] Yes, sir.
[1:31:33] Amen. See the discrepancy. Page 21. I'm
[1:31:36] going to finish off here. I got this
[1:31:38] far. I'm surprised. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:31:40] Almost finished.
[1:31:41] And this um page 21. Now can't you see
[1:31:45] that the Bible is exactly the word of
[1:31:47] God? He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:31:49] forever. We become watch tabernacles of
[1:31:52] that Holy Spirit which is Christ. See
[1:31:55] that's the real seed. Then if that real
[1:31:59] Holy Ghost them rainbows, Amen. That
[1:32:02] real Holy Ghost gets into the real seed
[1:32:05] of the word down there in faith.
[1:32:08] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. That's
[1:32:11] right. It just won't take part of it.
[1:32:14] See, because the devil uses that. Oh,
[1:32:17] the devil uses 99 and 9/10 of this
[1:32:21] message.
[1:32:23] You got to take the whole thing. Yes,
[1:32:26] sir. Amen. You got to take it all. See,
[1:32:30] every word of because he's not half God.
[1:32:32] He's all God. And that's what takes
[1:32:35] place. Oh, praise God. We become t.
[1:32:39] It'll transform you. Gets in that real
[1:32:42] seed born again of the word. Then then
[1:32:44] if that real Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost
[1:32:46] itself gets in that real seed born again
[1:32:49] of the word, it'll transform you. Be not
[1:32:51] conformed to this world, but be
[1:32:53] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:32:55] mind. Let your imagination be renewed.
[1:32:58] Your your your conscience, your reason,
[1:33:00] your affection, the whole your whole
[1:33:02] spirit renewed.
[1:33:04] Just changed.
[1:33:07] Amen. gone. Evil thoughts gone.
[1:33:13] Glory.
[1:33:15] See, but it must be a real seed in the
[1:33:17] right age in the right time. Amen.
[1:33:20] That's and that's why I say let Joseph
[1:33:22] perfection seed come forth after its
[1:33:24] kind, after his kind by the transforming
[1:33:27] power of the capstone of love, thereby
[1:33:29] conforming ourselves to the image of
[1:33:30] Christ. Every seed after his own kind
[1:33:33] with the potentials and the power in it
[1:33:35] to be what God wants it to be. How do we
[1:33:38] conform ourselves to the image of Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ? And where does the transforming
[1:33:42] power come from in these last days?
[1:33:44] Praise God. Question. How will the bride
[1:33:47] be conformed into the image of Jesus
[1:33:49] Christ with all this darkness and
[1:33:51] unbelief and demon powers upon the
[1:33:53] earth? A Malachi 4 says God will restore
[1:33:56] all things back by the same transforming
[1:33:59] power. Yes, he will. That can take
[1:34:03] something that's nothing and make
[1:34:05] something wonderful out of it. a
[1:34:07] beautiful bride by God's transforming
[1:34:09] power. We find out how it's done. It's
[1:34:12] on the statue of a perfect man. There's
[1:34:14] that's how it's done right there. Praise
[1:34:16] God. Now, in this last great step of
[1:34:19] Joseph, perfection must come into
[1:34:21] perfection. And that Holy Spirit has to
[1:34:23] live in that church right there. See, so
[1:34:26] perfectly it'll make the head and the
[1:34:28] body unite together. What will that
[1:34:30] produce again? on God's provided place
[1:34:33] of worship in California. Page 25, the
[1:34:36] church will come through justification
[1:34:38] through Luther, sanctification through
[1:34:39] Wesley, through the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:41] Ghost or the Pentecostals and now watch
[1:34:43] and go right on into the perfection of
[1:34:45] the son of man which I just recently
[1:34:48] preached on that when husband and wife
[1:34:50] will be the same self persons and God
[1:34:52] will be so manifested see his bride his
[1:34:56] church till they will both be the same
[1:34:58] and that will be the seed of the age.
[1:35:00] children of the kingdom.
[1:35:04] She will be married.
[1:35:07] She will have on the wedding garment.
[1:35:09] Let us be glad and rejoice. We've been
[1:35:11] called to the wedding supper. Oh,
[1:35:14] hallelujah. Called to the resurrection.
[1:35:17] She'll have on the rainbow coat.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:35:23] Both be the same now. See where you at.
[1:35:25] The prophet, see where you at. Amen. See
[1:35:28] church is the word made flesh again. Now
[1:35:31] made flesh. When the word becomes flesh,
[1:35:33] it becomes manifested.
[1:35:36] Like take the word and put it in the
[1:35:38] right position. The right kind of
[1:35:39] ground. It'll bring forth. The seed will
[1:35:42] bring forth after its kind. And the word
[1:35:44] brought into the right kind of a heart.
[1:35:47] It'll manifest itself. It'll bring forth
[1:35:49] the light. It'll break forth upon it.
[1:35:53] And you bring into the right ground. Sea
[1:35:54] of Joseph perfection, light don't break
[1:35:57] forth upon you. Praise God. Oh my.
[1:36:02] God said, "Let there be light." And God
[1:36:04] saw the light that it was good. And God
[1:36:06] divided the light from the darkness. And
[1:36:08] when God sends light, it scatters the
[1:36:10] darkness. So God Elohim spoke through
[1:36:12] Malachi 4 and said in and for our day,
[1:36:15] let Joseph affect your seed come forth
[1:36:17] after his kind. Yes sir. When that light
[1:36:20] breaks out here in this message, praise.
[1:36:22] Watch the all darkness scatter to the
[1:36:24] other side. Signs, wonders, and
[1:36:27] miracles. Jesus in that pride, the
[1:36:29] children of the kingdom manifested for
[1:36:31] that age, the seed of that age in the
[1:36:34] message. Praise God. How come against
[1:36:37] that? Praise God. Manifested.
[1:36:40] And the manifestation of Joseph
[1:36:42] affection will certainly scatter the
[1:36:44] darkness as light did in the beginning
[1:36:46] in Genesis. Once again after Malachi 4
[1:36:49] planted his seeds in the bride. Oh
[1:36:52] hallelujah. Catch me now. Catch me.
[1:36:55] Malachi 4 planted his seeds in the
[1:36:57] bride. And everything seems to be
[1:37:00] without form without it seem to be void.
[1:37:03] Nothing is nothing. Praise God. And
[1:37:05] darkness is upon the earth and gross
[1:37:07] darkness is upon the people. Is this
[1:37:09] correct in the message? Like nothing is
[1:37:12] nothing. I don't feel nothing. But the
[1:37:13] prophet said this shall be light in the
[1:37:15] evening time. I don't care how you feel.
[1:37:18] I don't care what you say.
[1:37:22] I
[1:37:24] praise God. I feel like a caner. Amen.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you,
[1:37:33] Jesus.
[1:37:35] All right.
[1:37:38] Now, here's where we are. You may be
[1:37:39] seated on the fourth seal of page 292. I
[1:37:43] was talking to a person not long ago. He
[1:37:46] was trying to discuss to me and saying,
[1:37:47] "Aren't you ashamed to say that God
[1:37:49] created the heavens and earth in six
[1:37:51] days?" I said, "That's what the Bible
[1:37:53] said." He said, "Well, we got evidence
[1:37:55] can prove that the world is millions of
[1:37:57] years old." I said, "That didn't have
[1:37:59] nothing to do with it. In Genesis 1:1,
[1:38:02] it said in the beginning, God created
[1:38:05] the heavens and the earth." Period. Now,
[1:38:08] the world was without form and void.
[1:38:11] And I said, I believe every seed was
[1:38:14] laying right there from some other
[1:38:17] civilization or something. And as soon
[1:38:20] as the water lifted off and the light
[1:38:23] struck it, up come the trees.
[1:38:28] Hallelujah. And everything come up.
[1:38:31] Hallelujah. The mist rolled away.
[1:38:35] Oh, hallelujah. And right now this misty
[1:38:38] all over you and chaos and void and
[1:38:42] without form and praise God the same
[1:38:45] voice of the archangel is going to speak
[1:38:49] and the mist is going to roll away and
[1:38:52] hallelujah.
[1:38:53] Oh God, brother Junior, I can hardly
[1:38:56] strike it.
[1:38:58] And when I know, hallelujah, up come the
[1:39:02] trees and everything else. Then the
[1:39:04] same, you may be seated. The same thing
[1:39:06] with the human being. It's a time when
[1:39:09] all the mist is moved away and revealed
[1:39:12] truth to that real seed laying there
[1:39:15] still geratized and the light of the
[1:39:18] gospel can strike it. By true
[1:39:20] vindication of the word, it'll live.
[1:39:23] It's got life in it. Outside of that, it
[1:39:26] can't live. It's got no life in it. Them
[1:39:29] names was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:39:31] before the foundation of the world will
[1:39:33] come forth just as certain as anything.
[1:39:35] That's why Jesus sits right there and
[1:39:39] waits with his mediatory work until that
[1:39:42] last seed. He'll know exactly when to
[1:39:45] strike.
[1:39:48] He knows in here when there's strength.
[1:39:50] You may be on your knees. Praise God.
[1:39:53] And feel nothing around you, but you're
[1:39:55] praying, "Lord, I got to be still."
[1:39:57] Hallelujah. Lord, all this chaos and the
[1:40:00] the world's without form and void and
[1:40:03] rumors and rumors of wars and all these
[1:40:05] things going on here. Lord God, I got to
[1:40:08] be sealed and suddenly he'll strike.
[1:40:12] Praise God. in the glory of God, praise
[1:40:14] God, will come into your heart. You'll
[1:40:16] see a white light come into you. Praise
[1:40:19] God. You'll scream. Praise God.
[1:40:22] Hallelujah. May happen to you tonight.
[1:40:27] Oh,
[1:40:28] hallelujah. Praise God. Are you
[1:40:31] understanding?
[1:40:33] Did you catch what I said? Even though
[1:40:35] the bride is in her condition and
[1:40:36] everything seems to be a complete chaos
[1:40:39] tonight, I hear the prophet say, "I will
[1:40:42] restore, sayeth the Lord." Hallelujah. I
[1:40:44] don't care how dark it is in the message
[1:40:47] tonight. I don't care if there's not one
[1:40:49] sign, not one healing, nobody getting
[1:40:51] saved. I don't care without form,
[1:40:53] without void, chaos, filth, misled
[1:40:57] spirits, ungodliness. Hallelujah. Let
[1:41:01] there be light.
[1:41:03] Let Joseph perfection seed come forth
[1:41:05] after its kind. How? By the transforming
[1:41:09] power of the capstone of love. Let that
[1:41:13] come forth. Praise God. Lord God, let me
[1:41:15] hear of the report. This one is sealed
[1:41:18] and that one is sealed. This one is
[1:41:20] healed. And that going on while I'm
[1:41:21] sitting there resting. Praise God. Oh,
[1:41:25] hallelujah.
[1:41:26] I heard a prophecy. I will restore,
[1:41:28] sayeth the Lord. So therefore, I believe
[1:41:30] today that this bride can be transformed
[1:41:32] by the spirit of God moving upon the
[1:41:34] face of the bride and change her, make
[1:41:37] her different from what she is, by the
[1:41:40] transforming power of the capstone of
[1:41:41] love, thereby conforming her to the
[1:41:44] express image of Jesus Christ. Oh, do
[1:41:47] you believe that? Be encouraged. It's
[1:41:49] going to happen. Praise God.
[1:41:52] All right, let's strike our title now
[1:41:55] and go home. Praise God. may be seated.
[1:42:00] Let's strike our title and see how God
[1:42:02] will change the bride for this hour. By
[1:42:06] the transforming power of the capstone
[1:42:08] of love, which is the Holy Spirit
[1:42:09] himself, the spirit of God. Statue of a
[1:42:11] perfect man. I'm finished. Oh my my my.
[1:42:16] Praise God. Hallelujah. Now, Statue of a
[1:42:20] Perfect Man on page six.
[1:42:23] Now, we are approaching a seven seals.
[1:42:26] We just finished the seven church ages.
[1:42:28] And this is a message. Here it is here
[1:42:31] on teaching that ties the man that's
[1:42:35] going to be redeemed by the blood of the
[1:42:39] Lord Jesus. And is going to be in that
[1:42:43] church age, that eternal church age at
[1:42:47] the end of the seals.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah. You want to be in that
[1:42:52] church age? We'll climb that ladder.
[1:42:55] Yes, sir. Okay, now we know we in the
[1:42:58] evening time. Praise God. And we're
[1:43:01] going to finish it off here. So, now
[1:43:03] we're talking. Now, remember, we want we
[1:43:06] we want to be in that eternal church
[1:43:08] age. Now, remember two things here about
[1:43:10] Joseph affection. Uh, number one, Joseph
[1:43:13] affection set on the top part of the
[1:43:16] foundation. You got that? Okay. And and
[1:43:18] then that's where you build or set the
[1:43:20] monument. And the monument is up there
[1:43:23] in them seven rainbows. You got it, huh?
[1:43:26] See, because the red from Paul comes
[1:43:28] right back up from the top of brotherly
[1:43:29] kindness as red, the first rainbow.
[1:43:32] Amen. So there's your faith again.
[1:43:34] Amen. But it comes on top of Joseph
[1:43:37] perfection, the word for this age, the
[1:43:39] capstone.
[1:43:41] Oh, praise God. Now, we're going to
[1:43:44] build or set the monument, the
[1:43:46] masterpiece. Is that correct?
[1:43:48] Okay. Statue of perfect man, page 47.
[1:43:51] Now in building the virtue, building
[1:43:53] this monument.
[1:43:55] Huh? Okay. Building this monument.
[1:43:57] Building this statue. See it starts off
[1:44:00] and the foundation is on faith. Virtue,
[1:44:02] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:44:03] godliness, brotherly kindness. Now what
[1:44:04] does it do? Then they're waiting for the
[1:44:07] headstone which is love. For God is
[1:44:10] love. And he controls. And he is the
[1:44:12] strength of every one of these things.
[1:44:14] That's that transforming power. Oh my
[1:44:17] God. The strength from God. It's going
[1:44:19] to change you. Oh, yes, sir.
[1:44:24] He controls and he's the strength of
[1:44:25] every one of these. Yes, sir. Right in
[1:44:27] here. Right in here. See, I got uh in
[1:44:30] between these works in here. He's got it
[1:44:32] all on the one he had. I saw it years
[1:44:33] ago here. These little waves. He had
[1:44:35] little waves coming down. See what is
[1:44:37] that? The Holy Ghost coming down through
[1:44:40] Christ. Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is
[1:44:44] above all this. Now, he's right there in
[1:44:46] that little slot. See, the Holy Spirit
[1:44:48] is above all this, welding this
[1:44:52] together, building a what? A perfect
[1:44:55] church for the capstone that's on the
[1:44:57] top. Love L O V E to cap off.
[1:45:02] Of course, you know that one is um well,
[1:45:05] we put it this way for you understand
[1:45:06] it. Love the capstone that is the
[1:45:09] heavenly uh uh uh Jesus Christ. Okay?
[1:45:13] And then the rainbows in there, that's
[1:45:15] the earthly Jesus Christ, Mrs. Jesus
[1:45:18] Christ.
[1:45:20] Okay.
[1:45:22] Then the camp comes to Mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:45:24] and they are united
[1:45:27] the body with the spirit because you
[1:45:29] came out of him at Calvary
[1:45:31] [Applause]
[1:45:34] and you come back to him to hit.
[1:45:38] Glory.
[1:45:40] Praise God.
[1:45:43] The Alavansa the Holy Spirit is above
[1:45:46] all this welding us together building a
[1:45:48] what? A perfect church for the capstone
[1:45:50] to camp off. What's it been doing again?
[1:45:53] Is manifested through seven church
[1:45:55] agents and seven church messengers. You
[1:45:58] remember the bride tree? You remember
[1:46:00] the the the sermon on the bride tree?
[1:46:02] They eat it down and they pruned it. It
[1:46:04] would got denominational branches. He
[1:46:06] pruned them off. They raised up another
[1:46:08] church denomination branches. He pruned
[1:46:11] it off. But the heart of the tree kept
[1:46:12] growing. Now watch. In the evening time
[1:46:16] it shall be light. Now there was no
[1:46:18] light in Pentecost. Now you know that
[1:46:20] right in Leodysia. Brother Bram said
[1:46:22] there was nothing. How many knows that?
[1:46:26] On the seven church ages when God showed
[1:46:28] it to him, there was only six little
[1:46:30] pieces of light. But in the seventh age,
[1:46:32] it was total darkness. And Malachi 4
[1:46:35] himself by inspiration drew a little
[1:46:37] piece of light. And that's the bride
[1:46:40] that will come out of there.
[1:46:43] That's why you have got to believe that
[1:46:45] messenger.
[1:46:47] That's the light. Oh yes sir. Yeah.
[1:46:52] Now in the evening time it shall be
[1:46:54] light. That's the light. The Lord
[1:46:56] himself descending with the light.
[1:46:59] That's the light that he put in dark lay
[1:47:01] out of sea. That's the Lord himself. He
[1:47:04] does all three. Amen. So ain't no men or
[1:47:07] man or nothing. It's the Lord in the
[1:47:10] prophet. It's the Lord in the bride.
[1:47:13] It's the Lord in the whole bride. Shout,
[1:47:16] voice, jump.
[1:47:18] Hallelujah. Getting ready for the
[1:47:20] rapture. Hallelujah. Looking around.
[1:47:22] Where's mama? Where's papa? Getting
[1:47:24] everybody together. We're going to take
[1:47:27] Oh, hallelujah. What a glorious time
[1:47:29] it's going to be.
[1:47:31] Yes, sir. Oh, mother eagle going to jump
[1:47:34] down with a great eagle. Pray wings
[1:47:36] spread out there and tell you get up on
[1:47:38] my wing and hook into a promise. Praise
[1:47:40] God. Hook in that into that uh into that
[1:47:44] wing there. That eagle, that feather on
[1:47:46] the wing. Praise God. What a bomb
[1:47:48] shelter we got. Praise God. Can't no H
[1:47:50] bomb even touch you. Praise God.
[1:47:53] The eagle is our bomb shelter. 1
[1:47:55] Thessalonians 4:16 is the bomb shelter.
[1:47:59] And we run into a strong tower and we
[1:48:02] are safe. Let the mountains fall away.
[1:48:05] Let the earthquakes go. Praise God. But
[1:48:08] we are safe in Christ by the
[1:48:10] transforming power of the capstone of
[1:48:12] love. Let Joseph perfection seed come
[1:48:14] forth after his kind express image of
[1:48:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:48:20] Glory. May be seated. Praise God. Amen.
[1:48:24] In the evening time it shall be light.
[1:48:25] That's when comes Christ. Now watch.
[1:48:28] That's when comes Christ. The Holy
[1:48:30] Spirit. Where where's it at? In the
[1:48:32] rainbows.
[1:48:34] Jesus comes down one Thessalonians 4:16
[1:48:37] as a shout. See? Comes down and sets
[1:48:41] himself at the head of the church. Where
[1:48:43] is he at? At the head. And he's still up
[1:48:46] in the heavens. That's that's the the
[1:48:48] cap. That's love. But he he himself, his
[1:48:51] spirit comes down. His person and he is
[1:48:54] seven rainbows, seven spirits, seven
[1:48:56] eyes, seven lamps, seven seven7
[1:49:00] perfection. And he comes down and puts
[1:49:02] himself on top of brotherly kindness
[1:49:04] because he is the head of the church.
[1:49:10] Praise God. So he sets himself at the
[1:49:14] head of the church. Then he will
[1:49:16] resurrect this church being his own
[1:49:18] body. And in there's a body. And the way
[1:49:20] God is expecting us us as individuals to
[1:49:23] grow the way he brought his church in to
[1:49:25] grow. Every church here to become one
[1:49:28] big church. He brought his church up the
[1:49:31] same way he's bringing his people up.
[1:49:32] Then Peter here says first seven things
[1:49:34] I'm almost finished. Faith, virtue, see
[1:49:36] coming up. Knowledge, temperance,
[1:49:37] patience, godliness, brotherly love,
[1:49:39] brotherly kindness, and then the love of
[1:49:41] God. The Holy Ghost. See from that slot,
[1:49:44] the Holy Ghost, Christ in the first son
[1:49:47] of the Holy Ghost, seven perfect spirits
[1:49:51] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[1:49:54] the Holy Ghost. And you got all these
[1:49:57] virtues sealed in you.
[1:49:59] Yes sir. Then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:50:04] called to build a live the living
[1:50:06] tabernacle to live in God's dwelling
[1:50:08] place. Hallelujah. Do you get it now?
[1:50:12] Now what does God do? Then you're
[1:50:14] waiting for the hero which is love of
[1:50:15] God and God is love and he controls. He
[1:50:17] is the strength. All of these things
[1:50:19] here. Oh my. The transforming power of
[1:50:21] the Holy Ghost. And now in the evening
[1:50:23] time he comes down here. Amen. Uh, see
[1:50:27] it shall be light in even times when
[1:50:28] Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down
[1:50:30] and sets himself at the head of the
[1:50:31] church. 1 Thessalonians 4:16, the Lord
[1:50:34] descends and does all three himself.
[1:50:36] Brother Bram said on a rapture tape.
[1:50:38] Amen. A shout. Malachi 4's message of
[1:50:41] bread bringing going forth to gather the
[1:50:44] bride. Gathering the bride together.
[1:50:46] Well, I thought the seven thunders
[1:50:47] gather the bride together. He said the
[1:50:49] shout gather the bride together. It must
[1:50:51] be the same thing. I guess then praise
[1:50:53] God. Amen, brother Lashley. Same thing.
[1:50:56] The rapture says the the shout does it.
[1:50:58] And uh brother Ram said that the on
[1:51:01] under the seventh seal that the thunders
[1:51:02] gathers the bride together. Page 128.
[1:51:05] Huh. Then then is it thunders? The bread
[1:51:08] the shout or what? Praise God.
[1:51:12] My my my all kind of revelations. Huh? A
[1:51:16] shout. Malachi 4's bread message going
[1:51:18] forth to gather the bride. Voice of the
[1:51:20] archangel. What is that? I don't know.
[1:51:22] Trump of God last trumpet. Amen. The
[1:51:25] dead shall rise.
[1:51:27] Where we at? Oh, hallelujah. There. The
[1:51:30] Holy Spirit set between the capstone of
[1:51:32] love and brotherly kindness age. He sets
[1:51:34] the right here tonight. And Joseph
[1:51:36] affection just released him in here.
[1:51:40] [Applause]
[1:51:41] Yes sir. Then then he will resurrect
[1:51:44] this church being his own body after he
[1:51:46] gets this here. See? Add these seven
[1:51:49] verses. Then the love of God, the Holy
[1:51:51] Ghost, Christ and the person of the Holy
[1:51:52] Ghost comes upon you in a true baptism
[1:51:54] of the Holy Ghost. All these virtues
[1:51:56] seal in you. Then God lives in a
[1:51:58] tabernacle called a building living
[1:52:00] tabernacle living in God's dwelling
[1:52:01] place. Amen. Praise God. When a man
[1:52:06] possesses these kind of things, then the
[1:52:08] Holy Ghost comes upon him. Did you get
[1:52:10] it? When a man has faith and and and and
[1:52:12] and and uh virtue and knowledge and
[1:52:14] temperance and patience and God and
[1:52:16] brotherly kindness, then he says here,
[1:52:18] then the Holy Ghost which is between the
[1:52:20] capstone and brotherly kindness, then
[1:52:22] the Holy Ghost comes upon him.
[1:52:26] Hallelujah. Did you get it? Oh, got a
[1:52:30] lot of dying to do, huh? All the little
[1:52:32] weeping over nothing around here. Praise
[1:52:34] God. between you and God.
[1:52:37] No matter, you might speak with tongues.
[1:52:39] You might impersonate gifted God's got
[1:52:41] you. You might do that. But until these
[1:52:43] virtues here go into you, you're still
[1:52:46] off the real true foundation of faith.
[1:52:48] And when these virtues grow in and
[1:52:50] you've added that to that, then you are
[1:52:53] living monument. There's a monument.
[1:52:55] Praise. There's a masterpiece that set
[1:52:57] on top there. Praise. And Joseph is the
[1:52:59] top of the foundation. And put the
[1:53:01] monument right on top of the top of the
[1:53:02] foundation. Hallelujah. a masterpiece.

[1:53:14] are living, moving idol. Praise God.
[1:53:17] When a man possesses these things, then
[1:53:19] the Holy Ghost comes upon him. Praise
[1:53:22] God. But when these virtues grow in,
[1:53:24] Amen. Praise God. You're living monument
[1:53:27] on the top of the Joseph Foundation in
[1:53:29] the holiest of holies.
[1:53:31] Hallelujah. You've gone beyond the
[1:53:33] ribbon veil. You passed the courtyard.

[1:53:38] in the holiest holiest of holies. Amen.
[1:53:41] You praise God. But not know
[1:53:43] impersonation or not in some imaginary
[1:53:46] way. But when we not in imaginary way,
[1:53:48] but prostrate ourselves before a living
[1:53:50] God, a living virtue, a living
[1:53:53] knowledge, a living patience, a living
[1:53:55] godliness, a living power coming by the
[1:53:57] living God. You see, he's in the church.
[1:54:01] Do you understand what I'm saying? Huh?
[1:54:03] Church Joseph perfection releases the
[1:54:09] living God
[1:54:13] in the church, the Holy Ghost itself.
[1:54:19] You get it?

[1:54:24] these things.

[1:54:43] knowledge. Living a living patience, a
[1:54:46] living godliness, a living power coming
[1:54:49] by the living God. Holy Ghost itself
[1:54:52] makes a living man, a living image, the
[1:54:56] statue of God.
[1:54:59] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:55:00] Conform to the express image of Jesus
[1:55:03] Christ. This ain't no fantasy.
[1:55:07] This is your promise for the day.
[1:55:10] Get up out of there. Pray. This is your
[1:55:11] promise.
[1:55:14] Amen.
[1:55:16] Glory to God. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:55:19] statue of God. You may be seated. What's
[1:55:22] he doing? The same thing that Jesus did.
[1:55:25] Walking the same way he walked. doing
[1:55:27] the same things he did because it's not
[1:55:29] an imaginary thing. You got no hope and
[1:55:31] soul. This reality proves it. See what I
[1:55:35] mean? See how these virtues, these
[1:55:36] billing materials typed in with the
[1:55:38] church messenger with the church ages.
[1:55:40] Now, one of these days, we're going to
[1:55:42] take each one of these words and study
[1:55:44] them out and show that it proves this.
[1:55:46] It all goes together. See, he never he
[1:55:49] didn't live past the time to do that.
[1:55:50] Yeah. But maybe some of these men can
[1:55:52] pick these things up and make more sense
[1:55:54] to it. Amen. Praise God and show that it
[1:55:57] proves it. It all goes together. See,
[1:55:59] sure how wonderful that is to sit to to
[1:56:02] see what it does. Now, that is the house
[1:56:05] that God dwells in. Not a building with
[1:56:07] a big bell on top of it and a high
[1:56:09] steeple, but a body has thou prepared
[1:56:12] you. Present your body a living
[1:56:14] sacrifice,
[1:56:16] which is only your reasonable service.
[1:56:19] You ain't doing no big deal. Amen. You
[1:56:22] ain't doing no big deal coming in here
[1:56:24] because you didn't fornicate or
[1:56:26] something and you didn't smoke and
[1:56:27] drink. What big deal are you doing?
[1:56:30] Praise God. Amen. Ain't no big deal
[1:56:33] because you you living after all um I'm
[1:56:36] doing all this for the Lord. You ain't
[1:56:37] doing nothing for the Lord. Praise God.
[1:56:41] God called you in here. Praise God. What
[1:56:45] are you doing for him? He is doing it in
[1:56:47] you.
[1:56:49] You better thank God he's letting you uh
[1:56:51] uh uh uh uh you using uh he is using
[1:56:54] your body.
[1:56:56] To do his work, we ain't doing nothing
[1:56:59] but surrendering.
[1:57:01] Amen. We ain't no big shots.
[1:57:04] A body has thou prepared me. A body that
[1:57:08] God can dwell in, God can walk in, God
[1:57:12] can see in. God can talk in. God can
[1:57:16] work in. Amen. Living instrumentality of
[1:57:20] God. God walking on two feet in you.
[1:57:23] Glory. The footsteps of the righteous is
[1:57:26] ordered of the Lord. God walking in you.
[1:57:30] For you are written epistles read of all
[1:57:31] men. And if the life that's in Christ be
[1:57:34] in you, you will bear the life that
[1:57:36] Christ bore. Praise God. Thank you,
[1:57:40] Jesus.
[1:57:43] Amen.
[1:57:45] Praise God.
[1:57:47] Amen. There's a perfect man of God uh
[1:57:51] musicians when he possesses these
[1:57:53] things. Now remember Jesus purpose in
[1:57:56] descending in one Thessalonians 4:16 the
[1:57:58] shout voice and trump to set himself at
[1:58:01] the head of the church. Number two,
[1:58:03] that's how he does it. That's number
[1:58:05] one. Put at the head of the church and
[1:58:07] then pour all these things into you,
[1:58:09] transform you into a perfect man. Number
[1:58:12] two, what for? Then he will resurrect
[1:58:14] his own church being his own body
[1:58:18] and that's the purpose. Hebrews 11:39
[1:58:22] we pick it up on page 53. And these
[1:58:24] having all these all having obtained a
[1:58:27] good report through faith here good
[1:58:29] report all the ones in Hebrews there
[1:58:31] receive not the promise God having
[1:58:33] provided some better thing for us that
[1:58:35] they without us should not be made
[1:58:37] perfect. Amen. See now you get it. These
[1:58:40] people who died in here are depending
[1:58:43] and waiting on us. So this church age
[1:58:46] has got to come to perfection in order
[1:58:48] to bring the resurrection.
[1:58:52] Do you understand what you're living
[1:58:53] here for? Not just existing. But you're
[1:58:56] living here for a purpose. To be a
[1:58:57] perfect man on this earth to bring that
[1:59:00] resurrection up. Praise. That's what
[1:59:02] you're here for. Don't let nothing deter
[1:59:04] you. Nothing stop you. Praise God.
[1:59:08] Amen.
[1:59:10] to bring resurrection. They under souls
[1:59:12] under the altar waiting for this church
[1:59:13] to come to its perfection. But when
[1:59:16] Christ does come and this church you see
[1:59:18] is coming small in the minority is a
[1:59:20] whole lot sharper than that. But just
[1:59:22] like I right that cross there is see
[1:59:24] it's coming up to a needle point until
[1:59:26] the church in the minority has got to
[1:59:28] get into a place. Can't you see that the
[1:59:31] capstone cannot set even on brotherly
[1:59:34] kindness? Can you see it there? Cuz it
[1:59:37] be something left on the end. So you had
[1:59:40] to take it up a little bit further and
[1:59:41] drop the Holy Ghost in there. Seven
[1:59:42] rainbows to make a perfect fit.
[1:59:46] It won't set on Wesley. It's too wide.
[1:59:50] Do you see it?
[1:59:52] It will only set on them rainbows.
[1:59:57] It won't even set on brotherly kindness.
[1:59:59] Lay out a sea. What are they going to
[2:00:00] sit on that filthy thing for? Bunch of
[2:00:02] churches. Blind, wretched, miserable,
[2:00:04] poor He ain't sitting on there.
[2:00:07] He's pulled out a capstone.
[2:00:12] Yes, sir. Glory.
[2:00:15] You may be seated. You see it. But when
[2:00:18] Christ does come in, this church, you
[2:00:19] see it coming small in the minority.
[2:00:22] It's coming to a needle point through
[2:00:23] the church minority has got to get to a
[2:00:26] place until it's the same kind of a
[2:00:28] ministry that this left because when
[2:00:30] this headstone comes back, it's got a
[2:00:32] pocket here where it's going to sit
[2:00:33] right in there like on a regular
[2:00:35] pyramid. It it just isn't a cap that
[2:00:38] sits across the top. It's a little
[2:00:40] flange. It's got to sit on there because
[2:00:42] it sheds the waters. And when it comes,
[2:00:45] this church has got to be home. And
[2:00:48] there's your honing on seven rainbows.
[2:00:50] That's hone right in there. Them
[2:00:51] thunders is going to hone you in there.
[2:00:54] Praise God. And brother Andrew picked
[2:00:56] that up where I was saying hone, hone,
[2:00:58] hone. And he he's a machinist. And he
[2:01:00] wrote this here. He says reference to
[2:01:03] the honing out of the bride. Hone.
[2:01:05] Honing is a very important facet of the
[2:01:08] metal working industry. A specific
[2:01:10] procedure used for a a specific purpose.
[2:01:13] Honing is a final phase of of creating
[2:01:16] an internal uh uh diameter uh when both
[2:01:21] size and finish quality are of utmost
[2:01:24] importance.
[2:01:26] The first phase is drilling the hole,
[2:01:30] removing the bulk of the material
[2:01:31] quickly. Well, that's fire going right
[2:01:35] down into your soul, brother. Getting
[2:01:37] all that loose junk out of there. Praise
[2:01:38] God. Quickly. Praise God. Baptized with
[2:01:42] fire. Yes, sir. Get all the filth and
[2:01:44] junk out of there. Amen. And right in
[2:01:46] the hole. Amen. And removing only a tiny
[2:01:49] amount of material and achieving a very
[2:01:51] good finish and accuracy of size. Under
[2:01:54] average circumstances, these two phases
[2:01:56] are good enough for commercial work.
[2:01:59] Sometimes a supreme finish. and tight
[2:02:04] tolerances are required. This is when
[2:02:07] honing is performed.
[2:02:09] Special stones
[2:02:12] mounted on an arbor are spun inside and
[2:02:16] the bore in the presence of special
[2:02:19] oils.
[2:02:21] Amen. Removing minute amounts of
[2:02:24] material. The oil flushes out the specks
[2:02:28] of material and cleanses the pores of
[2:02:31] the stones.
[2:02:33] Oh, hallelujah. Send the oil, Lord. Send
[2:02:37] the honing. My God. What a honing. Huh?
[2:02:40] Glory.
[2:02:42] Mirror finishes. You can look like into
[2:02:45] into the mirror of his word. Mirror
[2:02:47] finishes and sizes within the the
[2:02:50] millionth of an inch can be obtained.
[2:02:55] Yes, sir. Now, he said something about
[2:02:57] that on uh he Yes, he did. Here over on
[2:03:01] adoption. Yes, sir. Page 104, I believe
[2:03:04] it was. Yes, sir. Now, he's speaking
[2:03:08] about the uh manifestation, waiting for
[2:03:10] the time, groaning for the time, the
[2:03:11] manifestation uh before the atonement
[2:03:13] was ever made, before the Holy Ghost
[2:03:14] ever poured out, before all the Old
[2:03:16] Testament on down, there couldn't have
[2:03:18] been manifestation.
[2:03:20] It had to wait till this time. Now all
[2:03:23] things has been brought coming shaping
[2:03:25] up to a headstone to a manifestation of
[2:03:28] sons of God coming back in the spirit of
[2:03:31] God coming into these man so perfectly a
[2:03:35] millionth. Amen. Until their ministry
[2:03:38] will be so close like Christ till it
[2:03:41] will join him and his church together
[2:03:44] and there's them rainbows is his
[2:03:46] ministry
[2:03:48] and then that unites with him. Amen.
[2:03:53] Do you understand? Finally, the ministry
[2:03:55] of Christ identified on the earth to
[2:03:59] unite with the headstone.
[2:04:04] That's what joins together. It can't
[2:04:06] join with brotherly kindness as to join
[2:04:08] with them rainbows.
[2:04:10] Amen. Page 106. Amen. You know, the
[2:04:13] pyramid never was capped. Was it? Never
[2:04:16] had a capstone put on it. They never
[2:04:18] couldn't even find it. They don't know
[2:04:20] what ever happened to it. Why? Why
[2:04:22] wasn't the capstone put on the
[2:04:23] headstone, the top of it? Because it was
[2:04:25] rejected when he come. He was a rejected
[2:04:27] stone. That's right. But but but but it
[2:04:30] will be capped. That's right. And then
[2:04:32] those stones, listen, that fit around
[2:04:36] that headstone. Will have to be stones
[2:04:40] that'll be so completely like that
[2:04:42] stone.
[2:04:45] You got to be home.
[2:04:47] [Applause]
[2:04:50] Oh, how that fit around that's pulled
[2:04:53] out of brotherly kindness and fitted
[2:04:55] fitted stones in Ephesians and fitted
[2:04:58] perfectly right into the headstone.
[2:05:01] Brother Jim, you may be the last one to
[2:05:02] be fitted right in there. Praise God.
[2:05:06] You came back for a purpose, brother.
[2:05:08] Yes, sir. God don't make no mistakes.
[2:05:12] Amen. When you going to sing for me?
[2:05:14] Soon. Praise God. Glory. Amen. Brother
[2:05:18] Jimmy's a singer, brother. Yes, sir.
[2:05:21] Amen. Those are the singing Griffin
[2:05:23] boys. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Join these
[2:05:27] stones. And then and then those stones
[2:05:30] that fit around that headstone will have
[2:05:32] to be stones that be so complete like
[2:05:35] that stone. It'll fit it joint
[2:05:39] everywhere. The pyramid is so perfect.
[2:05:42] You can't run a razor blade between
[2:05:44] them. where them stones go together such
[2:05:48] beautiful masonry. Some of them would
[2:05:50] weigh hundreds of tons up in the air and
[2:05:52] so perfectly set together. And can you
[2:05:54] imagine the bride in here so full of
[2:05:56] love we just right together and can't
[2:05:58] nobody can break us. The the devil can't
[2:06:01] phone up on you. Say brother Coleman did
[2:06:03] this and brother S and did that. Jones
[2:06:06] did this here. No. Right right together.
[2:06:08] You fit it right to like this here. Oh
[2:06:12] hallelujah. No more gossip. No more
[2:06:15] filth. No more fornication. No more
[2:06:16] adultery. No more nothing. Praise God.
[2:06:22] Hallelujah.
[2:06:24] Oh, I'm making it right under right
[2:06:26] under the button here. I want to get
[2:06:27] under here about 2 hours and finish it
[2:06:29] off. Page 107. Now, notice then the
[2:06:32] coming of the Lord. Now, what's the
[2:06:33] coming of the Lord? 1 Thessalonians
[2:06:34] 4:16, right? The coming of the Lord
[2:06:37] Jesus is so close to at hand until this.
[2:06:39] Now, don't try to get all this now cuz
[2:06:41] I'm bringing this back. Amen. Just
[2:06:44] receive. And cuz your head is is water
[2:06:47] logged trying to hold it said. Amen.
[2:06:49] See, it's so close. But I got to put it
[2:06:52] on the tape.
[2:06:55] Amen. See, and uh at the hand until the
[2:06:58] spirit from way down in here, just
[2:07:00] barely justification, sanctification,
[2:07:02] baptism, Holy Spirit. And now see, right
[2:07:06] into the time of the coming of the
[2:07:09] headstone, they are again. The church
[2:07:11] has got to be so perfectly perfect
[2:07:13] perfectly like Christ until Christ in
[2:07:16] the And how in the world could you know
[2:07:17] what Christ is like unless the prophet
[2:07:19] brought the word to tell you what he's
[2:07:20] like.
[2:07:22] You couldn't know from Pentecost. Yeah,
[2:07:25] I say unto thee, this sister here, she
[2:07:27] has a lot of money she put in the church
[2:07:29] and she's like Jesus Christ.
[2:07:33] Praise God. What kind of nonsense is
[2:07:35] that?
[2:07:37] Hallelujah. I went to uh Shambach 1960.
[2:07:41] I was just saved. Went up there over in
[2:07:43] Manhattan and all a sudden I heard some
[2:07:46] some little boy say, "Yay, the Lord thy
[2:07:48] God shall bless you if you empty thy
[2:07:49] pockets tonight." I said, "I ain't empty
[2:07:52] my pocket tonight." Praise God. You
[2:07:54] crazy or what? God didn't tell me empty
[2:07:55] my pockets. Praise God. He told me to
[2:07:58] repent. Amen. And live a life. Praise
[2:08:00] God. He don't need my money. Yeah. Some
[2:08:02] some little guy about this big. He
[2:08:03] talking about empty thy pockets tonight.
[2:08:05] The Lord thy God shall bless thee.
[2:08:06] Praise. Forget about it, brother. I was
[2:08:09] so happy, brother. Oh, God. Uh, you
[2:08:13] know, you brothers in Pennsylvania, if
[2:08:14] they going to ask me to say something,
[2:08:15] brother John, you I didn't know what to
[2:08:16] say. You know, you know how it was down
[2:08:17] there in Pennsylvania yesterday. I said,
[2:08:19] if they call me, I got one minute. I
[2:08:22] walk up and say, "Well, God bless you,
[2:08:24] brother, host pastor, and whatever,
[2:08:27] brother Billy, and so forth." I said,
[2:08:29] "Yes, sir. 29 years ago, I staggered
[2:08:31] into the Bram Tabernacle in October."
[2:08:34] And I said, "Oh, I was a poor widow. I
[2:08:36] lost my husband and all I had left was
[2:08:39] just a a little barrel with a little bit
[2:08:41] of meal in it and a oil cruise with a
[2:08:43] little bit of oil. Then I heard the
[2:08:45] voice of the prophet, the thunder of the
[2:08:48] voice of the prophet, thus saith the
[2:08:50] Lord. And do you know what church here
[2:08:52] tonight told me yesterday, I'm still
[2:08:55] eating meal from the barrel. I'm still
[2:08:58] getting oil from the cruise because I
[2:09:01] heard thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:09:05] And the same God that brought forth
[2:09:06] Malachi 4 will bring forth Joseph
[2:09:09] perfection by the transforming power of
[2:09:12] the love of God. And you will be
[2:09:13] conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:16] Each and you be after that kind that
[2:09:18] walked the earth already. Praise God.
[2:09:21] God be praised. Hallelujah. Praise his
[2:09:24] wonderful name.
[2:09:26] Glory. Since you're standing, stand up
[2:09:28] for a while. Praise God. I'm finished.
[2:09:30] The church has got to be so perfectly
[2:09:32] like Christ until Christ and the church
[2:09:33] can unite together. The same spirit and
[2:09:36] there is the same spirit not a birth but
[2:09:39] the Holy Ghost itself.
[2:09:41] The same spirit and the spirit of Christ
[2:09:43] in you. It makes you live the life of
[2:09:44] Christ. Act the life of Christ. Do the
[2:09:46] works of Christ. He that believeth on me
[2:09:48] that works that I do shall do also.
[2:09:50] Jesus said that. Now we going to have we
[2:09:53] got a ministry coming that's just
[2:09:56] exactly like the life of Christ. And
[2:09:58] there it is.
[2:09:59] You see it? That's ministry coming is
[2:10:03] just exactly like the life of Christ.
[2:10:05] What does that ministry identify? The
[2:10:09] coming of the Lord. Well, if Malachi 4
[2:10:12] identified the shout, what will you
[2:10:14] identify in the coming of the Lord? Are
[2:10:17] you going to jump ahead and identify the
[2:10:18] trump or you stay in your position where
[2:10:21] you belong, where the voice of the
[2:10:23] archangel is at? Amen.
[2:10:28] Well, praise God. I guess a few caught
[2:10:31] that one. Amen. It wasn't too many.
[2:10:32] Amen. Praise God. And when this when it
[2:10:36] comes, this church has got to be honed
[2:10:39] and these and the rest of these stones
[2:10:41] in the pyramid are laying so perfect in
[2:10:43] you can't run a raised bay between them.
[2:10:45] Nothing in between them. Nothing come
[2:10:47] between you and I. No more in the word
[2:10:49] age. See, cuz we know what to do from
[2:10:50] Hebrews and so forth to bust those
[2:10:52] spirits that nothing get in between us.
[2:10:56] All the tatlers and busy bodies and the
[2:10:58] sisters who call another sister instead
[2:11:00] of calling the ministry.
[2:11:02] Busted. Praise God. That second sister
[2:11:05] supposed to call the min. No sister, you
[2:11:06] call the ministry. I'm not a minister.
[2:11:08] Praise God. See, but flesh likes to be
[2:11:11] glorified sometime. Oh, yes. I I
[2:11:13] understand. Yeah, men are hard. Yeah, I
[2:11:15] know. They put you down. All that kind
[2:11:16] of stuff. Yeah. Mhm. Praise God.
[2:11:20] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. No, Jesus said,
[2:11:24] "I'm supposed to be your ruler."
[2:11:26] That's what God said anyway. Amen.
[2:11:29] Hallelujah. Well, how we get there, huh?
[2:11:33] My my my
[2:11:35] got to sit there because it sheds the
[2:11:36] waters. And when it comes, the church
[2:11:38] got to be home and the rest of these
[2:11:39] stone. That's right. Okay. Uh uh and how
[2:11:42] they got them up there, I don't know.
[2:11:44] But they were built and up here when the
[2:11:45] pyramid does camp does come the pyramid
[2:11:48] itself the body of Christ will have to
[2:11:50] be honed. See again not only just some
[2:11:53] creed doctrine how could brother Andrew
[2:11:55] bring it in here now. See I'm finished
[2:11:58] so perfectly like Christ till when he
[2:11:59] comes he in that ministry. See there is
[2:12:02] again we'll fit right smack together.
[2:12:05] Then we'll come the rapture and the
[2:12:07] going home. Oh friends we're here. Give
[2:12:11] us a key for I love him. I love him. Do
[2:12:14] you love him? Oh my God. Praise God.
[2:12:20] Yes, sir.
[2:12:22] My God. I hope you got it, friends.
[2:12:28] You want to be a fitted stone? How many
[2:12:30] want to be a fitted stone?
[2:12:32] Glory.
[2:12:34] Malachi 4 identified the shout in 1
[2:12:36] Thessalonians 4:16. What will the bride
[2:12:39] identify? See, now we're going to have
[2:12:42] to We have got a ministry coming that's
[2:12:44] just exactly like the life of Christ. I
[2:12:47] wonder if it will identify the voice of
[2:12:49] the archangel. I don't know. I don't
[2:12:51] know. I just said it. But I do say let
[2:12:54] Joseph perfection seed come forth at
[2:12:56] this kind. And what does that ministry
[2:12:58] identify? One Thessalonians 4:16. Come
[2:13:01] to the Lord. They are church of perfect
[2:13:03] bride.
[2:13:05] Praise God. Will the bride identify the
[2:13:08] voice of the archangel? In the 1
[2:13:09] Thessalonians 4:16, the coming of the
[2:13:11] Lord, I don't know, just a question. But
[2:13:13] I say to you, present your bodies a
[2:13:15] living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to
[2:13:18] God, which is your reasonable service.
[2:13:21] And be not conformed to this world, but
[2:13:23] be transformed by the renewing of your
[2:13:25] mind, that you may prove what is a good,
[2:13:28] acceptable, perfect will of God. The
[2:13:31] statue of a perfect man is the only
[2:13:33] thing that God will accept in this
[2:13:35] rapture hour.
[2:13:37] So we are transformed, changed by the
[2:13:40] transforming power of the capstone of
[2:13:42] love, thereby conforming ourselves to be
[2:13:45] the express image of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:48] Remember how it's done. Second Peter
[2:13:50] 1:4-8, the statue of a perfect man.
[2:13:53] Page 65 here, it's a last quote.
[2:13:57] Add to your faith virtue. Add to your
[2:14:00] virtue knowledge to your knowledge
[2:14:02] temperance to your temperance. patience
[2:14:05] to your patience godliness to your
[2:14:07] godliness brotherly love to your
[2:14:08] brotherly love the Holy Spirit I think
[2:14:11] you all understand it now and Christ
[2:14:15] will come the Holy Spirit comes first
[2:14:17] and then Christ comes because just
[2:14:19] beneath him the Holy Spirit beneath him
[2:14:22] is the spirit of Christ into the
[2:14:24] churches see Christ the baptism went
[2:14:27] into Ephesus amener and Pergamus and so
[2:14:31] forth each went in there spirit of
[2:14:34] Christ, but he's beneath the Holy
[2:14:36] Spirit.
[2:14:38] He This is I'm talking about one uh
[2:14:40] Corinthians 12:13. By one spirit, we all
[2:14:43] baptized into one body. That was beneath
[2:14:45] the Holy Spirit itself.
[2:14:49] You see right in front of you, huh?
[2:14:51] And Christ will come because just
[2:14:53] beneath him, the Holy Spirit is the
[2:14:54] spirit of Jesus Christ into the church
[2:14:56] to manifest those virtues.
[2:15:00] I
[2:15:02] love him.
[2:15:06] Glory.
[2:15:08] I
[2:15:10] love him
[2:15:14] because
