TRANSCRIPT
========================================
June 1943 the Ohio River Jeffersonville Indiana william branham a humble Kentucky born gospel preacher was baptizing his converts in the name of Jesus Christ when a light appeared from the sky and hanging overhead witnessed by many hundreds of people a voice spoke out saying as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your ministry will forerun his second coming he was indeed the voice of one crying in a modern wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and make his paths straight his simple Christian message called even those professing Christianity to repentance pointing back to the Bible as the infallible Word of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the very cornerstone of the Christian faith deed baptized you with water to repentance but that comes one H&E whose shoes I am not worthy to bear heel baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire his fan is in his hand William Brennan not only preached but also demonstrated the power of God as he traveled across America and around the world performing great miracles and healings whether it was before royalty or mass gatherings were African natives solo the gospel is demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit avoiding the nation's they say now we don't want missionaries we know more about it than you do but the thing we want to see is somebody that's got faith enough to make God's Word manifest that's what they want to see an Indian boy who's crippled leg grew to full size in the audience one such incident seen on stage thirty thousand to force a caller and give their heart to Christ maybe I could submit myself to him and he would do something through me that would make you loving more and believe him in the heel that's the granddaughter of Florence Nightingale who was healed of cancer seen here before and after William Branham flew to England to pray for a little boy raised from the dead after a fatal road accident in Finland the incident having been foretold in a vision many years earlier this child is suffering it's been turned down with the doctors to die it's leukemia isn't that right bring the child to me little sister dear the Lord Jesus was here he laid hands upon you and death will leave you and your live do you believe [Music] come out of the child Satan by the authority of God Bible with a divine gift ministered by an angel our journey to leave the child it is reported that never was a child prayed for by William Brennan that was not healed in fact two testimonies of divine healing throughout the world are innumerable and these alongside a multitude of supernatural signs and wonders leave little excuse for the skepticism of modern man look why didn't the world realize that picture there why doesn't it catch that right we want to catch these other things want to catch these prophecies and think you know they can't do it no no but one day I'm going to leave the world and when I leave then they'll recognize it some of you young people realize that after I'm gone on the 19th of December 1965 came the devastating news that William branham's family car had been involved in a head-on collision with a car driven by a drunken driver amidst the terrible wreckage this 20th century profit still retained the power of God in such a way that his hands laid upon his mortally injured wife Meador caused her to be healed but he could not heal himself the gift was for others she was taken to be with the Lord that Christmas Eve leaving behind him a message nearly 1400 sermons that had been recorded on magnetic tape on those tapes he said was a love letter written between the lines to the endtime Church the bride of Jesus Christ [Music] and while we have seen what we have seen these promises in these lazy's what we have seen ourselves ought to put each one of us in action it should make a church they would make a revival here in Phoenix that people be flying in from Europe to see what they can play let's say there's something broke out that I tell the seven thunders of Revelation stand is not even wrote in the Bible is being benefited the power of God they can time here thank the Lord for these books and take center high speed on John the King does indicate what everybody was saying you know nobody knew what to do these man if they pick up this he goes out with it they can make more sense to it so you to bring it to appreciate I just want to lay this feat they're all they make it come to life so what do you say praise God I'm a prophet little message stop sense and the inspiration gives young man like a pastor here let's call them as I'm beginning to know that my days are numbered and the work now that these young man can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come and my generation which I'm hoping to see of it daily for him watch keeping myself prepared for that hour [Music] you were speaking about there'll be some standing here which shall not taste of death until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom paragraph 130 after Peters rock confession which we know that his confession is he would build his church upon on this same rock not Peter being a little stoned as a Roman Catholic tries to say it but Peters confession of the revelation so maybe this will understand give you a little insight into my ministry and the New York City Church this church is built upon a confession of the revelation of Jesus Christ as revealed by Malecha not one voice voice is plural to the seven spirits [Music] [Music] good to see you bloody sister [Music] stomach is saying thank you lord [Music] everybody can't be a preacher but you can avoid it if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're going to the pulpit to preach you're still a preacher the bamboo rejected say no one can put a finger on his or her life I want to face what I was saying on this quote in these scriptures dear God we see the handwriting on the wall reacting in time we know that there is great things laying ahead but yet somewhere some way out in this mess out here there's still honest people that's been ordained to length it would be impossible for one man or two man but God all of us together let us spread in every corner we can the good news that Jesus is coming just spread our little bread alone a little worried wherever the Eagles are they'll follow that food whether it comes by taint or whether it comes by a word or a testimony and I like to say here my own personal conviction is that whether it comes by tape I would say the voice of God recordings as long as this venture as it is undertaken by Joseph Brennan brother Rams son and he's in charge of the voice recordings the voice of God recordings and whether it comes by word and we understand there's a written word and is the reveals spoken word and we're so thankful that we have received the reveal spoken word for this generation from the Prophet Malachi or so whether it comes by tape or whether it comes by a word or a testimony Eagles will follow it to his headquarters for it is written where the carcass is there the Eagles will gather there Jesus we know that thou art a carcass that we eat without the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we pray God that when we scatter the word by worried by voice by testimony when we scatter the word that the Eagles will find it - the way they do it at Jefferson building [Applause] so December 30th 1962 brother Ben preached at memorial message serves is this the time that titling itself speaks volumes for we went to I know I in particular with questions on my heart did we start this church for the people what do we do and so his title serves at the time of course speaking about seven angels and seven seals and all these things that we didn't even know anything about and so they're sitting there with these questions pondering in my heart on that memorial message needless to say I didn't know what he was even talking about and sealed on the backside and the written seals it was all Greek to me and what I know this that night after he finished preaching God spoke to my heart again I say by revelation when you return back to New York City start to church 20 years the first that's the first wedding camp of my brother's home we're the first couple he ever married 19 years old she was my only girl none of my family came to the wedding it's enough they were made because we followed the Brenin they're coming for seven mysterious buggers it's not even written at all and I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days an order that gets a bride together for rapture and Facebook there's something we've got the stepfather we we can't have that favor divine healing harness to be changed in a moment and we had a little Walt on 35th Street one block north of the Empire State Building and there in June we came outside and the younger sister look up in the sky and seen this huge beautiful white cross in this guy that was over the Empire State Building and here's the original photo which appeared September 21st 1964 in the newspaper and I might add that it has a caption a time for reflection so we took the picture and we sent it to brother Branham he wrote his letter back and told us that it was a sign of the intact and in the fate magazine April 1951 was a quite an unusual story one day last summer construction men were working on the top of the Empire State tall building tower 1467 feet above the street preparing to put up a new television mast suddenly something struck the cheek on one of the men then another reaching to his shirt-collar and picked out a grain of something of Honor or other he looked at it in in puzzlement then flung it aside then other men began to notice the kernels falling upon them while they looked in bewilderment nearly a peck of grain fell upon them in this tongue their faces and next and bounced off the steel floor where was it coming from they heard no airplanes over nor did they see any there was no wind or storm though the sky was overcast meanwhile the grain continued to fall tenants along the north side of the villain herder Alan against it windows samples of the grain were taken to dr. Michael Laurel of Fisher chemists of the produce exchange what dinner fighted as barley I believe it was five loaves of barley and two little fishes that our Lord fed the multitudes so we thank God for the barley a revelation of Malachi for seven seals seven thunders and this little scientists fell the north side of the apostate villain where we gathered from 1964 to 1972 bless you brother how are you okay and Harris you go to go directly to the pit Harris Motor Inn they come from the east and west they come from the land far to feast with our King Evans [Music] [Music] [Music] crêpiness then have the same one mind one Accord I know if it's an infamous eccentric and I believe the love of God is going to come down here yeah another edition man feeling there's going to be a filling over saying if you meant to sell exactly a refilling the people will leave it is such a love [Music] [Music] and now November 10 1964 again going back to revelation to brother hunt and I are concerning Elijah revelation when they start to church now we need revelation with the preach so there was brother Branham preaching perfection and and unveiling the mighty God and in seven angels thunders we saw what do you preach and November 10 1964 the hallways burials going down to Korea Tuesday afternoon it was wasn't my day off as a mailman just so long that go and talk to the Lord and as I was coming up the steps on 35th Street one block north of the Empire State Building and burdened down with different interpretations and different ministers that would preach in a church and I knew there had to be one voice and one inspiration and the Lord spoke to my heart these words Jacob grace Joseph's perfection and then went up to pray I was stopped along the steps and I wrote it down on a newspaper then I went upstairs to pray open the building up then went to the altar and there the Holy Spirit poured out scriptures and and there was no spoken word most of the time and and different Quotes we'd say of things that have heard on the tapes and then the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart and said here the masterpiece which was just preached that year so there he said Jacob grace Joseph's affection but first here the masterpiece I went home and heard the masterpiece and seeing the foundation was indeed Abraham faith and Isaac love and Jacob grace and Joseph perfection so that is the foundation of this church is built on and on top of it we know we'll be seven virtues seven thunders Jesus Christ will be formed [Music] and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in and that brings the face of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the vapors of Jesus Christ [Applause] you're Peters of foundation all right amen so then 1972 we bought a church and clothes for in August and October 23rd something terrible happen the church was firebombed and we know was Satan using certain individuals yeah young people in the area and what it was the Methodist Church could not cope with these young people who were using going under the steps to use it for to shoot drugs and they were minutes to the neighborhood and the people were afraid of them the scripture said it would be our pressors and so the Methodists United the church sold it to us at a very good price and took the mulch bag back and gave it to us then we found out why they couldn't handle these young people so we took it over in August and we noticed them they'd come by and look at us and each other like perhaps maybe try to frighten us or scares and we just went on repairing and painting and getting ready and we had a dedication August and August September October 23rd that night the church was firebombed and it went into radio television newspapers everywhere not give a member in particular one that the TV news commentators asking me directly I signed a bill and how do I feel about this and on a1 the person that did this I said well sir sir so I'll feel better if I could find out who he is I would love nothing more than lead him to the altar inside and and what he didn't could do is he'll give his heart to the Lord and he said my that's an awful lot of compassion I'd say so that's what it's all about forgiveness of man and his sins [Music] yeah because my hand my cause it's my piece loser can't do the things that we did [Music] I'm here for that person I'm here for something you know for my family in order to be able to see Christ and me a picture on the charity is our burning bush coming down I want now now's the time and you go and the people with and most to do them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what many questions have have arisen oh are you prophets or the Apostles or who are you and what is your title well that we know brother Browns message I'm a pastor the New York City Church and the prophet of God Himself said on a Philadelphian Church age he says that speaking about the wise and foolish version she says the wise virgins will have wisdom of Revelation to catch that open door that got put down between Wesley in Laodicea and that opened doors Jesus Christ and so it takes a wisdom from heaven as wisdom come down to Peter Rock a revelation to catch that door the door is the door one Holy Ghost baptism is another one some people it is difficult for them to go the word is there is preaching there is this money you know it is one to wait to see ya because we know that is a verse for us and the time is the easier is preached so are you a believer yes [Music] the invitation to roll around the fellas all the rich and poor that's why here's the kingdom of God no sweet guys are little guys they're all one guy all wanna cry so please God my brothers and sisters or whoever that wherever this tape will go to may God richly bless you and for taking our time to listen to my testimony this is my testimony we have for cystic home and my family and the elders and the Deacons and and all the believers in New York City or whatever we can do for the people we try to do it and so may God richly bless you and always remember to pray for us in New York City because it is a rough place where God put us here and we shall remain to the end as a witness of the entire message of Malachi for not a man but God himself bail behind humans in speaking his promises out to his children which is a good man and I feel like Caleb and Amen come on Brandon we are more than able to take the land because God gave it to us the pen Harris conference center 1986 when I got a revelation I was in the chicken barnyard but I was illegal I found me a place to jump in the water a man who was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ went back in baptized my wife and my mother-in-law something begin to turn on the inside even without a prophet a man there would be no scream over the barn yo so he was an Eagle heard that scream every little fiber in his body be good to move he recognized that scream there was a part of him it wasn't his blood it wasn't his soul that's something within you that goes way back a foundation of the world being like he wanted to be failing in there screaming eagle took one look in the sky and he saw the ministry of Malachi fools you're going to meet your mind sounds real I'm gonna get out this make a jump I can't just I'm not gonna wait to sup I'm gonna use my faith to cause something to happen do you know we're trying to do something mmm the bread of Jesus Christ has a purpose on earth today [Music] Lord God let me do all I can to make this a conference let it start at me and that each one in here praise God will say Lord Lord let it start in me each one praise God step out of your flesh you know what faith includes you and then you know that's when the people back up you know everybody knew that God could slay Goliath well when God said I want to want to use one of you to go out and meet him Oh mine that was different brother branham don't worry we've taken care of this thing we'll bring your message to Pop's it shall not return void brother branham the bride should be about her father's business vindicating these things stepping out and being healed in seal and telling the church Malachi 4 brought a message and I am that message it is in me become they get me oh praise God Malachi boss promised as prophecy has come true Leah [Music] and I got a great big hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayeth the Lord but master he's gone charities here [Music] you realize where he is and go out to meet him all he can do is cry your head and you will respond back because your egos and that Malachi fours message is in you the life is in the scene and when the life in charity which is here now whole ring over here meets the length of the sea that's in you the life in the spirit meets the life in the word it transforms and change his head God's gonna come in you and he's gonna manifest the word that he already put in your heart he's gonna set it on fire he's going to set you on fire you're gonna be a living testimony you're gonna be a walking talking Bible you're gonna be oh thank God for the word inside that the voice my echo from the word has already in you uttering seven thundering voices go to that age don't be afraid it's a manifestation of the Holy Spirit that was released by the Prophet for your day it wasn't broke Lama says something that has good faith I don't know a common dough Branham says seven thunders good faith dobra Brennan said seventy the brass Reviva the governor says soon Thomas is please go we got a bride wake up and be nurturing Grace Church upon the bride in the book of revelations of the ten he himself the Lord Himself you need a revelation you don't know who Christ is you said know who Christ is you don't know because if you know he [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present price a beloved bride of virgins a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfil all that has been promised for his word in the virgin the believers returning to their homes around the world carry in their hearts a treasure beyond anything that the world can offer for as Jesus said he that receives a profit in the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward [Music] having received the light of this entire message each one in turn is ready to become the light of the world in their day to shine out the fullness of Christ to a lost and dying generation [Music] [Applause] so whatever it is but of course the young person who's thinking about trying the world was thinking about going out there and and he's not a hundred percent convinced that it's going to him any harm like my son said yes it's it's terrible I I know it before you're gonna lay things and you think it looks nice and that's the way it always does everything he makes everything look so nice and so creamy and so ice creamy and really it's just like my father said garbage wood paper on top you know and when you get to the bottom of it it's all garbage and it's just a lure of st. and but anyway we started getting all the different things and before you know it we were involved with drugs and there was even I think through some of there's a large chain of people and it was a bank robbery one of my close friends was involved with that and there was killings going on and and it got to a point where around this particular gentleman had such large overhead of lawyers fees for getting arrested that uh he started he started he had connections to get straight cocaine but non-cut cocaine from a friend he thought this elephant big and he wanted us to be his carriers and it was very dangerous when you were in the world in the world can be extremely dangerous and it was life and death that was touching them it kind of grew and grew that worse and worse until point where my boy I was said to be pointy when he in the church and I always had a respect for brother Coleman my God's people my parents it's just something that I wanted to do a whole sudden I realized I was deep in I couldn't get out and I got worse and worse and if you never forget brother Brandon's message my grandfather have probably heard every tape two or three times and I had grown up to know and love brother grams voice and his message and it just comes back to you it was back he said well this man could come the they're hired hitmen they have murderers who would think nothing of wiping out the entire family especially if they think you know something that they don't want anybody to know once you're part of them they don't want to let you go didn't want you to leap alive and I remember the message and their word and I've killed me what I was doing you know support getting into it where I was supplying other people drugs and that I started to take the drugs heavily and I got to a point where I didn't care about anything or anybody just to kind of hurt us to get hurt because Timothy was out there for quite some time and even some had made the remark well what about Timothy I thought you spoke two words for Timothy whatever happened determining is this was said over and over again while it's seemingly nothing once taking place when it seemed like Timothy was still out in the world and wasn't gonna come back its but packet remember when I was in the world and I wanted I wanted to stay in the world other keep keep my demons and nice to see brother : I said should I run the other way you know there's such a presence of God about him then and when he prays that the demons gotta go I thank God that to have a man that has done item like that and the lives the life and has a real burden for the people you could never convince me that a situation is hopeless because if there was a hopeless situation this was this was it but God spoke to ward and I believe it's an example for all other cases that we come that for parent or their lost loved one or for a young person to see is there a hole is there a possibility is there a way back can it break day can we reach the mountaintop can we get out of it these are the hopeless is it impossible or can God deliver can God well this is the example this is living proof of what God can do if you could just hold on and trust him if you believe in any people even that there's a word the word of God and the Word of God it was spoken by Malachi of four and whether it be for the coma or any Minister can get up there by faith and take the scriptures and take the revealed Word of God but when your friend and speak the word he taught us to speak the word he said why Christ speaking more fall and he said all these scriptures in the Bible are ours if we would take thee not just a power but the authority that God gives us as sons and daughters of God and we would stand on God's Word believing on God's Word and quoting God's Word he's speaking the word I'm just standing there there's nothing else that we have to do baba says having done all to stand stand and that's all we have to do is stand it's God's job he spoke the word it's his spoken word and he's the one that must come behind that work and bring it to pass I had been going to a chiropractor and she had taken x-rays of my back and one of the experts showed that what they call a degenerated this what she means was disintegrating she said she could not help me only to a certain extent and in that it would always be that way there's nothing I could do so my pastor brother Coleman he prayed and he spoke the word over my back and I remember the words he used was my every bone go back into place and now here is the disc which you see flown vibrant in the other x-ray you can see it showed this area here was completely disintegrated on an angle and now you can see here that is a it's full and vibrant before lifetime there's nothing they could do to restore that disc absolutely they would only take that fact she said it would take a miracle now that I remember she said it would take a miracle and that's that's exactly what happened Oh God again I did what he did earlier with the Prophet and praying and actually something it wasn't there was there the doctor the one doctor said that every bone and the vertebrae was out of place every way that my back was supposed to curve it went the opposite way and it was completely straight and the disc that was not there was completely home I had my back leg towards wishes you view the x-ray when I turn around I was shocked because you saw the x-ray the bone the back bone was straight up and was oh look my anointed glow and white it was beautiful look like the Empire State though there has straight correct and I begin to get a revelation that God is a pen begin to get a revelation of God as a father and how God wants so much for us and we can't even imagine if I as a natural father we want a blessing for my son and I'm only thinking of a little natural blessing so to speak as compared to what God wants for us I begin to get a revelation that day I begin again to get a revelation of God's suffering when we drift from him and and drift for perfection not even backslide but just here from perfection that what he really wants to give us [Music] [Applause] [Music] I pledged this morning to him with all my heart by his help and by his dream pray that I'll seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little statue on July to be a manifestation of the living we just finished service and brother came downstairs and and he began to cry out and I began to cry out also that was the night that God fill me with the Holy Ghost and I'll never forget that night because God had to pin to the floor for three hours and he brought him to me something that I've never experienced before I was like a power beyond any natural feeling and I really felt something changed inside my soul up to that time and since I was born I've been in the church and mentor many meetings and I consider myself a Christian but but till there and that had a real experience where you can feel the college's go through you and that's what happened on September the 4th then your whole life takes on a new meaning and you know you know where you're standing I know that he filled before reason didn't just fill me to stand around and not share my testimony with anyone I can't just tell me to not pray for my family but he firmly for music and I'd like to do all their dog had me do to help somebody and the compassion and love they had for me has really rubbed off and if any Harris in the meetings you just like you feel like that's such a mighty feeling in the Holy Ghost it's just no words to express what means to me my life [Music] [Music] into your heart then when you do raise up your hands and thousands are so tiny large because I'm so grateful that you didn't survive during the Holy Spirit you'll feel the power of God surged through your body you'll be a different person from that little testimony as to whether Joelle when he was testifying Lord how the Lord the Holy Spirit came down and what it is is the Lord has done so much the devil has been fighting joelle other ones and trying to drag them back into the world yeah New York's an ironic place to live in this so much that Satan has so so to speak to orphan but I believe the Lord has presented them something that is so far better and it's starting to hit them one by one that they have something so much greater something that will hold them away from the devil the devil will come knocking at the door but I believe these children know now that they have something in them greater than what the devil can ohon so as the Holy Spirit fell down you know like you can see and what it is it's such a deep meaning to each and every one of them how God has literally dragged them out of the world drugs at a sex out of you'll put them here as a clean vessel ready to be used ready to be filled with the Holy Ghost ready to go out me and sweep out to their friends and their relatives and perhaps some of them still have brothers and sisters and they do out there and drugs and everything else and they know now if God could do it for them God's going to do it for their brothers and sisters so we just wanted to say that that I realize how the devil had brought these before the pen Harris meetings and how almost that close but he came right down that mother Eagle come down yeah Ava screaming these young people realize my god I'm a predestinated seed of God yes I belong to God I always did belong to God and that's the Spirit of God that we felt [Music] amidst the glittering lights of the end time the world stumbles on through a mirage of progress towards her inevitable destruction in a generation where children are weaned on fantasies of monsters and demons the people are being prepared for tribulation and insanity but by the grace of God to those who have believed the prophets message there is a people that is being prepared by the Word of God for the second coming of the Lord [Music] [Music] but the clock of life is whelmed at once and no one has the power to say just when the hand will stop at late or early hour now was the only time we owned to do his precious will do not wait until tomorrow the clock may then be still they just said it one more time left at all you know and it's just such a little time to serve God and to to get back into the kingdom of God and I said to myself I was there praying to God I said Lois I began to get a revelation of his mercy to put me in the Browns message will we be without for the van's message and a word of God for a rapture and to be in the Church of the Living God come Lord Jesus catch away your church and if it be your will Lord just before that church is raptured made our rods power Oh God fill these messes raisin this world once more
