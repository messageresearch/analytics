[0:23] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[0:25] lion roarth.
[0:27] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[0:30] uttered their voices. And when the seven
[0:32] thunders had uttered their voices, I was
[0:34] about to write. And I heard a voice from
[0:37] heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those
[0:40] things which the seven thunders uttered,
[0:42] and write them not,
[0:52] according as his divine power hath given
[0:54] unto us all things that pertain unto
[0:56] life and godliness, through the
[0:58] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[1:00] glory and virtue, whereby are given unto
[1:03] us exceeding great and precious
[1:05] promises, that by these ye might be
[1:07] partakers of the divine nature, having
[1:10] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:12] world through lust.
[1:14] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[1:17] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[1:21] knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance,
[1:24] and to temperance patience, and to
[1:27] patience godliness, and to godliness
[1:30] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[1:33] kindness charity.
[1:36] For if these things be in you and
[1:38] abound, they make you that ye shall
[1:41] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:43] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:52] The other angels were messengers, man of
[1:54] the earth. But this angel, these said to
[1:56] the angel of the church of Lady Aia, to
[1:59] the angel of the church of Ephesus,
[2:01] messengers of the earth. see man,
[2:06] messengers, prophets, and so forth to
[2:08] the church. But this one didn't come
[2:10] from the earth. He come down from
[2:12] heaven.
[2:13] Amen.
[2:13] Because the mysteries all finished. And
[2:16] when the mysteries finished, the angel
[2:17] said, "Time shall be no more." And seven
[2:19] thunders stole their voices out.
[2:23] What if it is something to let us know
[2:25] how to enter in to the rapture and
[2:27] faith?
[2:29] Is it?
[2:31] Will we run leap over walls?
[2:35] Is there something fixing to happen?
[2:37] These old marred, vile bodies are going
[2:39] to be changed.
[2:41] Can I live to see it? Oh Lord, is it so
[2:44] close that I'll see it?
[2:46] Is this the generation, sir, my
[2:49] brethren? What time is it?
[2:52] [Music]
[2:53] Where are we at?
[2:56] [Music]
[2:58] Let's look at the watch,
[3:02] the calendar to see what date we're
[3:04] living in. Israel is in Palestine in our
[3:07] homeland.
[3:09] The end sign, the sixpoint star of David
[3:11] 2,000 years ago. Yeah. Nearly 2500 years
[3:14] ago. The oldest flag is flying.
[3:18] Israel's back in her homeland when the
[3:20] fig tree put forth his buds. This
[3:22] generation shall not die, shall not pass
[3:24] out, pass away until all things are
[3:26] fulfilled.
[3:29] Nations are breaking.
[3:32] Israel's awakening.
[3:34] The signs that the prophets foretold.
[3:38] The Gentile days numbered with horrors
[3:40] encumbered. Return, O disperse to your
[3:44] own. The day of redemption is near.
[3:49] Man's hearts are failing for fear.
[3:52] Be filled with the spirit. Your
[3:55] lampstream ain't clear. Look up. Your
[3:58] redemption is near.
[4:01] False prophets are lying. God's truth.
[4:05] They are denying that Jesus the Christ
[4:07] is our God.
[4:10] You know it's the truth.
[4:12] But we'll walk where the apostles have.
[4:15] Hallelujah.
[4:16] For the day of redemption is near.
[4:19] Man's hearts are failing for fear.
[4:23] Be filled with the spirit. Your lamp's
[4:25] trimmed and clear. Look up. Your
[4:29] redemption is near.
[4:31] Helpless.
[4:32] Might be closer than you think it is.
[4:36] Got me scared.
[4:38] Hallelujah.
[4:40] Oh, I haven't done enough.
[4:42] Where are we at?
[4:46] Time shall be no more. He announces that
[4:50] time is over.
[4:53] What happens?
[4:55] What happens? Could that be so now
[4:58] brethren?
[5:00] Seriously think if it is
[5:04] then the pyramid is capped by the seven
[5:08] thunders.
[5:10] You remember the pyramid message?
[5:13] It's the capstone. What did he do? The
[5:16] Holy Spirit capped off the individual
[5:18] and seal it. When we added to our faith
[5:21] righteousness and godliness and faith
[5:24] and so forth, we kept adding to it till
[5:26] we got seven things and the seventh one
[5:28] was love which is God. That's how he
[5:30] makes the individual and caps him and
[5:32] seals him with the Holy Spirit. Then if
[5:34] that be so, he's got seven church ages
[5:36] that he's had seven mysteries that's
[5:38] been sounded away and they fought for to
[5:40] bring back and now the headstone comes
[5:44] to cap off the church. Does the thunders
[5:48] mean that, my brethren?
[5:51] Sir, is that where we're at?
[5:55] [Music]
[6:09] I something about New York City.
[6:14] Now you watch. Remember, there's
[6:16] something about New York City. Don't
[6:18] forget that. Yes.
[6:25] Friday, September 20th, 1974. The
[6:28] following inspiration was given to me
[6:29] between 10:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. The
[6:32] seven thunders are the seven voices of
[6:34] the seven church ages.
[6:36] I ran in the room, dried myself off, and
[6:40] then he said, "Write it again." And I
[6:42] wrote it again. And he continued, "Which
[6:45] are seven manifestations of the Holy
[6:48] Spirit into the church as faith, a live
[6:52] voice, virtue, a live voice, knowledge,
[6:54] a live voice, timber, a live voice,
[6:56] patience, a live voice, godliness, a
[6:59] live voice, brotherly kindness, a live
[7:00] voice." Seven voices to build the
[7:03] perfect church to be capped off with the
[7:05] capstone. He builds his individuals the
[7:08] same way. These voices shook the
[7:10] kingdoms of the devil. in each age. Paul
[7:14] shook them. Arinius shook them. Martin
[7:17] shook them. Luther shook it. Praise
[7:19] Wesley shook him. Malachi 4 shook it.
[7:23] Praise God. It's the live voice that is
[7:26] the thunder that shakes the devil's
[7:28] kingdom. The bride each age the bride
[7:31] live the word voice virtue for her age.
[7:35] Malachi 4 restored back to the church
[7:39] seven voices for the bride to live and
[7:42] manifest bodily kindness as her virtue
[7:44] for her age. Therefore, when charity
[7:47] falls, a bride will manifest not one
[7:50] virtue, but she will actually manifest
[7:53] seven voices as thunder to shake the
[7:56] devil's kingdom.
[8:05] He made it. He made you a spine.
[8:10] Something within you to press on.

[9:24] the work.
[9:26] Then go down to Puerto Rico. Go into
[9:27] brother Sister Raina and brother David's
[9:30] prayer room. Amen. Pray the seventh
[9:32] seal. Hallelujah. You must go to Puerto
[9:35] Rico between uh March uh 17th and March

[9:44] over to uh uh brother David and Raina's
[9:47] house and Monday morning though you're
[9:49] tired play the the first seal on March
[9:53] 18th.
[9:55] I sat there. I was going to sleep. I was
[9:57] so tired. But he told me to play the
[9:59] first seal in New York when before I
[10:01] went and I called for the same thing
[10:04] again this year cuz it's the same day
[10:06] again.
[10:08] Same days.
[10:10] What is it? Oh, it's the 28th
[10:11] anniversary since 1963
[10:14] of the seven seals barley harvest.
[10:20] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. I hope that
[10:22] ignites you or something. Amen. I'm
[10:25] trying to tell you little things to help
[10:26] you. I had to do it. I had to speak in
[10:29] the Tucson tabernacle. Who can but
[10:31] prophesy? Praise God. You may be seated.
[10:34] Then wait. Go down to Puerto Rico. I'm
[10:36] laying there sitting there. I didn't
[10:37] know what the seven thunders was. The
[10:39] Holy Spirit said then he comes. He said
[10:40] now the seven thunders there page 128.
[10:42] He said uh when they when they come
[10:44] falling out, he says they will gather
[10:46] the people together. So and I played
[10:49] that and Holy Spirit said stop the tape.
[10:52] I jumped up. He said play that back. I
[10:54] heard it again. See seven thunders.
[10:56] They'll gather the people together. He
[10:57] said, "Stop the tape. Play it back."
[11:00] Played it back again. All of a sudden,
[11:01] boom. Inside exploded. Seven thunders
[11:04] gather people together. Seven thunders
[11:05] give faith. Seven thunder brass revival
[11:07] inside water inside here.
[11:10] Revelation.
[11:18] Amen. Now in his promised word he he
[11:21] won't have to uh you won't have to
[11:23] interpret it. He will interpret it
[11:25] through you. What you are doing what he
[11:27] promised to do the church that follows
[11:30] him here it is will be so much like him
[11:33] until the people will know.
[11:36] He won't have to say nothing. There goes
[11:38] a Christian.
[11:40] Wow.
[11:42] Dripping a Christian with charity.
[11:46] Amen. See Peter and John, they were
[11:49] questioned after healing a man at the
[11:51] gate called beautiful. They said that
[11:53] they perceived the priesthood that they
[11:54] were both ignorant, unlearned man. But
[11:57] they take notice that they had been with
[11:58] Jesus getting them seven steps because
[12:01] what? They were doing the things he did.
[12:06] And we're only divine with our seven
[12:08] steps.
[12:09] Without him, we can do nothing without
[12:10] charity.
[12:11] Amen. Amen.
[12:13] Amen. Peter had so much virtue. They
[12:16] will heal in his shadow.
[12:20] How you going to get temperance without
[12:22] virtue?
[12:26] If you got virtue, stand up and let
[12:27] somebody be healed in your shadow.
[12:30] Oh, now let's come to get some faith in
[12:33] this morning. Amen. Before we go way
[12:35] over there up the ladder somewhere.
[12:39] Amen. Let's get the faith first.
[12:42] Amen. Cuz you say you got uh temperance
[12:44] or patience. Where's the virtue?
[12:47] Virtue is dynamics. Healing power.
[12:50] The woman touched Jesus clothes and
[12:52] virtue he turned.
[12:54] Virtue went out of him. Healing power,
[12:57] dynamics went out.
[12:59] [Music]
[13:00] What a revelation. And he and he had a
[13:03] sign to prove it was him in there, too.
[13:05] He told the sickness of the heart and
[13:07] prophesied things to happen and healed
[13:09] the sick and uh spoke and created even
[13:11] created a jawbone and sent the lost his
[13:13] jaw
[13:14] so we in New York City would know that
[13:16] he was creating and not to look for
[13:18] something way down the road. He was
[13:20] already doing it in New York.
[13:22] What a sign came to brother Hunt and I
[13:24] so in 65 they could go west, east,
[13:26] south, north. I didn't care. I knew he
[13:28] was here.
[13:30] What a sign. He waved up and waved
[13:32] goodbye in New York. But I've already
[13:34] created a blood cell and hit the lost
[13:36] jawbone.
[13:37] So don't look for all these funny
[13:39] things. They're flying everywhere.
[13:41] Amen. I even give you a picture that
[13:44] Malachi 4 is going up in in with three
[13:46] horses. He's leaving. There's a mantle
[13:48] to fall behind. Catch the mantle.
[13:50] The mantle is faith, uh, virtue,
[13:53] knowledge, or temperance. Amen.
[13:56] Patience. God of his brotherly kind.
[13:58] That's the mantle. Then wrap it around
[14:00] you. Come on down to the Jordan. Stand
[14:02] there. Amen.
[14:04] Where is the Lord God of Elijah?
[14:12] But now after we got our first three
[14:14] steps which come from God, God gave the
[14:16] faith,
[14:18] God gave, he heals
[14:20] and he gives spiritual knowledge.
[14:23] Now what are we going to do with it?
[14:26] We know he's here
[14:28] and and he give us these things to a
[14:30] special group and we got it vindicated
[14:34] by the miraculous. Now, but what are we
[14:37] going to do with it? Well, here we are
[14:39] this morning. We're going to find out.
[14:42] Now, these next four things is what we
[14:44] do with what we got.
[14:48] If other words, now temperance,
[14:50] patience, godliness, and brotherly
[14:52] kindness are what we can do now.
[14:57] There you are.
[14:58] That's what we can do in appreciation
[15:00] back. Oh my God, you did this for me.
[15:02] That Lord, I I'm coming out of the
[15:04] world. That That's it.
[15:07] I'm going to live for you. I'm going to
[15:08] breathe for you. I'm going to walk for
[15:10] you, talk for you. Amen. I want to sleep
[15:12] and die for you.
[15:16] Amen.
[15:19] [Music]
[15:38] Heat. Heat.
[15:44] [Music]
[16:07] When them seven thunders utter their
[16:10] voices to that group who really can take
[16:11] the word of God and hand it their little
[16:14] slice cut. They can close the heavens.
[16:16] They can chuck this or do that, whatever
[16:18] they want to.
[16:20] [Music]
[16:23] You'll be slayed
[16:25] by a word that proceeds from his mouth
[16:27] is sharper than a two-edged sword. They
[16:29] could call for 100 million tons of flies
[16:32] if they wanted to.
[16:35] Whatever they say is going to happen
[16:37] because it's a word of God coming from
[16:39] the mouth of God.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:47] And I say by the faith in the word of
[16:52] God, there's some new skin sitting here
[16:55] this morning.
[16:58] Amen. There's some being delivered every
[17:00] day by the word, by this seventh thunder
[17:05] revelation.
[17:07] You are redeemed now.
[17:12] Praise God. Amen.
[17:16] We're sitting in heavenly places. Oh my.
[17:19] Those new skins with new wine, new life
[17:23] begin to expand. There wasn't enough
[17:26] room in the upper room to hold them.
[17:29] Too tight. They needed some room.
[17:33] Out. They come down the steps out into
[17:35] the street of Jerusalem. They expanded.
[17:38] They give. They stretched out. Oh,
[17:41] praise God. Until all Jerusalem began to
[17:44] wonder what needed this. And then Peter
[17:48] stood up there with a seven thunder
[17:50] revelation. This is that the prophet
[17:54] Joel Speaker of I. I pour out my new
[17:57] wife into some new skins.
[18:01] And this morning I'm persuaded that I
[18:03] can stand is this is that that the
[18:06] prophet Malachi for spake of
[18:10] the new wine is coming into you now.
[18:14] If you want the Holy Ghost, you can have
[18:16] it now.
[18:17] [Music]
[18:19] Just say, "Lord God, give me the Holy
[18:21] Ghost." If you want a healing, you can
[18:23] have the healing right now.
[18:26] The new wine is here now.
[18:30] He's pouring the new wine up on you.
[18:34] [Music]
[18:36] We're here. The dynamics and the
[18:39] mechanics is going forth together.
[18:44] Oh, praise God. Praise our God. Praise
[18:47] our God. Praise God. Amen. Thank you,
[18:50] Lord.

[19:08] Heat.
[19:10] [Music]
[19:19] Heat.
