[51:29] al Espíritu
[51:32] Santo y para que Dios manifieste su
[51:36] sanidad Porque algunos ya son
[51:40] manifestados es una señal de regreso a

[52:45] hará Entonces los ojos de los ciegos
[52:48] serán abiertos y los oídos de los sordos
[52:50] se abrirán
[53:02] entonces El Cojo saltará como un ciervo
[53:04] y cantará la lengua del mudo porque
[53:06] aguas serán cabadas en el desierto y
[53:09] torrentes en la
[53:11] soledad cuá sucederá esto isas 61
[53:29] el espíritu de Jehová está sobre mí
[53:31] porque me ha ungido Jehová y me ha
[53:33] enviado a predicar Buenas Nuevas a los
[53:35] abatidos y a vendar a los quebrantados
[53:37] de corazón a publicar libertad a los
[53:40] cautivos y a los presos apretura de la
[53:50] cárcel a proclamar el año bueno de la

[54:53] dijo recibid el Espíritu Santo
[55:02] a quienes Remi los pecados son remetido
[55:04] y a quienes los ruvis son
