[3:16] roadblock there when you say we all how
[3:18] many of filled with the Holy Ghost well
[3:20] just explain to your brother Anthony is
[3:22] just um believing the wait brother Bram
[3:25] has taught the message that the baptism
[3:27] of the Holy Ghost
[3:28] then God answers the life - so we've
[3:31] been adding the life to it so sure we
[3:33] would be filled with the Holy Ghost but
[3:35] we're waiting for charity to come down
[3:37] and then we'll be another book of Acts
[3:40] and then we'll say Peter fill with the
[3:43] Holy Ghost begin to speak Stephen full
[3:46] of the Holy Ghost
[3:47] he spoke Paul full of the holy ghost
[3:50] ship loosed a Viper
[3:52] so our people just didn't catch the
[3:54] understand what you're trying to say

[4:23] don't have the Holy Ghost
[4:24] you see they never went for that believe
[4:26] the message and you got it he's here now
[4:28] no they came in here with a full promise
[4:31] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see see
[4:35] I have children here that uh that are
[4:38] desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:40] for the promise on to me and my wife and
[4:42] to my children and they'll believe in a
[4:44] message and I'm believing for my
[4:46] children present the token for my
[4:48] household we have a promise God cannot
[4:51] fail so there are many who have not
[4:55] received it but there's a seed in the
[4:57] soul that God has amen and they bleed
[5:00] every word amen
[5:02] they're like a Peter and I'm in the
[5:03] upper room who didn't have the Holy
[5:05] Ghost did science one is a miracle but
[5:07] they had a promise amen MSA feebly he
[5:11] abide in me and my seventh under words
[5:14] of I renew
[5:15] you shall have whatcha will so that's
[5:19] what they're doing here this morning
[5:20] brother Anthony amen now see just a
[5:22] little a little thought here testing
[5:24] time God keeps his word honey believes
[5:27] that and he will fulfill every promise
[5:31] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[5:34] promise is a promise of the true baptism
[5:37] of the Holy Ghost faith all the way up
[5:40] through charity then when charity comes
[5:42] upon us the capstone then we are filled
[5:46] with the Holy Ghost a statue of a
[5:49] perfect man

[6:45] finished who God is what God is how he

[56:48] here moving with God and all the rest
[56:51] don't want to move God will move with
[56:54] that one so from this day on you forget
[56:59] about your neighbor don't look at
[57:01] someone slows more holy or better than
[57:03] wait a long time that ain't got one
[57:05] thing to do with it
[57:06] don't say I wish I could pray like so
[57:09] and so and so and so speak so nice and
[57:11] read the Bible that ain't got one thing
[57:13] to do with it the mood is on movie his
[57:19] princess is here be strong and be of a
[57:24] good courage don't live anymore on a
[57:29] delusion of unbelief don't live on this
[57:33] solution that we are carnal we are not
[57:36] carnal in that word I don't care how
[57:40] many mistakes you make
[57:41] we are not carnal I remember unbelief is
[57:47] as potent in its realm a man as faith is
[57:52] in its realm to you or me anyway
[57:58] the 10 spies they saw joyous and they
[58:02] thought themselves as grasshoppers Caleb
[58:05] and Joshua saw themselves as Giants and
[58:08] them as grasshoppers
[58:13] [Music]
[58:15] so today I'm stepping on grasshoppers
[58:23] stop another grasshoppers
[58:27] hey man freeze but pull out that sword
[58:33] charge them grasshoppers so where you
[58:39] standing this morning you're standing
[58:41] with Josh wait Caleb or you're staying
[58:44] with the ten spires and two million the
[58:46] whole congregation saying no what do we
[58:49] care the whole message says you're wrong
[58:52] God said soul Amy so faith in this realm
[59:01] without the Holy Ghost is more powerful
[59:05] than unbelief in the other realm because
[59:09] unbelief is a reversal form of faith
[59:14] unbelief is the belief in the power of
[59:17] evil in place of belief in the power of
[59:24] God now where you're standing this
[59:26] morning God gonna make you ready amen he
[59:32] gave you a taste of the garment place a
[59:36] get the itty-bitty teeny-weenie spirit
[59:39] off of them that they might possess the
[59:43] inheritance amen are you gonna believe
[59:47] in the power of God or power evil I
[59:50] believe in the power of God then an
[59:55] actual experience we feel and see
[59:58] carnality amen until this belief
[1:00:03] unbelief is reversed and changing to
[1:00:06] unto Bowl acceptance and a declaration
[1:00:09] of faith you'll be mired down so today
[1:00:13] say we can do all things through Christ
[1:00:16] Jesus we are in heavenly places right
[1:00:21] now every place where your foot puts
[1:00:25] steps down in heavenly places that I had
[1:00:28] given you amen and I'll be with you all

[1:09:10] brings the results if you said yes yes I
[1:09:14] believe it but I don't know now that's
[1:09:17] not the right attitude do you believe it
[1:09:22] the right attitude is to receive it and
[1:09:26] say it's thus saith the Lord then it's
[1:09:30] right and if you can say I'm healed or
[1:09:35] saith the Lord it's all over with if you
[1:09:40] can say I have the Holy Ghost by faith
[1:09:42] thus saith the Lord God will seal that

[1:10:45] what I'm doing now the Holy Spirit has
[1:10:47] already placed you into charity it's
[1:10:52] here it's going on right now oh don't
[1:10:57] you feel the Holy Spirit moving I got
[1:11:02] something to read to you
[1:11:03] I asked brother Frank for a straighten
[1:11:05] tape Friday night and do you know I told
[1:11:08] him the wrong tape I wanted total
[1:11:10] deliverance and I must have said testing
[1:11:13] time and he gave me testing time when I
[1:11:17] went to here I said that's not what I
[1:11:18] want I want to total deliverance the
[1:11:21] Holy Spirit said hear it and I heard it
[1:11:23] Wow amen that's the one he wanted for
[1:11:26] this morning brother Frank is Iran
[1:11:29] brother Frank I asked him but I wanted
[1:11:31] total deliverance because the book is
[1:11:33] coming out so I wanted to get the tape
[1:11:36] before the book got here and hear it
[1:11:38] again and I got testing time and here's
[1:11:41] what a brother Brent said on the end of
[1:11:42] testing time 57 marvelous things to
[1:11:45] happen in the meetings he had just come
[1:11:47] from Oakland California it's we're
[1:11:50] coming into a type of something that it
[1:11:52] just seems to be greater than than what
[1:11:54] it was prophetic gift beyond questioning
[1:11:57] his other words his gift is beyond
[1:11:59] questioning we see that he said but his
[1:12:02] gift now it just doesn't get the job
[1:12:04] done way it should it's just a gift
[1:12:08] another thing is an individual
[1:12:11] it's an individual it pertains to an an
[1:12:16] individual through a gift
[1:12:18] so he went ministered to one person the
[1:12:20] next one the next one the next one and
[1:12:22] some wouldn't get it and they go home
[1:12:23] discouraged then right if they didn't
[1:12:26] get a prayer card they were finished
[1:12:28] right there so he want to get the church
[1:12:30] beyond that he want to get us here this
[1:12:34] morning in the presence of the Shekinah
[1:12:39] no gift giver himself his presence not
[1:12:43] to just one individual with a prayer
[1:12:46] card or maybe has some faith to pull it
[1:12:48] over there but he want to be want the
[1:12:51] least little one with a little bit of
[1:12:54] grain of mustard seed faith he want to
[1:13:00] get you into his presence to weigh all
[1:13:03] things are possible to them that belief
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:08] got it now but I have done something the
[1:13:12] other day I tried to get the people in
[1:13:15] Oakland just to where in in the big
[1:13:17] arena there I said just his presence and
