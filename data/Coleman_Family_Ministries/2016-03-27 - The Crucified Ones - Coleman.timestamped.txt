[2:40] seated we're certainly happy to be here
[2:42] this
[2:43] morning and it's getting increasingly
[2:46] increasingly uh trial to get here praise
[2:50] the Lord this been one sickness after
[2:52] another home with the the children since
[2:55] 2 or 3 months now one gets sick the
[2:57] other one gets sick the other one gets
[2:58] sick the baby's been up for about 8
[3:00] months every night just about takes
[3:03] everything out of you so but we are
[3:05] praising God and thanking him and moving
[3:09] on for we know that these things must be
[3:12] these little light afflictions they must
[3:14] be and this is only God having us so to
[3:18] speak in high school getting us ready
[3:21] for college praise the lord we want to
[3:24] touch on on that this morning in the
[3:25] message and so it's good to be here um
[3:29] back here in the Pulpit to bring the
[3:33] word of God for this is indeed a great
[3:35] privilege and also an honor to be able
[3:38] to be a servant of Jesus Christ and I
[3:41] was really blessed just a a message
[3:44] coming through here Serv we would see
[3:46] Jesus old tape how brother Brandon was
[3:49] explaining that when the Greeks came to
[3:53] I believe it was Phillip and Andrew I
[3:55] think it was and said that we would see
[3:58] Jesus
[4:00] uh brother BR was saying that they were
[4:01] true disciples and they took them to the
[4:05] presence of God which was Jesus Christ
[4:08] and then Jesus Christ when they got
[4:10] there he never pointed them to himself
[4:13] he never pointed them to who he was
[4:15] nothing like he he pointed them to a
[4:17] place Calvary except a corn of wheat
[4:21] fall in the ground and die it shall
[4:23] because of B alone if Christ pointed the
[4:26] people to Calvary what about us see and
[4:30] so therefore he he made a statement that
[4:32] a true servant always points the people
[4:35] to Christ to the Cross to Calvary so my
[4:39] prayer is God help me be a true disciple
[4:41] to point you to the Cross Calvary Jesus
[4:44] Christ in this year coming that uh the
[4:47] Resurrection Life of Christ might be
[4:49] made manifest in us so we're so happy
[4:52] this morning to be here and we have a
[4:55] tape for tonight the predestinated
[4:57] perfect will of God so one wonderful
[5:00] message I didn't hear it yet but I just
[5:02] heard excerpts of it just to check out
[5:03] the tape make sure it was all right and
[5:06] he speaks
[5:07] about um the resurrection and things
[5:09] like that and being over in heaven and
[5:11] those kind of things just really pick
[5:12] you up you know that's the word of God
[5:14] that's what because we live for and
[5:16] that's why we're here and we wanted to
[5:19] uh play Blasphemous names Wednesday if
[5:21] we can get the tape I think the one we
[5:24] had is something wrong with it or
[5:25] something but I wonder if brother Curt
[5:27] have the tape the Blasphemous names
[5:30] you have it good okay if you bring it in
[5:33] CU we like to play that Wednesday and
[5:35] also give out the books so there that'll
[5:37] be Wednesday night Blasphemous names and
[5:40] the Lord willing next Sunday night if
[5:41] we're still here statue of a perfect man
[5:45] I believe that uh that'll bring us to a
[5:48] place where we can understand the will
[5:49] of God for the hour in which we're just
[5:52] about to approach so with that thought
[5:54] in mind let us open the word of God let
[5:58] us turn to Colossians the thirr
[6:02] chapter verses 1-
[6:06] 16 and in Romans
[6:09] 8 verse 10 through1
[6:12] 13 so I want to relax this morning take
[6:16] my time we're always rushing and so it's
[6:20] being taped so thought maybe I just take
[6:22] my time praise the Lord if you're with
[6:25] me Colossians the 3r
[6:28] chapter um
[6:30] verses 1- 16 and Romans the 8th chapter
[6:34] 10th verse through the
[6:38] 13th reading from Colossians 3 if ye
[6:41] then in Rison with Christ seek those
[6:44] things which are above where Christ sth
[6:46] on the right hand of God set your
[6:49] affection on things above not on things
[6:51] on the earth for you are dead and your
[6:54] life is hid with Christ in God when
[6:58] Christ who is our our life shall appear
[7:01] then shall ye also appear with him in
[7:04] glory mortify Therefore your members
[7:08] which are upon the Earth fornication
[7:09] uncleanliness inordinate affection
[7:13] consiousness which is idolatry for which
[7:15] things sake the wrath of God cometh on
[7:18] the children of Disobedience into which
[7:21] you also walk sometime when you lived in
[7:24] them but now you also put off all these
[7:27] anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[7:29] communication out of your mouth L out
[7:32] one to another seeing that you have put
[7:34] off the old man with his deeds and have
[7:36] put on the new man which is renewed in
[7:39] knowledge after the image of him that
[7:41] created him where there is neither Greek
[7:44] nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision
[7:48] bar a barbarian cynthian Bond nor free
[7:51] but Christ is all and in all put on
[7:56] therefore this is a Greek word it means
[7:58] to be ued like over there in St Luke
[8:01] 24:49 they had to put on something amen
[8:05] be endued with power from because from
[8:07] on high put on therefore as the elect of
[8:10] God holy and beloved vows of
[8:14] mercies kindness humbleness of Mind
[8:17] meekness longsuffering forbearing one
[8:20] another and forgiving one another If any
[8:23] man have a quarrel against any even as
[8:25] Christ forgave you so also do ye and
[8:29] above all these things put on something
[8:31] else now put on charity which is the
[8:34] bond of
[8:35] perfectness and let the God of Peace
[8:38] rule in your hearts to the which also ye
[8:42] are called in one body and be be you
[8:45] thankful in other words if it be a
[8:47] question in your mind let let the the
[8:50] Empire the Umpire Christ rule in your in
[8:53] your hearts cuz he'll de sign the word
[8:55] amen if any question come up see let him
[8:57] rule amen
[9:00] and let the word of Christ dwell live
[9:04] see in you richly in all wisdom teaching
[9:07] admiring one another in Psalms and hymns
[9:09] and spiritual songs singing with Grace
[9:11] in your hearts to the Lord and Romans
[9:16] 8 Romans
[9:21] 8 10 and if Christ be in you the body is
[9:25] dead because of sin but the spirit is
[9:28] life because of righteousness
[9:29] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[9:31] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[9:32] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[9:34] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[9:37] spirit that dwelleth in you therefore
[9:39] brethren we are we are debtors not to
[9:41] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[9:44] you live after the flesh you shall die
[9:46] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[9:49] which means to to crucify the Deeds of
[9:51] the body you shall live and God a
[9:53] blessing the reading of his word like to
[9:56] give a little Title Here the the
[9:59] crucified
[10:01] ones um today um all of us know by the
[10:06] great hour in which we're living in that
[10:09] uh there's all kind of things going on
[10:11] which we know and just as as a review of
[10:15] what has taken place quickly the past
[10:18] year of 1968 which many in America and
[10:21] around the world called the most
[10:24] phenomenal year that they have ever
[10:25] witnessed in this country here or
[10:28] anywhere else because for that matter
[10:30] and we thank God to know that we knew
[10:33] that this had to be and and and we sat
[10:36] right here went through the whole year
[10:38] and saw all of these changes in Social
[10:41] conditions science religion and politics
[10:46] everything every seed had to be planted
[10:49] last year o of any event that's going to
[10:53] take place because in the future the
[10:55] seed had to be last year had to be there
[10:57] and then God would even in the natural
[10:59] natur come out and show you through
[11:01] science because Apollo 7 and8 of what
[11:04] he's done and even give his servant
[11:07] brother Billy Paul a dream to show you
[11:09] what he's done in the church see all
[11:10] these are spiritual things and you have
[11:12] to have a spiritual eye to Paul says to
[11:15] have your eyes of your understanding
[11:18] then your understanding has eyes amen
[11:20] and God has anointed those eyes with is
[11:22] have that it might see see means to
[11:26] understand amen and and then when you
[11:28] understand and peace settles down in
[11:31] your heart then when you know that that
[11:34] that somehow you know it can't explain
[11:36] it but your life is dead in Jesus Christ
[11:42] just it's in Christ that's all see it's
[11:44] there and the blood of Jesus Christ has
[11:47] washed away your sins and there is a sin
[11:49] atonement here now his blood for the
[11:51] sins of future sins which he knew that
[11:54] we had to go through being weak in the
[11:56] flesh see but there's an atonement here
[11:58] care for it so we thank God for that in
[12:03] 1961 President John Kennedy he uh uh set
[12:07] the national goal that uh man because
[12:11] America would reach the Moon by
[12:13] 1969 and that was America's national
[12:16] goal and we see now that she thinks that
[12:20] she's just about to reach her goal this
[12:23] year she wants to do it I believe it is
[12:25] that she wants to do it in July on the
[12:28] Apollo number 11 and she used to have
[12:31] two other Apollo trips uh number nine
[12:34] and number 10 number nine I believe is a
[12:36] go in February 28th and so we know that
[12:41] the prophet of God has taught us that
[12:43] God types out in the natural what he's
[12:45] doing in the spiritual so we watch for
[12:48] those things and we look for them and in
[12:50] the holy spirit with his grace he opens
[12:53] it up to us and then we see what's going
[12:55] on see and then we just get so full and
[12:58] and the other person
[12:59] he don't understand what you're talking
[13:00] about but you know and you can't explain
[13:02] it you see and so therefore um just as a
[13:06] backdrop we thought that we would just
[13:09] go back over and because review a little
[13:10] bit and um last year as to what happened
[13:14] in Apollo 7 we know it was stream in 7
[13:17] SE message third poll full vision with
[13:21] that plastic bubble helmet and that
[13:23] $100,000 doll suit on went around the
[13:26] earth 11 times we know to get the 11
[13:29] workers all these spiritual things you
[13:31] see and the mechanics of it was perfect
[13:35] the uh the newspaper said so perfect and
[13:38] then we know that Apollo 7 is actually
[13:41] because Apollo 8 they just changed the
[13:43] number that's all but the same ship see
[13:46] same mechanics and everything else but
[13:48] because Apollo had to do something else
[13:50] then this had to go around the Moon see
[13:54] 10 times and so forth and and it had to
[13:57] go around and to prove that it was ready
[14:00] to go to the moon but one thing it had
[14:02] to do before it could go to the Moon it
[14:05] had to find the secret On the Dark Side
[14:08] of the Moon see what was silence back
[14:11] there if it don't get that secret in the
[14:14] silence back because in the seal back
[14:15] behind that Moon back there it'll never
[14:17] go to the Moon amen and we know that uh
[14:21] the the seven seal in Revelation 8 says
[14:24] silence amen and we know that we don't
[14:26] ever find out the mystery of those seven
[14:28] Thunders we'll never go there either
[14:30] amen so therefore when this Apollo 8
[14:34] because you catching ap8 was typing out
[14:39] that there will be one more rhyme
[14:42] because man did it in the natural and
[14:45] the prophet spoke it I'll ride the trail
[14:48] one more time and he said make no
[14:51] mistake about it brother cins God will
[14:53] ride that trail one more time on Satan's
[14:56] Eden Shield turn at the West and she'll
[15:00] ride back amen one more time amen amen
[15:03] so we see with our eyes of our
[15:06] understanding and then this fills our
[15:08] heart and we're waiting we're waiting
[15:11] but we know what we're waiting for you
[15:13] don't know what you're waiting for then
[15:15] is just just waiting in vain but we have
[15:18] a hope and we stagger not through
[15:21] unbelief but we every day a strong
[15:23] giving praise to God for we know he'll
[15:26] ride back and then the whole world
[15:28] Houston they all was waiting when they
[15:30] went up behind the moon they waited for
[15:33] about 45 minutes in silence nothing was
[15:36] heard it was a hush over the whole world
[15:40] on TV tellar they all was waiting would
[15:43] they come back would they go into orbit
[15:46] and man and when they went around the
[15:47] side of the moon they had to begin to
[15:49] read from
[15:50] Genesis let them know God making them do
[15:53] it amen amen and reading the first 10
[15:55] verses because from Genesis in the
[15:57] beginning see in the beginning and the
[16:00] prophet had a message in the beginning
[16:02] Genesis clean through the Book of
[16:04] Revelation amen and here they in the
[16:06] beginning and now here they come out in
[16:08] the end see and they come flying around
[16:11] the moon and here they come and they
[16:13] went into orbit and the world shouted
[16:16] for Joy well what'll happen when that
[16:19] white horse rider come riding back amen
[16:22] when he anoints that church amen when he
[16:25] comes riding back with the power of the
[16:28] Resurrection
[16:29] upon his brde he's coming s so I can
[16:33] hear the ho Beast coming amen amen
[16:36] praise the lord it's it's with a
[16:38] spiritual ear though see not a natural
[16:42] horse now like they say over there see a
[16:45] spiritual horse am amen so we see then
[16:49] that the whole world was waiting in hush
[16:51] silence waiting to see if they would go
[16:53] into orbit and man did so what is God
[16:56] doing typing out in the natur that the
[16:58] spiritual ones will go in orbit also
[17:00] right and we have to get in Orbit
[17:02] there's no there's we can't do nothing
[17:04] in ourselves the father he doeth The
[17:06] Works the dove must come and put you in
[17:08] orbit the Flying Eagle amen must anoint
[17:12] these because mechanics here so to me
[17:15] this was a sign from God that the seed
[17:17] was sown in the year 68 for politics
[17:21] religion social conditions and science
[17:24] everything and to me that is God the way
[17:28] he does things is so humble and so like
[17:32] in secret in in Simplicity rather see
[17:36] here he comes in uh January the 1st 1968
[17:39] and gives brother Billy Paul a dream and
[17:42] tells him about 19 tapes and all these
[17:44] things 19 separates us and brother Billy
[17:46] Paul he went ahead and told a dream and
[17:48] many of them because they told me to my
[17:49] face spiritualism plain and simple right
[17:52] out of their mouth spiritualism never
[17:55] said a word just went on so what was God
[17:57] doing the people in the message had
[17:59] gotten off the beaten path they went
[18:02] into horses and and Natural Things see
[18:06] me now so they they said well I say it's
[18:08] this I say it's abstinence I say you got
[18:10] to go out to Arizona I say you have to
[18:12] go over there so then God said now I'm
[18:14] going to bring her back on on the course
[18:16] so therefore there's 10 more tapes 10
[18:20] and therefore the son of God the Holy
[18:22] Spirit Will anoint the church 10 times
[18:25] last year with these 10 tapes you
[18:27] understand me to so therefore Billy Paul
[18:29] had to bring back the
[18:31] message that God gave his father in 62
[18:35] the greatest battley ever for he says
[18:37] store up this food here and the the
[18:40] cutting off point was in 63 Look Away to
[18:42] Jesus where he said he must go on the
[18:44] field and he cannot make the tapes here
[18:46] no more but he has to make them as he
[18:47] goes so therefore brother Billy Paul
[18:49] knew the starting and also the cutting
[18:51] off point see so then the Holy Spirit
[18:55] came back and and he said well how will
[18:57] I know what to play
[18:59] he said it'll be like the statue of a
[19:01] perfect man in other words it won't be
[19:03] like going to Arizona it won't be like
[19:06] horses and things it be like a man
[19:09] adding to his faith virtue Temperance
[19:14] knowledge patience godliness and then
[19:18] brotherly kindness the honey that grips
[19:20] in the rockl your confession your
[19:23] confession means nothing if there's no
[19:25] honey holding there if you don't have
[19:27] love for your brother forgiveness for
[19:30] your brother there's no confession at
[19:32] all because Honey in the Rock is the
[19:35] confession and if when you see those
[19:36] mean and evil against you there's no
[19:39] confession at all it's a tinkling symbol
[19:41] and a hollow sound amen for our eyes is
[19:45] Anointed to understand who is Christ
[19:47] Christ is the word Christ is love Christ
[19:50] is gentle longsuffering and patience and
[19:52] godliness Hallelujah we know who Christ
[19:54] is amen so we know where we standing at
[19:58] praise our God but nevertheless this had
[20:00] to be and so we see then that Billy Paul
[20:04] said well how will I know well the
[20:06] message will be not what you hear today
[20:09] with these false Christ brought out
[20:10] since 65 but go back to the greatest
[20:12] Valley of a fort statue of of a perfect
[20:16] man Christ is the mystery of God
[20:18] revealed in April in the July meeting a
[20:21] way of a true Prophet restoration of the
[20:24] Bride tree is all the message because he
[20:26] preached you see in August and September
[20:29] wisdom versus Faith absolute spoken word
[20:32] and then here in November indictment
[20:34] three kind of Believers there's your 10
[20:36] tapes right there every one of them is
[20:37] right on the word every one of them
[20:39] preaches a death burial and resurrection
[20:42] of Jesus Christ every one of them is
[20:44] preaching a cross you got to die am
[20:46] there's no easy way to go around here
[20:47] and go over there and go over there no
[20:49] sir on a saying on an idea for a true
[20:52] disciple he points you to the word and
[20:55] that word must be preached for you bring
[20:57] the people into the the presence of
[20:59] Jesus and therefore he said not like a
[21:01] disciples today who take you to a church
[21:04] to a Creed to a idea to what so and so
[21:08] said to what we think see to me now no
[21:11] more ministers just here just read the
[21:13] seven Church age book or whatever some
[21:15] kind of because crazy idea but he'll
[21:18] take you to the word of God all the word
[21:21] from Genesis clean through the Book of
[21:23] Revelation amen so we see then that
[21:26] these 10 tapes seeds of God was swn in '
[21:29] 68 and the Son of God himself had to go
[21:33] around his bride as she come to hear the
[21:35] word he had to plac the seed in there
[21:37] sold that seed there last year to the
[21:39] bride and we played the same tapes here
[21:41] because so we tried to now uh see
[21:44] because the people had they had because
[21:46] forgotten the message the enemy coming
[21:48] so powerful in ' 6566 they didn't know
[21:51] what the message was just believeing you
[21:53] all right no sir the disciples because
[21:55] they believed and they were associated
[21:57] with him but but they had to die they
[21:59] had to be baptized into him by death you
[22:03] see so therefore it takes more than that
[22:05] so now because Apollo 8 it went around
[22:07] the Moon 10 times on December 24th even
[22:12] over in Hagi 2118 it says that is the
[22:14] seed yet in the barn other words is the
[22:17] wheat there in the Garner no sir see it
[22:21] says that the foundation because hagy
[22:23] was laid in December 24th and we know
[22:27] that that God counts time because from
[22:29] April so December is the 9th month that
[22:32] right amen and our Prophet died December
[22:34] 24th
[22:36] 1965 the foundation was laid and then
[22:39] Christ says from this day will I bless
[22:42] you from this day forward and there was
[22:44] the seed now you just take the seed the
[22:46] corn of Wheat and plant it into the word
[22:48] and let it come up and resurrect because
[22:50] Christ in you so we see then that Apollo
[22:53] 8 had to go around the Moon 10 times to
[22:56] lay the foundation for the landing on
[22:58] the moon this year see it now friends so
[23:01] now uh we see in also I picked up a very
[23:05] interesting article here which was in
[23:07] the New York Times Monday it's quite
[23:10] interesting it says here because I'll
[23:12] read it to you they there's been a um a
[23:17] science uh magazine Atomic scientists
[23:20] for the past 20 cover read the article
[23:23] here for nearly 25 years the bulletin of
[23:26] the atomic scientist has carried on his
[23:29] cover a clock showing man's closeness to
[23:32] total Destruction now watch this for
[23:35] some unknown reason see last year the
[23:38] hand was moved forward to 8
[23:41] minutes right here in the paper see here
[23:43] the Doomsday Clock still reads 11:52 8
[23:46] minutes see now for 25 years nobody
[23:50] moved that hand on that bulletin but
[23:53] somebody made the publisher or even the
[23:55] editor move the hand up 8 minutes to
[23:58] midnight and it says 8 Minutes to
[24:01] Midnight 8 minutes to an hour the
[24:03] politicians and social scientists of
[24:05] Russia China and America probably would
[24:07] agree on one thing unless remarkably
[24:09] positive steps are taken in the next
[24:11] five years see the chances of the world
[24:14] celebrating the dawn of New Years in the
[24:16] year 2000 are far dimmer than any moment
[24:19] in recorded history possibly the chances
[24:21] of survival are dimmer than in that
[24:23] cataclysmic moment when the Great age of
[24:25] of glaciers Dawn and it must have seemed
[24:27] to many in that epic that the world
[24:30] would die in a girdle of ice thousands
[24:32] of feet thick so now here's God Making
[24:36] Science move the hand forward to 8
[24:39] minutes to 12 there's your number eight
[24:41] again number eight testifying which is
[24:44] that's the year that the seed is to be
[24:46] swn according to because Leviticus 25 I
[24:48] think it's 22 so number eight has been
[24:52] an astounding year and then I wonder why
[24:55] they have this part which they didn't
[24:57] test out on on the Apollo 8 it's called
[25:00] in It's called The Landing module and so
[25:04] I said well they were supposed to tested
[25:05] out here in December but it wasn't ready
[25:07] yet so I wonder why what does that mean
[25:09] see all because called it mean something
[25:11] and then it just comes to me this way as
[25:14] it comes to me they are to test this
[25:17] flight is to go up February 29th um
[25:20] February 28th rather this year for 10
[25:23] days and supposed to go around the earth
[25:26] cuz not the moon see has because it has
[25:28] to be tested on the earth first before
[25:30] it goes up there see typen out so to me
[25:33] um there is the message of the time see
[25:38] and there's a message of the
[25:39] hour now hidden the message of time is
[25:42] the message of the hour to the bride see
[25:46] now the message of the time the Seven
[25:47] Seals come and strip down the Catholic
[25:50] church and the nomination and so forth
[25:52] tell you all about the hippies and the
[25:53] women and that's the message of the time
[25:56] see amen now and any man he can see that
[25:59] and also because preach off of that but
[26:01] hid in there is something else see hid
[26:04] in there is where there's a secret
[26:07] Revelation where the bride is to add
[26:10] during this time when the whole world
[26:11] sees all of these judgments falling the
[26:13] bride is adding see so therefore to me
[26:18] that part which goes on the moon is this
[26:21] Landing module see to me that part is
[26:24] Faith adding to it virtue and so forth
[26:27] which has to be
[26:29] tested see every corn of wheat if it is
[26:32] a real corn of wheat it must be put to
[26:34] the test to see if it is a corner weat
[26:38] now we may say we have faith and
[26:41] patience and Temperance amen and virtue
[26:44] and so forth we may say that but the
[26:47] hour must come when that must be put to
[26:50] the test before it goes into heaven my
[26:54] God are you follow me friends so it is
[26:56] the other part of because a n where it
[27:00] must be tested and we must be tested
[27:04] also we're only been here in a place of
[27:06] trying that's all we've been in high
[27:09] school see but we have to go to college
[27:12] amen see he's been child that's why
[27:15] we've been playing all these tapes to
[27:17] you child training you follow me now
[27:20] well other words when you go to the
[27:21] cross and you come up then you get milk
[27:24] that's the little grade school there is
[27:26] that right get the milk see and then you
[27:29] go to high school then you go into child
[27:31] training see then when you finish High
[27:33] School which we're just about ready to
[27:35] finish then you go into college a school
[27:38] of suffering see and in the whole thing
[27:42] now don't lose me now I mean Stay With
[27:45] Me Now Praise the Lord see this is is
[27:48] the old corn see and and so we want to
[27:50] know uh where we standing at and the
[27:53] real Believers are they know that God
[27:57] has
[27:58] predestinated for ordain that they
[28:00] should come to that place for God's
[28:03] Prophet told us that if the bride could
[28:05] ever find her place is that right every
[28:08] man and woman can find their place where
[28:11] on the cross find their place there then
[28:14] the Holy Spirit after he has come down
[28:17] through justification and so forth he
[28:19] can find his
[28:20] fullness there amen at the cross and in
[28:24] Resurrection in the power of Jesus
[28:26] Christ see now friends but before that
[28:29] comes you must come to that place so to
[28:32] me the message of the hour is we is the
[28:36] the seed is ripening now and looks like
[28:39] nothing but there's something going on
[28:41] yeah amen and during this time is when
[28:43] the enemy comes and tells you there's no
[28:46] use there's no hope for you and and and
[28:50] yet the word speaks out if he could only
[28:52] find a people who will just believe the
[28:54] word just the way it's spoken Hallelujah
[28:56] not understanding it all see he said
[28:59] that was the faith that the early church
[29:01] had to now now let's remember what the
[29:04] early church was now they receive a a a
[29:08] human man is that right now think of it
[29:11] now they received a man just like you
[29:13] and I a man walked up Jesus Christ and
[29:16] said he was the
[29:17] Christ and they had to believe that now
[29:19] they were they had prophets and they had
[29:21] everything they had to believe that he
[29:23] was the Christ because he interpreted
[29:26] the word amen amen the signs followed
[29:29] him he was the word so they had to
[29:31] believe in him now without uh sitting
[29:35] down with him and say now what does this
[29:37] mean and what does that mean over there
[29:38] and get on a telephone see now see just
[29:41] believe it just the way it was because
[29:44] God has a plan and he does not change he
[29:47] said here a scripture here as it comes
[29:48] to me here I'll just go as a holy spirit
[29:51] leads me amen amen will this take our

[32:06] is that Peter and he just used Peter's
[32:09] vocal cords and set up on Peter and
[32:12] spoke out of his mouth and went to his
[32:14] own scriptures he knows the ones for the
[32:16] hour amen the mind of Christ moved into
[32:20] Peter Peter was just standing there his
[32:22] flesh was alive to God God quickened his
[32:25] mechanics to every word of God and then
[32:27] quick to every word then he can go
[32:28] through him to the word of God all in
[32:30] the Bible and pull it out amen and speak
[32:32] it through his lips amen that's what he

[33:09] around well I think it means this and
[33:11] because I think it means that but he
[33:13] will bring it what he means to your
[33:15] memory and you'll stand up there under
[33:17] the direct inspiration of God and speak
[33:20] it out and every man will hear it then
[33:23] every man will understand it then it'll
[33:25] be the word made flesh are you foll me
[33:28] praise all God I'm waiting for that
[33:29] friends yes sir now one's got a Doctrine
[33:32] one's got an idea and one says this one
[33:35] says that go over here go over there see
[33:37] but the hour was coming for the spirit
[33:39] of Truth he comes right on the word amen
[33:42] see right on the word praise the Lord
[33:46] and yet before he comes you got to have
[33:48] a little test and the Holy Spirit has L
[33:50] us this way see all through these things
[33:53] here a little test and and remember when
[33:56] Satan when Christ went on his little
[33:58] test there upon the mountain there Satan
[34:00] came to him well if Satan came to him
[34:03] with 99 and 910 of the word in the
[34:07] message it is written that's the way he
[34:09] come won't his Antichrist ministers come
[34:12] also the same way it is written bride
[34:15] brother BR said thus and so didn't they
[34:17] do it follow me now they had to do it
[34:20] but the bride said it is also written
[34:24] amen it is also written man shall not
[34:27] live by bread but by every word well I
[34:29] believe well I believe the word amen
[34:32] amen see and when if is a true disciple
[34:35] he won't point you to himself he won't
[34:38] bring out a dogmatic teaching about a
[34:40] fivefold ministry that's a dogmatic
[34:42] teaching see me now he won't just keep
[34:45] CU you can tell about the third message
[34:47] it goes right back to self either it'll
[34:49] go to Christ or it'll go to that man
[34:51] preaching and there you got it and you
[34:54] just watch and wait so therefore what
[34:56] God does to you he brings in a real test
[34:58] to you love and everything and and see
[35:01] if you catch it cuz that's just the way
[35:04] it'll have to be on your own and you got
[35:07] to get it now you because you going into
[35:09] college see somebody now I hope you got
[35:12] that see and then some just say well
[35:14] isn't that wonderful G away didn't even
[35:17] know it see now see it if the man
[35:20] doesn't point you to Christ he's not a
[35:23] true disciple he's pointing you to
[35:25] himself he's telling you that the
[35:27] prophet did nothing and you got to
[35:29] receive me to fivefold mer I have to
[35:31] come and perfect you when you're already
[35:33] perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:35] amen you only have to come to an actual
[35:37] experience the place that God ordained
[35:40] for you to be there in the school of
[35:42] sufferings and then it'll be perfected
[35:44] amen but you already perfected in his
[35:46] mind before the foundation of the world
[35:48] knowing that you will receive the word
[35:50] at that place that he is leading you now
[35:53] the dove leading you right to it praise
[35:56] our God you see it friends amen so we
[35:59] see then now the bride is put to the
[36:02] test on the word by the devil on God of
[36:06] this evil Age The Prophet told us so he
[36:09] says what is going on now he said the
[36:11] bride is to be tested on the word and
[36:15] that's just what we've been tested on
[36:17] the word he said it'll be so close it
[36:20] would deceive the very elected if
[36:22] possible that right and brother we have
[36:25] seen it and won't be at don't go after
[36:28] man's person no matter who the man is
[36:31] and many went after people's persons
[36:34] because they were in a certain position
[36:36] see now they went but he said go after
[36:38] the word and they went away after said
[36:41] well he must know it or this one got to
[36:44] know they was there with him you see so
[36:47] therefore men will come with great sring
[36:50] natural words to deceive you even Peter
[36:53] tried to because do it to Christ Christ
[36:56] had to go go to the Cross Peter tried to
[36:59] get them not to go there and they'll
[37:01] come and try to make you bypass the
[37:03] cross go to Arizona or go over here and
[37:06] just wait follow me now for the
[37:07] resurrection you got to die first amen
[37:09] you got to die before you go up in the
[37:11] resurrection you must die kill yourself
[37:14] spiritually mortify these body crucify
[37:17] this flesh here it's got to be done but
[37:19] they'll come easy like in the message
[37:21] all we all believe the message and the
[37:23] prophet said there'll be one here and
[37:24] two over there and one over there see it
[37:27] me now but you believe that you are that
[37:29] one by faith you believe it hold on to
[37:33] it amen see so therefore with the
[37:37] understanding we now have we understand
[37:40] that what God is doing and so now we
[37:43] want to know just what is God's will
[37:46] because for us we know we realize that
[37:48] we must die to bring forth his life see
[37:52] we must be because crucified with him in
[37:55] his eternal life and in his life and our
[37:58] life meets there and he kills this life
[38:00] paralyzes it in Christ do you actually
[38:03] realize friends that we are dead in
[38:05] Christ we have been dipped immersed into
[38:10] the anointing and that is what buries
[38:13] you in there you are buried by not the
[38:16] baptism of water now that only answers
[38:19] to a good conscience because toward God
[38:22] you're only saying what happened on the
[38:23] inside but inside of you you were buried
[38:27] in Christ you follow me now you were
[38:30] buried by a baptism he must take you
[38:32] into his death by a baptism and then you
[38:35] and you're hid in there you're never to
[38:38] come out no more you're hid in there but
[38:40] when he appears your life appears also
[38:44] and God has ordained for us to be here
[38:46] for this hour when he's getting ready
[38:48] now to appear for the last minist on the
[38:51] earth before he appears is a prophet God
[38:54] in flesh with a sign of discernment amen
[38:57] and the message to restore us back after
[38:59] that Isaac appeared that right so after
[39:02] this here we're looking for Jesus Christ
[39:03] to appear in the bride to appear to
[39:06] inform himself in her midst mold himself
[39:09] the perfect one amen and bring us to
[39:11] that praise God so you see now well let
[39:15] me read the scripture here if you want
[39:16] to write it down Romans
[39:19] 6:4 just to go back over here therefore
[39:23] we are buried with him by baptism into
[39:25] death that like as Christ was raised up
[39:27] from the dead by the glory of the father
[39:29] even so we also should walk in newness
[39:31] of life and uh witness uh Colossians
[39:35] 2:12 buried with him in baptism wherein
[39:40] also you are risen with him through the
[39:41] faith of the operation of God who hath
[39:44] raised him from the dead excuse me so
[39:47] when we go into him spiritually see we
[39:50] bured in there by faith see by faith now
[39:54] the same operation the same power God
[39:56] that raised Christ from The Dead We
[39:58] Believe will raise us from the dead in
[40:00] the newness of life then if we are a new
[40:04] creation a a new creature the old man
[40:08] was baptized and buried amen in Christ
[40:11] the old man's gone I mean he was
[40:14] immersed dipped in the anointing he's
[40:16] gone the whole man was amen but now his
[40:20] ways God left his ways here to stick you
[40:25] in other words God could have taken
[40:27] everything away when you went in see me
[40:30] now there would have been no
[40:32] test so he bur You by faith in there and
[40:36] you know that before the foundation of
[40:37] the world you are there you're gone see
[40:39] you are completely finished but he left
[40:42] your nature there to sick you to press
[40:45] you to his cross follow me now when you
[40:48] would you would not see talk about now
[40:50] so you got to stay at the cross until
[40:53] you are positionally placed by him see
[40:55] so there therefore this old nature
[40:58] sticks you when you want to do here
[41:00] because you can't do it see but there's
[41:02] coming a time when you go through those
[41:03] stages like all of us because going
[41:06] through the same stages you want to do
[41:07] thus and so but then he brings you out
[41:09] of milk and brings you into child
[41:12] training then you're on your way and
[41:14] thanks be to God that we're not in milk
[41:16] there's many millions still in milk but
[41:18] he called us out of milk amen am into
[41:21] child training in 63 praise our God
[41:24] that's that's what he did he called us
[41:25] out of the the tap this see and brought
[41:27] us into child into a place where the
[41:30] Holy Spirit the best tutor could come in
[41:33] the word even s the shepher dream this
[41:36] Workman here with this clear blue water
[41:37] that was the Holy Spirit in the whole
[41:39] church ages see and the last days it was
[41:42] the Holy Spirit himself pouring in this
[41:44] word this message into the bride and and
[41:47] Bubble Up all the dirt and filth and so
[41:48] forth see that's the Holy Spirit and
[41:51] then as he pours it into it he was
[41:53] waiting for the Capstone to come down
[41:56] with the shout follow me now and he
[41:59] comes down and sets himself at the head
[42:01] of the church first as the word mechanic
[42:04] then he comes right back as a spirit of
[42:06] Truth rise and Trail one more time and
[42:08] comes in in the dynamic and make those
[42:11] words worth amen praise our God see so
[42:15] now then when we come because from The
[42:18] Cross by faith we are to add to our
[42:23] faith virtue See Me Now patience and oh
[42:26] what because by faith now see now in
[42:29] order to do it we must stay at the cross
[42:31] and be crucified with him now I realize
[42:35] that this is not a popular
[42:37] Doctrine but God said speak it anyway so
[42:41] therefore I want to say what he tell me
[42:42] to say I realize that see but this
[42:45] message must get through and God will
[42:49] get it through the holy spirit will see
[42:52] man now so this is the word see so Paul
[42:55] says I have been uh let me read that
[42:58] littleit cuz galatian I'm just setting
[42:59] the background for what I'm getting
[43:00] ready to say here praise the
[43:03] Lord Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with
[43:07] Christ
[43:08] nevertheless I live now he talking about
[43:11] Christ here see he's Christ see I live
[43:15] yet not I because the old Paul Saul he's
[43:18] he he finished with he's been immersed
[43:20] into Christ see so therefore the eye who
[43:22] is living is Christ in him see but not I
[43:26] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[43:29] which I now live in the flesh in the
[43:31] body he lived the life in his body that
[43:34] was alive unto God and all of us want to
[43:36] get to that place and God's going to
[43:38] take you to that place that your body
[43:41] might live the same kind of life because
[43:43] brother brandham lived in the flesh

[43:58] sight your body is dead you follow me
[44:01] now and the only thing worth anything
[44:03] that will go up to the throne is when
[44:05] the spirit does something through you
[44:07] the rest of it is dead work you see mean
[44:09] now so and he's only looking at an
[44:12] adding come on he's only adding what
[44:14] Christ is doing through you see that's
[44:16] all the rest of it is wood stubing ha oh
[44:19] praise God so that's all it is and as
[44:22] you stay at the cross then the Holy
[44:24] Spirit comes in and wash through there
[44:26] and raises up brotherly kindness or
[44:29] whatever it is that's Christ the rest of
[44:31] it that's God doesn't even see that it's

[55:23] tested they come Bing here and tell
[55:25] people just read your seven Church age
[55:27] book you don't need any ministers but

[55:39] it say right here it says here uh uh and
[55:43] have put on a new man they haven't put
[55:44] on this new man yet which is renewed in
[55:47] knowledge see that's the old filthy of
[55:48] the world because so and so can't be
[55:50] saved and so forth natural brute Beast
[55:52] you know what I'm talking about after
[55:53] the image of him that because created
[55:55] him where there is neither Greek nor Jew
[55:58] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[56:00] Barbarian cynthian and they tell me that
[56:02] the C was the worst Savage of all and he
[56:05] could be saved that right see me now and
[56:08] here come these Devils coming around
[56:10] here talking about go here and go here
[56:12] those are there were Christian Devils if
[56:15] you want to call it that up on paper
[56:16] anointing them to say these evil things
[56:19] and here you stand right but what is it
[56:20] so you know where we're standing at
[56:22] we're standing on the word it is the
[56:23] spirit of Sal jealousy
[56:25] and David must go through with it
[56:27] otherwise he is not proven or tested
[56:30] child trained are you following me now
[56:32] and that's why we don't say nothing just
[56:33] let them go but one day God will pull
[56:35] them out of there and they still worship

[56:40] more Holy Ghost no more because no more
[56:42] that see they come right up to you tell
[56:44] you well brother Coman or brother H they
[56:46] should have done so and so that's the

[56:52] doesn't he walk up because right up in
[56:54] God's presence well he comes right in
[56:55] the presence of God where the word is

[56:59] here trying to pull you to because
[57:01] poison your face in the ministry and so
[57:03] forth and also one another see that's
[57:06] filth that's garbage turn off your
[57:08] receivers don't even listen to it get
[57:11] away from that evil spirit needs to
[57:13] repent see so therefore God ordained
[57:16] Saul Saul's Spirit he was anointed with
[57:19] a jealous spirit and that must come
[57:21] before David was ever placed that right
[57:24] so come against him and before he was
[57:26] placed as the king he had to go through
[57:29] Saul he said and he wouldn't do it he
[57:30] and brother he had Saul pinned down so
[57:32] many times you know what I'm talking
[57:33] about brother you got Saul pinned down
[57:35] this morning you can call Saul out
[57:37] everyone right now this morning see he's
[57:38] pinned down by the word of God by his
[57:41] own Spirit pinned him down see the made
[57:44] manifest in his flesh you see it he's
[57:46] pinned what you leave alone joab thought
[57:49] because cut his head off see let him
[57:51] alone see touch not God KN and do his
[57:54] Propet no har just let him go on see but
[57:56] now I was coming and when then David is
[57:58] is placed as the king and when he was
[58:00] placed as the king he was still rejected
[58:03] all right and oh sh kick dirt up on him
[58:05] see school of suffering coming praise
[58:08] our God right with the word just
[58:11] straight right down the line amen so now

[58:17] at well in closing when we are born
[58:20] again you come into a place of trying
[58:22] when you are born by the spirit of God
[58:24] when God has washed the world away from
[58:27] you completely and put a faith into your
[58:29] mental Faith where you where you hear
[58:31] the word of God he s Supernatural faith
[58:34] in it see and then you begin to add add

[59:01] Authority in you but it's not exercised
[59:03] yet until your place he's saving that

[59:09] has to change first until he take you
[59:11] out to the place out there and put on a
[59:12] robe on you see and so that's that
[59:15] that's right here see first what you're
[59:17] putting on now is this here put on the
[59:19] new man Colossians 3:10 all right which

[59:54] above all all these things put on
[59:55] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[59:58] now we are to add and there happens to
[1:00:01] be nine things here too but because we
[1:00:03] ought to add to our faith virtue and
[1:00:05] patience and so forth now we're putting

[1:03:24] then God must see these things in you a
[1:03:28] Blasphemous names here page 25 now when
[1:03:31] when Jesus had been up the obedient
[1:03:33] Jesus the god lamb to the dust God
[1:03:36] placed him positionally this is him see
[1:03:39] now when the member is born by the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost born by the Holy Ghost let their s
[1:03:46] now cuz there there are brothers out
[1:03:47] here teaching that there's no baptism
[1:03:50] and it says the prophets said born by
[1:03:52] the Holy Ghost see in to the family
[1:03:55] otherwise you'll never get in there see
[1:03:57] of God and has proven to have these
[1:04:00] virtues in him that God can look down
[1:04:04] and see virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:04:07] patience brotherly kindness and
[1:04:09] godliness in him then God seals him and
[1:04:12] places him there's a true baptism of the
[1:04:14] Holy Ghost and away he goes see it now
[1:04:17] friends see so they can't get it but God
[1:04:19] is bringing you to this see now we ought
[1:04:23] to at the cross waiting to be placed now
[1:04:28] we're speaking about a baptism of
[1:04:30] suffering now we were baptized into his
[1:04:31] death see but now positionally in God's
[1:04:35] mind see he has reckoned that we are
[1:04:37] dead and our sins are dead also
[1:04:39] everything is dead but see it is mind
[1:04:42] soul we are positioned by experience we
[1:04:47] must come to that place that he has
[1:04:49] already seen us come there and be
[1:04:51] glorified already but he's got to to
[1:04:54] bring us to that place and when you get
[1:04:57] there then the dve comes down because
[1:04:59] every corn of wheat before it goes into
[1:05:01] the ground is first
[1:05:03] gerti amen so therefore you must first
[1:05:06] be gerti then you're ready to go into
[1:05:10] the ground of the word of God to produce
[1:05:12] the life of Jesus Christ amen see now
[1:05:16] can I remember Hebrews um 5 in closing
[1:05:21] here Hebrews 57 I think it says here
[1:05:25] Hebrews
[1:05:28] 5:7 at or
[1:05:30] six as he saith also in another place
[1:05:33] thou art a priest Forever After The Art
[1:05:34] of mzc who in the days of his flesh when
[1:05:36] he had offered up prayers and
[1:05:37] supplications with strong crying and
[1:05:39] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:05:41] because from death and was heard in that
[1:05:43] he feared now watch though he were a son
[1:05:45] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:05:48] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:05:51] he became the author of Eternal
[1:05:53] salvation un to all them that obey him
[1:05:56] called of God the high priest after the
[1:05:57] order of Jesus Christ the perfect word
[1:06:01] perfect son right out he went with the
[1:06:05] dove up on him right and then he was
[1:06:06] positionally placed he ye him
[1:06:08] immediately cuz he almost went to his
[1:06:10] cross right so now watch yet though he
[1:06:13] was a son he still had to learn
[1:06:16] obedience other words he still had to
[1:06:20] prove that he what because obedience
[1:06:23] means
[1:06:24] Follow Me Now other words God knew
[1:06:27] because he was obedient I do nothing
[1:06:29] except the father show me see but Christ
[1:06:32] God rather wanted to prove to the world
[1:06:36] that his son will show the world what it
[1:06:38] means to be obedient to the will of God
[1:06:41] and on the cross he went he said I have
[1:06:44] a baptism to be baptized with and what
[1:06:46] he said over there in St Luke 126 that
[1:06:48] right he said because I have future a
[1:06:51] baptism to be baptized it was a baptism
[1:06:53] of suffering he had to be dipped into
[1:06:56] suffering on the cross are you following
[1:06:58] me friends I mean he had to be dipped
[1:07:00] into it because immersed in suffering on
[1:07:03] the cross see and he has this one
[1:07:05] because to be baptized with the early
[1:07:07] church because they went through it Paul
[1:07:09] went through it a brother BR we saw him
[1:07:11] go through it that right he was he went
[1:07:13] through suffering here even the song
[1:07:16] though I have suffered see it was a
[1:07:18] suffering but he never said nothing see
[1:07:20] me now and so therefore now I ain't
[1:07:23] saying because you have to die
[1:07:24] I don't mean that see but there's got to
[1:07:26] come an hour when we say we are the weak
[1:07:29] that right okay we've added and now we
[1:07:31] come up to Perfection but love is
[1:07:34] perfection so therefore love must unite
[1:07:36] all see you in now then prove what is
[1:07:41] obedience by the will of God then that
[1:07:45] seed must come up now watch everybody
[1:07:47] are waiting Hallelujah glory to God it's
[1:07:49] going to be a great big thing and so
[1:07:50] forth see but yet when it comes when
[1:07:52] Christ was crowned
[1:07:54] it was humbled on the cross that right
[1:07:57] in present stage of my Ministry because
[1:08:00] brother BR said I'm waiting to be
[1:08:01] crowned that right he was going on the
[1:08:03] cross see it now friends Paul and Peter
[1:08:07] now was waiting Peter want because to be
[1:08:09] crucified upside down See Me Now friends
[1:08:12] the other words those because because
[1:08:14] the disciples went out in the street and
[1:08:15] because they were beat for him
[1:08:16] everything that was their cross and we
[1:08:19] all got to have a cross but what God has
[1:08:21] been doing he's been child training you
[1:08:24] first see now then he brings you through
[1:08:27] uh the church here you know in here see
[1:08:29] and you're get the word because you're
[1:08:31] growing then he brings you up to a place
[1:08:33] and when he get you out there then he
[1:08:35] can send down his Divine love upon you
[1:08:37] and put on the Garment on you and then
[1:08:39] send you out see and out you go then
[1:08:41] you're led by the spirit the word breaks
[1:08:45] go over here say th stall just to give
[1:08:49] you a little illustration reath house
[1:08:51] did you ever read reath house you read
[1:08:53] it sometime R what a life back in 1900
[1:08:56] around there Ral England they accepted
[1:08:59] because custom was uh two could have a
[1:09:02] hat for an Englishman so re how because
[1:09:05] he had to go up to London the big city
[1:09:07] with because no hat now that may seem
[1:09:10] like nothing but in in that time while
[1:09:11] that was a sin if you didn't have a hand
[1:09:14] the father said take no hand and and
[1:09:16] where he went and then they laugh at him
[1:09:18] they mock him they scorn and this sounds
[1:09:19] because crazy you maybe but see it's
[1:09:22] things like that that you have to do you
[1:09:24] don't know simp put it's across you tell
[1:09:27] me now then you will prove what
[1:09:30] obedience really is cuz it the wheat
[1:09:34] must be proved that it is a
[1:09:36] wheat and it got to have the same life
[1:09:39] same signs same power amen see and it
[1:09:42] must come to that friend are you
[1:09:44] following me you getting me praise the
[1:09:47] lord well got to be mean it's going to
[1:09:50] be anyway because regardless of what we
[1:09:52] to say about it it will come to that see
[1:09:54] so therefore these little light
[1:09:57] afflictions in here child training
[1:10:00] that's all it is now this is only for
[1:10:03] the crucified one this is a separation
[1:10:06] PR so I just speak to you plain this
[1:10:08] morning this is the separation coming I
[1:10:11] knew that uh as Gody was moving on that
[1:10:13] there had to be a cross Ministry always
[1:10:15] was the cross Ministry crowned the
[1:10:18] ministry see brother Brown said on souls
[1:10:20] in prison he said in that Vision out
[1:10:22] west what happened he stood up there he
[1:10:23] says the glory that right the golden
[1:10:26] glory of the what cross flowed into his
[1:10:29] chest is that right see when he was
[1:10:31] placed because adopted in 63 there with
[1:10:33] the seven angels there but what happened
[1:10:35] he still come around to the Colorado
[1:10:37] experience When God says come and take a
[1:10:40] walk with me see so then he walked
[1:10:42] contrary to man's mind man said tent
[1:10:45] tent tent he walked with God see preach
[1:10:48] the word here went over there went over
[1:10:50] there went over there see Walking with
[1:10:52] God see and he said there when this walk
[1:10:54] with God he says that all fear left
[1:10:58] nothing there was nothing he told
[1:10:59] Brother Le he said Le I have no more
[1:11:01] fear all on perfect peace right here
[1:11:04] because in Colossians let God rule in
[1:11:06] your heart see that question rise up God
[1:11:11] see so therefore this is power when this
[1:11:15] power of the Holy Ghost that work that
[1:11:18] will because work in me and if it works
[1:11:22] in you there's no arguments you know
[1:11:24] it's
[1:11:25] God no arguments you me now it's the
[1:11:28] same power working in me if it work in
[1:11:30] you we one amen and then you see signs
[1:11:34] following that Hallelujah and watch the
[1:11:37] first thing that happens when you go on
[1:11:38] the cross the very first word as they
[1:11:41] was nailing Christ to the Cross wicked
[1:11:44] men nail him to the cross that right
[1:11:47] what was he saying now me and myself
[1:11:49] when I first come to the Lord I pictured
[1:11:51] myself back there and I wanted to go up
[1:11:53] there you and because of Flesh see and
[1:11:55] because F them see now you think about
[1:11:58] that and up on the cross and what did he
[1:11:59] say father forgive them perfect Divine
[1:12:04] love well then when the bride goes on
[1:12:06] her cross love must come see it's got to
[1:12:10] be there it meets you as you go there
[1:12:12] and perfect Divine love must come to the
[1:12:15] bride to uh because bind the whole thing
[1:12:18] together and then when the love comes
[1:12:20] then situation you don't know what they
[1:12:23] are but they're there then when you come
[1:12:25] to the situation love is up on you
[1:12:28] perfect love then he'll reach into the
[1:12:30] heart the nature and pull out Temperance
[1:12:33] didn't pull out patience then it will be
[1:12:35] a living faith a living patience a
[1:12:39] living Temperance a living knowledge
[1:12:41] rightly dividing every word of God see
[1:12:44] speaking to one another in wisdom and
[1:12:46] all things teaching one another sit now
[1:12:48] and singing cuz Grace is in your heart
[1:12:50] and you just singing praising God in
[1:12:52] hymns and songs and with joy boy that's
[1:12:54] what's coming friend yes sir it's coming
[1:12:56] to his bride and she'll move in the P of
[1:12:59] God anywhere not in here see mean
[1:13:03] outside where he where he want at his
[1:13:05] purpose he
[1:13:06] said multiply and replenish right
[1:13:09] naturally they were supposed to go out
[1:13:11] with because natural seed all over the
[1:13:13] Earth that right and he even separated
[1:13:15] because came from them go out will
[1:13:17] spiritually multiply and fill what
[1:13:20] through the mouth the gospel that right
[1:13:23] go over there go over there preach the
[1:13:24] gospel go over there go over there
[1:13:25] preach the gospel to the whole world see
[1:13:27] but didn't happen that we of course you
[1:13:28] know but that was his plan see me now
[1:13:30] multiply so therefore the Holy Spirit
[1:13:33] must come down through here the life
[1:13:36] living water come out of your mouth see
[1:13:38] and it goes out that must come and it
[1:13:40] will come do you believe that friends do
[1:13:43] you love us do you understand excuse me
[1:13:47] what the Lord is trying to do now he's
[1:13:50] trying to bring us to a place and I have
[1:13:52] a note here about that there and uh that
[1:13:55] is is is is the actual experience you
[1:13:58] know the birthright produces the word is
[1:14:02] that right each first son had the birth
[1:14:05] right to produce the word that's why
[1:14:07] because Jacob fought for it hope they
[1:14:10] get that other words just by birth now
[1:14:13] they were supposed to because carried on
[1:14:15] the seat on down that right the first
[1:14:17] son was see so therefore when Jacob saw
[1:14:20] it happened there was because a switch
[1:14:21] there and therefore he because he for
[1:14:23] for it and he took the birth right and
[1:14:25] then he passed on the line amen see so
[1:14:28] we have the birth right see therefore we
[1:14:30] will be to do Christ cuz you got the
[1:14:33] birth you must do it you'll do it him
[1:14:37] the wait till the father take you there
[1:14:39] amen see yes now um see the son was born
[1:14:44] years ago before see but his character
[1:14:47] because his conduct was in question see
[1:14:50] so now he takes you us through child
[1:14:55] training to mold our character because
[1:14:58] because conduct as we go through this
[1:15:01] child right here you see what is before
[1:15:04] you yourself you see who has character
[1:15:07] you look you see yourself you see what
[1:15:09] is it in the person's heart what they
[1:15:11] desire you see it if they desire Christ
[1:15:14] you see that they're walking that way if
[1:15:16] they want something in the world here
[1:15:18] you see it also you don't have to say
[1:15:20] nothing you see it it's made manifest
[1:15:23] for right before you then you can do
[1:15:25] nothing because yourself see so
[1:15:27] therefore it's his character cuz which
[1:15:29] we're speaking about now when he comes
[1:15:31] to a certain place because in closing he
[1:15:34] should go to another office that God has
[1:15:38] up the cordain for him and this office
[1:15:41] over here say is to meet the the crisis
[1:15:44] of the hour the world coner now he's got
[1:15:47] to get the bride to a place here's the
[1:15:49] World Council moving here right the
[1:15:51] bride should be right here he's got got
[1:15:53] to bring her to that place so when they
[1:15:55] come here in that office it'll be Christ
[1:15:58] hear me now he'll have her there but he
[1:16:01] can't get of there until character is
[1:16:03] molded first through child training
[1:16:05] because I hope you see that amen then
[1:16:07] you who have been deep down in here by
[1:16:10] spirit thank God God has been sh and the
[1:16:15] others who beat you down see with
[1:16:17] evilness and so forth they've been used
[1:16:19] by God to crush you see so thank the
[1:16:23] Lord for the crushing thank him for the
[1:16:26] crushing for they had the spirit of Soul
[1:16:28] upon them not Even's an KN KN it they
[1:16:29] crushing you down Evil all the time and
[1:16:32] mean and so forth cring you God's
[1:16:34] bringing out anything lovely kindness
[1:16:37] patience with God and with them see
[1:16:39] holding back and you could say a word
[1:16:42] here you leave them alone you won't say
[1:16:43] nothing see now and just pray prayer
[1:16:45] Venture God would turn them around and
[1:16:47] Grant them because repentant realize
[1:16:49] that they've gone off the word see now
[1:16:50] I'm just scking plain this morning may I
[1:16:52] see like this again but I got to see PL
[1:16:54] D this morning because it's winding up
[1:16:56] see we know something six going to
[1:16:58] happen so you might have know where you
[1:16:59] stand see and so therefore so you will
[1:17:02] know good that it's been child training
[1:17:04] in high school here so to speak you're
[1:17:06] ready to go into college a school of
[1:17:09] special obedience that's a special
[1:17:11] school there me now special obedience
[1:17:15] where you are his beloved so he wants to
[1:17:18] because glorify himself through you and
[1:17:21] he's his glory is the world knows
[1:17:23] nothing about it they don't even
[1:17:24] understand it it's always opposite see
[1:17:27] me now so I say to you it'll be humble
[1:17:31] it'll be Christ it'll be divine love see
[1:17:34] but it'll be here you believe that that
[1:17:36] friend praise God it'll be here see so
[1:17:39] therefore um it'll be the word made
[1:17:43] flesh in you now how will he do it it
[1:17:46] says over in Romans 811 if the spirit
[1:17:48] that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[1:17:50] dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken
[1:17:54] not your dead body your moral body I
[1:17:58] hope you see that the moral body that's
[1:18:00] living here Quicken it say now you want
[1:18:02] to obey every word and through because
[1:18:06] child training because you've been
[1:18:07] baptized you come out of the world and
[1:18:09] you have gotten rid of the television
[1:18:10] now that you can do by yourself see mean
[1:18:13] now but only Christ can live through you
[1:18:16] so you can do that by yourself see
[1:18:18] because uh the old Hebrews did that
[1:18:20] because back there they were Sanctified
[1:18:22] unto God just because because like in
[1:18:24] their own self you see now so we can do
[1:18:26] all these things because a sister can
[1:18:28] she can absolutely come out of the world
[1:18:30] if she wants to see me now then sit
[1:18:33] there and then let God add to you to
[1:18:35] experience experience and adding and
[1:18:38] adding then when you get up to a point
[1:18:40] where he where because you have showed a
[1:18:42] brotherly kindness and patience and so
[1:18:44] forth he see it there and I don't make
[1:18:46] believe now it's there cuz you've been
[1:18:48] through actual experiences see me now
[1:18:51] there a certain time he sends down the
[1:18:53] Capstone caps it off then what's in
[1:18:56] there he pulls it out by his Divine love
[1:18:59] the spirit must come to the word to make
[1:19:01] the word work and there's the word with
[1:19:03] the nature of God in it but it needs the
[1:19:05] fullness of God up on it and the way it
[1:19:07] goes and puts on this outter garment
[1:19:10] that makes him A well-dressed man it is
[1:19:12] the finishing touch amen this is
[1:19:16] perfection itself but because it is
[1:19:18] perfect and it's a perfect corn of wheat
[1:19:20] it got to be proved got to be proved
[1:19:22] that there is inside of it what it say
[1:19:24] it is and only way it can happen is to
[1:19:26] bring a certain situation situation
[1:19:28] comes you say nothing except God say the
[1:19:31] Lord and you'll stand there and then you
[1:19:33] see in God he'll be smiling down you
[1:19:35] tell the devil get back that's me
[1:19:39] walking on two things God coming
[1:19:42] suddenly to his Temple he's coming you
[1:19:45] his Temple he's building you into a
[1:19:48] place where he will come suddenly you
[1:19:50] don't have to be in here you can be home
[1:19:52] watching in the is this be up in the
[1:19:54] attic amen be up anywhere am but God is
[1:19:58] going to visit the crucified one those
[1:20:01] who will forsake the World by experience
[1:20:06] see me now you got to come to experience
[1:20:08] now forsake the love of the world the
[1:20:11] pride of life and the lust of the world
[1:20:13] here the lust of life just forsake the
[1:20:15] whole thing and then fling to the cross
[1:20:18] and stay there and then let the
[1:20:20] resurrection power of God work through
[1:20:23] and if it's a true servant he takes it
[1:20:25] to the St you believe that let's Worship
[1:20:28] the Lord a little bit Rock of Ages page
[1:20:29] 81 I believe it is I love the
[1:20:34] Lord and knowing that he first loved me
[1:20:38] amen I couldn't be at this point here
[1:20:40] just think friends that he would elect
[1:20:44] us the elected of God I mean we couldn't
[1:20:48] do it ourselves to come to this place
[1:20:51] and just stay fa faithful with the word
[1:20:53] through 66 67 68 3 years that's all all
[1:20:59] it's been but so much has happened I
[1:21:01] know it all kind of things could happen
[1:21:04] nevertheless we don't say it's got to be
[1:21:07] this year but this I know they they are
[1:21:09] predicting that there's supposed to be a
[1:21:11] great earthquake April the 669 there's
[1:21:13] two say everybody saying see I don't
[1:21:15] know but that is brother Brown's
[1:21:17] birthday and by the way um I told you
[1:21:21] that a brother down in Florida had had
[1:21:23] told to Baron about April 14th but that
[1:21:26] was wrong because I don't know because
[1:21:27] what he meant by that but because I
[1:21:29] checked it out and spoke to the rabbi in
[1:21:32] the Fel and so um I asked him about
[1:21:34] because the Passover and he told me that
[1:21:36] say April 3D and that's odd because this
[1:21:39] the April 3rd which it happens to be a
[1:21:42] Thursday see and
[1:21:44] Friday's is Good Friday of course
[1:21:46] because Easter is April the 6th so 3 4 5
[1:21:49] and 6 come back together again see so
[1:21:51] there something odd about it
[1:21:53] and we don't know this I might drop this
[1:21:55] off to you just keep this in mind um
[1:21:59] we're looking for the resurrection of
[1:22:00] course see now we know that before the
[1:22:03] coming of the Lord there's to be a great
[1:22:04] earthquake that's what he said see now
[1:22:06] we don't know this what he means he mean
[1:22:09] before he comes in the air himself so
[1:22:11] you got to take every point of it see
[1:22:13] will it be the earthquake then before
[1:22:15] you go into Rapture or his coming in the
[1:22:18] resurrection see or the part of his
[1:22:20] coming that's hi to the bride
[1:22:23] which is coming now they going to forget
[1:22:24] because he had a two-fold Ministry he
[1:22:26] had one Ministry on the earth and one
[1:22:29] where he rose for 40 days that's right
[1:22:31] and resurrection power in that Ministry
[1:22:34] he came straight on the word for about 6
[1:22:37] hours to his disciples be because going
[1:22:38] down the mail that right straight on the
[1:22:40] way old fool a slow heart to believe all
[1:22:42] the word that has been written already
[1:22:44] see talk right now and it behov that he
[1:22:46] had to suffer for this sake and so he
[1:22:48] went on say now will he come that way to
[1:22:50] the bride head that was a hi Ministry
[1:22:53] the world didn't see that Ministry there
[1:22:54] no only the bride saw that Ministry so
[1:22:57] therefore Acts 1:3 says that he showed
[1:23:00] himself
[1:23:03] alive amen those who are dead in Christ
[1:23:07] and who who they have been be crucified
[1:23:09] in there dipped in his anointing their
[1:23:12] lives are HID in there he is to appear
[1:23:15] will he appear to them with his life
[1:23:17] amen see in that same Ministry he also
[1:23:20] showed them many because because
[1:23:21] infallible proof that right that he was
[1:23:24] aive see and he spoke things pertaining
[1:23:28] to the kingdom of God see and he
[1:23:31] also breathed upon him he also placed
[1:23:35] him 10 them out in a hidden Ministry now
[1:23:39] you think on that see me know that's in
[1:23:41] the word see or will it be the actual
[1:23:44] Resurrection which the world still won't
[1:23:46] see it only the bride will see them for
[1:23:48] we're told by God's Prophet when the
[1:23:50] dead in Christ appear to the bride if a
[1:23:52] sign at the raptures that hand but he
[1:23:55] said the prophet said there's got to be
[1:23:57] a Ministry on the earth that Christ can
[1:24:01] come down and set in there with the same
[1:24:04] sign same life same Ministry to call up
[1:24:07] the dead now which is which so therefore
[1:24:09] will that if that is to be I don't know
[1:24:11] see well will that be a secret if it's a
[1:24:15] secret Ministry the world won't even
[1:24:17] know it neither will people in the
[1:24:19] message don't even I hope you caught
[1:24:21] that they won't even know because he'll
[1:24:23] come only to the bride by vision and
[1:24:26] he'll show her the word the spirit of
[1:24:28] truth will show it to her by vision and
[1:24:30] it'll take what has been spoken on the T
[1:24:32] and so forth in the Bible and bring it
[1:24:33] to her to her memory and then show her
[1:24:36] things to come and then she'll go out
[1:24:38] she'll walk somewhere maybe see and
[1:24:40] here's a person here false Christ
[1:24:42] standing up here glory to God hallelujah
[1:24:44] God said this is a devil and then she'll
[1:24:45] say
[1:24:46] nothing see and this person will blast
[1:24:49] him against you
[1:24:50] he I will
[1:24:53] I hope you follow me I'm trying to give
[1:24:54] a little hint see of what uh um see from
[1:24:58] what was in God's Prophet life he told
[1:25:01] he walk out there here was one man
[1:25:02] prophesying another man prophesying he
[1:25:05] he had a little gift you
[1:25:06] know this man took us say he was a devil
[1:25:09] see the other man was genuine Christian
[1:25:12] but he knew he he on know the word is
[1:25:16] coming friends Hebrews 4:12 sharper pord
[1:25:19] to the Joint Pastor Mars goes in to goes
[1:25:23] beyond the Flesh and goes into the
[1:25:26] spirit and picks up that Spirit there
[1:25:28] and flashes across on the screen out
[1:25:30] right before you and there you see it
[1:25:32] see everything is naked before him
[1:25:34] that's coming you believe that friend
[1:25:36] well then let us die to ourselves as we
[1:25:39] approach this year
[1:25:41] 69 and be one of these because crucified
[1:25:45] ones was going to take these because
[1:25:47] crucified one to be raised in the power
[1:25:49] of his resurrection to to to prove this
[1:25:52] ministry that's been spoken and so shall
[1:25:55] it be there's going to be a bride
[1:25:56] ministry here it's got to be it's got to
[1:25:59] be since the camp room comes down and
[1:26:00] sets himself at the headen there and
