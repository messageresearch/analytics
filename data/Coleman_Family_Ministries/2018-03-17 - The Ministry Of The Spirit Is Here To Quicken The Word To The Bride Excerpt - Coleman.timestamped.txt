[2:10] we had to wait 33 years and 10 months
[2:11] but we're more than able to take it Lord
[2:17] our God with bending all the time
[2:19] and God had to give us a New York
[2:22] evidence after evidence after evidence

[4:21] forward
[4:28] the son of man the new land the promised
[4:33] land was the land of promise in Word
[4:38] form every promise of Malick half spoke
[4:46] was the new land and somebody with a
[4:49] revelation had to catch it and preach it
[4:55] that's why the anointing was always
[4:58] there because it was a new land
