[0:01] so we're waiting to be stimulated by the
[0:04] revelation of Jesus Christ the
[0:07] revelation of the Capstone Revelation
[0:10] all the things that we know is true we
[0:11] can't explain it but that Revelation
[0:14] that Capstone Dynamic love will sit down
[0:18] in the bride and all of a sudden just be
[0:20] open to her and she'll know all about it
[0:22] and all the threatening the worrying and
[0:24] the fighting and the all be over you

[0:31] spirit amen quick and Made Alive we have
[0:34] the virtue we have the patience we have
[0:38] the knowledge it's growing of course we
[0:41] have the brotherly kindness but see uh
[0:44] we don't have the strength of those
[0:46] things yet the love is see love is the
[0:50] strength of these attributes that makes
[0:52] it live amen so we are but now we're
[0:55] taking on these things by faith amen by
[0:58] faith see you don't feel it you don't
[1:00] see it that's right cuz when a man wants
[1:02] to exercise he takes his barbells begins
[1:06] to exercise you don't see it the first
[1:08] day the muscles but you keep at it you
[1:10] keep at it till finally the muscles just
[1:13] grow out where we take the The Virtue
[1:16] and we begin to exercise it patience
[1:18] exercise you got to get into it amen
[1:20] you'll fail you fall down you get up but
[1:23] exercise it in your patience exercise in
[1:26] it and then one day the strength of it
[1:29] love of God
[1:30] will come down you see a living faith a
[1:32] living patience a living brotherly kind
[1:35] it'll live amen praise our god well let
[1:39] us turn to the word of the Lord I feel
[1:41] good this morning just talking about the
[1:44] Lord and the promise of
[1:47] God now I don't want to be long with you
[1:50] and I'm trying to I could hold down this
[1:53] year amen but
[1:56] uh but I trust that maybe some uh
[2:00] understand what we've been trying to do
[2:02] and can sit a little bit longer praise
[2:04] the Lord uh 2 Corinthians the 4th
[2:11] chapter verse
[2:17] 1-4 Ephesians 5:30 if you're writing
[2:20] them
[2:28] down I'm read from second Corinthians
[2:31] the 4th
[2:37] chapter therefore seeing we have this
[2:41] ministry as we have received Mercy we
[2:44] faint
[2:45] not but have renounced the hidden things
[2:48] of dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[2:52] nor haing the word of God
[2:54] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[2:57] truth commending ourselves to Every
[3:00] Man's conscience in the sight of
[3:02] God but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[3:06] to them that are lost in whom the God of
[3:08] this world hath blinded the minds of
[3:12] them which believe not lest the light of
[3:16] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[3:19] image of God should shine unto
[3:22] them for we preach not ourselves but
[3:25] Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[3:28] servants for Jes J sake for God who
[3:32] commanded the light to shine out the
[3:34] darkness hath shine in in our hearts to
[3:38] give the light of the knowledge of the
[3:40] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[3:44] but we have this treasure in Earth and
[3:48] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[3:52] may be of God and not of
[3:55] us we are troubled on every side yet not
[3:59] distressed
[4:00] we are perplexed but not in despair
[4:04] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[4:07] but not destroy it always bearing about
[4:10] in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus
[4:14] that the life also of Jesus might be
[4:16] made manifest in our body for we live
[4:20] for we which live are always delivered
[4:24] unto death for jesus' sake that the life
[4:27] also of Jesus might be made manifest EST
[4:30] in our mortal
[4:32] flesh so then death worketh in us but
[4:36] life in you we have the same Spirit of
[4:40] Faith according as it is written I
[4:43] believed and therefore have I spoken we
[4:47] also believe and therefore speak knowing
[4:50] that he which raised up the Lord Jesus
[4:54] shall raise up us also by Jesus and
[4:57] shall present us with you Ephesians
[5:04] 5:30 for we are members of his body of
[5:09] his flesh and of his bones may God the
[5:12] blessing and reading of his word I like
[5:14] to title this thought this morning the
[5:16] word made
[5:19] flesh uh just to recap from Friday
[5:23] afternoon got a little inspiration and
[5:25] was speaking about the vacant chair I
[5:29] was speaking about the vacant chair
[5:31] which is the chair of
[5:33] honor and Christ has not been able to
[5:37] sit in his own due chair of Honor among
[5:41] all of us as
[5:42] yet but he did set in his chair of Honor
[5:45] in the early
[5:46] church and there he sat in the midst of
[5:49] his people because he was right they
[5:51] allowed him to come into their hearts
[5:54] with no ideas no opinions no
[5:58] imaginations
[5:59] but just Jesus Christ the word of God
[6:03] into their
[6:04] hearts St Matthew 28:18 says all power
[6:09] in Heaven and Earth is given unto me so
[6:12] I was speaking about Friday about his
[6:15] lordship he's the the lord of the Earth
[6:18] the Lord of Heaven but uh due to the
[6:22] spirit of iniquity the spirit of
[6:26] unbelief God's Jesus Christ's lordship
[6:30] is not always able to be to be made
[6:32] manifest in the people cuz a spirit of
[6:36] unbelief would work through there and
[6:38] won't allow the word of God to be the
[6:41] Lord of all in his people but God had an
[6:46] early
[6:46] church that he burned every thought out
[6:49] of them by the word for peter said thou
[6:53] alone has has the words of eternal life
[6:56] Hallelujah they were died out think of
[6:59] these people now they were they had they
[7:02] were already saved they were God's
[7:04] people already that's what we can't
[7:06] understand today the Gentiles had to
[7:08] have the spirit in them to be God's
[7:10] people but they were God's people by the
[7:13] word right therefore they were already
[7:15] the wheat word because
[7:17] already and all he had to do was to
[7:20] ripen them himself with his presence to
[7:22] form a rain and then he went and then
[7:26] his lordship was able God was able able
[7:29] to come into their hearts and sit in the
[7:33] vacant chair in the fullness of his holy
[7:37] spirit then that made it possible these
[7:40] people made it possible for his lordship
[7:43] to be effective on the Earth as it was
[7:47] in heaven am though he was rejected by
[7:50] the Pharisees and so forth yet he was
[7:53] reigning in
[7:55] Jerusalem Amen in the apostles in the
[7:58] saints of God there in Jerusalem and
[8:01] also points beyond that Christ had come
[8:04] into
[8:05] them so therefore um but some came in
[8:10] like ananas and saf and didn't know that
[8:13] he was reigning in the
[8:15] church sad to say they didn't they
[8:18] thought it was just Peter himself or
[8:20] James and John and the people there or
[8:22] Steven and so forth they didn't realize
[8:25] that these people were died out to the
[8:28] world they were one in purpose they were
[8:32] one in spirit amen they were one in life
[8:36] they were one in desire they were one
[8:39] with God hallelujah amen and anas and
[8:42] safire didn't have that
[8:45] Revelation because and these Saints
[8:47] being one with God had a revelation that
[8:50] they should sell all that they had by
[8:54] Revelation they had that and when you
[8:56] get it by Revelation then you give it
[8:59] from your heart am but an and saf didn't
[9:03] have a revelation therefore they could
[9:05] not sell all at the head they had to
[9:08] keep back part of the price because they
[9:10] didn't have a
[9:11] revelation amen amen but but the rest of
[9:14] them had a revelation Hallelujah that he
[9:17] was the Lord that he owned their houses
[9:19] he owned them he owned their minds he
[9:21] owned their bodies he owned their
[9:23] Spirits he own everything they had for
[9:25] they gave it to him cuz they had a
[9:27] revelation yes my Lord glory to God that
[9:31] he was the Lord on the earth for all
[9:34] power was in his hands and they gladly
[9:37] gave of their substance to him but sad
[9:40] to say ananas and Safar didn't have a
[9:42] revelation so they walked in there well
[9:45] Peter he's ignorant fisherman and so
[9:47] forth he won't know what we're doing so
[9:50] therefore we'll give just because a part
[9:52] of the price he won't know the
[9:54] difference they didn't know that the
[9:56] Christ was sitting on the throne in
[9:58] Peter's heart
[10:00] think of it the invisible
[10:03] God God
[10:05] Almighty was hid in Peter's heart and
[10:10] when an and fire walked up there they
[10:12] were looking at
[10:13] Peter a fisherman ignant unlearned they
[10:18] didn't see Jesus Christ in Peter's heart
[10:21] who was sitting on the throne and when
[10:23] he walked up Peter spoke out God
[10:27] speaking directly from Heaven used
[10:29] Peter's vocal cords say you have lied to
[10:32] the Holy Ghost me and
[10:35] here and then of course judgment fell
[10:38] upon Him Summary Court Marshal struck
[10:40] him on the spot see when Christ comes in
[10:43] it'll be Summary Court Marshal not to
[10:46] have a trial and go to jail and so forth
[10:48] uhuh right on the spot you're judge
[10:50] right on the spot see so therefore they
[10:54] didn't know that but nevertheless that's
[10:57] how he purified the early church
[11:00] because he was there and when they saw
[11:03] that and now it's been the the the time
[11:08] of by faith telling the people he's here
[11:12] some of them realizing that he really is
[11:14] here in New York my God and fear comes
[11:18] upon Him Rens comes upon him but the
[11:21] others oh that's brother Coman there I
[11:22] can lie to him cuz he doesn't know I'll
[11:25] call up so and so and tell him this we
[11:27] could tell him that that's brother
[11:28] Hunted
[11:29] they don't realize that's the word
[11:32] that's there therefore don't look at me
[11:34] look at Jesus Christ the word of God
[11:37] he's the one who sees you in your bed
[11:40] chamber on your job in your home he's
[11:43] the one who's looking at you his eyes go
[11:46] to and fro throughout the whole world he
[11:49] knows every secret crevice in our
[11:52] hearts don't have fear of me I'm a man
[11:55] I'm a meat man Flesh and Blood have fear
[11:59] of of the spirit of the God of all
[12:02] Spirits amen that's we we need fear
[12:05] again fear of God and reverence in the
[12:08] church see so that church had a
[12:11] revelation that God was sitting on the
[12:14] throne and therefore they turned the
[12:16] world upside down cuz they had a
[12:19] revelation what about today brother if
[12:22] we had the same Revelation the church
[12:25] would be on fire that's
[12:27] right but when there is a breakr the
[12:30] breakdown rather the ministry
[12:33] today and the people themselves and the
[12:36] ministers not allowing the authority of
[12:39] the lordship to occupy the Cher of Honor
[12:43] in our hearts and that's why we don't
[12:45] have the same thing but God's got a few
[12:48] Jesus amen oh yeah he always has a
[12:51] witness that have D out these past few
[12:55] years and they are allowing the
[12:58] headstone Hallelujah the lordship the
[13:01] Lord from glory to come into their heart
[13:04] by the spoken word through the pulpit
[13:07] agreeing with the written word
[13:09] hallelujah he's coming in and the Holy
[13:11] Spirit of them is agreeing right back
[13:13] with it and they're growing in spiritual
[13:15] maturity all the others are sitting
[13:17] around that's a man that's a man that's
[13:20] that's brother Coleman that's brother
[13:22] Hunt they don't catch it but see he's
[13:25] maturing but brother we're looking for
[13:28] this year any time when he will be
[13:32] matured oh brother better get to the
[13:35] hills then he will be matured and then
[13:40] if his word is
[13:42] matured then the fullness of the godhead
[13:46] bodily can come right in here this
[13:48] assembly here and sit down here in this
[13:51] Pulpit here and his eyes go all
[13:54] discernment into everybody's heart and
[13:57] then one thing out of place he'll call
[13:59] it right out Hallelujah cuz he can't
[14:01] stand it my God cuz he's a holy God Hall
[14:04] not now I'm not talking about uh uh the
[14:07] dress not down neatly I'm talking about
[14:09] in the heart I don't mean the dress or
[14:11] the earring I don't mean that I'm
[14:13] talking what's in the people's hearts is
[14:16] what he will call out so now this
[14:19] morning friends let us not fear see let
[14:22] us uh with uh Godly love and let us long
[14:27] for this here well we all want to be in
[14:29] the apostolic church we all say so Lord
[14:32] take us back to the old Landmark well
[14:34] here it is here's the old Landmark
[14:36] Hallelujah now how many want to come
[14:38] down to the
[14:39] water praise our God hallelujah 32,000
[14:43] give me the water when it put him to the
[14:46] word test 22,000 went
[14:48] away and then the rest even come on down
[14:51] anyway Hallelujah to drink the water but
[14:55] some wanted to to squat down on the
[14:57] knees so delicately like King AAG surely
[15:01] the misery of death is over surely you
[15:03] stop preaching so hard King AAG you know
[15:07] what I mean now Samuel didn't think so
[15:09] brother Samuel say sa why didn't you
[15:11] kill that
[15:12] flesh well I thought maybe you like the
[15:14] best of it you know and Samuel pulled
[15:17] out that sword and hacked him into
[15:19] pieces yeah that's right the king's word
[15:24] so they come on down to the water he
[15:26] says mark them and seal those who slide
[15:28] into the water and lap it up like a dog
[15:31] praise our god do we have any dog
[15:34] lappers who love the word of God this
[15:37] morning we'll slide in
[15:40] now for the water is good amen praise
[15:44] our God that's a little type you know to
[15:46] get you understand what I'm talking
[15:47] about amen amen so now we see then
[15:50] that I trust that we won't have any
[15:53] ananas and safiras in New York City cuz
[15:57] I I I I'm hoping the word has been
[15:59] preached enough to give us all sitting
[16:03] here children also and understanding
[16:06] what had God is fixed and ready to do so
[16:09] there really shouldn't be any you
[16:11] without
[16:12] excuse every one of us for the word of
[16:15] God has been proclaimed here for eight
[16:17] years exactly this same Apostolic
[16:20] Ministry has been spoken right through
[16:21] here to warn us to exalt us to get us
[16:24] ready for the coming of the Lord friends
[16:28] this is not the acceptable year of the
[16:30] Lord that was the first coming this is
[16:32] the second coming the
[16:34] judgment and judgment must begin in his
[16:37] house and this is his house so he'll
[16:40] Purge his house out Hallelujah from the
[16:43] uncircumcised in heart from the Heretics
[16:46] and so forth the worldly ones he purge
[16:48] them right out amen see so now um so I
[16:52] trust that we won't have any ananis and
[16:55] saf fireing here but that's why I'm
[16:57] preaching the way I'm preaching so we
[16:59] won't have any I could uh be like some
[17:02] of the because under the Shepherds and
[17:05] the uh scribes and because Pharisees and
[17:08] bring you a nice sweet message and take
[17:10] you up into the spirit wonderful sing a
[17:12] song that's it but we preach in judgment
[17:15] the word of God Amen but I trust and
[17:18] pray that we'll be like Queen
[17:20] Esther amen Esther believe in her
[17:23] Destiny Hallelujah and she did what she
[17:26] could to save Israel amen Mori said to
[17:30] her and who knoweth whether Thou Art
[17:32] come to the kingdom for such a time as
[17:35] this and who knows this morning whether
[17:37] we here for such a time as this here to
[17:40] be his
[17:41] bride we we are predestinated to be
[17:44] there somebody is hallelujah but Esther
[17:48] had the faith and when and when Mori the
[17:52] prophet told her what she was there for
[17:55] then cuz you weren't supposed to go into
[17:57] the king without him sending for you but
[18:01] she had to go in there she said well
[18:03] tell everybody to fast three days and
[18:05] three nights and I myself and my Maids
[18:08] will Fast also and so I will go into the
[18:11] king and what is not according to the
[18:13] law if I perish I
[18:16] perish so as we Face
[18:19] 1971 if we perish we perish but let us
[18:23] prepare to walk into his anointing his
[18:26] presence that's what we're here for
[18:28] otherwise might as well stay home amen
[18:30] have the attitude Lord if I perish I
[18:32] perish but Lord God let me come amen
[18:35] pray that you be counted worthy
[18:37] Hallelujah to stand in the presence of
[18:39] the son of man pray that you be counted
[18:42] worthy Hallelujah for his word came
[18:45] forth through a prophet and mercy but
[18:47] his presence is coming down his word is
[18:51] his presence hidden in invisible
[18:54] life that's now but the visible
[18:59] word made flesh in manifestation of
[19:01] every word of God comes out and that's
[19:04] his presence right there quicker than
[19:06] every word amen so
[19:09] now we SE in that for such a time as
[19:12] this here are we finally sold out to
[19:15] this world I mean the Malachi form
[19:19] message has been preached and put on
[19:22] tape prophesied and on the tape and now
[19:25] God has let us sit here for 5 years to
[19:28] see every word coming true for 5 years
[19:32] the message in Prophecy so he he other
[19:35] words it was to be in Prophecy that it
[19:38] had to happen after he was gone so we
[19:41] could see every day things happen that
[19:43] he sent amen he spoke about cigarettes
[19:46] he said it'll be a time when it'll be
[19:49] unlawful
[19:51] 1971 had come to past just
[19:53] month the cigarette advertisement so
[19:56] forth is unlawful now they have stopped
[19:58] it
[19:59] the Prophet prophesied this many years
[20:02] ago that's the word becoming flesh and
[20:06] when the bride sees that made manifest
[20:09] it just goes up again her faith just
[20:11] mounts up amen he spoke it here it is 19
[20:15] January 1971 he said it would be and
[20:18] here it is now that's the kind of word
[20:21] I'm talking about not coming in here and
[20:23] glory to God and shouting and crying and
[20:25] so forth I talk see that word being made
[20:28] manifest amen that's what gives the
[20:29] bride
[20:30] Joy amen so now are we finally sold out
[20:34] to the world as we enter
[20:38] 1971 have we taken our Nazarite vows for
[20:42] 1971 amen amen see because here was to
[20:46] Samson was a Nazarite vow and here to a
[20:51] woman is a Nazarite vow
[20:53] also and a Nazarite is one that is
[20:55] consecrated for a purpose to and because
[20:58] two of a purpose and Samson was
[21:00] consecrated to an age that he lived in
[21:04] and to a purpose therefore he had long
[21:06] hair and a woman that's a child of
[21:09] God lets a hair grow to show that she's
[21:12] consecrated to every word of
[21:14] God then the bride to show her
[21:18] consecration for Christ is her glory
[21:21] Christ is her head see she simply
[21:24] believes the word and lets every word to
[21:26] hear grow out in her heart amen every
[21:29] word of it to show she is consecrated to
[21:32] him through the word of God am and the
[21:35] old husband the
[21:37] world they can't get
[21:39] that this nature is your old
[21:44] husband and with those who play around
[21:46] in the world is slopping and kissing and
[21:51] swapping and committing fornication with
[21:54] the other
[21:55] husband do you see it amen do you
[21:58] understand why we belch out and cry out
[22:02] you're committing fornication right now
[22:05] as long as you desire the love of the
[22:07] old husband his kisses are
[22:10] sweeter so they love it but she's dead
[22:15] while she
[22:16] liveth the woman that lives in worldly
[22:18] pleasure with her old
[22:20] husband amen but the
[22:24] Bri she is consecrated to Christ the
[22:29] word and she proves it by living every
[22:33] word and he only told her the past 5
[22:35] years to come out of the world that's
[22:38] all he didn't lay any greater burden up
[22:39] on us come out of the world he there's
[22:41] nothing going on here we got good jobs
[22:43] and homes and food cars and everything
[22:45] what else they tell us to do I don't
[22:47] know maybe you do amen amen just come
[22:51] out of the world and stop the the things
[22:53] of the denominational spirits and so
[22:55] forth see so therefore the Nazar vow
[22:59] show that she's vow to God so therefore
[23:02] she's like uh the other one there um
[23:07] Rebecca I will go she never saw before
[23:12] neither do

[45:23] and and puzzled say who is this amen
[45:27] it's the Lord Of Glory coming in there
[45:30] amen amen praise
[45:33] God so now Christ was the mechanics and
[45:37] his father was the Dynamics to spark off
[45:39] the word of God that's what's wrong we
[45:42] we've been lacking the Dynamics power to
[45:44] press the word and make it live and
[45:48] here's a thought here from Brother
[45:49] brandom here from the same tape it's
[45:52] time the church should be fully grown
[45:55] now ready to go meet Christ with the
[45:58] manifestation of Every
[46:00] Blessing he promised in the Bible
[46:03] operating in that one great body where
[46:05] he promised to meet the people that's
[46:07] what he said in 65 that's what he said
[46:10] that we should be outside in the church
[46:13] here ready to meet him and he is coming
[46:16] forth in the
[46:18] resurrection and you we have to be ready
[46:19] to meet him when he comes forth cuz he
[46:22] got to sit down in his in his word and
[46:25] bring up the resurrection
[46:27] amen Ephesians 1:10 all the things in
[46:30] heaven he bring with him and the things
[46:32] in heaven is the water the spirit and
[46:34] the blood amen and the original cor
[46:38] wheat he brings it back with him and
[46:40] talking about an adoption talking about
[46:42] a
[46:42] manifestation when Christ was adopted
[46:45] and manifested he had three Heavenly
[46:47] Witnesses and three Earthly
[46:50] ones Elijah and Moses and Christ
[46:53] glorified was the Heavenly Witnesses and
[46:55] Peter James and John and as brother
[46:57] always said hope faith and charity and
[47:01] we hit the resurrection we'll have three
[47:02] Heavenly ones also Luther Wesley and the
[47:05] Pentecostals they'll be right there amen
[47:08] that's right and we'll have and right
[47:09] now we'll have three Earthly ones hope
[47:13] faith and charity three elements that's
[47:16] needed right now in the church three
[47:18] elements and when you see somebody step
[47:20] forward with faith the original Faith
[47:22] signs wonders and miracles Fallen it and
[47:25] love and a hope that know what they
[47:28] talking about is standing on clear
[47:30] ground brother you watching Set Fire to
[47:32] the church amen yes sir so those three

[1:02:06] life hid under the seal amen takes a
[1:02:09] little time you know see me now am and
[1:02:12] then she got into the word now watch it
[1:02:15] is the word that he can work through
[1:02:18] this bride and make
[1:02:20] manifest the blade tsel Shar never
[1:02:23] become seed they all the time become
[1:02:26] more like the seed but in Harvest time
[1:02:28] now the seed is back to the Bible back
[1:02:31] to Malachi 4 back to the promises back
[1:02:34] to the original is seed time is it
[1:02:37] wonderful to be living in seed

[1:02:40] time seed back to his original condition
[1:02:43] now watch they say well now we got to
[1:02:45] wait for the resurrection and so on so
[1:02:48] it's got to happen this bride cannot
[1:02:50] grow with a half a seed 3/4 of a seed
[1:02:54] won't do 99 and 910 won't do one whole
[1:02:59] seed Christ had to come and give out a
[1:03:02] prophetic message otherwise the bride
[1:03:04] could not grow is that right amen and
[1:03:07] that's what has could come forward not
[1:03:09] the gifts but the life of the gifts and
[1:03:13] like I said it was two stages invisible
[1:03:15] and
[1:03:16] visible in The Greening
[1:03:18] stage the green wheat is milky and gummy
[1:03:23] is not good for the cattle they can't
[1:03:25] eat it
[1:03:26] you cannot reproduce it for life because
[1:03:29] back in the ground amen and you can't
[1:03:32] make flour out of it what you going to
[1:03:34] do with it let it
[1:03:37] ripen amen where you going brother I got
[1:03:41] a preach this gospel sit down let it
[1:03:42] ripen Hallelujah God say I can do more
[1:03:45] in 5 minutes and you can do in 2,000
[1:03:47] years sit down and ripen get a have a
[1:03:50] life for live among your people Minister
[1:03:53] Deacon Elder live among some people let
[1:03:56] them see your life first what you mean
[1:03:58] you got to go all over the world and
[1:04:00] everything you live among the people oh
[1:04:02] I got those I'll send them out that's
[1:04:03] that's don't worry about it but live
[1:04:06] among the people let the people see the
[1:04:08] life then you know commend yourself to
[1:04:11] their conscience amen that's right see
[1:04:15] day in and day out with the people let
[1:04:17] them see see and then you'll save
[1:04:18] yourself in them too amen so now it's
[1:04:22] only when the wheed is fully ripened
[1:04:23] that it can be tried to to be every bit
[1:04:26] of the word as it dries out we can say
[1:04:29] we
[1:04:30] flower see me now we can say that but it
[1:04:34] takes a ripen golden corn wheat that's a
[1:04:37] little bit wet laying in the 12:00 High
[1:04:40] sun to dyed right out and we have I
[1:04:43] believe we have reached that stage right
[1:04:45] now where the bride is golden brown
[1:04:48] little bit W but she must be tried in
[1:04:51] every bit of it to dry as it dries out
[1:04:54] it proves she's the word
[1:04:56] amen therefore and who is the word
[1:04:59] Christ the white horse rider he'll come
[1:05:02] to her and what's he do St John
[1:05:05] 5:19 she does nothing except he shows it
[1:05:08] to
[1:05:09] her she don't make a move un let she has
[1:05:12] thus saith the Lord hallelujah or she
[1:05:14] keeps still that's what I'm talking
[1:05:17] about oh do you see it friends do you
[1:05:20] see the where we are in 1971 now I
[1:05:24] believe that we have reached the seed is
[1:05:27] ripened and the last bit of life is just
[1:05:32] about or has left the shuck and when the
[1:05:35] last bit leaves it's still like this now
[1:05:37] and see sitting like his here but now
[1:05:40] when that golden brown
[1:05:43] seed that for a few days only just about

[1:05:54] right up see put it in quickly there'll
[1:05:57] be a short quick power that'll sweep the
[1:05:59] land that's right it'll be short quick
[1:06:01] and Powerful brother it'll be in the
[1:06:03] power of God it'll sweep out there and
[1:06:06] gather in the corn Gather in the Sheep

[1:06:13] about that time you'll see what happens
[1:06:15] there that uh when that wheat is golden

[1:10:23] here and come back to my text
[1:10:26] um and this hit for a minute ministers
[1:10:29] and the bride it is the image of Christ
[1:10:32] that is to be restored in the ministry
[1:10:34] and the saints of God and you know the
[1:10:37] Bible says as the priest so the people
[1:10:40] youve heard to prophesy all the time you
[1:10:43] have a certain Pastor he acts a certain
[1:10:45] way people be acting the same way so as
[1:10:47] the priest as the people then then God
[1:10:50] is going to restore back the image of
[1:10:52] Christ you got to restore back in the
[1:10:53] ministry and in the people and if the
[1:10:55] ministry is there they have to bring
[1:10:57] forth the image of Jesus Christ is that
[1:11:00] right that's the Bible therefore the
[1:11:03] image must come through the ministry as
[1:11:05] it comes to the people if you have a
[1:11:07] Ministry someone some don't have a
[1:11:09] Ministry therefore deal directly see
[1:11:11] he's sing and it's a and our watch the
[1:11:15] ministry is a means as I said Friday
[1:11:18] toward an end that's all it is now is
[1:11:21] only a means toward an end it is not the
[1:11:25] in in itself as the Antichrist say I got
[1:11:28] it that's the end and the means but the
[1:11:31] true minister of God is a means to point
[1:11:34] you to the end and the end is Jesus
[1:11:36] Christ maturity in him amen I want make
[1:11:39] it straight now say so means toward an
[1:11:42] end now the bride's Earthly goal is
[1:11:45] maturity the full knowledge of the Son
[1:11:47] of God the perfect man the fullness of
[1:11:50] the statue of Jesus Christ is the
[1:11:52] bride's Earthly goal Earthly go see this
[1:11:57] is the Earthly end and Destiny of the
[1:11:59] Bride of the Living
[1:12:01] Christ now um we know that there's been
[1:12:04] what's wrong in the message there's been
[1:12:06] many Pharisee types and unders Shepherds
[1:12:08] feeding the Sheep on the chaff weak and
[1:12:12] conflicting utterances and apologetics
[1:12:13] and human opinions and what they think
[1:12:15] and all kind of crazy things but the
[1:12:17] people out across the this country and
[1:12:19] around the world need to hear the voice
[1:12:21] of the chief
[1:12:22] Shepherd the one who spoke through the
[1:12:24] prophet must come back in the voice of
[1:12:26] the Archangel which is the voice of the
[1:12:28] resurrection and speak out through his
[1:12:30] god-given ministry and set that thing on
[1:12:33] fire and we'll have acts 15 all over
[1:12:36] again brother you'll see it happen
[1:12:38] there's going to be a spiritual clash
[1:12:39] between the true Minister and the
[1:12:41] false and the truth shall be on this
[1:12:44] wise his life shall conform with the
[1:12:46] word and the the expression of reality
[1:12:49] shall come forward from him and it will
[1:12:51] be every bit with the word can you
[1:12:53] imagine the true men stand up there with
[1:12:56] this uh God that was in Peter that said
[1:12:59] why have you lied to the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:02] and face and an antichrist who said
[1:13:04] there is no Holy Ghost and face him and
[1:13:07] he come blast up against that and that
[1:13:09] Minister say the true one say if I be a
[1:13:13] Son of God let god in me choose between
[1:13:16] you and me now who's
[1:13:18] right oh
[1:13:20] brother the faith is restored back God
[1:13:23] is in the man he know knows where he's
[1:13:25] standing and God is speaking out of his
[1:13:27] vocal cords and telling the Antichrist
[1:13:30] if I be a Son of God I am a father one
[1:13:34] let God choose between you and me now
[1:13:36] who's speaking it's going to come down
[1:13:38] to that friends

[1:13:48] gical juices is working over
[1:13:53] time amen praise the Lord but that's
[1:13:56] what the word says see so now um uh The
[1:14:00] Fearless men of God will speak by the
[1:14:02] mouth of the Lord their vocal organs
[1:14:04] will be used by God I keep saying back
[1:14:06] and forth cuz I'm trying to explain to
[1:14:07] you the voice of the Resurrection is the
[1:14:09] holy spirit he's got and this is his
[1:14:12] body I just Pro it to you the word made
[1:14:14] flesh so he'll come right down in his
[1:14:16] fullness get into his body and speak out
[1:14:18] through your course because it's his
[1:14:20] body nothing unusual or stranger body
[1:14:25] it's his body He he'll use your ears and
[1:14:28] nose and everything see it's his not
[1:14:31] yours you've been bought with a
[1:14:34] price amen praise the
[1:14:36] Lord now it's the ministry yet now see
[1:14:40] the ministry therefore seeing we have
[1:14:43] this ministry as we have now I'm talking
[1:14:45] I'm typing this to the ministers and the
[1:14:47] bride now see the bride has the same
[1:14:48] ministry as we have received Mercy we
[1:14:51] faint not but have renounced the hidden
[1:14:53] things of dishonesty not walking in
[1:14:55] craftiness nor handling the word of God
[1:14:58] deceitfully but by man watch by
[1:15:00] manifestation of the truth commending
[1:15:03] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[1:15:06] the sight of God because the truth that
[1:15:08] is taught is to be commended by a life
[1:15:13] not because I'm ordained by William
[1:15:14] Brandon oh no but by a life here in the
[1:15:17] Pulpit here in New York city that is in
[1:15:20] your conscience in in the sight of God
[1:15:23] and it's got to be made manifest
[1:15:25] that ain't got one thing to do with it
[1:15:28] if I was ordained it's got to be a life
[1:15:31] so therefore the true Minister will be
[1:15:32] on this wise there will have been a life
[1:15:35] that's been lived and God Vindicated
[1:15:38] amen you'll
[1:15:40] see the ministry is supposed to be
[1:15:44] honest because the truth is taught is
[1:15:46] commanded by the life manifesting the
[1:15:48] truth to all men in the sight of God not
[1:15:52] hidden things now secret things of Shame
[1:15:56] the things men of the
[1:15:58] world do and are shame to have
[1:16:01] known think about the church ministers
[1:16:05] and people disgraceful ways I'll give

[1:16:52] people love to have it so is aren't they
[1:16:55] sweet just so
[1:16:57] meaning so forth we State the truth

[1:21:29] on Earth praise our God but this here
[1:21:33] must come for this is the word made
[1:21:35] flesh mechanics and Dynamics this is the
[1:21:37] Press coming down so therefore like
[1:21:40] Esther let us believe in our
[1:21:42] destiny for how do we know for such a
[1:21:44] time that we're sitting here this
[1:21:46] morning you believe it friends amen this
[1:21:48] is the word made
[1:21:50] flesh let us move into 1971 in full
[1:21:53] faith and realizing that believing that
[1:21:57] God will make us manifest as his bride
[1:21:59] this is not a time to get scared now no
[1:22:02] sir this is the time to be manifesting
[1:22:05] the faith that we are the
[1:22:07] bride who we know it's got to happen so
[1:22:10] this is my message 1971 to you I believe
[1:22:13] with all my heart the anointing that
[1:22:15] came down in the upper room the former
[1:22:18] rain anointing that anointing came down
[1:22:21] to nourish the seed and and make it grow
[1:22:25] throughout the world that was his
[1:22:28] purpose and Deuteronomy I think 11:14
[1:22:31] says that the purpose of the latter ring
[1:22:32] is to gather in the
[1:22:34] corn amen so therefore the line had to
[1:22:37] go out all over the world to gather in
[1:22:38] that corn is that right and to bring the
[1:22:41] corn way down in Australia and Africa
[1:22:44] and South America somewhere the line had
[1:22:46] to strike it to mature it now she's been
[1:22:50] maturing she's just about dead right
[1:22:53] amen and now is time and then Ephesians
[1:22:56] 1:10 he'll bring all things in heaven
[1:22:59] all things up on Earth and gather them
[1:23:00] into one himself God up on the earth for
[1:23:04] about 30 days or so watch that third
[1:23:07] pool it'll create on the spot or
[1:23:10] whatever it is
[1:23:11] brother how we going to jump over St
[1:23:14] Mark 16 before we get to there first
[1:23:17] let's vindicate that we are wheat before
[1:23:18] we get
[1:23:19] there amen vindicate that we are wheat
[1:23:24] by the times fall and then you know it's
[1:23:25] weak then that is the early church
[1:23:27] that's the standard right there then
[1:23:28] they see the standard and the standard
[1:23:30] is the early church but if it's early
[1:23:32] church that means that God will be in
[1:23:34] the church in the Throne of your hearts
[1:23:37] do you love him will you really serve
[1:23:40] him is there somebody here who don't
[1:23:43] understand what's been spoken this
[1:23:44] morning you don't understand the purpose
[1:23:47] and if you have a doubt in your heart
[1:23:49] see me in the back cuz I really don't
[1:23:50] want nobody to leave here with the wrong
[1:23:52] idea maybe say or some things was hard
[1:23:55] or mean or something like this there no
[1:23:57] they were set for a purpose to break
[1:23:59] some shackles and feathers in here this
[1:24:01] morning see what I mean now there are
[1:24:03] those that's still dipping in the world
[1:24:06] and so forth we trying to pull them out
[1:24:08] the world they're sitting right here see
[1:24:10] that they don't realize it see and but a
[1:24:13] spirit a spirit covers so you got to
[1:24:15] shake them
[1:24:16] loose if you have that Authority if you
[1:24:19] know where you're standing at I mean
[1:24:20] therefore there's no fear I have no fear
[1:24:22] whatsoever I feel I'm directly in the
[1:24:25] cent of God's will
