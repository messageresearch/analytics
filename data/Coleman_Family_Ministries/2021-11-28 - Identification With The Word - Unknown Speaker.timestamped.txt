[0:00] you're right now in the scripture I want
[0:02] to read from st. John the second First
[0:05] Epistle of John rather the second
[0:07] chapter verses three through five
[0:09] inclusive and Colossians the third
[0:13] chapter verse 16 and 17 next few moments
[0:20] we like to go to the Word of God see
[0:24] what the Lord has for this morning
[0:26] reading from Saint John 14 chapter xxi
[0:31] and that day ye shall know that I am in
[0:34] my father and ye in me and I in you he
[0:38] that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[0:40] them he it is that loveth me he that
[0:44] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[0:47] and I will love him and will manifest
[0:50] myself to him see those tremendous
[0:53] promises of God therefore keeping his
[0:56] Commandments first John the second
[0:59] chapter third verse and hereby we do
[1:03] know that we know him if we keep his
[1:06] Commandments he does saith I know him
[1:10] and keep it not his Commandments is a
[1:12] liar and the truth is not in him but
[1:15] whosoever keepeth his word in him verily
[1:18] is a love of God perfected hereby know
[1:21] we that we are in him
[1:25] Colossians the 3rd chapter 16 verse
[1:33] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:36] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:38] admonishing one another in Psalms hymns
[1:41] and spiritual songs singing with grace
[1:44] in your hearts to the Lord and
[1:46] whatsoever you do in word or deed do all
[1:49] in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[1:51] thanks to God and the Father by him
[1:55] may the Lord of the blessing of the
[1:56] reading of his word like to tireless
[1:59] little thought this morning
[2:01] identification with the word let's have
[2:05] a word of Prayer how Heavenly Father we
[2:08] can open up the word Lord but you must
[2:10] come down this morning in power by thy
[2:14] spirit Lord and give out the Word of God
[2:16] so Lord we stayin here Lord just to be
[2:20] used this morning if you will Lord we
[2:24] don't say God that you must do it Lord
[2:26] but we stand here by faith Lord
[2:29] believing that the blood of God has
[2:31] sanctified us and that we are in Christ
[2:34] and Lord we expand here Lord Jesus to
[2:38] speak forth the testimony of Jesus
[2:41] Christ which is the spirit of prophecy
[2:43] and Lord we speak forth that word and
[2:46] now may you come down and associate
[2:48] yourself identify yourself with that
[2:51] word God may we only speak that word for
[2:54] that word is life that word is spirit we
[2:57] pray and ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[2:59] and for his glory amen
[3:01] all we certainly praise God for the word
[3:04] of God now I'd like to tie this little
[3:07] thought identification with the word and
[3:10] looking up this word as we have to
[3:12] because we are not intelligent people we
[3:16] have to find out what these words mean
[3:17] to get the inside core meaning of the
[3:21] word and the word identification is
[3:24] looking up in the dictionary and
[3:26] identifying and am identifying or being
[3:32] identified anything by which a person or
[3:36] thing can be identified such as man
[3:41] would say that because he used his
[3:43] driver's license for identification see
[3:46] that's the thing
[3:47] because identifies himself by and I
[3:50] thought a very striking in Webster's and
[3:52] ahead in psycho and analysis it says
[3:57] this an emotional time
[4:00] unconsciously causing a person to think
[4:04] feel act as he imagines the person with
[4:08] whom he has the tide does and I could
[4:11] really opens up something to us and so
[4:14] therefore you can see today that there
[4:17] are many people running around thinking
[4:21] that they are somebody else as you see
[4:23] because these hippies and so forth out
[4:25] here and all spirits are being made
[4:28] manifest and we know that Paul told us
[4:31] in in God's Word to cast down
[4:34] imagination because the outlet the sense
[4:39] of imagination is the outlet where the
[4:44] image for the image forming power is
[4:46] that of the mind see and the imagination
[4:50] is part of the mind and in that sense
[4:52] right there is the power of creation
[4:56] there too because create images and also
[4:59] pictures mental because conceptions and
[5:02] so forth and that's why we see narrow um
[5:04] many people out here now walking around
[5:07] and thinking they're doing God a service
[5:10] and trying to serve God all that's in
[5:13] their minds see to me now they are doing
[5:15] serving God the way they think according
[5:18] to their own imagination they should
[5:21] serve God amen see and so there are
[5:25] others in dinamic because the
[5:26] nominations also Moslems Buddha they'll
[5:29] give their lives to be burned we see it
[5:32] over and Vietnam all the time over there
[5:34] then right they'll sit down there these
[5:36] Buddha priests and pour gasoline on
[5:39] themselves thinking they're doing God a
[5:41] service would we do that
[5:43] thanks be to God we don't have to do
[5:45] that we only have to obey His
[5:48] commandments we only have to obey his
[5:52] words
[5:52] that's just how simple it is that's just
[5:55] how easy it is and we see there
[5:58] that so much of this is going on and
[6:01] then psycho amesys because the part of
[6:04] it now is very important because we are
[6:07] now moving into that mind age see and
[6:10] just before the mind age comes in the
[6:16] mind age is the last days the very last
[6:20] days on the earth that's it there is no
[6:23] more but just before the last days are
[6:27] because arrive but we are in the last
[6:29] day see but there's about three and a
[6:31] half years of last days see and God's
[6:35] prophet told us that the people will go
[6:37] totally insane see then you can imagine
[6:41] their imaginations will create all kinds
[6:45] of pictures and things in their minds
[6:47] and they'll think that they'll see
[6:49] locusts and all kind of animals on earth
[6:51] play it'll be their imaginations you
[6:55] follow me now their minds well therefore
[6:57] our eyes our spirits see in this hour
[7:01] this grace period in here in this
[7:04] silence period this long-suffering in
[7:08] here God Himself come down to his sheep
[7:12] and that they would not go totally
[7:15] insane he said anoint your eyes with the
[7:18] word amen and if you stay with that word
[7:23] you won't imagine nothing else you'll
[7:26] cast down all imaginations you can stare
[7:30] all mental conceptions of what you think
[7:33] God is for he'll come with a message
[7:36] that's him and search the Scriptures for
[7:39] they are they to testify of me not what
[7:43] you think it should be but what it is
[7:46] spoken in the Bible ready that's me the
[7:48] Word of God you follow me now and now
[7:51] you can see why so many are going off in
[7:54] this age they think that God is over
[7:56] there somewhere out in the desert
[7:57] somewhere they think that that's their
[7:59] own mental conception of the Word of God
[8:02] you follow me now so now as we approach
[8:06] these last days when you see all the
[8:10] people out here doing all
[8:11] or these things out here that has to be
[8:14] poor you must enter into the spirit of
[8:18] the last days then when the last days
[8:22] actually arrive they'll just manifest
[8:25] what's in the heart it's harvest but God
[8:29] sent the Holy Spirit amen
[8:32] that we might enter into the Holy Spirit
[8:35] and that is the word you follow me now
[8:38] it's the word its life its spirit and
[8:41] then we anoint our eyes and move in that
[8:44] holy spirit the word and others all
[8:47] outside I can stomp because 25 here he
[8:50] reveals this secret this word this
[8:52] covenant to his elected ones and they
[8:56] have no imaginations no mental
[8:58] conception they say it's the word
[9:01] brother
[9:01] it's the word brother and they stay with
[9:04] head Clerk no matter what happens no
[9:07] matter who fall on the left the right
[9:09] who says what they know what it is for
[9:13] is a revelation from God God has is
[9:16] revealing day by day his word and they
[9:20] keep it keep it means it is a treasure
[9:23] they treasure the word at home every
[9:26] single word of God is a treasure and if
[9:29] a man wants to hide something he goes
[9:32] into his vault hid away somewhere card
[9:35] hasn't fallen hid a heart a man in
[9:37] caught hides his very in this hour in
[9:41] the hearts of his beloved of his bride
[9:44] is hidden a fault and Cotswolds your
[9:46] heart amen and the silence out here they
[9:49] running up and down with mental pictures
[9:52] of what they think it is
[9:53] meanwhile the Brad got the revelation
[9:54] and she's walking right down the path
[9:57] that God has laid out for her amen
[10:00] praise Him praise God so we see that
[10:04] people must get into the spirit first
[10:07] that's why we in our age we can see is
[10:11] that right watch God he speaks a thing
[10:14] first then he gives you time a space of
[10:18] time to see it
[10:19] then if he if the bride believes a word
[10:22] of God and she is now going through this
[10:24] time of space here now she sees the
[10:27] things that he spoke to Malachi the
[10:29] Prophet coming to pass then death faith
[10:32] in that word spoken not gifts are you
[10:37] finally now just a humble prophet of God
[10:40] don't you know that the Prophet
[10:43] represents me holy spirit that's what it
[10:47] was back in Israel's day they didn't
[10:49] have a Holy Ghost the prophets was the
[10:52] Holy Ghost prevail so therefore they all
[10:55] did have to pray get in the spirit for
[10:58] when they the prophets stood there was
[11:00] the spirit of what God wanted to do
[11:02] therefore they had heard the words
[11:05] discern in return and knew what they
[11:08] caught wanted him to do amen and those
[11:11] that hear my words understand that know
[11:14] their God
[11:15] hey Cheryl two mighty exploits so sayeth
[11:19] the word amen so we see them that Jesus
[11:23] Christ the word has prophesied as it was
[11:27] in the days of Sodom as it was in the
[11:30] days of Noah so shall it be in the day
[11:34] when the Son of Man is being received is
[11:37] that right
[11:38] he also prophesied that there would be a
[11:41] time of days of the Son of Man and then
[11:44] there wouldn't be no more but there
[11:46] would be many disciples who would after
[11:48] the Son of man has gone off the scene
[11:50] left the word there they would long for
[11:53] him again one of those days they would
[11:56] go out into the dead of summer and look
[11:58] for him the man in the flesh to come
[12:00] back again but there'll be no more days
[12:03] like though message is here when he put
[12:05] it in your hearts in the vault and then
[12:08] you keep them here amen they know their
[12:12] God amen and this thing here now so they
[12:15] enter into the spirit of what God wants
[12:18] them to do by his word then they walk in
[12:21] the spirit and the other side they're
[12:23] walking in this mental conceptions of
[12:25] what they want to do out here now so
[12:28] what is happening here now there's only
[12:31] two places because they go
[12:32] heaven or hell we understand that well
[12:35] these hair are just bodies here see your
[12:39] soul either belongs there are there
[12:41] we're here the space of time for this
[12:44] body to act out where it belongs in to
[12:48] act out what's in it are you following
[12:51] me now so therefore when you see a
[12:53] person moving a certain way you can't
[12:55] help that he's only manifesting showing
[12:58] way come from amen and a Pope spirit
[13:02] come from Hell perdition and she'll go
[13:04] back there so he must manifest himself
[13:07] in all hellishness amen then if a child
[13:10] of God comes from God he goes back to
[13:12] God and he made of his Christ on earth
[13:15] by the Word of God
[13:17] so he's manifesting through this old
[13:20] body here amen and then in time it'll be
[13:23] changed wheels drop this robe of flesh
[13:25] hey man Oh grace of God so we see
[13:29] friends that the word we keep driving
[13:32] home the word that people say well what
[13:34] is it all about it's nothing but Jesus
[13:36] Christ oh where justification was a work
[13:41] of the word hey man sanctification was a
[13:45] work of the word the gifts was a work of
[13:48] the word but the word comes are you
[13:52] following me you don't want to work on
[13:55] the way you want to where all of the
[13:57] workers Elijah was to come forth and sow
[14:00] seeds from Genesis clean through the
[14:03] revelation that's what he did but they
[14:06] don't know what he did he just spoke the
[14:08] word in simplicity and when you receive
[14:11] those words you receive and caught God
[14:14] Himself tabernacle deity in you 12 in
[14:18] you surface look because careful God is
[14:21] dwelling in you right now and then the
[14:23] price is be it unto me according the
[14:26] gifts no according tonight worth
[14:29] she's right now each day he'd be unto me
[14:33] according to thy Commandments
[14:34] whatever you say Lord you follow me now
[14:37] don't worry and many others now are
[14:39] looking for something else but it was
[14:42] prophesized that they would look for a
[14:44] new life the church does
[14:46] but the bride has the revelation she
[14:49] know it's the Word of God so we see now
[14:52] we're in the last days and the people
[14:55] are moving into the spirit of the last
[14:56] so wherever you see them doing if you
[14:58] see a carnal Christian that's
[15:00] disparities in okay there's a seed for
[15:03] him over there and the book of Genesis
[15:05] lot so he can't move Annika as a spirit
[15:08] in her but when you see a person that
[15:11] has met cup and knows their car he is
[15:16] holy he comes away from the filth of the
[15:18] world and he leaves everything on that
[15:21] were in he holds that he keeps it either
[15:23] that's the bride that's somebody as an
[15:25] elected one that's Christ himself in the
[15:28] bride you don't have to spray them you
[15:31] just speak it speak my lord that's all I
[15:34] want to hear it my god speak this let me
[15:38] hear one word of God Amen and I'll do it
[15:41] Lord you don't have to because because
[15:43] Brady and also over and over and over
[15:46] you found enough the bride is right now
[15:49] moving in the spirit of the word of God
[15:51] in holiness hey man she's just moving
[15:54] over she gets to worship she hides it in
[15:57] there and she keeps moving praise God
[16:00] so we see friends the Word of God in the
[16:03] last days
[16:04] second Timothy three Paul prophesied
[16:07] these things and we all know what they
[16:10] are men shall be heady highminded and so
[16:12] forth because trucebreakers false
[16:14] accusers this is race Ryan the Koran
[16:18] Turkey Hill because perverted people all
[16:21] these things have been traffice I'd the
[16:23] Word of God spoken they must be but the
[16:26] greatest thing is when you see them
[16:29] coming to pass that's when you're
[16:31] supposed to rejoice but they can't
[16:34] rejoice they want a sensation they want
[16:38] a hallelujah they want the Holy Spirit
[16:40] to quicken them in a screaming holla
[16:42] that's only a sensation he does it also
[16:45] but if he can only hand somebody who can
[16:48] so see his words coming to pass then
[16:52] that they have joy in their heart as
[16:53] they Lord you spoke it back here
[16:55] assirram
[16:56] the past now there so Philip this new
[16:58] one Ament is stimulated by the
[17:02] revelation of the word of God what being
[17:05] made known that you might see it so when
[17:08] they see it they're errors are annoying
[17:10] it all around and they begin to move in
[17:12] a straight line Amen praise soul we see
[17:17] all others will go crazy out here
[17:19] practice spoken he didn't dwell on it
[17:22] now he spoke it out that's all God don't
[17:25] have to dwell on he just speaks it
[17:26] that's it you don't have to explain it
[17:29] all but the bride she knows that he said
[17:32] that they will go crazy period they will
[17:34] go crazy period that needs no
[17:36] interpretation no explanation what's it
[17:39] mean it means what he said it means they
[17:41] will go crazy that's all they're fool
[17:44] why I just know I'm the bride you follow
[17:47] me now don't worry about what they wanna
[17:48] do amen worry about what you're gonna do
[17:51] but he's only letting you see what's
[17:53] gonna happen to them because they don't
[17:55] keep his covenant yeah but you do you
[17:58] follow man you have bought this pearl of
[18:00] a great price
[18:01] amen so now notice just before parable
[18:07] judgment Falls God he sends a sword the
[18:11] famine the the pestilence plagues and so
[18:15] forth do you know what he's doing he to
[18:17] me is actually declaring war on those
[18:21] people and that's the way he fights with
[18:24] his swords he come with his sword he's
[18:26] declaring war he's actually going to
[18:29] battle against Satan and Satan's people
[18:31] and notice now God first before it can
[18:35] happen must create evil are you watching
[18:40] me amen and he can only because create
[18:43] this evil age by the word now prophets
[18:47] must speak it back there and come and
[18:50] speak it out and then he is actually
[18:52] creating evil before our eyes right now
[18:55] that's the spoken word you're looking
[18:58] for something else like arm to go on no
[19:00] he said I'll create evil you finally met
[19:03] now that'll happen after Shore that
[19:05] didn't crash your eyes without heads and
[19:07] so forth and they'll come together
[19:09] but we speak about his word you may see
[19:11] it out here amen God creates evil okay
[19:14] cookie the scripture for Isaiah 45 gotta
[19:18] read it to you I seal 45 if you wanna
[19:20] write it down 45 5 I am the Lord and
[19:23] there is none else
[19:25] praise God there is no god beside me all
[19:33] right
[19:34] gird thee though thou has not known me
[19:38] see it now we will come back is because
[19:40] later on say you must know God before
[19:42] you can do anything if you're not
[19:44] because you know God how can you do
[19:45] anything you won't know who to obey you
[19:48] follow me now that they may know from
[19:52] the rising of the Sun and from the West
[19:55] that there is none beside me I am the
[19:59] Lord and there is none else i form the
[20:02] light and create darkness I make peace
[20:06] and create evil that right
[20:08] I the LORD do all these things drop down
[20:12] he heavens from above and let the skies
[20:15] pour down righteousness which he has
[20:17] amen let the earth open and she has Eve
[20:23] you understand and let them bring forth
[20:25] because salvation is the seeds coming in
[20:27] friends and let righteousness spring up
[20:30] together I have the Lord have because
[20:33] created also so he creates good right
[20:36] just and he creates evil now which one
[20:39] do we want hey man the righteous is in
[20:42] the Word of God the message amen
[20:44] now notice this now see God because I
[20:49] Evo's what sorrow wretches nice because
[20:53] adversity afflictions or calamities but
[20:57] has never translated sin see for God
[21:00] creates evil only in the sense that he
[21:04] made sorrow and all of these things to
[21:07] be the fruits of unbelief are you
[21:11] following me now if they won't believe
[21:14] he's a good god now but if they won't
[21:17] believe he must create evil for them
[21:19] that they might eat that if they do
[21:24] he creates the righteousness for he is
[21:26] righteousness and they'll eat that the
[21:28] Tree of Life
[21:29] hey man praise God so we see it then
[21:33] then so therefore he gave us this time
[21:37] in here that we might see the evil and
[21:40] we might see the good now outside of the
[21:44] message word there is no good no son are
[21:49] you following what I'm trying to say to
[21:50] you now you see it gonna be it gonna be
[21:52] because very close now Oh outside of the
[21:56] word now is no good no there's none good
[21:58] out here uh-huh
[21:59] see so therefore the only thing that we
[22:02] have to hold on to is him and that's why
[22:05] he also because took away is profit so
[22:08] that that great person might increase in
[22:12] you and he is that great person many
[22:17] brothers they thought it was there by
[22:20] the mere fact that they thought that
[22:21] they was a great person show the kind of
[22:24] spirit to hell not because not of a a
[22:27] homeless man at all if a man is humble
[22:29] he'll never think he is a great person
[22:32] hey man
[22:33] Paul sound the least of all the saints
[22:35] I'm done in two feet so if a man thinks
[22:38] he's great
[22:39] you can discern his spirit by the word
[22:42] Amen he is earning right away other
[22:46] words we have an anointing in us too
[22:48] because teachers you don't need somebody
[22:50] to tell you stop smoking and drinking
[22:52] and be nice
[22:54] they're annoying teach you that amen
[22:57] but God put his gifts here so forth
[22:59] because ministry anointed to bring you
[23:02] the Word of God to live on but the the
[23:05] anointing in you teaches you everyday
[23:07] because how to be Christians amen just
[23:12] put it in order now amen
[23:14] see so now if the people now will have
[23:19] their eyes on knowing it only by the
[23:21] word see then they can repent and turn
[23:24] to God then if they turn to God their
[23:27] hearts are turn back to the faith that
[23:29] was restored back there that's exactly
[23:31] what it means Francie then
[23:34] then if this is all that we can have for
[23:37] life then this is time of identification
[23:40] with the Word of God because we want
[23:43] eternal life then we must identify
[23:45] herself only with this word and he is
[23:49] trying to identify himself with his word
[23:52] see down here somewhere
[23:53] amen he has seeds out here and he is
[23:57] this holy spirit must come down and
[23:58] identify himself with himself the Word
[24:01] of God amen
[24:02] now see we see then that right now is
[24:07] maturing time right nning time we are
[24:10] now identifying our spirits either with
[24:12] the word all the world out here or some
[24:15] denomination somewhere you follow me now
[24:17] see now many are using the creative
[24:22] power of the imagination to form them
[24:25] mental pictures of what they think this
[24:27] message is they don't understand it seen
[24:30] many isms and so forth but it can only
[24:32] come by revelation that's all friends it
[24:36] is a revelation straight from Jesus
[24:38] Christ st. Matthew 11:27 said all things
[24:41] are delivered unto me of my father
[24:43] and no man knoweth the Sun what the fun
[24:47] now I notice no man knows the son but
[24:50] the father neither knoweth any man the
[24:52] father save the Son and he to whomsoever
[24:56] the son will reveal him so we can only
[25:00] know the father the son by a revelation
[25:03] amen so we see them what God has done
[25:07] for us here in the entire so we see
[25:10] before the last days occur the spirit of
[25:13] the last days comes first then God was
[25:16] obligated to send down a spirit the word
[25:19] that the sons of God would be led by the
[25:21] Spirit of God amen and they walk not
[25:24] after the flesh but they walk in the
[25:26] world and it they keep walking then it
[25:29] be a church and there are dictated by
[25:31] the ways of the flesh and then there's
[25:34] the Coptic the outside is the world
[25:35] outside there and we see a thing because
[25:37] with our eyes now and it's coming a time
[25:40] for the marinade for the whole thing to
[25:41] explode see now thanks be to God we have
[25:46] a message from his prophet
[25:47] a message to tell it how to live what to
[25:50] do and what to expect and also because
[25:53] what to look for see now this is no
[25:57] imagination either you don't have to
[25:59] imagine nothing just hear what he said
[26:01] that's all it is know him you have to
[26:04] imagine anything just listen to what he
[26:07] has said through the Word of God and
[26:09] what has been because reveal on the
[26:12] tapes it dovetailed with the word of God
[26:14] just listen and hear and say Lord open
[26:17] up my heart and reveal thy word to me
[26:20] that I might do it see now back in
[26:24] Daniel 11:32 he's reading back there
[26:27] that this beast that he would come
[26:29] forward pervert the word and seduce all
[26:32] buy it because flatteries flattery see
[26:35] and as such would do wickedly they would
[26:38] be seduced see and because against this
[26:42] covenant Christ the word here see but
[26:45] those he said over there
[26:47] our promise but the people that do know
[26:51] their God see shall be strong and do
[26:54] exploits people that know their God see
[26:59] shall prove themselves win now that they
[27:03] are strong Amen at their standing firm
[27:07] on the message why because the
[27:10] revelation is now supporting them amen
[27:13] they're being supported right now by the
[27:16] revelation of Jesus Christ and then as
[27:19] they mature and ripen they shall do
[27:21] mighty exploits by their God amen is
[27:24] that wonderful promise alright
[27:27] st. John 14 twenty day you shall know
[27:31] that I am in my father and ye and me and
[27:35] I in you now what a tremendous promise
[27:40] that was to think that we here mortal
[27:42] man would understand all about God and
[27:45] the whole revelation of God so he said
[27:48] at that day what day when the revelation
[27:53] of the three full purpose of God is made
[27:58] known
[27:58] all you listening when the revelation of
[28:01] God's three full purpose is made known
[28:04] then you will know that I am in the
[28:09] father and the Father he is in me and I
[28:13] in you and you in me know where they go
[28:17] for his now the prophet of God revealed
[28:20] a three full purpose of God that God's
[28:23] great secret before the foundation of
[28:26] the world that he wanted to come down
[28:28] and be in Christ his word to reconcile
[28:31] us back to him because his fellowship
[28:34] was broken that's the first fold of it
[28:37] and hold it right there because you're
[28:39] gonna see why is so important after and
[28:41] the second fall was that Christ would be
[28:44] in the bride having the preeminence and
[28:48] the third fold and then husband and wife
[28:51] would go back to eating that's all it
[28:53] was and it's very simple now but at that
[28:56] day you shall know you shall understand
[28:59] that I am in my father and my father
[29:02] he's in me see me now
[29:03] and also I'm in you and you and me well
[29:07] now let's bring it right down to here
[29:09] this is the thing here now when they're
[29:11] wondering if Christ is God's prophet or
[29:15] you follow me friends then wondering if
[29:17] some man if he is Christ they don't know
[29:21] he said but ye shall know ye the bride
[29:24] shall get this revelation that I was in
[29:27] Christ and Christ wasn't me and he isn't
[29:30] he was all one the word is God God in
[29:33] his people down through his word here
[29:35] and that day you shall know when the
[29:37] revelation is made known made manifest
[29:40] see that's the date that because you
[29:42] shall know and in that day he will
[29:44] restore back restores back to the
[29:48] kingdom of God which is to come back as
[29:50] husband and wife and walk there once
[29:53] again in the coolness of the even time
[29:56] there have fellowship with God Almighty
[29:58] Himself amen
[29:59] well this great mystery was the great
[30:02] secret revelation that God had in his
[30:05] mind and he has revealed
[30:06] I don't know I'm very quiet here and the
[30:09] greatest thing of all ages
[30:11] the and the people that they can't grab
[30:13] it the greatest thing to happen was not
[30:16] the gifts of the Holy Spirit friends was
[30:19] that this revelation to really
[30:21] understand that Christ is God himself
[30:24] and that he made it so simple at the
[30:28] simple minor ones would get it
[30:29] they think it's some other thing but
[30:32] it's not is only the word so therefore
[30:35] people get spiritual spiritual by that
[30:38] they sit there and when the word comes
[30:41] is it but he means this know exactly
[30:45] what I said and then when it comes in
[30:48] and you see it and then the joy comes in
[30:51] there it's nothing else now it's only
[30:53] what has been said to me no there's no
[30:55] spiritual spiritual you finally now all
[30:58] relish on Revelation is a revelation and
[31:00] when you see it stimulates you Amen
[31:02] praise God so then the second fall is
[31:06] that Christ may have the preeminence in
[31:09] his church his position his rightful
[31:12] place in the church now how do we have
[31:16] this revelation when he comes we
[31:18] identify himself with him the word then
[31:23] you can look around and discern and see
[31:26] who has identified and is identifying
[31:29] day by day themselves with the word and
[31:31] you don't have nobody gotta tell you
[31:33] anything you see it yourself and the
[31:35] thing goes right on so humble and quiet
[31:38] and they don't know what's going on but
[31:41] it's going on all the time see it's love
[31:44] being perfected in the people and when
[31:48] you have love for your brothers and
[31:50] sisters how can we love God if we don't
[31:53] love one another you see so therefore
[31:57] that's how simple it is he said over
[32:00] hand the 21st verse he that hath my
[32:02] Commandments and keepeth them take my
[32:05] words and put it in his vault in here
[32:08] hold him in there amen don't let Satan
[32:10] because snatch him and Satan can't get
[32:12] in that vault is hidden God Amen he
[32:16] can't get in there he has to repent
[32:19] first
[32:20] and be baptized in his name Amen and be
[32:23] baptized in that place in there then he
[32:26] could come it then he's your brother as
[32:28] a prophet said amen
[32:29] so he can't snatch it out of there he
[32:32] has to repent first and he'll never do
[32:34] that and right he'll never repent see so
[32:38] therefore amen he that keeps the word in
[32:43] the heart that's the one that loves me I
[32:47] love the Lord and hate your brother so
[32:50] cool
[32:51] no you don't love the Lord he said he
[32:53] that loves and keeps my Commandments
[32:55] that does them he loves me and also my
[32:59] father loves him also now if you don't
[33:02] have this revelation you think it's two
[33:04] people up there because loving you right
[33:06] but with the revelation you know is God
[33:08] in Christ loving you it's one amen
[33:11] praise the Lord and another promise to
[33:15] you I will manifest myself to you I will
[33:19] make myself known to you I'll quicken
[33:23] your mind quick and know where their God
[33:26] in you Brit are quick in your
[33:28] remembrance it means make Europe because
[33:31] your memory alive annoying it and make
[33:34] it a lie and remember all things that he
[33:37] spoke on these tapes and so forth he'll
[33:39] bring it back to you just receive it in
[33:42] he's trying to get and we'll show you
[33:43] why I have because in it in a very few
[33:45] moments amen now eat the promise of God
[33:48] that has my Commandments the word
[33:51] message
[33:52] bye-bye revelation now see keeps them
[33:54] put some here in the heart in the vault
[33:56] and holds a minute and then say the lord
[33:59] help me to walk in that pan and doesn't
[34:01] he's dying out to the world
[34:04] amen Holy Spirit is the Dove is that
[34:06] he's a lamb and the Holy Spirit is
[34:08] dwelling with him see these are the ones
[34:11] who really love me not all that say Lord
[34:14] Lord see but those that keep my
[34:17] Commandments amen and what are they
[34:20] search the scriptures they are they to
[34:22] testify that's me
[34:23] scriptures is me see now gosh that he
[34:27] wouldn't manifest himself because to
[34:28] them see so now I'll turn over to
[34:32] Jeremiah
[34:33] and we want to find somebody who
[34:36] identified himself with the word and
[34:39] maybe the Holy Spirit can quicken this
[34:41] to you it's quicker than me and I guess
[34:44] such a joy when I realize the Old
[34:46] Testament because what it was God would
[34:50] come down give his words to his prophets
[34:53] they would just speak the words of God
[34:56] that's all there was and all you had to
[34:59] do was to obey what they said but the
[35:03] religious church people could not do it
[35:06] but he always had a remnant they will do
[35:09] it that's why I said over in Revelation
[35:11] blessed is he that reads the book of
[35:14] Redemption why bless here's why in the
[35:18] Old Testament only the priests read the
[35:20] scriptures you finally now therefore he
[35:23] was a blessed person you are priests and
[35:26] kings of God so you're blessed for the
[35:29] word of the Lord comes to you priests
[35:32] amen
[35:33] you are the priests therefore you got
[35:36] the word to read it now amen praise O
[35:39] God you understand the Holy Spirit was
[35:44] the word in the prophets mouth so you
[35:47] say Lord because come to me Congress
[35:48] because revealed I word he did through
[35:50] the president see but in this Gentile
[35:54] Age with Luther Wesley and the
[35:56] Pentecostals though Gentiles don't
[35:58] understand that so they was waiting for
[36:00] an outpouring but when the outpour he
[36:03] came it comes to a prophet but all the
[36:06] patterns fall do is speak the Holy
[36:08] Spirit that's all and they can't get it
[36:11] they still are going over here and going
[36:14] over there looking for something else
[36:15] and it's the Prophet Hosea has already
[36:17] come the lettering has been pulling out
[36:20] here ready it's just writing to see now
[36:23] it's be done in silence just move it
[36:26] right on down it's in to the spirit of
[36:28] the word of God is moving and all other
[36:31] that's going into the same spirits out
[36:33] there 200 pounds and pals and devils out
[36:35] there they have come into them people
[36:37] out there and we have Christ in us the
[36:39] hope of glory
[36:41] amen the word of the car they ever live

[36:47] of Adam eat them
[36:48] amen amen Edom eat the word eat the
[36:52] whole room praise God
[36:54] sweet going into the mouth bitter in the
[36:56] belly oh we loved the revelation of it
[37:00] then after we leave and go downstairs do
[37:02] it now uh-huh spinner so my snap in the
[37:08] face you found me I love your brother

[37:21] it preached himself when you read it the
[37:23] revelation of it praise huh I'm gonna
[37:25] have a brat glory to calm the bride now
[37:28] die on it uh can you drink this cup you
[37:32] follow me now can you sum up what
[37:33] because with me see it's bitter see me
[37:36] now but eat the whole roll he told
[37:38] Jeremiah I make you a brazen wolf
[37:42] alright I'll make you an ant killer
[37:45] sending me now he has made of iron
[37:47] pillow breathing wall of defense city
[37:51] and he is that city he is head pillow
[37:54] he's made his people you hear therefore
[37:58] going on and speak my words and they'll
[38:00] hate you for it to stay with anyway
[38:03] Jeremiah Jeremiah as we read it all down
[38:06] to day he's suffering that all right and
[38:08] that great chapter did because Jeremiah
[38:11] 23 The Lying prophets did not believe
[38:14] Jeremiah and they'd think today they
[38:17] were out with dreams all kind of things
[38:19] they don't believe the word and Jeremiah
[38:23] here in the a thirtieth chapter he
[38:24] prophesied the word he told his people
[38:28] to go out and give themselves over to
[38:31] these Chaldeans and that this way
[38:34] because they could live him see but they
[38:36] thought that was ridiculous but that was
[38:39] his word see time I know if you read
[38:42] because later on
[38:43] cartagia right there they couldn't
[38:45] receive that they said because Jeremiah
[38:47] wanted to because hurt them and so forth
[38:49] but no less that was God's will for them
[38:52] to go out and give
[38:53] over 2d Chaldeans it sounded crazy to
[38:57] them seeing but that was a word of that
[39:00] was the holy ghost speaking and they
[39:02] rejected the holy ghost speaking through
[39:05] a prophet and there because of that they
[39:08] threw him down in a dungeon no water
[39:11] down admire because how to rats down in
[39:14] a hole everything else don't miss it
[39:16] they put the word of the Lord for the
[39:19] Aged in a hole and I'm dungeon where how
[39:24] they put this message because today it's
[39:27] this is some that they put it in a
[39:29] dungeon they hid it and it got another
[39:32] revelation out there because if they
[39:34] ever get it then you nothing if you ever
[39:37] get the revelation we are nothing it is
[39:40] Christ has the preeminence in the bride
[39:43] of Jesus so they hide that word in a
[39:48] dungeon and they say we are God's people
[39:51] and they all did that God said run
[39:55] through sea to find me a man he had a
[39:57] little man
[39:57] and because Ethiopian eunuch and he made
[40:02] intercession for Jeremiah two kings in a
[40:05] car went down and got because
[40:08] thirty-minute went down and got Jeremiah
[40:10] out of the hole what's he doing here
[40:12] showing you the reliefs among them and
[40:15] Ethiopian you finding out the despised
[40:19] those who they think is nothing how
[40:22] about you today
[40:23] you finally now they will bail out that
[40:27] word you follow me now they will if they
[40:31] got to go into a dungeon if they have to
[40:34] go into a hole a manger but they'll get
[40:37] that word they'll buy and this unit went
[40:40] down in there and brought up the Word of
[40:42] God for the H Jeremiah that was God in
[40:45] Jeremiah the word are you finally friend
[40:48] and today they look on us as that eunuch
[40:52] today we are nothing but it was a eunuch
[40:54] see me now and there he understood that
[40:57] he said my god Jeremiah got the word of
[41:00] the Lord for these people here and they
[41:01] cast it away they didn't want they hid
[41:03] it and put it down in a dungeon
[41:05] amen city man out but what happened he
[41:08] recognized he first see he knew who his
[41:10] his God was amen and because you trust
[41:14] God he always blesses you as we will see
[41:17] now turn over to Jeremiah 39 15 verse 2
[41:22] loop back around put Jeremiah in a
[41:23] dungeon a filthy place see other words
[41:27] married the same thing say to me and now
[41:29] she ran off with some other man finally
[41:32] now illegitimate see think of Mary
[41:35] carrying the word message she had to
[41:39] suffer all of that abuse from her family
[41:43] and friends and so for that right for it
[41:45] was revealed to Joseph but Mary had to
[41:48] go anyway holding a head high amen a
[41:51] little because about a fourteen-year-old
[41:53] girl going holding up her head high for
[41:56] God revealed to her who that was there
[41:58] and Mary today the breath she's got that
[42:02] word message in here and God has
[42:05] revealed to her who it is and all around
[42:08] here they wonder what is it brother
[42:10] what is it what tape do I have to hear
[42:12] not to tape you got to have Christ in
[42:16] you to reveal it that is it
[42:19] the revelation now notice now because
[42:23] ebed a Melek did that the fifteenth
[42:27] verse now the word of the Lord came to
[42:30] Jeremiah into something there the word
[42:33] God speaking right to Jeremiah
[42:35] here's God's will right here now while
[42:38] he was shut up in the court of the
[42:40] prison saying go and speak to a bit
[42:43] Melek but the Ethiopian saying thus
[42:47] saith the Lord of hosts the God of
[42:49] Israel behold I will bring my words
[42:52] watch this now and bring it over here
[42:54] because the day now I will bring my
[42:56] words upon this city for what for evil
[42:59] and not because we're good and they
[43:02] shall be accomplished and that day be
[43:05] before thee see Jeremiah 39:16 see and
[43:13] they shall be a compass and that day
[43:15] before the
[43:16] then this Unicare would have to wait
[43:20] until he saw the evil the Word of God
[43:23] coming to Jeremiah spoken made the
[43:25] manifest then in that day when he'd see
[43:28] that and also in that day because he had
[43:31] a revelation because from God he
[43:33] wouldn't falter you follow me now but I
[43:36] will deliver thee in that day saith the
[43:39] Lord and thou shalt not be given unto
[43:42] the handle of the men of whom they all
[43:44] afraid for I will surely deliver thee
[43:47] and thou shalt not fall by the sword but
[43:50] thy life shall be for a prey unto thee
[43:53] because thou has put that trust in me
[43:56] the word saith the Lord
[43:58] now watch this now this unit identify
[44:03] himself with the word down in this
[44:05] dungeon and right he identified himself
[44:08] with that word Saniya now because he did
[44:11] that God is going to bless him but it's
[44:14] got to be in a day when it's gonna be
[44:17] evil all around for the Word of God C is
[44:19] spoken and when he see all of the evil
[44:22] all around he begins to look up you
[44:25] follow me now before he know he is to be
[44:28] delivered and we have a same promise
[44:30] today so therefore it says that thy life
[44:33] shall be for a prey unto thee see cuz
[44:38] now notice now the eyelash shall before
[44:41] prey unto thee now now where's the prey
[44:43] see a prey is a prize of war plunder
[44:48] because booty that right other words
[44:50] seized by a wild beast see then other
[44:53] words in the time of war they come -
[44:57] because plunder the wives the gold and
[44:59] so forth and take that away so therefore
[45:02] his life C would be unto him as a prey
[45:05] and surprise a reward that God will come
[45:10] and take that prey away or you follow me
[45:14] friends then an hour D the Lariat of
[45:18] Judah had roared the wild beasts of the
[45:21] jungle the line of judgment has roared
[45:24] and we are his prey are you finally
[45:29] friends
[45:29] in this evil day when you see the sword
[45:32] the plagues the pestilence and the lion
[45:35] is wrong a lot cut of spoken I create

[46:44] life which is his life amen so he can't
[46:48] destroy himself that's him hey man
[46:51] praise God
[46:53] we are his bride we are his because in
[46:55] closing what is it is Jesus Christ the
[46:59] new birth revealed in you that he has
[47:02] deep preeminence when you see a person
[47:05] soul soul out to the world walking in
[47:09] humility then you know that they don't
[47:12] have the preeminence in their own life
[47:15] somebody else has then what you see look
[47:19] in the Bible and there you'll find it
[47:21] love peace joy and temperance then you
[47:25] know who has the preeminence in that
[47:27] man's life then that is the baptism of
[47:31] the Holy Ghost
[47:32] there you see it you don't have to
[47:33] wonder what is it you see it amen
[47:36] that's God made manifest God walking on
[47:40] two feet in humans
[47:41] here's your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:44] praise God you want the one that nothing
[47:48] see to me now why is this friends weak I
[47:52] understand he's got to get that
[47:54] preeminence and we find out why see that
[47:57] he might express his words other words
[48:00] you expressed because your own words but
[48:03] he wants to express his word his wife
[48:05] he's promised certain things here and if
[48:08] he can only get her body and he can
[48:10] suppress his words through then he could
[48:13] come in quicken know his own words in it
[48:15] but he cannot quit in what our minds say
[48:17] can't do it so I feel sorry for those
[48:20] people since their people have gone off
[48:23] on a revelation
[48:24] he can't quicken that it will not rise
[48:27] but his word if his English shall rise
[48:31] the commandments of God shall rise in
[48:34] that day but the others think it won't a
[48:37] white horse ride this and that won't
[48:39] rise well he's a white horse rider comes
[48:42] back with the brat after this time
[48:45] brother amen so therefore that he is
[48:49] promised in the last days and he can
[48:52] bring it to pass because through his
[48:54] body see as he works through the body
[48:57] see what is it just the Word of God made
[49:00] manifest we said well what is the word
[49:04] of the Lord today you follow me now well
[49:06] the word of law today was st. because
[49:08] Malachi 4 then when you saw it there it
[49:11] was it needed no interpretation
[49:13] now the word a lot today was that he
[49:16] would have a people that would so let
[49:18] his words be made known through them
[49:22] love and peace and joy and so forth and
[49:24] also kindness and stick with his word
[49:26] here when you see that you see the
[49:28] because the because he only goes it's
[49:31] right there before you you see it friend
[49:33] so sample see now watch this because in
[49:37] closing listen the this whole work here
[49:42] amen
[49:43] this whole thing here this is God's Word
[49:47] this is a seat all right according to
[49:51] st. Luke 8:11 think is it right the Word
[49:53] of God is a seat see now he gave out
[49:57] gifts back in 1906 but he said now I've
[50:00] I'm gonna have a breath see but only the
[50:04] word can raise up in the resurrection
[50:06] now if I can find a way to get my words
[50:12] into my people and I can only do it
[50:15] through a prophet amen
[50:18] but Malachi prophet there would be a
[50:21] prophet here Elijah
[50:23] so therefore God has the means now now
[50:27] he's got to find the people but he
[50:29] predestinated of people because of
[50:32] either so the words have been spoken and
[50:35] there's an egg out here we are the egg
[50:38] for the word to contact with you follow
[50:42] me now and begin to grow and the word
[50:44] has made contact with the earth I mean
[50:46] it cuz I wouldn't become at the egg the
[50:48] field the fuel is the agency and it has
[50:51] made contact with it and now it's
[50:53] growing is Christ now watch this the

[51:44] though the seed has made contact with
[51:47] the egg
[51:48] if I can only and then that woman that
[51:52] bride won't receive no other seat for
[51:56] she knows is already as any woman she
[51:59] know she prayed it she's because she

[56:12] such a solid work that many can't wait
[56:15] so they go off for some other
[56:17] revelations but they did wait upon their
[56:20] car my god they shall mount up with
[56:22] wings as Eagles came in now that we're
[56:26] close to God as the Eagles go as they go
[56:28] to the Sun we go up to God amen praise
[56:32] God now Jesus was God revealed now as I
[56:38] was saying if God can get this seat into
[56:41] a spiritual one
[56:42] he will not worry he won't because he
[56:46] can't fail now he can't do it himself
[56:48] now because he kicked him to himself
[56:49] into it he's got to have the seat in a
[56:52] body to bring to pass his word what has
[56:55] been spoken because for this age now if
[56:58] he got it in the Prophet had faith that
[57:02] it got in somewhere because he sold it
[57:04] hey man and was it was up to God to
[57:07] direct those seats into some spiritual
[57:10] womb somewhere in the world my tape book

[57:46] day which we know is come in the
[57:48] resurrection he has prophesied it will
[57:51] be our resurrection and you are now
[57:53] growing into that resurrection and when
[57:56] the time comes there come out voice of
[57:58] the resurrection and you shall come
[58:00] forth yes Pete on the meek according to
[58:02] that word for the resurrection and
[58:04] whatever supposed to be then it will be
[58:06] done whatever is supposed because to be
[58:08] now is being done
[58:10] what he says full of redundant is being
[58:12] done right now amen
[58:13] closing again amen Jesus was God
[58:19] revealed amen and that was the Word of
[58:22] God now why because it's why God then
[58:26] the case the Word of God
[58:28] so he had to vindicate Jesus for he
[58:32] wasn't a word of God revealed is that
[58:34] right amen see then the church see will
[58:38] be the seventh seal seventh under the
[58:42] message Christ revealed then he must
[58:45] vindicated for it is not them is him the
[58:49] word for he had a space of time in their
[58:52] lives to have the preeminence and
[58:56] because they kept his words in the vault
[58:59] he said I will manifest myself to you I
[59:03] will love him and he loves his bride
[59:06] he's not gonna have a because they hurt
[59:09] she's his prey amen and he is with her
[59:13] right now sitting next to her in her
[59:16] talking to her reveal himself to him
[59:18] right now see it's going on right now
[59:21] it's a secret because of course you'd
[59:23] want right now see then pretty soon
[59:25] he'll come out and say here's my bride
[59:27] it's coming
[59:29] amen see then he will vindicate with
[59:32] science following it the show that it is
[59:35] him you follow me now you'll see the
[59:38] CERN following it it'll be him see cuz
[59:41] God must vindicate his word and his
[59:44] bride is the word the seventh seal
[59:46] message in a very simple praise God
[59:50] then what is is a three-fold mystery see
[59:52] because to the brand God in Christ
[59:55] Christ in the bride heaven deep
[59:57] preeminence to restore back to okay
[1:00:02] the bride is bone of his bone flesh of
[1:00:05] his flesh same spirit see the bride is
[1:00:10] the blood of Jesus Christ by the Spirit
[1:00:13] because the life is in the blood
[1:00:16] you are the deep because God's blood is
[1:00:19] a spirit so the blood is spirit you know
[1:00:22] and therefore you are the this church is
[1:00:25] the it is God's blood well it's his
[1:00:28] spirit now what God did in Christ Christ
[1:00:32] will do it in the breath coming right
[1:00:35] back to this free full revelation saying
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] why because Adam was the seat of God's
[1:00:42] Word
[1:00:43] what Christ's body was the word now let
[1:00:48] us say now see his body was the Word of
[1:00:50] God made manifest it could made flesh
[1:00:53] the word made flesh then if see if then
[1:00:56] his body was the Word made flesh we come
[1:00:59] out of his body
[1:01:01] therefore we're part of the word hey man
[1:01:04] see you now we're part of his spirit
[1:01:06] part of his word bone of his bone
[1:01:08] because that's his flesh therefore you
[1:01:11] cannot die how can you if that's his
[1:01:14] body amen okay all hell is against this
[1:01:18] revelation the devil that's why he sends
[1:01:21] his ministers against the message to
[1:01:24] lead you off the message you follow me
[1:01:26] now then now okay
[1:01:28] because in closing Christ is the head of
[1:01:31] the church all right the church is the
[1:01:35] body
[1:01:35] Amy come on then then if it's a body is
[1:01:40] his Brides body right well Christ is the
[1:01:44] firstfruits of the resurrection he's the
[1:01:48] head of the bride body which is his body
[1:01:52] then if the bride body then the Brad
[1:01:56] body must follow the head for is part of
[1:02:00] his resurrection
[1:02:01] in part of the threefold mystery of God
[1:02:04] now watch it's impossible for it to go
[1:02:08] it's part of God's mysteries now watch
[1:02:13] this in the first fruits of the
[1:02:15] Resurrection Christ the head came up
[1:02:19] that right
[1:02:21] he said foxes because they have holes
[1:02:23] birds have nests the son of man has
[1:02:25] nowhere to lay his head
[1:02:28] but in the in turn he's got a buddy amen
[1:02:32] so therefore how can God only raise the
[1:02:35] head if it's connected to that body amen
[1:02:40] if the head come up there pani must
[1:02:42] arise also for this his body it's the
[1:02:46] bread dough
[1:02:47] therefore this head Christ cannot go
[1:02:50] without the body in the resurrection
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] grace how God it's impossible it's the
[1:02:57] same word see me now is part of the
[1:03:01] threefold ministry Christ was the first
[1:03:04] fold of it it's three fold
[1:03:06] now the second full must be made
[1:03:09] manifest
[1:03:09] Christ in you then the third full be
[1:03:13] because restored back to either so it's
[1:03:16] all a mystery of God and the first fall
[1:03:18] has the made manifest Christ also in
[1:03:21] resurrection Christ
[1:03:23] now the second fall is being made
[1:03:25] manifest because of because of because
[1:03:28] about two now you follow me now friends
[1:03:30] we are the body he is the head he the
[1:03:33] body cannot stay here on earth it's got
[1:03:36] to go up the cup with him he's the head
[1:03:38] well then the second full of the
[1:03:40] revelation is that he if he can only get
[1:03:43] the preeminence and becoming our head
[1:03:47] then we prove that we are his body and
[1:03:51] then he has preeminence over the body or
[1:03:54] you follow me now then you are
[1:03:57] identified with him you don't have to
[1:04:01] say him in the message amen
[1:04:03] you know what to say it you manifested
[1:04:07] so the body must follow him back the
[1:04:10] wife follows the husband right back
[1:04:13] see Brides body then if it's the bride's
[1:04:16] buddy
[1:04:17] see this Brides body here if she has a
[1:04:19] head
[1:04:20] she recognizes no other hit this no
[1:04:24] false no one wants it she don't
[1:04:25] recognize it all she has a hint Christ
[1:04:29] is the head of the body one hit amen
[1:04:33] not because because many false no and
[1:04:35] many heads out there one hit
[1:04:37] the word Amen praise God amen
[1:04:42] so now friends in closing the third time
[1:04:45] this word began to rise Luther
[1:04:50] Wesley Pentecostals they begin to raise
[1:04:53] up because we pick up in power right now
[1:04:54] is coming to the identification time and
[1:04:58] that's why we are now the green now he
[1:05:01] can identify himself with the body amen
[1:05:05] and we now can identify ourselves with
[1:05:08] him the head so it's coming like this
[1:05:11] man
[1:05:11] Steve then the bride becomes the word
[1:05:15] seeing as the anointing of God the hit
[1:05:19] comes the voice of the Resurrection then
[1:05:21] the anointing from the head begins to
[1:05:24] move down through the body and what you
[1:05:27] think it's gonna happen in when it
[1:05:29] begins to move down because through the
[1:05:31] body of Jesus Christ on earth amen
[1:05:36] it'll be so identified so completely him
[1:05:39] it'll be him amen see we're his flesh
[1:05:45] identification with the word now sending
[1:05:48] me enough friends
[1:05:50] praise God when you see the body the
[1:05:55] green and the headship haven't because
[1:05:58] preeminence becoming one identification
[1:06:01] see in the fullness of the measure of
[1:06:04] his manifestation the word of God amen
[1:06:07] shows that the body is ready to be
[1:06:11] received because of because for the
[1:06:13] rapture ready now almost to be receive
[1:06:17] for the rapture friends the Prophet he
[1:06:19] promised it to be a short quick powerful
[1:06:21] message on earth where Christ will be so
[1:06:24] identified in that green it'll be him
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:27] same life same spirit same signs same
[1:06:31] wonders it'll be the spoken word
[1:06:33] manifest who'll be speaking it you said
[1:06:35] but Lord I can't do that I know you
[1:06:37] can't but because who made your mouth
[1:06:39] amen is that right mostly because he
[1:06:42] couldn't do he couldn't speak but notice
[1:06:45] Moses was a God - because Aaron
[1:06:49] Aaron was the prophetic body amen that
[1:06:53] spoke only what Moses said then when
[1:06:57] that body spokes something that the
[1:07:00] other people wanted it to say God got
[1:07:03] man amen
[1:07:05] all the time the body Aaron prophetic
[1:07:08] body spoke only what God in Moses told
[1:07:11] him signs wonders miracles a cart moving
[1:07:15] on got up there to Mount Sinai
