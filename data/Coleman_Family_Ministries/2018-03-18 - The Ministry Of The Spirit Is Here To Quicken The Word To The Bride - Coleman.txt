========================================
praise God truly we can feel the anointing in this place [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you lord blessed be the name of the Lord I want to invite your attention to Zechariah for Saint John 15 x1 reads on this wise and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see is thou and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps they're wrong and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side they are aside they're out so I answered and spake to this angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord the angel that talked with me answered said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto the rule saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and st. John 15:7 if he abide in me and my words abide in you he shall ask what's your will and it shall be done unto you and acts 1:8 excellent eat but ye shall receive power the question is when alpha that

blessing to the reading of his word amen just a word of prayer father in heaven we read their word and now Lord our people have coming here prepared and anointed and a minister cannot bring the revival we've been taught that the people themselves have the seeds in them and anointing is here to revive the seeds in them in the homes on the jobs and the fellowships and just individuals so bless

in a long time amen but I've been here just getting things in order through July and August kind of slipping in amen you know it's not a group it's individuals and and the presence of Jesus Christ unrecognized just slipping it in and then trying to kind of warn you so something wouldn't come upon you a man so you've been warned so when it comes a men are not responsible a man well praise alone [Music] [Applause] well finally got started huh okay Church first time Anthea's 2 4 & 5 the Apostle Paul said his speech and preaching was in the demonstration in the past and the Spirit of the Spirit in the power and of power and that your face should staying in the power of God amen now you all know the story the foundation November 10th 1964 the Holy Spirit spoke to me I was wondering in my Pentecost away at my aunt she Jacob Grace Joseph perfection that was in 64 while the Prophet was still preaching okay now and then then I've been echoing back the shout message since December 26 1965 which is about 33 years and 10 months up to date October a man echoing back the shout keeping it alive a man and so why was it so hard brother Coleman because of three because there's three reasons why and here's what it is see down there's three elements you have to deal with the the humanistic realm and in there people were saved and you know without the Holy Ghost and sanctified well suddenly just can't get that revelation amen and then divine revelation and then vision thus saith the Lord so those are three elements and brother Bram said Melchizedek the Great Prince he's he said he said there's three elements and a man follows first as humanistic second is divine revelation third is the vision that's thus saith the Lord and then Jesus Christ the same Chicago 1955 as I have said there's three elements that people dwell in this the first one is humanistic we say down we are we we down here we say well I'll pray for that person I'm hoping that now they'll get well now next is divine revelation here's what I want to strike so you know what I've been doing all these years that's when something darling your heart anchors it and says it's going to happen then something is going to happen that's divine revelation nothing can move it can't ball it out can't run it out can't curse it out can't revile it out hold church walk away still they are praise God well now you understand what I've been doing up here for all these years you can't stop it they can't stop it you can't run it out you can't curse it out there's nothing that you can do about it either accept it or walk out be on your way because I'll be standing here by the grace of God in and out day in and day out Sunday Wednesday I'll be here I'll be on my posts hallelujah defying the revelation a man may be seated that's when something telling your heart anchors it anchored shows the perfection acre wasn't nothing gonna change that praise God nobody when the Holy Spirit told me December 26 5 8 in the morning everybody laid out flat across the country he said the shout of the king now who's gonna stop that stand up the shot of the King doesn't account nobody can stop it please God a man may be seated in the third element is vision oh now watch catch this the third element is vision are the word of the Lord mate manifests or you got that huh when you see that see what vision or the word of the Lord end of the world Lord made manifest then is thus sayeth the Lord so now you get rich now you know what you get ready to come into thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah okay on the ark amen Jeffersonville 1955 ii is divine revelation when something is revealed to you - you know to me or to that one that one over there well this was revealed to me that's my divine revelation well who's going to stop it so I can't help if all the ministers don't have it cuz that my fault but I'm gaining the preacher and nothing is going to stop me from preaching it so now you you understand now what I've been up against God to give you a divine revelation look look or Noah I thank God that there wasn't me 120 years look at Moses 40 years huh I thank God they come down to 25 years with Abraham Braves God Strega not to unbelievers strong giving praise our God amen and if they if they know anything I thought they would catch it I said 25 years therefore I had to say goodbye because it was finished next 28 days and then the time a lion you've been holding that seed in there long enough unbelieving I'll visit you Sarah hallelujah the Misses of spirit is here Oh Holly I fought the misery catch that I said I'm leaving me Joe Coleman with a divine revelation staying out here and preach these promises I thought they would catch it I'll say I'm leaving amen and I will not have another lesson meeting like this one amen or unless like it does saith the Lord [Music] well praise God here we are we're together again just praising the Lord okay got it now may be seated second is divine revelation when someone reveal to you not to the other people then they go on say well I don't know what he's talking about what it wasn't revealed to you it's not the same in New York is different here of course because there's a divine revelation here I don't care where you come from it's not in your country it cannot be the same there's something about New York City a man said here hallelujah may be seated glory glory today you're going to understand the purpose you were born for you were born for this purpose you were created for this purpose you were born to stand here in the last days upon this earth praise God and become the word made flesh that saith the Lord hallelujah you may be gori gori gori you may may be seated yes let make no mistake no matter you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost just keep yourself sanctified amen maybe see the second is divine revelation we some revealed to you and you know you just know in your heart is going to happen why because I'm quoting back from the Prophet and then do you understand why I was so positive because I was have a revelation of brother ransom message and that wasn't brother Brown that was the son of man in brother Brown speaking the word so I've got to give me a revelation or what are you saying I mean I may not be a fool not to be positive that's what he's saying I don't care where the way you come from I don't care what you don't understand but this is what I understand this is what would reveal to me and it's got to come to pass and even told you second phase prophesy and prophesy and what the testimony of Jesus spirit of prophecy the hardest thing was maybe see them I mean maybe see the moment the hardest thing for 33 years was what dealing with people in a humanistic around without a revelation that was the hardest part that's where the love for their souls come in or you walk out of here that's right to look at these people faces no praise no nothing don't only note even talking about humanistic and you up here in divine revelation glory to God and you got a hold on hold on hold on anyway sick weary tired time on our tents you maybe seen it what tests you've been through maybe seated oh you just know in your heart here not appear is going to happen because the prophet said so yet there isn't just yet there's nothing but just the revelation you finally understand now only the revelation I had everything else you had the same books and tapes they're correct ok Church well what have I been doing since December 26 1965 why are we a denomination Oh Jeff Saville 1958 page 33 paragraph 160 now the Bible did say your sons and your daughters shall prophesy now what does the word prophecy mean look it up now listen is to tell something under inspiration tell what - what the Prophet saying is that what you've been doing brother Coleman yes tell something on the inspiration under revelation not humanistic realm humanistic is although we were were were word father said that's humanistic but you have a divine revelation that seven thunders are the seven voices of the seven churches Jacob greats chose the perfection to shout at a king and of some have compassion that severe in Revelation tell it speak it and may be seated your sons and daughters shall prophesy now what does the word prophecy mean look it up it is to tell something under inspiration or foretell something for tell what for tell everything that the Prophet said we prophesied bang amen then they think your prophet well we'll get to that amen it's a compound word pays 34 Paragon 170 now but then the circumcision of the Old Testament was in the flesh but in this New Testament Joelle said I pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons your daughters shall prophesy now the word prophecy does not mean to teach they get rid of all teachers brother cloud any man I don't mean to teach the prophecy means to either tell and experience on the inspiration while I told my experience on the inspiration jacob grace tells of perfection the shot of the king to seven thunders seven voice of seven church ages that was my inspiration that was my experience is it opening up to you now because you've got to understand what I'm doing before you can forward before the dynamics can pour out in here you got to know that God call me you got to know that God sent me here as the pants of this church praise God you got to know that you got to believe that I'm not expect you to lift me up no I'm steady just pray for me that's all Hey no one asked for respects amen Laura if God demands it amen okay may be seated now the word prophet does not mean to teach them the prophecy means to either tell an experience on the inspiration of foretell something that's fixing to take place and this whole message was the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of prophecy and everybody wasn't called but they don't think they call it's only a few that's called that's your problem every man think he's a pants or someone he's not got only called a few and there's your confusion mmm-maybe seated is you know listen this is got to say the same thing all the time or it isn't the Word of God pick up one of my tape from 1963 my first message was a statue of a perfect man the first one in Connecticut any pick actor bringing in my house and pick up any tape you find it speaking the same thing never change never deviate always the same hallelujah praise they cannot change [Applause] hallelujah never will change not much change on the third phase either because I'm gone hallelujah glory [Applause] you got that one now I may be seated it's got to say the same thing all the time art is in the Word of God see your sons and daughters shall prophesy means that they shall either for tell or testify now you look that up you get the Bible dictionary and see if it isn't right your sons and daughters shall prophesy now do you see the three faces brotherly love well the kindness holy decency prophecy rebuking spirits said you'd be a clean place in here yes and then there are repute them spirits will be clean in here hey and now God can come down in here hallelujah glory to God [Applause] amen yes sir holy decency prophecy

13 paragraph if they now how many knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit here is the mind that has wisdom now you stop paragraph 59 find it all three DS these church ages here pulling on the Holy Spirit speaking on how these those gifts would be working in their last days now we get gifts of healing working oh it's going it's going to it for brother there's a there's other gifts that's just one of them just did that's just a little minor thing now get this here why here's a far greater give right here which would be the best a gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the Word of God together and to show the church where we're standing then just to give somebody he'll which is which is the greater now you understand what I've been trying to show you where you're standing to put the Word of God together then we'll pray for the hard cases do you understand they're wise they keep your friends out of here keep your family out of here because you need the Holy Ghost so you

whole thing and the oven in Revelation 19:10 John saw brother branham name in went the under worship Him amen and John was speaking to Malacca and for Malachi was saying to John for the testimony of Jesus spirit of prophecy so by divine revelation since 1920 65 I have echoed Malacca for seven Co Shelton message amen which Malachi 4 was to restore back the original word to the church otherwise we store back the original faith what is original faith people think they have it the original faith is resurrection faith and what is resurrection faith this is a quote that they seen Jesus after he had raised from the dead seeing him working among them that is the resurrection faith restored back to a group and we have it here in this group we see Jesus in this group working among us giving out the Holy Ghost healing the sick Healing cancer healing lays that ought to be amputated Healing diabetes who is that Jesus working among us that is the faith that was restored back but it came in three
