[45:32] of man is saying it's a revelation in
[45:35] the season and he reveals it to
[45:37] whomsoever he
[45:42] will oh my
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:47] glory this is the disciple which testify
[45:51] of these things and wrote these things
[45:54] and we know that his testimony is true
[45:57] and there are also many other things
[45:59] which Jesus did the which if they should
[46:01] be written everyone I suppose that even
[46:04] the world itself could not contain the
[46:07] books that should be written
[46:10] amen my seventh
[46:13] Thunder praise
[46:17] God
[46:21] glory now Peter had the instructions
[46:24] follow me now he wanted to know what was
[46:26] was John supposed to do and Peter
[46:29] noticed John falling without the same
[46:31] invitation he had and John was his buddy
[46:35] and yet even though that's his buddy he
[46:36] still didn't want John to get in on his
[46:39] thing this is me and Jesus not you but
[46:41] yet when he goes in I'll be with you
[46:44] amen what are you following here for
[46:46] this is me and Jesus here and John want
[46:49] a little blessing he started
[46:51] folling but then uh amen so Jesus said
[46:54] what so he said what shall this man do
[46:57] amen and Jesus rebuked his
[46:59] curiosity by stating that if it was his
[47:03] will that he would live to his second
[47:05] comment that's none of his
[47:07] concern you mean to tell me that what
[47:09] I'm doing in here in New York is
[47:10] nobody's
[47:14] concerned my you mean that Trinidad
[47:17] ain't got nothing to do what I'm
[47:20] doing nobody in Guyana or Tucson or
[47:23] jonville or Europe there none of their
[47:26] business what I'm doing in
[47:29] here oh I thought they supposed to check
[47:32] me

[47:42] me my
[47:45] my thank I I'm
[47:47] free

[47:52] concerned about doing God's will in his
[47:54] own life they got they got to take take
[47:56] care of their own
[47:58] churches don't try to take care of this
[48:00] church
[48:01] here God taking care of this church they
[48:05] be seated oh Jesus said what is that to
[48:08] thee follow thou
[48:10] me Jesus words however were readily
[48:13] misconstrued as an an assurance number
[48:15] one that John would live on until the
[48:18] Lord's return he didn't say that he the
[48:21] the if was easily forgotten and John
[48:24] himself corrects this false impression
[48:26] in verse 23 said the Sayan went abroad
[48:29] John wrote it himself I wonder if the
[48:32] same thing has happened in this age how
[48:34] many says went abroad that the son of
[48:36] man never
[48:37] said and says went abroad about many
[48:40] things in the message I remember
[48:42] 1967 amen a binding Spirit came in the
[48:46] message to bind the ministers and some
[48:49] little some kind of a denomination was
[48:51] moving in and and only a few could
[48:54] preach amen amen and there's there's
[48:58] always those who who uh only want to
[49:01] hear the tapes and read the books and
[49:03] that Spirit was there then in New York
[49:05] amen and uh this tape went out and I
[49:09] knew that it's going to get out of New
[49:10] York and they going to here they come

[1:02:10] hear it and the Lord spoke to her I
[1:02:13] happen to see these words in my old
[1:02:14] notes tonight and spoke to her and said

[1:02:53] it's God's grace to let us see our
[1:02:56] mistakes that's what the preaching of
[1:02:58] the word is
[1:02:59] for and then you can repent and put them
[1:03:02] away and then you give the same Grace to
[1:03:04] your brother or
[1:03:06] sister so another ages here now Malachi
[1:03:10] 4 said on perfect
[1:03:12] Faith amen page four I'm picking up uh
[1:03:16] St Mark 11 that's where he he started at
[1:03:19] and so um he reads for very I say
[1:03:22] whosoever shall say this mountain and he
[1:03:23] comes on down he says and when you stand
[1:03:25] and pray and forgive if you have order
[1:03:28] against any that your father also which
[1:03:31] is in heaven May forgive you your
[1:03:33] trespasses and if you do not forgive
[1:03:35] neither will your father which is in
[1:03:37] heaven forgive your
[1:03:40] trespasses and verse 19 paragraph 19 now
[1:03:44] faith is based on forgiveness and here
[1:03:48] the prophet ties third pull Faith to
[1:03:52] speak to the mountains and ties it in to
[1:03:56] forgiveness brotherly
[1:03:58] kindness and you cannot have it unless
[1:04:01] you can
[1:04:03] forgive and then as we said this morning
[1:04:06] trying to get the church into a place to
[1:04:09] where we could really see Apostolic
[1:04:11] times moving Among Us that's what we all
[1:04:14] hunger and it's just laying right at the
[1:04:16] door we see it but we just want to see
[1:04:19] more of it we wanted such a flow that
[1:04:22] it'll be a help to us and flow out to
[1:04:25] others
[1:04:26] how many want
[1:04:27] that amen you could flow can you imagine
[1:04:30] on your job and Christ will be on your
[1:04:33] job and walk among your relatives and
[1:04:36] that anointing will be
[1:04:38] there and then they look at you and they
[1:04:41] know is something and if they seeds of
[1:04:44] God they'll fall down and save me
[1:04:47] Lord Oh
[1:04:50] My Oh
[1:04:53] my he that is in you volume 6 12 page 12
[1:04:57] paragraph 51 but if you he and brother
[1:05:00] BR picks up St Mark 11 here but if you
[1:05:02] do not forgive neither will your father
[1:05:04] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:05:05] trespasses then he says it's on
[1:05:09] condition see it's based on a condition
[1:05:11] is the
[1:05:12] faith did you notice that there the
[1:05:15] Thunders first came brotherly kindness
[1:05:19] Revelation then came the Thunders to
[1:05:22] give faith for Rapture and Grace that's
[1:05:24] the way it came in 197
[1:05:26] before amen it's got to come that
[1:05:29] way West Palm Beach Florida 1953 Rapture
[1:05:32] in faith will only be revealed to those
[1:05:35] who forgive their
[1:05:37] brothers teaching on Moses if we have
[1:05:40] one a among us we stand in damnation of
[1:05:43] Hell's
[1:05:44] fire perfect Faith now faith is based on
[1:05:47] forgiveness so I say tonight to
[1:05:50] brotherly kindness at
[1:05:51] charity that you might uh anoint your
[1:05:54] seven Thunders with
[1:05:56] love amen and let charity cover a
[1:06:00] multitude of sins the Christian attitude
[1:06:03] is one of Mercy toward the sinner
[1:06:06] together with a a hatred of the sin
[1:06:09] Revelation 22:17 and other Sav with fear
[1:06:12] pull them out of the fire hating even
[1:06:14] the Garment spoted by the flesh
[1:06:16] blemishes and spots on the Garment

[1:06:22] kindness is here and love descends on
[1:06:24] the seventh step to take all the evil
