the Ministries brother Dillard and roblo and brother Wesco brother Frank [Applause] my amen nobody really knew what the inspiration was I know I didn't know until Saturday before I got here amen you may be seated I was sitting there Saturday evening tired and weary trying to what is the inspiration I have a lot of messages and the Holy Spirit says well there's a couple of more seeds that need to be seated down the word made flesh in a Rapture and the resurrection so then I watched as the brothers moved into that by inspiration amen when brother brother Frank thought he had his message and brother Wesco priest took several thoughts away from him then he hit I'm going up in the first resurrection and then God gave brother Frank his [Music] message see his inspiration Amen brother Wesco declared that God's going to be in his flesh that's right he's already there yes sir brother Junior told you now that is now now Faith is your s sense oh my what are you going to say charity anointed Tabernacles we here receive you the Holy Ghost and they did last night my prophets right in front of you you heard the testimonies amen testimony amen but Revelation praise God amen glory amen brother Junior praise God may be seated so therefore and look how the testimonies of the uh precious brothers from Ethiopia amen praise God from Nigeria and then brother EK eekk my I know he didn't have the same name twice for nothing praise God EK EK twice I knew he had something to say Amen praise God brother Enoch and brother Olu my God praise God I appreciate these brothers you know a lot of our American ministers going over there think they're going to give them something taking their strange doctrines to Africa and had these brothers could preach in churches in America and set them on fire brother Bram said that America needs missionaries so there's some missionaries that come from Africa to America to preach brother Brown's message amen and I appreciate the respect amen that they have for the inspiration they not following me praise God I mean I'm not in Africa to do anything to their Souls praise God's got to do that God bless you [Applause] Brothers yeah praise God you may be seated and my brother Clyde Luke my God I'm still trying to get up there to Canada brother Franken Klein I haven't been there yet amen the Lord T is so give me strength of Hope to go up there man I tell you that's some church they skip when they take up the offering praise God they shouting and dancing my praise God they're happy brother yes sir we just appre appreciate how their testimonies tied and I watch listen to The Brothers how they say things you know and seeing these young ministers coming along and just laying it in there and brother R these young ministers will catch inspiration sweeping on to the second coming and they're doing it and the special singing and the worship my I tell you praise God all the singers and how everybody just sang on the spirit amen preached in the spirit testified in the spirit people in the spirit sh [Applause] Lord we in the spirit on the Lord's day this is the Lord's day amen well anyway what what an inspiration uh to come here by faith and see brother mus uh uh lay out um sent out this here the rapt in faith U announcement and then uh the second coming of the Lord on page 133 ah I feel the Lord spoke to Meen 1974 four and said these three steps is is hidden in my second coming I didn't know I understand it you know but he then explained and but then one came brotherly kindness in Georgia then it come then it thundered and and now a place in Christ adoption of Charity here so he put it there himself God says put it there and then we thought is this the time to flip over and say come and rejoice with us well you couldn't do it until you got it [Applause] first so you had to get it first and then you can say come and rejoice with us we found the Lost coin Brotherly Love Oh and by this yall all may know that you my disciples disciples so I feel like that's been thoroughly nailed down by the Holy Spirit I believe the third phase has been identified with a manifestation of the ministry of Jesus Christ and I was sitting there and I was going down I was going somewhere and I wanted what's the inspiration and I wanted the tape to to play I was going to Pennsylvania that's right down see our good friend the doctor amen people from Pennsylvania New York I know who I'm talking about and um he gave me some stuff one time and I said shoy Dooby I said what is this stuff here my God Amen but it's good for you though amen so praise God and uh amen so anyway uh I want to get a tape to play it's about three and a half hour ride and then I grab unchangeable God just just grabbed it out there I said something Tulsa grab it out then I heard it boom he says he says uh quote that and I quoted it Tuesday night I didn't say no more brother must picked it up and the Lord told him to make it present [Music] [Applause] tense that's how it comes from the prophet's message and it's here do you do you realize in your six sense I ain't talking about this now the six cense do you realize in there that this is on the third phase started here this revival is on now to the going away nothing can stop it no principality no power no demon things past things present things in the future is already history already God knows all your mistakes down to the resurrection and already forgave you and Justified you you cannot make no mistakes between hand the WRA in the resurrection that's already history glory to God in your sick senses [Applause] [Music] Glory you may be seated so I feel like the third phase has been identified with the manifestation of the ministry of Jesus Christ with healings and sealings and refilling and deliverances Etc what's that word one of the brothers explained that word there I never heard it like that before amen I thought he was speaking in tongues amen yes sir etc etc etc amen glory amen yes sir praise God now I now I believe that uh that now that charity is here it will vindicate the first phase of Brotherly kindness when you had to step out and George and everything was fine and everybody love you for the healing and you know Revelation and and so forth but then when you dropped over to that second phase prophesying rebuking then they all pull away it happens all the time that way and you know we've had it in the message for so many years uh people like to drop down to a lesser level when they don't have inspiration and they don't see God moving with them well well bless God I rather have the wrong Doctrine and have the right Spirit now when while you rebuking spirits and so forth they call your spirit wrong cuz they don't have the same Revelation or inspiration so therefore you got to have the wrong Spirit if you're so mean and hard and rebuking and and busting highs and so [Music] forth see God permit you to go through it to be tested see if they all walk away he only thing you can do is stand there and curse the thing in the name of the Lord praise God cuz it's right amen so you know we heard that so long wrong Doctrine right Spirit praise God brother but that's not going to take you in a [Music] Rapture God's Prophet God didn't say sent no Prophet here to give you the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine he sent a prophet here to give you the right Spirit and the right Doctrine but it's a [Music] revelation then those who don't have the Revelation they call it a wrong Doctrine or whatever amen then they say you're wrong anyway here what the prophets said when they go to fussing by scriptures uh um the godhead explained you may be seated page 15 two brother was arguing about something and as I said to brother sism or Schism and brother NES to answer your question I said now I do not take either side with you uh with you Brethren and I know as long as you fuss you're both wrong see because I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart uh than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart and they grabbed this you see I said after all it is your brother's it is your heart's condition I made that a practice to know this that if a man no matter what he does and how much he differs in what he says about me if in my heart not from just a duty well he yes well the Lord bless you I forgive you my God yes sir and what he says about me if in my heart not just from a duty but from my heart I can't love that man as well as I love anyone else and I know there is something wrong in here see amen that is right because no matter if he a little brother come not long ago a little Church of Christ brother and and old he stood up there and said this guy is a devil see he said he says there's a Holy Ghost and the man said there's a Holy Ghost in This Church of Christ you're a devil the guy is a devil he says uh he says there's no such a thing only the 12 apostles received the Holy Ghost and Divine Healing was only given to those 12 Apostles and went on about a half an hour and I said just a just a moment brother I think you ought to give me just a chance to defend this see that's all we've been trying to do for 12 years trying to defend these things am praise God I said you said that you spoke where the Bible spoke and was silent where it was silent and he said we do I said now you said there was just the 12 apostles received the Holy Ghost the Bible say there was 12 in the upper room when the Holy Ghost fell women and men and all and would you mind to tell me do you think that Paul didn't have the Holy Ghost and he received a long time after that and you said the gift of healing was only given for the 12 apostles and Steven went down a few days later and he wasn't one of the 12 he wasn't even a preacher he was a deacon and went down to Samaria and cast out Devils amen yes sir praise God and and then uh and I said oh brother it was very silent right there where he had to keep it and and after it was over I said now here's a prophet I forgive you for calling me a devil because I know you didn't mean that yes sir then when he got finished he come up and he said there's one thing I can say you have the spirit of Christ [Applause] praise God Amen so I feel that charity is here on this third phase to anoint our brotherly kindness to forgive those that have called us Devils Cults all kind of ungodly names and cursed you because you dare to step out and say seven thers give faith [Music] so now I believe that God will say come and rejoice with us brother I love you from here there be Christ Veil God In the Flesh speaking I forgive you oh praise God hallelujah thine the glory that's the presence you feel right now amen you may be seated you won't have to make you won't have to put it on now cuz it's here now all you got to do is mold yourself into [Music] it my so charity is here to forgive those precious brothers who have called us Devils because we realize that they didn't have the same Revelation and we realize that that those stones had to rub us to make us smooth you know make us five smooth Stones praise God and so they will I believe from here to the resurrection testify that you have the spirit of Christ when no matter what they say they send you dong in the mail you say God bless you brother I love you now don't try to do it out of season like most did there are those who say they believe the S done Revelation I'll trying to do that now Moses tried to go down and delivered him before he had this the spirit amen oh Hallelujah th the glory amen [Applause] yeah yes [Music] [Applause] when you see God's son and Revelation striking him of what you're what is all about here I got to turn [Applause] around yeah yes sir oh my just standing talking preaching love drops down brother Enoch I think somebody said take all the evil out of and you knows what he said he said your individual houses he say in the house here your houses listen what they saying amen amen you may be seated so praise God omnipotence is ready to do the miracul at the seventh Junction of time my why can I speak just a about 5 minutes a few seeds amen okay I'm trying to I don't know how I'm going to be here amen but I want to hit some I won't have time to read this I know I won't but this way a why chist speak page 10 I think any man or woman a boy a girl that takes in everybody and I think an intellectual conception of what they think the word is in so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality I think no church in its practice no matter how intellect ual and fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something that they can talk to uh that'll talk back to them that vindicates the written word you know that voice of the Archangel hanging there in the pill of fire speaking back to you and one day you go into prayer and just be talking all of a sudden voice will speak back yes my daughters rise up amen go tell your husband these words thus sayith the Lord that's what this third phase is all about Glory yes sir oh my now let's drop something in here for Rapture in faith she's going to be so most simple and humble it'll come according to the promised word and they'll be waiting for the I remember I was in the Tabernacle doing the Seven Seals people were sitting there in their five senses and they was waiting some we got back in New York some thought that the angel was going to blow a trumpet with wings in the pulpit and everything and all kind of Revelations my God somebody said uh brother K are you one of the 12 I said one of the 12 I said disciples I said well I don't know about the 12 by one of the disciples so I don't want to get into anything I ain't going to answer you right away until I know what you're talking about Glory praise God page 11 see why cist speak that's our inspiration what are you going to cry about Lord where's the Holy Ghost me speak just as we know page 11 as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming in the rapture we know that we live the time out the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for a Rapture in faith that can pull the churches together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in Now watch how he drops the rapt faith in we see a God that can raise a dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before Forest when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people do you see how that's going to kind of slip in on you and all of a sudden you're going to see sister Carter walking and sister uh bar Trager and our brother here from Florida and some say uh that's a false anointing they call it false anointing it would have already slipped in a c to the prophet's word not what they're calling [Music] it yeah oh it's going to move in see we've been waiting for it just Carter don't you see what that is now it's coming the Rapture in Grace is going going to heal you glory to the power of God going to raise you up out of [Applause] there it's just going to [Applause] [Music] happen yes sir where's it starting [Applause] here maybe seated that ought to give Rapture in faith to the people then when that light flashes from the sky that comes first then that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken to Heaven as all over with and they're still waiting around why say it the scriptures lies must first come why the voice will come back he's already to [Music] come oh Hallelujah my God so I believe the prophet's message will give us the right Doctrine and the right spirit amen to be ready for the Rapture amen we can't go with the wrong Doctrine right and the right spirit amen see it's got to be both together the Dynamics mechanics together amen well anyway how will it be praise God what shall we do with Jesus call the Christ I believe it with all my heart we know that he's going to do it but he's going to page 29 he's going to do it he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body that's what what we we beginning to do now see forming ourselves by our Revelation see into his image with his power from acts 18 you die you get a hold of that manifestation of the Angel Like Jacob don't expect of the pastor to do it for you it's individual Affair yeah you purpose in your heart I will be like [Applause] Jesus amen he said we we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourself into his image and see him watch uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them uh to us just before the wedding supper and we waiting and watching for that see we're waiting for his work sister Carter rise up Sister e rise of his work then he then he's United and they going to think it's false anointing it and that's him uniting himself the my the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit I didn't get fill yet don't you understand he gave you the mystery on Rising of the sun page 30 and 32 when the Dynamics come not only do you get a breath but you feel your your the mechanics so Quicken you lay your hands on the sick and the heal your spirit is filled inside and your mechanics is quickened the wonderful glorious baptism comes with everything GL the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit may be seated that we have worked in a small measure with our little birth amen while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body the spirit see now keep this in your mind I'm going strike it amen but when the head and the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would rise her up just exactly even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight through the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit amen well praise God so now or you say well well are you sure well he said uh question answer on the Holy Ghost goes Cod page 411 St Mark 11 Jesus said to this mountain and you heard what's been taking place that's the ministry that we entered into 1959 we way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we got to have Rapture in faith in a church that can that can be changed in a moment and taking up an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring the Brethren into power they'll be formed into the image you imagine walking back in your church and the power was there and you hit the door this third faith is in your church charity disguise his virtue to give you power sh the power of this church and that church will bring the Brethren amen and the power that church will bring the other Brethren now after all the Brethren come into power Rapture power then there'll be a general Resurrection he makes sure that he sends the power before the resurrection to form you into the word image and then the dead will raise well praise God okay one more quote I'm finished amen praise the

this far amen page 35 speaking about the raptures there's the three in the Old Testament one rapture's passed three's happened in the Old Testament of them prepared who the word of the Lord came to see the word of the Lord came to Enoch what was that word of the Lord it was a secret in the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] pyramid the second Bible the pyramid was the second Bible and it came to Enoch but Enoch knew what was inside the king's chamber so he reflected it on the [Applause] earth and that pyramid prepared Enoch the revelation of what was on the inside and then the word of the Lord came to to Elijah and he was a prophecy the word of the Lord was Jesus and he was raptured and the old Saints came up with him open up all ye gates oh my so now amen so the Rapture Enoch was prepared by the word for his Rapture and here on God's only provided place of worship page 40 let's pick it up here amen page 40 our Prophet is God's reflector how many knows that the ref doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't the reflection there has to be something stri the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection God to reflect the image of Christ the word see nothing else can do it you are a reflector that's the reason the prophet had to eat the the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect that word for that age and you got it now notice Enoch Enoch's per uh Enoch God's perfect reflector in type and he's your type now watch when God was through with him he just translated him took him up now watch the mechanics that he had reflected become Dynamics with the spirit and took them up do you see it he had to have the spirit of God upon him to reflect mechanic CU he knew what there was he knew it was faith and virtue knowledge and Temperance and patience God and brotherly kindness amen page 42 now there's a way a pure holy way a only meeting place that God will meet you not because you say God I'm a good Methodist Baptist I'm a good Pentecostal no uh because that you are in Jesus the word the part of the word that's being manifest

flesh that will reflect the Seven Virtues thundering out in sweetness and humility walking around the [Music] earth my my they are praise God I mean did you have enough already praise God glory so now we see en God's perfect reflecting type and when God was finished with him he was translated the mechanics that he had reflected become Dynamics with the spirit and took come up Enoch built a pyramid reflected the Seven Virtues Of The Pyramid a type for today then charity love projected itself and Sovereign Rapture and Grace took over Enoch and he was found not but he had a testimony he pleased [Applause] god brother Rim had a testimony he pleased God sh what did Enoch have a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture what is this bride's Ministry supposed to be the ministry of Jesus Christ to reflect your Jesus the reflection see it's the oncoming Su n in the oncoming so n in the resurrection and it's reflecting against you and you're a positive reflection a positive Shadow see Luther and West Pentecost was negative Shadows it looks something like it but your reflection will be a positive Shadow so much should the shadow will be over you like Peter and they'll be healed in your Shadow your Jesus the [Music] reflection Glory the word Jesus my praise God you are in the in Jesus the word the part of word that's being manifested for the day be therefore perfect I exal you there Seven

will be formed by the word in her flesh to prepare her for the Rapture and when the comforter is come the word will be made flesh in you maybe I got time just uh for a few quotes from I didn't read the other night shall I take the time Glory okay you said okay praise God okay may be seated the comforter I got my inspiration from page 22 and 23 he's speaking about uh I will not leave you comfortless if you check it out in the Greek I will not leave you an orphan cuz I'm your [Applause] [Music] father Glory I'm not going to leave you orphans to this filthy three and a half year tribulation period I'm not going to leave you oring to these devils and demons out here hallelujah praise God the world see me know what you shall see me and when the comfort is come the word will be

ghost in fire Glory Glory Hallelujah even the spirit of Truth he'll bring all things to your remembrance the things you couldn't understand what is brother Bram talking about what these Minister talking about these great Revelation he'll bring it to your remembrance just the same way he spoke I think in St John uh 2:22 when he come in the resurrection then they understood the scripture and the word that he spoke that same Resurrection pow is here now the comforter himself to make you understand the scriptures and the and reveal word and then you yourself will be formed by your Revelation not somebody trying to push it upon you but God commission you then there's no more Church babies be you no more children yeah you yeah you saved you you got salvation you know the father but come on you young men be strong the word of God abideth in you overcome the you have overcome the devil and God's going to make you fathers to know him from the beginning him will be in you at that day you shall know that my father's in me and I in you and you in me what day this [Applause] [Music] day amen there it is how long you mayy C is he going to abide forever then what is the word of God what is our comfort today page 23 it's when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God living in us and that's with the word of the Living God we stand that word is made flesh and dwell Among Us now that same word that was made flesh and dwell Among Us has become our flesh now how's that possible you're not a blade Luther you're not a tassel Wesley you're not a Shu you are green which is his flesh and all you need is for the germ inside you the grain to break out that germ form the spirit of the Living God and it come not only will you hear the word you see the expression of the truth from the inward Parts a reflection on this Earth it shall happen because we had a prophet who pointed us to it he said I will love my brothers I will love my enemy and you're going to say the same thing because it won't be you saying god pushing upon you to say it say it don't be afraid it'll happen it'll [Music] happen Glory has become our flesh he's with you now you maybe seated but it shall be in you now that same word that the prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh the same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds [Music] it is that enough to live for and die out to the what what means anything here anyway it's all condemned just waiting for a funeral service with all the Devils standing around as attendant and Paul Bears imagine the 2,000 demons are going to be Paul bears for their for their funeral services and the angels are going to be uh Scorch you the [Applause] glory GL talk about a Hallelujah talk about a praise to God I'm going in the resurrection [Applause] me then when that word is in your flesh that's when that's the reason Visions can break through the sound barrier that's the reason the vision can break through time barriers and say thus saith the Lord it shall be so and so and that's the way it is what is it it is the word coming forth from a spirit amen the spirit of Christ and the prophet speaking not our human Spirits hoping and thinking but the spirit of God [Applause] speaking who is me I asked you a question brother BR said you don't see me you see my body and you've never seen what I look like [Music] yet some you saw what I look like in a [Music] prophet it pleased God to put me in this Tabernacle but you've never seen me Prophet CES right here he said you don't see me you see my body that's why all these old American and different old flesh fails who is an American who is a Canadian European you never even seen the [Music] bride oh my my it's enough to bust every Spirit glory to God you don't see me I don't see you because I only see your body this is my hand but who is me that owns the hand this is my body but who is me it's a spirit then if it's a spirit and his spirit is in you in the fullness then you no more you you become Jesus then that Spirit speaks through the sound barrier th say up the Lord rise up Sister Carter [Applause] oh amen oh and if I'm born again and if you're born again it's God's holy spirit God's word living in us and if we compromise on this word and say we have the spirit of God how can we claim to be God to have God's spirit when God's spirit testifies of his own word he'll never move an inch from it no matter what denomination says how he's going to move from it when it is his own word the promise I'll be with you the comforter he said I'll send the comforter glory and when it comes again and when it moves into a church that's born again it'll come with the power and the demonstration of his being God's word the comforter in us bringing forth the exact thing oh Hallelujah now when the comforter come how will that comforter react how will it be page 24 some priest claimed it was a Catholic church and brother Bram straightened him out he said listen there something happened because in the early days you had signs and wonders if you the Catholic church that the Holy Spirit was with you the early Catholic Church spoke in tongues the early Catholic Church prophesied they had Prophets The Early Catholic Church done all these Miracles they heal the sick they rais the dead they scream they hollered they acted like maniacs they danced in the spirit they were C crazy and when the comfor is come it'll be the same reaction it won't be no [Applause] different see and then when they look at it they blaspheme it they attribute it to Satan the work of God what happens then oh my yes sir he said my God he says uh praise God he said don't shut yourself up in a Cell of some organization take a seller somewhere of unbelief to deny God's word I don't care what bishop or anything says let the word come in you made flesh by the power of the Holy Ghost and take over your flesh and control you and testify through you the works and the mighty powers of the Living God yes sir page 25 the Comfort has come the Comfort has come what is it God's word anchored in your flesh that gives you eternal life that gives you the resurrection power to bring you from the things of the world from blind Traditions to walk in the sunlight Glory here's this prayer for you page 27 Oh God heal every sick person that comes forward granted Lord save every sinner and fill every believer with the Holy Ghost and may the comforter abide watch until he's made flesh in US Among Us Amen in the person of Jesus Christ again the comforter will abide on the

reflection of Jesus Christ his word made manifest you are the reflection of his word don't you see your type Enoch Enoch reflected his mechanics on the Earth by the spirit but when the seven steps was sealed in the pyramid Malachi for revealed to the bride how to be a statue of a perfect man to reflect Jesus Christ on the Earth again the word made flesh the secret that Enoch knew the prophet pull it out and give it to you and I that we might manifest be the ant the type over here of Enoch the type with the same Revelation Enoch had Enoch knew how to please [Applause] God and when we are formed to the word that pleases God there's my son that the devil's trying to destroy and pervert in the world there's my da [Music] us they're pleasing God then after Enoch reflected his mechanics on the earth now watch he reflected his mechanics and it's got to be done by charity virtue pows got to reflected and after he reflected it then his reflected mechanics become Dynamics with the spirit and God took him up and he was found not a sign just before then and Malachi 4 reveal this translation mystery and CLD uh 11 13 and 14 and 15 may be see that now hold on now don't don't uh uh uh don't let

St Luke 17:30 oh come on Church pianos organist are they already there praise God come on come on pray let's get prayed up and get out of here let's dve this thing down where you'll never stay from it you'll never change from it praise God it's so embedded into your [Applause] soul St Mark 11:23 have faith in God for verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain be not removed and be not cast into the sea shall not doubt in his heart may be se but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he Sai there you are so I'm saying it for myself for my family for New York [Music] City there your church not a faith but a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture perfect faith page 10 Amen brother man now there's the brandom Tabernacle there's the Church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power see the word is the power and the Seven seal power word is here which is the Holy Spirit the anointing and the Holy Spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that Faith to move it see what I mean he gave us he gave power to his disciples and they did that but then something happened they couldn't cast the epileptic whatever it was Spirit out of that little boy nine disciples couldn't do it and three were up on the mountain and Jesus was being a tooed and they could not do it time had run out from a all and all the rest of them they're finished here's the city of Faith here R in [Applause] faith they're building for the world we building for the the city whose building maker is God yay praise God oh Hallelujah yes sir the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that Faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it by faith amen Noah building AR by faith Enoch was translated now page 10 that's what it takes see perfect faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he's come upon us 1963 after the Seven Seals that was the Holy Spirit that come upon the people up on these croes and things Holy Ghost himself the par of God but where's the faith to ignite the P that's what it takes perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he come upon us Faith to ignite to see great things the faith something that presents it to you Hallelujah there you are oh hallelujah amen so here we are now the last commission praise God was St Mark 16 and that would last until the shout and the voice of the Archangel here we are right in it and then he drops down and gives us another commission we pick up the first one and reflect it back on the earth the same church same Apostolic time the same seat church and then we take that brother Brown said invisible Union of Brian that plus this do you realize that you are [Applause] commissioned when you go out of here you are [Applause] commission to go in the Rapture to form from the word image in you to raise the dead that's your end time commission the Lord himself descended from Heaven to give you this shout through the this commission through the [Applause] [Music] prophet so Faith isn't something that somebody else is trying to get you to do I am trying to get you to do nothing for 12 years it's something that God commissions you to do he said see you have got to know and you cannot know until you have faith and Faith produces that no so faith is that no faith is that thing that says it from nothing the bride will be waiting for that that revelation of the Rapture then they will have that no soul I know that I know that I know well how do you know that well I just know so I'm not a minister trying to get you into the Rapture but God is calling you revealing the revelation of the Rapture to his bride he commissioning you for a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture the bride is commissioned to come to a perfect faith to bring on the resurrection Noah was commissioned Abraham was commissioned Moses was commissioned the HEB was commissioned Peter was commissioned to walk on the Water The Early Pride was commissioned Luther was commissioned Wesley was commissioned the Pentecostal was commissioned Malachi 4 was commissioned to bring this message and you are commissioned to be formed into the word image to May a dead may be raised oh the same Mark 16 commission the last was to last until the shout and the voice then Elohim has now commission you to bring back the last commission and to receive a revelation of the Rapture of the word made flesh how to be prepared by the word of the Lord for the Rapture and the bride cannot fail because she is predestinated unto the adoption of perfect man to bring up the with the ministry of Jesus Christ Rapture power for the Rapture in faith this is where the bride stands today July 4th 1986 this Rapture Faith convention the spoken word in due season is God's original seed revealed by the prophet Malachi for the seven seal seven Thunders Malachi for message God's hidden thoughts seal in El him and Loos before the foundation of the world the revelation of Jesus Christ revealed as a word seeds for the bride seven Thunder Revival and every promise is a word revealed seed for this hour the Thunder's Perfection the super brde the Rapture the whole thing a now a revelation is what number one that you see it before it happens not wait till it's all there and say I got it no it will rain before it rains will'll have Isaac before it happens seven Thunders give Faith before it [Music] happens say it speak it watch it materal [Applause] life that you see before it happens and then you express it in word form like knowing Abraham then the word the word seed now is not your thoughts amen so word SE it takes a hole in in in into your church or in the conventions and it has become material then the word seed becomes a real seed it must be spoken before it can be become a real seed let there be let there be a fish and the Holy Ghost follows the word wherever he speaks [Music] [Applause] [Music] it then the Holy Spirit Broods over that word see because it's spoken and it cannot return back void it must accomplish what it says then it Broods around and it becomes a real seed and it's real that's what he said everything every seed after his own kind the Baptist after his own kind the Methodist after their own kind Pentecostal after their own kind in the message after their own kind but a PR after his own [Music] kind yeah oh I don't want to take it too long here then it's got to now you express it then it becomes not your words but God's reveal word express then it's got to happen because it was the it was the mind of Christ speaking its own thoughts for the bride in her season then bringing to pass his own thoughts into word seeds then becoming real seeds once thought and then spoken it's got to happen yes sir Malachi 4 was expressing in a word message in words the thoughts of God and when we by faith can accept that word it's got to become material that germ in you we can accept the word made flesh that has got to materialize around that germ that's in your soul and there's will be the person the real seed same with the body the body the new body can only materialize around the person so what's this wrong Doctrine and right Spirit [Music] business they going to wind up at a school of prophets praise God after they see with the with the mantle everything still they ain't going to believe it oh praise God God Amen I know I believe it Glory yes sir it's got to become material seven thund will give me Faith for Rapture and Grace therefore I believe it I speak it it's got to materialize cuz I said it I said it it's not my words it's God's words because God's original spoken word cannot return to him for it Seven Seals page 242 four things quote the spoken word of God is God's thoughts expressed that they become creation when is spoke by a word and then that is when you may be seated he presents it to you as a thought I'm almost finished your thought this is a quote and it is re is revealed to you now watch and then it's still a thought until you speak it so on these tapes and books these are still thoughts from Elohim through Malachi 4 until the people in this message speak these thoughts it'll never materialize though they in the message and though they believe it but they've got to speak it if ye say to the [Music] mountain oh Hallelujah my God then it's still a thought from God to Elohim on the tapes and books until you speak it so therefore I'm not waiting for anybody in this message to try to get me to have wrapped your faith no it's something that God commissions you to do as a man think in the heart so is I'm going up in the first resurrection praise God it has been spoken and now so shall it be unto me to give me a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture brother Wesco said that God going to be in his flesh he in my flesh I'm going to be in a Rapture the countdown is on the Zero hours hell the Rapture is at hand let us become the word made flesh this is astronaut time Glory you say as not time sure Hebrews 11 1-3 everything in the natural as Hebrews says was made of things which do
