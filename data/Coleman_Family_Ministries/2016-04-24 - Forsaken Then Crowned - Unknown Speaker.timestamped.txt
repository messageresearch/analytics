[0:02] Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you

[2:02] everything overcome against the seeds of
[2:04] God father sin that presses out to those
[2:07] who could not be here this morning
[2:09] that's my family Lord that are waiting

[2:14] those will gathered around waiting on
[2:16] the coming of the Lord blessed the
[2:18] strangers indicates the small in God and
[2:21] be with that people this morning and
[2:23] come and feed us by the wayside but we
[2:26] pray we asked it in Jesus name and for
[2:29] his glory amen
[2:30] you may be seated we're certainly happy
[2:36] to be here this morning to offer up
[2:40] spiritual praises unto the Lord and it
[2:45] is good to say it we often praises to
[2:47] the Lord well this is the hour and the
[2:49] devil's trying to get us to offer
[2:51] praises to him this is the hour when the
[2:54] Devils are trying to make us bow down to
[2:56] his gods to worship His image but we are
[3:01] like the three Hebrew boys we are
[3:03] persuaded we shall not do it whether we
[3:07] live or die amen will not give in while
[3:10] God is able to keep us here take us
[3:13] through the fiery trial and our clothes
[3:16] won't be burned it won't smell it the
[3:19] kalaiy fire Amen here bring us true
[3:22] smell like a rose or crushed rose praise
[3:26] the Lord
[3:27] we're so happy to be able to give a
[3:30] testimony this morning though we stand
[3:32] in this pest house we know that
[3:34] everybody here is sick
[3:35] amen and the enemy seemed like he's just
[3:38] had a extra time on the little children
[3:43] the past two a few weeks months I saw
[3:45] all the different little ones babies and
[3:47] so far they all sick had been smoked by
[3:50] the enemy and sister komen she told me
[3:53] to send her twigs
[3:54] morning as she's still seen amen and
[3:57] though the enemy's got her down but she
[3:59] still got a praise for others she wishes
[4:00] because she was here this morning but
[4:03] has just been one thing after another
[4:04] since October for Joanne I think it's
[4:06] because that's going around about three
[4:08] times now and Joanne she come down again
[4:10] just the other day Friday I think it was
[4:12] 103 so we just don't know we just keep
[4:15] moving and I was able by God's grace to
[4:18] go through the whole past three months
[4:20] and just Friday I picked up a virus and
[4:23] a habit announced or throat so you pray
[4:25] for me this morning but that's the way
[4:27] it is and so we know that this is a pest
[4:30] house and it's full of sickness and
[4:32] corruption but he promised us amen that
[4:36] we'll have a body like his body if we
[4:39] should die right now just very moment a
[4:41] man will pass into another body there's
[4:45] what a tabernacle already waiting but he
[4:48] put us in here for his glory and don't
[4:50] worry he's coming amen
[4:53] for he promised we can hear the old
[4:56] buckboard coming down the road right now
[4:58] amen it's the coming praise the Lord
[5:01] because he has already descended it on
[5:05] his way down he sent down the shout
[5:07] first he's still coming down amen praise
[5:11] the Lord so we're happy this morning to
[5:14] give a testimony that God and we will
[5:16] certainly have sorry to hear about
[5:18] brother and sister Roble does little
[5:20] daunted Emory's because she had
[5:22] pneumonia but she's doing okay now and
[5:25] so we continue to pray for her and all
[5:27] the other little ones at the enemy has
[5:29] smoke it's all for purpose and so we
[5:33] know as we stay in God's will because
[5:35] your show is why but if we suffer with
[5:38] him we shall reign with him and Paul
[5:41] wanted to know the Fellowship of his
[5:43] suffering and I believe that Oh because
[5:46] all Christians in this hour we have to
[5:48] fellowship with him and his sufferings
[5:51] be baptized immersed into his sufferings
[5:54] and then we'll understand see and then
[5:57] we shall reign with him see so we just
[6:00] have to go through with this and so now
[6:02] we're approaching a tremendous time and
[6:05] I just thought that
[6:08] Salwa now I was able to get a little
[6:09] time from the job and I'm very tired
[6:12] my mind is tired and you know you don't
[6:16] know what it is to come here suddenly
[6:17] morning into face and knowing that
[6:19] wherever the word going forth to the
[6:21] light the devil all the demons gather
[6:23] right there
[6:24] to stamp it out and it just takes away
[6:26] everything your mind your strength
[6:28] everything and so I'm going to take a
[6:30] little rest and I always try to say that
[6:33] always say that but I never stopped
[6:35] preaching but I have been led to stop
[6:38] preaching for the next month or so so
[6:40] therefore this is the last time I
[6:42] believe unless the Lord should change it
[6:44] be here for a while and Brotherhood
[6:46] he'll be here brother Kurt but I'll just
[6:49] be trying to rest my mind see so
[6:51] therefore I thought though in doing so
[6:54] that I would get a chance this morning
[6:55] to get in a few licks Amen see because I
[7:00] still being training now see but right
[7:04] now get a chance to drop in a few licks
[7:07] to the enemy because we've got to know
[7:09] where we're standing in and what is
[7:12] going on and we know all across the land
[7:15] and around the world that many people's
[7:18] hearts are stirred and they all feel as
[7:22] something is fixing to happen this year
[7:23] and even I was noticing if you'd been
[7:27] noticing how President Nixon the many
[7:30] spiritual things which he's saying call
[7:32] about the Word of God and so forth last
[7:34] shall be first first shall be last and
[7:36] then he made that tremendous point in
[7:39] his inauguration speech that if we will
[7:42] stop shouting and listen to the words of
[7:46] the voices and seemed to strike
[7:49] everybody and that's just what it is
[7:51] going on spiritually also the people
[7:54] because the message been screaming at
[7:56] Harland by the scissors because it says
[7:58] that but they would just hold still and
[8:00] listen to the still small voice then
[8:03] they'll know what he said hey man so
[8:05] because you know it was elijah guard up
[8:08] on Mount Horeb there was giving you a
[8:11] type that when our Elijah would come it
[8:14] wouldn't be the fire the earthquake the
[8:17] whirlwind it beat a still small voice
[8:20] because he uses because the fire thing
[8:22] also because Elijah did all kinds of
[8:24] things to see call down fire and also
[8:27] kill the fallen the prophets and so
[8:29] forth because God uses that also but in
[8:31] his season so what he was doing was
[8:34] trying to drop in the fact that there
[8:36] would be a still small voice that would
[8:37] come to us way in the in turn and he
[8:41] dropped it in there for type and so
[8:43] therefore there's still those who are
[8:45] looking for the fire there in quake in
[8:47] the world winds and so forth but the
[8:49] still small voice have has come which is
[8:52] Christ and so a John picked it up
[8:55] because he'd because do any miracles at
[8:57] all justice just a voice the Word of God
[9:00] repent there's the voice of God and so
[9:03] that is God's purpose that that's why he
[9:05] took them up on the mountain Mount
[9:07] Transfiguration and the Elijah came back
[9:10] to witness that it was to be the still
[9:12] small voice but God said hear ye in him
[9:15] hear him the voice the word of God and
[9:19] so Elijah saw that that come to pass and
[9:22] here we are now and everybody though God
[9:25] even brought it back and tight because
[9:27] those three things struck brother
[9:28] branham's ministry also the fire the
[9:31] whirlwind and the earthquake and so but
[9:34] when you come off that mountain out in
[9:36] Arizona everybody came in February to
[9:38] hear the still small voice that's what
[9:40] you wanted to hear so therefore those
[9:43] who are hearing it you're blessed today
[9:45] and God is moving you on and like I was
[9:49] saying so many people are waiting for
[9:50] different things and they all are
[9:53] looking forward to something happening
[9:54] here in April
[9:56] 69 it's a note was a spiritual month and
[9:59] I was just thinking how how Israel took
[10:02] the Passover a way back in April and it
[10:05] Quebec in Egypt and how they they cross
[10:08] the Jordan April and Christ was born in
[10:11] April and the resurrection was in April
[10:14] and 1906 April the Pentecostal blessing
[10:18] was poured out and 1909 God's prophet he
[10:22] was born in April and all these
[10:24] spiritual things happen April I guess I
[10:27] suppose the people are wondering what is
[10:29] going to take place this April and we
[10:31] see what is happening to California
[10:34] the lands just getting loose there and
[10:36] just getting right for God's judgments
[10:38] and we know that something is fixing the
[10:41] half that we know whether it'll be the
[10:44] resurrection come forth we don't know we
[10:47] can't say and many are looking for all
[10:49] kind of things in the resurrection so
[10:52] we're looking for Jesus Christ and I
[10:55] thought it was startling that knowing
[10:57] that in his judgment he comes with
[10:59] earthquakes because back in Zechariah I
[11:02] think there was about Mount Olivet
[11:06] because it would cleave when he would
[11:08] come back the second time but if you
[11:10] notice it if you read in there good it
[11:11] doesn't say that because it had to be
[11:13] earthquake there it just said that the
[11:15] land would be split see so the
[11:17] earthquake in itself could be somewhere
[11:19] else so but because they're noticing
[11:23] that I noticed that when the earthquake
[11:27] did come that dumb on the Good Friday of
[11:32] March 64 that there was an earthquake
[11:34] and that was on on Good Friday and now
[11:37] we are looking the people looking for
[11:39] something happened this time on Easter
[11:41] and on the Good Friday when that
[11:44] earthquake was before soon it was the
[11:46] earthquake the veil rent and who they
[11:50] thought because though was behind the
[11:52] veil because was not behind the veil he
[11:54] was out on the cross and Good Friday 64
[11:57] the veil rent and then right behind that
[12:00] in June 14th the unveiling of the mighty
[12:03] God hope your kids praise the Lord
[12:07] so therefore just God knows what he's
[12:10] doing
[12:10] exactly and so we don't know what could
[12:14] be this Easter where there has to be
[12:16] anything that's east or not but one
[12:18] thing we know that's something it's
[12:20] fixing to happen
[12:21] and what we want to do is to be prepared
[12:23] and to be ready and God has he can give
[12:27] us nothing greater than to prepare us
[12:29] than his word the sword so it is with
[12:33] that that we turn to the Word of God
[12:35] this morning let us turn to 2nd Timothy
[12:38] the first chapter we read the 13th and
[12:42] the 15th verses hope everybody's feeling
[12:45] fine this morning
[12:47] hope we have up the shades let the
[12:50] sunlight come in amen
[12:53] and whatever having home would have
[12:56] happened on the road on the subway on
[12:58] the bus leave it there yeah amen
[13:01] we're here to worship the Lord now leave
[13:04] all those things outside praise the Lord
[13:07] that was yesterday for getting a thing
[13:09] that I'm behind praise God
[13:13] Ephesians 6 chapter 10th verse through
[13:16] the seventeenth verse Philippians the
[13:20] fourth chapter of the 13th first I'd
[13:24] like to title this forsaken then crowned
[13:30] forsaken then crowned holdfast the form
[13:35] of sound words which thou has heard of
[13:38] me in faith and love which is in Christ
[13:42] Jesus that good thing which was
[13:45] committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[13:47] Ghost which dwelleth in us this town
[13:51] knows that all they which are in Asia be
[13:54] turn away from me of whom are of fie
[13:57] jealous and her Hermogenes and Ephesians
[14:03] the sixth chapter 10 verse finally my
[14:11] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[14:14] the power of his might put on the whole
[14:17] armour of God that you may be able to
[14:20] stand against the wiles of the devil for
[14:24] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[14:25] but against principalities against
[14:28] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[14:31] this world against spiritual wickedness
[14:33] in high places
[14:35] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[14:38] of God that you may be able to withstand
[14:40] in the evil day and having done all to
[14:44] stand have it done all to stand stand
[14:48] therefore having your loins gird about
[14:50] with truth and having on the breastplate
[14:52] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[14:56] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[14:59] of
[15:00] all taking the shield of faith wherewith
[15:02] you shall be able to quench all the
[15:05] fiery darts of the wicked take the
[15:07] helmet of salvation the sword of the
[15:09] Spirit which is the word of God
[15:12] Philippians 4:13 I can do all things
[15:15] through Christ which strengtheneth me a
[15:18] lawyer blessing to read of this word
[15:20] like I said I like to title this
[15:22] forsaken name crown now we know what the
[15:27] word four-second means abandoned
[15:29] desolate for long to leave because to
[15:34] renounce and I was hearing a message the
[15:37] other day you're trying always to find
[15:40] out what is going on where are you and
[15:42] see I was hearing the message of the
[15:45] Prophet present stage of my ministry and
[15:49] there he was making a statement in and
[15:52] stuck at my heart I thought I would just
[15:53] come here this morning and this let the
[15:56] Lord elaborate on what he said there
[15:58] because it's the Word of God he said
[16:00] when a man stays true to the word not
[16:03] just in one meeting every meeting when a
[16:08] man stands true to word the time will
[16:11] come when they will leave him they'll
[16:15] leave him or her or whoever they are
[16:17] when he stands for the truth they did it
[16:21] to the Lord they did it so from Noah all
[16:24] the way through they will leave you when
[16:27] you stand with the word they did it to
[16:30] Paul here and that's what this is about
[16:31] Dimas and these men here all in Asia see
[16:34] they do that because he God does that it
[16:39] comes a time when he separates in the
[16:42] church see and they think that you
[16:47] washed up when men begin to leave you
[16:49] when men begin to talk against and so
[16:52] forth walk out of the church and so
[16:54] forth and people begin to get cold and
[16:57] so forth and don't want to praise God I
[16:59] said what is all washed up begin to call
[17:01] you a denomination and so forth you all
[17:04] washed up see this has proven through
[17:06] all through the Bible
[17:08] no matter how popular because you may
[17:11] have been and no matter how much you
[17:14] have tried to do and how much they have
[17:16] seen God blessing you see but God said
[17:20] in the Bible there's got to come a time
[17:23] when the spiritual ones who stand with
[17:27] that word hold true to it they will
[17:31] forsake you they will walk away from see
[17:34] and so brother Brown was saying that
[17:38] you've got to hit that place for
[17:41] everybody hit it in the Bible all the
[17:44] heroes of faith hit that spot and you've
[17:46] got to hit it
[17:47] you can't bypass it see it's a lion
[17:50] vanity if you think that you can because
[17:52] because go around it uh-huh you must
[17:55] face it so therefore you might as well
[17:57] put on the helmet of salvation amen you
[18:02] might as well begin to gird yourself up
[18:04] with the breastplate of armour amen and
[18:06] your lawn is Girt with truth amen
[18:09] you might as well put up the shield of
[18:11] faith and take the sword of the Spirit
[18:14] in your hand we can do some good amen
[18:18] well he said it in the seals there when
[18:20] that that little group that can handle
[18:23] the Word of God put it in their hand
[18:25] they'll be able to slice and cut and
[18:27] stop everything whatever they wanted to
[18:30] stop nature amen see
[18:32] so is usually such a time when man or
[18:37] the Minister of the people have stayed
[18:40] true to the word and all man has has
[18:43] because forsaking him that God steps in
[18:46] in their defence amen see so just like
[18:52] the song they that wait upon the Lord
[18:55] amen they shall mount up with wings as
[18:58] Eagles they shall walk and not faint
[19:02] they shall run and not get weary they
[19:05] that wait upon the Lord are you waiting
[19:08] upon the Lord Amen well God has spoken
[19:10] this is going to happen for he has said
[19:13] so and just a few types there nor stay
[19:18] true to what God said is going to rain
[19:21] and the world system says it's not going
[19:24] to rain because there there never has
[19:27] been any rain science said so but he
[19:30] stayed true to that message and they are
[19:32] all walked away from him except those
[19:36] ordained to life and then when they had
[19:39] because he stayed true to the word they
[19:41] all forsook him then God came down in
[19:44] his defense and crowned him with her
[19:47] ride in the ark over the judgments Amen
[19:51] praise the Lord
[19:53] just like because Moses the same thing
[19:56] ever
[19:57] Israel has seen all the plagues did the
[20:00] supernatural and so forth
[20:02] and God got him into a spot like right
[20:04] now see failure on one side there is he
[20:07] on the other side and then Israel so why
[20:10] did you bring us here we should have
[20:12] stayed back there and dad back there
[20:14] they forsook Moses he said why crying
[20:17] and he's speaking move forward then God
[20:19] crowned him took him right on through
[20:21] amen so therefore we reach that time
[20:25] ourselves Daniel was also because
[20:29] forsaken and throwing into the lion's
[20:32] den that right and when he was all
[20:35] forsaken stay true to the Word of God he
[20:37] would not worship those gods down there
[20:39] and and they sent out a Supreme Court
[20:43] because a decree that you can't pray in
[20:47] a more public schools and so forth but
[20:50] he just bust the window open and well
[20:52] and because prayed anyway
[20:54] amen praise the Lord wake up now amen so
[20:59] therefore he stayed true to the word and
[21:00] then they took him into the lion's den
[21:03] that's just where God wanted him to
[21:05] prove that he's a god that can deliver
[21:08] Amen he gets you in there into the den
[21:12] somewhere where all the world forsake
[21:14] you and laugh at you mix sport with you
[21:17] like like Samson and then God comes on
[21:21] the scene we feel right now that we
[21:23] entered in
[21:24] in the fire amen and a greater reader
[21:28] out there and they make your sport there
[21:31] laughing where is your God you believe
[21:33] this message back in 63 back there where
[21:35] is it
[21:36] this God that he's there listen to
[21:40] everything is saying and he is going to
[21:42] deliver but he wants all man to forsake
[21:46] you first he wants you to go through
[21:49] something first the fiery trial and then
[21:51] he could come on the scene and deliver
[21:53] you praise the Lord
[21:55] so we see then that God crowned Daniel
[21:59] also changed the king's heart and said
[22:02] that this is the God that can deliver
[22:04] and we see it in that Jesus Christ he
[22:08] embraced his cross he was forsaken and
[22:11] God crowned him on Easter morning and
[22:15] when he rose from the dead
[22:16] hey man and we see right on down and we
[22:19] come down here to our our brother
[22:21] branham as we saw him and here he was
[22:24] back in his second pull here and all had
[22:27] forsaken him when he went forward in his
[22:30] first pull they all loved him popular
[22:33] wonderful see humble like Christ but
[22:36] when he began to prophesy and come down
[22:39] on that word they begin to leave just
[22:43] like you said see and as he stood did it
[22:45] they thought he was all washed up like
[22:48] he said big he was washed in sea he was
[22:50] washed in and then God crowned him with
[22:54] the third Pole the Word of God and
[22:57] brother Brown made this quote
[22:58] I hope he'll crown my ministry with this
[23:02] by letting me take the clothes of the
[23:05] word and dress his bride and the clothes
[23:08] of the word and for his righteousness I
[23:10] hope your crown me and let me stand
[23:12] there on that day and say behold the
[23:14] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[23:16] the world
[23:17] amen and he did he took the word the
[23:21] seven sealed message and called the
[23:24] bride with the word
[23:26] and all the bright had to do was to take
[23:29] off that old filthy ray from her old
[23:32] church amen come out of the world and
[23:34] then step in to this and through this
[23:37] clothing there just because put it on
[23:39] put on that garment amen
[23:41] see so therefore today we say like Paul
[23:45] here hold fast to the form of sound
[23:49] words the outline the pattern which you
[23:53] have heard and we heard God's prophet
[23:56] bring us to fall out of here he brought
[23:59] a message
[24:00] it had a pattern an outline it was
[24:03] Seventh Seal vision and by revelation we
[24:07] saw it and he says to keep that good
[24:10] thing because Paul gave two charges to
[24:13] Timothy here he charged him to hold the
[24:16] floor hold a pattern stay right with it
[24:18] and to keep that good thing the gospel
[24:21] the Word of God
[24:22] and we have the same charge well he said
[24:25] that in the end time like it was it in
[24:27] the beginning the bride would be given a
[24:30] charge the word Eve had to say in charge
[24:34] but she fell but he said that he would
[24:37] have a bride and she will not fall she
[24:41] will hold to the Word of God so we see
[24:45] then that what about this bride today
[24:48] now the bride today just like Eve was
[24:52] given that good thing to fortify herself
[24:55] with against Satan because God knew that
[24:59] he was going to face Satan saying and
[25:03] she failed the test
[25:05] amen now we were told that we are going
[25:10] to come face-to-face with the devil amen
[25:14] see and he laid out for us to his
[25:18] prophet he step along the way each one
[25:21] here are going to face Satan face to
[25:23] face see and he told that he fortified
[25:27] us with his word Eve had the same thing
[25:31] you know she had a word of God see and
[25:33] he gave us the pattern to form the
[25:37] seventh seal message say
[25:39] it says just take it to where it is for
[25:44] God knew knew that somewhere along the
[25:46] line that the enemy would step up his
[25:49] attack until it comes right on down to
[25:52] the strong delusion but he has because
[25:55] increased his attack now the enemy this
[25:58] morning does not want me to say this I
[26:01] know that but like I said imma get in a
[26:05] few licks by the grace of God amen so
[26:09] therefore don't be fearful for God has
[26:11] not given you a spirit fear he's giving
[26:14] you a spirit of power of love of a sound
[26:18] man amen
[26:20] for this Devils that want to hold you
[26:22] they want to make you bow down to a man
[26:26] that's nice see you can't see you I just
[26:28] read it to hear you you cannot see these
[26:30] things in C is two hundred thousand
[26:33] thousand demons out there you cannot see
[26:35] them the only thing that you can do is
[26:37] to pray Lord lead me lead me through
[26:40] this way here you can't see out at all
[26:42] but your understanding on the inside has
[26:45] eyes the Holy Ghost the Word of God and
[26:49] those eyes is anointed when I say that
[26:53] it may see that it may know which
[26:55] because way to go so now the bride knows
[27:01] she will face Satan face to face she
[27:04] knows that she is in a conflict
[27:07] now the bride knows by revelation right
[27:11] now she is defeating the devil by the
[27:15] Word of God she knows that and she is
[27:18] marching on to victory amen
[27:21] though in this pest house don't knock
[27:23] down the so forth she's still marching
[27:25] over she knows that now she knows she is
[27:29] in a contest which is a test of strength
[27:32] a tug-of-war on one side is the demons
[27:36] pulling you into his fire amen on the
[27:40] other side is the bride pulling this way
[27:42] and right now he's going this way like
[27:44] this here you see it's going back and
[27:46] forth amen
[27:48] now if somebody back here misses the
[27:50] word in there you fall down see them in
[27:52] now so hold still stand amen
[27:56] just hold on to that loop and pull it
[27:59] see but you won't have to use your own
[28:01] strength though because we're going to
[28:03] show you why see now the great conflict
[28:06] started up in heaven when Satan or
[28:09] what's kicked out then because he was
[28:12] kicked out
[28:13] he became the the enemy of God's people
[28:17] and he has strength short of God's
[28:21] strength just remember that now see and
[28:23] therefore it is his purpose to pull
[28:26] every one of us into his fire but he
[28:28] can't do it see but there's got to be a
[28:31] battle and we end it now
[28:33] and he but this time is deception amen
[28:36] see so narrow the word was the best
[28:39] thing that's what that good thing see
[28:42] the best thing that God could give his
[28:45] people - because combat Satan
[28:47] now watch the word is God nobody is
[28:51] stronger than God all right and the word
[28:55] is God see and the word becomes our
[28:59] strength amen
[29:02] God then is in his church and he becomes
[29:06] the church's strength for he's the word
[29:09] first it was a part of the word
[29:11] justification sanctification the gifts
[29:13] but then he come down himself in the
[29:16] shell the word and then the shell is the
[29:19] strength that's pulling the rope you
[29:22] follow me now see therefore God is in
[29:24] his bride now with strength confirming
[29:28] her whole is still to the day of Christ
[29:30] and she know that and because now what
[29:33] she knows that only as she believes the
[29:36] word not try to figure it out but just
[29:39] believe it
[29:40] that's her strength see there's your
[29:43] strength believe the word is your
[29:45] strength
[29:46] now that's because simple but that's
[29:48] what it is see to me now so now the tug
[29:51] goes on any man and now the word has
[29:54] come and watch the main bout is going to
[29:58] come up soon see this is only the
[30:01] preliminary
[30:02] the main ballot will be the world consul
[30:05] versus the bride in a battle amen
[30:09] but God has already tipped us off when
[30:12] an hour comes watch the third pull
[30:15] what's the knockout blow at that time
[30:18] but until that time comes fortify
[30:22] yourself train know your enemy
[30:26] amen see that's right see now study
[30:29] about a man see train for this great
[30:32] contest
[30:33] just like fight us see now or when a
[30:37] fight in the natural is training he
[30:39] wants to know his opponents strength so
[30:43] what does he do he studies on film if he
[30:47] has them or all his weaknesses and all
[30:50] his strong points whether he has a
[30:52] strong jab or left hook or Red Cross or
[30:56] uppercut he studies the whole thing out
[30:58] see and he watches his footwork because
[31:01] even some old-time fighters there was a
[31:04] fella I knew because hurricane Jake
[31:06] because he could just because fight with
[31:08] his head down and just watch your feet
[31:09] and he could tell by your feet what you
[31:13] were getting ready to do and then he'd
[31:14] hit you saying
[31:16] so that's right see you man now that's
[31:18] why our feet are to be shod with the
[31:20] preparation of the gospel of peace and
[31:22] you can watch a man's feet to see where
[31:24] he's going at you know what he's doing
[31:26] amen you can watch his feet
[31:28] see see if they go into because shady
[31:30] places and you know what kind of fight
[31:34] he gonna make amen pray in the war so
[31:38] now the fighters study out their
[31:40] opponents all right but the whole thing
[31:43] that they are training for a knockout
[31:45] blow see now while we are studying our
[31:50] opponent the enemy is studying our
[31:53] strategy also here come the enemy
[31:59] studies our strategy with the word he
[32:05] study us he studies us out as we come to
[32:07] the Lord John 3:16 or acts 2:38 and he
[32:11] watches see he watches if we stay with
[32:14] that word
[32:15] or if we reason affection memory he
[32:20] knows how to get you in in I hope you
[32:23] got that he knows just he's studying you
[32:25] out
[32:26] he just watching you watching your life
[32:29] in the home on the job wherever you are
[32:32] the enemy is watching you he knows just
[32:35] where to punch you out it yes sir
[32:38] amen see he studies out the ministers
[32:41] because you want to get them first see
[32:45] what kind of life they got see if they
[32:47] go for popularity see if they go for
[32:49] women see if they did they'd go for
[32:52] money he knows gifs with a halo bet when
[32:56] they come down the road and he'd knock
[32:57] him out every time see he studied out
[33:00] the brothers in the church to see if
[33:02] they're jealous humble brotherly
[33:05] kindness see if they're puffed up one or
[33:07] a preacher so forth and so on
[33:09] follow me now he stays them all out to
[33:12] see where they're going now you don't
[33:14] want to say he stay after women see what
[33:18] to see what they do it see if they love
[33:21] the fashions of the world see if they
[33:24] want to because cut to hear all these
[33:25] things they studying them out see if
[33:27] they're lusting after because someone
[33:29] else's husband studied them out then he
[33:31] knows that he can use that nature down
[33:34] the line somewhere he can use it see oh
[33:37] yes a man that he know what this said
[33:40] you know now I'm only taught about
[33:41] fighters
[33:44] amen praise the Lord so he studies out
[33:49] the church to see who he can catch off
[33:52] guard to see who's weak in there and he
[33:56] could send her a adoption through there
[33:58] see a window I could catch him see me
[34:02] now
[34:02] he got him all figured out because God's
[34:04] gonna use him to shake him loose
[34:06] they're still because too many farmers
[34:08] shake him loose see and so what they're
[34:11] deprived knows that she's fortified with
[34:14] the word where you go I'm going with the
[34:18] word Amen see me now so now we see
[34:22] there's Satan studies out the church
[34:24] Satan studying out Adam and Eve as you
[34:28] walk to the garden he wants them day in
[34:31] and day out
[34:32] he watched him he watched him he wants
[34:35] them did he finally a concluded that
[34:37] Adam was the seed of the word because he
[34:40] couldn't get him then he figured that
[34:43] well Eve is part of the word I can get
[34:45] her just like today
[34:47] Eve is the shook he can get her but the
[34:51] bride today not like a then she is the
[34:54] word for she's bone of his bone flesh of
[34:59] his flesh spirit of his spirit but on
[35:03] his blood life of his life
[35:05] she is the word and Satan cannot get her
[35:09] and he knows it too and she knows that
[35:13] he knows it that's why she walks out
[35:15] there with the word and stands there and
[35:18] chops those Devils down now she will be
[35:21] forsaken for taking that stand oh oh yes
[35:25] praise the Lord and they'll leave her
[35:27] they will first take her for taking that
[35:30] stand against the enemy but she knows
[35:33] where she's going
[35:35] biron by amen by and by we want to take
[35:39] a chariot ride amen praise the Lord
[35:42] I asked her not right so now he knew
[35:46] hard to get to Eve with the best
[35:49] strategy that he can use on her and that
[35:52] was to reason with the word he got it
[35:56] see Rees
[35:57] with the word because the spirit of the
[35:59] of God is deceit and because on the
[36:03] inside inside out here in the mind is
[36:06] faith comes out here see and then either
[36:10] it's faith here moving this body by the
[36:13] word coming because coming to come into
[36:15] the mind or is reason one of the other
[36:18] and if what in he knows that so he come
[36:21] in reason with Eve
[36:23] so Eve hit him with the word she said
[36:26] God has said that we should not eat from
[36:28] there he's but in he reasoned he said we
[36:31] know that God has said that therefore he
[36:33] preached see but see God knows that this
[36:36] way you know how to bring life see oh
[36:40] then I can go out west you mean and do
[36:43] it quicker I don't have to because I go
[36:46] to the cross and die
[36:47] I can live in the flesh you make sure
[36:49] you can just wait for this natural thing
[36:51] be fine you mean otherwise if I us
[36:55] because start abstinence because I can
[36:58] do it yeah sure you can that's the way
[37:00] to do it any other way to do it see
[37:02] something that you can do see when he's
[37:05] already done it just believe it there's
[37:08] nothing that you can do but believe on
[37:11] him that's in the Word of God and hold
[37:14] to it that's all you can do that's all
[37:16] he wants you to do it
[37:17] amen see so now never reason with the
[37:22] word just believe it don't try to
[37:24] explain it don't try to figure it out
[37:27] see you cannot figure out God when you
[37:31] believe it
[37:31] that is your sprint that it that's just
[37:34] fits right there
[37:35] that's gone right there in you and the
[37:37] devil sees it because you believe hope
[37:40] you see that when you believe it that
[37:42] their own eyes you believe it and he
[37:44] backs off see me now but he come again
[37:47] with a different trial next day see in
[37:50] the tug of war every day so now as we
[37:53] were saying we collect in training you
[37:58] study all the moves shadowboxing body
[38:01] punches all these things but then you
[38:03] get a sparring partner that right and
[38:06] you get the best spot important that's
[38:09] just like your
[38:11] just like him have all his moves then
[38:13] right
[38:14] so therefore the best byproduct that God
[38:16] could get today for us with false
[38:18] christs for the false Christ has all of
[38:22] Satan's moves he's smart he's slick he's
[38:27] cunning he's so sincere he's handsome
[38:30] and sweet and he got a nice gimmick for
[38:34] you sending right now so therefore we go
[38:38] into the false Christ time and then we
[38:41] begin to spar with him
[38:42] and when we watch him we watch him we
[38:45] punch him and so forth we watch we watch
[38:47] and that's what we've been doing now
[38:49] past few years hitting those false
[38:51] christs here hit them over there hit
[38:53] them over there follow me now see
[38:54] because see he's the closest thing to
[38:57] him Satan
[38:58] that's his emissary following in our
[39:01] friends so therefore we are in training
[39:03] now right now and we're aspiring see so
[39:07] now the enemy studies out our strategy
[39:10] so the false christ move in trying to
[39:13] feint and bob and weave and hook and jab
[39:15] and move across see and we just you know
[39:18] say can we have been because trained
[39:20] well and week because counter him amen
[39:23] because counters punches see now we are
[39:27] standing right now and we and we have
[39:30] been in a battle right now and having an
[39:32] oil stand staying anyway because it's
[39:35] coming a great battle see this great
[39:38] main bout the world council against the
[39:41] brass it's coming up amen so we've been
[39:44] sparring here with these Antichrist and
[39:46] nothing I'm not left and right may
[39:49] sparring partners not with to the ropes
[39:52] Amen praise Allah
[39:54] so now God promised that the manifested
[39:59] sons would come back and take the
[40:02] kingdom back our inheritance is sonship
[40:06] then right eat with this eternal life we
[40:09] are to be over this domain here joint
[40:13] heirs with Christ was got to be in the
[40:16] fullness of time when the sons of God to
[40:19] men offense and they come back and take
[40:21] back the kingdom
[40:22] at the main belt the spoken word is our
[40:26] knockout blow when the time comes
[40:29] there's a a real crises coming and the
[40:32] bride won't be in that place see watch
[40:36] now where he can use that body and fight
[40:40] his fight follow me now friends praise
[40:43] the Lord
[40:43] okay now Christ then we'll use our
[40:47] bodies that's well trained that has
[40:51] eliminated all the waste and so forth
[40:53] train down fire and when you're in
[40:56] training because you sure won back in
[40:57] the city aim anything and so he'll use
[41:03] our bodies to borrow - we've to faint in
[41:07] in this main belt but now just our
[41:11] bodies now see that's well trained he'll
[41:14] be the head amen and his head will tell
[41:19] this body when the bow hey when the
[41:22] faint when the jab and when the hook
[41:24] finally now hit the head will it'll be
[41:28] in the rain but we'll have his head our
[41:31] body and it he'll move this body into
[41:34] position for the knockout blow Amen
[41:38] praise the Lord

[41:42] enemy's weakness and when the enemy come

[41:50] throw it send me now the bread will
[41:53] knock him into yesterday

[45:14] you see back in Paul's time and all the
[45:18] all the curly Christians their greatest
[45:20] desire their greatest joy was to die a
[45:24] martyr see yeah that's exactly right
[45:27] because Paul wanted to a Peter want to
[45:31] be because crucified upside down cut it
[45:34] because it wasn't worthy see they all
[45:36] wanted to march into that arena and die
[45:40] or modest death and they shout it and
[45:42] scream and saying to the Lord as they
[45:45] stood there under the power of God and
[45:47] gave because their lives that had to be
[45:50] because the corn wheat had to go in the
[45:51] ground but this time the greatest desire
[45:55] the greatest joy for the bride today
[45:59] just to come through these past years
[46:01] hole into the Word of Life being that
[46:05] beacon that was turning it out with the
[46:09] word that has not because defied herself
[46:11] with that word see me now and she'll
[46:14] stand there and be crowned in his glory
[46:17] at the end time because there's got to
[46:20] be a bride that will stain on this earth
[46:22] and be changed in a moment in a
[46:24] twinkling of an eye
[46:25] that's our design that's our reward to
[46:29] staying here on the earth here and to
[46:31] face the enemy with this knockout blow
[46:32] that's for now back there was different
[46:35] see so now the bride now knows that she
[46:39] needs the more strength see some rapture
[46:42] and strength to because take her out of
[46:44] here so therefore she's only waiting for
[46:48] the sound of the Russian of the wind and
[46:51] top of the mulberry tree when he says go
[46:56] out and he goes out before then you go
[46:58] out until then you wait you train you
[47:02] move you die off to the flesh you're
[47:04] waiting but you know when he says move
[47:06] out
[47:07] you move out amen yes sir see so while
[47:10] we're waiting for the sound of the voice
[47:12] in the top of the tree we pressed about
[47:15] we stand to the Word of God amen
[47:19] now the bride that stays true to the
[47:22] word housewife' all young men missus
[47:25] whoever you are
[47:26] see if you have added the clothes of the
[47:29] word to your faith see if you have put
[47:33] on these clothes and add to your faith
[47:35] virtue and pacing all these things in
[47:36] sea and then we know because we are
[47:39] individual pyramids that write all of us
[47:43] is a pyramid and is seven steps in a
[47:46] pyramid therefore we're waiting for God
[47:48] to cap off our life the pyramid each one
[47:52] of us he is to come and be our head cap
[47:55] it off amen praise the Lord
[47:58] see so now is when we are forsaken at
[48:01] this hour now when men walk away from
[48:04] you curse you say all manner of evil
[48:07] about you the bride rejoices for she
[48:10] knows he's reached the hour
[48:12] amen when she's ready to be crowned when
[48:15] that time comes and we're in that all
[48:18] right now see me now there's something
[48:20] fixin to happen and that's when he will
[48:22] crown your life with the glory of the
[48:25] word here's the word but is full of
[48:27] glory from one glory to another glory
[48:30] amen and we waited for the fullness of
[48:32] his glory to come and Crown our lives
[48:35] whip that glory amen
[48:37] see now because in closing praise the
[48:41] Lord
[48:42] now remember there will be a nightmare
[48:45] going on at this time see now you may
[48:50] say well why are you so zealous to
[48:53] always lay on that way and keep rebuking
[48:58] and reproving and correct with all
[48:59] longsuffering well I thought about the
[49:02] other day I taught them to customer
[49:04] white house now look at this that's is
[49:06] the this terrible condition that we in
[49:08] here if brother Branham didn't spin out
[49:11] there on the word and didn't listen to
[49:14] those popularity Devils don't priests
[49:17] just don't say that see them in there
[49:19] and didn't tell us about the women and
[49:20] all these things in the ministers in the
[49:22] false Christ if he didn't do it where
[49:24] would we be today so far be it from me
[49:28] to back up now Amy so therefore he did
[49:31] it
[49:31] Paul did it Peter did it all the hairs a
[49:34] figure therefore by the grace of God if
[49:38] I got a little bit of voice I want to
[49:40] stand and proclaim that word I want to
[49:43] tell the citizens if they have straight
[49:45] away to the world repent and come back
[49:48] to God for if you don't it's like a dog
[49:51] trainer to his own vomit
[49:52] I'll Pig wallet in his own slop is what
[49:55] it is plain and simple
[49:57] when God I bet it would be so gracious
[50:00] to calm down himself on the earth his
[50:03] spirit and hide it behind human skin he
[50:06] shows all kind of things out here and
[50:09] then back up from the Word of God see
[50:13] that's our calling and therefore I look
[50:16] at how many devils sit there in the
[50:18] church D because three Hebrew boys they
[50:22] were told to worship gods
[50:25] and the image now the same devil is
[50:29] trying to get us to worship the same
[50:30] gods Antichrist and the image same thing
[50:35] and now these gods are men trying to be
[50:38] like Christ coming with because their
[50:40] own teaching worship they're sending me
[50:42] now and will not do will knock them out
[50:45] because in training amen
[50:47] yes sir so now we see them so you may
[50:51] wonder why why yourself because hard why

[54:47] fiery judgment of God to keep you here
[54:50] for three and a half years in judges now
[54:52] that's the Bible and that's what we are
[54:55] preaching to you this morning to line up
[54:57] with the word of God this is not because
[54:59] it's not me telling you that yes this is
[55:01] the message this is the cool Oh God
[55:04] coming down to call this people out amen
[55:07] praise our God didn't see people repent
[55:10] and turn around and go right back to the
[55:12] same muck and mire you say God what is
[55:15] happening God be merciful to them what
[55:17] is wrong with their mind that going
[55:19] insane and they come into God's present
[55:21] lusting around and wanting this and
[55:24] wanting that and laughing in your face
[55:25] and talking about you everything else
[55:27] you know what's gonna happen to them you
[55:29] can see it you can see it right now so
[55:32] what happens now
[55:33] the end time remember there will be it
[55:36] that's the third nightmare in your sleep
[55:39] inhale on their number three he brings
[55:43] all three amen
[55:44] see the time is up he said himself time
[55:48] shall be no longer your time is up in
[55:51] the fullness of time he gathered all
[55:53] things in heaven and in the earth the
[55:56] bride into himself and then the
[55:58] judgments fall on the rest now there's
[56:01] three crowning's the bride her life
[56:05] she's heading to virtue patience
[56:08] temperance knowledge godliness brotherly
[56:12] kindness that's her life that he gave
[56:14] her the strength the word you could do
[56:17] it if you want it you can laugh at it
[56:18] but then because she does that he slips
[56:21] thereon in all his glory
[56:23] now watch the earth is narrow the
[56:25] setting first is demand then the earth
[56:28] becomes the setting then the
[56:29] battleground just final blow just final
[56:32] bout then God brings all of the power
[56:35] amen
[56:36] that's in the kingdom he brings the
[56:38] angels they come also and the bride is
[56:41] ready she has a spoken word that comes
[56:43] to the earth then the devil brings up
[56:45] all those demons in Hell all those
[56:48] filthy devils walk-ins - they're all on
[56:50] the earth and there they meet face to
[56:53] face the bride meet him for a short time
[56:55] then he crowns her
[56:58] with his life his help himself and gives
[57:02] her a body like his but he changes it in
[57:04] a moment in a twinkling of an eye now
[57:06] there's only two more crowning's the
[57:09] foolish virgins who play around whoo
[57:12] laughs or maybe because they'll have the
[57:13] revelation and so forth they is just not
[57:17] God's election they the only way they
[57:19] can escape it because I said over here
[57:22] in Revelation 14 I believe it is
[57:24] relation 14 nirn I think it is are you
[57:29] with me revelation 14:13 and I heard a
[57:34] voice from heaven saying now this was
[57:36] just 13 Jill screaming don't worship the
[57:38] Beast nor his image nor the mark in his
[57:42] hand see and I heard a voice from heaven
[57:44] saying unto me write blessed are the
[57:46] Dead which die in the Lord from
[57:48] henceforth yea saith the spirit that
[57:50] they may rest but because from their
[57:53] Labour's their works do follow them your
[57:56] work comes right to you the breath their
[57:58] works follow them
[57:59] therefore they have to crown their life
[58:02] with their own life just because
[58:05] Christ's life is is is not there for
[58:07] them and the rest of the world they
[58:10] crown their life with Satan's life he
[58:13] floods his sperm into them his own
[58:16] nature and deludes them all and he had
[58:19] his bride here the world counsel he has
[58:22] his legions of demons the Pope and
[58:25] always men's day all they all here and
[58:27] he has a son of mice running up and down
[58:29] I was reading because some stories of
[58:31] the things that didn't want to do to
[58:34] these Christians put them into all kind
[58:36] of sodomite X and everything else or
[58:38] force them to all kind of things the car
[58:40] they gon do to them in a short time I
[58:42] ain't trying to scare you I'm only
[58:44] trying to tell you these things is this
[58:46] is really this is a nightmare and they
[58:49] gonna have to die to go out of here
[58:51] therefore you can die now to this world
[58:55] you can die to this world to the fashion
[58:58] of this world to the things of this
[59:00] world to everything here you can die to
[59:02] right now and then you can live unto
[59:04] Christ be alive unto God or you could
[59:07] still dilly-dally flip flap around
[59:11] hallelujah praise the Lord and one day
[59:14] the brat is gone dead and Christ comes
[59:18] you ain't gonna know it for it says that
[59:20] that they are paired to the bride and
[59:23] they tell the bride that the rapture is
[59:26] at hand
[59:27] it's a secret coming so they only comes
[59:29] to the bride there's a resurrection
[59:31] power ministry coming that's to the
[59:35] bride only for Christ's mercy article on
[59:37] the earth but to everybody but when he
[59:39] rose from the dead that was only the
[59:42] bride that's all so therefore only the
[59:44] bride will know he's even back here in
[59:46] resurrection power the rest won't even
[59:48] know it and they'll go right on
[59:49] preaching they'll go right on shout and
[59:51] scream and holler preached the same
[59:52] message here but the bride will be
[59:54] walking humble walking humble say
[59:56] nothing wait for that knockout blow
[59:58] god bless you forsaken with crowns
[1:00:01] walking on with her cross that I always
[1:00:03] come and friends I'm living for you I'm
[1:00:06] looking for it I don't care who says
[1:00:08] what if nobody want to pray if they
[1:00:11] don't want to worship God you don't have
[1:00:12] to see me now but there's a nightmare
[1:00:15] coming and you're in it right now you
[1:00:17] can see it out here yourself now open
[1:00:20] your eyes and see it yourself
[1:00:22] and then think what God is doing for us
[1:00:25] and then we fussed at God see give glory
[1:00:30] to God thank him and praise Him he's
[1:00:33] doing this for purpose he's making us
[1:00:35] diet in this nature here
[1:00:36] what he's doing is die to the things of
[1:00:38] this world here so the end time brings
[1:00:42] to the earth the glory of God and hell
[1:00:45] on earth both of them together on the
[1:00:47] earth brings both of the back here the
[1:00:49] glory of God for a short time and this
[1:00:51] knockout blow comes the sons of God take
[1:00:53] back the kingdom the benefits are in the
[1:00:55] way they're going did they take a Asuna
[1:00:57] track and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:59] and they go on
[1:01:00] the countdown is on the fire takes them
[1:01:03] up the rest on here are left to Satan in
[1:01:06] a strong illusion goes out you know now
[1:01:10] you cannot withstand it see when they're
[1:01:13] what loosens this they already because
[1:01:16] being because deluded right now see but
[1:01:19] there's got to be another falling away
[1:01:20] it's coming see
[1:01:22] so therefore
[1:01:24] those who have stayed with this message
[1:01:27] the past three years or so 1066
[1:01:31] they've been laughed at that ain't a
[1:01:33] message you got to do so on so you got
[1:01:35] to go over here and many have even
[1:01:36] walked away from here and cursed you
[1:01:39] that's right
[1:01:40] curse you said that ain't nothing their
[1:01:42] denomination walked away from it they
[1:01:44] failed to see the blood atonement just
[1:01:48] like Balaam
[1:01:48] he look at Israel and the way they look
[1:01:51] but he didn't see that because blood
[1:01:53] atonement there you look at them so
[1:01:55] others look at you what kind of group is
[1:01:57] empty they don't see that blood hang in
[1:01:59] there the word day in and day out the
[1:02:02] word amen the word is here that blood
[1:02:05] sacrifice is there they will see them

[1:02:44] blood of God who are you trying to
[1:02:46] entice with your short dress or the
[1:02:49] fashions of this world the men who else
[1:02:52] got to see and he said watch that you

[1:07:11] place if two people want to hear that
[1:07:13] gospel there'd be a place that you won't
[1:07:15] have to because clamor with devils to

[1:07:57] to be here for judgment and the only
[1:07:59] ones who can go
[1:08:00] while is to die with their own lives and
[1:08:02] their bride she goes out she goes up for

[1:08:09] she's in Christ and he gives her his
[1:08:11] glorious body amen

[1:08:28] your trial from now you tell me what
[1:08:31] would you do see where you gonna get
[1:08:34] because all your because it could the
[1:08:35] trial from is ordained of God you are to
[1:08:40] believe for his salvation that you're
[1:08:42] sanctified you keep him sanctified for
[1:08:46] the hour is coming live brother Graham's
[1:08:49] dream where God told him there was mrs.
[1:08:52] Fenton and those people there in the
[1:08:54] house of hell it's in his dream on a
[1:08:56] work his faith Express and he's I can't
[1:08:59] do anything myself no strength he says
[1:09:02] speak in my name he said how the hell
[1:09:04] give way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:06] Christ the walls come tumbling down and
[1:09:08] the people come out deliver it and I
[1:09:11] believe it the name of God will deliver
[1:09:14] the people one more time there'll be one
[1:09:16] more ride I believe that God will speak
[1:09:18] through his bride to bring deliverance
[1:09:20] so you got to believe other words faith
[1:09:23] is you can't see no kind of way out of
[1:09:26] it that's what is faith
[1:09:28] see when you can't see how to get out of
[1:09:30] it God said so they're not free
[1:09:35] well you can see how to get out of it
[1:09:36] ain't no faith then right what kind of
[1:09:40] faith if you know we're gonna do the
[1:09:42] Golden City over here sit down wait and
[1:09:44] holly's go to God and see faith no sir
[1:09:47] faith faith is like what they had they
[1:09:50] did understand the Lord but Lord where
[1:09:52] could we go now alone has the words of
[1:09:56] eternal life amen
[1:09:58] so we thank the Lord this morning to
[1:10:01] know where we stand so I say to the old
[1:10:03] people to the young people if I never
[1:10:06] see you again

[1:10:09] earth and I have not failed to because
[1:10:12] declare to you the gospel the message
[1:10:14] this morning say and therefore whatever
[1:10:16] your condition you in right now repent
[1:10:18] from that if you entangle somewhere and

[1:10:23] coming forth soon when he comes forth he
[1:10:25] brings a dip in Christ with him this is
[1:10:28] coming see and he said before that that
[1:10:32] California would sink no I don't
[1:10:34] understand it

[1:10:37] do you say he is in 64 he said that I
[1:10:40] predict California will sink before the
[1:10:44] coming of the Lord and when God comes he

[1:11:17] of God for the mercy of God and repent
[1:11:20] of all I can tell you see and until that

[1:17:59] I'm looking forward and what is to bring
[1:18:01] on the nightmare mental condition
[1:18:04] exactly right the mental the prophets
[1:18:07] told that in Revelation those are not
[1:18:10] physical those are spiritual things over
[1:18:12] there and the LSD and all these things
[1:18:15] is bringing it in now and they will go
[1:18:17] insane they're completely nude all kind
[1:18:21] of lewd worship and everything else the
[1:18:23] devil and you see it coming and what is
[1:18:26] to go mental
[1:18:27] the movies come in we're all kind of pro
[1:18:29] version is here now and 69 to bring it
[1:18:32] all forward it's here right now then
[1:18:35] here's the President Nixon his great
[1:18:37] friends is the angels of Sodom Billy
[1:18:40] Graham now that could just be happening
[1:18:42] that way and they've been friends for
[1:18:44] the past 20 years and his theme is
[1:18:46] you're 19
[1:18:49] uniting bringing the country together
[1:18:51] bring it in with the church and state
[1:18:53] all together see and that's the same
[1:18:56] theme of God uniting but the devil with
[1:18:58] his perversion and therefore we're in
[1:19:00] the our friends thing and so two things
[1:19:04] that happen the glory of God has to come
[1:19:05] to the earth and the all a hell is to
[1:19:08] come up on earth right here faint and
[1:19:11] hell is to be here for three and a half
[1:19:12] years and only the those who keep the
[1:19:16] commandments of God and hold on to the
[1:19:19] testimony of Jesus Christ can escape it
[1:19:22] outside of the bride's indoors oh don't
[1:19:24] you want to be in the bride amen
[1:19:27] think well praise God this so whole
[1:19:29] believes it's myth with all your heart
[1:19:31] died out to the world and say Lord leave
[1:19:34] me that's all and it tells you what is
[1:19:37] the heart should I be
[1:19:38] well because in closing of Scripture
[1:19:41] Ephesians 4 tells us in the fifteenth
[1:19:45] sixteenth verse but speaking the truth
[1:19:47] see speaking the truth
[1:19:49] holding it true see a walking in the
[1:19:52] truth think and love the love must come
[1:19:56] think and then when it love come
[1:19:57] speaking the truth in love walking in
[1:20:00] love acting in love talking in love amen
[1:20:03] si si may grow up into him in all things
[1:20:08] he's the head and he wants to be
[1:20:11] preeminent they told the Colossians in
[1:20:13] all things but we have to grow up unto
[1:20:16] Him in all things they with love and as
[1:20:18] the desert her brother man told us that
[1:20:21] nothing but perfect love will take you
[1:20:23] to that place that right and he dropped
[1:20:25] down his perfect love on the bride and
[1:20:28] if she goes for any love for bacon but
[1:20:31] yoke Roman one of these moines won a
[1:20:34] crown amen
[1:20:35] full right now in the congregation here
[1:20:38] you try to live godly and maybe some I'm
[1:20:41] I laugh at you alright you know what
[1:20:43] you're doing do they know they might
[1:20:45] think you're old-fashioned whatever it
[1:20:46] is think and thank you cuz you're always
[1:20:48] trying to be right with the word and so
[1:20:50] forth do things right then they'd laugh
[1:20:52] at this
[1:20:53] door that become safe at the devil
[1:20:55] they're not trying to get y'all do it
[1:20:58] out do be about your father's been
[1:21:00] through everything right because by the
[1:21:02] grace of God try to do it think he knows
[1:21:05] his heart God knows your heart you love
[1:21:07] him
[1:21:07] pray so he loves us this morning you
[1:21:10] want you to know that though would you
[1:21:12] feel for thinking the crowning is coming
[1:21:15] and every servant of Christ comes to
[1:21:18] that point and I believe the bride is
[1:21:20] just about in that situation now the
[1:21:22] crowning he will crown up with the glory
[1:21:24] of the word of God and you'll see the
[1:21:26] life of Jesus Christ on earth once again
[1:21:29] same ministries same power and then as
[1:21:32] she nears the headstones she does be
[1:21:34] very acts of God on the earth coming
[1:21:37] right down like him and then the fourth
[1:21:39] of times you get of all things in heaven
[1:21:41] into himself and I believe it that
[1:21:43] knockout blow it'll come at that time
[1:21:45] the Christ Himself will be right in that
[1:21:48] bright it'll be him and he will create
[1:21:50] right through our little that's our

[1:22:13] left hook or right the head knows what
