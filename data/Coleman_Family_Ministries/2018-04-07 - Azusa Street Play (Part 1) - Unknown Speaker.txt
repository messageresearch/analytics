repose relax as you witness the recapitulation and elucidation of historical exploits that forever repre costs and transform the sacrosanct a religious world the ones I'm Lloyd all starchy in credo Dogma within the Christian realm were replaced by boisterous Pacific spirited praisings you follow me I wish I could see your faces right now at the result is unprecedented paroxysm of or explosion of the Holy Spirit you will experience a vivacious proliferation of jubilation that will unfold unfurl and emanate from this very stage as you rejoice and resonate to the captive preparations of spirited and intransitive and I will say even Cosmo tellurian melodies all the events in characters portrayed in his venerable production are bonafide authentic representations of actual fortuitous happenings and personages the dissertation she will hear were culled from the actual sermons and teachings of Reverend William J Seymour as well as the testimonies and affirmations of Azusa believers at this time I beseech you to quench suppress and lull or mobile and halt of all commutative devices and converse devices in order to ensure Universal on obstruction and non disjoint activity throughout the performance well I'm kidding I want to welcome you to the performance and I will just recap some of what I said more simpler language the last thing I said was to please turn off your cell phones all the way off because the communication interferes with the electronic microphones we have also please no flash photography or anything of that sort that would not have existed there as industry and I do want to welcome you to a zoo the street the musical written and directed by Ruth Robledo and performed by the pharmacies Gospel Tabernacle drama ministry [Applause] I want to take you back to the beginning of the previous century to a time where there were people across this country who are not satisfied with their religion and their churches and felt there was more to God they began to seek more of God the seed for the sister city of I began in Kansas spread to Texas and eventually exploded in Los Angeles and what happened transform religious world to this name it was the perfect the Pentecostal movement in the beginning of the restoration of spiritual gifts to God's church and God used the most unlikeliest people to produce this revival uneducated poor of many races and ethnicities they got it together with all color lines blurred at a time when identities that did not happen they were led by an african-american or a Negro as it would be called in those days at a time when white people sitting under the ministry of a black man would have been blasphemous so as these events unfold just keep in mind that all of the scenes you're about to see are based on actual eyewitness accounts the characters that will be portrayed are real characters the sermons that will be preached are real sermons and the testimonies are also testimonies and the actual words of the

blessed Sunday morning here in Los Angeles California pardon me I forgot my hat god bless your sister Nia thank you amen well the Lord is good he's been blessing me I've been thinking of heaven I now I travel many places but I never been to the West and it's my honor to be with you this morning all the way from Houston Texas god bless you well Saints for my little sermon this morning if I had to pick a title to it I would call it receive ye the Holy Ghost and church it's so important for us to receive the Holy Ghost with speaking in tongues because without it we cannot see our Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah so the first step and seeking the baptism with the Holy Ghost is to have a clear knowledge of the new birth and our souls which is the first work of grace and brings everlasting life everlasting life to our souls therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God amen today every one of us that repents of our sins and turns to the Lord Jesus with faith in Him receives forgiveness of sins justification and regeneration are simultaneous the party sinner becomes a child of God through justification the next step for us is to have a clear knowledge of the Holy Ghost of the second work of grace wrought in our hearts by the power of the blood and the Holy Ghost amen for by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified we're of the whole East Coast also is a witness to us that's in Hebrews 10 14 and 15 the scripture also teaches that both he that sanctifies and them that are sanctified he's so good he that sanctified and they who are sanctified all one glory to God for which cause he is not ashamed to be called their brethren amen isn't the Lord gracious as Hebrews 2:11 so we have Christ crown and enthroned in our hearts The Tree of Life yes we have the Brooks and the streams of salvation flow in our soul my lord but praise God you think that's enough the Bible says we can have rivers rivers of water for the Lord Jesus yes says he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his innermost being shall flow rivers rivers of water this fake he of the Spirit for the Holy Ghost was not yet given but praise God he is given now to us and it's poured out upon all flesh all races nations and tongue are receiving the baptism with the Holy Ghost and fire according to the prophecy of Joel when we have a clear knowledge of the justification and sanctification through the precious blood of Jesus Christ in our hearts then we can be recipients of the baptism with the Holy Ghost many people today are sanctified cleanse from all sin and perfectly I say perfectly consecrated but they have never obeyed the Lord according to acts 1 4 5 and he and luke 24:39 god amen thank you my dish thank you my friend as I was saying Luke 24 and 39 for their real Pentecost what's the real Pentecost the endowment of power for service and work and for sealing unto the day of redemption hallelujah the baptism with the Holy Ghost is a free gift with that repentance upon the sanctified transversals now he which establish it I said he which establishes yes us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God who has also sealed us and given to us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts 2nd Corinthians 1:21 and 22 I praise God for the sealing of the Holy Spirit onto the day of our Redemption yes praise the Lord yes that is the word I just quoted to you everywhere from the Bible yes dearly beloved the only people that will meet our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and go with him into the marriage supper of the lamb are the wise virgins not only saved and sanctified with pure and clean hearts but having the baptism with the Holy Ghost amen the other the others we find will not be prepared they have some oil they have some oil in their lamps but they have not a double portion of its spirit before Pentecost the disciples were filled with the unction of the Holy Spirit that sustained them until they received the Holy Ghost baptism many people may I say again many people today are filled with joy and gladness but they are far far from the ndu mana power sanctification brings rest and sweetness and quietness to our soul [Music] praise the Lord with the Lord Jesus and are able to obey his precious word that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and we are feeding on Christ I appreciate your support but let us wait for the promise of the Father upon our souls according to Jesus's word John truly baptized with water but he shall receive the Holy Ghost and not many days hence ye shall receive the Holy Ghost I say he shall receive the Holy Ghost not many days Amen my brother you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me oh that sounds so good that the Heavenly Father would make us witnesses to him you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria praise the Lord and unto the uttermost parts of the earth that is acts 1 5 & 8 glory Oh blessed Savior glory hallelujah Oh worship get down on your knees and cry out ask the Heavenly Father for the Holy Ghost yes to come in and you will find him right at your heart's door and he will come in proven now amen so I would ask in the spirit of urgency yea that each one of you meet me back here this afternoon at 3:00 so

seek for tongues but for the promise of the father and pray for the baptism with the Holy Ghost and God will throw in terms according to acts 2:4 Jesus taught the disciples to tarry at Jerusalem they obeyed him and waited for the promise of the father and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly suddenly there came a sound from heaven yes as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house what they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a five and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance acts 2:1 through four wind is always typical of the spirit of life that's true and it filled all the house where they were sitting and the rivers of salvation had come and had filled the whole place and they all were immersed or baptized in the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance no I love it do not be too concerned about your speaking and touch them well let the Holy Ghost give you others yes and it will come just as freely as the air we breathe amen it is nothing worked up but it comes from the heart yes with the heart man believeth unto salvation let me repeat that with the heart yes man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so when the Holy Ghost life comes in the mouth opens to the power of the Spirit in the heart glory to God in seeking the baptism first get a clear and definite witness in your soul that you have the abiding Christ within then there will be no trouble in receiving the Pentecostal baptism through faith through faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for it is a free gift that comes without repentance yes bless His Holy Name yeah as we pray together before we go into individual prayer Almighty God thank you merciful father

broke into a vision and I've seen two men and these two men I knew them to be John and Peter as they begin to walk towards me they begin to fall under the path they begin to shake and brothers and sisters and it's same and I begin to shake and I begin to speak in an unknown time [Applause] [Music] [Music] and something gonna hold the Holy Spirit I was crying out to the Lord I began the worship to the vision Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] holy baptism [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
