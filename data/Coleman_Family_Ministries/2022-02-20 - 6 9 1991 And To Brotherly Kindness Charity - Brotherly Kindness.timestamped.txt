[1:17] amen and amen well praise god there's the chart again the last time we headed up was the open door
[1:25] amen you may be seated brother norman and to brotherly kindness charity
[1:33] and i have a subject um charity anointed seven virtues for a manifestation of the seven thunders
[1:46] amen
[1:48] understanding what thou hear us [Music] now we anointed now right
[1:56] amen [Applause] april 2 april 6th i've been very strange season been sick and weary and
[2:06] then uh remodeling my house and my wife and i have been staying over to jonathan's house
[2:11] for almost two months now just back and forth and so much stress and everything and remodeling and
[2:17] going back and forth and very tired and no time to study or whatever and didn't exactly know what
[2:23] i was going to do and but uh on april 4th the lord spoke to me and um and told me gave me the message
[2:31] then came jesus after easter and then i still didn't know what i was doing just moving by faith
[2:38] in april the sixth on saturday uh he spoke to me twice in the morning the seven thunders are the
[2:44] seven virtues of the seven church ages and then it came in my heart i said well now i know that i
[2:50] said well what uh does that does it mean something else and then he says and to brotherly kindness
[2:57] add charity for june 9th and i said well that's what he told me so i didn't know what it meant
[3:05] so uh i believe on one of the messages to know him from the beginning i just said those words i say
[3:12] i'm saying for purpose i was still looking for the inspiration myself amen sitting on june 9th 1974
[3:23] uh brotherly kindness was birthed into us or from the message and of some have compassion
[3:31] and from june 9 1974 to june 9th today 1991 to 17 years and on june 1st just a week or so ago um
[3:44] i was wondering um what was i supposed to do oh i know what i left something out on may
[3:51] was it may 11th i just still didn't know what i was well supposed to preach and saturday morning
[3:59] he told me temperance and he showed me i had some notes there and immediately i knew i had to preach
[4:06] patience and godliness but i couldn't figure out where was i supposed to preach godliness at
[4:12] because he had already told me from the 28th of april to june 16th that brother of blade
[4:18] and i was supposed to share eight sundays to set the captive free be a jubilee for 50 days
[4:27] so i'm hoping that some are going free that's what he told me amen that people would go free
[4:34] and so then he did that then he later he tells me on june 1st uh um you know he told me that uh uh
[4:45] that i had to speak on temperance and patience i couldn't figure out where godliness then he
[4:50] told me on wednesday june 5th so then on june 1st i was just meditating like and
[5:00] the holy spirit spoke to me and told me to add another message i said add another message
[5:09] and then uh i said well i didn't think i had to go any further than faith on easter and then came
[5:14] jesus virtue and then april 28 knowledge to know him from the beginning so i thought i was finished
[5:20] preaching on the virtues with faith virtue and knowledge and then on may 11th and that's what
[5:25] he told me preaching on temperance come and dying so instantly i knew i had to preach on patience
[5:31] and godliness and june 9th he'd already told me on april the 6th to believe kindness their charity so
[5:39] june 1st he spoke again and said add another message i said add another message now
[5:47] i can hardly preach on wednesday and then he spoke back and says from the scripture into godliness
[5:53] brotherly kindness he says separated you always preach the to brotherly kindness at charity two
[6:01] or three times maybe and he says but that's to be separate so preach on broadly kindness friday
[6:10] and i did amen how i got in here i don't know but uh i made it then i had to
[6:17] to today get inspiration for the day which he'd already told me and he said
[6:22] just change a little bit into belly kindness charity just the way it says in the scripture
[6:29] so that's what i'm doing this morning amen soul and to brother uh into godliness brother kindness
[6:38] and to bloody kindness charity so he says separated and make these two messages thus
[6:45] making me preach eight virtues amen and then going from april to seven virtue to charity today so
[6:54] here we are so i had to preach wednesday and friday night to finish my course on june
[7:00] 7th amen i was finished brotherly kindness well praise god it's been a tremendous 17 years
[7:10] trying to take these promises praise god and so dave today is june 9th and i'm just supposed to
[7:18] preach on charity and you don't have to get all stiff and wonder what's going to happen because
[7:23] it never comes that way so you might as well enter in like you did wednesday and friday don't sit and
[7:29] try to squeeze and wonder what's going to happen how is it going to happen and when is it going to
[7:34] happen and will it happen to me and how will i get it and on and on and on and on and on just a time
[7:42] and enter into the anointing say thank you lord praise god but don't go there stay away from here
[7:51] because i don't even know myself so amen so amen i do not know i've been going by inspiration
[8:03] amen so i preached the seventh virtue june 7. you may be seated and to godliness really kindness in
[8:11] the 17 years on june 7 preaching on the seven thousands of the seven voices seven church ages
[8:16] seven virtues brotherly kindness adoption perfection promises etc etc etc
[8:22] all promises that uh were supposed to keep you alive
[8:27] amen 25 years of soul praise god and then mainly the last 17 years and then the april inspiration
[8:35] speaking two times the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church
[8:39] he did not explain this statement to me and i still don't quite know what he mean because i
[8:43] know what it means but what does he mean for it now i don't know hey i hope he'll show me today
[8:51] praise god amen so maybe i will find out today why that was spoken to me praise god

[14:20] praise god number seven good temper love and disposition amen never irritated never resentful
[14:31] verse 5 number 8 righteousness love and conduct or hate sin never glad when others go wrong
[14:41] always gladdened by goodness to others always slow to expose charity hides a multitude of sin
[14:52] hallelujah amen don't seek out the faults of his brothers and sisters it covers it
[15:03] [Applause]
[15:04] hallelujah amen always eager to believe the best always hopeful always enduring

[15:32] amen never self assertive amen no does not blaze out
[15:39] in passionate anger amen nor brood over wrongs why did he or she do that to me i don't understand it
[15:49] you can't come to church no more praise god always just joyful and truthful knows how to be silent
[16:02] full of trust always present
[16:05] always present sure it could be stand that way and you walk up it turns around is present
[16:12] regardless of what happens right there instant
[16:17] spontaneous now one thing it cannot do charity never faileth
[16:25] it can never fail we can have everything uh uh uh listed in the first three verses here
[16:33] of corinthians have everything in there praise god and though we speak with tongue and men and
[16:38] angels have not charity praise god i am becoming a sounding branch of tinkling symbol though i have
[16:43] the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries though you understand the mystery of the rapture
[16:50] and you don't have charity it don't mean a thing to you though you understand all
[16:55] thunders and all these things it means nothing to you unless you have charity praise god amen
[17:04] amen do you have all faith seventh under faith rapture in faith and have not charity i am nothing
[17:11] oh praise god and though i before my gospel feed the poor
[17:15] and do i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing
[17:20] well what we're going to do we're going to now therefore give me this mountain we're going to die
[17:27] out we're going to be born again we're going to add to our faith hallelujah we got no more time to
[17:33] hang around here we know what this message is now we have knowledge to understand it now praise god
[17:41] oh my would you like to have charity how many like to have charity in here
[17:46] praise god amen well you can it's your promise for this age is already vindicated by malachi 4
[17:55] the rapture's already vindicated the new city is vindicated it's not maybe will it be what is it
[18:01] the future home of the brand is already vindicated it's in your heart already it's on the tape spoken
[18:06] word books is already vindicated this promise of charity is vindicated already may be seated
[18:15] now remember the seven virtues must absolutely be birthed in you before charity will ever seal
[18:22] them up in you for service and you can you can't even get virtue without first being born again
[18:29] so we have seven human virtues we ain't talking about those now see and number two these seven
[18:36] virtues must be a scripturally proven to be in you they must be tested you know your temperaments
[18:44] must be tested your patience and so forth must be tested amen and your knowledge must be tested
[18:50] to understand who's in the message and what is the message hallelujah praise god amen see
[18:58] and you know one thing you know that god cannot fail god cannot lie god heals god seals knowledge
[19:06] amen now there must be birth in you before the holy spirit as charity can come upon you and
[19:13] seal you up see you add these seven virtues until the complete statue of christ is made manifest
[19:20] then the holy spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body praise god amen well hallelujah on the
[19:31] guide page 16 uh brother man say what about the holy ghost in the church he was speaking about the
[19:37] instinct of the ducks to go south and when the time uh uh when the cold comes they go south of
[19:42] louisiana and texas for the rights and so forth he said what about the holy ghost in the church
[19:47] the instinct you know and all the leaders from old formalities and creeds and things into a
[19:53] glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost where there is virtue knowledge patience and
[20:00] godliness in the holy spirit now what he's telling you the holy spirit himself descended from heaven
[20:05] with a shout out and he came in the form of mechanics and dynamics as promises together
[20:12] and then that was the guy and the prophet released that then that should have led us from 1966
[20:23] to virtue into knowledge and to temperance and to patience that
[20:26] god is in brotherly kindness and maybe today the holy ghost
[20:35] all 25 years and maybe today the charity will pour out
[20:44] because the uh the holy ghost is inside of the holy ghost
[20:52] he understands so his patience and all the rest of his inside old church that's what
[20:56] we need today that's what i am dedicated to on this third phase starting from june 9th today
[21:02] praise god amen so therefore the minister's commission and all of us is my commission anyway
[21:11] and the rest of them are supposed to be statue of a perfect man page and he quoting back to
[21:17] the second peter 1 whereby given to us exceeding and great precious promises do you now understand
[21:22] the promises they were given by malachi 4 and he left what did he leave here the promises
[21:34] and many sit here and they said they don't understand the promise
[21:40] god gives a promise noah is going to rain i promise you rain now suppose noah got all
[21:50] nervous and excited in 10 years where's the rain 20 years got mad 50 years evil 75 years
[22:02] stop preaching it walked away but noah staggered not praise god he said it will ring
[22:15] amen there will be a statue of a perfect man amen there will be a glorious baptism of the holy ghost
[22:22] where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance i don't care how long i have to preach it
[22:27] it will happen praise god how long will you preach it until the last one is sealed
[22:35] with charity that's when i'll stop until then that's my commission may be seated
[22:44] now we have escaped what are you doing in here you escape the world
[22:52] that's what you're doing in here you escape the world
[22:56] by these great these exceeding great and precious promises that you might be partakers you just
[23:02] didn't escape the world coming here forever for what to be partakers of his divine nature
[23:08] for a purpose god has called you to virtue in glory hallelujah to partake of his nature
[23:18] through the promises
[23:21] he may be seated haven't escaped the corruption the prophet listen to that that is in the world
[23:28] through lust the corruption comes through the people lusting in the world over desires for
[23:35] money and women and sex and all kinds of things that's what's in the world corruption but we
[23:41] escaped that [Music] that's enough to sit down for 10 years and say hallelujah praise the lord
[23:50] thank you jesus for escaping the corruption not sitting around all sad hallelujah it will rain
[24:02] yes sir you may be seated lust for money lust for big things lust for popularity see these are over
[24:09] desires uh these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tent or college why should i care
[24:17] live or die sink or drown this is the thing that i'm interested in the kingdom of god

[26:21] apostles prophets teaches pastors evangelists all for the perfecting now the sixth message

[26:35] the coming of the son of god oh praise god god be praised my that perfection of the coming of
[26:44] the son of god amen and the lord come with a shout and a voice in the trunk that perfection yes siree
[26:54] let it pour out lord oh hallelujah the guide says that charity is a wonderful glorious baptism the
[27:00] holy ghost where there is faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience
[27:04] and godliness and bully kindness and the holy spirit so that means that if that wonderful
[27:09] glorious baptism of chatting with poor today immediately those seeds would receive faith
[27:17] amen and those that already have a birth would be refilled
[27:23] and then they would pick it up they begin to hurt you in knowledge and tempers and patience
[27:29] hallelujah they're coming on now praise god to shake in the earth hallelujah glory to god amen
[27:38] may be seated and the holy spirit see the holy spirit itself back in the church
[27:45] now we know that the holy spirit is christ the anointing amen like sister a pharaoh saying for us
[27:52] this morning the anointing amen now let's go to my subject amen let's get to my subject here
[27:58] charity anointed seven virtues for a manifestation of the seven thunders wouldn't that be wonderful
[28:06] three questions i want to ask amen i want to answer number one what is the anointing number two
[28:12] how do we receive the anointing and number three after we receive the anointing what do we become
[28:23] amen
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:34] i'll pause let you think on that now sila means pause and think on this
[28:44] all right now
[28:47] questions uh cod book but i have the the old one book two questions and answers the old
[28:53] green series but you pick up your cod book i think it's the same page anyway well before we do it now
[28:58] let's nail down the firefox ministry because a lot of people say that there is no fire for ministry
[29:04] in the message let's nail down the bride the church and charity as that which is perfect
[29:09] has come okay and brother brahma answered the questions i don't know what is the question what's
[29:14] the confusion amen on page 87 i've done this before but i think today maybe it'll strike home
[29:21] amen now there's many questions here well will the pride will this the church see you can't
[29:27] divine what they are the bride is the elected of god the church goes through that's the ones
[29:35] it says whosoever will let him come but the bride is elected of god so now you want to get
[29:42] off get in before the spirit comes upon the bride and the spirit and the bride say come
[29:51] you want to get in before that because whosoever will let him come and that's a church
[29:57] that goes through a tribulation period so we ain't just coming here for nothing
[30:06] we're trying to get in and be positionally placed
[30:09] but you can see what's happening there over in europe the uh brother and tony was telling me his
[30:13] father told him that july i believe that they're getting together on the money and the whole thing
[30:17] uniting and letting russia come into it in europe over there so brother thinks the clock is ticking
[30:23] amen praise god now see that's the one that says whosoever will let him come but the bride is the
[30:29] elected of god selected for the bride to be in here predestinated they're happy to be here they
[30:35] know they're going to be sealed they're not funny and walking around all strange
[30:40] not the bride no they're elected predestinated of god they're always the same yes so they're in
[30:47] and out up and down they they're there once that light strikes that seed they're not going nowhere
[30:57] praise god amen husband and wife sit together stand together praise god and they stay together
[31:05] amen praise god now no are there's five there is these are right in a row here
[31:11] there is five offices elected of god for god has said in the church apostles prophets teachings
[31:17] past and evangelism god did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else but you see
[31:23] but god said in the church for the perfecting of the church can't divide it a lot of people
[31:28] that message get mixed up with a elder app to teach and a real five four minutes to pastor
[31:33] they don't know the difference and that's where all the problems come in and see well
[31:38] that man is a past and the fire for ministry that's christ in there the ministry of christ
[31:45] not just somebody in the message running around because there's so much knowledge to spout out
[31:50] anybody could preach in this message here amen but anointing where's anointing
[31:58] hallelujah breaks the yolk
[32:02] upon the people [Applause] it doesn't bind them it breaks it hallelujah
[32:11] sets them free because it's christ in them setting the people free by the word
[32:18] hallelujah may be seated glory to god can't define it so if we understand it now there is a fight for
[32:25] ministry well then i can i start my my commission pouring into virtues do you see me as a pastor
[32:35] after all 17 years laboring do you believe it's the truth then stay with it praise god amen
[32:44] okay now the holy spirit i'm speaking about today now the holy spirit when it comes
[32:49] it it it is a witness unto you that this word is right now you had this word for 25
[32:56] years and we're looking for this holy spirit this anointing to come down here today to witness
[33:03] to you that this word is right
[33:07] and god confirms his word with signs and wonders and miracles and gifts of the holy
[33:13] ghost hallelujah the holy ghost will testify and you will testify hallelujah praise god
[33:25] amen now you got it the prophet brought the word
[33:29] with the promise of the holy spirit to follow the word and where you preach that word by revelation
[33:36] the holy spirit follows that word zing zing zing wherever it goes at somebody block it
[33:42] off it goes right over top of you praise god it goes right behind you in the seat behind you
[33:49] goes right through you praise god you have no receptacle to hold it amen yay
[33:58] amen you may be seated now the holy spirit when it comes it is a witness unto you see that this
[34:05] word is right the word for today not the word for luther the word not for moses we witness
[34:12] it's the truth see it's another day that's why we are preaching this here i'm looking
[34:16] for the holy spirit to confirm it hallelujah now first corinthians 13 says this when that which is
[34:25] perfect is come and i read the scripture that which which is in part shall be done away with
[34:31] so all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid and turn to talking tongues and
[34:36] all these other things when that which is perfect i hear what he says
[34:40] and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication
[34:50] that's charity that's the word but it comes in dynamics and mechanics
[34:55] and the dynamics is supposed to confirm to you that the mechanics is right
[35:01] then it's charity that's christ hallelujah praise god
[35:08] then that which is in part is done away with all these little interpretations
[35:12] besides this pentecostal stuff all these interpretations is done away with
[35:18] in the message listen i think this i think get done away pray finish praise god amen yes siree
[35:29] praise god amen when i was a child i speak of the child i understood as a child but when i become
[35:35] a man i put away childish things amen i go to preaching and then don't get through these things
[35:40] yes sir okay now now what question number one praise god uh what is the anointing
[35:46] what is it amen okay um but you see the church where am i at here uh okay here we are
[35:54] um what is the anointing page 101 amen 101 in the book here okay now
[36:03] and now what was that other question i get so wound up in these i forget the things
[36:08] uh what the things were one of them was was i they asked brother brown was he the son of man
[36:15] here it is i believe the son of man said they can't understand that god could be veiled in
[36:19] that prophet they don't get it you know and not jesus skin but the skin from genesis 18.
[36:26] human skin see they don't get it you see that so they say he is the son of man or the son of man
[36:32] was revealed in him that's what the scripture said so man would be revealed well the holy spirit
[36:39] the word he's gonna have a body to come into can't come into that piano over there praise god
[36:46] amen so it came in malachi for his body amen okay uh forget what the uh here it is i believe the
[36:54] son of man or was the pillow fire the son of man no now watch the pill of fire is the anointing
[37:03] you got it now and christ is anointed amen now now that pill of fire is the logos
[37:12] that went out of god the logos which is actually the attribute or the fullness of god
[37:19] you see this is now we're preaching it people are going and coming
[37:23] see but what they're doing they don't know see they're rejecting the fullness of the atonement
[37:31] now many in the message will take the atonement in part and you wonder why don't they do this they
[37:36] want to do that well they're only taking it apart but a bride is going to take it in his fullness
[37:46] so it's a big difference amen see so yeah
[37:52] and see the attribute other way you're taking all of the logos amen
[37:58] the answer to the fullness of god when god be coming to a form to where it could be seen
[38:06] it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth amen coming down like seven rainbows
[38:14] condescending yes sir coming down god the father the locals that was up over israel
[38:21] he was holy could not bear sin there had to be a blood over right in eden then that locals become
[38:28] flesh and dwelt among us and where the locals dwelt in the human body which was the sacrifice
[38:35] amen oh praise god yes sir the pillar fires the longest did you pick that up now now jesus said i
[38:47] come from god and i go to god is that right after his death burial and resurrection and ascension
[38:53] when the body was taken up to sit at the right hand of god now i don't mean god's got a right
[38:58] hand god's a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of god that in
[39:05] that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in the earth is named
[39:13] after it and subject to it a name above all names jesus christ
[39:20] amen now this logos this logos that was in him which was the spirit of god the anointing yes sir
[39:32] through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons of god which is anointed with the same
[39:39] logos you anointed if you have the holy spirit with that same logos apart that locals come into
[39:47] your being his being come in you praise god you change you can never be the same anymore
[39:55] oh hallelujah praise god yes siree now on the day of pentecost they come down that pill of fire
[40:05] and broke apart like that and tongues of fire set up on each other not their
[40:09] tongues but tongues of fire set upon them elected selected group identified by this pill of fire
[40:17] showing that god has separated himself into man do you get it
[40:21] god the logos separating himself into man god not in one person he's in the church universal
[40:29] amen that's the reason jesus said the works that i do shall you do more also more now i know the
[40:36] king james version says greater but the right translation there is more than this shall you do
[40:43] got more bride to do it with god was bottled and confined in one man
[40:49] jesus christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living god
[40:57] i got god in this bottle praise god you got god in your bottles

[46:11] down his spirit in the upper room and it's been down through all the apostolic age in the seven
[46:16] church ages and come right back in his fullness released by malachi and four because he brought
[46:20] back the full word and now we can have the full holy ghost oh hallelujah i know what i'm talking

[46:47] this charity that's to be loose is loose for what to bring back a ministry
[46:56] his ministry oh hallelujah bring back emergency just exactly like he said it would be
[47:03] in order for the head lovee and the rest of the body to connect together
[47:10] you got it now he ties into the pyramid just like the pyramid as enoch built and we find that in the
[47:17] pyramid they never did get the headstone on and why the headstone yet to come the headstones yet
[47:23] to come the seven steps in the pyramid now watch we'll go through that someday and i'd just like
[47:30] to show you how it really is perfectly with the scripture all these guys that come against the
[47:36] thunders and virtues of the world he said he'd go through it one day the holy ghost would and
[47:41] he'd show you this perfectly with the scriptures but it's a revelation until he goes through it
[47:48] not to everybody amen praise god so they don't understand it
[47:53] amen so now that now that great diamond see lovee could not settle down there in luther because
[48:00] it was luther was too wide and then as they come in the west bay is still too wide and
[48:04] brotherly kindness was still too are you looking at it so then he had to
[48:08] drop a ministry called the holy spirit and love will only fit into the holy spirit [Applause]
[48:18] it won't fit into the kind of only in the holy spirit but the kindness with
[48:22] all the virtues in it must pick up the holy spirit it must catch the capstone
[48:31] on the seventh step now it's death to go in there but mordecai like i said the other night told you
[48:38] how to dress esther if i perish i'll perish but my people haman the world council is after them
[48:48] so what am i going to do and mordecai told me what to wear and how to dress and it was the law of the
[48:55] king then at that time in persia that you could not come in to see him unless he sent for you
[49:03] even though you were one of his wives so esther knew she didn't have any command to come in there
[49:08] maybe seated so therefore she said and mordecai told her well you have to do it or they're going
[49:15] heyman's going to kill these jews here all your people so she put on all that a mordecai totally
[49:21] put on and then she walked and she was beautiful the king was he was gone he looked and he says
[49:29] what do you want esther under half of my kingdom and he put the scepter forward
[49:38] hallelujah can you imagine that charity drops down here maybe in 1991 and a lot
[49:44] of these people in this message try to approach charity the king without these uh virtues here
[49:53] with some little interpretation and mean and mad and putting people out of the message and how they
[50:00] gonna approach charity when i just went through the things that he is not puffed up and beareth
[50:05] all things hope with all things praise god and all these guys gonna approach charity huh with their
[50:14] strange revelations saying the virtues is not there it was a way back there somewhere because
[50:19] they don't have a life that's why they can't preach it they don't have it how can you preach
[50:24] what you are you can't be what you hate praise god you can't produce it they cannot produce it
[50:32] they don't understand that you you are it is a battle it's a revelation you fall down a thousand
[50:38] times but you get up i'm going to have it i'm going to have it praise god amen so come on esther
[50:48] put on your seven virtues and come in and see the king hallelujah he'll give you the scepter thus
[50:55] saith the lord oh hallelujah praise god you may be seated yes siree now that's now i understand
[51:04] that stone not going to fit down there will not fit down there on the bottom foundation neither
[51:08] will it fit on the second on the third it'll only fit on the top foundation you know that's just
[51:13] a perfection right amen on the top uh when the entire building has become fitted to the stone
[51:22] and it drops that holy spirit in there to do the fitting oh praise god has become fitted to the
[51:30] stone and jesus cannot come until the church a body of believers and the ministry that he once
[51:38] left there it is holy spirit ministry on early apostles and on malachi 4. you got it now amen the
[51:47] mercy they once left will have to be the same then as it was then and then that brings then there's a
[51:55] resurrection then without us is not made perfect paul said hebrews 11 without us they cannot be
[52:02] perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the lutheran wesleyan and all of them down through
[52:09] their ages when that come when that part where the eagles gather just as the carcasses the ego will
[52:15] be gathered the question was oh it's just perfect i hope that answers the question well praise god
[52:23] we understand it you know what anointing is now the pill of fire
[52:27] oh the holy spirit praise god amen now we know that this the holy spirit is coming in for purpose
[52:35] is bringing back a ministry of charity and the purpose is to raise up the dead
[52:42] to be perfected so we can connect with love love and air
[52:49] oh hallelujah can't you live for that amen connect together in times anointing pillow fire into
[52:57] the pyramid amen just like the pyramid amen so therefore that capstone will only fit on the top
[53:05] amen jesus cannot come back until and he is loved on your chart the mercy of jesus christ will have
[53:11] to be here in order to raise the dead in the resurrection then comes jesus as love corporal

[57:53] eat it down but he pruned it it got denominational branches he pruned them off uh they raised up
[58:00] another branch another church the nomination of branches he pruned it off but the heart of that
[58:05] tree kept growing now watch in the evening time it shall be light that's when christ
[58:12] the holy spirit you see it there jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church
[58:19] and then he will resurrect the church being his own body so he come down as a shout
[58:24] to the prophet with the message and that message the word was to be the head of the church
[58:34] and if you find a pastor or man of god who will preach the handship
[58:40] a lot of people won't like it a lot of women won't like it i'll tell you that
[58:44] amen they'll get mad say you're mean and hard but that is the headship christ descended from heaven
[58:51] with a shout hallelujah through the prophet and he is still in command today praise god
[59:01] many walked away but christ the headship as the word
[59:05] revealed word is right here hallelujah he shall not be moved i shall not i shall not be moved
[59:15] hallelujah praise god let them all walk away praise god but i shall not be moved
[59:23] so they don't know that christ is here the headship they don't know who the word is they
[59:28] go by emotions and so forth you may be seated but the head is here all the time as the word
[59:37] so obey the word and the things that's preached
[59:41] amen he's only testing you investigating judgment to see if you really want to go out of here
[59:50] see amen that's when christ the holy spirit jesus comes down
[59:55] and sets himself at the head of the church malachi 4's message is the head of the church
[1:00:03] that's why you're here that's what all these books and things is about it's the head
[1:00:10] and the minister supposed to keep that messiahship straight
[1:00:15] yes sir oh my my then he will resurrect the church being his own body see how he does it himself
[1:00:25] all we got to do is surrender oh praise god amen and there's a body church being his own body and
[1:00:32] there's a body in a way god is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he brought his church
[1:00:39] into girls see through seven ages every church age it becomes one big church you see it now
[1:00:46] so therefore in the evening time it shall be light that's when jesus comes christ the holy spirit
[1:00:53] jesus the anointing comes down and sets himself at the head of the church uh what is he the anointing
[1:01:00] christ holy spirit the anointing amen now we'll say how do we receive this anointing i just gave
[1:01:08] you a party now here's the rest of it see these fellows will not require what these fellows here
[1:01:13] that wasn't required like lutheran wesleyan and pentecostals of them see uh he brought his church
[1:01:18] up the same way he's bringing his people up church then individuals today see uh then peter here says
[1:01:26] first now i'm reading from here what peter said seven things faith virtue see coming up knowledge
[1:01:33] temperance patience god bless love and brother kindness and then the love of god the holy ghost
[1:01:40] christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost

[1:02:57] amen so if you got the holy ghost he's supposed to put this in you amen but you're looking
[1:03:01] for some virtue so you heard it before the holy spirit will disguise himself as virtue
[1:03:10] see the holy spirit the anointing the pill of fire amen charity i'm preaching for today
[1:03:18] will slip down in here as virtue the guy
[1:03:23] and give you power in your burn and then birth those who are ordained and then
[1:03:29] they begin to add then virtue and knowledge and temperance under charity the anointing
[1:03:41] my god amen can we say amen we're getting this here okay
[1:03:47] now don't let it blow your mind out like you you missed something
[1:03:51] because we're just starting i'm trying to preach trying to pour these things in there amen
[1:03:59] amen all seven this is how you receive the anointing i'm asking a question amen then the love
[1:04:07] of god the holy ghost christ and the person of the holy spirit in other words the spirit is a certain
[1:04:14] way and he acts a certain way and then that's the word that's already in you then he comes upon that
[1:04:23] and he anoints the word that's already in you and not only will you hear the message you will see
[1:04:32] the manifestation of the message from your inward parts
[1:04:38] god will become tangible like he was in malachi 4. hallelujah oh church praise god
[1:04:49] oh hallelujah praise god understanding what thou here is you may be seated let me hurry
[1:04:56] along praise god christ the person of the holy spirit comes upon you in the true baptism of the
[1:05:02] holy ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then god then god lives in a tabernacle
[1:05:10] called the building the living tabernacle the living god's dwelling place hallelujah oh my
[1:05:19] then god the anointing and you are one god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living
[1:05:25] tabernacle live in god's dwelling place when a man possesses these things these kind of things
[1:05:32] the holy ghost anointing comes upon him amen okay now when a man possesses these kind of things
[1:05:40] then the holy ghost comes upon him did you get that when you possess faith and virtue
[1:05:45] and knowledge and is moving and living in you and you're waiting for charity
[1:05:52] and it's such a subject and then one day you see and the holy spirit reports back to the father
[1:05:57] says he and she's ready put him aside i want to visit him with an angel
[1:06:05] and then the same holy ghost that sent christ out
[1:06:09] this is my beloved son who i'm well pleased into the wilderness he went
[1:06:14] then later two two years later up on the mountain
[1:06:19] same holy ghost this is my beloved son who i'm well pleased here he him is added
[1:06:30] amen so we're down at the river now we're waiting for the holy ghost to come upon the dove to come
[1:06:34] down now charity the dove and take us into our trials of temptation three wild attacks by satan
[1:06:43] to prove that we have these seven things in us
[1:06:48] hallelujah praise god where you been where you going
[1:06:52] discouraged your satisfied or what you getting ready for three wild attacks
[1:07:01] lust of the eye praise god lust of the spirit pride of life that's why i've been preaching
[1:07:06] on these little things here trying to get you ready can you imagine the tv on one side and
[1:07:13] and cherry on the other side the anointing how do you put it both on the same scale amen praise
[1:07:20] god no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that god's got you
[1:07:26] might have all faith to move all mountains praise god you might do that but until these virtues
[1:07:33] here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues grow
[1:07:40] in and you add it to that to that to that then you live in a monument you are living moving idle
[1:07:48] you don't have to ask for confirmation you already have the thing inside
[1:07:54] confirming it praise god hallelujah glory to god cherry never failed it without this here
