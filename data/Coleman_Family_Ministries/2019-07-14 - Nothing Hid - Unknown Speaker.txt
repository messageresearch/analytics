TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now I want to turn to Acts the eighteenth chapter our first service brother Peregrine he was telling me feel a little bit odd in a new place and sure do saw they've gotten used to 3054 hd491 through 11:00 after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth and found a certain Jew named aquila born in Pontus lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome and came unto them and because he was of the same craft he abhorred with them and wrought for their occupation for by they after patient they were tentmakers any reason a synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks and when Silas and timotheus were come from Macedonia Paul was pressed in his spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ and when their poles themselves and blaspheme he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own hits I am clean from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles and he departed thence and entered into a certain man's house named justice one that worshipped God whose house joined hard to the synagogue in Christmas the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized then spake the Lord to Paul in the night of a vision be not afraid but speak and whole not by peace why I'm with thee and no man shall set on D to hurt thee for how much people in this city in revelation 22 13th verse 12th verse rather and be more come quickly and my reward is with me to give to every man according to his work as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the first end the Lance blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie i Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may a lot of blessing to the reading of his word just about 5 minutes exhortation on scripture here on behalf of the dedication service here Paul here we're reading here in Ex the 18th chapter here have been preaching up here and the Holy Spirit he had had made him come out real strong to tell the Jews that Jesus was to Christ and that time it seemed like it was time for a change it was God's purpose for Paul to change at this time and this also was the the founding of the Corinth Church here in the book of Acts the 18th chapter and it says here and I think is the ninth verse then spake the Lord to Paul and night by a vision be not afraid but speak in whole nut dry peace and I'd like to bring it over to here to our day here in New York City here we have a vision also of the Indies a seven sealed prophetic vision brother Branson entire message and Paul here God gave him favor with his man just as here and they set up a house of worship and it was a temporary house of worship for it lasted here about a year and six months but God had a purpose in that city he had souls there and so God's will what the setup a house of worship there temporarily because there would be and as we know from the Word of God Solomon's Temple was also temporary all churches all places worship of God are temporary because the real temple of God is described over in Revelation 21 coming down from God out of heaven and that is the New Jerusalem that's why we all sitting here hoping that believing that we will one day be in that place and when that is set up on the earth all temporary places of worship will fade away and brother we are really looking for that day and so we filled all that we would like to act in this temporary house of worship the same way that we would act in New Jerusalem if that could be so while we're waiting to be in that New Jerusalem well that is why we are here we have come out of the world we have confessed that we are not ashamed with the gospel of Jesus Christ where there's a power of God unto salvation and just to give you a little quick history of this church in January to 6 1963 in my hole up in the Bronx New York there this church was born on January 2 6 being down in Indiana to services in Jeffersonville and while the prophet of God was speaking a message serves this is the time the Lord spoke to my heart doing that service doing that time that day say going back to New York and start the church and that being January 6 1963 and their brother honey and myself it was God's will that we would start this church at that time for the Lord had already given us about 40 or 50 people from about August 62 we were just having Saturday night prayer services and the people they were flocking and so that was the start of this church and in June 7 1964 we felt led to leave the Bronx by God for God had expanded our borders and we went down to 41 West 35th Street we would call a stable so to speak and there we I knew we didn't know at the time but we know now what what God's purpose was at that time and as the message began to be revealed to our hearts we realized that we were ripening and maturing we realized that God was doing a unique work in New York City in that he was taking different ethnic groups and nationalities and different colors and putting them together in a staple so to speak where there were no stained glass windows no saw a nice pews and nice things to look at and just a little old room there and a rickety old stairway and the ceiling coming down and ceiling leaking and whatnot and there he would put the Word of God it was his purpose that they wouldn't could have anything anything beautiful to look at for Jesus was divins no beauty in him to be desired of the natural carnal man natural : man looked on Jesus and on that cross all beaten and spat upon and bruised they saw no beauty in him to be desired and the Word of God made fresh is the same way here in the end time it seems like church people people out in the street they don't see nothing to the Word of God at all but to that believer that has slipped beyond the veil where the glorious never failed it is beautiful beautiful wonderful words of life and their God perps in our heart to preach the Word of God realizing that he had he was going to have a bouquet of flowers and he was going to a tear down men's natural ideas what they think and he was going to bring forth his will and he picked up brother hunt and myself saw the crude I'd say but willing and to let God speak through us by His grace and there we purpose in our heart to say what the word said that's all just say what the word said and those of you who are sitting here now we know you took a a brutal beating thanks be to God here every one of your sitting here this morning and so therefore on many things happen here we have many beautiful memories of what happened on 41 West 35th Street the gospel was preached from the side of the message itself was preached of the end time and also speaking of the second coming of the Lord and and the great revelations of the message and there and God confirmed the word signs followed it even the Dead was raised Devils were cast out and the sick was healed at forty one West 35th Street and in spite of all the opposition and and men's ideas about it as to what they thought by the grace of God we we are here this morning which we give thanks to him and we praise him for it so now as Paul said here as the Lord spoke back the pole here it was at this season now and this year I believe is the seventh year since the Lord seen fit to take brother branham off the scene for many not understanding the message that he had of the end time and I believe it was a man down here in Florida he puts out a little radio news I think his name is a Brubaker something like that well he puts out a radio news flash and he cold with a radio I think was family radio he made a statement that he never understood brother Branham but everything he has said has come to pass and it's really amazing because he sat there in the March 1963 meetings and never understood it but today this past week he went on a radio and said the things that the prophets spoke about in the end time everyone that he has said has come to pass and so we can say amen to that for that is the own reason why we are existing here in sitting here in Forest Hills is because of that message and that message alone we're not here because we feel that we are ministers of God and God has called us and we know the Bible no we are here solely with a one purpose that God would so anoint lips to tell every man woman and child that this is the end of the world and there's no hope for you except God has made a way out for you that is true the message the Ark of God that he has dropped down on the earth in a form of a message a prophetic message and he is calling for all of us to enter into it to be to be safe from the plagues that are falling all around us so I would say then that as the Lord told Paul here no man can hurt thee for I have much people in this city and God has seen fit to bring us here to Queens and our third move which is now and so we feel that no man can hurt us it is God's purpose set there are souls out here in Queens and Brooklyn around here we have proclaim the message in the Bronx Manhattan and narrow Queens this is the third move for us here and we feel that this is the end this is the last one we don't feel it is much time left and so we want to be honest and and earnest and everything that we're doing we want to state our purpose here that we intend to preach the gospel the Word of God from this pulpit here and it would be dedicated and consecrated to the preaching of the word the spirit of bride say come come to the real message of God that God has dropped down st. Matthew 10 the 10th chapter says do not fear man I want to read it to you I'm headed down here for the thought st. Matthew 10th chapter the 26 verse fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known when I tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what you hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops he's saying here do not fear man so as to hide unwanted truth other words truth that comes forth in maybe uh you feel it maybe that they won't understand because man the man will understand and you don't want to hurt his feelings but the Lord Jesus is saying here don't fear man what I have told you of this secret revelation from God speak it in the light in evening light say it if you have to go up on the rooftops and those days they had flat roofs where they used to speak from and therefore speak it from the rooftops well God we don't have to go up on a rooftop God has given us this beautiful sanctuary here to preach the Word of God for from and we're not here to defend the word see we're here to preach the truth we don't have to defend the Word of God see because if you think a caged lion needs you to defend him if an enemy comes against him in that cage all you have to do is to open up that cage and let that roaring lion out he needs nobody to defend him so I don't think your brother and myself have to defend the Lord Jesus Christ well he's a roaring lion all we have to do is loose him and let him out and he will take you himself in his word so we only here to bind and to loose we're here to lift the Lion of Judah out for our believe it was Amos said back in Amos the second chapter I believe it is I want to a call it right Amos 2nd chapter 7 verse surely Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets the law the lion have roared who will not fear the Lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy who can but prophesy when his eyes their eyes are anointed to see the things happen in the end time and to see an answer for the things that are happening in the end time and the love that God has set forth abroad in our hearts as Peter said for we cannot but Speak the things that we have seen and heard and neither can we hear and so we are perps in our heart today that in dedication and waiting for this Tabernacle to appear on earth that we will speak the things from our heart that we have seen and heard and now I want you to turn your Bibles to Saint Matthew to fifth chapter everybody comfortable where's God I'm going to read from the fifth chapter of st. Matthew the 14th verse through the 16th verse in st. mark 422 and Song of Solomon the sixth chapter the tenth verse while you're finding the places I'm starting at st. Matthew the fourth the fifth chapter the 14th verse ye are the light of the world a city that is set on it on it and he'll cannot be here neither do men light a candle and put it on the bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven st. mark 4 22 well there was nothing here which shall not be manifested neither was anything kept secret but that it should come abroad Song of Solomon is sixth chapter 10th verse who is she that look at forth as the morning fairy azzam clear as the Sun and terrible as an army with banners may the Lord our blessing to the reading of his word I like a tireless little thought nothing hid the world of today would be much better off with all the anguish and sickness and pain perplexity meaning no way out for the things men's hearts failing them for fear of the things coming upon the earth and it seemed like they are not stopping there getting worse and worse and yep the world goes right on in its unbelief thinking that it has the answer through education it has an answer through science and that they can bring about peace through the political machinery set up man-made machinery and yet there is no peace for the Bible says when they shall say peace Paul sent cometh sudden destruction so there can never be any peace for the Prince of Peace has declared that these latter days are the days of terrible trouble days of tribulation and persecution therefore they can be no peace he is the one as to come back and set up his peace here on the earth well he made a way out of the perplexity and and and the anxiety he made a way out that we might receive Jesus Christ and and have the peace of God and many think this is something that world is just some some holy and sanctified preacher talking about and so forth no it is real for I said here that as Jesus said here that this scripture here or the world of day would be much better off if only men of all faiths would recognize a basic truth which Jesus spoke and he said here in st. mark 4 22 for there is nothing here which shall not be manifested neither was anything kept secret but that it should come abroad where are far reaching a powerful effect this indisputable statement or would have on mankind if they could universally accepted well we know that they cannot accept the Word of God only all that the father has given me will come it is only those who are predestinated to receive the Word of God into their heart with meekness that are going to receive this here the evildoers would tremble in their ways once they were convinced that they could not possibly get away with the evil doing but they're seeing there's nobody to convince them that they will not get away with it but the Word of God says that they will not get away with it and it is up to the preaches of righteousness to preach that word that way and not to compromise with the stream of life which is flowing toward this way in that way of compromise and so on but I was thinking just think what could happen if the church could take description to heart other words could be so earnest in pure through the Word of God that would hide nothing to brother and sister wouldn't have anything evil down in the heart but would anything come up with quickly confess that if God could ever get a church on that kindred spirit of that like mine well I believe that our great wonders are wait to be performed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he says depart from iniquity when we are coming to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who ever let him that names the name of the Lord Jesus Christ depart from iniquity no one to do good and won't do it you see but therefore also wonders and signs and so forth can only spring from those who believe and are willing to act on their belief that when we walk with God no matter what height depth or nothing can harm us but somehow we have a habit of looking out outside and we just can't seem to believe what he said all the way he has a a triumphant role designed for the bride and there is going to be a people that is going to believe that and she's gonna leap over every wall out here I don't care what is in her way she's gonna like to chip break and forth into the sound barrier breaking on past it as we understand as he goes up there there's a lot of rattling and also rolling and whatnot and then it breaks out into peace and praise God if the bride could ever break past what man said and also unbelief and what this one says she'll get out there in the wild blue yonder and she'll really be resting in the Lord Jesus Christ and God said that he's gonna have a bride that is going to be conformed to his image she's already called she's already justified she's already glorified in his mind and Jesus saw in the gospel here and Mark the fourth chapter between first verse he asked a question is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick he's asking a question here and in short I believe what he's doing here he's putting us on the spot see we Christians who by the grace of God have been ignited with a lick of fire we are keepers of the flame God has set over us and sent into us part of his spirit that means that we have received that lick of fire and as we sit here this morning we are supposed to have this spirit in us that part of that pillar of fire and it's supposed to as we move from one to another with nothing in the heart and we are supposed to be sitting here in heavenly places and as we would hear the word of God this morning we could be saying Amen and our hearts in giving glory to God and as we see the Word of God moving throughout the earth now it is kindling the body of Jesus Christ that has laid dead across the world shackled and fettered and many man-made great denominations and so forth but the Lord has sent forth the word to cut and set his people free even brother ogr and if different ministers here are bringing that word to places where people are getting free from man-made denominations and brother Georgia can tell you how the which is the fire is spreading all down through South America and also now in the world but it goes on any way it is kindling the body of Jesus Christ as they laid there and the fire is coming to them to set them free jesus also said ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid so therefore let your light so Charon that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven while say this morning that the die is cast let us examine it further as he says here in st. Matthew here the fifth chapter near the fourteenth verse ye are the light of the world plus three other set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put on a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house that you're right so sharing before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven the purpose that is stated here for all good works is that anything that we would do in word or deed it would glorify the father that is supposed to be our purpose for existing there is supposed to be our purpose for living here in this world system here and he said that we are the light of the world in the the world of the universe there's the Sun the moon and the stars and therefore lights the Sun is the great light which types out Jesus Christ and the moon is types out to church to reflect the light of the Sun and the stars a little in the visual believers shining bright in the nighttime and that is supposed to be what we are supposed to be doing now as individuals shining forth our rights and as when we when we come together as a church with a brilliant light of the Lord Jesus Christ what Jesus is saying here he's telling us here in man's world system here on the earth the stars are right there but we are right yeah in the because cosmic world system here the system of men men's social system regardless though we have to live here we are still lights in this world and Jesus is only trying to bring us light that it made that if made because I reflect through us then we might reflect him in his word to the social system here set up by man and to understand what he means here by a candle it's not a candle as we understand a wax candle this is not this this here means an oil lamp in those days they had lamps made out of clay brass silver a goal and it's like bowls and they put a wick into the hall because of the olive all that rather and that was called a candle and we would think of it as it being a wax candle but it is not it is it was a vessel with olive oil in it and a wick in it and it was to burn and he is typing us as these lamps that we are to have our wicks saturated into oil and the fire on the other end and the candlestick is not a candlestick it is a lamp stand the lamp stand like this so high and the bowl set up on top of the lamp stand and the wick was in the bowl and so he was seen here that the we are not to have the lamps under a bushel nor under the bed he save us praise God to put us in some old institutional Church somewhere beneath of some bed or in under some bushel out in the world somewhere but he saved us are we getting through to shine as lights that is the purpose here we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood that we should show forth the good praises of him that has called us out of darkness into this marvelous light there sole purpose and being here to glorify him and you know as a type which I can't go into too much here but in any Old Testament most of you have read of the tabernacle of witness and in they had because they had three compartments the outer court the holy place and the most holy place and the holy place was the dr.xu bread and the lampstand and altar of incense and as we know it was Israel and the twelve tribes of Israel and on the shewbread table was twelve loaves representing each tribe and Aaron and the Levites was of the Levitical priesthood and I'll just say it to you you Bible scholars know the scriptures and so forth but the elements signified the tribe of Levi and numbers of 3:39 there was 20 mm male Levites and if you go back and check your scriptures you'll see that there were 22 bowls shaped like almonds and 22 flowers and 22 knobs also on the lamp stand there in the light on the lamp stand was to Israel the light that burned in the holy place was the law it was signifying the law of God the Ten Commandments which was given to Israel in their tabernacle Psalms 119 18 says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and the way it was every of seven years the the law the light was red and represented by a lamp on a lamp stand and there was on their lamp stand there was seven lamps on there and representing seven seven years but in in the law of Israel the seventh year was a year of rest and point to the millennial reign of Jesus Christ and they were told to have seven readings every seven years every seven years they wants to read the entire law and this was to happen seven times in seven times seven is forty-nine years and at the end of the 49 years they would have the fifth year which would be the Jubilee and the entire law prophesied of Jesus Christ thus we see at the lampstand as represented a tribe of Levi priests mind you were holding forth the light of that law which was the light and they were prophesied of the coming of the Messiah the Levites were to present the truth and we know today the lampstand today has moved over here into the seven church ages as we understand it and we are at the end of the seven churches and we know also that there has come forth a message of jubilee all those who have been bound by a system they don't have to be slaves to this world here they don't have to be slaved to some church for this Turner at the end of the seven for the entire Word of God which was represented back here every seven years all over here at the end of the seventh church ages the entire Word of God wants to be open as a light to shine into a dark place and it was to be prophesied and reveal play was the mysteries that God had hidden in his heart sealed up with seven seals over in the book of Revelation but he said that surely the Lord God will do nothing except he reveal his secret to his prophet so therefore God has allowed in the end time here or a prophet of God to come forth and to bring out these secrets for there can nothing be hid for God has a purpose for it to be made manifest and here in st. mark 422 Christ makes it clear that previously hidden the truth will be completely revealed that so that all might see and it's in this very agent Laodicea and revelation 3 he says anoint your eyes to see and what would he have light for if he wouldn't have our Deen eyes to see the light and we're so happy this morning that God has anointed our eyes to see the light here in the end time and Jesus uses here the illustration of the lamp Carol not to be put under a bed some old church somewhere or under some bushes no sir it is to be put up on the lamp stand and the lamp stand is the candlestick and that is the church represents the church so therefore our lamps which is our candles should be burning bright as ever in this seven church age a lamp stand or candlestick that was God's purpose for it to be and however we should have we should be today like a Gideon's 300 for they have lamps because kovalyova and pitchers and in well tonight amen to fight the enemy and the right time they break their pictures and their lights begin to Sharon and he began to blow their trumpets and cry out the soul of the Lord I believe that we are in the same time here this little type here we have we should break our pictures that the people might see the light amen and will the trumpet of the gospel that we all free when your son of man is set free is free indeed amen and we can put our swords and cry out the sword of the Lord this holy Lord the people are wandering and all perplex of one of what is going on but Gideon's 300 they know what's going on the Lord shall return and discern between who serves God and who doesn't serve God the wise shall know there - mighty exploits in ovarian when the people of feigning by the wayside in a very high where the people are perplexed and don't know what's going on God said that he would have a bride a man whose lamps would be burning who's Lance would be shiny a man whose legs were being pawed at seven churches there would be anointed to see and to understand to proclaim the Word of God healing in time and God has told us he has revealed to us fear none man a mess we could tell about these things here don't worry about it I'm backing you up I have much people in this city I am sending you forth the spirit of bride says come whoever first whosoever will let them come to the waters of life freely Amen we know who we are who is she praise God as Solomon said back here in there the because tenth verse here who is she had look at forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the Sun terrible as army of badness I say that that is the bride today praise God for she looks forth as the morning other words to the world the church system today it is one big dark long night but this says here Solomon has spoken here that there is somebody praise God that is looking forth as the morning there's somebody that a hope praise God has fell into their hearts and somehow God has brought peace to them amen and they know that look forth as the morning in other words they can look for for a new day for God has revealed to them that they can look forth to being the day of Jesus Christ amen they don't have to worry about the system here and what's happening here they know who they are and over here even over here in the Matthew 25 here there's two types of church people there is the foolish and it was the wise both claimed it to be virgin both claiming to be bride both looking for the second coming of Christ going forth but how can you tell both Ham lamps one has the original right that never went out and never will belong amen for it come from the altar fire and it was lit in the first stage the second age the 30s the fourth the fifth the six and a 1 come out with a extra blow a a bowl of oil that we might dip our weeks into that one was Malachi 4 make to meet sure that our lamps would not go out God in His mercy Amen drop down on a bowl of oil praise God that we might take extra business with us for the Bible declare that the wise took extra vessels besides their own lamp which is a candle they took an extra vessel and I would imagine it was filled to the brim with oil for this message is overflowing I can't find no pots no missiles to turn it up well just come in as coming please cut it's coming from the animals inside it is fully like a river of rushing water just flowing out here it is here it is god himself brother we know who we are but how can you tell here and the other one has a lamp on soul but it doesn't have any extra oil it is going forth in this hour without the message trying to meet the bridegroom it is going forth in a worldly condition please God and he and they're going forth they don't have a revelation of what they are supposed to be doing and their wicks are all smudged up and also encrusted and whatnot and what she is needing is for God to take the golden tongues and those golden snippers to sniff out that those wicks there and because trim those whoops because wicks down that she might burn and dip those wicks in the oil where you saw God amen and therefore the the foolish carried no extra vessels withal and in dainty vessels where it bowls I want to read something here in closing and say something here feel a little bit better now praise the Lord Zechariah you want to turn to it I want to lean us on here and close our within here does that karai the fourth chapter speaking about this vision here of the candlestick here an angel that talked with me came again and what and wake me as a man that is waking out of his sleep and said unto me what sea is now and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a ball upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon in seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side there up so I answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then angel that talked with me a she answered and said unto me Noah not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zoo revolt saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou old great mountain before serval thou shalt become a plain he shall bring forth the headstone there with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and we see here that there was a lamp a candlestick of gold a bowl has the candlestick like this on a top was a bowl which was a a reservoir here because for the oil and seven lamps up on the top of that and seven pipes to the seven lamps and there was seven wicks down in the pipes and these two olive trees here we believe to be Moses and Elijah because to the Jew and it was a large bowl and essential to seven ohms that could come out of it and the bowl was filled with olive oil and which flows through the seven wicks placed into seven arms and it's the same all that burns and it makes the light at the end of the seven pipes and then light never went out for the priests went into the sanctuary and a poured oil into the bowls and the wicks kept burning in the lamp and it was lit in a special way you fire over your 7:38 the the priests took the fire from this special holy altar sacred altar rather which was originally lighted by the fire of God and he lit from that fire to the first lamp and took the light from the first lamp and lit the second and so on and so on until the last lamp was lit and then the holy fire from the lamp pass is a wonderful type of the spirit in the seventh church ages when the holy fire of God fell on the day of Pentecost and in that fire went to Paul and lip T Ephesus church and Smyrna and Pergamus and right on down to the last age but we are promised at the end of a each that would come forth a messenger and we would he would bring forth the same fire at the head in the first one when they first fell in the original outpouring of Pentecost and we find today then that there is a hidden life and there is a visible life now there's a hidden life in God and fed by the Word of God and I believe that God has had a bride hid away for the past seven years of soul hidden in this hidden life and fit by the Word of God but I believe narrow that the time is right where God is going to make this bride visible and then the visible life which is dynamics is burning and shining given light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost and all day or we are looking around where is that that additional fire that the seven lamps drew from and the light and the life from the oil in the main bowls and I feel today that as Israel in Zacharias vision here those two olive trees were standing there continually all the time pouring oil into that main bowl that those wicks would never go dry and I feel that in the seven church agents that there were seven stars in each age that poured oil into our bowls that they would never go dry and I feel that we have received a messenger in the last day here that has poured the original all back into the bowl and there is no need for any woman church to have a dry wick when the oil is free the oil is here whosoever will let him come there is no need to have a dry life when the original life is here to be made manifest to you for the messenger has come forth with the holy fire from the altar and is ready to pour upon you through the Word of God and we know that our wicks which types because our lives one end of the wick was dipped in the oil and the other end of the wick was burning and therefore our lives should be constantly dipped in the Holy Ghost oil and the other end of us should be constantly burning for Jesus Christ it should be set on fire in this age but we are individual lamps on a candlestick and the last versions today or drawing from the main bowl that's why if they wonder or what do you have she has she is drawing her oil from that message and her lamp her wick rather is burning and notice that God is a consuming fire and is God's purpose that if our life is the wick then the wick should be consumed by the fire and as God's purpose that our lives should be consumed by the fire of his word and it is his purpose to bring his word to our wicks to burn it and that is why we have instruction and correction in God's house that we might know how to be in this last day and brother I tell you our wicks should be dipped in the oil of Jesus Christ in the end time here as we see the hour now perching us we know that the wheat has laid here oh I'd say about seven years of salt ripening and maturing in those who haven't because come out with which he relations they are wondering and waiting for the promise of God to be made manifest and yet we know that when that we turns from a green to a golden brown and yet though it be a mature there's still a little short period before harvests where the wheat though mature and ripen yet is still wet and we know then that the only thing I can dry it out that it might Manifesto ripeness of Jesus Christ is that dynamics and we know it'll take the dynamics of God to dry us out consume our flesh by the fire from God's altar and I'm quite sure all of you here or this morning or waiting for this here for Zacharias that it's not by might collective power and denominations and so forth not by power of force but by my spirit saith the Lord and his spirit is the oil and it is the oil that is doing it today and we can praise God for the wick itself has no oil it has to be dipped into the oil and it has to burn so we praise God to know that he is now in his office performing through his word applying it in power to our hearts that we and we should cherish the Ministry of the word the ministry that comes to us for instruction and correction and reproof painful though it may be is painful a lot of times we have to be stripped but what a privilege is ours in the last days here that God is going to allow us to be lamps to burn for him and as we bring the real apostolic doctrine the Alpher the light to a world enveloped in midnight darkness out here Jesus said is said over here in the deep Erebus of the convergence here in the ninth Prince Bokar bleed 1/6 verse and midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh and friends two groups went out to meet the bridegroom in this hour both churches and one church was dry didn't even know they saw to believe God intellectually in their mind they have the only idea what of the way they think God should be and the other group or they have the wicks dipped in the message and they have no thought of their own they're having a message in the message tells them what God is so therefore and then that is what they Express and therefore many cannot understand that many cannot understand how or you can just come out from among the unclean thing and want to burn for God well there was a great man of God then hear me Martin he said when he reached the shores of India many years ago missionary I believe he was he said now let me burn out for God and he burned out in about six years what he left behind a cousin incredible because achievement the Bible translation in Indian language was left behind him but he burned out for God and I was wondering this morning to finish up that if we could understand and get to real purpose why God has called us here this morning and why the Lord has given us this beautiful sanctuary here in Forest Hills for I believe with all my heart in Revelation 10 at the word of the Lord as John spoke there is to go before kings nations and multitudes as it has gone in the form of a ripened seed in letters and I mean in book rather spoken word books and tapes and so forth Bobby that there will be one more ride and I believe that he will come and he will wherever the seed has gone he will come right behind it and ride this trail once more I'll be able to become with all my heart but I want to say I feel this here that as we sit here this morning and we are dedicating this building back to God do you really understand do you realize what it is for it is for God's purpose there are much people in this city there are those here in this city here in the message perhaps maybe because they don't see eye to eye but the Bible says that the ministers and the people will see eye to eye I believe with all my heart I'll be there he'll take the dynamics of God to bring this to pass in our lives and I feel that here the scripture saith that the spirit and the bride say come revelation three message was given to one man to a rebuke deed of denominations and call out a Brian that was his message I don't see another messenger coming in that line but I do see a Brian because that same spirit is to come up on that bride and to say out through us come well for people here in this city here around here and it's boring here rather in anyway because you may be for them to come to you you've got to have something they can't just come to something dry they have to adjust to a church building here they have to come the Greeks of saying we would see Jesus the Greeks were looking for Jesus they wanted to see this man that manifest its love and manifest the power of God and the people out in the street here are wanting to know of what can we do where can we go everything is upside down and nobody knows what to do and I believe in this very hour that God is going to ignite some lamps and set them on fire and be a real witness and a real testimony in this city here of this message here and I'll read it with all my heart do you believe that praise our God and the Song of Solomon says here it's already here to you who is she a look at forth as the morning there is some clear as the Sun in terrible as an army with banners who is she where is she the moon the Sun banner I believe that she is a people that has been called out of every denomination from it from every walk of life and I believe God has set her down and he is she is like she is going through the time of burning burning out all the infirmities getting her ready riping her maturing her and getting her ready and where is she's in every nation under the Sun I believe with all my heart and I believe that she is shining now the message of God in the mechanical form for or without him she can do nothing for we know that we can add to our faith virtue patience temperance godliness brotherly kindness and knowledge and we can do that and we have that now and yet we fail but take heart this morning charity never faileth and I'm waiting on that charity never faileth I have the message and I have virtue I have faith I have patience knowledge and temperance and trying to manifest brotherly kindness and so forth but yet I feel every day but I feel that when charity breaks forth when the fire the full of that fire breaks forth then that bride will never fail she will have thus saith the Lord or she'll keep still bleeeh with all my heart I bleed as sure as she has in her now the shout of victory but as Joshua bid it Israel shout when I say shout praise God so therefore I feel that when the Lion of Judah is ready to tell her to shout she will speak and who can but prophesy for the lion hath Lord I'll believe that this joy in our hearts this morning for there is a river of water as from the animals being that is flowing out of her [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all sin and shape [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's race upon his leadership [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] every hit ball softly [Music]
