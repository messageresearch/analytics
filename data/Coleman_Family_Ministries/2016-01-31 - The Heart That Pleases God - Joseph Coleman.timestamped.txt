[0:00] Now, if you would turn with me to
[0:02] Revelation 21, I have a few expressions
[0:05] upon my heart that I just like to
[0:07] express and and because I can only
[0:10] express it because through the word that
[0:12] is my only channel. I'm nothing and uh
[0:16] nothing to give, nothing to offer, but
[0:18] just the word of God. That's all I have.
[0:20] And that is by the grace of God. I want
[0:23] to read from Revelation 21 the first
[0:26] verse through the 7th. I want to read
[0:28] from Ezekiel the 36th chapter, the 26th
[0:31] verse. And I want to read from Ephesians
[0:34] the 6th chapter, the 6th
[0:36] verse. Like a timeless little thought,
[0:39] but a heart that pleases
[0:41] God. And I saw a new heaven and a new
[0:43] earth. For the first heaven and the
[0:45] first earth were passed away, and there
[0:47] was no more sea. And I, John, saw the
[0:50] holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down
[0:52] from God out of heaven, prepared as a
[0:54] bride adown for her husband. And I heard
[0:57] a voice, a great voice out of heaven,
[0:59] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[1:02] is with men, and he will dwell with
[1:04] them, and they shall be his people, and
[1:08] God himself shall be with them, and be
[1:10] their
[1:11] God. And God shall wipe away all tears
[1:14] from their eyes, and there shall be no
[1:17] more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
[1:20] neither shall there be any more pain,
[1:22] for the former things are passed away."
[1:24] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[1:26] "Behold, I make all things new." He said
[1:28] unto me, "Right, for these words are
[1:30] true and faithful, said unto me, it is
[1:32] done. I am alpha and omega, the
[1:34] beginning and the end. I will give unto
[1:36] him that is a thirst of the fountain of
[1:38] the water of life freely. He that
[1:40] overcometh shall inherit all things, and
[1:42] I will be his God, he shall be my son."
[1:45] I like to read from Ezekiel 36th
[1:50] chapter 26th verse. A new heart I also
[1:53] will I give you, and a new spirit will I
[1:56] put within you, and I will take away the
[1:58] stony heart out of your flesh, and I'll
[2:00] give you a heart of flesh, and I will
[2:02] put my spirit within you, and cause you
[2:04] to walk in my statutes, and ye shall
[2:06] keep my judgments, and do
[2:08] them. And Ephesians 6th chapter, the 6th
[2:13] verse, reads on this
[2:16] wise, not with my service. See, doing
[2:19] God's statutes and commandments as men
[2:22] pleasers, but as the servants of Christ,
[2:25] doing the will of God from the heart.
[2:27] May God a blessing to the reading of
[2:29] this word. We like to tie this little
[2:31] thought, the heart that pleases God.
[2:34] Now,
[2:35] we see by the word of God that uh we
[2:40] cannot please God by our service as men
[2:43] pleasers. Amen. But see, he said that
[2:46] the only way that we can please God,
[2:48] see, is to be servants. And servants are
[2:51] born slaves. And then servants doing the
[2:54] will of God from the heart. And we know
[2:57] that eye service as men pleasers is if I
[3:01] watch you or the deacons watch you, you
[3:04] do good. And you smile. And we say
[3:06] because praise the Lord, that's men
[3:08] pleasers. Amen. So if you see the deacon
[3:11] standing there and you do everything
[3:12] right, but when the deacon is not there
[3:14] and the mess isn't there, then are you
[3:17] doing service to the Lord from the
[3:19] heart? That's who God is watching. His
[3:21] eyes are watching you all the time.
[3:23] Therefore, don't fear me. Don't fear the
[3:25] deacons. Don't fear the minister. We
[3:28] don't have a heaven nor a hell. See, but
[3:30] fear God, for he all glory belongs to
[3:34] God. Vision is mine, saith the Lord.
[3:37] Amen. But however, people can't help it.
[3:40] They just must look at a man. See, and
[3:42] that's just the way it's been. They must
[3:44] look at man. But all the time, God is
[3:46] always trying to get man to look at him.
[3:49] And he is the word. So the invisible
[3:51] king that is in exile. See, he's
[3:55] watching us all the time. Amen. His word
[3:57] is here. He has given graciously because
[4:01] his word to us, we have the word given
[4:03] us a place to worship the Lord. Amen.
[4:06] He's blessed us with jobs and good
[4:08] health and so forth. That's all in this
[4:10] wicked city, Sodom and Gomorrah. Here we
[4:13] are. Men are out of all nations and
[4:15] different kinds of people. And I often
[4:18] rejoice and say, "Well, only the Lord
[4:20] Jesus Christ would choose a place like
[4:22] Sodom here. What good could come out of
[4:25] here? What good could come out of?"
[4:27] Because Nazareth, which was a red light
[4:29] district, what good could come forth
[4:31] from uh the place of Antioch, which was
[4:34] a filthy place, but that's the first
[4:36] place where the men began to call him
[4:38] Christians for they saw Christ. You
[4:40] follow me now? So here we here in New
[4:43] York. What good to come from New York?
[4:46] Nothing down here. A bunch of sin and a
[4:49] whole lot of different kind of people
[4:50] all gang up together as God's prophet
[4:52] said. All punch up together. See, the
[4:54] only good to come from here is the heart
[4:56] of God. For God's looking for hearts.
[4:59] And so we see then that friends that God
[5:01] has promised us all these things in the
[5:04] Bible here, a new heaven, a new place, a
[5:07] new everything. And he has promised to
[5:10] give us a new heart. Amen. That we might
[5:13] worship God with a new heart and a new
[5:15] spirit. And the Lord
[5:17] Jesus has sent down his word which is
[5:21] his message Malachi 4 through his
[5:23] prophet and he has come and brought us
[5:26] the message of the hour. And then those
[5:29] of us that have received this message we
[5:32] have received God for God is the word.
[5:35] When we partake of the word we partake
[5:37] of God. You see to me now but it's so
[5:40] simple it'll pass by. The prophet of the
[5:42] Lord said he said it something will come
[5:44] forth. He said way back and it'll pass
[5:46] along and you won't know it. See it'll
[5:48] be the Holy Spirit. See and in the word
[5:50] it just come out so simple and humble.
[5:53] The prophet of God even preached the
[5:54] message God hidden in simplicity. And
[5:57] there he told just he laid out the whole
[5:59] thing. He says go back home plant
[6:01] potatoes because going back plant
[6:02] potatoes. All right. If you're a bus
[6:05] driver going back drive your bus
[6:06] mailman. Go on back and be a mailman.
[6:08] Whatever you're doing go back and do it.
[6:09] You know it's going to happen. This
[6:11] going to be the same way. Follow me now.
[6:13] All things are the same since the
[6:14] fathers fell asleep. It's in the word.
[6:16] See, and it must be unbelief. And
[6:19] unbelief is here and we see it. And so
[6:22] therefore, that must be. But we find
[6:25] then, friends, that God, we like to
[6:28] break down his church because three-fold
[6:30] is as the body of Christ and as also as
[6:34] as a building and a bride. And as a
[6:36] body, we are part of the body that
[6:38] expresses Christ. As the building, we
[6:41] are part of of the building that
[6:43] enshrines God. And as his bride, we are
[6:47] part of the bride that God has given his
[6:50] loving care to. You see me now, these
[6:53] are our blessings. And so, but the enemy
[6:56] tries to keep us from this. He don't
[6:57] want us to know this. And as we press
[7:00] forward to this year,
[7:02] 1967, we see we have to be blind not to
[7:06] know what is transpiring. We see all
[7:09] kind of things are going on. For this we
[7:11] know that God has sanctified us because
[7:15] already before the foundation of the
[7:17] world, the blood of God has perfected
[7:20] us. We know also that coming forth is a
[7:25] message that will shake the nations.
[7:27] It'll be the eagle message which is the
[7:29] same the word of God. The prophet said
[7:31] there's coming forth a message. Brother,
[7:34] you won't even know what it is. It will
[7:35] be the the pure or adulterated word of
[7:37] God. The prophet of God prophesied in 62
[7:40] that when Elijah comes forth, true
[7:43] ministers of the word of God will not
[7:45] understand Elijah. Therefore, how will
[7:47] the people understand him? But he'll
[7:49] come nevertheless and proclaim that
[7:51] message in the last days. And it'll turn
[7:55] the hearts of the eagles with beaks that
[7:57] just want to receive from the mother
[7:59] eagle as the mother eagle swoops down
[8:02] with that first kill meat. Amen. And
[8:05] those things suck up the blood of God.
[8:08] For in the blood is the life of God. In
[8:11] the blood is the life. And many people
[8:13] they run around saying, "Well, because
[8:15] what naturally are you and are you
[8:17] saved? Are you deceived serpent? This
[8:19] and that." But God by him blood has
[8:22] perfected his people. The word of God.
[8:25] Then we'll see. We We just keep still.
[8:28] Let flesh run rapid. See, let him talk
[8:31] cuz we don't know any way. But see, God
[8:34] said, "Heaven and earth shall pass away,
[8:37] but not his words. My words shall never
[8:39] pass away. Man's words mean nothing to
[8:43] me
[8:43] or God. I don't care what man says. I
[8:48] don't care how many what man said to me.
[8:51] How much he reviles me, I'm getting
[8:53] blessed." God says, "Blessed are you
[8:56] when you being reviled." If men don't
[8:59] understand what are we doing up here
[9:00] preaching the word of God, that's all
[9:02] right. God bless him. This is the age.
[9:04] You see me now. But God said that when
[9:07] the blood, see, there's going to be a
[9:10] blood test in the resurrection. And that
[9:12] blood test will be the life of Christ.
[9:15] Doesn't matter. No matter if it's
[9:18] a junk where you come from, Africa,
[9:22] Alaska, America, Australia, but the test
[9:25] will be the right of Christ, not the
[9:28] outside vessel for God looking not on
[9:31] the appearance, but God looking for the
[9:33] hearts so people can sit up and push up
[9:38] and because think come down for all this
[9:42] this genealogy and that genealogy and
[9:45] I'm angry action and uh I'm this and I'm
[9:47] that and I'm from this and so on. That
[9:50] don't mean one thing to God. Friends, if
[9:54] you think you will take you away, you
[9:56] are sadly mistaken. It is the heart that
[9:59] Elijah has restored to the word of God
[10:02] which is the will of God. That is the
[10:05] only thing that will take you in. And as
[10:08] we see then the the eagles, the mother
[10:11] eagle comes down and gives the eagle
[10:13] that's the food. As we were explaining
[10:16] to you about 2 weeks ago, when the eagle
[10:18] so from 1 month old, 2 month old, 3
[10:20] months old, they're all open beaks.
[10:22] That's all the eagle does not the mother
[10:24] eagle don't look behind the beak to see
[10:26] what they look like. But he drops that
[10:28] fresh car into the beak and the beak
[10:31] says either
[10:34] I don't care about genealogies and where
[10:36] you come from where you think you are.
[10:38] It means nothing to God whatsoever.
[10:41] So we find vers that his redemptive
[10:44] death, see his sacrifice. That's exactly
[10:48] right. And when his life comes forth,
[10:50] we'll see who we are. The
[10:52] pres shut up. You're rocking the boat.
[10:55] Wait till the sun come up. Amen. So
[10:57] they're trying to figure out who's in
[10:59] the message. Did it go over? Did you go
[11:02] this? Forget about it. Love your
[11:04] brother. Amen. Tight. Amen. Draw closer
[11:08] by the love of God.
[11:10] It'll all be interpreted in the
[11:12] resurrection. You'll find out. See, so
[11:15] we know that our standing with God is
[11:18] perfect. See, and our state we are
[11:21] maturing. We are lightning. In spite of
[11:24] ourselves, we are lightning. Amen. For
[11:26] God said we're being it is. It needs no
[11:30] interpretation. It is.
[11:33] So, how is this possible? He's given us
[11:35] a new heart. A new heart. Now we say,
[11:38] "Well, I'm from this group and I'm from
[11:41] over there and this and that and we are
[11:43] the bride." See, my husband
[11:46] think so have God in the body and God in
[11:51] the body quickened
[11:53] this. This went up to the great men up
[11:56] there in Jerusalem. All the little
[11:58] pieces up there, but he couldn't quicken
[12:00] his soul. He had the life in his body.
[12:02] Amen. He quickened the soul. See me now.
[12:05] So who you are, what you look like, it
[12:07] is Christ in you, the home of glory.
[12:10] Amen. Car use a donkey. He look what you
[12:13] look like. The word of the Lord. That's
[12:15] a man who's preaching the word of God.
[12:17] Is whether you are dedicated to hearing
[12:20] the word of God. And faith cometh by
[12:23] not looks like. But whether you hear and
[12:27] receive and act upon the word of God and
[12:30] recognize the word of God and recognize
[12:32] during your visitation. Amen. For the
[12:35] prophet said to be one here and one
[12:36] there. And when they asked him, Lord,
[12:39] when will your son come be? He says,
[12:42] "Where are the eagles at?" There where
[12:45] are they? Back in Joel, it said that the
[12:48] swing bodies there and the eagles there.
[12:51] And the eagles set up the blood and then
[12:54] they said, "Where are they? They
[12:56] demanded where I mean or
[12:59] of where eagles are." Amen.
[13:04] What we really want is a White House not
[13:06] a message. Amen. Or should it be uh
[13:09] because uh Revelation 19
[13:12] message or what? Where the eagles are
[13:15] that's what I manifest myself to the
[13:18] eagles whether they are in Europe,
[13:21] Australia, Africa, Jamaica, wherever
[13:23] they are cuz I can't get the whole bleed
[13:27] message. You finding out they believe
[13:28] the word of God. So we find that that's
[13:32] where I'll be at where the eagles are
[13:34] eating the whole word of God. That's
[13:36] exactly where I'll be at. And when I was
[13:38] just listening or reading a brother's
[13:42] prayer and it struck my heart on the
[13:44] wings of a snow white dove certain thing
[13:47] which he said which I like to read to
[13:49] you as he prayed all of us heard this
[13:52] message I believe and we know that it
[13:54] really means something to us. It it just
[13:56] took our part of our heart here. We all
[13:58] know, we all understand that. And at his
[14:00] prayer, he said, "You gave now a sign.
[14:03] You gave the world a sign. You gave me a
[14:05] sign." The next day, seeing that eagle
[14:07] flying, oh God, there is a
[14:10] message coming forth now. Eagle message.
[14:14] I pray God that you will let the dog
[14:16] lead him. It has given me a faith. He
[14:19] gave him the faith. See, I never had
[14:21] before. Tonight, send down your message
[14:25] again, Lord, on the wings of a double
[14:27] word. Remember that God is not a
[14:29] respectable persons. He could send a
[14:32] message to Noah, to John the Baptist. He
[14:34] could send a message to me. He can send
[14:36] because to others also. If you can't
[14:39] afford to say this, then say it,
[14:42] brother. I have been wrong all my life.
[14:44] I have wanted to serve God, but tonight
[14:47] I'm ready to surrender. Pray God that
[14:50] the devil will fly into my heart
[14:52] tonight. I can feel it flow with its
[14:56] wings as he comes in. Raise your hands
[14:59] here in the visible audience my all over
[15:02] the building way out in the audiences
[15:03] across the country way up to New York
[15:06] out to brother Mercer. Those at Tucson
[15:09] burn tabernacle across the West Coast
[15:10] raise your hands everywhere. I let the
[15:13] daughter fly into my heart tonight.
[15:15] Bring me God's sweet love on the wings
[15:17] of a snow white dove. The Holy Spirit,
[15:20] bring it to me tonight, Lord. Drop into
[15:22] my heart the faith that I have need of.
[15:25] The wounded dove has brought the message
[15:27] back. Oh, God is finished. We believe
[15:30] that. Do you all that
[15:32] prayer? Well, um I was thinking about
[15:36] that prayer, the dove. And I said, well,
[15:38] what could I speak this morning about?
[15:41] and being the first day of the year and
[15:43] I happened to pick up the paper. I saw
[15:45] something here and sometimes I want to
[15:47] speak to you because through a little
[15:49] article and the title struck me hawks
[15:53] may rule Washington DC roost in
[15:57] 1967. Now the question is will President
[16:00] Johnson's
[16:02] administration his group be dominated by
[16:05] the Hunts and the Doves in ' 67? I
[16:09] believe because you begin to get it now.
[16:12] There are sharp differences in the
[16:15] ranks, but the prevailing attitude in
[16:18] Congress appears to be
[16:19] hawkked. White House advises divided
[16:22] too, seeming also to lean toward a hawk
[16:26] line to increase military pressure in
[16:29] Vietnam over attempts to lure economists
[16:31] to a conference table with a DAL like
[16:33] approach. Secretary of State Rusk,
[16:36] President Advisor Ward Fast and most of
[16:39] the generals and admirals are
[16:41] acknowledged hosts. Ambassador Goldberg,
[16:44] Haramman, and Namera are considered
[16:46] thugs for the most part. The president
[16:49] who must make the final decision to
[16:50] escalate or not keeps ordering more
[16:53] troops into the field while at the same
[16:55] time holding out to the island
[16:57] branch. Couple more. The
[17:01] uh that's about Yeah. Now notice this
[17:04] here. So I read that I thought God moves
[17:08] in the natural first all the time. See,
[17:10] and you're watching the spiritual. Then
[17:12] I thought that the the question was will
[17:16] President Johnson's administration be
[17:18] dominated by the hawks or the doves in '
[17:20] 67? There sharp differences in the
[17:23] ranks, but the prevailing attitude in
[17:25] Congress appears to be hawk. Will the
[17:27] hawk spirit rule your roost in ' 67?
[17:31] I'll ask you a question. See me now.
[17:33] Will he rule your roots in 67? Will the
[17:36] groups from this message be dominated by
[17:40] the hawks of the doves? Amen. This
[17:44] question I asked this morning, see the
[17:46] make believers are going forth the pit.
[17:49] He's a dove. So, but he's a makeel
[17:51] believer. These ministers who go south
[17:54] and walk up and down for civil rights,
[17:56] those are make believers also. See me
[17:58] now. Come in and sheep's clothing. But
[18:01] they're wars. They teach a different
[18:02] doctrine. You follow me now? These are
[18:04] not make believers. And notice the make
[18:06] believer in the natural acting out like
[18:09] he's a dove. You follow me now? So here
[18:13] we are in
[18:14] groups and we hear now and God's message
[18:19] coming out of the dove. And then I see
[18:22] the prophet's words setting the pace for
[18:24] the nation. for back in ' 65. He also
[18:27] preached against the ministers down
[18:29] there, the seeding the shock. So you
[18:31] lazy hawks and there was a 100 sitting
[18:34] up on the platform up there. They know
[18:36] that he was speaking to them. So you
[18:37] lazy hawks, you sit around watching to
[18:40] the spirit and go out and meet God and
[18:42] feed the sheep. Amen. But they fly
[18:44] around looking for ties and running
[18:46] around. Don't want to do anything. And
[18:48] so there was a hot spirit where they
[18:50] look what has happened in our country in
[18:53] the natural. The hearts never before are
[18:57] be are going to they are now only lost.
[19:00] Therefore, this is a real life spirit
[19:04] that the miracle is supposed to be
[19:06] aware. But the Bible says she will speak
[19:08] like a dragon through Hol spirit. Now we
[19:13] have the same Hulk spirit in the groups.
[19:16] Is that right? All right, brother. You
[19:18] going to try to preach the word of God
[19:20] in these groups. See if those hawks
[19:22] don't run you out of there. Brother, you
[19:24] can't even get anointing or nothing in
[19:26] there. The Hulk spirit. Therefore, you
[19:28] say cuz you can't kill the heart. But
[19:31] will you let the Hulk spirit rule your
[19:33] heart or will you let the dog move into
[19:36] your heart and let the dog lead you for
[19:39] 1967? What will you do this morning? You
[19:42] follow me now? So we see friends then
[19:44] that we are to this year dedicate
[19:48] ourselves to God that Lord let the dark
[19:51] spirit move into my heart this morning.
[19:54] For we see in the natural all these
[19:56] things that happens there are types. The
[19:59] prophet tells us that there are types
[20:01] and now we see in the spiritual that the
[20:03] hawks want to take over the groups and
[20:06] they will see me now for the little
[20:09] doves have to sit there cuz they're
[20:11] peaceike. They don't fight nobody. They
[20:13] don't talk about nobody. They love every
[20:16] word of God. If it's a minister that's
[20:18] in the word of God, they accept that.
[20:20] They love one another. They don't get on
[20:22] the phones and bust down one another and
[20:24] so forth back and forth. That those are
[20:26] hot spirits doing that. See me now. So
[20:28] therefore, God knows all things, but he
[20:30] showed us all the signs. And we know
[20:32] that the dove comes to live like
[20:36] spirits. Only to live like spirits.
[20:39] for the dove settles down on the rail.
[20:42] And here was a prophet trying to get
[20:45] through to the people to be a lamb for
[20:50] he was a rail. Christ was a ramen now.
[20:53] We are to be a lamb spirit that the dust
[20:56] might fly and flood into our hearts. And
[20:59] we find that we are all looking for the
[21:01] resurrection. And yet every man is
[21:03] saying that I'm going to die. That's
[21:05] wonderful. But we have to live it.
[21:08] Finally now we have people gathered here
[21:12] from all different places here. God has
[21:14] his own hearts manifested here. And you
[21:18] say what is the heart? Heart is
[21:20] patience. A heart is faith in the word
[21:22] of God. A heart is believing the things
[21:25] of God. The heart now of God. As we sit
[21:29] here now to hear the word of God, the
[21:31] hearts press through the darkness. As
[21:34] the veil drops down over the
[21:36] congregation call, you have to keep on
[21:39] pressing until you reach that mark. Then
[21:43] you must press your way on through for
[21:45] the enemy will put a sleepy spirit upon
[21:48] you. And then the minister begins to
[21:50] mess the word of God. Now we begin to
[21:53] come alive. Amen. that the word of the
[21:56] Lord might have free court. I know we're
[21:57] tired. I know we all working for the
[22:00] master, but the God's word still has to
[22:03] come through. Father, to press on
[22:05] through the hearts. We know he don't
[22:08] want you to preach the word for this is
[22:10] the worst season for any man of God to
[22:13] preach the word. But he just he just
[22:15] stomping about all over the place. But I
[22:17] know one thing that uh by the grace of
[22:20] God, if God has called you, will you
[22:23] just preach the word of God? That's not
[22:25] just out there. See now the eagles, the
[22:29] birds will come. The hearts of fight
[22:33] will press on through anyway and get on
[22:35] through to the eagles. It doesn't matter
[22:37] how many times they knock you down, but
[22:40] if you will stand up to the Lord, take
[22:43] that sharp sword and cut through those
[22:46] hard spirits and move on with God. Amen.
[22:49] I don't care how many hard faces or what
[22:52] this one
[22:53] fac whatsoever. There's nothing to God
[22:57] whatsoever is his word will go forth to
[23:00] the eagles. Amen. See, so we see in
[23:03] friends that David was a lamb after
[23:07] God's heart, own heart. Amen. The Lord
[23:10] saw a man after his own heart. It says
[23:12] over in 1 Samuel, now God did not take
[23:16] denying him because he was fatless. He
[23:18] had many faults. We all know now there
[23:21] were many great heroes of God. But the
[23:24] Bible says that David was a man after
[23:26] God's own heart. And it seemed like the
[23:28] Holy Spirit has preached here about
[23:30] David last Sunday. So we might just
[23:32] might uh because confirm it this morning
[23:35] by the same Holy Ghost to start sending
[23:37] it off of the third message about David
[23:40] as the Holy Spirit leads it. So we find
[23:42] it through as we trying to press our way
[23:44] through. It's got to be darkness. But
[23:46] that's the
[24:00] glorifiness. Satan hates the word, but
[24:03] the eagles love him. The beast come on
[24:06] through. And when that spirit moves in,
[24:08] they just pray and praise God. Thank
[24:10] God. for the will of God. Amen. So we
[24:14] see friends that David made many
[24:16] mistakes and he did two horrible things,
[24:19] adultery and murder. See, but the only
[24:22] thing in connection with David's sin
[24:24] that please God was his deep repentance
[24:27] towards God. So God allowed to happen to
[24:30] show you the true
[24:38] happiness forgive me. Hallelujah. that
[24:41] no whatsoever. But it's the Lord that
[24:45] will suck up ashes. Stretch out the
[24:48] floor before God. Say, "Lord, God
[24:50] forgive me." Now, where can I go to my
[24:52] brother make it right to make it right?
[24:54] Where can I go and make it right with
[24:56] not brother forgive me? Hallelujah. On
[24:58] the phone at all with God, that bro
[25:01] contrite spirit that with that spirit,
[25:04] we can live a clean heart and a right
[25:06] spirit again to to worship God. Amen.
[25:10] Can we say amen? Amen. Because today, if
[25:14] the people, if we were to judge David,
[25:16] we would pull him down out of God's Hall
[25:18] of Fame, the people would see you. Can
[25:22] you murder you? And what about Joseph?
[25:24] If the people today heard one thing upon
[25:27] the minister being in connection with a
[25:28] woman somewhere, have to go to jail, he
[25:30] can never preach no more. Is that right?
[25:32] But look at Joseph. They're innocent.
[25:33] You see what I mean now? So therefore,
[25:36] it's uh it's the attitude. Amen. is
[25:39] whether you're willing to forgive and
[25:41] God says he said how many times Lord
[25:44] seven times 70 you forgive seven times 7
[25:47] I'll give you a heart to forgive but if
[25:49] you forgive you have an unforgiving
[25:51] spirit and came by Genesis is now being
[25:55] manifested as a hulk in 1967 manifest
[25:59] itself as a hulk on a dove amen the dove
[26:04] will forgive but the hulk will not
[26:06] forgive he'll cut you to rivets all all
[26:08] the time. Amen. See me now. They can't
[26:12] forgive. It's not in them to forgive.
[26:14] They will never forgive. So we find
[26:17] friends
[26:17] that your position, our position in
[26:20] David position is secure in God's hall
[26:22] of fame. It's his hall of fame, not
[26:24] Mary's Hall of Fame. Amen. David reaped
[26:27] when he sold. Now, we're not supporting
[26:29] sin here. No s. So 2 Chronicles 17:3
[26:33] says, "And the Lord was with
[26:35] Jehoshaphat because he walked in the
[26:38] first ways." Amen. Let's draw that on.
[26:43] Jehoshaphat walked in the first ways of
[26:46] his father David and sought not unto see
[26:50] David's first ways. So we want to speak
[26:51] about his first ways. You see the other
[26:54] ways? Well, that happened. That's
[26:55] between David and God. Had nothing to do
[26:57] with it. But what we're talking about
[26:59] now is people lightning before the Lord.
[27:01] You see me now? And so now we see it in
[27:03] front of God does not look at at the eye
[27:07] of man at all. For the people by all
[27:10] rights, Saul should have been the man as
[27:12] brother Bible was explained to us last
[27:13] Sunday here. For he was a goodly young
[27:16] man, a choice young man. He was head and
[27:18] shoulders above everybody else. He had
[27:21] all that hereditary because could
[27:23] because given her could give him. He had
[27:27] he was natural fitness. powerful man,
[27:30] good-looking, handsome, everybody loved
[27:32] him. See, and David was a son of an old
[27:35] man. That's all. That was the only claim
[27:37] to fame. A son of an old man, nothing.
[27:39] But Saul, but God said, "I don't look at
[27:42] the outward appearance." And I pray to
[27:44] God that the Holy Spirit can get this
[27:46] over to you. Many people are bound by
[27:48] looking at the outward appearance. And
[27:51] because they look at the flesh and not
[27:53] the heart, God says, "I look at the
[27:56] heart, not the flesh." man of the flesh
[27:59] color this color that color at the
[28:01] heart. For before the foundation of the
[28:04] world before any flesh come forward, I
[28:07] do hearts receive the word of God. No
[28:09] matter what kind of car I put them into
[28:12] is the
[28:14] heart flesh. So if you can't understand,
[28:17] this is the time to understand it now
[28:19] for God is trying to rip a thing off.
[28:21] Even here when we all heard that God's
[28:23] traffic was to preach uh because the uh
[28:26] deceased serpent and many say was the
[28:29] sound is mixed up on the color question
[28:31] therefore have to take about 6 hours to
[28:33] stream them out. So they said what's he
[28:36] mean by that? Then they say only if
[28:38] Brandham could have told us that certain
[28:40] people can be saved and we'd accept it
[28:43] but God took them off the scene and you
[28:44] can't find the notes. Therefore you have
[28:46] to accept it through the word of God.
[28:48] Amen. You the prophet will not tell you
[28:51] that this man can be saved or this man
[28:53] can be saved. He preached the word for
[28:56] seeds of God to come to the word of God.
[28:58] You found it now. For he to prove that
[29:01] God does not look at their outward
[29:03] appearance. He looks at the heart. He
[29:06] looks in on the heart. Let us uh gives
[29:09] David's heart. See now as last week
[29:13] there was speaking and the father hit me
[29:15] there. All the men when they were going
[29:18] out to face Goliath was all discussing
[29:21] the reward that Saul was going to give
[29:24] his daughter and so forth that they
[29:25] would face Goliath. Therefore, man was
[29:28] thinking about his own honor, what he
[29:30] was going to get, his own interests.
[29:32] Amen. His own popularity, money, wealth,
[29:36] and so forth, what he would get. See,
[29:38] but not a one of them was thinking about
[29:40] God's honor. Not a one. So therefore,
[29:44] God picked that time to express the
[29:47] heart of God when natural men saved
[29:51] would be looking for their own
[29:53] interests, their own money and hoes,
[29:56] this and that, what they want. See, and
[29:58] not looking on the things of others. At
[30:00] that very time, say 1967, I will express
[30:05] the heart of God. I'll send a dove into
[30:07] these hearts and they will express
[30:09] Christ. And it'll pass right among you.
[30:12] Why not become become the standard? So
[30:14] we find then that David didn't look at
[30:16] that. He just wanted to express God's
[30:19] heart. So now notice the day David come
[30:22] forward for God's honor. See he said who
[30:25] is this uncircumcised Philistine that
[30:27] will defy the living army of God. Other
[30:31] words I mean who do you think you are?
[30:33] There is a living God. These are God's
[30:35] people. Who are you to stand in God's
[30:38] presence when the res of the center
[30:40] shall not stand in the congregation of
[30:42] the saints? Who are you? Can you imagine
[30:45] David here today in these groups across
[30:48] the country where all kind of spirits
[30:50] are rising up? Can you imagine if David
[30:53] wasn't walking there? Who are you
[30:56] hawks? Where you hawks come from to
[30:58] defile the word of God? Where you come
[31:01] from? Who told you to come here and so
[31:03] forth? This one trying to take over the
[31:04] world. This one trying to take over. Who
[31:06] are these hawks? Therefore, what the
[31:08] church need is David's to come forward
[31:10] with the word of God. You follow me now?
[31:12] With that kind of a heart. So, we find
[31:15] then that David was not occupied with
[31:18] the the authority of his life. And to
[31:21] prove that he was
[31:22] genuine, if you say that now, you got to
[31:25] love it. Amen. Finally now. So, he went
[31:27] forward to Saul and said he would go out
[31:30] and fight the lie. Then Saul today that
[31:35] ordained ministry is still there today.
[31:37] Those who were first. See the little
[31:40] Davids on the back side of the desert.
[31:42] They got no claim to fame. They humbled
[31:45] the prophet. They wasn't there and they
[31:47] wasn't here. See they pushed back. Who
[31:50] are they anyway? Should it be Dr. S and
[31:52] so or this big mess over here? Those are
[31:55] all the souls. See me now. Well, I said
[31:58] what is your kind of to see me now?
[32:01] David said his claim of faith was that
[32:03] he delivered the sheep. Is that right?
[32:06] He delivered the sheep from the lion and
[32:10] from the bear. That's my claim of faith.
[32:13] What David's claim of faith be today are
[32:16] with the sheep. That's all. Therefore,
[32:19] he
[32:23] delivered that. Saul had to recognize
[32:27] that God through David delivered the
[32:29] sheep. Amen. right now. Look at the
[32:31] place. Look at the people. Look at the
[32:33] world. You recognize it. There's no
[32:36] interpretation. Are you getting over
[32:39] to that kind of thing,
[32:42] boy? I mean, God gave me the word of God
[32:46] and I came with shepherds, man. And
[32:49] I
[32:54] looked, you understand? No, I don't
[32:56] know. I got so like no I look a certain
[33:02] giant thing I have I give that to God
[33:05] and he did it. Amen. So I look at them
[33:08] as well the secret the same God that
[33:11] delivered the bear to me and the lion
[33:15] shall deliver this uncircumcised
[33:17] Philistine. Amen. Then our
[33:20] attack go out. The devil, he was he was
[33:23] imparted in the land of Canaan. Is that
[33:26] right? There were seven tribes there.
[33:28] But the Philistines were brought in.
[33:30] Amen. We're in the land. The devils are
[33:33] here. The flesh and blood. That right.
[33:36] But Paul said you don't fight against
[33:37] flesh and blood. You fight against power
[33:40] that are in power in the land. Amen. us
[33:44] who come and listen. The devil season
[33:46] and you get tired, you're not going to
[33:48] get up again, son. Just keep on
[33:50] pressing. I don't care how many hops
[33:52] knock you try to preach. God will preach
[33:55] the word of God. Amen. What's your name?
[33:58] Deliver the sheep out of the bear's
[33:59] hands. Deliver the sheep out of the
[34:01] lion's hands and tell it to Saul. And
[34:04] they say that to tell him what you do.
[34:07] That's all I do for the sheep. Amen.
[34:09] That's what you're going to do. Praise
[34:10] the Lord. The sheep. Amen. I know the
[34:13] hopes will knock you down. I know the
[34:15] word say praise God. I know the word
[34:17] will pass right back to you. But you
[34:19] just pass that word right off the
[34:24] shoot that you can kill to get them
[34:26] sheep. He see David who stand these
[34:31] hawks. Amen. Preach the word of God to
[34:33] him. Amen. What we need is Davis today,
[34:36] friends. Praise his name. Amen.
[34:40] So when his ability was questioned, see
[34:42] his ability was questioned. See, he told
[34:45] him in Elijah got the sheep out of Saul.
[34:49] Period. See, so there was a secret. See,
[34:51] so now we find it's the same thing
[34:53] today. Uh Saul then, okay, now you're
[34:56] going to go up. Okay, boy. Okay, now
[34:58] you're going to go up. Now listen, you
[35:00] have to put on my armor. My armor means
[35:03] see so where Saul was at today with the
[35:06] money in a certain position. So when he
[35:08] finally recognized you, he figured it's
[35:10] money or popular said because you must
[35:12] be one of them. See me now. But then
[35:15] David told Saul, he said that I was
[35:17] improved by those.
[35:19] I didn't come through popularity. Amen.
[35:22] I didn't come through the sickness
[35:23] because I'm happy the flesh. No, I
[35:25] didn't come that way. I didn't come
[35:27] through money on the side over here.
[35:29] Amen. I come through preaching the word
[35:31] of
[35:31] God. I still preach the word of God. I
[35:35] still bust the word of God out there. I
[35:37] don't care how many her sit there. I
[35:39] don't care how many sit there. I still
[35:40] preach the word. You follow me now? So
[35:43] if Saul said, "Okay, we'll go ahead."
[35:45] Cuz he so he know what the sheep are. He
[35:47] see the sheep. He see the blessings of
[35:49] God flowing. Therefore, he must go ahead
[35:51] and then he acknowledge it on that and
[35:54] not only not on David only on what he
[35:56] did what God did through him. He'll
[35:58] never accept David can't. Amen. Amen. We
[36:01] understand this now. Praise the Lord. So
[36:03] we find then friends that David says
[36:05] that he don't want any ordinary means.
[36:08] Say with me now human means not by power
[36:11] nor by my but by my spirit saith the
[36:14] Lord. That is the only way. So therefore
[36:16] the word of God was proven to David by
[36:18] the lion and the bear. Now what we have
[36:21] to do just a few minutes more to because
[36:24] keep you here and stress is um I want to
[36:27] drive something home. Okay, now we have
[36:29] to all of us come to 1967 and we know
[36:32] that in the natural there's the Hulk
[36:34] spirit taking over America upon the
[36:37] color people upon the white people.
[36:39] There's going to be a race riots. Blood
[36:40] will run in the streets. But the spirit
[36:43] must come first. Do you see the spirit
[36:44] the hawk straight moving in is in the
[36:46] congress. It's in the government is in
[36:48] the churches is now in the bride groups.
[36:52] that fighting spirit that want to tear
[36:54] down the minister, tear down the sister,
[36:56] tear down the brother. Get on the phone
[36:57] and look the Hulk spirit. Therefore, God
[37:00] said, "Brother, I'll anoint your eyes to
[37:02] see those devils." Amen. Look at them
[37:05] and just turn and don't be afraid of
[37:07] them. Just rebuke him in the name of the
[37:09] Lord and smile and go on. That's all.
[37:12] Praise him. That's all. Just smile and
[37:14] go on. Don't be afraid of spirits. Amen.
[37:15] Just look at them. They can't take over
[37:18] nothing for his chief is dry up is dry.
[37:21] For we know that the spirit of the Lord
[37:24] is love, peace, joy, health is long
[37:28] suffering. That's the spirit of the
[37:29] Lord. Not this fellow dark spirit.
[37:32] Therefore, with the spirit, but the word
[37:34] made manifest. Amen. Therefore, where
[37:37] you find every evilist and mean people
[37:39] and so forth, you find the devil. But
[37:41] you find the little hawks getting their
[37:43] wings clipped in there. That's all
[37:44] right. I mean those little doves rather
[37:46] getting away with that's all right.
[37:47] God's watching over them. He's right
[37:49] with those little doves. Now notice now
[37:52] you say, "But what am I supposed to do?"
[37:55] See, well the shepherd, he always lives
[37:59] in God's hands. He never tried to
[38:01] manufacture no kind of a group, no kind
[38:04] of a work or nothing. God makes it
[38:06] happen all the time. God does it. See,
[38:08] now notice now David when he proved
[38:11] himself. See, the Bible says over in 1st
[38:14] Samuel 22:2, "And everyone that was in
[38:17] distress, everyone that was in debt to
[38:19] Satan." See, everyone that was
[38:22] discontented gathered themselves unto
[38:24] him, David. He didn't come to them. See,
[38:27] they come to him. You follow me? Now, if
[38:29] the mercy must start their way, they
[38:31] come to the they recognize the gift in
[38:34] the man. And here come those who were
[38:36] discontented. When we saw it back in '
[38:38] 62 here, brother Vela, brother TZ and
[38:41] sister Alma and Sylvia, different ones
[38:42] coming and Sister Whitaker and them they
[38:44] were coming. They saw they saw the word
[38:48] not myself. They saw the word of God
[38:50] being made manifest the preaching of the
[38:51] word. Therefore, they were discontent.
[38:53] They were in debt to the enemy. But they
[38:55] come they want to follow that. You
[38:57] follow me? Now later on as David went up
[38:59] when David Saul when when he had
[39:02] defeated him and so forth, David went
[39:03] up, he said, "Lord, where shall I go?
[39:05] brought up to because the because he
[39:07] brought up there and wait I say God gave
[39:10] him a place to go and he waited there
[39:12] then the men of Judah came and made him
[39:14] the king you follow me now they came and
[39:16] made him the king later on he waited
[39:18] until Israel come and made him also then
[39:21] the kingdom was united you follow me now
[39:23] three steps first the people come then
[39:26] they come the church comes then the
[39:27] whole thing comes see God will make you
[39:29] find favor in the sight of your enemies
[39:31] but you must have the faith to stay with
[39:34] it to keep on preaching the word of God.
[39:37] And we find friends that speaking about
[39:39] the right spirit. Just about five more
[39:41] minutes. Um vision is mind say the Lord.
[39:45] Now twice David had Saul. He could have
[39:48] taken him. All right. Now think about
[39:51] the spiritual measures today that would
[39:53] have a witness on something. They tear
[39:55] your head off. Well, God give me a
[39:57] witness. I'm supposed to top his head
[39:58] off. Finally now. Did you get that? See
[40:01] that now? He had saw because cornered
[40:03] twice. that a spiritual man was saying,
[40:06] "Well, the Lord must want me to tell
[40:08] this sister something." Amen. I mean,
[40:11] the Lord must want me to straighten this
[40:13] person out. So, this is twice the thing
[40:15] that's happened now. But David, uh,
[40:17] touch not my anointing. Do my prophets
[40:19] no harm. David was spiritual. He
[40:22] recognized the will of God. And God was
[40:26] discipling him by temptations to take
[40:29] down the throne. Did you get it now?
[40:31] Glory to God. The temptation right there
[40:34] on purpose must come when shimmy kick on
[40:39] David's head off. God has been the door.
[40:42] That's all right. David. So David, you
[40:45] walk in there and those lions are tail.
[40:48] Get up again, David. Go on back and
[40:50] preach the word of God again. Amen.
[40:52] Don't do nothing. Don't be afraid. Don't
[40:54] see to me now. Go back again. God's only
[40:56] testing. That's all he's doing. So twice
[40:58] he had him. He took enough of him to let
[41:01] know that he knew all about him. That's
[41:04] enough. Found me now. So I am enough to
[41:07] say that you know that he knows that you
[41:10] know that
[41:15] you manifest the love. He's in need. You
[41:18] give him an offering. He's sick. You go
[41:21] to pray for him. Amen. Get over me now.
[41:24] See me now. But he knows that you know.
[41:27] See me now. Now then. So he told that
[41:30] the Lord will smite him. See the Lord
[41:32] will smite all the Sauls. And there you
[41:35] see the ministry of Saul today in the
[41:37] message all over. People are confused.
[41:40] One little David here. One little David
[41:42] over there. One little David try to come
[41:43] forth anointed consecrated to God. Those
[41:46] hawks moving their brother and try to
[41:47] smother him out. That's all right David.
[41:49] Keep on punching. Go on David. Keep on
[41:52] punching. Keep on going David. That's
[41:54] exactly right. Amen. God has ordained
[41:57] those hawks to smother you out that he
[41:59] may curse you to bring out the perfume
[42:02] out of the rose. That's all it wants.
[42:04] Perfume out of that rose. Amen. So, we
[42:07] find friends in that David was
[42:09] spiritual. He had Saul twice. He didn't
[42:11] mean nothing. He was looking. He had the
[42:13] heart of God. Every time that's that's
[42:16] God's heart. Amen. Praise the Lord. No
[42:18] matter how many times Saul knocks me
[42:20] down, that's all right. My brother come
[42:23] over here. Brother, I took him into our
[42:24] home, sat down. Could you help him to
[42:27] hear one of my tapes? He didn't tell me.
[42:29] So then he went out said the brother com
[42:31] is not in the message because he don't
[42:32] be in T ministry. If I saw him tomorrow,
[42:36] I throw my arms around. God bless you,
[42:37] brother. Amen. But I give enough of the
[42:39] words and learn. I know where the word
[42:41] sto I know exactly what it means. See,
[42:44] but when these things happen, you don't
[42:45] hate that person. That's all right. Go
[42:47] on, David. See me now. Just go on. See,
[42:50] so now we find also that David had the
[42:53] true spirit. See, he had a humble
[42:55] spirit. He let the dove lead him.
[42:57] Because when
[42:58] Nabal, a wealthy sheep herder, had
[43:01] provoked David by his ill nature because
[43:03] refusal of gifts which have been asked
[43:06] for, David's flesh climbed up on the
[43:09] throne. All right? And David want to
[43:11] kill him. See me now. But now to see if
[43:14] David is humble today, a sister came,
[43:18] sister Abigail. All right. And she
[43:22] called it wisdom. See me now. Now the
[43:25] the
[43:25] the messes and the brothers went all
[43:28] over the country. What? What in the
[43:30] world of God come out of you? Amen. See
[43:32] amen now. But this man had God's heart
[43:36] and he humbled himself to Sister
[43:37] Abigail. All right. And that's that's
[43:40] what the Bible says. And he listened to
[43:42] Sister Abigail's advice. And he said,
[43:46] "Amen." He said, "Blessed be the Lord
[43:49] God of Israel, which has sent thee this
[43:52] day to meet me, and blessed be the
[43:54] advice, and blessed be thou which has
[43:57] kept me this day from shedding blood and
[43:59] avenging myself by my own hand." Amen.
[44:02] God avenged David. Therefore, he said,
[44:05] "The Lord smoked." The Bible said, "The
[44:07] Lord smoked Nabal." See, so but David
[44:10] had a heart to his sisters. He could
[44:12] reach down by the love of God and
[44:15] recognize that the same God in him is in
[44:18] his sister. Amen. And then he can
[44:21] recognize that he's under his sister.
[44:22] He's he is less than her cuz the the
[44:25] ministry is in the feet. You follow me?
[44:27] Now they get under their service of
[44:29] Christ. But this David had this. Now you
[44:31] find this today.
[44:34] is hard to find in the groups because
[44:35] among the brethren they don't want to
[44:37] say a word not that she's supposed to
[44:38] preach anything like yourself but as she
[44:40] does service unto the Lord but God had
[44:42] it there and showed that David went for
[44:44] God's honor he had faith he had love he
[44:47] had love of the sheep that right and he
[44:50] had love and compassion for Saul the
[44:52] majesty today that is tearing up David
[44:54] today me now Saul has lost the anointing
[44:57] he's evil he tried to do David all kind
[44:59] of harm but the Bible David just stepped
[45:02] out of the way So, amen. Just glide out
[45:04] of the way. Went that way. He went this
[45:06] way. He slipped it and went on it out.
[45:10] It says, "Quunch the fiery dots of the
[45:12] enemy." Quench them. Take them in and
[45:16] you die. Mortify the deeds of the body.
[45:18] Amen. That's the Lord. That's all right.
[45:21] Just mind the Lord. See, cuz God's only
[45:24] got a sed heart of David. Amen. Amen.
[45:27] the other sisters, the sheep of God, and
[45:31] his brother that has a forgiving spirit.
[45:34] And if he doesn't love, he'll stretch
[45:36] out before God and repent with the right
[45:38] spirit. Amen. So, we see friends then
[45:41] that the king is invisible, but he gave
[45:44] us a new heart. See, that he might send
[45:47] the Holy Spirit dove into our heart on
[45:49] the wings of a snow white dove. Amen.
[45:51] Now, this new heart obeys God, not with
[45:54] our service. Amen. But from the heart.
[45:56] See that now? Doing the will of God from
[45:59] the heart. You know, um the Orthodox Jew
[46:03] every year at Passover when he worships
[46:06] God, he's so hungry for God. See, he
[46:09] says, "This year, next year, Jerusalem."
[46:12] That's right. See me now. This year
[46:15] here, next year at Jerusalem. See? And
[46:18] no matter where he's living at, what
[46:20] part of the world, he still regards
[46:21] Jerusalem as his city and his home.
[46:24] Amen. So we don't care nothing about
[46:26] here. So you have to worry about us. The
[46:28] modern translation says that we are a
[46:31] colony. See we are colony from the
[46:35] mother country. Amen. And wherever a
[46:38] colony is we have the duties and the
[46:40] privileges. Amen. From the mother
[46:42] country. Amen. And we have security from
[46:46] the mother country also. So we are a
[46:48] colony here of God in this world and
[46:51] they not run by demons but God will back
[46:54] it up by his word but we have all of his
[46:56] privilege right here find it out right
[46:58] here in the word of God. See me now and
[47:01] we cry out Lord this day here tonight or
[47:05] the next instant into the resurrection.
[47:08] We are looking for the resurrection
[47:10] friends. This was down in God's people's
[47:12] hearts. So we find the day friends in
[47:15] closing
[47:17] um tired that um the the spare of the
[47:22] hawk believe me is moving into the
[47:26] groups is already there. It's going to
[47:28] take over one or the other. Choose you
[47:31] this day what side you going to be on.
[47:33] Whether you going to let the the hulk
[47:35] rule the roots or whether you going to
[47:37] let the dove rule your heart, it's up to
[47:40] you. See? And then when you see what's
[47:42] made manifest, then you don't have to
[47:44] tell them about you and the bride.
[47:46] They'll see it. Amen. See me now. Then
[47:49] the brethren will love the sisters. The
[47:51] sisters, they'll love the brothers.
[47:53] Wives love their husbands. Be in
[47:54] obedience and so forth. The husbands
[47:56] dwell with them with knowledge and love
[47:58] them and so forth and not looking down
[48:01] on one another. Then when Christ comes
[48:04] and finds the eagles eating that kind of
[48:06] a food, amen. When they eat that kind of
[48:09] a food, see me now. then he'll come
[48:11] right there with them. That's where
[48:13] you're finding me right there. So, you
[48:14] don't have to be in a certain group or
[48:16] certain place. You have to be in Christ
[48:18] the word. Amen. You follow me now? And
[48:21] manifesting the spirit of David, which
[48:24] we know is the spirit of God. So, God
[48:27] will smite the enemy. God will fight
[48:30] your battles. For he cut off, brother
[48:32] Bam's every enemy. Cut him off. He just
[48:35] went on like a dove. That right? Like a
[48:37] lamb of God. But the hardest thing for
[48:40] us is to keep on. We have to have the
[48:43] last word. Father man, we just got to
[48:45] say it. See? So if we can only humble
[48:48] ourselves. You see what I mean now? And
[48:50] just be Christlike. And this year, I
[48:53] myself, I believe something is fixing to
[48:56] take place. If not this year, next year.
[48:59] Amen. Not next year, then next year. I
[49:02] ain't got no time, no date on God for
[49:05] you can't date God. He's the same
[49:07] yesterday, today, and forever. But I
[49:09] know the heavens speak of it, the earth
[49:11] speaks of it, the world speaks of it.
[49:13] That's three. It's a witness. The
[49:15] prophet has proclaimed it. He's gone off
[49:17] the scene 12 months now. Esther was was
[49:20] purified for for about 12 months. Found
[49:23] enough. He's gone off the scene.
[49:25] Something is fixing to happen. But the
[49:28] real we approach this
[49:30] 1967 6 and 7 is 13. America's number.
[49:35] Everything is in order. The race riders
[49:37] are ready. The angel of the beast is
[49:38] ready. All things are ready. The
[49:41] mechanics have been set in order. And
[49:43] the same time that the mechanic was set
[49:45] in order, God sent a mechanic of his
[49:48] word. The prophet restored the word of
[49:50] God. And that mechanical word is here
[49:53] now washing us and cleansing us by the
[49:55] water of it. Amen. that those eagles
[49:59] have taken the mechanics of the word and
[50:01] they're waiting for the dynamics to fall
[50:03] into their hearts just waiting for the
[50:06] God to come down on the wings of a snow
[50:08] white dove. Then if you understood the
[50:11] prophet's message in ' 65 he said to all
[50:14] of us she said way across the country
[50:16] open up your heart and repent let the
[50:18] dove come into your heart and lead you.
[50:21] We're eagles but the eagle is a fierce
[50:23] bird. Amen. So let the dove lead you.
[50:26] All right? Cuz the eagles fly high and
[50:30] fly and swoop down and strike the snakes
[50:32] up on a rock. They strike those
[50:34] serpents. All right. But however, always
[50:37] let the dove lead you. And we see David,
[50:40] his claim to fame was he went for the
[50:42] sheep. Amen. When he come to face that
[50:45] trial, to me, you could type it. It was
[50:48] a 40-day time when s when Goliath walked
[50:51] up and down before the church, Israel
[50:53] and Saul, they were not clean before the
[50:56] Lord. They couldn't do nothing. So David
[50:59] could come in the name of the Lord, for
[51:01] the name of the Lord is the word of God.
[51:03] So therefore, those who have taken the
[51:05] word of God can go forth in the
[51:07] resurrection in the name of the Lord.
[51:09] And then when that great press, the
[51:12] props that would come, that Goliath
[51:14] press, that last one against the bride
[51:17] to smash it, you watch the power of God
[51:19] floating in when she moves in. And we
[51:21] find even just here about two weeks ago
[51:24] that they want to stop nurses from going
[51:27] into prisons and hospitals unless they
[51:30] belong to the National Catholic
[51:31] Churches. Let's come on radio. So we can
[51:34] see all these things are ready. And you
[51:36] cannot build a church in no particular
[51:38] area unless you check with them first.
[51:40] This has just come just about two weeks
[51:41] ago. So we find friends that the
[51:44] mechanics is ready. God's mechanics is
[51:48] ready. Should have been there now
[51:49] because if the the mechanics of Satan
[51:51] come forth and the word wasn't here and
[51:53] we had a Pentecostal message, you
[51:54] couldn't defeat the devil. Because you
[51:56] might go out and try to speak in
[51:57] tongues. You follow me now? But got the
[52:00] word. And that may come to pass. It may
[52:02] not come to pass. See me now. that this
[52:05] shall never fail. It will always come to
[52:08] pass. It is the word of God. The living
[52:10] going to abide forever. Therefore, God
[52:13] is always on time. He saw the end of the
[52:16] world coming. He saw the the enemy move
[52:18] like a flood. So, he come with his
[52:20] prophet to bring out the word first to
[52:22] purge and clean and also pull out one
[52:24] here, two over there. Get them all
[52:26] ready. given to a place where the Holy
[52:28] Spirit could manifest in their lives and
[52:30] show them these things and let them know
[52:32] and exalt them to be ready for the day
[52:34] of the Lord. For the day of the Lord is
[52:36] coming is come with the voice of the
[52:38] archangel. The resurrection will be on
[52:41] that night. I was just because reading
[52:43] there Paul here and speaking about every
[52:45] man's arm. There's a little thing which
[52:47] I read there that is it's like the uh
[52:50] because the army built back somewhere
[52:52] all the troops be laying on the ground
[52:54] sleeping. They have some men on guard
[52:56] who are watching and waiting. The
[52:58] general move on the scene 12:00 at night
[53:01] in the morning and says, "Get up and get
[53:02] ready out of here." They blow forth the
[53:04] trumpet. The men hop up. Every man gets
[53:06] and shows their arms. Amen. But the
[53:09] first command go forth. They rise from
[53:11] sleeping up off the ground and get up
[53:14] and show their arms. Therefore, the
[53:15] command has come forth for us to work
[53:17] from sleeping. Amen. For the time is
[53:20] here. It's here now. And we allow to
[53:24] show you the word. Put it on the
[53:26] shoulder first. Amen. And we're going to
[53:29] have and then the next verse you hear
[53:31] will be the voice of God. Amen. The word
[53:34] of God which is the message of God. A
[53:35] message must come by verse. Amen. And he
[53:39] said there's a message coming forth
[53:41] which will be the voice of God. Amen.
[53:43] That's very simple, isn't it? Not a
[53:45] different message. It's God said in the
[53:48] for the prophet said that the son of man
[53:50] will be on the earth. Is that right? And
[53:52] they would be running around with white
[53:53] horse rattles where it's supposed to be
[53:55] this over here and test over there. He
[53:57] said, "Well, Elijah has already come.
[53:59] You didn't know it in 63."
[54:01] Amen. But the eagles are made ready. The
[54:04] doves. Amen. Dark spirits ruin the
[54:07] roofs. Amen. And the hulks are all
[54:10] poisons in the natural trying to stick
[54:12] in dub feathers, but they can't. And the
[54:14] hulks are all about genealogies. Where
[54:17] this come from? I mean I was in New York
[54:19] and this place over there where have you
[54:21] was a horse but God's people is the
[54:24] heart one heart one soul one mind all
[54:27] flesh all kinds of flesh but one heart
[54:31] and I give them a blood test all we let
[54:33] them manifest what's in their hearts let
[54:35] them talk about let them sit out
[54:37] everything and then they'll and then
[54:39] they'll stand in the day of judgment
[54:41] when I bring it back to the ears how
[54:42] they spoke against my dogs how they
[54:46] bring it back to them
[54:47] But in the resurrection, I'll bring up
[54:49] the doves who've been humble, meek,
[54:52] loving everybody. Amen. Just like David,
[54:55] loving the sisters, loving the brethren,
[54:57] forgiving Saul. Amen. Though you could
[54:59] have killed him the second time, he
[55:01] could have taken his head off. Amen. But
[55:03] give him a break for God did. Let him
[55:06] alone. Touch not my do my prophets no
[55:08] harm. See me now. The best thing that we
[55:11] can do as we approach this year now,
[55:12] friends, is to be rever before God. We
[55:15] believe that something's fixing to
[55:17] happen. God's given us a place here now.
[55:19] Changed it over. Got rid of a few
[55:21] blemishes and so forth which are on the
[55:23] walls. See type of because of natural
[55:26] these blemishes we want because they be
[55:28] gone. Is that right? We don't want them
[55:30] here. The words that they will not be
[55:31] here. See amen now. For he doesn't look
[55:33] at them. See, but he washes them away.
[55:36] Follow me now. Doesn't come into his
[55:38] mind. It's not even not even in God's
[55:40] mind.
[55:42] You are now see right now present now
[55:45] are you the sons of God right now.
[55:47] You're not going to be then you being
[55:49] manifest then. But you're now the sons
[55:51] of God. And the time that we believe her
[55:54] and hang on to them. We're seeing God
[55:57] manifest the heart of God in her. This
[55:59] is the one who the patience. She waited.
[56:02] Her husband couldn't want to come and
[56:04] serve the Lord. Well, she waited on God.
[56:06] She's sitting every Sunday. We see
[56:08] because it's the carry back here. faith
[56:10] in God, believing there she sits there.
[56:12] We see God God manifest through good
[56:14] works here through all kind of things in
[56:16] the assembly here all kind of people
[56:19] bring them all together for a purpose
[56:21] for to give a witness for God. For
[56:23] here's the witness, friends. If you want
[56:25] to understand what it is, is it is this
[56:27] here? God says I'm love. I love all
[56:30] people. What in the world I've seen
[56:33] Asian America, I can't find a group who
[56:35] will not be because they discriminate.
[56:38] But I'll find a people in a filthy place
[56:40] that will not discriminate. And I put
[56:43] give them a new heart and I'll give them
[56:45] a new spirit, not the old dirty spirit
[56:47] from the world which is discriminating.
[56:49] But I give them a new spirit and a new
[56:52] heart. There will be those from all
[56:54] different places. They'll come and
[56:55] they'll see Christ. They'll see the
[56:58] heart of God manifested. They see God
[57:01] moving a body living in his very
[57:04] existence. So God who is love a great
[57:08] big boy wants to exist somewhere. He
[57:10] wants to know everybody but he can't
[57:12] find a channel to move through. But
[57:14] thanks be to God he's found a channel
[57:17] here. And he's looking for a corporate
[57:20] group that he can move through which
[57:23] suggested but thanks be to God. these
[57:26] power different colors that he can move
[57:28] through and he can prove to this
[57:31] discouraging king spirit this hot spirit
[57:34] I said this man is see the serpent this
[57:36] is black he can't be saved this man is
[57:38] so forth so I'll show you you heart you
[57:41] I'll show you that is not flesh I'll
[57:44] show you sex or whatever you are no
[57:47] difference of wherever you are is
[57:49] whether your heart is pure or your heart
[57:51] is clean if you look at two so Is the
[57:55] word of God coming forth? I don't try to
[57:58] figure it out. That's all. Hear the word
[58:00] of God. Believe the word of God. God
[58:03] don't care what you think. He never did.
[58:06] So whether you not
[58:10] because that's all you are. God don't
[58:12] care nothing what we think whatsoever.
[58:16] God just loves to move and tear
[58:18] everything. Amen. tear your lust and you
[58:24] easily against God and tear that thing
[58:27] and they rip it apart. Amen. And I'll
[58:29] put it back together the way I want to
[58:31] do it. And you'll see some people
[58:32] washing clean from their own natural
[58:34] ways, what they think, genealogies, this
[58:36] and that. And I'll bring the shepherds,
[58:39] they have a bag full of honey, go rough
[58:40] on it. Amen. And they after they claim
[58:43] the fame, they'll figure that out. They
[58:47] step our songs. We get them off and over
[58:49] here. Step over there over there.
[58:51] Finally now. But their lips are all
[58:53] going still trying to get me now. They
[58:57] pray on the heart. That's all. Amen.
[58:59] When that devil moves in, pray on your
[59:02] heart. When that discriminating spirit
[59:04] in America moves in, pour on your heart.
[59:08] For you recognize the spirit come from
[59:09] Cain. Amen. He discriminated against his
[59:12] brother Abel. There's the seed right
[59:15] there. It it must be manifested in the
[59:17] end age. So then when
[59:20] people when race will hate
[59:23] race by the time is prophesied to come,
[59:27] God deliberately takes that time to show
[59:31] the love of God to prove the word of God
[59:35] to show the lambs that have the word of
[59:38] God in it that the manifest Christ
[59:40] against
[59:42] all. Amen.
[59:45] what the family says, what the thinking
[59:48] say, what the say, what good say,
[59:50] but the word the word of God. God don't
[59:53] care what the muffin say, what the clan
[59:55] say, what Johnson says. It's what that
[59:58] word says. And the prophet of God preach
[1:00:00] the word of God. I thank God for the
[1:00:03] opportunity to stand up there and to
[1:00:05] proclaim the gospel of God. No matter if
[1:00:07] I go out here tonight, friends, I want
[1:00:09] to have a testimony that I have not
[1:00:12] shunned to declare the whole the whole
[1:00:14] gospel of Christ for these four years.
[1:00:16] As I enter into the fifth year, I want
[1:00:18] to rededicate my life to the preaching
[1:00:21] of the word through the living of the
[1:00:22] sheep to do all that I can for Christ.
[1:00:26] And I don't want to look at my brother's
[1:00:27] faults. No, sorry. For there'll be a
[1:00:30] hawk spirit blasting down my brother.
[1:00:33] Then if God can find two in Connecticut,
[1:00:36] three over here, did you hear what I
[1:00:37] said? Amen. Five in Connecticut, three
[1:00:40] over there, and so forth. See, he can
[1:00:42] find two there, one over there. He said,
[1:00:44] then he'll take that those few. That's
[1:00:46] all. I'll take one and I'll leave one.
[1:00:48] There'll be two in the bed, I'll take
[1:00:49] one, I'll leave one. Two sleeping, I'll
[1:00:51] take one and I'll leave one. Two in the
[1:00:52] field, I'll take one, I'll leave one.
[1:00:53] But practice that. So it'll be on that
[1:00:55] rise. And when he does that, the hawks
[1:00:58] be standing out looking at themselves,
[1:00:59] the nice skin and flesh and everything.
[1:01:00] Think because they're beautiful. And the
[1:01:02] the the sheep will be this humble and
[1:01:04] thinking nothing and then the Holy
[1:01:06] Spirit will just flutter down into the
[1:01:08] sheep's hearts. My Amen. And how will he
[1:01:12] come on the wings of a snow white dot?
[1:01:15] Amen. I feel good this morning. Can you
[1:01:18] sing with me this morning? Do you want
[1:01:20] the Holy Spirit to come out of 67 and
[1:01:23] flow into your hearts on the wings of a
[1:01:26] snow white dot? Hey, let's sing a song.

[1:05:04] Perry Green and sister Coleman and
[1:05:05] sister Sylvia May wrote out in Arizona.
[1:05:08] Now the prophet has
[1:05:11] left
[1:05:12] us but he showed us the way.
[1:05:18] He said look unto
[1:05:24] Jesus
[1:05:27] today for Jesus has
[1:05:32] promise God from the death of his
[1:05:37] life to send us

[1:06:16] his sweet
[1:06:20] love
[1:06:23] from on the wings of
[1:06:27] the last verse is beautiful. Now the
[1:06:30] prophet has
[1:06:32] left
[1:06:34] us for he showed us the way.
[1:06:39] He said, "Look to
[1:06:43] Jesus." Oh, from day to
[1:06:48] day. For Jesus has
[1:06:53] promised from the depth of his
[1:06:58] love to send us
[1:07:06] aside. Everybody one more time. All the
[1:07:09] wings of the
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:27] star. Praise his
[1:07:31] name. Amen. Praise his name.
[1:07:38] Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:42] Praise this wonderful name. Well,
[1:07:46] friends, that's our beginning of
[1:07:49] 1967. Little chopped up message, but we
[1:07:52] pray to God that it got home to some
[1:07:54] heart. And we know that the God sent the
[1:07:59] sign, the prophet. He showed the life of
[1:08:02] Christ. He showed us the way. That was
[1:08:04] the way. not knowing the scriptures and
[1:08:06] having all the tapes. But he showed us
[1:08:09] the way to Calvary, picking up your
[1:08:11] cross and following Christ in the
[1:08:14] prophet who loved all man. Amen. Loved
[1:08:18] everybody. People come with all kind of
[1:08:20] crazy things. He just forbade with put
[1:08:23] up with it. Amen. Now he showed us the
[1:08:25] way. Can we purpose in our heart for 67
[1:08:28] and move forward as we see in the
[1:08:31] natural the Hulk spirit moving in in
[1:08:33] America like a flood. Amen. The Catholic
[1:08:35] sign has gone forth. Mary and Jesus on
[1:08:38] the postage stamp. The dove is the sign
[1:08:40] all over in the natural. And also eagles
[1:08:43] are all over everywhere. This country
[1:08:45] started with the eagle. It's going out
[1:08:46] with an eagle. Is that right? See me
[1:08:48] now? But it's the golden eagle, not the
[1:08:50] bald eagle, but the bald eagle is a
[1:08:52] scavenger. The brown eagle covers up his
[1:08:55] nest with the old bones and ferns and
[1:08:57] everything. But that golden eagle keeps
[1:08:59] his nest clean. Amen. So keep your nest
[1:09:02] clean, friends. Keep the roofs clean.
[1:09:04] Amen. And let the dirt fly into the
[1:09:07] roofs and let God dwell in your
[1:09:10] tabernacle. Then all these different
[1:09:12] tabernacles come into this one place.
[1:09:15] See to me now such an anointing comes
[1:09:17] down where we can just praise God and
[1:09:19] walk up and down the floor and shout and
[1:09:21] bless his name. Amen. We just keep it
[1:09:23] clean and we dedicate it to the
[1:09:25] preaching of the word and we just go
[1:09:27] from day to day. From day to day. That's
[1:09:29] all. And he point us to Jesus. Brother
[1:09:31] Brand didn't point us to a tent, to a
[1:09:34] white horse rider. He didn't point us to
[1:09:35] a place. He pointed us to Christ. I can
[1:09:38] pick up any tape and prove it. He said,
[1:09:40] "Don't change the tape." Say what the
[1:09:42] tape said. Amen. Don't ever change the
[1:09:44] tape. So, he pointed to the word of God.
[1:09:46] We have the opportunity now to move into
[1:09:48] 67 with a heart purge and clean in the
[1:09:50] right attitude and the right frame of
[1:09:52] mind. Amen. To let the dove fly into a
[1:09:55] new heart and a new spirit. For God
[1:09:57] gives a new spirit to receive the Holy
[1:10:00] Spirit. The prophet said so we have a
[1:10:03] new spirit now which is changed from the
[1:10:05] world and that we might receive the
[1:10:08] fullness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:10] Ghost. The fullness I said there are
[1:10:12] those here with the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:14] Spirit of course but there's a fullness
[1:10:15] coming which is a dove himself to walk
[1:10:18] in that tabernacle and dwell in there
[1:10:20] and live in there and move and have his
[1:10:23] very existence in you. Then if that's
[1:10:26] God that ain't no horn, it's a dove.
[1:10:29] Amen. Then if you go back to your group,
[1:10:32] sit down, wait till the sun come up and
[1:10:34] then the sun manifests itself the word
[1:10:36] and you see the hawks fighting and
[1:10:38] scratching and so forth, just say,
[1:10:40] "Well, just pray for them." Amen. Be
[1:10:42] sweet and humble and go on. If God had
[1:10:45] laid something up on your heart, you
[1:10:46] want this to happen, that to happen, do
[1:10:48] it. Have faith and do it. Don't care
[1:10:50] what the horn say. Go and do it anyway.
[1:10:52] Amen. You'll see a God and he'll bless
[1:10:55] that. See? Amen. Now, if God wants a
[1:10:57] certain thing, you got to have faith to
[1:10:59] do it. And the hawks going to Now, when
[1:11:01] you see the hawks fighting, then you
[1:11:03] know it's God's will. That's right. When
[1:11:06] those hawks scratch and fight, see when
[1:11:09] David moves in and the hawks just stir
[1:11:11] up a a ruckus. See amen now? Well, then
[1:11:14] the dove sit right there with faith
[1:11:15] praying, waiting on God. Amen. And God
[1:11:18] sends the God anointed, God- sent
[1:11:21] leader. Amen. And he has a claim to
[1:11:23] fame. He always gets the sheep all the
[1:11:25] time. Get him out of the bear's hand,
[1:11:26] the lion's hand. Amen. He always gets
[1:11:29] the sheep. For he don't have to say who
[1:11:31] I am when you got a bang hang on his
[1:11:33] side. Amen. There's a rock with is full
[1:11:37] of honey over it. And the sheep, they
[1:11:40] know what's in that bag. Amen. They say,
[1:11:43] "I want what's in that bag." I don't
[1:11:46] know about you so much, but what's in
[1:11:47] the bag? Amen. You know, when you hear
[1:11:51] that the man, what's in the man's bag?
[1:11:55] Amen. Then if you get what's in the bag,
[1:11:58] you won't reverence the man and all the
[1:12:00] love. See, forget what that honey in
[1:12:03] that bag. Amen. See, and look at his
[1:12:06] good. Taste the Lord. He is delicious.
[1:12:09] Amen. We thank God this morning for all
[1:12:12] our friends to be here. And we want to
[1:12:14] wish you the that the best for the this
[1:12:17] coming year in this sense that may we if
[1:12:20] we don't be here or somewhere else may
[1:12:22] we meet you in the resurrection. That's
[1:12:24] my sincere prayer and desire. May every
[1:12:26] person in here may the dove flutter into
[1:12:29] his heart. Amen. Say now may the dove of
[1:12:31] God is flutter in there. But the only
[1:12:34] way he can come in there he showed us
[1:12:36] the way. Humble dead loving forgiving.
[1:12:40] See that's the only way. He won't come
[1:12:42] no other way. And that's the word of the
[1:12:44] Lord. You see that God will that word.
[1:12:45] Amen. And sit still and watch the horses
[1:12:48] raise up us. Seemen now they got you.
[1:12:51] But God got to pull off the cover. It's
[1:12:52] harvest season. Shall we stand?
