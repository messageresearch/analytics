[8:16] he'd asked me to come and I said well
[8:19] I'm coming and then see and I'm here I
[8:23] was on my way for all time
[8:26] Here I am
[8:27] therefore I keep my word breathe a lot a
[8:29] long time getting here but nevertheless
[8:32] I'm near and fit the whole night we
[8:34] spent happy to be here and I really
[8:37] appreciate brother Jack and his gallant
[8:40] stand and how I was rejoicing as he was
[8:43] giving me somewhat of a testimony and
[8:46] when you tell me by the trials I was
[8:49] rejoicing about it crowds and temptation
[8:52] for count of joy when you fall into
[8:54] divers temptations now not like crazy
[8:58] joy just laughing at somebody but the
[9:00] kind of joy that God would permit us to
[9:03] suffer for him knowing that God that
[9:07] what is in the fires Perez will bring us
[9:09] out and not one here will be sin always
[9:12] be a smell of the fire and then in the
[9:15] fire will have a greater presence of God
[9:18] from one like the Son of God will be in
[9:20] the fire so in order to feel his real
[9:23] deep presence of the God we have to get
[9:25] in the fire but why are you afraid of
[9:27] the trials and temptations the Lord or
[9:31] what I want it to be let it be
[9:33] Amen enfold just this is the kind of
[9:36] place we're gonna have to hear now I
[9:39] always call it but if not think like DC
[9:42] when Hebrew boy is headed that kind of
[9:44] thing if our God don't deliver us our
[9:47] favor many times but I know that he will
[9:50] deliver you I'll never leave you nor

[10:08] give us the correct countdown for our
[10:12] age and knit our souls together in love
[10:16] divine wouldn't it be a wonderful thing
[10:20] if God could just sleep down here
[10:22] tonight with a love desire and pick us
[10:26] up into happen offense all praise God
[10:30] what happened failed love or we can have
[10:32] tonight and we could just believe all
[10:36] things are possible to them that believe
[10:38] you know people don't know who they are
[10:41] yes sir the devil tries to make them
[10:44] wait for some great unknown name
[10:46] something way out there and the honest
[10:49] one we're yet to come see before they
[10:51] can take up their rightful position in
[10:53] Christ but I say that you don't have to
[10:55] wait for anything you can have it
[10:57] tonight
[10:58] Amen this now are we the sons of God now
[11:02] is present tense the present tense

[11:30] difference

[11:50] freeze gone yes birth in so it's going
[11:53] down motion tell them I am
[11:55] and I will be what I will be according
[11:59] to their needs and therefore God is

[12:46] promises how to write down through the
[12:48] ages that he is the same yesterday today
[12:50] and forever have something to be senior
[12:53] a little odd message tonight bring
[12:59] recognizing all day and it's mrs.
[13:01] thought I might lean see tonight on page
[13:05] 38 paragraph 192 the church has not
[13:10] recognized her day like Israel Mex in
[13:13] her promised land you don't know how she
[13:15] got back there he was this automatically
[13:19] foot back there
[13:22] why national force put her in her place
[13:26] and I want to say something national for
[13:29] for what Israel in a homeland national
[13:33] force will put the church in the World
[13:35] Council of Churches excuse me but the
[13:38] power of God will put the people in the
[13:41] Bronx the world forces this way and the
[13:45] world forces that way but God forces
[13:48] uplift the straight of God which is the
[13:51] word of God my word is spirit and life
[13:55] will put the bride in her place
[13:59] so she'll recognize her position in the
[14:01] word and then she's been crying oh my
[14:05] read that again up by the conference
[14:08] praise God oh gosh what is up with the
[14:12] Spirit of God which is no word of God my
[14:15] word is spirit of life we'll put the
[14:17] bride in her place
[14:18] cause she'll recognize her position in
[14:20] the word then she's been crying we'll
[14:23] put her in a place no national force
[14:25] will do it but the national sport would
[14:28] drive Israel to the homeland national
[14:31] portion of the world of the castle
[14:32] churches will drop any organization into
[14:35] it but the power of God will raise the
[14:37] bride into glory oh my what a tremendous
[14:41] promise here of spirit porking words
[14:43] that is vindicated and living tonight be
[14:47] with Laban friends I believe it all my
[14:50] heart
[14:51] and here we have this message in earthen
[14:54] vessels you have the king's message you
[14:57] can say get away Satan amen well we have
[15:00] the message of God we want to go on into
[15:02] the resurrection now on tonight let us
[15:06] recognize that we haven't all here
[15:09] together
[15:10] together for the sound of the trumpet
[15:12] that's what's all about being called it
[15:15] here we are a human mortal nobody
[15:19] and yet God before the foundation of the
[15:22] world knew who we were and knew what
[15:25] kind of a condition we were in and yet
[15:28] in love and mercy he has gathered us
[15:30] here around this refreshed killed toxic
[15:34] meets of the entire message for the
[15:37] sounding of the trumpet and we already
[15:40] being raptured went down there and we

[16:17] in the people may be unfair because I
[16:20] can't live it and I did this yesterday
[16:22] and it happened that won't happen
[16:23] tomorrow right there but perfect love
[16:26] casts out all there for we here to cast

[25:39] chipper walking in the world of them oh
[25:42] is that your desire and I think well
[25:45] please done well let's turn to the Word
[25:48] of God now we talked a little bit and I
[25:50] want to strike the word Amen we feel
[25:53] settled down tonight as always that
[25:55] suggests the continuation of these
[25:58] Georgia meetings right here tonight
[25:59] raise the world we stop off holding him
[26:01] in my Freeport we many and now we're
[26:05] here tonight now tonight have a Sussex I
[26:10] imagine it which that's very
[26:12] controversial to many people
[26:14] what is not to me and I don't believe it
[26:17] to you because something as your pastor
[26:20] has preached here for all these years
[26:21] here which isn't heaven from the voices
[26:23] and so therefore home raptured Saints
[26:28] lays in the seven thunders and this
[26:31] message itself is the seventh from the
[26:34] mystic and the Prophet was to reveal all
[26:38] mysteries for wraps and faith and he
[26:42] revealed it he put on the tape and in
[26:45] the right season already have evil
[26:47] pastor or they are to fly like Eagles
[26:51] and go up into the funders and not be
[26:53] afraid he's able to put people from
[26:55] falling and bring it right over back up
[26:57] an egg anything and get those traumas
[27:00] and bring them down to the shoes now
[27:02] that's viable amen
[27:04] but therefore like I'm saying this is
[27:08] something that we've been doing in New
[27:09] York and I've been doing here for all
[27:11] these years but tonight I just want to
[27:14] speak on it clinging tonight the things
[27:16] that we preach in the off the year
[27:18] because we are we were supposed to take
[27:20] those parameters of God and screeching
[27:22] teeth and
[27:23] so our hope is not strain'd to anybody
[27:25] but that's why tonight in approaching
[27:29] this subject and I realized that he's in
[27:31] a statement finish the third role and
[27:34] seven thunders and Malachi Floyd's
[27:38] poking at it for cooking these potion or
[27:41] this was the devil should get a hold of
[27:43] it he could do great damage people
[27:46] impersonators please but he can't know
[27:49] him well it is the woman count me and he
[27:52] cannot impersonate the word you can
[27:55] because imperfectly dismount but not the
[27:56] word and that's why I'm so happy that
[28:00] God did it this way but then I know who
[28:03] I am
[28:04] Amen think for now I want to read from
[28:06] second Peter warrant to first chapter
[28:08] verse 1 through 12 and brother Jack and
[28:12] brother Barney has given me a complete
[28:15] Liberty and he tells me they what's on
[28:18] your heart the only thing that I can say
[28:20] is a seventh from the Methodist nota let
[28:22] me tell you if I have to creep up on my
[28:25] hunt 2nd Peter the first chapter verse 1
[28:31] through 12 and revelation the tenth

[28:38] you have the time
[28:39] yes buzz that I once hit my time and
[28:42] want to lay in from the book of
[28:44] Revelation here and see what little Holy
[28:47] Spirit has for us tonight

[29:35] purchase stress all the time whereby are
[29:39] given unto us exceeding great and
[29:42] precious promises that by deed he might

[37:27] why there was no activity in heaven it
[37:30] might give way to secret
[37:31] do you see it now in his home great they
[37:34] must be included because it's got to
[37:37] happen but when the seven thunders

[38:36] of thunders and seven angels appear that
[38:38] right one burst of thunder seven angels
[38:42] appeared and I saw the land winning here

[38:46] wise a voice of thunder and one of the
[38:49] four beasts it coming see notice one
[38:51] Thunder seven messages that's been
[38:55] sealed up and cannot be reveal until the
[38:57] last day at this age see what I mean

[39:06] of town for home and it was seven angels
[39:08] and then he went to Arizona a month or
[39:11] two later and then he was picked up into
[39:14] the concrete from seven or angels but
[39:16] one blast went off there was the one
[39:19] blast off in the rooms there was a one
[39:21] blast off in Arizona there was the one
[39:23] blast in the Bible one son of seven
[39:26] angels seven messages a man just put it
[39:29] in the Bible is his right amen and then
[39:32] the D seventh angel himself the one with
[39:36] the swept-back wings very notable he
[39:39] comes down on the earth and sun is out
[39:42] seven thunders this well there was one
[39:44] thunder seven angels seven messages in

[39:52] thunders out seven thunders all my
[39:57] Western Aero days 37 36 I'll stop there
[40:04] the bottom of the page and did you know
[40:06] that one angel I sit in there for the
[40:08] strange angel
[40:09] look more like to me than any of the
[40:11] rest of them do you remember that we
[40:13] read a constellation three on one side a
[40:15] long top and the one right next to me
[40:18] here counting from left to right would
[40:21] have been the 17 so he was brighter
[40:23] meant more to me than the rest of them
[40:26] you remember I said he had his chest out
[40:28] like that and with flying East would
[40:30] remember that I said it picked me up
[40:32] lifting me up
[40:33] remember that well there it is the one
[40:35] with the Seventh Seal the thing that I
[40:38] wanted all my life amen them other seals
[40:41] meant a lot to me of course but you
[40:44] don't know what just has meant well one
[40:46] time in life I prayed I cried out to God
[40:49] after that Phoenix meeting any of the
[40:51] people they ripped me no I laid in the
[40:53] mound one morning got up and went up and
[40:55] interred in the canyon great rugged high
[40:57] mountain and I went up there and there
[40:59] with a little foot trail after that and
[41:01] you go along speaking about how you
[41:02] delve into this mountain up there and
[41:05] cannot wanna a distance there's seven
[41:07] thunders here where he mentions these
[41:10] seven thunders on page 40 days 40
[41:16] paragraph 2 is in Sabine you came he
[41:18] said this is the third hole and there's
[41:20] three great things that goes with it and
[41:22] one on for today or yesterday the other
[41:25] one for today and there's one thing that
[41:29] I can't in Curtin says it's in an
[41:30] unknown language as I stand right hit
[41:33] there and you look right edit and then
[41:35] this is the third hole coming up and the
[41:38] Holy Spirit of God oh my there's a
[41:40] reason
[41:40] without it now I better stop right here
[41:43] see I just feel sick not to think no
[41:46] more about it
[41:47] thief we'll just remember that Seventh
[41:49] Seal the reason it was not open the
[41:53] reason he did not reveal it no one
[41:55] should know about it and I want you to
[41:57] know before I even know any word about
[42:00] that that that vision come years ago do
[42:04] you remember that and here it is just as
[42:07] the other hand slide straight slides
[42:11] right straight into the word exactly
[42:13] where it was and God knows my heart I
[42:15] never one time whatever thing is
[42:17] that and here it was just later than we
[42:20] think oh my just children from God with
[42:23] these it fits exactly in the promises of
[42:27] God from the end of the message you
[42:31] notice from the end of from the end of
[42:35] time message this seal after all he's
[42:38] reveal all the sick seals what it don't
[42:39] say nothing about the seven and the in
[42:42] time seal when it starts will be
[42:45] absolutely a total secret and remember
[42:49] al eight to ten one seven all the
[42:51] mysteries of God would be known we at
[42:53] the end time the opening of the Senate
[42:55] field Mainichi here on page 43 here
[43:01] now notice will help me by god I'll tell
[43:04] the truth that these are 30 designed the
[43:07] knees you learn by the Holy Spirit and
[43:10] by every one of them has identified a
[43:12] place in the Bible
[43:13] now what did great secret is that
[43:15] releases this seal I do not know I don't
[43:19] know it I couldn't make it out I
[43:20] couldn't tell it just what it said but I
[43:23] know he was that it was them seven
[43:25] sudden autumn himself right close
[43:27] together
[43:28] banging seven different times and it
[43:32] unfolded into something else that I had
[43:34] changed wouldn't use me now mind you
[43:36] he's already on Vail I'll reveal six
[43:40] seals so now here is the seventh seal in
[43:43] waiting around here that if you did not
[43:46] reveal the seven thunders but he had
[43:48] revealed sixteen years but we understand
[43:51] what we're talking about then when I've
[43:53] seen that I look for the interpretation
[43:55] that flew across there and I couldn't
[43:58] make it out that's exactly right
[44:00] see the hour isn't quite quite yet for
[44:03] it but it's moving into that cycle T is
[44:05] coming up close for the thing for you to
[44:08] do is is remember I stick you in the
[44:10] name of the Lord
[44:11] beat up here well you don't know that
[44:14] something can happen
[44:15] amen page just about five minutes more
[44:19] and we move on but I have to lay in this
[44:22] background here and one on the tape
[44:24] especially page 24 when will it be
[44:27] brother branham how can I tell you I
[44:29] don't know open one of these things if
[44:31] we never meet again on this earth we're
[44:33] gonna meet me Anya at the judgment seat
[44:35] of Christ and you find out that in that
[44:38] room
[44:38] the revelation coming from God just like
[44:41] all the rest of them has that them one
[44:44] of the misses of that field the reason
[44:46] it wasn't revealed it was seven thunders
[44:49] and all the damn points and there it is
[44:52] perfectly because nothing knows anything
[44:55] about it it wasn't even written so we
[44:57] have been in time in 45 he's display
[45:02] high he was walking back and forth and
[45:04] then I thought well what is it Lord I
[45:05] walked up and down the floor awhile I
[45:07] kneeled down and prayed go back and pick
[45:11] up the Bible sit down and read walk back
[45:13] and forth and all of a sudden when I got
[45:15] quiet there it
[45:17] just unfolded like that then grab a pin
[45:19] right quick and go writing it down like
[45:21] that whatever I was seeing or doing
[45:24] watching it like that till I got it
[45:26] wrote down and then I take the rest of
[45:28] the day then go down and trace this out
[45:30] and see it as it tied all the way down
[45:33] to the scripture then it proves all
[45:37] things now there's many people have
[45:40] visions it may have been in Revelations
[45:42] but it is contrary to the worse you
[45:45] leave it alone
[45:46] Amen it's got to be in the Word of God
[45:49] now I just want to a drop the same thing
[45:52] here in the page 50 now did you notice
[45:57] no one know that the people these days
[45:59] still live in the hangover like it was
[46:02] some serious form of things because they
[46:04] just seeped into the ecclesiastic way of
[46:07] looking at it and they see it in a way
[46:09] that they attend there's have caught it
[46:10] that was God's Way at one time but we
[46:13] lived past that the we in the eagle time
[46:15] now so you had the spirit of man coming
[46:18] from Luther and Wesley and a Pentecostal
[46:21] and coming on with the ie
[46:23] that same spirit of man Mindy had
[46:26] Malakoff for bringing the diesel
[46:28] annoying him down and then going off the
[46:30] scene and then the bride coming in with
[46:33] the spare the eagle in between it's
[46:35] bitter man and for nine years now both
[46:37] Spears have come along together great
[46:40] illegal weirdo man leaving clean mrs.
[46:43] Amen but the eagle gets the revelation
[46:46] and during the man's tried to sing it
[46:50] out inside the robe at it but he can't
[46:53] dig it out because God reveals itself in
[46:57] forever he will amen to the Pope to the
[47:01] potentate to the bishop to the
[47:02] dignitaries know the whom to heaven he
[47:05] will for the most illiterate person the
[47:07] home forever he will
[47:09] amen oh thank god tonight and he did it
[47:12] that way to whomsoever he will no paint
[47:16] I noticed it look great public air but I
[47:19] no way I'm standing that's him
[47:20] Amen see so therefore I'm only saying
[47:23] what's written down here now because we
[47:26] have to understand what we're talking
[47:27] about things otherwise we never want had
[47:30] any reputation
[47:31] we got no what we're looking for also
[47:34] day 51 now the another note of the
[47:39] Seventh Seal and 3/4 mystery and I will
[47:42] he can have spoke that is the mystery of
[47:44] the seven thunders the seven thunders
[47:47] inhibitor will unfold this mystery how
[47:50] many he understand tonight
[47:51] that's deep seventh sea with its price
[47:53] unfolded or ordered out seven thunder
[47:57] voices through Malachi fourth mount I
[47:59] don't want to keep reading he understand
[48:02] that live I wanted to play it for you
[48:03] know what I'm talking about
[48:04] and the Seventh Seal he to me was the
[48:07] mystery of the seven thunders is also
[48:10] the mystery of it's coming and therefore
[48:12] the two were tied together deeply
[48:14] different I hope is not well amen there
[48:19] we go hey 52 now here now we fired the
[48:26] six seal has been opened for us we see
[48:28] it and we know it this seventh seal
[48:30] cannot be brought to the public until
[48:33] the hour I now there was some reason God
[48:36] left this human seven voices be funded
[48:41] because it must come think we find that
[48:44] Christ the Lamb took the book in his
[48:46] hand and he opened that seventh seal but
[48:49] you see if a hidden history no one knows
[48:51] it right along with what he said no one
[48:54] would know it's coming
[48:56] they also would not know about this
[48:58] seventh under mysteries for you see is
[49:01] connect it together and there's many
[49:03] people
[49:03] that are fun to open a seal for he
[49:06] didn't say them he said that the
[49:08] sixtieth open and the Son of Man which
[49:10] is the 70th come down on the Earth and
[49:13] Sun is out seven thunders and he he he
[49:17] comes down all those loose in the six
[49:19] seals open them up and it was vindicated
[49:23] gathers all blue pens of the six filled
[49:25] up into himself dating he's a seventh
[49:28] seal the infirmary's Frank in orders out
[49:31] seven thunder voices in Malachi for that
[49:34] is his ministry to reveal those thunders
[49:38] and they've got to be on the tape Oh a
[49:42] man Leah threat kept administrating and
[49:46] he said now and would not know about
[49:49] this seventh on the mystery so you see
[49:51] is connected together that must be have
[49:54] an understanding of the day because the
[49:55] rest of it it all unfolded but this is
[49:59] not important but Tiffany myeloma hers
[50:01] is not hers
[50:03] rather what P on hold to this seven
[50:05] thunders that's as far as you can go
[50:08] right there and now I struck for each
[50:10] eight at East and every one of you were
[50:12] third God into it which is right and
[50:15] loving all your life and serve him and
[50:17] God will take care of the rest
[50:19] now he has said here that it could not
[50:22] be broken to the public but all the
[50:24] false for knowing toothpaste he said
[50:26] don't you get it I'm not the son of man
[50:28] it is the seventh angel revealing a son
[50:32] of man to the public now he could not be
[50:35] revealed but there it was being revealed
[50:37] just a tiny announcing for what it
[50:40] hasn't happened here yet had happened
[50:42] sometime between 64 and 65 that somebody
[50:46] it's up for being a deal then as he
[50:48] summed it out seven thunders then the
[50:51] seven thunders itself pumps is a bright
[50:54] as the Word of God but not reveal as
[50:58] each Thunder is because if Satan could
[51:00] get ahold of it he could do great damage
[51:02] but he cannot impersonate this but it's
[51:06] not going to be poking there's only ones
[51:08] to be spoken into a
[51:10] who will receive it as the word and then

[56:58] thunders Amen he throws at it and you
[57:01] try to figure it out
[57:02] driving personated and all the time I'll
[57:05] have something here on the brief let's
[57:09] read over here is the inspiration
[57:10] strikes me this is the way God does it
[57:13] page eight well now hate is a book a
[57:15] mysterious book is a book of redemption
[57:17] and there we know that this book over
[57:20] Jensen will not be thoroughly understood
[57:23] this prose had through six church ages
[57:26] well at the end when the seven danger
[57:29] begins a sound has Miss Lee he winds up
[57:31] all of the loose ends and that these
[57:36] fellows hold that and the mysteries come
[57:39] down from God as the Word of God and
[57:42] reveals the entire revelation of God
[57:45] then the Godhead and everything else is
[57:49] settled all the mysteries / conceit of
[57:51] whatever morning is to be revealed now
[57:54] we understand that in 1933 and March
[57:57] there we were all sitting in there and
[58:00] then each day there God sent down the
[58:05] mystery to his prophet he says here as
[58:08] the word of God
[58:10] the Misses come down from heaven as the
[58:12] winner amen and the prophet the angel
[58:15] brings him the word 106 angels it rains
[58:18] in the horrors and then he goes into
[58:21] study and traces the mystery and the
[58:24] worst
[58:25] and with it locked then you walked out
[58:27] that night each night and preach the
[58:29] word the Missy wasn't veal as the word
[58:32] nothing strange about it is the word
[58:34] Amen all right now go further I'm gonna
[58:38] stand up there now now you see I'm I'm
[58:40] just not making it up
[58:42] Neff what is not saith the Lord our
[58:44] ready to out of the book the founding of
[58:46] the seven angels message the mystery of
[58:48] God should be finished that's been
[58:50] declared by his holy prophet that's the
[58:54] prophets who have wrote the words at the
[58:56] founding of the seventh church age the
[58:59] last turkey all the loose ends that
[59:02] through these procedures have been cold
[59:05] at the offense we're told that it will
[59:08] be wound up together and when the seals
[59:11] are broken and the Missis every meal
[59:14] down comes the angel the message of
[59:18] Christ setting its foot upon the land
[59:20] upon the sea with a rain of all his head
[59:23] relation 10 that's right and now
[59:25] remember this seventh angel is on the
[59:27] earth at the time of this coming now
[59:30] just as John was giving his message the
[59:33] same time that Messiah came in two days
[59:36] John knew he would see him because he
[59:39] were going to introduce him and we
[59:40] realize that in the typical of Malachi 4
[59:43] there's the one like John and Elijah to
[59:46] whom the Word of God can come to and he
[59:48] is to reveal by the Holy Spirit all
[59:51] mystery and restore the faith of the
[59:55] children back to the faith of the
[59:57] Apostolic fathers to restore back all
[1:00:00] these mysteries that's been told that to
[1:00:03] these denominational years now that's
[1:00:06] what the word said I'm just responsible
[1:00:08] for what it says please now we see that
[1:00:10] this Seventh Seal book is done mystery
[1:00:12] of redemption the pulse of a Testament
[1:00:14] God now although misses at this time
[1:00:17] should be finished at the sounding of
[1:00:20] this message and now this now here
[1:00:22] here's the aim
[1:00:23] on earth and another angel mighty
[1:00:26] messenger come down see this angel was
[1:00:28] the earthly angel messenger but here
[1:00:30] comes one down from heaven a rainbow
[1:00:32] covets the only Christ
[1:00:34] it could be just exactly like it was in
[1:00:37] Revelation chapter one salmon and here
[1:00:40] he returns back in the tenth chapter see
[1:00:43] after the coming time that all the
[1:00:46] mysteries ought to be finished and the
[1:00:47] steel ought to be books and proclaiming
[1:00:50] at time is no more the 70 of these seven
[1:00:54] seals has the book filled the book is
[1:00:56] absolutely filled the adhere the book is
[1:00:59] absolutely a steel book until the seven
[1:01:02] seals are broken the seal up at seven
[1:01:05] seals
[1:01:05] now that's different from the seven
[1:01:07] thunders this is seven seals on the book
[1:01:10] and a book will not the seals will not
[1:01:13] be released until the message of the
[1:01:16] seventh angel alright it's like to say
[1:01:19] now we see then that the mysteries come
[1:01:21] down to the angel in water to drink as
[1:01:24] the word of God and then we have the God
[1:01:27] who was in heaven sending down the
[1:01:29] mysteries as the word what we got him
[1:01:31] overhead revelation 10 himself coming
[1:01:34] down with rainbow covenant the seventh
[1:01:36] seal now he's on the earth as long as
[1:01:38] the seventh birthday angel at the same
[1:01:40] time and then he's saying that when he's
[1:01:43] on the earth he thunders out seven
[1:01:45] thunders on the earth but over here
[1:01:48] corner Malachi 4 he was in heaven
[1:01:51] sending down the misses from heaven in
[1:01:53] mark 63 to those six angels there and
[1:01:56] they brought into the room and it popped
[1:01:58] it on the prophet who stood for the word
[1:02:00] the white horse rider red horse rider
[1:02:02] and so on and so on and then but now he
[1:02:05] himself is on there thundering out seven
[1:02:08] thunders on the earth so we're gonna set
[1:02:11] it free
[1:02:11] all praise God I hope you do because
[1:02:15] then he's on the earth himself give out
[1:02:18] a seven Thunder message and for many get

[1:38:17] trumpet
[1:38:18] by which the years you believed was
[1:38:20] announced and you understand but did you
[1:38:23] believe because of course you do it was
[1:38:25] the 50th year when all the slaves and
[1:38:29] all who had lost their property they
[1:38:32] were to get back inheritance when in the
[1:38:35] Israel or their own man to sell it
[1:38:37] palpable but actually if only at least
[1:38:39] for focus via holy was at least I
[1:38:42] thought it was and at the end of 50
[1:38:45] years that he was born had lost his
[1:38:47] inheritance every 50 years were the
[1:38:49] Jubilee and therefore the capitalists
[1:38:53] set free off he had lost you and here
[1:38:56] tip three and go back to your hair now
[1:38:59] on the fifty year they tie this is a day
[1:39:02] of atonement and then we understand how
[1:39:07] it was done they had the to vote for the
[1:39:09] sins and one was plain and the blood was
[1:39:12] sprinkled by the high priest seven times
[1:39:14] and with his linen garments on and then
[1:39:17] when he had some finished when he had
[1:39:18] come out then and then he had took the
[1:39:21] other scapegoat and confessed his sins
[1:39:23] and all the Congress intends on a head
[1:39:25] of the scapegoat and then sent this goat
[1:39:28] borrowing with the people spend and he
[1:39:31] changed his garments amen it went inside
[1:39:34] us put all his priestly garments and it
[1:39:36] all Israel waited with a bated breath

[1:39:42] Jehovah but gives us this here they
[1:39:45] didn't know he wasn't sure would he do
[1:39:47] it and then they waited with a bated
[1:39:49] breath also they heard the bells are
[1:39:51] ringing holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:39:54] here he come walking out from within the
[1:39:56] veil Israel begin to shout this happened
[1:40:00] once a year but on the fiftieth year
[1:40:03] something else happen according to
[1:40:05] Hebrew tradition there was a man stood
[1:40:08] there as the high priest came out and
[1:40:10] knowing that the sin was forgiven this
[1:40:14] man waited when he saw the high priest
[1:40:16] walk out in his real accounting because
[1:40:19] it's Benz was forgiven for that year
[1:40:21] this was the year of the Jubilee also
[1:40:24] then this man there he would take a ram
[1:40:28] horn and port it to a Jewish tradition
[1:40:31] he would blow it seven times
[1:40:33] whoa walk walk walk walk amen and then
[1:40:39] in promised land
[1:40:41] seventh ram horns four boom and then

[1:52:46] jubilee feet now however this 1965 the
[1:52:49] enemy has come in like a flood of
[1:52:51] unbelief Isaiah 59 19 God raised the
[1:52:55] standard his word through the seven
[1:52:57] churches now God's manifestation of his
[1:53:00] word in flesh
[1:53:02] Malachi 4 these past nine years of all
[1:53:05] fenomena enemies coming with the blood
[1:53:08] of unbelief unbelief see this pledge
[1:53:10] aloud amen
[1:53:11] then God repeats his order 1975 after
[1:53:16] the word don't fall and raise up the
[1:53:18] Seventh Seal standing Malachi folk was
[1:53:20] also seen and income - false known it
[1:53:23] okay plenty ideas and then week back at
[1:53:27] brightest McCoy with drawings and she's
[1:53:30] brightening it she's adding wish he gets
[1:53:32] all build up then God raised up attend
[1:53:36] again of his words all he'll turn loose
[1:53:38] at all heavens handle decoders all
[1:53:42] heaviness pics and eastern open here you
[1:53:45] already had a foretaste of it already
[1:53:48] when brother baka with him you hear a
[1:53:49] little bit of it
[1:53:50] Amen yes the reason God seven thunders
[1:53:54] but already enough amen now Isaiah 59
[1:53:58] nineteen any kind of like a flood the
[1:54:00] nine years - excuse me
[1:54:02] God raising us standing up his own words
[1:54:05] how does he do it by making the same
[1:54:07] spirit spoken word more positive by what
[1:54:13] how can he make the same word in Malachi
[1:54:15] 4 more possible by 1935 by revealing the
[1:54:19] seven thunders of Malachi 4:2 the people
[1:54:23] oh then what Malachi so understood a new
[1:54:27] of the seven thunders when I get it I
[1:54:29] have the same thing
[1:54:31] amen that makes the word more positive
[1:54:34] then if this whole church Ezard has what
[1:54:37] Malachi 4 knew it was then you have that
[1:54:41] thing in here the same thing as early
[1:54:43] church head where he restored his back
[1:54:45] to it then the word has made more
[1:54:48] positive quicker more sharpen a
[1:54:50] two-edged sword then the bride has he
[1:54:53] revealed sunders in her and then God has
[1:54:56] raised up his standards sniffing excuse
[1:54:58] me the entire don't get one read
[1:55:02] something do you put on the whole armor
[1:55:04] of God Tenten Maria it takes the hidden
[1:55:07] power of the Spirit of God that word in
[1:55:10] there to break the whole like Peter keep
[1:55:13] the cut off the term is here with its
[1:55:14] poor but when it comes to real Christian
[1:55:18] and courage he didn't have it but after
[1:55:21] Pentecost he put on a whole arm of God
[1:55:22] he's a different person now what was it
[1:55:25] net
[1:55:25] word that he had walked with was in him
[1:55:29] burning you up with fire in his fishing
[1:55:31] hole he had the whole armor got on yes
[1:55:34] God provided armor he had the baptism
[1:55:37] filled with the Holy Ghost quote now see
[1:55:39] what is it God makes himself

[1:55:44] of Pentecost sent down the form of God
[1:55:46] for his army that was himself among you

[1:56:00] with you he is with us and in earth that
[1:56:02] is the arm of the word and he is the
[1:56:04] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in US
[1:56:06] which is the word making the promise
[1:56:09] manifest the spirit quickens the word
[1:56:11] other words he's the power that tends to
[1:56:13] pull it out there with him like David
[1:56:15] when he met Goliath there was only one
[1:56:17] place for the rock to hit everything
[1:56:19] else was army but God got into that
[1:56:21] spirit rock he had five stone facing
[1:56:23] Jesus something fixing to help because
[1:56:25] there is the word that promising the
[1:56:27] power of flinging amen now

[1:56:44] of five officers Apostles process

[2:31:10] yeah
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:49] yes
[2:32:30] I may be a little startled at the
[2:32:32] subpoena place but the voice of God the
[2:32:35] last thing how can we know the voice of
[2:32:38] God what can we tell the voice of
[2:32:41] Hollywood the voice of this the voices
[2:32:43] that how do I know
[2:32:44] Malik asked for he wouldn't leave us
[2:32:46] like that without telling a man who
[2:32:49] would do that
[2:32:49] please I want to finish it off right
[2:32:51] here and tell you what he said the voice
[2:32:54] of God painting and the voice of God
[2:32:58] they say how will we know is the voice
[2:33:00] of God because of the day long you look
[2:33:05] at all further off there are so many
[2:33:07] voices in the earth today that is
[2:33:10] absolutely a hard thing because it
[2:33:12] judges the voice of the supernatural if
[2:33:16] so many intellectual voices great voice
[2:33:18] a mighty man for intellectuals that in
[2:33:21] their selection condition even takes an
[2:33:24] ancient they're just our overnight
[2:33:26] people but they shake nation of bringing
[2:33:29] great organizations together great
[2:33:31] campaigns flowering and a person would
[2:33:33] be a bit confused it's enough to confuse
[2:33:36] them of how that these things go on and
[2:33:39] prosper and there's voices and raise up
[2:33:43] and do these things but it causes the
[2:33:44] voice of God the place way back
[2:33:46] somewhere the two boys we got and the
[2:33:50] voice of God it's a how will we know
[2:33:52] what the voice of God because for the
[2:33:54] day then it was in a vindicated prophet
[2:33:58] now today how we know if the voice of
[2:34:01] God because it is the manifestation of
[2:34:03] the prophets words and we that weekend
[2:34:08] this is God's prophet it's the Bible and
[2:34:11] a true voice of God only brings back at
[2:34:14] real living supernatural God with this
[2:34:17] supernatural word with the supernatural
[2:34:19] manifestation of the truer then we know
[2:34:22] that it is the voice of God because that
[2:34:25] super there's so much other in the other
[2:34:27] realm that just almost did it out but
[2:34:31] remember it will glisten it will come
[2:34:34] forth
[2:34:34] it'll do it and I believe it for it has
[2:34:37] done it down in through the other seven
[2:34:39] ages
[2:34:39] always
