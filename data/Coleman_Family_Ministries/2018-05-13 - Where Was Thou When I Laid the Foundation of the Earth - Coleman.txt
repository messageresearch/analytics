reverend C appreciates that in there yes sir I mean I haven't haven't heard that too many times and then so it makes you feel good to know that you're welcome amen and so therefore I certainly want to thank you for that and just a little testimony I thought I'd take about 10 minutes hey man September 20th 1974 the Holy Spirit the fog my father in heaven tell him reveal the seventh and seven thunders are the seven voices of the seven churches now that's the way it's supposed to come because in a seventh seal book on page 575 brother branham said that there will be seven voices of the thunders that will reveal the great revelation at that time so the voices of the thunders had to come to the Prophet because in Saint John 12 I believe it thundered nobody knew what was going on but Jesus knew it was his father speaking amen so the voice of Elohim came to the logos nail a man so there stood the logos to peel a fire veil see it was the voice in the clown amen or who is I just take a little testimony [Applause] on page five who is Melchizedek now I'm getting old now being the oldest preacher here I mean that's gonna preach anyway amen and so a man you were preached last night a preacher preacher preach last night a man and a young colored man got up on a horizontal rainbow [Applause] but he left room for all colored man to get up they all saw a man [Applause] happy - amen I don't think I have enough debt to say what beetle I don't know anything I'll find out the event so anyway page five a paragraph who is Melchizedek paragraph 422 now remember that light that was in that cloud that gave the revelation the light was in the cloud the cloud was representing seven thunders angels and church change too seven seals but there was somebody but not the Lord that was a ghoul of the law there was a pillow fire in the cloud Amen that was that boys there spoke to the Prophet and says go back in open mystery of marriage in divorce the Royce that was fooling up in the cloud hey man my little girl telling me Sara here that school there in Arizona was looking up there on a cloudless sky and seeing this cloud mysteriously and that mountain going up and down with an Amber fire burning in it your teachers dismissed the classes in the school and brought them out front and said did you see anything like that look look away now remember that's the same amber light that's on the rock so it's the same God same revelation said tell them to do this it's what I told you this morning which was marriage and divorce so it was still that word now what was the mystery of marriage in divorce first Corinthians chapter 7 verse 12 through 15 was the voice given to prophet the authority to forgive your sins in marriage in divorce you could get the cloud and angels and everything else bless that voice speaks it so remember now that light when I was in the cloud it spoke a matter anyway September 20 1974 seven thunders was revealed I thought it was for myself in my church demands I don't know anything about going out on the field so I just spoke it to my church for 71 days nobody else preached but myself and the Holy Spirit told me in August 1974 I was away on a vacation someone give you a specially designed messages to bring down the Holy Ghost in your church from September the 8th to November 17th from 8 to 8 amen and so then I appreciate some this is what the Holy Ghost is giving forward and capstone the love and all the different messages and I had four preparatory messages amen Armageddon and I believe consecrated temple sanctification amen and then Christ is in his temple seven Thunder baby amen on a Wednesday and Wednesday night September 18 our preach expectation Simeon that was September 18 in Friday morning I was reading I knew something was moving just like here in this meeting something is moving [Applause] and then on Friday morning September 20th already laid out for preparatory messages my things and we're here buy things and then reading the statue of a perfect man that morning in the water in the bathtub a man in a then the Holy Spirit dropped down in there and said the seven thunders are the seven points and seven churches use a man after simian expectation the Holy Ghost review you're gonna see the price and the price is anointed word so there was a Christ seven thunders amen and then it was scriptural revealed Scripture because page 304 and the fourth seal this says wait a time element is involved wait I say wait on the Lord you shall renew your spent go get all excited frustrated wait God spoke it so shall it be so a man so we had waited since 6365 and then they it says on page 304 wait till the seven thunders auda is voices but now it just turned it back around and he told a prophet the Prophet said there'll be seven voices of the thunders coming to the profile then for the bribe way to the thunders on the tapes and books artists voices [Applause] so therefore I knew I was right with the splitter tapes I had to wait for the thunders already on the tape to audit the voices if I'm not a prophet I'm in the pride but there is a gift of wisdom among the nine gifts to know how to put the Word of God together well praise the Lord that's my testimony amen and then we begin to go out in 1975 from September 20th from my own church the Lord spoke to me and said go to Beaumont Texas and I thought Beaumont Texas and well amen and while the Dilek was there with us and other brothers and they are started with a little message entitled seven live voices amen and praise God I went out from there I wondered why Texas well the Prophet died in Texas and the word went in the ground in Texas [Applause] so from the West they'll come for fall a horse rider [Applause] a man but now remember the white horse rider comes locals and Elihu so the logos come right out as the thunders with a promise to wait for the dynamics here we are heaven so there's been six years of sewing from 1974 September 20th to 1980 September was six years of sewing and the Holy Spirit had given me Leviticus 25 verse 1 through 6 way back in 1968 and told me I was sold and then explained a little few things to me man but I had no idea that I had to do that on the field just for my own church well anyway I don't have time to read the book verse 1 through 6 is what he give me that you are mean so I'll pick up one verse in here third verse six years thou shalt soul I feel in six years thou shalt plane dive in you can gather in the fruit there road but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath now watch or Sabbath of rest on to the land it's not a Saturday Sabbath it's a Seventh Seal Holy Spirit land rest [Applause] did you get it six years saw them seven thunders sees then beginning in 1980 about September begins the seventh year so God called for a rest he said turn the clown [Applause] so I rested I just turned the crown the Holy Spirit pours out [Applause] so I'm resting but some happen arrested with the Holy Spirit amen in New York City and coronation bill what happened in melt coronation bill crowd was turned then I believe you had a Issa convention and Kimberly then the Holy Spirit had our brother Roscoe from Johannesburg took him way back before the beginning the crowd was turned which is L ahem now somebody got a speakit they gotta say it they got to declare the season [Music] so our brother declared the season yellow him as a seven spirits around about April that time come charity never faileth [Music] and then old dead seeds that was sitting in my church for 18 years sitting and sitting and setting when charity exploded in April 1981 them old C's jumped up from there [Music] [Applause] so praise God they didn't know he was Ella him yeah they'd understand he's here they went so then in pin Harris we had quite a time we have 16 pictures with the glory of the Lord and the 16 pictures was represented 60 years [Music] [Applause] because the Prophet said the mechanics and the dynamics is here now [Applause] but if you can just get started with the right attitude and the right attitude as a beer dog if you call a dog a man even a dogs eat the crumbs [Applause] and the right attitude is to come like Martha large jv8 shoes if you would have been here but he was all already there [Applause] a man so then the holy spirit of 1981 was getting the attitudes ranks because Elohim was just holding over you this wait before you to sanctify yourselves amen to get right with God and then amen so we have the 16 pictures one picture for every year to prove he's been here with you all the time so then L ahem gave you 16 years with your 16 elements of your flesh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a man praise gonna nine one year for your flesh a year for Claudia flesh amen what's happening Ella hem is number 17 in 17 is victory so praise God brother we don't fear a devil we know where we are standing this rather we challenge every devil in the universe we got the devil under our feet [Applause] [Music] that's what Joshua told him to get those Kings and put your foot on their necks [Music] and we got them down in the ground now don't you get weep now and let them up don't feel sorry for the old Gibeonites come with old moldy bread and old raggedy clothes and setup I'm in the fenders don't you believe that [Applause] oh I'll better get along I don't know how I got over here he-man so praise God amen well anyway turn the clown turned it in New York and then turned it in Maryland and come over to Johannesburg and the coronation field and turn at the third third time why three times he said third phase brotherly love 1974 some have compassion identify the seven churches a man and then pick up the message of his seventh churches seven thunders identifying for seven years take the quotes Amen from the backside of the Bible reveals and they're gonna think that you can't preach the Bible the big Minister we've got the Bible he's got to close but know how you'd understand from the backside and they had the Bible you know like the sense in Isaiah or go get a learning man he said I don't understand amen go get somebody else is sealed of course is sealed well praise the Lord Amen so here we are give little testimony a man trying to get everything just right amen so anyway 1982 cloud was turned the third phase and pin Harris identified sin for brother into rascal brother George Martin brought I was wondering about my meeting I knew it was charity and I couldn't preach it myself and I had to have somebody with a revelation of priests charities brother George Martin came over in June and brought me a tape and the elders I believe told by the etiquette to send the tape a brother Coleman he have said it himself but he was asked to send it that's inspiration I was needing that is not me or brother Edgar or Martin or this one or that one or twine them it's the Holy Spirit we are the same body Romans 12 everyman menaces according to his measure so I'm only mincing according to my measure and you Minister core New York measure I thank God for brother Tommy Dillon a man old soldier over here he stood faithfully a man and he had to take the rebuke the revile ins the curses for heaven he being Wayne having a colored man come to the meetings and preach five times with everybody in the message sitting there in 1975 you can imagine what they call him and then also the added rebuke of New York City the Prophet says something about New York City and one brother said yeah watch New York false prophets are coming out of there hey that watch New York City they can turn anything around of course they matter so New York City it kind of got kind of funny because there was brother Nino brother hunt by the Coleman it was three of us and they'd come to the meetings and they won't do the preaching here and all is always New York this and all the sings and brother Bellomo and everything is in New York no matter where we go there all the ministers would get funny yeah what could we do I mean we just come in in the name of the Lord [Applause] you got to put up with the spirit of man you mean because it's just about over this year hope is over in these meetings amen so I don't care who it is or where I come from as long as it's there but now when you get out of the spirit of man from Laodicea and get over to the book of Acts in Jerusalem they had eleven apostles I personally would have liked to have all eleven right here how about you I'd like to have those prophets and teachers from Antioch it doesn't matter long as the Spirit of God that the Prophet speak one by one amen well praise God we certainly appreciate these things so now just we have we are in nineteen that we into eighth year and he says in Leviticus 25 verse 20 through 22 in the eighth year soldier seed but this time with mechanics and dynamics together so I feel trees caught by the inspiration God is fixing to give this ministry power and authority to clean up the churches of the unclean spirits and Paul the virtues into the bride to the perfection of the coming of the Son of God we're here we have arrived a man soul praise God we in the eighth year you believe that a man so anyway that's some remarks here somewhere wait I have it here now 19 September 12 1981 I had 3 thoughts in the beginning was the word the Lord to give me this year but from the beginning there wasn't a soul number 3 to know him from the beginning so I'm speaking to a brother Roscoe he told me the whole is very deal to know him from to get into him so well that's on both sides at the ocean they love him so praise God is wonderful to know the inspiration so I feel like this is a la m7 rainfall convention in 1982 Dell ahem and logos a man the dynamics and the mechanics is ready to mold you in 1982 into the word image in the eight-year and wait till the ninth year are to her fruits come in so here we are marriage in divorce page 14 brother Brown speaking here usually a revival lasts only about three years but this has been going on for over 15 years and not one denomination has sprung up from it and they tried seven thunders a nomination there is none pimping and for this is the seed time there's no more shot after the shucks gone is see God is ready amen if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to perfection by his word Jesus Christ so I'm looking for God to call a church to perfection this year you believe that now our brother Edgar stepped out by faith and I know what that is seven funders give faith a man and on page 25 in marriage in divorce just let you know that God said that before the beginning in the beginning in front of beginning before the beginning was Ella him and Helen was the seven spirits that's what our brothers said and page 25 he said what is God God is a great eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning way back before they even was a beginning and that's what brother Roscoe preached way back before the beginning before there was a beginning [Applause] amen he wasn't even gone did you know that God's the object of worship and there was nothing to worship Him he lived alone and in him was attributes and what does an attribute of thought now you get something that will board on the lesson for tonight he was his attributes that was in him he was his attributes [Music] amen praise God he was his own attributes now it was in him to be father in him to be God and him to be son and him him to be Savior it was in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes and you are the physical manifestation [Applause] of the display of elohim's attributes so please go so anyway we are I'm kind of got my thoughts over here a man so anyway my inspiration for these meetings it comes from so on September 20th but telling me in the beginning was the word and but from they get it was not soul and to know him from the beginning to know him his eternal life September 20th seven years to the day September 20th this year 1981 from September 20th 1974 was seven years in that morning he giving us a message in the beginning was the word that's what I want to preach what am I trying to understand and he spoke to me the message this morning the message to nail the book of life so on September 20 in seven years after the thunders the Holy Spirit gave me the inspiration for these messages which is the Lamb's Book of Life so I thought it fitting to go along with LEM amen so that's my inspiration now catch this now I think assist asked for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're sure going to get it whoever you are [Applause] because here's your quote sister whoever you are three kind of believers amen three kind of believers now we have I got it at a man Paradis that's the reason page 15 that I do believe that when that bride is called out she's called out for 16 years and seven thunders gathers the brown calls around this call-out and elected election predestination and set in the book of life are you reading [Applause] we gotta be set in when that happens when that time comes God's got to come where they're gonna be sent in the book of life they'll come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism the Holy Ghost into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a Rapson grace cut promise it is I don't care how old-fashioned it sees for God's hips hold so there we are now so my inspiration September 28 1981 is a preach on the book of life then he promised it here you do it somebody do it him and then they'll come a sound from heaven so we're waiting for sounds from heaven sound from heaven is life coming from heaven amen now the seven thunders gives faith to set their pride in the book of life now we've been setting the book the bride in the book of life all these years but then it's got to come a time when God makes it real and gives you a part of hims name which is Ella hems life then what happens to realize when the bride begins to realize like in these meetings here mm so so if we want to take our time this morning to make sure Cape Town gets it Kimberly gets it East London appacha strong and however you say it in all the rest of the believers now we know that I believe in shouting I believe in in see any man is you know what I know about it if you hear restoration of RAD tree you hear me screaming and shouting tear up his hat [Music] why because my lane was reasonable [Applause] well anyway there's other people in the back and outside and and it couldn't hear too good last night amen Seoul is wonderful to shout and we were talking with the pastor and the different ministers here and brother twine him brother Roscoe's we all was talking and they asked him would I just say a few words so pardon me being a visitor amen I'll kind of come right down this road right here right in the middle here Amen I'll just walk right on out in here amen I'll say my words keep walking amen praise the Lord a man I want like you know I don't have to have any man anyway I thought it'd be good if for you can shout and stand up and say Amen but when you start clapping nobody can hear amen and we do want to hear so amen praise God what they're clapping in the banging down on the platform is what when the people came here and we are here to hear thereby fine a man will let there come forth us sound from heaven well praise God anyway so now just before we stand the spoken word means flesh is light amen it is the light that be walking in we've been walking in the light of Malachi 4 for 16 years it was the light to ripen now the seven thunders is that right it's the same light of Paul arrhenius and Martin and Columba and Luther West America for the seven thunders is the light and it flashed on the Seas for sixteen years and it ripen you were towards you and then are you ready for the seventeenth year was in the 17th year Genesis 37 Joseph put on his coat [Applause] he said well our goal I'm 17 years old now I think I put on my coat and I go on and I'll have some fellowship with the Brethren now I'm not Joseph I'm Joseph Coleman I gotta cover myself all the time he said he was Joseph he reduce a man where's the law I Revan see and then yes sir well praise God so a prophet said or what's attraction on a mountain in the last things he said that are and he said that the lemons and grapefruits would be hooked into that tree amen a citrus life and he called the lemons and the grapefruits denominations but he said in the top of the tree where the fruit comes there would be something hiding up there it would be a tangelo they'd be half orange and half amen lemon and the tangent law is a perversion it's not a lemon which is a denomination not a grapefruit sour cranky former fanatics hey man well it's a tangelo sweetie sweet creeping around silly women's houses in the last days and the tangelo is a perversion of the last 16 years of shot and a tangelo in the top of the tree with the orange we're almost deceive the very elect if possible so there we are but when that orange branch moves out test the lemons and grapefruits it'll be right in the top with the tangelo and here we are right in the top oh praise God better get to my message amen but something I do want to say over here a baby brother Roskill mentioned that genesis of the ESET aliens it turns a men an eight-time let us make man and ellingham said to logos let us make man in our image a man and so that's wonderful amen that's what God's been been doing here with you amen he's been doing the same thing to see the sea is already planted in the earth and the water is on top of the air but God put disease in there first so all those denominational waters from revelation 17 doesn't matter the big sitting on the waters where God put the seeds under the hey man so God knows all he need is light to dry deland part the waters a man in giant earth your earth up let it dry out for 16 years amen so therefore deceits already planning the earth the Spirit of God move once again upon the face of the waters and separate the waters from the waters then he began to speak the word let there be let it be let there be did you get it now no more this he's already planning number two the Spirit of God moves number three will then see have no fear speaking let there be amen and God saw the light and a fundus was good and he named a light he tall it damn and loofah named the light he called it justification and Wesley named the lights and the Pentecostals name the life and we name the light the seven continents that's why we may that's why we keep saying seven thunders we're naming the [Applause] and we said let there be a firmament between the waters on the top and the waters on the bottom and you are the waters on the top heavenly places is in between here now in heavenly places and the church was separated from the bride the water the bride waters from the church waters now all we got to do in 1982 with power and authority is say let there be failure let there be virtue knowledge that could be [Applause] who speaking ill of him Sam [Applause] is not the fivefold ministry it is L or Hillman neppy let there be never be what is caught doing led off gilma him and locals dynamic said mechanics create the prac in 1982 and moles are bribed into the word image oh my Malachi 4 has revealed every mystery the word made flesh the spoken word made flesh is life in life when it comes by the word made manifests as long as it's in the Bible and on the tapes and the books it can still be questioned then later amen but when it's made manifest didn't you see the product manifesto I'm just recapping for the other people here a man page 336 seven steelbook our fifth seal he's thinking about the creating like the leukemia and things like that he's an era I'm gonna speak I'm gonna speak it in the revelation of my fame so he'd have to say in the name and dis hopefully because he had a revelation of Jehovah of the Old Testament Saints worlds in Philadelphia Church age page 412 of paragraph 241 Peter says such as I have that's what he had the revelation of it give IV in the name of Jesus Christ stand up and walk but that was the early bride we have that plus so we have the name of Jesus but we also have a long hill leatherby let there be the tippy [Applause] so freeze God do we see where we are what's the promise for a day speak it st. mark 11 st. John 14:12 so on a seventh seal book third seal page 242 back to the beginning with Elihu amen hit brother bands quoting now he's quoting from page 242 the third seal Saint John 1:1 God's thoughts become creation when his spoke by a word therefore you are a creation sitting here because a prophet spoke you from his heart you were hidden mysteries in the prophets hot you hear you up that's when he presents it to I'm still quoting now from page 242 that is when he presents it to you as a thought here's the thoughts then he says your thought for your season your attack not Pentecost right [Applause] so it's your thought so all that he said is your thoughts to be revealed in you everything the Prophet says is to be revealing used is your thought and it is revealed to you by your father still potent then if still a thought until you speak it [Applause] so that's where we stand this morning we have stopped the fun news we have for adoption we have step perfection and now we are speaking hell ahem [Applause] the are you begin to understand now off Cape Town the different places that's why are they on fire Johannesburg is about to burst but they promise the whole back until

hands Berg - amen let him hear in the back praise the Lord and they want to hear too tell you one thing by the end of this meetings here you all will be shouting and [Applause] that's the promise you

last night amen job 38 verse 4 where was now when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hath understanding who hath laid the meshes there all if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon all the Foundation's thereof fasten or who laid the cornerstone there are when the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy a man is pigeons he fishes the first chapter amen [Music] verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have for past tense hath already blessed us with all spiritual blessings before the foundation of the world in heavenly places in Christ in the anointed Word according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy and without blame before him in love having three deaths unaided us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will then if it's God's good pleasure to do it what do we keep I was somebody saying to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he half past tense made us accepted in the beloved Romans 8 amen verse 20 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them only he also called and whom he called them only he also justified and whom he justified them only he also glorified and what shall we say to these things if L ahem be for us who can be against us shall we bow is the word of Prayer Almighty caught we have give a testimony we feel everything is just now may the Spirit of God move upon the waters Heavenly Father we have read that word now breathe fire into the word and bless the people and may they come up sound from heaven of a rushing mighty wind to fill all all the people that's sitting in the house of God this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated please got a man well I like to take a little thought this morning amen now remember the theme is sitting in the book of life then waiting for sound from heaven that's the theme of these meetings amen now I have no title where wast thou when I laid the foundation of the air and I have a subject the Lamb's Book of redemption and I'll finish it tonight amen my inspiration is representation by predestination amen now this great question had been sealed as a mystery on the back of the book written before the foundation of the world in relation 13:8 the Beast system and the beast would deceive all that or on the face of Eris except an elective predestinated people in all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and that always always wondered about when did the win was from win the death star when was from the foundation of the world I read the dictionary on and try to understand it never could understand well of course in the beginning god that's as far as the human mind can go we can go no further than that candle minister go any further than that in the beginning yah so to go further than that you need a revelation from the backside [Music] that's the first thing eBay so praise God amen now on Revelation book of symbols vol

a thought at the beginning you can never become the word unless you are a thought that proves a predestination of God you can't be the word unless you Authority you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany what you was in that the apne as a word but you come around a theophany because if you if you would have thought he was here you would have known all things but he had the thunders ready for you to reveal thunders is for the sons in the adoption the Prophet said that the sons of God are to bring up the mysteries [Applause] and reveal them and show them and put them on display and Christ is the mystery review remember my daughter saying their token this morning the blood seven thunder blood has been a plaque ill of him

flesh to be tempted by sin amen and then if you sent all the father's giving me will come to me I'll raise up the last day I'll raise him up at the last day so you had to be first and did you see he come right down the rebel line from natural use before the foundation of the world his name's put on the lands of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear and disappear

into your hearts and then you're born again you have the new birth and birth means creation a continuation of the creation and therefore before you receive the Holy Ghost you are believing unto eternal life but you do not have eternal life until you receive the Holy Ghost because it is eternal life the Holy Ghost is God's life in you then you got eternal life but the all words cease here that's looking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and because you are a word seed from his thinking therefore you can receive the baptism when the sound from heaven comes and it's here so before the
