[0:00] let us stand in respect to the reading
[0:03] of the word of the Lord I don't really
[0:04] want to hold you too long this morning
[0:05] we didn't want to get you out and I
[0:08] haven't settled down since I've been
[0:10] home then going the whole week have you
[0:12] had a chance to do anything but I'm
[0:14] trusting on the grace of God this
[0:15] morning let us turn to Philippians the
[0:18] 3rd chapter and reading from the first
[0:21] verse finally my brethren rejoice in the
[0:27] Lord to write the same things to you to
[0:29] me indeed is not Grievous but for you it
[0:32] is safe the way of dogs beware of evil
[0:36] workers beware of the concession the
[0:41] Tomatis Jews now and the dogs speaking
[0:44] about there because a carrot there or
[0:46] could conduct an evil workers is their
[0:49] character see in the dogs in the Old
[0:52] Testament wasn't even supposed to come
[0:53] into the house of God and that's why we
[0:56] were called dogs Gentile dogs but here
[0:59] Paul is he is here reversing it and
[1:01] calling ISA
[1:02] a Jewish legalizes also trust in their
[1:05] flesh and what they can do and I pray
[1:07] and I did so and so he calls your dog
[1:09] that's what he's saying here so let's
[1:12] get the word of the Lord here hey men
[1:14] just Gentile dogs again has he called
[1:17] him Jewish dogs here
[1:18] see and so therefore his same because
[1:22] you're unclean and a dog was unclean in
[1:25] the Old Testament couldn't come into the
[1:26] house of God that's why they called dogs
[1:28] Gentile dogs and Paul just turned the
[1:30] table over and : these Jews dogs who are
[1:32] trusting and what I'm getting ready to
[1:35] read to you for we are the circumcision
[1:37] which worship God in the spirit we are
[1:40] the circumcision those who in Christ is
[1:42] the real circumcision aim and nothing of
[1:45] the flesh now which worship God in the
[1:47] spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and
[1:50] have no confidence in the flesh that's
[1:53] what I was just telling our little
[1:54] sister Ellen don't have no confidence
[1:56] anything in your mind anything no
[1:58] confidence though I might also have
[2:01] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[2:03] thinketh that he hath whereof he might
[2:05] trust in the flesh I more Paul said I'm
[2:07] more than all of you see circumcised the
[2:10] eighth day of the stock of Israel of the
[2:11] tribe of Benjamin
[2:13] and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching
[2:14] the law a pharisee concerning zeal
[2:17] persecuting the church touching the
[2:19] righteousness which is in the law
[2:20] blameless but what things were gain to
[2:24] me those I counted loss for Christ
[2:28] doubtless and I count all things but
[2:30] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[2:32] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[2:36] suffered the loss of all things and do
[2:39] count them but dung that I may win
[2:41] Christ and be found in him here it is
[2:45] not having my own righteousness brother
[2:48] nothing that we can do see Amen which is
[2:51] of the law but that which is through the
[2:54] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[2:57] is of God by its by faith is what he
[3:00] gives us and we go from what he gives us
[3:03] to what he gives us from faith to faith
[3:05] amen it gave me some this morning you go
[3:08] with that today give some tonight go
[3:10] with that until Wednesday
[3:11] hey man you just keep going when he
[3:12] gives you and so oh praise the Lord
[3:14] thank you Lord I got that and he'll go
[3:19] with you
[3:20] that I may now here it is that I may
[3:23] know him in the power of his
[3:26] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[3:28] sufferings being made conformable unto
[3:31] his death if by any means I might attain
[3:33] unto this resurrection of the dead not
[3:36] as though I had already attained see
[3:39] very humble here neither were already
[3:41] perfect but I far after it that I may
[3:45] apprehend that for which also I am
[3:48] apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I
[3:51] count not myself to have apprehended but
[3:54] this one thing I do and may it be what
[3:58] the one thing we do from this time on
[4:01] forgetting those things which are behind
[4:03] and reaching forth unto those things
[4:07] which are before our press toward the
[4:10] mark for the prize of the high calling
[4:13] of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore
[4:17] as many as be perfect be thus minded and
[4:21] if anything you be otherwise minded
[4:24] I shall reveal even this unto you
[4:26] nevertheless where to we have already
[4:28] attained let us walk by the same rule
[4:32] let us mine the same thing and first
[4:35] Corinthians the ninth chapter 24th verse
[4:42] no you're not that they which run in a
[4:45] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[4:51] so run that you may obtain and every man
[4:55] that striveth for the mastery is
[4:57] temperate in all things now they do it
[5:01] to obtain a corruptible crown but we an
[5:04] incorruptible
[5:05] alright therefore so run not as
[5:08] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[5:12] beateth the ear but I keep my body and
[5:15] bring it into subjection lest that by
[5:18] any means when i have preached to others
[5:21] i myself should be a castaway may guard
[5:25] a blessing to ring novice word i like it
[5:27] take a little thought I hear unity of
[5:29] the faith may we just breathe a word of
[5:31] Prayer father we pray this morning that
[5:33] these are wonderful scriptures God may
[5:36] you open them to us this morning or open
[5:39] the children's bread and feed the Lambs
[5:41] and reveal something to us which is
[5:43] faith and may they go with this faith
[5:45] today and rejoice in it bless your word
[5:48] and bless the people and father may the
[5:50] holy spirit come down to convict souls
[5:52] and bring them to Christ and heal the
[5:54] sick and may many signs wonders and
[5:56] miracles be done
[5:57] father we pray and we asked it in Jesus
[5:59] name and his sake amen they'll all best
[6:02] you may be seated like it take a little
[6:04] tile out of here the unity of the faith
[6:06] and so now we have the Lord's Supper
[6:10] tonight and remember the the the order
[6:14] in the house of God downstairs tonight
[6:16] at all times now the the appeal this
[6:19] morning here in Philippians the third
[6:21] chapter the 15 16th verse is for unity
[6:25] unity of purpose unity of desire unity
[6:29] in
[6:30] now merica for our prophet of God to
[6:34] this generation has restored back to
[6:37] faith amen we know that and as in the
[6:41] book of acts the second chapter the
[6:42] first verse and when the day of
[6:43] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[6:46] with one Accord one mind in one place
[6:49] brother if we can only get on one Accord
[6:52] in here as Paul is exhorting us there
[6:55] for as many as be perfect as many as be
[6:58] grown-up as many as be mature as many as
[7:02] be turned from a green to a golden brown
[7:06] amen as many are they have reached that
[7:09] spot perhaps this morning after eight
[7:12] years of ripening from green to brown if
[7:15] you we can finally reach one Accord this
[7:19] morning praise God we have another penny
[7:22] constant here this morning if every
[7:25] person within contact of my voice could
[7:29] they'll finally say Lord God this
[7:31] morning for I want to forget about the
[7:34] world I don't want to know nothing back
[7:38] here I just want my eyes on Jesus what a
[7:43] mind what attitude brother the Holy
[7:46] Spirit would so zero in on you and and
[7:50] fill you with this presence this morning
[7:52] and I always got to come whether it be
[7:55] one two three four is going to be
[7:57] somebody is gonna meet and when brother
[7:59] Branson when you can get ten people to
[8:01] agree there'll be a rapture well praise
[8:04] gotta let the ten be in here amen when
[8:08] you can get tend to agree zero in on a
[8:10] purpose and the only thing I know that
[8:12] we can agree on being different people
[8:15] nationalities and spirits and and
[8:17] backgrounds and everything else we can
[8:20] agree on the word amen we can all agree
[8:23] on a word of God so therefore we preach
[8:25] the word not our minds what we think but
[8:28] the Word of God so we here have one
[8:31] object this morning that is to be mature
[8:34] in Christ in other religions it means
[8:39] that they are designated they're fully
[8:41] instructed as
[8:43] as opposed to the novices and therefore
[8:46] we have come to a point now where they
[8:49] are those who have been fully instructed
[8:52] for the past eight years they've heard
[8:55] the tapes and they've got the books that
[8:57] got the Bible and the Lord has even
[8:59] blessed you with an extra portion of
[9:01] understanding and revelation well
[9:04] there's got to come a day sometime when
[9:07] we're gonna leave the swelling close
[9:10] amen and be thus minded the way Paul was
[9:14] the way that the diffusions church was
[9:18] not the way the the Corinthians were
[9:21] what sentence doing and this man in that
[9:23] man or the Hebrew church not wanting to

[10:22] thing is pulsating in my heart and that

[14:35] saw the same desire same motive in
[14:38] william branham he kept pressing on that
[14:41] right he even said that I'm the least of

[14:50] the spoken word
[14:51] well where do we where do we get off
[14:53] being all puffed up and have attained
[14:55] and all we gotta do is go in the tent
[14:58] and what now what kind of spirit is that

[15:05] already perfect what a devil what a
[15:08] deceiving spirit
[15:10] Amen see but not so in New York City no

[15:19] got hot seats in here don't sit down
[15:21] here like that brother no brother
[15:23] mm yes sir you don't come in here sit
[15:25] down with that attitude no sir
[15:28] remember young sister coming over here
[15:29] last summer asked several people here
[15:32] what is brother coming getting it what
[15:34] is he trying to extract perfection can't
[15:38] help but try to get it out that's what's
[15:40] in my heart I'm looking for perfection
[15:42] because he's looking for some message of
[15:44] the hour perfection so that don't be it
[15:47] there's nobody at ease and sighing in
[15:49] here no praise the Lord
[15:52] nobody at ease in here everybody on your
[15:55] mark on your toes Amen Dickens excuse
[15:59] everybody be on your toes in the house
[16:02] of God praise the Lord
[16:04] now if you're otherwise minded or if
[16:07] you're not quite convinced as to this
[16:10] point of view or that it should be
[16:12] applied this seal to every area of your
[16:15] life well don't worry about it God will
[16:17] reveal it to you see so it might be 15
[16:21] in here they have this desire
[16:23] maybe another 40 don't have it but take
[16:25] it easy got a revealer tear from faith
[16:27] to faith and then you see another one
[16:30] they don't have it don't get all mad at
[16:31] you and you know get all exasperated
[16:34] with the person God will reveal it to
[16:36] that person Amen praise the Lord
[16:39] see so just just let God do it and we'll
[16:42] be all right praise God so now but let
[16:45] those of us who are spiritually mature
[16:47] and full-grown have this man hold these
[16:50] convictions and if any respect you got a
[16:53] different attitude your brother or your
[16:55] sister
[16:55] pray for them and God and make it clear
[16:57] to them for he must reveal it to them
[17:00] and we can't do it see so now a Paul is
[17:04] saying here and those of us here in a 16
[17:06] verse only let us hold true to what we
[17:08] have already attained and walking or our
[17:11] lives or by that lets not deviate from
[17:14] nothing so therefore I feel with all my
[17:17] heart we have attained something we have
[17:20] added an add and add and we come to a
[17:21] certain spot
[17:22] we were green and golden brown when we

[17:57] seven seals we just finished the seven
[17:59] churches and this is a message on
[18:01] teaching that ties the man in that's
[18:04] going to be redeemed by the blood of the
[18:06] Lord Jesus and it's going to be in that
[18:07] church age that eternal church age at

[19:20] now beautiful and they say well why do I
[19:23] have to hear the word though the word is
[19:25] the divine nature of God and then a
[19:28] prophet come with a message and tells us
[19:30] how to get that divine nature by adding
[19:33] to your faith and then you take

[25:01] purchased my salvation on Calvary's tree
[25:03] brother that's what I preached this
[25:05] morning
[25:06] how many have placed at this morning to
[25:08] come to the unity of the faith a perfect
[25:12] man unto the measure of the stature of
[25:15] the fullness of Jesus Christ then if now
[25:19] there's something don't know this
[25:20] morning you know this is spiritual
[25:23] people talkin el no more greenness amen
[25:28] see it's golden brown and it's making a
[25:31] pledge this morning we'll go said
[25:36] Rebecca she said so then she said she
[25:39] didn't feel anything she'd even know
[25:40] what it look like but she had a pledge
[25:43] he pledged to go regardless amen
[25:47] loving him and not even haven't even
[25:48] seen him she loved them anyway praise
[25:52] our God so back up your pledge now as we
[25:55] preach here for another half an hour
[25:57] let's back it up you're ready for the
[25:59] word amen
[26:00] praise the Lord so now we are we are
[26:04] pledged to unity of the faith in the the
[26:07] perfect man unto the measure of the
[26:09] stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ
[26:11] I remember my own own little personal
[26:14] testimony how when I was a young man and
[26:17] growing up I could understand my own
[26:19] self I was awed did like to be with a
[26:22] big crowd of people like to just be
[26:24] alone love to play ball and running
[26:26] things like that I could express myself
[26:28] but just to be around I just was kind of
[26:31] strange I didn't know what it was it was
[26:33] something in here and everything that
[26:35] was off it I look wrong I just what I
[26:37] wasn't satisfied with it I didn't have
[26:39] any satisfaction Amen I went here I went
[26:42] there no satisfaction but when I met him
[26:46] satisfaction praise God satisfaction and
[26:50] even thinking about my own birth in our
[26:53] memoir my mother told me a few years ago
[26:55] when she was six months uh because
[26:57] pregnant with me my angel appeared to
[27:00] her and said when the child is born name
[27:02] him Joseph and how she testified in the
[27:05] Pentecostal church here Bishop Lawson
[27:07] and then when the child was born it was
[27:09] a boy and she named him Joseph and that
[27:11] nature is in my heart and that means God
[27:15] shall add prosper so I can't get away
[27:18] from that it's something that I haven't
[27:20] done if something is in here and may
[27:23] don't understand you you think you're
[27:25] nuts or something where is about a turn
[27:27] the prophet of gossip for some nuts to
[27:29] be linked to some books a man I'm
[27:32] praying one of those nuts they meant to
[27:35] be bolted to Jesus Christ so how can I
[27:38] help but have been thus minded like Paul
[27:41] I have got to go on to profession for
[27:44] that very thing is lean in my nature I
[27:46] can't help it it is cut to add and then
[27:49] when I come forth in this generation
[27:51] here is a prophet with a message and
[27:54] your faith how can I get away from it
[27:58] there's a very message to life for me to
[28:01] add to and you if you want it
[28:04] praise the Lord so now I hope you
[28:06] understand me now you wanna know what do
[28:08] you what am i digging at you know I was
[28:10] born that way so I got to dig the way
[28:13] I'm born amen praise Allah hurt so if I
[28:17] can't be satisfied here like chickens I
[28:19] gotta fly
[28:20] I can't stare out on the old telephone
[28:23] wires clucking around over some dead
[28:25] revelation but I got a soar into the
[28:27] spirit and get for myself blessed be the
[28:30] name of the Lord I mean going out to
[28:33] Tucson
[28:33] praise God knowing that God shall
[28:36] prosper God shall add that's for you
[28:39] he's added do ever think what am I gonna
[28:42] do support was supposed what God shall
[28:45] head you're in the very time of the
[28:48] eagle God adds yes what's happening here
[28:52] small he's adding if you want it you can
[28:54] have it praise the Lord so we see it in
[28:57] that as I told brother makanda and then
[29:00] at the next Monday after I was out there
[29:03] and you heard that the testimony
[29:05] Wednesday uh-huh said them God put up on
[29:09] my heart to speak about Psalm 133 but
[29:12] the precious ointment that's what I want
[29:14] that oh the ointment that came down
[29:16] Aaron's beard amen floor all over his
[29:20] skirts don't you want that point that's
[29:22] what I want
[29:23] praise Allah feel it here this morning a
[29:25] man is Fitness all together every joint
[29:29] has this ointment on it sticks to one
[29:32] another anointing to anointing an eagle
[29:35] - eagle praise the Lord
[29:37] so now now we feel this way but Paul
[29:40] says in the seventeenth verse now
[29:42] brethren be followers together of me and
[29:44] more of him which walks so as you have
[29:46] us for an example now he's saying now a
[29:49] brethren together follow my example and
[29:52] I observe those who live after the
[29:54] pattern we have set for you so then
[29:57] those in here that will follow william
[29:58] Bram's example and paul's here in the
[30:01] bible
[30:01] mark dos brother they're on their way to
[30:04] heaven
[30:05] so it's all here Z go here Markham Amen
[30:08] and to get together with them Eagles
[30:09] that's on the way they are mature
[30:11] they're not they are the swaddling
[30:14] clothes putting on the wedding garment
[30:16] blessed be the name of the world right
[30:18] they know what they're doin see they're
[30:21] putting on their own wedding gown then
[30:23] like a little baby's got to get my
[30:25] bottle amen and wipe the noses know
[30:27] they're on their way to heaven praise
[30:30] the Lord so narrow mark go see other
[30:33] words don't compromise for the sake of
[30:36] unity and I ain't gonna compromise with
[30:39] nobody for the sake of unity I'm gonna
[30:41] be caring and in brotherly kindness and
[30:43] forgiving and loving but I'm not going
[30:46] to compromise with anybody or anything
[30:48] but the word of the Lord and lay it down
[30:51] word by word light upon line and precept
[30:54] upon precept here a little in there a
[30:56] little amen praise God
[30:58] so now I'm thinking about that but that
[31:01] there and the Holy Spirit spoke to my
[31:03] heart and said now the fire for ministry
[31:06] it'll be an anointing I was just
[31:08] meditating on a word I told him why I
[31:11] says Holy Spirit was showing when when
[31:13] when when brother Brennan went out in
[31:15] the field
[31:16] he had and anointing up on him that
[31:19] would bring them he'd say Baptist
[31:21] Methodist for square to square and so
[31:24] forth Jesus name let's all we are
[31:25] brothers that remember all your tapes we
[31:28] are brother it was an anointing of unity
[31:30] it's in the very age of unity everything
[31:33] is being a unified that's the anointing
[31:35] of the hour is to be unified you
[31:38] understand now and that's there so
[31:41] therefore here here we are with the
[31:43] faith restored but the people in the
[31:46] message don't seem to be in unity so
[31:49] when a fire for mercy goes forth the law
[31:52] is showing me that they will have an
[31:53] anointing of love to bring a unity of
[31:57] the faith then you'll know who is the
[31:59] fire for man so you know for it being
[32:02] anointing upon those individuals to
[32:05] bring the church into our unity of the
[32:07] faith to a perfect man unto the measure
[32:09] of the stature of the fullness of Jesus
[32:12] Christ your
[32:13] to worry you know it amen you know he
[32:16] won't have to say I'm the thigh full
[32:18] ministry
[32:19] know you'll know it brother and it'd be
[32:21] science fall on it and the love of God
[32:23] will be there with him so if what Paul
[32:25] is saying the same thing here the unity
[32:28] of the faith the faith itself is one
[32:30] body of truth and as we hold to this one
[32:34] body here this morning now see we are in
[32:36] turn uniting it to one another that's
[32:39] what I was saying Markham each one
[32:42] that's holding to the whole body of
[32:43] truth and you catch one here I saw
[32:46] several out there in Tucson that was
[32:47] holding to the body and all I did it was
[32:49] come with this anointing now for unity
[32:51] out there for the first message being
[32:54] the unity of the faith and then going
[32:57] through fire messages and winding up
[32:58] where there is a river that's what I
[33:01] preached out that there is a river and
[33:02] told me it's fall all over city and it's
[33:04] flowing and but it comes as your
[33:06] scripture hath said and laid it down
[33:09] they didn't know what was going on see I
[33:11] know what I was doing hey man I said it
[33:13] ain't nothing won't happen except Saint
[33:15] John 7:37 30 as just scripture has said
[33:18] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[33:21] living water there is a river and that
[33:25] was laid down and all how many of us
[33:27] rejoiced in here the word of the Lord
[33:30] and so now Paul was saying here if we
[33:33] hold to this faith itself this body of
[33:37] truth and we see this one in that when
[33:39] we begin to come together in unity we
[33:42] believe the whole body of revealed truth
[33:45] for the Lord Himself said when the Son
[33:47] of man returned it shall he find faith
[33:49] in the whole body of what Malachi 4
[33:52] revealed amen shall he find it and
[33:55] knowing that on the false no NAT tape he
[33:57] said if you're following the line of it
[33:59] he said here is Willie find it
[34:01] well Willie after these false northing
[34:03] ones go out will he find the faith he
[34:06] got it now so he returns back to find
[34:09] the faith and the the undie faithful and
[34:12] wise servant is tested not to ability
[34:16] but tested a corn to faithfulness
[34:20] faithfulness are you faithful and giving
[34:22] up the spiritual reveal food or did you
[34:25] change
[34:26] to some strange interpretation it's not
[34:29] your ability now but it is are you
[34:31] faithful that's why see what your little
[34:34] spoonful or are you faithful to the one
[34:37] spoonful not your ability now you may
[34:41] not be able to sing like this one in and
[34:43] beat like that one but are you faithful
[34:46] to what he give you
[34:47] then he'll bless you for that if you
[34:51] held on to tooth the seeds hold on to it
[34:55] a monkey and and be right Joe hold your
[34:58] ground
[34:59] the devil couldn't move Jobe he
[35:02] presented his little faithful sacrifice
[35:04] his burnt offering and he held his
[35:07] ground and he wouldn't move amen the
[35:11] church members come precious brothers
[35:14] sisters come talking against you what
[35:16] not amen but he held his ground he
[35:20] didn't care what they said those old
[35:21] church members praise the Lord even his
[35:23] wife spoke to him and cursed God and so
[35:26] for told like a foolish woman he held
[35:28] his ground if your husband says this
[35:31] hold your ground
[35:33] your wife says that hold your ground
[35:36] what they say God has revealed to you
[35:40] something hold it pull the cops
[35:42] unchanging hand if God has revealed he's
[35:46] going to heal hold to God's unchanging
[35:49] hand if God has with you today you are a
[35:52] member of the bride I don't care what
[35:55] they say and what happens in your life
[35:56] hold to what he has revealed to you you
[36:00] all might a channel of God I am your
[36:03] we'll hold to that amen that's it see an
[36:07] don't worry about the other man
[36:09] praise God Paul is saying here I pressed
[36:12] to ward in the fourteenth verse I
[36:15] pressed toward the mark for the prize of
[36:17] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[36:19] Paul is saying I press toward the goal
[36:22] to win the supreme and heavenly prize to
[36:27] which God and Christ Jesus calling us
[36:30] upward merica for call is out and this
[36:34] morning God is calling us up
[36:37] praise God is a voice of the
[36:40] resurrection calling us up hither
[36:42] this morning sees everything has had
[36:46] happened in the last ten and eight years
[36:48] forget about it this morning you've
[36:51] already placed heaven here to the Statue
[36:53] of a perfect man well he's calling up or
[36:57] heavenly calling this morning as has
[36:59] gone forth this morning praise God
[37:03] so Paul says not that he are already
[37:06] attained see he's Paul's looking here
[37:09] for he said if by any means I might
[37:12] attain unto the resurrection of the Dead
[37:14] any L or Minister anybody know that this
[37:17] means resurrection out from the dead see
[37:21] there's two resurrection at Malachi 4
[37:23] revealed to us and so therefore he said
[37:27] that he had not attained he hadn't
[37:30] reached that perfect state that
[37:32] glorified state that a resurrection yet
[37:34] so therefore he said if by any means I
[37:37] might attain being been very humble
[37:39] America for said they're almost the same
[37:41] words if I might be there that right see
[37:46] yeah and look what both of them had then
[37:48] who are we to run around here with and
[37:50] taking these a spoken word books in
[37:52] because I trusted them all up there
[37:53] anything say I already got it already
[37:54] when two prophets they said if by any
[37:57] means they might attain to the
[37:59] resurrection out from the dead did you
[38:03] hear what I said
[38:04] a resurrection out from the dead Church

[38:16] chance to hear a message from a

[41:35] forget about it left it all behind them
[41:37] genuine righteousness which comes from
[41:39] faith in Christ is all that he wanted
[41:41] once the Holy Spirit apprehended him on
[41:45] the road to Damascus God had a purpose
[41:48] and apprehending him so then he when he
[41:52] realized that God's purpose in his life
[41:54] was that he should be perfect and sit
[41:58] down and his strong with him then Paul
[42:01] was effort to apprehend Christ you got
[42:04] it Christ apprehended him for a purpose
[42:06] then Paul realize it he was mature then
[42:10] he was out after Christ's but at all
[42:12] course he was going to apprehend him

[43:07] receiving every word of God so therefore
[43:11] didn't win then if you reject one word
[43:13] then do not look for a glorified body in

[43:22] God has brought us or message where we
[43:24] are self

[45:27] here if by any means I can know him and
[45:31] Fellowship of his sufferings and know
[45:33] that here to taste it that I could do
[45:35] something here
[45:36] praise the Lord but I could be baptized
[45:38] with his baptism of sufferings as the
[45:41] early church was they forgot about
[45:44] everything else they had to wedding
[45:45] going on they were on the way to heaven
[45:47] praise the Lord they didn't care how
[45:49] they look you think brother bran worried
[45:51] about the styles when he had on the
[45:53] wedding garment he had a big texan head
[45:55] this way and a flowered tie and austere
[45:57] are looking suit
[45:58] it wasn't even thinking about it because
[46:00] levy i used to have to be could tell him
[46:02] how to dress what he care about this
[46:04] fashion of this world here brother here
[46:06] too they aged a lot all over top of him
[46:10] sighs or wonders he had to go on what he
[46:14] care about the fashion of the world
[46:16] praise the Lord
[46:17] amen but he wanted to know him is to
[46:21] experience a power that flows from a
[46:24] union praise God with the resurrected
[46:27] Jesus Christ and that's why I say if you
[46:29] don't have the Holy Ghost press into
[46:31] this Union for God has given you a
[46:33] promise and God cannot lie he's going to
[46:37] baptize you and it was only one thing

[46:45] yours by full obedience to every word si
[46:49] just obey every word he only tested you
[46:51] see if you believe the word and he gives
[46:53] you the Holy Ghost to Pruit you didn't
[46:55] believe for the word and you do believe
[46:57] the word so into into a Fellowship of
[46:59] his sufferings being conformed to his
[47:01] death don't you rest day or night until
[47:04] you experience this desire and remember
[47:06] brother brands vision of heaven he said

[47:22] the hours here when the green seed has
[47:24] matured and turning to this keeps coming
[47:27] to my heart the green seed has turned
[47:29] from a golden brown drying out brother

[47:42] Karina homestretch now now here's the
[47:45] home stretch right here see Philippians
[47:47] 3:12 not as though I had already
[47:50] attained either were we're already
[47:53] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[47:56] apprehend therefore which also I am
[47:58] apprehended of Christ and may I say at
[48:01] this morning don't look at me because
[48:03] I'm reading this right here so don't
[48:05] think that I have anything more than you
[48:07] not that I have attained brother new
[48:08] rule I follow after see I follow after
[48:12] so don't look at me and feel short maybe
[48:14] some of you might and if I go here if I
[48:17] go here I mean God is here he's paid
[48:20] present future here in the local
[48:23] Christian Assembly and got nothing to do
[48:26] with me going out of here just you pray
[48:28] for me where I'm going but he's here
[48:29] with you right here don't ever forget
[48:32] that
[48:32] see we're going nowhere we'll be there
[48:34] together praise the Lord Amen see don't
[48:38] get nervous now
[48:39] Amen brethren I count not myself to have
[48:42] apprehended you saying again here but
[48:44] this one thing I do sing here forgetting
[48:48] those things which are behind
[48:50] I can't reach back on anything that I've
[48:52] done now that be I'll make it
[48:54] righteousness mine own you see the me
[48:57] now it's been the grace of Almighty God
[48:59] I can't take one thing and he's done
[49:01] through me all by me I can't say well I
[49:03] knew the Lord say so I we all of the
[49:08] same boat this morning that's all going
[49:11] up to his glory
[49:12] you got it narrow sorry just say you
[49:15] know I'm driving this down because you
[49:16] don't what's going to happen see and you
[49:17] might be looking at me look at me you
[49:19] look at Christ
[49:20] Sica I need this at just as well as you
[49:22] need it yes sir praise the Lord
[49:24] forgetting those things which are behind
[49:26] and reaching forth unto those things
[49:27] which are before press toward the mark
[49:30] for the prize of the high calling of God
[49:32] in Christ Jesus
[49:33] now what Paul is doing here he's saying
[49:35] less he leave because the impression of
[49:38] having already arrived
[49:39] Paul carefully indicated he was still
[49:42] very much involved in the race of life
[49:44] and may I say by the grace of God unless
[49:47] you got any impression that I've got
[49:49] some kind of secret no uh-uh
[49:52] I am brother I am very much involved in
[49:54] the race of life I'm running for my life
[49:57] yes sir I'm running away from Satan for
[50:00] my life but I'm in a race and I got a
[50:03] goal I'm about your goal I know I gotta
[50:06] go sit him in and I'm looking for prize
[50:08] I'm not just in this race just water I
[50:10] being become saved no I'm in this for
[50:13] the prize this one prize first place I
[50:16] want it it's gold yes sir
[50:19] praise the Lord so now Paul here is
[50:21] cautioning against misinterpretations
[50:24] here I see but by there was in his Asia
[50:27] was those who were spreading around a
[50:29] little gospel that they were already
[50:30] perfect and whatnot and don't we had
[50:33] that same
[50:34] today soon as brother brown says malachi
[50:37] falls come here which is perfect is come
[50:38] everything is perfect that's all I heard
[50:40] there's someone because acknowledging
[50:42] and it they've been through that for is
[50:44] the Lord see and we've been through
[50:45] fighting it for ten years that we
[50:47] already perfect just wait for the tenth
[50:49] and all these things here no we don't
[50:51] want that in this church here brother we
[50:52] want some people here
[50:53] thus mind like Paul was pressing on
[50:55] toward the mark of the high calling Amen
[50:58] praise the Lord so we don't want that at
[51:00] ease in Zion spirit here you know we
[51:03] just want to have some hot coals in it
[51:05] in them seats there Amen see so narrow
[51:08] believe the message and all everything
[51:10] is fine forget about it see now that
[51:12] which Paul had not already attained was
[51:15] the experience of a complete and final
[51:18] knowledge of the Lord
[51:20] that's that perfect state that we all
[51:21] want to come to see and he said that I
[51:24] may know him don't ever stop don't keep
[51:28] on keeping on as we would say Amen see I
[51:32] have not attained myself I'm just a
[51:34] green seed trusting that I'll be got
[51:36] that I'm golden brown this morning
[51:38] that's the same as you are Amen but I
[51:40] feel with all my heart is jumping off a
[51:44] few things here I feel that we are right
[51:46] in the homestretch
[51:48] for Paul he was in the homestretch here
[51:50] Paul said but I press on strenuously if
[51:53] somehow I may overtake in lay hold of
[51:56] that which which I was taken captive by
[51:59] Christ Jesus on the deep the Damascus
[52:02] Road so now um God has a purpose and in
[52:06] your conversion and he wants you to
[52:08] press on for this prize amen see and
[52:12] that is the purpose is for you to be in
[52:14] his bride he had asked why this thing in
[52:17] you is beating out if you have a self
[52:19] style in Zion you would even worry about
[52:21] it
[52:21] you see well I'll be up dumb say Eve and
[52:23] so forth no but this pressing you and
[52:25] God put that deep in here searching and
[52:28] reaching and scratching and biting out
[52:30] there for something and he's got it hey
[52:32] man you know satisfy see praise the Lord
[52:35] now this nut yet state of Christian
[52:39] perfection see it destroys complacency
[52:43] you know everything is alright
[52:45] everything
[52:46] fine the lowest business here in New
[52:47] York no pets they come back and shake
[52:50] them up don't know and a feel all fine
[52:52] because so-and-so ain't got it out there
[52:54] maybe but shake them up and keep them on
[52:56] the toes that's what the Holy Spirit's
[52:58] doing right now you know keep you on
[52:59] your toes see and it demands a strenuous
[53:02] pursuit half of the price Amen see now
[53:06] Paul gives an illustration here in the
[53:09] 13th verse this one thing I do I press
[53:12] on this is like a foot race here see now
[53:14] he said the one thing here is singleness
[53:16] of purpose and concentration of effort
[53:20] that everything would be internet now
[53:22] not legalism now so yeah when you're
[53:25] preaching like people understand talk
[53:27] about no legalism see I mean just giving
[53:29] your heart to God and sweetness and
[53:31] nothing we can do in saying God all I
[53:34] can do is have the right attitude that's
[53:36] all I meant that's all he's asking it
[53:38] the right attitude that you don't want
[53:40] the things of the world but then he'll
[53:42] perfects you and take it away from you
[53:44] but don't you try to do it in yourself
[53:46] and think brother Coleman our brother
[53:48] Coleman said now we should be pressing
[53:50] and you pressing sweating now I talk
[53:52] about that no I'm just oppressing you
[53:55] just walk at ease and the Lord bless you
[53:57] and go on what you pressing you see the
[53:59] man now that's what I'm talking about
[54:01] I'm sorry I'm scar I mean what I do
[54:04] yesterday no that's not pressing that's
[54:06] a legalism say forget about that I don't
[54:08] mean it at all it's just a comon on here
[54:10] and at a funeral service drop this off
[54:13] because to your sisters there's a spirit
[54:16] that the women have to be if they serve
[54:19] their husband they serving God which is
[54:21] true and a lot of them fall back on and
[54:24] that's it and she's sitting here and
[54:25] this this brother was speaking about
[54:27] this sister who had just died she was a
[54:28] real precious sister and this poor
[54:31] sister was writing down everything he
[54:33] was saying she's I've done that I've
[54:35] done this I've done that then he got to
[54:37] certain things she said but she didn't
[54:38] do that and she was say it right there
[54:40] and here my wife sitting right there and
[54:43] wanting to tell of course Christ did
[54:45] that there for you already
[54:46] she couldn't say nothing you understand
[54:48] now we've seen that and my wife sat
[54:50] right next to this sister to a big man
[54:53] out there and she was wanting to please
[54:55] her husband as just man was saying that
[54:57] this sister had done and she was right
[54:59] and everything
[55:00] you see you write down what's in here
[55:03] you automatically please him most of all
[55:06] him hey if you do what's written down in
[55:09] here put on your ears and your eyes and
[55:12] everywhere what's here so yes that's
[55:15] legalism now that's trying to do this
[55:17] here that's a that's a call
[55:19] impersonation just let God come in and
[55:22] do it
[55:22] amen see and so Paul here is it struck
[55:25] me this morning it's a beautiful thing

[1:01:43] subjection praise God now Paul claims
[1:01:46] over here to be running the race to win

[1:03:11] away what about a Christian that God has
[1:03:14] trainers for incorruptible crown how
[1:03:17] much more should we be ready to run the
[1:03:19] race I read a story about a little later
[1:03:22] learning to ride a bicycle he proudly
[1:03:25] told his sister I'm moving I'm really
[1:03:27] moving she calmly said to him as she was
[1:03:30] observing his wobbly progress she said
[1:03:33] you are moving but you're not going
[1:03:35] amen see so don't shadowboxing air fight
[1:03:39] the fight to win the match run to win
[1:03:42] the race notice now all are in the race
[1:03:46] of life but only one wins the prize so
[1:03:50] this morning we all in the race to the
[1:03:52] resurrection sure we all saved
[1:03:54] but Paul Tom are out from the general
[1:03:56] resurrection to the first resurrection
[1:03:58] that's surprised oh my just think we're
[1:04:03] going back to the beginning back to acts
[1:04:06] 2:38 one Lord one faith one baptism of
[1:04:09] the Holy Ghost one God who's in all
[1:04:12] that's where we are friends
[1:04:14] are you in a church triumphant or you
[1:04:16] know save his bride and God wouldn't
[1:04:19] have a word message if he didn't have a
[1:04:21] power God to back it up
[1:04:23] don't worry that extra kick is coming
[1:04:27] down the homestretch it's gonna take us
[1:04:30] the last 30 or 40 yards oh don't you
[1:04:33] love him praise his name Amen well thank
[1:04:38] the Lord isn't wonderful to know look
[1:04:41] this way we're gonna be in the sweet bye
[1:04:43] and bye amen praise God remember to keep
[1:04:49] your body under and Paul didn't want his
[1:04:53] body his soul to become a slave to his
[1:04:56] body so he had a personal sacrifice of
[1:05:00] walking with God sacrifice of things not
[1:05:03] necessary evil but which prevent the
[1:05:06] full devotion of the soul to God
[1:05:08] such as pleasures and worldly pursuits
[1:05:12] excuse me this is the age of luxury and
[1:05:15] the words have a real significance in
[1:05:18] our time this things that maybe not
[1:05:21] smoking and drinking like that but the
[1:05:23] other things that will keep you away
[1:05:24] from full devotion so Paul
[1:05:26] realizing these things here he fought
[1:05:28] and he brought his body under I'm
[1:05:31] thinking about a dream that brother
[1:05:34] brother down here in a tabernacle had
[1:05:37] but a ram spoke to him in a dream
[1:05:39] this brother Boris was telling me and he
[1:05:42] says you're worrying about all the
[1:05:44] ministers falling away stop worrying
[1:05:47] about him falling away he says anointed
[1:05:49] people would all and pray for the sick
[1:05:50] there may yet be a little time left and
[1:05:53] we fellowship with him and I just struck
[1:05:56] my heart revelation 22:17 the spirit and
[1:05:59] the bride say come
[1:06:00] so I didn't say a word but there was
[1:06:02] brother Bremen a dream telling the the
[1:06:04] pastors and it have Knakal the anointing
[1:06:06] with oil and pray for to sing don't you
[1:06:08] know what that is friends that's get in
[1:06:10] order we've done that here amen
[1:06:14] Bible order and God I just read it to
[1:06:17] you it's such a time as a senior than a
[1:06:19] barn member December 30 we we spoke on
[1:06:22] it she put it in order he has a dream
[1:06:24] too who brother Collins there he said
[1:06:26] don't worry about the minister what
[1:06:28] they're doing you stand faithfully what
[1:06:30] a vindication that is to brother honey
[1:06:32] and myself here we did what here comes a
[1:06:35] dream the prophet of God tell him
[1:06:36] brother colors in the tabernacle forget
[1:06:38] about the ministers falling away and
[1:06:40] what they think and what they say on
[1:06:41] knowing and what all and pray for the
[1:06:43] sick there may yet be a little time left
[1:06:45] you know what that means don't you pray
[1:06:47] for the sick just signs when as the
[1:06:49] mirrors are gonna follow it
[1:06:50] praise God amen then there's brother
[1:06:54] heard the brothers was telling me two
[1:06:58] different variations of what he said -
[1:07:00] brother Sam currently out west here and
[1:07:03] he said that he asked brother Branham at
[1:07:04] the fire for ministry burns did not know
[1:07:06] more than that meanings in the fire for
[1:07:07] ministry another brother just told me
[1:07:10] that he said he sat down at they'd be
[1:07:12] five minutes let's go in the rapture no
[1:07:15] I don't I didn't I didn't speak to the
[1:07:17] man but boy is sure shaking I don't know
[1:07:20] what he meant by that but I'm believing
[1:07:22] the word
[1:07:22] I'm pressing on towards a mohawk myself
[1:07:25] I'm lining up myself with 2nd
[1:07:29] Corinthians 4 11 and 12 death to me and
[1:07:31] life to you I'm lining up myself with
[1:07:33] first Timothy 4:12 be an example before
[1:07:36] the flock an example in indeed and
[1:07:38] peered in charity and spirit
[1:07:40] you see what I'm talking about here so
[1:07:43] no doubt is something I always believe
[1:07:44] there's going to be few and everyone's
[1:07:47] in the race so let us run this race
[1:07:51] praise God for the prize now remember
[1:07:55] this morning there's nothing that we can
[1:07:58] do and Paul says here he did these thing
[1:08:02] to ministry now he did his things he
[1:08:05] says he says over here and first
[1:08:08] Corinthians 9 just want to drop this off
[1:08:10] to you that you know it's a tremendous
[1:08:12] responsibility here friends but I keep
[1:08:15] under my body and bring it into
[1:08:17] subjection lest that by any means when i
[1:08:20] have preached to others i myself should
[1:08:23] be a castaway he doesn't lose the
[1:08:25] salvation you tell my a crown here
[1:08:28] saying not salvation but i'm on a crown
[1:08:30] so now he's speaking here at the the
[1:08:34] when if you run track you sit around and
[1:08:37] you wait under the stands in the stands
[1:08:39] and a hero calls your race all those who
[1:08:43] are going to running in the 40 for the
[1:08:45] 440 - go to the mark see somebody calls
[1:08:49] that out and go to the market get ready
[1:08:50] for the next race well that same word
[1:08:53] has to do what a preacher in the greek
[1:08:56] so a preacher calls you to the race of
[1:09:00] life the gospel by the gospel then after
[1:09:04] the preacher calls you to the race of
[1:09:06] life all the same here himself that but
[1:09:09] he keeps under his body lest he should
[1:09:12] be a castaway disproved you understand
[1:09:16] so brother that's where we stand this
[1:09:19] more in the ministry I just just
[1:09:22] repeated that about brother Sam County I
[1:09:24] don't be caught in here that I don't
[1:09:25] know what that's all about
[1:09:26] but I'm just saying it really keeps me
[1:09:28] on the mark that's what I'm saying if to
[1:09:30] myself for so therefore Paul's saying
[1:09:33] here he's summoned many to the race of
[1:09:36] Christian
[1:09:36] life through the gospel you did it not
[1:09:38] to become a castaway that after the word
[1:09:41] means disapproved so he didn't want to
[1:09:43] be that scene and but clearly the
[1:09:46] Prophet here apostle was concerned let C
[1:09:49] be B because b we are rejected by the
[1:09:52] umpire for the prize so I'm doing my
[1:09:55] surprise Amen sing it's the goal of the
[1:09:58] pricee he had no fear of the hero
[1:10:02] barring him from the race for he said
[1:10:04] all run the race you got it now so we
[1:10:09] all in the race so everybody's in the
[1:10:11] race but what he was talking about a
[1:10:13] fear of this prize asked the thing
[1:10:15] saying but all not all received a prize
[1:10:17] and Paul wanted to receive the prize
[1:10:20] what prize you're talking about brother
[1:10:22] Coleman the one in the sweet by and by
[1:10:25] shall we stand in sweet
[1:10:30] hi
[1:10:34] we shell me
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:39] for sure in the sweet
[1:10:47] by
[1:10:51] we show me on that you G for sure
