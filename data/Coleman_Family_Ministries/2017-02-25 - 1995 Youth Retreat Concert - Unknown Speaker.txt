Oh Lord, I pray that you will bless these meetings. Lord, may you bless the concert tonight. Bless the preaching services and the video service. Lord, may it be such an anointing. Lord, may it be all in one accord, one mind. Oh, one faith. Oh [Applause] my. I pray your sweet spirit come down here tonight, Lord, and stay with us and dwell with us, Lord. Is anyone hungering after God, Lord? Many know where there's a well tonight, Lord. Oh, they thirst after you, Lord. You're here. Oh, they need you. You're here. Blessed be his name. You may be Amen. Blessed be his name. You may be actually remain standing. I'm just going to read a portion of scripture. You don't have to find it. It's 2 Chronicles the 20th chapter. Verse 21. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the Lord, the the praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, "Praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever." And when they began to sing and to praise the Lord, the Lord said ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come against Judah, and they were smitten. Amen. I pray the Lord had a blessing to read the word. You may be seated. Amen. This is exactly what we're going to go on this weekend. We're about to go out into a mighty battle. Amen. In this battle, the souls of many young people sitting here are hinging on the victory or defeat cuz we know we have come to the end of time as we know it. And we're waiting for the coming of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Yet, there are still some people who may be questioning and may be wondering and there's still some people who are seeking the baptism in the Holy Ghost. So, there's a battle that's going to go on this weekend. So, we're going to go out the first night. We're singing and praise. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated. And we know that as we sing and as we praise, the Lord God will send ambushments against the the Moabs and the Ammonites and any other spirit that dwells in the camp. Amen. Blessed be his name. You may be seated. That's why I'm not concerned about the way that you came in here today. It doesn't bother me. Amen. You may be seated. Because as bad as some people may think they are, and as hard as they are, I've seen harder. I've seen tougher. And I've seen them come to the altar with tears streaming down their face. And the Holy Spirit changed them. Amen. And you may be seated. But the only key is that there a seat of God. And that's a choice you have to make tonight. Amen. You may be seated because believe me, I didn't beg anyone to come here. And I didn't call you up at your home. I didn't tell your mama, your daddy, the son, you here. You're here cuz you want to be here. Amen. So, it's up to you whether you let this situation pass you by and go into judgment or you grab a hold of God and go into glory. Amen. Cuz otherwise, Amen. You may be seated. Amen. I'm sorry to get over there, but I'm happy to be here tonight cuz I know you want to be here. I know you're on fire. I know you came here for God. Blessed be his name. Let's be his name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. I feel the Holy Spirit in here tonight. I can see angels standing around here. Amen. You may be seated. Blessed be his name. I just want to officially welcome each and everyone here tonight. Amen. And I want to apologize. I know the conditions are cramped in the cabin and I know some people have to be in a separate camp, but I want you to know that it was our desire to be able to have as many young people that wanted to be here to come here. Amen. We could have closed the door at 350 or 400, but we knew if there's one soul out there that wanted to be here and they should be here. So, it may be a sacrifice, but one that we're happy to make. Amen. And I know it's crowded in here tonight. I believe every seat is taken. But I can imagine it was crowded when you were in the upper room. And I can imagine it was crowded on Iusa Street and I know it was crowded. We're up in the chapel back up there in 1993, but the Holy Spirit was there. It didn't matter. Amen. You may be seated. And you know what? I kind of like when it's crowded because and the spirits can't hide. They try to hide in the back and the Holy Spirit's back there. They try to hide in the side and the Holy Spirit's back there. Everywhere they look, there's angels. Everywhere they look, the glory of God, nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide. Blessed be his name. We're going to have a service tonight. Amen. The Holy Spirit will sweep out here. Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated. Blessed be his name. Amen. So, we're switching over tonight. I I know I enjoyed myself today in the activities and I pray that you did. But that's not why you traveled all these miles to be here. That's not why you came from England and France and Trinidad and Puerto Rico and Canada and across the United States. Amen. You came here to meet God. Now, here's your opportunity. Amen. Blessed be his name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. So, I just want to just encourage everyone and warn everyone that now that we're switched over, it's time to leave the foolishness behind. Time to leave the carnality behind. Amen. I know it's excited to be here and you see different ones and maybe up all night talking and so forth, but it's time now to switch over. I want Amen. It's time now to focus on these things. Amen. Because the Holy Spirit's here, and the Holy Spirit is not just here in this chapel, but he's with you, and you're going to take him back to your room. Amen. So there should be an atmosphere in your room that if someone is ready to be baptized with the Holy Ghost, they can be filled right in the room that the angel feels welcome to open your door and step into your cabin. Amen. So enough. Amen. So it's time to focus. And I believe if you come here with the right attitude, if you come here with desperation, if you come here with a hunger, if you come here with respect for God's servants and God's people and keep the worldliness out and keep the foolishness out, there is no reason that God can't drop down and give you a personal experience. Do you believe that? And give the Lord a hand of praise. And feel free tonight to worship. Feel free tonight to praise because the Holy Spirit is already here. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. I will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow. Oh my I know I will praise. Lift your hands to heaven now. I will praise the Lord. Choir, would you come forward? I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow, what it has, it's everybody sing now. I will praise the Lord. Oh Jesus. No matter what tomorrow brings, I I know I will. One more time. Well, now I from your heart now. Oh Jesus high. Oh no matter. It doesn't matter what tomorrow brings. I know I will praise the Lord. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Glory. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You may be seated. Amen. How many know that he's worthy tonight? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. As we were just saying a little bit before, if you can get a picture tonight of John when he was in Revelation five. Amen. And how when he got caught up into that vision and there he was not not there was nobody there that was worthy to open the book or to look upon the names in that book. Amen. But all of a sudden, out of the throne walked a bleeding, bloody lamb. Hallelujah. And I can imagine John as a lamb of God came forth to pick the book out of the master's hand and he opened that book. Mind the screams and the shouts. The Bible says that everyone heard I John on that day. So we just want to give back a little glory to him tonight by singing He's Worthy. Amen. May God bless you. Worthy, God worthy, almighty, creator, king, holy, holy, God almighty and worthy, worthy, almighty, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty and comel. [Applause] We take glory and power to my stand forever.

And in that atmosphere, you can receive whatsoever your heart desires tonight. You may be seated. Just as an introduction to the song that I sing tonight, just a quote that really struck my heart and I pray that it will bless you. Brother Brandham said unto see Jesus, "Let your faith," like the blind man, let your faith, like the woman that touched his garment, stood back out there meekly. She had a consolation. She was in the meeting. She knew that her faith touched him some way. He turned around. He looked over the audience and said, "Thy faith has healed thee. Your blood issues stopped." In other words, she was healed. That's Jesus today. That's him today. Now, let's all softly sing this song, Only Believe, just once. The organist will give us a chord. All right. And he goes and he sings a verse of only believe. He is here now. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I take every spirit in my control for God's glory. for a manifestation of the resurrection of his son. The Holy Spirit is here.

So when that rapture come, there'll be nothing nothing holding me from being free. Cuz being left out here is just like the sun going down on me. Lord have mercy on me. Listen.

If you've never been in a meeting like this before, or if you've been going to meetings like this for 20 years, if there's something you need to make right with God, there's no more time, friends.

I'm just telling you the plain facts. It's not to scare you, but it's the truth. The problem today in a message around the world everywhere is they won't tell the truth. Hallelujah. [Applause] But I thank God I'm where I'm at. [Music] If the truth hurts, it's only hurting your flesh, but it's saving your soul. Hey, praise him. [Music] Don't let the sun I don't want the sun to go down on me. That's why I'm searching myself now. Cuz in your word I want to be and I don't want nothing. I don't want I don't need nothing. I don't need nothing holding me. I don't want nothing holding me down here. Cuz being left down here is just like the sun going down. Don't let the sun go down on me. Oh, don't let the sun.

But I am so glad, so glad. Hallelujah. That I can still hear that voice, that I can still feel that Holy Spirit moving in my heart. Amen. I'll tell you a story. There's a story about a little boy who went out to go playing, right? And his story, it's a true story from what I know. He went out down the street, 3 years old, and got lost when he went out to play. And while he was wandering around, he began to cry. And so the neighbors begin to come out and they asked the little boy, they said, "What's the matter?" And he said to them, "Well, I'm lost. I don't know where I'm at. And he was so excited he couldn't remember anything of a telephone number or an address or anything like that. So they called the police and when the police came, they asked him, they began to ask him questions about who his parents was and so forth. And he was too excited, was too upset about where he was at. They didn't know he was all frightened and frustrated. So they said, "Is there anything, oh my, that you can remember?" He said, "I can remember a white church with a big white cross on the top of it." And he said, "Well, if I could find my way back to that cross, he said, now I could find my way back home." He said, "If I could find my way back to that call," he said, "Now I could find my way back home." So many of us, so many of us are just like that little boy. We stray away from home and away from God. Amen. We can't seem to find a way because we're headed in the wrong direction. We started to depend on material things instead of God for your protection. Go back and repent for all the wrong you've done. Renew your right spirit within and ask God to receive your home. And you can say like that little boy, if I could find my way to that old rugged cross, I could find my way back home. Hallelujah. If you're losing hope and find yourself drifting away, you need to go back to the altar. Fall down on your knees and pray. Come on. The blood of Jesus was shed on Calvary so that every man, woman, boy, and girl could have life eternally. Come on to the cross. Do it today. Don't don't don't wait. Don't wait for tomorrow cuz tomorrow might be too late. Go back to the cross. Do it today. Just like that little boy. Just like that little boy. You can say Ille. They're coming. Yes.
