[3:48] uh
[3:50] brother riddle informed me that i
[3:51] believe the one one of the groups came

[4:00] twice for the morning service just to
[4:02] let you know that we're watching these
[4:04] things
[4:06] amen so because if we do it any other
[4:08] way then it'll mess up the the lord's
[4:11] supper so to be changing back and forth
[4:13] too much
[4:15] so what the lord will see to it that you
[4:17] will uh get your due
[4:20] you're not going to lose anything
[4:23] wrong maybe it's testing your attitude i
[4:25] don't know amen

[4:28] way that we can do it
[4:29] because we don't have enough room so we
[4:31] have to do the best we can
[4:34] and you know that uh the holy spirit i
[4:36] didn't know what was going on what would
[4:38] be going on this year

[36:51] there's a fruit fixing to come forth in
[36:53] the bright time
[36:55] and ripen green
[36:56] number two then the harvest has come
[36:59] if the fruit is fixing to come forth
[37:01] then the harvest is here because it's
[37:02] fruit
[37:05] it's in the top of the tree
[37:09] mature green
[37:11] number four i'm talking about now the
[37:13] word
[37:14] amen
[37:15] the message the germ
[37:18] hallelujah
[37:19] glory
[37:22] then the harvesters come and my my
[37:24] message is but when the fruit is brought
[37:25] forth the harvest is come so i'm
[37:27] prophesying
[37:28] [Music]
[37:29] amen malachi 4 has sold every seed in
[37:32] the bible from genesis to revelation
[37:34] can you say amen
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:37] amen did you receive the new book
[37:40] seven church changes and uh
[37:42] uh the invasion of the usa
[37:45] amen
[37:46] praise god everything right on time
[37:49] seven church ages page three so you know
[37:51] what i'm talking about
[37:52] paragraph 17 and preaching now you can
[37:55] jot it down there are some people that
[37:57] are preachers they can pick up the word
[37:59] with inspiration
[38:02] amen
[38:03] see and sway it out there in places
[38:07] that's that's watering the seeds that
[38:10] the teacher has taught
[38:13] so
[38:14] you know like a seven thunder
[38:16] inspiration brother ralph will fall upon
[38:18] here and there not everybody in the
[38:20] message just here and there
[38:22] and then they can preach it out there
[38:23] and sway them in those places
[38:26] you know
[38:26] 700 revival prayers swam praise god
[38:31] see but they are wait he said here now
[38:34] these men are not bringing anything new
[38:36] now
[38:37] no honestly the teacher already taught
[38:41] it's in books and forms
[38:43] is everywhere
[38:45] that's why these men say uh get the
[38:47] seven church changes get the servants
[38:49] here so you know what i'm talking about
[38:52] i'll take the tapes of the prophet
[38:55] see
[38:56] because these men know that unless you
[38:58] have these seeds well they can fall a
[38:59] water on top of you you get a blessing
[39:01] in here and you go outside your blank
[39:04] and money you're dead again amen praise
[39:07] god see these men know that
[39:09] now they can pick up the word with
[39:11] inspiration
[39:12] and sway it out then places that's
[39:16] watering the seeds that the teacher has
[39:19] taught
[39:20] now you got to put some seed in first
[39:23] and then water it
[39:28] hallelujah
[39:29] and the watering comes from the
[39:31] preaching of the word
[39:34] let us go and preach the word
[39:38] amen
[39:39] so now if the prophet ordained me to do
[39:42] what to preach the word
[39:44] to water the seeds
[39:47] anybody around but they get mad at me
[39:49] amen i'm ordained to do this here now
[39:52] don't get mad at me
[39:54] i'm only watering the seeds
[39:57] well you don't believe me open bible one
[39:59] corinthians three amen
[40:01] and uh paul said here's a three and i
[40:05] brethren cannot speak unto you as
[40:06] something spiritual but that's unto
[40:08] carnal
[40:09] fleshly fleshy even as unto babes and
[40:12] crimes i have fed you with milk and not
[40:14] with me
[40:15] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[40:17] it neither yet now or you're able
[40:20] for you're not for ye yet carnal for
[40:23] whereas there's among your indian strife
[40:25] and divisions are ye not carnal and walk
[40:27] as men
[40:28] for while one said i'm a paul i'm a
[40:30] apollos are you not carnal
[40:33] see
[40:34] who then is paul who is apollos see but
[40:37] ministers by whom he believed even as
[40:39] the lord gave to every man i have
[40:42] planted paul said apollo is wanted but
[40:44] god gave the increase
[40:47] malachi 4 planted we watered but god
[40:50] will give the increase
[40:53] god will bring forth the fruit
[40:56] so don't look at me
[41:00] brother coleman's no brother copeland
[41:01] didn't say that he said what the what
[41:03] the prophet said
[41:04] say brother branham said here brother
[41:06] brown said they don't say brother cohen
[41:07] said
[41:09] i'm saying what he said but see babes
[41:11] want to grab a man
[41:14] with skin on
[41:16] because the other man's going to heaven
[41:18] they don't see him
[41:19] they see you there so they say brother
[41:21] coleman said
[41:23] they even say sister coleman said
