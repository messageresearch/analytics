scriptures directly for the first time and I took a st. looks 17 26 through 30 and revelation 10 1 through 7 the exact message and the Holy Spirit's I'm gonna thin negate it so therefore the seven thunders shout message to cloud was the seven angels in the cloud and I turn it it's about time to turn the picture from the mechanics to the dynamics and that's what you're feeling here tonight I can't turn the picture back I'll already turn it this way I cannot turn it back it's been turned I turned it here way in October you didn't even get it I turned it down in Maryland and I turned it

now for me to have fellowship and I've been tight a tight rope like I've been walking at 1974 which is seven years this is the end of seven years so was this been trying to stay right with what their prophets saying and you call all kind of names your quota and priests along and put in the coat but that was a season amen you had to identify what the prophets said amen the season the quotes of in there for the resurrection power can come upon the word and when the resurrection power came the first half and they remembered his words now all the promises have been poured into you by the ministry and which you've read what God has shown you now anything can happen to leave us out of this amen because the promise is in you the siege herb is in the body like in hillier amen so therefore has been a wonderful time of fellowship to be here this is my third visit to South Africa and certainly appreciate it brother hunter preaching amen I mean appreciate appreciate a man it's just a hunter singing it was a real blessing and I know Brotherhood sir and I remember when he first came to the revelation of the seven thunders and met him the first time in February 1976 and he was there and he been through a whole lot so he was come to spy out the land amen but he gave a true report amen for the Prophet said himself in paradox 1961 Lord may you break these seals us to enter into Canaan land on the back of the book amen so we all know that the shadow of Joshua 18 was the thunders and because a Caleb that he had already asked for his inheritance and Joseph's sons Manasseh and Ephraim they asked for their a man because of Judah and the scepter the authorities with Judah and Joseph had the land blessed but had to be seated together amen and then the five wise virgins ants were there but seemed like he was still tired and the Holy Spirit ahead moved from Gilgal the place of the night cutting the flesh and move over the shallow amen except the shell at the park the shadow come and the authority is with you now a man in over there Joshua had to rebuke the seven tribes had to refute the church and in the message 15 years and you haven't gone out to get your inheritance didn't you see Caleb say give me my mountain you didn't see that what's wrong with you amen how are they sweat to go and possess the land give us familiars on every try and get out there and divide the land into seven parts what you see write it and put it in a book Amen but don't get all excited until you bring the book back to me charity and I'll make sure you've got the correct amen so I don't worry about what they tell me tomorrow because Joshua is the Holy Spirit and Joshua told the elders you better bring me the correct seven parts every Valley you see every stream of water everything it looks good right and divided into seven parts and if you have a great revelation please God you shall have you and here [Music] amen so we certainly enjoyed her brother how'd I get over there I thought my

as drinking and smoking and doing things that he should not do filthy habit of the flesh amen then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and thus we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:12 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and we believe that the hospitable Leafs will live sanctify with their wives and we believe that the Prophet said don't do no dirty filthy things with your lives [Music] [Applause] let me tell your sister you're not on Oh punish your no man with a dirty unclean spirit hallelujah free you can tell that man I'm not gonna submit to you we believe in sanctification we are not no hypocrites in here listen here husband you got a dirty lowdown spread get in here it gets sanctified I get out of the house of God [Applause] racecar team everybody have a clean house here the Holy Spirit knows what's going on behind the closed door hallelujah yes Sarah [Applause] we believe in sanctification is taught a new Testament not your sanctification a man which we're now living and we also believe in effort a person has been sanctified on clean habit has gone to them dirty habits are gone [Applause] he's a believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he's a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost not before we believe that you get a haircut we believe you let down your dresses neatly not before are you sanctified hallelujah is good you get nothing do you understand what I'm saying you're not a candidate for the Holy Ghost until you're sanctified until the filthy unclean dirty low-down spirits are gone [Music] EEMA yes sir hallelujah praise God want to get this church clean up in here [Applause] a man's which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer is just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out of the chicken yard justification is picking up ready to use it with a purpose and heart that's what God does to the sin he picked us up he picked you up for birth for purpose and what do you mean walking around here that God don't love me the devil told me this here he picked you up on purpose he picked you up you can take a joke born of an ass [Applause] what are you chase ten thousand demons that's a purpose God picked you up or he you were dead and sin quicken you quicken you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] or purpose that he had that's what God does to the sinner he is still filthy then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means clean and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar sanctified the vessel and it was set aside for service excuse me we believe that the Holy Spirit is put in the same vessel in service that the Holy Spirit is not another step of grace but more of the same grace that fills the believer to the extent where the signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in first Corinthians 12 manifests themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gifts I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts in calling or without repentance that when we are born in this world we are sent here for one purpose that is of God and that before we are even become adults while we are yet children the gift that we have of God is in us then and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and prophets and gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according there now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and it should be in every church now we believe in water baptism in the Branham tabernacle by immersing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic teaching of the Bible and may all members of us or come as 2008 amen or comers to the Branham tabernacle who desire such made any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus may he consult a pastor if they have repented and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ have passed the will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the fellowship of the believers we believe that water baptism we are brought into a fellowship so many in here are enough fellowship but you're not in the body of Christ yet Amen you in the fellowship of the seven seals seven thunders as to fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we are brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world and that's what you're striving for the night not to just be enough fellowship in New York in this message but to be enough fellowship of the body of Jesus Christ and don't you stop and don't you sell your birthright and who is this filthy flesh you say that I don't feel this and I don't feel it as filthiness before God when God picked you up for purpose quicken you you were dead in your sins what do you mean walking around here with unbelief what do you mean walking around here negative in a negative dirty lowdown spirit God said so God said so God said so praise God God dropped a third pulling here you heard me say stand to your feet are you insane don't you know what that was this is Timothy over here and you let that slip away like a low praise God but God said turn that picture back again put it in your face I'm here so I never gonna let you forget it and the Holy Ghost is another witness and he won't let you forget it for he will confirm what I'm saying by signs wonders and miracles he will back up the minister he'll back your brother hunt like he did this morning he'll back up by the mean always God he'll back up these Deacons we don't care what you think about the Deacons card will pack a bomb [Applause] we're his goddamn and plenty with nobody in here another thing that we believe the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal and we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating the church which we covered and desire that the people are gifted by the spirit come and worship with us I think first every member or every worshipper of the bram tabernacle she being such so much in divine love with each other until it was their hearts would long for each other now being and divine love with what each other doesn't mean to go to your brother said you know I think brother Coleman is mean that ain't divine love that's a devil let me say it good that's a demon that will go into his brother and speak against me or anybody astray that's our devil from hell a demon in you speaking out of your filthy mouth peni yes sir drive it down good getting you sanctify it why because I'm crazy cuz I want to see you get the Holy Ghost I want to see every unclean demon leave amen oh my prays got into their hearts but alone for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I'm a true believer in divine love the Apostle Paul said that there was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man all man will know what you're my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for another and we believe that it is the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to this earth to die for all of us God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life and they everlasting life is God's own life because we become sons and daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised see I have the baptism I cannot go along with the garbage to filth the cursing I can't because I have the seed in me and to see to me the word for this they cries out against the church members it condemns you already condemned I'm preaching to you now and I'll stand on the day of judgment when try to call me forth and I say Lord I spoke to them in season out of season hallelujah correct they were all along later on praise God and tonight all man's blood is off of my hands everyone in here tonight you know I have not failed please God not shun to declare the whole Council of God to you when you need or whip in a lathe ax to the root where needed to repeat you I rebuke you to your face I tell you to your face a man I'm not playing with nobody a man for three years or so church members come running at me praise God he told me so you going on your cross let them come but they gonna be packed out her a sky so every one of them they had one thing to say the past three years God's fixing to back them out every one of them hallelujah praise God may that fire burn in there and make that seat hot and if you have spoken rape race gotta get right with God amen so what kind of people are baptized devout people x.25 were baptized then obedience when the Word of God cut through their men and brethren what shall we do to be saved repent and be baptized amen then when the Holy Spirit pricked Paul and Paul said Lord I am Jesus then Paul said Lord what wilt thou have me to do obedience and then Cornelius gave his arms and prayers and fell down to worship respects for the ministry praise God and then while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell why because catch kaneda's had received the word and a sea germ was in Peter and Peter spoke the word and the Holy Spirit is the word and why you're so in the word for seven years you're sowing the Holy Ghost you're taking all of the promises in the message and you're sowing as a seed then those that have received a seed they're ready the same seed word turns into spirit then here come the foolish virgins asking for some oil how can they get it when the oil was Bale SC here comes some foolish Persians that sit in here and thought I was mean then when the Holy Ghost begins to baptize the people brother color gives an all I ain't got no time for you I try to give you two over 80 years though all is the work and you refuse the Word of God but nevertheless whosoever will you come on to what I don't know where you're going but I know if you're thirsty hallelujah you shall be filled [Applause] [Music] Amen so the seventh undersea has been sold and in that seed is a promise if you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man you shall receive a righteous man's reward but if you sit in that church and curse that pastor and get mad when he click when when he won't go under your thumb don't you ever put your thumb upon me get your thumbs off of me he better not say is here yes I will say it the very thing that you don't want me to say I'm going to shout it from the rooftop [Applause] the very thing that you think that I should not say and I'm gonna say it as hard as I can to shake your carnal spirit [Music] trying to figure out the because the mechanics you don't have to know the mechanics you gotta know the thing that pulsates it the thing that makes it shove it down the road that's what you've got to know he's got a man so they are friends the hour has come for a separation between a spiritual man and a carnal man a man Romans 8:1 now therefore there's no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now thus who is a spiritual man the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die because in his soul there's a compartment science found out in Chicago 1955 in the soul of a man's a little compartment some have a compartment there with nothing in it but the pride of Jesus Christ has like a pot we put a word seed and that word seed is a spiritual man and you can never tell how can you tell how can you sin if the seed of crud is in you how can you sin how can you come against a pastor the teak is anybody can know seated but let me tell you all the thing the seed of God the eel it does not persecute elect the ELA loose one another believe for one another prays alone another a man there's a word see let there be light that's a squared C and the Holy Ghost is brooding over you if the Holy Ghost is brooding over you in New York the whole world is talking about it how can you sit here dead the Hanukkah Saint Eddie's brooding

battleground for demons to rage but down in here he sits there hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus in here but here well here peace would call that path is understanding Satan you can help my mind

phone call from my sister she told me that a cloud had begun to take place had begun to take shape in the sky I walked toward the window to look at it and I saw when the cloud was shaping up and it was like the the one that appeared in the days of the Prophet suddenly I found myself in a wooden house out in the country somewhere I came out to the front entrance and they are knelt down to pray and to cry for joy thanking God for the sign of the end time there were also several persons around me kneeling crying and repenting while others pass through unconcerned after this experience I stood up and saw several airplanes which approached the cloud and poured a white smoke over it seemingly to cover it and make it appear as if it were formed out of the smoke from the planes but their attempt was unsuccessful and the original cloud withstood furthermore I saw women in the planes that's who I've been fighting fought one this morning so women in the planes with spray cans also pouring smoke out of the cans a little while after the smoke vanish you can put this clown out don't you ever try a sister to put this clown out yes sir mister the crowd has been turned I sister

while after the smoke vanish in the original crowd was clear as ever then at the evening when the Sun was setting I saw white dove flying with a branch in her beak and she landed in the cloud position herself in the lower half of the cloud facing us the same as the cloud the seven rainbow colors was behind the Dove shining bright as fire and on the right side of the dog there were small numbers of letters that I couldn't make out after this found myself again inside of the house together with my sister and my brother-in-law I had Mohnish them to repent while there was still time to do it at this point they got up to go my sister left with her head bowed and my brother-in-law said quote I'll do it when the time comes then we left as soon as we walked out the house it was dark and the cloud began to fade can only be seen from the center of a man another sister had a dream I won't give her name five and six after I walked out I went to South Africa she had a dream December 21st there was fire up in the ceiling of the church towards the bank just before the balcony it looked like when a fire place is burning brother Cowan was preaching and as soon as he spoke there was the manifestation it look like judgment the Spirit would take brother Coleman right to the face of the ones called out and judgment would strike amen that's what I've been doing they going right to their faces and I didn't even know what hit was the dream I wasn't even here but God said look in their faces he said no matter how hard their faces he told me in Saint Thomas he ZQ he says set your face to
