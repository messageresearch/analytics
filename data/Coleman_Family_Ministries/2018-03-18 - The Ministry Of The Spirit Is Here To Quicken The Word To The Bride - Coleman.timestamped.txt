[0:17] [Music]
[0:19] thank you lord
[0:25] blessed be the name of the Lord I want
[0:30] to invite your attention to Zechariah
[0:33] for Saint John 15 x1
[1:06] reads on this wise and the angel that
[1:10] talked with me came again and waked me
[1:14] as a man that is awakened out of his
[1:16] sleep and said unto me what see is thou
[1:21] and I said I have looked and behold a
[1:24] candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[1:28] the top of it and his seven lamps
[1:31] they're wrong and seven pipes to the
[1:34] seven lamps which are upon the top
[1:36] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[1:40] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[1:42] other upon the left side they are aside
[1:44] they're out so I answered and spake to
[1:48] this angel that talked with me saying
[1:50] what are these my lord the angel that
[1:55] talked with me answered said unto me
[1:58] knowest thou not what these be and I
[2:02] said no my lord
[2:03] then he answered and spake unto me
[2:06] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[2:09] the rule
[2:10] saying not by might nor by power but by
[2:13] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who
[2:17] art Thou O great mountain before
[2:20] zerubabbel thou shalt become a plain and
[2:24] he shall bring forth the headstone
[2:26] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[2:30] grace unto it and st. John 15:7 if he
[2:41] abide in me and my words abide in you he
[2:45] shall ask what's your will and it shall
[2:48] be done unto you and acts 1:8
[3:01] excellent eat but ye shall receive power
[3:06] the question is when alpha that the Holy
[3:11] Ghost is come upon you and you shall be
[3:15] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[3:18] all Judea and Samaria and unto the
[3:23] uttermost part of the earth you notice
[3:25] that the power doesn't come till after
[3:27] the Holy Ghost comes upon you I'm now
[3:30] speaking about a birth now I'm talking
[3:32] about the Holy Ghost the intelligence
[3:34] the voice of the Archangel then you
[3:37] shall receive power amen amen
[3:44] they got it a blessing to the reading of
[3:47] his word amen
[3:51] just a word of prayer father in heaven
[3:53] we read their word and now Lord our
[3:57] people have coming here prepared and
[3:59] anointed and a minister cannot bring the
[4:03] revival we've been taught that the
[4:06] people themselves have the seeds in them
[4:09] and anointing is here to revive the
[4:12] seeds in them in the homes on the jobs
[4:16] and the fellowships and just individuals
[4:20] so bless the people in may a mighty
[4:24] outpouring of the Holy Spirit break out
[4:26] here today Lord God Almighty may many be
[4:29] seal and heal Lord God Almighty and now
[4:33] strengthen me Lord just in the pack and
[4:36] my blood pressure little higher Lord I'm
[4:39] in your hands
[4:40] amen so may your knowing come upon me
[4:43] now to preach this message amen
[4:48] bless the reading on the word hearing
[4:50] over to the hearts and we'll be careful
[4:53] to give you all the praise on and glory
[4:55] for we ask it in Jesus name and his sake
[4:57] amen
[4:58] and
[4:59] you may be seated will praise the Lord
[5:03] well friends good morning to you I don't
[5:08] think I've taken a text in here in a
[5:10] long time
[5:11] amen but I've been here just getting
[5:14] things in order through July and August
[5:16] kind of slipping in amen you know it's
[5:20] not a group it's individuals and and the
[5:23] presence of Jesus Christ unrecognized
[5:26] just slipping it in and then trying to
[5:28] kind of warn you so something wouldn't
[5:31] come upon you
[5:32] a man so you've been warned so when it
[5:35] comes a men are not responsible a man
[5:43] well praise alone
[5:45] [Music]
[5:45] [Applause]
[5:59] well finally got started huh
[6:01] okay Church first time Anthea's 2 4 & 5
[6:05] the Apostle Paul said his speech and
[6:09] preaching was in the demonstration in
[6:11] the past and the Spirit of the Spirit in
[6:14] the power and of power and that your
[6:17] face should staying in the power of God
[6:19] amen now you all know the story the
[6:23] foundation November 10th 1964 the Holy
[6:27] Spirit spoke to me I was wondering in my
[6:29] Pentecost away at my aunt she Jacob
[6:32] Grace Joseph perfection that was in 64
[6:35] while the Prophet was still preaching
[6:36] okay now and then then I've been echoing
[6:42] back the shout message since December 26
[6:45] 1965 which is about 33 years and 10
[6:49] months up to date October a man echoing
[6:53] back the shout keeping it alive a man
[6:59] and so why was it so hard brother
[7:03] Coleman because of three because there's
[7:06] three reasons why and here's what it is
[7:08] see down there's three elements you have
[7:11] to deal with the the humanistic realm
[7:14] and in there people were saved and you
[7:17] know without the Holy Ghost and
[7:18] sanctified well suddenly just can't get
[7:21] that revelation amen
[7:23] and then divine revelation and then
[7:26] vision thus saith the Lord
[7:29] so those are three elements and brother
[7:33] Bram said Melchizedek the Great Prince
[7:37] he's he said he said there's three
[7:43] elements and a man follows first as
[7:45] humanistic second is divine revelation
[7:47] third is the vision
[7:48] that's thus saith the Lord and then
[7:53] Jesus Christ the same Chicago 1955 as I
[7:59] have said there's three elements that
[8:00] people dwell in this
[8:02] the first one is humanistic we say down
[8:05] we are we we down here we say well I'll
[8:10] pray for that person I'm hoping that now
[8:13] they'll get well now next is divine
[8:17] revelation here's what I want to strike
[8:18] so you know what I've been doing all
[8:21] these years that's when something
[8:23] darling your heart anchors it and says
[8:27] it's going to happen then something is
[8:30] going to happen that's divine revelation
[8:35] nothing can move it can't ball it out
[8:38] can't run it out can't curse it out
[8:41] can't revile it out hold church walk
[8:44] away still they are praise God well now
[8:49] you understand what I've been doing up
[8:51] here for all these years you can't stop
[8:53] it they can't stop it you can't run it
[8:56] out you can't curse it out there's
[8:58] nothing that you can do about it either
[9:00] accept it or walk out be on your way
[9:03] because I'll be standing here by the
[9:05] grace of God in and out day in and day
[9:09] out Sunday Wednesday I'll be here I'll
[9:12] be on my posts hallelujah defying the
[9:16] revelation a man may be seated
[9:20] that's when something telling your heart
[9:22] anchors it anchored shows the perfection
[9:25] acre wasn't nothing gonna change that
[9:28] praise God
[9:29] nobody when the Holy Spirit told me
[9:32] December 26 5 8 in the morning everybody

[9:40] gonna stop that stand up the shot of the
[9:44] King doesn't account nobody can stop it
[9:47] please God
[9:50] a man may be seated in the third element
[9:53] is vision oh now watch catch this the
[9:57] third element is vision are the word of
[10:01] the Lord mate manifests or you got that
[10:05] huh when you see that see what vision or
[10:11] the word of the Lord end of the world

[10:46] one over there well this was revealed to
[10:48] me that's my divine revelation well

[10:54] if all the ministers don't have it cuz
[10:57] that my fault
[10:58] but I'm gaining the preacher and nothing
[11:02] is going to stop me from preaching it
[11:07] so now you you understand now what I've
[11:10] been up against God to give you a divine
[11:13] revelation look look or Noah I thank God

[12:46] then they go on say well I don't know
[12:48] what he's talking about what it wasn't
[12:49] revealed to you it's not the same in New
[12:53] York is different here of course because
[12:55] there's a divine revelation here I don't
[12:59] care where you come from it's not in
[13:00] your country it cannot be the same
[13:05] there's something about New York City a
[13:08] man said here hallelujah

[13:59] yourself sanctified amen
[14:02] maybe see the second is divine
[14:04] revelation we some revealed to you and
[14:08] you know you just know in your heart is
[14:12] going to happen
[14:13] why because I'm quoting back from the
[14:16] Prophet and then do you understand why I
[14:31] was so positive because I was have a
[14:34] revelation of brother ransom message and
[14:36] that wasn't brother Brown that was the
[14:38] son of man in brother Brown speaking the
[14:40] word so I've got to give me a revelation
[14:43] or what are you saying I mean I may not
[14:45] be a fool not to be positive that's what
[14:48] he's saying
[14:49] I don't care where the way you come from
[14:54] I don't care what you don't understand
[14:56] but this is what I understand this is
[14:59] what would reveal to me and it's got to
[15:03] come to pass and even told you second
[15:07] phase prophesy and prophesy and what the
[15:10] testimony of Jesus spirit of prophecy
[15:12] the hardest thing was maybe see them I
[15:18] mean maybe see the moment the hardest
[15:20] thing for 33 years was what dealing with
[15:24] people in a humanistic around without a
[15:28] revelation that was the hardest part
[15:34] that's where the love for their souls
[15:36] come in or you walk out of here that's
[15:40] right to look at these people faces no
[15:42] praise no nothing don't only note even
[15:44] talking about humanistic and you up here
[15:48] in divine revelation glory to God
[15:53] and you got a hold on hold on hold on
[15:56] anyway
[15:56] sick weary tired time on our tents you
[16:04] maybe seen it what tests you've been
[16:05] through maybe seated
[16:08] oh you just know in your heart here not
[16:14] appear is going to happen because the
[16:17] prophet said so yet there isn't just yet
[16:22] there's nothing but just the revelation
[16:27] you finally understand now only the
[16:30] revelation I had everything else you had
[16:38] the same books and tapes they're correct
[16:44] ok Church well what have I been doing
[16:48] since December 26 1965 why are we a
[16:52] denomination Oh Jeff Saville 1958 page
[16:59] 33 paragraph 160 now the Bible did say
[17:03] your sons and your daughters shall
[17:05] prophesy now what does the word prophecy
[17:08] mean look it up
[17:10] now listen is to tell something under
[17:15] inspiration
[17:19] tell what - what the Prophet saying is
[17:24] that what you've been doing brother
[17:26] Coleman yes tell something on the
[17:29] inspiration under revelation not
[17:32] humanistic realm humanistic is although
[17:36] we were were were word father said
[17:39] that's humanistic but you have a divine
[17:41] revelation that seven thunders are the
[17:44] seven voices of the seven churches
[17:47] Jacob greats chose the perfection to
[17:50] shout at a king and of some have
[17:52] compassion that severe in Revelation
[17:55] tell it speak it
[18:02] and may be seated
[18:06] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[18:09] now what does the word prophecy mean
[18:10] look it up it is to tell something under
[18:14] inspiration or foretell something for
[18:19] tell what for tell everything that the
[18:21] Prophet said we prophesied bang amen
[18:25] then they think your prophet well we'll
[18:27] get to that
[18:28] amen it's a compound word pays 34
[18:31] Paragon 170 now but then the
[18:35] circumcision of the Old Testament was in
[18:37] the flesh but in this New Testament
[18:39] Joelle said I pour out my spirit upon
[18:41] all flesh and your sons your daughters
[18:42] shall prophesy now the word prophecy
[18:45] does not mean to teach they get rid of
[18:52] all teachers brother cloud any man I
[18:53] don't mean to teach the prophecy means
[18:56] to either tell and experience on the
[19:01] inspiration while I told my experience
[19:03] on the inspiration jacob grace tells of
[19:07] perfection the shot of the king to seven
[19:09] thunders seven voice of seven church
[19:11] ages that was my inspiration that was my
[19:15] experience is it opening up to you now

[19:49] Laura if God demands it amen
[19:52] okay may be seated
[19:55] now the word prophet does not mean to
[19:57] teach them the prophecy means to either
[19:59] tell an experience on the inspiration of
[20:04] foretell something that's fixing to take
[20:07] place and this whole message was the
[20:10] testimony of Jesus which is the spirit
[20:12] of prophecy and everybody wasn't called
[20:15] but they don't think they call it's only
[20:19] a few that's called that's your problem
[20:23] every man think he's a pants or someone

[1:17:32] against Joseph perfection because Joseph
[1:17:36] perfection is finally the fourth line in

[1:17:42] gonna work his his way out by giving
[1:17:44] faith through seven thunders then when

[1:20:01] is like what it looks like he wasn't
[1:20:03] here when Jesus was but Jesus came back
[1:20:05] in the Prophet with the Ministry of the
[1:20:07] Spirit and we know what it is
