the dynamics and the mechanics are together for the bride's day I got three questions to ask amen what is the perfection of the son of man number two how do we get this perfection and number three is it that it's a time of life for the token though the three noble questions and only the scriptures and a revealed word for this day can answer this here now praise God amen now I know no man after the flesh seated now the bride must recognize her position in the word for this Dame and get in step with her message and her season you know what is the vision for this day recognizing your danis of message on page now I'm just paraphrase did you know what it is just bringing it back for this of climax the 11th hour workers they were supposed to receive the same penny as they receive on the day of Pentecost and a penny that they receive then what did they have on the day of Pentecost listen they had a manifestation of the perfection of the Son of Man the son of man Jesus Christ had revealed himself in prophecy and spoke seed promises into to his disciples but on the day of Pentecost they had to take note that they had been with Jesus I want to ask you a question why because a perfection of the Son of Man was in them the same length the same signs the same wonders the perfection of the Son of Man hallelujah Laurie the only difference was a son of man himself did the sign of this treatment but other than that they had their portion of the pillow fire failed and Peter unveiled a mighty God page 41 the pillar of fire was failing Peter like in Moses it was a word for their pain the pillow fire was in God's flesh for that day the church and that day has returned packed in the last days the Son of man has revealed himself again in Malachi 4 all praise God any promise to return back Sarah come on Sarah don't you laugh in a tent I will return unto thee according to the time of life I will be veiled in your flesh like I was on the day of Pentecost you'll get no more sign in the message now I care for reveal the sign of the ascertainment the only sign you'll get you'll see a prayer with the same life same time same oneness God in flesh various car hey you may be seated do

picnic you're going to a war hey Dan you may be seated a second seed pride comes into preview again in evening time and the message was just keep her in step until she's right until she's mature and then she can find her position then when the shocks pull back she'll see where she's happy she to me the perfection of the Son of Man and me that's your position hello brother Rams head on page 38 national power will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put the people in the brain the Spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and length we'll put the people in her place why because she will recognize her position position where in the word you are not the blade the stalk that was Luther that was Hagar Lori you're not the tassel that was Wesley and Sarah the stock does not look like a cream the tassel does not look like a dream and you're not the shocked Mary it does not look like a green but the shut looks almost like it it looks so much like the green until the Catholic Church received it as the green glory but you shall receive the grain [Applause] oh man you're not a blade you're not a tassel you're not a shock you are the

perfectly in harmony Lord where the relations perfectly harmony in God expresses through his word by the same action the same things that he did making his word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when when it knows what it is when it knows that it is that it will do the it will be the perfection of son of man again it'll be a ministry that will catch that headstone gloria and then ministry it must come out of layout of sia and come up right up in the top the neck part that joins to head to the panty the neck part is the seven thunders the holy spirit that's upon you the head will settle down on your neck that's why the Holy Spirit brought you the Holy Spirit not gonna be satisfied with without what I feel here this morning that does tell us fine and it still hasn't broken yet Laurie about keep preaching is going to break hello yeah whoa well come on friends it's the King's message let's recognize it friend you may be seated for we call together together for the sounding of the trumpet we have called to the resurrection God promised praise God he would come down as the voice of the Archangel and put you on the third speed and call you to the resurrection after Holy Ghost baptism will come fire baptism to come right down and claim your mechanics the fire baptism is here charity to claim your mechanics not to claim your bleed not to claim your tassel not to claim your shock your mechanic your crane word see your very party you are his eyes you are his lips his feet his nose you are his 16 elements ela ela ela ela him wants the 12 in his flesh again Lorie hallelujah recognize your message come on Laura charity must come back on the 3rd phase to vindicate the first phase of brotherly kindness you may be seated sym masterpiece praise God page 28 the baptism the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in what perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself when perfection comes in not just the birth when the birth coming it was gifts but when perfection drops in there comes the word then it's word in spirit and then spiritus charity to water seven thunders seed where that's the secret the word is in the prime with the mind of Christ of spirit to know what to do with the word Amen I do nothing except my father show me st. John 5:19 hallelujah whatever he shows me what he does and I do the same thing if he shows me a he walk he chops down the heels brother dinners then I did not say the same thing if he says thus saith the Lord my wife blaring air I shall open then I speak it back Laurie now perfection is here back to the word maybe seated to manifest itself see friends is not to shock that was Hagar I mean I was just the Blee was Hagar and Sarah was a tassel and Mary wasn't shocked and Mary produced the true spiritual seed the Word made flesh now when the word is made fresh again didn't see time do you understand the sign on Halloween when all those spirits was loosed on Halloween on all demon night praise God they were loosed when that happened that was a sign is see turn again back to the see the cedars are green the greens of mechanics Oh hallelujah praise glory to God yes sir you mean is actually see time just the word in the spirit really to 22:17 the spirit on the word the brown dust sayeth the Lord thus saith the Lord then ours here now well I don't feel ok what you don't feel is here now [Applause] I'm waiting to see it Prescott now Pentecost maybe see the represented Mary the last stage of the plant and now she was not the seed now I notice yet the life where the seed was in her just seen her not mature yet so therefore the shock had to hold it glory and the in turn the entire seed had not come forth yet and all of the life from the shuck forms in the seed word again so therefore before the dynamics could strike the mechanics all of the life that was in this shock had to come out in form into the seven thunders seed wearing and then the others that will come bless Laura is blessed all those who are not here these last ten years and they will believe without seeing EEMA they'll be blessed and God sent somebody with this God sent somebody down to Tulsa amen as a representative of those who will come amen and they already are first base Emma we touch bases pin has be second base Easter third piece tell us a home Laurie now praise God now she was not to see and the life of the sea was in her and all of the life from the shuk forms in the seat again the life of the seat passes through the plant in three stages so therefore those three stages only had the life passing through their bodies was not actually the green but in this day your bodies your mechanics is actually the green how do you know that and so much that your green seed word will be changed because the stalker not being a resurrection to be changed neither could a tassel neither could have shot can you imagine God giving us chuckle glorified party cannot if they was in the shock age with the Holy Ghost they went to heaven but this day they'll walk on the earth to know that we ourselves are the green the the seed word itself what a revelation oh my wonderful the fourth stage may be seated is the seed word itself the mechanics of the word again like the first seed Church and when you begin to claim your promises of the seed word in say I am a father one and preached all these seven thunders and promises and Joseph perfection and adoption then that shot goes away you know why because the ship knows it is not to seed green body [Applause] but you know you are [Applause] predestinated caught predestiny you for this age to believe these impossible promises impossible impossible no with God nothing shall be impossible is anything too hard for the Lord cheer up stop laughing in the tent the peril of God shall come upon your body and change you a power of God gave Sara body to receive Isaac Delp Alki will give you a body to receive Isaac Gloria hey man so when you be gold when you begin to preach I am a father one these shucks Devils coming against you because they know inside of them as nothing there's no witness in them that they are anything so when you preach seven thunders of perfection did they have no revelation of perfection they afraid so therefore they just like just leave it alone don't appreciate sunders in Joseph's perfection in adoption and then they pull away from it amen and brother Browns he'll try and do God's everything against his will in Shreveport he said first they will receive Elijah he said Elijah Elijah didn't come until after 63 and wasn't hard about here in 63 4 and 5 but with a small remnant praise God hey man so therefore who will receive Elijah first after the large is gone who will support it and put it into foreign languages and sending around the world who the shock will in the message and then it'll come when that seed pick up that promise on page three or four for sealed amen wait time element and foul to put a seed wait until the seven thunders uttered his voices to that group that can hand the words here it'll slice and cut and shut the heavens and everything else so when a Tyrell they should begin to chop down praise guidance in early 70's the shuck they're gonna pull away God actually puts shuck ministries and all around the seed that it might be manifest and pull away the action is going on where the thunders are there you see all kind of action all kind of demons all kind of everything going on around the thunders Laura nah Amen or you begin to claim your promise but the real genuine privacy Church will find her position and bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness the shuck has served its purpose it is see time again see time is here word time bread time Laura the seed cannot get ripe until the stalk Jocelyn shucks all try they've got to be completely tried as long as any life is in the shop is still green when the last bit of life comes out of the shop and he shuts to tour and then green seed becomes golden brown when the life leaves the shop and the shop goes from green to yellow straw and the seed goes from gold from agreeing to golden brown and about that time wheelchair than Tulsa glory praise God and all this kind of preaching here could not come until October 31st in this area hallelujah glory it's C time the shucks a dead priest God our spirit has come upon the prime to do his works what is it it's the reproducing thinking of the green thou has come for the second seat church to manifest itself again the life has come through the shocking is now formed in the green itself the life will form in you what's the life faith virtue knowledge temperance patience college public I will form in you you'll be reg nated and charity will take that seventh on the baby Oh hallelujah praise God amen your party is not no more stock counselors shucks but your bodies are actually a green seed body because only the green seat bita can receive the seed word the shuck cannot receive it they don't know what it is it's not for them oh

rejoice over the Prophet himself rejoiced he said notice here the light that was in this talk town slow all now ends up in the seed the light that come out of the original seed come up through different processes three different processes and then it turns back till his original condition hallelujah oh my this is the Prophet I'm the happiest person in the world that God would let me see this the Prophet himself thanking God for this revelation and the people come against it they don't even want it that's why I praise do you understand why I'm so happy that God will let me see that in my bathtub that's why I'm happy that's why I sing that's why praise cut that's why I don't care if you never praise God because God never let you see that you are the green but if you ever see a revelation and you are the green where was dowing those sons of God shouted for joy and the morning's time sang together praise God all the seed where he was there rejoicing singing his Shelton

first seat church first ministry but then an emphasis began to fall away pull away and that beetle come in and ate their fruit off of that tree in Ephesus then come the leaves that lease was eaten off in Iranians time praise God and then down into Martin priests got the bark come off then down into Columbo off then it went down and then sucked the life out those four Beatles the Palmer worm the locust that can't get where him in the caterpillar but I will restore sayeth the Lord all right then that seed pull away pull away pull away pull away Paul's they come back to your first love like it was on the day of Pentecost when the church was on fire when they were beaten they sang and praise God when they were thrown in jail they praise the Lord they sang until the earthquake shook the tale one little thing happened today you can't even praise the Lord Lord wills that seed Brennan I don't get this - in here I'm gonna preach to you hey go Laura then they denominated lose her the Nama lady West has had filthy Church a man to nominate a Pentecost but here come Elijah I will restore stamp the Lord then the vision broke in then come the vision and God made brother Branham preach in the pulpit before he gave him the interpretation that message he had to preach himself without the interpretation of the vision and while he was preaching the revelation come [Applause] it's right now you

I'll put that up there by faith I don't care if nobody else got ll care God told me to put it up there and put him here he's here I declare unto you today he is here glory works his faith Express page 37a man he said he's weaved in the book that you turn the picture sideways like a magazine half a head of Christ I'll skip along here why we'd why the old English judges the Jewish judges used to wear wigs they do it yet in England that that's supreme authority he wears a wig and that showed him standing in wig by angel swings and we was week by the seventh under angel's wings and they didn't know it but then he turned now they will know it this was a chance while he was laying sideways it was a chance to come in but when it turns this way don't you come against that Laura he's the Alpha an Amiga he's supreme church and none other but in him he has a look upon his alpha an Amiga and there he was a young man no more 30 years old wearing a wig of white showing he was supreme god the father's committed all judgment into the hands of the son hallelujah here it is the revelation is never wrong speak it anyhow no matter what it sounds like it goes right with the word and that's why I speak these things it's always right I don't care what the whole church well the Ministerial Association I don't care speak it anyway all the bull heads walk out so long Hey yup glory mine they sturdy eight masterpiece now here is the interpretation arrow the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes here but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church when he came in view while he's speaking it the Lord revealed it to him my now that's the true friends the Heavenly Father who writes the word knows I tell the truth I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago it looked like or just recently did you notice the bride came in a few twice the first seed and the second seed both of them exactly the same one you know what I'm saying I told my the Apostolic Church was a perfection of the Son of Man then in the seven churches just a supernatural spirit son the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the spirit son that went through the church ages but in last days according the sweet Luke 17 the Son of Man will be reveal again God Elohim in skin Wow the first seed and the second seed both exactly the same and the reason they were dressed in different parts you come in all nations and make up the Bryant each one had long hair no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represent the Brad come out of all nations see each one representing the nation oh my the seed fell in the ground and I see that was original seed and she come up through the process of these denominations which only come in existence once but the bride returns back in the last days I would restore see the masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in view the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time she was the first time Oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick he told the life to get out of the stocks denominations get out of the tonsils sanctified groups and get out of the shop Pentecostal group get out hurry hurry hurry hurry get out of there and coming to the green and when you begin to come out somebody will come to the platform and preach the green so you have a place of gold you will have to stay in no Church you don't have to stay there your body is being preached because your theophany is calling for it and if god gotta bring a baboon in here to preach it he'll do it if God can make a donkey speak Laurey he'll get somebody not a woman preacher Amen hallelujah well praise God say Amen somebody Laurie amen Oh hallelujah there we are church amen maybe see the first see Oh hallelujah the health of the first the second seed on meager the lands something happened they tipped our other pulpit it had Alfred amigo and put the joy told me the other day the Alpha Omega broke and we have to take it to pin Harris you say with the RA if we put a Hoffman head looking to the right for the Alpha Omega is Christ hey man so therefore for years it was a letters but now you can see the face it was a letter but now is the face face the face hallelujah and you change even as by the Spirit of the Lord from from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory hallelujah may be seated the first seat second seat I will restore my Amen my a man now what are you trying to say brother Cole I'm saying this like when the day of Pentecost amen that church stared the see the Son of Man reveal himself and gave promises to them amen then that meant that the promise was there then therefore because they was the grains the word seeds without before it became a real seed but those words cease receive the words of the son of man so when the Holy Spirit felt they had the fullness of the word and a word message and word teachings from son of man and he came in prophetically and prophesied in st. John all through their glory and they receive a prophetic message but not only does he come in with the learning of himself he also manifests that so on the day of Pentecost there they were trash I worried seeds sanctifying the whole himself up the steps into the upper room because they had a promise they were praising God and bless His name continually without the Holy Ghost the devil could not tell them that they was not the seed of God oh praise God hallelujah and and Peter would have felt terrible like he was Judas but the Lord returned back to Peter and he came to Thomas Thomas said my lord oh my god now go on up there praise God for the Holy Ghost you didn't make no mistakes you didn't commit the unpardonable sin you are my seeds glory to God amen brother Tommy you're free shot

Laurie my breathe God my brother's is rejoicing oh [Music] thank you long go [Music] the mechanics in the dynamic saw together for the bride's team what for for the perfection of the son of man again

set you free God sitting on the fire lord fall upon Mary hallelujah hallelujah praise God my mind what a dane my my God sent his servant free my god my as my father sent me even so send I you you may be seated now let's answer these three questions and finish you want to answer the three questions go ahead what is the perfection of the Sun I mean anyway the answer the 7 spirits of God the seven rainbow colors that's the perfection of the Son of Man amen okay Hebrews chapter 7 page I'll give you a chance to coast a little bit amen you're coasting but what about me breeze scar now let's talk about Ella ham a little bit and we close out amen he had seven varieties of spirit is that right the Bible said in Revelation the seven spirits before the throne of God that right seven seven manifold seven spirit we found this seven colors seven church ages seven is complete in God it's complete in seven spirits those spirits was perfect the first was a color of red and love Redemption how we had time to give those colors each one of those colors represent God's purity those colors there's seven natural colors those colors represent the purity of God those colors represent the motives of God the attitude of God those seven Kazi represented seven church ages seven stars seven angels all through the scripture seven ministers seven messengers seven messages all in the seven seven days and six day in the seventh day the Sabbath perfect complete always beautiful if we just have the time to dig into it and bring it out those colors amen oh praise God so now that great fountain of love the great diamond of God he come from spirit the great fountain of the rainbow this eternal life had no beginning and has no end they could never die because it was never born yes sir it had no beginning of days it had no ending of time it always was and you always was you only recognize it now who you are and to think that God would save you for this day to be hid the grain of his body and that can't get no praise Laurie my Shah or a RI and in page 432 and for 33 and God was this great spirit Amy and could we pictured him like the seven colours of rainbow that covers the bowl would actually covered everything it didn't strike the earth his Jessa water in a circle of the curvature of the earth or what makes it but now as God is eternal and he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in a revelation amen so praise God I yeah Emma they come out they was made of God was perfection and everything else outside out has been something that has been perverted from them now how do we become perfect of the perfection of the Son of Man Laurie here's how and the only way that we can come back to perfection is to come back with that perfection which is God ja then we come to perfection then we have eternal life without n without anything it's just forever eternal life oh my the only way to have the perfection of the Son of Man is a compact with that perfection which is God and God is Elohim and when L ahem drops down in perfection with seven spirits then we come back to perfection seven spirits coming down from God to you would have seat on the air and seven spirits going back to God back to where you come from then we have eternal life without end without anything it's just forever eternal life sevens test from God Elohim and Malachi fours message restores it back the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself Ella him to come right down in perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself which is seven living spices seven living spirits seven rain poles seven thunders living jumping moving door a bride shall march again Laura don't you worry about the baptismal Holy Ghost get this message out and watch your pour out watch them cease be baptized and there be saw such an unknown and they'll speaking other languages they'll lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover they'll cast out Devils they'll raise at if they'll be for the quickening power you're quitting power glory come right back down may be seated to manifest itself how's it manifest itself seven steps back to car question number two oh man so that how do we get this perfection by the word message of Malachi for glory his word message was Luther Wesley Pentecostals in a worried pride faith love grace perfection so you can only get it by his message no other message can you get perfection by he is the one that brought forth Joseph's perfection it lies in here and we preach this Laurie shocked Oh hallelujah Lord then chose the perfection the seven spirits of Elohim represented by the seven rainbow coat upon Joseph the bride type and a pill of fire will be failed again in her skin like Christ was failed in Peter in the early prime MA so a three phase message produces perfection let's prove that Hebrews page 347 ami paragraph 340 I don't want to tell you another thing did

crazy he's gonna have the perfection of the Son of Man again imma prove it to you anyway glory which is the mechanics and dynamics together for the branch day there this is a promise of God from Malachi 4 ok let's begin to prove it out now God always proves his word well he don't use make believers he don't use complainers he don't use with those what I don't know I don't feel good this morning he don't use you to prove nothing the devil uses you Loreena God a man sure oh man that's a button float here for about ten minutes a man flew along some quotes to nail down Nayla town proving this word of I am a teen number three page one the Word of God he's the quickening pal he's the Holy Spirit the dynamic that comes into the mechanics the words that make it live you are his words you are his mechanics he is a dynamic succumbing to his words why because you believe all of his words through the through the Prophet it was him that spoke through the prophets mouth and you received his words and you come out of shock and you become his words his mechanics and now he's the dynamics that wants to get into your mechanics and then make it live and it all has to work together just won't work it's got to take the whole Bible the whole Christ the full gospel and just so we know what we're talking about the manifestation again on page four we should realize that in us has been given we who believe Jesus Christ been born of the spirit filled with that quickening power that power that's in you by laying on the hands or on the others like the disciples did down through the age it absolutely heal the sick raise the dead it showed visions prophecies and a very same spirit catch it the very same spirit that lived amongst the early apostles talk about now the first C church amen Laurie is living in the church today working the very same things and as quick as we can recognize that see no matter how much it's the working you got to recognize that and believe that it won't do one bit of good until you believe it and the moment you believe it your troubles are ended the very same spirit that worked in Peter come back and work again through Malachi for that's my promise that's your promise if you wanted that's the second seed church the only thing won't had that sign was done Malachi for did that sign and he had all of the Son of Man in him and we will have our measure but it'll be the measure that was in the early bride which was the same they did the same signs they take it took note that they had been with Jesus cuz they was manifesting his perfection so my thought is the perfection of the son of man again again like it was on the first see Church is here again oh oh you got it grace okay you got it now on page 6 paragraph 30 it's your approach the attitude it's what it takes and that's what it is tonight their friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but as your attitude it brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you could just get started God will do the rest there we are Oh mind speaking about Sarah he said on page 25 talking about son of man and Ella him he said she's in a tent behind you he's 25 listen what he said he said I'm going to visit you see according to my promise that I made you in other words the time of life Sarah will start her ordinary
