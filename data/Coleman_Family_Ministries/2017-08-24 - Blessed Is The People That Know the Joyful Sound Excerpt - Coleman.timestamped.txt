[4:02] condition so God in His grace August 7th
[4:08] told me to play back where was dojo and
[4:11] then he opened your understanding up
[4:15] with a revelation of worship so now
[4:19] comes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[4:21] [Applause]
[4:23] which we could not have because the
[4:26] people had no revelation of worship
[4:32] [Applause]
[4:34] I tried all I could but it took God to
[4:38] do it himself
[4:39] amen so now revelation five day through
[4:43] 14 watch now what what's going on here
[4:46] now Berlocq Holman the silence that was
[4:50] put over revelation that I mean put over

[6:07] number two the elders worship Him number
[6:10] three living creatures worship Him and
[6:13] John representing a bride worshiped him
[6:16] now is the manifestation of the jubilee
[6:21] worship to King Lamb the Jubilee is on
[6:27] there be another day of Jubilee now
[6:32] notice Ole Miss said revelation 5 1814 a
[6:36] manifestation worship precedes the
[6:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:44] no worship no holy ghost
[6:47] [Applause]
[6:49] they are
[6:52] okay in the manifestation of revelation
[6:56] 5 religion 5 1 through 7 is mechanics in
[7:00] revelation relation 5 1814 manifestation
[7:04] now
[7:05] you worship because of the Elohim
[7:09] inspiration allows you because of the of
[7:13] the revelation of being attributed
[7:15] allows you to be reborn
[7:17] so you worship because God is your God
[7:20] and you know who you are and therefore
[7:23] you enter into the manifestation of
[7:26] revelation 5 8 through 14 and it took
[7:33] God to do it he did it August 7 and he
[7:37] did it back there in Saint Luke 24 45:49
[7:41] he had to open up their understanding he
[7:44] had to open up your understanding August
[7:46] the 7th so if you're worshiping then you
[7:51] are ready for the dynamics of revelation
[7:53] 5 8 through 14 now catch me in here now
[7:56] catch me and the middle part of the
[8:01] seventh seal
[8:05] [Applause]
[8:10] okay I believe all you know that the
[8:15] Seventh Seal is a three-fold mystery and
[8:18] he looked under the 7c when it opened he
[8:21] saw he heard rather a banging seven
[8:24] times seven thunders he looked to see a
[8:26] way to win and went into unknown tones
[8:31] so I asked you a question
[8:33] could these three full seventh seal
[8:39] could that tie in to one two three four
[8:43] sixteen
[8:46] [Applause]
[8:48] shall force Trump
[8:53] Jesus does all three
[8:58] justice blowing here now are we
[9:01] connecting now in the middle part
[9:05] okay here we go number one shout seven
[9:13] seals seven thunders what is that that
[9:16] represents your soul but there's a seed
[9:19] in the soul my my number two
[9:29] voice of the Archangel this represents
[9:32] your spirit
[9:34] [Applause]
[9:35] I should put it this way the Seventh
[9:39] Seal maybe understand this way is the
[9:41] claiming seal
[9:48] say they got it done
[9:50] it claims you
[9:53] it claims your soul they might claim
[9:57] your spirit I'm going to claim your body
[10:01] [Applause]
[10:05] okay Brian
[10:09] amen say you got it now shout seven
[10:16] seven thunders the word seed in your
[10:18] soul and it claims that attribute in
[10:22] there it calls you calls you out a
[10:28] layout of Cielo call you out everywhere
[10:33] now we entered into part two voice of
[10:37] the Archangel and now we have our
[10:39] spirits imagination and memory affection
[10:41] conscience of reasoning so what happens
[10:43] now
[10:44] Ellingham comes back down to horizontal
[10:46] rainbow and the set LEM has said made up
[10:49] of seven spirits seven spirits coming
[10:52] from your theophany this law seven
[10:55] spirits coming from your theophany
[10:58] because your theophany is sending
[11:00] messages to you come on now come on it's
[11:05] time it's time I want to meet you in the
[11:08] resurrection come on
[11:10] you're theophany
[11:13] [Applause]
[11:16] so the theophany is the nature of the
[11:19] spirit and it has seven spirits to it so
[11:23] elohim comes back as dynamic in the form
[11:26] of seven spirits and seven rainbows
[11:29] coming from your theophany to form you
[11:34] into the word image to be ready for the

[12:39] justified you glorified you you're
[12:42] already glorified and he himself come
