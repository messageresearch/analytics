latter rain as Dynamics now for background this this for this message let's read Genesis 4547 where we already done it amen I was amen so we see here that there was a Great Famine in in the world Egypt and Joseph 14year prophecy I just went through it and 7even years of plenty had passed and there were 2 years of famine and 5 years was left and even right down there to to prove it I didn't read that verse but right he comes back in Genesis 45 verse 11 I'll read it and and there I will nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou in thy household and all that thou H has come to Poverty see they all they been wiped out it wasn't for Joseph and they had 5 years left see but he was going to nourish them they're going to eat in a day when Fair virgins would be running across the land amen and looking for something to eat looking for a Revival and there is none see it's a time of nourishment they looking for in the wrong season looking for Great Signs and things uh that can't be here it's time to eat amen then we'll go outside after we finish eating amen praise God amen amen see oh my don't know where to get started at I don't want to be too long I ain't got too much strength yay but I know the Holy Ghost is here I know he calls you here calls you by the Thunder don't you want to go yes sir now 5 years left with verse 11 no planting no Harvest nothing amen then they came down to the 5 years left the famine and then the money fell and he fed them with bread for all the cattle for that year then Genesis 4718 when that year ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not not hide from our Lord how that our money is spent and my Lord also hath our cattle there's not or left in the sight of my Lord but our bodies and our land they were wiped out in today's language they were wiped out they were finished they had nothing they were bankrupt praise God spiritually bankrupt naturally bankrupt couldn't go nowhere the Holy Spirit fall upon and they go out the door is gone yes sir Genesis 47:19 wherefore shall we die before Thine Eyes both we and our land there there's no question here they finally gave up all to Pharaoh but they begged Joseph you got to beg him now I'm not Joseph to the visitors here I am not Joseph amen I'm Joseph Coman but I'm not the Joseph here amen praise God I thank the Lord for my name cuz it
