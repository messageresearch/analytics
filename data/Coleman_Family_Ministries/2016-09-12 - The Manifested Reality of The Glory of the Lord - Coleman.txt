great things that's going to happen or is it judgment look back and see the promise of today and see what uh season we're living in God said how he would do it today how he would restore all things what he would do again he promised to restore that's exactly right Joel 2:28 he promised he would restore I will restore sayeth the Lord all he is at the cankerworms heat see that's the same worm it's in a different stage of life and when Catholicism started eeden then Lutheran Methodist Pentecost and all down he said I will restore everything back to a church exactly like the one at the first place well here we are amen the Eagles are ready to go so did you catch it right in the very hour of judgment there's also restoration oh Hallelujah and the Judgment don't mean a thing to us because I will restore saith the Lord same Bible back to the Bible same power same everything right in the hour of judgment to the church to the world system they're fading away praise God in the brightest fading from humanistic praise God into God man G Messiah Hallelujah Reapers for the final Harvest oh Hallelujah you may be seated okay so we thank the Lord amen the Holy Spirit has visited us to confirm Malachi for his message back to us for these 19 years amen and so what is it today Church uh judgment to the church World restoration to the bride and oh my like the song was sang Here the Flight of the Eagles we are leaving uh this Earth this Earth here the bride of Christ we're getting ready to leave and the whole Holy Spirit itself is here and how we had a a a mighty service last night and with the young people amen young people speaking on leadership the person of Christ to lead us out of here he's the only one and how brother Joey Jr saying uh uh Jesus you the sent of my joy and the Holy Spirit poured out and Jonathan stepped in and amen just he couldn't even preach and he just had to just exhort amen cuz the Holy Spirit was already there so you anointed now young people you ready praise God and our visitors and Friends okay you may be seated so the Holy Spirit itself is here he dropped down in New York here supernaturally last Sunday amen New York the holy spirit is salvia from March 2nd 1975 came right off the tape and here we are praise God okay what is it may be seated the Dynamics to I'm mechanics the Holy Spirit Dove right in time with the eagle next message Dove leading eagle and here we are eagles ready to fly out of here brother oh we speak it we know it's right praise we have to figure it out no more we just say it say it to figure it out we we know it we speak it amen you may be seated the Holy Spirit do is here now leading the Eagles all the way to spiritual adoption into the resurrection and physical adoption and on into the Rapture with our Lord Jesus Christ you believe that and judgment is roaring across the Earth and now when they see the things predicted happen saying thus saith the Lord happens then they say give us some of your oil is that the hour the prophet spoke about was it's here we're actually living in that hour there got to be oil on the earth on the earth somewhere for somebody to say give me some oil they don't see how can they ask for it you're too blind to the promises of Malachi 4 anyway so therefore they got to see something happen oh Hallelujah see it manifested somewhere amen okay uh so now Malachi 4 said uh about the world system and USA and prophecy and so forth and we know the sign that he gave us and um on God's uh Covenant with Abraham 56- 0428 um I didn't mean that to do any harm women now see uh the women is the sign of the end time for this nation okay you know that now so this I don't just hundreds of quotes but I just want to pick out a few I feel that it will will hit the the the the time in a season and nail it down before I can preach amen you got to know what I'm talking about I don't mean you Christian women see not talking to you now see uh but just to see a woman coming into politics and everything it's a disgrace huh are you reading the papers amen it's a Breaking of the American morale and remember this is America well a woman I better leave it alone but just remember this I predict this that a woman will be president before we are annihilated that's right I said that in 1933 by a vision where are we at church we better wake up I tell you that and then uh on the seven uh Church ages uh Exposition chapter n Ley and church age uh then just to speak about the sixth Vision then from 1933 then in the sixth Vision they rose up in America most powerful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic church now watch though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women so my my we are somewhere huh so then now what's predicted by Malachi 4 to happen to the women in our day and on teaching on Moses 1956 uh I predicted that women would keep demoralizing and the nation would keep falling and they they'd keep hanging to mother or like mother like or mother a like mother like that till they become a woman become Idol and after a while that America would be ruled by a woman mark it and see if it's not right a woman will take the place of a president or something of great some high power in America where are we at who is the co-president praise God that everybody knows huh praise God we know who it is amen okay uh the mark of the beast 1956 America has refused Christ as their God and received women as their god what have they done they stripped their clothes while it's a disgrace for a decent person to walk down the streets of any City what does that show that shows just exactly what's in a woman's heart Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them they have disgraced Womanhood why because that a woman has become a goddess like Eve was in the Garden of Eden Adam turned his back on God and went with Eve and America and the rest of the world has turned their back on God and went with the woman that's scorching but that's true look around he says just look around see the naked in the street and everything else and the men worshiping the woman the female body you see it amen so we thank God we out of it amen Praise by a message from a prophet amen that's why these Pentecostal churches and different ones they don't know how to get out of it so they have all kind of strange uh teachings on sex and everything else the handwriting on the wall I think the whole nation of America has become a modern urinal you hear what I saying America has become a modern urinal in the sight of almighty God when a divorce and rape and crime and stop it if you can you can't stop it God said it would be so and she's right for judgment now here's what we do purpose in your heart that you will not defile yourself from the things of the world it's up to you but you want to do praise God you want to be part of this world well brother I don't know in the second seal on the second seal from the Seven Seals he said um now he gets into a place about the Beast here he's going to make a universal church power taking religious power and do you not understand my brothers that when this nation appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation this little animal raised up like a lamb it's got two horns civil and ecclesiastical power but he done the same thing the Beast did before him it is strange America's is number 13 and a woman and it is strange that it appears on the 13th chapter of Revelation you know 13 colony and stars and the whole thing there amen Miss Liberty and you know the whole thing is a woman see and we started out with 13 stripes in the flag and 13 stars and and everything 13 13 13 13 all the way down and everything is woman woman woman all the way down spoken to us by a prophet Malachi 4 praise God so we know where we at we know the sign is all around us now uh what now when did

seated Malachi 4 left some notes uh for an unfinished message when he was taken home in 1965 I suppose all you know about it only believe from Sister Rebecca and George Smith and on first page here is on the back cover is a quote and on the first page the quote is taken from a collection of brother bram's handwritten sermon notes which is on display in the William brandham Memorial live library in Tucson Arizona he titled this set of notes the glory of the Lord but brother Brandon went to be with the Lord before he could preach this message amen and it says here on the back he wrote these notes out and sister Rebecca has him and it says he was getting ready to preach this and was going to title it the glory of the Lord notice him Elijah in the cave now watch he named some people's name names here the Oneness storm Billy Graham Earth shaking campaigns Aro robberts the Pentecostal Russian wind never move the prophet they were only effects of his passing by but what attracted the Prophet Elijah now here it is Here's my thought it was the glory of his voice word revealing his his glory plans yes sir amen may be seated the prophet waited on his office notice as a typ not long then to the Rapture that's my inspiration praise God he was only near in Wind earthquake fire Etc the man of God waited for manifested reality Vindicated word abiding Glory so here we are Oh Glory to God Amen The Prophet's next message would have been this the glory of the Lord and I I hadn't seen this but uh July 12th the Holy Spirit gave me inspiration for the glory of the Lord and then so I had it in my heart and I believe I went to uh Fellowship there with the brother and sister China and West Barry here where they at over somewhere around here over here right over here okay um and I begin to talk to them well I was talking to you and sister Miram about the glory here I didn't tell nobody in the church I just told you to amen and I didn't know why but now you're a witness that's why see you don't know why you do things I and even we spoke on the scripture 2 Corinthians 3:18 amen amen so I know then then the book come I said oh no my yes so only added to the title the manifested reality of the glory of the Lord is it time for a manifested reality huh the pillow of fire come Among [Applause] Us and manifest the things that the prophet predicted will be happening I think the minds are blown out my hallelujah oh Hallelujah okay friends so now you understand his title is to be the glory of the Lord he could not preach it and there was this notes on the back cover now what a attracted the Prophet Elijah it was the glory of his voice word and after he was overwrought from uh the battle there and and then he went he had the great battle the seven seal burn sacrifice amen Fire come down and licked it all up and he had he had defeated bal's prophets and so forth amen glory to God and he said I hear the sound of abundance of rain he heard the sound of it then he said there no he said there is the sound of abundance of rain amen and then he got up and you know he told his servant he didn't see nothing and there is nothing like in the message there's nothing going on and he said go look again seven times I thank God for 19 years I looked again seven times Hallelujah cuz there is something praise God there right now the Holy Ghost is here and then Elijah had to run before uh Jezebel and there he sat on his juniper tree and there you have a great Mount Carmel and then Monday morning on the juniper tree amen but don't worry cuz eat some angel cakes praise God and get strengthened again get in the word then go on up to mount horb and went to mount harb and the The Voice the word spoke to him what thou doest Elijah he went into his cave then all sudden he said come out here and stand here and then the fire come the wind come the shakings and everything else but they were only effects and it didn't shake the prophet then exactly what God had told the prophet he repeated it back to him again the still small voice The Voice word and there he revealed his glory plans going down and anoint Elisha going down and anoint ju but that come from the word and Malachi 4 has brought you and I back to the Bible back to the word and the voice word will reveal the glory plan on the third page as we see woman woman woman praise God and Rome and and Israel coming together Hallelujah it be in the word Oh Glory to God back to the Bible back to the word hallelujah Glory may be seated but what attract the Prophet Elijah it was a glory of his voice word revealing his glory plans the prophet waited on his office as a type not not long then to the Rapture he was only near in the wind the earthquake and the fire the man of God waited for the manifested reality Vindicated word abiding glory and how we thank God for sending Malachi 4 amen we truly believe that it was the glory of his vice voice word that has given us the seven Thunder Faith to give us strength and courage and wisdom and knowledge Etc to wait on our promise and to make our calling election sure not long then to the Rapture Hallelujah glory to cut Glory not long than to the Rapture glory to God and when when when when when when that happens you may be SE when we see the Manifest the reality of the glory of the Lord then it's not long then to the Rapture and we looking for it to bring down here to come down here today on the third phase the start of seventh on Revival oh Hallelujah so we we have waited almost 28 years for manifest of reality Vindicated word abiding glory and it's here question what will attract the bride today answer it will be the glory of his voice word revealing his glory plans and and wherever this is preached and see signs wonders and miracles the bride across the world will be attracted Hallelujah she come out of them bushes or wherever she's at in them dead places praise God them Eagles will fly again Hallelujah they'll fly to this Valley no that ain't it next Valley that ain't it then she'll find the right one she'll find the glory the abiding Glory manifested reality Hallelujah glory glory to God yes sir oh Hallelujah may be seated the voice of God in the last days page six you see there's so many voices in the Earth today that is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there's so many intellectual voices great voices a mighty man who intellectual that in their intellectual conditions can even Shake Nations they just not overnight people they Shake Nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowery and a person would be a bit confused like today amen it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper and there's voices that raise up and do things do these things and it causes the voice of God from Malachi 4 to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of God and the voice of God they say how will we know it's the voice voice of God because for today then it was in a Vindicated Prophet now today we know it is the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word manifested reality of the glory of the Lord and then we will know amen this is God's Prophet The Bible and true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural God with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know it is the voice of God because that uh there's so much other in the other Realms that almost just deadened that out but remember it will glisten it will come forth it will do it and is doing it now yes sir so we thank God so many voices in the land today amen and off of the and off of the voice of the voice word to reveal the glory plans and now the voice word we know is here from the prophet and is doing it now amen because it will be his voice word revealing his glory plans and we have to have this cuz we don't know how to get out of here is that correct we have got to have the glory plans and we can only get it from The Voice word from the prophet preach the word Glory okay because it will be his voice word revealing Glory plans see I'm tying it down on the third phase on the third phase will be the word the word the word in the nation the woman the woman the woman but in here the word the word the word hallelujah oh sh glory to glory praise God yes sir Hallelujah and the most glorious thing about it you may be seated it shall remain when it comes unto the resurrection and the Rapture because it's manifested reality is Vindicated word Vindicated word means that this coming of the Holy Spirit itself is already Vindicated your adoption is already Vindicated cuz the prophet preached it and loosed it the resurrection is Vindicated the Rapture is Vindicated the wedding supper is Vindicated the Millennium Vindicated the new home in glory Vindicated so if it's Vindicated what do h you to preach it seven Thunders Vindicated already then if it's Vindicated it reveals Glory abiding Glory it'll be with us from here on out put you on a rra to express Hal Hallelujah my God we shall be changed we shall be changed amen from glory to glory to glory to Glory Hallelujah

from your words of Christ and they couldn't receive it amen same thing in denominations huh they Veil Baptist Methodist Catholic Veil same thing in the message huh Veil men's interpretations Veil
