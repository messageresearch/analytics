[2:01] bless all of those that have not been
[2:02] able to gather here this morning in the
[2:05] Lord father we pray that thy blessings
[2:08] be upon them this morning now father
[2:09] bless your word and come down and
[2:11] fellowship with us this day but we ask
[2:13] it in Jesus name
[2:16] amen well we certainly praise the Lord
[2:19] amen to be here amen and it's good to
[2:22] see the people in God's house once again
[2:26] uh tonight's message is the Easter seal
[2:29] and to me is uh this is the appropriate
[2:32] time to be playing such a tremendous
[2:34] message as the Easter seal and next week
[2:37] would be the rising of the Sun and after
[2:40] we don't know praise the Lord so um
[2:43] we're certainly happy to hear about
[2:45] sister Francis Whitaker uh in the
[2:47] hospital and
[2:49] how God touched her body and so forth
[2:52] and how he is mending her and in that uh
[2:57] Wednesday um feeling a letter Wednesday
[3:00] when we got the call from Brother
[3:01] Richmond last
[3:03] Tuesday and uh things happened here in
[3:06] the church what with the somebody broke
[3:08] in here last Tuesday into the church
[3:11] there and tried to steal but there was
[3:12] nothing to steal and we just believe
[3:15] that the presence of God because
[3:17] convicted them for from taking anything
[3:19] in here because God is here see and so
[3:22] we thank the Lord for that and so these
[3:25] things being then the call coming from
[3:27] Brother Richmond and sister Francis
[3:29] being in the hospital there and then
[3:31] because immediately it took us to prayer
[3:33] and then Wednesday afternoon I was
[3:34] asking the Lord for a sign that if he
[3:37] would had me to go out to see our sister
[3:40] or whether to come down here and to have
[3:42] prayer and I got home and the sign came
[3:45] because she said that she was feeling
[3:46] better because we had prayed people had
[3:48] prayed and there was my sign to come
[3:50] here and in that coming here we had a
[3:54] little special prayer here if you
[3:55] remember it seemed like hardly the
[3:58] people could be able to pray 12 minutes
[4:01] seemed to be so weak you know you
[4:03] couldn't hear nothing coming forth you
[4:06] begin to wonder that wasn't anything
[4:07] coming forth you see so just noting that
[4:11] and a sister uh last week asking me last
[4:14] Sunday night telling me about her
[4:16] condition about because hard to pray
[4:19] which we all know it is you see so that
[4:21] sort of struck up on my heart and began
[4:24] to think about it and so the lord gave
[4:25] me a little message this morning because
[4:26] about prayer and and I I trust that it
[4:29] it'll be a blessing to everyone this
[4:31] morning because if there's one thing
[4:33] that we have to do that is to exercise
[4:35] our ministry as believer priest and as
[4:39] believer priest no matter where you are
[4:41] no matter where your home on the job on
[4:44] the subway in jail wherever is at that's
[4:47] one Ministry that you can exercise is
[4:50] that right amen you can exercise that
[4:52] Ministry anytime and the other part of
[4:54] it giving thanks unto God with the fruit
[4:56] of our lips that's all it requires a lot
[5:00] of people they don't want to do a work
[5:01] for the Lord there is right there amen
[5:04] that's the greatest work that you could
[5:07] do for the Lord is to lay on your face
[5:10] in this hour and pray one for the other
[5:13] you couldn't do a greater work see
[5:15] because in that you have entered into
[5:17] your secret closet and there all the
[5:19] little things that annoy you that you
[5:21] can't overcome you ask the father in
[5:23] secret he removes them in secret so when
[5:27] you come here the others don't see those
[5:30] things you follow me now but if you'll
[5:32] never go in there those things stay with
[5:34] you out in the open then the other see
[5:37] these things you see I mean now so
[5:39] therefore you go in secret into your
[5:41] prayer closet then there are those say
[5:44] that they can't pray well we want to
[5:47] exalt you with love this morning that
[5:49] you've got to pray you just must pray
[5:52] you see so uh because um James said the
[5:56] effectual fervent prayer of the
[5:59] righteous veth much am for uh it is
[6:01] through prayer prayer is
[6:04] asking so God has all of his blessings
[6:06] laying there if you never ask for the
[6:09] blessings through prayer how can you get
[6:11] themen we can walk around say well I'm
[6:14] tired I'm worried but if you have the
[6:16] strength to say I'm tired brother I'm
[6:20] weary sister Well you certainly can have
[6:23] the strength to fall down on the ground
[6:25] and fall out and say Lord God Almighty
[6:27] help me same strength
[6:30] amen amen and even in in a better
[6:32] position on the floor where you don't
[6:35] have to use because you stay on the
[6:36] floor that's all amen amen praise the
[6:39] Lord just trying to exalt you to come to
[6:45] the place that we could approach the
[6:46] message this morning now um so I believe
[6:50] that we all are standing in a need of
[6:52] prayer I know there one Ministry because
[6:54] I lack in for time and everything else I
[6:58] I just wish that I could have a a a
[7:01] Ministry where I had time but with
[7:02] working and all these things you just
[7:04] don't have the time but I believe that
[7:06] we that we have some people here that
[7:09] are praying for us that is the greatest
[7:11] need that we pray one for the other cuz
[7:13] if you can only understand it see it is
[7:16] the the blessings of God you ask for
[7:18] them and the father knows what you need
[7:21] amen but you got to come and ask for it
[7:23] if if my little children there if they
[7:24] want something because I we'll give it
[7:26] to them but they don't ask for it how do
[7:29] you know what they they want so is that
[7:31] right see so our father he tells us to
[7:35] ask for it so in this hour now you or we
[7:38] are wary and we're tired but uh God has
[7:42] a way to uh encourage us to prayer and I
[7:47] like to be encouraged to Prayer by the
[7:49] word that's the Bible Way see uh you
[7:52] know see and because this is what he's
[7:55] going to honor is the word of God so
[7:59] therefore
[8:00] we want to turn to the word of God this
[8:02] morning now the the lesson is found in
[8:06] Ephesians the 1 chapter the 15th verse
[8:09] through the 20th
[8:12] verse you're writing it down St Matthew
[8:15] the 7th
[8:16] chapter verse 7 and
[8:19] 8 Jeremiah the 33rd chapter verse
[8:25] three now you be praying as we bringing
[8:28] forth the message this morning
[8:31] [Music]
[8:32] this seems that we're in the book of
[8:34] Ephesians in and out you know I thought
[8:37] about it it was just odd this year how
[8:39] see like the Lord has been dealing in
[8:41] threes since January I think it was just
[8:43] January that the lord gave the messages
[8:46] to me here the Christ all astronaut the
[8:50] the crucified ones and forsaken then
[8:53] crown and then reflecting back and
[8:56] thinking about those messages right in
[8:57] threes uh it was uh uh the Holy Spirit
[9:00] telling us the type of ministry what we
[9:03] must do because uh be crucified in
[9:07] Christ is the As and all these things
[9:09] they shown us all of these types and G
[9:11] and coming down by Revelation and giving
[9:14] us understanding of the Apollo 8 and 7
[9:16] and 9 and all these things here see God
[9:18] is doing something see and then not
[9:21] preaching at all in February and coming
[9:23] back in March the first three messages
[9:26] uh coming Faith worketh by love if I if
[9:30] that's correct and then um The Way of
[9:33] the Cross and then the following one
[9:36] which I knew I had to preach something
[9:37] else about love not knowing just what it
[9:39] was then forgiving see that was in in
[9:43] the Times paper they I saw it and just
[9:45] tied in together Holy Spirit then it was
[9:47] finished it's it's three so now it seems
[9:50] like come right back to again to Faith
[9:53] again see and and seem like God has tied
[9:55] in with this prayer seeking
[10:00] knocking see so perhaps the Lord will
[10:03] give another series of three see leading
[10:06] right up to Easter I don't know but it's
[10:08] I just feel moving into that vein see I
[10:11] just feel that we are in the
[10:13] season I feel that we in the time
[10:16] Hallelujah where God has been leading by
[10:20] his
[10:21] spirit and he's doing a work which is
[10:24] beautiful to see we're just following
[10:27] see but he's just moving and then you
[10:30] stop and reflect back and see what he's
[10:32] doing see and then you give praise to
[10:35] God when you see what he's doing so I
[10:38] feel at this Junction of time it is time
[10:42] to encourage the people to pray and to
[10:45] seek the Lord amen see because I want to
[10:47] show you this morning that it is while
[10:48] in this state see this condition that
[10:52] the holy spirit moves on the scene you
[10:56] follow me now see but he must himself
[10:59] not through emotion get you all worked
[11:01] up hallelujah we're going to oh the holy
[11:05] spirit because because come down and
[11:07] glory to God no by the word it must come
[11:11] by the word thank you Lord so we don't
[11:13] try to work you up and tell you we all
[11:15] be in one place and hallelujah we're
[11:17] going to be baptized no sir see just
[11:20] going along preaching day by day and
[11:22] when the hour comes with the right
[11:24] message and then strike it see me now
[11:27] and then he reveals to his people what
[11:29] his will is then those that know it's
[11:33] the will of God by
[11:35] experience not by head knowledge but
[11:38] sitting here God has revealed to their
[11:41] hearts with a revelation is an
[11:44] experience is a birth into the word
[11:48] that's right see each step each way of
[11:51] the word must be a birth as brother Kurt
[11:54] and I were talking about the Adams and
[11:55] think all is a birth and then brother BR
[11:58] himself said on the uh Blasphemous names
[12:01] he said you have been birthed into
[12:04] virtue you have been birthed amen into
[12:08] knowledge you have been birthed into
[12:11] patience birthed into godliness birthed
[12:14] into brotherly kindness and birthed into
[12:18] love then that has come by experience
[12:22] not because brother brandham said so or
[12:24] the Bible says so well we must have love
[12:27] no God
[12:29] has come down and and come in the heart
[12:32] and and come in there and you know that
[12:34] word becomes flesh in you and then you
[12:37] walk in and you live it amen amen see so
[12:41] now I pray this morning that that the
[12:44] the the the hour that we're living in
[12:46] that you will be birthed into the
[12:50] knowledge by Revelation that this is the
[12:54] season the time that these blessings
[12:58] must come
[12:59] I will restore sayith the Lord
[13:02] hallelujah amen we've talked about it we
[13:05] sang about it we have worship God about
[13:08] it but I believe with all this me that
[13:11] we have we are entering into the season
[13:14] I don't know what day Jesus there no
[13:16] special day but just you got to be cuz I
[13:20] check through the Bible and I find that
[13:22] when the time comes for a thing to
[13:24] happen he begins to prepare the heart
[13:27] that's what that's in the Bible that I
[13:28] can say so therefore it's not if the
[13:32] holy spirit is coming because it is
[13:34] coming amen amen the Holy Spirit himself
[13:37] the word is here the mechanics but the
[13:41] dyamics is coming that is thus sayith
[13:45] the Lord see and it's coming to you God
[13:49] will suddenly come to his Temple but
[13:52] that Temple must be prepared the right
[13:54] way Hallelujah even Solomon they when
[13:56] that Temple was built it was built with
[13:58] certain Stones everything was all fixed
[14:00] the right way and when they begin to
[14:02] praise God and when everything begin to
[14:05] get together amen then the fire come
[14:08] down and fill the whole house amen and
[14:12] when we by our Bible promise by the word
[14:15] of God in season birth into it amen in
[14:20] that condition of a pregnant woman you
[14:23] understand am amen praise God Amen that
[14:26] sweetness comes around and then that
[14:29] Earth comes forward he it's coming
[14:31] because it's in you now you're being
[14:33] formed and shapen by the power of God
[14:37] the power of God is the word of God
[14:38] hallelujah all it needs is fire to
[14:41] strength
[14:42] it hadn't even started preach yet amen
[14:46] praise the Lord so now I want to turn to
[14:50] Ephesians 1 15 through
[14:54] 20 I'm inspired this morning am amen I
[14:58] mean say I know is going to happen amen
[15:01] and I know that God has channeled this
[15:04] group here I'm talking about you amen
[15:07] see he has his Prophet has espoused you
[15:10] to Jesus Christ he's given certain
[15:12] promises that are going to happen and
[15:16] giving you faith faith is the Revelation
[15:19] that this is going to happen yes but it
[15:22] must be tested first on the promise
[15:25] whether it will or whether it won't
[15:27] happen then it must be the conviction
[15:30] give witness to it for a while six years
[15:33] so far no matter who says what but stay
[15:36] right with it God said so and it's going
[15:39] to be I look not at Lon vanities what
[15:43] what what s so is doing who fell who
[15:45] didn't fall what because who said so
[15:47] uhuh I look at the
[15:49] word Jonah looked back at the word if
[15:52] you'll look to this Temple if you're in
[15:54] trouble God you'll hear from God and
[15:57] then he saw the whales belly count all
[16:00] Lon vanities amen and we see all this
[16:02] sin is lon vanities God says his hand is
[16:06] on us amen and it's it's all amen I want
[16:10] to read say Matthew 7 7 and 8 Jeremiah
[16:17] 333 Ephesians the 1st chapter the 15th
[16:22] verse wherefore I
[16:24] also after I heard of your faith in the
[16:27] Lord Jesus
[16:29] and love unto all the saints cease not
[16:32] to give thanks for you make it mention
[16:36] of you in my prayers there's two great
[16:38] prayers here in Ephesians this one the
[16:40] one which we preached about and Faith
[16:42] worketh by love because Ephesians 313
[16:45] through 21 these two are these great
[16:48] prayers here in Ephesians if you check
[16:49] them out boy you begin to shout and
[16:51] praise God this is for you these prayers
[16:54] right here see cease not to give thanks
[16:57] for you making mention of you in my
[16:58] prayers now here's what he's praying
[17:01] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[17:03] the father of Glory may give unto you
[17:07] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[17:10] the knowledge now catch it there not
[17:13] knowledge head knowledge no sir
[17:16] Revelation in the knowledge birth
[17:19] experience in the knowledge then you
[17:21] know you got it then Satan can say what
[17:25] he want to say Satan I've been birth
[17:28] into heart dare you defy the living Army
[17:31] of God I mean I didn't just because here
[17:33] because God's Prophet say so I didn't
[17:36] read in the Bible is in my heart it's
[17:39] there and when the enemy comes hidden
[17:41] power comes out and bless that devil see
[17:44] to me now amen then you know you got it
[17:47] amen well these are the kind of people
[17:49] that's going to overcome that know they
[17:51] got it amen and you won't have to ask
[17:53] well can I pray can you pray brother
[17:57] praise our God
[18:00] amen the eyes of your understanding be
[18:04] enlightened that ye may
[18:06] know what is the hope of his calling and
[18:09] what the riches of the glory of his
[18:11] inheritance in the
[18:14] Saints Amen in that land of the Saints
[18:17] see and what is the exceeding greatness
[18:20] of his power to us W who believe
[18:23] according to the working of his mighty
[18:26] power St Matthew 7
[18:30] seven and 8 ask and it shall be given
[18:34] you that's positive there I mean he said
[18:37] so Jesus Christ himself said
[18:40] so seek and ye shall find knock and it
[18:45] shall be open unto you for everyone that
[18:48] ask it receive it amen see if you ask
[18:50] you've got to get it amen amen praise
[18:53] God and he that seeketh findeth and to
[18:57] him that knocketh it shall be open
[19:00] Jeremiah
[19:02] 33:3 call unto me his positive again I
[19:06] will answer not maybe hope so oh no I'm
[19:10] going to answer amen but just get on
[19:13] your knees and call to me amen amen
[19:16] praise God call unto me I will answer
[19:20] thee and show thee Great and Mighty
[19:25] things which thou knowest not amen am I
[19:29] believe that this morning the Holy
[19:31] Spirit picked these scriptures out we
[19:33] knowing that there's something that we
[19:35] want to know amen there's seven Thunders
[19:39] laying back there but he's got a
[19:42] prescribed way to approach that you must
[19:45] approach it through the word not through
[19:48] hysterics not through uh men running up
[19:51] and down and telling you well I believe
[19:53] it means this no that's that's all right
[19:56] but that's not what we're talking about
[19:57] amen you talking about now see and not
[19:59] with everybody trying to make a great
[20:01] show in the flesh not with all the
[20:04] scribes preaching deiling Shepherds and
[20:07] so because the under Shepherds and so
[20:08] forth no sir that who is giving you the
[20:12] bible promises what God Said So now
[20:15] Jesus Christ in this hour feeling LED
[20:19] this week that uh we would give you an
[20:23] encouragement to pray so I like to title
[20:27] this little thought encourage M to
[20:29] prayer see cuz I believe at this
[20:31] Junction that we should be encouraged
[20:35] the blessings are laying there and I
[20:37] believe we're in that very season where
[20:40] it's going to happen so then if God he
[20:43] could only move through his word so he's
[20:45] got to get his people in a condition you
[20:48] follow me now to have the heart to
[20:51] receive that but if they just walking
[20:53] along yeah well he's supposed to do so
[20:55] and so and so but that he can't move
[20:57] there you see you got to be waiting for
[20:59] that you got to be looking for that you
[21:02] got to be seeking for That Knocking
[21:05] asking for that so therefore uh his
[21:09] disciples seeing him when they walk
[21:12] there there they noticed that he prayed
[21:14] a l and he knows that he had overcome
[21:19] they knows he had power they knows he
[21:22] had peace and they said Lord teach us to
[21:25] pray see to me now they know that that
[21:27] was the secret amen and he taught him
[21:30] this uh a great New Testament prayer
[21:32] here see then he went on tell them other
[21:34] things here over in uh because Matthew
[21:35] 6:7 there s on the mountain all these
[21:38] things but the thing that struck me is
[21:40] when he said ask and you shall receive
[21:45] amen seek and you shall find knock and
[21:49] the door shall be open so therefore
[21:53] Jesus Christ
[21:54] himself encouraged us to pray amen by
[21:59] telling us to ask and to seek and to
[22:03] knock well then he said then that must
[22:05] be his way to find it cuz he said so
[22:09] amen so we go through the Bible but now
[22:12] it's got to be God's way amen see you
[22:15] just don't do it any kind of way you got
[22:16] to know how to approach God and that's
[22:18] why we had a prophet cuz many
[22:20] Pentecostals Hallelujah glory to God
[22:22] they had all kind of zal prayed prayed
[22:25] all night long prayed six hours up on
[22:27] the roof and all the all kind of things
[22:30] but it wasn't directed in the right
[22:31] channel you follow me now you can't pray
[22:34] and have
[22:35] sin expect to get
[22:38] anything follow me now see it's got to
[22:41] be the right way you can't pray and and
[22:44] don't have love in your heart because
[22:46] for your brother amen you can't knock
[22:48] down your brother and go home oh Lord
[22:50] give me the kingdom yeah no you won't
[22:53] get that way see me now no sir it's a
[22:56] condition to be met and and now I'll
[22:58] just you write down the scriptures
[23:00] because don't look for them cuz keep
[23:01] your head looking this way amen amen
[23:03] don't miss nothing say Amen you look
[23:05] down I say something then you missed it
[23:07] missed the thought amen but look this
[23:09] way you want right that's okay St John
[23:12] 15:7 now we want to find a condition
[23:15] amen praise the
[23:17] Lord St John 15:7 now here is his
[23:21] condition for answered prayer if ye
[23:25] abide in me amen
[23:29] and my words abide in you ye shall ask
[23:35] what you will and it shall be done unto
[23:39] you herein is my father glorified that
[23:41] you bear much fruit so shall you be my
[23:44] disciples so we find that it is God's
[23:46] will for us to Bear much fruit but his
[23:49] words must abide in us first amen I was
[23:52] just thinking when the Holy Spirit the
[23:54] pillow fire P out on the the day of
[23:57] Pentecost and he began to speak in
[23:59] tongues and prophesy and Shout Scream
[24:01] and holler all those devout Jews who
[24:03] knew the scriptures were standing there
[24:05] now if somebody didn't stand up there
[24:07] and put that in the word it would have
[24:09] gone off into fanaticism no matter how
[24:11] much fire so all those Dynamics without
[24:15] the mechanics wouldn't meant nothing but
[24:18] Peter stood up and said these Dynamics
[24:22] is that at the prophet Joel spake of now
[24:25] those Jews begin to thumb through the
[24:27] scripture in their mind well Joel did
[24:29] say in the last days I shall pour out my
[24:32] spirit amen well he put those old Jews
[24:35] in Bible order then then they had to
[24:37] give respect for the word of God was
[24:39] going for amen then right away it was
[24:43] established the apostles Doctrine and
[24:46] they contined steadfast in what in the
[24:48] apostles Doctrine so we have today we
[24:51] have the doctrine back but there's no
[24:54] Authority one says it's a a horse amen
[24:58] one say you have to go over to cus sign
[25:00] somewhere and one say you got to do this
[25:02] here there's got to come some Authority
[25:05] Amen to say this at the prophet Bram
[25:08] spake of it here it is this is what it
[25:11] means that's what it mean on the word of
[25:13] God Amen that's got to come forth then
[25:16] that brings you into the unity of the
[25:18] one Faith one Lord one baptism see that
[25:22] me now see so God does everything in
[25:24] order now so therefore the condition we
[25:28] have to abide in his word present tense
[25:32] and he has sent us a message which we
[25:33] shall abide in now I want to skip
[25:36] through this just mention these things
[25:37] to you now after we abiding in his word
[25:41] another secret of having answered prayer
[25:44] if you want to write it down James the
[25:47] first chapter it's another little secret
[25:49] see now we now we have received his
[25:51] words but you got to believe
[25:53] them just receive you have to believe
[25:56] them see them in not the B and live in
[25:58] you then ask what you will now James 1
[26:02] the 5th chapter fifth verse rather I'm
[26:04] sorry if any of you lack wisdom let them
[26:07] ask
[26:09] God uh that giveth to all men liberally
[26:12] and idth not and it shall be given him
[26:16] see asking given all the time see but
[26:18] let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[26:22] see for he that wave like a wave of the
[26:25] sea driven with the wind and tossed for
[26:29] let not that man think that he shall
[26:32] receive anything of the Lord a
[26:33] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[26:37] ways so we see then that when the
[26:40] promise comes and it has 63 then you
[26:44] tested on that promise the things that
[26:47] God said he's going to do you have to
[26:48] you have to have a test for it see me
[26:51] now and therefore James says now don't
[26:53] come here asking if you're not sure what
[26:56] this third pull is if you ain't sure
[26:59] that Christ has come down through his
[27:02] prophet and give out this message if you
[27:04] ain't sure whether there's been a
[27:06] baptism or there not a baptism or
[27:08] whether you ain't sure of these things
[27:10] don't even come here asking that's right
[27:12] cuz you don't know what you're asking
[27:13] foren you don't know the season you
[27:15] don't know the time you don't know
[27:16] anything you follow me now you see you
[27:19] see why the god of prayers not answered
[27:21] see so therefore don't come here
[27:24] wavering see don't come here doubting
[27:26] and staggering around I ain't sure
[27:28] in this group in that group maybe they
[27:31] got it over here just tramping around
[27:34] back and forth trying to figure out
[27:35] who's got it and picking up all kind of
[27:37] strange ideas and coming back and forth
[27:39] there unbelief don't even know where
[27:41] you're stand at but if you ever find it
[27:44] and get with some who's got it you can't
[27:47] help but stay there amen see praise God
[27:52] he that doubts is like a wave up on the
[27:55] Sea The Wave Rises up one big white caps
[28:00] glory to God
[28:02] Amen down it
[28:06] goes can't hear nothing amen it went
[28:11] down you don't hear that glory to God
[28:15] the great big white cap wave that'll
[28:16] toss a ship and knock it around
[28:19] amen you don't hear it no more see one
[28:23] minute he
[28:24] believes I believe it bless God go
[28:27] outside right and somebody say one
[28:30] little thing I ain't so sure about that
[28:32] now I
[28:35] heard so so wrote well he said this what
[28:39] does that mean see me
[28:43] now he says yes I believe brother
[28:47] brandom bless God brother BR go off the
[28:49] scene well I ain't so sure about that
[28:51] now why did God do that now what's he
[28:53] going to get in prayer are you following
[28:55] me friends amen see he can't make up his
[28:59] mind which way he believes see he
[29:03] staggers then helpless in prayer
[29:06] wavering like this wave up and down and
[29:09] God sit there
[29:10] waiting God says because Hebrews 116 he
[29:14] that cometh to God must believe that he
[29:16] is for without faith is impossible to
[29:20] please God Amen you've got to come to
[29:24] God not like a drunken man tossed to and
[29:26] fro up and down
[29:28] but this promise has been birthed into
[29:31] you this is the will of God for this age
[29:35] to come out of this layout of sea and
[29:37] filth to walk with my God for his hand
[29:40] is the arm of the Lord been revealed and
[29:43] we catch all of that tender handu nail
[29:46] SC hand we walk with it we want to walk
[29:49] with him we want to come out of this
[29:51] filth and mess my wife and I were just
[29:53] talking this morning we see all the
[29:54] hippie all things around here we thank
[29:57] God she was saying if we if we would
[29:59] only because reflect on what God has
[30:01] done not what they're doing out there
[30:03] but what he has done for us amen then we
[30:06] begin to praise God then we begin to
[30:08] shout then we begin to leap for Joy amen
[30:12] praise the Lord see we must believe a
[30:15] brother just wrote me here because from
[30:17] Tucson yesterday and told me that the
[30:20] hippies are invading Tucson coming in by
[30:24] the hundreds they have opened up a
[30:27] church a Pentecostal hippie Church where
[30:30] they wear shorts and all kind of things
[30:32] beards and everything in the church can
[30:34] you imagine if they asking God for
[30:37] something in there like that what they
[30:39] going to get in there that's right they
[30:42] are leaving California for they have
[30:44] prophesied that there's to be an
[30:45] earthquake the first eight days of April
[30:47] so they're getting out of California in
[30:49] droves the hippies they
[30:52] Inon invading it you and you feel spirit
[30:56] because you know what what that means
[30:57] now
[30:58] two signs being turned

[31:04] word um asking seek knock did you ever
[31:09] notice the word ask a seek s knock k a
[31:15] ask amen amen praise the Lord see me now
[31:20] asking seeking knocking a am ask and you

[31:26] receive amen amen see God is trying to
[31:29] get you a point where you will ask amen
[31:31] you've got to ask for it don't be
[31:34] bashful and W in here is scared to pray
[31:37] somebody might hear me if it's a sister
[31:39] she's scared she might speak out loud
[31:41] somebody because might look at her and
[31:43] and scared PR pray you believe it no
[31:46] matter what day Daniel wasn't
[31:48] scared and he was with unbelievers
[31:51] Hallelujah when the hour come he threw
[31:53] open that door there and walked out on
[31:55] his Veranda right there amen amen
[31:58] raise up his hands and them demons down
[32:01] there got man say Old King he's bowing
[32:05] down his knees now is that right well
[32:07] then what are you afraid you among your
[32:09] own people here why Wednesday the the
[32:12] light should have fell out in here amen
[32:14] the billing should have shook yes that's
[32:16] right because the Bible says so is that
[32:19] right acts four when they come back
[32:21] rejoicing that right am they prayed Lord
[32:25] God stretch forth your Mighty hand the
[32:27] place shook amen praise the Lord that's
[32:31] coming oh yes yes sir is it is a Bible
[32:35] uh pray is is it's a Bible because
[32:39] promise here see
[32:41] now if it's God's will to ask for what
[32:45] we want see then what we supposed to do
[32:48] now is to find out see just uh what we
[32:51] supposed to do and how are we supposed
[32:53] to do it in the season so we need to
[32:56] know what to pray for see me now and
[32:58] that's why I picked out Ephesians this
[33:00] morning cuz he there he tells we are in
[33:03] Ephesians you see and there Paul tells
[33:06] you exactly what to pray for therefore
[33:08] then is no doubt no staggering you say
[33:12] with me pray that I'll be filled with
[33:14] the spirit of wisdom me pray that the
[33:17] inner man will be filled me pray that uh
[33:21] uh the resurrection power shall rest on
[33:23] me yes amen he said he he pray that's
[33:26] what he prayed amen so therefore what
[33:28] would we pray in this church here a
[33:30] Bible prayer one for the other pray one
[33:34] for the other Lord God name them fill
[33:37] every one of them amen with your power
[33:40] amen go to your knees begin to pray one
[33:43] for another in here therefore don't pray
[33:46] for yourself in that sense cuz they're
[33:47] praying for
[33:48] you amen see he's praying for you and
[33:51] you praying for him and when that begins
[33:53] the spirit of God the word begins to get
[33:55] among the people amen do you see
[33:57] something happen friends amen so we in
[33:59] that season now don't forget that we in
[34:01] that season so God has given us many
[34:05] encouragements to pray seek ye the Lord
[34:07] while he may be found call upon him
[34:09] while he's near amen cast your your
[34:12] burdens upon the Lord he because he will
[34:14] sustain you draw an iron to God He will
[34:16] draw an iron these this what God Said
[34:18] these things said he and especially for
[34:20] this hour now when the devil's trying to
[34:23] separate you from God the word amen see
[34:27] therefore in the same hour we have many
[34:30] discouragements not to pray see and it's
[34:34] to get the bride off the track see or
[34:37] just come to this place and you forget
[34:40] about it just go around in the flesh we
[34:42] waiting for a certain thing that happen
[34:44] see there's no need to pray there what
[34:46] are you praying for when it's cuz they
[34:48] said this is going to happen see follow
[34:50] me now that's another trick then the
[34:52] unspiritual ones fleshy want to talk and
[34:55] eat all the time they don't want to pray
[34:58] so it there's another discouragement
[35:00] tell you like it is friend and then
[35:02] there's hosts of demon
[35:05] powers 200,000,000 demons trying to stop
[35:09] you from
[35:10] praying that's what you feel you want to
[35:12] pray we all want to the phone rings this
[35:16] happens the baby this all kind of things
[35:19] see me I know that and he knows that
[35:22] amen but he is watching the
[35:25] desire the earnest attempt to get there
[35:28] am if it's just one word Lord you know I
[35:32] try are you follow me now friends just
[35:35] an
[35:36] attempt if thou Wilt come on Peter he he
[35:40] got out there didn't he he made an
[35:42] attempt to get there and bless God he
[35:44] was out there
[35:45] too amen he was there he was walking at
[35:50] water if God come on see if you will
[35:53] come if you will be made perfect come on
[35:56] See Me Now so
[35:58] therefore we need to in this time listen
[36:01] to the Bible encouragements to pray
[36:05] Bible encouragement so I'm going to
[36:07] speak just a word this morning just to
[36:09] pray see and then there's those who
[36:11] don't want to seek the Lord they don't
[36:14] uh you heard brother BR go through it
[36:16] many times about the this person want to
[36:18] get it this way and they don't want to
[36:19] do this here they don't want to die out
[36:22] you heard them make all the different
[36:23] remarks about it and so forth they don't
[36:25] believe that but that's the way it games
[36:28] C the way to come sure did see now but
[36:30] they don't believe it nevertheless so we
[36:33] find Jesus Paul and Jeremiah with uh
[36:36] because encouragements to pray I'm just
[36:39] taking my time this morning see just s
[36:41] teaching it to you and so now um uh
[36:46] Ephesians that's right 1 here 15- 20 now
[36:50] we see uh Paul I want to speak about
[36:52] there two points that I want to bring up
[36:54] see and the first thing that we note the
[36:57] 15th verse wherefore I also after I
[37:01] heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
[37:03] praise God Paul heard about their faith
[37:08] in Jesus Christ he heard something else
[37:11] too their love for all the Brethren so
[37:14] he commended them for that see me now we
[37:17] ought to exalt one another for which he
[37:19] heard of it so these Ephesians had love
[37:22] for the Brethren they didn't go about
[37:24] tearing them down see me now if they
[37:27] they love their enemies MH are you
[37:29] following me amen and by loving your
[37:32] enemies you keep the presence of the
[37:33] Lord around you otherwise that evil
[37:36] spirit on Saul comes upon
[37:39] you jealousy mad hatred see that moves
[37:43] upon you but David just Ducks it God
[37:45] bless you brother praise the Lord see
[37:49] and then David stands there and talks
[37:52] now they might say well what is David
[37:53] hinting around about all the time
[37:55] insinuating all these things here the
[37:57] Lord did it brother brandham did it
[38:01] you're supposed to do that see cuz it
[38:04] must be
[38:05] revealed and others don't get it at all
[38:08] so you leave them alone they don't know
[38:09] what's going on they getting mad In the
[38:10] Flesh well what is going on anyway tell
[38:12] me word by word see so just like right
[38:15] now they different ones are wanting to
[38:18] brother H myself bring us out they want
[38:22] to know what are we preaching all of a
[38:24] sudden we've been there seven years
[38:26] nobody bothered
[38:28] all of a sudden this year letters come
[38:29] and uh give me a tape this and that and
[38:31] so forth we just going along like we
[38:33] always was praise the Lord amen we're
[38:36] just sailing along feeling fine leaping
[38:39] for Joy when the Trials Come turning
[38:42] them into Victory amen amen amen going
[38:45] along being formed into into His Image
[38:48] maybe you don't think so but I know so
[38:51] oh praise God there it is it matters not
[38:54] what you think don't you look at at my
[38:56] don't worry about God look on my
[38:59] heart amen see long as I try to do right
[39:03] do righteousness God is looking down
[39:06] upon on itall Amen just moving along so
[39:09] because we did this here A brother wrote
[39:11] me and said I heard your tape uh a more
[39:15] excellent a more excellent sacrifice I
[39:17] believe it was and your tape is just
[39:19] like is the word so and brother a
[39:22] certain brother so and so is because
[39:25] he's only the word too so I want to take
[39:26] your tape and his tape and sent them out
[39:28] to the bride along with brother bram's
[39:31] tapes now I really wanted to tear to
[39:33] that other person see in the doctrine I
[39:35] mean see me know to divorce him from me
[39:39] cuz what he preach I don't believe that
[39:41] at all see but I couldn't say anything
[39:43] so I wrote back brother I don't think
[39:46] it's right that I should even be
[39:48] mentioned in the same breath with the
[39:50] prophet my tapes is the message here is
[39:53] for the local Right Here Local see it's
[39:56] not for out there it's for him here cuz

[40:04] months we following it Peck at it here
[40:07] PE at it there Peck at it here and Peck
[40:09] at it there then all of a sudden two

[40:32] moving in here moving over there and we
[40:34] cut that thing to Ribbons at the right
[40:37] time it may take a year sometimes we
[40:40] keep keep pecking at it keep it down
[40:42] amen get in your way amen amen amen
[40:46] praise we know what we're doing he told
[40:48] us to do that we're in the line of duty
[40:52] if you're in the line of duty I believe
[40:55] right this morning if I'm in the line of
[40:57] duty if somebody fell out here dead and
[40:59] it's God's will we could pray and bring
[41:01] him back to life I believe that in the
[41:04] line of duty for Joshua Way was in the
[41:07] line of duty God says I give you the
[41:09] land kill them demons out there well he
[41:11] was killing them and the sun went down
[41:14] lord God send us some more Sunshine out
[41:16] here moon go back over there sun come
[41:18] out and shine here while we kill these
[41:21] demons amen we can only kill them in the
[41:24] sunlight the word so we got to preach
[41:27] the sunlight to kill the demons amen
[41:30] then the demons they begin to fly and if
[41:33] it's a strong Wheat Field the weeds
[41:36] die the heads go down they didn't make a
[41:38] sound no more amen that's a strong weed
[41:41] feel but if it's a weak weed feel those
[41:45] weed run over your church tear you down
[41:48] amen by the grace of almighty God it's
[41:52] been his will to stand here and it's his
[41:55] will that you should believe it's every
[41:57] every word that's been preached I'll
[41:59] stand for it in the day of judgment am
[42:01] everything I've said there are those who
[42:04] sit here with you then take words out of
[42:08] here to others who are waiting to hear
[42:10] it and the others swear you're talking
[42:12] about them all you doing is pining down
[42:15] the spirit in the Bible if they go back
[42:17] and tell a person well brother com said
[42:19] you was a so and soul you didn't even
[42:21] mention the prince's name but you tore
[42:24] that Spirit up in the Bible and they see
[42:27] that person what you're preaching and
[42:29] they run right out and say well brother
[42:31] K spoke about you not even knowing what
[42:34] they're
[42:35] doing I hope you see that amen amen one
[42:38] time we were preaching about balam here

[44:00] you follow me now if it don't come to
[44:03] love forgiveness humility kindness peace
[44:08] and joy and temper that ain't the spirit
[44:09] of God I know that you you all should
[44:13] know that if he call you on the phone
[44:15] and talk against because your because
[44:17] your p and so forth here that ain't
[44:18] God's spirit that's right it's of the
[44:21] devil amen so well you say well all
[44:24] right see then you use wisdom see you're
[44:26] trying to separate to send from that
[44:28] person with love with wisdom see so you
[44:32] you go on you pray for them
[44:34] amen how do we get over here praise the
[44:37] Lord now amen so therefore we find then
[44:41] that Paul said he heard of their faith
[44:44] in Christ their love for all the saints
[44:47] See Me Now friends see that's a
[44:49] wonderful Church isn't it am amen see
[44:52] now we want to examine the character
[44:54] number one in the contents of this
[44:57] tremendous prayer see now four things
[45:00] because I mention quickly that because
[45:02] we note here Paul was an intercessor he
[45:05] prayed for others amen that's the first
[45:07] thing see then Paul gave up Thanksgiving
[45:12] while right here in Ephesians 1:3
[45:14] blessed be God and the father of our
[45:17] Lord Jesus Christ who ha present tense
[45:20] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[45:23] in Heavenly places that's how he
[45:25] approach God and Jesus Christ he taught
[45:27] us to pray Our Father the first thing
[45:30] come out of your mouth you're giving
[45:31] glory to God Who Art in Heaven if you
[45:35] say that your father's in heaven Satan
[45:37] got to tremble yes cuz you telling the
[45:40] devil that your father is in heaven amen
[45:42] amen see me now so that's a a prayer of
[45:45] faith and then before you ask for
[45:47] anything thy will be done in earth as it
[45:53] is in heaven then ask for your daily he
[45:56] know what you need but he wants you to
[45:58] ask for it there's your prayer amen then
[46:02] ask for because forgiveness and you go
[46:04] on down the line keep us because lead us
[46:06] not into to temptation but Deliver Us
[46:09] from Evil and all these things see me
[46:10] now you pray in a Bible prayer amen and
[46:14] just Branch off as the spirit of God
[46:15] leads you but when you but Thanksgiving
[46:18] is very important because Hebrews said
[46:20] so a Believer priest with the fruit of
[46:23] his lips he's giving Thanksgiving to God
[46:25] giving praise to God Amen amen so Paul
[46:28] goes into prayer he begin to thank God
[46:30] for their election amen thank God for
[46:34] their because predestination amen thank
[46:37] God for their calling for their
[46:39] regeneration thanking God for they were
[46:41] predestinated onto adoption thanking God
[46:45] that they would have been half been
[46:46] translated from the power of the devil
[46:49] into the kingdom of God what you going
[46:51] to pray you ask me what can you pray you
[46:54] got all kind of things to pray amen amen
[46:57] am see pray they can't do it what see so
[47:00] therefore they're thanking God for all
[47:02] kind of things so what is he doing he's
[47:04] teaching us what we are to pray see and
[47:07] he's teaching what are the real
[47:08] blessings not those material things out
[47:10] there that don't mean nothing the real
[47:13] blessings of God is what I just called
[47:15] to you your calling your election your
[47:18] predestination your adoption which is
[47:21] coming amen that's what the spiritual
[47:23] blessings are he'll give any any other
[47:26] things if you seek Him
[47:28] First amen what you have now is what he
[47:32] ordained for you to have not another
[47:35] thing you better believe that amen your
[47:38] bed or living room whatever it is that's
[47:40] what you're supposed to have amen you
[47:42] follow me now your condition call
[47:44] whatever it is I'm talking about
[47:45] material things now but this other I'm
[47:47] talking about the spiritual thing this
[47:48] morning see what we pray for he gives
[47:51] you he he knows need he knows your need
[47:54] he knows what you have need of so but
[47:56] you got to come and praise and
[47:58] thanksgiving to God praise him see and
[48:01] people they don't want to praise God see
[48:03] here scripture comes to my mind here if
[48:05] you want to take it down 1st
[48:07] Samuel 1st Samuel
[48:10] 12 I I hope I don't be long this morning
[48:13] cuz I haven't got started yet amen am
[48:17] can you stay with me for a while praise
[48:19] the Lord I'm I'm trying to get over
[48:21] thought is just burning in my heart
[48:24] about prayer now you got to be taught we
[48:27] have to be taught not you we see now uh
[48:30] uh uh 1st Samuel
[48:33] 12:16 this was right after Israel wanted
[48:36] a king a vain desire in their heart they
[48:40] didn't want God because through his
[48:41] prophet Samuel they wanted a king okay
[48:43] God gave them the king see now just
[48:46] after that they had had asked for these
[48:48] things because their own Desir they
[48:50] don't want to ask for see why you have
[48:52] to be taught see me now so they asked
[48:55] for the king because they saw the other
[48:57] people have it same in the church today
[49:00] brother gets blessed Lord because let me
[49:03] do that there you don't know what God
[49:05] want for you you follow me now friends
[49:07] so they saw that the Nations had Kings
[49:09] out there they want same thing that's
[49:11] right that's caral see now if they have
[49:14] been seeking the things of God that
[49:16] would have been different see now the
[49:18] odd thing here it was right in the
[49:20] harest season when Samuel come out here
[49:23] see now therefore stand and see this
[49:27] great thing which the Lord will do
[49:28] before your eyes is it not wheat Harvest
[49:30] today I will call unto the Lord he shall
[49:33] send thunder and rain that you may
[49:36] perceive and see understand see that
[49:39] your wickedness is great which you have
[49:41] done in the sight of the Lord and asking
[49:43] you for because a king So Samuel called
[49:46] to the Lord and the Lord sent thunder
[49:47] and rain that day and all the people
[49:50] greatly fear the lord in Samuel and all
[49:52] people said unto Samuel pray for thy
[49:54] servants unto the Lord now they ask them
[49:56] to pray see to the Lord God that we die
[49:58] not for we have added unto all our sins
[50:01] this evil to ask us a king see and
[50:05] Samuel said unto the people fear not ye
[50:07] have done all this wickedness yet turn
[50:09] not aside from following the Lord see
[50:11] because stay right with it there see
[50:13] follow the Lord but serve the Lord with
[50:15] all your heart and turn you not aside
[50:17] for then should you go after vain things
[50:20] see which cannot profit nor
[50:24] deliver for they are vain
[50:27] for the Lord will not forsake his people
[50:30] for his great name's sake can you know
[50:32] all about the story about because
[50:34] because because Moses and so forth and
[50:36] Sarah see he can't do it see and also
[50:39] today his bride is in him you see the
[50:41] man now and there's a blood atonement
[50:43] for her sins you see because it has
[50:45] pleased the Lord to make you his people
[50:49] praise our god it pleases God to make us
[50:53] his people Samuel's here now teaching
[50:55] see to me now
[50:57] now here's Samuel just like Paul saying
[51:00] intercessor moreover as for me God
[51:02] forbid that I should sin against the
[51:04] Lord in ceasing to pray for you see but
[51:08] now watch but I will teach you the good
[51:11] and the right way and that's what by
[51:14] God's grace we're trying to do this
[51:15] morning teach you the good and the right
[51:18] way see me now the the Pentecost move
[51:21] come on it was
[51:23] intercessor because the Holy Spirit they
[51:25] were supposed to lay out and pray to God
[51:27] that God would bring on this entire
[51:30] ministry that's what they were to pray
[51:32] for for Wigglesworth Smith over in
[51:34] England over here God told him to pray
[51:37] for Israel's Deliverance a mighty
[51:40] healing campaign and the coming of the
[51:42] Lord he was told to pray for that by God
[51:45] himself
[51:47] 1937 he had a whole bible college and
[51:49] had everybody on their knees praying
[51:52] throughout the every day of of the year
[51:54] the month and so forth and then now that
[51:56] now they didn't get anything out of that
[51:58] in that sense but in 1946 here it come
[52:01] oh my God you follow me now here it come
[52:04] see so therefore what was it it was time
[52:07] for God to bring something on the scene
[52:10] but somebody had to be praying for it
[52:13] and I believe that God has called you
[52:15] today the Lord thy God calls you today
[52:17] to begin to pray to begin to seek to
[52:20] begin to knock for this something fixing
[52:22] to happen that's exactly right friends
[52:26] so therefore for uh uh uh we must be
[52:28] taught and then in teaching and set
[52:31] things in this prop because uh a
[52:33] perspective see now we don't always pray
[52:37] for material things we know that we pray
[52:39] for
[52:40] salvation we pray to go into Rapture yes
[52:43] sir see me now and when we see and when
[52:46] we see the results we see God's results
[52:50] here this morning so we can say blessed
[52:53] be the Lord God father Jesus Christ who
[52:56] have blessed us
[52:59] here with all spiritual blessings has he
[53:02] done it well then thank him for it then
[53:06] praise Him continually for it yes sir
[53:09] praise God the third thing is to be
[53:12] specific what you're talking about
[53:14] mention so and so into prayer say the
[53:16] name be specific what you're saying Lord
[53:19] bless uh those people down there and
[53:22] Lord bless that's nothing me get on in
[53:26] pray see me now and number four be
[53:30] constant fervent in season out of season
[53:33] pray always become a skip over this
[53:34] right here see me now because you
[53:36] understand this here Paul said always
[53:38] praying for you all all the time praying
[53:40] all the time see and I want to get to
[53:42] the second Point here cuz it's getting
[53:44] late now now uh the the first part was
[53:47] the character of his prayer see
[53:50] intercessor and then uh uh because
[53:52] constant because of a specific and so
[53:55] forth see and now uh this part of it
[53:58] here is the part that we want to get to
[54:00] see here he prayed that they would have
[54:02] in Ephesians um 1 I think is 17 here he
[54:07] prayed here that
[54:09] um that's right yeah see that the Lord
[54:13] God that that the god of our Lord Jesus
[54:16] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[54:18] you the spirit of wisdom that's right
[54:19] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[54:22] see so he's praying that that these
[54:24] Ephesians would be filled with the
[54:26] spirit of wisdom that that they would
[54:29] have the Revelation in the knowledge not
[54:32] just head knowledge all the tapes in the
[54:34] books no see Revelation in the knowledge
[54:38] are you following now friends see me now
[54:40] that's a big difference you know see and
[54:43] and knowing that in the heart and then
[54:45] because are knowing by the head so
[54:48] therefore you have to be birthed into it
[54:49] because second Peter 1 says so because
[54:52] as you add to your faith these Seven
[54:54] Virtues then you shall neither be Barren
[54:58] nor unfruitful in what in the knowledge
[55:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ But first you
[55:03] were birth into hear into hear and here
[55:05] and here and here and then love come
[55:07] down and kep the whole thing and then
[55:09] you were fruitful not Barren you produce
[55:12] the child amen amen produce that Jesus
[55:16] Christ see and then you then you know
[55:19] you when he's produced that day you know
[55:22] even as you known you know all things
[55:24] the veils lifted up see and God has
[55:27] allowed us to come in there and lift it
[55:29] up now to show us all of these things
[55:31] here there's something else to happen to
[55:33] you don't see and we know that it's
[55:34] going to give us Rapture in faith amen
[55:37] see now so he so therefore he's praying
[55:40] here for knowledge and power see but
[55:43] personal experimental knowledge see if I
[55:46] read about it like brother Bram said
[55:49] because him and his friend Jim po Jim po
[55:52] loves to read about hunting and fishing
[55:55] brother I want to read but I want to do
[55:56] it amen that's a difference I want to
[55:58] fish I want a hunt amen but Jim PO he
[56:01] read about it he sat there chuckled and
[56:03] and read and he knew all about hunting
[56:06] by knowledge amen he knew all about
[56:09] fishing by knowledge but brother Brandon
[56:11] brother he went out in the woods and he
[56:14] knew all about hunting and fishing by
[56:17] experience so much so he even saw a fish
[56:20] raised back to life
[56:23] amen so much so even so a squirrel
[56:27] amen he knew by experience amen that's
[56:31] what we want well Paul said to pray for
[56:33] that one for the other that's what he
[56:35] said this morning here you pray for that
[56:38] amen see now every Christian must have a
[56:43] personal
[56:45] revelation of in the knowledge of Jesus
[56:48] Christ there are people uh I have to say
[56:51] this now to a personal standers here
[56:54] they they're they don't quite get it see
[56:57] they in another
[56:58] age we've been trying for the past seven
[57:01] years to get the people here not to lean
[57:03] on the minister you follow me now and
[57:06] there's some that don't understand it
[57:07] they keep saying the minister it's not
[57:10] the minister you have got to have a
[57:13] personal experience with
[57:15] God I hope you can see that but some
[57:17] people say well get them anything happen
[57:19] get the minister call them no don't call
[57:21] call
[57:22] God he is the one that will minister to
[57:25] you not me or him
[57:26] Jesus
[57:28] Christ you pray to him and now suppose
[57:30] you laying over in the bed somewhere and
[57:32] you call on the Lord and God come in
[57:35] there with the power of God brother you

[57:55] see me now what is that that ain't
[57:56] nothing that's foolishness in one sense
[57:59] you understand I'm talking about now
[58:01] because you did cuz that's only a
[58:03] secondhand
[58:04] Revelation that's why because you're
[58:06] living off of his prayer you follow me
[58:09] now but God trying to get the people as
[58:11] individual to know him in what in the
[58:14] power of his
[58:16] resurrection amen amen how do he do it
[58:19] ask and it shall be given seek and you

[1:02:46] him he stood still and pontis pilot
[1:02:50] marveled I mean he was amazed then he
[1:02:53] knew he was something he was somebody
[1:02:56] he knew that see now I said Lord I said
[1:02:59] well why was that cuz he was absolutely
[1:03:02] absolutely sure positive that he was the
[1:03:04] word amen he was positive that that was
[1:03:07] the will of God Amen but then he said
[1:03:09] not a muming word cuz that had that was
[1:03:11] written that was the words written that
[1:03:14] they had to Smite him and do all those
[1:03:16] things that he had to be because to live
[1:03:18] it up then if I could come to that place
[1:03:22] oh if we could come to that place see me
[1:03:23] now and and and know when the things
[1:03:26] come just stand there kind to be Lord
[1:03:29] praise be to God then the spirit of the
[1:03:31] Lord Peter says doth rest up on you amen
[1:03:35] oh the holy spirit is resting right
[1:03:37] there and you saying forgive them Father
[1:03:39] for they know not what to do standing
[1:03:41] there yes brother you did so and so and
[1:03:43] so yeah well pray for me brother forgive
[1:03:46] me see Spirit of Christ is right there
[1:03:49] great praise him blessed be the name of
[1:03:52] the
[1:03:53] Lord that's the way friends God says so
[1:03:57] so these eight virtues brings us into
[1:03:59] the knowledge of God by Revelation Faith
[1:04:03] experience whatever you want to call it
[1:04:05] but it's got to be an experience you got
[1:04:06] to be birthed into it amen see otherwise
[1:04:10] it's nothing you just uh hear somebody
[1:04:13] shout about it and talk about it I want
[1:04:16] it I want it I want what God's profet
[1:04:20] had I want that that's right he was to
[1:04:23] come to prick us to jealousy right
[1:04:26] amen you understand to desire Joseph
[1:04:30] craved the body of the Lord oh yes to
[1:04:32] take care of the Lord's body he craved
[1:04:34] it the Bible say so he he went and asked
[1:04:37] for that body he craved for it because
[1:04:39] had a know him about asking a craving
[1:04:42] and begging and so forth but we don't
[1:04:43] have time to because because break it
[1:04:45] down but you can see the word ask means
[1:04:47] the Crave and the Begg and also because
[1:04:49] the desire but the right because the
[1:04:51] right desires of course you see so
[1:04:53] therefore brother Brown come to show us
[1:04:56] Jesus the father we saw it see me we
[1:05:00] were to be pricked into jealousy
[1:05:01] spiritual jealousy that we want that
[1:05:05] that we saw amen amen and that's what I
[1:05:08] want I saw it I mean they can blame me I
[1:05:12] saw it I don't care what happened I saw

[1:08:44] preparing somebody to come forth all the
[1:08:47] time when the hour came in 46 he had
[1:08:49] prepared a little humble Prophet down in
[1:08:52] the air is that right he had prepared
[1:08:53] him already 13 years prepared so when
[1:08:56] the hour come after Wigglesworth them
[1:08:59] have been praying for that hour somebody
[1:09:03] and one individual was prepared for that

[1:09:16] amen for their hour it's got to be by
[1:09:18] the very word at this Prophet brought
[1:09:21] preparing them don't you understand that
[1:09:23] the life come up from the stem it meets
[1:09:26] the sun and the soil it comes together
[1:09:30] that that wheat don't take on that life
[1:09:32] until the very end then when the sun
[1:09:36] strikes it the shook pulls back it
[1:09:39] begins to take on the very nature of God
[1:09:43] the very virtue patience and Temperance
[1:09:45] and so forth that's when it takes it on
[1:09:47] in the top of the tree that's what's
[1:09:49] going on now life is coming into you
[1:09:53] listen excuse me it's um
[1:09:56] the body is made up of chemicals that
[1:09:59] right Christ body is made up because of
[1:10:03] of of of chemicals also water blood and
[1:10:07] spirit is chemicals in his body but when
[1:10:12] he walked
[1:10:13] forth that was a life you follow me now
[1:10:17] that was what was on the inside of the
[1:10:19] heart he showed that was the word see
[1:10:22] but three components went to make up
[1:10:24] that bodies see these major three I'm
[1:10:26] speaking about see me now so but when he
[1:10:28] walked that was the life and that's what
[1:10:31] they can't understand see the spirit was
[1:10:33] in moving but you had to see the spirit
[1:10:36] made manifest a life and we have now
[1:10:40] entered the life age where the wheat
[1:10:43] takes on the form of the original
[1:10:46] wheat and it must be perfected first
[1:10:49] then when the wheat is dried out powdery
[1:10:53] ready for the grain not wet and and
[1:10:55] because of Milky you're almost dry just
[1:10:58] about dry now you can do nothing without
[1:11:03] him you are the vine even though you're
[1:11:06] dried wheat with the spirit of Christ in
[1:11:09] your heart you are still the

[1:11:25] the works he must come inside and do the
[1:11:30] works amen he must claim you for the
[1:11:33] resurrection yeah so when that happens
[1:11:37] Peter and them they went out they didn't
[1:11:39] care about nothing they were claimed
[1:11:41] their bodies was claimed with the power
[1:11:44] the resurrection power of God just right

[1:19:38] I'll just skip them about the eyes of of
[1:19:41] uh uh Paul says here about the eyes of
[1:19:44] our understanding here I believe so here

[1:19:51] here praise a lot big I don't want to
[1:19:53] hold you too long though but I want to
[1:19:55] be led to put this in here Ephesians one
[1:19:58] the eyes of our understanding being
[1:20:00] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:20:02] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:20:03] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:20:06] in the Saints see now what the eye is to
[1:20:09] the Natural Body see the eye now this
[1:20:12] understanding is the heart see now this
[1:20:14] eye is the spirit of the Lord for what
[1:20:18] uh uh a man know the things of the Lord
[1:20:20] except the spirit that's in him see
[1:20:22] because who knowe the things except the
[1:20:23] spirit in him because 1 Corinthians 2:11
[1:20:26] see so the spirit in you knows so
[1:20:29] therefore the eye the spirit of the
[1:20:32] inner man see he's the one who knows the
[1:20:35] hope of the calling amen see me now it's
[1:20:38] by the spirit and if it's by the spirit
[1:20:40] then it's a
[1:20:41] revelation amen you've been birthed into
[1:20:43] it see me now and so therefore These
[1:20:46] Eyes of your understanding in the last
[1:20:49] days These Eyes this little Spirit In
[1:20:51] You Christ was stagging around he and
[1:20:53] lay out of sea amen one day a Prophet
[1:20:56] come said anoint your eyes with isai
[1:21:00] that you may see where you're going amen
[1:21:02] amen praise be to God and and that
[1:21:04] little Spirit was there that seat of God
[1:21:07] was hanging in there it was way back in
[1:21:09] the shook but it come right into the
[1:21:12] sunlight and brother it raised up with
[1:21:15] new life and it knew where it was going
[1:21:17] then why it knew the hope of his calling
[1:21:21] amen hope of his calling it knew what
[1:21:23] the riches of the glory of his
[1:21:25] inheritance in the Saints was for the
[1:21:27] prophet taught us amen amen and with
[1:21:30] that Revelation praise be to God we got
[1:21:33] wisdom amen we have understanding amen
[1:21:36] and we have Revelation and we know where
[1:21:37] we walking amen and then when the Holy
[1:21:40] Spirit comes around and tells you it's
[1:21:41] time to seek the
[1:21:43] Lord time to seek the Lord amen you know

[1:21:56] each and every person here this morning
[1:21:58] amen see so therefore one thing here in
[1:22:00] closing I was thinking about uh because
[1:22:04] of how we need Paul is saying here we
[1:22:06] got to know the exceeding greatness of
[1:22:07] his power to usw who believe according
[1:22:09] to the working of his mighty power
[1:22:11] Christ knew that Mighty power when he
[1:22:14] died and so forth you understand that
[1:22:15] res resurrection power well we must know
[1:22:17] that power to overcome and so I was
[1:22:21] thinking about because the Apollo 8 and
[1:22:24] how what was the meaning behind that now
[1:22:27] the word here's the power see this is
[1:22:31] the power see the powder the gunpowder
[1:22:35] has power in it but the gunpowder with
[1:22:38] the power in it needs fire so here's the
[1:22:42] word with all the power this word can
[1:22:44] crush this world can paralyze it it can
[1:22:47] heal the sick raise that do anything a
[1:22:50] the word can see but it's laying here so
[1:22:53] it needs some fire amen amen I need
[1:22:55] somebody
[1:22:56] Faith the his words abiding in somebody
[1:23:00] not wavering amen amen who who believeth
[1:23:03] the mountain shall be moved and stands
[1:23:06] there amen that takes it amen who knows
[1:23:09] it see me now that's fire that's Faith
[1:23:12] well that was in this that was in you in
[1:23:14] seed form when you staggered out of
[1:23:16] these different churches you follow me
[1:23:18] that that that's the faith MH when that
[1:23:21] Faith which is Spirit Holy Spirit seed
[1:23:24] dagged out of these different churches
[1:23:26] the word which is power came into the
[1:23:30] church in
[1:23:32] 1946 you follow me now the Pentecost
[1:23:35] they have the word they were Hallelujah
[1:23:37] gifts and so forth see but the word come
[1:23:39] in in 46 with a gift of healing begin to
[1:23:42] preach the word amen second pull the
[1:23:45] word there was the power but they didn't
[1:23:47] get it they thought they had to go and
[1:23:49] pray somewhere and see no he was
[1:23:51] bringing the word and power the power
[1:23:53] right in the word amen amen so then he
[1:23:55] come with the third pull all the power I
[1:23:59] give it unto you what the word amen and
[1:24:03] different ones now in the message still
[1:24:05] don't understand it denying the power
[1:24:08] that's it see sing women running to this
[1:24:11] group to that group looking for the
[1:24:13] power when it's in the word then those
[1:24:15] who profess that it is in the word they
[1:24:17] blast them so you ain't got nothing they
[1:24:20] ain't no Holy Ghost and so forth see me
[1:24:21] now it is so is the seed of faith come
[1:24:24] out of these churches and so forth amen
[1:24:27] now that Faith reaches for the power the
[1:24:30] word on tap that's it in the Bible I
[1:24:34] claim that for myself I claim virtue I
[1:24:39] claim knowledge I'm burth into it now
[1:24:42] the other one ain't got that Faith so he
[1:24:45] gets a whole lot of people together
[1:24:47] hallelujah hallelujah waiting for the
[1:24:48] spirit when the power is in the word but
[1:24:52] the fire must strike it so the fire
[1:24:54] struck you 63 4 5 you begin to be molded
[1:24:59] and shaping the fire the faith in you
[1:25:01] did that are you follow me now friends
[1:25:04] here's the power he he brought the power
[1:25:06] the word back to the church he brought
[1:25:08] the thing that can raise her up the
[1:25:10] power of God the word of God but it
[1:25:12] needs Faith that's why his disciples he
[1:25:15] stood there the word came to the Jewish
[1:25:18] church that was weak like we were that
[1:25:21] right the word himself and said I give
[1:25:23] you power to to cast out Devils heal the
[1:25:25] sick and raise the dead that right he
[1:25:27] the word gave him his authority so Peter
[1:25:30] they they went out and did these things
[1:25:32] cuz they had faith in it but they come
[1:25:34] down the line and they reached this
[1:25:36] child here with the a demon in it and
[1:25:38] they couldn't cast out out their Spirit
[1:25:39] he said ye of little
[1:25:41] faith he he was all of the faith see me
[1:25:46] now so then on the day of Pentecost he
[1:25:48] poured that faith into them they already
[1:25:51] had the word he said but when that Faith
[1:25:53] Comes it'll bring the word the power to
[1:25:55] your
[1:25:56] remembrance they just walked out such as
[1:25:59] I have rise up in the name of Jesus

[1:26:11] there the spirit amen the the Dynamics
[1:26:15] it it walked out there and just pulled
[1:26:17] him up so now this faith in us he only
[1:26:21] wanted us to Ren they can't get there

[1:31:29] there you had to be with the private h
[1:31:31] no no sir you got to be with Jesus
[1:31:33] Christ am you got to have a seat in you
[1:31:35] spirit of God that that that that shouts
[1:31:38] and Praises God when he hears the word
[1:31:40] and moves out with it then he sits back
[1:31:43] and waits and sees who will take that
[1:31:45] word and step out and face uh because uh
[1:31:49] because criticism everything else and to
[1:31:51] preach what he said and live what said
[1:31:55] and he waits and that's their test
[1:31:57] though but they've been birthed into
[1:32:00] that and they know what happened and
[1:32:03] there's not the 200,000,000 demons can't
[1:32:06] take it away from
[1:32:07] them amen praise God cuz is placed in
[1:32:11] there before the foundation of the world
[1:32:14] Amen so therefore Faith to use the power
[1:32:17] in closing like I said now Apollo 8
[1:32:21] proved that the power was stor to the
[1:32:24] church I like to change it a little
[1:32:27] different type with that see now Christ
[1:32:30] because he's Apollo he came and went
[1:32:32] around the Moon because of poo8 right
[1:32:35] and went in orbit into the moon's orbit
[1:32:37] see went all around the moon now the
[1:32:41] great thing a crucial Point came would
[1:32:44] that rocket with the power in it see
[1:32:47] would it fire when the asut by faith
[1:32:50] would hit the button amen see the rocket
[1:32:53] had the power
[1:32:54] but they had certain buttons and things
[1:32:55] there they got to strike that button see
[1:32:57] by faith in that rocket that it would
[1:32:59] boost them up see and get them out of
[1:33:01] that moon orbit if they that rocket
[1:33:05] don't work that power amen they would
[1:33:08] stay and be trapped in the moon's
[1:33:11] orbit amen now now just think on it see
[1:33:15] amen now the almighty God look down into
[1:33:20] the moon the church amen covered with
[1:33:24] because lay are to se blind the moon
[1:33:27] wretched miserable now you know you know
[1:33:30] where I'm going now miserable poor naked
[1:33:33] and did know it the moon amen so when it
[1:33:36] got to that condition the pope moved in
[1:33:38] in ' 64 and blacked it out amen blacked
[1:33:41] it completely out nothing so then Christ
[1:33:45] began he he came down in secret and did
[1:33:48] a work around the moon and is that right
[1:33:52] but it come down to thec 68 by In the
[1:33:56] Flesh like so to speak in the natural I
[1:33:58] mean he had to show by sign what he's
[1:34:00] done he had to show that that message
[1:34:03] had the power amen had somebody in that
[1:34:07] church had faith in that word Apollo
[1:34:12] Christ the message which he dropped down
[1:34:14] here amen so therefore when those answer
[1:34:17] us my faith hit the button it went up
[1:34:20] amen that's it cuz if it didn't go up we
[1:34:23] he'll be trapped in the church
[1:34:27] forever but this message went into orbit
[1:34:31] and boost us up and around we went amen
[1:34:35] are you following me why because God
[1:34:38] created some Eagles down there that was
[1:34:42] in that Moon the church amen so he come
[1:34:45] himself apolla and circle it amen to get
[1:34:49] them Eagles amen amen now that Moon we
[1:34:53] wasn't born to live in that Moon there
[1:34:56] see he created to live with him another
[1:34:58] orbit but we was in the moon's orbit
[1:35:00] amen see and that orbit is controlled by
[1:35:03] demon powers and Satan so you're in his
[1:35:06] orbit the spiritual Wicked Powers see in
[1:35:09] the moon Pope he blacked it out and try
[1:35:13] struggle see me now but he gave a sign
[1:35:15] in December 68th amen that that message
[1:35:19] that power is ready now and it this
[1:35:23] message itself this word this power is
[1:35:25] ready he did it in the natural can at
[1:35:28] the right time by faith amen Dynamics
