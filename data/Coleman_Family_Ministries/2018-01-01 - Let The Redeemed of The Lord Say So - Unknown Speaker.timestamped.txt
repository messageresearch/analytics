[0:00] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[0:02] good for his mercy endureth forever let
[0:05] the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he
[0:08] had redeemed from the hand of the enemy
[0:09] and gathered them out of the lands from
[0:11] the east and from the west from the
[0:13] north and from the south
[0:32] [Music]
[0:40] where wast thou when I laid the
[0:42] foundations of the earth declare of
[0:45] highest understanding who has laid the
[0:48] measures thereof if thou knowest o who
[0:52] has stretched the line upon it whereupon
[0:56] of the foundations there are fastened or
[0:59] who laid the cornerstone thereof when
[1:01] the morning stars sang together and all
[1:03] the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:09] [Music]
[1:28] oh I've got a beautiful picture in my
[1:30] mind now if you could take a little trip
[1:32] with me and think now let's go back
[1:35] hundred million years before there ever
[1:37] was a star I mean or anything in the
[1:39] world now there was a time that there
[1:41] was nothing here just all forever
[1:44] eternity and all of ever and eternity
[1:48] Rose God he was there beginning now
[1:53] let's watch you're made to the Spanish
[1:55] er to look over and see these things
[1:57] happen now an old man has seen the
[1:59] father at any time now there's nothing
[2:02] and just faced in no life
[2:04] there's no dark there's enough it just
[2:08] seems nothing but in there is the great
[2:11] supernatural be Jehovah God who covered
[2:17] all those faiths of all the places at
[2:19] all friends he was from everlasting from
[2:23] everlasting he is the beginning of
[2:25] creation that's God can't see nothing
[2:29] tango nothing not a move of an atom in
[2:32] the air not nothing not aware no nothing
[2:35] but yet God was there that was gone now
[2:40] let's watch for a few minutes
[2:41] Angela nobody has seen that now that's
[2:43] the father that God the Father
[2:47] now in order then after a while I begin
[2:49] to see a little sacred life begin to
[2:51] form like a little halo or something you
[2:55] can only step up spiritual eyes to look
[2:56] now while we're looking the Holy Church
[2:58] now we're standing on a very big fan if
[3:00] you're watching what God's doing now the
[3:01] next thing we begin to see by as of
[3:04] supernatural looking we see a little
[3:07] white lie forming out there what is that
[3:09] that was called by Bible readers logan's
[3:12] are the anointed s or the anointing RV
[3:16] there's a little to say the the heart of
[3:20] God begin to develop into something so
[3:24] human beings as some type of an idea
[3:27] what it was it's a little low a little
[3:29] life-ruining we've ever the Word of God
[3:33] now God gave himself to the son which
[3:40] left before there was even an enemy in
[3:43] it to be our heir to make an end that
[3:46] was see Jesus at glory by me father with
[3:49] a girli that we had before the
[3:51] foundation of the
[3:57] in st. John when he said in the
[3:59] beginning was the word when the first
[4:02] earned the word was god and the word was
[4:07] made flesh and dwelt among us god
[4:12] unfolding himself down to a human being
[4:16] now what I did it Jenna back to Aaron
[4:20] one little halo comes out we can't see
[4:22] nothing yet but this on as a just
[4:25] supernatural we see a halo saying I
[4:27] that's the Son of God the logos now I
[4:30] can see play around a child before the
[4:34] father's all our eternity and I then in
[4:39] his imaginary makeup he begin to think
[4:42] of what things would be like in your
[4:44] face left better be life

[7:05] old piece of tender to all tire down
[7:07] beneath it now says better turning
[7:09] burning volcano completely erupting
[7:12] sucker boy Bobby knees in the beginning
[7:17] God created the heaven and the
[7:20] [Music]
[7:27] and the Lord God formed man of the dust
[7:30] of the ground and breathed into his
[7:32] nostrils the breath of life and man
[7:34] became a living soul and the Lord God
[7:39] planted a garden eastward in Eden and
[7:41] there he put the man whom he had formed
[7:46] over the whole situation
[7:49] he put his son and his son's wife over
[7:53] all of it right what God did he put him
[7:57] in full control they could speak to the
[8:00] winds and it was cease to blow they
[8:02] would speak to the tree and it would
[8:04] move from here to there the lion and the
[8:06] wolf fed together and the lamb laid down
[8:10] with them there was no evil it was
[8:13] perfect peace perfect harmony everything
[8:15] in perfection and when God had it under
[8:19] his control and it noticed he had his
[8:22] yet his world yet all in operation
[8:25] he had everything coming everything
[8:27] eaten vegetations
[8:29] nothing to die nothing to be ruined
[8:31] nothing to be spoiled nothing it was
[8:33] just perfect and over it all he placed
[8:36] his beloved children his son and his
[8:39] daughter a husband and wife to control
[8:42] it
[8:49] [Music]
[8:57] [Music]
[8:59] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[9:02] beast of the field which the Lord God
[9:03] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[9:06] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[9:09] tree of the garden and a woman said unto
[9:12] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[9:14] the trees of the garden but of the fruit
[9:15] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[9:17] garden God had said you shall not eat of
[9:19] it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[9:22] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[9:25] shall not surely die
[9:27] [Music]
[9:32] and when he went to take a little rest
[9:35] his enemy stepped in with the seat and
[9:38] took it over by misinterpreting his
[9:42] program to his children
[9:45] when he put trust in his own child think
[9:49] he put trust in his son that he would
[9:52] not do anything wrong and would keep
[9:55] every word that he said but the enemy
[9:58] spit then
[10:02] the slip in the enemy of God slip in and
[10:07] misinterpreted the word to Eve now Eva
[10:13] this fall
[10:14] it has took over and processed the
[10:17] Garden of Eden himself
[10:24] something's lost
[10:27] burner is groaning it's trying to get
[10:32] back to be back to its original
[10:34] condition would you imagine someone
[10:37] falling from the earth down into a deep
[10:42] pit somewhere and the struggling
[10:46] climbing tolling they must are some
[10:51] means get out of this pit they're not in
[10:55] the original state and frantically
[10:59] there's screaming they've torn the walls
[11:03] making a noise or there's some way there
[11:06] they're going the closet they want to
[11:10] get back to their original estate that's
[11:13] what a person struck with disease aches
[11:17] and pains one time they wasn't that way
[11:21] but they're groaning why they're not
[11:25] right there's something wrong and
[11:29] they're crawling and trying to get back
[11:32] to where there was where they had help
[11:35] and when nature and people's as the
[11:39] Bible said are groaning this shows our
[11:44] something that they're not either ought
[11:47] to be conditioning they are falling from
[11:50] somewhere now we don't need anybody to
[11:53] interpret that policy but of course we
[11:57] know it was eternal life their fallen
[12:03] from and they lost their claims on
[12:06] eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve
[12:09] who fell from eternal life to death in
[12:14] the Garden of Eden and of all nature
[12:18] under them today
[12:19] [Music]
[12:21] a tree never died before then an animal
[12:24] would die before edit there's only one
[12:28] thing that cannot die and that's God
[12:31] because he's eternal and that's the only
[12:34] way we can ever keep firm blind we have
[12:36] to have eternal life in us that these
[12:38] sons and daughters of God but when we
[12:41] died as I said in the message this
[12:43] morning to sin we sold all her birth
[12:47] rights and cross this chasm now we're
[12:51] beyond the reach of God on this other
[12:54] side of the cabin the day you eat
[12:59] thereof that day you die and when he
[13:03] lost his life he also lost his
[13:06] inheritance in life because he had
[13:09] completely supreme control of the earth
[13:13] he was a God of the area God's a God of
[13:17] the universe they were but his son had
[13:20] this earth under his own control he
[13:23] could speak he could name he could say
[13:25] good stop nature he could do anything
[13:26] you want to do see but when he did that
[13:29] he lost his inheritance now Adam could
[13:33] say yeah let this mountain here being
[13:35] moved over there they were do it
[13:36] Adam Cassetti let this tree here be
[13:39] plucked up and plant over here it would
[13:40] do it for he had complete supreme
[13:44] control as a minor God under God our
[13:50] Father because he was a son of God
[13:57] Adam lost years inheritance the earth
[14:02] now it passed from his hand do the lot
[14:08] he sold out to Satan
[14:10] he sold his faith in God to Satan's
[14:15] reasonings there for his eternal life is
[14:20] right to the Tree of Life is right to
[14:24] the earth wrong to him and he borrowed
[14:28] it ever dip to the hands of Satan he
[14:31] passed it from his hand to Satan
[14:35] therefore now it has been the return
[14:40] that has been polluted
[14:44] and the seed of Adam has destroyed the
[14:48] inheritance that Adam should have had
[14:52] that's your
[14:59] now they're polluting it your God will
[15:02] destroy them but the meek will inherit
[15:05] the earth and has been purified
[15:07] now Oman now the confident title deed is
[15:16] now in the hands of the rich owner oh my
[15:20] god the title deed to the earth and if
[15:27] you eternal life when Adam Barford it
[15:31] then Satan's doing hands cannot take it
[15:36] so it went back to its original owner
[15:40] God himself
[15:42] we're gonna find it just a myth there he
[15:43] steps on the throne with it in his hand
[15:46] probably
[15:53] the coyote
[15:55] [Music]
[15:58] coyote eternal life with as positive for
[16:02] wisdom instead of faith
[16:05] this went back to the hands of the owner
[16:07] oh my god what a great scene all right
[16:14] waiting what's it doing in the hands of
[16:17] God waiting for redemption claims he
[16:23] made a way of redemption
[16:25] he made a way back and someday the
[16:29] Redeemer is to take it back
[16:33] Adam could not meet the requirements of
[16:36] redemption actually found he losted he
[16:38] had sanding it separated himself from
[16:40] God is on this side of Kasim
[16:42] so he could not redeem he just couldn't
[16:45] do it
[16:45] cuz he what you needed Redemption itself
[16:48] so he could not do it but the world
[16:52] required a kinsman redeemer the law of
[16:56] God required a kinsman redeemer the oil
[16:59] market down kinsman redeemer fine at
[17:02] Leviticus 25 God's law received a
[17:10] substitute
[17:11] now what if God had not offered to take
[17:14] a substitute but love constrained him to
[17:17] know it that man was an alphabet and
[17:21] there's no way for me to get back he was
[17:25] bald but the grace of God this is when
[17:32] redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ
[17:38] love required
[17:41] grace match requirements now notes
[17:52] require a kinsman redeemer and the
[17:56] Redeemer kinsman redeemer must be born
[18:00] all the human race where that leaves us
[18:05] only in will let me sound the trumpet
[18:08] Ian the virgin birth produced the
[18:12] product
[18:15] the bacon breath produced our Kuzmin
[18:19] not other but the all-mighty God because
[18:22] he manual
[18:25] [Music]
[18:31] you see how God makes a requirement and
[18:35] there's nothing we can do but then no
[18:37] steps in and all shadows that well it
[18:39] produces a part but when the fullness of
[18:45] the time was come God sent forth his son
[18:47] made of a woman made under the law to
[18:50] redeem them that were under the law that
[18:52] we might receive the adoption of sons
[18:58] he was in the world and the world was
[19:00] made by him and the world knew him not
[19:03] he came unto his own and his own
[19:06] received him
[19:07] but as many as received him to them gave
[19:09] he power to become the sons of God even
[19:12] to them that believe on his name which
[19:14] were born not of blood nor of the will
[19:16] of the flesh nor of the will of man but
[19:18] of God and the Word was made flesh and
[19:23] dwelt among us
[19:25] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[19:27] the only begotten of the Father full of
[19:29] grace and truth
[19:30] [Music]
[20:01] when God makes a covenant with man man
[20:03] will break it every time he always did
[20:06] but God there made a coming in yourself
[20:07] ever said if you will a summer I will
[20:10] flip enmity promise new Savior between
[20:14] her Stephen is Satan's seed in ours look
[20:17] four thousand years is past and all the
[20:19] time a shadow of the blood through the
[20:21] offering of sheeps and goats and so
[20:23] forth which could not take away sin but
[20:25] just covered it up now we have bound
[20:27] 4000 years later let's turn our camera
