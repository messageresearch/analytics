[42:51] crushed by Satan's
[42:54] manifested skin
[42:57] and you feel the urge within you to

[43:11] disappear praise the
[43:16] Lord work through those who praise him
[43:19] praise the
[43:22] Lord for a God in have his praise praise
[43:27] the
[43:30] Lord for the chains that seem to bind
[43:33] you serve only to remind you that they
[43:38] drop powerless behind you when you
[43:46] PR
[43:49] him now Satan he's a
