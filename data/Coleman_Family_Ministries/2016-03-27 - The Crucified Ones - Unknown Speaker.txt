========================================
to be alive in Christ Jesus God to have the faith to be at the cross there to hide oursel in the Cliff of the rock that Jesus might be made manifest to a Dying World God help us to hide ourselves in the Cliff of the rock Lord where all our worldly desires our thinking our will our hearts our bodies are all dead in Jesus Christ dipped in the anointed immersed by the spirit of God into Christ Hallelujah there to move no more only as the spirit of the Lord quickens this dead flesh and makes it alive unto God God give us that kind of Faith to add to this Faith virtue and patience and Temperance and knowledge and and godliness and then the love of God come down and United all together Bless the people are that have come here this morning Father and and and every stone in here Lord thou has gathered it here to polish it up Lord to shine as a jewel in the end time that the world might see the image of Jesus Christ come down this morning Father in love and polish up thy jewels to be in thy Crown this morning take these bodies here Lord and anoint our ears to hear anoint your word to go in Lord and may the blood of Jesus Christ that's in the word of God the washing of the Water by the word of God wash us this morning Lord by thy Loving Hands and the blood of Jesus Christ heal our sicknesses dear God and all the prayer requests and and the things in our hearts God the unspoken on Lord I'm quite sure this morning every person in here Lord wants to be closer to thee Lord God bring this to pass this morning Lord that we might know him the author and the finish of our faith the Lord Jesus come and make yourself alive in us this morning God bring the word into our hearts form Jesus Christ in our midst this morning Lord that the world might see and know that Christ is resurrected and living among his people we pray and ask this in jesus' name and for his glory amen you might be seated we're certainly happy to be here this morning and it's getting increasingly increasingly uh trial to get here praise the Lord this been one sickness after another home with the the children since 2 or 3 months now one gets sick the other one gets sick the other one gets sick the baby's been up for about 8 months every night just about takes everything out of you so but we are praising God and thanking him and moving on for we know that these things must be these little light afflictions they must be and this is only God having us so to speak in high school getting us ready for college praise the lord we want to touch on on that this morning in the message and so it's good to be here um back here in the Pulpit to bring the word of God for this is indeed a great privilege and also an honor to be able to be a servant of Jesus Christ and I was really blessed just a a message coming through here Serv we would see Jesus old tape how brother Brandon was explaining that when the Greeks came to I believe it was Phillip and Andrew I think it was and said that we would see Jesus uh brother BR was saying that they were true disciples and they took them to the presence of God which was Jesus Christ and then Jesus Christ when they got there he never pointed them to himself he never pointed them to who he was nothing like he he pointed them to a place Calvary except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it shall because of B alone if Christ pointed the people to Calvary what about us see and so therefore he he made a statement that a true servant always points the people to Christ to the Cross to Calvary so my prayer is God help me be a true disciple to point you to the Cross Calvary Jesus Christ in this year coming that uh the Resurrection Life of Christ might be made manifest in us so we're so happy this morning to be here and we have a tape for tonight the predestinated perfect will of God so one wonderful message I didn't hear it yet but I just heard excerpts of it just to check out the tape make sure it was all right and he speaks about um the resurrection and things like that and being over in heaven and those kind of things just really pick you up you know that's the word of God that's what because we live for and that's why we're here and we wanted to uh play Blasphemous names Wednesday if we can get the tape I think the one we had is something wrong with it or something but I wonder if brother Curt have the tape the Blasphemous names you have it good okay if you bring it in CU we like to play that Wednesday and also give out the books so there that'll be Wednesday night Blasphemous names and the Lord willing next Sunday night if we're still here statue of a perfect man I believe that uh that'll bring us to a place where we can understand the will of God for the hour in which we're just about to approach so with that thought in mind let us open the word of God let us turn to Colossians the thirr chapter verses 1- 16 and in Romans 8 verse 10 through1 13 so I want to relax this morning take my time we're always rushing and so it's being taped so thought maybe I just take my time praise the Lord if you're with me Colossians the 3r chapter um verses 1- 16 and Romans the 8th chapter 10th verse through the 13th reading from Colossians 3 if ye then in Rison with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanliness inordinate affection consiousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of Disobedience into which you also walk sometime when you lived in them but now you also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth L out one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision bar a barbarian cynthian Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore this is a Greek word it means to be ued like over there in St Luke 24:49 they had to put on something amen be endued with power from because from on high put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on something else now put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the God of Peace rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be be you thankful in other words if it be a question in your mind let let the the Empire the Umpire Christ rule in your in your hearts cuz he'll de sign the word amen if any question come up see let him rule amen and let the word of Christ dwell live see in you richly in all wisdom teaching admiring one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and Romans 8 Romans 8 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify which means to to crucify the Deeds of the body you shall live and God a blessing the reading of his word like to give a little Title Here the the crucified ones um today um all of us know by the great hour in which we're living in that uh there's all kind of things going on which we know and just as as a review of what has taken place quickly the past year of 1968 which many in America and around the world called the most phenomenal year that they have ever witnessed in this country here or anywhere else because for that matter and we thank God to know that we knew that this had to be and and and we sat right here went through the whole year and saw all of these changes in Social conditions science religion and politics everything every seed had to be planted last year o of any event that's going to take place because in the future the seed had to be last year had to be there and then God would even in the natural natur come out and show you through science because Apollo 7 and8 of what he's done and even give his servant brother Billy Paul a dream to show you what he's done in the church see all these are spiritual things and you have to have a spiritual eye to Paul says to have your eyes of your understanding then your understanding has eyes amen and God has anointed those eyes with is have that it might see see means to understand amen and and then when you understand and peace settles down in your heart then when you know that that that somehow you know it can't explain it but your life is dead in Jesus Christ just it's in Christ that's all see it's there and the blood of Jesus Christ has washed away your sins and there is a sin atonement here now his blood for the sins of future sins which he knew that we had to go through being weak in the flesh see but there's an atonement here care for it so we thank God for that in 1961 President John Kennedy he uh uh set the national goal that uh man because America would reach the Moon by 1969 and that was America's national goal and we see now that she thinks that she's just about to reach her goal this year she wants to do it I believe it is that she wants to do it in July on the Apollo number 11 and she used to have two other Apollo trips uh number nine and number 10 number nine I believe is a go in February 28th and so we know that the prophet of God has taught us that God types out in the natural what he's doing in the spiritual so we watch for those things and we look for them and in the holy spirit with his grace he opens it up to us and then we see what's going on see and then we just get so full and and the other person he don't understand what you're talking about but you know and you can't explain it you see and so therefore um just as a backdrop we thought that we would just go back over and because review a little bit and um last year as to what happened in Apollo 7 we know it was stream in 7 SE message third poll full vision with that plastic bubble helmet and that $100,000 doll suit on went around the earth 11 times we know to get the 11 workers all these spiritual things you see and the mechanics of it was perfect the uh the newspaper said so perfect and then we know that Apollo 7 is actually because Apollo 8 they just changed the number that's all but the same ship see same mechanics and everything else but because Apollo had to do something else then this had to go around the Moon see 10 times and so forth and and it had to go around and to prove that it was ready to go to the moon but one thing it had to do before it could go to the Moon it had to find the secret On the Dark Side of the Moon see what was silence back there if it don't get that secret in the silence back because in the seal back behind that Moon back there it'll never go to the Moon amen and we know that uh the the seven seal in Revelation 8 says silence amen and we know that we don't ever find out the mystery of those seven Thunders we'll never go there either amen so therefore when this Apollo 8 because you catching ap8 was typing out that there will be one more rhyme because man did it in the natural and the prophet spoke it I'll ride the trail one more time and he said make no mistake about it brother cins God will ride that trail one more time on Satan's Eden Shield turn at the West and she'll ride back amen one more time amen amen so we see with our eyes of our understanding and then this fills our heart and we're waiting we're waiting but we know what we're waiting for you don't know what you're waiting for then is just just waiting in vain but we have a hope and we stagger not through unbelief but we every day a strong giving praise to God for we know he'll ride back and then the whole world Houston they all was waiting when they went up behind the moon they waited for about 45 minutes in silence nothing was heard it was a hush over the whole world on TV tellar they all was waiting would they come back would they go into orbit and man and when they went around the side of the moon they had to begin to read from Genesis let them know God making them do it amen amen and reading the first 10 verses because from Genesis in the beginning see in the beginning and the prophet had a message in the beginning Genesis clean through the Book of Revelation amen and here they in the beginning and now here they come out in the end see and they come flying around the moon and here they come and they went into orbit and the world shouted for Joy well what'll happen when that white horse rider come riding back amen when he anoints that church amen when he comes riding back with the power of the Resurrection upon his brde he's coming s so I can hear the ho Beast coming amen amen praise the lord it's it's with a spiritual ear though see not a natural horse now like they say over there see a spiritual horse am amen so we see then that the whole world was waiting in hush silence waiting to see if they would go into orbit and man did so what is God doing typing out in the natur that the spiritual ones will go in orbit also right and we have to get in Orbit there's no there's we can't do nothing in ourselves the father he doeth The Works the dove must come and put you in orbit the Flying Eagle amen must anoint these because mechanics here so to me this was a sign from God that the seed was sown in the year 68 for politics religion social conditions and science everything and to me that is God the way he does things is so humble and so like in secret in in Simplicity rather see here he comes in uh January the 1st 1968 and gives brother Billy Paul a dream and tells him about 19 tapes and all these things 19 separates us and brother Billy Paul he went ahead and told a dream and many of them because they told me to my face spiritualism plain and simple right out of their mouth spiritualism never said a word just went on so what was God doing the people in the message had gotten off the beaten path they went into horses and and Natural Things see me now so they they said well I say it's this I say it's abstinence I say you got to go out to Arizona I say you have to go over there so then God said now I'm going to bring her back on on the course so therefore there's 10 more tapes 10 and therefore the son of God the Holy Spirit Will anoint the church 10 times last year with these 10 tapes you understand me to so therefore Billy Paul had to bring back the message that God gave his father in 62 the greatest battley ever for he says store up this food here and the the cutting off point was in 63 Look Away to Jesus where he said he must go on the field and he cannot make the tapes here no more but he has to make them as he goes so therefore brother Billy Paul knew the starting and also the cutting off point see so then the Holy Spirit came back and and he said well how will I know what to play he said it'll be like the statue of a perfect man in other words it won't be like going to Arizona it won't be like horses and things it be like a man adding to his faith virtue Temperance knowledge patience godliness and then brotherly kindness the honey that grips in the rockl your confession your confession means nothing if there's no honey holding there if you don't have love for your brother forgiveness for your brother there's no confession at all because Honey in the Rock is the confession and if when you see those mean and evil against you there's no confession at all it's a tinkling symbol and a hollow sound amen for our eyes is Anointed to understand who is Christ Christ is the word Christ is love Christ is gentle longsuffering and patience and godliness Hallelujah we know who Christ is amen so we know where we standing at praise our God but nevertheless this had to be and so we see then that Billy Paul said well how will I know well the message will be not what you hear today with these false Christ brought out since 65 but go back to the greatest Valley of a fort statue of of a perfect man Christ is the mystery of God revealed in April in the July meeting a way of a true Prophet restoration of the Bride tree is all the message because he preached you see in August and September wisdom versus Faith absolute spoken word and then here in November indictment three kind of Believers there's your 10 tapes right there every one of them is right on the word every one of them preaches a death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ every one of them is preaching a cross you got to die am there's no easy way to go around here and go over there and go over there no sir on a saying on an idea for a true disciple he points you to the word and that word must be preached for you bring the people into the the presence of Jesus and therefore he said not like a disciples today who take you to a church to a Creed to a idea to what so and so said to what we think see to me now no more ministers just here just read the seven Church age book or whatever some kind of because crazy idea but he'll take you to the word of God all the word from Genesis clean through the Book of Revelation amen so we see then that these 10 tapes seeds of God was swn in ' 68 and the Son of God himself had to go around his bride as she come to hear the word he had to plac the seed in there sold that seed there last year to the bride and we played the same tapes here because so we tried to now uh see because the people had they had because forgotten the message the enemy coming so powerful in ' 6566 they didn't know what the message was just believeing you all right no sir the disciples because they believed and they were associated with him but but they had to die they had to be baptized into him by death you see so therefore it takes more than that so now because Apollo 8 it went around the Moon 10 times on December 24th even over in Hagi 2118 it says that is the seed yet in the barn other words is the wheat there in the Garner no sir see it says that the foundation because hagy was laid in December 24th and we know that that God counts time because from April so December is the 9th month that right amen and our Prophet died December 24th 1965 the foundation was laid and then Christ says from this day will I bless you from this day forward and there was the seed now you just take the seed the corn of Wheat and plant it into the word and let it come up and resurrect because Christ in you so we see then that Apollo 8 had to go around the Moon 10 times to lay the foundation for the landing on the moon this year see it now friends so now uh we see in also I picked up a very interesting article here which was in the New York Times Monday it's quite interesting it says here because I'll read it to you they there's been a um a science uh magazine Atomic scientists for the past 20 cover read the article here for nearly 25 years the bulletin of the atomic scientist has carried on his cover a clock showing man's closeness to total Destruction now watch this for some unknown reason see last year the hand was moved forward to 8 minutes right here in the paper see here the Doomsday Clock still reads 11:52 8 minutes see now for 25 years nobody moved that hand on that bulletin but somebody made the publisher or even the editor move the hand up 8 minutes to midnight and it says 8 Minutes to Midnight 8 minutes to an hour the politicians and social scientists of Russia China and America probably would agree on one thing unless remarkably positive steps are taken in the next five years see the chances of the world celebrating the dawn of New Years in the year 2000 are far dimmer than any moment in recorded history possibly the chances of survival are dimmer than in that cataclysmic moment when the Great age of of glaciers Dawn and it must have seemed to many in that epic that the world would die in a girdle of ice thousands of feet thick so now here's God Making Science move the hand forward to 8 minutes to 12 there's your number eight again number eight testifying which is that's the year that the seed is to be swn according to because Leviticus 25 I think it's 22 so number eight has been an astounding year and then I wonder why they have this part which they didn't test out on on the Apollo 8 it's called in It's called The Landing module and so I said well they were supposed to tested out here in December but it wasn't ready yet so I wonder why what does that mean see all because called it mean something and then it just comes to me this way as it comes to me they are to test this flight is to go up February 29th um February 28th rather this year for 10 days and supposed to go around the earth cuz not the moon see has because it has to be tested on the earth first before it goes up there see typen out so to me um there is the message of the time see and there's a message of the hour now hidden the message of time is the message of the hour to the bride see now the message of the time the Seven Seals come and strip down the Catholic church and the nomination and so forth tell you all about the hippies and the women and that's the message of the time see amen now and any man he can see that and also because preach off of that but hid in there is something else see hid in there is where there's a secret Revelation where the bride is to add during this time when the whole world sees all of these judgments falling the bride is adding see so therefore to me that part which goes on the moon is this Landing module see to me that part is Faith adding to it virtue and so forth which has to be tested see every corn of wheat if it is a real corn of wheat it must be put to the test to see if it is a corner weat now we may say we have faith and patience and Temperance amen and virtue and so forth we may say that but the hour must come when that must be put to the test before it goes into heaven my God are you follow me friends so it is the other part of because a n where it must be tested and we must be tested also we're only been here in a place of trying that's all we've been in high school see but we have to go to college amen see he's been child that's why we've been playing all these tapes to you child training you follow me now well other words when you go to the cross and you come up then you get milk that's the little grade school there is that right get the milk see and then you go to high school then you go into child training see then when you finish High School which we're just about ready to finish then you go into college a school of suffering see and in the whole thing now don't lose me now I mean Stay With Me Now Praise the Lord see this is is the old corn see and and so we want to know uh where we standing at and the real Believers are they know that God has predestinated for ordain that they should come to that place for God's Prophet told us that if the bride could ever find her place is that right every man and woman can find their place where on the cross find their place there then the Holy Spirit after he has come down through justification and so forth he can find his fullness there amen at the cross and in Resurrection in the power of Jesus Christ see now friends but before that comes you must come to that place so to me the message of the hour is we is the the seed is ripening now and looks like nothing but there's something going on yeah amen and during this time is when the enemy comes and tells you there's no use there's no hope for you and and and yet the word speaks out if he could only find a people who will just believe the word just the way it's spoken Hallelujah not understanding it all see he said that was the faith that the early church had to now now let's remember what the early church was now they receive a a a human man is that right now think of it now they received a man just like you and I a man walked up Jesus Christ and said he was the Christ and they had to believe that now they were they had prophets and they had everything they had to believe that he was the Christ because he interpreted the word amen amen the signs followed him he was the word so they had to believe in him now without uh sitting down with him and say now what does this mean and what does that mean over there and get on a telephone see now see just believe it just the way it was because God has a plan and he does not change he said here a scripture here as it comes to me here I'll just go as a holy spirit leads me amen amen will this take our time amen all right St John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how in the world could brother Bram tell us about plagues and viles and things you follow me now when we didn't even know what he was talking about come out of the world first amen you see about now women because Let Your Hair gr out let you because dresses go down take off the paint and also makeup and so forth why some couldn't even do that yet well how in the world can he tell them about things of Heaven I mean powerful things that was send the people out of their minds here you f how can he how can you do it it wasn't an hour yet he even said so it's not the he now you know I know those things on Christ is M uh because Christ revealing his own word he said I know all those things there God will do nothing except he revealed a secret to his Prophet amen that right he said but it's not the hour yet but now watch see I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now you can't handle it now we could just about if somebody here got the because got mad at us or wouldn't shake our hand we could justif by handle that come on well he didn't speak to me she didn't could shake my hand you see now friends well the H world can you handle the full grown Corner wheat on the cross where the the real sufferings are couldn't handle that because back in' 65 couldn't do it well God knows that see he knows all about it see how be it when he the spirit of Truth is coming which we're waiting for now see he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself now he's not going to come with no Revelation about somebody uh you know what I'm talking about he ain't going to come with no kind of Revelation to tell you to go looking for that at all and you all know what I'm talking about go over here run up there and so forth he's he will take of mine what is mine the son of man came then and preached the word they received it father thy alone has the words of of eternal life we don't understand the whole thing but we believe it but on the day of Pentecost the spirit of Truth came down said this is that Peter and he just used Peter's vocal cords and set up on Peter and spoke out of his mouth and went to his own scriptures he knows the ones for the hour amen the mind of Christ moved into Peter Peter was just standing there his flesh was alive to God God quickened his mechanics to every word of God and then quick to every word then he can go through him to the word of God all in the Bible and pull it out amen and speak it through his lips amen that's what he did here see and he will take off mine and show it to you bring it to your remembrance and one other thing and show you things to come prophesy forell is that right direct prophecy forell it show you things to come see that's what the spirit of truth will do so when now we waiting for the spirit of Truth Now he will come and take brother bram's message and bring it to your remembrance follow me now and show you things in the Book of Revelation to come are you follow me now they're all going around well I think it means this and because I think it means that but he will bring it what he means to your memory and you'll stand up there under the direct inspiration of God and speak it out and every man will hear it then every man will understand it then it'll be the word made flesh are you foll me praise all God I'm waiting for that friends yes sir now one's got a Doctrine one's got an idea and one says this one says that go over here go over there see but the hour was coming for the spirit of Truth he comes right on the word amen see right on the word praise the Lord and yet before he comes you got to have a little test and the Holy Spirit has L us this way see all through these things here a little test and and remember when Satan when Christ went on his little test there upon the mountain there Satan came to him well if Satan came to him with 99 and 910 of the word in the message it is written that's the way he come won't his Antichrist ministers come also the same way it is written bride brother BR said thus and so didn't they do it follow me now they had to do it but the bride said it is also written amen it is also written man shall not live by bread but by every word well I believe well I believe the word amen amen see and when if is a true disciple he won't point you to himself he won't bring out a dogmatic teaching about a fivefold ministry that's a dogmatic teaching see me now he won't just keep CU you can tell about the third message it goes right back to self either it'll go to Christ or it'll go to that man preaching and there you got it and you just watch and wait so therefore what God does to you he brings in a real test to you love and everything and and see if you catch it cuz that's just the way it'll have to be on your own and you got to get it now you because you going into college see somebody now I hope you got that see and then some just say well isn't that wonderful G away didn't even know it see now see it if the man doesn't point you to Christ he's not a true disciple he's pointing you to himself he's telling you that the prophet did nothing and you got to receive me to fivefold mer I have to come and perfect you when you're already perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ amen you only have to come to an actual experience the place that God ordained for you to be there in the school of sufferings and then it'll be perfected amen but you already perfected in his mind before the foundation of the world knowing that you will receive the word at that place that he is leading you now the dove leading you right to it praise our God you see it friends amen so we see then now the bride is put to the test on the word by the devil on God of this evil Age The Prophet told us so he says what is going on now he said the bride is to be tested on the word and that's just what we've been tested on the word he said it'll be so close it would deceive the very elected if possible that right and brother we have seen it and won't be at don't go after man's person no matter who the man is and many went after people's persons because they were in a certain position see now they went but he said go after the word and they went away after said well he must know it or this one got to know they was there with him you see so therefore men will come with great sring natural words to deceive you even Peter tried to because do it to Christ Christ had to go go to the Cross Peter tried to get them not to go there and they'll come and try to make you bypass the cross go to Arizona or go over here and just wait follow me now for the resurrection you got to die first amen you got to die before you go up in the resurrection you must die kill yourself spiritually mortify these body crucify this flesh here it's got to be done but they'll come easy like in the message all we all believe the message and the prophet said there'll be one here and two over there and one over there see it me now but you believe that you are that one by faith you believe it hold on to it amen see so therefore with the understanding we now have we understand that what God is doing and so now we want to know just what is God's will because for us we know we realize that we must die to bring forth his life see we must be because crucified with him in his eternal life and in his life and our life meets there and he kills this life paralyzes it in Christ do you actually realize friends that we are dead in Christ we have been dipped immersed into the anointing and that is what buries you in there you are buried by not the baptism of water now that only answers to a good conscience because toward God you're only saying what happened on the inside but inside of you you were buried in Christ you follow me now you were buried by a baptism he must take you into his death by a baptism and then you and you're hid in there you're never to come out no more you're hid in there but when he appears your life appears also and God has ordained for us to be here for this hour when he's getting ready now to appear for the last minist on the earth before he appears is a prophet God in flesh with a sign of discernment amen and the message to restore us back after that Isaac appeared that right so after this here we're looking for Jesus Christ to appear in the bride to appear to inform himself in her midst mold himself the perfect one amen and bring us to that praise God so you see now well let me read the scripture here if you want to write it down Romans 6:4 just to go back over here therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life and uh witness uh Colossians 2:12 buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead excuse me so when we go into him spiritually see we bured in there by faith see by faith now the same operation the same power God that raised Christ from The Dead We Believe will raise us from the dead in the newness of life then if we are a new creation a a new creature the old man was baptized and buried amen in Christ the old man's gone I mean he was immersed dipped in the anointing he's gone the whole man was amen but now his ways God left his ways here to stick you in other words God could have taken everything away when you went in see me now there would have been no test so he bur You by faith in there and you know that before the foundation of the world you are there you're gone see you are completely finished but he left your nature there to sick you to press you to his cross follow me now when you would you would not see talk about now so you got to stay at the cross until you are positionally placed by him see so there therefore this old nature sticks you when you want to do here because you can't do it see but there's coming a time when you go through those stages like all of us because going through the same stages you want to do thus and so but then he brings you out of milk and brings you into child training then you're on your way and thanks be to God that we're not in milk there's many millions still in milk but he called us out of milk amen am into child training in 63 praise our God that's that's what he did he called us out of the the tap this see and brought us into child into a place where the Holy Spirit the best tutor could come in the word even s the shepher dream this Workman here with this clear blue water that was the Holy Spirit in the whole church ages see and the last days it was the Holy Spirit himself pouring in this word this message into the bride and and Bubble Up all the dirt and filth and so forth see that's the Holy Spirit and then as he pours it into it he was waiting for the Capstone to come down with the shout follow me now and he comes down and sets himself at the head of the church first as the word mechanic then he comes right back as a spirit of Truth rise and Trail one more time and comes in in the dynamic and make those words worth amen praise our God see so now then when we come because from The Cross by faith we are to add to our faith virtue See Me Now patience and oh what because by faith now see now in order to do it we must stay at the cross and be crucified with him now I realize that this is not a popular Doctrine but God said speak it anyway so therefore I want to say what he tell me to say I realize that see but this message must get through and God will get it through the holy spirit will see man now so this is the word see so Paul says I have been uh let me read that littleit cuz galatian I'm just setting the background for what I'm getting ready to say here praise the Lord Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live now he talking about Christ here see he's Christ see I live yet not I because the old Paul Saul he's he he finished with he's been immersed into Christ see so therefore the eye who is living is Christ in him see but not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh in the body he lived the life in his body that was alive unto God and all of us want to get to that place and God's going to take you to that place that your body might live the same kind of life because brother brandham lived in the flesh that's the life we all want amen that's the one we're looking for Hallelujah that's when we closed from on high and these mechanics is Quicken the fles is dead in God's sight listen in God's sight your body is dead you follow me now and the only thing worth anything that will go up to the throne is when the spirit does something through you the rest of it is dead work you see mean now so and he's only looking at an adding come on he's only adding what Christ is doing through you see that's all the rest of it is wood stubing ha oh praise God so that's all it is and as you stay at the cross then the Holy Spirit comes in and wash through there and raises up brotherly kindness or whatever it is that's Christ the rest of it that's God doesn't even see that it's washed by the blood follow me now but as you stay there then it comes a time when you are to get up from there amen and the father takes you you don't run out there now the father must take his son that's been child trained out to a certain place but many ran out there before the Father Here I Am the five for man the father never took them out there now and out they went they got into all kind of trouble and God was even with them and they wanded up and wander watch praise God Wanderer yes sir Cain wandered away from the Lord the name nod means to wonder see so therefore God separated Cain from s and he wandered away spiritually separation you've seen people come against everything here and all around then what happen they run into a 10 million vote of power and Strikes their mind and away they go wandering up and down spiritually don't even know where they going at they just wandering around they're in the land of N and you're still moving on me now don't say a word just you this child training don't you realize that David had to face the bear we did that he had to face the line because we did that then he had to go out and fight the good fight of Faith we've been doing that then God put an evil spirit on Saul his brother and we've been going through that that's the one almost killing you in here Paul got an evil spirit upon him and he comes at you with all kind of stuff I'm speaking about the spirit amen you get me now just saying your old buold kind of thing to your faith talk against you talk against the pastor deacons the elders talk against one another that's the devil on them people there doing that then he slips in and and comes in Spirit of lust upon the women and raise up their skirts and things and so forth and put on paint and powder that's the devil that's doing that there and I speak it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen what you look you see a spirit right before you and then they gone and they going and they going and you got to go through all of those things there but thanks be to God if they can ever come to repentance if they will repent and go to the Cross God to raise them up God to heal your body heal your mind heal your sickness and so forth but you must repent or perish is the word of God see that me now but that's not popular but that's got to be preach those are thunder bolts of lightning that must go out to the people and and and blast the devil off of them here we were Sanctified in 63 Anointed with the word then come down and end and see those walking around in the flesh in the world well then preach the word preach it to them in season out of season and if per Adventure the turn back I don't know but we just got we're responsible to preach that word too see where am I at yes sir in the land of n amen God separated them they went off nding up and down spiritually sleeping they go they gone to sleep see but the bride shees wi awake Heaven Thunders woke her up she said I don't know what it mean but it means something yes sir Lord What Can I Do Lord see me now let me stay at the cross Rock of Asia C for me it's stay right there see me now and the others is just going around the others are looking for a place where is an easy Doctrine where they can because because cut the hair and put on paint roots and wear all kind of psychedelic colors and things and look nice for the world they want that kind of place but the place I'll take it to is the cross that's the place I'll take it to the cross of Jesus Christ and die to the world and die to yourself and die to the Fashions of this world here take it to the cross and here God give us a message a pearl a great Pearl because tell all the other pearls and this Pearl and others take that Pearl and just walk on top of it the pearl of great Tri do you realize he gave us a promise because for a family and you sisters and so forth and and also men if if you have an unsaved husband let me tell you this morning God put you in that place how dare you try to get out of that place I don't care who tells you to do what and so that person is wrong for God has put you in that place am then stay in that place place until he raised you up from that cross do you realize that cuz your husband has a chance for salvation as long as you say Sanctified Sanctified what from the world from the world from the world St Sanctified from the world your husband a life that will go into hell has a chance by you staying Sanctified and looking unto Jesus the auor and the finish of the faith and then going to time for Satan's little stop of the world a little short death of little fashion of the world and a s of the world tell out your Birthright and your husbands also stay at the cross in the name of the Lord stay at the cross and die there to yourself and let God resurrect you that's right that's the word of God Amen Brothers offer for your wise stay there men looking like the fashion of the world going around let because the hair get long afro and things like this here because you watch them up down in the church there cut off the world in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and stay right there at cross there so what do you have the Devil comes in and because gets them off and the husband there he has a chance by her faith and do you believe God say if thou can't believe that's the word amen thine and thy whole household shall be saved I challenge you to believe that I challenge everyone in here to believe the gospel this morning and and take hold of Christ and believe for your whole family why don't you know what he's getting ready to do you said well I don't see anything that's your test you got to die you got to die well I don't see what he's still running around with a woman or he still going over here he's a sinner he's a sinner he's a sinner he's a sinner he's in this age and day it's hard enough for the sons of God to keep their mind stay on the law what those men are sinners out there the devil's got them in a [ __ ] where's the love in your heart for that but our legalist will come along and tell you well you shouldn't take that that's a legalistic spirit that Spirit needs to die also and have love in for the mankind out there Christ so loved the world God they only gave us because only begotten son and he sent his publicans and all he had love in him and here you see people with husband and wives can't even have a little love for their own husband for the one what kind of one You Follow Me Now Praise the Lord so we have then when you look in the word by the eyes of your understanding and then you see that God can do in one five minutes he can baptize your husband save him fill him with the power of God and put them on and cast out those Devils don't you realize that these people your families and they are sitting there waiting for that resurrected power of God to come forth and bust the power of Satan don't you understand is here but while it's sitting there waiting you only going to a place you're being child trained that when you get to the place the power of God will be in the church the word will be spoken the sick will be healed with a word the dead will be raised the creation of God will be here well that's what it's for for your family and friends eternal life will be in youah not justification life not sanctification life not because gift but the full word Paul had so much full word in him he laid hands up on him and they received the Holy Ghost Philip with he went was translated amen down there to the ethopian unit and the full don't you understand a man feed as his son and daughter that's his seed it comes because to his physical body is that right there's his seed then therefore Christ seed come through your mouth I mean not in a part like the Luther Wesley Pentecostal the full word come out of Paul and Al be Peter's mouth and Philip in them the word came out of their mouth and when that full they were so full of quick and power when that word struck those hearts the spirit of Truth come right down and confirm the word amen and H them in there praise God where's your faith at the crucified one we got to die praise our God we got to Die Here Come the devil in 6768 coming around to to pull your away here and you watch him go over there and pull them off over there pull them off over there you say oh God they they had they did run well what happened what hindered the devil but thanks be to God if pervent you will repent and come back to God come back to the word start at the cross go down and repent some of you are sick and weakly right now I know that we see that there but we going stand up here like some ministers do said the Lord just sit weekly over there uhuh preach the word to you preach the word to you preach the word to you word word word word and when we still want to take the word thank you Lord C that word now another man walking here let me see now Spirit jump over there uh-uh see me now the spirit is over the whole thing his word word is going on but you got to grab it reach up by faith and take hold of the word of God and take it into your heart and go to the cross and then God will heal your body of anything that ails you see he'll heal your body sick and weakly but come to that word praise God well I I I mean to go off over there but he [Music] knows praise God the crucified on don't you know God loves you or otherwise he wouldn't be preaching like this this morning saying me amen why it's against popularity to preach like this here at this hour everything is nice here the Lord blessing us so why come like this here I mean so they save uhuh preach the word get other word he told you at the shepherd has a hook and right pull him back in Amen on the other side for the wolf cat him out of there that right see pull you back into the fold this morning friend come back to God the wor he'll heal your body just remember that he will heal your body praise God and then see now we're in child training amen child training see now we know that there are those that come in here and Peck away at you he knows who they are we know who they are but we don't have to call them out they will be be call out soon just remember that they will be called out soon that's no that's the that's the word of God but we don't say nothing that other words you are being tested they come Bing here and tell people just read your seven Church age book you don't need any ministers but yet they say because you don't need brother H and also because brother keman they say but any other men is all right right but I'm reading the word of God here let me see where's that here what's it say right here it says here uh uh and have put on a new man they haven't put on this new man yet which is renewed in knowledge see that's the old filthy of the world because so and so can't be saved and so forth natural brute Beast you know what I'm talking about after the image of him that because created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian cynthian and they tell me that the C was the worst Savage of all and he could be saved that right see me now and here come these Devils coming around here talking about go here and go here those are there were Christian Devils if you want to call it that up on paper anointing them to say these evil things and here you stand right but what is it so you know where we're standing at we're standing on the word it is the spirit of Sal jealousy and David must go through with it otherwise he is not proven or tested child trained are you following me now and that's why we don't say nothing just let them go but one day God will pull them out of there and they still worship you know but they won't take the word no more Holy Ghost no more because no more that see they come right up to you tell you well brother Coman or brother H they should have done so and so that's the devil right there speak come right to your face bold doesn't he walk up because right up in God's presence well he comes right in the presence of God where the word is preached and tell you the disciples in here trying to pull you to because poison your face in the ministry and so forth and also one another see that's filth that's garbage turn off your receivers don't even listen to it get away from that evil spirit needs to repent see so therefore God ordained Saul Saul's Spirit he was anointed with a jealous spirit and that must come before David was ever placed that right so come against him and before he was placed as the king he had to go through Saul he said and he wouldn't do it he and brother he had Saul pinned down so many times you know what I'm talking about brother you got Saul pinned down this morning you can call Saul out everyone right now this morning see he's pinned down by the word of God by his own Spirit pinned him down see the made manifest in his flesh you see it he's pinned what you leave alone joab thought because cut his head off see let him alone see touch not God KN and do his Propet no har just let him go on see but now I was coming and when then David is is placed as the king and when he was placed as the king he was still rejected all right and oh sh kick dirt up on him see school of suffering coming praise our God right with the word just straight right down the line amen so now we see where am I at well in closing when we are born again you come into a place of trying when you are born by the spirit of God when God has washed the world away from you completely and put a faith into your mental Faith where you where you hear the word of God he s Supernatural faith in it see and then you begin to add add by faith of the operation of the hand of God that raised up chist from the death same operation is operating in you amen see me now and you're adding and because you're add now you're being child trained see okay now in child training the son does not exercise all of the authority of the father father yes he what I say you have because this Authority in you but it's not exercised yet until your place he's saving that see until he changes because your name has to change first until he take you out to the place out there and put on a robe on you see and so that's that that's right here see first what you're putting on now is this here put on the new man Colossians 3:10 all right which is renewed in knowledge after the image him see okay verse 12 put on therefore as the elect are you because the elected of God see put on holy and beloved bows of of of Mercy kindness to humbleness of mind not thinking because you're somebody here see meekness longsuffering of because forbearing one another and forgiving one another which is brotherly kindness you see if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye now watch above all all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness now we are to add and there happens to be nine things here too but because we ought to add to our faith virtue and patience and so forth now we're putting putting on this new man he's being because renewed in the knowledge which came through H because his Prophet Elijah all right when this knowledge come in we begin to add add add add add but finally he said put on charity that's at the end of love of God that's at in because I have a note here because about charity here somewhere in here um yeah Divine love is to be put on as the the outer garment and Finishing Touch there got to be a Finishing Touch to you see God has been molding you and shaping you see and so other words it's just like a big cake so you want to make a a a angel food cake all right well in the Angels food cake because you got faith and Temperance and patience and all these things set in the bowl then come the Cake Maker amen and and and and he takes his blender see with love and then this love that he dips in there at last to make it smell sweet see he Blends it all together now angel food cake got to have a light touch all right don't make it too heavy it go fall flat see just the Right Touch when you makeing this cakee that right see and then the blend it Blends it all all together now we are the word we have it in us see his nature do you realize friends that the Capone slipped down to the church see with a shout and brought in the very nature character of God and mold it in there and you look around your oh there's something going on right now cuz you're being child trained your character see me now then that now so you may understand it many can't figure out because the Holy Ghost the baptism of because the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost they can't get it see so okay watch my son daughter see that's because my seed in the seed is a nature and spirit well that right but I'm here and the child's over there but it has a nature and a spirit which is my se you get it now so here's God he sends down his seed baptism of the Holy Ghost it has a nature of him and his Spirit but here he is up here so when when finally when you come this way adding to this nature being renewed faith and so forth amen then he's here then he because because in morphy he changes himself and he's because he has a body but he hangs up in the air and because because in morphe he changes into the Holy Spirit and sends it down then the person the the person of Christ comes down and clothes upon you amen see put on charity that's him he comes and then this charity Blends your faith patience virtue and Temperance all together Follow Me Now blend it all together by this love see in now then he goes with you the father sent me so I sent you and he go with you see me now but right now we are waiting for him to come but we have his nature his seed amen do you see it now see we have a seed in here see and this seed it is now growing now coming into the statue of a perfect man then God must see these things in you a Blasphemous names here page 25 now when when Jesus had been up the obedient Jesus the god lamb to the dust God placed him positionally this is him see now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost born by the Holy Ghost let their s now cuz there there are brothers out here teaching that there's no baptism and it says the prophets said born by the Holy Ghost see in to the family otherwise you'll never get in there see of God and has proven to have these virtues in him that God can look down and see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him and places him there's a true baptism of the Holy Ghost and away he goes see it now friends see so they can't get it but God is bringing you to this see now we ought to at the cross waiting to be placed now we're speaking about a baptism of suffering now we were baptized into his death see but now positionally in God's mind see he has reckoned that we are dead and our sins are dead also everything is dead but see it is mind soul we are positioned by experience we must come to that place that he has already seen us come there and be glorified already but he's got to to bring us to that place and when you get there then the dve comes down because every corn of wheat before it goes into the ground is first gerti amen so therefore you must first be gerti then you're ready to go into the ground of the word of God to produce the life of Jesus Christ amen see now can I remember Hebrews um 5 in closing here Hebrews 57 I think it says here Hebrews 5:7 at or six as he saith also in another place thou art a priest Forever After The Art of mzc who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him because from death and was heard in that he feared now watch though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation un to all them that obey him called of God the high priest after the order of Jesus Christ the perfect word perfect son right out he went with the dove up on him right and then he was positionally placed he ye him immediately cuz he almost went to his cross right so now watch yet though he was a son he still had to learn obedience other words he still had to prove that he what because obedience means Follow Me Now other words God knew because he was obedient I do nothing except the father show me see but Christ God rather wanted to prove to the world that his son will show the world what it means to be obedient to the will of God and on the cross he went he said I have a baptism to be baptized with and what he said over there in St Luke 126 that right he said because I have future a baptism to be baptized it was a baptism of suffering he had to be dipped into suffering on the cross are you following me friends I mean he had to be dipped into it because immersed in suffering on the cross see and he has this one because to be baptized with the early church because they went through it Paul went through it a brother BR we saw him go through it that right he was he went through suffering here even the song though I have suffered see it was a suffering but he never said nothing see me now and so therefore now I ain't saying because you have to die I don't mean that see but there's got to come an hour when we say we are the weak that right okay we've added and now we come up to Perfection but love is perfection so therefore love must unite all see you in now then prove what is obedience by the will of God then that seed must come up now watch everybody are waiting Hallelujah glory to God it's going to be a great big thing and so forth see but yet when it comes when Christ was crowned it was humbled on the cross that right in present stage of my Ministry because brother BR said I'm waiting to be crowned that right he was going on the cross see it now friends Paul and Peter now was waiting Peter want because to be crucified upside down See Me Now friends the other words those because because the disciples went out in the street and because they were beat for him everything that was their cross and we all got to have a cross but what God has been doing he's been child training you first see now then he brings you through uh the church here you know in here see and you're get the word because you're growing then he brings you up to a place and when he get you out there then he can send down his Divine love upon you and put on the Garment on you and then send you out see and out you go then you're led by the spirit the word breaks go over here say th stall just to give you a little illustration reath house did you ever read reath house you read it sometime R what a life back in 1900 around there Ral England they accepted because custom was uh two could have a hat for an Englishman so re how because he had to go up to London the big city with because no hat now that may seem like nothing but in in that time while that was a sin if you didn't have a hand the father said take no hand and and where he went and then they laugh at him they mock him they scorn and this sounds because crazy you maybe but see it's things like that that you have to do you don't know simp put it's across you tell me now then you will prove what obedience really is cuz it the wheat must be proved that it is a wheat and it got to have the same life same signs same power amen see and it must come to that friend are you following me you getting me praise the lord well got to be mean it's going to be anyway because regardless of what we to say about it it will come to that see so therefore these little light afflictions in here child training that's all it is now this is only for the crucified one this is a separation PR so I just speak to you plain this morning this is the separation coming I knew that uh as Gody was moving on that there had to be a cross Ministry always was the cross Ministry crowned the ministry see brother Brown said on souls in prison he said in that Vision out west what happened he stood up there he says the glory that right the golden glory of the what cross flowed into his chest is that right see when he was placed because adopted in 63 there with the seven angels there but what happened he still come around to the Colorado experience When God says come and take a walk with me see so then he walked contrary to man's mind man said tent tent tent he walked with God see preach the word here went over there went over there went over there see Walking with God see and he said there when this walk with God he says that all fear left nothing there was nothing he told Brother Le he said Le I have no more fear all on perfect peace right here because in Colossians let God rule in your heart see that question rise up God see so therefore this is power when this power of the Holy Ghost that work that will because work in me and if it works in you there's no arguments you know it's God no arguments you me now it's the same power working in me if it work in you we one amen and then you see signs following that Hallelujah and watch the first thing that happens when you go on the cross the very first word as they was nailing Christ to the Cross wicked men nail him to the cross that right what was he saying now me and myself when I first come to the Lord I pictured myself back there and I wanted to go up there you and because of Flesh see and because F them see now you think about that and up on the cross and what did he say father forgive them perfect Divine love well then when the bride goes on her cross love must come see it's got to be there it meets you as you go there and perfect Divine love must come to the bride to uh because bind the whole thing together and then when the love comes then situation you don't know what they are but they're there then when you come to the situation love is up on you perfect love then he'll reach into the heart the nature and pull out Temperance didn't pull out patience then it will be a living faith a living patience a living Temperance a living knowledge rightly dividing every word of God see speaking to one another in wisdom and all things teaching one another sit now and singing cuz Grace is in your heart and you just singing praising God in hymns and songs and with joy boy that's what's coming friend yes sir it's coming to his bride and she'll move in the P of God anywhere not in here see mean outside where he where he want at his purpose he said multiply and replenish right naturally they were supposed to go out with because natural seed all over the Earth that right and he even separated because came from them go out will spiritually multiply and fill what through the mouth the gospel that right go over there go over there preach the gospel go over there go over there preach the gospel to the whole world see but didn't happen that we of course you know but that was his plan see me now multiply so therefore the Holy Spirit must come down through here the life living water come out of your mouth see and it goes out that must come and it will come do you believe that friends do you love us do you understand excuse me what the Lord is trying to do now he's trying to bring us to a place and I have a note here about that there and uh that is is is is the actual experience you know the birthright produces the word is that right each first son had the birth right to produce the word that's why because Jacob fought for it hope they get that other words just by birth now they were supposed to because carried on the seat on down that right the first son was see so therefore when Jacob saw it happened there was because a switch there and therefore he because he for for it and he took the birth right and then he passed on the line amen see so we have the birth right see therefore we will be to do Christ cuz you got the birth you must do it you'll do it him the wait till the father take you there amen see yes now um see the son was born years ago before see but his character because his conduct was in question see so now he takes you us through child training to mold our character because because conduct as we go through this child right here you see what is before you yourself you see who has character you look you see yourself you see what is it in the person's heart what they desire you see it if they desire Christ you see that they're walking that way if they want something in the world here you see it also you don't have to say nothing you see it it's made manifest for right before you then you can do nothing because yourself see so therefore it's his character cuz which we're speaking about now when he comes to a certain place because in closing he should go to another office that God has up the cordain for him and this office over here say is to meet the the crisis of the hour the world coner now he's got to get the bride to a place here's the World Council moving here right the bride should be right here he's got got to bring her to that place so when they come here in that office it'll be Christ hear me now he'll have her there but he can't get of there until character is molded first through child training because I hope you see that amen then you who have been deep down in here by spirit thank God God has been sh and the others who beat you down see with evilness and so forth they've been used by God to crush you see so thank the Lord for the crushing thank him for the crushing for they had the spirit of Soul upon them not Even's an KN KN it they crushing you down Evil all the time and mean and so forth cring you God's bringing out anything lovely kindness patience with God and with them see holding back and you could say a word here you leave them alone you won't say nothing see now and just pray prayer Venture God would turn them around and Grant them because repentant realize that they've gone off the word see now I'm just scking plain this morning may I see like this again but I got to see PL D this morning because it's winding up see we know something six going to happen so you might have know where you stand see and so therefore so you will know good that it's been child training in high school here so to speak you're ready to go into college a school of special obedience that's a special school there me now special obedience where you are his beloved so he wants to because glorify himself through you and he's his glory is the world knows nothing about it they don't even understand it it's always opposite see me now so I say to you it'll be humble it'll be Christ it'll be divine love see but it'll be here you believe that that friend praise God it'll be here see so therefore um it'll be the word made flesh in you now how will he do it it says over in Romans 811 if the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken not your dead body your moral body I hope you see that the moral body that's living here Quicken it say now you want to obey every word and through because child training because you've been baptized you come out of the world and you have gotten rid of the television now that you can do by yourself see mean now but only Christ can live through you so you can do that by yourself see because uh the old Hebrews did that because back there they were Sanctified unto God just because because like in their own self you see now so we can do all these things because a sister can she can absolutely come out of the world if she wants to see me now then sit there and then let God add to you to experience experience and adding and adding then when you get up to a point where he where because you have showed a brotherly kindness and patience and so forth he see it there and I don't make believe now it's there cuz you've been through actual experiences see me now there a certain time he sends down the Capstone caps it off then what's in there he pulls it out by his Divine love the spirit must come to the word to make the word work and there's the word with the nature of God in it but it needs the fullness of God up on it and the way it goes and puts on this outter garment that makes him A well-dressed man it is the finishing touch amen this is perfection itself but because it is perfect and it's a perfect corn of wheat it got to be proved got to be proved that there is inside of it what it say it is and only way it can happen is to bring a certain situation situation comes you say nothing except God say the Lord and you'll stand there and then you see in God he'll be smiling down you tell the devil get back that's me walking on two things God coming suddenly to his Temple he's coming you his Temple he's building you into a place where he will come suddenly you don't have to be in here you can be home watching in the is this be up in the attic amen be up anywhere am but God is going to visit the crucified one those who will forsake the World by experience see me now you got to come to experience now forsake the love of the world the pride of life and the lust of the world here the lust of life just forsake the whole thing and then fling to the cross and stay there and then let the resurrection power of God work through and if it's a true servant he takes it to the St you believe that let's Worship the Lord a little bit Rock of Ages page 81 I believe it is I love the Lord and knowing that he first loved me amen I couldn't be at this point here just think friends that he would elect us the elected of God I mean we couldn't do it ourselves to come to this place and just stay fa faithful with the word through 66 67 68 3 years that's all all it's been but so much has happened I know it all kind of things could happen nevertheless we don't say it's got to be this year but this I know they they are predicting that there's supposed to be a great earthquake April the 669 there's two say everybody saying see I don't know but that is brother Brown's birthday and by the way um I told you that a brother down in Florida had had told to Baron about April 14th but that was wrong because I don't know because what he meant by that but because I checked it out and spoke to the rabbi in the Fel and so um I asked him about because the Passover and he told me that say April 3D and that's odd because this the April 3rd which it happens to be a Thursday see and Friday's is Good Friday of course because Easter is April the 6th so 3 4 5 and 6 come back together again see so there something odd about it and we don't know this I might drop this off to you just keep this in mind um we're looking for the resurrection of course see now we know that before the coming of the Lord there's to be a great earthquake that's what he said see now we don't know this what he means he mean before he comes in the air himself so you got to take every point of it see will it be the earthquake then before you go into Rapture or his coming in the resurrection see or the part of his coming that's hi to the bride which is coming now they going to forget because he had a two-fold Ministry he had one Ministry on the earth and one where he rose for 40 days that's right and resurrection power in that Ministry he came straight on the word for about 6 hours to his disciples be because going down the mail that right straight on the way old fool a slow heart to believe all the word that has been written already see talk right now and it behov that he had to suffer for this sake and so he went on say now will he come that way to the bride head that was a hi Ministry the world didn't see that Ministry there no only the bride saw that Ministry so therefore Acts 1:3 says that he showed himself alive amen those who are dead in Christ and who who they have been be crucified in there dipped in his anointing their lives are HID in there he is to appear will he appear to them with his life amen see in that same Ministry he also showed them many because because infallible proof that right that he was aive see and he spoke things pertaining to the kingdom of God see and he also breathed upon him he also placed him 10 them out in a hidden Ministry now you think on that see me know that's in the word see or will it be the actual Resurrection which the world still won't see it only the bride will see them for we're told by God's Prophet when the dead in Christ appear to the bride if a sign at the raptures that hand but he said the prophet said there's got to be a Ministry on the earth that Christ can come down and set in there with the same sign same life same Ministry to call up the dead now which is which so therefore will that if that is to be I don't know see well will that be a secret if it's a secret Ministry the world won't even know it neither will people in the message don't even I hope you caught that they won't even know because he'll come only to the bride by vision and he'll show her the word the spirit of truth will show it to her by vision and it'll take what has been spoken on the T and so forth in the Bible and bring it to her to her memory and then show her things to come and then she'll go out she'll walk somewhere maybe see and here's a person here false Christ standing up here glory to God hallelujah God said this is a devil and then she'll say nothing see and this person will blast him against you he I will I hope you follow me I'm trying to give a little hint see of what uh um see from what was in God's Prophet life he told he walk out there here was one man prophesying another man prophesying he he had a little gift you know this man took us say he was a devil see the other man was genuine Christian but he knew he he on know the word is coming friends Hebrews 4:12 sharper pord to the Joint Pastor Mars goes in to goes beyond the Flesh and goes into the spirit and picks up that Spirit there and flashes across on the screen out right before you and there you see it see everything is naked before him that's coming you believe that friend well then let us die to ourselves as we approach this year 69 and be one of these because crucified ones was going to take these because crucified one to be raised in the power of his resurrection to to to prove this ministry that's been spoken and so shall it be there's going to be a bride ministry here it's got to be it's got to be since the camp room comes down and sets himself at the headen there and then he raises up that bride do you love him well then let us ask God to hide Us in the cff of the rock praise the Lord As we sing this song Worship the Lord a little
