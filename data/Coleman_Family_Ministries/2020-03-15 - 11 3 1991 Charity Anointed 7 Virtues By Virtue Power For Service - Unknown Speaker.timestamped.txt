[1:24:01] amen where's oh my god okay okay he
[1:24:12] spoke the perfect faith page 10 the
[1:24:15] power has been here
[1:24:17] don't forget the the apostles were
[1:24:20] giving given power to preach the gospel
[1:24:25] Saint Matthew 10 st. Luke 9 correct they
[1:24:30] were given power first a man to cast out
[1:24:33] devils heal the sick raise it and preach
[1:24:35] the gospel and it still wasn't adopted
[1:24:39] they had to go to the upper room and
[1:24:42] then Christ came out apostles prophets
[1:24:45] passes vans and teachers and divided the
[1:24:47] holy ghost land in the upper room yes so
[1:24:55] brother Branham said when he come off
[1:24:57] the mountain Jesus come down that
[1:24:58] mountain
[1:24:59] and the nine disciples could not heal
[1:25:03] that epileptic or whatever he was that
[1:25:05] boy and then the man the father why your
[1:25:07] disciples could not heal him
[1:25:09] oh he a little afraid come here and he
[1:25:12] says this kind come not out but without
[1:25:15] fasting and praying I said fasting and
[1:25:18] praying and then one day I heard a Airy
[1:25:20] tape 1950 brother branham so what does
[1:25:23] that mean without fasting and praying
[1:25:24] and brother Graham said now you see I
[1:25:27] stopped everything at 3 p.m. because I
[1:25:30] have to go in fast and pray because I
[1:25:33] don't know he said that kind maybe on
[1:25:36] the platform when I walk out did you get
[1:25:40] it
[1:25:40] that was his ministry this kind does not
[1:25:43] come out but with fasting and praying so
[1:25:45] God give them mc2 brother branham its
[1:25:48] 1st and 2nd pool
[1:25:50] then the spoken-word see praise God so
[1:25:56] brother so on page 10 closing on Jesus
[1:26:00] said listen why could we do that because
[1:26:02] the lack of faith of your unbelief
[1:26:05] that's right because of your unbelief
[1:26:07] now remember they had had the power
[1:26:10] Jesus had given them the power to heal
[1:26:12] the sick to raise the dead cast out
[1:26:13] devils just a few days they had the
[1:26:16] power but not the faith to use the power
[1:26:19] there's a random Tabernacle there's a
[1:26:22] church there's a bride today the Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit is here with the power but you
[1:26:28] haven't got that faith to move it see
[1:26:32] what I mean it takes faith to move it it
[1:26:36] takes faith to step out and add to your
[1:26:39] faith virtue and knowledge and
[1:26:41] temperance and patience to move the
[1:26:44] power of God hallelujah the Spirit of
[1:26:47] Christ in the church it takes faith to
[1:26:50] call down brotherly kindness it takes
[1:26:52] faith to call down charity to move the
[1:26:55] power and put it back in the church
[1:26:57] Dynamis to your mechanics
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:02] know what I'm saying what kind of faith
[1:27:09] seven thunders give faith to move that
[1:27:13] and you cannot have the seven thunders
[1:27:16] before you get forgiveness because faith
[1:27:20] is based on forgiveness so it had to
[1:27:24] come correct
[1:27:25] forgive us had to come first on you name
[1:27:28] then come seven thunders on top of
[1:27:32] forgiveness that's a Bible when you
[1:27:36] stand praying st. mark 11:25 26 if you
[1:27:40] don't drop your or instill your heavenly
[1:27:41] father cannot forgive you may be seated
[1:27:46] Bible so now you people don't want to
[1:27:49] forgive where you had where are you and
[1:27:55] he said the Holy Spirit is here with the
[1:27:59] power but you haven't got that faith of
[1:28:02] movie see see what I mean it takes faith
[1:28:04] to move it and he speaks about the shell
[1:28:07] in the gun the powder is in the shell
[1:28:10] you put it in the gun and it takes feet
[1:28:14] up pull the trigger to ignite the powder
[1:28:17] in the shell and somebody shot
[1:28:24] but what about this today 7h area 97
[1:28:29] virtues by virtue powerful service right
[1:28:39] the powders in the shell but it needs
[1:28:41] faith to charge it throw it out that's
[1:28:44] what it takes the perfect faith to
[1:28:47] ignite the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:50] which we have now since it's come upon
[1:28:55] us you shall receive power after the
[1:29:01] Holy Ghost is come upon you seven seals
[1:29:05] seven thunders is upon you and you're

[1:29:20] the Holy Spirit and puts it back in the
[1:29:23] church and they come against the
[1:29:31] thunders a very thing brother Mills that
[1:29:34] will ignite the power of the seven seals
[1:29:36] hallelujah is seven thunders give faith
