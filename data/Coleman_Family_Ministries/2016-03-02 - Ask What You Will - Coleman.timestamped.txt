[45:48] Heat.
[45:56] caught up in heavenly places where
[45:58] everything is just white. I had that
[46:00] three times. I got to have it the fourth
[46:02] time.
[46:04] Oh, praise. I I I I just one time I was
[46:08] in a Pentecostal church and I recently
[46:10] come in there and away I went down off
[46:13] and down shouting and praising God.
[46:15] Amen.
[46:18] I want that again.
[46:21] You may say, "Well, P, I don't care what
[46:23] you call it. the Pentecostal experience,
[46:25] brother.
[46:28] You call it what you want to call it.
[46:30] I'm like, David, I see the ark coming
[46:33] down the road.
[46:36] And when David saw the ark coming up the
[46:39] road, he began to shout as loud as he
[46:42] could. He shouted, he praised God. His
[46:46] old dead wife, Micah,
[46:49] old denominational wife, she got mad
[46:51] because he was shouting and praising
[46:52] God. He said, "Woman, if you think this
[46:55] is something, you wait till I get a
[46:57] refund again.
[47:00] You ain't seen nothing."
[47:03] Praise God. Amen.
[47:06] That's your mouth. And God put a
[47:08] judgment up on her, too.
[47:11] Amen. See, her right there. So, look out
[47:14] now.
[47:16] Amen. See, don't the church woman says,
[47:18] "Is he the same? Can he heal the sick
[47:21] this morning?" That's a church. See, I
[47:24] mean, will he baptize? That's a church.
[47:27] But that brought out tasted of the new
[47:29] wine, I'm in the spirit. I know he's
[47:33] going to do anything he said he would do
[47:35] in his word. The revelator, the new wine
[47:38] is here to reveal it to me.
[47:43] Oh, what's it all about? It's the Holy
[47:45] Spirit in New York City as a secret
[47:47] service agent. Before we get to Fort
[47:50] Wayne, the agent is here. You know all
[47:52] about it, don't you? First the angel
[47:54] breaks the thunderstorm, then he comes
[47:55] back around to prove it. Hebrews 13:8.
[48:01] Remember now, no matter what happens in
[48:03] here in New York and before anything
[48:05] else happens is for a sign of
[48:07] perfection.
[48:09] The rainbow coat must be here.
[48:11] Joseph must wear it.
[48:14] You understand now?
[48:17] Oh, I can say a lot of things there, but
[48:18] I guess you got it. I couldn't see. It's
[48:21] not just for one Joseph. It's for Joseph
[48:23] the bride in New York City. Oh, now we
[48:25] got a wonderful right away. It's for
[48:28] him. No, it's for you. Amen. See, praise
[48:31] God. No more substitutes now. Amen.
[48:35] Because don't lick off of me. Just lick
[48:36] off yourself. Amen. There's nothing for
[48:38] you to lick too. Amen.
[48:40] Praise the Lord. Everybody here.
[48:43] Praise God.
[48:45] Yes, sir. Now, New York City, I want to
[48:47] read something back to you. See, I'm
[48:49] doing this one. So, you know exactly
[48:51] what is going on here. I just don't know
[48:52] how to bring this out. But remember when
[48:54] I had read from up on the whole armor of
[48:56] God back here in the fall. Now, I
[48:59] believe it's more real to you now. Huh?
[49:02] So, if I read something for you again,
[49:04] uh from the tape of of the whole arm of
[49:07] God, Santa Maria 7162, what is it? God
[49:10] makes himself ever present in his own
[49:14] army. God on the day of Pentecost sent
[49:16] down the full armor of God for his army.
[49:18] We ain't going nowhereless we have the
[49:19] full armor of God.
[49:21] He wouldn't do that unless he I mean he
[49:23] comes to go in us that was himself among
[49:26] you. Yet in a while the world see me no
[49:28] more. How do you think they're going to
[49:30] see him in those worldly churches?
[49:31] Amen.
[49:32] But they won't see him.
[49:33] Amen.
[49:34] I'll be where two or three are gathered
[49:35] in my midst are they?
[49:37] Yet the while the world seeth me no more
[49:39] yet ye shall see me because I will be
[49:41] with you even in you until the end of
[49:44] the world. Hebrews 12. See? Okay. Now
[49:46] the world but there are substitute
[49:48] churches. Just let them go in there and
[49:50] begin to preach his word that they throw
[49:52] him out.
[49:54] Any denominational church will not take
[49:57] Acts 30 Acts 238. They don't want
[49:59] healing. They don't want signs. They
[50:00] don't want that. No. They don't want
[50:02] screaming and shouting. Amen. No. They
[50:03] don't. That's the word. They rather have
[50:06] a substitute.
[50:08] Just try by the spirit. Try the spirit
[50:10] by the word, brother. See? Amen. Now, he
[50:13] is with us and in us. This is the armor,
[50:15] the word. And he is the Holy Spirit. And
[50:17] the Holy Spirit is in us, which is the
[50:19] word making the promise manifest. Oh,
[50:23] there he is. He comes down to make these
[50:24] promises manifest by new wine.
[50:28] Yes, sir. See, making them manifest. The
[50:30] spirit quickens the word. In other
[50:33] words, he's a coward that sends the Lord
[50:35] out there with us.
[50:38] Like David when he met Goliath, there
[50:39] was only one place for that rock to hit.
[50:42] Every else everything else was armed.
[50:44] But God got into that spirit rock. He
[50:47] had five stones faith in Jesus.
[50:49] Something is fixing to happen because
[50:50] there is the word, the promise, and the
[50:52] power to fling it. That's what we need
[50:54] today is a man that will take God's word
[50:56] with the power of the Holy Ghost behind
[50:58] him to press it out there and watch it
[51:01] come to pass. Yeah,
[51:02] that's God's army.
[51:04] See his word of fire, his army all dress
[51:08] with the ever present of himself. I'll
[51:10] go with you, be in you, not you that
[51:13] speaketh, the father dwellth in you, he
[51:14] doeth the works.
[51:16] I'm trying to show you who's here this
[51:17] morning.
[51:20] See, he presents his army in the form of
[51:23] five officers. Apostles, prophets,
[51:25] teachers, pastors, evangelists. That's
[51:27] his armies. That's his soldiers. That's
[51:30] his commanding officers all with the
[51:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out
[51:34] there to meet the enemy on any grounds
[51:35] he comes on.
[51:37] Oh, praise God. Amen. To meet the enemy
[51:41] with the word of God. Seven thunder
[51:45] that shakes the devil's kingdom.
[51:48] Each one backing one another up with
[51:51] him. The chief captain. That's what I
[51:53] was telling the brothers in Bulmont. I
[51:55] said, "Now the teachers, now the
[51:58] ordained ones rather, and the uh
[52:01] evangelists and pastors and so forth,
[52:03] now you we can have one accord. Now we
[52:06] can have one mind on the seven thunders.
[52:08] Now we can back away and won't cross one
[52:10] another. We have the same gospel that
[52:13] Aras and Martin
[52:16] preached. We preached the same gospel.
[52:20] Now her bride can know that what brother
[52:22] Brandham preached, she won't be afraid
[52:23] no more to open herself up. You
[52:26] understand to hear cuz you know the same
[52:29] gospel on them tapes saying the same
[52:32] thing.
[52:34] Amen. See now backing up with him the
[52:37] chief captain. Not out there in front,
[52:39] not up above, not behind, but in them.
[52:44] There he is. That's the army
[52:45] vindicating. Vindicating what? his
[52:47] resurrection by the proof of his work.
[52:50] St. John 14:12, the works I do shall he
[52:52] do also. What is it? It is God in the
[52:55] church in these five predestinated
[52:58] offices.

[53:03] offices.

[53:07] said, the man preaches the word and God
[53:10] is in there to back it up.
[53:14] The man come up here and lay hands up on
[53:15] the heel and then God is there to heal
[53:17] him.
[53:18] The man the Bible the Bible says doctor
[53:21] God did back it up.
[53:23] When it happened or a little bit here, a
[53:25] little bit there, a little bit there for
[53:26] 9 years, but one day comes in 1975 is
[53:29] all he's there.

[53:41] he'll speak? Can I show you this
[53:42] morning?
[53:43] Amen.
[53:44] Amen. Every word that you said with the
[53:47] Holy Spirit himself in there, which is
[53:50] the word made manifest.

[54:11] 17:30 was made manifest. We saw the
[54:13] charity around Malachi 4. He had on a
[54:16] rainbow coat.

[56:06] more than a training. You can read words
[56:08] and read words never make it come to
[56:10] pass until you have the Holy Ghost and
[56:12] the manifest words. We read the spoken
[56:15] word for years and didn't know nothing.

[56:38] the name of the past, stand there with
[56:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and prove
[56:43] that it is the truth.
[56:46] Therefore, we stand with the baptism of
[56:48] the Holy Ghost and Jes
[57:12] today and forever.
[57:14] Praise God.
[57:16] Praise God.
[57:18] Amen. Prove with standing

[1:00:35] everything out and puts the word in
[1:00:37] there with the power of God behind and
[1:00:39] back it up. The whole of God is the

[1:01:21] word. And here is the word ga.
[1:01:25] Amen. All of this dubtales in together.
[1:01:28] Praise God. Here we are. There's a now

[1:01:37] pastor is preaching the faith of the
[1:01:40] early church the same faith and the
[1:01:42] people finally believe the same faith.
[1:01:45] Oh my. He says they have the same faith
[1:01:48] and the pastor is preaching Bible
[1:01:50] prophecies. He said that Jesus Christ
[1:01:53] walks out of the pages of the Bible into
[1:01:57] the congregation.

[1:04:12] I was preaching there as what you will.
[1:04:15] This message was preached for faith to
[1:04:17] pray for my wife for Brian and I. Amen.
[1:04:21] Yesterday, my own natural brother
[1:04:23] Frankie cuz he called me up. He was
[1:04:25] supposed to have the uh uh the uh um
[1:04:28] wedding anniversary and he called me up
[1:04:30] to tell me because he can't come without
[1:04:32] excuses. I said, "All right, brother.
[1:04:35] It's all right." I says, "But I'm going
[1:04:36] to one thing. You will come to church
[1:04:38] one time."
[1:04:41] So just to get a chance to testify to
[1:04:44] brothers which I've never been with 12
[1:04:46] years
[1:04:47] through the wedding anniversary and him
[1:04:49] calling she couldn't come. I let him
[1:04:54] when my wife came home. I was just
[1:04:56] shouting and running all the room.
[1:05:05] I said, "You understand 12, 13 years. I
[1:05:08] finally told you about Jesus Christ. My
[1:05:12] people all those years
[1:05:14] cuz he adopted children. He's sweet.
[1:05:16] He's good. They want children. Adopted
[1:05:18] children." Well, you see this in my way
[1:05:21] to worship God. I told him yesterday,
[1:05:24] you give all your good to the poor. You
[1:05:26] give your body to be.
[1:05:29] You know all the mysteries, Frankie.

[1:06:10] there. I want to ask God to trouble you.
[1:06:14] Make you wake up.

[1:06:48] and I was preaching this message what

[1:06:53] by the Holy Spirit. I want to read it to
[1:06:55] you now
[1:06:58] December the 7th, 1971.
[1:07:02] I was in prayer getting ready go to work
[1:07:03] about 5:00 in the morning and I was
[1:07:05] reading the perfect strength every week
[1:07:07] on page 31
[1:07:09] reading about David and paragraph 210
[1:07:13] that's what the holy that's what the
[1:07:14] matter today God of sheep that's going
[1:07:17] astray organization things have stole
[1:07:19] them out brought them out into
[1:07:21] psychology God give us Davids with the
[1:07:23] word of God and the power of God to to
[1:07:26] direct it when we go to meet these
[1:07:29] intellectual giants
[1:07:32] with all the PH LS Q us or whatever it
[1:07:36] might be. Give me the word of God in a
[1:07:38] pound of Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we
[1:07:40] can slay every child on the field.
[1:07:43] This is when that first begin to come to
[1:07:45] me. I wrote it down and on the other
[1:07:47] side and today we know we we need a
[1:07:50] revival. We know we need a stirring
[1:07:52] amongst the the people. It will not take
[1:07:56] a doctor or a divinity. It'll take a
[1:07:57] week. Hallelujah. That'll take the word
[1:07:59] of God and the power and resurrection of
[1:08:01] Christ and slay this thing. It'll bring
[1:08:04] Christ to the country. Did it.
[1:08:09] Amen. Malachi 4 down and the hero of
[1:08:12] faith Christ away for 9 years and born
[1:08:14] right back.
[1:08:16] Manifested him.
[1:08:18] See what it is. Take the word of God,
[1:08:20] the power of resurrection of Christ and
[1:08:22] slay this thing and bring Christ to the
[1:08:23] country. Let them see that he can still
[1:08:25] open the eyes of the blind.
[1:08:27] Amen.
[1:08:31] Heal the sick raised the dead. He's
[1:08:33] God's conqueror. Amen. We need David
[1:08:36] untrained.
[1:08:38] I read this here and then uh holy
[1:08:40] inspiration struck me. And this is what
[1:08:43] I wrote back in the spirit.
[1:08:45] I spirit early morning rock of
[1:08:48] revelation stones. Word of God with the
[1:08:50] power of the resurrection of God to
[1:08:52] direct the stone to the intellectual
[1:08:54] giants. That's what he said there. Then
[1:08:56] the inspiration come down. Here's the
[1:08:58] way it comes. The rock confession
[1:09:00] revelation of Christ is directed to the
[1:09:03] intellectual giant stone in the
[1:09:05] forehead. This Holy Spirit right now.
[1:09:06] See? And the rock revelation will slay
[1:09:10] every one of them. Slay the church's
[1:09:12] intellectual conception of the message.
[1:09:15] I wrote it out. Follow my way and fade
[1:09:18] away. We're all about it. One day, June
[1:09:21] 20th, Wednesday night, getting ready to
[1:09:23] pray for Sister Coleman in there. Down
[1:09:25] come the one who revealed that to me and
[1:09:28] had me lay out just that when he broke
[1:09:30] in on you on the tape, but I got a a
[1:09:33] view of those quotes right here. And I
[1:09:36] was speaking there building faith to
[1:09:39] pray for the eye and the Holy Spirit
[1:09:42] coming with a direct utterance. Y'all
[1:09:45] didn't even catch it. I guess
[1:09:47] something hit me in the head. You know
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:50] that was the night that was me I was
[1:09:51] gone.
[1:09:53] See now I want you to understand how he
[1:09:55] speaks through voice.
[1:09:58] So you understand
[1:10:00] who that's the Lord. Amen. Is it simple
[1:10:04] and normal human being speaking through
[1:10:06] women speaking through? Why would why
[1:10:09] was it in the Pentecostal days here and
[1:10:11] in the 30s and 40s and 50s here when a
[1:10:13] man or a woman even hypocrites would
[1:10:15] stand up and speak out in tongues they
[1:10:17] know it's God?
[1:10:20] They know it's God but they can't know
[1:10:22] it's God when you're preaching the word.

[1:10:27] inspiration say

[1:13:41] But it went right by it. See, and smash
[1:13:45] it into Goliath's forehead and all the
[1:13:47] intellectual forces, tense, white
[1:13:49] horses, intellectual powers of the
[1:13:51] message. Wow.
[1:13:53] Will be scattered and a true message
[1:13:56] shall go forth. There will be one more
[1:13:58] ride.
[1:14:00] Not even knowing.
[1:14:02] Oh, praise God. I feel good tonight.
[1:14:04] It's going to have a stop right here in
[1:14:05] New York tonight. Blessed be the name of
[1:14:07] the Lord. And brother Hunt says, "Wow, I
[1:14:09] feel different."
[1:14:12] That was the Holy Ghost, friends. Oh my.
[1:14:14] See, now it's buttered on June 20 here.
[1:14:17] I'm praying. Get ready to to pray with
[1:14:19] Fort and this breaks in on us. When the
[1:14:22] revelation goes to to Connecticut,
[1:14:24] Indiana, Tucson, Georgia, South America,
[1:14:26] all different places was slaying Goliath
[1:14:30] a year before Georgia not knowing
[1:14:34] 71, 73, 74. So I go see and you'll see
[1:14:38] the sheep of God come screaming forth
[1:14:40] praising God.
[1:14:42] Intellectual powers and whatnot, their
[1:14:46] interpretations, man-made ideas.
[1:14:49] When the real David takes a stone of
[1:14:52] that rock of the rubbish of Jesus
[1:14:53] Christ, when that David stands out there
[1:14:55] with that confession of what the seven
[1:14:57] seal is, when did that happen? Here is
[1:15:01] when God come down from heaven and
[1:15:05] thundered out the revelation
[1:15:09] [Music]

[1:21:27] building
[1:21:46] down. I knew nothing about it.
[1:21:50] was saying those words. Didn't even hear
[1:21:51] the tape again like that until January.
[1:21:54] I heard it going up to Canada and just
[1:21:57] heard it just to hear it, but I never
[1:21:59] knew it. And then he revealed it to me
[1:22:01] on September 20th and said the seven
[1:22:03] sons of the seven voices of the seven
[1:22:05] church agents. Still didn't hear it
[1:22:06] again yet until I get ready to go to
[1:22:08] Bulma
[1:22:10] here to take and I heard he said now you
[1:22:12] shouldn't be afraid to go to Bulma. You
[1:22:14] already preached it.
[1:22:18] Praise God. run out of faith going down
[1:22:20] a home run, brother. I knew exactly
[1:22:23] where I was. I had already preached it,
[1:22:28] God. So, I'm trying to explain to you
[1:22:31] now. Do you understand what I'm trying
[1:22:33] to say? It'll be so humble and simple.
[1:22:37] You'll be trying to figure out like a
[1:22:39] great anointing
[1:22:41] of the Lord on it be walk right by you.
[1:22:44] It'll be the word
[1:22:46] the same word through Malachi 4 walk
[1:22:48] through us for 3 years. If you don't
[1:22:50] have the token there to examine pass
[1:22:52] through you won't know it
[1:22:55] and so will it pass right through us
[1:22:56] again. We'll be gone out of here
[1:22:58] shortly.
[1:23:00] It's the word revealed to whomsoever he
[1:23:04] will. Greater is he that is in you than
[1:23:08] he is in the world. How do you think I
[1:23:10] feel this morning?
[1:23:14] knowing that God revealed like a thunder
[1:23:18] and there it was right there. When you
[1:23:20] talk about healings, the healings ready
[1:23:22] to be here now. They have to come. Why
[1:23:25] you supposed to all those things
[1:23:26] happening? They have got to follow the
[1:23:30] thunder.
[1:23:32] It's the same life back on the earth
[1:23:34] again is here. Greater as he is than
[1:23:37] you, he is in the world. Brother, we
[1:23:40] here. What a revelation. Oh my. Yes, I
[1:23:43] swear God has sent forth that rubbish
[1:23:46] like a thunder. My this thunder all down
[1:23:48] through us. It's been happening to us
[1:23:50] ever since.
[1:23:52] Now, friends, who's ashamed of the
[1:23:53] gospel? Oh, I've been talking with the
[1:23:56] different brothers and all, but we
[1:23:57] having a good time. Amen. Yes, sir. See,
[1:24:00] now, praise God today. My inspiration
[1:24:04] was greater is he that is in you. There
[1:24:07] was the he in there June the 9th in
[1:24:10] seven parts and didn't know it.
[1:24:13] Didn't know it going down to Georgia
[1:24:15] then cuz he was in there in seven parts.
[1:24:17] Then down comes charity and brings it
[1:24:20] right out.
[1:24:22] Has changed ever since. Oh my. Oh
[1:24:25] church, you were little children before
[1:24:28] the revelation. You knew that you were
[1:24:30] saved and your sins were forgiven,
[1:24:32] didn't you? Oh, in first John. But now
[1:24:34] you're young men. You have another
[1:24:36] experience now.
[1:24:38] Oh, amen. You're strong.
[1:24:41] Amen.
[1:24:42] The word of God abidth in you.
[1:24:45] The seventh thunder revelation is in
[1:24:47] you.
[1:24:48] Now his words are in you. And number
[1:24:52] three, you have overcome the wicked one.
[1:24:55] Why? He have already done it. He has
[1:24:57] lived out the bride age already in you.
[1:25:01] It's already finished and over with. The
[1:25:04] bride he lives is finished.
[1:25:07] He lived out the church just through
[1:25:09] wrestling and looph And he lived it out
[1:25:11] for them. The messengers caught the
[1:25:13] revelation not fully revealed but
[1:25:16] preached by faith and the people were
[1:25:17] saved by faith, work by faith, move by
[1:25:20] faith, and die on by faith to the Lord.
[1:25:24] It's a life of faith.
[1:25:27] So if you ever want it scientifically
[1:25:29] prove it, forget about it. You will walk
[1:25:32] by faith.
[1:25:37] I don't care how you feel tomorrow
[1:25:39] morning.
[1:25:43] Is the victory over the world
[1:25:48] and this victory is in the ground this
[1:25:51] morning.
[1:25:53] He overcome the world through seven
[1:25:55] church ages. That victory is in you this
[1:25:58] morning by faith.
[1:26:03] It is
[1:26:05] not feeling
[1:26:08] how you look who you are
[1:26:11] God tabernacles
[1:26:14] and human vessels.
[1:26:18] Ye are God's little children. You have
[1:26:21] overcome them. Who is them? The
[1:26:23] antichrist. You overcome the false
[1:26:26] Christ. You overcome Satan and all his
[1:26:29] ministers. You overcome the communist
[1:26:32] and the agnostic.
[1:26:36] You made it.
[1:26:38] You have overcome them.
[1:26:41] You have overcome the w of the
[1:26:45] heart.
[1:26:48] You have overcome the world.
[1:26:52] Why? Because he overcome the world and
[1:26:55] he is in you.
[1:26:58] Greater is he that is in you and he out
[1:27:01] in the world.
[1:27:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] body atmosphere. He'll spare you, curse,
[1:27:36] you stay in the word.
[1:27:42] Somebody is greater than him.
[1:27:48] Your husband, your wife, your family are
[1:27:50] coming.
[1:27:52] Stay in the atmosphere of the word.
[1:27:56] Cannot fail. He gave the promise.
[1:28:00] I don't care if your daughter is sitting
[1:28:02] in the church this morning
[1:28:05] and leave here and live any kind of life
[1:28:07] out here in the world
[1:28:11] right through the bridges.
[1:28:14] I know what's going on in here
[1:28:18] in here but you hold on
[1:28:25] here.
[1:28:26] Don't look at the condition. I don't
[1:28:28] care if they smoking pot or whatever
[1:28:30] they doing. Drinking wine, going out
[1:28:33] with the boys, sneaking around.
[1:28:40] He will not kill you.
[1:28:44] He won't do it. Let me tell you in a
[1:28:47] dream you and him.
[1:28:51] Don't forget that dream.
[1:28:57] Don't forget it, sister.
[1:28:59] Don't you forget it.
[1:29:02] He said you and him pyramid
[1:29:06] way before
[1:29:08] you know. She don't know how she got it.
[1:29:10] She
[1:29:16] has got a shot hand.
[1:29:18] Don't look at his work. Look at his
[1:29:20] work.
[1:29:23] Look at what he's already done. It is
[1:29:26] finished. It's over. I have overcome.
[1:29:34] I don't care what he's still doing.
[1:29:36] Forget about it. Coming down
[1:29:54] Here the pumpkin is here.
[1:30:13] before
[1:30:16] anything
[1:30:23] you say I don't know comes down in the
[1:30:26] last second
[1:30:32] nothing but the truth was the atmosphere
[1:30:36] walking
[1:30:43] like Abraham.
[1:30:47] Amen.
[1:30:58] The devil get a short time to work.
[1:31:01] Jesus Christ said, "Judas, what thou
[1:31:03] doest do it quickly?
[1:31:06] I'm about to t my people. You going to
[1:31:09] sell me out? There's going to be a
[1:31:11] resurrection shortly. Judas and the
[1:31:14] devil Judas today is going to be a
[1:31:17] resurrection."
[1:31:20] Don't Judas quickly move.
[1:31:25] Why? He's got to do it. Amen. that lives
[1:31:27] over hell.
[1:31:29] Perfect strength. Page 51. And brother
[1:31:32] lives come over hell. That's right.
[1:31:34] Streams of demon powers. 200,000,000
[1:31:37] demons is pouring from everywhere. It's
[1:31:40] conquered the nations. Conquer politics
[1:31:42] till it's rotten to the core.
[1:31:45] Conquer the churches until they know
[1:31:47] nothing but denomin. Page 52. Oh my. I
[1:31:50] talk about the lit up the kettle. Demons
[1:31:53] going around powers of the devil under
[1:31:56] the name of Christianity.
[1:32:00] Schools all polluted with filthy sex.
[1:32:03] Look, a little Janie Lawson here called
[1:32:05] me and her wife up crying. Said she was
[1:32:08] down in prayer with her mother. She goes
[1:32:10] to some old crazy art school down here.
[1:32:13] Nobody wanted her to go, but she had to
[1:32:16] walk her own footsteps
[1:32:18] cuz she had to have an experience with
[1:32:19] God herself.
[1:32:21] And the season of time, God drove her to
[1:32:24] her knees and said, "Get out of that
[1:32:25] school
[1:32:26] full of devils." She said, "Uncle Joe, I
[1:32:28] can't go no more. I'm finished." I said,
[1:32:30] "God spoke to you, Jonie."
[1:32:34] That same God can speak to your daughter
[1:32:36] and your son.
[1:32:38] They must have their own experience.
[1:32:42] If mama say don't go, that's because
[1:32:43] mama said you understand, mama. But when
[1:32:46] God says it,
[1:32:51] No worries at the Singleton. We'll get
[1:32:54] back. We have a word of reconciliation,
[1:32:57] restoration.
[1:33:04] Praise God. Amen. Oh my. What testimony
[1:33:08] God is doing with his people all week
[1:33:11] long going around the name of
[1:33:13] Christianity teaching for talking the
[1:33:15] commandments of men do. Amen. Believe in
[1:33:18] the Bible alone. River base. Yes sir.
[1:33:20] Antichrist. Paul's Christ. Angels of
[1:33:22] light spots in your feast. Yes sir.
[1:33:26] Crowds. They are clouds. Popped up
[1:33:28] clouds without water. No Holy Spirit.
[1:33:32] Yes sir. Carry them out with wind of
[1:33:35] their own doctrines.
[1:33:37] Trees without fruit. The fruit wither.
[1:33:40] Twice dead broke up by roots.
[1:33:43] Raging weight of the seed. pulling out
[1:33:46] of the old shame. Yes, sir. Wandering
[1:33:49] stars off course. I thank God he put us
[1:33:53] on course.
[1:33:55] Satan is working through the communist
[1:33:57] rulers, false ecclesiastical rulers,
[1:33:59] Arabs, Jews, Kissingers, devils working
[1:34:03] miracles going throughout the earth.
[1:34:06] Don't you know what's going on?
[1:34:08] California victimless slide. The Arabs
[1:34:10] have the money to go and everything
[1:34:12] else. They're working famous feverishly
[1:34:14] with the Jews and Arabs to get ready to
[1:34:16] to sign that tax on. Oh church, we have
[1:34:20] to leave. He come down and take us out.
[1:34:25] Thank God. Thank God I'm going to leave
[1:34:27] her. You young children, if you got a
[1:34:30] year left or a few months left, you have
[1:34:32] nothing. And oh, how you going to answer
[1:34:35] for this message? If you over 12 years
[1:34:38] old, I'm talking about you and you and
[1:34:40] you and the rest of you. Don't you think
[1:34:42] it's smart to sneak around here in this
[1:34:44] church here, be all tired, and go back
[1:34:47] outside and put on your minis, run
[1:34:49] around with boys, you know, hypocrites.
[1:34:52] Don't you do that. You think God ain't
[1:34:54] watching you.
[1:34:58] Repent.
[1:35:02] Repent.
[1:35:06] Get out of the way. Come back.
[1:35:09] Who you think you're fooling? There's a
[1:35:11] eye watching you. That eye is on the
[1:35:15] earth in the capstone. You don't believe
[1:35:17] me? Take out your dollar bill. Look on
[1:35:19] your Bible. You see an eye in the cap.
[1:35:22] That I am here now.
[1:35:26] He's a work quicker, more powerful,
[1:35:28] sharper than in two swords. He knows
[1:35:31] what's in your heart. Brother, you
[1:35:32] better get back to God before he cut you
[1:35:35] off.

[1:35:49] God speaks to you today. Repent children
[1:35:52] get back to pop. God's fixing to pour
[1:35:55] out a devastation upon America. And

[1:36:00] laying there day and night with tears
[1:36:04] crying out for you.

[1:38:40] Lord Jesus, every head, heavenly father,
[1:38:45] you here now. Come down here over these
[1:38:48] children now. Convict them, Lord.
[1:38:53] their hearts. I curse every devil in
[1:38:56] their hearts. I cast out worldliness. I
[1:39:00] cast out filthiness. I cast out every
[1:39:03] unclean spirit showing every hateful
[1:39:06] deed. Lord God, take the fight. Heavenly
[1:39:10] Father, clear God. Don't let them be
[1:39:13] hypocrites. Impersonate us. These are
[1:39:16] our children. Father, we cry for them.
[1:39:21] Oh God, save them from this untored
[1:39:23] generation.
[1:39:25] Save them. Lord, save them. Deal with
[1:39:28] their hearts, Lord. Fill them with the
[1:39:30] Holy Ghost. Lord God, honor Eurekio's
[1:39:36] faith. Go up into Connecticut now. Take
[1:39:39] their son and their daughter. Come up on
[1:39:41] them. Change their hearts up there in
[1:39:43] Connecticut, Lord, to honor their faith
[1:39:45] for being here today. Anyone out here,
[1:39:48] any child out here today, wherever they
[1:39:50] are, I pray for them today. Change their
[1:39:54] little hearts. Break them down. Deal
[1:39:57] with them. Break them up.
[1:39:59] Mold them and shame them and build them
[1:40:02] up again. Lord,
[1:40:04] the little teenage
[1:40:07] Jonathan,
[1:40:08] Rebecca, and the babies. May thy loving
[1:40:12] hand be upon them.
[1:40:17] Heavenly Father, I commit these children
[1:40:20] into thy hands
[1:40:22] as a trophy
[1:40:25] of this message.
[1:40:27] For greater is he that is in them than
[1:40:31] he is in the world.
[1:40:34] Lord God, by the authority and
[1:40:36] omnipotent power as a minister of the
[1:40:39] gospel, I snatched them out of the world
[1:40:41] this day.
[1:40:43] This day may they be snatched from the
[1:40:46] world. Lord God, brother Dillia's
[1:40:49] children, I snatched them from the
[1:40:52] world. Every one of them, this man is
[1:40:55] serving you with all his children. I
[1:40:59] snatch his father from the world. I
[1:41:02] curse that spirit upon his daughter that
[1:41:05] loves to run around in the world. I
[1:41:07] curse in the name of Jesus Christ. May
[1:41:09] the Holy Spirit come on his children and
[1:41:13] all the children in here.
[1:41:16] Praise God.
[1:41:24] Position is here. Just children.
[1:41:30] Praise God.

[1:41:36] down into your souls. Now close your
[1:41:39] eyes and mama and daddy sing to the Lord
[1:41:42] and thank the Lord for
[1:41:52] the heart.
[1:42:01] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[1:44:28] Church,
[1:44:30] Jesus Christ of Nazareth is here this
[1:44:33] morning.
[1:44:34] Mrs. Munos,
[1:44:37] she's daughter-in-law to Sister S. Forza
[1:44:42] lives in St. Croy. I couldn't go to St.
[1:44:45] Croy because God had her to come here.
[1:44:49] She has cancer in the breast and she was
[1:44:53] to go under a knife Tuesday pass
[1:44:58] and she called her mother-in-law to ask
[1:45:00] for who was just healed of the forming a
[1:45:03] cataract on her eyes. She knew a cow
[1:45:07] guy.
[1:45:08] So she asked her mother to come there
[1:45:11] and more often than know you called my
[1:45:13] pastor cuz we had just prayed for sister
[1:45:15] rain over the telephone.
[1:45:18] God had removed a tumor. So sister Rosen
[1:45:21] knew at the same God could heal her. So
[1:45:25] Mrs. Munoz called me just Monday morning
[1:45:28] after he came down in her Sunday. She
[1:45:31] had three lumps in her breast and her
[1:45:34] breast had to come off.
[1:45:37] We kneel down in prayer. The Holy Spirit
[1:45:40] took away two of us.
[1:45:44] Why only two? Because he wanted her here
[1:45:47] this morning to get saved.
[1:45:53] Oh, what did she do? She went to another
[1:45:57] doctor. He only found one,
[1:46:00] but she had felt three. Two were gone.
[1:46:04] Then she knew impulse strong.
[1:46:07] She had to get to New York City. She had
[1:46:09] no money. She sold what she had as it
[1:46:12] was
[1:46:14] to her mother to come home mother and
[1:46:16] her children. And here she is here
[1:46:17] today. She wants to give her heart to
[1:46:20] God.
[1:46:22] She wants to be baptized.
[1:46:25] And God is here right now
[1:46:28] to remember that last cancer
[1:46:35] as a sign of the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:46:39] that he's here this morning. Another
[1:46:41] positive sign.
[1:46:44] He's here. My sister Elmer going through
[1:46:47] great trials and that is sick but God's
[1:46:51] going to heal this morning. Someone else
[1:46:55] the great position is here.

[1:48:19] How many here were touched by the Lord?
[1:48:23] Were you children touched by the Lord?
[1:48:25] You really don't want to serve God,
[1:48:27] Eddie, Melissa, and all the rest of
[1:48:29] y'all. You want to serve God, God loves
[1:48:32] you. He that wasn't me. He called you
[1:48:35] out for your mother's been travailing
[1:48:38] many years for you. All of you. This is
[1:48:41] the day of salvation. The world hates
[1:48:43] you.
[1:48:44] The world dress you up in little short
[1:48:46] dresses and what make you look like a
[1:48:47] fool. Make you a bait out there in the
[1:48:50] world. But God loves you. He saved you
[1:48:53] today. Your father's coming. This is a
[1:48:56] day of salvation to his people. Every
[1:48:59] single last one of them. Greater is he
[1:49:02] that is in you. Remember that you are of
[1:49:06] God. You have overcome the world. Amen.

[1:53:30] the sticking on this.
[1:53:33] Fire
[1:53:41] people.
[1:53:43] Greater is he that is in you than he is
[1:53:47] in the world.
[1:53:51] Greater was he
[1:53:54] that was in Daniel
[1:53:56] than he that was stirring up the lion.
[1:54:00] The God made the the animals to sit down
[1:54:03] and feed together and in the millennium
[1:54:06] they will sit down together. Why?
[1:54:09] Because the Satan won't be there.
[1:54:13] Amen.
[1:54:14] Well, if God could come down in the
[1:54:16] lion's den and take Satan out of the
[1:54:18] lion, greater is he
[1:54:22] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:54:24] lion.
[1:54:25] That same he is here right now. Greater
[1:54:29] is he that is in you than that cancer
[1:54:32] that was in our sister.
[1:54:35] Greater is he that is in you that's in
[1:54:37] that blind eye.
[1:54:40] Greater more powerful quicker
[1:54:47] is he that is in my life than he is in
[1:54:52] that.
[1:54:54] I can't do anything.
[1:55:09] I
[1:55:11] believe it with all my heart.
[1:55:18] Praise God. We know he's here.
[1:55:25] The Lord Jesus Christ of the Lord.
[1:55:30] Oh,
[1:55:32] glorify his name.
[1:55:35] Glorify his name.
[1:55:38] Glorify the name of the Lord.
[1:55:54] Oh,
[1:56:01] heat,
[1:56:04] heat.
[1:56:14] the power of
[1:56:17] the power
[1:56:19] of the Lord. Why? Because greater is he
[1:56:24] that is in you than he is in the world.
[1:56:27] Blessed be the name. Blessed be the
[1:56:32] name.
[1:56:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord. We have
[1:56:37] the victory.
[1:56:39] Blessed be the name.
[1:56:42] Blessed be the name.
[1:56:45] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:56:50] Oh, praise God. Don't you love him?
[1:56:54] Children, do you know where you are
[1:56:56] right now?
[1:57:00] Hell is on the earth. The people can't
[1:57:03] go nowhere. Perplexity,
[1:57:06] fear of looking on the things coming on
[1:57:10] the earth. There's no escape.
[1:57:14] In no time, there was the odd to go out.
[1:57:17] They went in. Eight went into the arm
[1:57:19] and the children went on in Noah and his
[1:57:21] children. Do you know what happened
[1:57:23] today? God just pulled in your children
[1:57:25] today.
[1:57:31] Amen. Where did he put your children? He
[1:57:34] pull up seven steps
[1:57:36] up to the launching pad.
[1:57:39] Apollo 11 is sitting up on top
[1:57:42] and they just walked down seven steps
[1:57:45] and entered into Apollo 11. That's the
[1:57:48] only escape patch out. There's not
[1:57:51] another way out of our
[1:57:56] Jesus Christ, the body of God on the
[1:57:58] earth, the word.
[1:58:00] And we have entered into the word.
[1:58:04] And the fire of God's beginning to move
[1:58:07] up, brew her up, pushing spread out. The
[1:58:10] fire of God is spilling down the steps.
[1:58:12] Coming down, coming down, quickening,
[1:58:14] anointing our virtues.
[1:58:18] We're on the way home, children.
[1:58:20] Amen.
[1:58:21] Just a few more turns.
[1:58:23] Amen.
[1:58:23] And we'll be gone.
[1:58:26] Brother Kirk, your wife is delivered
[1:58:29] today. Yeah. Heat.
[1:58:54] Heat.
[1:58:57] Heat.
[1:59:04] according
[1:59:25] unto you
[1:59:32] Jesus.
[1:59:34] Oh hallelujah.
[1:59:36] Praise God. Lord Jesus, we worship you
[1:59:39] in spirit and truth. Oh God, realizing
[1:59:43] that thou art in our midst, Lord, we bow
[1:59:47] before thee to worship you, Lord God. We
[1:59:50] thank you, Lord, from the depths of our
[1:59:52] soul. This is the day that you have. We
[1:59:56] will rejoice and be glad there. May you
[2:00:00] be with us, Lord. bring us safely back
[2:00:03] to light. In Jesus' name we ask it.
[2:00:05] Amen. And amen.
