[2:15] carcasses of the hosts of Philistine all
[2:17] of them this day to the fowls of the air
[2:19] and to the wild beasts of the earth that
[2:22] all the Earth may know that there is a
[2:24] God in Israel and all this assembly
[2:28] shall know that the Lord saith not with

[3:14] to pass when the Phyllis and arose and
[3:17] came in June I dove to meet David David
[3:21] didn't walk slow that David hastened and
[3:25] ran toward the army to meet the
[3:28] Philistine brother he ran with it
[3:31] charged into this giant and David put
[3:35] his hand in his bag and took thence a
[3:37] stone slaying and smote the Philistine
[3:40] in the forehead that the stone sunk
[3:42] until his forehead he fell upon under
[3:45] his face to the earth so David prevailed
[3:47] over the Philistine watch with a sling
[3:50] and with the stone with a revelation
[3:53] that God of Israel would do it for him
[3:56] amen
[3:57] and with a stone and smote the
[4:00] Philistine and slew him and there was a
[4:03] no sword in the hand of David he'd had

[4:34] sheath thereof and slew him and cut his
[4:37] off his head therewith and and when the
[4:39] Philistines saw their champion was dead
[4:42] they fled now finally to church they had
[4:46] to see the head rolling even though he

[11:39] beloved when I give all diligence to
[11:41] write unto you of the common salvation
[11:43] it was not needful for me to write unto
[11:47] you and exhort you that you should
[11:49] earnestly it was needful rather for me
[11:54] to write unto you and exhort you in my
[11:56] eyes I can't see too good that you
[11:58] should earnestly contend for the faith
[12:01] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[12:04] now when was the faith and what is it
[12:07] and when was it delivered okay we'll
[12:10] find out amen kind of give a background
[12:13] here I don't know what the Lord won't
[12:14] have me do
[12:15] contending for the faith in Zurich
[12:17] Switzerland 1955 6:20 now when the faith
[12:22] was first introduced to the world the
[12:25] faith that were earnest to earnestly
[12:28] contend for John the Baptist introduce
[12:30] it now preach on this 1992 some of you
[12:33] may remember it contending for the faith
[12:36] restored back by Malachi 4 may be
[12:39] remembered in June maybe you don't a man
[12:42] he to earth to contend for John the
[12:46] Baptist introduced it he introduced
[12:48] Jesus to the world and Jesus introduced
[12:51] the faith now let's go back and see what
[12:54] faith he introduced to the world and
[12:57] then we'll see what we're talking about
[12:59] now he did not claim to be a healer if
[13:02] Jesus did not claim to be a healer then
[13:04] how can some man claim to be a healer
[13:06] when Jesus was questioned he said it's
[13:09] not me to do it the works but my father
[13:10] that dwelleth in me
[13:13] the man that the healer is garnet wells
[13:16] in the man hey man praise God

[13:29] it's not me and do it the works but my
[13:32] father told them me may be seated so he
[13:34] has nothing to do with it it was God the
[13:36] Father in him that did the work when he
[13:38] was baptized with water by John they
[13:41] bear record that God coming like a dove
[13:45] and going in him then when Jesus went
[13:48] forth to preach great crowds come to him
[13:51] he began to work miracles among them his
[13:54] fame went way abroad that's when he said
[13:57] it's not me but the Father that doeth
[13:59] the works so they are so therefore John
[14:02] the Baptist introduced it then Jesus did
[14:04] the works of his father and then he
[14:06] introduced Jesus to the world and Jesus
[14:09] introduced the faith the faith amen now

[20:51] now I have begin to think this that it
[20:54] is possible they went a man like the
[20:57] Apostles and when you can live so close
[20:59] to God and God through His grace
[21:02] operates through you that the more God
[21:05] you get the more godly you become the
[21:08] more eternal life comes in the more of
[21:11] the intellection it pushes out don't
[21:13] more consecrated the more praying a man
[21:18] the more preparation the more God comes
[21:20] in praise God and watch I've seen the
[21:28] work and to think that if you get in
[21:30] contact with God it becomes too it isn't
[21:34] your voice anymore it's not your thought
[21:37] anymore it becomes God's thought and
[21:39] God's voice you're just a vane just a
[21:43] pretty severe and it's his spirit that
[21:45] goes in and energizes as long as you can
[21:48] get yourself out of the way he will fill
[21:51] it up and then you will be a witness
[21:53] like Noah's Ark was a witness
[21:55] Jesus was a witness the very expression
[21:58] he becomes so full of God till God him
[22:02] and God was one amen Jonathan yes sir
[22:05] God taught in Christ reconciling the
[22:07] world to himself the very expression a
[22:09] man's work declares his character Christ
[22:11] was God's work and Christ
[22:14] now it's character his feeling for the
[22:16] sick he's longing to save souls until he
[22:19] gave his own life God's work God's
[22:21] character was declared in Christ and I'm
[22:24] telling you today that God's life amen
[22:26] God's work will be declared in this
[22:29] church here
[22:30] hallelujah somebody's gonna come for
[22:32] somebody's gonna be sealed
[22:34] sometimes gonna be healed hallelujah
[22:36] glory to God amen
[22:41] once more the world will hear direct
[22:44] from God's voice in you the brand why it
[22:50] is not your thought anymore it becomes
[22:53] God's thought amen and God's voice then

[23:49] God in this ungodly wicked and
[23:52] adulterous generation a man

[53:33] off your high horse on a road to
[53:35] Damascus God knocked Paul off his high
[53:38] horse and we need to knock it off on a
[53:40] high horses and hit the dust and the
[53:42] moment you raise your hand above your

[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] yes sir glory to God
[53:57] hey man well accompany something a wild
[54:00] man I am a while man spiritually being a
[54:04] crazy
[54:04] praise cut there man when I worship God
[54:09] in a way called heresy against a bunch
[54:12] of church members oh okay maybe see that
[54:18] seem to say a man oh man oh man oh man
[54:22] oh man
[54:29] our men rekon okay Moses after he was
[54:36] brought to the place where he was
[54:37] anointed I'm trying to get you to now
[54:39] and notice the seal in there with the
[54:43] intellectual conception with all the
[54:47] faith that he was born to deliver the
[54:49] people and he had never come to life
[54:51] until that light from the burning bush
[54:54] flashed across until he's seen not
[54:58] something he read about but something
[55:00] he's seen with his eyes something that
[55:03] spoke to him and he spoke back to it
[55:06] oh how that did bring things to laugh oh
[55:11] you mean if something happens when it
[55:15] speaks to me and I can speak back to him
[55:19] then that's when I get the anointing
[55:23] oh I see whatever the Prophet said I
[55:28] think any man woman boy or girl and I
[55:33] think in the intellectual conception of
[55:36] what they think the word is that's what
[55:40] my interesting what you think
[55:41] give me Bible give me a Bible give me a
[55:45] quote not what you feel in your mind I'm
[55:48] not interesting that at all I don't even
[55:50] listen to it
[55:51] well brother come on I feel it and then
[55:53] I'm gone right there when you feel I'm
[55:55] gone I know who the devil's talking
[55:58] right through your mind
[55:58] praise God yes sir brother amen I feel I
[56:04] feel it brother
[56:07] I want something to talk back to me amen
[56:09] and what they think the word is and so
[56:12] forth never can have a full foundation
[56:15] stand until they have met that light
[56:18] that brings that word to a reality so
[56:24] stay there until you meet that light
[56:28] I think no church in its practice no
[56:31] matter how intellectual and fundamental
[56:34] it might be in this message or whatever
[56:36] that church cannot thrive until the
[56:40] supernatural is made known among that
[56:42] people and they see it something that
[56:45] they can talk to that a talk back to
[56:48] them that have indicates this written
[56:50] word oh he goes on say just as we know
[57:01] now a man asks for a few moments about
[57:02] coming of the rapture and we know we
[57:05] lived him and we know amen then we would
[57:11] we live the time out the time of the
[57:13] ranch's at hand
[57:14] and we're looking for a rapt in faith
[57:16] that can pull the churches together and
[57:18] give us some supernatural strength that
[57:21] could change these bodies that we live
[57:22] in we see a God that raised the dead off
[57:25] the floor and he did brother Perez and
[57:28] brother Ortiz

[1:07:50] God so seven seals seven thunders

[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:04] so this message here today it had only
[1:08:08] the faith that was in Moses and anoints
[1:08:11] us when we see that we live in the land
[1:08:14] deniz we see it to find out that all
[1:08:18] these signs that we see being taking
[1:08:20] place there spoke of in the scripture
[1:08:23] would take place in the last days all
[1:08:25] the way from heaven to the political
[1:08:27] powers to nature the people the Demark
[1:08:30] the demodulation the demoralization of
[1:08:34] the world and among the the women in

[1:08:42] would do how God would do and we see it
[1:08:45] or laying right here on us
[1:08:47] although you know it and why would you
[1:08:50] go in the world amen oh it annoys our
[1:08:55] faith it moves us out of the great
[1:08:58] cycles on a third phase we dedicate
[1:09:03] consecrate it moves us out Chuck Lorre
[1:09:08] to cut it separates us from the things
[1:09:12] of the world no matter how little we are
[1:09:15] how much of minority we are how much we
[1:09:19] laugh that made fun oh don't make a bit
[1:09:22] of difference that's all we see it
[1:09:24] there's something within us as brother
[1:09:28] been saying we were predestined needed
[1:09:31] to see this hour and there's nothing
[1:09:34] going to stop us from seeing it amen
[1:09:37] sure God has spoken
[1:09:39] it's already happened we see it or how
[1:09:43] we thank God for this Oh then it brings
[1:09:46] out your faith when you see when we see
[1:09:50] these things happening
[1:09:52] oh my speak to the people that move
[1:09:58] forward oh we could let the Holy Spirit
[1:10:01] charity it maybe see the anoint that
[1:10:04] seven thunders see within us aiming at
[1:10:07] faith see the faith see to a godly life
[1:10:11] consecrated dedicated to Christ in all
[1:10:14] things so completely surrender to God
[1:10:19] yes I speak it because it's a promise of
[1:10:23] the Brian dynamic tower mechanics gives
[1:10:26] us seventh on the charity of knowing the
[1:10:28] faith to move forward do you see it

[1:10:39] okay now I page 30 I hope this goes in
[1:10:44] faith doesn't look at the present time
[1:10:46] faith doesn't see this here faith does
[1:10:49] not look at your condition I don't have
[1:10:51] the Holy Ghost I need to get healed that
[1:10:53] faith don't look at that so it does not
[1:10:57] dwell in present conditions not faith
[1:11:02] now faith is the things that the
[1:11:06] evidence in substance amen
[1:11:10] our faith doesn't look at the present
[1:11:12] tense present time faith doesn't see
[1:11:15] this here faith looks to see what God
[1:11:19] wants and works accordingly
[1:11:23] that's what faith does it sees what God
[1:11:26] wants and what God wants done and faith
[1:11:29] operates through that so I had to preach
[1:11:33] through Jacob grants Joseph's affection

[1:12:12] it works accordingly that's what faith
[1:12:14] does it sees what God wants and what God
[1:12:16] wants done and faith operates through
[1:12:18] that faith is a long-range vision do you

[1:18:41] challenge these intellectual Giants and
[1:18:45] the Phyllis and demon powers in the
[1:18:47] people hallelujah glory
[1:18:54] so that situation that David faced
[1:18:56] Goliath represented intellectual head
[1:19:00] knowledge we're tall above everybody
[1:19:04] huge giant big powerful in the word in
[1:19:08] the quotes know everything
[1:19:11] praise God a man in the Phyllis and was

[1:19:44] I tell you there's one here today my god
[1:19:47] I reach into your closet and pulled
[1:19:49] every Philistine out of there
[1:19:52] hey man and there was Goliath binding
[1:19:57] Israel God's people their king their
[1:20:00] army will bound it seemed like they was
[1:20:05] not convinced look like Saul and the
[1:20:08] Army in Israel were not convinced by
[1:20:11] present tense revelation that God was
[1:20:15] with them well why was he shaking if
[1:20:19] they knew that God was there
[1:20:21] they knew that God across the Red Sea
[1:20:23] open a seal they know what Moses did
[1:20:26] down in Egypt they do that and it had
[1:20:29] all the promise of what God was going to
[1:20:31] do huh
[1:20:33] amen well then why couldn't God the same
[1:20:36] when they open the Red Sea up same one
[1:20:38] that's gonna put him over here in New
[1:20:39] Jerusalem I like this here all these
[1:20:41] promises here why couldn't he a killer
[1:20:44] with a lightning Thunderbolt and kill
[1:20:46] the Giant
[1:20:47] why didn't they pray what why don't you
[1:20:50] pray huh why don't you talk to God huh
[1:20:55] what are you running for what are you
[1:20:57] fearful for huh
[1:21:04] all same thing today the bride is not
[1:21:08] sure or convinced that Malachi 4 has
[1:21:12] revealed all seven seals seven Thunder
[1:21:15] mysteries therefore not being convinced
[1:21:18] then they cannot be concerned because if
[1:21:22] they ever really be convinced that
[1:21:24] Malacca has restored back the faith then
[1:21:28] you become concerned about getting
[1:21:31] yourself in order and getting your
[1:21:34] family safe knowing that he's the same
[1:21:37] yesterday today and forever so when you
[1:21:44] see somebody backsliding around here
[1:21:46] they are not convinced that God even
[1:21:49] sent a prophet they're not convinced of
[1:21:52] the message or nothing that's what I do
[1:21:54] what they're doing
[1:21:54] amen if we are convinced that Jesus is
[1:21:58] coming soon we'll be concerned about
[1:22:01] getting desperate to receive the Holy
[1:22:04] Ghost then go after the lost sheep and
[1:22:07] our families will get out of this swamp
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:13] if we are convinced that malachi for
[1:22:15] have to store back deep-v faith then we
[1:22:18] will become concerned to follow Malachi
[1:22:21] 4 and say what he said every promise the
[1:22:25] reveal word now listen
[1:22:26] God will be concerned to take care of
[1:22:32] you with his word that is in you in the
[1:22:36] season end of time but you're not good
[1:22:39] you're not sure you're not convinced
[1:22:41] that he's really in you that's your
[1:22:43] problem
[1:22:44] amen well then who brought you here
[1:22:48] who made you who created you and what
[1:22:52] are you doing here anyway how you get in
[1:22:54] here
[1:22:55] alright so you're not sure where the guy
[1:23:00] will keep us word but my words shall not
[1:23:03] return to me boy God keeps his word
[1:23:05] every word that he said he will keep it
[1:23:08] God cannot lie on some one thing about
[1:23:11] it he cannot do it and there's where
[1:23:13] David stood for God he was convinced
[1:23:15] that the God of Israel that could defeat
[1:23:18] the Philistines then he became concerned
[1:23:21] he was then concerned about his brethren
[1:23:23] and Israel though he stood alone with
[1:23:26] his revelation on Hebrews 13:8 if you
[1:23:28] believed in the God that could deliver
[1:23:30] before and after but David believed in
[1:23:33] the present tense God
[1:23:35] the Hebrews 13:8 god of now faith is
[1:23:39] that revelation was the difference
[1:23:41] between David and Saul in Israel and so
[1:23:45] is it today in this message that is that
[1:23:49] is what separates us is seven thunders
[1:23:52] gift faint separates us in the message
[1:23:55] because they're looking for something
[1:23:56] else to come back because Malachi Ford
[1:23:59] didn't do the job but we say he did the
[1:24:01] job
[1:24:03] hey man oh my so God has his David
[1:24:09] ministry who still believe his Hebrews
[1:24:11] 13:8 and have proved it for last 22
[1:24:14] years amen
[1:24:16] David was concerned about getting this
[1:24:18] revelation out to the rest of Israel so
[1:24:21] therefore when David before he got to he
[1:24:23] said what's going on here and they began
[1:24:25] to rehearse the David it said now David
[1:24:28] Saul whoever will fight this man he'll
[1:24:30] give you riches and he'll give you his
[1:24:33] daughter amen and he'll give you a great
[1:24:37] big white house up on a hill make you
[1:24:39] very popular your family I don't want
[1:24:41] money
[1:24:42] I don't want women I don't want
[1:24:44] popularity I'm here for the honor and
[1:24:46] glory of God
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:50] there's your three things leaning in the
[1:24:53] David ministry Amy soul excuse me
[1:24:59] he was concerned about getting it out so
[1:25:01] therefore David beginning to preach my
[1:25:04] god he had a revelation and they got all
[1:25:07] excited he got anointed brother fury and
[1:25:09] I ran and told Saul and Saul say what
[1:25:12] somebody gonna face it praise God let's
[1:25:18] go forward speak and let's go forward
[1:25:22] we're not here to defend anything God
[1:25:24] don't need no defense from you and me
[1:25:27] hallelujah but he wants you to attack
[1:25:31] attack the promises
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:37] not sit around moping around a man Omaha
[1:25:45] and Goliath presented himself every
[1:25:49] morning every evening laughing great big
[1:25:51] fella
[1:25:51] you wouldn't do to people the same size
[1:25:53] oh yeah
[1:25:55] five guys will jump on one guy and they
[1:25:58] bad it tough look one on one no you can
[1:26:01] see that oh that's right that's right so
[1:26:04] he presented himself morning and night
[1:26:06] Here I am
[1:26:08] what dog is gonna come in and fight me
[1:26:10] huh and they're gonna live resent
[1:26:13] himself there what a testing time for
[1:26:16] Israel here comes David so he gave his
[1:26:19] revelation out and song got a hold of
[1:26:21] him he said he's I can't use your helmet
[1:26:23] sir Majesty sir he said oh how you gonna
[1:26:26] do this hear what David had a secret and
[1:26:29] he comes up there may be seated
[1:26:31] and because of they and all them in
[1:26:35] Israel many just said be sure but she
[1:26:38] received three things but in Davis said
[1:26:41] the King will Richard so for Davis said
[1:26:43] for who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:26:46] that he should defy the arms the Living
[1:26:48] God then his brothers chided him why
[1:26:51] come here with you left sheet and so
[1:26:55] forth I'm not a pride nor dienes and so
[1:26:57] forth so then Davis says what have I
[1:26:59] done is another cause then David began
[1:27:01] to preach my revelation to the people
[1:27:03] that God is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:05] forever
[1:27:06] it began a piece of about 22 years
[1:27:07] preaching away others has joined him
[1:27:10] Amen he was preaching away
[1:27:12] praise God he's the same he'll give me
[1:27:13] the Holy Ghost you shall be sealed
[1:27:15] you should happy he'll and same God yes
[1:27:18] the same one that with Malik had for
[1:27:20] saying I want to be here today
[1:27:22] same one the cancer Devils out and
[1:27:24] discerned behind them your name I see
[1:27:27] your name held a light went over there
[1:27:29] mr. hunt you pray for your sister Asma
[1:27:33] amen as your friend brother Coleman that
[1:27:36] same guys coming back him he's praying
[1:27:39] for his father there's dust saith the
[1:27:41] Lord
[1:27:42] now what's going to change me from that
[1:27:44] huh God speaking through the prophet
[1:27:47] dust at the Lord and I should knuckle
[1:27:49] down to some spirits in here awesome
[1:27:51] ministers hope god forbid praise God
[1:28:02] not without some unbelief no way Jose
[1:28:07] I mean praise God a man no way yes sir
[1:28:12] hallelujah Amen Alleluia praise God
[1:28:16] oh my and David's revelation cut back to
[1:28:21] saw or Canaan David knew he was anointed
[1:28:24] he but his head the thing he knew there
[1:28:27] was Annie and that's why he went anybody
[1:28:31] back in 74 you knew it was a need with
[1:28:34] nothing going on no where there was a
[1:28:36] need he knew he was already anointed he
[1:28:42] knew that the supernatural of God was
[1:28:44] with him and his church so he related to
[1:28:52] solve the many supernatural things God
[1:28:54] did for him
[1:28:54] David was convinced that God was with
[1:28:57] him so he was very concerned about his
[1:28:59] brethren he heard Malachi fourth message
[1:29:02] of I will restore saith the Lord David
[1:29:06] heard that a man he knew that he was
[1:29:09] predestinated to stand because he was
[1:29:11] convinced and concern amen and Davis
[1:29:14] heart was concerned with God's honor
[1:29:16] rather than the announcement amen rather
[1:29:20] than the advancement his own riches and
[1:29:22] money and so forth so on trying to get
[1:29:24] to us about here and now Davis thought
[1:29:27] was who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:29:29] that he should defy the armies of living
[1:29:32] God and that's my thought for all these
[1:29:34] years
[1:29:34] who are these devils come into this
[1:29:36] God's church and sitting there won't
[1:29:38] praise God
[1:29:39] are these uncircumcised philistine doing
[1:29:42] in the house of God what are you doing
[1:29:45] here
[1:29:47] I'm concerned about God's house God
[1:29:51] seeks worship and those that all worship
[1:29:54] God what are you doing here
[1:29:56] you uncircumcised philistine don't wanna
[1:29:59] praise God and you see your name in that
[1:30:01] book you praise God
[1:30:02] everything in heaven on earth Pernod
[1:30:05] john prescott hallelujah glory to god
[1:30:11] Oh hallelujah glory to God
[1:30:15] now hey man
[1:30:18] that's why I challenge these spirits in
[1:30:20] here hey who are you anyway
[1:30:24] now watch may be seated when his ability
[1:30:28] was questioned when they questioned Saul
[1:30:31] questions ability is it worth he was
[1:30:34] able to tell of his supernatural
[1:30:36] experience of his first and second phase
[1:30:39] you get it huh now a great secret comes
[1:30:43] out of his life interview naman he said
[1:30:47] what so the Lord that they let me out of
[1:30:51] the paw of the lion hmmm
[1:30:54] and my second phase and took me out of
[1:30:58] the paw of the bear that's two twice now
[1:31:02] here's the third phase he will deliver
[1:31:05] me out of the hand of this uncircumcised
[1:31:07] philistine on the third phase his head
[1:31:10] knowledge that has me bound down
[1:31:15] that God is able to deliver a minosa
[1:31:26] yes sir
[1:31:29] his confidence was in a supernatural God
[1:31:32] and not in his own ability
[1:31:33] there's your Davis today is another
[1:31:35] cause Saul in Israel frozen with fear
[1:31:38] Goliath head knowledge and intellectual
[1:31:41] conception of the message holding down
[1:31:43] the bride with six seals the seven seals
[1:31:46] not open Philistines second Timothy
[1:31:48] demons members in the church message
[1:31:51] frighten against the revelation but be
[1:31:53] convinced like David was Amen
[1:31:55] so David by revelation challenge to
[1:31:58] Goliath he didn't wait now comes to me
[1:32:04] in with a sword of spear and with a
[1:32:06] shield when I come to thee in the name
[1:32:08] of the Lord of Hosts the army look the
[1:32:11] god of the armies of Israel whom thou
[1:32:13] has defy who are these devils that come
[1:32:16] in and sit down in here and define the
[1:32:19] outpouring of the holy spirit define
[1:32:21] this and they fire then
[1:32:23] who are you anyway praise God this day I
[1:32:26] will cut your head off you dog praise
[1:32:28] cut hallelujah
[1:32:31] look going who are you anyway
[1:32:36] will you come from this Satan scour
[1:32:39] cross the city and bring you in here
[1:32:41] or will you protest lately elected from
[1:32:43] the foundation were to be in here well
[1:32:46] that's who I'm talking to those are the
[1:32:48] elected those that God foreknew color
[1:32:51] when there was nothing no air no atoms
[1:32:54] no nothing just the Great Spirit in his
[1:32:56] mind those are the seeds that I'm
[1:32:58] speaking to and not to these
[1:33:00] uncircumcised philistine
[1:33:04] yes sir
[1:33:07] so therefore David 1746 had to put to
[1:33:12] predict his third phase are you picking
[1:33:16] me up
[1:33:16] February 9th February 16 there were 23 I
[1:33:20] had you picked me up on the third phase
[1:33:23] what am i doing
[1:33:25] predicting you and you're living right
[1:33:31] under it great right under the
[1:33:34] prediction of it
[1:33:35] so David predicted his third phase this
[1:33:38] day is spoken well I don't shut up this
[1:33:45] day well I don't feel shut up I don't
[1:33:51] see shut up this day will the Lord
[1:33:57] deliver thee into mine hand that's why I
[1:34:03] can speak for my family
[1:34:07] this thing you philistine give me back
[1:34:12] my family
[1:34:13] the law will deliver them to my hand and
[1:34:16] I will smite thee and take learn hid
[1:34:21] from thee and give carcasses of the host
[1:34:25] of the fiddle signs this day and to the
[1:34:27] fowls of the air and the wild beasts of
[1:34:29] the earth and that all the or why why
[1:34:34] the stern face here at all on earth may
[1:34:36] know that these that there is a God in
[1:34:39] Israel why the third face that all the
[1:34:43] message might know that indeed malachi
[1:34:46] aforesaid seven thunders give faith four
[1:34:49] wraps and grace indeed will charity pour
[1:34:53] out upon you my god praise God to let
[1:34:57] the world know that this is what the
[1:34:59] prophets said and God's gonna pour out
[1:35:02] and vindicated Oh hallelujah let me get
[1:35:04] out of here praise God glory to God and
[1:35:08] all the message shall know that the Lord
[1:35:11] save it not with sword and spear and
[1:35:14] quotes and quotes in the quotes
[1:35:16] hallelujah for the battle is the Lord's
[1:35:18] on the third phase I did my fighting I
[1:35:22] did my pressing but Lord gave me some
[1:35:25] power down that those that are yet to
[1:35:27] come
[1:35:28] huh that they may know so lord send the
[1:35:32] power just now
[1:35:34] all lots and the power just now Oh Lord
[1:35:39] send power just now
[1:35:42] Oh lots in the palace now and baptize
[1:35:47] everyone that is a reality don't you
[1:35:51] ever forget it
[1:35:52] hallelujah so here we go it's the Lord's
[1:35:56] battle on the 35th we believe that now
[1:35:58] who is the Lord Jesus Christ okay so
[1:36:02] David thought it he expressed it he
[1:36:05] predicted it before it happened by
[1:36:07] revelation and it became his words

[1:36:35] revelation and became his words and
[1:36:38] David spoke the word that it would be
[1:36:41] just like his first and second phase and
[1:36:44] he went forward on his third phase to
[1:36:47] make it fulfill David Haye stood and ran

[1:37:02] let's move forward stop hanging around
[1:37:05] here praise God when you are convinced
[1:37:09] that this is a word of God then God's
[1:37:10] concern to take care of you with his
[1:37:12] word David by revelation killed Goliath
[1:37:15] had knowledge by a slingshot and a stone
[1:37:17] or rock of Revelation and took Goliath's
[1:37:20] sword and chopped off the intellectual
[1:37:22] conception of the message of Malachi for
[1:37:23] pull your swords brides of Bride of
[1:37:26] Christ and possess the gates of the
[1:37:28] enemy everyone we're gonna pick them up

[1:38:03] said we need Davis and a real David
[1:38:04] ministry today to follow Malachi for as
[1:38:07] an echo of every promise he revealed so
[1:38:11] on perfect strength probably weakness it
[1:38:14] says whoa let me tell it this way
[1:38:18] December 7 1971 I was home I was a
[1:38:21] mailman had to get up early in the
[1:38:23] morning so I had my devotion 5 to 5:30
[1:38:25] a.m. and I shared this with their
[1:38:28] officers December February 1st and I
[1:38:32] read this is the court I read I was
[1:38:34] reading a quote in 5 lakh in the morning
[1:38:36] pages turning one perfect strength by
[1:38:37] perfect weakness that's what's the
[1:38:39] matter today God's got a lot of sheep
[1:38:41] that's going astray the organization of
[1:38:43] things has stole them out brought them
[1:38:44] out into psychology God give us David's
[1:38:47] plural with the Word of God in the power
[1:38:49] God to direct it it when we go to meet
[1:38:52] these intellectual Giants right with all
[1:38:54] the PhD DeLeo and key us T's or whatever
[1:38:57] they might be
[1:38:59] give me the Word of God in the power of
[1:39:00] the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can
[1:39:03] slay a vagina on the field right we need
[1:39:05] men that can now brother branham himself
[1:39:08] said so you might have heard him when he
[1:39:10] went on the field he preached to his
[1:39:11] church what we need is a David to go out
[1:39:14] that's what he said so he went out cuz
[1:39:17] he was concerned and convinced that God
[1:39:19] was God that there would be a healing
[1:39:21] revival because the angel spoke to him
[1:39:23] so something like a talk back talk to
[1:39:26] him he talked to the ancient a need to
[1:39:28] talk to him lurid then he got his
[1:39:30] anointing then he was gifted with a
[1:39:31] divine gift to go out hey man it changed
[1:39:34] the whole world Hey
[1:39:36] and we predict in today there will be a
[1:39:38] bride paragraph 213 and we today we know
[1:39:44] we need a revival we know we are needing
[1:39:46] or need of stirring amongst the people
[1:39:48] you'll not take a dock of divinity you

[1:39:55] Slater's thing it'll bring cranks to the
[1:39:58] country let them see that he still can
[1:40:00] open the eyes of the blind heal the sick
[1:40:03] raise the dead he's God conquer a man we
[1:40:05] need a David I'm training the
[1:40:07] theological schools we need a man who
[1:40:09] knows nothing about that some little
[1:40:10] plough boy or something some little guy
[1:40:12] with his Duke show and not much to look
[1:40:14] at will come walking down the road with
[1:40:16] the power of God that's what the world
[1:40:17] needs today amen so then it and what
[1:40:20] that morning may be seated

[1:40:24] Spirit spoke back to me rock I
[1:40:25] revelation stones stones Word of God

[1:41:05] it but now this man's on Park Avenue
[1:41:08] and he said but of course the Lord could
[1:41:12] work a miracle so I knew it was God

[1:41:17] ophthalmologist so I came here to
[1:41:20] prepare the people that pray for sister
