[4:38] healing line amen
[4:40] preach to armageddon my god
[4:43] it wouldn't be left
[4:45] so the lord just was good to me saturday
[4:47] morning
[4:48] over the house there
[4:50] all turned around being remodeled and i
[4:53] went over there and he just told me to
[4:55] do this
[4:56] i wasn't thinking about this but he told
[4:58] me to do it
[4:59] so if he says do i believe be a blessing
[5:03] that's why i sing a song come and dine
[5:07] amen after these things jesus showed
[5:09] himself again to the disciples at the
[5:11] sea of tiberias
[5:13] and on this wise showed he himself
[5:17] there were together simon peter and
[5:19] thomas called didymus and nathanael of
[5:22] cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee
[5:26] and two others of his disciples
[5:28] simon peter saith unto them i go
[5:31] efficient
[5:32] they say unto him we also go with thee
[5:36] they went forth and entered into a ship
[5:39] immediately and that night they caught
[5:41] nothing
[5:42] but when the morning was now come
[5:46] amen
[5:47] jesus stood on the shore
[5:51] is that wonderful you can see him stand
[5:52] up in his puppet here this morning the
[5:54] time to pray for the sick and healing
[5:56] but to put the sick and afflicted
[5:59] amen you know everyone would be healed
[6:01] huh
[6:02] [Music]
[6:03] well that jesus is here
[6:05] [Applause]
[6:07] thou cancer believed
[6:10] stood on the shore but disciples now
[6:12] watch knew not that it was jesus
[6:16] just like but today they don't know you
[6:19] standing here then saith jesus unto them
[6:22] uh children having any meat
[6:24] they answered no and he said unto them
[6:27] cast the net on the right side of the
[6:29] ship
[6:30] and ye shall find
[6:32] the cast therefore now they were not
[6:34] able to draw it for the multitude of
[6:37] fishes
[6:38] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved
[6:41] saith unto peter it is the lord
[6:44] that eagle caught it
[6:46] amen john it is the lord
[6:49] [Applause]
[6:50] even though they were in the flesh amen
[6:54] he could still see was god
[6:57] amen
[6:59] he he girders therefore disciple whom
[7:01] jesus loves said unto peter it is the
[7:03] lord now when simon peter heard that it
[7:06] was the lord he grew his fishing coat
[7:08] about him for he was naked and did cast
[7:10] himself into the sea
[7:12] now when they say that it mean he had on
[7:14] his long johns you can't guess what i'm
[7:16] saying some people might think
[7:18] they had a long underwear and stuff amen
[7:20] and dragon
[7:22] and the other disciples came in a little
[7:24] ship for they were not far from land but
[7:27] as it was 200 cubits dragging the net
[7:31] with fishes as soon
[7:33] then as they were come to land
[7:36] they saw a fire of coals there and fish
[7:40] laid there on
[7:42] and bread
[7:43] and jesus said unto them bring of the
[7:45] fish which ye have now caught
[7:47] simon peter went up and drew the net to
[7:50] land full of great fishes
[7:52] and 153
[7:55] and for all there were so many yet was
[7:58] not the net broken
[8:00] jesus said unto them come and dine
[8:04] and that's what drew my inspiration
[8:07] and none of the disciples just asked him
[8:09] who art thou
[8:11] knowing that it was the lord
[8:13] jesus then cometh and taketh bread and
[8:15] giveth them and fish likewise
[8:18] this is now the third time
[8:21] that jesus showed himself to his
[8:23] disciples after that he was risen from
[8:25] the dead

[17:40] are you on the team
[17:44] over are you on the team over here
[17:46] amen praise god
[17:49] okay uh my inspiration is the seven
[17:52] thunders are the seven virtues of the
[17:53] seven church ages
[17:57] see i'm switching over from the last 17
[17:59] years
[18:00] i've already done that already
[18:01] identified the thunders as the voices
[18:03] amen
[18:05] from the prophet's message
[18:08] amen now i trust and pray he might let
[18:10] me freelance a little bit
[18:14] but of course it always it'll still be
[18:15] what he said
[18:17] amen just a little while and be able to
[18:20] freely just walk out about 30 40 minutes
[18:22] and bang bang bang bang bang you
[18:24] supposed to know where it come from
[18:26] knowing praise god power
[18:29] demonstration of the holy spirit praise
[18:31] god
[18:33] would that be wonderful
[18:36] amen so now this morning i believe a
[18:38] group is here
[18:39] we pray for specials
[18:41] and that's that's the right way to a
[18:43] group first alpha first and then omega
[18:45] amen
[18:46] [Music]
[18:47] so now we're to have prayer for the sick
[18:49] and the afflicted
[18:50] and according to your faith beat unto
[18:52] you
[18:53] september 20 1974 inspiration came to me
[18:56] a revelation from malachi 4's message
[18:59] now i'm still catching these uh new
[19:01] people i'm trying to finish you off by
[19:02] june 9th amen
[19:04] the seventh of the seven voices of the
[19:06] seven church ages this inspiration has
[19:08] led this church up to this very hour
[19:11] from brother brown's message
[19:13] they checked it all out and saw that
[19:15] that's what it said amen so after
[19:17] revealing the seventh under inspiration
[19:20] september 20 1974
[19:22] then he told me to preach the seventh
[19:24] under seeds from the word these would be
[19:26] seeds over the 17 years and he gave me
[19:29] saint john 20 and 21 and the old timers
[19:31] know what it is and then in 1984 i did
[19:34] it again
[19:35] to give resurrection faith and malachi 4
[19:38] restored back the resurrection faith
[19:41] and what is that that you see jesus come
[19:43] back
[19:44] and live in you
[19:46] amen and manifest himself in your church
[19:50] by the power of god making himself
[19:52] hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today
[19:54] and forever
[19:56] amen
[19:57] and the word made manifest is the gospel
[20:00] and the gospel came to us through not
[20:02] through word only but through power and
[20:04] demonstrations of the holy spirit to
[20:07] demonstrate the power and make the
[20:09] gospel live
[20:11] we have all these seeds in us but he's
[20:12] got to live
[20:14] and that's why i come back through the
[20:16] virtues
[20:17] a seventh under revelation is given to
[20:19] bring on a seventh under revival
[20:21] or seventh under manifestation
[20:24] amen how many looking for it are you on
[20:26] the team
[20:27] [Applause]
[20:29] that's what this team is looking for
[20:30] praise god
[20:31] now brother brown was set up about a
[20:33] revival five things number one bring
[20:36] souls to christ that's the main thing
[20:38] revive the church
[20:40] back into a spiritual condition to where
[20:42] it should be where it should be
[20:46] and that's why you understand now them
[20:48] seven thunders calls and energy and
[20:51] gathers together and so forth the
[20:52] prophet knew that somebody had to preach
[20:55] them seeds
[20:59] because it couldn't be no revival
[21:00] without preaching them seeds out
[21:03] because it would be years before all the
[21:05] books and tapes would get out and some
[21:06] people don't even have money to buy the
[21:08] tapes
[21:09] amen so somebody would have to start
[21:11] preaching it
[21:13] putting seeds
[21:14] in from the seventh by a seventh under
[21:18] revelation why so when the owl would
[21:21] come you could have a seventh under
[21:23] revival
[21:25] a revival of what are the seeds that's
[21:27] already in you
[21:32] see why not went forth for 17 years
[21:36] amen
[21:37] it wouldn't be a thing in new york city
[21:38] if it wasn't preached couldn't even look
[21:40] for no revival because there's no seeds
[21:41] in there
[21:42] because a revival is to revive
[21:47] revive what
[21:52] see
[21:54] you see the the revival in the ocean
[21:57] there when the water's all churning up
[21:59] and
[22:00] doing that going back and forth is
[22:02] nobody coming from the shore with the
[22:05] big trucks and things and pouring water
[22:07] into the ocean it's the water that's
[22:09] already there

[29:39] and everything at their conferences you
[29:41] know something's fixing to happen and
[29:43] that brings upon the people kind of a
[29:45] feeling that that something's fixing to
[29:47] happen what about now
[29:48] since the persian gulf war
[29:51] amen and the euphrates river drying up

[30:43] you now we're getting ready for a
[30:45] healing line
[30:46] but you know something's going on
[30:48] you see it's a different age
[30:50] amen you know when the christ went into
[30:53] the temple and and returned from 40 days
[30:56] and was for the power of god
[31:00] he was full of the spirit

[31:03] then he walked into the tabernacle
[31:06] and picked up the book
[31:09] and said the uh uh the the acceptable
[31:12] year

[31:27] then he was anointed with the message
[31:30] to preach the acceptable year of the
[31:32] lord

[34:49] they did in other days but we know that
[34:51] it's coming here even the prophet he had
[34:54] to preach the rapture
[34:56] in a specially designed restaurant where
[34:59] they were taking up the dishes and
[35:01] markers and so forth because
[35:04] peter says
[35:05] in the last days there would be markers
[35:07] and scoff and say where is the promise
[35:10] of the coming of the lord
[35:12] and brother abraham actually preached it
[35:14] in a place like that laughing joking
[35:16] pushing the dishes and so forth and he

[36:04] see that they laugh at it like in other
[36:06] days but we know it's coming there and
[36:08] that's the reason i chose today this
[36:10] subject for my last for a while for the
[36:12] tabernacle on end time evangelism and
[36:14] when we're doing mission work on foreign
[36:16] mission with the word of god we know
[36:18] that we're always in the will of god
[36:21] what you're doing overseas there in
[36:23] south africa brother coleman i'm always

[36:47] i don't know about the rest of these
[36:48] guys praise god
[36:51] hear me
[36:52] well know what i'm talking about praise

[37:24] oh
[37:24] hallelujah
[37:27] and i don't need no lesser of
[37:28] accommodation praise god
[37:31] the word is my credentials amen
[37:34] that's the reason i chopped this assault
[37:36] oh yeah amen the foreign and when we are
[37:38] doing for a mission make a foreign
[37:41] mission with the word of god i went with
[37:43] the word to quotes what the prophet said
[37:46] with the word of god we know we always
[37:50] in the will of god
[37:52] because jesus first commissioned to his
[37:53] church was to go out and preach the
[37:55] gospel this last commission was to
[37:58] preach the gospel the first time he ever
[38:00] ordained any person to preach the word
[38:02] and go throughout the country he said
[38:04] heal the sick and raise the dead cast
[38:06] out devils as freely as you have
[38:08] received freely give saint matthew 10th
[38:11] chapter descending out to 72 by two amen
[38:14] that was the first commission he gave to
[38:16] his church
[38:18] and so you couldn't go out like that
[38:20] because there was too much unbelief but
[38:21] they didn't even know what brother
[38:22] bran's message was
[38:24] so you had to go out to identify the
[38:26] message for about 17 years
[38:28] now we talk about power
[38:32] signs ones and miracles to vindicate
[38:35] oh hallelujah praise god
[38:38] so far over top of their heads they
[38:40] don't even know what's even going on
[38:42] amen see they don't know the message
[38:44] amen
[38:45] now the last commission he gave to his
[38:47] church just before he was received into
[38:49] glory amen he said go into all the world
[38:52] he had just risen from the dead and many
[38:55] of them were sitting together and he
[38:57] upgraded them that's saint mark 16 14
[39:01] there he upgraded them
[39:04] of the hardness of their heart because
[39:06] of their unbelief
[39:08] that believed not them
[39:10] that had seen him after he was risen
[39:15] amen i saw him in 1974 come back
[39:19] after
[39:20] he left with the prophet
[39:23] i gave my testimony i saw him
[39:28] faith
[39:30] amen
[39:32] see they had a testimony that they had
[39:36] seen the lord
[39:37] and the others didn't believe it and he
[39:40] upgraded them because of the hardness of
[39:42] their heart
[39:44] they didn't believe these people who
[39:46] have seen that he was not dead
[39:50] god's not dead he is alive
[39:54] [Applause]
[39:56] oh hallelujah praise god we even sang it
[39:59] in testimony
[40:03] yes sir
[40:05] same thing today

[40:38] coming
[40:39] and what would his message be in a bride
[40:43] a sign
[40:44] of his resurrection at hand
[40:47] because they're all full of charity
[40:49] token being displayed
[40:52] signs one's america's following them

[41:52] and put it in human arizona and make
[41:54] them people
[41:56] make all kind of noise and while the
[41:58] prophet was preaching then the same god

[42:18] yes sir
[42:20] amen and you get there now in the form
[42:22] of the holy spirit showing that it's him

[42:25] that you see the holy spirit doing so
[42:27] that's the appearing of the lord you get
[42:30] it now the holy spirit is appearing of

[42:49] oh
[42:50] my
[42:52] that's the holy spirit that's been
[42:53] appearing since 1946
[42:56] when he appeared to the prophet as an
[42:58] angel form
[43:00] and appeared with the prophet and his
[43:02] first pull and second pull
[43:04] appeared with the prophet as son of man
[43:08] and his third pull to reveal the word
[43:11] [Applause]
[43:13] and then begin to call out a bride for
[43:16] 25 years
[43:19] and i believe she's called out now
[43:21] and kept that message alive for 28 years
[43:24] from february 63
[43:26] and immediately the wave sheath
[43:29] of some have compassion ministry of the
[43:31] morning star
[43:34] amen praise god
[43:37] hallelujah
[43:39] oh
[43:40] hallelujah praise god
[43:44] yes siree
[43:46] oh
[43:47] my
[43:49] yes sir
[43:50] i think uh
[43:52] there's more getting on the team
[43:55] am i
[43:57] getting some more
[43:58] members for the team
[44:00] yes sir
[44:03] now today we try to take the written
[44:05] word we have in letter form creed form
[44:09] and so forth to all the world
[44:11] and there's been missionaries going
[44:13] everywhere but what do we find when we
[44:15] get there a native that can't read his
[44:18] name holding a track in his hand he
[44:20] knows no more about it than he does
[44:22] which is right and left hand but when
[44:24] jesus said go and preach the gospel he
[44:27] never said teach the word he said preach
[44:30] the gospel and the gospel came not in
[44:32] word only but through the manifestation
[44:35] of the word
[44:37] for the only way that it could be done
[44:39] was to make his promise come to pass
[44:42] well then if he said seven thunders give
[44:44] faith in the bride revival well why not
[44:46] preach it
[44:50] not preach it to make it come to pass
[44:51] it's a promise
[44:53] instead of give you faith for rapture
[44:54] and grace we'll preach it
[44:56] ain't nothing else you want to find for
[44:58] 17 years you found that out praise god
[45:00] nothing else there
[45:02] [Applause]
[45:03] praise god anything else there brother
[45:06] amen oh my the gospel came nothing word
[45:09] only
[45:10] just in the books and so forth mechanics
[45:12] but there's some dynamics to it praise
[45:14] god
[45:16] through the manifestation of the word
[45:18] for only the way that could be done was
[45:20] to make his promise come to pass so is
[45:22] it today his promise of the word seven
[45:25] thunders must be number one first spoken
[45:28] as seeds
[45:30] number two then in the dynamic season
[45:33] he can revive these seeds
[45:37] [Applause]
[45:38] oh and you people sitting around here
[45:40] dead don't almost even going on they had
[45:42] only known the message
[45:45] yes siree
[45:47] amen
[45:49] then in the dynamic season he can revive
[45:52] these seeds
[45:54] thereby bringing the word
[45:56] through power
[45:58] and demonstration of the holy spirit
[46:01] making him hebrews 13 8
[46:03] god's trying to get you ready for that
[46:05] prayer line
[46:07] amen brother bob

[46:12] line

[1:33:34] the shore
[1:33:35] in saint john 21 6
[1:33:38] in christ standing there now christ was
[1:33:40] ready to show them how to fish

[1:33:58] not behind them or in front of them on
[1:34:00] the left you don't put it on the right
[1:34:02] and the word will tell you in your life
[1:34:04] what to do
[1:34:06] the word amen
[1:34:07] yes sir on the right side
[1:34:09] yes siree and you shall and ye shall

[1:34:31] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:34:33] shall you do also

[1:34:47] to the eagle john that it was jesus

[1:34:53] what i'm trying to tell them today
[1:34:57] the eagles here will say i want to be on
[1:34:59] that team
[1:35:01] it is the lord's team
[1:35:04] i don't care about all of us television

[1:35:18] tell them today there's a revival going
[1:35:20] on john said it is the lord and peter's
[1:35:23] mind must have flashed back to when he
[1:35:25] was trying to fish and fish to all night
[1:35:28] and caught nothing
[1:35:30] and the lord said launch me out here
[1:35:32] amen praise god but never mind what
[1:35:34] you're trying to do but bring that word
[1:35:36] first
[1:35:37] launch me out push him out so far then

[1:35:49] and they couldn't even pull the thing
[1:35:51] full of fishes
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:53] but what happened the word went forth
[1:35:55] first
[1:35:59] then you'll get all what you want
[1:36:02] but don't try to slip on the ends and
[1:36:04] sneak over there and try to do some
[1:36:06] self-will
[1:36:08] lord thy will be done
[1:36:11] amen maybe
[1:36:13] peter was not conscious of being out of
[1:36:15] the will of god by going fishing after
[1:36:16] two appearances of jesus doing a great
[1:36:18] revival see other words of doing your
[1:36:21] own thing and just coming to church to
