charity and i have a subject um charity anointed seven virtues for a manifestation of the seven thunders amen understanding what thou hear us [Music] now we anointed now right amen [Applause] april 2 april 6th i've been very strange season been sick and weary and then uh remodeling my house and my wife and i have been staying over to jonathan's house for almost two months now just back and forth and so much stress and everything and remodeling and going back and forth and very tired and no time to study or whatever and didn't exactly know what i was going to do and but uh on april 4th the lord spoke to me and um and told me gave me the message then came jesus after easter and then i still didn't know what i was doing just moving by faith in april the sixth on saturday uh he spoke to me twice in the morning the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church ages and then it came in my heart i said well now i know that i said well what uh does that does it mean something else and then he says and to brotherly kindness add charity for june 9th and i said well that's what he told me so i didn't know what it meant so uh i believe on one of the messages to know him from the beginning i just said those words i say i'm saying for purpose i was still looking for the inspiration myself amen sitting on june 9th 1974 uh brotherly kindness was birthed into us or from the message and of some have compassion and from june 9 1974 to june 9th today 1991 to 17 years and on june 1st just a week or so ago um i was wondering um what was i supposed to do oh i know what i left something out on may was it may 11th i just still didn't know what i was well supposed to preach and saturday morning he told me temperance and he showed me i had some notes there and immediately i knew i had to preach patience and godliness but i couldn't figure out where was i supposed to preach godliness at because he had already told me from the 28th of april to june 16th that brother of blade and i was supposed to share eight sundays to set the captive free be a jubilee for 50 days so i'm hoping that some are going free that's what he told me amen that people would go free and so then he did that then he later he tells me on june 1st uh um you know he told me that uh uh that i had to speak on temperance and patience i couldn't figure out where godliness then he told me on wednesday june 5th so then on june 1st i was just meditating like and the holy spirit spoke to me and told me to add another message i said add another message and then uh i said well i didn't think i had to go any further than faith on easter and then came jesus virtue and then april 28 knowledge to know him from the beginning so i thought i was finished preaching on the virtues with faith virtue and knowledge and then on may 11th and that's what he told me preaching on temperance come and dying so instantly i knew i had to preach on patience and godliness and june 9th he'd already told me on april the 6th to believe kindness their charity so june 1st he spoke again and said add another message i said add another message now i can hardly preach on wednesday and then he spoke back and says from the scripture into godliness brotherly kindness he says separated you always preach the to brotherly kindness at charity two or three times maybe and he says but that's to be separate so preach on broadly kindness friday and i did amen how i got in here i don't know but uh i made it then i had to to today get inspiration for the day which he'd already told me and he said just change a little bit into belly kindness charity just the way it says in the scripture so that's what i'm doing this morning amen soul and to brother uh into godliness brother kindness and to bloody kindness charity so he says separated and make these two messages thus making me preach eight virtues amen and then going from april to seven virtue to charity today so here we are so i had to preach wednesday and friday night to finish my course on june 7th amen i was finished brotherly kindness well praise god it's been a tremendous 17 years trying to take these promises praise god and so dave today is june 9th and i'm just supposed to preach on charity and you don't have to get all stiff and wonder what's going to happen because it never comes that way so you might as well enter in like you did wednesday and friday don't sit and try to squeeze and wonder what's going to happen how is it going to happen and when is it going to happen and will it happen to me and how will i get it and on and on and on and on and on just a time and enter into the anointing say thank you lord praise god but don't go there stay away from here because i don't even know myself so amen so amen i do not know i've been going by inspiration amen so i preached the seventh virtue june 7. you may be seated and to godliness really kindness in the 17 years on june 7 preaching on the seven thousands of the seven voices seven church ages seven virtues brotherly kindness adoption perfection promises etc etc etc all promises that uh were supposed to keep you alive amen 25 years of soul praise god and then mainly the last 17 years and then the april inspiration speaking two times the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church he did not explain this statement to me and i still don't quite know what he mean because i know what it means but what does he mean for it now i don't know hey i hope he'll show me today praise god amen so maybe i will find out today why that was spoken to me praise god the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church ages after this day i hope to get a little rest and then get some inspiration for making georgia so you pray for me huh but it's been very hot rough i'm kind of favored my sign here and just totally blown out amen but i had to do this here and then um the last three and a half years from 1988 june 3rd low here received from you has been harder trials than the other part so for three and a half years to june that's three and a half years of harder trials that i had to go through sick and weary and diabetes and everything else but i made it to june 7 amen by the grace of god so we go to the eighth message i never did this before i don't think i remember 1974 i preached the capstone of love amen so but i didn't preach directly on charity this is the first time i believe i'm doing this amen all eight together praise god so we go to the eighth message i believe this is the first time doing it this way and to brotherly kindness charity now remember amen charity never faileth everything else will fail the world will fail the country will fail the president's kings and potentiates all man will fail a many of friends and family everybody will fail but charity never faileth amen praise god thank you jesus [Music] amen you may be seated now charity we talking about not just a charity the the uh some kind of society and give you a good will and give you some clothes and so forth like that and old shoes we're not talking about that kind of charity amen we talk about divine love agapo love amen it is spontaneous and divine love now there's nine ingredients are picked out of here first corinthians 13 of divine love and it's right in the scriptures here a patience this is love passive uh no hurry uh suffers long beers and believes and hopes and endures all things you find that in verse four and verse seven kindness number two love and action praise god never acts racially or incidentally amen not inconsistent or puffed up or proud praise god you find that in verse four number three generosity love and competition amen not envious or jealous verse four number four humility love in hiding not running around you know no parade i'm a christian no ears works does this thing and then retires out of the way gets off the scene after doing his good works drops the food off it and goes doesn't stand around for how you like that how's it taste no it's gone praise god it's not looking for medals or amen for merit amen did you get me i had to drop over the natural for you pick me up amen praise god number five courtesy love in society courteous does not behave unseemly always polite don't push and shove always polite at home and is at home with all classes of people black white yellow red aren't different it's still the same they don't just love the lovely it loves it unlovely all classes all kinds amen never root or discourteous amen that's a verse five number six unselfishness love in essence amen never selfish sour or bitter seeks only good of others doesn't run others down lifts others up [Applause] praise god hallelujah glory to god seeks only good of others does not retaliate or seek revenge [Music] hallelujah verse five huh you look at look at the chart there come up the ladder where you think you're on that ladder right there praise god number seven good temper love and disposition amen never irritated never resentful verse 5 number 8 righteousness love and conduct or hate sin never glad when others go wrong always gladdened by goodness to others always slow to expose charity hides a multitude of sin hallelujah amen don't seek out the faults of his brothers and sisters it covers it [Applause] hallelujah amen always eager to believe the best always hopeful always enduring verse six and seven number nine sincerity love and profession never boastful and conceited not a hypocrite always honest leaves no impression but what is strictly true amen never self assertive amen no does not blaze out in passionate anger amen nor brood over wrongs why did he or she do that to me i don't understand it you can't come to church no more praise god always just joyful and truthful knows how to be silent full of trust always present always present sure it could be stand that way and you walk up it turns around is present regardless of what happens right there instant spontaneous now one thing it cannot do charity never faileth it can never fail we can have everything uh uh uh listed in the first three verses here of corinthians have everything in there praise god and though we speak with tongue and men and angels have not charity praise god i am becoming a sounding branch of tinkling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries though you understand the mystery of the rapture and you don't have charity it don't mean a thing to you though you understand all thunders and all these things it means nothing to you unless you have charity praise god amen amen do you have all faith seventh under faith rapture in faith and have not charity i am nothing oh praise god and though i before my gospel feed the poor and do i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing well what we're going to do we're going to now therefore give me this mountain we're going to die out we're going to be born again we're going to add to our faith hallelujah we got no more time to hang around here we know what this message is now we have knowledge to understand it now praise god oh my would you like to have charity how many like to have charity in here praise god amen well you can it's your promise for this age is already vindicated by malachi 4 the rapture's already vindicated the new city is vindicated it's not maybe will it be what is it the future home of the brand is already vindicated it's in your heart already it's on the tape spoken word books is already vindicated this promise of charity is vindicated already may be seated now remember the seven virtues must absolutely be birthed in you before charity will ever seal them up in you for service and you can you can't even get virtue without first being born again so we have seven human virtues we ain't talking about those now see and number two these seven virtues must be a scripturally proven to be in you they must be tested you know your temperaments must be tested your patience and so forth must be tested amen and your knowledge must be tested to understand who's in the message and what is the message hallelujah praise god amen see and you know one thing you know that god cannot fail god cannot lie god heals god seals knowledge amen now there must be birth in you before the holy spirit as charity can come upon you and seal you up see you add these seven virtues until the complete statue of christ is made manifest then the holy spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body praise god amen well hallelujah on the guide page 16 uh brother man say what about the holy ghost in the church he was speaking about the instinct of the ducks to go south and when the time uh uh when the cold comes they go south of louisiana and texas for the rights and so forth he said what about the holy ghost in the church the instinct you know and all the leaders from old formalities and creeds and things into a glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost where there is virtue knowledge patience and godliness in the holy spirit now what he's telling you the holy spirit himself descended from heaven with a shout out and he came in the form of mechanics and dynamics as promises together and then that was the guy and the prophet released that then that should have led us from 1966 to virtue into knowledge and to temperance and to patience that god is in brotherly kindness and maybe today the holy ghost all 25 years and maybe today the charity will pour out because the uh the holy ghost is inside of the holy ghost he understands so his patience and all the rest of his inside old church that's what we need today that's what i am dedicated to on this third phase starting from june 9th today praise god amen so therefore the minister's commission and all of us is my commission anyway and the rest of them are supposed to be statue of a perfect man page and he quoting back to the second peter 1 whereby given to us exceeding and great precious promises do you now understand the promises they were given by malachi 4 and he left what did he leave here the promises and many sit here and they said they don't understand the promise god gives a promise noah is going to rain i promise you rain now suppose noah got all nervous and excited in 10 years where's the rain 20 years got mad 50 years evil 75 years stop preaching it walked away but noah staggered not praise god he said it will ring amen there will be a statue of a perfect man amen there will be a glorious baptism of the holy ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance i don't care how long i have to preach it it will happen praise god how long will you preach it until the last one is sealed with charity that's when i'll stop until then that's my commission may be seated now we have escaped what are you doing in here you escape the world that's what you're doing in here you escape the world by these great these exceeding great and precious promises that you might be partakers you just didn't escape the world coming here forever for what to be partakers of his divine nature for a purpose god has called you to virtue in glory hallelujah to partake of his nature through the promises he may be seated haven't escaped the corruption the prophet listen to that that is in the world through lust the corruption comes through the people lusting in the world over desires for money and women and sex and all kinds of things that's what's in the world corruption but we escaped that [Music] that's enough to sit down for 10 years and say hallelujah praise the lord thank you jesus for escaping the corruption not sitting around all sad hallelujah it will rain yes sir you may be seated lust for money lust for big things lust for popularity see these are over desires uh these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tent or college why should i care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that i'm interested in the kingdom of god whether i maintain my home whether i maintain my family whether i maintain whatever it is let me maintain christ the hope of glory build me up oh lord right here say oh lord into this let christ be my head let working through me on my foundation my faith down there amen that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience guys and brotherly kindness work in me o lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sink or drown denomination no denomination friend or no friend say why i preach the way i preach i ain't got no friends okay i gotta preach the word amen they all walk away praise god let that work in me now let's christ's virtue his knowledge pour out let charity come forth and pour out virtue pour out knowledge the seed is already in there when you put them seeds in there april 7 28 may 12 may 26 amen put them in there june 5th june 7th the seeds are in there when it happened then came jesus 17 years faith faith faith faith 17 years later then came jesus now come back again with them virtually again and now something's going to happen now praise god all that group is together now praise god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god the glory of god is in the temple the normative is upon you oh hallelujah praise god god be praised amen you're understanding now minds are coming open praise god hallelujah you may be seated let it pour out that i might be able to teach those for god has said it in the church apostles prophets teaches pastors evangelists all for the perfecting now the sixth message on wednesday you catch it on there and bring in all these virtues into it to that perfection of the coming of the son of god oh praise god god be praised my that perfection of the coming of the son of god amen and the lord come with a shout and a voice in the trunk that perfection yes siree let it pour out lord oh hallelujah the guide says that charity is a wonderful glorious baptism the holy ghost where there is faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and bully kindness and the holy spirit so that means that if that wonderful glorious baptism of chatting with poor today immediately those seeds would receive faith amen and those that already have a birth would be refilled and then they would pick it up they begin to hurt you in knowledge and tempers and patience hallelujah they're coming on now praise god to shake in the earth hallelujah glory to god amen may be seated and the holy spirit see the holy spirit itself back in the church now we know that the holy spirit is christ the anointing amen like sister a pharaoh saying for us this morning the anointing amen now let's go to my subject amen let's get to my subject here charity anointed seven virtues for a manifestation of the seven thunders wouldn't that be wonderful three questions i want to ask amen i want to answer number one what is the anointing number two how do we receive the anointing and number three after we receive the anointing what do we become amen [Applause] i'll pause let you think on that now sila means pause and think on this all right now questions uh cod book but i have the the old one book two questions and answers the old green series but you pick up your cod book i think it's the same page anyway well before we do it now let's nail down the firefox ministry because a lot of people say that there is no fire for ministry in the message let's nail down the bride the church and charity as that which is perfect has come okay and brother brahma answered the questions i don't know what is the question what's the confusion amen on page 87 i've done this before but i think today maybe it'll strike home amen now there's many questions here well will the pride will this the church see you can't divine what they are the bride is the elected of god the church goes through that's the ones it says whosoever will let him come but the bride is elected of god so now you want to get off get in before the spirit comes upon the bride and the spirit and the bride say come you want to get in before that because whosoever will let him come and that's a church that goes through a tribulation period so we ain't just coming here for nothing we're trying to get in and be positionally placed but you can see what's happening there over in europe the uh brother and tony was telling me his father told him that july i believe that they're getting together on the money and the whole thing uniting and letting russia come into it in europe over there so brother thinks the clock is ticking amen praise god now see that's the one that says whosoever will let him come but the bride is the elected of god selected for the bride to be in here predestinated they're happy to be here they know they're going to be sealed they're not funny and walking around all strange not the bride no they're elected predestinated of god they're always the same yes so they're in and out up and down they they're there once that light strikes that seed they're not going nowhere praise god amen husband and wife sit together stand together praise god and they stay together amen praise god now no are there's five there is these are right in a row here there is five offices elected of god for god has said in the church apostles prophets teachings past and evangelism god did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else but you see but god said in the church for the perfecting of the church can't divide it a lot of people that message get mixed up with a elder app to teach and a real five four minutes to pastor they don't know the difference and that's where all the problems come in and see well that man is a past and the fire for ministry that's christ in there the ministry of christ not just somebody in the message running around because there's so much knowledge to spout out anybody could preach in this message here amen but anointing where's anointing hallelujah breaks the yolk upon the people [Applause] it doesn't bind them it breaks it hallelujah sets them free because it's christ in them setting the people free by the word hallelujah may be seated glory to god can't define it so if we understand it now there is a fight for ministry well then i can i start my my commission pouring into virtues do you see me as a pastor after all 17 years laboring do you believe it's the truth then stay with it praise god amen okay now the holy spirit i'm speaking about today now the holy spirit when it comes it it it is a witness unto you that this word is right now you had this word for 25 years and we're looking for this holy spirit this anointing to come down here today to witness to you that this word is right and god confirms his word with signs and wonders and miracles and gifts of the holy ghost hallelujah the holy ghost will testify and you will testify hallelujah praise god amen now you got it the prophet brought the word with the promise of the holy spirit to follow the word and where you preach that word by revelation the holy spirit follows that word zing zing zing wherever it goes at somebody block it off it goes right over top of you praise god it goes right behind you in the seat behind you goes right through you praise god you have no receptacle to hold it amen yay amen you may be seated now the holy spirit when it comes it is a witness unto you see that this word is right the word for today not the word for luther the word not for moses we witness it's the truth see it's another day that's why we are preaching this here i'm looking for the holy spirit to confirm it hallelujah now first corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come and i read the scripture that which which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid and turn to talking tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect i hear what he says and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication that's charity that's the word but it comes in dynamics and mechanics and the dynamics is supposed to confirm to you that the mechanics is right then it's charity that's christ hallelujah praise god then that which is in part is done away with all these little interpretations besides this pentecostal stuff all these interpretations is done away with in the message listen i think this i think get done away pray finish praise god amen yes siree praise god amen when i was a child i speak of the child i understood as a child but when i become a man i put away childish things amen i go to preaching and then don't get through these things yes sir okay now now what question number one praise god uh what is the anointing what is it amen okay um but you see the church where am i at here uh okay here we are um what is the anointing page 101 amen 101 in the book here okay now and now what was that other question i get so wound up in these i forget the things uh what the things were one of them was was i they asked brother brown was he the son of man here it is i believe the son of man said they can't understand that god could be veiled in that prophet they don't get it you know and not jesus skin but the skin from genesis 18. human skin see they don't get it you see that so they say he is the son of man or the son of man was revealed in him that's what the scripture said so man would be revealed well the holy spirit the word he's gonna have a body to come into can't come into that piano over there praise god amen so it came in malachi for his body amen okay uh forget what the uh here it is i believe the son of man or was the pillow fire the son of man no now watch the pill of fire is the anointing you got it now and christ is anointed amen now now that pill of fire is the logos that went out of god the logos which is actually the attribute or the fullness of god you see this is now we're preaching it people are going and coming see but what they're doing they don't know see they're rejecting the fullness of the atonement now many in the message will take the atonement in part and you wonder why don't they do this they want to do that well they're only taking it apart but a bride is going to take it in his fullness so it's a big difference amen see so yeah and see the attribute other way you're taking all of the logos amen the answer to the fullness of god when god be coming to a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth amen coming down like seven rainbows condescending yes sir coming down god the father the locals that was up over israel he was holy could not bear sin there had to be a blood over right in eden then that locals become flesh and dwelt among us and where the locals dwelt in the human body which was the sacrifice amen oh praise god yes sir the pillar fires the longest did you pick that up now now jesus said i come from god and i go to god is that right after his death burial and resurrection and ascension when the body was taken up to sit at the right hand of god now i don't mean god's got a right hand god's a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of god that in that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in the earth is named after it and subject to it a name above all names jesus christ amen now this logos this logos that was in him which was the spirit of god the anointing yes sir through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons of god which is anointed with the same logos you anointed if you have the holy spirit with that same logos apart that locals come into your being his being come in you praise god you change you can never be the same anymore oh hallelujah praise god yes siree now on the day of pentecost they come down that pill of fire and broke apart like that and tongues of fire set up on each other not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon them elected selected group identified by this pill of fire showing that god has separated himself into man do you get it god the logos separating himself into man god not in one person he's in the church universal amen that's the reason jesus said the works that i do shall you do more also more now i know the king james version says greater but the right translation there is more than this shall you do got more bride to do it with god was bottled and confined in one man jesus christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living god i got god in this bottle praise god you got god in your bottles in your wine skins this tim is giving you stimulation of the revelation oh soft skins pliable skins not all wrinkle up skins praise god it might burst to get any new wine you can't take it hallelujah acts 238 skins that can shout and give and move and say hallelujah praise the lord that old wrinkle up dry skin you put some revelation in there burst open can't take it i don't believe that pray i know you don't believe in praise god hallelujah the seven thunder the seventh virgin the seven church i don't believe that i know you don't praise god hallelujah praise the lord amen [Applause] now here on tape this is my church here now leave me alone now i'm finished out there praise god i'm speaking to my church i'm pouring the virtues into them hallelujah if you get a hold of this tape i'm not talking to you i'm talking to these people in this church here yay hallelujah glory to come tired of these ministers figure out what am i saying i'm not talking to you i'm talking to the people here glory to god hallelujah oh man the anointing is in the building hallelujah glory to god oh affirmative in the upper room hallelujah yes glory hallelujah amen amen glory may be seated right now while god is is here speaking with us in our hearts right here he's in africa he's in asia he's in europe he's in england wherever believers are gathered together there he is in the midst of them and we are here we are sovereign we preach what the what the holy ghost tell us to preach and not what you think we should preach glory to god amen all right we on the beam now yes sir right now the anointing is right here with us praise god now let's understand the corporal body of jesus christ you see it on there it's called l-o-v-e it's up in the air and in between l-o-v-e and brotherly kindness is holy spirit now you're gonna understand something now you can never see love that's his corporal body that's what i call the heavenly christ we are the earthly christ or we are to become messiahs on this earth anointed ones praise god hallelujah yes sir page 103 then watch the works of it among us proves the same jesus that once lived in palestine that the same spirit was upon him has come up through a body until it's come back and headship again which he's coming soon to claim the body now that's l-o-v-e he's coming soon amen to clean the body but first he comes with a shout and a voice and then the trump and dead in christ rises then we see him and malachi 4 says the behold the lamb of god hallelujah is right in front of you amen living for that day all else means nothing hallelujah praise god back to the headship again which is coming soon to claim the body oh there's a time of the revelation of the redemption there's a time of claiming by fire oh lord send the fire to claim our body today and send me on to the resurrection praise god hallelujah amen that has come into the body you get it that will be the son of god the son of man the son of david the i am the rose of sharon the lily of the valley the morning star that's him l-o-v-e corporal body jesus christ amen and now brother brown says i am not he he's answering the question i am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form and it's called the holy spirit pillar of fire and we have a part of it if we have the holy ghost in us of that holy spirit he's come down the last days by the word together pride together universally by one message praise god into one body oh glory to god amen now i am not he i am his servant and the pill of fire is not he is in spirit form see which was upon the son of man and then he went up and sent down his spirit in the upper room and it's been down through all the apostolic age in the seven church ages and come right back in his fullness released by malachi and four because he brought back the full word and now we can have the full holy ghost oh hallelujah i know what i'm talking about praise god charity anointed seven virtues amen for manifestation of the seven thunders amen now i'm not he is the spirit form which was upon the son of man has come now to anoint sons of man to bring back a ministry now you understand the mercy of jesus christ now this charity that's to be loose is loose for what to bring back a ministry his ministry oh hallelujah bring back emergency just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head lovee and the rest of the body to connect together you got it now he ties into the pyramid just like the pyramid as enoch built and we find that in the pyramid they never did get the headstone on and why the headstone yet to come the headstones yet to come the seven steps in the pyramid now watch we'll go through that someday and i'd just like to show you how it really is perfectly with the scripture all these guys that come against the thunders and virtues of the world he said he'd go through it one day the holy ghost would and he'd show you this perfectly with the scriptures but it's a revelation until he goes through it not to everybody amen praise god so they don't understand it amen so now that now that great diamond see lovee could not settle down there in luther because it was luther was too wide and then as they come in the west bay is still too wide and brotherly kindness was still too are you looking at it so then he had to drop a ministry called the holy spirit and love will only fit into the holy spirit [Applause] it won't fit into the kind of only in the holy spirit but the kindness with all the virtues in it must pick up the holy spirit it must catch the capstone on the seventh step now it's death to go in there but mordecai like i said the other night told you how to dress esther if i perish i'll perish but my people haman the world council is after them so what am i going to do and mordecai told me what to wear and how to dress and it was the law of the king then at that time in persia that you could not come in to see him unless he sent for you even though you were one of his wives so esther knew she didn't have any command to come in there maybe seated so therefore she said and mordecai told her well you have to do it or they're going heyman's going to kill these jews here all your people so she put on all that a mordecai totally put on and then she walked and she was beautiful the king was he was gone he looked and he says what do you want esther under half of my kingdom and he put the scepter forward hallelujah can you imagine that charity drops down here maybe in 1991 and a lot of these people in this message try to approach charity the king without these uh virtues here with some little interpretation and mean and mad and putting people out of the message and how they gonna approach charity when i just went through the things that he is not puffed up and beareth all things hope with all things praise god and all these guys gonna approach charity huh with their strange revelations saying the virtues is not there it was a way back there somewhere because they don't have a life that's why they can't preach it they don't have it how can you preach what you are you can't be what you hate praise god you can't produce it they cannot produce it they don't understand that you you are it is a battle it's a revelation you fall down a thousand times but you get up i'm going to have it i'm going to have it praise god amen so come on esther put on your seven virtues and come in and see the king hallelujah he'll give you the scepter thus saith the lord oh hallelujah praise god you may be seated yes siree now that's now i understand that stone not going to fit down there will not fit down there on the bottom foundation neither will it fit on the second on the third it'll only fit on the top foundation you know that's just a perfection right amen on the top uh when the entire building has become fitted to the stone and it drops that holy spirit in there to do the fitting oh praise god has become fitted to the stone and jesus cannot come until the church a body of believers and the ministry that he once left there it is holy spirit ministry on early apostles and on malachi 4. you got it now amen the mercy they once left will have to be the same then as it was then and then that brings then there's a resurrection then without us is not made perfect paul said hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the lutheran wesleyan and all of them down through their ages when that come when that part where the eagles gather just as the carcasses the ego will be gathered the question was oh it's just perfect i hope that answers the question well praise god we understand it you know what anointing is now the pill of fire oh the holy spirit praise god amen now we know that this the holy spirit is coming in for purpose is bringing back a ministry of charity and the purpose is to raise up the dead to be perfected so we can connect with love love and air oh hallelujah can't you live for that amen connect together in times anointing pillow fire into the pyramid amen just like the pyramid amen so therefore that capstone will only fit on the top amen jesus cannot come back until and he is loved on your chart the mercy of jesus christ will have to be here in order to raise the dead in the resurrection then comes jesus as love corporal body in the rapture amen okay or a church we need charity today do we need charity but charity anointed seven virtues for manifestation of the seventh on this question number two oh praise the lord how do we receive this anointing how do we get it amen said you have a perfect man amen well okay here's how we get it amen page 46 that's your perfect man 47. you speak about the pyramid and they had rejected the headstone it was never put on on the top of the pyramid they couldn't understand why the capping stone was rejected they had christ but it will come someday we believe we we're looking for it here we're preaching this morning even so come lord jesus that we know we believe we have preached the correct inspiration of the prophet's message so we're not ashamed of the gospel was the power of god unto salvation praise god amen okay now how do we we receive this anointing all right page 47 here now in bill and the virtue building this monument building the statue see it starts off and the foundation is on faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness bully kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls and he is the strength oh you're waiting for the strength oh i can't do anything now without divine in the branch you get it now you hardly got spent to break a paper bag huh amen all you have enough power to go out of here and then i don't know what's going to happen monday and tuesday had no strength got no virtue power amen and the charities got to loose it amen because in charity there's faith and virtue of knowledge and so forth but the word has kept you all this time amen god is love and he controls he is the strength of every one of these things yes sir right in here right in here see i got in between all these works in here and these little waves come along what is that the holy ghost coming down through christ holy spirit see the holy spirit there then that's christ and then it goes down through the seven church ages there the holy spirit is above all this see he's up there welding this together building a what a perfect church for the capstone to camp all what's it been doing what's it been doing again it's manifested through seven church ages and seven church messengers amen now he says here you are seven church ages seven steps god building us building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power coming down through this welling us together therefore the pentecostal people has let out the lutheran let out the wesleyans and doesn't know what they're talking about you see they lived in this part of the temple that's the way some people excuse me can come up that high then drop off but there's a genuine part that keeps making that building come on i will restore saith the lord there's some people that will stand there for 25 years and keep saying that i will restore saith the lord there will be charity see the rest of them drop off somewhere else amen they don't have the revelation that they all understand they're being tested amen see but it will happen because he said so and that that's how he's doing it well how is he doing it brother how will i receive this anointing by receiving these virtues because it will only come on the virtues there's no other way i mean i just read it to you the seventh virtue of the second peter one four through seven now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls in the strength of everyone these virtues amen and christ the holy spirit the pillar fire the anointing you see it on the chart there amen the holy spirit is above all this well and all together amen uh what's it been doing is manifesting through seven church ages amen seven steps and so forth now i will restore saith the lord this is page 47 here in phase 48 you remember that the bride tree you remember the sermon on the bride tree amen they eat it down but he pruned it it got denominational branches he pruned them off uh they raised up another branch another church the nomination of branches he pruned it off but the heart of that tree kept growing now watch in the evening time it shall be light that's when christ the holy spirit you see it there jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church and then he will resurrect the church being his own body so he come down as a shout to the prophet with the message and that message the word was to be the head of the church and if you find a pastor or man of god who will preach the handship a lot of people won't like it a lot of women won't like it i'll tell you that amen they'll get mad say you're mean and hard but that is the headship christ descended from heaven with a shout hallelujah through the prophet and he is still in command today praise god many walked away but christ the headship as the word revealed word is right here hallelujah he shall not be moved i shall not i shall not be moved hallelujah praise god let them all walk away praise god but i shall not be moved so they don't know that christ is here the headship they don't know who the word is they go by emotions and so forth you may be seated but the head is here all the time as the word so obey the word and the things that's preached amen he's only testing you investigating judgment to see if you really want to go out of here see amen that's when christ the holy spirit jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church malachi 4's message is the head of the church that's why you're here that's what all these books and things is about it's the head and the minister supposed to keep that messiahship straight yes sir oh my my then he will resurrect the church being his own body see how he does it himself all we got to do is surrender oh praise god amen and there's a body church being his own body and there's a body in a way god is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he brought his church into girls see through seven ages every church age it becomes one big church you see it now so therefore in the evening time it shall be light that's when jesus comes christ the holy spirit jesus the anointing comes down and sets himself at the head of the church uh what is he the anointing christ holy spirit the anointing amen now we'll say how do we receive this anointing i just gave you a party now here's the rest of it see these fellows will not require what these fellows here that wasn't required like lutheran wesleyan and pentecostals of them see uh he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his people up church then individuals today see uh then peter here says first now i'm reading from here what peter said seven things faith virtue see coming up knowledge temperance patience god bless love and brother kindness and then the love of god the holy ghost christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost i'm born again i got it you got what do you have those virtues in you birth in there real patience and real temperance real godliness before he ever comes upon you did i lose you you're just getting started you've been around here 25 years proven that you believe it or there wouldn't be nobody here to preach to amen you're somebody you're the brand you're the queen you're the part of the word you believe it you don't doubt it hallelujah don't sink back into your human spirit amen put your chest out praise god amen you got it now be me i gotta have these virtues in me before the holy ghost ever come upon me i just explained it to you charity anointed seven virtues amen so if you got the holy ghost he's supposed to put this in you amen but you're looking for some virtue so you heard it before the holy spirit will disguise himself as virtue see the holy spirit the anointing the pill of fire amen charity i'm preaching for today will slip down in here as virtue the guy and give you power in your burn and then birth those who are ordained and then they begin to add then virtue and knowledge and temperance under charity the anointing my god amen can we say amen we're getting this here okay now don't let it blow your mind out like you you missed something because we're just starting i'm trying to preach trying to pour these things in there amen amen all seven this is how you receive the anointing i'm asking a question amen then the love of god the holy ghost christ and the person of the holy spirit in other words the spirit is a certain way and he acts a certain way and then that's the word that's already in you then he comes upon that and he anoints the word that's already in you and not only will you hear the message you will see the manifestation of the message from your inward parts god will become tangible like he was in malachi 4. hallelujah oh church praise god oh hallelujah praise god understanding what thou here is you may be seated let me hurry along praise god christ the person of the holy spirit comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then god then god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle the living god's dwelling place hallelujah oh my then god the anointing and you are one god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle live in god's dwelling place when a man possesses these things these kind of things the holy ghost anointing comes upon him amen okay now when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him did you get that when you possess faith and virtue and knowledge and is moving and living in you and you're waiting for charity and it's such a subject and then one day you see and the holy spirit reports back to the father says he and she's ready put him aside i want to visit him with an angel and then the same holy ghost that sent christ out this is my beloved son who i'm well pleased into the wilderness he went then later two two years later up on the mountain same holy ghost this is my beloved son who i'm well pleased here he him is added amen so we're down at the river now we're waiting for the holy ghost to come upon the dove to come down now charity the dove and take us into our trials of temptation three wild attacks by satan to prove that we have these seven things in us hallelujah praise god where you been where you going discouraged your satisfied or what you getting ready for three wild attacks lust of the eye praise god lust of the spirit pride of life that's why i've been preaching on these little things here trying to get you ready can you imagine the tv on one side and and cherry on the other side the anointing how do you put it both on the same scale amen praise god no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that god's got you might have all faith to move all mountains praise god you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues grow in and you add it to that to that to that then you live in a monument you are living moving idle you don't have to ask for confirmation you already have the thing inside confirming it praise god hallelujah glory to god cherry never failed it without this here you profit nothing but when these seven virtues growing and you added to that then after that amen and now how do we receive the anointing yes siree we gotta die amen page fifty and if you die you take the blood out of a man you embalm him trouble of it is a lot of them never got embalmed you take the blood out of a man he's gone then the only thing you can do is put another blood back in him you got me now another blood amen back in him praise god uh if he is going to live again you took his blood out and now we put the blood now watch these words
