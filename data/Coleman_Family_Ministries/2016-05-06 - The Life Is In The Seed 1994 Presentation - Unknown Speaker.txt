guarantees it right there oh hallelujah praise God Amen oh praise God [Applause] be oh Hallelujah Nigeria I've heard by the hearing of my ear I've heard the testimonies from brother Roo and brother Theo and brother bomo about a group of people over in Nigeria and it's so full of Faith so full of worship so full of fire that the devil can't stand and stay in your services but now tonight now tonight my eyes see it I see it I feel it BL Hallelujah I feel good tonight Hallelujah amen worship what B says that what Jeffersonville needs and I say what Legos needs oh hallelujah what Nigeria needs is thousands of Liv voices that's the Thunder that shakes the devil that's the Thunder that shakes the devil your C won't Shake him your C w't Shake him Minister you're preaching your preaching will shaking but you get one young person so living with Christ walking the streets of Legos walking the streets of Anisha walking like him and talking like him that's the Thunder that's going to shake the devil oh but said if Satan get a hold of it if he can get a hold of it he'll do great damage because what will he do he'll try to separate the light the virtues from the Thunders but he can't do it because the Thunders are in you are in you it seemed odd to Nicodemus how can a man be born again must he craw back into the womb of his mother and be born again how is that possible and today it seems so hard to think that in this filthy sinful generation that someone could have the ocity to say that there is a real Holy Spirit and I'm not going to be content I'm not going to be satisfied until that Holy Spirit comes into my life and what changes it so I'm no longer walking the same and act in the same until I have a new spirit and I new walk and a new talk it seems OD that's why so many churches even churches in the message will not preach that oh it can only get you to just believe that when you believe the message you are born again but I'm going to show you tonight that cannot be that never was that never will be Jesus said ye must be born again amen there's no way of getting around that there's no way of going over that you cannot crawl under that purse he must be born yeah what is the Holy Ghost but B him take the Holy Ghost to the Red Sea he explain how the children of Israel came out of Egypt they came out of the world but how Pharaoh wasn't going to let them wasn't going to let them have a safe passage to the promised land and when you become a Christian and you accept salvation the devil's not going to let you have a safe passage to the promised land you're not going to let you have an easy passage up to heaven and what is what what did he do he took all of the old task Masters and all of the old soldiers and they GA it all together and begin to chase those Israelites and what happens to you all those old sins that you thought you were deliver from the devil drags him back up on those old spirits on those old Temptations and he drags them back up and he gets you to a place where you're Corning the red seat in front of you behind you you hear the you hear Pharaoh's arm to the right of you is the mountains the coring on the left there's no place to go what does he do he has his poet stretched for his hand and oh the Red Sea opens up the holy spirit opens up we want you to go diving in there diving in there diving in there don't worry about Pharaoh just di in there don't worry about Monday don't worry about Tuesday this weekend you can be filled and what happens and what happens as soon as they went in there they turned around and don't see goes up and those Lush spirits and those alcoholic spirits and those rely fs and R associations will swall up in the Red Sea the Holy Spirit wash it faith into spiritual Faith so don't be discouraged just get desperate don't be dismayed just get desperate don't be upset just get desperate hey Lord feel me Lord feel me Lord oh think about it or your living or your sanctification will be in vain without the baptism of the Holy Ghost all these years you've stood for him all these years you took a stand on your job in your school all your prayers all of everything you've ever done in his name Will mean nothing without the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh get desperate tonight that is the message there's nothing else these minutes that should be preaching people have to get them to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's nothing else I could tell you young people than to be filled with the Holy Ghost don't rest day or night until you're so sealed with the [Applause] spirit but the reason why I can say this now we can preach this message now is that the holy spirit is loose te for you bless it be name now listen I'm coming to a climax now if you want to take one thing home with you tonight take this home the question is when are you a seed when are you a seed of God are you a seed of God when you receive the Holy Ghost no you always was a SE of God you do not become seed by the new birth because you are seed you can receive the new birth but Brown said if you were not asking for it there would be no Holy Ghost but the only reason there's a Holy Ghost is because you want it cuz you want it that's the only reason God gave it to you cuz you are a seed of God oh Hallelujah upon whom did the Spirit fall on Pentecost upon sons of God and upon whom is the spirit going to fall here in Lagos Nigeria upon sons of God upon seeds of God because on the inside inside is a deep calling and because there a deep inside of you there a deep to respond if there were no deep in you there would be no deep to respond but the only reason there a deep responding is a deep in you and the only reason there a deep in you cuz there a deep to respond blessed be his name there's no reason to fear him tonight who probably were Sinners maybe you were in some formal church and not believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you heard the message there was something in there called out for moral God you might have been living in the Justice High State before God but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you were hungering for it you would never hunger for it unless there was something in here to call for it out there see what I mean I would never come all these miles and preach to you about the Holy Spirit unless I knew positively that you could receive it tonight I will never come over here and tell you some Fable and tell you some myth unless I knew that there's a real God I've seen him pour out I've SE I've felt it I've experienced it and there's no reason young people of Nigeria there's no reason why you can't feel you now he can't feel you now amen spirit Lord will go through this building Lord there's any young person in here Lord that's in a back cing condition Lord may they somehow make their way to this altar Lord may they somehow make their way to this Altar and realize there's no more time left there's no more time left for fooling around there's no more time left for halfway believing they go all the way or perish Lord that is my prayer tonight Lord As We Worship You Lord May the Holy Spirit pour out Lord in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Lord amen and amen hallelujah keep worshiping him if you ever wanted the baptism of the Holy Ghost young people it shouldn't mean life or death I will not leave here tonight say Lord Jesus I beseech thee Oh God show me thy Glory he wants to hear you tonight young man young woman get desperate tonight Lift Your Voice Hallelujah like you've never never never never oh Father father pour out your Holy Spirit Lord oh Jesus Lord I traveled all these miles father you may be seated and it is a blessing to be back uh uh once again among Believers amen I love to be uh in a atmosphere of faith and preach a word of the Living God to Believers because the Believers have a way of making the word live hallelujah it's not some dead word praise God or some dry quote praise God but your Amen to the word makes it live praise God makes it a reality amen so we're not here just to quote some quotes or read some words up to you praise God but we're here to see a living God walk out of the pages of the Bible praise God and make himself real this morning to Our Living Church church amen look you thought you had the meeting finished but we are free one mind one one one body instead Onward Christian solders marching with the cross up going [Applause] on Christian soers [Applause] wonderful hallah may be seated so they fight it praise God and they try to say well we have something much greater than that praise God we know listen we've got to preach the Holy Ghost and we've got to preach the Holy Ghost as the Holy Ghost itself as a promise and identify it because when it comes comes it'll speak for itself it'll speak for itself the manifestation will be the interpretation of the Holy Ghost [Applause] itself praise God hallelujah amen those apostles were men of few words they didn't wasn't busy amen with wasted words praise God but when they spoke they have thus sayith the Lord even in their shadow the the lame walk in the cripples walk in the blind sword it spoke for itself for he was the manifestation of the entire Old Testament mystery you realize that the scribes and the Pharisees they read the Old Testament they read it but it was a mystery to them but Christ was the Ephesians the entire mystery unfolded that Ephesians made manifest the promised Messiah oh [Applause] my so what are you saying uh brother obl what are you saying brother brium prophesied it but we promised another Ephesians the word made flesh another Ephesians made manifest oh my my [Applause] mind so now there's got to come in Ephesians to this because everybody claimed to be Church everybody claimed to be bride everybody claimed to be in the message but there's got to be a coming calling out of there's got to be a distinct difference [Applause] everybody's not the same everybody's not bride there is a pride and God is going to identify that prde call her out by another [Applause] Ephesians you may be seated we received Letters by the literal hundreds from Uganda different all African nations and ministers have gone there for years with word word word word and now what has happened the seven Thunders has spread like wildfire all over Uganda all over Africa North Africa South Africa what is happening the seeds are being C [Applause] out fire he would be the same Messiah that led Israel praise God out of Egypt he would be the same Messiah you may be seated if you can praise God so what would Messiah be today he would not be an intellectual giant he would not be a religious politician but he would be Vindicated word manifested word god living among his people that's Messiah so when you see the Holy Ghost pouring out and filling the people that is Messiah God living among [Applause] us when you see the cripples and the crutches being flung up in the air is [Applause] Messiah cross over now over the Jordan he said let us stop playing games let us stop playing you mean to tell me until they cross over into the Jordan they're only playing games yes they're playing with God's people but we don't play games we have crossed over to the back of the book that is our inheritance every seal has been open so there had to be a link to link the man back to his original uh uh condition huh and brother brandham said on the Statue of a perfect man he said this is a message on teaching that ties a man that God has redeemed back to that Eternal Church [Applause] age you can take the word that's why I show it it's no more mystery the king sword pull your sword out time to go in and possess our inheritance oh my my my my brother Brenham said you wait till those seven Thunders utter their voices to that group that can take the word and hand it there it'll cut and slice it'll open the heavens it'll shut the heavens whatever she's saying shall [Applause] happen hey before morning praise God the prophet already spoke it that the Bible has already been revealed through the Seven Seals amen every mystery as you heard this morning has been unfolded isn't that right to reveal what our inheritance and the devil for years tried to stop us from getting to look under that seven seal praise God to see where all inheritance L but we thank God that there shall be light in the evening time oh praise God hallelujah oh you may be seated but what's the sense God send evening light if we don't have eyes to see so God formed the eyes within us inside a hair that when God dropped down the light we could see praise God because many wise men and Prophets long to be in a day like this and they didn't make it but you are here and you are going to make it because it shall be light in the evening time oh Hallelujah have enough tapes it's just ordinary come to church go back home come to church go back home what a dismal day what a dismal time it look like nothing moving nothing stirring but I hear Zachariah said it shall be light everything going to be cleaner oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah the man that is going to be redeemed brother his passport has already descended from heaven and God has stamped his Fe on [Applause] it oh Hallelujah who are these Devils trying to get us back get us praise God from these virtues but I'm locked in I am tied up I am wrapped up I am Tangled Up in Jesus Oh you talk about the Revival that going to shake this world the devil Ain see nothing yet the devil a seen nothing yet oh Hallelujah glory to God praise God you may be seated praise God in the Garden of Eden he fell Adam fell so the Adam didn't display what he's supposed to display to the devil and All Through the Ages the bride fell but God leave the best wi for last the devil never saw a people like this people the devil never saw a fate like this fate this is the resurrected Faith this is the faith that Jesus is raised from the dead he is alive to confirm his word oh we getting ready to rumble but this is the warm-up time we are going to get in that bra we're going to tell the devil Toe to Toe but I shall not be moved this land is my land but I'm going to C my herit give me my Mountain I get problems with Minister telling your own just stay with your pastor he ordain to lead you orain to lead to what if a man is off the word he is's ordain to lead to the tribulation that is beating the pride stal with me steal with me steal with me St with I'm staying with the word came at the end of the Pentecostal age it was darkness and L oia isn't that right Hallelujah and the prophet came and shine light praise God to call out a bride to call out a bride age but since the prophet have left all kind of things has happened and it got all dismal all over again oh Hallelujah interpretations replace denominations men ideas have been grafted in and God have waited till the end of 1994 oh Hallelujah till everything runs out till the shock is a chck a tear is a tear and a seed a seed is a seed oh Hallelujah and there will be light in the evening time it takes light to ripen it so the coming of the holy spirit is the coming of light to ripen the predestinated seed Sun that was born from under the seventh seal Oh Glory to God that they could come forth into a living manifestation by Living Voices in other words before God called you he went in his archives took out the scroll check your name Seal it back it's come so when Jesus met the woman at the well Hallelujah and he peeped up and see her name there he said give me something to drink he begin to talk with her and when that light flash she knew something happen are you ready God hates powerless religion you mean this praise God thank you Jesus come and sit down go back home you God hates that God want to see the devil splatter against the wall Devil's looking to fly out the building God want to see the crippled walk tonight God want to see the blind sea oh Hallelujah death hair it shall be light in the evening time oh praise God after all the isms has run out after all the interpretations have run out after all the so-called Messengers and interpreters have run out all the caretakers and all the praise God the dignitaries and the builders have run out then cor pushes out another Ephesians Branch this is the time for the manifestation of the seven Thunders Hallelujah Revelation 10 another Ephesians is here for the bride seven

earth now amen just as Jesus Vindicated the words of the Old Testament prophets this Ephesians church this another Ephesians are going to vindicate the words of that Kentucky Prophet who stepped out in this age and said there will be I'm preparing a bride for an exodus I'm preparing some people for a Rapture some people way down in Nigeria some young people I'm preparing them for an exodus I'm preparing them for a Rapture it won't be many but you will be there it won't be many but it's going to have to happen I don't care how many false anoint it ministers come against it and try to hold you down he can't do it he can't do it he can't do it the word has got fought oh my they'll try to keep great men from this message but they cannot do it blessed be his name if you call yourself a Christian that's a special responsibility yes that's a special title a special honor nothing to be taken like ly Christian and when you call upon the name of the Lord you're calling on something special and not anyone can call on his name but B talks about a group of Jews Vagabond Jews who had heard about the Miracles that Peter that had been done through Peter and they had heard that Peter had called upon the name of Jesus Christ so they felt that they can do the same thing there was a man possessed with devils and they came into his house and they said in the name of that which Peter calls Jesus I cast you out and that devil spoke back to them that devil said Peter I know and Jesus I know but who are you but in our day Satan will know who we are he'll know our walk he'll know our talk and when we say get the hits he'll go Hallelujah because we will bear his name we will be called Christians it's a responsibility but one which we are capable of holding because we are his children his name is our name that's our family name Christians part of Christ is not just the man you see on the street smoking sming a cigarette and drinking alcohol the Bible says that the unbeliever has a form of [Applause] godliness listen now a form of godliness for a season he will do the works of God he will do the works of God in a season but in the end he will deny the power thereof a form of godliness but deny of power worry about the unbeliever you keep preaching the word and they will back away they'll identify themselves they'll turn their backs they'll leave your assemblies they'll leave your churches let them walk away just wave goodbye to them don't worry about them they can't take the power when the inance STS on a scene when the power steps on a scene and identifies itself it's their nature to deny it they cannot help it that's their nature they're not seed amen so don't worry about the unbeliever the one you have to watch out for the one you have to be concerned with is the make believer you know why cuz a make believer looks like you he talks s like you he acts like you he impersonates you the make believer will even come into this convention and shout and sing with you and almost deceive you almost deceive you almost deceive you but there are a few fundamental differences between you the believer and he the make believer you hear only the word the make believer he hears everything he has itching ears he hears this Doctrine and this interpretation amen the make believer you hear only the word the make believer hears this criticism and this accusation and says this why can't I sing why can't I do this why can't he do that why are they doing it this way they're coming to this convention and criticize the Believers criticize the way things are run criticize who's speaking criticize who's singing criticize the musicians make believer make believer oh but not the believer the believer is happy to gather together all the Believers United under one head oh the head is Christ not United under no man not United under no church but United under Christ the believer but not the make believer he always has a lot to say a lot to criticize about come on you Believers take control of the meeting this is your meeting this is your age make believer Leia believer Ephesians Eternal Church age amen another difference a Believer believes 100% on the word the make believer believes 999 T will change one word in the beginning make believer Thou shalt not surely die Thou shalt surely die Thou shalt not surely die in this age believer seven saes are open make believer six saes are open one word in this age believer ask have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe make believer have you received the Holy Ghost when you believed one word one word 99910 but wrong I love you Nigeria oh keep on keeping on oh I'll come back here anytime oh I Le to come back here in the adoption season oh what a time that will be I can imagine on a way back and forth to the hotel as we drive down we drive ride down that road Bank Anthony way and the sick and Afflicted will come to us and we'll have the power to raise them up Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you that's what I'm looking for that's the kind of power I want to unite under are you ready for that kind of power do you want to unite under that power and let's come together under one head all across this world oh Nigeria God bless you never stop praising him never stop praising him why cuz every nation Every Nation Must Praise Him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] H was preaching minding his own business trying to preach in Broly kind to a church amen did not believe the inspiration and his Minister stood up in the
