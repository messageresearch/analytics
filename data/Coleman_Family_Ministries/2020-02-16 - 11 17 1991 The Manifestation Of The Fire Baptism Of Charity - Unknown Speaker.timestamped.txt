[0:00] well let me go straight to the word
[0:03] Saint Matthew 17 and after six days
[0:07] Jesus taketh Peter James and general
[0:10] around his brother and bringing them up
[0:12] into a high mountain apart amen
[0:16] but no worship here a high mountain
[0:20] apart and was transfigured before them
[0:22] and his faith faced did sharing as the
[0:25] Sun and his raiment was white as its
[0:27] delight and behold they appeared unto
[0:30] them moles in our lives talking with him
[0:33] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[0:36] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[0:39] thou wilt let us make it here three
[0:41] Tabernacles one for thee and one for
[0:44] Moses and one for Elias while they yet
[0:47] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[0:49] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[0:52] which said this is my beloved Son in
[0:55] whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen
[1:02] last November 3rd this was my
[1:05] inspiration and from Saint Matthew 3
[1:10] this is my beloved son who are well
[1:12] pleased hear ye him that was 4 November
[1:15] 3rd but this one hear this my loving son
[1:20] who and well pleased that was it but
[1:22] here is added three words this is it the
[1:24] option dear adoption so you might
[1:27] understand the difference same anointing
[1:30] the one is there placing in an authority
[1:32] jesus was a God prophet sent according
[1:36] to all the Scriptures and he was set in
[1:39] Isaiah 60:1 how he opened the eyes of
[1:42] the blind and cast out devils and he did
[1:45] all that he was obedient to his father
[1:48] then he took up on the mountain signs
[1:51] and wonders Americans followed him took
[1:53] on a mountain and there he had something
[1:56] else for him to do he was going to die
[2:00] for you and I he had the authority from
[2:03] God to die for you and I he was adopted
[2:08] it was positionally placed in the
[2:10] position that he was born for to be our
[2:13] king to be our Lord to be our Prince to
[2:18] be our Savior to be our healer to be our
[2:22] all and all he had the authority to do
[2:25] so
[2:26] amen that's why he was adopted there
[2:29] didn't last long
[2:31] he went straight to Calvary and this
[2:34] won't last long
[2:36] amen they'll think the close you down
[2:39] but it'll be there amen second Peter
[2:45] finishing up now

[2:49] inheritance incorruptible undefiled that
[2:52] fadeth with - first Peter aim whereby
[2:58] given to us exceeding great and precious
[2:59] promises that by Elysium might be
[3:01] partakers of the divine nature you see
[3:04] what it is now is through the promises
[3:06] you partake of the nature and there's no
[3:08] way to get out of it see having escaped
[3:11] the corruption that is in the world
[3:12] through lust and besides this given all

[6:59] now so we won't get you all caught up
[7:02] here and in case you didn't understand
[7:04] all these years and what brother brand
[7:06] was talking about and after he had the
[7:11] preacher guy Amen that night after the
[7:15] think statue of a perfect man and now he
[7:18] brought it back so they would understand
[7:21] on page one don't forget now always
[7:26] remember this and this is you people
[7:28] with the Holy Ghost you see and all
[7:31] that's gonna receive it there are the
[7:33] things that builds a servant of Christ
[7:35] see faith first then virtue and now I'll
[7:38] remember the Holy Spirit at the top
[7:41] right cannot kept the building of God on
[7:45] these things are what operating by the
[7:49] spirit when the world is message is
[7:53] operating by the spirit in they don't
[7:55] even know that the seven thunders is
[7:57] their promise let alone let it operate
[7:59] and begin to add those virtues up but
[8:03] how we thank God for charity point out
[8:05] praise God what is charity here for now
[8:09] to operate your seven virtues to give it
[8:15] power to give it a parent amen praise
[8:19] God two and two pair amen
[8:26] you may be seated until these things
[8:29] that are operating by the spirit and I
[8:31] just always bother me as well where in
[8:33] the world is the spirit to operate these
[8:35] virtues and no matter what you do those
[8:39] are the things that builds the body of
[8:41] Christ
[8:41] see those thing now don't forget that
[8:43] that this year's first your faith virtue
[8:46] knowledge and so forth is to be added to
[8:49] it until the complete statue of Christ
[8:52] is made manifest in other words if you
[8:56] get these seven virtues they have to be
[8:59] manifested even before charity comes
[9:01] upon it because charity will not come
[9:07] upon it unless it's manifested by
[9:11] manifested the people themselves will
[9:13] see your God life and you don't roll up
[9:17] full of patience and temperance and they
[9:21] know it you're full of power are you
[9:23] pray for them once and they got healed
[9:26] amen
[9:27] you're full of faith the people must see
[9:31] this manifested in the church here
[9:34] and no matter what they said to you man
[9:36] a woman you forgave them manifest it see
[9:44] you're growing up now you're on the
[9:46] third phase we can lay these things down
[9:48] to the whole church this may never
[9:50] happen again but you're here today now
[9:56] these videos being recycled back will
[9:59] mean something to you
[10:01] amen so get that the Spirit of Christ
[10:04] has got to be here and it's here to
[10:08] manifest these seven virtues that God
[10:12] can see it operating by his Spirit can't
[10:17] be nothing phony now how they live it
[10:19] now little dreams and things that put
[10:22] them in and a piece of them together
[10:23] that's nothing that the word this is the
[10:26] word hallelujah the word must be
[10:29] operated oh Christ has made manifest
[10:35] then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and
[10:38] seals it as one body these things must
[10:42] be there for jesus said by the fruits
[10:46] they are known see fruit you could not
[10:49] bear fruit without these things to bear
[10:51] it in you and then when all this takes
[10:55] place of takes the place of worldliness
[10:57] and ungodliness and so forth then all
[11:03] that belief is cast down then all the
[11:07] things the worlds pass away then there's
[11:09] nothing but a new creature in Christ and
[11:12] then there's Ephesians 4:30 says grieve
[11:14] not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you
[11:16] are sealed to the day of your Redemption
[11:19] sealed into the kingdom of God
[11:23] hallelujah now don't forget that keep
[11:27] that in mind now takes these things
[11:29] first watch then the sealing is the Holy
[11:35] Spirit that kept that seals us into the
[11:38] body see we another age prior to the
[11:42] Prophet you could have been baptized in
[11:44] the body he was in the body
[11:45] after the profit coming brought the word
[11:48] you're just getting started you gotta
[11:50] add that's this bride season now louia
[11:55] Prescott oh now my burden for 28 years
[12:03] amen hair has been to show the New York
[12:07] City portion of the bride her position
[12:10] in the word for this house it's been a
[12:13] rough time trying to do that now and
[12:14] second Peter 1 4 through 7 lays out the
[12:18] statue of a perfect man for the bride
[12:19] age you believe that a man and on such
[12:24] of a perfect man page 65 brother Graham
[12:26] really nailed it down he says some add
[12:31] to your faith virtue and to your virtue

[19:35] virtues what shall we do with Jesus
[19:37] called the Christ there's 29 coat amen
[19:40] the dynamics of this church will be a
[19:42] refilling of the Holy Spirit that we
[19:45] have worked in a small measure see you
[19:50] see that refilled it coming a little
[19:52] measure that we worked in 83 and trying
[19:54] to work it couldn't get anything out of
[19:55] out of it hardly a little small measure
[19:57] well therefore the time name has come
[19:59] praise God
[20:00] amen what you work in a small measure or
[20:04] refilling is coming praise God to enable
[20:07] you to give you power to climb that
[20:09] mountain yes what we what we work in a
[20:15] small measure in a small measure while
[20:16] the headstone is coming down to unite
[20:19] with the body the dynamics is the Holy
[20:21] Spirit the Holy Spirit is charity which
[20:25] releases the power of the Holy Spirit
[20:28] into the church as faith and then many
[20:32] in here sitting here without faith I
[20:34] know that you got mental faith you tried
[20:36] everything you could but you couldn't
[20:37] make a check because God's got to give
[20:39] it to you what you put you there I mean
[20:43] hey amen now to hear it the Holy Spirit
[20:45] is here with the power this is from
[20:47] perfect faith page 10 but you haven't
[20:49] got that faith to move it
[20:52] see what I mean it takes faith to move
[20:54] it now can you imagine in this message
[20:58] perfect faith brother grant 1963 he told
[21:02] people in the message the Holy Spirit is
[21:04] here with the power but you don't have
[21:06] faith the mood to pound now he had just
[21:09] told them in the seventh seal messages
[21:11] seven thunders gives you that faith
[21:16] and then again they still don't get it
[21:20] he told them that the Holy Spirit is
[21:23] here with the power you don't have the
[21:26] faith to move the power and left it
[21:28] there but the seven thunders gives you
[21:30] faith to move the power if there's no
[21:35] other terminology there's no other faith
[21:38] it's all or nothing
[21:39] so in the message brethren you might as
[21:41] well come to it this is your day I
[21:44] reckon you might as well recognize your
[21:45] day and your message

[29:49] Loreena caught him in a maybe scene it
[29:54] went away catch the whole thing then he
[29:57] same kind of Menace that he had when he

[30:19] Tree of Life is living again hallelujah
[30:25] glory to God amen yes sir so we got amen
[30:33] okay we got the first line justification
[30:35] in the coming of the camp
[30:37] hold it goes much being home down that
[30:39] so they can fit we got that place of
[30:41] trying honing testing tutoring proven
[30:43] and and growing birthing the virtues
[30:46] into you
[30:47] honing then after God sees the seven
[30:49] virtues tested and proven so I'm going
[30:52] back and forth so you don't miss it
[30:54] then he positionally places the proven
[30:58] tested matured son that has been seized
[31:02] and our child train tutored behavior
[31:05] everything else then he adopts them well
[31:09] I'm a sign
[31:12] all the baby stuff leaves the church huh
[31:16] what I did and what I didn't do is gone
[31:19] yes sir
[31:21] [Music]
[31:23] alright place of trying testing proving
[31:26] honing tutoring place of a mature
[31:29] placing of a maturity son positioning
[31:32] placing of a son into the position of
[31:35] authority
[31:36] now it takes the Holy Spirit to pour
[31:38] faith into us for a bath so I know many
[31:41] of you won and will win them I don't get
[31:42] the Holy Ghost well the Holy Spirit got
[31:44] that's what cherries in for cherries got
[31:47] to do it nobody else can do it but
[31:50] charity amen
[31:52] that's the way I got it Holy Spirit
[31:54] poured down to me faith that I was born
[31:56] again yes sir you gotta do the same way
[31:58] to you yes sir but all these all
[32:02] intellectuals will tell you that you got
[32:04] it when you believe it and you know that
[32:06] any soul yes sir
[32:11] all right now it takes the Holy Spirit
[32:15] to pour faith into us for a birth
[32:17] because it comes from above not around
[32:21] here nowhere amen
[32:23] so therefore talk on the words 1953
[32:29] Chicago brother man is talking what will
[32:32] bring faith to the people Malachi 4 was
[32:35] speaking about a revival and wrapped in
[32:36] faith cool great outpouring of the Holy
[32:40] Spirit in the lassies last days and
[32:43] that's the thing that will bring faith
[32:46] into the people
[32:49] this great outpouring of dynamics is the
[32:52] thing that will bring faith into the
[32:54] people who stood with the mechanics for
[32:56] 25 years or so that's the thing that'll
[33:06] take a wrapped in faith that'll take the
[33:08] church into glory
[33:10] unquote so now we see we need a great
[33:13] outpouring of the Holy Spirit which is
[33:15] cherry the capstone you just saw it on
[33:18] the video they're just pouring out how
[33:20] that's what you need and what's going to
[33:22] be in the groups and hallelujah
[33:24] just pour it out yes siree
[33:28] glory to God now Malachi 4 said the same
[33:33] thing about the Holy Spirit given faith
[33:36] where you say it from you said it on
[33:39] blasphemous names Amen on page 22 and so
[33:43] many in the message have so much mental
[33:46] faith they get all mixed up but they
[33:48] believe but it's mental because they
[33:51] asked the elders all kind of question
[33:53] not sure but the holy cook now Holy
[33:55] Ghost man he doesn't answer any
[33:56] questions he has the answer inside it's
[34:01] in the word now tell me who can I go to
[34:04] ask question for my mind battles well
[34:09] you don't think I have mine battles you
[34:10] I have my embattled but I can't ask
[34:11] anybody here I have to get on my knees
[34:14] and pray
[34:17] [Music]

[34:23] ministers out there
[34:24] get out of here eww let's go I can't go
[34:28] there yes sir
[34:43] amen
[34:44] all right blasphemous names page 22 and
[34:49] the biggest part of our faith is mental
[34:52] faith by hearing the word brings us into
[34:55] a mental recognition of God like Peter
[34:58] and enhancing but if this is coming from
[35:02] above
[35:02] oh brother if it ever strikes just
[35:06] cherish you're so poured out on the
[35:07] video there and you've seen raise the
[35:10] dead that's coming from above that ever
[35:12] strikes are consecrated sanctifying
[35:17] person sitting here I mean so lot to the
[35:22] world that Jerry ever strikes them yes

[35:32] Loreena car Oh hallelujah praise cut
[35:40] amen
[35:41] but this coming from above ever strikes
[35:44] this this is a godly spiritual faith
[35:48] then what does it do it was what does
[35:50] that faith to that faith recognizes only
[35:54] the word know all these cuckoo things
[35:57] disappear yes I see that good both of
[36:00] the church in this one all some kind of
[36:02] cuckoo thing there yeah you know faith
[36:04] yeah that's mental I just go on it
[36:07] doesn't even mean nothing there's no
[36:08] seed ain't meant from the word ain't
[36:11] gonna do nothing so I I just watch it
[36:14] let it go a man raised but see faith
[36:17] only recognizes the word no matter what
[36:19] anybody else says it only recognizes the
[36:21] word because in the beginning was the
[36:22] word it worried but with God and the
[36:24] Word was God and in the word still God
[36:27] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[36:28] among us and when the word itself watch
[36:31] is pouring into our faith our mental
[36:36] faith becomes our spiritual revelation
[36:41] Lord that you would pour down the
[36:45] charity into the mental faith in his
[36:48] church and let it become a spiritual
[36:50] faith supernatural faith hallelujah
[36:57] glory to God and when it's pointed out
[37:01] that our faith our mental faith becomes
[37:03] a spiritual revelation and a pundits
[37:07] foundation I'll build my church see
[37:09] you're not upon a mental conception of
[37:11] Church joining a mental conception of
[37:14] that but upon the revelation when them
[37:16] streams of grace is pouring from sister
[37:19] chiapas dream internet mental faith and
[37:22] that you've got then upon this spiritual
[37:26] revelation I'll build my church and the
[37:28] gates of the hell can't prevail against
[37:30] it I'm ssome one of the tapes I said
[37:33] that it would prevail but I didn't mean
[37:35] to say that because it can never prevail
[37:37] against I think it was on charity Amen
[37:40] that shows that they would be against it
[37:42] but it'll never prevail oh what a
[37:45] glorious thing
[37:47] oh now you understand what conditioning
[37:49] with mental faith uh all these years
[37:52] mental going through the Deacons and
[37:55] going to the elders please help me pray
[37:57] it's mantle that ain't get didn't anchor
[38:00] in there you got fate they got here on a
[38:04] chest don't have to ask anything
[38:09] praise God is faith revelation yes sir
[38:16] alright he is 23 to 23 and now in as an
[38:21] individual these these virtues and
[38:22] things are knowledge and temperance and
[38:24] and is added to our faith then watch
[38:28] when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit
[38:32] cements it together you will have a
[38:37] building full of seven virtually and
[38:39] then that the whole is really gonna
[38:40] cement it you can't run a razor Bay
[38:43] through there oh my god praise God
[38:49] submit it together there's the baptism
[38:52] of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so
[38:54] short you see so therefore oh my now

[45:59] number three sealed by charity by the
[46:02] fire baptism of charity okay number
[46:07] twenty page 23 here now speaking over
[46:10] here page 23 debar now do you remember
[46:14] when the book of matthew seventeenth
[46:16] chapter i just read it this morning
[46:17] the fifth verse Jesus on the Mount
[46:20] Transfiguration here you him the sermon
[46:22] I just about a year ago preach that
[46:25] become so popular the he him the placing
[46:28] of the son in Ephesians 1:5 also God has
[46:31] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[46:32] sons this is what I was striking no Ven
[46:35] third now watch see I'm a rehearses
[46:38] bactine I should be finished when a son
[46:41] is born into it it's the son but that
[46:45] someone had tutors to raise it and that
[46:48] son never did come to be the right kind
[46:52] of a son and he never become here but if
[46:58] he was the right son and that song would
[47:01] obey his found them that the son was
[47:04] adopted or placed positionally he become
[47:08] heir of what the father had and that's
[47:11] what God was doing on Mount
[47:13] Transfiguration when he took his own son
[47:16] after he had proven to be the right kind
[47:19] with the Pharisees and Sadducees and
[47:21] stood his ground as a word cast out
[47:26] devils healed of sick did everything
[47:28] right kind of a son a man character
[47:33] before pal yes sir
[47:37] Oh hallelujah yes sir hmm oh my god yes
[47:46] sir stood all temptation he took him up
[47:49] on Mount Transfiguration it always
[47:51] shattered him you know any Old Testament
[47:53] they took a son dressed him in a pretty
[47:55] nice pretty common set him out before
[47:57] the public they had a ceremony of
[47:59] placing or we call it a Topton in
[48:01] Galatians they I kind of think st. Paul
[48:03] refers to the dumping of sons amen now
[48:06] by placing ministers will understand in
[48:09] spiritual Bible readers our placing of
[48:12] this son in other words the son was a
[48:15] son when he was born how you see in
[48:20] natural life and some become more I
[48:22] don't know what roustabouts
[48:23] the father has the father weeps over him
[48:26] it wants him to put him in the business
[48:27] that's only a natural thing when what
[48:29] about him
[48:33] all those Rockefeller Zordon people they
[48:37] don't trust nobody else they want their
[48:38] own sons to be in charge it's like mr.
[48:41] Maxwell down who was in charge his sons
[48:44] that's part of his blood you part his
[48:49] blood hallelujah one more Pharisee to be
[48:54] in charge of his house one no false-9 I
[48:57] want to be in charge of anything
[48:59] glory to God he might give them iron
[49:02] weaves yes sir
[49:05] may be seated there's where Pentecostal
[49:09] people made their mistake being born
[49:12] into the family by the Holy Ghost same
[49:16] one that's right but then we must be the
[49:19] right kind of children tutored by the
[49:21] right
[49:22] tutor we're gonna talk about now and
[49:29] away to all these years to get up to
[49:31] this spot and I'm here and now I can
[49:34] arrest
[49:38] yes Amen God has predestinated us unto
[49:44] the adoption of son that's what he's
[49:46] done for us as in Ephesians born tutor
[49:50] then adopted into the body of Christ
[49:52] correctly what you are you do the work
[49:55] of a pastor you do the work of the
[49:57] Evangelist you do the work of an apostle
[49:59] and so forth but then it coming you then
[50:02] you go on off the mountain you go
[50:04] everywhere because one day when he
[50:07] positions you into the what you are
[50:09] correctly are in the body and what's the
[50:14] robe on you you can write the check oh
[50:18] god the interpretation of the name is a
[50:25] manifestation of the name and the
[50:27] thunders is in Jesus and Jesus ascended
[50:32] up on high and after he had overcome and
[50:36] conquered and received a new name and
[50:39] descended with a shower with his new
[50:42] name and they say brother Brad I'm could
[50:46] speak and do things as a sign and they
[50:50] said where the thunders and it be
[50:52] revealing the thunders with his new name
[50:55] I mean be revealing the thunders
[50:58] hallelujah can you imagine Jesus what a
[51:02] message waiting for some son was to come
[51:04] on and stay old beat into that word
[51:07] bringing him on bringing them on to over
[51:09] 25 years get him and get all the way
[51:12] down to what charities born out then the
[51:14] dead begin to be raised and the thunders
[51:17] this time for a seventh on the revival
[51:20] just about that time some of them are
[51:23] adopted with all authority my god in the
[51:28] name the new name is in them because
[51:31] Christ is in them hallelujah praise God
[51:35] you pray for them now but then you come
[51:38] man the
[51:39] come out commend the devil to come out
[51:44] hallelujah glory Takata

[51:56] is born - it is the Sun but that Sun had
[51:58] to does it to raise it that Sun never
[52:01] did be the right kind of son he never
[52:06] become here but he but he was the right
[52:10] Sun and the Sun that would obey his
[52:12] father you know going the old group of a
[52:15] group just saw just obey hey a man just
[52:17] do that a man
[52:18] praise God seem to upset you or
[52:21] something they meant Oh Oh be diems and
[52:24] I think acts 5:32 to get the whole it
[52:27] goes to them they will beg him that's
[52:30] the Bible yes sir brother Bram said so
[52:33] on the tolkien obedience tells you the
[52:36] whole token you know kicking all the
[52:40] stuff out the house and all that kind of
[52:41] stuff and that Sunday I would obey his
[52:49] father then that son was adopted a place
[52:52] positionally he become heir or what the
[52:55] father had and that's what God was doing
[52:57] on Mount Transfiguration when he took
[52:59] his own son after he had been proven to
[53:02] be the right son and it stood all
[53:04] temptations he took him up on Mount
[53:07] Transfiguration and overshadow him you
[53:10] know in the Old Testament they took a
[53:11] son dressing a nice pretty garment set
[53:13] him out before the public they had a
[53:16] ceremony of placing and we call it
[53:18] adopting in Galatians they I kind of
[53:20] think Paul st. Paul refers to it as
[53:23] adopting sons now by placing a son
[53:26] ministers will understand I was here
[53:30] before replacing his son in other words
[53:32] the son was the son when he was born all
[53:35] here yes where I was then there's where
[53:37] Pentecostal people made their mistake
[53:39] yeah being born into the family by the
[53:42] whole he goes that's right but then they
[53:44] must be the right kind of son to turd
[53:45] and that's the way I'm trying to get you
[53:47] here on the cross to it
[53:51] by the guy to be the right kind don't be
[53:57] like a Pentecostal who won't take

[54:03] and feelings and what they feel but a
[54:06] bride member goes by the Word of God

[55:26] on the check as his daddy's was they had
[55:28] a ring in them days a signet and he spit
[55:31] on it and made of spitting sound and hit
[55:33] the pulpit and this was a signet that
[55:36] was just he wore his daddy's ring his
[55:39] big signal and that was just as good as
[55:41] his daddy's now when Jesus had been
[55:43] obedient Jesus the guard God placed him
[55:46] positionally this is him and Windham
[55:50] here it is again now and as I'm finished
[55:52] with this here now when a member is born
[55:54] by the Holy Ghost do you understand it
[55:57] those within their mentals you need to

[1:09:40] earth 3 Matthew 3:16 when you get down
[1:09:43] into water and then when was fully
[1:09:45] maturity 30 years old he was baptized
[1:09:47] and obedience to general and down there
[1:09:49] our God in the water and went out and
[1:09:52] what happened the dog which was God
[1:09:54] descending from heaven with a voice
[1:09:56] saying this is my beloved son who are
[1:09:58] I'm well pleased to dwell what did he
[1:10:00] come to do to redeem that Polidori he
[1:10:03] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:10:04] because God is not a creation only in
[1:10:07] Christ he is a creation because God is
[1:10:10] eternal and he cannot be created he's
[1:10:13] eternal amen in a spirit and a spirit is
[1:10:17] not created he was the beginning of the
[1:10:21] creation of God and God redeemed that
[1:10:23] body see when he come down this is my
[1:10:26] beloved son are well pleased in him yes
[1:10:29] siree
[1:10:30] so this is he was beginning of the
[1:10:32] creation in God redeem that body now we
[1:10:36] often spoke here about the water baptism
[1:10:39] amen the Holy Ghost baptism and then the
[1:10:43] whole eagle Holy Ghost baptism the
[1:10:44] prophets thunders brought in a honing
[1:10:47] and a tutor ring he brought it in to the
[1:10:50] birth of the Pentecostal didn't know
[1:10:52] what it was that's one of them thunders
[1:10:55] that was left all sing but he just says
[1:11:01] it here these three then the Holy Ghost
[1:11:04] comes down and at the fire baptism
[1:11:06] number three and claims this creation
[1:11:09] this creation the same as it did him now
[1:11:12] do you know what I'm talking about
[1:11:13] we're talking about some people here
[1:11:16] with mental faith that wanted it to be
[1:11:18] spiritual faith and that becomes after
[1:11:21] they already had water baptism and that
[1:11:23] becomes Holy Ghost baptism and fire the
[1:11:25] fire claims the demons on
[1:11:29] then there's no more do I need a witness
[1:11:32] can I get a witness
[1:11:34] you got the witness the fire cleaned it
[1:11:35] out burning the demons off see that's
