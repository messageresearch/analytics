TRANSCRIPT
========================================
St John 17 the 18th verse through the 23rd and I'm going to read Ephesians 4 1-6 I'm reading from St John the 17th chapter the 18th verse as thou H has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word here we are praise our God aren't you happy that you believe their word Paul's word Peter's word James word that's and he prayed for us for those who would believe their word their message that they may be one as thy father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and Hast loved them as thou has loved me Ephesians 4 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended in the same also so is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry that there's only one Ministry although the ministry which is Christ's Ministry uh for the edifying of the body of Christ now here we all come in a Unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slave of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lying waight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love may God a blessing to the reading of his word I'd like to take a little title from this here perfect in one we know the word perfect uh in the Greek as we study just to get the meaning of it not that we're teaching Greek but the word would it signifies having reached this end finished complete and uh uh Ephesians 4 here the great book of Ephesians is where Mali 4 Elijah brought the church back to Ephesians Ephesians is the anti anti-type of uh a Canan landed type in the sense of it being spiritual warfare and Joshua and Israel back in the Book of Joshua it's the Joshua book of the new New Testament for it represents a Joshua was en type of the Holy Spirit and this is the one book in here that Paul tries to bring the church to its fullness and this particular chapter here in these 16 verses here uh speaks about one body a complex organism with many functions each in his own place working in harmony his basic principle is love Christ himself is the head and the directive Force now the one body is composed of many members diverse talents and tempers the fundamental requisite for his proper functioning is a spirit of humility and mutual forbearance allowance of forgiving for one another on the part of the members one toward another his object his goal is in verse 13 till we all come in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ this is the goal this is our Earthly goal and uh we know that uh as this as the church was moving toward this goal in the first three verses here he said that we were to Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace that means that it was to nurture each member nurturing one another into the perfect image of Christ and the way we could do it would be with through humility there would be no other way other than to be done through humility and he said to keep the unity of the Spirit and the spirit is the word of God and the unity of the spirit we know came forth in these last days by God's Prophet down in Indiana it was poured out and put on tapes and books so we Endeavor here to keep that Unity with the spirit through the prophet that poured out the message and we Endeavor to do this with humility instructing edifying exalting one another to keep this Unity cuz we cannot have the strange false doctrines moving in cuz it breaks the spirit one word one word off there's no ministers or there's no no Holy Ghost breaks the unity of the spirit amen just one word it's all you need so then uh here Paul is teaching that it would be a growth you would be growing up into a full manhood into uh his standard his stature and his full manhood and Christ's full manhood as a corn of wheat was his three and A2 year Ministry that was the standard that the all the uh the bride was to attain to that standard that life that was in that 3 and 1/2 year Ministry that life of love that life of of signs wonders Miracles always doing the things that please the father about the father's business that's the standard that we are striving Reaching Forward to amen now the church uh uh uh we know that childhood of the church will pass and its maturity will come cuz it has been spoken now the church for nearly 2,000 years it's nearly 2,000 years old and in this respect is still in his childhood State see it has not yet reached its visible manifestation of the whole known Unity it wasn't in the early church see it was it had reached a state inary church it was Unity it was one heart one Soul one Doctrine see one Spirit see it was one upon on the earth and but as we know as time begin to go on the spirit of the Antichrist began to move in just to break the doctrine down see and we all know from the teaching and then Paul mainly as a messenger he was continually trying to bring the church to the fullness of Christ from which they had lost their first love and begin to wne away even in the the Ephesus age and Paul went forward mainly he was against the factual elements in local churches they had Jew and and Gentile dissension and and the controversy in the Corinthian Church the legalism in Galatians and uh the book of Hebrews and so forth he was constantly at War trying to break down the barriers trying to bring them back to a Oneness which they didn't have the I mean as a visible church I mean but the invisible Church of course kept moving right on Amen the invisible ones those who were dead and their lives were hid with Christ in God the invisible ones who were being fed by the word amen they have kept moving on through every generation but I'm speaking about where like it was in Jerusalem when the the heathens raged the cils gathered together and to come against a visible church that had signs wonders and mirac father had the love of God in it that's the what I'm speaking about where there was a group of people and they knew who they were they knew that they had been with Jesus amen cuz they spoke with the same Authority amen they had the same life the same signs the same wonders amen and then uh uh Paul was striving for that there and he was fighting a good fight he was Keeping the Faith see and then come the bitter controversies through the second through the fourth centuries then the Imperial Church uh with his outward semblance of unity under State Authority see but it was uh it was a wicked church and then through the papal hierarchy with the unity of authority that robed men of their rights and so forth and drove the Bible out of circulation and move on into that and then we know as the light begin to come out of that the Protestant movement Luther and Wesley and on down into the Pentecostals and it went on into different streams it still wasn't a visible church yet just a invisible ones moving on see Catching wor to move it on and then it moved on down to our age to Malachi 4 Hallelujah and then when Malachi 4 come forward we all rejoiced but we said well now we will be one amen and what are we are we one why there's over 100 different variation of this message is that right and then yet we say we going to be one now cuz Malachi 4 has brought back the original word restored back the original faith and yet you can go into different groups and hear all kind of Revelations of the one Revelation Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory and you hear all kind you see but that that had to be so there's still all kind of strange doctrines and ideas and you wonder in your heart will they ever be the outw the outward rather Unity of the visible Church it will be for he said so he said I will restore all the years Hallelujah that the korm and the Locust and the caterpillar and the Palmer have eaten off of my bride tree I'm going to restore bright up on this Earth before she goes out of here there going to be a visible Church Hallelujah there going to be Christ in that church brother is going to be here and so therefore it's according to God's word the word will come to its ress the church will and now it'll come you know why because Jesus Christ prayed it himself father I pray that they will be perfect in one amen if God himself spoke the seed of God and it went out and out and out and out there's got to be a seed here on the earth that will bring to pass and make manifest Jesus Christ's own prayer perfect in one hallu no matter what happens amen it Pope World Council Bishops this person's idea of what they think is going to to be one Perfect Bride Church on the earth amen for Jesus Christ prayed it yes he said I not only pray for these here who were a perfect Church who were going to be but I pray Al also for you today who who were going to believe on their restored back word amen he Jesus Christ prayed for us that we would be one amen amen that we would be made perfect in one that we would grow into this here he's already prayed for us than but he's but because he has a pattern and his pattern is as thou sent me so I sent send them so therefore we would if we examine the pattern then you have to be sent is that right other words we have to be sent the way he is sent and then he was sent with a life he was sent with signs one doesn't matter he was sent with authority and then therefore we cannot move until we are sent as he was sent the same way so Peter now Christ says as my father sent me so I send you he said but T you first until you be end do with power from on high amen and then when the power came and out they went as he went out they went out the same way and that is the pattern that pattern shall never change you have to be sent by Jesus Christ himself and we waiting for the voice of the Resurrection the voice of Christ of the Archangel to come down hallelujah amen and speak to us amen adoption time man manifested s time and speak to you and tell you St John 59 do nothing except my father show me Glory you know there's people here who don't believe at there the faith Bank hasn't reached up high Yet brother you better believe it that's the pattern amen amen yes sir uh St John 17 my father sent me but vers 20 here for us to believe on the word here's why the 22nd verse and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be W even as we are W the glory second Corinthians 3:18 even as by the spirit of the Lord as we look into his face we're changed from Glory from Luther glory to Westley glory to Pentecostal Glory To His Glory Hallelujah I have given them the glory yes you we have the glory the word of God itself in as we look into his face which is all the word of God we are changed even as by the spirit of the Lord amen we're being changed now friends praise our God now why is this that the world may know that he was sent by God and only when we are raised up in his power in his resurrection and his reality can the world know that truly God sent his son amen his son died at the cross and he was raised for our justification hallelujah praise our God but is at Calvary that we must die with him as he died the Son of God so must we the sons of God die also hallelujah amen we must take our corn of wheat yes and we have the corn of wheat the seven sealed message the corn of wheat in our heart take this corn of Wheat and fall into the ground and die fall into the ground of his word and die out to everything here and our lives will truly be hid with him Hallelujah in God Amen it'll be raised in his resurrection to carry on his work Hallelujah and it'll be able to say as my father sent me so I send you you'll go forth in his resurrection yes in his power Hallelujah in his glory yeah but you must be dead because he goes forth that's the thing and that's where we've been trying to get the people to die Hallelujah die to their own thinking die out to the world die out to you because our own ideas amen and let the same God that was in Jesus the Same God that was in the early church bring forth the manifestation of the word bride Hallelujah as was promised and that's our goal in St joh uh because Ephesians 4 here it says that we will come to the unity of this Faith this is our Earthly goal the image of Christ in mechanics now and Dynamics love the finishing touch I think it's over in Colossians 3 put on these eight things and finally put on charity the bond of perfectness the outside garment that binds it all together the Capstone the love of God the strength Giver to every virtue amen we have the word the word is virtue power but he is the strength of it amen he can make the virtue live he can make the patience really have patience amen he can he can he he can give you true knowledge amen godliness brotherly he can make it live all the fruit it'll live for the life that's in the vine will be in the branches make it live that is the cap what you're waiting for Hallelujah but prior to this time here you adding by faith in the word of God this is our Earthly goal friends the image of Jesus Christ what a calling Ephesians 4:1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord isn't it wonderful to be his prisoner yes beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called amen and that's why we preach the way we preach here you're not called to be a a a slopping around here in the world down here brother you called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why we and as a bride of Christ you are a queen Hallelujah then live like a queen walk like a queen talk like a queen we are his bride elect elected lady Hallelujah that's right praise but many of we don't know our calling brother Ram said this here on why Christ speak I think every I think any man woman boy a girl in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings the word to a reality we can sit in here and until you personally meet that light that I continually talking about here it'll just be knowledge that's all it'll be to you but I think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known it's just dead that's all it is see among the people and they see it the people must see the supernatural moving through the congregation and that's how we've been able to thrive here on the Revelation that has moved through here cuz brother Braham said on the uh doing God service against his will when they see the things that's predicted happen saying thus saying the Lord and they can see it and they can talk back to it they can talk back to them Jesus Christ himself talk right back to you and you talk to him he talk right back see what are you doing over there stop that whatever it is call it right now he talks right back to you when they see that happening and then it comes to a reality then this word has gone forth is real to you sitting out here amen and when you come in here one day soon it'll be real to you amen praise God something that they can talk to that'll talk back to them that vindicates this written word some person supernatural being that's sitting down in here in form of a pillar of Fire and here's all the word written and it's spoken out there and he vindicates it and you see it happening and you know what's happening in here then brother amen praise God the voice of the Resurrection I'm speaking about and in the same vein he said this on page 14 that's what the world needs today and that's what the church needs today that's what everyone needs as Sons and Daughters of God in order to be that you you need a personal contact see you know God's word is true you know it's right but then when it contacts and then you see the thing then you know you're on the right Road amen that's the way it's got to be and then as we moving toward that time what has kept us this far is Faith in our hearts God placed in our hearts a faith seed and then come down himself and anointed that Faith seed Hallelujah the true bride that's sitting here this morning she believes in Ephesians 4:13 here till we all come in unity of the faith and the knowledge Son of God a perfect man she believes that true bride sitting here morning believe she is Jesus Christ bride amen she has no unbelief moving through her whatsoever could be maybe she is his bride amen for she has acted like she is his bride Hallelujah and going forth with her vows and so forth therefore the Malachi for anointing has come down to pfy the same one that anointed Moses he had a faith seed in him in his intellectual he tried to bring out this Promise by a killing that because the natural but one day the pill of fire talked back to him and he spoke back to the pill of fire and then it was all over then personal contact and every child of God must meet that Holy Ghost and then you just know there something that happens you you know it can nobody take it away from you been on the backside of the desert and they can move through here with every wind of Doctrine every slave of hand but it will not move you you unov amen you stand on the stum and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ why here's why it anoints us to see that we're living in the last days Jesus now watch what I'm saying here a little teaching here the anointing the pill of fire the son of man came down and brought a judgment message and he said that the the the signs in the heavens and the the political things in uh Israel and Russia and the nakedness of women and the a perversion of women these pants suits that you see now is a complete perversion of the women by them other words by having all micros that was because of one thing that was nakedness but when they put on the pants suits that is a complete a perversion amen absolutely a complete one and then when then when all the things that brother brandom said in a message that the church would do that the world would do that men and women would do and the sodomites and the and the whole thing when the bride who's sitting here now sees that happening oh it anoints her face that's what I'm saying this morning there's the bride it anoints her faith when she sees how the things that God said he would do that he would send Malachi for and when she sees Malachi for come forward she's anointed amen praise God Amen it anoints her faith now watch it moves her out into great Cycles amen it just lifts her up and moves her out on a promised word amen it separates us from the things of the world Amen absolutely these things predicted to happen brings out our faith for God said in the last days I'll do these things here and here we are walking along and we see a prophet with the sign of discernment and he speaks these things and he goes away and says 65 even J Ed Hoover he himself of the past five years has brought about the complete demoralization of this country amen the past 5 Years From when 66 7 8 9 and 70 and the prophet went away but he spoke these things that they would happen and here we see them happening amen therefore this is in itself not signs and wonders and miracles but the word being made flesh am this is what anoints the bre not wanting to see uh horses and uh Angels no uhuh to see that that's spoken word he spoke it men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded for out of the mouth of God and when the bride elected lady that's bathing down in the love of God sees the word it moves up over natural walls and brother she begins to LEAP up and begins to add to her faith virtue and patience and Temperance and godliness and brotherly kindness Hallelujah and the others is wanding around looking down why because she's got binoculars the Old Testament and the New Testament and binoculars are the see far away not to put their ha on the ground uh raise up the standard and look far off at the promise of God and the bride looks far away she sees herself as a perfect bride perfect maners of God she don't look at present tense amen praise God wish I wasn't so tired praise God Amen she her faith what a little seed hanging in there is Anointed to believe she can live a Godly life I can do it I will go I H I won't cut my hair no more I'll let my dresses because grow down whatever it is I'll stop smoking or whatever it is the minute and I'll live a Godly life I can do

the an you supposed to teach you that it's said brother Faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see these dirty nasty things here it it looks not at these things amen Faith looks to see what God wants hallel there it is I don't care what you want I don't care what you say You Preach too hard or what I want to know what this God want me to say I ain't interested in your ideas I'm only interested in what he says I'm not interested in nobody's ideas sitting here no matter what you think who you think you are I'm not interested in none of your ideas I'm only interested in what God want he says sanctify him by the word of God call out those Spirits call out the filthiness proclaim the word of God for the days are evil and the night is far spent and the morning is at hand hallelujah amen Lord praise God faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly to what God wants that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done you hear what I said amen no matter what you think now and whoever's called lord what did you say oh this is what you're supposed to do get out of my way flesh and here it comes cuz that's what God wants am amen faith is a long range Vision it looks a far off and sees the promise amen it don't low stand it it's sight it don't put it down here on the ground ain't looking looking off that's where it's for a binoculars to look down there to bring it in close amen it's a telescope it looks a far off amen it picks up God's binoculars the old and the New Testament and it sees every promise he made every every one of them and then Faith sees it out Y and it chooses the promises like Moses did hallelujah amen he he esteemed the promise of God higher than the things of the world he could have been Pharaoh all the popularity the women the money he could had all of that but he esteemed The Riches of Christ Greater by faith he looked out there and head of bride is in the same spot today by faith you young children by faith you better look through the word of God Amen and choose what is right you know it's right you know what is right you know it and you'll be beaten by many stripes for coming in here and hearing the word of God and then go outside and doing what you're doing that's exactly right he's no respect of persons so you better check up Faith Knows by Revelation what God wants done in the meantime to reach that goal separation obedience Holiness p it and meanwhile When Faith begins to add that word what God wants it begins to become impregnated they laugh at you they mock they scarf look at you see in the tapes and this and that see the man they laughing at you you're trying to take every word and they laughing deonal ones a sister because try to look like a saint they they're calling women they'll laugh at her every time absolutely and the brother who's trying trying to to do what's right the call men will laugh at him laugh at every time there's two groups in the house of God see but nevertheless that bride material begins to apply the word begins to add to his faith begins to apply the word his life by faith St John 8:31 ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free that right now watch this the application of this truth will bring us freedom I said the application of this truth will bring us freedom now watch the knowledge of this truth alone will only bring us frustration now that's what's wrong in this message today the application brings Freedom you're free amen the Son of God the son of word the son of man makes You Free by the word you're not bound no more see but to know the tapes to know what happened with the cloud in 1963 to know the books to know what brother Bram or because because what he's done to know these things means nothing alone without the application of what he has sent to your personal everyday life that's right see and so therefore for some strange reason or reason they hesitate to apply it to their own hearts and lives rather than yield their lives to the full sway of Jesus Christ the whole word the whole message see allow him to dictate the policies and the purpose of their lives not just going when you feel like going to certain Affairs and so forth and the families and things did you ask Jesus Christ because should you go first that's having full swing asking the Lord first may I go is it all right for me to go amen amen I hope you can get it or just did before you say anything as rightous against somebody did that God's will say that there or do certain things because hurt people and so forth that God's will see therefore they Shuffle on through life sometimes up and sometimes down sometimes in disgust other times in in despair they become despondent and downhearted because they never are dependent upon Jesus Christ the word that's right see you must apply the word besides knowing the message there the knowledge of this message and there's the application of the truth there you can know the message and apply the truth and you can know the message and don't apply the truth and be an intellectual believer so therefore friends God has never stopped pouring out the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost you should be on your knees day and night asking God to to fill you with the Holy Ghost absolutely you should you wouldn't be around any old carnal a telephone conversation you'd be on your knees if you really knew what because Abraham knew but lot didn't know it see and there he was down there until till God come down the voice of the Archangel come on the Earth itself and pully yanked them out of there and the prophet said that the bright says come that's right amen come see amen so now how many can see this morning see Faith moves out and claims in the light the promises of God what light Malachi 4 light amen Malachi 4 sharing light upon every promise and the faith seeds so it you mean I can actually have virtue and patience and Temperance I can have the Capstone in my life yes my daughter brother get out the way and move forward and claim it cuz you look way down to see it and the others in the church in the message got the same tapes knowledge and everything else don't do that they Live In the Flesh they allow the flesh to because take them over and then they move right along shuffling along in the church out of the church sometimes up sometimes down but that seat of God glory to God is moving on moving on taking every word doing every word it makes mistakes see it makes mistakes but it believes every word amen amen it keeps moving see to me now it don't feel satisfied cuz it's saved satisfied because it's saved reminds me of the ministry here I have a note here about because about the ministry here many seek to find out ministers I'm speaking about now many Minister seek to find out how many imperfections and carnal traits are allowable a liable because allowable in religion but few seek to bring Christians to the height of the Gospel standard you got to live it first if you want to bring some up there the early Church St Mark 16:15 in action and the unlimits of the promises of God the measure of the Statue of fullness is sell mention much less demonstrated they don't hard even mention in this message at all you go anywhere you won't find a mention that's right while the stature of littleness emptiness and powerlessness of Christianity is often emphasized and demonstrated uh cuz you know you're filthy I ain't got nothing I a I ain't got nothing and so forth and we hear the Malachi you're a liar you ain't got nothing Malachi 4 Shine the Light Up on every promise and you ain't got you a liar if you say you ain't got God don't do nothing for me and I ain't got nothing here you are a liar amen because he's he cannot lie he's shineing the spirit the light up on every word and you must take your sword out of the and step forward and cut your way for every promise you got to do it amen and Faith moves out in that light and claims it I've seen people come here to uh this this country this message here and get blessed in it get jobs and so forth and money and that's all you want the so pottage that's all you want you don't and you don't even want eternal life turn it down for a good job here that's all they want brother you better wake up how many see this morning that Jesus Christ prayed for you to be perfect in one well I'm talking to to you this morning there amen Christ was now when Christ was ready to go forward to die on the cross his greatest trial he was comforted to Father glorify me with the glory that I had before amen before his prehuman days he had a glory amen the word moving around the light he said glorify him with that Glory so the thought of that Glory comforted Christ then let us the glory that we had before our prehuman days and was in his thoughts let that this morning comfort you this morning friends as we move out now into this great cycle out here amen praise God listen friends don't be weary and don't be down this is the word of God going on here this morning amen and this is what it's supposed to do but now by faith you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you got to believe that now when you come into the Lord in prayer God doesn't see you he hears your voice through the blood of Jesus Christ he doesn't see you he only hears your voice through the blood the blood ain't there I mean God you couldn't even stand there are you foll me now and his blood was shed around this world there was a possibility everybody could be saved bootleggers and everybody else see me now everybody could be say while the blood circle around the Earth but one day that blood went into the word and the word come down are you following me now there is the blood in every word see other word it was going around the earth like it here then all of a sudden the Seven Seals was revealed and the blood went into the word and the word slipped down on the earth amen for the predestinated ones who would obey every word and they under the blood yes I hope you see it amen as they take every word they're taking the blood and the father doesn't see them because the blood in that word is a bumper between God and you amen praise God he hears your voice through the blood of J he doesn't see you now now watch a word scripture live voice of the Bride speaks to God through the blood all already judged at Calvary you already judged already see and your life is here with Christ in God he don't see you he hears your voice speaking back you're living the word you're asking knocking and receiving Hallelujah and the brother is there he he hears our voice and the blood is there to represent see what you ask for that's right then he hears my voice and he sees only the blood and now you say see only the blood yes the Blood Washed ones got a voice because Abel had a voice that right and the voice spoke that right I was from the blood that because Cain shed is that right well Christ's blood was shed and our voice speaks out from that blood and that and and and our voice is Luther's voice Wesley's voice Pentecostal voice and now the bride voice hallelujah amen praise God so you have nothing to do with it is the seed of God which is a spirit the Holy Spirit speaking back see where you pray by the Holy Spirit don't you and then the holy spirit in you ask the father for certain things amen and then the father hears the voice speaking through the blood you ain't got nothing to do with it all you've been bought with a price you're a slave to Jesus Christ the blood has cleansed you so perfect taken your sins and Carri them far away am there's a chasm in between I hope you see it friendsall there's no need to look down but this word like this here is preached to keep certain people honest see the bride you don't have to talk to the bride like that the bride she's waiting for the word it's a love affair with the bride and that speaking the truth and love is just coming forth something now for the bride amen the Capstone is coming down to make love to the bride through every word praise our god thank you Lord hallelujah I'm so happy that we can uh uh uh move up one octave High to get away from this stuff here amen hacking and chopping and telling to stop talking about this and stop doing this here what the babies where's the bride at she's growing up brother are you catching what I'm saying this morning you don't have to tell a bride these things ABCs you mean in 1971 you got to tell the bride to stop cutting her hair to lower her dress to talk right and act right and do no the bride has turned from green to Golden Brown amen that's right that's right see so now as we live the word we're under the blood and we now live means to apply the truth to your life not know the message see amen now this is is rough here this morning but it is to be this way now the Revelation now of who Jesus Christ is makes us one with God now there's seven unities here to be kept for the blood-washed ones there they are one body they are one Spirit they're one body they ain't going to hurt one another that's to be kept not talked about and know it or or I'm in the body but to your brother and sister you ain't in this body how in the world can you stay have your own body how could you beat your own self are you in the body amen so this is to be kept one body one Spirit the Holy Spirit one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God that's to be kept not talked about through knowledge of the tapes and books and so forth but kept lived applied hallelujah amen the Min they have seven duties here in Ephesians here perfect the Saints verse 12 all the work of the ministry verse 12 and by the Christ verse 12 unify men in the faith verse 13 unify men in the doctrine perfect the church in Christ and bring men to maturity that's the five4 ministry and and it's now it's only a means toward an end the end is maturity and the minister is a means chastisement is a means also toward an end if you being chastised being whipped around a little bit The Father loves you oh yeah I had to beat little Jonathan this morning he want to have his way and we going to have our way oh yeah but I love him that's for his own good Hallelujah so therefore the father has to whip you around a little bit it's only a means toward an end and the end is maturity yes amen praise God sorrow you have sorrow is only a means toward an end thank you amen that you might know what he knew a man of sorrow acquainted with grief praise our God isn't it wonderful to identify ourselves with him in grief am and and suffering and all these things that when we come forward we can say that we were in him we walk where he walked hallu amen we talk what he talked we did what he did that's why these things are it's only a means toward an end it'll perfect you and establish you in the faith amen praise God the seven blessings of of perfection maturity no more children establishing the Faith No More doubtful mind or for to and fro like waves number three rooted and grounded in truth no more carried about by Winds of Doctrine number four freedom from a deception able to discern truth from error knowledge of course you know to know because right from wrong ability number five ability to speak the truth in love number six constant growth in spiritual things number seven harmony with all others verse 16 now notice in closing I have something here because I want to say notice this great chapter Ephesians 4 here verse 12 something Lord showed me here God's intention here in verse 12 here now there's many men talking about the Fire full ministry back and forth well we always left that alone if you are a minister well then you know you're Minister you don't have to go around saying I'm in the Fire full ministry that's silly do I have to ground and say I'm Joe Coleman I'm Joe Coleman you know I'm I'm joman you know see that's the same thing you know I am Joan I know who I am am well I've been placed here by by the holy spirit amen therefore I know I'm a minister here I don't have to tell you because I'm a minister you know I know who I am amen if you're a daughter of God you know you're a daugh of God you know you've been born again and passed from death into life you know that God only hears your voice the spirit voice inside speaking through the blood amen you know you make mistakes but he put that blood there for your mistakes oh the blood of Jesus it washes us white as snow huah the blood is for your mistakes but you believe every word there's your unbelief believe every word hallelujah that's why we cry out when that spirit moves through here there's no Holy Ghost you don't believe the word and they don't know it there's no more ministers you don't believe the word you make mistakes now but that's the blood is for that but you don't believe the word but then you're unbeliever and they can't get that there well law got to reveal it to them amen see now verse 12 here he gave some Apostles and Prophets and pastors teach now they're only a means toward an end now see and God's intentions here was three things here that they would per it was for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the one Ministry for the edifying of the body uh edifying the body of Christ excuse me and I begin to read this here and then begin to open up it was for the perfecting the five for minist started on the day of Pentecost and was to go all the way down through to I now and it's for three things here for the perfecting for the full equipping of the Saints to equip the saints of God with the word and for the work of the ministry of course because because evangelists and missionaries and so forth see but it was to properly equip the saints of God for service so the word is preach to tell you how to be in service with God tell the women how to be in service tell the men how to be in service tell the children how to be in service so the fire for Ministry is for that intention to bring God's word to you to tell you how to be in service and then when you do what's in the Bible then you you in God's service amen praise the Lord therefore it was forth to build up the body see now watch verse 13 here till we all come in unity of the faith other words the five for minut was to be here all down through arenius polycarp Columba St Martin and then down to Luther and then the the cor went down in the ground then come up a blade it was to be here till it developed and the blade had to develop the the tassel the sh still develop in the 5 minutes is still here on till verse 13 till we come into the unity of the faith and they didn't have it they had all kind of streams out so then verse 13 you needed Malachi 4 to bring back the faith you needed Malachi 4 to give you a knowledge of the Son of God through the Seven Seals because we had knowledge Through The Bishop's idea and the church's idea so verse 13 here had to be here until Malachi 4 come forward to bring us back to this Unity of the with the word word to give us a a a a seven sealed knowledge of the Son of God his Mysteries his secrets and then this in itself will bring you to a perfect man and the perfect man is the measure amen of the fullness of Jesus Christ for the bride amen amen so we see it then until we attain this Oneness here the ministry was a build up or develop the body until it come on down here until we will arrive at real maturity and then uh uh what is the real purpose so when you get to this real maturity like right now that you'll be no more toss to and fro like children verse 14 for the past eight years they've been running out to Arizona down to Florida over here up and down TOS to and fro they don't even know what's even going on see the me now but when they would come to maturity and in Christ the campstone would come down and then speak the truth in love and point every soul into Jesus Christ and then each joint with the proper function in there with the Holy Ghost upon them would edify one another and grow up into him in every way he is the head amen amen praise God Hall so then uh and and there would be no more tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine and with the slay of men now this word here slay of men means uh has to do with cubes and cubes is Dice that's right and it says here because I saw in the Greek they said that the dice are loaded and these men would walk into the church with loaded Dice and throw it out and you can't win you all know that how can you win against loaded dice well how can you win against an antichrist who comes in with loaded Dice and comes in preaching the message but when it comes out it's twisted off so if if they fool around with loaded dice they can't win if you fooled around with these doctrines these ideas go out here and do this here no more this no more that you can't win cuz it's the Slayer man's hand amen praise the Lord I hope you see it and that's why we belt you out and nail you to the wall tell you to get away from there that's right don't you know about sheep when a sheep eats the wrong food because it stomach blows up and the shepherd must take a knife and stick it into his gut and let out the gas that's right so sometimes some get the wrong food so we take that knife and RAM it in there no more no more H go how it ghost amen now this is true you know amen the sheep eat wrong food and it they they blow up for gas and the shepherd actually takes a knife and sticks it in their stomach and it lets the ear out that's how all the gas I mean TI I mean amen praise all God that's right see so therefore the bride is to come to maturity that they won't be tossed no more to and fro and deceived by these guys and brother brother Hunt knows we got some things that is is deceit as very likely if possible in this message that's right so we finally won't be no more children so therefore the real purpose God has promised to send the Dynamics and the mechanic we would be no more children you see it now therefore we will come and then the truth will go forth in love for only through love can you be built up and edified so therefore we other words it's like um to me it comes to me like this here uh cuz you women wash clothes you got to wash the clothes in full of soap ring them out amen washing of the Water by the word that right and then when you hang them up to dry and dry out the went so therefore you've been Washed by the Water of the word and now it's time to hang out to wash in the Sun out there amen let it dry out now amen praise the Lord we've been Washed by the Water of the word and now it's time that full powerful sun to come down and dry us out by every word amen amen praise the Lord page 363 uh uh uh uh 7 Church age says this a bride will mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word Colossians 3:14 said that finally put on charity which is the Capstone and the Capstone is the strength of every virtue and we have we can't move without and charity never faileth we fail and make mistakes until charity he comes did you get it so if you want hang around what I did yesterday I feel sorry for you cuz until charity comes forth that anointing in his fullness the measure the perfect man amen and anoint you with that fullness you will make mistakes amen because but charity never faileth this time you'll do nothing except your father show you amen therefore you can't make a mistake if the father comes down and shows you a step and you step in it and you stand until you have thus saith the Lord Brother Bram said on be certain of God I think it was page 17 he said that the widow woman turn and bake me a cake first and she turned in obedience he said every man every woman loves to hear the thunder of God from the the prophet's mouth and the Thunder of God is thus sayith the Lord so the voice of God is coming forward thus sayith the Lord the Thunder of God Amen amen praise our God so now this happened here this Oneness here that we would be no more children we're not meant to remain as children see and we and we are meant to hold firmly to the truth in Love Got To Be In Love now and grow up in every way into Christ ahead and that's what he said on on the six hour tape on the prophecy there that when he gets a virgin bride in her thinking Amen in her thinking see no other seed laying in in in the womb but Christ then he'll take that a bride and he'll bring the manifestation of the word right through her womb and the world will see Jesus Christ in spiritual form again the word made flesh and it'll be every word so therefore we only come to the point now where we are ready to be used we are ready to be made manifest as the word and then the word goes forward as my father sent me so I send you my word amen and then the word goes forward drying out ripening to every word that he shows the bride and then she becomes the word in the resurrection for the Resurrection comes forward himself Jesus Christ and and the dead in Christ and he said I am the resurrection in the bride in the resurrection and I am the life amen so you the word that is living is walking into the resurrection and becomes the word the life oh praise God do you know what I'm saying this morning friends brother you should be hitting the ceiling there that we in this age are given the rare privil Paul wish he could be in this age here then when it moves on into the resurrection it becomes the word itself Eternal lifeu on the earth clothed over Hallelujah with ET then you go to your theophany hallelujah amen praise God well friend the hour is close amen so now we see then therefore the the truth is to be spoken in love it's been hacking and chopping and cutting away the greenness see but by faith the bride saw the word be made manifest through all the political things the Natural Things the filthiness the sodomites the Hypes and the black power the Bri saw these things coming to pass cuz the prophet said these things that was the word be made flesh in the bride she hear the tape she Rejoice to see it she sees it she sees the word of God being made uh flesh in judgment and there's another group who waiting for Supernatural when they see the supernatural then they find give me the oil it's another group but if you are the group this morning of the Bride your own life mut tells what you are this morning how you live when you go home that's what you are now that's the word when you go out of here what you have to say in your mouth and what's in your heart if it's against anybody in here and your home if is if it's all filthy and full of TV and everything else that's way you live that's that's what you are that's how you are see I'm speak I'm speaking about especially husbands here if they have these things in their home of course there a wife she got a husband well that that's his house you see but I'm saying you as individuals here is how you live when you go out of here some might slip in here and drop down their because dresses it happens and they go outside and put on those real nice numbers that they love so who you kidding this morning you know what I'm talking about this morning cuz you know at at you're doing it right now and who I'm speaking to knows that exactly who I'm speaking to I ain't talking to the bride now see I'm talking to those who would do anything had to be washed of these things here see cuz some probably some easygoing Sidewinder has the loaded Dice and threw them out there you saw seven thought it was all right you know amen praise God so therefore the the body note here the whole gospel which is the center around Christ builds the church into a working unit to throw off all error or waste so as to sustain itself like the human body now watch what he's saying this is verse 16 see every part now watch the Dynamics comes forward brings the truth when the spirit of Truth has come it'll bring everything to your remembrance amen that right all the things that I told you through my Prophet the things you couldn't understand but you believed it anyway and you got anointed and you leap over walls Hallelujah cuz you believe it when the spirit of Truth has come it'll bring it back to your remembrance and I'll reveal it to you Hallelujah and it'll be made flesh in you and you'll understand it amen and then you with the other one getting the same Revelation the word of God is working in you it's working in you it's working in you and you nuring one another and you build up each other in love edify one another in love amen it be in America in Africa all around the world when you meet one edify nurture he up amen this love point out speaking the truth in love Psalms and hymns with Melody in a heart with in love Hallelujah is a love affair amen amen praise God then will come forth a visible manifestation of a true church Christ prayer perfect and one will be the bride manifested in unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and a perfect man the measure of it will be the fullness of Jesus Christ and that's what he prayed for and that's what it's going to be that we will be no more children up to this time not sure whether to leave the world or stay in the world or but brother so and so said that just go into the resurrection to the tent and all your dirty ways of be gone so they're thinking about that and it's all right here I chopped it off to you that's one of them that's right absolutely just do what you want to do now just don't cut your hair dress down neatly coey your husband and go into the resurrection in the tent and all your dirty ways will be gone he'll speak it away isn't that wonderful show it to me in the word of God and they love to have it so prophesied that to me or he was was with the prophet why that guy he don't know anything about nothing what does he know see roll the dice on you amen see come back to the word of God Washed by the Water of the word of God hallelujah there's no other way to go in other than through the word of God Amen how close are we friends I'm closing out now I want to shake you up to see how close we are do you love him do you understand what I'm saying this morning amen well this is sound like bride material here praise God Amen brother brandham now I just talk to you a little bit a little ice cream brother Brandon 1955 around about October he had a tent Vision which was the word of the Lord and I always believe that the tent Vision was the uh symbol for the third pool because each seal there had a symbol a white horse rider went forward symbol form a red horse W the symbol form see the Jews on be up on the alt symbol form see and when he opened the Sixth Seal all the symol form see but there was nothing for the seventh seal but I believe this was a symbol right here the attent vision see in symbol form see and it's thus saith the Lord see now that came to him about October 55 somewhere through there when he just finished up and uh they ran into the red because in the meeting in the second pool there and God was finishing up so then now he had to wait he knew it was coming to pass with the squirrels and because assister had right and all these things he had to wait and December 1962 was over seven full years in a month or so seven years he had to wait 7 years he had to ripen are you following me now the Malachi for seed was in him the tent Vision came to him the word of the Lord came to him but he had to wait and ripen for seven full years and about December 62 he was picked up of course right there in his home and seven angels came to him then he went out to Arizona in February and so forth 63 and the cloud came in February and the sword came into his hand this was in the eighth year and then he opened the Seven Seals in the eighth year and then he was still drying out drying out moving around waiting why could I speak the Third Exodus and all and the token and so forth still waiting then he said himself in December 63 he said the book is open the seven seal book just waiting for the the seven seal Christ The Sword to be identified to his coming and then one day in June 64 he said the unveiling the Mighty God so all in all between 55 around about October to about December or 65 was about 10 years and one or two months all that time uh ripening and drying out and Christ was made manifest through God's Prophet well since 1963 the bride March up to now this is the eighth year we're ready to move into the ninth year in March 63 we've been also drying out and ripening same thing for the Seven Seals Vision came to us in March 63 and we know it's right and we know it has to do with the bribe but you had to wait for it just like he had to wait had to dry out all these years ripen all and believe the word of God and now and strange as it may seem I don't say it because it's got to happen I don't know when the r should be I don't know I ain't set any dates but if it should go to about March or April 73 it would be exactly 10 years also if it should go I don't know it because they don't have to go that far see because we know that the uh uh uh the bridegroom is given at least one year to be with his bride in the Old Testament because D because Deuteronomy at the wedding supper and so forth absolutely so we don't know we at any time but I'm only trying to bring something to you you understand now how close are we now um 1968 uh April 68 president johnon on March 34 31st he announced on TV and radio that he would not seek reelection for the presidential office and it shook up everybody the whole world and and then on April the 1st that was in the newspapers well from all of us know from April the 1st 1968 every kind of a natural seed was sold in ' 68 even right on down to the Vietnam peace SE seed in December 68 everyone was sold all you know that natural the church everything else and so forth then 1969 came forth this a rightness of of natural seeds science reached its climax they went to the moon is that right they went to the moon they reached a ripeness a maturity and then they went to the moon the sodomites and the Manson murder and Woodstock reached their maturity they can't get any more wicked they reached their op Pinnacle in 1969 the sodomite spirit and all you know that and this this case is still going on see because has reached it already and even uh these singers I think one was Janice Joplin and uh I think because Hendricks both of them within maybe a week and a half apart they were gone they're finished with other words that spirit that started back in the 60s has come to its rightness its maturity it's here now we see it you accept it is that right and and but 69 brought forth a rightness the Harvest comes in the tribulation period but it's right and the tears and the wicked ripen first that's right see okay SS sodomites a religion the purpose of the Pope and the World Council came to its rightness in June 1969 in Geneva Switzerland when the pope went and sat down with the World Council of churches headquarters and he spoke there is that right and he also came to right with labor for about a week later labor was there also having a big worldwide a convention and he spoke there also see and of course this one in sports the Mets this was was nothing silly now see the Mets showed in man's I'm talking about man's intellect is science man's body is sports that right so therefore the greatest uh Sports achievement in this country was the Mets or what they did and you already know the numbers 6 and9 all these things here amen I leave it just like that cuz it got some people so mad see now politics Kennedy 69 you knew the whole thing is that right 69 a July that right see so now man reached his peak in these fields of endeavor it was a ripeness and that now is just leveling off just waiting that's all waiting for the fires of God's Wrath that's all but has come to a ripeness and we see it every day now that was 68 and 69 that was natural and religious now we come to the bride amen 1970 brother Perry green told me he said in last December he said brother Joe I believe that 1970 will be the the year for the greatest spreading out of this gospel spreading forth of the Gospel so well praise God in February I think it was God allowed him to re to get the film The Deep calleth unto the deep his Vindication there see and man don't understand it see but the God wanted the son of man to be shown on film and had it HD away for over 16 years and allowed brother per green to get it for he had the vision to spread forth the message in 1970 he even came here after 18 days in December 24th here that right after 18 days the 24th see I'll leave it like that came here and from his tour and this country amen and told us here uh what happened in 1970 and we knew anyway cuz he had been here before and it went to Australia all over the world it was the year of the greatest spreading forth of the Gospel the message was 1970 now we have left natural now natural was 68 69 amen amen we mve into spiritual now amen you catching me all right 1970 now uh many of you know Joseph's prophecy back in Genesis seven years of aing and sewing and also reaping that right and Stor up the graen into the greeneries for 7 years 6369 7 years but then the second set of seven years is a famine amen and then Joseph said open it up spread it out to the world they're starving out there amen 1970 it was opened up and spread out the film of the son of man Vindicated it and out it went to vindicate the message praise our God now I ask you this here will 1971 be bring forth the spiritual ripeness like 69 brought forth the natural ripeness it remains to be seen amen amen and if it will how close are we even the the numers 6 and9 May don't understand it I don't stand the full Revelation myself but why did uh uh Israel be be given I show you all the way through the Bible 6 and9 Israel had to be given 69 weeks that right 69 weeks after the 69th week Messiah shall be cut off and there'll be one week left I mean one half a week left because he preached three and A2 years but after 69 weeks Messiah come and and he preached three and half years of the last week but but it was after 69 weeks that he come that right and here we are 1969 1970 is here now see and what does all mean I can't tell you but I know one thing the hour is close and that's why I preach the way I preached this morning we know that nine has something to do with life nine gifts nine fruits of spirit a woman nine months to bring forth a baby and many other nines so I don't understand the whole thing but I know it has something to do with God and what he's trying to show do you love him do you understand this morning friends what we're trying to bring you to the hour is very very close and I had to come down and rebuke the children for we I see the way they're going some of them going out and into uh things of the world here dope and things like this here and so therefore and then with that filthy ungodly worldly talk in their homes and so forth and popping fingers and all kind of filthiness and old enough to know better than that so therefore had to come down and to rebuke that thing it's the spirit of the world to get and you should do the same thing in your homes really you live the life and then present that to God you live the life if you all mixed up you ain't sure yourself whether you want go in the world yourself or or be come back to God how you think your children are going to be when they they have to be by your Sanctified life you keep them and if you ain't sure if you all mixed up toss to and fro back and forth how can your children be right if they don't have an experience with God now that's the Bible that's right so therefore what have you to say my son is doing this here my daughter what have you to say you got nothing to to show forth yourself that's right friends you see so only it's only God's grace I don't say that because of what is going on my family but it's I thank God every day all I can do is try to live it myself my wife and I and I present Joan Rebecca to the lord I can't do no more cuz there's a spirit upon the children today of rebellion is in the deal little babies it's a spirit as in the world and the only way it can stop it is you live a Sanctified life and still you're fighting you're fighting every day that's right it's a powerful spirit it's up on the little children so Friends The Hours come to really know where we are don't you know what happened here the other day here and uh uh the uh they found a uh the uh the bones of a man that was crucified that right and it came out this year don't you know what that means this year that they should cuz they they found a man in ' 68 but they just now Pro because what it was and like because put it all together and it was they had the first material evidence of a crucifixion that's natural brother will 71 bring the evidence of a spiritual crucifixion the word made flesh when you see Christ in your brother and sister you'll know that that person is walking about in a state of crucifixion I hope I don't know what else to say to you then two sisters or two brothers if you can't live together something is wrong with you if I see like sisters here living in their homes and so forth and and don't want to die out in your flesh and maybe somebody a be a befriend you take you into the home and you don't want to act like a Christian you you need to be washed and repent and come to the altar if we can't live together as brothers and sisters and husbands and wives something's wrong with us but brother Jesus Christ prayed that there we might be perfect in one and is going to be a bride and this bride won't never have to be told by some man or some Minister somebody what you did the bride knows what she did and if she makes a mistake she quickly repents of it she don't come to repent saying well I was told to do this the Bride Comes cuz her Lord told her to do it her Lord gave a little nudge not some man tell her that's only that's the second thing that's just to because keep keep things honest that's all this what we're doing here is to keep it honest keep it clean that we can have a house of God that's why the word preach this way but the anointing should tell you should we should walk through that door there in a state of uh crucifixion brother what a power will sweep through here Jesus Christ himself now let us take these things in this morning friends 68 6970 is this the year I don't know but brother we Mighty close amen am let us walk in the light [Music] beautiful come where the do drop Mercy shine bright oh shine Us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world all together now we walk the light beautiful light come where to drops of Mercy shine bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus light of the world we walk in the light [Applause] Bea where do drops of Mercy shine bright shine all Us by day and by night Jesus the world you want to know how close it is got a little nugget here from letting off the pressure Green Lake Wisconsin not the one tonight but another one out the same message but preached somewhere else this is a quote from Brother bramman 1962 I've lived to see the day that every promise he made I've seen it fulfilled the seeding time is over here the only place to seow seeds is in the Foreign Fields this is a gleaning over the stubble it's all over the next thing will be the will be of getting that little group together and now watch in a month or so she'll be gone and soon as she's gathered together we're at the end there's no hopes left anywhere nowhere run to Christ people is later than you think there this is this is the time episcopalians Etc are coming to buy oil every Star to the church age every Angel to the church has done made its manifestation salvation has traveled from the East to the West like the sun and now the Sun the same Holy Spirit have fell on the day of Pentecost is falling in the west nothing left to what not but a gleaning time here stubble the gospel was to go out friends that's what God thought about America here and this has been the hardest time to preach to these past eight years to to to to bring it to that Bride for the intellectual spirit that fought every inch of the way that just wanted to know about the tapes and so forth um and if you don't have the Holy Ghost I tell you with all that's within me you seek God to you are filled with the Holy Ghost just don't take a dry interpretation you meet that light you better be certain of God do you hear what he said here he said the next thing we'll be getting that little group together and a month or so that's exactly what he told Billy Paul and per green he said that it'll be up on the earth for about a month or so that Resurrection the dead in Christ will walk this Earth for about a month or so getting together in groups oh praise God just getting together as the song says I got an uncle over there I got an aunt over there I got a brother over there praise our God getting together and brother Bram said this here that Jesus Christ and his wisdom wouldn't as we are gathered together wouldn't let us go without being gathered together in families in groups so he'll gather the family in groups in about a month or so they'll be gathered together amen and then it come a blast out of the sky come on up praise God hallelujah what an hour don't miss it I cry out to you this morning from 12 years old about that and up don't you miss it don't you think because you're 14 or 15 that you don't have to do God is holding you accountable for every word of God in this church here you and all you young children here every single last one of you so if you want to live in the world well you go ahead and live in the world but therefore you know where you're walking you know exactly where you're walking today so therefore husband and wives and elders and deacons and everybody else the hour is short we're right here it's got to go out of here I believe before 73 and it don't have to go that long so therefore how much time is left and that's why I'm preaching with all my heart the way I am amen so I trust and pray that you are or the bride that want to be made perfect in one not some phony business coming and sitting here doesn't mean nothing it's what you do in your home and out the street that don't you can you can because here and because impersonate Hallelujah your because all your hair is down your dress is down I don't mean nothing what's in that hard and then get on the telephone and talk against one another and so forth you prove it right and God he watches that there we just look at the flesh here but God look at the spirit in the heart so therefore sanctify yourself you don't need no man to tell you that you're supposed to go and make things right you know what the very fact if you on the telephone or doing these things wrong is against God you know it's wrong therefore go and make a real repentance and so forth see but the hour is close friends so I trust and pray you understand this morning's message amen try to bring to you the reality of the time we're living in the night is far spent the day is at hand let us cast off the works of darkness and if there's something that we need to say is wrong we'll say it's wrong otherwise God has not even received it shall We Stand praise our God Amen Let Us bow our heads in a word of Prayer
