[25:11] to take two more messages out of there
[25:13] and preach one October 7th and possibly
[25:17] the 21st any man that's what he told me
[25:20] so less from endeavoring to do today
[25:23] from the same inspiration amen
[25:25] but this he was a dream here brother
[25:30] Paloma I was looking through my cell my
[25:32] affection and this just fell out the
[25:35] other day here and it's 1974 right after
[25:39] that the seventh under revival we had in
[25:41] New York City and on Tuesday December
[25:44] 31st dream brother Coleman was teaching
[25:47] the entire church was before him there
[25:50] were two feels exactly like the same
[25:52] science exactly the same science one on
[25:54] his right and one on his left he was
[25:57] speaking by planting seeds pointing to
[25:59] the feet on the right he said you see
[26:01] the seeds were planted here but the
[26:03] conditions just were not just right and
[26:07] everyone looked on that field they've
[26:08] seen to be surprised because it was
[26:10] totally barren then brother Coleman turn
[26:13] in pointing to the other field to his
[26:15] left he said the seed was planted here
[26:18] in all conditions was perfect always a
[26:21] good ground give it see everything was
[26:25] done just right and everyone turned to
[26:28] look they were amazed to see huge crops
[26:30] it stood very tall and they occupied
[26:33] every part of that land so that you
[26:35] couldn't even see the dirt anymore it
[26:39] seemed this crop was mature now listen
[26:44] seconds message and almost ready for his
[26:48] harvest so may God make you almost ready
[26:53] for the harness praise God thank you
[26:57] brother Bellomo I held on to that that's
[26:59] exactly what I did from the seventh
[27:01] under inspiration I caught it and I got
[27:03] the seeds and I planted them seeds from
[27:11] the seventh under inspiration Malachi
[27:13] fourth message that's all what I've been
[27:16] doing if you had read the same books you
[27:19] know what I was doing see the word is
[27:24] the word sees the Prophet says I come as
[27:28] for his riches sita and elijah comes he
[27:31] will plant the seed of the entire Bible
[27:34] from Genesis through revelation then if
[27:38] he goes into the Bible and pulls
[27:40] messages out that is the spoken word
[27:43] this Bible has a spoken word that right
[27:47] in Malachi and for the Son of man in him
[27:49] we'll pull the spoken word and then
[27:53] speak it through Malachi for smile then
[27:55] the spoken word revealed by the word in
[27:58] the prophet
[28:03] yes I'm saying the spoken word from
[28:07] James the revelation is revealed by the
[28:09] Son of Man in the Prophet for the spoken
[28:12] word reveal by the word reveals the word
[28:21] then this is a reveal word then this is
[28:25] now our word see and these ought to see
[28:31] that are planted and these seeds were to
[28:37] bring you down to a certain day when you
[28:40] were supposed to go back to the Bible
[28:44] other words no fall hitting women you
[28:47] understand back to the Bible
[28:50] other words you're hanging over hell by
[28:51] one word back to the Bible but this
[28:55] brings you back you get so oriented with
[29:00] this that's all you can think of as this
[29:07] then I that's a that's a feel that I
[29:09] plan on the left they're the ones on the
[29:13] left-hand side for the Bellomo a huge
[29:15] crop praise God
[29:18] they almost ready they were right but
[29:22] see when June you may be seated in June
[29:24] 30 you become your right
[29:27] but you're still wet so you're not ready
[29:30] for the harvest just yet the garner so
[29:33] it needs a hot July Sun to come down and
[29:37] fake you out
[29:42] think I want all the lust for money the
[29:45] lust for the world the love for business
[29:46] the lust for this the lust for that take
[29:49] it out of you from today on Oh
[29:53] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[30:00] a man may be seated so that's what I did

[30:13] the CD vinyl amen

[30:25] in July from about you I first saw you
[30:28] I told you many times the farmer does
[30:30] not listen the Lord of the harvest the
[30:34] Holy Ghost does not even come out into
[30:36] the fields because it's green why would
[30:40] he walk out there the Holy Ghost itself
[30:44] when he know that's his seed the wheat
[30:46] is a seed and he prescribed before the
[30:49] Sun in the world that they had to go
[30:50] through certain stages
[30:53] so while you wanna look for the dynamics
[30:55] way back when you couldn't even take it

[1:33:43] bang bang bang bang until it comes to
[1:33:45] the Holy Spirit's help
[1:33:50] I don't know
[1:33:53] France God is right in front of you I'm
[1:33:56] rerun out of the book here for the
[1:33:59] spirit the best of the Holy Ghost was in
[1:34:01] Paul's age in arenas and Martin Columbo
[1:34:03] and so forth and then the Holy Spirit
[1:34:05] came up a blade a mentor of Portia the
[1:34:08] Holy Spirit and Luther amen Wesley who
[1:34:11] what happened in the great open door on
[1:34:13] the other side over here come in just
[1:34:16] between Wesley he'd open to over there
[1:34:19] and I filled up in church age and you
[1:34:22] read it I got it oh go ahead of myself
[1:34:25] here revelation three seven and eight
[1:34:28] I set before thee an open door and a
[1:34:31] prophet nails it down it is not in the
[1:34:34] Wesleyan age not in the Laodicean age
[1:34:36] the open door was which was between
[1:34:39] that's why you can have a Welsh revival
[1:34:41] between hallelujah praise God I said
[1:34:46] before your open door the deity of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ the baptism in Jesus name
[1:34:52] the peppers of the Holy Ghost I've said
[1:34:53] it before you no man can open no man can
[1:34:56] shut it friends got in this bin here
[1:34:59] then he had a prophet born that picked
[1:35:01] those three steps up and always preached
[1:35:06] it coming right down to the headstone
[1:35:12] if I pass the Pentecostal denomination
[1:35:16] after Zuza Street 1910 1912 they
[1:35:20] denominated three God's Assemblies of
[1:35:25] God in the whole thing and the Prophet
[1:35:28] was born in 1909 praise God he was ready
[1:35:32] God knew that they would denomination he
[1:35:34] set out to put an open door when the
[1:35:37] Wesleyan Methodist Church set in
[1:35:40] old-line church an old Lutheran Church
[1:35:43] set in there and that third step I said
[1:35:46] an open door the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost and fire hallelujah outside of
[1:35:52] them things
[1:35:53] I gave it a revival over Wales I gave
[1:35:56] another one opening to the end and over
[1:35:58] them in Susan Street the cross that
[1:36:01] colored man brother Seymour amen
[1:36:04] and from this one across America amen
[1:36:07] you can't box God up may be seated
[1:36:11] then it became the nomination in 1920s
[1:36:14] and 1930s and God was so sick of it
[1:36:17] after they rejected him in 1909 through
[1:36:20] their world war or one came a temporary
[1:36:23] judgment influenza kill millions
[1:36:27] understanding now because God was
[1:36:29] discussing with them they denominated
[1:36:31] again they had the Lutheran Church they
[1:36:33] had the West and then he had the
[1:36:34] Pentecostal church denomination then
[1:36:39] came World War two amen

[1:58:14] he gave you Christmas Day December 25th
[1:58:17] 1988 changing to the glory of Joseph
[1:58:19] perfection from the Gloria Jacob grace I
[1:58:21] would like to give you a little
[1:58:23] background on what was going on and how
[1:58:27] the Lord was dealing with me before your
[1:58:30] message was spoken when the Lord saved
[1:58:32] me on October 23rd when the Holy Spirit
[1:58:34] poured out in 88 I was so overwhelmed
[1:58:37] with the fact that God loved me enough
[1:58:40] to save me that joy would just bubble up
[1:58:44] inside and I could hardly contain myself
[1:58:47] and it still happens to this day every
[1:58:50] time I think about it but through all
[1:58:53] that joy I did not know what my goal on
[1:58:57] this earth was for so he said why he
[1:59:02] says I was on WoW otherwise why was I
[1:59:05] want his earning all the purpose for
[1:59:08] being on this earth sure I still had all
[1:59:13] the joy the person could ever have
[1:59:16] but when I sat in the psychology class
[1:59:19] and the teacher
[1:59:21] the students would be pondering on the
[1:59:23] theme why are we on this earth so
[1:59:27] they're trying to take it out they'll
[1:59:30] never figure it out so and brother
[1:59:32] Nathanael said therefore when he heard
[1:59:35] the message he caught the revelation of
[1:59:38] Joseph's perception why he was put here
[1:59:44] and he grabbed it and he was anointed he
[1:59:50] realized that he was put here to be
[1:59:52] perfect my God praise God thank you I
[2:00:00] realize I was put here to be perfect in
[2:00:03] other words I caught the inspiration of
[2:00:05] Jacob enjoy the perfection then three
[2:00:08] days later December 28th Wednesday night
[2:00:11] may be seated
[2:00:12] the message was a the bridegroom cometh
[2:00:14] to him and brother Paul Menton lobby
[2:00:16] right there and he would steal away God
[2:00:19] baptized me with the Holy Ghost
[2:00:21] brother Coleman talked about joy my joy
[2:00:23] increased 100 fold over he had joy to be
[2:00:27] saved on October 23rd but now you got
[2:00:29] the Holy Ghost a hundredfold the joy to
[2:00:32] know that God loved me so much in spite
[2:00:34] of all what I had said he said a lot of
[2:00:37] awful things and done that he even
[2:00:39] considered that he even considered and
[2:00:41] thought of me as his bride why me I
[2:00:44] don't know but I am sure thankful that
[2:00:47] he chose me so in closing that was the
[2:00:52] background on what was going on and how
[2:00:54] the Lord was dealing with me up to the
[2:00:57] time of your December 25th message
[2:01:02] I'll tell you am I alone I knew that it
[2:01:06] has got to be more people so what
[2:01:08] there's something wrong and I've never
[2:01:10] asked him then he didn't say it so I
[2:01:12] know the Lord just hid it away until I
[2:01:14] asked him the other day here at this
[2:01:16] men's came forth now I had a thought the
[2:01:19] true confession of the Seventh Seal and
[2:01:21] I put descriptions everything down and I
[2:01:25] went and starting it and pimps on the
[2:01:27] right and went the whole thing with this
[2:01:28] way but in the beginning to leave two
[2:01:31] pages in the front you might need them I
[2:01:33] thought might need them then I've got to
[2:01:36] the end I thought I had to tear that
[2:01:37] page over there and put down where my
[2:01:39] scriptures was and so forth so it's
[2:01:41] different set of scriptures but the
[2:01:43] whole thing came by inspiration just
[2:01:45] sitting down right now they call
[2:01:47] Nathaniel he has four like home and I
[2:01:50] want to let you know that you have a
[2:01:51] friend well thank you for that
[2:01:53] oh man God may God richly bless you and
[2:01:56] may you receive a healing your brother
[2:01:58] in Christ Italian quick oh well praise
[2:02:00] God amen amen what's he catch chose the
[2:02:07] perfection and aim and the revelation
[2:02:10] what about you today Church maybe seize
[2:02:13] it
[2:02:14] I'm finished now praise God
[2:02:18] amen finally made it what about you
[2:02:22] Church do you believe that you are
[2:02:23] finally here ah change it to the
[2:02:27] glorious total perfection from take up
[2:02:29] grace and you are fitted into that slot
[2:02:31] call the Holy Spirit then souls of
[2:02:34] perfection releases the whole ethos
[2:02:36] itself to you today if you believe that
[2:02:41] because this is the blending time in
[2:02:44] that Holy Spirit slot ok I have to give
[2:02:49] you a quote for that a man this is now
[2:02:51] remember remember this is a blending
[2:02:52] time now ok you got that praise God
[2:02:56] alright now you know that we oughta head
[2:02:59] slaps I can skip that amen on this a
[2:03:03] Manticore turn on the light amen
[2:03:05] on page 36 am an eternal light oh when a
[2:03:13] man in the foundry is making a bell
[2:03:15] got a certain tone he has to put in it
[2:03:18] when he set in his mold and pouring his
[2:03:20] on his iron he puts in so much brass so
[2:03:23] I steal so much copper why he knows just
[2:03:26] exactly how much to put in to make to
[2:03:28] give it the right tone don't don't don't
[2:03:31] it was the right tone amen praise God
[2:03:35] and and that's what Jesus has done by
[2:03:39] his bride he had to put in so much
[2:03:42] Luther so much Methodist so much pent
[2:03:44] Arian so much Pentecost into it but what
[2:03:47] does he come out with his own reflection
[2:03:49] why is it just like the pyramid message
[2:03:52] you see is heaping right up to his
[2:03:54] coming to the minority for the headstone
[2:03:57] the minister Jesus Christ on earth has
[2:03:59] been the same as a men see he had or he
[2:04:02] can't come to it see just like the head
[2:04:06] to defeat the head defeats it not the
[2:04:08] head but the head packs the feet or
[2:04:10] makes the feet tell the way to go you
[2:04:13] get it beautifully it's the light of the
[2:04:14] our justification served his time and
[2:04:19] justification on the Luther that then it
[2:04:21] had to become sanctification through
[2:04:23] Wesley plaintiff occasion had service
[2:04:25] turn White's to come to the baptism the
[2:04:27] Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:29] Ghost has served his time you hear I'm
[2:04:33] saying now it's already service time
[2:04:36] until see until the Holy Spirit which is
[2:04:41] only one God lens into the church so
[2:04:45] that little slot is blending in time you
[2:04:49] will actually begin to blend into
[2:04:50] eternity Oh God
[2:04:55] you're gonna blend into God and God's
[2:04:58] gonna blend into you
[2:05:00] and some of you from become like God do
[2:05:06] you get it the blending in town and the
[2:05:10] festive the hallways perhaps service
[2:05:11] time to the Holy Spirit is only one God
[2:05:13] blends into the church or the church
[2:05:15] into Christ that makes Jesus Christ
[2:05:17] reflected on the earth
[2:05:19] what he promised hand the Bible might
[2:05:22] now watch you might not believe it I
[2:05:24] can't make you do that I'm more
[2:05:27] responsible for the word see you might
[2:05:30] not believe what I'm saying I can't make
[2:05:32] you believe it I'm more responsible to
[2:05:35] preach it maybe some of you don't aspire
[2:05:40] to be that high don't know why don't I
[2:05:42] believe it hallelujah
[2:05:46] see because this is a blending time in
[2:05:48] the Holy Spirit slunt
[2:05:49] until the Holy Spirit listen to the
[2:05:51] church oh my you said here but the watch
[2:05:56] revival but this policeman he tipped his
[2:05:59] hand to sir they said Whizzer what you
[2:06:01] violent serves the well she Bibles hell
[2:06:03] in here in his heart that's it he was
[2:06:06] the well survive old God if we can only
[2:06:08] only understanding we are the reflection
[2:06:11] of Jesus Christ His Word made manifest
[2:06:14] you are the reflection of his words see
[2:06:16] where the Russian viable what buildings
[2:06:18] it in he said sirs in the heart he was
[2:06:20] the Welsh reviled that's right and what
[2:06:24] about a Joseph's perfection revival
[2:06:26] where will it be at in the heart glory
[2:06:30] and today the church ought to be Jesus
[2:06:33] Christ in action upon the earth because
[2:06:35] I live you live also and my life will be
[2:06:37] in you the work that I do you do also
[2:06:39] see the church has got to get into that
[2:06:42] place and he promised it would do it and
[2:06:45] it will it's got to come to that way so
[2:06:48] you see that's what takes place we got
[2:06:51] to be that way
[2:06:52] there you are Church amen do all the
[2:06:56] reflection of the word Jesus Christ the
[2:06:58] same yesterday today and forever amen
[2:07:01] praise cannot believe today as we stand
[2:07:03] on our feet I pleaded
[2:07:05] lucemon release justification
[2:07:08] and Wesley release sanctification many
[2:07:10] councilmen release the better the whole
[2:07:11] egos in the gift and we we have finally
[2:07:14] here at the top of the foundation where
[2:07:17] Joseph perfection a capstone word pulls
[2:07:19] out by our revelation a bride stone are
[2:07:23] the layouts here to be fitted to be a
[2:07:25] fitted stone to the capstone and the
[2:07:27] Holy Ghost itself is released upon her
[2:07:30] and comes right down in perfection and
[2:07:32] back to the word again to manifest
[2:07:34] itself and she strips herself of
[2:07:38] everything hanging on her and she adds
[2:07:40] to a faith seven virtues then charity
[2:07:43] the power comes upon her and makes her a
[2:07:45] word pride prison of love unto the zone
[2:07:47] to be harness to the word by the Holy
[2:07:50] Ghost itself and she manifests the
[2:07:52] message Jesus Christ to pull the gospel
[2:07:55] Joseph's perfection releases the holy
[2:07:57] goes itself to make to the profession a
[2:08:00] word see manifested in good ground to be
[2:08:03] the reflection of Jesus Christ here on
[2:08:05] this earth the reflection is a
[2:08:07] perfection God amen amen
[2:08:14] now I'll tell you some praise God a man
[2:08:18] a revelation all the way up and right
[2:08:20] down to brother Nathanael and nothing
[2:08:22] happened in a cos of what this guy I
[2:08:25] don't understand and then he told me
[2:08:28] that was nourishment I said oh brother
[2:08:30] Nathanael was a sign that Joseph of
[2:08:34] fecha releases the Holy Ghost itself
[2:08:36] because the psychology was trying to
[2:08:39] clap trying to figure it out what are we
[2:08:41] here for
[2:08:42] how do we get here amen and then he come
[2:08:45] in here and it pondering it is Joseph's
[2:08:47] perfection perfect perfection perfect
[2:08:49] male on the area like like Adam wasn't
[2:08:51] beginning oh praise God but in the sang
[2:08:55] had to get a revelation God prepared him
[2:08:57] with a question in his heart from school
[2:08:59] and God answered it here on Christmas
[2:09:01] that was a big turkey for him amen
[2:09:05] a big dinner but now if you believe what
[2:09:08] has just been spoken I don't know I
[2:09:11] don't know how to say this
[2:09:13] you don't need no more signs
[2:09:20] are you getting it other words just as
[2:09:24] Luther preached justification everybody
[2:09:28] was in justification then the elected
[2:09:31] seat was in that atmosphere and they
[2:09:35] receive justification and same thing
[2:09:38] when Wesley and the Pentecostal couldn't
[2:09:40] help it if they were elected four blocks
[2:09:42] from Azusa Street they get off the
[2:09:44] streetcar and a power God knock him down
[2:09:47] why cuz it was in the atmosphere of
[2:09:50] Jacob grace or whatever now are we in
[2:09:55] Joseph's perfection but in you don't
[2:09:58] have to stress them all
[2:09:59] you are predestinated to be sealed Oh
[2:10:03] hallelujah praise not praise cut into

[2:10:22] be gone all the left will be going
[2:10:24] praise God you'll be skipped up
[2:10:27] everything in this world then charity
