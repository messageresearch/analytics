[2:12] now this means waiting for the
[2:16] revelation for the unveiling of the word
[2:21] foreign exist in degree waiting for the
[2:26] coming the common is the visibility of
[2:29] the word which was hidden by these
[2:32] denominations I would begin to
[2:34] understand in our now when this where it
[2:38] is unveiled reveals that this is what
[2:42] will happen when this happens when this
[2:44] variety of unveil revealed when it comes
[2:47] who this is the word shall also confirm
[2:51] you mean to strengthen you straight on
[2:54] to the end
[2:55] notice now into the end of the day of
[2:58] Christ I'm speaking about that you may
[3:00] be blameless in the day of our Lord
[3:02] Jesus are you beginning to fan out the
[3:07] revelation of the Son of Man will
[3:10] uncover the word then when that word is
[3:14] uncovered that word will come from you
[3:16] will strengthen you to the rapture of
[3:19] the bride of Jesus Christ community amen
[3:24] in the best bill God stick it into your
[3:26] heart and as you got you have got to
[3:29] know that it's got to be in there
[3:31] revelation 10 and I saw another mighty
[3:35] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[3:39] a cloud and a rainbow look upon his head
[3:41] and his face was as it were dove son and
[3:45] his feet as pillars of fire this is
[3:47] Jesus Christ and he had his hand a
[3:51] little book open now notice now when
[3:54] Christ if mighty angel with the rainbow
[3:57] love him so forth when he comes now the
[4:00] book of hoping this was the book of
[4:03] redemption a man and he said his right
[4:05] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[4:08] earth and cried with a loud voice notice
[4:11] how he cries now when he comes down he
[4:14] cries at
[4:15] as when a lion roar and the rare now but
[4:19] then ma'am when the whole Center is
[4:22] smoking say the Seventh Seal Rachel Mary
[4:27] he comes down and he cries
[4:30] that lamp ride ever line right of
[4:33] judgment and they the guard have wrought
[4:35] who can put proper sign now notice and
[4:40] cried with a loud voice and were lion
[4:42] roar and when he had cried when he began
[4:46] to speak in judgment see seven thunders
[4:49] or the divorces and when a seventh I've
[4:52] had all of their voices
[4:53] this is journey for the whole thing in a
[4:55] vision I was about to write and I heard
[4:58] a voice from heaven saying unto me seal
[5:00] up those things which the seven thunders
[5:03] uttered and write them not and also by
[5:05] the way right here may Trinitarian they
[5:07] can't understand how can't write be upon
[5:09] earth and also that they don't hear
[5:11] voice of heaviness right here right up
[5:15] on there a voice from heaven amen and
[5:22] see you up not those things and when
[5:26] acidified other voices around her I'll
[5:27] but the right now her voice from heaven
[5:29] they done to me seal up those things
[5:31] which the seven thunders uttered and
[5:33] rights of not an angel which I saw stand
[5:36] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[5:38] up his hand to heaven and swore by him
[5:41] that liveth for ever and ever who
[5:43] created heaven and the things that
[5:45] therein are and Aaron and the things
[5:47] that therein are and a thief and the
[5:50] things which are therein that there
[5:52] should be time no longer no longer a
[5:57] delay for everything that takes place
[5:59] upon the earth that's what it means now
[6:02] notice what in the days of the voice
[6:05] that the trumpet the word about the set
[6:10] of angel when he shall begin sound when
[6:15] he's about the sound when he begins his
[6:18] ministry that's what it means the
[6:20] mystery of God should be finished as he
[6:22] hath declared to his servants the front
[6:24] I
[6:25] a man made a lot of listen to the
[6:26] reading of his word now notice here when
[6:29] the seven danger when he is about to
[6:33] sound we want to file this morning when
[6:35] he sounded see therefore when he begins
[6:39] to sell all the mysteries in this book
[6:42] should be finished the mysteries of the
[6:46] kingdom of heaven such as a serpent
[6:48] seeing the Baptism and women preach it
[6:50] in so for all these things barely finish
[6:52] when he begins the sound but at the end
[6:55] of his message say that's no different
[6:58] there at the end of this very message
[7:01] then the mighty angel comes down eight
[7:03] and order of thought the seven thunders
[7:05] at the end of this message and we know
[7:09] right now we're just at the end of his
[7:11] ministry ready in his ministry is
[7:14] getting ready to go into the final third
[7:17] time therefore better at the end of his
[7:20] ministry well at the end of the seventh
[7:23] angels ministry a mighty angel comes
[7:26] Vera Alleluia and others are seven
[7:28] thunders and in that's the end of
[7:30] everything that's what we are trying to
[7:33] approach this morning and also last week
[7:35] and you just can't walk in and then -
[7:38] because speak about it there's so many
[7:40] avenues which lead into it because it is
[7:43] the consummation of everything now we
[7:46] notice that region from Amos then you
[7:49] speaking here God always warns the world
[7:52] nothing can happen unless there's a
[7:55] reason for it therefore there can be no
[7:57] judgment unless God has more the people
[8:00] from what they are doing and are doing
[8:04] right now then right everybody names the
[8:06] furchester there nothing can happen
[8:08] unless God will first warn you through
[8:12] his mercy and free mercy we have a
[8:16] prophet is that right we want to take
[8:19] our turn and to proved about God Lord
[8:23] nor of the flood
[8:25] we all know that right God warned
[8:29] Abraham and lot of the destruction of
[8:31] Sodom and gone and God warned Joseph of
[8:36] the seven years famine he also warned
[8:39] lows of the ten plagues
[8:40] he warned Jonah of Nineveh that right
[8:43] and then the the Old Testament from
[8:47] Genesis up to the book of Malachi Bill
[8:50] all the Jews were warned that there
[8:53] Christ Ian knowing that one was coming
[8:56] it runs from genesis 3:15 all the way
[8:58] through the fire literary and is the
[9:00] blood cord running straight through the
[9:02] Bible right up to Malachi therefore
[9:05] everybody was warned shall send my
[9:07] messenger before my faith you're the
[9:09] bestest everybody was warned now in all
[9:13] time and was called grace God has warned
[9:17] us by the same books and added the New
[9:21] Testament Peter and Paul James and John
[9:24] to warn us of the time when he's coming
[9:27] up on this earth as a thief in the night
[9:31] they're right and then he even took kept
[9:35] this off he took his servant John out on
[9:40] the Isle of Patmos and there he let's
[9:44] read from revelation with the first
[9:46] shepherdess to front of what he did did
[9:48] he took John in the spirit on the Lord's
[9:52] Day in the spirit he was in the spirit
[9:56] on the Lord's Day
[9:57] and this is what happened this book of
[10:00] Revelation is a tremendous book the
[10:02] revelation this means the unveiling the
[10:07] uncovering of Jesus Christ to me now
[10:11] this was this word right here right
[10:15] that's what it means but when you
[10:18] understand this word right here unfairly
[10:20] revelation then the unveiling or the
[10:24] uncovering of Jesus
[10:26] which God gave unto Him God gave us him
[10:30] to show unto his servants things which
[10:32] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[10:35] and signified by his angel unto his
[10:38] servant John Dean ward now John was
[10:42] taking out on our campus God this whole
[10:45] book was written by God any man I made
[10:48] God Himself through John he just kept
[10:51] apparently in spirit therefore this
[10:55] whole book is the revelation of Jesus
[10:58] Christ amen go there right now therefore
[11:01] in the Greek that's what this word means
[11:03] there now the day of Christ is broken
[11:06] down into three words this word and this
[11:09] one and I have another one I can't
[11:12] pronounce it this in first so if some
[11:15] because here last week there is a PR PHA
[11:19] in ei8 which means appearing well
[11:23] therefore if three words associated with
[11:26] the day of Christ now in 1st Corinthians
[11:30] the seventh verse ever read to you
[11:33] before waiting for though this they
[11:37] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[11:41] when disco the book of Revelation comes
[11:45] all the way to break it down to you when
[11:46] the book of Revelation is revealed to
[11:49] you see the thing that our aim here will
[11:52] keep you step there and continue to the
[11:56] end when the Christ Himself will come
[11:59] with a shout thank you
[12:01] in other words the son of man is the
[12:06] Word of God
[12:08] the book of Revelation is the Word of
[12:12] God and that right there for a certain
[12:16] time see an appointed season he would
[12:20] reveal the book of Revelation to his
[12:24] servants and and when the Sheep the
[12:26] bride of Jesus would see with end old
[12:30] six seals senator cages and all those
[12:34] different things in there they would
[12:37] know that that is the Word of God
[12:40] yeah there's no one be honest shouted
[12:43] out any denomination could not rethink
[12:46] that only the Sheep can receive that hey
[12:49] where is the word and bringing a witness
[12:52] to the word then therefore the book of
[12:55] Revelation in the unveiling is the
[12:59] revelation is the coming of the Lord
[13:01] can you an offender
[13:06] can only get there then everything will
[13:09] open up to you and you'll understand I
[13:11] thought of being there for this
[13:14] revelation this uncovering will be in a
[13:18] little humble manner
[13:20] I wrote it a way that is the word the
[13:24] runners come to a prophet dinner I know
[13:28] where there was seven mysterious seals
[13:31] just try to put your funding behind a
[13:34] curtain pull that curtain back and the
[13:37] mystery is solved
[13:38] all right well or because two years ago
[13:43] God pulled back the curtain on the first
[13:46] field it will sound that right it was
[13:49] unveiled and then by the word that right
[13:52] and the word come to a prophet amen
[14:00] now we can begin to understand what we
[14:03] see why you must approach the Seventh
[14:06] Seal with understanding and with
[14:09] reverence now they're going to be many
[14:12] spirits running out to Arizona wanting
[14:15] to attend not even knowing what that is
[14:18] not even know it is the end of the whole
[14:21] world right any of everything there pull
[14:24] so that cannot be stable being will be
[14:27] preached to by a little humble man and
[14:30] that is the absolute and over him can
[14:35] you
[14:36] that's why you heard brother Kirk for
[14:38] the what about so me I don't want to run
[14:41] into God's prophets face I want to get
[14:43] myself ready

[18:49] continually Haven here what happens when
[18:54] this thousand hair go to Spain for the
[18:56] half an hour every day sure nothing is
[18:59] said for his soul holy and what happens
[19:03] is that comes down a half an hour for
[19:13] sure
[19:13] Oh a short period time that's how we'll
[19:16] be down here and remember it's time no
[19:19] longer no longer time there's no delay
[19:22] things happen like that
[19:25] therefore get ready now any of the word
[19:29] of God you won't have time here it could
[19:32] be be filthy
[19:34] hey be holy be holy Bridget demands a
[19:37] getting in you cannot change your nature
[19:41] when he comes upon this earth we're
[19:43] trying to prepare you to get ready now
[19:46] this is a mystery this always we've had
[19:51] unveiled by the coming of the Lord for a
[19:54] man we've had six seals riddims in a son
[19:59] of man when he was revealing himself he
[20:01] revealed 60 letter and they all are
[20:04] mysteries see on the back side of the
[20:06] book of redemption
[20:07] now notice and the seven thunders are
[20:11] not even written in the book you cannot
[20:14] know them only when Christ Himself comes
[20:17] up on earth as part of them he s for his
[20:20] bride no my l can hear it it has a test
[20:24] why right now who can receive the word
[20:28] in this page right here how many people
[20:32] are here receiving the word out of
[20:34] millions to dinner on amazing three
[20:38] right here this is your only few and
[20:40] also a few others receiving the word
[20:43] therefore was he changed them up over
[20:45] here and all of the seven front is still
[20:48] right so therefore how can they repeat a
[20:51] certain fungus when they can't receive
[20:53] what ball right now only the bride can
[20:56] hear it that's for therefore we know
[21:01] that when this mystery is to be to be
[21:05] made known it will be right around the
[21:08] time when Jesus appears on the earth for
[21:13] his bride now he comes there he another
[21:15] body his corporal body is still affair
[21:18] but seat on anointing comes down earth
[21:22] and we're going to prove it this morning
[21:24] the anointing the annoying one we go so
[21:28] I comes up on Eric yeah see he meant and
[21:33] hide yourself behind human always if we
[21:39] have the Holy Ghost in us that's gone
[21:40] well then God can certainly put the
[21:44] whole anointing into a prophet in my
[21:47] head has gotten death anointing in any
[21:49] man and there it'll be so humble that's
[21:52] all that's all brother friend for me is
[21:55] what God is now we want to approach this
[22:02] seventh seal with understanding and with
[22:05] reverence now could I want to speak
[22:08] about the Prophet now um now once big
[22:19] about the day of the Lord the day of the
[22:21] Lord you find in Isaiah to twelve
[22:25] thirteen six and eleven revelation 6:12
[22:30] they envelope Merrill and explain what
[22:34] this is here from the cross Jesus Christ
[22:38] and they are Pentecost act 2:38 up to
[22:42] here up to here that is the seven
[22:46] churches you now have it broken down for
[22:49] the seventh circuit agent or broker
[22:51] report in to the morning reformers and
[22:55] cold out we are now in the cold out
[22:59] space but you can see and understand
[23:02] where we are put it on the board now the
[23:05] Reformers they started with want Anubis
[23:07] we all know how to means was as they
[23:10] were wanted back in his period of time
[23:12] up to us Martin Luther
[23:14] then came the spirit of man to the
[23:16] Reformers and we're living right in the
[23:18] spirit of man right now but the spirit
[23:21] of man age is lapping over and to the
[23:23] spirit of the eagle this is now that
[23:26] Eagle II ain't mad and God has calls
[23:29] from eagle to reveal the word amen only
[23:34] the Eagles can reveal the word every now
[23:37] and then the egos there won't be who you
[23:40] think that that they should be because
[23:43] when he sent John the Baptist who was an
[23:45] eagle he had awful strange clothes my
[23:49] age range who knows how long people
[23:53] black robe
[23:55] therefore he looking for needle don't
[23:58] look for him and some of these are the
[23:59] churches out there you won't find them
[24:01] there soon enough they'll be truly
[24:04] dedicated to the Word of God and but you
[24:07] will like the way sound know whether it
[24:09] be the Word of God now from Luther up to
[24:14] 1906 when the Holy Spirit was poured out
[24:17] into the street California hears this
[24:21] line right here from there up to here
[24:24] and I've got a little ladder right here
[24:26] that is what we call the layout of scene
[24:29] church each see you find revelation 3:14
[24:33] through 22 this is also called a cloudy
[24:37] day last week code we went to Ezekiel to
[24:40] present this day God's sheep would be in
[24:44] the hands of ruthless of the karuma's
[24:48] pastors and men with the spirit of
[24:50] bailiff own thing I am as sheep would be
[24:53] in their hands but he said and it's
[24:56] cloudy and dark day
[24:57] see then even time is shall be light
[25:00] he'd send light the word he says them
[25:04] Eagles
[25:05] Ravens with the message and it comes and
[25:09] blast these men no matter what these
[25:11] ministers or not they've come with the
[25:13] word the word over just the work and
[25:15] they be truly dedicated to the Word of
[25:18] God and then they begin to call out the
[25:20] sheep from here and there so forth
[25:22] meanwhile the anointing when he comes
[25:26] with the full word of God
[25:28] now from here up there there's the
[25:31] layoffs new churches this period he had
[25:33] also called the called out period called
[25:36] out from what you were called out from
[25:39] this
[25:41] in there you will see virtually dead
[25:43] alright
[25:45] you will die wretched miserable poor
[25:47] naked anyway
[25:49] until a little humble problem with the
[25:51] Word of God came on the scene everyone
[25:54] admired already that probably was
[25:58] Malachi 4 5 & 6
[26:00] st. Luke's 1730 and revelation 10 7 film
[26:04] that was him
[26:05] not fully being manifested yet see so
[26:10] therefore he came with a sign now he has
[26:14] three ministries he has the Ministry of
[26:17] Moses the Ministry of the methanol
[26:22] Aegean and the Messi of Christ now when
[26:26] he first came he had a sign in his wrist
[26:28] here a 9 left hand and take your hand
[26:31] and if a farmer it would be a red blush
[26:33] he was show up here according to a
[26:35] certain disease that was the Ministry of
[26:37] motion of profit a sign and therefore
[26:40] he'd pray for a name the Lord you be
[26:41] healed that happened between 1947 8 9 50
[26:45] 51 right through there then the ministry
[26:49] change enter the Ministry of Elijah then
[26:52] he began to rebuke Jezebel tank women
[26:56] false prophets right there right and you
[26:59] began to freedom in Jesus name he began
[27:02] to bring out all these mystery of his
[27:05] hidden things he was beginning to sound
[27:07] that there are and he began to sound he
[27:12] gathered up all the mysteries and made
[27:14] him known to God servants you and all
[27:17] around earth better right yeah
[27:19] now he still has another mystery left
[27:21] this is a landfill that is the Ministry
[27:24] of Christ the word and up on the earth
[27:27] we are approaching that is the seventh
[27:30] seal that's what we are trying to
[27:32] approach with reverence now when he
[27:35] called out we found out this summer last
[27:39] summer that the bride is cold there was
[27:41] on the tape called the masterpieces that
[27:44] the bride is called and a few of them
[27:46] are out of step well he's getting them
[27:48] instead she's already called bride a man
[27:51] and how you know it she's making herself
[27:55] ready right now
[27:56] even while all of the running around
[27:58] trying to understand what's going stir
[28:00] bride is making herself ready right now
[28:03] now when that happened
[28:08] she calls God open up the seven seals
[28:13] six of them were open if I put it in
[28:16] this gap right here so you understand
[28:19] now we have it as a call out there is
[28:21] the brightest call when she's called he
[28:25] opened up the seven seals see 17 open up
[28:29] six seals open now
[28:32] God sent down every day the Spirit Lord
[28:37] came into the room the anointing and
[28:39] revealed to hit the word came to his
[28:43] prophet every day and reveal each seal
[28:47] day by day and therefore that what if
[28:53] the Spirit of God is rayna right at war
[28:55] right therefore that could not have been
[28:59] the form of rain on the day of Pentecost
[29:02] for that was a teaching ring I acts 2:38
[29:05] and so forth and so on but that was
[29:07] something different
[29:08] there was the lettering the listener
[29:12] agency that was arraigned the
[29:14] inspiration and also eloquence in the
[29:18] Greek is called that rain came down and
[29:20] open up everything and there from that
[29:24] time when it six steals open up then
[29:28] everybody was wondering was the blood on
[29:31] the seat or off the seat that is because
[29:34] it wasn't sure therefore here was the
[29:37] lamb opening up each sealed up there so
[29:40] you can set it down did down it down
[29:43] from the anointing opens it up he
[29:45] stopped on a Saturday at the sixth field
[29:49] had he opened the Seventh Seal on that
[29:52] Sunday it all be over
[29:53] I say hi he doe Belka he held it back
[29:58] for this space of
[30:00] time in here investigation judgment by
[30:05] the word now from the servants from the
[30:09] Seventh Seal in 1916 to a thing a little
[30:13] bit worse of Tamara you are being
[30:16] whether you know it or not you are being
[30:19] investigated by the Word of God now
[30:22] doing this time also a lot of our dear
[30:25] sisters they just can't get this the
[30:28] Word of God funding goes out the Holy
[30:30] Ghost the word I got to tell you don't
[30:32] have the Holy Ghost the prophet of God
[30:34] says don't do nothing then the son of
[30:38] man told you on a tape call the token
[30:41] don't do know that right even that he
[30:45] said that now the same son of man open
[30:48] up the seven fields also told you
[30:51] sisters especially don't do nothing but
[30:55] yet many are right now trying to teach
[30:57] and trying to preach now if God will
[31:00] draw Souls through you sure you will but
[31:03] is that his perfect whim or is that his
[31:06] permissive will see them email you are
[31:10] being investigated
[31:11] you yourself those of you because the
[31:14] bride makes herself ready lot of washing
[31:17] of the water by the word therefore up to
[31:20] you yourself to make yourself ready so
[31:23] they may know because every place they
[31:26] don't have ministers the people they
[31:29] don't have no confidence in the
[31:30] ministers and so forth in the message
[31:32] well that's according to the Word of God
[31:34] the Son of Man that when I return
[31:36] according to st. Luke 18 sharper faith
[31:39] upon earth needed faith in a whole body
[31:43] of revealed dream well a minister is in
[31:45] the body of truth and therefore if
[31:48] that's broken
[31:49] break1 scripture there there's no thing
[31:51] it's not complete so therefore but here
[31:56] in there he that believeth without
[31:59] seeing him in out II if I can find
[32:03] no matter who they are what they look
[32:05] like a way I come from if I can find one
[32:08] man who believes the inside my profit
[32:11] I'll bless them and then I didn't mean
[32:14] them
[32:14] welcome proven out and Saint John was
[32:16] with because comets
[32:18] Thomas had eternal life total of an
[32:21] apostle but he did not believe except I
[32:24] put my hand in your inner side then you
[32:27] believe better therefore jesus said
[32:30] right there
[32:31] blessed is he that believe it without
[32:33] seeing him and now we have many of his
[32:36] ministers who have to wait until the
[32:39] third close start then they'll believe
[32:41] we have a lot of who believe what I'll
[32:43] see you and as you just preach this word
[32:45] and then knowing is cutting and know
[32:49] that they're hurting people they know
[32:50] that because they have got to do it what
[32:52] has the several scriptures the line has
[32:55] roared and you can but prophesy right I
[32:59] cannot help I'm compelled to these
[33:02] things Peter says alright oh there's a
[33:06] stream thing and first within the ninth
[33:08] chapter now during this period the
[33:15] prophet of the Lord after seven seals in
[33:18] the statements now he said if you plant
[33:21] potatoes go back home and plant potatoes
[33:23] said right man wanna get married go back
[33:25] home and also get mad whatever you were
[33:26] doing before you came to the seven seals
[33:28] go home and do back don't change it
[33:30] Merrill but as spite of what he said
[33:33] they changed that and they started
[33:35] selling homes and so forth and going
[33:36] here and there running all over the
[33:38] place running without the message right
[33:40] and then Sunnah now even the mythity for
[33:43] a no point of time but don't tell it
[33:46] shall come and here
[33:48] last time they won't come before that
[33:51] time again and then when it comes only
[33:54] or veins consecrated vessels can receive
[33:57] it when it comes
[33:59] now therefore oh that's this time right
[34:03] here now this time also this time also
[34:07] is the time of the investigation
[34:10] judgment now from the seventh sealed up
[34:14] tomorrow the whole word is in effect
[34:19] okay yes
[34:21] other words the forward the latter II
[34:23] compound and reveal the revelation the
[34:27] book of Revelation and therefore that
[34:29] book of Revelation is the coming of the
[34:32] law and he made one phase C in the
[34:36] uncovering face other words his words
[34:39] was bound up hidden in the denomination
[34:42] there right a man's over there for when
[34:45] he comes he comes in one phase to
[34:47] uncover the word let the Sheep see it
[34:49] and I believe that from here there's a
[34:51] book then they come out when the word
[34:53] uncovered it see if any kind in it right
[34:57] then because they come out there on
[34:59] blind faith then they are persecuted and
[35:02] mocked and scuffin that's alright but as
[35:06] we read in 1st Corinthians 7 when he
[35:09] comes he will confirm you he was driven
[35:12] you he will keep you on till the end in
[35:15] the day of Christ and a man he'll do it
[35:18] himself
[35:18] better you do it right now
[35:25] now notice who's doing it the weathered
[35:28] yeah nothing random the word in him is
[35:32] doing it but the unspiritual water
[35:34] running after his flesh and innocent it
[35:37] you see now brother brown because he had
[35:41] a Christmas tree here about about three
[35:44] years ago when he preached Christianity
[35:45] and also Dollar Tree and a brother
[35:48] ships's who preached that mentor and
[35:51] Sonny I think it was and went to his
[35:53] house and saw a tree in his house when
[35:56] rang his Bell and called him a false
[35:57] prophet he said you preached against the
[36:01] tree and you had one in your house and
[36:02] you left the message
[36:04] they haven't about three years ago now
[36:07] what the word says about that now God's
[36:11] prophets he make them do different
[36:12] things one may had a merry prostitute
[36:14] there right and they owned their
[36:16] children another had to eat dome that
[36:18] right left one aside for because for for
[36:22] many days now if he told brother branham
[36:25] to eat down should you eat them Samina
[36:30] if he told him to marry of process
[36:33] living if he's a lay upon inside for a
[36:36] year are you supposed to have veto his
[36:39] private duty therefore is his prophet
[36:41] has a Christmas treats do you have to
[36:43] have one I never do what the word says
[36:47] and know what he's doing but they are
[36:51] missing it he's here not in this whole
[36:53] thing he'll make his prophet is a son
[36:56] and not of the science they are told by
[37:00] God what to do but they give you the
[37:02] word and you ought to do what's in the
[37:04] word in had and don't look at him look
[37:06] at the word say well therefore are going
[37:09] to put we find that people don't
[37:12] understand this here now since that time
[37:14] the full word is in effect amen now this
[37:19] means as we saw that the champ is
[37:24] pulling away from the complete the green
[37:27] alright and a prophet of God told us
[37:29] hold on a tape to harvest time we've
[37:31] preached right here different messages
[37:33] which you all know
[37:35] year that was ordained of God and it was
[37:37] badly pleasing he there for others can
[37:39] understand the smell they cannot
[37:41] understand that but don't judge anything
[37:44] well when this seventh seal breaks every
[37:50] man will have his praise of God you
[37:52] won't have to worry you want to say
[37:54] anything because either you will be a
[37:57] corner we are you will not even one of
[37:59] no matter what you say here right here
[38:01] means nothing to God when that seventh
[38:04] seal breaks either you have or you don't
[38:06] have it one of the other four therefore
[38:09] in a natural noun the wheat upon area is
[38:13] laying in the presence of that s UN son
[38:17] that right and then now in a summertime
[38:19] as son must get hotter gets hotter and
[38:22] hotter and it is to perfect the wheat
[38:24] the same son perfect diaz of the guitar
[38:28] all fall into weeds they all protected
[38:31] by the presence of the Sun there are in
[38:35] it I see we unfairness now even now the
[38:38] F oh and of man son of man when his
[38:41] presence is unveiled revealed we the
[38:46] corner wheat in his presence of the word
[38:48] and we are being perfected also just
[38:53] like in the natural matrix and why well
[38:56] we are laying in the presence of the fon
[38:59] of man and then just as a natural wheat
[39:02] lays in the presence of the SU in and a
[39:05] shine upon it that's when the sherry out
[39:08] tell us hey
[39:15] can you understand about amen I need to
[39:19] prove it out Genesis 1:14 you ought to
[39:22] get it
[39:22] this is 114 just now just 114 now notice
[39:27] on the fourth day the first thing we
[39:30] find that God call God separate the
[39:34] light from day that right on the first
[39:36] day now on the first day when you come
[39:38] to the Lord God turns you around from
[39:41] darkness that right and you repent turn
[39:44] around you are separated right there
[39:47] light for babe soon enough
[39:49] the next thing when a second day waters
[39:52] is covering the earth that's the type of
[39:55] baptism they say waters cover everything
[39:58] he divided the waters on the third day
[40:00] and only on the third day life appears
[40:04] on the land the third day is
[40:06] resurrection time there is the third day
[40:10] that one is here it is here from here
[40:14] with a spirit of man but Christ that our
[40:17] sin our promise therefore all flesh this
[40:21] was only the restoration of life coming
[40:24] back into the church there right man
[40:27] prove that Jesus Christ the same
[40:29] yesterday today and forever I that was a
[40:32] birthday
[40:33] now notice up in the sky was the Sun and
[40:37] in the moon and the star but they
[40:40] couldn't see it because there was vapor
[40:41] up on mirror that right in there but
[40:43] therefore only in the fourth day see the
[40:47] rise justification sanctification Holy
[40:50] Ghost were a man before right that is
[40:53] deliverance now and just 1:14 and God
[40:57] said Let there be lights in the
[40:59] firmament heaven to divide the day from
[41:02] the night
[41:02] and let them be for signs and for
[41:05] seasons for days and years and let them
[41:08] be for lights in the firmament of heaven
[41:09] to give light upon their therefore in
[41:12] the fourth day God where is made master
[41:16] to give light up on their shine for the
[41:21] lightest company in the fourth day the
[41:23] day of the word of God light is the
[41:27] shine go ahead in the day of the Word of
[41:29] God can we understand as me in a now
[41:34] what is the word made manifest the son
[41:38] was the word made manifest
[41:41] let there be and it was therefore this
[41:45] description here needs no interpretation
[41:46] I interpretated also their argument then
[41:51] Meraki form when it comes it will need
[41:54] no interpretation for it will be the
[41:58] complete restoration of everything of
[42:00] his life and he'll just speak the word
[42:03] yeah there was that word for that I will
[42:06] manifest itself right if we have that
[42:10] ready enough we will manifest ourselves
[42:12] all right it's got to be I didn't need
[42:16] no interpretation for that he met their
[42:19] Lord we know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[42:22] even in the springtime when the Sun
[42:25] issue and shines upon earth and begins
[42:28] to bring him all life that right to
[42:31] follow from the plantain football botany
[42:33] land when it shines upon it all right
[42:35] that when a son of man when he breaks
[42:39] foot at the bright and morning star when
[42:41] he charged
[42:42] although the seed the Word of God
[42:45] leading us if the seed be planet when
[42:48] the air oh and sharing it breaks forth
[42:50] ever break Morningstar you will come
[42:54] right
[42:57] you can't do anything then you be change
[43:04] change from our run into a butterfly
[43:08] don't happen this God is the anointing
[43:12] you get it well it's the anointing of
[43:15] the Lord now we know that copies or call
[43:28] God that write it as a John 10 34 and 35
[43:32] the prophets are called God's now why
[43:36] the word of the Lord comes to the
[43:40] prophets there right amen
[43:41] now Moses and the different prophets
[43:44] they had the words for their own age
[43:48] then you understand who is about to come
[43:51] now each prophet had a portion of the
[43:56] Word of God for his own time therefore
[43:59] they were called gods for that hour oh
[44:02] my man shuttle God right there you for
[44:06] that yes
[44:07] that's why if you read back in the Old
[44:09] Testament the old men fell down and
[44:12] Reavis those prophets man they were
[44:15] reverent they were revering God in that
[44:18] man and here we have these died wretched
[44:22] miserable Gentiles and seal is God
[44:25] walking up on earth and a prophet and
[44:26] they just say all kind of things and all
[44:29] this is that everyone taking that gift
[44:30] of so forth and so on no reverence no
[44:32] wonder Sarah got nothing and here and
[44:35] not now no difference now Christ was the
[44:39] forward veteran in all the ages he was
[44:43] the Word made flesh upon their right in
[44:48] it now that same word is going to be up
[44:52] on Eric when the seventh seal breaks not
[44:55] a portion but the entire work and
[45:00] on there and a home alone man called
[45:03] never and you understand seven steel is
[45:10] greater than all put together well be
[45:14] Christ on the earth
[45:19] Louis you have been made is eco had a
[45:23] portion of the word give my portion of
[45:25] the word I their portion without only
[45:28] what this prophet has the full word
[45:31] those are all time for everything why
[45:36] you can prove with this in heaven now
[45:41] right now we want to prove this out
[45:45] Jesus Christ was a man that right now
[45:50] notice Adam was the seed of God's Word
[45:56] over it God's Spirit says that they be
[45:59] Adam his words formed animal and it was
[46:03] a seed from that word therefore that
[46:06] seat if that seed be planted in ground
[46:08] it will bring forth another one just
[46:11] like him Abel that right yes - the
[46:15] Romero it was the seed of the word what
[46:18] Jesus Christ his word
[46:21] I mean his flesh was the word Saint John
[46:24] 1:14 the word was made flesh in it right
[46:29] now
[46:30] now we near amber brown see we have that
[46:36] word which was made flesh in a man which
[46:41] having a formal anointing we go yes very
[46:44] worried see what is in the form of the
[46:47] anointing for his corporal body the
[46:49] flesh is up in heaven man see but we
[46:53] hear that word in us in C form from the
[46:56] heyday see now that word is the rainfall
[46:59] fruit ordinary it will when he sends
[47:01] that anoint you he'll bring it that's
[47:04] right well therefore Jesus Christ was
[47:07] the Word made flesh now John the battle
[47:10] he was a prophet that were
[47:12] I came to John the Prophet the full word
[47:16] came to John all right man what he felt
[47:19] times him now notice Jesus Christ had
[47:22] the Holy Ghost there right amen he had
[47:25] the who he was born with the Holy Ghost
[47:27] yet he did not have that full anointing
[47:31] is that right man well we prove it by
[47:33] the scripture that when he stood in the
[47:34] water and go by the water the dog the
[47:37] pillar fire the anointing I believe he
[47:45] stood up on the earth and said the Son
[47:47] of Man which is in heaven what have you
[47:50] seen him go back up standing and go back
[47:52] up to heaven he was standing up on our
[47:54] evidence saying he was in him he told
[47:58] Nicodemus now notice the anointing the
[48:03] Dove the pill fire that's then anointing
[48:06] which was poured out on him without
[48:08] measure oh you know I ran over him see
[48:11] it was the whole thing that fell up on
[48:14] Christ to give him a ministry create
[48:18] anything you want to do I gone to his
[48:20] father's will and you walk the earth
[48:22] that full anointing but notice now that
[48:25] full anointing wasn't a work of fresh up
[48:28] in the pulpit he would speak quietly but
[48:31] his voice would just go on where is
[48:34] sharpening two-edged sword is cutting
[48:35] you just just being spoken solemnly just
[48:39] the word that's only what that's the
[48:41] word he went out he had a full anointing
[48:44] up on him in the temple and he sat down
[48:46] and pulled up the book when he read from
[48:48] Isaiah I think it was 61 min and says
[48:50] now and just close up the book the spare
[48:52] Lord is upon me to preach and so forth
[48:54] but he came to a certain verse which is
[48:56] the day of vengeance he stopped right
[48:58] there for that day of vengeance belongs
[49:01] to him now even Jimmy know and he's out
[49:06] there that was from that time up to now
[49:09] was the accessible from there up to now
[49:12] up to here was the day of the accessible
[49:15] here below or we've asked but from here
[49:18] this is vision that belongs to him now
[49:22] or fruits on the day of the Lord in
[49:26] Isaiah 13 so you understand it is not
[49:30] the day of Christ Isaiah 13 the day of
[49:35] the Lord is not the day of Christ from
[49:41] the six birds Howie
[49:46] for the day of the Lord is at hand is at
[49:50] hand it shall come as destruction from
[49:52] the almighty
[49:53] therefore shall all hands be faint every
[49:56] man's heart shall melt and they shall be
[49:58] afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold
[50:00] of them they shall be in pain as a woman
[50:03] that travaileth they shall be amazed one
[50:05] another their faith shall be as flames
[50:08] behold the day of the Lord cometh crew
[50:11] both of wrath and fierce anger to lay
[50:15] the land discipline and he shall destroy
[50:16] the scent of them out of it for the
[50:19] stars of heaven the constellations
[50:21] thereof shall not give that light that
[50:23] Sun shall be darkened and it's going
[50:25] forth and the moon shall not cause her
[50:27] light to shine and I will punish the
[50:29] world for the evil and the wicked for
[50:31] their iniquity and i will cause the
[50:32] arrogancy of the proud to cease and will
[50:34] lay low the holiness of the terrible now
[50:37] notice here there's a change in nature
[50:40] there anything that we found out from
[50:43] when the sixth seal breaks two prophets
[50:46] come on the scene the very thing that
[50:48] happens there happens when they come on
[50:51] the scene all right which is over here
[50:54] right here the day of the Lord stopped
[50:57] right here when those prophets come on
[50:59] the scene and the son don't give a light
[51:00] and so in the moon
[51:02] the blood that's when the day of wrath
[51:04] of Almighty God stopped but this time in
[51:08] here is the day of Christ that has
[51:12] passed us by already ready amen
[51:14] it's right one phase other the hell had
[51:17] almost passes by that's right have
[51:19] almost passed already and they don't
[51:21] even know it proven he said I'll come as
[51:24] a thief in the night
[51:25] amen and they didn't know it they don't
[51:28] know right now this here is the day of
[51:31] Christ this here pruned up by the
[51:34] scriptures from the sixth seal and eyes
[51:36] they're 15 and other ones of Revelation
[51:38] 19 is the day of the Lord the end of the
[51:42] world end of everything as the wrath of
[51:44] Almighty God is poured out without
[51:46] mixture upon the earth you doing these
[51:49] three and a half years here that's the
[51:50] reign of the Beast that's when these two
[51:52] prophets strike the earth with
[51:53] everything are all kind of pleased
[51:55] everything else and notice now these
[51:57] prophets appear just before this time up
[52:01] on there and they call out 144,000 now
[52:05] where are we at right now you right in
[52:07] here okay waiting for this here to break
[52:12] this well don't be run to attend so that
[52:15] is the end of everything you make sure
[52:17] that when you run at you ready make sure
[52:20] you're ready to stand before the Son of
[52:22] Man
[52:23] now therefore Jesus Christ at the Jordan
[52:28] River the anointing came down and
[52:31] annoying him to preach the gospel right
[52:33] and he was sickened to kappa there was
[52:36] everything else that anointing that was
[52:38] the power of God the full measure of the
[52:40] Spirit of God upon the earth there right
[52:43] amen now that same anointing now the
[52:48] seventh seal speaking about the seventh
[52:50] seal now Moses and Elijah
[52:54] they are the sixth seal of prophet only
[52:57] our prophet can open a seal and for
[53:00] Moses and Elijah open up this sixth seal
[53:02] here better right yeah well then you
[53:05] have mold analyze if you opened the
[53:07] sixth seal the son of man is certainly
[53:10] open at seven sealed
[53:12] sarah only our prophet can open a field
[53:15] I believe there were he the son of man
[53:20] is the prophet of God is the NICU a man
[53:34] hallelujah you think is it how will you
[53:38] know it it will be the word the anointed
[53:42] made manifest
[53:44] you will have to try and determine it
[53:46] it'll be right there if there's either
[53:48] being I just speak to win it again may
[53:52] Memphis being a VA right before the
[53:56] people that will be Malachi 4 5 & 6
[54:00] to restore take everything back to the
[54:03] way it was here yeah he takes your faith
[54:07] back there see and when you see that now
[54:10] knowing strikes the seat is to eat if
[54:13] the spirit is the age of the Eagles the
[54:16] Word of God will be flowing like water
[54:18] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[54:20] living water hey there right everything
[54:22] be flowing they can't not even up door
[54:25] would be able to wag of tongue not it's
[54:27] Vegas tail against you nothing can
[54:30] happen to you
[54:31] not now no is now martyrs reformers and
[54:34] called out now a lot of people are
[54:36] waiting for this that happened over here
[54:38] and they'll miss it
[54:39] cinnamon them they waiting for a lot of
[54:42] laughter's not going to be that way from
[54:44] Oregon be a few people anyway now there
[54:46] are some who are they have been ordained
[54:49] to shed their blood but we all know who
[54:51] they are but this is the call-out each
[54:54] when they receive the Word of God
[54:57] humbly die off spiritually and cross the
[55:01] Jordan and notice when Joshua ate a type
[55:05] of the Holy Ghost crossed over the
[55:07] Jordan who does he meet over there just
[55:11] uh the captain of the hope that right he
[55:16] meets the cap out of the hole standing
[55:18] out on holy ground
[55:19] well when n7 field break that is holy
[55:22] ground that is the son of man up on that
[55:26] Malachi 4:5 and so forth see me no human
[55:31] and therefore notice now after Joshua
[55:34] and they cross over that's when they
[55:37] have the word the sword in the end time
[55:40] and shall be no longer the time as you
[55:43] know it won't be no more be different
[55:45] tired now white anything in here friend
[55:47] charge you a was planing and ask God for
[55:50] more time sons standstill veteran same
[55:54] thing happiness whatever God wants the
[55:57] happier happen the time will be redeemed
[56:01] amen
[56:03] great as you get this hey my my a ready
[56:07] so therefore we find that this seven
[56:11] steel as we approach it is our
[56:14] tremendous thing now what is the Seventh
[56:17] Seal is God's thoughts same completely
[56:22] in his prophets mind let me know
[56:26] you becoming manifest in the word God's
[56:31] thought and your mind is the word spoken
[56:34] out in it you probably know and
[56:37] therefore if the full anointed christ is
[56:39] in his prophet then he has a mind of
[56:42] Christ
[56:42] send me now and he just speaks it in
[56:45] here there what legal no and it may
[56:48] happen
[56:50] beautiful you see enough then the bread
[56:54] will be the same way anyway if we have
[56:57] the mind of Christ will do nothing
[57:00] except we hear from heaven and nothing
[57:03] except our Father show us then we will
[57:05] have dust after all what you say will be
[57:09] dot there belong and where is thought
[57:12] where it made manifest we know also that
[57:16] in those seven thunders the prophets
[57:18] said that God's name is to be revealed
[57:21] to the bride now do you know what naming
[57:25] name means presence name means self very
[57:31] own self well God's very own self will
[57:34] be revealed to the bride for it will be
[57:37] in her ever personal so now I know this
[57:45] is by God's ladies things they preserve
[57:47] what can you do mm boy now this seventh
[57:53] seal will be Malachi for pain Luke 1730
[57:58] revelation ten servants may benefit see
[58:02] right now we are staying with the word
[58:05] their market is stop enough all right
[58:07] but God when the time comes is going to
[58:11] make the word in a medicine they all
[58:14] will see what is in you it will come out
[58:17] you'll be changed from a word into a
[58:19] cutter five heels of the change now
[58:22] here's how we know now in this of seven
[58:28] steel also we know that there will be
[58:30] sold preached to that cannot be safe
[58:34] there must be a ministry Christ has the
[58:38] only ministries that can preach the soul
[58:40] that can't be safe
[58:41] it's his ministry say therefore that's a
[58:43] message eases Christ now to prove this
[58:45] how we've been through this before where
[58:47] as the priests here last spring your
[58:49] last last fall or time for reflection
[58:51] all right I reflect back and understand
[58:54] these things now when Noah preached his
[58:57] message mercy
[58:58] they spurned it then God gave
[59:01] time grace to bring in his family you
[59:04] bring it in your families now bring in
[59:06] the family in this time right here see
[59:08] bring them in
[59:09] lay the token on the line of prophet
[59:12] said so and claim your family amen in it
[59:14] if you have the face but therefore know
[59:17] what did the same thing the door was
[59:19] shut to the outside he brought in his
[59:22] son in their lives their eyes then when
[59:24] they come in the door to the art was
[59:27] shut but then are set up on the earth
[59:30] for seven days I let write doing the
[59:34] breaking of the seventh seal
[59:36] okay nobody could be fabled
[59:41] for the door was shut but Noah and his
[59:44] family was in the ark nice and they were
[59:48] up on the earth and a judgment that
[59:50] happened here oh well seven why the
[59:53] seventh seal was broken the seven days
[59:56] along that right amen I hope you get it
[59:59] if you get a say man
[1:00:02] praise God it is right now they are
[1:00:05] sitting there as a witness or testimony
[1:00:08] that the Word of God is true and yes sir
[1:00:12] God will interpret it own word and you
[1:00:15] approve it too then Jesus Christ his
[1:00:17] third pole upon the cross where it was
[1:00:21] because crucified that right there the
[1:00:25] Spirit of God with that increase two
[1:00:27] souls in prison now when Noah said in
[1:00:30] the art that was resurrection for all
[1:00:33] and judgment for the people that live up
[1:00:36] on earth and amen therefore they could
[1:00:39] not be saved and at heart preached to
[1:00:42] them as a witness against them there are
[1:00:46] then Jesus Christ went down into the he
[1:00:50] went down into or the but be Hades and
[1:00:53] so forth and preach the souls that could
[1:00:55] not be saved
[1:00:56] sometimes this will be is back in the
[1:00:59] time of nor according to first Peter 3
[1:01:01] read write and add your name
[1:01:02] Norah's now he had two priests it O soul
[1:01:06] then he turned right around and took all
[1:01:09] the Seas from Adam on down
[1:01:12] all right all around get on the same
[1:01:15] gospel and they received at the head to
[1:01:17] the word and took them and they came up
[1:01:20] and walked around Jerusalem resurrection
[1:01:24] time doing the third pull on it
[1:01:38] therefore that's two three is the
[1:01:41] confirmation therefore when this seventh
[1:01:44] seal breaks you will be resurrected here
[1:01:48] we found less we get two things haven't
[1:01:50] happened after God came in human flesh
[1:01:55] the next thing that happened after he
[1:01:57] came in he was flesh Abraham's body was
[1:02:00] turned back resurrected amen well when
[1:02:05] God in human flesh preached this tennis
[1:02:08] he'll follow a net will be your
[1:02:12] resurrection time upon earth
[1:02:22] these are only some of the things in the
[1:02:25] 17th everything is in there but that is
[1:02:29] that is the feel of redemption
[1:02:31] that's the redemption that's why I Paul
[1:02:35] Thissen grieve not the Holy Ghost
[1:02:37] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:02:41] your Redemption telling them hey now we
[1:02:48] got you feelin this humble little
[1:02:54] servant of God will walk out there get a
[1:02:57] tent see go in there and all the people
[1:03:00] running back and forth and so forth
[1:03:01] that's alright but we have a type of
[1:03:03] that back in the or with uh becoming
[1:03:05] better because Rebecca received gold
[1:03:08] silver and Raymond alright amen for her
[1:03:11] but her mother father them they receive
[1:03:14] precious things and right here for when
[1:03:17] that tear comes they'll get healings and
[1:03:18] so forth with you to Brad
[1:03:20] you receive gold silver in a white
[1:03:23] raiment they're right here old you are
[1:03:28] therefore they're 1 megohm for that team
[1:03:31] to get on the lane whether it is that's
[1:03:34] what they'll get but you have eternal
[1:03:37] life
[1:03:37] why were you coming to mount 9 s 1 yeah
[1:03:41] you're coming to Mount Zion it'll be the
[1:03:44] melt - or even right diese it was back
[1:03:50] in the light of time it was the amount -
[1:03:52] for Kemal Carmel their mouths
[1:03:54] Transfiguration now Mount Zion and will
[1:03:58] fire in the Word of God and Mount Zion
[1:04:01] what takes place at Meltzer Amen now we
[1:04:09] found in North time that the door was
[1:04:12] shut in their faces they receive the
[1:04:15] Word of God therefore God will do
[1:04:18] nothing except he revealeth secrets to
[1:04:20] his prophet he told more that there was
[1:04:23] a flood coming no appreciate by faith
[1:04:25] inspiration though he didn't see it he
[1:04:27] moved fear to the saving of his house
[1:04:29] but right and then a man now that had
[1:04:31] received this from the fun of men he
[1:04:33] would fear to the saving of his house
[1:04:35] and he'll at night but know they walk
[1:04:38] around prouder going over here and this
[1:04:39] man and they know that sediment that I
[1:04:41] was here therefore when the son of man
[1:04:44] be revealed we ought to be moving with
[1:04:47] fear but we're not see so therefore that
[1:04:53] Ark sat down as a witness a testimony
[1:04:56] against everything Christ went down for
[1:04:59] a witness well they were this'll be
[1:05:01] innate did not receive it therefore when
[1:05:03] the seventh seal breaks giving you our
[1:05:06] type in the Old Testament if other words
[1:05:09] it is damnation and resurrection to put
[1:05:12] it bluntly their nation and resurrection
[1:05:15] Christ went down there they was damned
[1:05:18] don't let believe he took them up with
[1:05:20] it right man with the seventh seal
[1:05:23] breaks because you believe the coming of
[1:05:26] the wall right now

[1:15:58] coming of the Lord in the air but now
[1:16:01] he's up on the earth revealing himself

[1:21:33] the whole thing of the seal and what it
[1:21:35] all means the time we enter right now
[1:21:36] from the set of Steel down came a
[1:21:38] terrain that right up to right now this
[1:21:41] is what is called the investigation
[1:21:43] judgment and we also prove the mass week

[1:22:04] over the place that I can't being home
[1:22:06] away from Wesley and in but the wheat
[1:22:08] falls down to the ground right where he
[1:22:10] sold it at right there enough where he
[1:22:15] that we're right there we fall to the
[1:22:19] ground right there here we know as we
[1:22:32] approach the Seventh Seal with reverence
[1:22:36] with understanding see brother Curt I'll
[1:22:40] tell you you don't understand brother he
[1:22:41] understand it some of you understand
[1:22:43] what God has done to that name I mean he
[1:22:46] has given us understanding I mean I
[1:22:49] don't think how did you get it save me
[1:22:50] now he has give us an understanding of
[1:22:53] what it means to see in face of prophecy
[1:22:55] because it is on a cigar he'll hold it
[1:22:58] at your hands yeah but how are we thank
[1:23:01] God that we know about your approach is
[1:23:03] probably you don't run up in his face
[1:23:04] you can turn back happen yes your mother
[1:23:08] no part of the base stand back you leave
[1:23:10] him alone
[1:23:11] mmm but we prayed us more you instead of
[1:23:14] give you understanding of what we are
[1:23:16] facing now in your midst you have those
[1:23:20] who will talk against you teeka boxes as
[1:23:22] far right that's one of them because the
[1:23:24] count of joy when you fall into divers
[1:23:26] temptations and we want to ask you to
[1:23:28] because pray much for medicine here for
[1:23:31] work
[1:23:31] and pray for one one one another we have
[1:23:34] very tired and we begin to stutter in
[1:23:36] full force of tired body and need much
[1:23:39] prayer but we want to say that there's a
[1:23:41] trial there's a tremendous spiritual
[1:23:44] battle so be important here every day as
[1:23:46] because elsewhere so other words is this
[1:23:49] here the devil is trying to stop this
[1:23:52] work and that now you got to know it you
[1:23:56] knew before either he'll send in a wolf
[1:23:59] to scatter the sheep or he'll finally
[1:24:01] because toes you know all he'll do both
[1:24:04] say now that was dust festival from God
[1:24:06] right man therefore we are holding on to
[1:24:09] what the revelation of the outer hey now
[1:24:16] in hurry all along because we are being
[1:24:18] the whole yeah do they now there'll be
[1:24:21] others who use make well you understand
[1:24:23] save enough but that's all right we have
[1:24:26] to hold on they can do what they want to
[1:24:28] do they can go anywhere they want to do
[1:24:29] it but we are holding on right here give
[1:24:32] me now you're giving up meat in due
[1:24:34] season right here blessed is the servant
[1:24:37] when it comes fire giving out meat yes
[1:24:39] but they're not some flesh but nice and
[1:24:42] then the Word of God didn't aim out in
[1:24:44] due season right now so therefore in
[1:24:47] doing this some get hurt and they go
[1:24:50] here and go that we can't help that
[1:24:51] because the very thing he said was or
[1:24:54] because church order to try these
[1:24:56] spirits by the word and for therefore no
[1:25:00] matter what anybody says we see this we
[1:25:04] can see it spiritually coming in the
[1:25:06] hospital
[1:25:12] nobody know Wilma I want to tell you one
[1:25:16] thing because most of you because you'll
[1:25:19] notice here the devil has set every
[1:25:21] known spirit in here rather under myself
[1:25:24] have been tried by Nancy you know what
[1:25:26] every spirit is and you know what has
[1:25:28] because come through here from every
[1:25:31] known spirit from sex clean on down
[1:25:35] which is what this what the enemy is
[1:25:37] doing is how all kind of filthy Devils
[1:25:39] have come through here that's from some
[1:25:41] of the spirits now any enough of all
[1:25:44] different people and we've been tried by
[1:25:46] the Word of God right here a test to
[1:25:50] hold on to this word many brother have
[1:25:52] been hurt we can't help that because
[1:25:55] Jesus Christ he very many people all
[1:25:57] right and you couldn't call them snakes
[1:25:59] and everything else that right well
[1:26:02] therefore I want to say that many people
[1:26:04] say that so that they have love now I'm
[1:26:07] speaking about a brother here this more
[1:26:09] in the car
[1:26:10] because he's supposed to love brother
[1:26:12] Bram so much down it down had more
[1:26:14] auditory because they split hands around
[1:26:16] them and didn't wanted to because take
[1:26:18] up a low awesome and brother Branson
[1:26:20] please don't because do their brother
[1:26:22] Matt's impose a you want now he loves in
[1:26:24] so much place if you love me keep my
[1:26:27] Commandments but ever here was one very
[1:26:31] low I love my brother but refused to get
[1:26:34] baptized
[1:26:35] see and refused to do everything else he
[1:26:37] says but he loves now what is love
[1:26:40] keeping the will gun yeah therefore I by
[1:26:44] this shall all men know hey any man you
[1:26:46] keep that word any now that's how you in
[1:26:49] it but ever you can talk all you want to
[1:26:51] talk when you obey the word of God I
[1:26:52] know
[1:26:54] and then the only way that God can test
[1:26:56] whether you love is that you won't as
[1:26:59] you want to choose your brother you
[1:27:01] won't sticky you won't be evil against
[1:27:03] him because God is before you in your
[1:27:06] brother and you can't love your brother
[1:27:08] whom you see how can you love driving
[1:27:09] you have never seen an remember well
[1:27:13] therefore that shows that whatever then
[1:27:14] the heart comes out against your brother
[1:27:16] and so forth and over the word stays
[1:27:18] with that word now staying with the word
[1:27:20] means this because to you sister if
[1:27:23] you're on the phone
[1:27:24] sister calls you and wants to speak
[1:27:25] about this or that you say well my dear
[1:27:27] sister that is against the Word of God
[1:27:30] and she'll get mad then let a good man
[1:27:32] that's staying with you yeah now you'll
[1:27:35] have no friends no what's your favorite
[1:27:41] for me for you women to stay with God's
[1:27:43] Way when a system want to talk carnal
[1:27:46] say my dear sister I will not and I
[1:27:49] refuse to do that why because I love the
[1:27:52] Lord more they even a mess let us bow
