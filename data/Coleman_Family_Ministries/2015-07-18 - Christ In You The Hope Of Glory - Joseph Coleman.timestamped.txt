[9:40] brother
[9:42] so
[9:44] amen maybe SE it so truly these have
[9:47] been the Capstone meetings of these past
[9:49] 21 years for me preaching the
[9:51] inspiration of the seven Thunders I said
[9:54] the inspiration a lot of you know people
[9:56] don't understand what I'm talking about
[9:58] a lot of the the ministers
[9:59] well this brother BR says three steps
[10:02] water blood and spirit and the water is
[10:05] the word which was the reveal word to
[10:08] Seven Seals that's the word then blood a
[10:13] revelation of seven
[10:14] Thunders reveals the
[10:17] blood the atonement has been here all
[10:19] along but Malachi 4 revealed the
[10:22] fullness of the
[10:24] atonement and that's what the thunderus
[10:26] does it reveals every word every jot
[10:31] every tit every mystery in the
[10:37] book and Jesus said lo I come in the
[10:40] volume of the book so the Thunders is
[10:43] Jesus Christ the Thunders reveals Jesus
[10:47] Christ and Jesus Christ God must always
[10:50] be
[10:52] Veil so when Malachi God in Malachi 4
[10:56] spoke where did it go at it went in you
[11:00] bad your
[11:03] skins thank you brother
[11:05] Theo may be seated so water is the Seven
[11:09] Seals blood is a revelation of the seven
[11:12] Thunders that bring the fullness of the
[11:14] blood into our different churches
[11:17] because the Holy Spirit he doesn't want
[11:19] to descend on water he likes to descend
[11:22] where there's a blood there then fire
[11:25] comes down on blood and that's seven
[11:28] Thunders praise God has revealed the
[11:32] blood of Jesus
[11:33] Christ that's all what it's all
[11:38] about what are they fussing about am
[11:41] it's the

[40:13] God uh you know in St John 17 I think I
[40:17] was trying to make this point the other
[40:18] night I don't think I did cuz uh I
[40:21] haven't heard the tape anything but uh I
[40:24] was trying to strike something that uh
[40:26] verse 21
[40:27] that they may be one as thou father art
[40:31] in me and I in thee that they may know
[40:34] that they that they also may be one in
[40:38] us now here's the reason why that the
[40:41] world may believe that thou has sent me
[40:46] in book of Acts 4th chapter 13th verse
[40:50] they took note that they had been with
[40:53] Jesus so therefore they knew indeed that
[40:56] God had sent
[40:57] Jesus Christ because Apostles manifested
[41:02] that the Oneness of God God and man I
[41:06] mean God in Christ and Christ in the
[41:09] apostles would it be a wonderful time on
[41:12] this third phase that we could go out
[41:15] through this message manifes in Jesus
[41:18] Christ that the world may know that God
[41:21] sent Malachi
[41:24] for oh my
[41:27] can we live for that huh and that of the
[41:31] the message already vindicate but
[41:33] they'll know that indeed I have sent a
[41:35] prophet okay you may be seated all right
[41:39] so uh my title is um now brother Theo
[41:44] and brother Frank have already preached
[41:45] part of my message it's all right it's
[41:47] fine help me now my title is Christ in
[41:50] you the hope of
[41:51] glory and my subject is another
[41:55] Ephesians is here for the bride Third
[41:58] Exodus we are going
[42:04] out not another church age brother we
[42:06] going out of here this is the Third
[42:10] Exodus this is Rapture time Resurrection
[42:16] timeall hey
[42:29] all right you may be seated now my
[42:33] inspiration is St John 14:20 at that day
[42:37] ye shall know that I'm in my father and
[42:39] ye in me and I in
[42:41] you now we're not talking about the
[42:43] birth I think you understand it by the

[43:19] invisible the prophet preached the
[43:21] invisible Union of the Bride is it time
[43:23] for the visible Union to be made
[43:26] manifest
[43:27] the visible union he preached that word
[43:31] that word within you now manifest

[1:49:37] to the former
[1:49:40] owner huh Glory or bring back to the
[1:49:46] former estate of condition the threefold
[1:49:50] mystery of God God in Christ Christ in
[1:49:54] you to
[1:49:56] restore back to the former condition
[1:49:59] where you could speak the
[1:50:10] word
[1:50:12] hallelujah
[1:50:14] glory
[1:50:16] amen and we can enforce a claim to be
[1:50:20] restored now that's what Webster says
[1:50:22] the word restore means to bring back to
[1:50:24] the former owner or to bring back to a
[1:50:27] former state of condition now our
[1:50:30] standing is perfect but our state is
[1:50:34] variable we're up one day and down the
[1:50:36] next day and we believe we don't believe
[1:50:39] variable but I will restore sayeth the
[1:50:42] Lord back like the bride was on the day
[1:50:45] of Pentecost no more variable perfect
[1:50:48] State perfect standing
[1:50:52] walking just a nod from God how did they
[1:50:56] know there was a nod from God cuz them
[1:50:57] Seven Virtues was in there that's how

[1:51:19] state of condition and if a claim is
[1:51:21] made on something to make that
[1:51:23] restoration you can enforce to make it
[1:51:25] come back to his right place and may God
[1:51:27] uh bless the feeble wordss now to
[1:51:29] restore means to bring back or to
[1:51:31] restore a claim can be enforced not to
[1:51:34] bring anything back to his rightful
[1:51:35] owner where it belongs therefore some
[1:51:37] way went away from his rightful owner
[1:51:40] and can wander around anywhere but to
[1:51:42] restore is to bring it back to who
[1:51:45] really owns it that title deed book you
