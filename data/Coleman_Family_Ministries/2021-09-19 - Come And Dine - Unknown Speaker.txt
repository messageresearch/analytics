some kind of a little message for the healing line and i didn't know what to preach and i had a thought armageddon i said no um i don't think i have anybody left on the healing line amen preach to armageddon my god it wouldn't be left so the lord just was good to me saturday morning over the house there all turned around being remodeled and i went over there and he just told me to do this i wasn't thinking about this but he told me to do it so if he says do i believe be a blessing that's why i sing a song come and dine amen after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples simon peter saith unto them i go efficient they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come amen jesus stood on the shore is that wonderful you can see him stand up in his puppet here this morning the time to pray for the sick and healing but to put the sick and afflicted amen you know everyone would be healed huh [Music] well that jesus is here [Applause] thou cancer believed stood on the shore but disciples now watch knew not that it was jesus just like but today they don't know you standing here then saith jesus unto them uh children having any meat they answered no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find the cast therefore now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord that eagle caught it amen john it is the lord [Applause] even though they were in the flesh amen he could still see was god amen he he girders therefore disciple whom jesus loves said unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he grew his fishing coat about him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea now when they say that it mean he had on his long johns you can't guess what i'm saying some people might think they had a long underwear and stuff amen and dragon and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it was 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread and jesus said unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and 153 and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken jesus said unto them come and dine and that's what drew my inspiration and none of the disciples just asked him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever shall we have a word shall we bow our heads for word of prayer almighty god i pray lord that you would forgive our sins this morning lord and and sins of omission and sense of commission things we don't even know anything about lord god may you bring it to our minds this morning before we would strike that prayer life amen that all sins could be confessed before they come to the elders lord and the elders could anoint them with all and to confess their sins and raise up and be healed and lord you

the young people's revival times wonderful addition here and i got a real uh charge out of reading it and especially this classified ad wanted forming a team looking for witnesses those who are willing to take sides with jesus that's something is that wonderful that's the kind of team i want you can have all the other teams but i want this kind of team are you tired of church members robbing you of your blessing doing service amen have you had enough of your own laziness and complacency let me let me say it again let me hear you again praise god and are you ready to make a full commitment to christ huh are you big enough to become small and admit that you're wrong [Applause] that's what i want on my team brother are you convinced that jesus is here [Applause] yeah but he's just waiting on you and not me hallelujah then you can pass through that prayer line you may be seated are you ready to respect and back up our team captain that's me listen to what i tell you i know what i'm talking about amen and are you willing to follow the instructions he's given us to defeat the enemy now on this team you don't have to be a great soccer player or a great basketball player or whatever

be obedient willing to die to self oh what a team we're going to have my this team is going all the way all the way to the goal line in the resurrection [Music] now the ball that we're going to play with is the devil we're going to boot him from here to there to there you talking about foots balls praise god we're going to boot him amen and there's no goalie strong enough to stop it [Applause] amen maybe satan praise god this is wonderful here it's a message amen are you big enough to become small admit that you're wrong are you convinced that jesus is here but he's just waiting on you i know i'm down here must always be prepared with the sword of the word must study game plan at home books and tips bible amen praise god it's a good game plan at home and come prepared to service with worship and praise [Applause] amen this is a serious and legitimate proposition there won't be many but god is soliciting individuals who have had enough of the world and themselves amen and are willing to surrender their lives completely to his will well what am i going to give in return he will daily load you with benefits give you a peace that passes all understanding and guarantee you eternal life [Applause] that's greater than any ballgame brother tell you that greater than cable uh tv yes sir we ask that it we ask that at our next meeting that's this one here you would be ready on a fine line [Applause] with amens and glories of god to keep all the mockers and delters from taking over the service praise god amen this is yes sir now here's the best one all those interested will meet at the altar they thought they're going to say hallelujah here i am no go down to the altar we'll meet you there take me to the water praise god amen now make believers and scoffers need not apply may the lord god originally bless you that's the team that we are looking for this morning how many won't be on this team oh 100 praise god not not 70 or 60 100 wonderful you may be seated god bless you so god bless you whoever wrote that and we certainly appreciate the revival times yes sir written by our young people and different articles in there we certainly appreciate them well okay y'all are you on the team over are you on the team over here amen praise god okay uh my inspiration is the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church ages see i'm switching over from the last 17 years i've already done that already identified the thunders as the voices amen from the prophet's message amen now i trust and pray he might let me freelance a little bit but of course it always it'll still be what he said amen just a little while and be able to freely just walk out about 30 40 minutes and bang bang bang bang bang you supposed to know where it come from knowing praise god power demonstration of the holy spirit praise god would that be wonderful amen so now this morning i believe a group is here we pray for specials and that's that's the right way to a group first alpha first and then omega amen [Music] so now we're to have prayer for the sick and the afflicted and according to your faith beat unto you september 20 1974 inspiration came to me a revelation from malachi 4's message now i'm still catching these uh new people i'm trying to finish you off by june 9th amen the seventh of the seven voices of the seven church ages this inspiration has led this church up to this very hour from brother brown's message they checked it all out and saw that that's what it said amen so after revealing the seventh under inspiration september 20 1974 then he told me to preach the seventh under seeds from the word these would be seeds over the 17 years and he gave me saint john 20 and 21 and the old timers know what it is and then in 1984 i did it again to give resurrection faith and malachi 4 restored back the resurrection faith and what is that that you see jesus come back and live in you amen and manifest himself in your church by the power of god making himself hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever amen and the word made manifest is the gospel and the gospel came to us through not through word only but through power and demonstrations of the holy spirit to demonstrate the power and make the gospel live we have all these seeds in us but he's got to live and that's why i come back through the virtues a seventh under revelation is given to bring on a seventh under revival or seventh under manifestation amen how many looking for it are you on the team [Applause] that's what this team is looking for praise god now brother brown was set up about a revival five things number one bring souls to christ that's the main thing revive the church back into a spiritual condition to where it should be where it should be and that's why you understand now them seven thunders calls and energy and gathers together and so forth the prophet knew that somebody had to preach them seeds because it couldn't be no revival without preaching them seeds out because it would be years before all the books and tapes would get out and some people don't even have money to buy the tapes amen so somebody would have to start preaching it putting seeds in from the seventh by a seventh under revelation why so when the owl would come you could have a seventh under revival a revival of what are the seeds that's already in you see why not went forth for 17 years amen it wouldn't be a thing in new york city if it wasn't preached couldn't even look for no revival because there's no seeds in there because a revival is to revive revive what see you see the the revival in the ocean there when the water's all churning up and doing that going back and forth is nobody coming from the shore with the big trucks and things and pouring water into the ocean it's the water that's already there it's the wind a greater wind getting hole at water and turning that water up and down hallelujah and what does it do it washes up on the shore all the weeds and trash and sticks and dead fish and all kind of stuff [Applause] hallelujah thine the glory yes sir praise god a revival does this team want a revival glory but now we want to get back into a spiritual condition where it should be and that was like the omega church on day of pentecost and number three close communion with god don't you want that and number four bring fellowship among the churches and the only thing that can bring fellowship now is suspicion of every each group is suspicious of the other one but if everyone have a seventh thunder revival going on no more suspicion just love pouring out in brotherly kindness hallelujah oh wouldn't that be wonderful it's going to be yes sir so bring fellowship among the churches by seven son revival we'll gather the bride amen number five pray for the sick those are five things he said about revival amen we want to start praying for the sick today so for almost 17 years uh we have endeavored by resurrection faith to sow seven thunder seeds to bring on a seven thunder revival so amen from september 22nd october 27 1974 identified seventh under seeds in the word as revealed to me and there i have taken my stance what god told me and many come against what god told me well i'm not bothering you what god told you that's what he told me amen i didn't ask nobody anything so for me my church and my family amen but somebody got out there and everybody had something to say about what god told me saint john 20 19-23 he said that was faith and 24-29 that was virtue and 30 and 31 that was knowledge just finished preaching on it to know him from the beginning see you already ended and don't know praise god in saint john 21 1-14 temperance today 15-17 patience and saint john 21 18 and 19 godliness and 20 through 25 brotherly kindness you know what shall this man do what is that to do follow on me don't worry about me what i should do amen what's that to thee apollo down me so if everybody would do that then they wouldn't they wouldn't be bothering me just mind your own business praise god hallelujah this revelation for this church this church here nobody else this church my family that's it and some friends that they want it they can have it but they're going to stand a persecution for even having it hey man see we can take it here amen you may be seated because the prophet ordained me to do this so i can stand it before the foundation aware of god knew that i could stand that see i don't worry about what the chipmunks is chip chip chip chip chip chip chip hey man that the eagle stands there with one blast of the wing praise god the chipmunk is blown away somewhere amen so i don't worry about chipmunks praise god amen you may be seated you got it now jesus appeared the first resurrection sunday to give resurrection faith it's on all the tapes and we're bringing back uh um april 7th then came jesus wednesday amen so be right in your minds you know what's going on he won't want you like straight away some way man glory to god praise god yes sir he appeared the first resurrection sunday to give resurrection faith and thomas was not there and then saint john 20 19-23 that was resurrection faith in acts 1 1-3 it tells you that christ resurrected ministry for 40 days appeared to his disciples and three things as you read the scripture i picked out that he does he did he shows himself a lie that's the main thing and what would you do when you see him come back here among us alive oh hallelujah pray do you know that great resurrection faith is moving among you and number two by many infallible proofs not just say i'm alive but some some to do some things like he did cast out devils and heal the sick and let the holy spirit pour out praise god and then number three speak in things pertaining to the kingdom of god that's what he was doing in and out those 40 days there then saint luke 24 45 he gave out a shout message then jesus opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and wasn't driving down the scriptures there'd be no revival let's be on the scriptures scriptural revival now there's a difference between appearing and coming of the lord how many i mean how many know that difference amen the end time evangelism on page eight amen brother brown said paragraph 40. now we are thinking evangelism at the end time and anyone that would could read a newspaper could read the sky is black and darkening and the clouds coming up and know that we're fixing to have rain and i feel it in the air and see the great streaks in the far distance and the flash and the pushing of the winds knows we're going to have a storm going to be a rain pretty soon anyone can read a newspaper and see the conditions of the nation nations realize that something is fixing to happen and we see in the papers the terrible things going on devastations and pestilences is in famines and all over africans and the kurds and different places people are starving to death and many millions will continue to stop yes sir all kind of things going on see you like would make you want to run to christ if you're not going to make you want to get on this team that i was talking about amen [Applause] anyone can read the newspaper something that's fixing him when you see one with the chip on his shoulder and the other one and the other and the margin with all kind of weapons and so forth to fight with and no agreement kicking off the shoes and beating deaths like koushev and and everything at their conferences you know something's fixing to happen and that brings upon the people kind of a feeling that that something's fixing to happen what about now since the persian gulf war amen and the euphrates river drying up when you think then and that and the two the the two callings the call to armageddon and the call to the resurrection oh i thank god i'm hearing the call to the resurrection praise god the two great suppers won the supper of the lamb and when the supper of god is amen which suffer are you called to praise god these guys in the world think you're doing something what are they doing they on their way to hell praise god brother brown called it atomic bomb fighter yes sir atomic bomb fighter amen the world something's fixing to happen whereas we would call it cosmos the outside of the world i'm just talking to you now we're getting ready for a healing line but you know something's going on you see it's a different age amen you know when the christ went into the temple and and returned from 40 days and was for the power of god he was full of the spirit amen then he walked into the tabernacle and picked up the book and said the uh uh the the acceptable year aimed the spirit of the lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year and he cut off right there then he was anointed he was the word then he was filled with the holy ghost then he was anointed with the message to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he helded her off right there and brother branham said or you may be seen on identifying masterpiece he's he went through that again and he's but now this day the day of vengeance of our god the bride will take that peace the bride will be able to say like he said this day these scriptures is fulfilling your sight so though we're going to have a seventh on the revival we have to take our word the day of vengeance of our god so we're going to have to realize there's going to be death and pests on every side but shall not come nigh thee for thou shall be covered by the blood hallelujah though the blood running the streets hallelujah won't touch you amen recognize your day-to-day avengers of our god the calling to armageddon praise god but the calling to the bride suffer in the sky yes sir you may be seated amen something's fixing to happen the world as we would call it cosmos the outside world feel that there's a coming destruction of say like atomic age is fixing to blast forth the christians knows it's the coming of the lord see there's there's an atmosphere it depends on what you're looking at for our lord has strictly told us uh what was going to happen did he not tell us amen at that time we don't know the middle of the hour but we know that we're hearing something now amen page nine so there there is a way out that that's christ that's what i'm preaching this morning it's the only way out now the christians should not be in that condition whirring and all in the world what not uh we should be happy waiting for the coming for is close [Applause] amen looking for it we can feel the cooling breeze of calvary when we look down and see the god of heaven who made the promise and the very things that jesus did amen in his life promised would return the last days and here we see it what is that that's the breath of the refreshing like the rain coming see we know redemption is nigh see something's fixing to take place now the world doesn't see that that's why you go on your jobs and you oh you come from the service and look at them they don't know nothing the spirits moving through the world dead wildly living every naked woman is dead while she lives in a worldly lust hallelujah glory to god praise god you better thank your god that god called you out of this world you better thank your god he said come and die in the master call it come and dine hallelujah get on his team praising god and thanking him hallelujah may be seated amen now the world doesn't see that they laugh at it on your jobs because like they did in other days but we know that it's coming here even the prophet he had to preach the rapture in a specially designed restaurant where they were taking up the dishes and markers and so forth because peter says in the last days there would be markers and scoff and say where is the promise of the coming of the lord and brother abraham actually preached it in a place like that laughing joking pushing the dishes and so forth and he was preaching the rapture that was the scene from the bible god brought the scene right out of the bible made it flesh in arizona yuma praise god he might preach it hallelujah praise god amen where is the promise he was the promise of the coming of the lord i'll send you malacca 4 i'll send you elijah so there was the promise the promise given out the promises oh hallelujah amen praise god god be praised god be praised amen praise god now the world doesn't see that they laugh at it like in other days but we know it's coming there and that's the reason i chose today this subject for my last for a while for the tabernacle on end time evangelism and when we're doing mission work on foreign mission with the word of god we know that we're always in the will of god what you're doing overseas there in south africa brother coleman i'm always in the will of god who told you to go to south america brother coleman i'm always in the will of god why are you going to europe brother coleman william branson i hope god sent you to the foreign field what am i doing over there what are you doing over there brother i was sin i don't know about the rest of these guys praise god hear me well know what i'm talking about praise god yes sir my heavenly father sent me as my father sent me so send i you amen that's why i read the scriptures saint john 20 19 through 23 as my father sent me even so send nay you receive you the holy ghost i know where i'm coming from praise god hallelujah but they don't know you may be seated oh hallelujah and i don't need no lesser of accommodation praise god the word is my credentials amen that's the reason i chopped this assault oh yeah amen the foreign and when we are doing for a mission make a foreign mission with the word of god i went with the word to quotes what the prophet said with the word of god we know we always in the will of god because jesus first commissioned to his church was to go out and preach the gospel this last commission was to preach the gospel the first time he ever ordained any person to preach the word and go throughout the country he said heal the sick and raise the dead cast out devils as freely as you have received freely give saint matthew 10th chapter descending out to 72 by two amen that was the first commission he gave to his church and so you couldn't go out like that because there was too much unbelief but they didn't even know what brother bran's message was so you had to go out to identify the message for about 17 years now we talk about power signs ones and miracles to vindicate oh hallelujah praise god so far over top of their heads they don't even know what's even going on amen see they don't know the message amen now the last commission he gave to his church just before he was received into glory amen he said go into all the world he had just risen from the dead and many of them were sitting together and he upgraded them that's saint mark 16 14 there he upgraded them of the hardness of their heart because of their unbelief that believed not them that had seen him after he was risen amen i saw him in 1974 come back after he left with the prophet i gave my testimony i saw him faith amen see they had a testimony that they had seen the lord and the others didn't believe it and he upgraded them because of the hardness of their heart they didn't believe these people who have seen that he was not dead god's not dead he is alive [Applause] oh hallelujah praise god we even sang it in testimony yes sir same thing today now we come down to the day when you see his work now we have already seen now watch and are witnessing the appearing of the lord now remember appearing and coming as two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now what's this appearing now it's a sign of his coming malachi 4 was the promised sign of his coming and what would his message be in a bride a sign of his resurrection at hand because they're all full of charity token being displayed signs one's america's following them statue of a perfect man appearing in a pride just before the coming hallelujah praise god i believe the minds is opened up yes sir oh in the form of the sign of his coming he's appearing in his church watch in the form of the holy spirit see what i'm preaching now joseph affection releases the holy spirit itself to appear in you it'll be a sign the wicked and the delta's generation seek after sign they won't get no sign but the sign of what the sign of the resurrection oh church the same god that could take a promise from peter and put it in human arizona and make them people make all kind of noise and while the prophet was preaching then the same god can do the same thing today in this wicked and adulterous generation praise god he could put his hair as a sign [Applause] hallelujah praise god you may be seated yes sir amen and you get there now in the form of the holy spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the holy spirit doing so that's the appearing of the lord you get it now the holy spirit is appearing of the lord then what what would be uh now the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel that you're told to go to in revelation 10 verse 8. he's here he got the book of redemption open oh my that's the holy spirit that's been appearing since 1946 when he appeared to the prophet as an angel form and appeared with the prophet and his first pull and second pull appeared with the prophet as son of man and his third pull to reveal the word [Applause] and then begin to call out a bride for 25 years and i believe she's called out now and kept that message alive for 28 years from february 63 and immediately the wave sheath of some have compassion ministry of the morning star amen praise god hallelujah oh hallelujah praise god yes siree oh my yes sir i think uh there's more getting on the team am i getting some more members for the team yes sir now today we try to take the written word we have in letter form creed form and so forth to all the world and there's been missionaries going everywhere but what do we find when we get there a native that can't read his name holding a track in his hand he knows no more about it than he does which is right and left hand but when jesus said go and preach the gospel he never said teach the word he said preach the gospel and the gospel came not in word only but through the manifestation of the word for the only way that it could be done was to make his promise come to pass well then if he said seven thunders give faith in the bride revival well why not preach it not preach it to make it come to pass it's a promise instead of give you faith for rapture and grace we'll preach it ain't nothing else you want to find for 17 years you found that out praise god nothing else there [Applause] praise god anything else there brother amen oh my the gospel came nothing word only just in the books and so forth mechanics but there's some dynamics to it praise god through the manifestation of the word for only the way that could be done was to make his promise come to pass so is it today his promise of the word seven thunders must be number one first spoken as seeds number two then in the dynamic season he can revive these seeds [Applause] oh and you people sitting around here dead don't almost even going on they had only known the message yes siree amen then in the dynamic season he can revive these seeds thereby bringing the word through power and demonstration of the holy spirit making him hebrews 13 8 god's trying to get you ready for that prayer line amen brother bob praise god trying to get you ready for that prayer line hallelujah glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory now christ placed the ten disciples on the expectation and this message places you on the expectation amen for the coming of the lord for the rapture for the resurrection for an outpouring of the holy spirit on the expectation like simeon but you have to wait versus reveal first he was revealed to simeon that he would see the christ then simeon went right on what he was doing he didn't get all excited and get down and then because it didn't happen the next day and the next day and the next day god had already spoke once the miraculous speaks i mean once omnipotent speaks the miraculous must take place hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah praise god god be pleased yes sir [Applause] amen he may be seated and then one day when the time come when the dynamics come then the holy spirit told simeon get up walk going down to the temple hallelujah you're going to see the lord's christ today there was a whole lot of women in there dedicating babies he didn't know which one from the other one but the holy spirit led by the spirit hallelujah walk right down through the great temple praise god and walk right up to mary oh hallelujah went right to the word simeon be on expectation hallelujah this is your day glory you'll see the lord's christ you may be yes sir amen amen amen now you know something's going on huh christ placed the ten disciples on the expectation by breathing on them receiving the holy ghost and by giving them resurrection faith they saw him alive after his death [Applause] he gave them authority to bind and loose by resurrection faith for the dynamics that's what i was doing for 17 years binding and losing praise god and preaching there will be dynamics shut up praise god god said so god said soul [Applause] amen praise god the ten disciples had to stand in the reproach for their for their revelation for a testimony of faith for seven days and i just read you from the prophet they had to testify and the others he rebuked and upgraded them what's wrong with you they saw me you wasn't there why don't you believe the man's testimony [Applause] and how the holy spirit is going to rebuke him today with a short quick message that'll shake the whole nation [Applause] you watch god shake these places of unbelief hallelujah praise god oh glory to god amen maybe see their message the burden on them we have seen the lord and the prophet said the same thing they had a testimony as they had seen the lord not you but they who are you to refute it who you say i don't believe it well who cares if you don't believe it i saw the law i mean don't tell me you're on belief you don't believe it i mean i believe it glory to god praise god they think by them saying they don't believe it would make the word of god or non-effect cannot by the unbelief make the word of god not in effect god done spoke it he said it and i believe it [Applause] you may be seated amen so before the dynamics come in the upper room they had to stand in their resurrection faith and bear the reproach of baroness for seven days they could not produce christ and uh uh uh what's the name thomas challenged them monday tuesday no doubt they got together wednesday and wednesday night service he said i don't believe it except i see the nail prints in the hand and so i

prayer through couldn't get nothing in his life burned down with unbelief i don't believe it oh hallelujah come and dine the master call it coming down glory glory hallelujah they had to stand in their resurrection faith and bear the reproach of baroness for seven days they could not produce christ for 17 years we could not produce christ [Applause] and people right believing that seventh uninspiration was almost the worst and then these meetings in pennsylvania in different places almost the worst with the unbelief praise god and believe in the seventh inspiration seventh on this yes sir i expect it outside that inside amen praise god thomas did not believe them because he was not there [Applause] thomas wasn't standing where i was laying when the lord spoke to me there was no water for him with enough room for him in there hallelujah praise catch what i mean only one could get in there praise god that's me amen so he was not there where i was at so he didn't hear that and he had the nerve to tell me he don't believe it tell me for 17 years he don't believe it maybe he sees it but i'm still trying to help him today [Applause] i'm not against him i forgive him in brotherly kindness of all the hard things he said because he's ignorant he didn't know i'll let jesus rebuke and praise god jesus will rebuke them with a short quick message it'll shape the whole nation oh hallelujah amen now thomas did not believe them man i feel i'm getting vibrations back he's like you can read between the lines huh that's what that's where i like to preach you know i like to preach in between the lines yes and then it's real then it goes in by revelation yes sir thomas did not believe them because he was not there thomas said i will not believe it after eight days the second sunday jesus made his second appearance then came jesus virtue to prove to thomas that the ten disciples did receive resurrection faith and what is that that the seeing jesus after he was dead come back on the first sunday resurrection faith and say peace be unto you receive you the holy ghost through these thunders oh my thomas wasn't there they don't get mad at thomas now because he's a part of the program amen his name is on the program there amen a little later 17 years later but he's on the program amen yes sir praise god and to prove the time that the ten disciples did not receive resurrection faith see thomas finally knew that he was in the presence of deity he screamed out oh my oh my god and my lord and my god my elohim and my jehovah yes sir the site of the manifestation of christ has been enough and then saint john 20 29 thomas became uh then he jesus said be thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet believe oh praise god and then he dropped some knowledge on them on the 30th and 31st verse and knowledge come in there and many other signs truly jesus did in other places that these are listed that you might believe that jesus is the christ the anointed word the son of god and believing you might have life through his name what is life the name the person the blood and the name is in the word because he is the word what is it then the word interpreted is the man of a station of the name of god you mean that if his new name is in these seven thunders and when some seven sons is interpreted that would be the man of the station of the new name of god [Applause] could that be is that a promise prophet says on page 158 first seal that's why you pray can't get nothing hard like you do says

what i'm trying to tell them today there's a revival going on john said it is the lord and peter's mind must have flashed back to when he was trying to fish and fish to all night and caught nothing and the lord said launch me out here amen praise god but never mind what you're trying to do but bring that word first launch me out push him out so far then he preached he preached the word then when he finished preaching the word then he tell peter let down dinette and they couldn't even pull the thing full of fishes [Applause] but what happened the word went forth first then you'll get all what you want but don't try to slip on the ends and sneak over there and try to do some self-will lord thy will be done amen maybe peter was not conscious of being out of the will of god by going fishing after two appearances of jesus doing a great revival see other words of doing your own thing and just coming to church to be in service like young people say i i i changed the whole program five o'clock be there be ready in prayer see i know the holy spirit's gonna pour it's gonna pour out see i know this so that's why i'm telling them how to how to prepare themselves to be there five amen and then you and then you're ready then the man of god like last night brother paul walked out and preached the word the fire you know the fire come down so forth and you keep doing that then you're going to see them begin to get sealed up then they have their fellowship after he told me three things preparedness prayer and the word and the fellowship so they got three things now amen did you catch the lesson this morning there's a symptom revival going on for thomas then came jesus virtue power was here for service this is saint john 5 19 time thus saith the lord keep still and thy word lord i will do this i'll do that let it down peter amen just don't say i go fishing doing whatever else you want to do amen don't say i go fishing jesus was about to remind the disciples that the one who grants success in christian work is also sufficient for the daily needs of his own fishing bread upon the fire come and die oh holly i mean he's gonna feed you every day he'll take care of you ready to fish up on the fire every day you don't have to worry about uh where the uh stuff is coming from hey man start to say the groupies or something amen yes sir saint john 21 10-11 branch and vine bring the fish which you have caught without me you can do nothing they were impotent without him amen christ directed servants in the result those that had those that are worn through christ directed service by his word speaking where to cast the net will not be lost don't go fishing without crying surrender your whole being and die and be born again amen glory page 11 end time evangelism jesus said you must be born again in order to be born again is letting yourself go and die with the spirit of christ coming coming to you then you no more yours is christ in you see the holy spirit paul said i die daily yet i live not i but christ delivered them aces christ then you're led by the spirit and you just can't go fishing where you want to go fishing amen and you stay there and then you add number two stay there after you're born again and add those seven virtues number three until you come into his very image and then he adopts you oh saint john 21 12-14 come and dine he said they knew it was the lord they were so happy amen praise god amen they had two miracles of christian service they knew who he was the third time amen they were now in the presence of the lord the first time in september 20 1974 all the way through march 31st 91 they were not sure and then the second time april 7th and april 28th then came jesus and know him from the beginning he still wasn't sure you know it's not sure but the third time come and dine maybe today you will be like john and say it is the lord on the wings of a snow white dove just softly praise god as we switch over 153 fish what does that speak of unbroken service see and the net was not broke and once christ does it there'll be no break in the service at 153 is nine nine is fruitful amen christ directed servants bring forth the fruit i've been cast in 17 years the net by the word revelation maybe this will be the time from here on to be healed and sealed and delivered praise god today may 12 1991 jesus is here i believe it's time to pull in 153 fish amen [Music] do you believe it hallelujah besides that bread and fish upon the fire for your daily needs and you can even eat the miracle of the fish in the bread that's right and that and labor episode effortlessly in christ directed service you don't get tired and weary so before christ appeared in the open he gave them faith virtue and knowledge [Music] september 74 and april 1991 that was the end of the first climax with two appearances for when omnipotence speaks the miraculous does take place so they already knew by knowledge that the miraculous would take place may 12. [Music] that's why they're here but they know by now that god is going to heal them and all what the preacher is trying to try to get the sins out [Music] that's all it does not interfere with anything uh in your life at all it just moves some things out amen so when christ appeared the third time in the open in his second climax omnipotent had spoken the miraculous had to take place the disciples now finally knew that christ was risen with them in church and seven thunders will give them faith for raptured grace now in the third appearance add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience guidely kindness omnipotent speaking in your lines for christ's directed service to bring on another ephesians a perfect omega bride oh hallelujah how many have been in self-will service and would like to repent let's see the hands get all the trash and tv and everything else out of their lives and houses oh is that wonderful just about a full house on the wings of a snow white dove now brother brown was sitting on the wings of snow white dove he says next message dovely nego [Music] and uh trust and pray that the dove will lead you all the way with your sicknesses and heal you seal you and refill you take you all the way to charity the wounded dove has brought the message back oh god is finished how many wants the dove today to take all the evil and lust and pride out of your hearts oh wonderful praise god seek him daily until these virtues are in us and we become a man of a station of the living christ it is finished then you can surrender this morning then the double lead you from faith the virtues of knowledge the temperance the patience the goddess of the kindness and to charity oh church come and die fish and bread upon the fire amen amen [Music]
