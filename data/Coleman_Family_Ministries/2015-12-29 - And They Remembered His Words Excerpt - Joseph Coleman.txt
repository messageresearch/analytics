========================================
now a prophets a prophet must prophesy and be rejected then his prophecy comes to pass then they remember his words Hallelujah on reproach for the word page 20 but remember the prophet is known after his prophecy has been made manifest amen so if the people don't want to believe it God's able of the chairs to make his prophecy manifest and what's the prophecy when I see the token displayed I'll pass over that's the prophecy and after the prophet has been rejected and his message been rejected then they will remember his words when they see the death angel come and then they will remember his words Jesus Christ the son of man proved this fact the first time amen St John 23-17 amen just just a little background here I'mma close out here now I think I'll read just here amen for a little background verse 13 to give you a break you may be seated and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxin and sheep and do and doves and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxy and poured out the changes money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remember that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me upall then

raise it up undo this temple in other words in three days I will raise it up but he spake of the Temple of his body amen amen when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and then they believed the scripture in the resurrection they finally believed the word they couldn't believe the word until the resurrection and not only did they believe the
