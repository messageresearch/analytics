[38:11] see brother mus uh uh lay out um sent
[38:15] out this here the rapt in faith U
[38:19] announcement and then uh the second
[38:22] coming of the Lord on page 133 ah I feel
[38:25] the Lord spoke to Meen 1974 four and
[38:28] said these three steps is is hidden in
[38:30] my second coming I didn't know I
[38:33] understand it you know but he then
[38:35] explained and but then one came
[38:37] brotherly kindness in Georgia then it
[38:40] come then it thundered and and now a
[38:42] place in Christ adoption of
[38:45] Charity
[38:47] here so he put it there himself God says
[38:50] put it there and then we thought is this
[38:52] the time to flip over and say come and
[38:55] rejoice with us well you couldn't do it
[38:56] until you got it
[38:58] [Applause]
[38:59] first so you had to get it first and
[39:02] then you can say come and rejoice with
[39:04] us we found the Lost coin Brotherly
[39:07] Love Oh and by this yall all may know
[39:11] that you my disciples
[39:13] disciples so I feel like that's been
[39:15] thoroughly nailed down by the Holy
[39:17] Spirit I believe the third phase has
[39:20] been identified with a manifestation of
[39:23] the ministry of Jesus
[39:25] Christ and I was sitting there and I was
[39:27] going down I was going somewhere and I
[39:30] wanted what's the inspiration and I
[39:32] wanted the tape to to play I was going
[39:34] to Pennsylvania that's right down see
[39:36] our good friend the doctor amen people
[39:39] from Pennsylvania New York I know who
[39:40] I'm talking about and um he gave me some
[39:43] stuff one time and I said shoy Dooby I
[39:45] said what is this stuff here my God Amen
[39:49] but it's good for you though amen so
[39:52] praise God and uh amen so anyway uh I
[39:57] want to get a tape to play it's about
[39:59] three and a half hour ride and then I
[40:01] grab unchangeable
[40:02] God just just grabbed it out there I
[40:05] said something Tulsa grab it out then I
[40:07] heard it boom he says he says uh quote
[40:11] that and I quoted it Tuesday night I
[40:15] didn't say no more brother must picked
[40:17] it up and the Lord told him to make it
[40:19] present
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:23] tense that's how it comes from the
[40:26] prophet's message
[40:28] and it's here do
[40:31] you do you
[40:33] realize in your six
[40:36] sense I ain't talking about this now the
[40:39] six cense do you realize in there that
[40:43] this is
[40:45] on the third phase started
[40:48] here this revival is on now to the going
[40:53] away nothing can stop it
[40:57] no principality no power no demon things
[41:01] past things present things in the future
[41:04] is already history
[41:06] already God knows all your mistakes down
[41:08] to the resurrection and already forgave
[41:10] you and Justified you you cannot make no
[41:14] mistakes between hand the WRA in the
[41:16] resurrection that's already
[41:19] history glory to
[41:22] God in your sick senses
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:26] [Music]
[41:29] Glory you may be seated so I feel like
[41:31] the third phase has been identified with
[41:33] the manifestation of the ministry of
[41:34] Jesus Christ with healings and sealings
[41:37] and refilling and deliverances Etc
[41:39] what's that word one of the brothers
[41:41] explained that word there I never heard
[41:42] it like that before amen I thought he
[41:44] was speaking in tongues amen yes sir etc
[41:47] etc etc
[41:49] amen glory amen yes sir praise God now I
[41:55] now I believe that uh that now that
[41:58] charity is here it will vindicate the
[42:01] first phase of Brotherly kindness when
[42:04] you had to step out and George and
[42:05] everything was
[42:06] fine and everybody love you for the
[42:09] healing and you know Revelation and and
[42:13] so forth but then when you dropped over
[42:15] to that second phase prophesying
[42:17] rebuking then they all pull
[42:20] away it happens all the time that way
[42:23] and you know we've had it in the message
[42:25] for so many years uh people like to drop
[42:28] down to a lesser level when they don't
[42:31] have inspiration and they don't see God
[42:32] moving with them well well bless God I
[42:35] rather have the wrong Doctrine and have
[42:37] the right Spirit now when while you
[42:40] rebuking spirits and so forth they call
[42:42] your spirit
[42:43] wrong cuz they don't have the same
[42:45] Revelation or inspiration so therefore
[42:47] you got to have the wrong Spirit if
[42:48] you're so mean and hard and rebuking and
[42:51] and busting highs and so
[42:53] [Music]
[42:55] forth see God permit you to go through
[42:58] it to be
[42:59] tested see if they all walk
[43:02] away he only thing you can do is stand
[43:04] there and curse the thing in the name of
[43:06] the
[43:08] Lord praise God cuz it's
[43:12] right amen so you know we heard that so
[43:15] long wrong Doctrine right Spirit praise
[43:18] God brother but that's not going to take
[43:20] you in a
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] Rapture God's Prophet God didn't say
[43:27] sent no Prophet here to give you the
[43:29] right Spirit and the wrong
[43:31] Doctrine he sent a prophet here to give
[43:33] you the right Spirit and the right
[43:36] Doctrine but it's a
[43:40] [Music]
[43:41] revelation then those who don't have the
[43:43] Revelation they call it a wrong
[43:45] Doctrine or whatever amen then they say
[43:48] you're wrong anyway here what the
[43:49] prophets said when they go to fussing by
[43:51] scriptures uh um the godhead explained
[43:54] you may be seated page 15 two brother
[43:57] was arguing about something and as I
[43:59] said to brother sism or Schism and
[44:02] brother NES to answer your question I
[44:04] said now I do not take either side with
[44:07] you uh with you Brethren and I know as
[44:10] long as you fuss you're both wrong see
[44:13] because I would rather be wrong in my
[44:15] Doctrine and right in my heart uh than
[44:18] to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in
[44:20] my heart and they grabbed this you see I
[44:24] said after all it is your brother's it
[44:27] is your heart's condition I made that a
[44:30] practice to know this that if a man no
[44:32] matter what he does and how much he
[44:35] differs in what he says about me if in
[44:38] my heart not from just a duty well he
[44:42] yes well the Lord bless you I forgive
[44:45] you my God yes sir and what he says
[44:50] about me if in my heart not just from a
[44:52] duty but from my heart I can't love that
[44:55] man as well as I love anyone else and I
[44:57] know there is something wrong in here
[45:00] see amen that is right because no matter
[45:04] if he a little brother come not long ago
[45:08] a little Church of Christ brother and
[45:11] and old he stood up there and said this
[45:13] guy is a devil see he said he says
[45:16] there's a Holy Ghost and the man said
[45:18] there's a Holy Ghost in This Church of
[45:19] Christ you're a devil the guy is a devil
[45:23] he says uh he says there's no such a
[45:25] thing only the 12 apostles received the
[45:27] Holy Ghost and Divine Healing was only
[45:28] given to those 12 Apostles and went on
[45:31] about a half an hour and I said just a
[45:33] just a moment brother I think you ought
[45:35] to give me just a chance to defend this
[45:37] see that's all we've been trying to do
[45:39] for 12 years trying to defend these
[45:42] things am praise God I said you said
[45:46] that you spoke where the Bible spoke and
[45:48] was silent where it was silent and he
[45:49] said we do I said now you said there was
[45:52] just the 12 apostles received the Holy
[45:54] Ghost the Bible say there was 12 in the
[45:57] upper room when the Holy Ghost fell
[45:59] women and men and
[46:01] all and would you mind to tell me do you
[46:04] think that Paul didn't have the Holy
[46:06] Ghost and he received a long time after
[46:09] that and you said the gift of healing
[46:11] was only given for the 12 apostles and
[46:13] Steven went down a few days later and he
[46:15] wasn't one of the 12 he wasn't even a
[46:17] preacher he was a deacon and went down
[46:18] to Samaria and cast out
[46:21] Devils
[46:23] amen yes sir praise God and and then uh
[46:27] and I said oh brother it was very silent
[46:31] right there where he had to keep it and
[46:34] and after it was over I said now here's
[46:37] a prophet I forgive you for calling me a
[46:41] devil because I know you didn't mean
[46:45] that yes sir then when he got finished
[46:48] he come up and he said there's one thing
[46:51] I can say you have the spirit of Christ
[46:55] [Applause]
[46:58] praise
[47:01] God
[47:03] Amen so I feel that charity is here on
[47:06] this third
[47:07] phase to anoint our brotherly kindness
[47:11] to forgive those that have called us
[47:15] Devils
[47:17] Cults all kind of ungodly names and
[47:21] cursed you because you dare to step out
[47:25] and say seven thers give faith
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] so now I believe that God will say come
[47:32] and rejoice with us brother I love
[47:35] you from here there be Christ Veil God
[47:40] In the
[47:41] Flesh speaking I forgive
[47:45] you oh praise

[47:54] glory that's the presence you feel right
[47:56] now
[48:00] amen you may be seated you won't have to
[48:03] make you won't have to put it on now cuz
[48:05] it's here
[48:06] now all you got to do is mold yourself
[48:09] into
[48:11] [Music]
[48:12] it my so charity is here to forgive
[48:16] those precious brothers who have called
[48:18] us Devils because we realize that they
[48:21] didn't have the same
[48:23] Revelation and we realize that that
[48:25] those stones had to rub us
[48:28] to make us smooth you
[48:30] know make us five smooth
[48:33] Stones praise God and so they will I
[48:38] believe from here to the resurrection
[48:41] testify that you have the spirit of
[48:44] Christ when no matter what they say they
[48:47] send you dong in the
[48:49] mail you say God bless you brother I
[48:53] love you now don't try to do it out of
[48:55] season like most
[48:57] did there are those who say they believe
[48:59] the S done Revelation I'll trying to do
[49:01] that
[49:02] now Moses tried to go down and delivered
[49:05] him before he had this the spirit
[49:09] amen oh Hallelujah th the
[49:14] glory

[49:59] the house here your
[50:01] houses listen what they saying
[50:05] amen amen you may be seated so praise
[50:10] God omnipotence is ready to do the
[50:12] miracul at the seventh Junction of
[50:15] time my why can I speak just a about 5
[50:21] minutes a few seeds amen okay I'm trying
[50:24] to I don't know how I'm going to be here
[50:26] amen but I want to hit some I won't have
[50:28] time to read this I know I won't but
[50:30] this way a why chist speak page 10 I
[50:34] think any man or woman a boy a girl that
[50:36] takes in everybody and I think an
[50:39] intellectual conception of what they
[50:41] think the word is in so forth can never
[50:44] have a full Foundation stand until they
[50:47] have met that light that brings that
[50:50] word to a
[50:52] reality I think no church in its
[50:54] practice no matter how intellect ual and
[50:57] fundamental it might be that church
[50:59] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[51:02] made known among that people and they
[51:05] see it something that they can talk to
[51:09] uh that'll talk back to them that
[51:12] vindicates the written word you know
[51:15] that
[51:17] voice of the Archangel hanging there in
[51:19] the pill of fire speaking back to you
[51:22] and one day you go into prayer and just
[51:25] be talking all of a sudden voice will
[51:27] speak back yes my daughters rise
[51:32] up amen go tell your husband these words
[51:36] thus sayith the
[51:40] Lord that's what this third phase is all
[51:44] about
[51:46] Glory yes
[51:48] sir oh
[51:52] my now let's drop something in here for
[51:55] Rapture in faith she's going to be so
[51:56] most simple and humble it'll come
[51:59] according to the promised word and
[52:01] they'll be waiting for the I remember I
[52:03] was in the Tabernacle doing the Seven
[52:04] Seals people were sitting there in their
[52:06] five senses and they was waiting some we
[52:09] got back in New York some thought that
[52:11] the angel was going to blow a trumpet
[52:12] with wings in the pulpit and everything
[52:15] and all kind of Revelations my God
[52:18] somebody said uh brother K are you one
[52:20] of the 12 I said one of the 12 I said
[52:24] disciples I said well I don't know about
[52:26] the 12 by one of the
[52:29] disciples so I don't want to get into
[52:31] anything I ain't going to answer you
[52:32] right away until I know what you're
[52:33] talking
[52:34] about
[52:36] Glory praise God page 11 see why cist
[52:42] speak that's our inspiration what are
[52:44] you going to cry about Lord where's the
[52:46] Holy Ghost me
[52:49] speak just as we know page 11 as a man
[52:53] asked me a few moments ago about the
[52:54] coming in the rapture we know that we
[52:56] live the time out the time of the
[52:59] Rapture is at hand and we're looking for
[53:01] a Rapture in faith that can pull the
[53:04] churches together and give it some
[53:06] Supernatural strength that can change
[53:09] these bodies that we live in Now watch
[53:13] how he drops the rapt faith in we see a
[53:17] God that can raise a dead off the
[53:19] floor or out in the yard and bring him
[53:23] back to life again and present him
[53:26] before Forest when we see a God who can
[53:29] take a cancer that's eat a man to a
[53:32] shadow and raise him up to a strong
[53:34] healthy man that ought to give rapturing
[53:38] Faith to the
[53:42] people do you see how that's going to
[53:44] kind of slip in on you and all of a
[53:47] sudden you're going to see sister Carter
[53:48] walking and sister uh bar
[53:51] Trager and our brother here from
[53:54] Florida and some say uh that's a false
[53:59] anointing they call it false anointing
[54:02] it would have already slipped in a c to
[54:04] the prophet's word not what they're
[54:07] calling
[54:07] [Music]
[54:10] it
[54:12] yeah oh it's going to move
[54:16] in see we've been waiting for it just
[54:19] Carter don't you see what that is now
[54:23] it's
[54:24] coming the Rapture in Grace is going
[54:26] going to heal
[54:27] you glory to the power of God going to
[54:30] raise you up out of
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:33] there it's just going to
[54:35] [Applause]
[54:36] [Music]
[54:39] happen yes sir where's it starting
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:47] here maybe seated that ought to give
[54:50] Rapture in faith to the
[54:52] people then when that light flashes from
[54:55] the sky that comes first then that light
[54:58] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[54:59] sounds the body of Christ will be
[55:01] quickly gathered together and changed in
[55:03] a moment and taken to Heaven as all over
[55:04] with and they're still waiting
[55:06] around why say it the scriptures lies
[55:09] must first come why the voice will come
[55:11] back he's already to
[55:13] [Music]

[1:00:39] presence of the son of of the presence
[1:00:41] of the sun we got to be ripened now

[1:32:29] Testament one rapture's passed three's
[1:32:30] happened in the Old Testament of them
[1:32:33] prepared who the word of the Lord came
[1:32:36] to see the word of the Lord came to
[1:32:39] Enoch what was that word of the Lord it
[1:32:41] was a secret in the
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:47] pyramid the second Bible the pyramid was
[1:32:50] the second Bible and it came to
[1:32:52] Enoch but Enoch knew what was inside the
[1:32:55] king's
[1:32:57] chamber so he reflected it on the
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:04] earth and that pyramid prepared
[1:33:09] Enoch the revelation of what was on the
[1:33:13] inside and then the word of the Lord
[1:33:15] came to to
[1:33:17] Elijah and he was a prophecy the word of
[1:33:21] the Lord was Jesus
[1:33:24] and he was raptured and the old Saints
[1:33:27] came up with him open up all ye
[1:33:31] gates oh

[1:33:42] here on God's only provided place of
[1:33:44] worship page 40 let's pick it up here
[1:33:48] amen page 40 our Prophet is God's
[1:33:51] reflector how many knows that the ref
[1:33:54] doesn't reflect itself the reflector
[1:33:55] isn't the reflection there has to be
[1:33:57] something stri the reflector to make it
[1:34:00] reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel
[1:34:02] of God that cannot reflect nothing at
[1:34:04] all but he's in direct line with that
[1:34:08] reflection God to reflect the image of
[1:34:11] Christ the word see nothing else can do
[1:34:13] it you are a reflector that's the reason
[1:34:16] the prophet had to eat the the book
[1:34:18] that's the reason he had to eat the
[1:34:20] scroll he had to reflect that word for
[1:34:22] that age and you got it
[1:34:26] now notice Enoch Enoch's per uh Enoch
[1:34:29] God's perfect reflector in type and he's
[1:34:33] your
[1:34:37] type now watch when God was through with
[1:34:40] him he just translated him took him up
[1:34:44] now watch the mechanics that he had
[1:34:47] reflected become Dynamics with the
[1:34:50] spirit and took them up
[1:34:55] do you see
[1:34:56] it he had to have the spirit of God upon
[1:34:59] him to reflect mechanic CU he knew what
[1:35:01] there was he knew it was faith and
[1:35:03] virtue knowledge and Temperance and
[1:35:04] patience God and brotherly
[1:35:07] kindness amen page 42 now there's a way
[1:35:11] a pure holy way a only meeting place
[1:35:13] that God will meet you not because you
[1:35:15] say God I'm a good Methodist Baptist I'm
[1:35:17] a good Pentecostal no uh because that
[1:35:20] you are in Jesus the word the part of
[1:35:22] the word that's being manifest
[1:35:24] today to today this day's message not
[1:35:28] Luther Wesley Pentecostal here it is now
[1:35:31] but your Jesus the
[1:35:37] reflection so you mean we have come down
[1:35:39] past Pentecost to our
[1:35:42] Jesus the Perfection the word made
[1:35:47] flesh that will reflect the Seven
[1:35:50] Virtues thundering out in sweetness and
[1:35:54] humility walking around the

[1:36:12] already praise
[1:36:14] God glory so now we see en God's perfect
[1:36:20] reflecting type and when God was
[1:36:22] finished with him he was translated the
[1:36:23] mechanics that he had reflected become
[1:36:26] Dynamics with the spirit and took come
[1:36:28] up Enoch built a pyramid reflected the
[1:36:30] Seven Virtues Of The Pyramid a type for
[1:36:33] today then charity love projected itself
[1:36:36] and Sovereign Rapture and Grace took
[1:36:38] over
[1:36:39] Enoch and he was found not but he had a

[2:26:01] happens say it speak
[2:26:04] it watch it materal
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:09] life that you see before it happens and
[2:26:12] then you express it in word form like
[2:26:15] knowing Abraham then the word the word
[2:26:18] seed now is not your thoughts amen so
[2:26:20] word SE it takes a hole in in in into
[2:26:23] your church or in the
[2:26:26] conventions and it has become material
[2:26:29] then the word seed becomes a real
[2:26:32] seed it must be spoken before it can be
[2:26:36] become a real
[2:26:37] seed let there
[2:26:43] be let there be a
[2:26:45] fish and the Holy Ghost follows the word
[2:26:49] wherever he speaks
[2:26:52] [Music]
[2:26:53] [Applause]
[2:26:53] [Music]
[2:26:54] it then the Holy Spirit Broods over that
[2:26:57] word see because it's spoken and it
[2:26:59] cannot return back
[2:27:02] void it must accomplish what it says
[2:27:05] then it Broods around and it becomes a
[2:27:07] real seed and it's real that's what he
[2:27:11] said everything every seed after his own
[2:27:14] kind the Baptist after his own kind the
[2:27:17] Methodist after their own kind
[2:27:18] Pentecostal after their own kind
[2:27:20] in the message after their own kind but
[2:27:22] a PR after his own
[2:27:25] [Music]
[2:27:27] kind yeah oh I don't want to take it too
[2:27:30] long here then it's got to now you
[2:27:33] express it then it becomes not your
[2:27:35] words but God's reveal word express then
[2:27:37] it's got to happen because it was the it
[2:27:39] was the mind of Christ speaking its own
[2:27:41] thoughts for the bride in her season
[2:27:43] then bringing to pass his own thoughts
[2:27:45] into word seeds then becoming real seeds
[2:27:49] once thought and then spoken it's got to
[2:27:53] happen yes sir Malachi 4 was expressing
[2:27:56] in a word message in words the thoughts
[2:27:59] of God and when we by faith can accept
[2:28:03] that word it's got to become
[2:28:07] material that germ in you we can accept
[2:28:11] the word made flesh that has got to
[2:28:14] materialize around that germ that's in
[2:28:17] your soul and there's will be the person
[2:28:21] the real
[2:28:24] seed same with the body the body the new
[2:28:28] body can only materialize around the
[2:28:32] person so what's this wrong Doctrine and
[2:28:35] right Spirit
[2:28:36] [Music]

[2:28:41] school of prophets praise

[2:29:39] still thoughts from Elohim through
[2:29:43] Malachi 4 until the people in this
[2:29:46] message speak these
[2:29:48] thoughts it'll never
[2:29:53] materialize though they in the message
[2:29:56] and though they believe it but they've
[2:29:58] got to speak it if ye say to the
[2:30:02] [Music]
