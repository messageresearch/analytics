TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you're right now in the scripture I want to read from st. John the second First Epistle of John rather the second chapter verses three through five inclusive and Colossians the third chapter verse 16 and 17 next few moments we like to go to the Word of God see what the Lord has for this morning reading from Saint John 14 chapter xxi and that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him see those tremendous promises of God therefore keeping his Commandments first John the second chapter third verse and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he does saith I know him and keep it not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is a love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him Colossians the 3rd chapter 16 verse let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him may the Lord of the blessing of the reading of his word like to tireless little thought this morning identification with the word let's have a word of Prayer how Heavenly Father we can open up the word Lord but you must come down this morning in power by thy spirit Lord and give out the Word of God so Lord we stayin here Lord just to be used this morning if you will Lord we don't say God that you must do it Lord but we stand here by faith Lord believing that the blood of God has sanctified us and that we are in Christ and Lord we expand here Lord Jesus to speak forth the testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of prophecy and Lord we speak forth that word and now may you come down and associate yourself identify yourself with that word God may we only speak that word for that word is life that word is spirit we pray and ask it in Jesus Christ's name and for his glory amen all we certainly praise God for the word of God now I'd like to tie this little thought identification with the word and looking up this word as we have to because we are not intelligent people we have to find out what these words mean to get the inside core meaning of the word and the word identification is looking up in the dictionary and identifying and am identifying or being identified anything by which a person or thing can be identified such as man would say that because he used his driver's license for identification see that's the thing because identifies himself by and I thought a very striking in Webster's and ahead in psycho and analysis it says this an emotional time unconsciously causing a person to think feel act as he imagines the person with whom he has the tide does and I could really opens up something to us and so therefore you can see today that there are many people running around thinking that they are somebody else as you see because these hippies and so forth out here and all spirits are being made manifest and we know that Paul told us in in God's Word to cast down imagination because the outlet the sense of imagination is the outlet where the image for the image forming power is that of the mind see and the imagination is part of the mind and in that sense right there is the power of creation there too because create images and also pictures mental because conceptions and so forth and that's why we see narrow um many people out here now walking around and thinking they're doing God a service and trying to serve God all that's in their minds see to me now they are doing serving God the way they think according to their own imagination they should serve God amen see and so there are others in dinamic because the nominations also Moslems Buddha they'll give their lives to be burned we see it over and Vietnam all the time over there then right they'll sit down there these Buddha priests and pour gasoline on themselves thinking they're doing God a service would we do that thanks be to God we don't have to do that we only have to obey His commandments we only have to obey his words that's just how simple it is that's just how easy it is and we see there that so much of this is going on and then psycho amesys because the part of it now is very important because we are now moving into that mind age see and just before the mind age comes in the mind age is the last days the very last days on the earth that's it there is no more but just before the last days are because arrive but we are in the last day see but there's about three and a half years of last days see and God's prophet told us that the people will go totally insane see then you can imagine their imaginations will create all kinds of pictures and things in their minds and they'll think that they'll see locusts and all kind of animals on earth play it'll be their imaginations you follow me now their minds well therefore our eyes our spirits see in this hour this grace period in here in this silence period this long-suffering in here God Himself come down to his sheep and that they would not go totally insane he said anoint your eyes with the word amen and if you stay with that word you won't imagine nothing else you'll cast down all imaginations you can stare all mental conceptions of what you think God is for he'll come with a message that's him and search the Scriptures for they are they to testify of me not what you think it should be but what it is spoken in the Bible ready that's me the Word of God you follow me now and now you can see why so many are going off in this age they think that God is over there somewhere out in the desert somewhere they think that that's their own mental conception of the Word of God you follow me now so now as we approach these last days when you see all the people out here doing all or these things out here that has to be poor you must enter into the spirit of the last days then when the last days actually arrive they'll just manifest what's in the heart it's harvest but God sent the Holy Spirit amen that we might enter into the Holy Spirit and that is the word you follow me now it's the word its life its spirit and then we anoint our eyes and move in that holy spirit the word and others all outside I can stomp because 25 here he reveals this secret this word this covenant to his elected ones and they have no imaginations no mental conception they say it's the word brother it's the word brother and they stay with head Clerk no matter what happens no matter who fall on the left the right who says what they know what it is for is a revelation from God God has is revealing day by day his word and they keep it keep it means it is a treasure they treasure the word at home every single word of God is a treasure and if a man wants to hide something he goes into his vault hid away somewhere card hasn't fallen hid a heart a man in caught hides his very in this hour in the hearts of his beloved of his bride is hidden a fault and Cotswolds your heart amen and the silence out here they running up and down with mental pictures of what they think it is meanwhile the Brad got the revelation and she's walking right down the path that God has laid out for her amen praise Him praise God so we see that people must get into the spirit first that's why we in our age we can see is that right watch God he speaks a thing first then he gives you time a space of time to see it then if he if the bride believes a word of God and she is now going through this time of space here now she sees the things that he spoke to Malachi the Prophet coming to pass then death faith in that word spoken not gifts are you finally now just a humble prophet of God don't you know that the Prophet represents me holy spirit that's what it was back in Israel's day they didn't have a Holy Ghost the prophets was the Holy Ghost prevail so therefore they all did have to pray get in the spirit for when they the prophets stood there was the spirit of what God wanted to do therefore they had heard the words discern in return and knew what they caught wanted him to do amen and those that hear my words understand that know their God hey Cheryl two mighty exploits so sayeth the word amen so we see them that Jesus Christ the word has prophesied as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is being received is that right he also prophesied that there would be a time of days of the Son of Man and then there wouldn't be no more but there would be many disciples who would after the Son of man has gone off the scene left the word there they would long for him again one of those days they would go out into the dead of summer and look for him the man in the flesh to come back again but there'll be no more days like though message is here when he put it in your hearts in the vault and then you keep them here amen they know their God amen and this thing here now so they enter into the spirit of what God wants them to do by his word then they walk in the spirit and the other side they're walking in this mental conceptions of what they want to do out here now so what is happening here now there's only two places because they go heaven or hell we understand that well these hair are just bodies here see your soul either belongs there are there we're here the space of time for this body to act out where it belongs in to act out what's in it are you following me now so therefore when you see a person moving a certain way you can't help that he's only manifesting showing way come from amen and a Pope spirit come from Hell perdition and she'll go back there so he must manifest himself in all hellishness amen then if a child of God comes from God he goes back to God and he made of his Christ on earth by the Word of God so he's manifesting through this old body here amen and then in time it'll be changed wheels drop this robe of flesh hey man Oh grace of God so we see friends that the word we keep driving home the word that people say well what is it all about it's nothing but Jesus Christ oh where justification was a work of the word hey man sanctification was a work of the word the gifts was a work of the word but the word comes are you following me you don't want to work on the way you want to where all of the workers Elijah was to come forth and sow seeds from Genesis clean through the revelation that's what he did but they don't know what he did he just spoke the word in simplicity and when you receive those words you receive and caught God Himself tabernacle deity in you 12 in you surface look because careful God is dwelling in you right now and then the price is be it unto me according the gifts no according tonight worth she's right now each day he'd be unto me according to thy Commandments whatever you say Lord you follow me now don't worry and many others now are looking for something else but it was prophesized that they would look for a new life the church does but the bride has the revelation she know it's the Word of God so we see now we're in the last days and the people are moving into the spirit of the last so wherever you see them doing if you see a carnal Christian that's disparities in okay there's a seed for him over there and the book of Genesis lot so he can't move Annika as a spirit in her but when you see a person that has met cup and knows their car he is holy he comes away from the filth of the world and he leaves everything on that were in he holds that he keeps it either that's the bride that's somebody as an elected one that's Christ himself in the bride you don't have to spray them you just speak it speak my lord that's all I want to hear it my god speak this let me hear one word of God Amen and I'll do it Lord you don't have to because because Brady and also over and over and over you found enough the bride is right now moving in the spirit of the word of God in holiness hey man she's just moving over she gets to worship she hides it in there and she keeps moving praise God so we see friends the Word of God in the last days second Timothy three Paul prophesied these things and we all know what they are men shall be heady highminded and so forth because trucebreakers false accusers this is race Ryan the Koran Turkey Hill because perverted people all these things have been traffice I'd the Word of God spoken they must be but the greatest thing is when you see them coming to pass that's when you're supposed to rejoice but they can't rejoice they want a sensation they want a hallelujah they want the Holy Spirit to quicken them in a screaming holla that's only a sensation he does it also but if he can only hand somebody who can so see his words coming to pass then that they have joy in their heart as they Lord you spoke it back here assirram the past now there so Philip this new one Ament is stimulated by the revelation of the word of God what being made known that you might see it so when they see it they're errors are annoying it all around and they begin to move in a straight line Amen praise soul we see all others will go crazy out here practice spoken he didn't dwell on it now he spoke it out that's all God don't have to dwell on he just speaks it that's it you don't have to explain it all but the bride she knows that he said that they will go crazy period they will go crazy period that needs no interpretation no explanation what's it mean it means what he said it means they will go crazy that's all they're fool why I just know I'm the bride you follow me now don't worry about what they wanna do amen worry about what you're gonna do but he's only letting you see what's gonna happen to them because they don't keep his covenant yeah but you do you follow man you have bought this pearl of a great price amen so now notice just before parable judgment Falls God he sends a sword the famine the the pestilence plagues and so forth do you know what he's doing he to me is actually declaring war on those people and that's the way he fights with his swords he come with his sword he's declaring war he's actually going to battle against Satan and Satan's people and notice now God first before it can happen must create evil are you watching me amen and he can only because create this evil age by the word now prophets must speak it back there and come and speak it out and then he is actually creating evil before our eyes right now that's the spoken word you're looking for something else like arm to go on no he said I'll create evil you finally met now that'll happen after Shore that didn't crash your eyes without heads and so forth and they'll come together but we speak about his word you may see it out here amen God creates evil okay cookie the scripture for Isaiah 45 gotta read it to you I seal 45 if you wanna write it down 45 5 I am the Lord and there is none else praise God there is no god beside me all right gird thee though thou has not known me see it now we will come back is because later on say you must know God before you can do anything if you're not because you know God how can you do anything you won't know who to obey you follow me now that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the Lord and there is none else i form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil that right I the LORD do all these things drop down he heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness which he has amen let the earth open and she has Eve you understand and let them bring forth because salvation is the seeds coming in friends and let righteousness spring up together I have the Lord have because created also so he creates good right just and he creates evil now which one do we want hey man the righteous is in the Word of God the message amen now notice this now see God because I Evo's what sorrow wretches nice because adversity afflictions or calamities but has never translated sin see for God creates evil only in the sense that he made sorrow and all of these things to be the fruits of unbelief are you following me now if they won't believe he's a good god now but if they won't believe he must create evil for them that they might eat that if they do he creates the righteousness for he is righteousness and they'll eat that the Tree of Life hey man praise God so we see it then then so therefore he gave us this time in here that we might see the evil and we might see the good now outside of the message word there is no good no son are you following what I'm trying to say to you now you see it gonna be it gonna be because very close now Oh outside of the word now is no good no there's none good out here uh-huh see so therefore the only thing that we have to hold on to is him and that's why he also because took away is profit so that that great person might increase in you and he is that great person many brothers they thought it was there by the mere fact that they thought that they was a great person show the kind of spirit to hell not because not of a a homeless man at all if a man is humble he'll never think he is a great person hey man Paul sound the least of all the saints I'm done in two feet so if a man thinks he's great you can discern his spirit by the word Amen he is earning right away other words we have an anointing in us too because teachers you don't need somebody to tell you stop smoking and drinking and be nice they're annoying teach you that amen but God put his gifts here so forth because ministry anointed to bring you the Word of God to live on but the the anointing in you teaches you everyday because how to be Christians amen just put it in order now amen see so now if the people now will have their eyes on knowing it only by the word see then they can repent and turn to God then if they turn to God their hearts are turn back to the faith that was restored back there that's exactly what it means Francie then then if this is all that we can have for life then this is time of identification with the Word of God because we want eternal life then we must identify herself only with this word and he is trying to identify himself with his word see down here somewhere amen he has seeds out here and he is this holy spirit must come down and identify himself with himself the Word of God amen now see we see then that right now is maturing time right nning time we are now identifying our spirits either with the word all the world out here or some denomination somewhere you follow me now see now many are using the creative power of the imagination to form them mental pictures of what they think this message is they don't understand it seen many isms and so forth but it can only come by revelation that's all friends it is a revelation straight from Jesus Christ st. Matthew 11:27 said all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the Sun what the fun now I notice no man knows the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the Son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him so we can only know the father the son by a revelation amen so we see them what God has done for us here in the entire so we see before the last days occur the spirit of the last days comes first then God was obligated to send down a spirit the word that the sons of God would be led by the Spirit of God amen and they walk not after the flesh but they walk in the world and it they keep walking then it be a church and there are dictated by the ways of the flesh and then there's the Coptic the outside is the world outside there and we see a thing because with our eyes now and it's coming a time for the marinade for the whole thing to explode see now thanks be to God we have a message from his prophet a message to tell it how to live what to do and what to expect and also because what to look for see now this is no imagination either you don't have to imagine nothing just hear what he said that's all it is know him you have to imagine anything just listen to what he has said through the Word of God and what has been because reveal on the tapes it dovetailed with the word of God just listen and hear and say Lord open up my heart and reveal thy word to me that I might do it see now back in Daniel 11:32 he's reading back there that this beast that he would come forward pervert the word and seduce all buy it because flatteries flattery see and as such would do wickedly they would be seduced see and because against this covenant Christ the word here see but those he said over there our promise but the people that do know their God see shall be strong and do exploits people that know their God see shall prove themselves win now that they are strong Amen at their standing firm on the message why because the revelation is now supporting them amen they're being supported right now by the revelation of Jesus Christ and then as they mature and ripen they shall do mighty exploits by their God amen is that wonderful promise alright st. John 14 twenty day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you now what a tremendous promise that was to think that we here mortal man would understand all about God and the whole revelation of God so he said at that day what day when the revelation of the three full purpose of God is made known all you listening when the revelation of God's three full purpose is made known then you will know that I am in the father and the Father he is in me and I in you and you in me know where they go for his now the prophet of God revealed a three full purpose of God that God's great secret before the foundation of the world that he wanted to come down and be in Christ his word to reconcile us back to him because his fellowship was broken that's the first fold of it and hold it right there because you're gonna see why is so important after and the second fall was that Christ would be in the bride having the preeminence and the third fold and then husband and wife would go back to eating that's all it was and it's very simple now but at that day you shall know you shall understand that I am in my father and my father he's in me see me now and also I'm in you and you and me well now let's bring it right down to here this is the thing here now when they're wondering if Christ is God's prophet or you follow me friends then wondering if some man if he is Christ they don't know he said but ye shall know ye the bride shall get this revelation that I was in Christ and Christ wasn't me and he isn't he was all one the word is God God in his people down through his word here and that day you shall know when the revelation is made known made manifest see that's the date that because you shall know and in that day he will restore back restores back to the kingdom of God which is to come back as husband and wife and walk there once again in the coolness of the even time there have fellowship with God Almighty Himself amen well this great mystery was the great secret revelation that God had in his mind and he has revealed I don't know I'm very quiet here and the greatest thing of all ages the and the people that they can't grab it the greatest thing to happen was not the gifts of the Holy Spirit friends was that this revelation to really understand that Christ is God himself and that he made it so simple at the simple minor ones would get it they think it's some other thing but it's not is only the word so therefore people get spiritual spiritual by that they sit there and when the word comes is it but he means this know exactly what I said and then when it comes in and you see it and then the joy comes in there it's nothing else now it's only what has been said to me no there's no spiritual spiritual you finally now all relish on Revelation is a revelation and when you see it stimulates you Amen praise God so then the second fall is that Christ may have the preeminence in his church his position his rightful place in the church now how do we have this revelation when he comes we identify himself with him the word then you can look around and discern and see who has identified and is identifying day by day themselves with the word and you don't have nobody gotta tell you anything you see it yourself and the thing goes right on so humble and quiet and they don't know what's going on but it's going on all the time see it's love being perfected in the people and when you have love for your brothers and sisters how can we love God if we don't love one another you see so therefore that's how simple it is he said over hand the 21st verse he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them take my words and put it in his vault in here hold him in there amen don't let Satan because snatch him and Satan can't get in that vault is hidden God Amen he can't get in there he has to repent first and be baptized in his name Amen and be baptized in that place in there then he could come it then he's your brother as a prophet said amen so he can't snatch it out of there he has to repent first and he'll never do that and right he'll never repent see so therefore amen he that keeps the word in the heart that's the one that loves me I love the Lord and hate your brother so cool no you don't love the Lord he said he that loves and keeps my Commandments that does them he loves me and also my father loves him also now if you don't have this revelation you think it's two people up there because loving you right but with the revelation you know is God in Christ loving you it's one amen praise the Lord and another promise to you I will manifest myself to you I will make myself known to you I'll quicken your mind quick and know where their God in you Brit are quick in your remembrance it means make Europe because your memory alive annoying it and make it a lie and remember all things that he spoke on these tapes and so forth he'll bring it back to you just receive it in he's trying to get and we'll show you why I have because in it in a very few moments amen now eat the promise of God that has my Commandments the word message bye-bye revelation now see keeps them put some here in the heart in the vault and holds a minute and then say the lord help me to walk in that pan and doesn't he's dying out to the world amen Holy Spirit is the Dove is that he's a lamb and the Holy Spirit is dwelling with him see these are the ones who really love me not all that say Lord Lord see but those that keep my Commandments amen and what are they search the scriptures they are they to testify that's me scriptures is me see now gosh that he wouldn't manifest himself because to them see so now I'll turn over to Jeremiah and we want to find somebody who identified himself with the word and maybe the Holy Spirit can quicken this to you it's quicker than me and I guess such a joy when I realize the Old Testament because what it was God would come down give his words to his prophets they would just speak the words of God that's all there was and all you had to do was to obey what they said but the religious church people could not do it but he always had a remnant they will do it that's why I said over in Revelation blessed is he that reads the book of Redemption why bless here's why in the Old Testament only the priests read the scriptures you finally now therefore he was a blessed person you are priests and kings of God so you're blessed for the word of the Lord comes to you priests amen you are the priests therefore you got the word to read it now amen praise O God you understand the Holy Spirit was the word in the prophets mouth so you say Lord because come to me Congress because revealed I word he did through the president see but in this Gentile Age with Luther Wesley and the Pentecostals though Gentiles don't understand that so they was waiting for an outpouring but when the outpour he came it comes to a prophet but all the patterns fall do is speak the Holy Spirit that's all and they can't get it they still are going over here and going over there looking for something else and it's the Prophet Hosea has already come the lettering has been pulling out here ready it's just writing to see now it's be done in silence just move it right on down it's in to the spirit of the word of God is moving and all other that's going into the same spirits out there 200 pounds and pals and devils out there they have come into them people out there and we have Christ in us the hope of glory amen the word of the car they ever live in cough Son of Man eat these words son of Adam eat them amen amen Edom eat the word eat the whole room praise God sweet going into the mouth bitter in the belly oh we loved the revelation of it then after we leave and go downstairs do it now uh-huh spinner so my snap in the face you found me I love your brother it's bitter but the flesh must dare gotta die talk against you amen it's bitter Haman you must die but it was sweet when you heard it preached himself when you read it the revelation of it praise huh I'm gonna have a brat glory to calm the bride now die on it uh can you drink this cup you follow me now can you sum up what because with me see it's bitter see me now but eat the whole roll he told Jeremiah I make you a brazen wolf alright I'll make you an ant killer sending me now he has made of iron pillow breathing wall of defense city and he is that city he is head pillow he's made his people you hear therefore going on and speak my words and they'll hate you for it to stay with anyway Jeremiah Jeremiah as we read it all down to day he's suffering that all right and that great chapter did because Jeremiah 23 The Lying prophets did not believe Jeremiah and they'd think today they were out with dreams all kind of things they don't believe the word and Jeremiah here in the a thirtieth chapter he prophesied the word he told his people to go out and give themselves over to these Chaldeans and that this way because they could live him see but they thought that was ridiculous but that was his word see time I know if you read because later on cartagia right there they couldn't receive that they said because Jeremiah wanted to because hurt them and so forth but no less that was God's will for them to go out and give over 2d Chaldeans it sounded crazy to them seeing but that was a word of that was the holy ghost speaking and they rejected the holy ghost speaking through a prophet and there because of that they threw him down in a dungeon no water down admire because how to rats down in a hole everything else don't miss it they put the word of the Lord for the Aged in a hole and I'm dungeon where how they put this message because today it's this is some that they put it in a dungeon they hid it and it got another revelation out there because if they ever get it then you nothing if you ever get the revelation we are nothing it is Christ has the preeminence in the bride of Jesus so they hide that word in a dungeon and they say we are God's people and they all did that God said run through sea to find me a man he had a little man and because Ethiopian eunuch and he made intercession for Jeremiah two kings in a car went down and got because thirty-minute went down and got Jeremiah out of the hole what's he doing here showing you the reliefs among them and Ethiopian you finding out the despised those who they think is nothing how about you today you finally now they will bail out that word you follow me now they will if they got to go into a dungeon if they have to go into a hole a manger but they'll get that word they'll buy and this unit went down in there and brought up the Word of God for the H Jeremiah that was God in Jeremiah the word are you finally friend and today they look on us as that eunuch today we are nothing but it was a eunuch see me now and there he understood that he said my god Jeremiah got the word of the Lord for these people here and they cast it away they didn't want they hid it and put it down in a dungeon amen city man out but what happened he recognized he first see he knew who his his God was amen and because you trust God he always blesses you as we will see now turn over to Jeremiah 39 15 verse 2 loop back around put Jeremiah in a dungeon a filthy place see other words married the same thing say to me and now she ran off with some other man finally now illegitimate see think of Mary carrying the word message she had to suffer all of that abuse from her family and friends and so for that right for it was revealed to Joseph but Mary had to go anyway holding a head high amen a little because about a fourteen-year-old girl going holding up her head high for God revealed to her who that was there and Mary today the breath she's got that word message in here and God has revealed to her who it is and all around here they wonder what is it brother what is it what tape do I have to hear not to tape you got to have Christ in you to reveal it that is it the revelation now notice now because ebed a Melek did that the fifteenth verse now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah into something there the word God speaking right to Jeremiah here's God's will right here now while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying go and speak to a bit Melek but the Ethiopian saying thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel behold I will bring my words watch this now and bring it over here because the day now I will bring my words upon this city for what for evil and not because we're good and they shall be accomplished and that day be before thee see Jeremiah 39:16 see and they shall be a compass and that day before the then this Unicare would have to wait until he saw the evil the Word of God coming to Jeremiah spoken made the manifest then in that day when he'd see that and also in that day because he had a revelation because from God he wouldn't falter you follow me now but I will deliver thee in that day saith the Lord and thou shalt not be given unto the handle of the men of whom they all afraid for I will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou has put that trust in me the word saith the Lord now watch this now this unit identify himself with the word down in this dungeon and right he identified himself with that word Saniya now because he did that God is going to bless him but it's got to be in a day when it's gonna be evil all around for the Word of God C is spoken and when he see all of the evil all around he begins to look up you follow me now before he know he is to be delivered and we have a same promise today so therefore it says that thy life shall be for a prey unto thee see cuz now notice now the eyelash shall before prey unto thee now now where's the prey see a prey is a prize of war plunder because booty that right other words seized by a wild beast see then other words in the time of war they come - because plunder the wives the gold and so forth and take that away so therefore his life C would be unto him as a prey and surprise a reward that God will come and take that prey away or you follow me friends then an hour D the Lariat of Judah had roared the wild beasts of the jungle the line of judgment has roared and we are his prey are you finally friends in this evil day when you see the sword the plagues the pestilence and the lion is wrong a lot cut of spoken I create evil out here we are our life is a prey to him and brother he's swooping down here and taking the prey the life out of here for his war he is fighting now yeah he's come forth now for to clean his own and brother he'll smite the rest of them out here amen he has a sword in his hand you gonna smite him what he want to take out his prey first that's us our lives hey man do you see it friends great why for I didn't find ourself with the word your messages there's nothing else out here for thought at all amen so we see judgment pick up on the church and also because a whole world out here see it's all finished but he will come for his print thanks be to God amen we are the prize of the war that he's fighting now you fought like he's fighting a war with Satan just a word against the nomination and we're the prize glory to God we all deal with war our life which is his life amen so he can't destroy himself that's him hey man praise God we are his bride we are his because in closing what is it is Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you that he has deep preeminence when you see a person soul soul out to the world walking in humility then you know that they don't have the preeminence in their own life somebody else has then what you see look in the Bible and there you'll find it love peace joy and temperance then you know who has the preeminence in that man's life then that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost there you see it you don't have to wonder what is it you see it amen that's God made manifest God walking on two feet in humans here's your baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God you want the one that nothing see to me now why is this friends weak I understand he's got to get that preeminence and we find out why see that he might express his words other words you expressed because your own words but he wants to express his word his wife he's promised certain things here and if he can only get her body and he can suppress his words through then he could come in quicken know his own words in it but he cannot quit in what our minds say can't do it so I feel sorry for those people since their people have gone off on a revelation he can't quicken that it will not rise but his word if his English shall rise the commandments of God shall rise in that day but the others think it won't a white horse ride this and that won't rise well he's a white horse rider comes back with the brat after this time brother amen so therefore that he is promised in the last days and he can bring it to pass because through his body see as he works through the body see what is it just the Word of God made manifest we said well what is the word of the Lord today you follow me now well the word of law today was st. because Malachi 4 then when you saw it there it was it needed no interpretation now the word a lot today was that he would have a people that would so let his words be made known through them love and peace and joy and so forth and also kindness and stick with his word here when you see that you see the because the because he only goes it's right there before you you see it friend so sample see now watch this because in closing listen the this whole work here amen this whole thing here this is God's Word this is a seat all right according to st. Luke 8:11 think is it right the Word of God is a seat see now he gave out gifts back in 1906 but he said now I've I'm gonna have a breath see but only the word can raise up in the resurrection now if I can find a way to get my words into my people and I can only do it through a prophet amen but Malachi prophet there would be a prophet here Elijah so therefore God has the means now now he's got to find the people but he predestinated of people because of either so the words have been spoken and there's an egg out here we are the egg for the word to contact with you follow me now and begin to grow and the word has made contact with the earth I mean it cuz I wouldn't become at the egg the field the fuel is the agency and it has made contact with it and now it's growing is Christ now watch this the whole word is a seed if he can get the seat which is the word and the word is a seven seal message seven thunders that's a seed if I can only get that seven thunders seven seal myth which is a seed into some people's hearts Amy you follow me now if I can only get it in there if I can find somebody hell just listen to me now and I won't want to do something else they won't want to do all signs one of the miracles but I want to get it in first you finally now and once I get it in amen no other seat can come in the wound close up its impregnated that it's dead no other seat can it it won't happen though the seed has made contact with the egg if I can only and then that woman that bride won't receive no other seat for she knows is already as any woman she know she prayed it she's because she knows it she needs nobody to tell she is then if you ever get a spiritual revelation of the seed of God in you you know it brother you need nobody to tell you you know it Mary know it sing Amen now if I can get it in there and it'll take a little while sixty five six seven so far it's growing though and then I've spoken certain things and discerned to them won't be the screaming of Holland no more it'll be my word coming to pass all around amen the word coming to pass made manifest all around so the bride don't know more look for no more sensations hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah she looks for the word being made manifest somewhere she sees the Pope riding the whole world is is because being headed up there so therefore God knew as Satan was ready to ride for Pope John in 62 come forward that right then God knew it so right away the seven seals was revealed to show the pride that she might return and discern and see those pebbles right nothing her eyes don't know it with the word of caught that she could see him moving a man and she lived with no sensation she looking for every word she's searching the Scriptures they all pay to testify of me hey man and it's all in a message seven Thunder message and that misses a seed the seed is Christ the Word of God if I can only get it in there just let me bring it in see into the spiritual wounds and once it get in there made content no other seed comes in that's it amen that's it that's all and you don't have to worry and be scared enough can you identify yourself everyone the faith has been restored so now that the faith has been restored Lord beat on me according to that word Lord God if you want science once Americans beat on the meeting in your season in your time for the word is restored you're finally now love patience joy temperance Lord God work through me live through me Lord as I yield myself to your will your message where amen yeah there's your that's the message you won't know what it is it's just receiving the word and the word is a message amen and then I'll very lives Express what we are and where we are going nothing but perfect love goes up there and all other spirits they go down there you finally now now notice now these spirits data because prosper right now because they people because if blood was around the earth that's why what soon as that person died there's no more blood for them and they go to hell if they have not repented you see it now all of these years the blood has been circling around Earth so the wicked have done wickedly and you wonder well why don't guard because smite him I saw the blood was there go around there see the blood was there for him he loves the sinners that they would repent long-suffering kiss mercies you see it friends so therefore don't get mad at people and these people out here see me now now that but sin the word see and you must receive the word yes where's that now and now because it has come you know the word is now in the word then you see the wickedness now because lift it now but it gradually moves in see because God just because look the clay overlaps see he doesn't because I've because of because it abruptly show you something see he just because I become a deal to you because because day by day see now as we seeing it that is because that water because our faith quickens and we get stronger and stronger we ripen we mature day by day and it's such a solid work that many can't wait so they go off for some other revelations but they did wait upon their car my god they shall mount up with wings as Eagles came in now that we're close to God as the Eagles go as they go to the Sun we go up to God amen praise God now Jesus was God revealed now as I was saying if God can get this seat into a spiritual one he will not worry he won't because he can't fail now he can't do it himself now because he kicked him to himself into it he's got to have the seat in a body to bring to pass his word what has been spoken because for this age now if he got it in the Prophet had faith that it got in somewhere because he sold it hey man and was it was up to God to direct those seats into some spiritual womb somewhere in the world my tape book or what form it is it went there and God knows who they are amen 7,000 they haven't bowed down it needs a veil God knows where they are no matter where they are he's got him there as a witness and he's just saying yesterday today and forever now that seed gets in then it grows it ripens out to about nine months you follow me now fresh then it wants this because ripen out mature see then he can send down the water upon it and it will manifest what he has a lot of for that day which we know is come in the resurrection he has prophesied it will be our resurrection and you are now growing into that resurrection and when the time comes there come out voice of the resurrection and you shall come forth yes Pete on the meek according to that word for the resurrection and whatever supposed to be then it will be done whatever is supposed because to be now is being done what he says full of redundant is being done right now amen closing again amen Jesus was God revealed amen and that was the Word of God now why because it's why God then the case the Word of God so he had to vindicate Jesus for he wasn't a word of God revealed is that right amen see then the church see will be the seventh seal seventh under the message Christ revealed then he must vindicated for it is not them is him the word for he had a space of time in their lives to have the preeminence and because they kept his words in the vault he said I will manifest myself to you I will love him and he loves his bride he's not gonna have a because they hurt she's his prey amen and he is with her right now sitting next to her in her talking to her reveal himself to him right now see it's going on right now it's a secret because of course you'd want right now see then pretty soon he'll come out and say here's my bride it's coming amen see then he will vindicate with science following it the show that it is him you follow me now you'll see the CERN following it it'll be him see cuz God must vindicate his word and his bride is the word the seventh seal message in a very simple praise God then what is is a three-fold mystery see because to the brand God in Christ Christ in the bride heaven deep preeminence to restore back to okay the bride is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh same spirit see the bride is the blood of Jesus Christ by the Spirit because the life is in the blood you are the deep because God's blood is a spirit so the blood is spirit you know and therefore you are the this church is the it is God's blood well it's his spirit now what God did in Christ Christ will do it in the breath coming right back to this free full revelation saying amen why because Adam was the seat of God's Word what Christ's body was the word now let us say now see his body was the Word of God made manifest it could made flesh the word made flesh then if see if then his body was the Word made flesh we come out of his body therefore we're part of the word hey man see you now we're part of his spirit part of his word bone of his bone because that's his flesh therefore you cannot die how can you if that's his body amen okay all hell is against this revelation the devil that's why he sends his ministers against the message to lead you off the message you follow me now then now okay because in closing Christ is the head of the church all right the church is the body Amy come on then then if it's a body is his Brides body right well Christ is the firstfruits of the resurrection he's the head of the bride body which is his body then if the bride body then the Brad body must follow the head for is part of his resurrection in part of the threefold mystery of God now watch it's impossible for it to go it's part of God's mysteries now watch this in the first fruits of the Resurrection Christ the head came up that right he said foxes because they have holes birds have nests the son of man has nowhere to lay his head but in the in turn he's got a buddy amen so therefore how can God only raise the head if it's connected to that body amen if the head come up there pani must arise also for this his body it's the bread dough therefore this head Christ cannot go without the body in the resurrection amen grace how God it's impossible it's the same word see me now is part of the threefold ministry Christ was the first fold of it it's three fold now the second full must be made manifest Christ in you then the third full be because restored back to either so it's all a mystery of God and the first fall has the made manifest Christ also in resurrection Christ now the second fall is being made manifest because of because of because about two now you follow me now friends we are the body he is the head he the body cannot stay here on earth it's got to go up the cup with him he's the head well then the second full of the revelation is that he if he can only get the preeminence and becoming our head then we prove that we are his body and then he has preeminence over the body or you follow me now then you are identified with him you don't have to say him in the message amen you know what to say it you manifested so the body must follow him back the wife follows the husband right back see Brides body then if it's the bride's buddy see this Brides body here if she has a head she recognizes no other hit this no false no one wants it she don't recognize it all she has a hint Christ is the head of the body one hit amen not because because many false no and many heads out there one hit the word Amen praise God amen so now friends in closing the third time this word began to rise Luther Wesley Pentecostals they begin to raise up because we pick up in power right now is coming to the identification time and that's why we are now the green now he can identify himself with the body amen and we now can identify ourselves with him the head so it's coming like this man Steve then the bride becomes the word seeing as the anointing of God the hit comes the voice of the Resurrection then the anointing from the head begins to move down through the body and what you think it's gonna happen in when it begins to move down because through the body of Jesus Christ on earth amen it'll be so identified so completely him it'll be him amen see we're his flesh identification with the word now sending me enough friends praise God when you see the body the green and the headship haven't because preeminence becoming one identification see in the fullness of the measure of his manifestation the word of God amen shows that the body is ready to be received because of because for the rapture ready now almost to be receive for the rapture friends the Prophet he promised it to be a short quick powerful message on earth where Christ will be so identified in that green it'll be him amen same life same spirit same signs same wonders it'll be the spoken word manifest who'll be speaking it you said but Lord I can't do that I know you can't but because who made your mouth amen is that right mostly because he couldn't do he couldn't speak but notice Moses was a God - because Aaron Aaron was the prophetic body amen that spoke only what Moses said then when that body spokes something that the other people wanted it to say God got man amen all the time the body Aaron prophetic body spoke only what God in Moses told him signs wonders miracles a cart moving on got up there to Mount Sinai and a people said Aaron the people don't let no body rich a great for you mother father sister brother don't let him make you compromise for nothing well you are the prophetic body of God see what he says speak what he speaks his word his commandment speak him until you become so one with that word they see us ed well here it comes again the message the message the message one with the word colony now well he must say the message the message the message say but he's showing something amen amen showing something see me now then therefore Aaron was a prophetic Barney that spoke what God in the Prophet said representing God amen so therefore don't ever do that there let those people take what to do over there amen stay with the work I praise all God amen so we see now friends cousin closing now when we see the life has come back in the grain which is now then you know that the rapture is at hand see for its identification time and we are now identify ourselves with the Word of God amen praise God and we know about Ezekiel's bones over there it says son of man because prophesy prophet he prophesized and after a while those bones stood up on the feet and you know because you're now up on the feet now because if she'll also beg because natural bones is back also spiritual force is now on the feet and we're ready for the wind to be because you could blow up on you now amen breathe upon amen praise God so we see friends that the husband-and-wife flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of its were a life of his life spirit of his spirit amen same fruit because it bears record same SC the fruit is the message that's the fruit and a false teaching is not the fruit live it off for the same life because an orange is this message if it's our because a tangerine false no no one live it off the same citrus laughter finally now but the life makes makes it grow and when it grows it shows all the time it's just a tangerine amen but you've grown because you're an orange but the same life is making both grown so the fossil the false only one they must come the light a name that they have got to have the anointing there well the anointing brings out what's inside the fruit amen what is the message it's the word that's what you stay with see let me now friends so we see now let the word of God dwell in us in all wisdom teaching and also add margin one another in love see and as we go along this road here singing and making merry in our hearts unto the Lord amen whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen see that is his three full revelation to his church see boxes they have holes that birds have nests son of man has nowhere to lay his head but he's got a body for he got the seed in see the seeds in the seven seals seven Thunder message is in that's to see the Word of God it's somewhere out here he spoke it out there he said but and when those people that can finally handle the Word of God Amen that seven thunders will shall be because reveal to them you follow me now so therefore are you handling God's Word now you are keeping his Commandments that's all it means to handle it see and put it in here keep it in there amen see now we're doing this through obedience and love is the main thing see and we know then that the love of God is being perfected in us as we move along see and without love you can have faith in all of these things but it won't mean nothing it won't mean one thing friend it's just the amazing grace of God that's what if God [Music] [Music] like [Music] [Applause] see twas grace my Israeli [Applause] ah fresh [Music] stealing [Music]
