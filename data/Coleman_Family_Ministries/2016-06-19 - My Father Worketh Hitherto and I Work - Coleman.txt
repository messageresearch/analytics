TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now let us um turn to the word of the Lord I want to get along with the message tonight and I want to read from St John the 5th chapter uh verse 1-20 and St John the 14th chapter verse 12 shall we stand for the reading of the word I'm reading from St John the 5th chapter after this there was a great feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market pool by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Betha having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk a blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and Trouble the water and whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 3 and8 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steth down before me Jesus saith unto him him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the Sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then asked they him what man is that which saith unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed with not who it was May I strike it again uh and he that was healed wi not who it was he didn't know who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole sin no more l a worse thing come unto thee the man Departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day but Jesus answered them my father worketh hither to and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he had not only broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father making himself equal with God then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise this verely verely is surely surely he's making sure of this for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that you may Marvel St John 1412 um verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father may God a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated i' like to take a thought tonight my father worketh hether to and I work I'd like to recap uh last Wednesday and Sunday just to overlap and catch maybe a straggle that wasn't here last week trying to bring everyone in to where we are standing tonight and um we're were speaking about idols and intellectual conception of Christ and um how the Holy Spirit blessed us Wednesday and Sunday and I want to read something to you and by the way if you could maybe uh between now and Sunday if you could read prayerfully this book Christ is the mystery of God revealed I believe the Lord want to speak to us in there and if the Holy Spirit strikes something mark it down see cuz I want to study it and there something in here and the Lord perhaps want to bring it out to you and it'll be so much better if you have read the book see and when the Holy Spirit strikes things in here then you say oh then it quickened to you you understand now so praise the Lord so now um I want to read something from here um and I was speaking last Wednesday not the thoughts not even being in my heart and the Holy Spirit just said certain things about the Catholic church and whatnot and about fallen angels and things like that so sometimes people are new in the message and I want them to know that that's not me saying that there's a lot of new people here and they might think that I'm saying that some angels fell and those angels are Baptists and methodists and so forth but I want so therefore after preaching that last Wednesday night not even knowing it I happened to go into crisis and messy of God revealed here is the same thing right here so I want to read it to you cuz there are those who don't understand that see you catch blanks sometimes you know they say a fallen angel is a Baptist because they don't get it you know amen but anyway I'm reading from page 79 notice in the in this last days Lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a a hybrid Church a hybrid by hybrid members a hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual man instead of born again man building an intellectual Kingdom that will outshine Christ's little bitty flock see what is that that did that Fallen Angels the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the Angels did and has fell into organizations like Lucifer's main hole at NAA and and what have they done organized a great ecumenical Association of ministers to make an image unto the Beast as the Bible said and building a a Christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like it see Lucifer at work I'm trying to bring you the three4 Revelation a mystery of God what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like Eve did Fallen Angels did and I want to read also from page 27 the same book when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the now watch with the world of man's Wisdom not just because with the world but with the world of man's Wisdom see is that wisdom see and rejecting the authority of God's word does that sound clear the Bible said committing spiritual fornications any word in the Bible That's rejected or if any here it is if any self-interpretation put to it that's why the Holy Spirit drove that down here in New York see self-interpretation put to it is absolutely rejecting and commit an adultery against a god that is your husband an adulterous never enters into the kingdom of God we know that now see that's what Eve done at the first place now notice again now what's the three-fold purpose manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence to what restore back Eden bring back that which lost that was the only thing out of order and all the rest of things was in order my what a powerful statements and so you can understand what we're talking about here and these angels coming down knowing how to worship we speaking last win and there's even a another message I think is enticing Spirits where he really brings it out I think Satan's tail Hooked a third part of them and so forth and brought them down here and then they anoint men and and set up a religious worship see and then they that's the Satan you know and then these Fallen Angels great denominations and then in the last days as brother Bram has warned us false anointed ones angels of light coming with light you see under the anointing now there's a powerful anointing that's almost like the Holy Spirit and this anointing actually thinks it is the Holy Ghost it's deceived itself because you look at these men who are deceived therefore they really believe that that they have the Holy Ghost they shout speak in tongues and get all kind of Revelation everything else and this anointing is found in St Matthew 24:24 for Jesus Christ placed that anointing there he said there would be a spirit in the last day that would think it was almost that it was Christ I actually believe it and only way you can tell the difference is the the word amen thank God for the word see that's they got to go off the word somewhere and you can just stand there with the word and listen to them mhm go ahead go ahead go ahead well uh now brother call you see I said go ahead I'm listening and all the time to scriptures is pouring through my mind trapping them trapping them here and trapping them there and they got the spoken word books all dirty and everything here and maybe because about 14 of them and and a brother come to me uh not long ago and he had about 14 books there he got to the 11th book the real punch line he couldn't find it God had pushed it behind him and he didn't see it I didn't say a word amen he couldn't find it all he had do was to show me the Bible but he had to show certain things in the spoken word book that some angel of Light deceived him with praise God back to the Bible the prophet said that his message brings us back to the Bible if you can't find it in here forget about it cuz his message is the Bible itself explained in our age amen so we are back to the Bible and when they don't want you to read the Bible or take the Bible then you know it's a a false light amen see so now and and this light can only uh deceived Through The Greening period when the the little lambs is just Lings trying to move out and and ripen they don't know what's happening yet powerful ministers come along brother Bram said this and said that and it almost is swing your head see now I remember when God gave a promise to Eve he says multiply and F and and also replenish rather and when he spoke it it was only his word that's right now remember that now it was only the word that's all it was it was an oncoming promise amen and when Mal car for spoke it was only the word oncoming promise am there we are as in that season when he speaks it and God take him away then God allows a false anointed to run into that vacuum and interpret it to you but he gave you the tapes he endeavored to lay it up for you that you might have the mind of Jesus Christ and you wouldn't have to take those angels of light so it's doing this Greening period they would this anoint anointing from St Matthew 24:24 would almost deceive the very elected if possible it would almost do it but see could and it has a almost period like I spoke the other day only during the The Greening period but oh brother let that seed get right and get a real Revelation that Jesus Christ is and then let the Dynamics fall into that church let one of them false anointed ones come on the scene then brother it'll burn up with 1 million votes hey cuz ananas tried and the Holy Spirit spoke right out with 1 million votes and away he went amen see so it's only doing that Greening period and then they come almost to deceive the very elected if possible with head knowledge Goliath and as we were speaking Sunday how Goliath had the church tied down for the last eight years pressed down and many because of unbelief and idols and things that wasn't sure and they were stumbling around and Satan knew that he could do that with your mind CU it's the M age and he could uh Marshall all of his forces from the pit 200,000,000 demons loosed bound at the river Euphrates cannot go into the promised land just uh uh uh just religions and churches they can't go over but they can sure try to deceive you to keep you from going over and that's why I hate those devils and that's why I preach the way I preach and he's mean why you say that brother Coman cuz I hate hate those religious spirits that are bound at the river you fre you should hate them your own self praise God I hate them cuz God has anointed in my eyes to see their dirty works and he said the sons of God are manifested to destroy the works of the devil coming through deceit amen praise the Lord prise God any spirit that would come and tell a a sister to raise up a dress has got to be from the pit an angel of God will tell you lure it you know that's a man of God Amen that's how you can tell sisters when they want you to do the opposite then it's a devil from the pit then don't get if if some Spirit tell you to stop to be cut your here that's the from the pit it's against the word amen don't get mad at the man see cuz he's saying what God Said praise the Lord amen see so now Satan thinks through your mind now Satan is working on that second man that enemy man the outside man is the flesh the the inner man is the mind the spirit and that and our second man the the middl man that's your spirit your mind and it has imagination conscience memory reason affection Satan knows but you don't know it he cannot touch the inside inside man but you don't know it he knows it and therefore the the tape say to let you know he can't touch you cuz you're standing virtuous through the shed blood of Jesus Christ he splashed the blood in this generation and you come forward with his victory but therefore you don't know that and he thinks thoughts through your mind he's getting into that middleman your imagination your memory your affection your conscience and your reasoning that's the way he got you is it just a old flesh pun well he got him in the flesh and he's gone anyway but is that Christian who's trying to do right and he's tearing his mind now your middle man because you have imagination that is the same as the outside man seeing the flesh man see with his natural eyes the spiritual man on the inside he sees with his imagination and the the conscience is smell you can smell something and in your conscience you can tell something's wrong in your conscience just don't feel right you can smell it right away on the inside you smell it smells bad the conscious knows it he knows it ain't right it's it's bad smell amen something smell good then the conscience feels good that right so so therefore there's your smell and your memory of course is your hearing what you hear in the flesh man well inside in the middle man because he has a memory and it's all there in the memory the reasoning is the Taste when you taste it in the flesh man then in the middle man you you're are reasoning it out God said it then you said you begin to taste what God Said to see if it tastes all right it always tastes right to me praise God he's got the right amount of salt and pepper and everything else in each word I don't have to reason to see if it's if it's just right taste right all the time praise the Lord and then then in your human Spirit the devil likes to feel around with your affection and in the outside man he feels with his hand sometimes feels good and he'll drop a funny Spirit upon you in your human Spirit feels good you better get away from there and kind of funny feeling around like in your in your affection bring it to the word of God Amen well he's nice and she's nice well never mind that don't start feeling around whether they're nice or not bring it to the word amen so therefore now see what is he doing he's working through both of these outside men the middle one and the outside fellow well actually the the outside man should be gone anyway should be just this middle man that we're dealing with here see and so that's why he can real deceiving now and then he's trying to think thoughts to show you something with your eye your imagination your middleman's eye is Imagination that right therefore he brings in a picture he got to let your eye see it you see and then your inside man sees this picture of this thing and Paul come along and says cast down your pictures and your imaginations cast down every High thought that's against the word and bring it into captivity to the message the word of God see the you know so I don't care about you I don't care what you imagine cast it down the word says and it tastes good too praise God now so therefore the devil's working on your minds trying to get you to see these things and whatnot with your imaginations and people's imaginations run wild with them that's where you get the fear and things like this the devil gives you a picture of somebody with a long dagger trying to stab you in the back of something and you begin to sweat and run and all kind of crazy things you follow me now resist that fearful Spirit into oliv you amen but now God hides in the control room in the heart making you believe that what he said by Revelation now Revelation is what God Said So that's Revelation and faith is a revelation of what God Said God spoke it and he tells it to you you say oh praise God the Holy Spirit told me so and so and so God said so then you got a revelation Holy Spirit told you it'll be in the Bible here amen see now therefore there is this great battle that we had Sunday and Goliath he defies what God has already said and the Bible's already laid out the early church went forth in power and we have the history then according to 2 Timothy 3 in the last days he and highminded spirit comes forth the intellectual Spirit drops on the church he highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that's a spirit and is only for the land last days is intellectualism and it comes in to do battle against God and God begins to raise up a prophet in 1946 and he comes on the scene out he goes and that spirit is facing him after World War II the days of Miracles is pass and out goes Elijah and his first message that he preaches on the field for healing is David going after Goliath and he pulled his sword and he chopped off Goliath's head and then T Osborne and Tommy Hicks rest of him they pulled their soul and they chopped off the head amen but the main thing that we're talking about is when our David fac Goliath with the Seven Seals against the mind of the devil amen and the Seven Seals the mind of Christ tore down every stronghold of the devil's High thinking and God's mind is on the tapes amen anytime Satan come along with some false only want to try to give you an injection a drug to take you on a little trip somewhere all you got to do is say hold it let me find out God's mind about it amen is here on the tapes in the book somewhere I'll pray to my Lord and I'll fall down I won't receive nothing till God I see it here somewhere and then presently he'll tell you to pick up this spoken word book here or he show you over here and there you see God's mind coming against this strange thought this drug this pet pill coming in to take out of your mind all you got to do is to stay in the word of God don't go running after some false aned one amen see so now God had already said drive out the Giants see and then Israel knew that and they had heard about Moses and David and whatnot I mean Moses and Joshua rather and they know what had happened back there they knew it it was a history had already happened amen but yet the devil come working through their intellect and made them look at Goliath's size my look at the size of them look at those people there what they going to do here see the me now he's he's working through your intellect and working overtime on your imagination and he got you going see and then you can't do nothing but Along Comes a heart with God in the control room God said so he said I'll drive out the Giants I'll dri I spoke that already he only wants somebody to believe it and don't and and move with that right there so therefore he makes you see their size and imagine his story and feir grips and the Revelation comes back like with David the voice of God says I am Jesus I'm the same Jesus that was under the seven seal I'm not all these things that these Fallen Angels say I am I'm not what these guys that they're talking about here in these last days here he said I am the word I don't care what they are saying they are speaking through your intellect they're not speaking by the word of God Amen they're only bringing six seals you understand they are only bringing you the six seals they'll tell you what happen under the 1 2 third fourth fifth and sixth seal but they cannot bring you what's under the seventh seal they got to go off and under the seventh seal is the hidden man of God for the bride to feed on Amen see so now false anointing with self- interpretations and intellect praise God is coming out Goliath the head knowledge amen now Jesus says I am the word of God I under the seventh seal praise God that's me the word what are they talking about all these old funny things I'm only the word and the foxes have holes and the birds have Nest but I can't see the f a few Hearts to nest in where can I I go here I go there they all want to go here they all want to go there but I'm just a word this day and in plain word where can I come to who can I come to the pure unadulterated plain word where can I light at foxes have holes and the birds have Nest but can I find a bride I can get into a heart in the control tower and get in there and speak to her Revelation and have a love affair which is through the word of God that's all I am what are they all talking about going over here and waiting for this and waiting for that I'm here all the time Jesus standing here with dirty feet on who's going to wash my feet and they running all over and and was and living like I don't know what here in the last days oh my God I'm the word of God trying to get the preeminence in your lives the Revelation that I am that I am and I'm here to give you something I'm the word amen and when you get this Revelation as to who I am and as I defeated Goliath Sunday then when you see that I'm Christ been here all the time then you will re announce the idols of the world and then you'll let me come up on the on the altar of your hearts and then I'll do something for you praise the Lord amen see praise God I wanted to read something here about Idols um right if you abide in me the word my word abide in you then you ask what you will because you and the word are the same he has the preeminence he's got the rulership you are a prisoner to him the world is dead you have nothing more you see here it is now you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you don't even care what they're doing cuz you're sold out to it and that's what we want to preach to people like that amen you're a prisoner you're Yol with him and my yoke is easy I do that only which pleases the father and if you can't believe that I am he then believe the word so perfect my let's get into this book amen look at having the revelation of this secret this is a great secret laying under the seven seal now and they look for it in Arizona this place and that place it was right here in Christ is the mystery of God revealed all the time and he looked all around for it see he said having a revelation of this secret made known to them by his grace look when this great re ation uh a revealed mystery is made known to you then you renounce all the things of the world my my my my my that's all there it is the word of God God made the thing so simple and they thought it was uh running over top the Empire State Building and going over here and getting a camper and a this and a that and going over here doing something hard and all they had to do was just stay where they were and take the word that's all it ever was that's the Great secret and let Christ come into you that's all he wanted to do and he made it so simple the message people the dignitaries made a big deal out of it and he just HD himself in humility praise God what a and brother Bram even told us on God hidden in Simplicity you know it we all know it he said now it's going to he said one of these days a fanatic message will pass you right by fanatic message will go right by you and you won't know what it is John's own disciples didn't know who he was he said hold your seats it will repeat again in the last days John who was John Elijah of that day what about the Elijah of Our Day Will his own disciples know who he is no they'll be looking for him to come back again and to fulfill things and here God spoke to my heart a a Saturday and told me to hear uh because events made clear by prophecy Jeffersonville because there are two of them but the one in Jeff and I told my wife said look at here Lane brother brandham trapped him and a certain brother whose mouth is louder than anybody's and he's looking for a certain thing and there I heard him make a pledge brother brandom made them Pledge on that tape that the the Malachi 4 is fulfilled and they pledge it with their own mouths they were witnesses as he made them say it on that tape in jeffon Indiana he says Malachi 4 is fulfilled now I want to do something now pledge with me we have seen the Fulfillment of Malachi for to this generation and they said it it's right on the tape now what are they looking for when they already pledged their Witnesses their own selves and that's when he came back here last week say you we Are Witnesses amen oh it's so simple it's so perfect and they're running all over the place looking for something and it's only the word then he got his seven Thunder word message into a bride and she received it and the the Revival is in her is in her like the welchman it didn't change amen see now the secret of this Christ in me the hope of glory in me forget about the world you mean The God Who created the universe is in me the entire godhead bodily in me in this generation not a portion like Luther and Wesley and Pentecostal but the entire fullness of the word of God is in me GL to god wow who am I we're going to find out tonight praise God we are Messiah amen praise the Lord hallelujah what a secret but it got in it's in this book you read it it's all in here amen it's all there praise the Lord see now subject tonight is Wil thou be made whole amen this was an invitation asked about 2,000 years ago by Jesus to the this lame man here as he walked upon him now note the difference here in St John 56 he's asking a question W Thou made whole he's asking a question of Faith now he's saying do you really want to be made whole to this lame man now he's speaking about a a resurrection power to make him whole now there was impotent folk laying here waiting for healing because because for their bodies and their souls they were weak and sickly and also helpless and they were blind and halt other words because lame had to stop and then sit down rest and then get up and walk again and they were with it paralyzed or shrunk and so forth and they were waiting for the moving of the water and God had always sent a a an angel down to move the water and when the angel dipped in and moved that water they could step in there and they could be healed and and God has done the same thing through the seven Church ages he sent angels to move the water amen arenius and polycarp and St Martin they mve the water and those who stepped in they were healed spiritually and also physically amen and God sent a seventh angel to a lame Hulk blind miserable with it paralyzed church and that seventh angel move the water and praise God uh we come down there a little lame amen not necessarily uh because as worse off as a as many people but we came anyway so what was it it was the heavenly father sending the word in perfect obedience to get one predestinated seed that's all it was and Harry comes on down there to this sheep gate and so now the angel come at a certain season and and whosoever first after the water was troubled stepped in he was made whole you had to step into it now you had to get in the water see amen you had to get in the word not half out and half in get in amen see don't hang outside hang inside but get in the word praise the Lord see now um as the word as the word approaches the man in perfect Obedience of the father and the helpless man he says to him wil thou be made whole and the helpless man said I have no man to put me in I'm not strong enough always got some excuse you follow me now it wasn't because too much wrong with him brother BR said because he may have because he may have had a prostrate or something see now but God sent Jesus to him nevertheless he was predestinated he was the one amen praise God you are the ones God you're the ones I don't care what you feel like but you're the ones amen it's you it's nobody else if if if they if it was them they would they would be here tonight and you'd be outside so therefore the fact that you're he you must be the one amen I mean God knows what he's doing doesn't he I mean he wouldn't get the wrong one he knows who you are praise the Lord Brother have some faith and believe in what you're talking about glory to God Amen so many were worse off you were the one Tony he wouldn't got you and brought you in here at the End Amen you and your family praise the Lord so now this lame man I don't care if he was lame and and come in there he been coming about 38 years he' been dragging he know that there was something there and he would drag his way down there and I can picture him coming down to Beth Sada it was the Gate of mercy and Harry comes down there for some mercy cuz he knows that something's going to happen if he can only get there and he would get there praise God and even if it was 38 years I feel that because he was an elected seat of God there was something in the control room amen there was something inside saying go on down there this is the day so therefore no doubt he purposed in his heart one day amen no doubt he said over and over one day I'll get there I haven't been able to get there for 38 years but one day I will get there so I don't care if you haven't attained that stature that you want one day you will get there amen when you get this purpose in your heart one day I will overcome one day I'll do the things I want to do to please you this man didn't stop one year 2 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 38 years he laid in that condition but one day praise God he had something in his heart pressing on pressing on pressing on one day something is going to happen pray with faith like that God knew his faith he kept coming he kept coming he kept kep coming will keep on coming don't stay home praise God keep coming tonight he may fill you with the Holy Ghost or Sunday or next Wednesday but one day he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost one day he's going to heal you and you're stronger than what you was when you first believed it amen praise God he believed that he would be made whole and he didn't stagger through belief he was strong giving praise to God Amen so praise God tonight that Mercy pool may be in your seat in your heart tonight Jesus can come to your pool in your seat in your home on your job on the subway the bus wherever you are he can come to your pool but just believe one day he will come to your personal pool

Seda amen praise God many time maybe many services here you didn't step in the water when the angel trouble the water here maybe others got anointing next to you we'll come back the next time that's

million dollars sowh I don't care about million do God loves me God loves me God loves me God loves me amen praise the Lord that's all see but you're predestinated to it amen other words Goliath is conquered many of you got to the pool Sunday morning wonderful testimony they finally stepped in the water they finally understood what brother colan was talking about after all these months and years amen they finally grasp it why because you were predestinated to get it Sunday morning cuz you had you said one day I'm going to get it amen now you have the revelation of who you are this morning then rise up take up your bed and walk keep walking then amen don't lay back down again Rise Up In The Name of Christ and take up your bed and walk amen now notice the the persecution for believing what the word said uh his this uh man here he got up he said rise up take up your bed and walk and away he went his faith was a little shaky the lame man was rebuked because for believing that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and doing this last eight years or so uh our faith was a little shaky but we believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and many rebuked you many rebuked you the Jews I'm speaking about the religious Jews in in the message amen amen see praise well you know he believed now the lame man here believed without knowing the scriptures now if he had know the scriptures then he would have known only God could have healed him but the scripture says here that he didn't know who he was when they asked him for a testimony who is this man he didn't know the man's name he didn't know he should have said God did that but he didn't give glory to God because the devil got to his mind and blocked it out he was a Jew that should have known that God heals he had to know that but somehow you are you reading me are you reading me somehow for the last eight years he just couldn't know it was Christ he thought maybe well year but maybe Wednesday I'll get it I just understand Wednesday maybe next Sunday see he just couldn't say it's Jesus and let it go with that had figured it out you know so he couldn't give his the right testimony he was shaky and so have many of us been shaky since since Malachi 4 left we just couldn't figure out just well what is it it's the word that's all it is that's all it was you see and and we had if he had only known it was the word the word said I am the Lord that Health thee he should have known that he was healed but he didn't know that and many though God has done so many things for them the past eight years they still don't give glory to God CU when they they come in the house of God they won't sing and and they won't praise and they so therefore they act like this man here they don't know who it is but if they ever get a revelation Like Sunday Morning who it is then they'll Praise Him and they'll thank him and they say thank you Lord for saving me I'm saved as the song says save save if nothing else happens I'm saved amen that's all God is wanting to get that Glory out of you that's all so therefore uh he did know the word that he was the one that was to come to Israel and though the scripture said so he should have known that that that was the Christ no man can heal but God he should have known that now see but anyway he thought now uh uh what ordinary man could say that other words to him what ordinary man could say that will thou be made whole and then turn around tell them arise take up your bed and walk and you walk that had to be God you understand now see and and then so this man now he had Faith though when this man spoke and he even know who he was he rose up and he walked amen he got up see praise God now uh but he had been saying I don't need any man you see because he don't have a man rather but the revelation of Jesus Christ as of who he is then you don't need a man amen now during this man's testimony here Jesus Christ was hiding by Design you see the man questioned by the Jews could not just come out and give positive answers and neither did God give us the full Revelation when when brother Brenham left so that we could positively come out and tell everybody what's the seven seal is what is the tent and what is so on so we don't know so we're a little shaky you follow me now amen you got it now so we can't positively tell anybody what we're just believing well we believe it so it's a promise amen we don't know what it is we believe it amen so now this man was not sure see he was not sure that because he could reproduce Jesus Christ to them again he he couldn't say for sure because he could you know what I mean now so therefore some feel well if I don't see with my eye maybe it ain't so but God's able anyway amen and then there are those who don't stagger anyway God said so from here they don't look around with their eyes amen they'll look around and see if so and so is here and if this one is here Jesus Christ is here amen that's all I need to be here is him I don't need anybody else here amen praise the Lord see now they because they they had asked a man or what man was that and he didn't know who he was now watch Jesus was hiding because because He Slipped Away and Malachi for slipped away because because God took him away and Jesus is is hiding tonight see and for H years Jesus was hiding just like he was doing here he was just hiding and now after all uh cuz in this day here after all who had heard of some man in their day doing the works of God after Moses and Joshua and also Elijah what man could do those kind of works after them you understand me now who had ever heard of that you understand now people want to know the the Jews today want to know after Malachi 4 left whoever heard anybody raising the dead and doing these things it's all over with the seven Church ages finished what are you talking about he which is perfect is come we heard it all whoever heard raising the dead and because because casting our devils and doing the works of God after Malachai for left whoever heard of that my my my well sir I I I suppose we all know that one there huh amen now who told you to pray for the sink Malachi 4 is gone who told you to do that how dare you the Jews you know the Jews the Orthodox Jews see now praise God well then when you get out there you sort of hold your peace down at Jeff you go eat and you talk and you're going back home but when you get back here Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I know who he is I know that I know that I know praise God and like Peter you say be it known to all of you that by the name of Jesus Christ and even by him do we do the works of God by the name of Jesus Christ by the person the nature the teachings we come in the name of the Lord do the works of the Lord praise God so now during this hiding period the Sheep not quite sure they ain't quite positive yet they're a little shaky you understand and so see it's a revelation of Christ and they believe and because however after about 8 years now of little shaky and they they believe though see uh uh having a test and giving out their testimonies to the husband and wives and family and jobs and sometime because because they trap a lot of times now that's all right God's only testing you he sends a trap for you to see if you still believe it amen see and but you are predestinated you're going to believe it amen sometime because you come in here with your Tails down amen but you still believe it amen and he just rubs you down nice and then you feel better you purr in amen wonderful praise the Lord see now we see over here in the 13th verse here and and he that was healed with not who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole S no more L A worst thing come unto thee why now look what happened here Jesus Christ here the word returns back in the voice of the resurrection and does he find this man there's no more pastors and we don't have to come together does he find him in some house somewhere all messed up in some sinful condition no he finds a little lame ones here tonight and they ain't quite sure but to hear nobody got to tell them to assemble yourselves together that's in the word because they believe that and they're in the temple they're in God's house cuz they love God and they're here and that's where when the voice of the Resurrection comes back around and rides that trail the second time that's where he finds them at oh praise God amen not in a dead spirit and not hardly singing and whatnot but they're praising God and they're giving glory to God how are you brother and they're given mercy and love out and they arrive unto Christ that's the attitude that's the frame of mind that's how he finds them on one Accord sitting just like that though a little shaky ain't quite positive but then something begin to move and he they saw the sword chop off Goliath's head and it got stronger amen and they're assembling tonight amen praise the Lord and they're praising thanking God for making them whole and one thing they know that they rose up and took up the bed and they've been walking since 1965 that's the only thing that they can say I'm not what I want to be but I sure ain't what I used to be amen and I'm walking in the light praise God now here they are in the temple and they have the right mind the right attitude they in they praying and they're praising God and now the word comes back around for vind ation confirmation here he comes here amen the second time around and then he says behold Thou Art made whole my the voice of the Resurrection speaking back you are whole now they was already whole but they had to believe it they had to take up their own bed and walk but this time he says behold Thou Art whole period that's it now that's Revelation that's Faith that's God speaking the voice of the Resurrection into your hearts and a voice drops down and speaks child of God Thou Art whole amen can't nothing happen to you after that one cuz God do spoke to you by his word the same voice that spoke through Malachi 4 has promised to return back and speak again amen here he comes wil thou be made home that was the first time cring your faith will will you be made whole and the man had the faith brother Ben so he says yes amen he said well rise up and take up your bed and walk amen begin to walk here's because here's your promises walk in your promises there and he began to walk for about eight years in the promises praise God now God gave him a message of Salvation And also healing through Malachi 4 he says Rise take up your bed and walk every promise is for you and he began to walk he began to testify little shaky but he kept going now he could not positively exactly explain what it was fully about to those Jews see can't get around those Jews out there one they standing around you know what is this here it's that is this you see but now when that same watch him now praise the Lord here he comes now when the voice speaks the second time what does it say over here um afterward Jesus find him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole S no more L A worst thing come unto thee th man departed and told the Jews he went to those Jews himself amen here he comes praise God full of Faith charity up on him now added to his patience and so forth Harry comes with the baptism of the true Holy Ghost amen and he seeks those Jews out like David did David hasted and ran to Goliath to tell that intellectual believer something amen so it says over here the man departed and told the Jew that it was Jesus there it is praise God which had made him whole he knew cuz the voice spoke back behold Thou Art whole so he knew the voice of the Resurrection not another man it's just Christ's voice speaking back that you hold praise God and that voice says sin no more that's a Greek word uh h a m a r t i a and that Greek word means missing the mark and moral sense amen now a sin whether by Omission or Commission in thought word or deed Christ came to teach men how to shoot straight straight Shooters you understand and to hit the bullseye every time oh my Pentecostal miss it blam blam blam but Malachi for with Christ taught us to shoot straight and hit the mark every time with the word of God Jesus Christ the same Bam Bam yesterday today and forever right on the bullseye now do you see what sin is the unbelief you missed the mark with your unbelief but the word of God has taught us here for 10 years how to hit the mark amen oh my praise the Lord there it is you believe that friends my this lame man sinned now notice he missed the mark he did not understand that only God could have healed him you got it cuz if he had said it was Jesus where did he get Jesus Christ's name from here it was revealed to him here it doesn't say here I'm Jesus he never says that I'm Jesus he said it was Jesus he had to have a revelation from somewhere amen he know the first time now what was I I speaking about Sunday the name of the Lord you got it now amen see now he had missed the mark he should have known that only God only God could have healed him then and we should have known that only God could have done all these things here there's no men here doing that we should have known only God could come down through Malachi 4 and open them Seven Seals and call us when the fact the very fact that we even heard about a prophet was enough that's right that was it right there nothing there's no more David hurled the stone of Salvation to the head that's that's the finish of it right there we should have known and we should have been so on fire for the past eight years just to than that God let us see them see our names we were looking over Jesus Christ shoulder and when he was going through the name here wait a minute that's my name there Lord that's my name right there who right there praise God I saw my name and so you saw your name and Jesus turned around and look at you you fainted when you saw your name something swept over you when that love looked at you like that it was splashed in the blood of Jesus Christ oh praise God what a positive Revelation positive behold Thou Art made whole you know that you know that you know why God said so now you got faith out he goes and blast those Jews out there now we should have known that only God could have done all these things here how much more Glory would God have gotten these past eight years my God my God had to beg and persuade people for what you looked over his shoulder you saw your name in the book you even told him wait a minute that's that's my name there amen that's why you're here and so here we are praise God got something to read here I don't hold you much longer amen uh page 70 the same book I'm reading out of here I'm getting a real blessing in this book here amen and so you read it is it's loaded and it's in the season uh page 70 his presence in the individual with a personal a Vindication like what I'm speaking about this second time here now see personal a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual do you get that excuse me not with the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostal but as an individual I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them that's right there'll be two in the field I'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed I take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world there it is and those kind of people you call them crazy what's wrong with them brother they have passed over they're gone they finished with it's all over with because with them they done shut the veil behind them and the world is outside they don't even want to hear about the world they want to live in a Shina Glory they don't want to leave their ort praise God Amen having this revelation like this lame man got the second time it was Jesus he renounced everything out there I don't want no Idols I don't want nothing like this old colored man when he got to Heaven he said he didn't want a crown he just want to see Jesus amen that's all Just to See Jesus what a revelation he had amen so now Jesus says here now sin no more don't you miss the mark by not giving me Glory during those eight years did you get it yeah don't miss the mark no more for a worst thing will come unto thee now I don't have to tell you what's left for because all for about 3 and 1/2 years here this is it holy spirit speaking now don't sin no more and missing the mark and not giving glory to God for what I've done for you and what I'm doing for you tonight and what I will do for you tomorrow don't miss the mark no more that's it praise the Lord amen that's it amen cuz the voice is almost up on top of you to find you in the temple that's how close it is don't sin no more praise God when Christ appeared the second time and revealed what had actually happened from 1963 through 74 that indeed he was made whole this man I'm just bringing overhead to today now see that you are complete made whole and Paul pray that you would be presented holy Body Soul and Spirit then he's made you whole your body your spirit and your soul amen the word is in your soul and the anointing is coming down charity to not only Reb baptizing the soul or baptizing the soul but also quicking your mortal bodies and in the resurrection brother it says that the body the the glorified body shall materialize around the word around the word now watch it catch it when Christ the seven Thunders spoke Resurrection through Malachi 4 into your heart in the control tower when you get to the resurrection that Resurrection word in season over in the resurrection materializes a body around the word in your heart that he spoke in you through the message that's what was under the seventh seal your resurrection and your rapture all in there already my praise God that's why the devil is howling against this message of the word is all in the bride Resurrection is in You Tonight Rapture and Grace is in you tonight wedding supper the promises is in you tonight he put it in you future

they talking about that's Jesus Christ the word it's all it is is that simple in me is healing in me is comfort love and peace and joy it's all in me I don't have to ask any man something fleshy like a man he ain't got a heaven he ain't got a hell to put in Christ man that man don't ever look to a fleshy man Immortal no man but the man Christ Jesus running around looking for false and earned men they ain't got nothing the angels of light just see praise God oh I believe he likes that praise God I love to please my Lord and brag on Jesus Christ to his loves his bride out here I ain't preaching

colan you got holy boldness I said well thank God for the holy BS I'll blast the sin out of Jamaica down here amen praise God so now they to run me out of there amen verse 12 and 13 now now then when they asked him over here see he wasn't quite sure uh about Jesus the word and now after Sunday morning that the head knowledge is gone the Revelation is ringing in your hearts now and even getting more up it amen see you're seeing that is really Christ you know why because he slayed Goliath in New York that's why amen and you got to and you actually got your swords drawn tonight I can feel it for Revelation is pouring down into the pulpit amen while your swords are out and you're chopping off the imagination you're chopping off the reasoning the taste buds you're chopping It Off and you're taking the word just as it is amen you don't want anything you want to sugarcoat it you want it right down the PIP praise God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord oh thank God this is church night tonight amen glory to God there Believers in here amen praise the Lord told the Jews that it was Jesus that made me whole oh wait now the first time it was his soul and body the second time he come back around and he straightened out that head knowledge in the mind the imagination and memory he swept the Holy Ghost over top the whole thing and the Veil come down my then the battle was on now listen now 15 through 20 here the man imparted and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole and therefore did did the Jews now watch it persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day but but Jesus answered them my father praise God here's my title my father worketh hither to and I work therefore the Jews sought to more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said also that Jesus was his father making himself equal with God then answered Jesus and said unto them verily ver I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all all things that himself doeth and he will show him a Greater Works than these that you may Marvel now let's close out here praise the Lord for another 15 minutes here now here we are the battle is on now the man received rapt in faith amen he knew it was Jesus the Christ rode the trail and found him in the temple and filled him with the Holy Ghost he's a changed man now amen he ain't Shak you no more brother Ben hey he knows who he is now see and he goes out to face those in the mid that you ain't sure amen see he tells them it's Jesus Through Malachi 4 is Jesus here right now present tense praise God and man did those Jews bristle so then it brings on a a a spiritual persecution now and they're mad they don't want to help by Jesus because they're waiting for other things to happen yet you understand but these people here these lame ones that were lame Christ has Revisited them the second time and give them positive faith and they know what they talking about now brother amen see then the importent man's Faith was Vindicated so Jesus Christ Vindicated your faith for believing without seeing amen praise God then the man reported to the Jews with great power to witness it was Jesus who did it in the first time through Malachi 4 and the man told me he's riding the trail now brother you wait till that strike to feel somebody can stand up and says now he's riding the trail I don't know what you're talking about but he's here now present tense praise God Amen yes sir is this the hour for that to happen I believe with all my heart praise God it is the hour that the bride by Revelation knows that Jesus is the headship and not Goliath she finally knows it is Christ The Secret under the seventh seal that is the headship and not the big old Goliath that says it's this and it's that but it's Christ in you the hope of glory my what a headship brother Joe oh then with that headship Psalm 133 the precious ointment runs down the skirts all over the body God and anoints the body and the head is in unity with the body once again you see a perfect man then my standing there with his measure of the fullness of Christ amen then he's got one Lord One Faith one God one baptism oh he's ready now he's over in Ephesians standing over there hold out the sword the helmet it's on he's glory to God he's a real powerful believer amen he's ready to launch out he's ready to go now he's chomping at the bit to tell him that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen if it is then you better watch out for this reaction to your action yeah cuz here is the reaction those Jews come to persecute Jesus now watch this now but when they come on the scene after you testified the second time now had they come ready to mash on you but now Watch What Happens here now the first time this man believe and Jesus hid away and let him stumble along giv his testimony maturing and and ripening you follow me now and Jesus just watched the whole thing he wasn't going to let you fall you're still here tonight amen he wants you to have some experiences experiences is Money in the Bank amen you got plenty of money in the bank haven't you just reach into your pocket go way back to 1963 amen and you're loaded with the word experiences it's Rich you wouldn't trade them for nothing amen amen cuz he brought you through every one of them praise God so you're rich amen now in this first time he wasn't quite sure and now the second time positive faith for the voice said you're whole the voice said you're mind the voice of the Resurrection comes back and speaks to you he spoke to you through his worri for eight years or so but when he comes back with a few words and just speak something to you in your home and if your sister there washing your parts and pants making up the bed brother Brown said when a real Revival is on the the the maids can't make up the bed and they can't cook the meals they can't do nothing The Knowing is all over the room all over the place you're saying glory to God and you hear that Heavenly chorus and you sing it if you can't even sing amen praise the Lord amen you sing anyway praise the Lord something is happening the holy spirit is anointing you all over the place and you're giving praise to God you're having a a jubilee in your own home and your husband or job's having the same thing and think he's nuts they go ahead and call the old Patty wagon for him pack him out he goes to jail the angel of Lord comes out and lets him out praise the Lord amen we're having a wonderful time brother praise the Lord that's all it is it's Jesus Christ reappearing on the scene as the voice of the Resurrection now when he went out blasting out here this lame man here and they come at him they come to persecute Jesus now the second time Jesus who hit the first time the past eight years now he reappears on the scene in power oh my where's he standing right behind you the bible say that the Lord went with them everywhere confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles the pill of fire comes down and goes with you and settles right over you the canopy of life is draped over you and but they don't see him and when they fly against the word cuz you speak positive here they come he's right there like he was with annias and Safar he was right there amen praise praise the Lord so Christ reappears in the open to take up to challenge himself why for Sunday morning for the battle is the Lord's amen you understand now it's not our battle it's his battle so he descends in a pill of fire and he takes his own battle he said I'm the captain of the host here amen praise God for the Jews to come against the word he re he because he appear as a confirmation of the man's positive Faith the man this time said by revealed faith it was Jesus Jesus appeared in the open to confirm what it said my I like that positive faces is Jesus he stands right there with the man and confirms every word the man says amen praise God and why he taught us how to hit the bullseye no more missing amen no more I think so it is there it is no more missing the mark he taught us through Malachi for the hit that Bullseye every time Amen brother Carl praise the Lord he said I'm not dead here I am I'm in my bride right here and Jesus answered them at this time the word answered them the word wasn't hiding now he was there and he stood there he said my father worketh hether to and I work oh my mighty hour is here for the bread to say my father work hither to and I work he said my father work hither to and I work my father has worked even until now he has never ceased working this is what he's telling them now see he is still working he's laying in here now and I must be at his Divine work amen now he was working the works that the father gave him to do that right and since the father worked on the Sabbath here we go now they were mad because he was working on the Sabbath he like that see and then when he says my father they had another charge Oh my he was claiming deity you got it now my father he must have said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God inequality with with God in power because verse 19 and verse 20 because he also claimed because equality with God in works so he claimed equality with God in nature in power and and works and they was really stirred up now so now St John 3:34 for whom God has sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him John said so amen my father working hither to and I work now he is referring to the delegated because Authority given him because Hebrews let me see I got a scripture here Hebrews I have many more but I'll just chop it down I don't want hold longer I want to hurry along sister uh God who has hundred times and in diverse maners spake and time pass unto the fathers by the prophet hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed ear of All Things by whom also he made the worlds there he was amen he knew what he was talking about and they understand that so therefore he had Authority now God works on the Sabbath as well as on other days in upholding the the universe and running is infinite mechanism amen so he's working every day his word is at work holding up this universe on the Sabbath and every other day amen so Jesus knew that so he said my father work at H he's still working right now and I work also amen praise he ain't never stop praise God see he works in Providence watching over and also caring for the uh dependent because creation he watches over his flowers his lies and plants and trees and whatnot and he cares for it he gives it rainfall and whatnot he's still working amen praise Lord is that simple praise praise God Amen see so now here Christ worked in in healing on the Sabbath and also uh because providing food for the hungry and also uh because uh providing acts of mercy and love Devil's mad that's all right so since the father worked on Sabbath he did too the same lord of the Sabbath will work in the true Sabbath the rest with any true seed who will believe him did you hear what I said who rest who Sabbath the Sabbath is the Holy Ghost amen so Christ the father work on the Sabbath every day therefore Christ works in the true Sabbath which is the Holy Ghost amen he works saving healing comforting in the Sabbath on the Sabbath the Sabbath is the rest that is the Sabbath praise God Amen so therefore he saids my father work hither to and I work also praise God and we have a promise verily verily I say unto thee he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also so then if our father's working and also Christ is working we work H the two also amen because we are in the Sabbath amen praise the Lord in Jesus Christ you get it hope you get it amen as Christ has worked during his Sabbath the Holy Ghost say it P out on day of Pentecost he been working for almost 2,000 years amen and every generation pulling them out and healing them and saving them everything else Healing The Sick and casting out Devils he's been working on the Sabbath wow amen he worked in the early church on the Sabbath with great power gave the apostles a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen so can't we do the same thing can't we say that the uh Christ worketh H or two and we work also amen praise the Lord now many think many think because uh brother Bram left you're not supposed to do things on this true Holy Spirit rest Sabbath you know they think if he left he was the only one that's supposed to do anything on the Sabbath the Sabbath is here well then my father working here through and I work also amen he a't never stop breaking and they figur because Malachi for El we were supposed to lay down and wait for a certain thing no sir I said my father working here to and I got to go to work brother and I went to work and we all did amen amen praise God so therefore now if it was the father's will then so is it now but Jesus answered to them and said my father work here to and I work the bride says the same thing through a promise St John 14:12 brother here we do you realize thank the Lord 9:30 I wanted to finish by 9:30 do you realize what's been said tonight my mouth is tongue tied and devil trying to make me stammer and everything that's all right I'm eating grapes and everything else it's all right now now listen here friends I want to get this thought to you the devil hates this now you don't know how far you have come my God you don't know the Deliverance that God has wrought in the last three messages oh my tonight I tell you if you only knew the angels are gathered all over this place here the anointing of God is here is free the free has been in a long time the little ones is getting it amen and they see that it's Christ the word that's the the devil is howling and he's mad he don't want you to know it's the word cuz if you ever get that secret that Revelation then it's finished with your work is finished you walk in here you sit down my heavenly father is here the power of God is here and we on the Sabbath he's working amen praise the Lord he's working for me it's all over I don't have to figure have to reason figure imagine do nothing is finished with I'm resting on his Sabbath and he's working my works is finished trying to figure it out through this intellect it's all over with amen then if that is the case if you get to that spot tonight then we are Messiah it's Amen claiming God as our father amen claiming equality with God as our father in power and in works the exact same thing he claimed and the prophet of God told us that we are Messiahs we come from our father we was with him as attributes amen amen we are part of the father we are part of his nature we are words absolute words of God and we are here to Proclaim his name we got words to make make known and do his work we got a threefold mission and he's coming back he's finding us in the temple he's going to tell us behold Thou Art made whole and when that strikes us the way we go amen that hour is upon us praise God to say my father worketh hither to in I work can we say it tonight can we say that tonight do you love him our father works H to on the Sabbath is my thought you understand then no man supposed to work on the Sabbath your works is finished with it's all over with amen he said I'll give you rest that's why God said he going to bring an end to man-made sabbaths laws and rituals he's the Sabbath praise God did you get the message tonight thank you Lord didn't you just love the Lord the way he opened his word I really really got blessed tonight and preaching the word I got so much for myself just a real blessing so I trust and pray that the little lambs uh understand forget about Goliath it's all finish with rest this is the rest in the weary land my God now what we going to do we're going to hold to God's unchanging hand amen praise God oh to
