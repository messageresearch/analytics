thou are not far from the kingdom praise God Amen Blessed Be the name of the Lord praise God would you open your Bibles just for a reading of the word just a few comments tonight want to get you on the road amen and may the Lord richly bless you for coming out in this bad weather tonight but I just felt the holy spirit says no you have the service amen and the ones out of town most them have gone home amen then but be be careful out in Long Island the sight streets that icy and slick and watch the interor and places like that you have to watch the interor every day anyway whether it's the sun is shining on there amen but uh praise God so amen it's one road I only like to take that one amen uh Joshua the 13th chapter just a few comments have a few leftover thoughts from this morning Hall that so many things was going on in here I tell you if you knew the spirits that was here this morning the the the people that came in here with odd strange things on them my it was really something so it kind of took me away from my main thought amen but the Lord knows now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and stricken in years and there remain yet very much land to be possessed this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the Philistines and all gurai from sior which is before Egypt even unto the borders of the erron northw which is counted to the Canaanite five Lords of the Philistines the the gites and the asites and the uh the escit and the gites and the aconites also the aites all the vites amen we amen we have dominion over all of them praise God amen every fight amen judges the first chapter judges the 1 chapter verse 19 and um verse 19 judges first chapter and the Lord and the Lord was with Judah and he drave out the the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had Chariots of iron verse 21 and the children children of Benjamin did not drive out the jees the the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell in the dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day and verse 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor tenoch and her towns nor the inhabitants of door and her towns nor the inhabitants of IIM and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land in verse 29 neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in gazar but the Canaanites dwelt and gazed among them verse 30 neither did zebon drive out the inhabits of KRON nor the inhabitants ofo but the the Canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries and verse 31 neither aser drive out the inhabits of AOL nor the inhabits of zidon nor of a Arab and nor of aib nor of halba nor of AIC nor of Rahab in verse 33 neither did napali drive out the inhabitants of Beth shesh and nor the inhabitants of Beth but he dwelt among the Canaanites inhabits of the land nevertheless the inhabits of Beth shth and of Beth anth became the tributaries unto them so we see they didn't drive it out my and they remain yet today oh what it means obedience praise God judges 2 vers 20 and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I have commanded their fathers and have not hearkened to my voice I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as the fathers did Keep It or Not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua may God the blessing to reading of his word you may be seated well praise the Lord so just a few comments so I like a little thought for the tape play of trying so now we got two places of trying we got we in the message we in adoption time and we're going to have those that's going to have their their inheritance going to come down the Dynamics and they're not going to drive out the Philistines then there going to be some calebs that's going to drive them out so make up your mind which group are you in so I call it place of trying because Caleb will be Tried by the Giants and the church they will be tried also but the one's going to make it and the one is not going to make it so now listen I'm going to speak some things now this other group that won't put them Philistines out and put their churches in order they will be trying for three and A2 years in the tribulation period but there's a bride Hallelujah there's some calebs that has a little short message that will shake the whole nation what is that message you may be seated what is that message that there's actually in the 20th century a few people that God has predestinated [Applause] now either there's going to be a spiritual adoption or there's not going to be now I'm not talking about physical adoption that comes in the resurrection and many pastors don't know nothing split beans from coffee about spiritual [Music] adoption they don't know the message they over in Romans 8 but I'm talking about Ephesians 1: 15 I'm talking about Apostles and Prophets and pastors Evangel teachers I'm talking about coming to the unity of a faith I'm talking about one God one Lord One Faith one baptism praise God I ain't talking about hoping so maybe so I might make it a resurrection listen here I have more faith listen listen to the statement now I have more faith to be adopted like the prophet was and then go in Resurrection rather than being state I'm in now and going in Resurrection why because this is my season this is adoption time just the same as Luther was justified the Wesley was Sanctified the Pentecost received the Holy Ghost praise God you're going to be adopted not in the resurrection before the Resurrection let me say it good before the resurrection before the resurrection God Amen God did not bring us out here for 20 years to let us go through the tribulation period he brought out here you are predestinated to take that glorious stand of perfect man on this Earth before the resurrection do you have faith yes I have faith seven Thunders gives me that Faith there's no devil of unbelief is going to tell me anything else Malachi 4 said so do you realize God raised up Malachi 4 to be the first son adopted son and it shall be more he's the first corn to come to Perfection but there will be more that's why we're here that's why God called you out God is going to prove to Satan he's going to have some more adoms praise God you may be seated glory to God this is our message all kind of unbelief in the message they don't believe adoption they don't believe this they don't believe that what do they believe amen is in my heart as a man thinketh in his heart so he is so if you don't think you're going to make it you will not make it but if you know you was in Elohim where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning Stars hang together you was there shouting and praising and thanking God for the [Applause] adoption Hallelujah Glory hallelujah praise God glory I'm about my father's business vindicating these Mysteries oh you may be seated praise God the seat shall not be able to shook praise God people don't even know the message if you don't know the message you keep quiet yes amen page 28 see shall be able to shook paragraph 145 but watch there will not be any more organizations after this watch the word itself yet 12 years old just a little bitty thing back in the shook he said don't you know I must be about my father's business the word corrected the church right there 1965 you was way back in the Shu hallelujah praise God you understand what I'm saying what are you what are you doing these things for you know you can't do this here we close up our doors don't bring your s thund meetings around here we can't have it the word corrects the [Applause] church amen uh for you know not that I must be about my father's business sure the true Supernatural charm now paragraph 150 a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same things that he did now either the prophet lied come on he said a [Applause] spirit this Spirit came upon you in 1965 to do the same things that the prophet did and Jesus did St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I tell you these intellectual chant is not coming they're here now you got to bust them off your Mountain may be seated a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same things that he did see here it is it's reproducing again of the grain A reproduction of the grain that wasn't and William brandom that was a reproduction of Christ it wasn't brother brandom it was Christ it won't be you it be Christ you ain't got nothing to do with it your mind imagination all gared up it is God Tabernacle deity coming in a Spirit upon you don't put your mind in it this is a message I Don't Preach like this in South Africa now cuz they wouldn't receive it or Europe or nowhere else I pr like in New York [Applause] City I got Authority here praise God amen you may be seated I have authority in New York City this is my inheritance Heen may be seated I have authority in pen Harris that's why I run the scornful Devils out of [Applause] there amen I don't bother nobody else but in pen Harris you step on my toes praise God I'm watching every corner every nook to hallways everywhere Glory you may be seated the word the word yet young spake for itself God don't want to hear from your pastor he wants to hear from you Rebecca [Music] God Ela said Rebecca not lean not layan not your brother brother Bram said on page 159 Jehovah jyra lean was her pastor and her mother was the church but Ela did not ask the church nor the pastor will you go yes I'll go so I'm tell you about your pastor I want know about God want to hear from your mouth do you believe the seven Thunders well my pastor I don't care about your pastor do you believe the seven Thunders Pastor may be a devil for on I know but if he preaches this word then he's my brother maybe seated [Applause] the word yet young spake for itself brother brother brother Joy Balo here Jonathan and Brian they can speak for themselves you believe in Thunders amen there you are they don't you don't have to they don't have to ask me if they believe it God put something inside and know you're not must be about my father's business now watch that's the secret the secret of the message now 1965 the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business so the secret of the message in 1965 not 74 way back before that the secret of the message was to be about your father's business and not listen to the church or the rabbis what is a father's business could you think of what the father's business was to him to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me see it was the father's business to fulfill that word well if that come down through them stalks of Natural Women Hagar and so forth and Sarah and Mary what about these stalks of these Spiritual Church women churches Luther Westley Pentecost amen means women women means churches is that right then what is it now we must be about the father's business the wheat the wheat not the Shu the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate St Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrew 138 St John 14:12 vindicate all his word you mean to tell me that myself and you we are to vindicate the prophet is that why he took the prophet and left the pride and amen the because Isaiah said when the enemy come in with a flood of unbelief false anointed ones I'll take the prophet but the seed will get in the people and then they will be about their father's business vindicating Malachi 4 in Europe South Africa New Zealand India South America vindicating the [Applause] message Hallelujah a bride and God could turn his back and turn and sit down his rocking chair in 1965 when he took the prophet God sat down his rocking chair because he knew he had some predestinated seeds of God that would not fail that would overcome Hallelujah no matter what the test was they would stand there anyway can a devil move them praise God hallelujah so every time you say the seven Thunders gives Faith you are vindicating Malachi 4 no doubt if Malachi 4 could hear you I can see him raised up Hall alah Glory come on come on come on praise God you may be seated vindicate all of his word I mean Revelation the 10th chapter the opening of The Seven Seals vindicate the opening of the seventh seal vindicate Revelation 81 that the seventh seal open say it back it did [Applause] happen that's what it means I to say I don't know now what quote was that was this before the third pull was this the second pull or the first pull some brothers said well now the second pull was not the voice of God in Doctrine ignorant stupid not even knowing that the second pull was the restoration of the former [Applause] rign brother Brandon Resto storing back Paul's doctrines in the second pull then God come down open Seven Seals to vindicate the second pull that indeed this man knew what he was talking [Applause] about then the lad rain swept over and the lad and the former rain together they don't want no former rain women preachers and stuff like that they don't want that so they say his Doctrine is wrong is not wrong Glory the mysteries of God even to serpent seed and all will be manifested marriage and divorce and all the other Mysteries has been hid under the pillars from all these years from the theologians and hid from their eyes amen but now is the hour that's the father's business think they would receive it they want to be dignified all the n Nation don't teach us that we don't know about no seven Thunders dignified my but the Bible does that's right God vindicates it to be the truth fulfilling this age when the Seven Seals are just proven denomination have been carriers excuse me that's another one of the father's business to prove and the father's business now is to show you them denominations is not his their man-made system that the word so the father's business is to take the seventh Thunder Revelation and show everybody else is not his if they don't believe it oh praise God my my time for you to take out your [Applause] sword sister Louisa Mayo had a dream Friday February the 4th it was it was as if I was with some saints from the church yet I was standing alone it seemed that we were in some sort of a war as the enemy came toward me I looked at him and knew that in me was the power to destroy him exactly what I told you this morning as I looked at him I saw a lightning bolt in front of me then a ball of fire formed in a big ball of fire then there was fighting with a sword the fighting went on until the person with the sword was led to stick it in when it was my turn to take the sword I was afraid because I had never handled a sword before for and the promis is wait till them seven Thunders uttered his voices to that group not Joe Coman to the group that can hand it there that can take the spoken word and say Silver and Gold Have I [Applause] None but such as I have I give unto you oh Hallelujah I was afraid because I never handle a sword before then it seemed as if there was someone teaching me how to use it I wonder if Michael is here I wonder if that's what's going on child training tutoring and to your faith teach you how to hand that [Applause] sword how to use it and showing me every move I had to me St John 5:19 I do nothing except the father show me what a harmony with God thus sayith the Lord to keep still back to the Bible back to the word my oh my oh about five minutes more do you love him tonight Glory here's a quote for you just as Jesus was adopted and Malachi 4 was adopted he'll do the same for you on AG gapo love 2858 South Ben Indiana quote he will do for you the same if you will stand after you receive the Holy Ghost now stand after you receive it after you receive it oh I got it no you ain't got nothing you just got started after you get the Holy Ghost then you are predestinated unto the adoption and make yourself a Christian how do you do that and and and make yourself a Christian and act like a Christian should if you will put your faith in God's word and your eyes toward Heaven set your affection on things above and let your pants legs be banging at the knees get down and get some neology get some calluses on your knees be reverent before God there'll be Som today God will take you over to the side where and give you a power and give you a gift that the whole world will know he is with [Applause] you the world will know it the placing of the son to his position can you understand before the resurrection God will place you you ain't got anything to do with it just my here you can't figure that out but when that Holy Ghost Zoom place you praise God the placing you may be seated of the son to his position you won't have to say a word about it God when he brings his children in a place of all Faith 19 58 the prophet knew what he was talking about and overshadows that and positionally puts them into the place where they are supposed to be now where are you at are you with Pentecost then go back there are you in the resurrection you didn't make it yet what place are you in now adoption time either you in Pentecost or you in the resurrection and Paul said not that I have aain but I press forward toward the mark of the High Calling of [Applause] God may be seated when he brings his children in a place of all faith when did it happen when he revealed the seals and restored the faith back he put you in a place of all faith Faith then when charity sweeps over all Faith you be placed oh Hallelujah has this day finally arrived Brethren has Malachi for restored all faith and God is now ready in 1983 to overshadow you with Charity 1974 you didn't make it yet you was in brotherly kindness 75 67 8 9 81 and 2 you didn't make a chance you were still in holy decency but 1983 what do you think I'm doing I'm declaring we are [Applause] here I'm saying it this is adoption time I visualize it I express it this is place in Christ now I'm waiting for charity to sweep down it's here tonight is here now we are here Glory charity is here to finally take you out of what was Pentecost and place you into adoption that's your place I believe the hours here now now therefore give me this mountain may be seated praise God let's possess our inheritance only to the Overcomers Ephesians and Joshua number one Ephesians like Joshua divides the land to the Overcomers Apostles prophets pastors Vel and teachers two is dividing up and setting in order to overcome one it is the one that have after he got the Holy Ghost after then he receives the person from The Prophet Jesus that's the message I say I got it Faith you way down in there son you way back in the

Divine inheritance to the Overcomers you see it now to and ch training you're coming on coming on coming on and then suddenly the land is divided now I'm talking about spiritual adoption not physical adoption physical adoption is over in Romans 8 I'm talking about spiritual adoption I'm talking about the Holy Ghost Veil that drops down over your imagination memory faction conscious reason powers and you see no man but Jesus and Jesus Christ God man walks the streets of Sodom that's what I'm preaching Glory spiritual adoption number one is setting in order of the matured son number two who has overcome through obedience to the father's word number three into a position of authority to write the check [Applause] tutoring seasoning child training you pray for the sick I've been praying for the sick you've been praying for the sick for years well you pray for the sick during the tutoring time but adoption plac in Christ you command the Devils to come out you don't even pray no more you

[Applause] that God Hallelujah that's right when the church begins to get into his mighty power when they have a few and a ni of fire and a few of them yes sir you'll see that Holy Church stands together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God after you're born then you have to be adopted into the same family [Music] yeah and the Lord cuz he's that's scripture St Matthew 3:16 And1 17 the duve identifies you as the son for that generation this is my beloved Son who I'm well pleased and position you as a son but then you have to go through some time

so anoint the people till they will speak the word and it will create itself like that you mean we will speak the word we will create Glory like that you we haven't seen power that's coming to the church now I know it for a fact say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say shall come to pass you can have what you said here it is the placing of the church in a position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church before the resurrection let me drive that into your souls there will be a power that will be placed in this [Applause] church when that time comes the Philistines will back up the critics mouths will be shut it'll be a short time he come right off the mountain and went straight to Calvary notice it won't
