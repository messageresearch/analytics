[18:19] to go over to the Catholic church and
[18:20] take a peep and I seen the stones over
[18:22] there and he says I want stones on the
[18:24] sidewalk out there so I kept watching
[18:27] and waiting and you know then the money

[18:55] and I thought okay and then we found out
[18:56] it was only $100 more to put the stones
[18:58] and then put cement there so therefore
[19:01] the stones are there I kept watching
[19:03] wind and funny thing the man with the
[19:06] tree here he hasn't been paid yet and he
[19:09] was supposed to pull the roots up
[19:11] yesterday he's doing it in three stages
[19:13] first trim the branches off and let it
[19:16] set for a while and then the next Second
[19:18] Stage uh tear the old thing
[19:20] down you know after you tear it down
[19:22] there still some Roots they go
[19:26] deep they supposed to come out yesterday
[19:28] but no he says Tuesday now I understand
[19:31] why I got to pull him out first
[19:35] today God Amen so we're going to get
[19:38] them
[19:39] [Music]
[19:41] Roots amen now don't worry if your roots

[19:49] safe amen praise God so if your roots go
[19:52] back to ellim you all right but any
[19:54] other funny looking roots that coming
[19:57] out

[20:02] now don't try to figure out uh what is
[20:04] brother Bobby standing over there for
[20:05] and why is he sitting there just listen
[20:07] to the
[20:11] message brother I thought uh one time

[20:19] everybody looked over there the married
[20:20] ones looked too amen poor brother loo he

[21:20] there it is the stones are being
[21:22] cemented together as a sign cuz the Holy
[21:25] Spirit told me what it meant but I kept
[21:27] watching it so I came Thursday I believe

[1:03:27] he has set his church in order Glory
[1:03:31] acts 4 notice when the lame man was
[1:03:34] healed on the day of Pentecost when
[1:03:36] Peter preached the Seven Seals 3,000 got
[1:03:39] sold the devil didn't move but Acts 3
[1:03:42] one day there was a lame man Heck on
[1:03:44] Peter and John going up about the time
[1:03:46] of prayer and the lame man looked on
[1:03:49] them expecting to receive
[1:03:53] something and Peter and John is walking
[1:03:55] in into prayer Holy Angel turn
[1:03:59] them and the lame man took heed give me
[1:04:03] give me amen they hand it Peter said
[1:04:07] silver go have a none but such as I have
[1:04:11] rise up in the name of Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ notice right after that happened
[1:04:18] then the Devils moved in the demons come
[1:04:21] in when the lame man was healed but at
[1:04:24] that time Peter quoted back from Psalm
[1:04:28] 118 praise God the The Headstone is the
[1:04:31] head of the corner there's none other
[1:04:35] Stone given whereby you shall be saved
[1:04:39] do he said no other name but he called
[1:04:41] it the
[1:04:43] stone there's no other
[1:04:45] Stone other than a
[1:04:49] headstone then the Apostolic Church
[1:04:52] Peter when the signs begin to follow
[1:04:56] he quickly said the it's the head of the
[1:04:58] corner he identified so I'm identifying
[1:05:02] it this
[1:05:06] morning and then
[1:05:08] Paul the architect of the seven Church
[1:05:10] ages took the headstone from their early
[1:05:12] bride said this is a Cornerstone for the
[1:05:15] seven Church ages the baptism of the
[1:05:17] Holy Ghost it was an odd Stone A
[1:05:20] peculiar Stone and the billers didn't
[1:05:22] want it then and they don't want it
[1:05:24] today the stone is the baptism of the
[1:05:26] Holy Ghost it makes you shout it makes
[1:05:29] you scream it makes you cry it makes You
[1:05:33] Weep so the bilders today in the message
[1:05:36] don't want that
[1:05:39] stone so the bilders rejected the
[1:05:42] Thunders of
[1:05:44] stone for N9 years the builders rejected
[1:05:48] the stone in the message but I say
[1:05:51] today the same stone that the builders
[1:05:54] rejected
[1:05:56] that same baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:59] here in New York
