[5:24] which is open in the hand of the angel
[5:27] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[5:30] earth

[5:52] with all the sin
[5:54] great grace
[5:56] is that can we say amen
[5:59] shout it out
[6:03] it's just a man told you to come to this
[6:06] man who who you think is here this
[6:07] morning
[6:11] it'll be so humble and simple
[6:14] behold i come as a thief
[6:16] [Applause]
[6:18] then came jesus
[6:24] 17 years but he's here
[6:30] see it picking up another octave is
[6:33] beginning to go off
[6:36] he's really here
[6:38] and i went to the angel let that be your
[6:40] testimony today
[6:42] and say to him give me the the little
[6:44] book he said let me take it eat it up
[6:47] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[6:50] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[6:52] oh how i can testify about that
[6:56] brother it was in my belly for 17 years
[6:59] bitter
[7:00] when i had to stand up and say to seven
[7:03] thunders seven thunders for 17 years
[7:07] in america and in canada and europe and
[7:09] south africa in the west indies i was
[7:12] slain and cursed and persecuted for
[7:15] saying give me the book
[7:18] for eating the book
[7:19] it was sweet when that revelation come
[7:22] about the thunders and so forth but when
[7:24] i had to stand up and tell the brethren
[7:26] because they didn't hear it first and i
[7:28] had to say it amen then i was cursed
[7:31] so i've been through my bitterness time
[7:35] time for you to go through it
[7:38] time for you to stand out against
[7:40] whoever this friend or whoever it is
[7:44] amen
[7:45] take a stand for jesus see i'm giving my
[7:48] testimony i've lived it amen
[7:50] i know what people see the people was
[7:52] not supposed to know
[7:53] so that's why he had to give me
[7:55] brotherly kindness to forgive them
[7:56] before they even open their mouths up
[7:59] i forgave me for the foundation of the
[8:01] world
[8:03] praise god amen
[8:05] i did i was in christ forgiving them
[8:08] as he forgave me i forgave them
[8:12] oh come on brother
[8:14] oh well what's now
[8:16] we in the word now
[8:18] you better have been reading and
[8:20] studying this message
[8:22] amen
[8:24] and i took a little book out of the
[8:26] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[8:28] my mouth sweet as honey
[8:31] and it was and as soon as i eaten it up
[8:33] my belly was bitter now this is
[8:34] identified on blasphemous names for the
[8:36] age
[8:37] brother bram said just as every uh uh is
[8:40] it just as every age met their
[8:42] requirement paul and arenas and martin
[8:44] columba lutheran wesley malik in there
[8:46] so will that seventh age
[8:49] meet their requirement
[8:51] a world falling apart
[8:53] do you know what that means
[8:55] that means that we in this message and
[8:57] our requirement is brotherly kindness
[8:59] forgiveness
[9:01] and the prophet prophesied that we would
[9:03] meet that requirement
[9:05] [Applause]
[9:06] he would let all kind of tests come and
[9:09] demons come against you family come
[9:10] against you for nothing
[9:13] just so that you can meet that
[9:14] requirement
[9:16] i forgive your brother i love you i
[9:18] forgive you
[9:20] that's the message
[9:23] [Music]
[9:25] and he said unto me thou
[9:27] must prophesy again and before many
[9:30] peoples and nations and tongues and
[9:31] kings may god bless and read of his word
[9:35] well praise god you may be seated
[9:38] amen
[9:40] well everybody's feeling fine
[9:44] lord
[9:46] strange thing i had this message here
[9:48] actually preached it several years ago
[9:50] but
[9:51] to kind of bring it up to date i felt
[9:53] that the knowledge is to know christ
[9:56] and brother keith campbell from tulsa
[9:58] sent me a letter beautiful letter the
[9:59] other day and while i have i see i
[10:01] stayed home last sunday because i knew
[10:03] the wedding would be this
[10:05] weekend and there would be no way i
[10:06] could study
[10:08] so i stayed home last sunday and studied
[10:10] and made up this message
[10:13] and i had a letter a little sign to me
[10:16] brother keith and he said ps i always
[10:18] liked the story of the past that brother
[10:20] muscaro always has been saying for a
[10:22] long time about the president he said
[10:24] many people know about jesus but they
[10:26] don't know him
[10:28] there is a difference a big difference
[10:30] if i were to tell you i know about the
[10:34] president of the united states you would
[10:36] say big deal everybody does
[10:39] but if i told you i personally know and
[10:42] have met and have shook the hand of the
[10:46] president of the united states
[10:47] then that would really be something
[10:50] different
[10:51] you would say wow
[10:53] you personally know the president of the
[10:55] united states
[10:56] so to really know
[10:58] christ is something very different than
[11:02] to know about him
[11:05] [Applause]
[11:08] and that's what i've been leaving for
[11:09] for 17 years to get you to know him
[11:12] not just about him
[11:18] amen
[11:23] so to really know christ is something
[11:25] very different from the know about him
[11:27] many
[11:28] many multitudes know about him and spend
[11:31] their whole lives studying him
[11:34] and many in the message study the
[11:36] message
[11:37] about him
[11:39] being revealed in
[11:41] malachi 4.
[11:43] but they still don't know him
[11:48] they're in the message
[11:49] where him came
[11:51] and revealed himself and they still
[11:53] don't know him
[11:54] because they study intellectually about
[11:56] him
[11:58] so our purpose this morning for you to
[11:59] go to him
[12:02] [Applause]
[12:03] and finally walk out these doors knowing
[12:06] him
[12:07] and not just about him
[12:11] amen may be seated
[12:13] many many many multitudes know about him
[12:15] and spend their whole lives studying him
[12:17] but only
[12:19] very few actually
[12:20] know him
[12:22] to know him is life
[12:29] there's a difference
[12:31] that's different between the holy ghost
[12:32] and others who know about him
[12:35] the person received the holy ghost they
[12:36] know him
[12:38] from the beginning amen brother
[12:41] come on now praise god
[12:43] yes siree
[12:45] so i got a beautiful letter from sister
[12:47] henrietta of plavoi and she used to be
[12:49] married to brother marcel and then she
[12:52] was telling me uh uh how um
[12:55] uh the this message of some have
[12:57] compassion
[12:58] back then february 17th really she saw
[13:01] the revelation there forgiveness and so
[13:04] forth and then your testimony was that
[13:06] then brother oblato preached easter
[13:08] morning he really said some things that
[13:10] really shook her up and she felt like
[13:12] she couldn't forgive thing forgive
[13:14] people that had done so many things to
[13:16] her i guess is back in haiti somewhere i
[13:17] don't know but anyway she couldn't and
[13:19] she prayed throughout easter day and way
[13:22] up until uh monday morning at one
[13:23] o'clock in the morning still praying to
[13:25] get to want to forgive and forget
[13:29] you see
[13:30] and then finally somewhere during the
[13:32] week it left her then she walked in here
[13:34] sunday morning april 7 and there was the
[13:37] message then came jesus
[13:39] and jesus met her and she says baptizer
[13:43] with the holy ghost and
[13:46] fire because she forgave
[13:50] and you cannot receive the holy ghost
[13:52] unless you forgive
[13:54] and forget
[13:58] so i'm not looking for 15 to be baptized
[14:00] it's just one
[14:04] amen
[14:05] so that's the way it's going to be
[14:08] when you can forgive and give up
[14:10] and forget about it
[14:12] and don't think it what was done to you
[14:14] was worse than what was done to that one
[14:17] that's the spirit that won't die
[14:19] you maybe see this you don't understand
[14:21] lord but see the way it happened to me
[14:24] on this day and going over there on this
[14:26] street that was worse than what they did
[14:30] see me now because the way it happened
[14:31] me
[14:32] who are you
[14:35] i mean the lord said what's all this
[14:37] nonsense you're telling eternity tell me
[14:39] the word says
[14:40] when you stand praying
[14:42] if you have ought to drop it
[14:44] i can't go over my word
[14:47] i don't care if you've been here for 25
[14:49] years but i cannot go with my work
[14:50] sister
[14:52] no you have to go back and give the
[14:53] worst one the one who did the worst
[14:55] things to you until you forgive her i
[14:57] will not forgive you
[15:01] so be delivered today
[15:05] because you're going to know him from
[15:06] the beginning
[15:09] it wasn't so from the beginning
[15:11] hallelujah
[15:12] so you understand now
[15:15] praise god
[15:16] so to know him not about him and in this
[15:20] message they've been knowing about him
[15:22] in books and quotes and tapes that's
[15:24] about him but we preach him crucified
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:31] amen
[15:33] okay you may be seated my subject is
[15:37] that voice spake
[15:39] the voice spoke and the shout went out
[15:43] let that voice speak again and the voice
[15:45] of the archangel will go out
[15:49] [Applause]
[15:51] catch what i'm saying

[21:29] know how much to tell you because if you
[21:31] was here easter or seen

[21:36] know that something happened here
[21:38] in the holy spirit after 17 years of
[21:40] preaching that is finished
[21:42] and then he says now you go to thomas uh

[21:58] the wednesday was on the tape then last
[21:59] one is on the tape and now today is the
[22:01] fourth time
[22:03] and as you know wouldn't be wonderful
[22:04] and we'd be sitting down in georgia and
[22:06] everybody would do a
[22:08] real revelation of brotherly kindness
[22:10] and all those who had gone to different
[22:12] groups and split up was all gathered in
[22:14] there together and before the meeting
[22:16] even started they started uh going to
[22:18] one another's rooms
[22:19] having prayer and making things right
[22:22] brother brown said that on the tape he
[22:23] said going from room to room
[22:25] making things right getting orcs out
[22:28] wouldn't the holy spirit come down in
[22:29] the meat like that
[22:33] oh
[22:35] my
[22:37] my don't hold any bitterness in your
[22:39] heart amen you could take that on with
[22:41] you to tribulation and period in hell
[22:43] somewhere amen
[22:45] forgive it what's that mean i'm let you
[22:47] let that block you from going to heaven
[22:49] no no way amen
[22:52] so uh so now we
[22:54] want to speak um brother oblater myself
[22:57] but the strength of the lord the next
[22:59] eight sundays including today
[23:01] to see if something
[23:03] we can hear the rustling of the top of
[23:05] the mulberry tree or something
[23:07] and some of you people can get sealed up
[23:09] amen
[23:10] like our sister henrietta was still on
[23:12] april 7. it's a little season from today
[23:15] come see this man and sister madeline is
[23:18] singing about it and
[23:20] be washed in the blood oh praise god so
[23:23] from april 28th to june 16 just before
[23:26] the making georgia meeting to get some
[23:28] of you seal up for service
[23:30] and now you don't have to pray for me
[23:32] because i want to have two prayer lines
[23:35] may 12th and may 26th it'll be a and o
[23:39] and then of course the other time is
[23:40] whichever
[23:42] sunday that they will fall into
[23:44] and we'll get it straight that's what i
[23:45] want to do
[23:46] god give me the strength
[23:49] so you'll be praying i feel maybe you
[23:50] have a little bit more faith now some of
[23:52] you seen your names in in the book of
[23:53] redemption
[23:55] and so maybe you have faith to get
[23:56] healed now
[23:59] you see a name there well he died for
[24:01] your healing and
[24:03] dying for your the holy ghost
[24:06] then this you come through here i'm
[24:08] anointed we are anointed and you
[24:09] anointed
[24:11] firefalls
[24:14] that's why i haven't attempted to do it
[24:15] again
[24:16] there was enough power here to heal
[24:18] everybody in 1986 but a virtually
[24:20] powerful service but there was no faith
[24:22] on the line
[24:23] so hope for some faith on that line so
[24:25] before we get to may 12 we want to go to
[24:28] that angel
[24:29] anything can happen
[24:31] amen would you like to see another
[24:33] september october november 1983
[24:37] you remember september 11th the holy
[24:39] spirit just poured out for about five
[24:40] hours
[24:42] we like to see that today or any day
[24:44] break out
[24:45] we can have it you know
[24:47] oh we're building to it
[24:50] oh hallelujah prince got another time
[24:52] around
[24:53] gloria
[24:54] be encouraged
[24:57] but first we got to know him amen
[25:01] okay now you may be seated now god gives
[25:03] us three things he reveals faith and
[25:06] then he pours out the virtue and
[25:07] knowledge
[25:08] and just these little three messages
[25:10] here he's as far as you go he says and
[25:12] then
[25:13] then then uh you just preach these three
[25:16] here and then you move on and then they
[25:18] themselves got to catch it get a
[25:20] revelation then everybody gets sealed
[25:22] amen then they die as a death of a corn
[25:25] and wheat and then they'll begin to show
[25:27] their temperance and patience and
[25:28] goddess and bully kindness
[25:31] see
[25:32] so now to know him from the beginning is
[25:34] the last message to bring up the new
[25:36] people to the present time
[25:38] saint john 17 3 and this is life eternal
[25:42] that they might know thee the only true
[25:44] god and jesus christ whom thou has sent
[25:48] saint john
[25:50] 4 through 5 glory of god the glory of
[25:53] god is for the bride which glory he had
[25:56] before the world began
[25:58] and i just read that and in your cod
[26:00] book page 15
[26:02] paragraph 29 30. but look now are we
[26:06] looking the whole church now we're
[26:07] standing on a great big banister
[26:10] watching what god's doing and we'll get
[26:12] right down to this question here and you
[26:14] see how he brings it in
[26:16] now no one has seen god now the next
[26:19] thing we begin to see by the eyes of
[26:20] supernatural looking
[26:22] see that supernatural when you sit there
[26:24] in the natural just looking at me
[26:26] i don't see no supernatural
[26:28] and that's why i get exasperated i said
[26:30] well what they're staring at me
[26:32] it's like get in the spirit i mean
[26:35] you don't get spooky i mean but
[26:37] close your eyes and do something amen
[26:40] but just stare at me amen
[26:42] amen see
[26:44] well amen we see a little uh okay the
[26:46] eyes are supernatural looking now don't
[26:49] see something that's not there
[26:51] and say i saw this i saw that you know
[26:54] no not that either see we see a little
[26:56] white light forming out there what is
[26:58] that that was called by bible readers
[27:01] logos
[27:02] the anointed
[27:03] or the anointing
[27:05] as i was going to say the part of god
[27:07] began to develop
[27:10] god was just there and he can't be god
[27:13] until he has an object to
[27:15] to worship him
[27:17] god is the object of worship just great
[27:20] spirit
[27:22] there covered all things knew knew all
[27:24] things there but when did he start he
[27:26] was there
[27:28] in the beginning
[27:29] don't blow your mind not trying to
[27:31] figure when
[27:33] the the theologians the doctorates the
[27:36] masters can only go to saint john 1. is
[27:39] that correct brother in the beginning
[27:42] that's as far as you can go and when you
[27:44] go to your doctorate you ain't going any
[27:45] further
[27:48] he knows this he's not the doctors or
[27:50] whatever it is bhd's
[27:51] he cannot go any further than in the
[27:53] beginning god
[27:56] they can't go no further now i'm telling
[27:58] you something brother the only way you
[27:59] can go further than saint john 1 is to
[28:02] hear a message from a prophet who was
[28:05] able to go way back
[28:10] hallelujah
[28:12] to hear a message of a prophet that was
[28:14] back before the beginning
[28:16] glory
[28:18] that's the only way the only way
[28:21] hallelujah
[28:24] you may be seated
[28:26] and uh we happened
[28:28] i was a little different it's not a
[28:29] classroom but this is a big is this open
[28:31] but we're actually going for our doctors
[28:33] also on the third phase amen
[28:38] praise god
[28:40] that's right uh dr bolomo and dr thiory
[28:43] over here praise god

[28:49] yes sorry
[28:51] get that down amen praise god
[28:53] yes siree and i and part of god began to
[28:56] develop into so human beings could have
[29:00] some type of an idea of what it was
[29:02] amen was it a little low a little light
[29:05] moving that was the word of god now god
[29:09] gave himself birth to this son which was
[29:11] before there was even an atom
[29:14] or air to make an atom that was see
[29:18] jesus said glorify me father i read the
[29:20] scripture
[29:22] with the glory that we had before the
[29:24] foundation of the world
[29:26] see way back yonder
[29:29] mind saint john 1 he said in the
[29:31] beginning was the word
[29:32] and the word was god and the word was
[29:35] made flesh and dwelt among us god
[29:37] unfolding himself into a human being
[29:41] that we might talk to him and speak to
[29:43] him and handle him and oh praise shake
[29:45] his hand and sit down and break bread
[29:48] with him praise god
[29:50] and we will drink the communion with him
[29:52] in the end after the battle's over after
[29:55] the panel's over praise god
[29:58] hallelujah
[30:00] after battling the demons that won't let
[30:02] you forgive
[30:03] uh defeat those demons and see if you
[30:06] don't be purged out and feel the light
[30:09] is a feather no more weight on your
[30:11] shoulders no more
[30:13] hallelujah praise god
[30:15] free like an eagle
[30:18] amen
[30:20] you may be seated how many understand
[30:22] about the the white light and then the
[30:24] seven rainbows coming out of the white
[30:26] light would you like to hear an article
[30:28] about that huh
[30:30] okay uh december 11 1990 in the news day
[30:33] long island paper discoveries for young
[30:35] people how come
[30:37] this is captioned the colors of the
[30:39] rainbow and the sun
[30:41] amen i thought i'd read it to you what
[30:43] does the sun
[30:45] why does the sun change color
[30:48] sometimes it's red or orange and other
[30:50] times it's yellow writes jeremy tan a
[30:53] second grader in merrick
[30:55] imagine you are orbiting the earth in
[30:57] the space shuttle you look out at the
[30:59] sun glowing against the inky black of
[31:02] space and it appears white
[31:04] or imagine standing on the surface of
[31:06] the moon
[31:08] and gazing up at the sun from there it
[31:10] would also look white
[31:12] but here on earth look at the sun
[31:14] through the blanket of air surrounding
[31:16] our planet the sun normally looks yellow
[31:20] at sunrise and sunset it may look red or
[31:23] orange or pink
[31:25] how come
[31:27] our star is not really changing colors
[31:30] out by our
[31:32] way out there in space
[31:34] it glows in white light all the time
[31:39] it glows as elohim
[31:42] that white light that went down between
[31:44] abraham's sacrifices
[31:47] hallelujah that's the white light
[31:51] that's him from the beginning
[31:54] to know him that white light
[31:57] from the beginning praise god
[32:00] amen
[32:01] now you learn a little something now
[32:04] elohim
[32:05] white light
[32:07] amen
[32:09] it glows in white all the time the clue
[32:12] is that the sun's color
[32:14] appears to change only when you look at
[32:18] it through the earth's atmosphere
[32:21] remember there is no air in space or
[32:24] around the moon
[32:26] looking at the sun through air is like
[32:29] looking
[32:30] through a veil
[32:32] sunlight which has to pass through the
[32:35] air before it reaches our eyes is
[32:37] changed by its trip
[32:41] so as god the white light began to
[32:43] unfold
[32:45] and coming on down to the earth it began
[32:48] to begin to change color red and
[32:51] yellow and orange and
[32:54] green and blue and indigo and brotherly
[32:59] kindness
[33:01] seven spirits coming down from glory
[33:05] but way back it was white light
[33:09] oh hallelujah first seven spirits
[33:12] seven eyes seven lamps seven voices
[33:16] seven
[33:17] seven lambs my god seven messages seven
[33:20] stars seven thunder seven virtues
[33:24] oh that white light coming down my
[33:28] god
[33:29] to know him from the beginning
[33:32] and one of his attributes is brotherly
[33:35] kindness
[33:37] he come down to forgive us man
[33:40] amen his son died to death praise god on
[33:44] the cross that we might be saved
[33:46] hallelujah and god forgave us our sins
[33:51] hallelujah we catch this revelation then
[33:54] we in turn forgive our brother and our
[33:56] sister no matter how many sins they have
[33:59] committed we forgive them how many times
[34:02] 70 times seven
[34:04] so that out our promise won't be spotted
[34:07] with the flesh
[34:09] for wanting the flesh to be vindicated
[34:12] you did this to me as a pharisee praise
[34:15] god
[34:16] but we are god's children
[34:20] amen
[34:22] you may be seated
[34:24] hallelujah
[34:25] amen oh praise god
[34:29] yes sir
[34:32] where's that now look at the sun through
[34:34] the ears like looking through the the
[34:35] veil that's right
[34:38] before it reaches our eyes it's changed
[34:40] by its trips
[34:42] yes serene by time they got down to us
[34:44] it was in the color brotherly kindness
[34:49] amen
[34:52] amen
[34:55] praise god the light produced inside the
[34:58] sun is white light but white light
[35:01] contains with in it many colors all the
[35:04] colors of the rainbow
[35:06] if you look at a at white light through
[35:08] a prism you will see the rainbow
[35:12] three corner prism you see a rainbow
[35:15] amen the prism splits the white light
[35:19] into colors
[35:20] like a cone
[35:22] separating here into his individual
[35:24] strands as a woman combs in here or man
[35:27] and goes into individual strands and so
[35:30] as they combed through the white light
[35:31] it went into seven strands
[35:35] praise god
[35:38] and samson had those seven strands
[35:41] hallelujah all seven little strands on
[35:44] the back
[35:45] it's oh lord once more
[35:48] i can reach back and feel them seven
[35:50] strands
[35:51] hallelujah that white light
[35:53] my god praise god come alive new york
[35:57] praise god
[36:00] yes sir
[36:02] [Applause]
[36:05] maybe see the the prism splits the white
[36:08] light into colors like a comb separating
[36:10] hair into individual strands white light
[36:13] enters the prism bands of red orange
[36:16] yellow green blue indigo and violet
[36:20] light stream out the other side
[36:23] something
[36:24] similar happens when sunlight passes
[36:27] through the raindrops making a rainbow
[36:29] in the sky
[36:31] white light is invisible
[36:34] invisibly
[36:36] full of color
[36:37] as it zips through the space at 186 000
[36:41] miles per second
[36:43] and when it enters the earth's
[36:45] atmosphere some of the light slices
[36:48] cleanly through
[36:49] reaching the ground untouched staying
[36:51] white
[36:52] sometimes amen
[36:55] but since the earth's air is made of
[36:58] molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen
[37:01] some of the light will run into these
[37:03] molecules on its way down and when it
[37:05] does light is scattered
[37:08] yes sir
[37:10] it is mostly bluish light that is
[37:12] scattered out of the white
[37:14] light beam
[37:15] so by the time sunlight reaches our eyes
[37:19] most of the blue end of the spectrum the
[37:21] blues and purples that scatter out into
[37:23] the sky this is uh what makes the blue
[37:26] sky by the way
[37:29] because it's black out there man
[37:32] you see blue sky
[37:34] amen
[37:36] praise god
[37:38] me and see we are getting our doctrine
[37:40] here this morning amen
[37:42] amen brother
[37:44] praise god meanwhile the sun beam
[37:47] having lost his blues isn't that nice
[37:50] the sunbeam lost his blues
[37:53] did you did you lose your blues uh
[37:55] set the hell on his guns he lost her
[37:57] blues amen praise god
[37:59] yes sir
[38:00] see lost the blues you have a little
[38:02] sense of humor you know
[38:06] he should have caught him right away i
[38:07] lost the blues oh praise god you know
[38:10] amen praise god having lost his blues is
[38:14] now much yellower since the colors that
[38:16] are left in the beam are the warm colors
[38:19] so instead of white the sun looks
[38:22] yellow to us as sunrise the sunset an
[38:25] even more dramatic change occurs
[38:27] sunlight must travel through an even
[38:30] thicker layer of air
[38:32] that it does
[38:34] than it does through the rest of the day
[38:36] why when the sun is overhead the light
[38:39] passes through just the air above us
[38:41] air that becomes thinner and thinner
[38:44] higher up but when the sun is near the
[38:46] horizon
[38:47] its light must pass through many thick
[38:50] layers of air those nearest to the
[38:52] ground the light runs into even more air
[38:56] molecules than usual
[38:58] so even more of the blue and of the
[39:01] spectrum is scattered out of the light
[39:03] beam this leaves only
[39:06] orange and red sunlight in the beam
[39:10] and so we see the sun is a fiery orange
[39:14] ball
[39:15] getting redder and redder as it sinks
[39:18] but it sinks lower into the sky going
[39:21] down in the west
[39:24] so praise god you understand
[39:27] so when you hear me speak my white light
[39:29] and then seven rainbows you know what it
[39:31] is it's god
[39:33] then seven manifestations of the one
[39:37] holy spirit white light
[39:43] see what i'm saying not seven different
[39:44] one seven manifestations not seven
[39:47] spirits separate the seven
[39:49] manifestations of the white light
[39:51] diffused
[39:53] on the earth
[39:55] praise god
[39:58] oh glorify me father with the glory that
[40:02] we had before the foundation of the
[40:03] world
[40:05] so this bride
[40:07] wants to be covered by this glory from
[40:09] the foundation of the world amen
[40:11] that's what she's striving for saint
[40:13] john 3 amen and this is life eternal
[40:16] that they might know thee
[40:18] it means to know to perceive to
[40:21] recognize to become acquainted with and
[40:24] understand
[40:25] you the only time and real god
[40:29] yes sir and likewise to know him jesus
[40:33] as the christ anointed one
[40:36] the messiah the kinsmen redeemer whom
[40:39] you have sent in in these last days in
[40:42] through malachi 4 saint luke 17 30
[40:44] revelation 10 to open the book of
[40:47] redemption rights and all the mysteries
[40:50] about
[40:51] who god is and what god is and his
[40:53] nature his being and how he's one god
[40:56] and not three gods and all these
[40:58] mysteries plus the seven thunders and
[41:00] they have been revealed for one main
[41:02] purpose that we might know god
[41:06] i'm gonna bring 17 years down to the day
[41:08] that you might know him from the
[41:10] beginning
[41:11] so he got nothing to do with brother
[41:12] coleman's that you might know him from
[41:14] the beginning
[41:15] praise god i don't get no glory out of
[41:17] the praise god god gets all the glory
[41:20] we'll give all the glory to jesus
[41:24] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[41:28] and to know god is life eternal saint
[41:30] john 20 here 30 31 all of the signs and
[41:33] ones and miracles that were done through
[41:35] malachi 4 3 polls and the same life
[41:37] signs and spirit that will be revealed

[1:10:59] themselves
[1:11:01] because they are strong
[1:11:03] amen and they overcome the wicked one
[1:11:05] praise god
[1:11:07] and the word of god abideth in them and
[1:11:09] he turns on mrs fenton
[1:11:11] and then he said mrs fenton and all
[1:11:14] these people caged up there
[1:11:16] and she said brother branham he's to
[1:11:18] carry her groceries she says these are
[1:11:20] fine people you don't know them you
[1:11:22] don't understand them they don't
[1:11:23] understand you she said help those
[1:11:25] people

[1:11:28] something over his eye
[1:11:30] and said brother boy roy get out of that
[1:11:32] there
[1:11:32] and he said that this is not enough in

[1:11:44] the young men got out
[1:11:46] and but brother boys he couldn't get out
[1:11:48] of it or something over his eye and some
[1:11:50] brother brahm said
[1:11:51] and mrs fenton another denominational
[1:11:54] group see and they're all in the cage
[1:11:55] then and so forth he said free those
[1:11:57] people in the voice they free those
[1:11:59] people he said i can't i'm too small
[1:12:01] this bar is there and he's seen the
[1:12:03] rainbow appeared amen
[1:12:05] elohim appeared there the rainbow out
[1:12:07] there and the voice says uh speak and
[1:12:10] free those people
[1:12:11] and brother rams stood back and
[1:12:13] straighten up praise god and said house
[1:12:15] of hell
[1:12:17] give way to the name of the lord jesus
[1:12:19] christ

[1:12:38] yes sir
[1:12:40] now we got three groups here
[1:12:42] of spiritual growth three groups also
[1:12:44] have spiritual development in the church
[1:12:46] amen the little children
[1:12:48] and young man and fathers then we're
[1:12:51] going to finally have four groups
[1:12:52] because there's two types of young
[1:12:54] children
[1:12:55] amen now these three stages reveal the
[1:12:57] progression in spiritual maturity
[1:13:00] at last we have arrived to this station
[1:13:03] now the father's of course is uh is a
[1:13:05] sign of adoption time
[1:13:08] because they know him from the beginning
[1:13:09] they've been
[1:13:10] they've been to him took the book and
[1:13:12] everything
[1:13:13] hallelujah
[1:13:15] why well 17 years ago they went to the
[1:13:18] angel in 1974 and asked the angel for
[1:13:20] the open book
[1:13:22] that's why
[1:13:26] the book of redemption in the angel's
[1:13:28] hand
[1:13:29] placed us in elohim to bring forth the
[1:13:32] adoption sign
[1:13:34] and the fathers are going to bring out
[1:13:36] the adoption sign who know him from the
[1:13:37] beginning
[1:13:39] somebody must come forth today as a sign
[1:13:42] to you as a father
[1:13:44] somebody got to step out here in this
[1:13:45] message
[1:13:46] as a father who knows him from the
[1:13:49] beginning now we can begin to understand
[1:13:51] saint john 17 1-3 to know him is eternal
[1:13:56] life
[1:13:58] and saint first john 2 12 john says he's
[1:14:01] writing to the little children because
[1:14:03] they know two things
[1:14:04] first john 2 12 because your sins are
[1:14:07] forgiven you for his name sake
[1:14:10] in first john 2 13 you have known the
[1:14:12] heavenly father this is wonderful
[1:14:15] knowledge but it is not enough knowledge
[1:14:18] with which to go out and do exploits for
[1:14:21] god
[1:14:22] just knowing the father and your sins
[1:14:23] are forgiven
[1:14:25] little babies see me now and uh and
[1:14:29] number two here uh there is knowledge of
[1:14:32] the son but no capacity for service
[1:14:35] but by revelation we find that there is
[1:14:37] four stages here st john first john 2 12
[1:14:40] little children this is a greek word
[1:14:43] t-e-k-n-i-a
[1:14:45] this brother might know over here
[1:14:47] studying the greek it means infants
[1:14:49] newborn
[1:14:50] like you know like uh you can't teach
[1:14:53] pentecostal babies a supernatural things
[1:14:58] you know what i mean
[1:14:59] okay
[1:15:01] your sins are forgiven
[1:15:03] and you are and are forgiving you for
[1:15:05] his name sake they're happy with that
[1:15:08] you could preach around there would
[1:15:11] get mad you know so i'd leave him alone
[1:15:13] amen first john 2 13 greek
[1:15:17] p-a-p-a-i-d-i-a
[1:15:19] peter pedia something it means little
[1:15:21] children it means those able to walk and
[1:15:24] talk
[1:15:25] now that's a big difference from little
[1:15:27] infants and babies though those who can
[1:15:29] stand up and talk and walk and see
[1:15:31] what's going on and shout a little bit
[1:15:33] you know and say praise the lord
[1:15:35] ah
[1:15:36] amen praise god
[1:15:39] from 1965 1991 little children and the
[1:15:43] feeding on seven seals of revelation and
[1:15:45] who god is his name is being all about
[1:15:47] him knows about malachi 4 little
[1:15:50] children ripening as seeds in the hot
[1:15:52] sun learning the abcs so that the funds
[1:15:55] on the back side can be revealed to them
[1:15:58] all these little children waiting around
[1:15:59] here now for moving of the spirit
[1:16:02] they've finally seen that the book the
[1:16:04] name was in that book
[1:16:05] and they're getting ready to come to the
[1:16:06] end they finally believe that god is
[1:16:09] right here
[1:16:11] hallelujah
[1:16:12] praise god nothing can stop him
[1:16:14] no mind battles can stop him now
[1:16:18] yes sir so first john 2 30 little
[1:16:21] children because you have known the
[1:16:23] father
[1:16:24] and first john 2 13 they're able to walk
[1:16:26] and talk and emphasis here is on support
[1:16:29] but to be subordinate amen rather than
[1:16:31] on a relationship as in teknia in the
[1:16:35] first one
[1:16:36] so now praise god do you see it it's
[1:16:38] about time to go to that angel in
[1:16:39] revelation 10
[1:16:41] and eat the whole role
[1:16:43] to make you strong to overcome the evil

[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:07] god has three ways of doing he don't
[1:23:08] ever change he told you the first pull
[1:23:11] is always popularity everybody loves you
[1:23:15] because that's when you heal the sick
[1:23:16] and you cast out devils and you even
[1:23:18] raise the dead so you do that in the
[1:23:21] first phase jesus did it and brother
[1:23:22] brahm did it but when you come down to
[1:23:25] declaring what the doctrine is
[1:23:27] he said then you enter into another
[1:23:29] phase that's when
[1:23:32] you're mean
[1:23:33] and you're only prophesying
[1:23:36] praise god what's going to happen so
[1:23:39] you're prophesying your own promises got
[1:23:42] nothing to do with no other church
[1:23:44] you're solving in your own church in new
[1:23:46] york then some other brothers see the
[1:23:49] vision they ask you to come to trinidad
[1:23:51] or europe or somewhere well that's
[1:23:53] between you and them
[1:23:55] not the other critics
[1:23:57] that underdo with those critics i mean
[1:23:59] do you understand that we stand here we
[1:24:02] come from god
[1:24:03] it doesn't make any difference who comes
[1:24:05] in here
[1:24:06] that we think has nothing to do with
[1:24:08] this that god put us here
[1:24:12] i mean we are his children
[1:24:15] and we sing the way we want to sing we
[1:24:18] shout the way we want to shout
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:21] we do the things the way we want to do
[1:24:23] them
[1:24:25] and we're not on a microscope
[1:24:27] of some other believers we don't have
[1:24:30] anything to do with them
[1:24:32] they have their own way of worshiping
[1:24:34] and then we respect them like brother
[1:24:35] branham got down with the african and
[1:24:37] worship well we'll go in there if they
[1:24:40] say oh
[1:24:41] man we'll do the same thing it's all
[1:24:42] right praise god
[1:24:44] but if if i feel that brother i've been
[1:24:47] sick for about
[1:24:48] 30 days all of a sudden i get a quick
[1:24:50] name and get healed and you mean i can't
[1:24:52] shout
[1:24:52] [Applause]

[1:24:59] amen oh no see so
[1:25:02] long time ago the holy spirit said son

[1:25:29] is a deeper revelation and experience
[1:25:31] which takes them into the to the
[1:25:33] councils of the godhead
[1:25:35] the unsealing of the living testimony
[1:25:37] under the seventh seal they learn not
[1:25:39] only what god has done but they learn uh
[1:25:42] why he did it
[1:25:44] and their roots go deeper into the
[1:25:46] eternal truth of elohim praise
[1:25:50] yessiree
[1:25:51] way back into the back parts of elohim's
[1:25:54] mind before there ever was a beginning

[1:28:40] perfect man page 59
[1:28:42] to the ministers
[1:28:44] he said
[1:28:45] lord

[1:29:26] thunders voices this that that's what i
[1:29:28] was doing i was identifying the
[1:29:30] prophet's message that it would stay
[1:29:32] alive
[1:29:32] pray no devil couldn't tear a town
[1:29:34] praise god and today it remains with the
[1:29:38] same power
[1:29:39] oh hallelujah and if you don't believe
[1:29:42] me you watch a revival break out and
