[7:50] haven't salute to brothers and sisters
[7:52] that we knew before the foundation where
[7:53] we happen to be born in Africa hema
[7:58] praise God so we deem it a blessing and
[8:01] a privilege at this time too to just
[8:04] steal away from maybe we would be in the
[8:07] restaurant talking about something or
[8:09] maybe I run up and down the hallway
[8:10] somewhere so we steal away from that
[8:13] this to come and have a little
[8:14] fellowship with our brothers and sisters
[8:17] and salute them praise God Oh blessed be
[8:22] the name of the Lord and the song that
[8:27] New York saying here step out on faith
[8:30] [Applause]
[8:34] that song was saying for my brothers and
[8:36] sisters from Africa so you step out on
[8:40] faith
[8:41] they they they write me some of them
[8:45] over the years that brother Coleman I
[8:47] will be in pen Harris my fame as well
[8:50] praise the God a brother a man and God
[8:53] will make it soul soul
[8:55] Temari may be seated to our brothers
[8:57] sisters the song was sang for you amen
[9:00] as a tribute to your faith stepping out
[9:03] on faith
[9:03] amen praise God so we certainly are
[9:08] happy to be able to do this you know and
[9:11] they have a responsibility our brothers
[9:14] and that here from Nigeria and
[9:16] representing the rest you know they have
[9:18] a great responsibility and we all do
[9:20] amen and so and running from the
[9:23] presence of the Lord and we don't want
[9:25] to go down to the old dishrag going down
[9:28] to Tarsus you know we are how we're
[9:31] responsible for a message and we have to
[9:34] deliver that message straight to Nineveh
[9:38] amen sometimes we go this way Annette
[9:41] way to get there and may have to be
[9:44] swallowed by a big fish or something
[9:46] amen
[9:46] and God I take it right to it you're
[9:48] supposed to go and dump you out on the
[9:49] beach reap in there if you miss that
[9:54] like to say repent hey man see but
[9:56] that's the responsibility
[9:58] and we accepted him and praise God my
[10:04] brother Brown speaking about a man the
[10:06] woman for wife and page 14 you see the
[10:09] files young young man looking for where
[10:10] I have to be married here's to the girl
[10:12] I've met every qualification I thought
[10:13] it would to make a woman why morally she
[10:16] was a queen and lovely and firing purse
[10:19] personality a real Christian everything
[10:21] that I could think of to make me a good
[10:24] wife no matter how much I think she's
[10:26] perfect she's exactly right she isn't
[10:28] mine to accept her and responsibility of
[10:32] her being my wife so when we accept this
[10:35] message and responsibility of being in
[10:39] this message and part of it then you
[10:41] have really accepted the message
[10:45] Baima and all and it goes with it the
[10:47] reproach and everything else the Baron
[10:49] is the whole thing aim that's the same
[10:53] thing the messages you might say is
[10:54] right of this that or the other and say
[10:56] I sympathize with it I believe it's the
[10:58] truth
[10:59] but you got to accept it it's got to
[11:01] become a part of you and you a part of
[11:03] it you you got then it's yours oh my
[11:07] praise God aren't you happy that you
[11:09] accepted hey man
[11:11] no we just noticed in the meatman said
[11:13] is getting you ready for what's going on
[11:16] because the enemy is gonna come in there
[11:18] man
[11:19] page 16 I wish you wash you speaking by
[11:22] going down at Tarsus too many Christians
[11:24] today are so soft soap and everything
[11:25] until they think all they do is join a
[11:28] church and go in somewhere put their
[11:30] name on a book I'll do a little
[11:31] something jump up and down and shout out
[11:33] or something like that and call it
[11:34] Christianity no he says Christianity is
[11:37] a every everyday
[11:38] rugged living for God in this present
[11:42] world a constant burning of the fire and
[11:44] the love of God in the heart that sets
[11:47] you afire and put you out yonder with
[11:49] the people and makin converts to Christ
[11:52] Amy and the responsibility that God has
[11:58] given us in this day to bring this
[11:59] message and as I did get over as I got
[12:02] as I get old and I know my days are
[12:04] short enough I feel a responsibility
[12:06] greater than I ever felt press it on we
[12:11] must do it just seal is open press it on
[12:15] dynamics and mechanics together seven
[12:18] thunders gives faith press that message
[12:20] on adoption time perfection time the
[12:25] rapture is here the resurrection is at
[12:26] hand press it on responsibility Amen
[12:32] president we must do we must get down we
[12:35] must get down to it in everywhere we go
[12:39] and tell the message and tell the people
[12:41] that Jesus is coming that he's God and
[12:43] he's coming soon and there's not a hope
[12:46] left in the world but the coming of the
[12:47] Lord now when we can identify with that
[12:50] then we will be beginning to become
[12:53] formed into real Christians that's not a
[12:56] shame to say I'm not identified with
[12:58] this world
[12:59] I'm identified with that message from
[13:01] Malachi 4 and our brothers from Africa
[13:04] they are responsible amen to go back and
[13:08] tell the nation about this message here
[13:11] that's what they're doing and also of
[13:14] course brother Joseph Branham you see
[13:17] the pushes on with with the voice of God
[13:19] into spoken word publications to get the
[13:21] voice out with the messages praise God
[13:23] and even they they have the free tape
[13:27] library down into Africa in different
[13:28] places and if anybody any Americans are
[13:31] Canadian anybody ever want to do
[13:32] anything for God to me I would push get
[13:35] behind that and helped establish free
[13:37] tape libraries where the voice of
[13:39] Malachi 4 can be heard along praise God
[13:41] with the spoken word publication to
[13:43] dovetail to know what that prophet said
[13:46] amen so you can rain Jeffersonville and
[13:48] find out how you can go about
[13:49] establishing the free tape library now
[13:52] nobody asked me to say this now I'm just
[13:53] I swear I feel amen praise the guys and
[13:57] don't worry if any ministers come behind
[13:59] the tape in the book from alpha Monday
[14:02] at 7:00 still they'll be speaking the
[14:03] same thing yes sir
[14:06] also we're so happy here and knowing
[14:09] what we're doing here
[14:11] praise God amen by the u-19 time is on
[14:17] even all the clouds must unite so you
[14:20] can have some rain praise God the Ducks
[14:24] unite to go down in the Louisiana Texas
[14:26] to get some rains a man and we're
[14:28] uniting Oh what do you know what are you
[14:32] a you you're uniting for amen I mean
[14:34] yeah you're for the resurrection brother
[14:38] 19 time and sign page 21 22 then I'm
[14:41] gonna bring up the speakers God u19 time
[14:45] yes sir all mine now remember there's
[14:46] nothing of the word you don't need back
[14:48] again bringing back the faith that was
[14:51] once delivered to the Saints bringing
[14:53] back that this could only be done in
[14:54] this day the only time it could be done
[14:57] is right now I it never attacked
[14:59] anywhere else they went off on
[15:01] denominational sprees but now it don't
[15:03] belong to no denominational spray
[15:05] because it's time for the uniting of men
[15:08] and women of every race every color
[15:11] creed everything under Christ by what by
[15:16] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and after
[15:19] you baptize with the Holy Spirit back to
[15:22] the word to prove that you're baptized
[15:25] with the Holy Ghost
[15:27] amen is that one of them will be
[15:30] knighted him for another outpouring
[15:33] another reef Dylan of the baptism of the
[15:38] Holy Ghost and back to the Bible back to
[15:41] the principles laid down on the day of
[15:43] Pentecost back to the word amen praise

[16:02] blessing to visit just Billy Indiana in

[18:14] remembers everything heaven it don't get
[18:17] tangle up him with him in the old Bible
[18:19] I tell you he knows all the scriptures
[18:22] even praise God and brother branham took
[18:25] out a beautiful ebony statue of a male
[18:28] African from a shelf where many other
[18:32] trophies were on display
[18:34] and he began to minister to us using
[18:37] this statue as a point of reference he
[18:42] said you see this African he loves his
[18:45] God he really loves his God
[18:47] notice his hands are tied behind his
[18:50] back securely he cannot defend himself
[18:52] he has had a bone driven through his
[18:56] lips clamping his mouth shut
[18:58] he cannot cry out he cannot eat he is
[19:02] going to be put out in the jungle alone
[19:06] with all the wall animals for sacrifice
[19:08] unto his God he loves his God so much he
[19:13] loves his God so much that he is willing
[19:16] to die for him through the Prophet Owens
[19:19] brother Rams
[19:20] also stated there is a tribe in Africa
[19:23] their sacrifice is children to
[19:25] crocodiles to think on this for a little
[19:28] while
[19:29] they love their God so much that they
[19:32] are willing to die for him then after
[19:35] brief pause he said aren't you glad our
[19:39] God only wants us to live for him
[19:43] humming my glee that all god only wants
[19:47] us to live for him and to walk in the
[19:51] bloody footprints on the sins of time
[19:54] now the footprints that brother Frank
[19:57] spoke about this morning is already laid
[19:59] out straight to the resurrection and can
[20:02] no devil keep you out of there
[20:04] and he only wants you to live for him
[20:08] because our age we have to live and
[20:11] stand no death but staying in a
[20:15] resurrection alive praise God and He
[20:21] will give us the Holy Ghost to hone the
[20:23] word in the South praise God and then we
[20:27] will live for him what else can I tell
[20:30] you it is my blessing and my privilege
[20:33] amen

[20:58] pyramid
[20:58] amen now he isn't the only one feeling
[21:01] that pair of it I don't want the brother

[21:57] a man we appreciate our brothers now
[22:01] there would be more here but they just
[22:04] had a because the economy thing in the
[22:06] country and it's very very hard for me
[22:08] getting the money to take out our really
[22:10] frankly I don't know how they make all
[22:12] these meetings say man it's just gone
[22:13] but they want to be here
[22:15] amen and so therefore we took this time
[22:19] out we know that brother branham's heart
[22:21] was went out to Africa
[22:23] he said I'm called to Africa do you know
[22:25] what was he talking about amen
[22:27] but that was God in the prophets I'm
[22:29] call a man many minds are blown out
[22:32] trying to figure it out and then praise
[22:34] God but all I know is that I just want
[22:37] to take this little time out to salute
[22:39] my brother's here and there's the others
[22:41] on down it is not here they're
[22:43] representing them
[22:44] and I appreciate that we should had
[22:45] little bit more time amen praise God or
[22:50] really say what I feel in this sincerity
[22:54] in their faith and they don't care
[22:56] come what may they come to New York it's
[22:59] snowing is cold ain't got no coats
[23:01] overcoats and things on they don't care
[23:03] that they kept warm by the fire okay it
[23:09] doesn't bother them see we might we go
[23:12] and make sure it's going to Europe I
[23:13] better have on all the things necessary

[23:18] Tommy heaven praise God
[23:20] gotta make sure we have on a furs and
[23:22] things a man if you're gonna go over

[23:30] Joseph random and spoken word and voice
[23:33] of God knowing they make an all-out push
[23:35] to get the message out to Africa and
[23:38] Indian all the different places so what
[23:40] little we could do is just to give the
[23:42] kind of solution Amen praise to God and
[23:46] so now I've introduced them and so I'm
[23:48] not gonna come behind each one because
[23:49] we don't have the time and so we're
[23:52] going to ask the New York group to come
