[0:00] so now this morning would you turn with
[0:03] me to the Word of God we always love to
[0:05] turn to his word st. Luke the second
[0:09] chapter the 25th verse want to read down
[0:15] through that the 35th verse you write it
[0:21] down I'm wanna I want to read from
[0:23] second Corinthians the fourth chapter
[0:26] the 13th verse through the 18th verse
[0:33] reading from st. Luke 2nd chapter
[0:37] 25th verse and behold there was a man in
[0:45] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[0:49] same man was just and devout waiting for
[0:53] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[0:56] Ghost was upon it and it was revealed
[1:00] unto him by the Holy Ghost that he
[1:03] should not see death before he had seen
[1:07] the Lord's Christ and he came by the
[1:10] spirit into the temple and when the
[1:14] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[1:17] for him after the custom of the law then
[1:20] took him up in his arms and blessed God
[1:23] and said Lord now lettest thou thy
[1:26] servant depart in peace according to
[1:30] that word for mine eyes have seen thy
[1:33] salvation which thou has prepared other
[1:36] words made already before the face of
[1:39] all people a light to lighten the
[1:42] Gentiles and the glory of thy people
[1:45] Israel and Joseph and his mother
[1:47] marveled at those things which were
[1:49] spoken of him and Simeon blessed them
[1:51] and said unto Mary his mother behold
[1:54] this child is set for the fall and the
[1:57] rising of again of many in Israel and
[2:02] for sign which shall be spoken against
[2:06] now this is a private to Mary here EA a
[2:10] sword shall pierce through that old
[2:13] so also and this rest of the follows of
[2:16] what he said about a sign shall be
[2:17] spoken against science shall be spoken
[2:20] against that the thoughts of many hearts
[2:22] may be revealed ii corinthians for the
[2:28] thirteenth verse we we having the same
[2:36] spirit of faith according as it is
[2:39] written i believe and therefore have i
[2:43] spoken we also believe in therefore
[2:46] speak knowing that he which raised up
[2:49] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[2:52] Jesus and shall present us with you for
[2:55] all things are for your sakes that the
[2:58] abundant grace might through the
[3:00] Thanksgiving of many redound to the
[3:03] glory of God for which cause we faint
[3:06] not but through our outward man but
[3:09] though out the man perish yet the inward
[3:12] man is renewed day by day for our light
[3:15] affliction which is but for a moment
[3:17] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[3:20] eternal weight of glory while we look
[3:22] not at the things which are seen but the
[3:24] things which are not seen for the thing
[3:26] which are seen are temporal but the
[3:28] things which are not seen are eternal
[3:30] they got a blessing to read on this word
[3:33] I like the title just a little thought
[3:37] spirit of faith for we find here a pole
[3:41] in a thirteenth verse saying we have in
[3:44] the same spirit of faith a corner is
[3:47] written I believe and therefore have I
[3:49] spoken we also believe therefore speak
[3:57] so it is very dry let's bow our heads
[4:02] again Heavenly Father God we're can only
[4:06] open the book the Lord we feel thy sweet
[4:10] presence here this morning movin up on
[4:13] the word and now God maybe you just come
[4:16] down and Lord and take this word out to
[4:19] that people Lord well we are nothing
[4:21] Lord we are thy children and perchance
[4:24] this morning the Holy Spirit has just
[4:27] single out me Lord to stand here God to
[4:31] bring forth these words tonight people
[4:34] but follow me the people hear the words
[4:36] and believe the words of God that you
[4:40] might all God be implanted in their
[4:42] souls and our souls together Lord that
[4:44] we might arise in the rapture well we
[4:48] are waiting for it it has been spoken so
[4:51] shall it be we asked it in Jesus Christ
[4:54] statement for his glory amen
[4:56] so now this morning my message is about
[5:00] the spirit of faith and Paul speaking
[5:02] here I'm trying to let the Holy Spirit
[5:04] tie-in Simeon with the words that Paul
[5:08] spoke over here tied in together and the
[5:10] spirit of faith ties it in together and
[5:13] now we know that the many great
[5:16] tremendous messages preached on faith
[5:18] and but we cannot because preach it
[5:22] enough think because faith is what we
[5:26] have to have for if we don't have faith
[5:29] it is impossible to please God we must
[5:32] come to God believing that he is in all
[5:37] things outside of it means nothing is
[5:39] just temporal it's just going to because
[5:41] pass away so therefore faith as we've
[5:46] heard many definitions of it we
[5:48] understand that it is the revelation of
[5:50] the will of God it is what some
[5:54] supernatural on-scene force by a choice
[5:59] by grace perchance would reveal to our
[6:03] hearts a certain something a certain
[6:07] message his thoughts comes into our
[6:10] hearts by
[6:11] spirit and the spirit Paul calls it the
[6:13] spirit of faith amen then others they
[6:17] don't see what has been revealed to you
[6:19] you know it you can't explain it
[6:22] it's hard to express it but you just do
[6:26] it
[6:26] hey man because our supernatural unseen
[6:29] man reveals it to you and the others
[6:32] around buddy won't know what makes it
[6:33] tick I mean how do you know that you
[6:35] know I just know I know I can't explain
[6:38] it
[6:38] there's just something that's there what
[6:41] is it the spirit of face setting up on
[6:43] you same Edward because Simeon they
[6:46] disappear if they set up on him rested
[6:50] up on him
[6:51] can't see it see but it's there amen so
[6:55] we see faith means putting our full
[6:58] confidence in the things that we hope
[7:02] for in it all right just put all our
[7:05] trust our belief our confidence and
[7:09] whatever are we hoping for we're hoping
[7:13] for a resurrection and also rapture amen
[7:17] because of because fine heritance well
[7:19] then this then faith is the full
[7:22] confidence then confidence is substance
[7:25] amen
[7:26] that is the substance of things hoped
[7:28] for that right it means faith means to
[7:32] be certain of the things that we cannot
[7:35] see then right we are certain then
[7:39] certain means to have evidence of things
[7:42] not seen
[7:43] we have the evidence we are certain we
[7:45] don't see it but we got it where is
[7:47] unseen
[7:48] there's supernatural is hanging right
[7:50] there amen yes sir and then see this
[7:55] supernatural unseen faith God uses that
[7:58] to water every seat Amen by Adam with a
[8:02] seat in God's garden and as long as he
[8:06] believed what God said by the spirit of
[8:09] faith rested upon him and that spirit of
[8:12] faith wanted Adam day by day he was a
[8:16] seed in the garden being ordered by
[8:19] faith amen and in the will of God was
[8:23] the
[8:24] was the revelation of God's will and
[8:26] God's Will was don't touch the tree of
[8:29] knowledge of good and evil as long as he
[8:32] didn't touch it he was being worried by
[8:34] the faith not to touch it
[8:36] amen he kept all milk in and God kept on
[8:38] blessing amen we all understand the
[8:41] story how because Eve she went she got
[8:45] away from the spirit of faith and she
[8:47] went out for knowledge for a new way to
[8:49] do it faith was too simple because we
[8:53] Eve that was silly just because don't
[8:55] touch it that'll mean nothing but God
[8:58] spoke it it meant something it meant
[9:00] life and death eternity that's what it
[9:03] meant but it was too simple and every
[9:06] message is always simple and so we see
[9:09] there that God water nor by faith is
[9:14] that right faith was the will of God so
[9:17] therefore one day God's will picked out
[9:20] nor nor being warned the co Hebrews says
[9:23] of things not seen that right he was
[9:28] warned of things not seen
[9:29] and then when he was warned God said it
[9:32] a supernatural God spoken said it's
[9:36] going to rain on there he does see the
[9:39] rain it never had rain before but he had
[9:42] confidence he was certain that it was
[9:45] going to rain for God said it amen so
[9:48] therefore when he was certain when the
[9:50] spirit of faith arrested there he moved
[9:52] there amen and every child of God right
[9:56] now is moving with fear for this certain
[9:58] that God has come down goddess and their
[10:01] cars positive indicators word
[10:04] yes sir Gaza has probably let it be done
[10:07] we are going to be in a resurrection
[10:09] Helen we're going to be in the rapture
[10:12] this has been spoken it's supernatural
[10:16] I feel it I'm confident that's gonna be
[10:22] amen what is it is a spirit of faith
[10:25] that you can't see but it's there
[10:27] nevertheless amen so no move with fear
[10:32] to the saving of his house by the which
[10:35] which what the faith this Ark that he
[10:39] believed that condemned the world and
[10:41] the Ark is a type of Jesus Christ the
[10:43] Word of God
[10:44] hey man praise be to God
[10:47] yes sir Abraham was told to go out into
[10:51] the land he had never been before and he
[10:53] would receive an inheritance is that
[10:56] right he's soldiering out there looking
[10:59] for a city out there
[11:01] Amen he had seen a vision of a sparrow
[11:04] feet rested up on him he kept looking
[11:07] for he fell down he got up but he stayed
[11:10] with the word
[11:15] giving praise to God yes sir
[11:18] he stayed with that word he's sojourned
[11:21] it was only a little short while
[11:23] temporarily we only sojourning here now
[11:26] with passing through this muck and mire
[11:29] God is just bring us right off there
[11:31] yeah we're not going to stay here we
[11:33] come amen let the redeemed say so is
[11:43] that right friend speak it out speaks it
[11:46] our faith speaks it out
[11:47] praise be talca amen so he's tagging now
[11:51] he was strong giving praise to come yes
[11:54] sir what was his sacred there's always a
[11:56] sacred his secret was that he looked for
[11:59] a city there's a secret a man which had
[12:03] foundations whose builder and maker was
[12:05] God all the way he looked for he was
[12:08] expecting something amen expectation can
[12:16] get some by which a resurrection
[12:19] expecting a pail got to fall out
[12:21] expecting a rapture expecting for Christ
[12:25] to come and maracle his word
[12:28] [Applause]
[12:33] he moves in difference yes sir
[12:36] and so therefore because Abraham was
[12:39] there expecting waiting expecting like a
[12:43] woman is waiting with an expectant child
[12:46] to come forth
[12:47] she's waiting and she's wished she'd
[12:49] know was gonna be what is there she
[12:55] feels every day every night she's
[12:57] waiting she's expecting a child to come
[12:59] for more than there's a seat of God in
[13:01] the back is there for God has spoken it
[13:05] he must speak it by the seat of the way
[13:08] first
[13:08] first is the seat of the way you don't
[13:10] see that then to see the word before you
[13:13] can have the real seat the see the word
[13:16] must be spoken supernaturally first it's
[13:18] out there then when you believe it then
[13:21] the sphere of the word begins to roll
[13:23] and shake the word of God the word the
[13:26] word was freeing my thing which is not
[13:28] seen which is the wire to see the car
[13:31] got stuck it don't see it out there but
[13:34] it's there
[13:34] well he said is there Amen praise God
[13:38] that right friends yes sir all of these
[13:42] old heroes of faith pinnacle / Hebrews

[13:52] fire amen
[13:55] then look the eyes with an order when I
[13:57] say the words head so straight ahead

[14:03] side it couldn't see the lip normally it
[14:06] looks straight in here

[14:10] straight ahead

[14:14] this song by feet this song it's like

[17:28] great such a peril that he put in their

[27:36] can't do it no more
[27:37] something holes in the heart absolutely
[27:41] hos on to the Word of God but by the

[28:29] of it amen praise God Jesus said I'll
[28:32] never leave you our never forsake you
[28:35] so that we might boldly say the Lord is
[28:37] my helper and I will not fear what man
[28:40] can do I don't care what they say
[28:47] against it the Bible Simeon prophesied
[28:50] that they would speak against a sign and
[28:52] then not talking against you their
[28:54] tongue against that pillar of fire hey
[28:56] amen
[28:57] let's turn it standard that spirit of
[29:00] faith raised it up to look him in the
[29:03] face and speak the Word of God holy and
[29:05] therefore they look past and looking at
[29:08] that in the heart did they don't see
[29:10] that that's a spirit of faith in their
[29:11] right they don't understand it but you
[29:13] pray for them you don't faint when they
[29:14] look at hard looks and get in got a
[29:17] spirit of faith and hanging in there I
[29:18] can't faint faints not as strong just
[29:21] praise to God amen spirit of crisis in
[29:24] there is Howard made he waste away
[29:27] praise be to God no matter what happens
[29:30] friends so Paul tells us this light
[29:33] affliction that's all it is just a light
[29:35] affliction slight because this dress is
[29:37] just gonna pass a way to solve this
[29:39] thing all our troubles are short-lived
[29:41] they are short-lived troubles we
[29:44] understand now therefore Paul says here
[29:47] because our eyes is fixed on the things
[29:50] not seen Sudheer now it's fixed there
[29:53] then it does not look at the things seen
[29:55] all these things happening around here
[29:57] that we don't look at that we look
[29:59] pacifier and we embraced a parameter
[30:03] that is coming to us you're finding our
[30:05] friends therefore we have the same
[30:08] spirit of faith hid because David had
[30:10] open sound 116 he said I have believed
[30:13] and therefore have I spoken and Paul is
[30:16] saying right here in 2nd Corinthians 4
[30:18] that we believe also and we speak you
[30:21] must say it say you speak it out and
[30:23] when you say it you create an atmosphere
[30:26] right now the word is being spoken by a
[30:29] spirit of faith and an atmosphere is
[30:31] here now any devil would walk in ahead
[30:33] now he would be challenged by the
[30:35] Almighty
[30:37] he cannot stand in the presence of
[30:40] Almighty God he have to go
[30:42] what is sickness whatever it is they
[30:44] don't have to go in a spirit of faith
[30:46] atmosphere right amen and then that word
[30:49] can go out the store can pierce right on
[30:52] out
[30:52] praise be to God amen but if a Paul knew
[30:57] that the spirit of faith has been
[30:59] because of deal to us we know that we
[31:02] are the bride because it because humble
[31:05] not puffed up we are the bride by faith
[31:08] in it because the Spirit says coming up
[31:11] bride says come but they say the same
[31:14] thing and the Spirit come down through
[31:17] Malachi 4 and spoke all these wonderful
[31:19] things we embrace them in our hearts we
[31:22] don't understand them all but we embrace
[31:24] them and we save what is said for is in
[31:28] the Bible amen praise God
[31:31] so now we are are expecting Christ to
[31:35] come on the scene the right frames can
[31:38] we say Amen we are because we are hoping
[31:40] that he will come and take us away from
[31:42] here and that's one for you're looking
[31:44] for your promise see now faith is unseen
[31:47] force see power but faith has been
[31:51] restored army is here see how you can't
[31:56] see it that this evidence is here this
[31:59] curve is hit from Malachi force pocket
[32:02] what is unseen what is there
[32:04] nevertheless now faith has been restored
[32:07] just spirit of faith this prophetic
[32:10] vision that was see love according to
[32:13] Daniel where the word would come by
[32:15] vision pop out right before you you
[32:18] found in our friends the prophetic
[32:20] vision has been restored sixth vision

[33:47] pious prophetic message that connected
[33:51] them that convinced him it was the word
[33:53] spoken directly it was Stephen speaking
[33:57] of Stephen Christ speaking directly by
[34:00] inspiration from God there was never a
[34:03] more perfect message word by word in the
[34:06] Greek than with Stephen spoke when it
[34:08] was Christ their voice uses vocal cords
[34:11] speaking out convicted in a heart and

[44:12] and devout man because he was waiting
[44:16] for expecting the constellation they
[44:20] comfort the restoration of Israel and
[44:22] right he was expecting them then he had
[44:25] a right mental attitude see the right
[44:27] mental attitude mental faith because
[44:30] first is your mental faith first because
[44:33] you hear and men of faith turns to it
[44:35] see and then God sends down the
[44:37] spiritual faith in
[44:39] Nexen hi that's the way it goes see but
[44:41] first you must hear and mental fate
[44:43] catches that deer what is that
[44:45] see and if it's a a true sound you know

[44:51] something happens to you
[44:52] amen and you're never the same no more
[44:53] Amen for spiritual faith
[44:56] that's called elemental faith yes sir so
[44:59] he was expecting see for God had told
[45:02] him that he would not see death till he
[45:06] would see the Lord's Christ then he read
[45:08] the word Isaiah 9:6 unto us Judith a son
[45:12] is given child is born shall be called
[45:14] wonderful counselor if Emmanuel Simeon
[45:18] knew that he read it every day then the
[45:20] Holy Ghost spirit of faith set up on her
[45:23] one day and say you personally not the
[45:25] rest of you personally shall not taste
[45:28] death until you at your eyes see the
[45:31] Lord's Christ amen that promise was in
[45:35] his heart he couldn't tell him look I'm
[45:36] gonna see because anything Amen cuz they
[45:39] wouldn't believe right and right but
[45:41] then he he was blameless see now he was
[45:45] not still this see but for his sins he
[45:49] offered the prescribed sacrifice amen
[45:52] and we blame his also justified then if
[45:56] we sin we offer the prescribed sacrifice
[45:58] the blood he offered it so he knew he
[46:01] was standing at because he had a promise
[46:03] and God's Holy Ghost revealed to him
[46:06] that this promise and it was according
[46:09] to the Word of God he had to seat his
[46:11] friends
[46:12] now you can see he was really expecting
[46:14] then when the season in a time come see
[46:17] that in his heart he was waiting looking
[46:20] for it then before he could find it for
[46:22] the Bible says the Spirit of the Lord
[46:26] let him Amen the Spirit of the Lord let
[46:30] him he couldn't find it himself go all
[46:32] of those babies in there all right the

[47:09] right to the right children and will
[47:15] lead us straight to the Christ the word
[47:18] for it has been spoken to your heart it
[47:22] has been revealed by the Holy Ghost and
[47:24] a spirit faded in your heart now and you
[47:27] could walk right past a false crisis and
[47:29] when you meet a true Christ this is a
[47:34] man just you can't explain how can you
[47:37] explain that never you just know that a
[47:39] man so therefore by the spirit we move
[47:42] led by the spirit amen
[47:44] 4 therefore God will lead us all so
[47:47] friends now because notice how do you
[47:50] know unseen force now he prophesied that
[47:54] Jesus Christ would be a light to the
[47:56] Gentiles all right for revelation to the
[48:00] Gentiles to reveal these hidden things
[48:03] to them and a glory to Israel now he
[48:06] blessed Mary and Joseph and said to Mary
[48:09] he said that this child is destined to
[48:13] make many fall and many rise in Israel
[48:15] and a sign which shall be spoken against
[48:19] this child shall set up a stand he'll be
[48:22] a standard see which many shall attack a
[48:24] stone of stumbling they shall reject it
[48:28] see and he was prophesying here see and
[48:30] he says for he will expose the secrets
[48:33] thoughts of many hearts in other words
[48:35] when this word comes into your midst
[48:38] it's a siren it's a standard that it
[48:42] will expose the thoughts in somebody's
[48:44] hearts in the midst read this word is
[48:46] spoken by you follow me our friends now
[48:49] he told Mary awful because her very soul
[48:51] would be pierced she would be in anguish
[48:54] when she would see the Sun up on the
[48:56] cross
[48:56] and she will her heart was the Pierce
[48:59] cousin John 1925
[49:01] my heart was Pierce but what was it it
[49:03] was a sign a standard to be rejected he
[49:06] was because rejected but God over knives
[49:09] there 50 said gave him the tongue of the
[49:12] learned he know how to speak a word to
[49:15] the D weary in season and here we are
[49:19] weary he's come down with the tongue of
[49:22] the learn the words of god of wisdom and
[49:24] opened our hearts we were weary and
[49:26] finish it all and sent us down the
[49:29] spirit of faith amen praise God he gave
[49:32] us back to the spider's and his cheek to
[49:36] those who because pluck out the beers he
[49:38] hid his face not from those who spit at
[49:41] him and smote him he denied his facing
[49:43] so therefore he was despised and
[49:45] rejected now but he set his face like
[49:48] flint for the course that his father
[49:51] laid out before in amen and so he could
[49:54] say I have finished the course I have
[49:56] kept the faith I have fought a good
[49:58] fight
[49:58] amen Paul said that every true sir know
[50:01] Christ was able to say that but knows it
[50:04] was the course that he laid out there is
[50:07] the way of the Cross there is deed
[50:10] because work of the Cross all of us
[50:12] except the cross is work in our hearts
[50:15] but that cross lays out a way for us
[50:18] that is despised rejected amen and you
[50:23] will walk that straight line there if
[50:25] you will walk in the way of the cross
[50:27] that's all it is friends because
[50:29] rejection said because we know it so we
[50:32] see then that why were they all
[50:35] persecuted because it was a sign of
[50:37] standeth that had to be spoken against
[50:40] so when you stay with the message today
[50:43] they speak against not you the sign in
[50:47] you I see that must be spoken against is
[50:51] the less it's just straight and true see
[50:53] so therefore there must be heresies
[50:55] among you here and all around a brother
[50:58] say what is this know is that the
[51:01] heresies must be their souls that all
[51:04] hang on by the spirit of faith
[51:06] amen the genuine one those who are
[51:09] proved those we came down from glory
[51:13] fear they might be made manifest you
[51:16] might see them and you won't be dry so
[51:18] well this truly is the Word of God
[51:20] something tells me that no matter what
[51:22] they say it'll be here you missed right
[51:24] here and many others around you will say
[51:26] all kind of heresies but it won't ring
[51:29] true there'd be many trumpets but it
[51:30] won't ring true amen
[51:32] so therefore Peter said over here and
[51:35] first Peter 3 I believe is before what
[51:36] glory is it when he be buffeted because
[51:39] for your faults and you take it
[51:41] patiently but if when you do well and
[51:44] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[51:46] is acceptable unto God see when it's not
[51:50] your fault and it speak against you say
[51:53] all kind of things against you if you
[51:55] take that because patiently that's what
[51:57] God that's all he receives back for
[52:00] Christ suffered and each of them amen
[52:03] but we shall also reign with them praise
[52:05] be to our God so therefore all that live
[52:09] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[52:11] persecution there's no other way around
[52:14] for peace that we are because here until
[52:16] all we call to be suffering because for
[52:19] Christ now in closing now friends we
[52:24] know that God has given us a great
[52:27] message because the bear now that's
[52:29] women and men see the message is in
[52:32] woman and man say not this ministers see
[52:35] for you live the message there's the
[52:38] message see it's in your heart and you
[52:41] live what was spoken by God and you like
[52:44] Mary because you worship Him at the feet
[52:46] and you won't be because coming about
[52:48] serving the tables and so forth see but
[52:51] Mary knew D because she has desired the
[52:53] because better things see so those who
[52:56] because truly worship the Lord is your
[52:58] ship the word see and you stay at the
[53:01] feet of Jesus now true many people talk
[53:04] against you they don't understand you
[53:07] that's all right see that's good for you
[53:09] because the only molds you and shape see
[53:13] them in now for the word if you say well
[53:15] why is that law the word yeah all they
[53:17] lived God
[53:17] Christ shall suffer persecution there's
[53:20] the word don't spit it out
[53:21] receive it in the heart amen and they

[55:33] Amen for they call it to Jesus calling

[55:47] day Shem is kicking dirt on David
[55:50] and it's that sir that shall I cut off
[55:52] that dog's head the age of the Lord he
[55:54] said let him alone God has bitten him to
[55:57] kick dirt on me before I'm passing
[55:59] through but I'm coming back one day in
[56:01] power manifests so now Lord let me pass
[56:12] through the horrible critics I don't
[56:14] care what they say on the phones up in
[56:16] there around or whatever it is
[56:17] last night we just found out that when
[56:19] we built the church here because fix it
[56:21] over we've built a golden altar it have
[56:23] Bulls up here the sacrifice last night
[56:26] on the phone we just told that we've
[56:28] built we fix it over and put a goalless
[56:30] on they go an altar right here and we're
[56:32] sacrificing the New York bulls and goats
[56:34] and people work to believe that have an
[56:38] itching ears want to hear something nice
[56:40] so therefore I say let it come praise be
[56:44] to God for we're passing through a hole
[56:47] of critics glory to God how do you got
[56:50] this morning yes siree
[56:53] one bright in early morning praise be to
[56:57] God Jesus shall appear and take the
[57:01] other pictures the former in picture
[57:03] early church the lutheran picture the
[57:06] leslie pictured those 1906 because
[57:08] Pentecostal picture of christ when he
[57:11] worked that generation and this
[57:13] generation the seventh seal picture
[57:15] untouched by human ideas
[57:19] who are taken listen taking the thunder
[57:23] out of the message for it was seven
[57:26] thunders and they say it don't meet him
[57:29] outcomes of thunder wet it down
[57:31] perverted but I'm holding to what he
[57:34] said just like he said it said preach
[57:37] the word in season out of season in
[57:39] buchen resulted all long-suffering I'm a
[57:42] stayed in to a finish the course

[57:47] good for him by the help of God well he
[57:50] said I shall never leave you I shall
[57:53] never forsake you then then I can boldly
[57:56] said what I care what man's gonna do for
[57:58] man left I must run right through him
[58:01] now but because both side he must
[58:03] criticize well I don't think he should
[58:05] have said this and I think this is them
[58:06] so forth look go on and criticize every
[58:09] one of us we must go through that for
[58:11] Jesus went through it he said it'd be a
[58:14] time that right then who a standard that
[58:17] would be rejected and therefore it is
[58:20] not me or you is Christ in you being
[58:22] rejected to myth they want to turn it
[58:24] and say is this or that but it's not as
[58:27] what he said amen
[58:29] so therefore thanks be to God this
[58:33] picture message shows just what Christ
[58:35] is how he looks don't change it don't
[58:39] put a little dot over here if he got up
[58:41] because a lot of sorrow there don't put
[58:44] joy over there leave it right there

[58:48] that see then one morning he'll come and
[58:51] take all the pictures and gather them up
[58:53] and in his quarters up into glory and
