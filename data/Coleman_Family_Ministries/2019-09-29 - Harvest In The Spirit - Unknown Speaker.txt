TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's open a Word of God remember it is that the light of God's countenance is to be seen upon us let us open to the Word of God but is open to Galatians 2:20 I'm a read from Galatians 2:20 from 2nd Corinthians the fourth chapter the 7th through the twelfth verse I'm asking you to pray for me so I'm so weary and my mind's worn out so many things are going on and I changed my job yesterday from a parcel postman to a letter carrier and I spent about 20 years since I stood up and box up mail and also because took it out my legs are kind of wobbly I'm getting old praise the Lord I was really had to just come home yesterday and lay down amen they were throbbing praise the Lord so brother bin knows all about it amen sometimes you can't make that third landing don't obsess but nevertheless so sometimes you think you know I've been thinking Lord is this year that I could maybe a retire some way or something even in my mind I think well maybe I'd break an arm or something and then uh because go out on on conversation or something and then you know get a medical uh because a retirement or something like that you know just so I can serve God more you know but that's never the way you think it is see now I was just trying to I've been figuring out the last two or three years how I could retire because I'm so tired and weary and have more time for the Lord more time to pray and and and read the word and hear the tapes and serve God's people but just to have to go on working you know and so well then I'm thinking that will this be the year this is this is surely the year 1967 68 69 70 71 is the year and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit moves in about a month ago and this route comes up and tells me to take this first-class route so I'm going from one job to another job praise but that's God's will I'm happy to walk in the will of God but I I thought I liked to route around eighteen up on top of the hill where I'm have about eleven houses now which I have to deliver mail to but in about a month or so it should be cut down to only three houses praise God so up on top of a four George Hill I think it's one of the highest points in Manhattan in the city praise God so we don't understand these things but we just keep walking that's on for maybe I could retire and meanwhile I have to go and deliver mail but it's wonderful to know that in about a month or so after about a month trial you have about a thirty day trial for route I can rest in three houses for the Tonchi but ask me says what are you gonna do with all the time on your hands when you get to know the route I said don't worry praise the Lord I have a whole lot to do with it amen right now it's a struggle you know and I'll just take him type in natural thinking even how the post office department says its inception it was a man on a horse and he was going the wrong way because really going the opposite way on on the in sickness because on the patch and now they changed it last year to Eagle praise God and how the is really the first-class mail that the people wait for and long further to to read those epistles from their loved ones and checks and what not is that first-class letter carrier that the people look for the others because it were in the background the mail men the clerks and the mail handlers of whatnot nobody knows them just that letter carrier praise the Lord he's one see so you understand all these things but God knows what he's doing so you just keep walking praise the Lord so you're playing for me that I'll be able to go through this new a thirty or thirty day trial with the Ralph overcome amen and we'll overcome we know that that third stage which I want to speak about this morning it's a mighty climb uphill on the way on on the highway rather but there's only one door to the highway and that is the door Calvary and we have to stoop way way down to go through that door to get on to the highway Galatians 2:20 praise our God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me second Corinthians four the seventh verse but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life and you mean a lot of blessing to the reading of his word we like the tightest thought harvest in the spirit excuse me what is the consummation of discipleship in this life what are we looking for what is our goal what are we um endeavoring I don't like to say striving cussed riving sound like you're fighting for something saying and we don't have to fight for this it's freely given just accepted but we're never seen what is the consummation what are we moving out to now as remember that Jesus is our pattern st. John the tenth chapter says this to paraphrase it I am come that they may have life and that they might have it more abundantly other ways that it might be to the full till it overflows I am come that they will keep on receiving it until rivers of living water or actually pouring out of them that is why I am come the son of man came to give us life or ransom for many we know by instinct as Christians that this life is symbolized as the cross and the this principle is embedded is woven in the very nature of God see over in is and is this self giving love is the basic law to give of yourself love and a type of it and the natural is deed Lily it gives up just gives out see and the flowers of course it gives out a fragrance and then it dies you see now and Satan in the beginning or God made all of his beings free moral agents to have their own choice see and Satan because he had the same choice and steady and he wanted self seeking love seeking or the or the admiration and respect and rivers of all the angels to him he want to be like the Most High so he wanted that the graduation and he turned it around and perverted self given to self seeking evil for good self love for selfishness forceful meekness war for peace he just provided see and but Jesus was our example he never lived for himself his life was spent for others see that is perfectly eternal life to live for others see now or when you go to church and you do good things that's wonderful see but when you live your life and do good things to yourself that's not eternal life some people live a life where they don't want nobody outside to touch it they want to come here they'll give their ties and and it'll give an offering to a poor needy person but when they go home they don't one know nothing to come and break up their way of living if they want to go to bed at a certain time they want to go to bed then they want to wash their clothes or cooker so they don't want nothing to interfere with their selfish way of living but that is not the way of a Christian no matter what we do or because what our means and so forth because eternal life is living for others not for yourself see we must live for others and you take Christ's place as sons of God and live for others you live for the person that hates you you live for the person that resents you you live for the person that is jealous of you you live for the person that wants to maim you that's right well I'm getting annoying men just wanna hear Jesus Christ did he died on the cross for murderers for here's for this bag let all that are good for del Turris for wicked says he died for those who hated him is that right praise the Lord see so therefore Jesus did at Calvary he died for those who hated him we sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him see we don't do this for because we're in the line of duty or because you ought to do it or the thing is right before you and you know what you're supposed to do you don't do it then get a second thought well I should do that because they're after all a Christian would do that I'm in the message and but Arel he's taught that we should do this and we shouldn't do that see well that's not what I'm talking about see what I'm talking about that's when he's selfish you see what I'm talking about is just a normal daily action that's just automatically unconsciously coming out of you see it's like the Sheep just giving wool just a normal thing like he said these a sheep type people would be doing see just like the sheep they were so surprised when did we do that see when did we do it it was a normal thing thing turn him see me now so therefore it was automatically unconsciously see out of love see just his life lived in the people not a second thought see not some great a pity constantly emotion or great ministry see or perils and gifts and signs and wonders no sir it's just that self-sacrifice life that God lives in you automatically doing that which is right just because it is right see just going on don't even think about it the hackers praising are right in there cinema know when you're wet you're on a highway amen God has sent a message and deliverance to cleanse plant through the preaching of the word of God every spirit every every idea that would hinder the saints of God from living normally see the word comes to show these things up and the saints of God by revelation see what they are supplied as opposed to live and then the principles of the Sermon on the Mount can life can for through them praise the Lord you're on the highway only the broken ones in Connecticut ride the spirit broken down completely by the Lord and the most beautiful finger to see a card poker man town look great big strong something of flesh break him down in the spirit break him down in his flesh break him down in his heart break him down into the soul until he's molded and then we saw such a man the prophet of God and I like what the Brotherhood said now sisters don't think that you're gonna find brother branham because for a husband be thankful for what God has given you praise the Lord but nevertheless we is the broken ones you see that enter onto the highway and this Hara we're speaking about about three weeks ago is the way of holiness and off to the side is darkness and Satan stands on the side of the highway with many voices whispering to you as you walk along the highway just trying to pull you off to hide the Kings Highway with a voice a roaring voice it may come through legalism or any kind of thing of the world trying to pull you over to the side and fall down into quicksand but if you do slip off and we have everyday you quickly come back to the Lord and get back up on the highway amen see so the cross is the only entrance to the highway and we must do way down way down low to get on the highway to be broken memes to be not I a stiff neck but Christ liveth in me and we must be broken time after turn will see one say this morning you must be broken this morning what if I say no you must be broken tonight back in Wednesday dr. Sunday morning dr. Sunday night there with their attitude Lord break me Sunday morning break me Sunday night Britney Wednesday night and you see some broken ones who are not afraid to back up from the Word of God I won't be resenting the things you're saying see we must be broken time after time it will be a constant choice before us God brings his pressure to bear you want a scripture first Peter or one six wearing you greatly rejoice though now for season if need be ye are in Hibbing estroux mana for temptations if need be amen well who has the authority need be he has so far or manifold temptation comes if needs be the pressure comes and we appreciate all day long then right we wake up and pressure see where we can let it out in the word Christ only is when the pressure comes there's no way out now and if we get into the word then off the pressure well this is the right thing to do then you feel satisfied otherwise you try to figure it out striving and trying to figure the thing up and you will explode like that same so therefore God brings his pressure to bear on us that we must make the choice ourself if someone hurts us or slights us we immediately have the choice of accepting this slight or hurt C as a means of grace to Humble us we got the choice didn't shake my hand spoke mean to me this happened slighted me didn't bring me over to the house for dinner I didn't go to the because nobody call me call anybody else because I was slighted all kind of things little daily things insignificant things that we think but God sends them to homeless lower or we can resist it and stiffen our necks see get our on up and I'll get ripped up why why all went over just keep saying the same old thing why did this happen why did I happen because God says needs to be that's why so when somebody comes like that to me I just well where's Lauren on state about 5 mins I'm gone I'm get out of there cuz they refuse turn out the time at their time to accept the will of God and what no what can I do if somebody don't worry except the will of God can't do nothing what if they will humble themselves and that's if Nick is working like that then you can minister the work hey there that's what I stay away wait back in 65 the Holy Spirit told me stay away reach don't worry pray for the stick do what your kid on the oil only if they come in the back you're married that's all keep walking so let's write it amen well wasn't he appreciated it asked him some time to tell you at the work though well he told the only thing that held him was the message he said life float into him I'm cognate you might have life and that more abundantly what is right brother comas don't word is lash see people get riled up over little ol insignificant things to refuse that let the Lord change their daily living turn it around a little bit we all do see nobody has attained here I don't believe throw the first stone so don't be nervous I'm not saying that I have a team like that uh-huh I'll fight every day brother praise the Lord through the day our brokenness will be tested now we can't play Tim before the Lord when our brother comes to test your sister we keep the hallelujah the Lord knows your attitude you can't say yes yes I'm trying to push them out the door the only main out we're stopped wish they would get out of here yes there's life better first lost that's the way I'm closing the door after they gone God sees over there amen say praise our God we can't pretend and God may always test it with other people they demand from you so you worry you tell him brother guy said one time lad I couldn't do it because I was tired that day they will help it he allows him to come when you're tired and a stiff neck demanded Emanuel life you didn't do this in nagging and carrying on and here you butter shake and explode you're so nervous Amen somebody come ring your bell you ain't ready for nothing and praise a little Here I am ready for dinner or something you had even because call you on the phone nothing I told you anything here I am and now you're ready to go to pieces because here there your fellowship is torn up you know it hey man he says them allows them to come with their demands now if you find yourself in a patch of unbroken as' when these demands come go back to county and and say Lord forgive me break me down Lord today ah I didn't mean to be that way Lord though you went through it though you just got through by the skin of your teeth and they were blessed you had a nice communal whatever it is when they go out this door you better go to Calvary amen that's right see we you know the Lord's wait he knows he knows his flesh here and carry what do you see you see a picture of Jesus Christ continually broken for you and me didn't have to do it but he did took up his cross daily for us that will come daily for us then when you go to Calvary you see what he did for you you see the Lord break me down I'm nothing and he will and he'll send it look at brother bird look at Paul look at all the different dear people of God the trials come constantly coming demons and devils just constantly coming brother Brandon walked over in the other world he knew those spirits they talked to him saw them good thing we don't see him we think it's that person that person is your devil so devil autumn some cases in them you don't know which is which so you better pray amen just like the the old Pentecostal way sister here from Assembly of God but call me up through a sister they came here a paycock or something like that in the back end they came in once her with her husband she Dover New Jersey I think I spoke about him about two weeks ago all messed up about a door and whatnot a parade and her own pastor told her the devil's got your daughter that's the old Pentecost way the devil is the devil and what a Proctor came along explain why there's your message Pentecostal is devil you said years ago tell them made me do this here devil made me do this here but the Prophet come along and expose these Devils by the Word of God and so I expose the spirit for my daughter and explained it to her and she got a great peace she slept all night now she's calling me back she won't talk to my wife she wants to stop speak to Pastor Coleman I'm not her pastor she wants a private ministry now and she won't talk sister comb it all and tried to even or disguise herself so my wife won't know when I was in prayer last night thank God she'll not the word if I was given a message you see but people want to or private something private you know so you know so now we come back to Calvary and we have to be broken in repentance and confession and then God comes down by the Holy Spirit and looks into our hearts to see if we have confess that sin and in the moment we confess it he has a picture of the water of life and He pours it into it into your hearts and why you're there repenting and crying and confessing something fills you up it's the water of life and you feel wonderful and you get up menu in love everybody you feel like a fool for just said or what you did then you see the brother-sister here you go kissing and hugging and carrying on Amy Sidda me he pause this picture for only if you are confess now if he just say I'm sorry but you still dry Sunaina a real broken confession fills up to heart praise God and we go away praising God and rejoicing in order for with his new life see this is revival then you be revived by the world day by day and the others who were the thrill-seekers Dakar : those who seek it after some great emotional experience and waiting for it or missing their life being poured out day by day and they don't know in the message gathering out and great players are waiting for a brief supernatural manifestation of something that they there was nothing about and brother president God where comes at your humble way will come with a picture of water of life and walk in and ask you to put out your cup and those who come on list here and put out their cups and see they are needy I don't say my cup is filled already I'm rich and so forth and so on well those who say they're not filled and have a need he pours into the cup and knowing sir I had to seize him praise the Lord this is revival fill what the word loving others concerned for others welfare and for others salvation see no struggling no Terry nurse chiming no getting upset just simply giving him each sin to cleanse in his precious blood see and accept it from him the free gift of his love of his fullness excuse me people wanted today what's going on what's going on what's going on a message of faith and deliverance come grab new in the layout see in church he said in the letter to this church age we are blind wretched miserable poor and naked and don't know it but as many as I love only those two I rebuke and chasten only the movie will know the rest of Maine will receive it see so then our take the word to come to give us faith and when the word gives us faith and we take the word and confess our sins and He pours life into us then the principles of daily living can flow into us then we allowing him to do the work Eunice now watch trying to bring out a point this Mormons taking my time see the son of man is it has been doing a hidden work those who have the cups out he's been filming it daily what is unspectacular it's not the flesh want to see something it's just daily living that's all it is just going along soon and he's working with them in the evening time see and they're willing to let him fill up their cups and walk with Him and those who are their cups are running over right now this morning they live in like sheep they're doing things in here natural things that's exactly why some get mad about these little things that the law allows to have in here among the sisters and so for their brothers little birthday things and so forth like I said those just don't worry about it don't have no ideas about it many in here right now it's more than ever ideas about those things you don't even know even talking about shouldn't do that because God knows he's only trying to let you live normal doctor told you you oughta life get married have your children hurt your potatoes buy a home you are approved I had the tapes approved to that the planner gave birthday gifts I can feel that they all have to whether you believe it and we cannot excited about or you'll give a gift for this one but you'll give it because because for that one I know those spirits in here should be washed from that shame on you praise God it's the Christian life see the heaven with their hearts overflowing bow in the neck bow it over welcome with him all the time constantly trusting the blood the blood is in the word and when the bloody word is preached and we receive it and repent their confession then we are cleansed there is no they can't get that they nothing or something there's no other way constantly trusting the blood but this trust the blood [Music] just because he said it so that's how I'm living today me as a preacher a minister here I'm living by three I haven't prayed enough I haven't read the will of God enough I haven't read the tapes enough but the life that I'm still appears by faith in the Son of God with a can all kind of the mayors and everything else is because just pouring in here what can I do just keep walking their song see a man is earned it's constant there is nothing spectacular about this and the the carnal man or the a carnal sight rather please pass eight years see no great emotional experiences to seek after and wait for no great ministries and great excitement going on great happenings because light throughout the week got it a revival going and well the salsas coming in and saw what we had all that somebody got a little mixed up right the great happenings and so forth it's not that got a in the fire here in the whirlwind a man he knew an earthquake is in his word the still small voice the unspectacular wait of God Jesus with him how many today no understand at the same Jesus Christ they've left in the first and a body called Jesus came down is again and walked in a practical way around a message though brutal death and that miss has been preached here by His grace for each years and if coming going on you know what it is that same other words if you could visualize our pre to God you came visualizing or what does the appreciate why as Jesus Christ in himself that's his word nothing else other than his word [Applause] because you want to see the room be removed did it belong here the world may be receiving us receiving breath he breathed on him and government expectation tell you what Jesus standing at

things you ain't never seen Jesus praise God what is it brother Coleman just plain day-to-day living the life the Lord intended for each one else to live God before the foundation of the world intended that I should be here in New York City have a family and I should have a son born of 68 - because have a home had become move over there just bury going away that's all it is so maker running out of thought so much about New York way-hey all that happening here with is not this plain daily living day by day the thrill seekers get all shook up and they go out here cursing you because they don't see a spectacular going on and it is spectacular they don't before Christ living in us me as turns me as a dmoz L can't even praise God but don't be fooled oh Christ living in you what you don't

bit I'm not no I'm dead I'm trying to save myself I think up at 4 o'clock in the morning go to work because for this morning and for years they won at 4:00 next morning I'm dead there's not all right Christ living in me moving me Oh give me strength comfort to keep me day by day free so God I want you to do something in New York do what we can't do anything he does it some expect to see brother Martin Mary every night on a telephone or come to our house and sit down and talk hey talking is living kind of talk we talk to people for years and there's still what we're talking about it's a revelation between you and Jesus cuts you know talkin pastor Coleman she want me to talk from tired talking fresca if a sister wants to bypass my wife and talk to me because all you understand brother Coleman I know right away when she insults or ignores my wife to get around her some kind of wait what kind of spiritual former so I use my wife to test it when I see you don't come there where I'm going amen absolutely right if my wife who was her sister Christ you don't want her fellowship sure want mine cuz I ain't giving it you read about the Word of God nothing but attention-seeking do something for me spirit look at me keep steering something I want to see Jesus it's only one way you come to G I ain't got nothing to give you about Jesus Christ there is only one to come to Christ so if you come here you all ship up and Justin happen the way you want to happen I I will see you in the week I'm going home I'm trying the best I can to live this life and do what I got to do that's the great secret of the highway now the grace to go to highway is knowing what to do with sin when sin comes in you see people how are they overcoming like that they know what to do with sin they refuse to let the devil take them to Mount Sinai and they're Tormentum torment you did this hey you said you won't do that you didn't do it there's a devil somebody will give you a negative Nelly an American Samara coming your help and your house is spying you out in there's a devil that's right tap against you everything else are looking for sniff around looking for dirt or something and they don't even know coming here sniffing looking around there right brother well they're looking for amen praise God the Greeks said we would see Jesus they look for anything up of Jesus we would see Jesus nothing else shall suffice as we would seek Jesus praise our God so the secret is know what to do with sin when sin comes in and it does every moment that they sin comes in don't you think that you're gonna overcome by yourself you will not there's only one way you've seen this year the Holy Spirit been coming down every week on the same thing the secret is always to take that Center Calvary not Mount Sinai get all shook up and everything and so forth and so on if you're trying to do it brother I feel sorry for you no sir it will not work take the secrets that takes in to the cross and see there is sinfulness and put it under the blood go to God go to the cross the word and the lancet that's in my daughter that's in my son oh thank you lord he said we'll put under the blood confess your sin and believe in your heart don't take it to become Mount Sinai you will be condemned all day long and when job's friends get a hold of you I feel sorry for you they'll tear you up jokes friends you don't tell the phone everything else see amen praise God the only thing that comes between us and one another such as resentment Envy impatient the patients jealousy the come between you and I that comes between you and God because God sent me see the competition is between you and God love ye one another John Clare lovey one another when he was leaving here little children and right well God is in you now these barriers and they are here or sometimes no more the little veils you can see through a veil can't you alright you can still see a little bit a little blurred but you can see through it but if you don't remove it immediately thus in unbelief whatever is resentment jealousy and so forth its thickens into a blanket you don't get it back there a brick wall comes up see and then you shut off from from fellowship with God and your brother and sister and easy people shut into themselves trying to do it themselves try and do it themselves you gotta let go let God amen now the effect of these sends them to us is to make us walk in darkness cover up and hide what we really are see and what we're really feeling see and that is the meaning of darkness so my warm up to you and know they are jealous or resentful that's darkness but they say praise the law they're hiding impersonating it's not real and brother you know it deep down into their souls and they know what you know it and look at you anyway how I love you they don't in Lyon they know it and they know what you know in Lyon everyone most of all he knows it so darkness hides sin and light like this morning reveals sin now how many are willing to come to the light see otherwise we're just pretending for the past eight years wearing a mask see this is a highway life this life is quite unspectacular no new doctrine people looking for a new doctrine Eve was - it's the worried say Jesus Christ he coming to us the phone Murray come back at the letter informing together same Jesus it's just a life to live day by day listen and whatever circumstances the Lord has put us hey man and if God did not put you in New York City you will never be happy in New York City because God put all of us here is in our nature and they come here in curses brother come up from the propionate one Thomas said this is distinct in this this is the most ungodly and all kind of things he said right here on Wednesday night the call you know you know he curses here regards people but is God sees nothing spectacular going on see no great happenings all doing the weekend great things going on see see you'll be miserable here you're looking for that see in committee even curse New York curse the passes and the people here and everything see say nothing here I don't see nothing telling me something about what's going on me or I don't see nothing say they say it all the time you know that see it is not i but it's Christ liveth in me and the life that I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who gave his life for me himself now we're here in New York with tired weary as Paul said here we are troubled on every side yet not distressed a man other words he said are we a hard press but are we not suffocated amen he's talking here about a rest man Matt you you know that's right we are perplexed but not in despair in other ways we are puzzled but not properly baffled the devil get our certain lock on your home become a wrestling match you're kind of trying to take it out but you're not because in despair or baffled just wait and fool around a little bit and unlock it a man for his garb but he is in you right now as he is in you he's in the world he came back but he can't perplex us the world Satan knew 24 so with perplexity Mims house fearful fear not us we may be a little baffle a little bit for a season but we got a message bro and if we all are perplexed just come to the word and there are the sweetness we're bathed down in the Holy Ghost is that all that's what that meant last year praise the Lord we also have a foot race here he says here pursued but not caught or outrun that's right persecuted but not forsaken a persecutor right now if you're persecuting you it's a foot race and the only song I'll beat that they'll run and I'm so glad that ran we've beaten them running we running straight brother we running straight into the resurrection and we want to get there before him because he fell before he got there Judas amen praise go amen we in a prizefight cast down but not destroyed struck down a man but yet not out of the fight Joe Fraser not the are chemically got right up from the floor at the devil knock you down with a punch lay it down therefore you've been conditioned you had a road working so forth you've been taking the punches in the gym well get up lay on the wall around in there and so pity the devil did this here him so he'll brother BAM toy yeah he's got a whack at you he's got a good shot at you keep it covered feint it move see give some footwork if you happen to a man jab him stick him poke him keep moving as a man said this thing like of being float like a butterfly praise God struck down amen but not out of the fight see he had been a natural illustration but people who see that amen praise the Lord see always bearing about the dying of the Lord in the body enclosing the principle of the cross friends is in the very nature of God self given love self-sacrificing there was at the cross there was the cross at the dawn of history when the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world when the styie the lamb was slain from the foundation of world there was the cross there was the cross when he who was rich became poor for us that was a cross there was a court at the manger another cross when he left his earthly home he had nowhere to lay his head the foxes have holding the birds have nests son of man hath not where to lay his head that was a cross training hands he administering for cross mount temptation but another cross a point engine does supreme cross the course was when he gave His life because for us was the word of the Cross and the mystery of that way and a secret revealed to the elective ones is both Alpha and Omega of the disciples way Jesus our beginning and our end and there's your secret don't look for anything else other than Jesus see now in closing the word of the Cross has three aspects as sinners number one we see and receive Christ crucified as our substitute another went to the across for to be an effigy for us and he stood in our stead and died for us we might have forgiveness of sins excuse me justification regeneration and cleansing from guilt he took our place that's one aspect of the cross and many have stated right there they never left there they just right there just praising God for that there's a second aspect many of you know that way is clearly out of the scriptures and realized and experience of all who born with God see in st. Matthew 16:24 look I'll read it the reason on this wise 16:24 speaking here to Peter then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the lord this shall not be underneath when Christ had told Peter because he had to suffer the son of may had to suffer the flesh of Peter didn't want no suffering no what are you gonna suffer for when his Messiah was that his king was there and he was the Lord of all and all he had to do was to live right there in Israel and it had everything he wanted and he took my suffering you want no suffering the flesh you see but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but that but those that be of men then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me he said three things here if any man will come after this coming to the cross let him deny himself that's just a speck right here number two deny yourself and then all those who go on with God they have to they realize that they have to deny themselves and this church and people in this message have been denying them sell these past eight years being identified with Christ on the cross now we couldn't be identified a cross with Christ on the cross and an actual overcoming experience back in 1906 because he hadn't said two words yet we could just by faith and because I feel like praying in a having wonderful meetings and so forth and in the gifts and so forth and try to overcome daily but in 1963 he sent the way how to do it a message so then we saw it and I also knowing it and we come to the cross and there we are on the cross this is the second aspect and here we deny ourselves and that's what's going on right now and then the third phase is uh let him take up his cross and follow me now we all talk about ministries and what not will be I come through this here first denying ourselves see so therefore is clearly laid out here it is commonly called our identification with Christ's cross it's the Malachi 4 message the Christian sees that he has come to the cross but is himself not only that it come to the cross but he himself is on the cross see for Christ died in my place then God sees me there in the sight of God I'm on the cross see and pause summed it up by saying I am crucified with Christ that's what he meant see now when to knowledge to the seven seals is added eager appropriation adding to your faith see going on because like now then the dying of the old man see and the rising of the new man in Christ becomes a permanent and with experience like now saying to the soul and it conforms the outside body to Christ way of life and it's so natural and homeless simple and that they don't know what's going on see and this is also called applying the token there's no because term for it is the turning of the wheat from a green to a going brown it's the eagle baby eagle waiting of high up on the cliff as mother feeds him and he waits about five years old and it's time for him to seek a mate and time for him to go off and fly on his own it's all of these things waiting on the Lord but denying himself waiting on God it is simple daily living day-to-day in circumstances precious of God's choosing see or was what is transpired here in New York City it's been God's choosing it's too simple is too humble people don't see nothing going on all right God wanted us to do is to do what you're doing there believe him that's all see now the third aspect of the cross when you pick it up and you fall out to him but he gotta tell you to do it yeah I mean I don't know if anybody outside of William Brennan the prophet stare out seven angels go back to justice bill Indiana all right Becky come and took up this cross and GOST I'll never leave you nor forsake you praise God now this third aspect the third in the final stage and this upward rudder climb to the summit only a few elective ones Christ very brethren take this vigorous ascent up the mountain many fall off weary time Oh speak plain this morning many of tired weary or they're awesome voices call them off of the highway and they fell off into a swamp over there and another glare somewhere and so forth and they don't know what's going on but there are a few chosen ones that's walking the highway they have a secret they know that that that they are Nate by nature they are sinners so therefore they don't get all upset then they know that whatever is flesh is flesh and what a spirit is spirit they know that they cannot make this flesh over can't do it and the others are struggling and trying to make the flesh over I am good you are not good it is the blood of Jesus Christ but the ones with a revelation they recognize is nothing good in me but is the blood of Jesus Christ and they are the overcome by the blood over the elective ones after they have denounced up these past eight years of Seoul try to die out every thought every eye there and let life come into them there's an elected few who already know to say come in God's sight they're ripened they all mature when the little babies come jiggin and Jagan with resentment and anger and jealousy they don't get man pray for the sidestep it and keep moving say praise the Lord it is the way of the Cross listen for others or what we would say were Redemption it is the law of the spiritual harvest I must say sometime will finish all right hip discipline our the first two aspects come into the cross for salvation and going on the cross to partake of Christ's passion for ourselves like we're doing now we are partaking for ourselves the second aspect here see but the third that's when you're completely dead and you were just stay and it's for the others the third is for others see we all know we push in a third pole we in it we all I don't know about what will come forth out of it will be God in flesh we all know that we've been told Adam the tapes everything away that is that's the message supremely it was seen in Jesus Christ for others he went for from his baptism and his anointing to walk this way for others for others he died daily to his loved ones his home his normal enjoyments he died daily for what for others for others he laid down his life for himself no for others and he did this to fulfill the law or the spiritual harvest now watch it was anuses necessity in closer here's why airman Eve man had died in the Spirit of God then right they were mentioned God's image and his likeness with the Holy Spirit and when they received the because of the unbelief come in and they said they died in the spirit the holy spirit left sing and their natural spirit was they of course see and they died in the Spirit of God and the kingdom of heaven and come alive in the flesh to Satan in the kingdom of Hell think on it and they were and in type it had to be a sacrifice an atonement for them which was the Lamb and for us today they had to be a savior and a pioneer had to be found and that was Jesus Christ he was the one the captain of our salvation who could and would die listen to the kingdom of Hell as fallen man substitute and rise again to the kingdom of heaven for fallen man see and thus become what the seed corn which by his death produces that one hundred full of life-giving sea just one hundred full of life-giving substance not for itself but for those who feed on it this is the rough part here just don't get it with this joy set before him appreciating away the joy of the harvest because we approaching it now and you got to know it the joy of a mother who cha fails not for herself for that little bundle of life the joy of the bride who travails these past eight years worry and trouble and persecution of whatnot now for self to bring forth Jesus that right that Jesus would be the seed corn that others will feed on Jesus in the Brian not for herself because when she met Jesus back in 63 she knew she had turned her life hey man she knew it see her since was forgiven she knew that but that she'd read our that she was a body and he was the head so therefore she didn't realize that she would have to say come this means x millions around the world of waiting and hungry right now well that bride to come forth and she will come forth yes sir there's only gonna be a few see the joy the harvests the motherhood but travails the bride likewise for the joy he endured across and despised the shame that goes with it how many we've had to stand here say come over here that is okay you don't have it there see it's a cross and they don't understand it but we endure that despised the shame that goes along with it see I don't see no shame in it but because some things so something we are ridiculous stand up here what are you doing you ain't doing nothing once you go over here or do this here you've got a great ministry and so forth and so on see but in his footsteps fall out the first member of the church that's right they sought a fourth touch of Christian living to consist of Milly of not giving or enjoying his passion but given out to others and there went to early church members and that was D in the book of Acts so then death worketh in US but life in others praise God the early church Paul Timothy arenas Polly Clark Luthor Wesley right down to our time and Supreme me again and William Brennan and what and all you heard the story when he was sent there buddy a campfire and Billy Paul Anson that he should pray for himself he says Paul it's not for me it's for others that's the word what he said it's not for me he said Jesus is not for me Paul says not for me it's for you if we could ever get that man in here brother you see a power of God he told that to him that day at Calvary in closing page 19 he's speaking here but the doing the greater works now notice the great works that that's to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer casts out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers there is your greater works the Holy Ghost is coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life that's what Calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into the place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers man who were once unbelievers be may believe was an impart spiritual eternal life poor blind Richard people how do you missed it don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen it was to impart eternal life to the people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a son of God can know do you understand no do you see what has been transpiring a local christening for nine years giving out the greatest thing ever eternal life by the Word of God I am come to Malachi 4 that you might have let it be now abundantly I open a place in New York City I'll give it the rubbish to pour life more abundantly many will come against it and many would have against it they don't know that eternal life is being imparted no greater thing greater than healing of the body greater in size and one day greater than all these things is eternal life and they sit right in here and don't even know what's going on what could I tell you this morning praise God brother Perez knows all about it you ask him you tell you what it is the original corner we came back again in william branham to die out in the prophet's flesh Prophet died out Christ was in his flesh and by his death william branham spiritual death in the flesh he produced one hundredfold a corn of wheat and corn wheat was prepared every because kernel were was just right and in 1966 it was ready cone of wheat amen and then we saw it and then we want to go oh my god so we went to the cross to deny ourselves sixty five six seven eight nine seventy seventy one denying ourselves well if you want to follow me take up your cross and come after me only a few do that the elected ones in the beginning the early church they did it Iranians in Paulo call from Paul and Timothy and Barnabas and so forth and William Graham down in the last days he did it but with those God walks with them and they're dying they have to receive the insults they're resistant the jealousy the people the demons coming and so forth but they're dying when love projects for these people better devil grace takes over for brother Perez tell you about it won't love Jesus Christ the word the message by our spiritual revelation you see it in to your flesh and the person and people come against you all ideas and this you're wrong you say you did this wrong I'm not wrong and you say yes brother you're home with yourself and grace takes over for them do you hear what I'm saying that's right it'll be worse for a millstone to be hung on your neck to say anything and guess the least of mine to do anything because against them but they recognize they want to give out eternal life so they die to themselves they won't fight against you that you might be saved so when you come with your accusations and your mean sayings and so forth the real seat of God will die in the flesh and die a spiritual death like the early church did Stephen did stood there he died his head right you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in the heart and there the glory of God came upon him and they saw that countenance of God made bidam they were so jealous you wait what I happen all over again the Prophet said the bride will be repudiated she's even feeling the pangs of it has been feeling to pass eight years that's right friends you don't do these things because there's a spirit here in America to go out to the islands Trinidad and Africa poor little brown and black people they feel so wonderful to because give them something and for the little black one I feel so good when I do something for them or little brown ones and yellow ones and so forth that ain't nothing but a hypocrite do it because Jesus Christ is in you live in our life not because you feel good doing for little black ones and yellow ones and so forth do it because Christ Jesus Christ is in you you ought to hear some of these ministers talking when they go down there to turn their thinking though people because our fools down there the brothers come and tell brother Hyundai and Jamaica place his legs head and he they're going down there all puffed up sweaty doing some tell him how I supposed to sing and telling what this Bulls are doing so forth now the Prophet said you got to do this here just for your kness way off and the people just humbled they don't say nothing see but we got a line into him praise God see the man that's our spirit in America here apps I'm telling you absolutely is an unclean spirit at the puffed up a selfish spirit that's what it is you might as well know what you know what it is when you do something don't do it some people feel good if they could do some fourth day the underprivileged the rich may ask what he feels self righteous spirit he comes down into Harlem in different places once a year because he has a banquet or a ball or something like that and give the a proceeds and so forth he feels wonderful it feels washed and cleansed I did something for the poor needy underprivileged or Christian doesn't because he's got a Christ in him no matter what they look like who they are that's right lovely lovely that's right the crippled all messed up ones love them how many of them want to go to them see the greater works important the eternal life and then through the preaching of the word hearing of the tapes and so forth then the Christian man or woman himself dining out to their own desires dying out to their own over lust over desires see and this dying out that the others might see Jesus Christ it's very humble many have come and testified that they see of what a life so all it supposed to be that is too humble that is too simple our life walked the earth in the first Jesus and they saw it but they wouldn't join to it nothing same thing today the preaching on the word is so humble and simple just daily living circumstances happening they could believe God and whatever it is because God heal your whatever is it that this simple ain't nobody getting any glory out of there well great ministries and so forth see unspectacular no great emotional experiences brother : and brother hon heaven out a great meeting and everybody is coming up in the angel Lord is flying down through here and so forth come on up brother send out telegrams and so forth spectacular no rebuking correction instruction in the waves of righteousness that and casting out Devils every time the word is preached spirits up on people that the principle the kingdom of God might flow and now the others come and they feel our life something strange the women that's just as look right hmm brothers look right some life that's all it is but how didn't you don't have to just live a life their soul just plain everyday living day-to-day that's all it is just doing right being current as your heavenly father this connie gives a son to the good and evil reign to the just and the unjust all right raise a lot and you'd be good to them outside also as your father see now praise God we're gonna close out denying ourselves to have one one thing else here to say now dying out to these normal advantages in the flesh comforts loved ones material because advantages in large income and pleasures and Michael easier gives me a right to claim and to receive the harvest in the spirit what is the harvest or the produce or the fruit of the Spirit there's one fruit of the Spirit that one fruit is love peace joy temperate and so forth when I down in the flesh voluntarily on the cross then the law of the spirit as Christ did see the seed of corn see then that laws the law then I've got to risk if I burn the flesh then the life of Christ must be in my mortal body and then it was not for me it's for others hey man I want to get all my ministry and Here I am so humble and I cast our building all sir it's for others it'll be so humble and simple is going on right now and don't even know it see it's the way of the harvest friends do you love them praise God well when as I was saying one time that when we have our trials tribulations and so forth and they come we can resist it as a Gatecrasher as I want to said or welcome it as a friend these trials with corresponding destructive or constructive effect if I don't welcome what God sends I will destroy myself and frustration and striving and worry and everything else but if I reckon it is for my construction it is to edify to build me up if I welcome this little unwelcome gate pressure the one that want to come into and change your daily living how you have all lined out you go out of the house something happens BAM your plans will smash the brother way the phone rings this happens that happens see now by the practice or the principle the cross losses trials whether unsought or delivery chosen become positive weapons of offense against the devil so you and it's the only thing it's what is now when love projects grace takes over and God uses people to because a shuckers down you understand it well the corner wheat friends we all know it's right we see it the a chaff is ripe also dry it out we either one of the other see and if there is a corn of wheat then the corn we must fall in the ground of the Word of God whatever God sins if you are corn wheat you'll fall into the ground and what will come up out of the ground will be for others and we're home a lot of salesmen will die because we want to go into the third stage as we would say just as all one actually well this is a time when we've been able by the grace of God to see it even and out and see what it is up to this time we see through a glass darkly but when the Prophet come he landed out to us we saw it we see it now see and we see what it is coming to the cross going on the cross and then picking up your cross and going out for others or world Redemption and I believe that we have come down to that point now and that's where we are resting now do you believe that friends I believe that the times are so terrible people sick weary worn out and yet God has been great in our midst here he's been moving right through here and doing signs to me and wonders why brother Perez a man had a stroke my own father had a stroke and he in a profit on the restoration of bride Sheree said he was healed thus saith the Lord but he has not received it all the way yet his unbelief that's right my mother knows she's sick this morning where he worn out from his unbelief he refuses to believe that he's altogether heal brother Perez he accepted his and the Prophet said that's thus saith the Lord for my father but he ain't never received it yet never believed it yet unbelief will kill you friends I say to you in the name of the Lord believe God and you shall prosper don't try to figure out what is going on here you just believe God see you just believe them and go on don't try to order your life your way many people I'm gonna talk to your plane now people come to the Lord and then they say well Lord I'm gonna do this for you all I'm gonna do that for you maybe uh if it's a brother he with because you won't have a wife or sister she don't want a husband or so whatever it is I mean you can't you have to ask what is God's will in the matter Lord let that will be done for my life while we have husband and wives here and we have single people and we have because young people old people and every one of them they are having a struggle in the trial so it's not because you're single or not because you're married see is God but the thing you do is to seek God's will for your life some are get married and fly out there wasn't what it was supposed to be and they old man that's right I'm tell you the truth and they are having a horrible time now and the devil won't even tell them that their husband now is not the man for them but he'll get one over there in a minute kingdom up because she'll get one over there well then she'd disbelieves the very thing as she believed in beginning and she went back on God's Word she believed she loved that man she wanted man in spite of all where's your faith now just because you got a few trials and got shook around a little bit you don't want to believe for salvation just before the light it gets very dark hold on sisters hold on brothers were your wives just before the light brother Ram told you darkness moves in but the morning star comes out to shine just before the light and now Jesus Christ how he's manifesting himself in this assembly here through brother Perez here taking the man to the very gates and bring them back here showing that he's with you showing his signs showing us one two showing his mercy and what do we have to put our heads down for Jesus Christ and I miss important eternal life eternal life the word being given out now there will be our witness of that oh yeah it'll be too late receive eternal life now see God would give a witness of it oh yeah it was show as he said great signs and wonders sure but brother you come in now don't wait until then amen we lied we wanna change some things [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
