TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'd like to do a little little trio of one assist a Coleman's favorite songs actually she used to sing it in church and maybe she should come to sing home would you like to sing a song here you drive come on sister : I'm sure the peoples would love to hear you sing [Music] he never fed me he never [Music] Jesus Christ never [Music] Jesus never fair [Applause] [Applause] to know Jesus Christ [Music] the Jesus Christ never [Music] to know that Jesus Russ never well say it again [Music] oh geez [Music] [Music] can he never fare he's never Jesus Christ green never fan [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] - : singing [Music] how many would like to hear testify and what could I say about Italian band man praise God yes assistance in Tacoma and I favorite is when reason there's something there with the Italian band because when we first came up we was all together and they formed they helped form the local Christian assembly along with brother Ben sister Nadine the Whitaker's of course the the Hunts and and and Ben and brother hunt and then Sylvia : Ortiz sister elm and all the different ones so we've been down a long road way long road and a strange thing before we left a penny costs my mother had a dream in the end of 1960 or 61 just before we came to the message in nineteen may in 1961 she had a dream that my sister Coleman was worshiping with these white sisters and they all had long hair and we didn't have the faintest idea of what kind of dream that was as I look around here I see the dream has come to pants and then so we didn't know you know and so you don't know the footstep of the righteous older the Lord so the main thing I know is that April the 9th I was baptized into the kingdom of God I know anything about the message but I was born again and received the Holy Ghost and I thank God just a few months later sister Coleman likewise was baptized with the Holy Ghost also and not knowing that down the road did you want to need a wife like that in order to Pastor a church and so the Lord has been really good to us down 30 years and given us a lovely beautiful family and sons and laws and beautiful grandchildren so we have so much to thank the Lord for I tell you it's good to serve the Lord I believe that a man praise God amen praise God so I could think of so many you know blessings down the road mm aha when we went down to Jeffersonville 1961 i I just we knew that we had to we had a special job to do in other words and so and I don't know brethren but the way I feel that my wife is my queen so how you feel about it but says you know properties 31 who could find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him a good and not evil all the days of her life and I can truly testify today that mr. Coleman has done me good all the days of our lives amen so I thank the Lord amen for her she's means more than a wife to me she's my friend she's my buddy amen I remember going down to the tabernacle and I always wanted to make sure that that she look right and looked good amen my two brothers but I can see my wife looking the best she can likes you're looking beautiful amen and I could say she is walking down this tree hey man so that's that's where I met her you know coming by us ain't she sweet walking down the street so anyway you know I like to get around a little bit you know me and so amen and I remember once an edict I was following well I was the artist for a department health and 125 word Street she worked across the street in motor vehicle building New York State and so then I would see where she would go and Neelix and then she be eating and then she'd look up out of wink that wink was devastating I knew that we had her she could not get away from that wing it was powerful so then I decided to play a little game and someone find out I'll let her think she's going alone on Chambers Street there was another Bank interest if you worked downtown you know I'm talking about so I went down the back entrance and I would bump into ana middle of the station Oh fancy meeting you here no it's all planned of course predestinated and she put a nickel in that old before and the nickel fell I was just so nervous you know I said don't worry honey try my nickel it's all right so anyway we had beautiful times together and I thank the Lord for it you know and I always want to see her looking good and I should go buy things myself and she loved that haven't been able to do that much in recent years you know it's been in you know then I memoir I Rebecca Smith Brandon Smith but you should tell her that it's just a brand I'm just a comment on the way she dressed and the way she carried herself and that meant a lot to me Amen so that's why brethren you know that's why you should love your wives and make sure that they look like Queens that is your queen amen there's nothing that I wouldn't give her if I had it I give it to her amen it's got appreciate her because when I met her it was just more than physical attraction however it was her spirit and she has a beautiful spirit she loves people and people never forget her we were just taking treatments over in a in a medical center those old woman there that was taking care of a husband he was like his half dead and she was feeding them and taking here my wife couldn't resist the temptation to go over and say something good to her and one was so blessed and I thought we were praying for you and just that you but your husband make it through so it's things like this that really bless me with her you know as we went down the road together and then I and we thank God that we had experiences together like when she came back from Tucson she had such a burden on a hole on a horse you could understand why where the people sold rye and didn't and she came back and and then Oh Lord she landed in February 6 1974 and the Lord spoke to her and said boomed out they are preaching six seals well inside of a heart came a revelation but you have been feasting on the hidden manna under the Seventh Seal now that was in 1974 before they were Thunder to us you see and that was coming down from Joseph perfection the foundation and a lot of people they don't know what or what actually I'm doing or saying but the foundation was Joseph's perfection and that's when the prophet of God on June 14th says god bless you brother Coleman I was looking for you and brother on the inside to call you out on the outlaw and in five months later he did and he gave me an understanding of what brother Aaron was preaching while he was preaching it can we say Amen Italian band they all know it I was preaching Joseph perfection and then 5:00 a.m. December 26 I formed by the LIA fáil by the Peregrine I wasn't in Yuma I said what did what was the Nugget what was the bomb well bill you know leave bill well bill said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and I asked for the period same thing that's oh my god the Lord has already descended what is young and so they didn't seem to know it so I just he said now go into pulpit and give the report about brother branham's a accident and his passing away and then tell the people all right lift up your head to get up from there the shout of the Kings in the camp and that's where we've been all set all the time we've been to we'd never stopped you know so I thank God for that and see this is my testimony you know so people have things that they say and whatever they well that's their business and had them do it me at all you know I'm a Christian because God saved me a man not only there's a man on the face of the earth that I cannot forgive sorry if if it was then I could not have broadly kindness for that know when he would not be there and so I thank God for that revelation of somehow compassion that's what it's all about forgiveness because faith is based on forgiveness so I thank God for that and you got to live it and you got to teach it oh you can make mistakes and you can have the things can happen and get out of sorts with a brother but that's that happens because we are all in the natural and that will happen brother Graham said you will make mistakes but the test is can you forgive that will always be the test otherwise you have any father could have to give you so I thank the Lord and then down through the years as we came down a 1972 experience ahead I wanted to express to my wife ha really loved her and now mailman's coming down the hill and God actually spoke to me and told me go home and tell her the these words and went home in November 1972 and told right straight from heaven a while I loved her and how I loved her and so I couldn't remember although I'll try to write it down and so I know that God put us together before the foundation the world and I know that I'm very proud of her and so I'm salute her today she's been a real wife and real mother and many times she was sick and weary she'd never complain about anything and then I thank God when seven thunders was revealed they don't mind you brethren anybody could have picked up the tapes and her heard and also read the books they laid there from 1965 to 1974 nobody said Thunder so that's my testimony the Lord told me or what they were and then that's what I had to stand for some people say well you say thunder too much and so forth and so on well that's what you say but you see but brother Branham laid out a seed a seven Thunder seed and therefore you have to say what it is otherwise we're going to come down to the harvest time because what do you want to get if you don't you didn't plant a seed so therefore they just saw on tears I'll reap in joy so we thank God for that and so anyway as we come down here now and I remember my 1962 we went in to see brother Branham and there was brother hunt sister hunt myself my wife it's just Alma Lauren's mother and we went in to see him and then my wife had a message from sister Millie for Shetty and she's down in Florida now and she knew the branham's and she's to tell brother Brown that I love him so much that I want to pull him into myself and so sister sister Mita was there in the study so my wife repeated that to brother Burnham and brother Branham told my wife he says just to Coleman I love me too so much that I want to pull her into me so that we may be one and so we never forgot those words you know that's why I always tell the husbands love your wives that's what the Prophet told us personally amen so I thank God to have a wife like sister Coleman and she doesn't say nothing but she did something yesterday that she doesn't know you haven't told yet and we having lunch in the Lord spoke to me and I've been waiting for months for to hear from God concerning just season right now and the Lord spoke to me and said go over see if he's finished lunch I want to speak to you and then but her the sushi got on right now and I won't thank the lord for sister iris she isn't here right now but she's been a real real help to her and others here at the choline and and different ones there but sister iris been taken around because I can't can't get around so my wife said no I'll call sister iris I still don't know how there's alcohol before I studied but I knew that the Lord said go upstairs you know she insisted and I so okay you know but I will do it you know so she went on and did a couple of things and when she went out then that's when the Lord spoke to me so you know you don't know that but when you went you insisted but that was a God making you insist so that he could speak to me and so I don't like splendid today but a burden is lifted from me I know I'm gonna be healed I normally be well amen praise God let's it be the name of the Lord I know all is well amen and I know that in here you're gonna be sealed and refill I know that the third phase is here and tomorrow we will show you the ending of the second phase so I praise God for that and anyway so as we say I'm saluting her today in honor of her birthday and I have something I want to give her after because I found a virtuous woman and her price is far above rubies so I have a little keepsake for her and she will remember me at this short little message that's left before we go to resurrection amen so anyway that is I want to thank all you for being in a day has been a day today we won't forget a man had made a law to richly bless each every one of you and give you a safe trip I just back home and just shared their brother hundred sit-downs not here amen so now I believe that some Eddie you want to I have some things that you want to present whatever this is the common language you come over here yes Oh well first I want to say uh I could never I don't ever remember meeting sister Coleman she was just always there she's like my mom she's timeless and um she she's very special to me and to my wife and to all the Deacons and their wives she has given of herself unselfish and as it were her life is very public and everyone sees when she's going through a trial or she's not well she's not feeling well and yet she greets you with this beautiful smile always and you could see that it's it's just God in her so sister Coleman may the Lord always shine in your heart as you shine in arts from the Deacons rushers and and their wives hold on what do you care beautiful wax with diamonds [Applause] feel like I died and went to heaven I got a die I know but no no she told me I want you to buy me something I did say that first years ago we always help but I did drop it off I said you know Joe I just lost you too barb oh yes he did my diamond look at this heart of diamonds far above rubies I just want to say that I love every single one of you in here every one of you means something special to me and I'm so happy to be with you all and I know that one day we're gonna take that flight all together we're not leaving one and I know we all feel the same way if we could help each other we're right there but by his grace and by his strength and of course you know how I feel about this man we've been through the waters we've been through the flood has been through the fire but God knows we made it by the grace of God because we we love Jesus and we always depend on him we don't depend on ourselves otherwise we never make it you know but he's the greatest you know [Applause] he's a very good person he's been wonderful to me I have no complaints at all he probably has a sum for me but I don't complain I have nice and I'm happy with my family I love them all and Christopher and all the children my grandchildren and I'm I'm just a happy person right now I'm getting older but I feel I have my fans in the audience but anyway I don't
