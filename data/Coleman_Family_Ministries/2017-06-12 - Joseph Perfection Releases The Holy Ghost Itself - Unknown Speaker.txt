recap here this Open Door age here all right is uh you see that little arrow pointing there do you see a red ribbon coming from the open door age going right through filthy leosia and right on into the seven rainbows missed the whole thing oh thank you you Jesus praise done miss the whole denominational setup praise God so let's I hope about maybe I can do it in about 10 15 minutes and get to my message here okay uh for a few moments here I'm going to just read from Philadelphia Church age uh page if you're writing it down page 389 amen be good for y'all for you to go back through there okay this is found in Revelation the philad in church age if you want to pick it up from the Bible it's there Revelation 3 uh 7 through 13 that's where I I be quoting from amen okay I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou H has a little strength has kept my word and has not denied my name now watch the time coming next now after the great missionary move that swept across the nations of Brotherly Love to take what they had nothing against it of literature and whatever more into the different parts of the world now the church denomination had gone back to Education Works again see going back and that's what he ends up in lay out of sea works again after the great denomination had been set up Jesus set an Open Door see it there after the westlan age it already was a Methodist Church and he had long gone and died amen they settled down in there Campbell and uh the one Smith started the Baptist and all them in there UPC come all these denominations Amen in the wesan age see and after the wesan age had come in and the Methodist Church had been establishing the Earth taking Roots growing making a great church which it is today one of the greatest among the Protestant churches and that time the thing that took place then was Jesus set an open door to the church before before they entered into the leoan age praise God Amen cuz the word was already written that the leoan was going to be blind wretched miserable pooring naked wouldn't even know it so he had to put an Open Door before they even got into [Applause] it oh the grace of God praise God Amen page three amen 98 see it's important for you to understand the message amen so therefore 393 amen page 393 I just read okay set before thee uh an Open Door door oh no it's all right how the Lord said the end of that age I am the door to the Sheepfold now what door was open about Jesus just between these two ages 1906 about when the Methodist and Dwight Moody and them faded from the scene Here Come A Break Forth of the people receiving the Holy Ghost on Aza Street uh speaking with tongues and and and uh things back into the church that was that was right in about 19 1906 and and it came to New York City in 1909 by by Brother Brown from Glad Tidings church see this is church history right here in New York City and then Bishop Lawson he came from Ohio about 1919 with the baptism the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see he had an open door but he did nominated too see but Brown they had Father Son and Holy Ghost that's why all your trinitarian Pentecostal come from glad Titan's Church see praise God and they branched out and this one and that one then of course the the Assemblies of God brother Brown was here before the Assemblies of God got started cuz it was called the general Council in 1912 and 15 before they even got started brother Brown was on Glad Tidings independent you see me now so anyway uh amen it's good for you know your church history praise God and a Break Forth of the people receiving the Holy Ghost all right what took place then begin to come along the first thing you know they organized the old General Council which went in now called the Assemblies of God see how of that church was laed over and what what taking place then he said an open door now let's read it no man shut it set before thee open door I Know Thy works I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it an Open Door what is it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ not being a second person of a trinity but God but being God himself made flesh and dwelling Among Us and the Revelation amen he said now the first time the name has been spoke of now since back in this age back here it lost his name that was Luther now because uh Paul and arenius and Martin Columba had the same doctrine that they had on the day of Pentecost the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but they went in the ground in columia and Rome took over and income father Son and Holy Ghost and Luther brought it out on you thou H has a name and thou art dead father Son and Holy Ghost and they're still dead praise God cuz those are Idols praise God amen amen I'm a father I'm a son and and also I'm a husband and I have a name Joseph Coleman praise God he's the Holy Ghost he's the father he's the son but he has a name Jesus Christ God Amen may be seated first time the name been spoken of since now way back in this age here lost his name and Luther come out with a name that he was alive and it was dead that's right father son the Holy Ghost here comes out the name of Jesus again in between these two ages here in between the open door now it's a revelation what he or what he was the deity the Revelations of his deity see that's why it's hard to understand somebody say they have the Holy Ghost and don't know who he is so how can he's Assembly of God and all these people have the Holy Ghost when they don't even know who he is they got three Gods how can I know which one is right oh praise God God be praised now you see why this is very important here now I don't want to take too much time on it cuz I have to take you to the into the ground and and kill you I mean I don't want to say it like that because brother Wesco said we need a killing and the security up there to come running out there with their hands on their guns looking for the killing you know brother that was 1985 and Tulsa amen praise God now that's what he revealed at the very first church age now watch as John saw him standing the seven golden candlesticks there they are right there get a picture he was standing standing in between them he was standing with his hands out and just just look at the cand up there here's the first Candlestick 2 3D fourth 5ifth 6th and seventh with his hands out in the form of a cross he said I am Alpha and Omega in other words I'll be Supreme in the first which is Alpha and I'll be Supreme in the last which is now oh praise God Amen the light rises in the East and sets in the west it's been a dismal dark time but it shall be light in the evening time the same Gospel Power that raised up here on on the one hand at the East has shine over and now in the other hand at the West Alpha and Omega I am a and I am Z in his hand you get it now what did he do in the first chapter of Revelation he revealed his Supreme deity to the first church Ephesus is that right well now notice excuse me every one of these churches coming down through here he revealed himself in deity only in his glorified form see hadn't returned back in flesh yet oh Hallelujah you get it now he was in Flesh on in in the alpha that was that was him and Peter why have you lied to the holy ghost that was himself that bride was his flesh and he was sitting on the throne and anas and saf fire lied that was him then when it struck Paul's age he went into the glorified State praise God and come on down to the last days I send you Elijah Hallelujah son of man will reveal himself again he'll have a message of Revelation Seven Seals seven Thunders and that would be me the son of man himself sewing seed hallelujah praise God my God may be seated he revealed himself in deity only in his glorified form but on this last one he becomes Z that's Omega that's now back to the original beginning again see the first and the last the first age now the last age he's he said I am the first and the last but you say hi did it happen What fellow put that forth it was a revelation thank you Jesus oh it was a revelation do you understand what I'm doing now where these Thunders come from where this come from it's a revelation I can't help if you didn't get it I can't help if your pastor didn't get it oh it's a revelation you may be SE it don't you understand the last AG it not to the church it says to he that half an ear oh praise God he indiv indidual that have an [Applause] ear so we in New York City we don't have anything to do with Jeffersonville and Tucson and the rest of the people they're not our boss I don't report to them he that have an ear to hear straight from the throne from Elohim right down into my ear and when I hear I speak [Applause] so when you go to tell him brother Coleman is doing this and that in the message well who are they reporting to a bishop who are you reporting me to I'm only answerable to God not to nobody in the message so you write letters to who for what why would you write a letter about what I'm doing or what's going on in my church nobody got anything to do with it it's the he that have an ear let I'm hear with the spirit saith unto the church amen you may be seated oh I feel good now praise God people put me under brother Coleman did this brother keman did that brother Coman did what he heard you didn't hear it you don't have no Revelation you're dead you in the Dead part of the message oh praise God may be seated it's for the black man the white man the yellow man the red man ain't for no certain set of men no certain skin Hallelujah he that have an ear let him here praise God oh no ain't no skin to skin it's Spirit to flesh praise God you may be seated you say oh how did that happen What fellow put that forth what fell what fell what fell for what well what fellow put the seven Thunders forth for what it was a [Applause] revelation it was a revelation many of you here has received it I'm going to say something now look his entire church is built upon divine revelation of himself is that right if you don't believe it let's turn to Matthew 16:18 that's where Peter said thou art a Christ whom the men say I the son of man am he said well they don't know who you are they think of Jeremiah and this one and that one he I know they don't know now that you know that men don't know what the Thunders are who do you say I am individual not the men not those in the message not even John James Phillip none of them you Peter oh hallelujah praise you Peter not the other other Apostles but who do you Peter say I am not the other ministers in this message Joseph Coleman who do you say I [Applause] am oh I don't think I ever going to finish today brother I tell you I I didn't want to get into this here cuz I knew what what was laying there amen praise God you may be seated praise God Amen praise me so where I should go now I'm trying to hurry amen okay I'll go here now we find out that in this great Revelation that God see a spiritual Revelation that God gave here to the church in the last days that God sent and reveals himself open door he keeps nailing this down cuz people are denominational oriented when you're born in here in America you you think of a denomination but it was not so it is not so Amen brother Peter yes sirita praise God Amen you got a revelation Peter amen praise God Amen reveals himself the open door between the two ages you got it there right it now when when then you get that Revelation it goes right through Lea you get into that inch wide blood cord and that inch wide blood takes you straight into the seven rainbows no man got nothing to do with it praise God oh hallelujah praise God God be praised you see it that's why I put it there for you to see it Amen brother Ram rup yes sir you may be seated yes sir neither was it in the other okay it wasn't in the leot ofan age that just does my heart good was not in the

between the lover because I'll proen just a little farther down you'll get it see we make it rich so so that you can't keep from seeing it if you if if you just want to see it all right now the revelation of himself is where he built his church how many knows that that to be true he built the church upon the Revelation himself all right now where what did he say no man can shut it he used Luther for justification by faith who was a Catholic priest that was the first works of Grace then he used Wesley for the blood but after that he came himself with the open door you see it or he made sure that he put the Holy Ghost down in before before 19 1900 they had the great Welch Revival everything else before 1900 before zusu Street the fire swept the Earth brother the door was open of his Supreme deity I know Father Son and Holy Ghost that come down from Rome and Rome said come back my separated brethren so if you baptized Pentecostal father son the holy ghost or whatever you are run

he that was which is and shall come he said I am the first and the last I'm the first and the last I am the almighty he said it in three different times made himself deity to this first church here before before he went into the last Church age he made sure of that because he if he didn't make himself deity in between we'd have never got it in Lea see it had been all wiped out but he had a prophet already born in 1909 had him ready to go out 1946 to pull him out from both sides and put him at the cross that red line to go straight on into the rainbows oh and he put a little Tabernacle in Jeffersonville 1933 or so whenever it was down there and there was an Open Door in Jeffersonville 1933 that was the open door where he preached the deity Supreme deity of Jesus Christ right on through the 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s and we caught that door hallelujah praise God may be seated he went to the land Church age he said I set before you an open door if you want to see the

boycott come come upon that shall come upon the whole world to try them see that dwell upon the Earth so to try them I'd rather be tried now by the word like gold uh is tried purified and they going

citizenship well praise God you didn't know it did you yes sir well praise God a lot of things you don't know amen but as we get into this message God will begin to bring it out so you can get out of here amen now this great Temptation the our tempt that shall come amen why did I say that why did I say that I don't know cuz there's more to it maybe not the season praise God Amen I wonder if we gone amen you know uh what's it banging seven times then it was sealed with unknown tongues you you got to go in there sometime it's got to be open Hallelujah that's another fold oh my now this great Temptation our Temptation that should come upon the whole world to try the whole world goes into the tribulation just in a few minutes we'll see it goes into the tribulation and the tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley so what age are we in what's this door set before is between the Wesley where the church is headed right now and already into the lean age but this little place right in here within the last 35 40 years now he's speaking about this is a few years ago 1960 or so he talking about the little door there see uh within the last 35 40 years there been an open door setting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off and they'll go they go on until lukewarm just spurt them out of his mouth the work will be cut short up goes the church and here goes the Antichrist moving in for Destruction you know Revelation 12 tells you he goes after they who keep the Commandments and the other group the ones that he missed see he goes after them with a Vengeance amen he goes after the church and the Jews just perfect fits with the whole Bible right on around all right now here's the appearing of the sleeping Virgin also so she comes right in here now there's millions of them in this message I'm not in the message all around the world and proves that the lasts of the church ages move to the first part of the Pentecost for they go on into the Great Tribulation where they shall come in which did not come in the westly age you better get wisdom Revelation to missst that door oh my that was a quite a while there praise God well there you are Church did you get it catch that door and there's a door amen you know what the open door is now it's between Leia and also Wesley it's a door open there of the Supreme deity it's a door of Revelation and it goes right on up through there see and it's a I put a red line it goes right on through there brother Brandon was right in there himself and he went on and his message is what he brought in Statue of a perfect man and he put Holy Ghost there Holy Spirit and that is our age and we'll be stones that will be we are being called out by the prophet's word I'll speak on it maybe next week amen well praise God Amen now let's nail it down question answers on the Seven Seals page 464 um he brings back about the lion and the uh the The Lion and the ox and the man he's speaking about the man here which was Luther and Wesley and of course the eagle is the prophet he say okay now after the death of Wesley they had a Methodist organization see and now I want you to notice now someone might asked about the Pentecostal which was the third age you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but now watch listen very carefully but the baptism is the holy spirit now watch you see and that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet not William Brandon so he speaking here took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age that's in between because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness in the baptism the fire come to burn the demons out in 1906 and the open door age the fire comes you believe it you Sanctified and then as you yet speak these words fire falls from heaven and burn every devil out of you praise God and you receive the Holy Ghost and then he comes into you in the open door in babe form and I'm going to prove it see it's a babe and it goes through all these years as a babe and if you should die you go to heaven and there's another house waiting for you like I said where would we go but when he calls us out where can we go we go to the word the message the corner of we the green and then we have to be here for a purpose to pull this gospel yes sir Malachi's words shall not fall to the ground in vain they shall be lived yes sir did you get it now uh no Messenger to the age in between see because it wouldn't work out right then then William Brandon you would have him down at the end of Wesley look at it so you had to put Elijah at the end of Wesley cuz they come at the end so the Holy Spirit uh fixed him up and came himself and Open Door see and he knew that that was the the third one Luther Wesley Open Door baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew at the end would come the person of Jesus Christ praise God my my my my I believe you're understanding the word amen the word open the word open up to you all right holy ghost himself in his fullness in the baptism other words everything is going to be in that baptism amen it's the word cuz he knows that he going to send a profet and pour seeds in there it's going to make you a perfect man yes sir but at the end of the age as it always uh Enders upon the others we find there then the messenger sent and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places like that then the Rapture comes to the church there you are so you understand the open door age now all right then we can go on huh and this in this seed time prad time you know where you come from you know where you going okay I believe that was the message to cut off off the intellectuals head knowledge and give you a revelation of your seed and your time and season that you might be ready for the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and a refilling of the holy spirit in a greater measure to take you all the way to a perfect man I'm going all the way yes sir now speaking about seven Thunders a lot of people don't understand it so I have get a real short quote here so you understand it question answers uh number four it's in your Cod book amen question 129e have the seven thund which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed question were they revealed in the Seven Seals but uh are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's why I told you he took them from the back and put them under the seventh so they so it could be could be revealed in the book otherwise it be stuck to the back and you see no they weren't revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the Thunders come to reveal the inside of the book then the Thunders preached the seeds from the book The revealed word here it is oh Lord I Thank God Lord give me a revelation of which seeds to sew that's all you have the Thunders no but I have a revelation of which seeds the seow from the [Music] Thunders oh praise God they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was now how come John represents the church he knew what the Thunders was but he did not know what the seven written seals was why is that well he's the type of the church that will know what the Thunders are that's right see but a prophet had to come uh end time mess those seven written seals was his message that those seals Vindicated him before he went out so he opened the Sixth Seal mystery and then Pride Lo the seventh seal and says It's banging seventh under this not time yet well he's going to bring it oh praise God Amen my God no one make it out John knew what it was but he wasn't he was forbidden to write it but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed they would be be would be revealed when in the days of it sounding oh then then he's he's gone then they were revealed huh yes they were yeah they were so you need to pray for Revelation what they are will be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age he Nails it down he's telling you where the seventh angel is from the seventh Church age so he's got to come out of there somewhere amen well praise God you got it now that's what the thumb's all about amen well that should settle all the arguments over the seven Thunders they was to reveal on the breach page 74 and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God see the Mysteries come down from God as a word and reveals the entire revelation of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the mystery serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed as the word and the word goes on tape and spoken word books that's the Mysteries that is the mystery that's Christ is the mystery of God revealed why you don't read the books you don't hear the tapes I don't know where you at I don't know where you ever going to know anything about Christ amen what he's doing in this age amen the Bible's sealed to you he sent a messenger you ain't going to go around the messenger you're going to hear the messenger cuz he is the messenger you think that Christ is going to be in the prophet with a message and you going to say oh I'm in my church I'm going to read the Bible and I'm going to know and Christ is already there on the earth he'll close your mind out praise God you will hear him you ain't going to read no Bible I'll get it myself you're not you going to hear a message praise God that come from God you ain't going around it no way no way you're going to hear it they all got to hear it amen okay praise God all right here we go my God praise God the seventh was to revealed and these Mysteries as the word of God all these Mysteries as the word of God the revealed word seed a corn of wheat to the bride now I got you on the platform now you ready okay St John 12 20- 21 if you want to read it it's okay come back to this here verse 20 12:20 and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Phillip which was of Betha of Galilee and designed him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and of course uh verse 23 and Jesus answered him saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die by the alone but if it die it bring forth much fruit that was the answer sir would you see Jesus today well except the corner we' fall on the ground and die that's the answer then you see them well praise God you've been around many years looking to see Jesus huh but you got to die first you will never see him unless you die oh you can pay your tithe and give you offerings but you will never never see Jesus unless you die and rock in the ground praise God and then you raised up in the resurrection and you'll see him he'll be in you to the end of the world signs wonders and miracles following you praise God Jesus on two feet praise God hallelujah and Jesus answered him saying may be seated uh The Hours come at the son a man should be glorified very very I say unto you except the cor and weed fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit here where we here's where we are church after last Sunday's message of October 7th uh uh pointing us to Joseph Perfection manifested is the reflection of Jesus Christ now the reflection is the Perfection okay in today's message we want to find out how to come to this reflection and Perfection huh that what you want that's why you here he told me come in here he said if I don't come and do this then you won't understand nothing see this all this is this very hour is assigned to us now because the boycott and the persecution from the World Council is right at hand as we begin to attempt to be like Jesus and he said it would be that way see and a a perfect reflection of him on the Earth by the word being formed in us now Galatians 4:19 I read it to you there and what happened Paul said oh you Galatians who has Bewitched you you mean I come and for and preach Christ to you you receive the Holy Ghost and I come back around this second time and you got the law who or who deceives you who be who be with you you Galatians he said must I I be in birth pains again travail again all over again birth

cording to the rainbows here come your mama here come your papa here come your family come on RAB put that red cord out there praise God Amen maybe be seated did you get it neither can Jacob Grace coexist with Joseph Perfection Galatians 4:19 Paul said my little children whom I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you Malachi for himself preached birth pains to the bride to rock her from the Pentecostal age over to the bride age he blasted the the Jacob sins is that correct he call them all out put them in COD book and everything else put them in Hebrews book stop doing this here stop backbiting and go to the person's face lay the whole thing out there yes sir oh my God see on the field I I've been gone long time but here I get caught up in here I get I'm trying to get people delivered see so then in Malachi 4 we have seen a star and have come to worship Him Amen Let me hurry here page 17 to tie the AG in when Jesus page 17 was being formed in Mary that's when the persecution set in I read this before but now it ties in that's right that's right that's when her persecution started and it's the same thing in you Galatians 4:19 I just read it says that when Christ the hope of glory formed in you Christ is being formed in you when you are dying you ain't being formed hearing the message and run up and down and going here and going there and going to work and coming back he ain't being formed in you he's just there but one day it'll come come a time when there'll be an earthquake praise God a oh my God there'll be a message come forth pray something something within you will tell you like uh uh brother oblo and brother like brother Nathaniel I want to be perfect on earth oh a perfect man I I want to be a Lov slave harnessed by the Holy Ghost to the word my God a personal revelation the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that Open Door Lord let me in that door open that door Lord hallelujah praise God amen when you're dying and Christ is coming to life who's Christ the word praise God watch the persecution set in watch trouble start on every hand see how uh uh blessed you are to be in a place that's got it laid out for you as watching this here coming in like this here and you you're getting ready and it's getting ready see a seed has got to be sold before that boycott come to take a pray out amen praise God amen glory I feel it on the line now hallelujah amen watch the persecution set in watch trouble start on every hand all over the world here watch The Devil go on the Rampage look at New York City Devil's on the Rampage they can't stop it the doctors they are killing the people with drugs forming new diseases from their mixup of dist drug and that drug and that drug forms of disease oh hallelujah praise they have killing the people the doctors amen amen watch The Devil go on a rampage certainly when Christ is being formed in you something must be going on because he's certainly on a rampage yes sir and when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come the king's commandment all you people just as she was that the Christ was becoming a full baby ready to be delivered right then the great persecution oh praise God Amen now the baby's been forign a long time along to the woman to the womb but this is come in the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifest among his people and it can't start until that last seed comes in that last seed come out the sh where was at then you then you going to see the the forming start could have started already amen right here in New York anyway because he that has an ear so I don't have to wait to look to see if is it form there yet uh dingling linging uh did it form yet over there no I don't have to call Europe I don't have to call South Africa nowhere dingling Ling lingling amen no I just get in touch with him he tell be formed here October 7th amen yay praise God Amen I'll even give you earthquake where you were sitting on the mountain Hallelujah glory to God when the complete when the full of godhead when the completeness fullness of Christ is to be manifested among his people he said he promised it in his word and when that fullness you see there's unusual things begin to happen that he promised that's the reason our great social lives and things can't understand that is foolishness to them now watch they're forming a council of churches see just the time when the church is beginning to get to his feet where the supernatural is begin to work now they all went into a group and now they're going to try to stop this stuff just exactly like it was then that's why I was preaching one of the messages there when uh Peter when they were preaching salvation nothing happened but when they healed the lame man oh my God all Jerusalem was turned upside down see God has the season for that to start he wants you to get a revelation first what good would would for head for the dead to raising hand cripples or blind see when you don't even have Revelation that you're going to heaven does he make sense you come all these years and see the see all the Dynamics and don't have don't even have the Holy Ghost yet and there you see see get the best thing first okay see forming seed time form seed forming time is now forming means when you're dying and Christ is coming to life in you amen but this is coming the last days when the completeness see okay and um this could not happen in the age of Luther Wesley Pentecostals only in Joseph Perfection now you said only in Joseph Perfection sure uh well I thought um uh the Pentecost had the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right but see something El there was a mystery laying there page 246 and question answer book number four uh question uh 136 if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth require all three stages of grace before the person is truly Born Again absolutely I just explained it this morning the same on the same thing you got to have all stages uh you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten into the womb that's when the egg and the sperm come together and the mother is begotten then you get it now that's when the backbone lungs everything begin to form in the feet and it's begotten and the flesh begin to come on it it's begotten and it's eating is jumping punching moving aive begotten baby in the womb but it's not the life outside the womb so a Sanctified baby in the womb is not the same as a baptized Born Again praise God it's not the same praise God Amen hope that drove it home you're not the same and if you're not then hit you your knees praise God and beg God for the Holy Ghost I must be sealed I must be sealed and stop sitting around here and just hearing hearing hearing hearing hearing do something else yeah may be seated you're begotten in the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted you are in the procession of being converted until that time so while you're in the mother's womb you're in a procession of getting ready to come out and then the doctor bang and screams out yes sir now watch here's a revelation reveal I've doubt very very few that many menes even understand it that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley now watch could not be given to the age that has just passed by us the pente Pentecostal age why it wasn't time they were begotten now wait a minute how could the Pentecostal be begotten well look on that uh chart there Faith look at Faith there in Paul's age and and think about brother Brown statue of a perfect man he said oh you got faith oh great big wave came over you he said you just got started you born again Faith you just got started you only begotten in my age in the prophet's age you begotten with your Holy Ghost cuz he brought another message he brought the person that's added up right there as long as he didn't come that's why they didn't want to hear him long as he didn't come they could speak in tongues they were fine but when he come no no no he told women to stop cutting their hair on back to the the Bible Acts 238 they didn't want to hear it see do you see it they will only beg gotten this message here made the Pentecostals be [Music] gotten unless he had preached it don't mean nothing but when he preached that forget it they were begotten yes sir Glory that's why I told you that you got it in 83 well you ain't moved an inch how could you move an inch until Joseph Perfection [Applause] [Music] come you may be seated Glory see another Revelation to you they were begotten now the person of Christ himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have have come till now there you are Church oh praise God yes sir begotten and born amen but now notice the great revelation of the Mysteries here see and the Mysteries could not come to like I said one of the great Mysteries revealed in Malachi 4 was that the Pentecostals were babies with gifts to play with instead of the person he gave them gifts and not the person and they remained spiritual bathed drinking the S milk of the word grow up and even in Hebrews find about what you still baby I'm surprised you're not teachers yet huh is where aren't your teachers huh amen the stayed babies Pentecostal babies with gifts to play with and were truly only begotten even though they were actually born again cuz that this proves it right here why it wasn't time they were begotten now now the person of Christ himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it uh uh it could not have come to this time and brother B himself said on service what is the time he said the mystery of the person of Jesus Christ being in you without Sensations and he revealed that mystery in the in the 40s and 50s the person of Christ in him it's one thing we can say we know he got love but we don't know about his Doctrine amen so he revealed charity the person well praise God then that that canceled out Jacob praise God canceled out but it had to come on to a certain time maybe some brothers had to pick up the inspiration praise God and preach it Against All Odds Against what everybody got to say about it because it was to he it wasn't to them [Applause] amen see now okay now we in prad time seed time word time are you there did I lose you huh you ready okay we are now now you're ready to die ready to die amen you came just in time sister Michelle I have you a Dream came just in time amen we're now in Pride time seed time word time back to the Bible back to Perfection but we have to be introduced to the word and then Rock from Jacob Grace to Joseph Perfection my God put that rattle down oh I've always had this rattle put it down praise God I like this rattle it's m to my ears you don't need no rattle no more praise God get out of that crib praise God get out of that swatting clothes but it's warm in here it's nice am praise God this is green time Corner wheat time and the corner wheat uh uh uh the corner wheat uh wait a minute I got something here I can moan right in here and the corn of wheat can uh uh oh okay I got it I didn't dot my eye carries a law with it to be productive and fruitful that's right what is the law well I just read it to you verily verily I say unto you you have Seven Seals seven Thunder that's a corn of weed but it carries a law oh so where you going with the message huh back to the Bible to the law there's a law of that corn of wheat oh very very I say to you except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abideth alone you have all your books and your tapes and you march on to the tribulation period but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit there's your law for this season from God's word praise God three questions number one to whom do you go to in order to die and how do you die you like this question see amen see how do you know when you are dead how do you know do you ring a bell or something or what dingling dingling you're dead how do you know amen how do you know when you are alive how do you know those are three questions well sir we would see Jesus volume 3 number 23 okay here we go we'll go along here a little bit amen all right and usually and notice usually the way that people want to find Jesus is to find this page 11 is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him a leader or one of his servants is the way they find them so Jesus if he ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him because it's his purpose to Serve the People well Hallelujah you don't understand brother come you see I said but the word says but see you don't understand now I'm taking you to Jesus you come in at a room I take you to Jesus but I had a dream and I had to say I don't care what you had that's what the word says you coming to Jesus okay question number one to whom do you go to in order to die and how do you die so if Jesus ever chooses a servant he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him because it's his purpose to serve his people you're not serving me you're serving him and then he serves you just sends the Holy Spirit down and seals you and heals you he want to serve you don't look Comm man look to the Lord there is the answer to question one in part page 12 amen now um now here's a great thing in text here uh just as soon as the Greeks were was pointing to Jesus Jesus did not point to himself or he did not make himself known to them see that there and neither can we we we have this the the the corn of wheat that's why get tie in these meetings they're trying to know through what we was preaching for 11 all these years and Pen Harris and so forth the holy spirit said enough of the make of mechanics they have to die amen I brought every every kind of Revelation all the brothers did is that correct and the reading said finish they got a die I send the token down here's the anointing they tasted it now let them die well praise God Amen oh praise God Amen so uh Jesus didn't point to himself or did not uh neither Malachi point to himself he pointed to the word or did he make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus that in that way Jesus isn't known in that way you see now that would be more like in the 1961 version of it see but this 61 book here but look as soon as they were brought into his presence there it is that's the main thing get the people in his presence that's what we had had endeavored to do in thec by preaching the re revelation of Malachi for's message which brings down the presence get the people in the presence and that's all what we' have done can we say Amen is a presence here when you walk in here it never fails it's here Wednesday Sunday morning Sunday night it's always here well we are his disciples and we're getting you into the presence amen that's the main thing get the people in his presence and as soon as as soon as in his presence pres soon they got to Jesus he was the word which is the presence Jesus spoke immediately to them see except Accord we falls to the ground and dies and bindes alone what an unusual thing instead of accepting their introduction and you know the thing he done like somebody come here brother keman I hear about these Thunders and so forth I said die amen what praise God you don't know who I am I'm come from Guyana somewhere praise God die amen see yes sir I don't mean brother r that's okay praise God what unusual thing instead of accepting their introduction the thing he done was pointing them to a place that they could find him except the corner we fall to the ground and die it dies it abides alone so I've been pointing people to a place to find him they've looking at me and he's in the ground oh my God that's where you find him that you go down there I know it's cold but you going down yourself I've been down there praise God yes sir you go down there it's damp and cold and nobody around you devil you you this you that you get in there and die praise God di to all the criticism and everything else wh what what did he do here he pointed them to that great Truth how to see him they could not see him in the way of eternal life just standing there the way he was he was a man and neither could he get it from brother brandham cuz he was a man and he pointed him how to do it all his tapes and messages then God took them home and left the message which is the presence and we preach the message which is the presence which tells you how to do it so he told me that Joseph affection is here and if I don't come back and preach this message today then it won't mean won't mean one thing to you at all oh praise God so open up now and say come on brother Coleman tell me how to die don't sit there all quiet praise God you open up and tell me so I can tell you how to die amen don't you want to die Glory all right okay you got a revelation you may be seated there is the answer to question one in part get the people to his presence Jesus not point to himself he's not known in that way notice as soon as you come into His presence uh Joseph Perfection releases the Holy Ghost itself you're in his presence oh so you get there he tells you today except the corn of wheat die I know what happened last week but except your corner of wheat taking die you won't have that this here you get it oh Jesus said except the corn and wheat Falls the ground and dies it buys alone and Jesus points to the place where you can find him death bural and Resurrection except the corn wheat falls on the ground and dies and buys alone what did what did he do here he pointed them to the great Truth how to see him and Jesus is the word and the and the word for the hour and the day is the presence of God Amen now page 14 he pointed them there in his presence Christ pointed to the truth he said how to see them was to go to the Cross there's where it is at on page 14 amen he said um amen see now he pointed them there in his presence Christ pointed them to the truth he said how to see him was to go to the Cross there's where it's at at the cross at the cross where my savior died oh praise God Amen except the corn we falls into ground and bindes alone and if he did not die he would have he would have to bind alone himself if he did not die but he he being a corn of wheat that fell in the ground and then it falls into the ground he said it'll bring forth abundance it falls into the ground and dies first it has to be gerti grain first it has to have the Holy Ghost before he even die you understand now you have got to have be born again then you're gerti not just a dead word seed praise God then it falls to the ground he said that it'll bring forth abundance if it falls to the ground and dies first it has to be gerti or it won't bring forth nothing but has to have life in it before it can fall into the ground and he had eternal life in him and the Holy Ghost is eternal life Zoe eternal life oh hallelujah praise God you understand what I'm saying that's why I told you back in ' 83 you ain't been nowhere now from the day on you going to die now you're going to die praise God glory eternal life in him because he was Emmanuel and he had to give his own life in order to bring forth life again you have to give your life to bring forth life you can no more be yourself I don't feel like doing that or whatever you can't be that no more no no you have to be shaved off you have to be stripped of yourself of the good guy this person I'm good I did this I did that I didn't cause no trouble I didn't fornicate I didn't commit adultery and I was a good boy I was a good girl that ain't nothing praise God that's nothing hallelujah praise God I got some Buddhist and Hindus that do better than that praise God I got they even some will walk on coals and they pray every day kneel down back Side Up amen praying are you praying are you reading the Bible are you hearing tapes what are you doing huh oh I could tear this thing up here today praise God what are you doing instead of talking about your neighbor on don't you pray for him glory may be seated now this is this is now don't get shook up cuz this is what God ordered Hallelujah don't get Shook Up praise God don't sit there and feel sorry for yourself God himself ordered this for this day do you hear me you got to die die die die die every one of you die praise God you got to die you got to die now hallelujah praise God die die die die Glory don't say poor me I'm a good guy you ain't nothing there's not one good in the Bible there's not one good person here not in the balcony not in not downstairs nowhere Jesus Christ is the only good one so you are a liar you lie praise God you're you're not good die die repent die [Applause] confess thank you Jesus [Music] [Applause] may be seated take like the wheat you say how could one grain of wheat here's what happens one grain Falls in it brings forth a 100 grains 100 grains Falls in brings forth a thousand grains thousand grains Falls in and brings forth a million grains a million grains Falls in and brings forth a barge load and on and on till it feeds the whole world that's what he meant if I live my life alone and die this way just live my life alone well then there'll be no fruit after me be nothing but he had to die that 120 could live 120 had to die that 3,000 could live 5,000 could live and spread the gospel all across the world to The Whole World's missionary and somebody got to die in this message and others in the message can live glory amen but if I fall into the ground under the will of God and this is the will of God right here not for some man who's going to preach to you something this is straight from God this is the will of God all the worldliness all the all the videos all the all all everything gone praise God hallelujah my oh hallelujah praise God glory my my my my yes sir amen but if I fall on the ground under the will of God and I'll bring forth a new birth and in that new birth it'll bring forth another with new birth and another with new birth until the whole world is missionary and gospel preach this gospel must be preached in all the world for witness unto me these signs should follow them that believe so here we are oh my so if we ourselves in in our ministry that's me that's us in our ministry in our thoughts that's you and not all of us in our life if we abide as we are we can do no good we've got to also die at the altar or we'll live alone we'll live to some denomination we live to some Creed we live to some organization and we live to our good self well I'm in the message I haven't done anything wrong and I've been this and that you live to that amen but if we die to ourselves then the Holy Spirit praise God will be spread forth everywhere by our lips we've got to die yes sir oh so many today try to hold them their self and maintain your own idea I got my way of it I believe this but you cannot find Christ until you die to yourself and accept him the word then you find life oh hallelujah praise God God be praised amen so if we live if we uh ourselves then in our minut oh yeah I said that already we got to die at the altar we cannot find him until we come to Calvary and then we are crucified amen praise God we got to come to Calvary yes sir then the holy spirit will be spread forth everywhere on our lips we cannot find until we come to Calvary then we're crucified and it falls into the dust of the earth praise God Amen oh here we but we cannot find him till we come page 15 till we come to Calvary uh there we are crucified fall into the dust of the earth and die to ourselves and then reborn again then we find Jesus so today make up your mind that you're tired of coming in and out not with the Holy Ghost some came to that way last Sunday and they stayed in here and they prayed a few of us in here last Sunday so okay die to ourselves and be reborn then we find Jesus the word even eternal life page 17 amen but Christ brought them to the cross and when you get a real disciple that appoint you to to Christ Christ will bring you to the Cross as that disciple preaches the word that he's and that word that he's preaching like today that word not him but the word that he's preaching will take you to the Cross oh hallelujah praise God you ain't got nothing to say against a man then amen praise God the man is only a disciple amen glory glory hallelujah hallelujah praise God somebody going to be born again in here [Music] today you can be born again today you know oh oh yes you can we already in the season already Hallelujah Glory may be seated Christ will bring you to the Cross where you're crucified with him and his eternal life in your life meet together and when you run into his eternal life praise God your life dies when you see Jesus as he is you and you I believe it was Daniel when he fell and saw uh one like a son of

Michelle's dream here I was in the back she was in the back roll on her knees praying with such a burden it was a different kind of a burden a burden like I've never felt before it it all felt so the way I was praying and crying out for the Holy Ghost after a while I got up and was on my way out and heard your voice my voice saying now after each one of the virtues are preached you go home and pray the way you were praying for the Holy Ghost for those virtues to be sealed into your life my my my that's what I'm doing this morning Hallelujah amen s Michelle I'm doing it this morning praise

mental Faith that's why you lot of you don't know know what I'm talking about let's you get a revelation but now when the whole now he said come into your mental faith I pray to come in here today comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental Faith make it into a spiritual Faith that's when you're born that's when the new birth comes in then the spiritual Faith only recognizes the word and Malachi 4 revealed the word from Paul and arus and Martin colum and Luther and West what they left off and apostles right on back down to Moses praise God and you only recognize that yes sir now in number two three then you have spiritual you have the Holy Spirit was sealed all these things into you as the Holy Spirit covers this from your faith look at the chart up to the holy spirit in that little slot see there seals you in with Christ and then you become one amen you become one see and Christ you and Christ live together that day you know that I'm in the father father in me and I in you and you in me then that's a seal unit of the Lord now see now from Faith you add seven things right is that right virtue knowledge Temperance patience amen godliness brotherly kindness and what the Holy Ghost that's right in the Bible it's right there in front of you you can't escape it amen so you can't coexist no more with Jacob Grace you here now today you're here death of a corner where you got to die when you go out of here so you Brothers you go on the Cy I hope you tell them to die in your sermon out there praise God tell them to die amen praise God Amen then that's a seal unit of the Lord now and then they are Vindicated in place when that time takes place they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God oh praise God now you brother you said now seven birth pains amen yes sir take seven birth pains page 39 amen oh he says how do you get in the church born what by the Breath of God Breathe on Me Breathe on Me Spirit of living God breathe on me that's my prayer just let the Holy Spirit breathe oh for the Breath of God what is it sealed away in the kingdom of God knowing that when I first confess I believe Jesus Christ then to my faith I add virtue Godly virtue uh then to my virtue knowledge of the word to my knowledge I add Temperance self and self-control on from seed to shining SE patience oh my test it don't worry Satan will try these virtues for you he'll try you on patience and the rest of it I'm climbing up the ladder now see I've added virtue knowledge Temperance now I got to add patience I still ain't got the Holy Ghost that's off the top amen we left the Pentecostal age now Hallelujah so you can't rest on your Laur since 83 now you got to go home like according to her dream man like I said there and go home and pray for this and pray for the next one and pray for that one just like you prayed for the Holy Ghost Hallelujah brother I hope it goes in there yes sir amen add patience add godliness uh you know what what like like God I add that don't misbehave myself go like a Christian gentleman ought to so why I tell brothers and treat these sisters like uh ladies cuz they're the daughters of the king see these sisters here and your wife is the daughter of the king you treat her like the King's Daughter according to the word don't push and shove and shut up and this and that and so forth amen little quiet here huh then you ain't dead yet then praise God you ain't dead yet praise God I thought you was in the presence of God Amen said that little backlash come back bang knocking right back down [Music] again yes sir brother come you fist a ball up I know it is I'm I'm I'm in a battle brother yes sir praise God you like act like you ready to hit somebody or something no I got a a rifle back there from Puerto Rico I don't need to hit nobody amen I got two 44s that brother mus them gave him brother I got him home amen got a holster from Montana same people that may John ways amen I got all that yes sir praise God just getting

a Christian gentleman that's right ought to let them not be a put on there Hallelujah see it's something in you the love of God just boiling in you boy I could do it maybe I better not see uh-huh uh-huh it's there anyhow it's a birth oh here we go it's a birth I've been birthed into this I've been birthed into this into this into this into this into this into brotherly kindness and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service you mean I have the seven birth pains by Malachi for yeah from the day on but I got the Holy Ghost I know yeah but uh see this message here you know that makes you begotten and you don't have the Holy Ghost yet cuz at the time amen you down there a babe down in in faith amen and you want some virtue and and knowledge to pour out praise God that you might die out and add those virtues praise God oh Hallelujah quickly uh okay there's your seven birth P by Malachi 4 and then the love of God seals you up for service and you're plac Vindicated and adopted in over the death of a corn and wheat it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and one has to cease so the other one can exist praise God this flesh Must Die that the spirit might live yes sir there's a spirit page eight amen three stages of birth well you know what it is like the natural and spiritual the water just sanctification justification by faith believing on God receiving as your personal savior being baptized second the sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all the elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel there we are page nine so notice in the seed's birth the old seed must die before the new one can be born amen so therefore death is hard anytime so it's painful distressful birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world and it's painful amen can we say Amen am okay you got to die so and then after you're born again then you have to really die to yourself like Galatians 2:20 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and in the Life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and many as left by the spirit of God they are the sons of God the death of a corn of weat okay page 10 Jesus said that he was the word that the his word was a seed that a SE went forth to seow now we're all acquainted with that and I want to teach you like a son school lesson here is Sunday that's what I'm doing today notice this then this word being a seed but remember the seed is only bringing forth a new life when it dies amen and that's the reason it was so hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law now remember you two cannot coexist together they were under the law and the law was the word of God In seed form but when the word was made flesh that's what I'm trying to get to here the word is made flesh in you [Applause] today and you can't coexist with all little nasty things of Jacob Grace it can't be no more that dies Hallelujah yes sir my God the word the law was in seed form but when the word was made flesh become not law but Grace and now becomes Perfection is a reflection amen now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time because Grace is so far above the law law is not even in the picture and therefore it's so hard for the Pharisees to die to their law so that Grace could be born amen but it must go the two laws cannot exist at the same time well you got one law of the flesh Romans 7 and you got one law of the spirit now what are you going to do when I would I would not I know I ain't going to even get into you read the Bible amen praise God I ain't going over there but there's a law to your flesh and to your as a law to the spirit and you ain't going have the other unless that flesh that Lord dies yes sir so there we are praise God it's hard for the people in the message to die to their thoughts about the message and receive a revelation Jose of perfection that Christ can be molded and formed in them for Perfection they don't want to hear it amen I know it I've been through it brother amen okay page 13 now we know the old seed must before the new seed can come out of the old seed it must run now we on rotting now amen absolutely not die only Oh Brother come I'll die but do I have to rot yes sir you got to R not die only but run after his dead you ain't getting away today waiting 3 years of preachers here listen looking at all the flesh around here praise God I just wouldn't say nothing he said let it alone Let It Go praise God it'll be a day when they will you will tell them I'm telling you today praise God Amen oh not die only but right after his death we know that to be true that's the same thing in New Birth we never go back but we go forward when you're born and that's why I think today we have so many not so many rather uh genuine New Birth is because the seed is maybe to sympathized with the word or the person but they don't want to run away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it even today uh they might have come out some strange denomination that dressed a certain way and had certain ways and look a certain way they want to come in the message and keep the same ways and then judge you because you're not like them that's right I know what I'm talking about so don't judge me praise God Amen praise God because I don't want to look like the way you look no brother brother Branson now you have to look like an antique box that's a quote also yes sir the prophet like nice things amen I know what goes on praise God I know what it's said praise God but I don't care about anything about it because only to that I'm I'm take you to Christ I'm a true disciple I don't care about all your gossip it don't mean nothing to me praise God Amen See No Evil Hear no evil speak no evil praise God here's what you got to hear right here maybe s asde with the word of the person but they don't want to ride away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system to watch and claim the new birth or the message of the age now we got them brother we got them now huh want to stay with all nasty ways and claim the message what message are you in should I read it again want to stay your own nasty self in old ways old system and claim a new birth I'm born again I heard the word from the prophet I'm born again you you are not born again until fire burns the old system out of [Applause] you and then you're born again when fire cleans every demon out of you of criticizing talking and gossiping when that's burn out of you praise God then you have the Holy Ghost amen glory and they want to be evil in the message and Prejudice and everything else and claim the new birth and claim the message of the age we found that under Wesley we found that under the Luther Wesley Pentecostal and all of Ages they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system age must die right in order to bring forth the new one they still want to cling notice they know the old system is dead they know it's wrong they read the prophets quotes they shouldn't talk and do all these they know it old sister they know it's dead see to me now but they just don't want to run out of it amen they're afraid if they go tell the person do all the Talking you know look there's enough of this stuff here look I want to be like Jesus what are you talking about you in the message see that they're afraid to say that I know they are in this message oh yes they are they want to still joke and Carry On and and and you know you know what I'm talking about they won't right out of it see now rot is when it's really done away with when a claim is made that they are newborn but a claim watch is only a begotten sign so therefore the Pentecostals is now begotten the New Birth has now begotten and it's only a sign a claiming time you claim to have the new birth but add to your new birth virtue knowledge Temperance patience and while you're adding you're rotting rotting rotting rotting you're rotting out to yourself and you're adding there you [Applause] are but a claim is only a begotten sign rotting brings forth the new birth amen you got to rot away from it just as as we did in all ages through the west and all forth but the thing of it is after the New Birth is born Wesley Luther came forth with one word they just want to live stand by the Jud shall live by faith well he could no longer cling to the old system he had to come out of it you see what I'm saying now you couldn't be Lutheran and still cling to the Catholic could be Wesley still cling to Lutheran Pentecost is still cling to that in on see and neither can you be Joseph affection and cling to the old ways old system old nasty things well church I'm only a disciple pointing to the word don't die on me praise God Amen Hallelujah so the old seed must absolutely d right out who's the old seed that's you your imagination memory affection constant reasoning and what you think and what you feel that's you why you who is it it's you praise God you cannot stay with that old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age they still try to hold on to this the old system and claim this but the old system must die and rot in order to bring forth the new one now R is when it really done away with or claims only begotten son okay I've been through this here amen praise God so therefore seven birth pains by Malachi 4 brings on rotting amen and then love sealing all the Seven Virtues after riding away to old self you have got to ride away from all the old things you did in the message and all these years and die out and come into Joseph Perfection and rot and die or die and rot see a seven birth pains for a newborn word bride living by the word every word hallelujah birth pains always comes under every new messenger message it's always birth Pains come on fin oh praise God didn't think I'd make it down here pray I had to bring in I would have been finished but I had to bring in uh the open door age it took about 40 minutes amen I want to just drive this thing home but since I won't see you I thought I'd give to you the whole thing amen praise God Amen praise God now let's be honest page 26 birth pains if we see that the church is in a condition I'm just speaking about today haven't we at that time again now just look at the things of the problems of the Bible that would would be going on in the church at this time we see what's going on in the world and we see it at the end now let's look at the church see she the church had birth pains on the Luther now we know there seven Church ages and seven Messengers to them Church ages according to Revelations but now when Luther had to come forth it certainly throw the church into birth pains but it brought forth the Luther yes sir after that got in trouble again so it brought forth a Wesley that's right got uh uh got forth again and brought forth the Pentecost each one of them messengers of the age Rock the back to the word the message of the age the message of it according to the Bible amen now notice each age Rock the church and give it birth pains and we have got to come to birth pains friends page 27 Now quickly now she's in the in the phase in that phase beyond the shadow of a doubt we're in the lean Church age now her Messengers promised in Malachi 4 uh 4th chapter he's promis to do it and the message to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 there's two systems working in the church the world today amen I'm going to get off my shoulder and then I can uh have it over with we all know that that's the word of God in denominational system there's the two system that work just there was Jacob and Esau amen one after the spirit and one after the Flesh and what is it Esau had Esau and Jacob was fighting in the wombs of the mother even to the time they were born in this message they're fighting in the womb until Joseph Perfection comes forth with the love of God in Perfection they're still fighting in the womb in the message twins praise God Amen and so is denominational in the word fighting against one another they've been they have been since Luther first brought the First Reformation I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it now these men if they can pick up this and go out with it these disciples or they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place have we come there October 7th did some disciples bring it to a place huh these men praise God here's a prophet speaking I just want to lay this seed sew it praise God but I hope they make it come to life die you love the prophet then die and live his message praise God Amen and that'll stop all the gossip and everything else praise God remember the true servant always takes you to the word Christ amen these man praise God the son of man sold a seed now we have to die to ourselves with that word seed uh a corn of wheat in order to come to life Tak seven birth pains by Malachi 4 oh Hallelujah page 28 there's a great system big system trying to be formed called The World Council churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth two children you mark my words the world the the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her bride out of her a bride for Christ amen they fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that will come out of the word that they come on they they come out on like from your feet to your head she just gets greater and more you have to more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to the head of it all amen amen so there we are Church praise God it takes seven birth pains to bring forth this bride to be delivered oh my my my page 33 I'm closing uh um the U musicians pray I'm finish what she is to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read malikiah 4 and see if you if you're not supposed to have a message in the last days that'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original Pentecostal message word by word Brothers we are here now this church is supposed to get a sign and and its last sign we find out here in the scriptures see how the great birth pains has been in this Le C and age their
