[17:21] through the city and before they went to
[17:23] slaughter a man or rider came with a
[17:25] inkhorn the riders inc on either side
[17:27] just in white he said don't go into the
[17:29] city don't slaughter anything until
[17:31] first you have sealed the servants of
[17:33] God in forehead and he went forth and he
[17:36] seal even said two little chilled

[17:43] for them come and went in and absolutely
[17:46] demolished everything had no pity they
[17:50] slaughtered man women children and
[17:52] everything that had not to seal the
[17:54] first man with the inkhorn rider that
[17:56] sealed away amen
[17:58] and then he brings over to Matthew 24
[18:00] you know about Titus Amen and how a
[18:03] message a revealed Word message went
[18:05] forth by Jesus and the Apostles in them
[18:08] and told him when you see Jesus said it
[18:11] when you see Jerusalem compassed about
[18:13] what armies get out and tires and moved
[18:16] in and the bride that was in the city
[18:18] couldn't get out but they said but then
[18:21] he made a way of escape because he said
[18:23] so the way of escape would come only
[18:27] when you would see Jerusalem compassed
[18:30] about
[18:33] definitely seen Jerusalem compassed
[18:35] about the bride didn't have fear they
[18:40] have they had joy we're going home on

[19:41] my lord
[19:44] maybe see the page 440 MA
[19:53] Erica said me too now we see the
[19:56] abomination make a desolation standing
[19:57] the holy place now then in the days of
[20:00] the coming of tires after Jesus had left
[20:01] the Holy Spirit was that man with the
[20:05] ink point at his side and he went future
[20:08] rules him instead of mark upon the
[20:09] people now I want you to notice
[20:12] something church member and you claim to
[20:14] have the holy spirit he said don't steal
[20:16] any of them but then that sigh and cry
[20:19] for the abominations that's done in the
[20:23] city Jerusalem and it's a rule this is a
[20:26] church so I cried inside and this
[20:29] Jerusalem here against dominations why
[20:35] because I wanted to be sealed
[20:38] not because I'm mean and mad at you
[20:44] I want to have a place for the headstone
[20:47] to come round in the crown so I had to
[20:54] cut in jump and whatever please forgive
[20:58] me for trying to make you perfect is
[21:05] there not a cause what have I done
[21:10] what have had done but preach the word
[21:15] is there not a cause shall the devil
[21:19] take the whole thing is there not a
[21:23] cause why you uncircumcised philistine
[21:28] these look got children I don't care
[21:31] they're mad at me when our whack their
[21:33] hunts but I know in there when I get
[21:38] those Devils off of them they want to
[21:40] throw their hands up again to praise God
[21:42] begin to worship and thank the Lord
[21:49] is there not a cause
[21:52] now you understand me now I'm not so
[21:55] mean all right I'm your friend Joseph
[22:04] Joseph Coleman I mean a man all my I
[22:09] don't seal any of them only those that
[22:15] cry inside against filth in the church
[22:18] against gossip and filth
[22:21] seal those who's against that stuff
[22:25] chlorine and cry against abomination
[22:30] three and old God help brother call me
[22:33] Lord get them sent to preach Lord
[22:38] hey where's anybody so burned about the
[22:43] world now on their condition well our
[22:45] myth has I'm bad but I'm in the message
[22:47] I got tapes and books or not that
[22:51] constant burden for the loss that
[22:53] sweetness don't never let anything rise
[22:56] up and put bitterness in your soul no
[22:59] matter how bad anyone ever treats you or
[23:03] anything don't never don't be guilty of
[23:06] letting that thing anchor in your soul
[23:09] it'll grieve the Holy Spirit lady
[23:14] no matter what the test is and I've been
[23:17] through some real tests it's got this
[23:20] past year but ain't no business on
[23:24] anchor here
[23:28] brother I mean to see Jesus I must see
[23:32] Jesus I will see Jesus we shall see the
[23:37] king
[23:37] [Applause]
[23:41] whoa burden for the loss okay god bless
[23:47] you amen
[23:48] I'm almost finished here the ministry of
[23:51] Christ must be here to catch the
[23:53] headstone so the profit is gone but we
[23:56] got to bring the ministry back in and
[23:57] place it now once let's watch Jesus he
[24:01] had the fullness of the Holy Ghost that
[24:02] did at the Jordan River then he went
[24:05] into the wilderness to be tested because
[24:07] God cannot give you the power unless
[24:09] you're tested so his character had to be
[24:11] test and he oh he defeated the devil by
[24:13] the word his written is written is
[24:15] written is written so st. Luke 4:14 he
[24:18] come out of the wilderness with the
[24:20] power that he went in there with but he
[24:22] had a season when he didn't use the
[24:24] signs and wonders and miracles he just
[24:27] used the power of the word so when he
[24:30] defeated the devil by the power of the
[24:32] word about 1984 there's not another
[24:35] spirit moving because had he used the
[24:41] power between 74 and 84 be whole lot of
[24:44] people in here
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:49] is that wonderful but he used the word
[24:52] is written is written in written you
[24:56] shall be filled
[24:59] glory speak the word for Timothy it
[25:01] happened it's a promise
[25:06] they don't want that they walk away
[25:09] glory then Jesus returned in the power
[25:12] here he come down to the temple walks
[25:16] into the temple returned and power the
[25:18] PALS upon but he can't use it yet until
[25:21] he identifies the season
[25:25] [Applause]
[25:27] can't use it yet until a third phase is
[25:30] a 10:05
[25:34] amen okay how long you wait until this
[25:37] shall be healed don't worry
[25:43] it's gotta be identified he's ready for
[25:47] his music but he got to go to Temple
[25:49] first and after this defeating the Satan
[25:51] by the word three wall attacks he walks
[25:54] into the temple to identify the season
[25:56] then there's the worry to went in there
[25:58] did the priest hand him in the Bible the
[26:01] scrolls aim in the scriptures and he
[26:03] went to Isaiah 61 the spear Lord's upon
[26:05] me set the captives free and so forth
[26:08] and he was sick whatever so he had to
[26:11] identify the anointing that was on him
[26:13] in the word and his hometown then the
[26:21] word was struck by the anointing in the
[26:25] temple glory he pick up the book and
[26:29] read from his ayahs 61 and stopped at a
[26:33] comma the acceptable year of the Lord
[26:35] and it didn't end the day avenges he cut
[26:38] off right there
[26:39] and acceptable year Lord is Jubilee he's
[26:44] come to bring a Jubilee to the captive
[26:47] Jews that was free I mean that was
[26:48] barren and by pharisees and sadducees my
[26:54] prayers come as sin he closed the book
[26:58] at all eyes was upon him and he began to
[27:00] say unto them this day this scripture is
