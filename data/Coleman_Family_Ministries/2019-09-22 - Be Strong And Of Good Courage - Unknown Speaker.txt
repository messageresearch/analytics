TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to read from the Book of Numbers a Genesis I mean numbers 13 numbers 13 what am i reading from verse 26 through 33 and Joshua the first chapter verse 9 numbers 13 26 and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel onto the wilderness of Paran to Kadish and brought back word unto them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentence us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities a walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of a knack their Amalekites this is a wonderful reporter isn't it aim and Amalekites dwell in the land of the south the hitter type naming all those devils and things bringing down the Holy Ghost and Dawn hey what a report amen saying hit at times just bites and a mirage dwelling the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan I could just see a minister of God telling you all the city is terrible The Subways is filled with Devils and these people hold their drinking last night and just happened over there we don't I won't know about Jesus Christ amen why that's the report amen and what the devil did to me this morning I had a terrible time I had a something terrible happened me on the subway this more about it hey man what did Jesus he brought you here amen praise God and Caleb still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it there we are amen for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we my giving glory to the devil huh and they brought up an evil report of the land which they have searched unto the children of Israel saying the language through which the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it or men of a great stature I see a statue of a perfect man on what they say amen and there we saw the Giants and the sons of a knack which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight Joshua 1:9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest and he got it a blessing to read of his word you may be seated like it take a little thought just a few words be strong and of a good courage well brother Anthony if I ran into a roadblock there when you say we all how many of filled with the Holy Ghost well just explain to your brother Anthony is just um believing the wait brother Bram has taught the message that the baptism of the Holy Ghost then God answers the life - so we've been adding the life to it so sure we would be filled with the Holy Ghost but we're waiting for charity to come down and then we'll be another book of Acts and then we'll say Peter fill with the Holy Ghost begin to speak Stephen full of the Holy Ghost he spoke Paul full of the holy ghost ship loosed a Viper so our people just didn't catch the understand what you're trying to say that's what's in their minds we you say full of the Holy Ghost while they're looking for a book of X I understand brother amen praise God now all the clouds are gone amen see we know where we stand at now see the sheep there brother and now they're smiling now they know what we're talking about here Amen see so anyway um realize now we have I promise this morning to be fill those that there are those here who don't have the Holy Ghost you see they never went for that believe the message and you got it he's here now no they came in here with a full promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see see I have children here that uh that are desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the promise on to me and my wife and to my children and they'll believe in a message and I'm believing for my children present the token for my household we have a promise God cannot fail so there are many who have not received it but there's a seed in the soul that God has amen and they bleed every word amen they're like a Peter and I'm in the upper room who didn't have the Holy Ghost did science one is a miracle but they had a promise amen MSA feebly he abide in me and my seventh under words of I renew you shall have whatcha will so that's what they're doing here this morning brother Anthony amen now see just a little a little thought here testing time God keeps his word honey believes that and he will fulfill every promise so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is promise is a promise of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost faith all the way up through charity then when charity comes upon us the capstone then we are filled with the Holy Ghost a statue of a perfect man sealed amen and vindicated adopted in place for service you won't have to say you fill with the Holy Ghost they'll know you feel you will say nothing amen it'll just chop out here they'll walk into your presence and all kind of things will happen it'll be Jesus on two feet so brother man say you only have to testify what you got it'll testify of itself amen so brother Bram the Holy goes up on him and in him pitched on the inside on the outside and Shekinah over him it testified with a life in size and wonders and miracles so praise God but revelation 10-7 said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished who God is what God is how he lives his nature his being should be finished when noise is said in the days of the voice the prophet is gone but the voice is here amen so we are now in the days of the voice Omar and many have received a prophet but how many are receiving the voice of a of the seventh angel a Magister he's gone but the voice has been right here and there how many believe this voice is spirit spoken word there's in bride this morning how many bleared the spirit and the bride say come then a mouthpiece Amen an anointing on the bride's mouth to say

carnal we are not carnal in that word I don't care how many mistakes you make we are not carnal I remember unbelief is as potent in its realm a man as faith is in its realm to you or me anyway the 10 spies they saw joyous and they thought themselves as grasshoppers Caleb and Joshua saw themselves as Giants and them as grasshoppers [Music] so today I'm stepping on grasshoppers stop another grasshoppers hey man freeze but pull out that sword charge them grasshoppers so where you standing this morning you're standing with Josh wait Caleb or you're staying with the ten spires and two million the whole congregation saying no what do we care the whole message says you're wrong God said soul Amy so faith in this realm without the Holy Ghost is more powerful than unbelief in the other realm because unbelief is a reversal form of faith unbelief is the belief in the power of evil in place of belief in the power of God now where you're standing this morning God gonna make you ready amen he gave you a taste of the garment place a get the itty-bitty teeny-weenie spirit off of them that they might possess the inheritance amen are you gonna believe in the power of God or power evil

pinned down that's right I believe the horse got up and is riding off riding into any assembly or anybody's heart that warrants appear on ad alterator word from the beginning you can have it this morning brothers sisters but we gotta have the right attitude the Holy Spirit told me to read a couple of coached here and leave it with you may I say it again we have risen up from knowledge into charity we're here right now this morning he poured his presence out upon the word simple of a few simple words of his his presence I have no message here just a few words but what was not worth it it's born what's his presence was here see I said just had a few words if you believe his presence is here then something has happened March 28th [Music] here's a quote God in His Word Phoenix Arizona to 23:57 I believe it can prove at the right mental attitude towards any divine problems of God will bring it to pass yes sir the right mental attitude but you got to have the right attitude not the ten spies now Caleb's attitude the attitude is what brings the results if you said yes yes I believe it but I don't know now that's not the right attitude do you believe it the right attitude is to receive it and say it's thus saith the Lord then it's right and if you can say I'm healed or saith the Lord it's all over with if you can say I have the Holy Ghost by faith thus saith the Lord God will seal that faith hey man can you nurse that promise this morning can you get a hold of the breast 1l shatter [Applause] he's here now just stay reverent get all the unbelief out of the atmosphere proving this were in Lausanne is California for 2665 we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here can we say Amen and so is the dynamics can we say Amen [Applause] if you can just get started this morning God will do the rest he'll pack you beyond the veil I know you don't know what I'm doing now the Holy Spirit has already placed you into charity it's here it's going on right now oh don't you feel the Holy Spirit moving I got something to read to you I asked brother Frank for a straighten tape Friday night and do you know I told him the wrong tape I wanted total deliverance and I must have said testing time and he gave me testing time when I went to here I said that's not what I want I want to total deliverance the Holy Spirit said hear it and I heard it Wow amen that's the one he wanted for this morning brother Frank is Iran brother Frank I asked him but I wanted total deliverance because the book is coming out so I wanted to get the tape before the book got here and hear it again and I got testing time and here's what a brother Brent said on the end of testing time 57 marvelous things to happen in the meetings he had just come from Oakland California it's we're coming into a type of something that it just seems to be greater than than what it was prophetic gift beyond questioning his other words his gift is beyond questioning we see that he said but his gift now it just doesn't get the job done way it should it's just a gift another thing is an individual it's an individual it pertains to an an individual through a gift so he went ministered to one person the next one the next one the next one and some wouldn't get it and they go home discouraged then right if they didn't get a prayer card they were finished right there so he want to get the church beyond that he want to get us here this morning in the presence of the Shekinah no gift giver himself his presence not to just one individual with a prayer card or maybe has some faith to pull it over there but he want to be want the least little one with a little bit of grain of mustard seed faith he want to get you into his presence to weigh all things are possible to them that belief [Applause] got it now but I have done something the other day I tried to get the people in Oakland just to where in in the big arena there I said just his presence and this faith in right with that word now you know what happened this morning don't you the presence of God and just the faith in the word we're here [Music] you were number what we're here many of us can't believe for believing amen praise God I said just his presence and this faith in right with that word and got to people he said and you know what there were more healings then I believe I've ever seen taking place in any one meeting outside of the big meetings like an Africa that was an Oakland he said four puffs because for science the people watch just recognizing the presence of God in the meeting just sitting there and getting into the presence of God no delusions no idiot bitty teeny weeny z-- hope you get it not what I should did yesterday I forgot to forget about it get in his presence amen just sitting there getting into the presence of God and a people would get up healed watch now crossed eyes straight now brother Joey brother riddle cross eyes just straighten out in the presence of God I don't know who God wants to heal this morning I don't know who God want to seal this morning but we are here I'm declaring today I'm making it making a declaration by faith I'm saying charity is here God's presence is here this morning little Peter Palomas I can straighten out little Jennifer I can straighten out my wife's I can pop open sister Meili I have pop open ho the tongue can speak the Deaf can hear the angel of the Lord is here moving through the house of God quote and it begins the quote same thing I believe is coming to a time Paul said where there is prophecies its young fail where there's tongues they shall cease believers coming to the term to when the Saints will get together like this amen and just a love spirit will just sweep over the audience and just every person in there all that's wrong will be taken out now by Mina by him it'll be just such a presence of the Holy Spirit what a promise he said I knew nothing said read this to the congregation this morning so I'm reading it I've always did it by saying I believe give so wonderful and we need them and respect them then I in your cold book they left something out I happened to notice it on the tape they had completely left this out here and become one read it to you in between it's cold here I said just as president faith in the word and and with that word and got the people you know what there was more healings in the air I mention that the next page I believe while we are to lay hands on them and pray for them now it's a contact now or may be a minister anointed and laying hands on just as a blessing to God how many have got to have our hands on here you know what I mean if brother coma just put his hands on me I'll be all right uh-huh we be on that [Music] trying to bring you out of that trying to we're gonna walk in here from here on out and sit in the prison's cross eyes straighten out ears pop open see what we have friends oh of course we'll still lay hands on the sick that's in the Bible same r16 but we trying to get into the atmosphere of the presence of charity sweeping you've seen it right here but I believe it's coming a time when God's church is going to be so called out like that prophesy on you now where the Saints will set together like this morning and the Holy Spirit will just come in and just move like it was on the day of Pentecost oh what a quote just heal the people raise up the people and great things in the beginning I tell you why man has gone forth with his gifts and he travels all the second pull first for all the men with their gifts and people run into the men amen how many did that man looking for money and shakings and all kind of oil and blood and whatnot but the thing of it is get the gospel to the people you see it's a preach amen I believe the time is coming when the manifestation that gives this gives every man to to profit withal I believe give some wonderful because then he goes on to the second part here I believe get some wonderful and we need to me respect them probably the times the economy is going to be on a higher standard than that after all these things has done away that which is love will endure forever see it's the love of God we'll just be standing preaching like this or talking like I'm talking now and standing standing and just the love will just settle over the building oh praise God so the Holy Spirit Ouma told me - from here on out they had teaching keep your messages short and lay down the word and the presence of God will be there so I want to say I by faith I want to say this morning I believe that we are here so all we have to do is to believe it you believe your friends let's sing at last when Jesus is here when I
