[0:02] [Music]
[0:04] and
[0:06] Grace how
[0:09] swe the sound
[0:13] Glory let
[0:15] sing a
[0:18] rich like
[0:21] me
[0:24] Hallelujah I
[0:27] once was lost
[0:31] well
[0:33] now am
[0:36] found was
[0:39] blind but
[0:42] now I
[0:44] [Music]
[0:46] see oh
[0:51] Hallelujah everybody knows how to travel
[0:54] now amen we're not turning left to
[0:58] reasoning am we turn it right to faith
[1:02] faith is the victory glory to God oh my
[1:09] now remember Sister Sylvia Colon's
[1:11] testimony March 5th this year there she
[1:15] was reading there on page four and say
[1:18] that sealed and then the voice thundered
[1:21] in Her says the Silence has been broken
[1:25] she whispered February 28th and a voice
[1:28] said the silence has been
[1:31] broken so now remember as I go into this
[1:35] message The Silence has been
[1:39] broken
[1:41] amen so now there's supposed to be a a
[1:45] manifestation on the third phase to
[1:49] vindicate the seven Thunder
[1:52] inspiration and we having the visitation
[1:55] to the young people last night another
[1:57] one amen and then the Lord remind Joy bu
[2:01] to tell them keep putting coals on the
[2:04] fire don't let it go down and just you
[2:07] know just getting started you got to go
[2:09] to pen Harris you got to go back to Lake
[2:12] Champion what are you talking about huh
[2:16] God Only God knows what's going to come
[2:18] out of this oh my glory to
[2:25] God so what is a manifestation is a
[2:28] state of being
[2:31] manifested the
[2:33] demonstration like sister philis boy's
[2:35] dream she said was it wasn't on a
[2:37] concert they knew going to be a
[2:38] demonstration so that's what the
[2:40] manifestation is a demonstration of the
[2:43] existence reality or the presence of a
[2:47] person you know like the very person of
[2:50] Jesus
[2:51] Christ so now may the person of Jesus
[2:55] Christ uh come out of the pages of the
[2:57] Bible this morning
[3:00] and greet each and every one of you and
[3:04] drop
[3:05] fire a portion of his being in your
[3:11] soul as he passes through
[3:15] you so you can say surely the presence
[3:19] of the Lord is in this
[3:23] place
[3:25] oh
[3:27] Hallelujah okay you know like the very
[3:30] person son of Jesus Christ which was
[3:33] nailed down April 25th that's what I was
[3:36] doing I was nailing down the very person
[3:38] on the fourth
[3:40] line amen so now Ain going to happen

[30:28] upon me because the Lord hath anointed

[31:28] Isaiah 611 and2 is where our Lord was
[31:30] reading from but in the middle of the
[31:33] second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped
[31:36] where it says the spirit of the Lord is
[31:37] upon me to preach the acceptable year of
[31:40] the Lord then he stopped why the other
[31:42] part to bring judgment didn't apply to
[31:45] his first coming but his second coming
[31:47] see it didn't apply there how the
[31:49] scriptures never make a mistake they're
[31:50] always perfect Jesus stopped just where

[1:09:53] they just blew the Trumpets the Rams
[1:09:56] horns and they March
[1:09:59] around and up on Jericho look at these
[1:10:03] fools marching around here seven season
