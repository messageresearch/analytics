TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well let me go straight to the word Saint Matthew 17 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and general around his brother and bringing them up into a high mountain apart amen but no worship here a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his faith faced did sharing as the Sun and his raiment was white as its delight and behold they appeared unto them moles in our lives talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make it here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias while they yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen last November 3rd this was my inspiration and from Saint Matthew 3 this is my beloved son who are well pleased hear ye him that was 4 November 3rd but this one hear this my loving son who and well pleased that was it but here is added three words this is it the option dear adoption so you might understand the difference same anointing the one is there placing in an authority jesus was a God prophet sent according to all the Scriptures and he was set in Isaiah 60:1 how he opened the eyes of the blind and cast out devils and he did all that he was obedient to his father then he took up on the mountain signs and wonders Americans followed him took on a mountain and there he had something else for him to do he was going to die for you and I he had the authority from God to die for you and I he was adopted it was positionally placed in the position that he was born for to be our king to be our Lord to be our Prince to be our Savior to be our healer to be our all and all he had the authority to do so amen that's why he was adopted there didn't last long he went straight to Calvary and this won't last long amen they'll think the close you down but it'll be there amen second Peter finishing up now second Peter 1 verse 4 into an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that fadeth with - first Peter aim whereby given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by Elysium might be partakers of the divine nature you see what it is now is through the promises you partake of the nature and there's no way to get out of it see having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue denial and in virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience patience godliness to godliness brotherly kindness loyalty kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren you know idle unworking unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may God the blessing read I was worried it's a word of Prayer I have only father what a day we've had here Lord oh my god we don't know what to say so much of everything Lord and then we could go home nouns and our cup runneth over amen I've spoken to them close to an hour and then I'm mighty outpouring from Europe they've seen it and heard the other testimonies and they all gathered here together and so far lord I pray again at you strengthen the brothers the the ankles and knees and their backs Lord and then Laura died pretty I don't be here too long you let the fire fall amen praise God praise His name father note me now Lord God hallelujah with charity the word to anoint these virtues Lord to pour the Living Word of God into the living people amen praise God bless the reading of the word those that don't have the Holy Ghost father made a holy spirit baptize them today those who are born again may they be refilled amen though that need healing may just heal them wherever they are let's the reading of the word and the hearing of the word and may you bless it to our hearts we'll be careful father to give you all the praise honor and glory for we answered in Jesus name and his seat say Amen you may be seated praise the Lord well Amen brother Norman I'd like to take a title the manifestation of the fire baptism of charity right now it's got to come and I'm looking for it I don't know whether you are now but I'm looking for a man my subject position Lee placing of a son into the position of authority amen so my inspiration here and I'd like to take this opportunity to greet all the ministers here in American candidate and West Indies and in Trinidad and Puerto Rico and Europe and Africa Nigeria and Ghana and the rest of and getting letters from Uganda where ETI men used to be and getting letters to go over there and whatnot and then down into South Africa and South America or anywhere I want you brothers no one appreciates you but you stand for standing for malecon for inspiration and may God pour out charity in your groups and seal everybody up in there and adopt them all praise God for we another season so feel that charity is here and the raising of the debt and all these things only thing I can say on this third phase come and rejoice with us praise we all rejoice the Amen so my inspiration is this is my beloved son who aren't well pleased hear ye him okay now so we won't get you all caught up here and in case you didn't understand all these years and what brother brand was talking about and after he had the preacher guy Amen that night after the think statue of a perfect man and now he brought it back so they would understand on page one don't forget now always remember this and this is you people with the Holy Ghost you see and all that's gonna receive it there are the things that builds a servant of Christ see faith first then virtue and now I'll remember the Holy Spirit at the top right cannot kept the building of God on these things are what operating by the spirit when the world is message is operating by the spirit in they don't even know that the seven thunders is their promise let alone let it operate and begin to add those virtues up but how we thank God for charity point out praise God what is charity here for now to operate your seven virtues to give it power to give it a parent amen praise God two and two pair amen you may be seated until these things that are operating by the spirit and I just always bother me as well where in the world is the spirit to operate these virtues and no matter what you do those are the things that builds the body of Christ see those thing now don't forget that that this year's first your faith virtue knowledge and so forth is to be added to it until the complete statue of Christ is made manifest in other words if you get these seven virtues they have to be manifested even before charity comes upon it because charity will not come upon it unless it's manifested by manifested the people themselves will see your God life and you don't roll up full of patience and temperance and they know it you're full of power are you pray for them once and they got healed amen you're full of faith the people must see this manifested in the church here and no matter what they said to you man a woman you forgave them manifest it see you're growing up now you're on the third phase we can lay these things down to the whole church this may never happen again but you're here today now these videos being recycled back will mean something to you amen so get that the Spirit of Christ has got to be here and it's here to manifest these seven virtues that God can see it operating by his Spirit can't be nothing phony now how they live it now little dreams and things that put them in and a piece of them together that's nothing that the word this is the word hallelujah the word must be operated oh Christ has made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body these things must be there for jesus said by the fruits they are known see fruit you could not bear fruit without these things to bear it in you and then when all this takes place of takes the place of worldliness and ungodliness and so forth then all that belief is cast down then all the things the worlds pass away then there's nothing but a new creature in Christ and then there's Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption sealed into the kingdom of God hallelujah now don't forget that keep that in mind now takes these things first watch then the sealing is the Holy Spirit that kept that seals us into the body see we another age prior to the Prophet you could have been baptized in the body he was in the body after the profit coming brought the word you're just getting started you gotta add that's this bride season now louia Prescott oh now my burden for 28 years amen hair has been to show the New York City portion of the bride her position in the word for this house it's been a rough time trying to do that now and second Peter 1 4 through 7 lays out the statue of a perfect man for the bride age you believe that a man and on such of a perfect man page 65 brother Graham really nailed it down he says some add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance now you see why I tell you people you don't you haven't entered in here yet the first the spirit had to come and I just come so how could you have been in there only thing could have been is human human virtues hallelujah cannot bless you that's human amen but you have a good heart if somebody gets sick you'll be there you'd be concerned and bring meals and things but it's still human somebody come down and you sleep um you know and feed them it's still human and it's not what are you talking about those are good works we talk about the word of God living through you amen semantic knowledge of knowledge temperance you temperance patience your patience godliness to your godless brotherly love do you probably love the holy spirit now I've been through this many times that's at the time and Christ will come Holy Spirit love Christ will come when that comes see beneath them is a virtues because now watch just beneath him the Holy Spirit now you've got the chart in your mind the Holy Spirit steps right over brotherly kindness and just beneath the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ Jesus Christ into the church to manifest those virtues in every age Paul arenas and Martin cut off right on up and then we had a promise for 25 years of dynamics to manifest these virtues but somebody had to climb and believe it and preach it is mine is mine is mine in spite of all the false anointed ones in the medicine is not yours it's not yours it's not yours you got it when you believe it but by the grace of God we've climbed a mountain and praise God charity is here pouring out across the world now you understand what's going to understand the message now hallelujah yes sir so they are Church the Holy Spirit must be here in the church manifesting these virtues virtue power must be in here amen come into your prayer to let you begin to add these things you got knowledge to know all these little phony things going on that's knowledge you don't go for that stuff amen so just beneath him the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Christ Jesus Christ into the church at manifestoes virtues and we know by experience and promise in Revelation that and to brotherly kindness charity was at a June night so we know that November 30 we've seen the promise preached and taken in the debt was already raised after that was raised then the thing was laid out to you yes sir now you know the three stage is just picking up after cross you're born again the blood is dripping down on you you die to everything you feel like a criminal a miserable wretch that we are and we identify with Jesus Christ and then we are saved born again new birth hallelujah glory to God then we power puts us up on a cross and then we hang that's called on the cross what did you want to add and said virtues what are you doing there amen you're growing in the virtues in what are you doing there they're being birthed in yes sir but you got to have trials and tribulations first in order for there to be a problem there amen for you to manifest the virtue when the problem comes up and God knows how to design the circumstances design every problem to pull what he wants to pull out of he'll the only a job relatives whoever he'll bring up a problem maybe need some more temperance and he'll bring it up Amen somebody get real that you a something brother you got temperance hang back yes sir easy you're going to have this eyeliner I'm not telling you how long is it gonna be hey hallelujah all the babies will be gone yes sir so then pick up the cross after then God sees it operating did he seals you or capped you then you come off that cross and put it on your back and you become a cross back you walk in a footprints of Jesus Christ yes the woman has power to overcome her husband's faults husband has power to overcome his wife faults they come to church together and sit together and rejoice together and shout together they don't need a ride in separate cars hallelujah that's a good one there huh Holloway they didn't love one another they can't be with one another's presence amen praise God well we got it at the cross on the cross pick up the cross November third just recapping the back three great things Frank number three New York City did was raised up him a third Cherry anointed seven virtues by virtue powerful service cherry release virtue power into our church to get power to born-again believers they had the virtues it's already started amen this is your place of trying test it child train and tutoring 2nd Peter 1 4 through 7 the virtues of Zandi now you in a place of trying do you understand how many a raise your hand you got to hold it ghost without the Holy Ghost and you get the Holy Ghost where are you where are you adopted no place of trying Amen you're being tested you're being proven and you're on the cross yes siree now the virtue number one must grow into you number two the virtues must be percent to you number three the virtues must be added into you yes sir for this place of cheering you need the spirit of Jesus Christ into the church you need to dynamic to your mechanics yes sir back into the church as was promised by Malachi afford to manifest the seven virtues what shall we do with Jesus called the Christ there's 29 coat amen the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure see you see that refilled it coming a little measure that we worked in 83 and trying to work it couldn't get anything out of out of it hardly a little small measure well therefore the time name has come praise God amen what you work in a small measure or refilling is coming praise God to enable you to give you power to climb that mountain yes what we what we work in a small measure in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body the dynamics is the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is charity which releases the power of the Holy Spirit into the church as faith and then many in here sitting here without faith I know that you got mental faith you tried everything you could but you couldn't make a check because God's got to give it to you what you put you there I mean hey amen now to hear it the Holy Spirit is here with the power this is from perfect faith page 10 but you haven't got that faith to move it see what I mean it takes faith to move it now can you imagine in this message perfect faith brother grant 1963 he told people in the message the Holy Spirit is here with the power but you don't have faith the mood to pound now he had just told them in the seventh seal messages seven thunders gives you that faith and then again they still don't get it he told them that the Holy Spirit is here with the power you don't have the faith to move the power and left it there but the seven thunders gives you faith to move the power if there's no other terminology there's no other faith it's all or nothing so in the message brethren you might as well come to it this is your day I reckon you might as well recognize your day and your message praise God amen hallelujah that we having a wonderful time up here in New York City glory to God [Applause] yes now perfect faith maybe see the page 10 perfect faith see I'm a perfect faith now when they can make perfect faith with them seven thunders that go through there yes sir perfect faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he's come upon us and he said there's the brand of Tabernacle today there's a church today there's the bride today no faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit

that's the Emma that's a good way there huh yes siree place the trine is also you're holding a man you heard about man speaking about Hornung okay restoration the Priory page 68 he asked them to tarry in the city of Jerusalem Saint Luke 24:49 until they would do with power from on high and there he gave birth to the tree the Holy Ghost Pentecost justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and watch and then Christ come to dwell in it to bring forth the fruits amen is that right crisis number four and these ministers don't get it the capstone Christ number four he has mechanics and dynamics and the dynamics twelve to bring forth the fruit that came in through the mechanics so you see if they don't preach it this just the right way they still won't get hit you got to get their mechanics in there all these years though word then Christ the dynamics of the word he comes in to bring forth the fruit yes sir amen and he said so here on spoken words original seed I mean uh was the restoration of Rattray on the page 76 just bringing it back to you the fourth light is the combat will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it many counsel leads clapping hands with joy rejoice in Pentecost what but listen the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh and when you on that cross you know what's happening to you huh on that cross faith is a word from Paul amen that becomes flesh amen Virtue's the word for marina's that becomes flesh amen knowledge comes from Martin that becomes flesh praise God and so on and so on and so on the word is becoming fresh in you on the cross the Word made flesh but in order for you to get the words if it made French the man that's anointed in the pulpit it's got to have virtue and knowledge up on him he gotta have the living virtues to pull the Living virtues into you praise come otherwise it's just a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal thank God thank God for jointed ministry praise God yes sir amen you got it now the word made flesh fruits of the fruit of the Resurrection sign that crisis finally at the justification been planted sanctification had been planted Baptist the Holy Ghost organizations dying out and Christ has again centered himself like the cap on the pyramid he sells

what happens in 1991 huh Martin a November 17 what happens praise God what is it the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same Ministry of with the same kind of ministry that he had when you went away did you get that on the cross dying out honed our faith home virtue home tempers and patience that got hold out that you might go up to charity and be sealed by the camp that you might fit with the same kind of minister to bring up the dead in Christ praise God so you have no more turn tooling around here on this earth praise God you got to move on hungered and thirsted and moving on yes it's becoming clear to you Loreena caught him in a maybe scene it went away catch the whole thing then he same kind of Menace that he had when he went away then when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in a rapture where they're justified sanctified the Baptist the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life is growing again oh okay yeah it wouldn't be wonderful song about New York City what's going on up there the house of God is living again the Tree of Life is living again hallelujah glory to God amen yes sir so we got amen okay we got the first line justification in the coming of the camp hold it goes much being home down that so they can fit we got that place of trying honing testing tutoring proven and and growing birthing the virtues into you honing then after God sees the seven virtues tested and proven so I'm going back and forth so you don't miss it then he positionally places the proven tested matured son that has been seized and our child train tutored behavior everything else then he adopts them well I'm a sign all the baby stuff leaves the church huh what I did and what I didn't do is gone yes sir [Music] alright place of trying testing proving honing tutoring place of a mature placing of a maturity son positioning placing of a son into the position of authority now it takes the Holy Spirit to pour faith into us for a bath so I know many of you won and will win them I don't get the Holy Ghost well the Holy Spirit got that's what cherries in for cherries got to do it nobody else can do it but charity amen that's the way I got it Holy Spirit poured down to me faith that I was born again yes sir you gotta do the same way to you yes sir but all these all intellectuals will tell you that you got it when you believe it and you know that any soul yes sir all right now it takes the Holy Spirit to pour faith into us for a birth because it comes from above not around here nowhere amen so therefore talk on the words 1953 Chicago brother man is talking what will bring faith to the people Malachi 4 was speaking about a revival and wrapped in faith cool great outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the lassies last days and that's the thing that will bring faith into the people this great outpouring of dynamics is the thing that will bring faith into the people who stood with the mechanics for 25 years or so that's the thing that'll take a wrapped in faith that'll take the church into glory unquote so now we see we need a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit which is cherry the capstone you just saw it on the video they're just pouring out how that's what you need and what's going to be in the groups and hallelujah just pour it out yes siree glory to God now Malachi 4 said the same thing about the Holy Spirit given faith where you say it from you said it on blasphemous names Amen on page 22 and so many in the message have so much mental faith they get all mixed up but they believe but it's mental because they asked the elders all kind of question not sure but the holy cook now Holy Ghost man he doesn't answer any questions he has the answer inside it's in the word now tell me who can I go to ask question for my mind battles well you don't think I have mine battles you I have my embattled but I can't ask anybody here I have to get on my knees and pray [Music] ain't got nobody am I gonna go to these ministers out there get out of here eww let's go I can't go there yes sir amen all right blasphemous names page 22 and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word brings us into a mental recognition of God like Peter and enhancing but if this is coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes just cherish you're so poured out on the video there and you've seen raise the dead that's coming from above that ever strikes are consecrated sanctifying person sitting here I mean so lot to the world that Jerry ever strikes them yes sir how are ya Loreena car Oh hallelujah praise cut amen but this coming from above ever strikes this this is a godly spiritual faith then what does it do it was what does that faith to that faith recognizes only the word know all these cuckoo things disappear yes I see that good both of the church in this one all some kind of cuckoo thing there yeah you know faith yeah that's mental I just go on it doesn't even mean nothing there's no seed ain't meant from the word ain't gonna do nothing so I I just watch it let it go a man raised but see faith only recognizes the word no matter what anybody else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word it worried but with God and the Word was God and in the word still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself watch is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes our spiritual revelation Lord that you would pour down the charity into the mental faith in his church and let it become a spiritual faith supernatural faith hallelujah glory to God and when it's pointed out that our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation and a pundits foundation I'll build my church see you're not upon a mental conception of Church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when them streams of grace is pouring from sister chiapas dream internet mental faith and that you've got then upon this spiritual revelation I'll build my church and the gates of the hell can't prevail against it I'm ssome one of the tapes I said that it would prevail but I didn't mean to say that because it can never prevail against I think it was on charity Amen that shows that they would be against it but it'll never prevail oh what a glorious thing oh now you understand what conditioning with mental faith uh all these years mental going through the Deacons and going to the elders please help me pray it's mantle that ain't get didn't anchor in there you got fate they got here on a chest don't have to ask anything praise God is faith revelation yes sir alright he is 23 to 23 and now in as an individual these these virtues and things are knowledge and temperance and and is added to our faith then watch when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together you will have a building full of seven virtually and then that the whole is really gonna cement it you can't run a razor Bay through there oh my god praise God submit it together there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short you see so therefore oh my now what do we have coming from the Holy Spirit page 23 a man now coming from the Holy Spirit what has come then he will give you supernatural Fame spiritual fame then here at the bottom I mean the bottom which would be faith down there then that spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what else any of anybody else says it don't do no good I got a revelation I got a dream it don't do no good what is the chaff to the word what is your dream to the word that don't do no good not in the word time yes sir Oh hallelujah glory yes sir then the spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good don't only it only knows the word somebody say the days of miracles has passed that faith only knows the word the days of America's has never pass a man cries out the symphony is that right why because you know the sheet music praise God hallelujah [Applause] yes oh holy Lord yes sir we honor mark now praise God all these mental faith people are big

baptism the Holy Ghost they've been saying in that faith only knows the word that's real spiritual thing and that's why we've stood against these guys there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost because it only knows the word yes praise God that's real spiritual faith you see that's right you only know the word then number one coming to your mental faith right here watch coming to your mental faith here today let me put it that way comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental faith making it a spiritual faith then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word and may God grant you every one of you with mental faith to go out of here today with spiritual faith then you become a real Christian hallelujah no way you come from knowing who your father is praise know you ain't no high bred new

get you on this fifth message I'm trying to bring I'm bringing a promise in now there's something not even baptized yet but this is your ultimate promise coming in here hallelujah that the peril caught might arrest in this place the true word has got to be here amen amen coming down yes sir now charity is here to baptize you with the Holy Ghost baptism amen Jared here to seal up your seven virtues by the fire baptism of charity amen from your faith up to your Holy Spirit see you in with Christ then you become one amen and after your seven virtues of sealed by the fire baptism of charity then you become vindicated in place and when that time takes place aim and they become vindicated sons and daughters of God hallelujah amen what happens to you when you are vindicated sons and daughters of God then you are positionally this position replacing of a son into the position of authority yes sir amen yes sir positioning placing of a son into the position of authority now I'm going to review it let's review this inspiration back to you that you might understand your position in the word for this hour I'm taking this time out to do that amen all right number one born again now we got spiritual faith now we can climb place up try and add the virtue is honing placing up a son number three sealed by charity by the fire baptism of charity okay number twenty page 23 here now speaking over here page 23 debar now do you remember when the book of matthew seventeenth chapter i just read it this morning the fifth verse Jesus on the Mount Transfiguration here you him the sermon I just about a year ago preach that become so popular the he him the placing of the son in Ephesians 1:5 also God has predestinated us unto the adoption of sons this is what I was striking no Ven third now watch see I'm a rehearses bactine I should be finished when a son is born into it it's the son but that someone had tutors to raise it and that son never did come to be the right kind of a son and he never become here but if he was the right son and that song would obey his found them that the son was adopted or placed positionally he become heir of what the father had and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had proven to be the right kind with the Pharisees and Sadducees and stood his ground as a word cast out devils healed of sick did everything right kind of a son a man character before pal yes sir Oh hallelujah yes sir hmm oh my god yes sir stood all temptation he took him up on Mount Transfiguration it always shattered him you know any Old Testament they took a son dressed him in a pretty nice pretty common set him out before the public they had a ceremony of placing or we call it a Topton in Galatians they I kind of think st. Paul refers to the dumping of sons amen now by placing ministers will understand in spiritual Bible readers our placing of this son in other words the son was a son when he was born how you see in natural life and some become more I don't know what roustabouts the father has the father weeps over him it wants him to put him in the business that's only a natural thing when what about him all those Rockefeller Zordon people they don't trust nobody else they want their own sons to be in charge it's like mr. Maxwell down who was in charge his sons that's part of his blood you part his blood hallelujah one more Pharisee to be in charge of his house one no false-9 I want to be in charge of anything glory to God he might give them iron weaves yes sir may be seated there's where Pentecostal people made their mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost same one that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor we're gonna talk about now and away to all these years to get up to this spot and I'm here and now I can arrest yes Amen God has predestinated us unto the adoption of son that's what he's done for us as in Ephesians born tutor then adopted into the body of Christ correctly what you are you do the work of a pastor you do the work of the Evangelist you do the work of an apostle and so forth but then it coming you then you go on off the mountain you go everywhere because one day when he positions you into the what you are correctly are in the body and what's the robe on you you can write the check oh god the interpretation of the name is a manifestation of the name and the thunders is in Jesus and Jesus ascended up on high and after he had overcome and conquered and received a new name and descended with a shower with his new name and they say brother Brad I'm could speak and do things as a sign and they said where the thunders and it be revealing the thunders with his new name I mean be revealing the thunders hallelujah can you imagine Jesus what a message waiting for some son was to come on and stay old beat into that word bringing him on bringing them on to over 25 years get him and get all the way down to what charities born out then the dead begin to be raised and the thunders this time for a seventh on the revival just about that time some of them are adopted with all authority my god in the name the new name is in them because Christ is in them hallelujah praise God you pray for them now but then you come man the come out commend the devil to come out hallelujah glory Takata all right yes sir here we see a sunny the Sun when the Sun is born - it is the Sun but that Sun had to does it to raise it that Sun never did be the right kind of son he never become here but he but he was the right Sun and the Sun that would obey his father you know going the old group of a group just saw just obey hey a man just do that a man praise God seem to upset you or something they meant Oh Oh be diems and I think acts 5:32 to get the whole it goes to them they will beg him that's the Bible yes sir brother Bram said so on the tolkien obedience tells you the whole token you know kicking all the stuff out the house and all that kind of stuff and that Sunday I would obey his father then that son was adopted a place positionally he become heir or what the father had and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proven to be the right son and it stood all temptations he took him up on Mount Transfiguration and overshadow him you know in the Old Testament they took a son dressing a nice pretty garment set him out before the public they had a ceremony of placing and we call it adopting in Galatians they I kind of think Paul st. Paul refers to it as adopting sons now by placing a son ministers will understand I was here before replacing his son in other words the son was the son when he was born all here yes where I was then there's where Pentecostal people made their mistake yeah being born into the family by the whole he goes that's right but then they must be the right kind of son to turd and that's the way I'm trying to get you here on the cross to it by the guy to be the right kind don't be like a Pentecostal who won't take buzzsaw Pentecostal go by their dreams and feelings and what they feel but a bride member goes by the Word of God amen that's why you can't adopt any penny counsels all right be up on the mountain now praise God now you know just when the stage 25 was adopted a place into the family already a son went out and did his father's business took his sheep and everything had to take care Holy Spirit say your son's doing good you said he not given iron weights down there he's getting on the right thing oh he's coming along watching for about a few years the I comes along seizes him out all kind of trials and testings and this one just believe the church he's still there Amen whole group wants he's wrong still there I love them more people come in yes siree so five go out and fifteen come in praise God that's happened you know Laurita caught that son is still going on yes siree whether they like it or whether they don't like it you laying it down yes sir somebody must be pleased the father's pleased and I'm here to please the father okay if someone's adopted a place in the family his name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was they had a ring in them days a signet and he spit on it and made of spitting sound and hit the pulpit and this was a signet that was just he wore his daddy's ring his big signal and that was just as good as his daddy's now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus the guard God placed him positionally this is him and Windham here it is again now and as I'm finished with this here now when a member is born by the Holy Ghost do you understand it those within their mentals you need to get spiritual faith and be born again then you have to go on the cross and has proven to have these virtues in him no one's nothing I could see so don't be all nice around me but he's watching you brother Coleman's let me shake her hand I kissed her Wow we have to see that Amen if I never see that praise huh that'll mean anything to me but he's see if you don't shake the hand hey hey man he hears everything you say yes I'm not even looking to see it amen yes sir and proven to have these virtues in him that God can see virtue knowledge see what God must see in you not me temperance patience brotherly kindness and God is in him then God seals him or places him and there that's when you see sons and daughters of God then Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealing to the day of your Redemption your own life proves you haven't got it until this is there and God has adopted you and sealed you by the Holy Ghost into his kingdom then there's no getting out of it your eternally secure grieve not the Holy Spirit of God went by you all your godly you and your godly virtues are sealed until the day of redemption I believe there's a prime that's predestinated I believe God said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination the bride is predestinated she's got to be there I hope I'm with her see I'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with God is up to you to work out your own salvation not prey away this tensor temptation come to the lsah pray it away it's a blessing for you to work it out yes sir glory or tell us a mind some spiritual brother pray with me in my trial that's fine - amen Oh help me work out my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God and then sealed into the kingdom of God there's a Holy Spirit there's a genuine work of God if seal until the day of redemption and now therefore she does that when the church come to the place or individual the church is going to be there let me see it real good to you so you get it the church is predestinate to be there I want to be with it but the only way I'll be with it is to be part of it how do I become part of it by being in it how do I get in it by baptism one spirit one Corinthians 12:13 by one sphere we all baptized into one body amen that's how you going to get in here now but you can't stick these little things that I spoke with tongues I got it you go out here angry and swear and carry on see just putting in peacock feathers the old the jaybird you can't do it your own life proves that is not but when these things are operating in you by God then your seal

of a son and daughter of God will place you in authority like Jesus is early Brian in Malachi for this is my beloved son and who aren't well pleased hear ye in him on a message called hear him Phoenix Arizona 1960 March 13 Amen now I don't forget the old I'm finish musicians see finish Amen now church don't forget the order borne by the Holy Ghost into the family and spiritual faith comes in place of trying tested to the child trained seasoned out obedience behavior honed sanctification justification sanctification baptism holder goes then the coming of the camp and the capstone is charity but what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being home doubt to fit with his ministry and you honed by the mechanics from his word and in that word is a promise for dynamics praise God and your home by the seven virtues the voices and the rest of it that God can see seven virtues tested and home and in you and power to be there then a camp seals you by charity the Holy Ghost itself into the kingdom of God vindicated placing of a son adopted in place positionally a placing of a son positionally watch what he is in the body of Christ Ephesians 4 now if that son is proven to be a right kind of a son love the father's business state right with his give me a soft key for he touched me hallelujah [Music] stayed right with his vindicated word from His Prophet Malachi for for this age then that son is taken out to a public place and placed positionally and given full authority and the kingdom of God otherwise other words he can write and sign the cheque for anything Jesus he did it the Alpha bride did it Malachi for did it he's out there and there are examples quote hear him but don't you remember when brother Brandon went west and met seven angels in a public place and the seventh angel with swept-back wings to return back to Indian and open the seven seals for you have already been given the Kings sword all authority spoken word he was adopted and he came back and opened the word oh praise God Amen he said first full little birds second Pole Holy Spirit doves third Pole angels what's that mean at option time Oh hallelujah seven angels and there you are you didn't climb right on up there my god don't you want to be that how many want to be there all wonderful church amen Jesus okay quote hit him read the quote the same tall arrested in Jesus Christ rest in the place son in the body of Christ placing of a son took him out to certain place had a ceremony before angels and placed him positioning what he was in the body of careers in the body crimes then the person has authority this is what happened to Malachi 4 before seven seven angels I just said it returned with authority open the seven seals and he had the Kings sword in all power and authority so don't you see what our church with our this is Amen now I want to quote from hey a.m. and I finish Phoenix Arizona quote now you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of Sun and God took him up on the top of the mountain but witnesses are out there heavenly witnesses and earthy witnesses and he clothed him in immortality when they looked up they saw they said his garments shine like the Sun a supernatural something had taken place God placed them placed on him the robe of immortality showing it he received him that that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth someday he'll call your side Church if you will obey Him and stand on the word and believe in here place into the church all the powers that Christ had in him we'll be in the church all that God was important to Christ and all that Jesus was he pours into the church God wanting his work done you send it in to the son the son want his work darling sent to the church at that day you know that I'm in the father the father mean an eye on you and you and me at that day because the same power and us is in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power that rests in Jesus Christ rests in the placed sons in the body of Christ placing of the son how many understanding now while you are honing and proving and testing you don't have all the power here because he's testing you you can't stop devil sometime it happens see it happens but when you get over here to a place son it happens all the time like like Peter number acts 5 12 through 16 the lady in the shadow every one was healed everyone yes the placing of the Sun so I can't leave you down there with mental Fame the Holy Spirit here to pour into your mental faith make a spiritual thing so you seek God or hunger than your thirst in you can't leave you had a born-again experience cuz after you're born again hunger and go on go on to perfection go on to a tough don't hang there and then we'll be waiting here until the last one is adopted praise God you won't have no fear about California sinking you won't handle fear about nothing because you're not even from here you've been baptized into the kingdom of God by charity and you just win for a few more turns and you're going away the theophany is calling you [Music] took him out to a certain place had a certain wonderful age of the places in positioning what he was in the body of Christ then that person has Authority let me say this if you count me a finale from this night on and me from this day on the very thing that I was thinking of would be done there'll be a power coming to the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit was so anointed people till they'll speak the word and it will create itself like that we haven't seen powers come into the church now I know for a fact say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say shall come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in the position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut oh my what critic can come against Jesus it'd be a short time Jesus can run out the mountain went straight to Calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here he touch me
