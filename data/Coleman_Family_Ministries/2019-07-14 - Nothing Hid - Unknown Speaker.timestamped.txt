[0:00] now I want to turn to Acts the
[0:03] eighteenth chapter our first service
[0:05] brother Peregrine he was telling me feel
[0:08] a little bit odd in a new place and sure
[0:11] do saw they've gotten used to 3054 hd491
[0:27] through 11:00 after these things Paul
[0:34] departed from Athens and came to Corinth
[0:36] and found a certain Jew named aquila
[0:39] born in Pontus lately come from Italy
[0:43] with his wife Priscilla because that
[0:45] Claudius had commanded all Jews to
[0:47] depart from Rome and came unto them and
[0:50] because he was of the same craft he
[0:53] abhorred with them and wrought for their
[0:56] occupation for by they after patient
[0:59] they were tentmakers any reason a
[1:01] synagogue every sabbath and persuaded
[1:04] the Jews and the Greeks and when Silas
[1:06] and timotheus were come from Macedonia
[1:09] Paul was pressed in his spirit and
[1:11] testified to the Jews that Jesus was
[1:13] Christ and when their poles themselves
[1:16] and blaspheme he shook his raiment and
[1:19] said unto them your blood be upon your
[1:21] own hits I am clean from henceforth I
[1:24] will go unto the Gentiles and he
[1:25] departed thence and entered into a
[1:28] certain man's house named justice one
[1:30] that worshipped God whose house joined
[1:33] hard to the synagogue in Christmas the
[1:36] chief ruler of the synagogue believed on
[1:38] the Lord with all his house and many of
[1:40] the Corinthians hearing believed and
[1:42] were baptized then spake the Lord to
[1:45] Paul in the night of a vision be not
[1:48] afraid but speak and whole not by peace
[1:51] why I'm with thee and no man shall set
[1:53] on D to hurt thee for how much people in
[1:56] this city in revelation 22 13th verse
[2:03] 12th verse rather and be more come
[2:06] quickly and my reward is with me
[2:09] to give to every man according to his
[2:11] work as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[2:15] Omega the beginning in the first end the
[2:17] Lance
[2:18] blessed are they that do His
[2:19] commandments that they may have right to
[2:21] the Tree of Life and may enter in
[2:24] through the gates into the city for
[2:26] without are dogs and sorcerers and
[2:28] whoremongers murderers and idolaters and
[2:31] whosoever loveth and maketh a lie i
[2:33] Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[2:36] unto you these things in the churches I
[2:38] am the root and offspring of David and
[2:41] the bright and Morning Star and the
[2:43] spirit and the bride say come and let
[2:45] him that heareth say come and let him
[2:48] that is athirst come and whosoever will
[2:50] let him take the water of life freely
[2:53] may a lot of blessing to the reading of
[2:57] his word just about 5 minutes
[3:00] exhortation on scripture here on behalf
[3:03] of the dedication service here Paul here
[3:08] we're reading here in Ex the 18th
[3:10] chapter here have been preaching up here
[3:13] and the Holy Spirit he had had made him
[3:18] come out real strong to tell the Jews
[3:21] that Jesus was to Christ and that time
[3:23] it seemed like it was time for a change
[3:25] it was God's purpose for Paul to change
[3:28] at this time and this also was the the
[3:32] founding of the Corinth Church here in
[3:36] the book of Acts the 18th chapter and it
[3:38] says here and I think is the ninth verse
[3:40] then spake the Lord to Paul and night by
[3:43] a vision be not afraid but speak in
[3:45] whole nut dry peace and I'd like to
[3:48] bring it over to here to our day here in
[3:51] New York City here we have a vision also
[3:53] of the Indies a seven sealed prophetic
[3:58] vision brother Branson entire message
[4:02] and Paul here God gave him favor
[4:06] with his man just as here and they set
[4:09] up a house of worship and it was a
[4:12] temporary house of worship for it lasted
[4:14] here about a year and six months but God
[4:16] had a purpose in that city he had souls
[4:18] there and so God's will what the setup
[4:21] a house of worship there temporarily
[4:24] because there would be and as we know
[4:26] from the Word of God Solomon's Temple
[4:29] was also temporary all churches all
[4:31] places worship of God are temporary
[4:34] because the real temple of God is
[4:36] described over in Revelation 21 coming
[4:39] down from God out of heaven and that is
[4:41] the New Jerusalem that's why we all
[4:43] sitting here hoping that believing that
[4:47] we will one day be in that place and
[4:50] when that is set up on the earth all
[4:53] temporary places of worship will fade
[4:55] away and brother we are really looking
[4:58] for that day and so we filled all that
[5:01] we would like to act in this temporary
[5:06] house of worship the same way that we
[5:09] would act in New Jerusalem if that could
[5:12] be so while we're waiting to be in that
[5:15] New Jerusalem well that is why we are
[5:17] here we have come out of the world we
[5:20] have confessed that we are not ashamed
[5:22] with the gospel of Jesus Christ where
[5:24] there's a power of God unto salvation
[5:25] and just to give you a little quick
[5:28] history of this church in January to 6
[5:32] 1963 in my hole up in the Bronx New York
[5:35] there this church was born on January 2
[5:39] 6 being down in Indiana to services in
[5:42] Jeffersonville and while the prophet of
[5:46] God was speaking a message serves this
[5:49] is the time the Lord spoke to my heart
[5:52] doing that service doing that time that
[5:54] day say going back to New York and start
[5:57] the church and that being January 6 1963
[6:00] and their brother honey and myself it
[6:02] was God's will that we would start this
[6:04] church at that time for the Lord had
[6:06] already given us about 40 or 50 people
[6:07] from about August 62 we were just having
[6:11] Saturday night prayer services and the
[6:13] people they were flocking and so that
[6:15] was the start of this church and in June
[6:18] 7 1964 we felt led to leave the Bronx by
[6:22] God for God had expanded our borders and
[6:25] we went down to 41 West 35th Street we
[6:29] would call a stable so to speak and
[6:31] there we
[6:33] I knew we didn't know at the time but we
[6:36] know now what what God's purpose was at
[6:39] that time and as the message began to be
[6:42] revealed to our hearts we realized that
[6:44] we were ripening and maturing we
[6:47] realized that God was doing a unique
[6:50] work in New York City in that he was
[6:53] taking different ethnic groups and
[6:55] nationalities and different colors and
[6:58] putting them together in a staple so to
[7:00] speak where there were no stained glass
[7:02] windows no saw a nice pews and nice
[7:05] things to look at and just a little old
[7:07] room there and a rickety old stairway
[7:11] and the ceiling coming down and ceiling
[7:13] leaking and whatnot and there he would
[7:15] put the Word of God it was his purpose
[7:18] that they wouldn't could have anything
[7:21] anything beautiful to look at for Jesus
[7:25] was divins no beauty in him to be
[7:27] desired of the natural carnal man
[7:29] natural : man looked on Jesus and on
[7:33] that cross all beaten and spat upon and
[7:36] bruised they saw no beauty in him to be
[7:41] desired and the Word of God made fresh
[7:43] is the same way here in the end time it
[7:46] seems like church people people out in
[7:49] the street they don't see nothing to the
[7:50] Word of God at all but to that believer
[7:53] that has slipped beyond the veil where
[7:56] the glorious never failed it is
[7:58] beautiful beautiful wonderful words of
[8:01] life and their God perps in our heart to
[8:05] preach the Word of God realizing that he
[8:09] had he was going to have a bouquet of
[8:12] flowers and he was going to a tear down
[8:15] men's natural ideas what they think and
[8:19] he was going to bring forth his will and
[8:22] he picked up brother hunt and myself saw
[8:27] the crude I'd say but willing and to let
[8:31] God speak through us
[8:34] by His grace and there we purpose in our
[8:36] heart to say what the word said that's
[8:39] all just say what the word said and
[8:41] those of you who are sitting here now we
[8:43] know you took a a brutal beating
[8:46] thanks be to God here every one of your
[8:49] sitting here this morning and so
[8:51] therefore on many things happen here we
[8:55] have many beautiful memories of what
[8:57] happened on 41 West 35th Street the
[9:00] gospel was preached from the side of the
[9:03] message itself was preached of the end
[9:05] time and also speaking of the second
[9:08] coming of the Lord and and the great
[9:10] revelations of the message and there and
[9:13] God confirmed the word signs followed it
[9:16] even the Dead was raised Devils were
[9:19] cast out and the sick was healed at
[9:21] forty one West 35th Street and in spite
[9:24] of all the opposition and and men's
[9:28] ideas about it as to what they thought
[9:30] by the grace of God we we are here this
[9:32] morning which we give thanks to him and
[9:36] we praise him for it so now as Paul said
[9:39] here as the Lord spoke back the pole
[9:41] here it was at this season now and this
[9:43] year I believe is the seventh year since
[9:46] the Lord seen fit to take brother
[9:48] branham off the scene for many not
[9:51] understanding the message that he had of
[9:53] the end time and I believe it was a man
[9:56] down here in Florida he puts out a
[9:58] little radio news I think his name is a
[10:00] Brubaker something like that well he
[10:04] puts out a radio news flash
[10:05] and he cold with a radio I think was
[10:08] family radio he made a statement that he
[10:10] never understood brother Branham but
[10:13] everything he has said has come to pass
[10:15] and it's really amazing because he sat
[10:18] there in the March 1963 meetings and
[10:21] never understood it but today this past
[10:24] week he went on a radio and said the
[10:26] things that the prophets spoke about in
[10:28] the end time everyone that he has said
[10:30] has come to pass and so we can say amen
[10:33] to that
[10:34] for that is the own reason why we are
[10:37] existing here in sitting here in Forest
[10:39] Hills is because of that message and
[10:42] that message alone we're not here
[10:44] because we feel that we are ministers of
[10:47] God and God has called us and we know
[10:49] the Bible no we are here solely with a
[10:53] one purpose that God would so anoint
[10:57] lips to tell every man woman and child
[10:59] that this is the end of the world and
[11:01] there's no hope for you except God has
[11:05] made a way out for you that is true the
[11:06] message the Ark of God that he has
[11:09] dropped down on the earth in a form of a
[11:11] message a prophetic message and he is
[11:15] calling for all of us to enter into it
[11:17] to be to be safe from the plagues that
[11:20] are falling all around us so I would say
[11:23] then that as the Lord told Paul here no
[11:26] man can hurt thee for I have much people
[11:28] in this city and God has seen fit to
[11:30] bring us here to Queens and our third
[11:33] move which is now and so we feel that no
[11:37] man can hurt us it is God's purpose set
[11:40] there are souls out here in Queens and
[11:42] Brooklyn around here we have proclaim
[11:45] the message in the Bronx Manhattan and
[11:47] narrow Queens this is the third move for
[11:50] us here and we feel that this is the end
[11:53] this is the last one we don't feel it is
[11:55] much time left and so we want to be
[11:58] honest and and earnest and everything
[12:00] that we're doing we want to state our
[12:02] purpose here that we intend to preach
[12:04] the gospel the Word of God from this
[12:07] pulpit here and it would be dedicated
[12:09] and consecrated to the preaching of the
[12:11] word the spirit of bride say come come
[12:14] to the real message of God that God has
[12:17] dropped down st. Matthew 10 the 10th
[12:23] chapter says do not fear man I want to
[12:26] read it to you I'm headed down here for
[12:28] the thought st. Matthew 10th chapter the
[12:33] 26 verse fear them not therefore for
[12:36] there is nothing covered that shall not
[12:38] be revealed and hid that shall not be
[12:40] known when I tell you in darkness that
[12:42] speak ye in light and what you hear in
[12:44] the ear that preach ye upon the
[12:46] housetops he's saying here do not fear
[12:49] man so as to hide unwanted truth other
[12:54] words truth that comes forth in maybe uh
[12:57] you feel it maybe that they won't
[12:59] understand because man the man will
[13:02] understand and you don't want to hurt
[13:03] his feelings but the Lord Jesus is
[13:05] saying here don't fear man what I have
[13:07] told you of this secret revelation
[13:10] from God speak it in the light in
[13:13] evening light say it if you have to go
[13:16] up on the rooftops and those days they
[13:17] had flat roofs where they used to speak
[13:20] from and therefore speak it from the
[13:22] rooftops well God we don't have to go up
[13:24] on a rooftop God has given us this
[13:27] beautiful sanctuary here to preach the
[13:29] Word of God for from and we're not here
[13:33] to defend the word see we're here to
[13:37] preach the truth we don't have to defend
[13:40] the Word of God see because if you think
[13:44] a caged lion needs you to defend him if
[13:49] an enemy comes against him in that cage
[13:52] all you have to do is to open up that
[13:54] cage and let that roaring lion out he
[13:56] needs nobody to defend him so I don't
[14:00] think your brother and myself have to
[14:02] defend the Lord Jesus Christ well he's a
[14:04] roaring lion all we have to do is loose
[14:07] him and let him out and he will take you
[14:11] himself in his word so we only here to
[14:14] bind and to loose we're here to lift the
[14:17] Lion of Judah out for our believe it was
[14:20] Amos said back in Amos the second
[14:24] chapter I believe it is I want to a call
[14:28] it right Amos 2nd chapter 7 verse surely
[14:37] Lord God will do nothing but he revealed
[14:39] his secret unto his servants the
[14:41] prophets the law the lion have roared
[14:43] who will not fear the Lord God hath
[14:47] spoken who can but prophesy who can but
[14:50] prophesy when his eyes their eyes are
[14:54] anointed to see the things happen in the
[14:57] end time and to see an answer for the
[15:00] things that are happening in the end
[15:01] time and the love that God has set forth
[15:04] abroad in our hearts as Peter said for
[15:06] we cannot but Speak the things that we
[15:09] have seen and heard and neither can we
[15:11] hear and so we are perps in our heart
[15:13] today that in dedication and waiting for
[15:16] this Tabernacle to appear on earth that
[15:18] we will speak the things from our heart
[15:21] that we have seen and heard
[15:23] and now I want you to turn your Bibles
[15:25] to Saint Matthew to fifth chapter
[15:29] everybody comfortable where's God I'm
[15:34] going to read from the fifth chapter of
[15:37] st. Matthew the 14th verse through the
[15:40] 16th verse in st. mark 422 and Song of
[15:45] Solomon the sixth chapter the tenth
[15:47] verse while you're finding the places
[15:51] I'm starting at st. Matthew the fourth
[15:56] the fifth chapter the 14th verse ye are
[16:01] the light of the world a city that is
[16:03] set on it on it and he'll cannot be here
[16:06] neither do men light a candle and put it
[16:08] on the bushel but on a candlestick and
[16:11] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[16:14] house let your light so shine before men
[16:17] that they may see your good works and
[16:19] glorify your father which is in heaven
[16:23] st. mark 4 22 well there was nothing
[16:28] here which shall not be manifested
[16:32] neither was anything kept secret but
[16:34] that it should come abroad Song of
[16:38] Solomon is sixth chapter 10th verse who
[16:41] is she that look at forth as the morning
[16:44] fairy azzam clear as the Sun and
[16:47] terrible as an army with banners
[16:50] may the Lord our blessing to the reading
[16:53] of his word I like a tireless little
[16:56] thought nothing hid the world of today
[17:02] would be much better off with all the
[17:06] anguish and sickness and pain perplexity
[17:11] meaning no way out for the things men's
[17:14] hearts failing them for fear of the
[17:17] things coming upon the earth and it
[17:20] seemed like they are not stopping there
[17:23] getting worse and worse and yep the
[17:27] world goes right on in its unbelief
[17:30] thinking that it has the answer through
[17:33] education it has an answer through
[17:36] science and that they can bring about
[17:39] peace through the political machinery
[17:41] set up man-made machinery and yet there
[17:45] is no peace for the Bible says when they
[17:48] shall say peace Paul sent cometh sudden
[17:52] destruction so there can never be any
[17:54] peace for the Prince of Peace has
[17:58] declared that these latter days are the
[18:01] days of terrible trouble days of
[18:04] tribulation and persecution therefore
[18:08] they can be no peace he is the one as to
[18:10] come back and set up his peace here on
[18:14] the earth well he made a way out of the
[18:17] perplexity and and and the anxiety he
[18:21] made a way out that we might receive
[18:24] Jesus Christ and and have the peace of
[18:28] God and many think this is something
[18:31] that world is just some some holy and
[18:35] sanctified preacher talking about and so
[18:37] forth no it is real for I said here that
[18:40] as Jesus said here that this scripture
[18:43] here or the world of day would be much
[18:46] better off if only men of all faiths
[18:48] would recognize a basic truth which
[18:52] Jesus spoke and he said here in st. mark
[18:54] 4 22 for there is nothing here which
[18:57] shall not be manifested neither was
[18:59] anything kept secret but that it should
[19:01] come abroad where are far reaching a
[19:06] powerful effect this indisputable
[19:10] statement or would have on mankind if
[19:13] they could universally accepted well we
[19:16] know that they cannot accept the Word of
[19:18] God only all that the father has given
[19:21] me will come it is only those who are
[19:24] predestinated to receive the Word of God
[19:26] into their heart with meekness that are
[19:28] going to receive this here the evildoers
[19:32] would tremble in their ways once they
[19:35] were convinced that they could not
[19:37] possibly get away with the evil doing
[19:40] but they're seeing
[19:42] there's nobody to convince them that
[19:44] they will not get away with it but the
[19:47] Word of God says that they will not get
[19:48] away with it and it is up to the
[19:50] preaches of righteousness to preach that
[19:52] word that way and not to compromise with
[19:56] the stream of life which is flowing
[19:59] toward this way in that way of
[20:02] compromise and so on but I was thinking
[20:06] just think what could happen if the
[20:09] church could take description to heart
[20:12] other words could be so earnest in pure
[20:16] through the Word of God that would hide
[20:19] nothing to brother and sister wouldn't
[20:23] have anything evil down in the heart but
[20:26] would anything come up with quickly
[20:28] confess that if God could ever get a
[20:31] church on that kindred spirit of that
[20:34] like mine well I believe that our great
[20:37] wonders are wait to be performed in the
[20:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he
[20:44] says depart from iniquity when we are
[20:47] coming to the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:48] Christ who ever let him that names the
[20:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ depart
[20:53] from iniquity no one to do good and
[20:56] won't do it you see but therefore also
[20:59] wonders and signs and so forth can only
[21:03] spring from those who believe and are
[21:05] willing to act on their belief that when
[21:08] we walk with God no matter what height
[21:11] depth or nothing can harm us but somehow
[21:15] we have a habit of looking out outside
[21:17] and we just can't seem to believe what
[21:20] he said all the way he has a a
[21:23] triumphant role designed for the bride
[21:26] and there is going to be a people that
[21:30] is going to believe that and she's gonna
[21:32] leap over every wall out here I don't
[21:34] care what is in her way she's gonna like
[21:37] to chip break and forth into the sound
[21:40] barrier breaking on past it as we
[21:42] understand as he goes up there there's a
[21:45] lot of rattling and also rolling and
[21:47] whatnot and then it breaks out into
[21:48] peace and praise God if the bride could
[21:51] ever break past what man said
[21:53] and also unbelief and what this one says
[21:56] she'll get out there in the wild blue
[21:58] yonder and she'll really be resting in
[22:01] the Lord Jesus Christ and God said that
[22:05] he's gonna have a bride that is going to
[22:06] be conformed to his image
[22:08] she's already called she's already
[22:11] justified
[22:12] she's already glorified in his mind and
[22:16] Jesus saw in the gospel here and Mark
[22:19] the fourth chapter between first verse
[22:21] he asked a question is a candle brought
[22:25] to be put under a bushel or under a bed
[22:28] and not to be set on a candlestick he's
[22:32] asking a question here and in short I
[22:36] believe what he's doing here he's
[22:38] putting us on the spot see we Christians
[22:42] who by the grace of God have been
[22:45] ignited with a lick of fire we are
[22:48] keepers of the flame God has set over us
[22:53] and sent into us part of his spirit that
[22:56] means that we have received that lick of
[22:59] fire and as we sit here this morning we
[23:03] are supposed to have this spirit in us
[23:05] that part of that pillar of fire and
[23:07] it's supposed to as we move from one to
[23:10] another with nothing in the heart and we
[23:13] are supposed to be sitting here in
[23:15] heavenly places and as we would hear the
[23:19] word of God this morning we could be
[23:21] saying Amen and our hearts in giving
[23:23] glory to God and as we see the Word of
[23:26] God moving throughout the earth now it
[23:29] is kindling the body of Jesus Christ
[23:32] that has laid dead across the world
[23:35] shackled and fettered and many man-made
[23:39] great denominations and so forth but the
[23:42] Lord has sent forth the word to cut and
[23:46] set his people free
[23:47] even brother ogr and if different
[23:49] ministers here are bringing that word to
[23:51] places where people are getting free
[23:54] from man-made denominations and brother
[23:57] Georgia can tell you how the
[23:59] which is the fire is spreading all down
[24:02] through South America and also now in
[24:04] the world but it goes on any way it is
[24:07] kindling the body of Jesus Christ as
[24:10] they laid there and the fire is coming
[24:13] to them to set them free jesus also said
[24:16] ye are the light of the world a city
[24:17] that is set on a hill cannot be hid so
[24:21] therefore let your light so Charon that
[24:25] they may see your good works and glorify
[24:27] your father which is in heaven while say
[24:30] this morning that the die is cast let us
[24:34] examine it further as he says here in
[24:37] st. Matthew here the fifth chapter near
[24:40] the fourteenth verse ye are the light of
[24:43] the world
[24:44] plus three other set on a hill cannot be
[24:46] hid neither do men light a candle and
[24:48] put on a bushel but on a candlestick and
[24:51] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[24:53] house that you're right
[24:55] so sharing before men that they may see
[24:57] your good works and glorify your father
[24:59] which is in heaven the purpose that is
[25:03] stated here for all good works is that
[25:06] anything that we would do in word or
[25:09] deed it would glorify the father that is
[25:12] supposed to be our purpose for existing
[25:14] there is supposed to be our purpose for
[25:16] living here in this world system here
[25:19] and he said that we are the light of the
[25:22] world in the the world of the universe
[25:26] there's the Sun the moon and the stars
[25:28] and therefore lights the Sun is the
[25:32] great light which types out Jesus Christ
[25:35] and the moon is types out to church to
[25:39] reflect the light of the Sun and the
[25:41] stars a little in the visual believers
[25:44] shining bright in the nighttime and that
[25:48] is supposed to be what we are supposed
[25:49] to be doing now as individuals shining
[25:52] forth our rights and as when we when we
[25:54] come together as a church with a
[25:56] brilliant light of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:58] what Jesus is saying here he's telling
[26:02] us here in man's world system here on
[26:05] the earth the stars are right there but
[26:10] we are right
[26:11] yeah in the because cosmic world system
[26:15] here the system of men men's social
[26:18] system regardless though we have to live
[26:20] here we are still lights in this world
[26:23] and Jesus is only trying to bring us
[26:25] light that it made that if made because
[26:28] I reflect through us then we might
[26:31] reflect him in his word to the social
[26:34] system here set up by man and to
[26:37] understand what he means here by a
[26:39] candle it's not a candle as we
[26:43] understand a wax candle this is not this
[26:46] this here means an oil lamp in those
[26:49] days they had lamps made out of clay
[26:52] brass silver a goal and it's like bowls
[26:56] and they put a wick into the hall
[26:59] because of the olive all that rather and
[27:01] that was called a candle and we would
[27:04] think of it as it being a wax candle but
[27:07] it is not it is it was a vessel with
[27:10] olive oil in it and a wick in it and it
[27:13] was to burn and he is typing us as these
[27:16] lamps that we are to have our wicks
[27:19] saturated into oil and the fire on the
[27:23] other end and the candlestick is not a
[27:26] candlestick it is a lamp stand the lamp
[27:29] stand like this so high and the bowl set
[27:32] up on top of the lamp stand and the wick
[27:34] was in the bowl and so he was seen here
[27:37] that the we are not to have the lamps
[27:42] under a bushel nor under the bed he save
[27:47] us praise God to put us in some old
[27:51] institutional Church somewhere beneath
[27:53] of some bed or in under some bushel out
[27:57] in the world somewhere but he saved us
[28:00] are we getting through to shine as
[28:04] lights that is the purpose here we are a
[28:09] chosen generation a royal priesthood
[28:12] that we should show forth the good
[28:15] praises of him that has called us out of
[28:18] darkness into this marvelous light there
[28:22] sole purpose and being here to glorify
[28:24] him and you know as a type which I can't
[28:27] go into too much here but in any Old
[28:29] Testament most of you have read of the
[28:32] tabernacle of witness and in they had
[28:34] because they had three compartments the
[28:37] outer court the holy place and the most
[28:39] holy place and the holy place was the
[28:42] dr.xu bread and the lampstand and altar
[28:46] of incense and as we know it was Israel
[28:49] and the twelve tribes of Israel and on
[28:53] the shewbread table was twelve loaves
[28:56] representing each tribe and Aaron and
[29:00] the Levites was of the Levitical
[29:03] priesthood and I'll just say it to you
[29:06] you Bible scholars know the scriptures
[29:08] and so forth but the elements signified
[29:11] the tribe of Levi and numbers of 3:39
[29:16] there was 20 mm male Levites and if you
[29:21] go back and check your scriptures you'll
[29:22] see that there were 22 bowls
[29:25] shaped like almonds and 22 flowers and
[29:28] 22 knobs
[29:31] also on the lamp stand there in the
[29:34] light on the lamp stand was to Israel
[29:38] the light that burned in the holy place
[29:41] was the law it was signifying the law of
[29:44] God the Ten Commandments which was given
[29:48] to Israel in their tabernacle Psalms 119
[29:51] 18 says thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[29:54] and a light unto my path and the way it
[29:57] was every of seven years the the law the
[30:01] light was red and represented by a lamp
[30:04] on a lamp stand and there was on their
[30:08] lamp stand there was seven lamps on
[30:10] there and representing seven seven years
[30:13] but in in the law of Israel the seventh
[30:17] year was a year of rest and point to the
[30:20] millennial reign of Jesus Christ and
[30:22] they were told
[30:24] to have seven readings every seven years
[30:28] every seven years they wants to read the
[30:32] entire law and this was to happen seven
[30:35] times in seven times seven is forty-nine
[30:36] years and at the end of the 49 years
[30:39] they would have the fifth year which
[30:41] would be the Jubilee and the entire law
[30:44] prophesied of Jesus Christ thus we see
[30:47] at the lampstand as represented a tribe
[30:50] of Levi priests mind you were holding
[30:54] forth the light of that law which was
[30:57] the light and they were prophesied of
[30:59] the coming of the Messiah the Levites
[31:02] were to present the truth and we know
[31:06] today the lampstand today has moved over
[31:10] here into the seven church ages as we
[31:13] understand it and we are at the end of
[31:16] the seven churches and we know also that
[31:19] there has come forth a message of
[31:22] jubilee all those who have been bound by
[31:26] a system they don't have to be slaves to
[31:29] this world here they don't have to be
[31:31] slaved to some church for this Turner at
[31:34] the end of the seven for the entire Word
[31:37] of God which was represented back here
[31:40] every seven years all over here at the
[31:43] end of the seventh church ages the
[31:45] entire Word of God wants to be open as a
[31:49] light to shine into a dark place and it
[31:52] was to be prophesied and reveal play was
[31:56] the mysteries that God had hidden in his
[31:58] heart sealed up with seven seals over in
[32:01] the book of Revelation but he said that
[32:04] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[32:06] except he reveal his secret to his
[32:08] prophet so therefore God has allowed in
[32:13] the end time here or a prophet of God to
[32:16] come forth and to bring out these
[32:18] secrets for there can nothing be hid for
[32:21] God has a purpose for it to be made
[32:23] manifest and here in st. mark 422 Christ
[32:28] makes it clear that previously hidden
[32:32] the truth will be completely revealed
[32:35] that so that all might see and it's in
[32:37] this very agent Laodicea and revelation
[32:40] 3 he says anoint your eyes to see and
[32:43] what would he have light for if he
[32:46] wouldn't have our Deen eyes to see the
[32:48] light and we're so happy this morning
[32:51] that God has anointed our eyes to see
[32:54] the light here in the end time and Jesus
[32:58] uses here the illustration of the lamp
[33:00] Carol not to be put under a bed some old
[33:03] church somewhere or under some bushes no
[33:06] sir it is to be put up on the lamp stand
[33:08] and the lamp stand is the candlestick
[33:11] and that is the church represents the
[33:13] church so therefore our lamps which is
[33:16] our candles should be burning bright as
[33:19] ever in this seven church age a lamp
[33:22] stand or candlestick that was God's
[33:24] purpose for it to be and however we
[33:28] should have we should be today like a
[33:30] Gideon's 300 for they have lamps because
[33:34] kovalyova and pitchers and in well
[33:37] tonight amen to fight the enemy and the
[33:39] right time they break their pictures and
[33:42] their lights begin to Sharon and he
[33:44] began to blow their trumpets and cry out
[33:47] the soul of the Lord I believe that we
[33:50] are in the same time here this little
[33:52] type here we have we should break our
[33:54] pictures that the people might see the
[33:57] light amen and will the trumpet of the
[34:00] gospel that we all free when your son of
[34:03] man is set free is free indeed
[34:05] amen and we can put our swords and cry
[34:08] out the sword of the Lord
[34:09] this holy Lord the people are wandering
[34:12] and all perplex of one of what is going
[34:14] on
[34:14] but Gideon's 300 they know what's going
[34:18] on
[34:18] the Lord shall return and discern
[34:20] between who serves God and who doesn't
[34:23] serve God the wise shall know there
[34:26] - mighty exploits in ovarian when the
[34:28] people of feigning by the wayside in a
[34:30] very high where the people are perplexed
[34:32] and don't know what's going on God said
[34:35] that he would have a bride a man whose
[34:37] lamps would be burning who's Lance would
[34:40] be shiny a man whose legs were being
[34:42] pawed at seven churches there would be
[34:45] anointed to see and to understand to
[34:47] proclaim the Word of God healing in time
[34:50] and God has told us he has revealed to
[34:53] us fear none man a mess we could tell
[34:58] about these things here don't worry
[34:59] about it I'm backing you up
[35:01] I have much people in this city I am
[35:04] sending you forth the spirit of bride
[35:06] says come whoever first whosoever will
[35:09] let them come to the waters of life
[35:11] freely Amen we know who we are who is
[35:14] she
[35:15] praise God as Solomon said back here in
[35:17] there the because tenth verse here who
[35:20] is she had look at forth as the morning
[35:22] fair as the moon clear as the Sun
[35:24] terrible as army of badness I say that
[35:27] that is the bride today praise God for
[35:30] she looks forth as the morning other
[35:31] words to the world the church system
[35:35] today it is one big dark long night but
[35:39] this says here Solomon has spoken here
[35:41] that there is somebody praise God that
[35:44] is looking forth as the morning there's
[35:46] somebody that a hope
[35:48] praise God has fell into their hearts
[35:50] and somehow God has brought peace to
[35:52] them amen and they know that
[35:54] look forth as the morning in other words
[35:57] they can look for for a new day for God
[36:00] has revealed to them that they can look
[36:02] forth to being the day of Jesus Christ
[36:04] amen they don't have to worry about the
[36:07] system here and what's happening here
[36:08] they know who they are and over here
[36:11] even over here in the Matthew 25 here
[36:13] there's two types of church people there
[36:16] is the foolish and it was the wise both
[36:19] claimed it to be virgin both claiming to
[36:22] be bride both looking for the second
[36:25] coming of Christ going forth but how can
[36:27] you tell
[36:28] both Ham lamps one has the original
[36:31] right that never went out and never will
[36:33] belong amen
[36:35] for it come from the altar fire and it
[36:38] was lit in the first stage the second
[36:40] age the 30s the fourth the fifth the six
[36:43] and a 1 come out with a extra blow a a
[36:46] bowl of oil that we might dip our weeks
[36:49] into that one was Malachi 4 make to meet
[36:53] sure that our lamps would not go out God
[36:57] in His mercy Amen drop down on a bowl of
[37:01] oil praise God that we might take extra
[37:04] business with us for the Bible declare
[37:06] that the wise took extra vessels besides
[37:10] their own lamp which is a candle they
[37:12] took an extra vessel and I would imagine
[37:15] it was filled to the brim with oil for
[37:18] this message is overflowing I can't find
[37:21] no pots no missiles to turn it up well
[37:25] just come in as coming please cut it's
[37:28] coming from the animals inside it is
[37:31] fully like a river of rushing water just
[37:33] flowing out here it is here it is god
[37:36] himself brother we know who we are but
[37:39] how can you tell here and the other one
[37:41] has a lamp on soul but it doesn't have
[37:44] any extra oil it is going forth in this
[37:47] hour without the message trying to meet
[37:51] the bridegroom it is going forth in a
[37:53] worldly condition please God and he and
[37:58] they're going forth they don't have a
[37:59] revelation of what they are supposed to
[38:01] be doing and their wicks are all smudged
[38:04] up and also encrusted and whatnot and
[38:07] what she is needing is for God to take
[38:10] the golden tongues and those golden
[38:13] snippers to sniff out that those wicks
[38:16] there and because trim those whoops
[38:18] because wicks down that she might burn
[38:21] and dip those wicks in the oil where you
[38:25] saw God amen and therefore the the
[38:28] foolish carried no extra vessels withal
[38:30] and in dainty vessels where it bowls I
[38:34] want to read something here in closing
[38:35] and say something here feel a little bit
[38:39] better now praise the Lord
[38:44] Zechariah you want to turn to it
[38:47] I want to lean us on here and close our
[38:49] within here
[38:50] does that karai the fourth chapter
[38:53] speaking about this vision here of the
[38:56] candlestick here an angel that talked
[39:00] with me came again and what and wake me
[39:02] as a man that is waking out of his sleep
[39:04] and said unto me what sea is now and I
[39:07] said I have looked and behold a
[39:09] candlestick all of gold with a ball upon
[39:12] the top of it and his seven lamps
[39:14] thereon in seven pipes to the seven
[39:16] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[39:19] the two olive trees by it one upon the
[39:22] right side of the bowl and the other
[39:23] upon the left side there up so I
[39:26] answered and speak to the angel that
[39:28] talked with me saying what are these my
[39:31] lord then angel that talked with me a
[39:34] she answered and said unto me Noah
[39:35] not what these be and I said no my lord
[39:39] then he answered and spake unto me
[39:40] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[39:42] zoo revolt saying not by might nor by
[39:45] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[39:48] hosts who art thou old great mountain
[39:51] before serval thou shalt become a plain
[39:54] he shall bring forth the headstone there
[39:56] with shoutings crying grace grace unto
[39:59] it and we see here that there was a lamp
[40:04] a candlestick of gold a bowl has the
[40:08] candlestick like this on a top was a
[40:09] bowl which was a a reservoir here
[40:12] because for the oil and seven lamps up
[40:15] on the top of that and seven pipes to
[40:18] the seven lamps and there was seven
[40:20] wicks down in the pipes
[40:22] and these two olive trees here we
[40:25] believe to be Moses and Elijah because
[40:28] to the Jew and it was a large bowl and
[40:31] essential to seven ohms that could come
[40:34] out of it and the bowl was filled with
[40:36] olive oil and which flows through the
[40:38] seven wicks placed into seven arms and
[40:41] it's the same all that burns and it
[40:43] makes the light at the end of the seven
[40:45] pipes and then light never went out for
[40:47] the priests went into the sanctuary and
[40:49] a poured oil into the bowls and the
[40:51] wicks kept burning in the lamp and it
[40:55] was lit in a special way you fire over
[40:58] your 7:38 the the priests took the fire
[41:02] from this special holy altar sacred
[41:05] altar rather which was originally
[41:07] lighted by the fire of God and he lit
[41:09] from that fire to the first lamp and
[41:11] took the light from the first lamp and
[41:13] lit the second and so on and so on until
[41:15] the last lamp was lit and then the holy
[41:19] fire from the lamp pass is a wonderful
[41:22] type of the spirit in the seventh church
[41:25] ages when the holy fire of God fell on
[41:29] the day of Pentecost and in that fire
[41:32] went to Paul and
[41:34] lip T Ephesus church and Smyrna and
[41:36] Pergamus and right on down to the last
[41:38] age but we are promised at the end of a
[41:41] each that would come forth a messenger
[41:43] and we would he would bring forth the
[41:45] same fire at the head in the first one
[41:49] when they first fell in the original
[41:51] outpouring of Pentecost and we find
[41:54] today then that there is a hidden life
[41:57] and there is a visible life now there's
[42:01] a hidden life in God and fed by the Word
[42:03] of God and I believe that God has had a
[42:08] bride hid away for the past seven years
[42:11] of soul hidden in this hidden life and
[42:14] fit by the Word of God but I believe
[42:17] narrow that the time is right where God
[42:20] is going to make this bride visible and
[42:23] then the visible life which is dynamics
[42:26] is burning and shining given light and
[42:29] manifestations of the Holy Ghost and all
[42:32] day or we are looking around where is
[42:35] that that additional fire that the seven
[42:38] lamps drew from and the light and the
[42:41] life from the oil in the main bowls and
[42:44] I feel today that as Israel in Zacharias
[42:48] vision here those two olive trees were
[42:51] standing there continually all the time
[42:54] pouring oil into that main bowl that
[42:57] those wicks would never go dry and I
[43:01] feel that in the seven church agents
[43:03] that there were seven stars in each age
[43:05] that poured oil into our bowls that they
[43:09] would never go dry and I feel that we
[43:11] have received a messenger in the last
[43:13] day here that has poured the original
[43:16] all back into the bowl and there is no
[43:19] need for any woman church to have a dry
[43:23] wick when the oil is free the oil is
[43:28] here whosoever will let him come there
[43:32] is no need to have a dry
[43:34] life when the original life is here to
[43:38] be made manifest to you for the
[43:40] messenger has come forth with the holy
[43:42] fire from the altar and is ready to pour
[43:45] upon you through the Word of God and we
[43:47] know that our wicks which types because
[43:50] our lives one end of the wick was dipped
[43:53] in the oil and the other end of the wick
[43:56] was burning and therefore our lives
[43:58] should be constantly dipped in the Holy
[44:01] Ghost oil and the other end of us should
[44:04] be constantly burning for Jesus Christ
[44:06] it should be set on fire in this age but
[44:09] we are individual lamps on a candlestick
[44:12] and the last versions today or drawing
[44:16] from the main bowl that's why if they
[44:19] wonder or what do you have she has she
[44:22] is drawing her oil from that message and
[44:24] her lamp her wick rather is burning and
[44:28] notice that God is a consuming fire and
[44:31] is God's purpose that if our life is the
[44:34] wick then the wick should be consumed by
[44:37] the fire and as God's purpose that our
[44:40] lives should be consumed by the fire of
[44:42] his word and it is his purpose to bring
[44:45] his word to our wicks to burn it and
[44:48] that is why we have instruction and
[44:51] correction in God's house that we might
[44:53] know how to be in this last day and
[44:56] brother I tell you our wicks should be
[44:59] dipped in the oil of Jesus Christ in the
[45:02] end time here as we see the hour now
[45:05] perching us we know that the wheat has
[45:08] laid here oh I'd say about seven years
[45:10] of salt ripening and maturing in those
[45:14] who haven't because come out with which
[45:17] he relations they are wondering and
[45:19] waiting for the promise of God to be
[45:23] made manifest and yet we know that when
[45:26] that we turns from a green to a golden
[45:29] brown and yet though it be a mature
[45:32] there's still a little short period
[45:35] before harvests where the wheat though
[45:38] mature and ripen yet is still wet and we
[45:44] know then that the only thing I can dry
[45:46] it out that it might
[45:48] Manifesto ripeness of Jesus Christ is
[45:50] that dynamics and we know it'll take the
[45:53] dynamics of God to dry us out consume
[45:57] our flesh by the fire from God's altar
[46:01] and I'm quite sure all of you here or
[46:03] this morning or waiting for this here
[46:05] for Zacharias that it's not by might
[46:08] collective power and denominations and
[46:11] so forth not by power of force but by my
[46:14] spirit saith the Lord and his spirit is
[46:17] the oil and it is the oil that is doing
[46:20] it today and we can praise God for the
[46:23] wick itself has no oil it has to be
[46:26] dipped into the oil and it has to burn
[46:28] so we praise God to know that he is now
[46:32] in his office performing through his
[46:35] word applying it in power to our hearts
[46:38] that we and we should cherish the
[46:41] Ministry of the word the ministry that
[46:44] comes to us for instruction and
[46:47] correction and reproof painful though it
[46:51] may be is painful a lot of times we have
[46:54] to be stripped but what a privilege is
[46:57] ours in the last days here that God is
[47:01] going to allow us to be lamps to burn
[47:05] for him and as we bring the real
[47:10] apostolic doctrine the Alpher the light
[47:13] to a world enveloped in midnight
[47:16] darkness out here Jesus said is said
[47:19] over here in the deep Erebus of the
[47:22] convergence here in the ninth Prince
[47:25] Bokar bleed 1/6 verse and midnight there
[47:28] was a cry made behold the bridegroom
[47:29] cometh and friends two groups went out
[47:34] to meet the bridegroom in this hour both
[47:38] churches and one church was dry didn't
[47:41] even know they saw to believe God
[47:43] intellectually in their mind they have
[47:46] the only idea what of the way they think
[47:48] God should be and the other group or
[47:51] they have the wicks dipped in the
[47:53] message and they have no thought of
[47:55] their own they're having a message in
[47:58] the message tells them what God is
[48:00] so therefore and then that is what they
[48:02] Express and therefore many cannot
[48:05] understand that many cannot understand
[48:07] how or you can just come out from among
[48:11] the unclean thing and want to burn for
[48:14] God well there was a great man of God
[48:18] then hear me Martin
[48:20] he said when he reached the shores of
[48:22] India many years ago missionary I
[48:24] believe he was he said now let me burn
[48:27] out for God and he burned out in about
[48:30] six years what he left behind a cousin
[48:35] incredible because achievement the Bible
[48:38] translation in Indian language was left
[48:41] behind him but he burned out for God and
[48:45] I was wondering this morning to finish
[48:47] up that if we could understand and get
[48:52] to real purpose why God has called us
[48:56] here this morning and why the Lord has
[48:59] given us this beautiful sanctuary here
[49:02] in Forest Hills for I believe with all
[49:05] my heart
[49:06] in Revelation 10 at the word of the Lord
[49:09] as John spoke there is to go before
[49:13] kings nations and multitudes as it has
[49:17] gone in the form of a ripened seed in
[49:21] letters and I mean in book rather spoken
[49:24] word books and tapes and so forth Bobby
[49:27] that there will be one more ride and I
[49:29] believe that he will come and he will
[49:31] wherever the seed has gone he will come
[49:34] right behind it and ride this trail once
[49:36] more I'll be able to become with all my
[49:38] heart but I want to say I feel this here
[49:41] that as we sit here this morning and we
[49:44] are dedicating this building back to God
[49:47] do you really understand do you realize
[49:50] what it is for it is for God's purpose
[49:54] there are much people in this city there
[49:56] are those here in this city here in the
[50:00] message perhaps maybe because they don't
[50:02] see eye to eye but the Bible says that
[50:04] the ministers and the people will see
[50:07] eye to eye I believe with all my heart
[50:11] I'll be there he'll take the dynamics of
[50:13] God to bring this to pass in our lives
[50:16] and I feel that here the scripture saith
[50:21] that the spirit and the bride say come
[50:24] revelation three message was given to
[50:27] one man to a rebuke deed of
[50:31] denominations and call out a Brian that
[50:34] was his message I don't see another
[50:36] messenger coming in that line but I do
[50:38] see a Brian because that same spirit is
[50:41] to come up on that bride and to say out
[50:44] through us come well for people here in
[50:47] this city here around here and it's
[50:50] boring here rather in anyway because you
[50:52] may be for them to come to you you've
[50:54] got to have something they can't just
[50:57] come to something dry they have to
[51:00] adjust to a church building here they
[51:03] have to come the Greeks of saying we
[51:05] would see Jesus the Greeks were looking
[51:08] for Jesus they wanted to see this man
[51:10] that manifest its love and manifest the
[51:12] power of God and the people out in the
[51:15] street here are wanting to know of what
[51:18] can we do
[51:18] where can we go everything is upside
[51:21] down and nobody knows what to do and I
[51:23] believe in this very hour that God is
[51:26] going to ignite some lamps and set them
[51:31] on fire and be a real witness and a real
[51:35] testimony in this city here of this
[51:39] message here and I'll read it with all
[51:41] my heart do you believe that praise our
[51:43] God and the Song of Solomon says here
[51:46] it's already here to you who is she a
[51:48] look at forth as the morning there is
[51:50] some clear as the Sun in terrible as an
[51:53] army with banners who is she where is
[51:56] she the moon the Sun banner I believe
[51:59] that she is a people that has been
[52:03] called out of every denomination from it
[52:06] from every walk of life and I believe
[52:09] God has set her down and he is she is
[52:12] like she is going through the time of
[52:15] burning burning out all the infirmities
[52:18] getting her ready riping her maturing
[52:21] her and getting her ready and where is
[52:23] she's in every nation under the Sun I
[52:25] believe with all my heart and I believe
[52:28] that she is shining now the message of
[52:31] God in the mechanical form for or
[52:35] without him she can do nothing for we
[52:37] know that we can add to our faith virtue
[52:39] patience temperance godliness brotherly
[52:41] kindness and knowledge and we can do
[52:44] that and we have that now and yet we
[52:47] fail but take heart this morning charity
[52:52] never faileth and I'm waiting on that
[52:55] charity never faileth I have the message
[52:59] and I have virtue I have faith I have
[53:02] patience knowledge and temperance and
[53:04] trying to manifest brotherly kindness
[53:06] and so forth but yet I feel every day
[53:09] but I feel that when charity breaks
[53:11] forth when the fire the full of that
[53:14] fire breaks forth then that bride will
[53:16] never fail she will have thus saith the
[53:19] Lord or she'll keep still bleeeh with
[53:22] all my heart I bleed as sure as she has
[53:24] in her now the shout of victory but as
[53:26] Joshua bid it Israel shout when I say
[53:30] shout praise God so therefore I feel
[53:33] that when the Lion of Judah is ready to
[53:36] tell her to shout she will speak and who
[53:39] can but prophesy for the lion hath Lord
[53:42] I'll believe that this joy in our hearts
[53:44] this morning for there is a river of
[53:47] water as from the animals being that is
[53:50] flowing out of her
