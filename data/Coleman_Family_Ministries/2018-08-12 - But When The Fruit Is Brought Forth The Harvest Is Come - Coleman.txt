about this morning I don't know it's the best way it was there so that's very good so we are very thankful for this day see we got to have the rain if we don't have the rain then the mass I cannot gather its fruits see so we have a rain inside spiritual or there won't be any fruits for the harvest we have to have a rain on the outside we won't have a natural harvest and we gotta have the rain

or that or ripen mature cream number four I'm talking about another word Amen the message the term hallelujah glory then the harvest has come my messages but when the fruit is brought forth the harvest is come some prophesy amen Malachi 4 has sold every seed in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation can you say amen amen [Applause] did you receive the new books yet 7 church changes and the invasion of the USA amen praise got everything right on time seven churches page three so you know what I'm talking about paragraph 17 and preaching now or you can jot it down there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration amen say and sway it out there in places that's that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught so you know like a seventh under inspiration well Ralph will fall upon here and they're not everybody in the message just here and there and then they can preach it out there and sway them in those places you know 705 afraid swam Briscoe see but they are he said here now these men are not bringing anything new now no I'll see the teach already taught it's in books and forms everywhere that's why these men say get the seventh race changes get the service here so you know what I'm talking about I'll take the tapes of the prophet see cuz these men know that unless you have these seeds well they can fall a war on top of you you get a blessing in here you go outside your bank and money you better get him praise God see these men know that now they can pick up the word with inspiration and sway it out there in places that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught now you got to put some seed in first and then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word let us go and preach the word Amen so there are if the Prophet ordained me to do what to preach the word to water the seeds anybody around but they get mad at me huh hey man I'm ordained to do this here now don't get mad at me I'm only watering the seeds well you don't believe me open your Bible 1 Corinthians 3 amen and Paul said here's a three and I brethren could not speak it to you son to spiritual but as unto carnal especially fleshy even to babes and cries I have fed you with milk and not with me for here the two of you were not able to bear it neither yet narrow are you able for your night for year yet carnal for where's there's among Indians driver divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for wild one said I'm appalled I'm a powers are you not carnal see who thin it's Paul who is Apollo's see but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord gave to every man I have planted Paul said Apollo's watered but God gave the increase Malachi for planted we watered but God will give the increase God will bring forth the fruit so don't look at me but the Colemans now brother Coleman and say that he said with the with the Prophet said say brother Branham said here brother brems head Dale say brother Cohen said I'm
