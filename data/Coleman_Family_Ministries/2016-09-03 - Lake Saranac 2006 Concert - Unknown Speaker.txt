spirit amen a foretaste of what was to come amen and I believe that foretaste amen is what we are going to uh amen build upon this weekend but not a foraste but a full manifestation of what the prophet saw when he was in that camp he began to run he began to shout he into a vision he saw the young people he saw you he saw you receiving the Holy Ghost come on now he saw you being set free and

brother Stephan and myself we just want you to be able to be free tonight and enter in and just worship God With Us um but before we continue on with our program just want you to stand and we'll sing a little chorus of Lord you are so precious as we welcome our brother Leo do to the platform to officially open up the the meeting so just lift your hands and close your eyes as we sing back to him amen and just welcome his presence oh Lord you are so preious [Music] oh my Lord you are so prous to me and I love you yes I love you oh because you first love me oh oh and I [Music] love yes I love

[Applause] we praise you father we thank you Lord we give you all the honor and the glory that's due to your name father hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah thank you Father praise God well welcome friends um I believe that probably I don't even have to come here amen um what I heard I like what I heard and that shows me that you brought the Revival with you we just want to welcome one and all from all different places um and I believe to me my personal testimony I came with great expectation and um to me I was just thinking I said not could it be I believe that this will be the manifestation of the vision that brother brandham [Applause] had amen and if you can paint the picture in your mind and just think about I say see the pro the prophet on the mountain hunting just as a regular man that he was and just probably when that struck him I said I can imagine seeing people coming from Canada people coming from Tucson people coming from Nigeria forgive me but I get [Music] excited my God in Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania New York and see the the enemy tries to block even the sound system and little things like that don't let that stop your fire that's that's that's physical that's that's mechanical stuff I mean we try to do the mechanics the best we can but only he brings the [Applause] Dynamics [Applause] I just want to read a short portion of scripture in Acts chapter 2 and when the day of Pentecost has fully come there were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it fill all the house where they were sitting and there appear unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all now it it didn't say it was 118 and the other two just look no all filled with the Holy Ghost they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and I'm just here to encourage you and to tell you that it's always your attitude that brings the results cuz if you can remember I mean paint a picture I always think about Simeon I said he was a human being he was just in expectation he had the right attitude and God will never ever fail you if you have the right attitude I didn't say if you're in the right condition I didn't say that God doesn't care about your condition you can be you could be a drug addict you could be a prostitute and if you have the right attitude you will live change tonight God doesn't look on this he looks on your heart always remember that don't let the devil bind your mind like oh um man I'm really messed up I'm doing the wrong thing no you're not you're doing the the right thing cuz when you're sick you come to the hospital is that right so if you're not doing good that means that you got to come to church God didn't come for the saved ones God came for the unsaved ones I just want to read you a quick quote brother brandom said in the Supernatural I'm going to be very brief but listen to this but it is the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came cuz they got in one place and one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results see brother Brandon didn't say it's the condition you're in that brings the result it's even your attitude how you react even in your [Music] condition even if you don't feel like praying in God just respect it don't have like a I don't care attitude no just respect it and because your respect God will honor you brother Brandon keeps saying here you believe that he said let every man every woman in this building this morning and I say tonight boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you will see something happen that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the next morning is that right he said it's the atmosphere so I exort you tonight come and rejoice With Us Praise Him worshiping entering and I welcome you to the manifestation of the vision of the Prophet because it's here tonight is not a it's not a myth people say it's a myth you know what people say Pentecost Pentecost is not a Rel religion Pentecost is what you believe is an experience it's what you want in your heart you want to change and that's what we want tonight so you know what I'll push it even more I dare you to try God I dare you to try God I dare you to try him even once if God fail you never serve him [Music] again I will put my life I know that God is going to answer you God can God is going to answer you he's going to change your life every single one of you so enter in and you know what when you sing it's like when a boxer's going into a fight you just don't walk in there just like that you got to warm up you got to lose those muscles so when the Jabs come in you lose so do the same thing even you know what maybe you don't feel [Music] 100% that's okay do the best you can brother brandham said do the best you can for God even if your faith is this big that's okay God can take that and your eyes looks like this but in God's eyes is mountains a tree doesn't start from a tree it start from a little seed like this and you might not see the seed that's in your heart but he sees it you might think you don't have nothing cuz you know what we we look with these eyes but these eyes can't see nothing he see with his precious and holy eyes so I welcome you tonight and let's we just want to have a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we welcome you to our midst Lord father we bring nothing we are nothing Lord father and whatever we can do is nothing father but we pray tonight Lord Jesus that from this moment on Father may you take control father may you anoint the voices of those singing father may you anoint the voices of the worshippers father God and may your Holy Spirit Come In Father Like a thunder Lord Jesus and father God may we explode spiritually in our hearts father father May every person in here have a real genuine experience with the Holy Spirit father and may they know father God that Jesus is not a god of old Jesus is not a god of future Jesus is a present tense God and you're going to meet their needs father God tonight Lord we pray it and ask it and we commit everything in your hands in Jesus name Amen brother

remind you that they lay powerless behind you Hallelujah glory amen amen so we're going to we're going to have some fun tonight you know it's just it's to praise God is one of the funnest things to do
