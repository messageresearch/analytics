him before the foundation of the world that we should be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will never you scriptures just a blessing but it's to save time jump down to verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the cause of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom all whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth first you hear the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and who may also after that you believe first you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise there it is you can't change

seven thunders the other day voices Daniel grabbed his pen Daniel grabbed his pen and started to rain an angel said don't write it now remember John represents the bride John did not know what there are seven written seals was but John didn't know what the thunders was because he represents the pride and the pride will know what the thunders are is for her is to gather her together is to give her faith is to show how to prepare for Greek translation treat his surprise revival it's all for her that's why John represented her but the seven written seals was for our prophet to come by to start his ministry by revealing who God is all about God his nature his being way come from what he's doing not three gods one God that's his message I'm gonna prove it to you Oh hallelujah praise cut yes

says no it cannot be nothing that there's something that's not written he says it was what's what what was hid in the Bible was the seven thunders and the seven thunders would explain the hidden things contained in the Bible [Applause] and that would be a message by the son of man revealing himself in the broth head oh it didn't just say malachi for relish at ten seven then that's the man but it said st. luke's 17:30 making it God in human skin but now okay may be seated I'm trying to hurry along here I'm loaded here just get anywhere amen I told you would come one day to the word be so much pray but you got to come up hey ma'am alright don't you write it John so the same thing and it says don't write what them things are I think you find it on everlasting life in one of the quote books don't write what that is John heard what it was is it but don't write it because it's not for Paul Irenaeus at Martin Columbus Day they're lonely all the way I'm gonna give them the word I'm a thunder to each one of them but don't say what the rest of it is that's for their day now they only stumble over especially to Luther and Wesley in them they would really stumble but it wasn't prophets enough amen yes sir for the last day I'm gonna take all the loose ends up and reveal it for a message this from before the prime yeah seven thunders full of pride amen glory okay my god the Bible okay written out other words and it okay don't write it John saw the same thing and it had already been written outside the Bible I had seven seals on the back of the book that no man could open those seals that was them voices other words he hears the Bible written which is a mystery itself but on the backside of the Bible the revelations yesterday now here was the revelations of this seven voices whole in Revelations plural of what's in this Bible like marriage and divorce and future home of the bride and all that kind of stuff which i think is nothing and at thunder'd unveil Almighty God nothing Christ mystery of God revealed as well that's nothing they still wait for something else right that's nothing and all the time he was thundering thundering Oh hallelujah got right by them hallelujah amen here's the Bible written which is a mustiness sampled on the backside of the Bible the revelations was shown a Daniel says there's seven voices to be uttered and no man can open and no man know what is it what it was but the Bible said in a told and also John watch that in the last days amen these seven voices would be known by the real true church or you get it now watch can you see where the false and counterfeit is trying their best to keep great men from places like that but around can you see where false counterfeit or trying to keep you and your family from great places like that you see her for the dealer other Paul huh well John of amen well Koontz amen no arrest you they came in the mess see these false anointed one they're counterfeit when you go to the bank you train a teller with what first with the real ones first the rest of the caddy you get the real bills to see how they feel then when you're there and they fold a thing in there you what is this you catch the counterfeit it don't feel right it don't sound right ninety nine and nine-tenths but something's wrong it is false and counterfeit this is not thunder it [Applause] [Music] amen there's no thunder to it hey did you get it may be seated did brother Brown know what he was talking about he said it's for the bride he said that false account they would try to keep you out of those places what places heavenly places where there is in Joshua withers in Ephesians heavenly places spiritual places in God in the natural and Joshua places every place where the soul of your foot steps on nope 10 spies try to keep you out of there but Caleb says shut up Caleb said shut up I'm gonna walk and every place the sole of my foot that I have given you hallelujah already give you put your foot out

whether you feel something what will you don't feel anything your predestinated to get them thunders [Applause] hey man okay we got it okay you got there now cross the gorge separation god breaks us to seven seals on the back of the book here in 1956 brother Brown speaking about the seven thunders 1960 when I get many more places it when he prophesied his own message of course when you come do you think he won't tell you here it is you hunted with me and you've been with me all the time and fish with me this is what it is you know what did the Bible say there huh see what they waiting for they'll never get it yes sir it's for now we see have we got a class the seven thunders is the holy ghost the seven thunders is a promised land and and false and knowing I want to try to keep me out of them thunders they were black in the name of the thunders for seventeen years some false prophet in New York that's what's about New York tell my son does amen see I know yes siree what did you get let us enter to this great place these thunders but Joshua divided to the people their inheritance that God had left for them so you just can't catch it but it's inspired of God and moves it right into his place just at the hour when you think not just when you think a nothing's gonna happen God moves it all yeah that's why you must always maintain faith maintain sanctification that the Angels might visit your home one day hallelujah praise God hallelujah glory look cut yes sir yes siree so you got it so today I would like to finish my message on Ephesians already over an hour never even got to it so you know positivity that charity has released virtue power and give us a sign evidence that the land is a good land flowing with milk and honey Oh hallelujah so I feel it another thesis is here to bring on a perfect church the prize earthly goal only a full Redemption by the seven seals can bring the prior to a full final salvation on this earth before the rapture that's all you believe that Oh hallelujah yes siree my god muscle failure was 4142 day seven a m-- yes I didn't mean to say that there what I say about my bird haven't come out couldn't help it so you pardon me but that's me man and pearls a witness a man she's my sister a man hallelujah see why those bull heads can't move me and move me out here my place you're crazy cut up the ribbons [Applause] [Music] amen honey glory no cut yes siree my god a man okay may be seated I don't want to take too much time I never even got to what I got here amen okay as I was with Moses page 7 paragraph 42 and I think of a minister today that's call of God to step into the tracks where Jesus to it what a command but what a commission but each that's call of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each Minister is called to stand where he would the works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command that's what he told me my September 28th 1991 prove my way step out there September 22nd proved enough indicated pride word comes for this hour keep on doing it all the backsliders back in here praise God hallelujah right in front of them then tell me must be born again praise God then raise the dead hallelujah right in front of them then prove them thunders and that's what I'm doing today I'm proving the seven thunders to you but you'll never forget it praise God go ahead with a faith a man quite a command oh yes sir yes siree quieter come here I have something on that expectation yeah Amen well I'll find it here here it is the last Commission perseverance 1962 the last Commission or the last words that fell from his lips when he went up watch this now and until he comes again with a shell the voice of the Archangel and you can read the rest of it st. mark 16 so I'll just cut off time did you hear what I said the last Commission was to be part of the shout and the voice of the Archangel and we're still here shall I read it again to you the last Commission st. mark 16 and when I tell you this gospel shall be preached for a witness to all nations and then shall the income those are scriptures he gave me on September 22nd and acts 1:8 after holy goes to come upon you you shall be which I received power and be witnesses unto me and you mean that God would permit us to come into the shout the coming of the Lord you mean that he would take the Prophet 1965 and give us 25 years to stand or not to unbelief and somewhere along the line we would enter into the voice of the Archangel you know with a little revelation you know what I mean little revelation praise God for 17 years in the voice of the Archangel Oh and the Commission is still here notice he never said the last Trump said to shout divorce the Archangel because the last Trump is the resurrection the Holy Spirit cut it off right there knowing that there would be a bride there would be in Ephesians that would be in the forest of the Archangel I'm saying powerful things to my own church hallelujah Lord when the aim and the last words when they went up until he comes again with a shout the voice of the Archangel he said go into all the world ma my-my-my can you think on that one there what a revelation huh I think I think you've just my past your bedtime Emma yes sir praise God hey step I think wiped out amen and the church organization page seven denomination has failed they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system and in turn on national system by the power of God that will take the church into the Promised Land organizations and denominations has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own way of thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit charity fellowmen France and raised by the artists from the dead the evidence of the new land of the thunders ready to take you into the thunders which is a new land and I've been all the into the new land and I come back thundering for 17 years it's a good land it's flowing with milk and honey the fun the land praise God Oh Laura the by the power of God may be seated that will take the church into the Promised Land organizations in theology each one of the at the own way of thinking amen but God will take his holy spirit and will raise his joshua's that will take the church in to the promised to the promised and no denominational strings tied anywhere but will take the church amen well McDonnell how'd that sound alright yes siree my tell you I don't know well I Garcia my is too much a man so I feel another Ephesians is here to bring on a perfect church the bride's earthly goal only a full redemption by the seven seals can bring I'm gonna try to jam this right here now on you I want to get it in here but I don't want to go like I did during the other months only a full redemption by the seven seals can bring the bride to a final full final salvation on this earth before the rapture and I don't know any book in a variable where you can find outside of Ephesians that's all the beautiful promises it's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the Lamb of God amen yes in Ephesians little children are blessed if they obey their parents the only as only or there wasn't the only commandment with a promise for you children to respect your parents because whether you're drunk adore monk or whatever they are the brother branham said to God would respect you for respecting your parents not to sass them and go on like that you know no matter if he's wrong dead wrong he's still your father that's what I had to do mm pearl she tell you amen well praise God you can tell the world about this you can tell the nations about that yes sir okay now if you just won five you are predestinated unto the adoption of sons nobody's gonna stop you you got Amen how they wanna be Ephesians 3:20 now antennas able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or even think according to the power that worketh in US according to the power that's in the church now and now I got two questions here I don't wanna get to the other one or not but what is another Ephesians and also to number two what is the seventh seal of redemption so I don't then I'll make all that today paradox so let's get down to paradox amen and 1965 paradox in Phoenix Amen now we're going to try to get through here and probably just make that that's all yeah I'll come back another time and it sees the word it's just time right here but I got to nail down my title here amen what is another features okay Malachi 4 explains how the seven seals a redemption brings on another Ephesians now think of all those sisters they say we don't need no ministers we got the Prophet in the tapes think of all those brothers in this message and have cursed ministers we don't need them we can sit in play tapes now we're gonna find out the very ministers apostles and prophets and pass advanced and teachers is the Ministry of Jesus Christ I know there's a whole lot of false around I don't blame I'm a really you know a whole lot of guys around here they ain't got nothing no more than a ldap to teach and they put themselves in order a man that came from some baptist or whatever they come from came in the message there's so much teaching anybody can teach amen but where they ordained of God to rightly divide the word so praise God I know how to feel but I can't help that amen and I'm here in New York amen praise God so what's going to happen brethren when they find out that these menaces that's been doing the work of an apostle or prophet or something the Evangelist of pastored been doing that work faithfully then um thunders a man then it comes time for an inheritance and the land is the thunders is devided some apostles some prophets some pastors some teachers some evangelists some gifts of discernment and wisdom and knowledge and everything else places position Amen power where in any Fijians Oh hallelujah and they try to go over the ministry oh I don't want to be in his shoes when the second example seed comes behind the prophet and has already added add and add up to the top and suddenly the charity caps them virtues in him then pillar fires in him and he goes out as Jesus Christ in the book Ephesians Oh every sickest he'll shadow heels of people in this message maybe in 1992 and all those sisters who backed by spoke evil against those ministry oh ah they're gonna have to pay for that oh I wouldn't want to be in his shoes they were speaking against Jesus Christ I'll answer yes sir okay we're here I'm coming a message oh and then another seat another Sun comes up another one then a sister comes up adopted praise God and all of a sudden they are being adopted then people in the message received the Prophet but rejected everything else thunders and ministers everything you know suddenly a minister comes by and he preaches you the same people and they become eternal laws and they write in the message because it break one word they drop into hell so they don't know what to do in running their mouths don't know what the saying Amen brother brown did the work of evangelist but he was called to be Elijah this is sure as we're standing here there's gonna be some apostles and prophets of passive and teachers because that's the Ephesians Oh hallelujah pray I think is about finished now and all these women running up and down running their mouths and even speaking against me and telling all this is in the church he don't know what he's talking about he speak mean to me he blasted me blasted you out trying to correct you try to instruct you if you know anything what the Word of God come out of you woman and in back in Israel they would they couldn't even come in a synagogue or they had a place for them there stay home falls let your husband give you the word oh come on now that's in the word but they've been running free flap jab jab jab jab for 25 years but now the owl is holding out the pale card is here prayers caught they're gonna be put in their place [Applause] yes sir Amen well praise get where's that joy come on now I'll praise God okay let me try it at home maybe see that Malachi 4 explains how the seven seals of redemption brings on other fusions okay here we are page eight all right a little teaching here I have to do it to nail it down glory to God amen paragraph 57 Joshua here is a book actually it's a book of redemption of the Old Testament Joshua we would have to consider it to be that the book of redemption because it's Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that is that's that it's out of and in two out of Egypt and into the Promised Land out of Laodicea and into the thunders [Music] hallelujah praise God amen okay it has to it takes two parts to make Redemption in Moses representative law which brought them out of Egypt and where's Joshua represented grace that took them into the Promised Land another way was the law and grace were two different aspects of God's command now the law brought them out Moses and Joshua took him in amen okay you got it now Redemption Joshua here is the book of redemption of the Old Testament amen Redemption has two parts out of Egypt today out of denomination a man Egypt doing all of them works down in them denomination making bricks down there for the bishop huh make all those cakes and pies give them to me amen now do you think I want some cakes and pies no see I'm a diabetic amen praise God amen see yes siree okay out of Egypt into the Promised Land out of the layout of seeing denomination into the holy spirit of seven seals seven thunders it also represents something for our day on page nine paragraph 59 it also represents some foul day now it represents as they were in the journey coming from Egypt into a promised land so have we come out of the world Egypt chaos and on our road to the promised land and he says here in my father's house there are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you st. John 14 coming out of Oh hallelujah coming out oh my god praise God thank you chooses from outer world of Egypt chaos on a road of the promised land see so we see that this book of Ephesians perfectly parallel the Old Testament Joshua the book of Ephesians positionally places the church apostles and prophets past Vance's teachers no other book does that phrase as the only one that does head praise God in that book and I think the third chapter said how the mysteries of God is revealed to the holy apostles and prophets but miss all the mysteries of God for that day praise God it's all in Ephesians husband love your wives any seasons wives reverence your own husbands in Ephesians children obey your parents in Ephesians also in Ephesians put on a whole armor of God put on a whole arm of God praise God to go out here and do it and go into a panel any fees everything is any seasons and God save you feed you for last to let all these women in the mess and all these brothers say what they want against the ministry then God comes down and prays gotten adopts some apostles prophets passive and teachers then they become eternal loss and they was in the mess for twenty-five years paying it ties and off and everything else visit the prophet and everything else cut prove that they wasn't they didn't have no Word of God in them tuple to begin with because the Word of God is humble that all puffed up will say anything hallelujah speak evil against the dignitaries hallelujah even an angel said the Lord rebuke you but these second Timothy spirits a heady highminded puffed up praise God evil my god incontinent fierce meeting Oh hallelujah praise God yes sir so we see that this book of Ephesians perfectly pair of the Old Testament Joshua the book of Ephesians position he places the church so he featured here lets us like Joshua positionally now charge away after cross into the land then he was laboring fighting in the land and I said wondering what does Hebrews for me yeah I had to rest the Holy Ghost visit labor to enter into the rest I never understood it in 1960 until I heard a statue of a perfect man that I knew I had to labor hurt you know in the res I'm already under s Prime labored in the rest empty and tutor s and the Rio rest is charity pursuit knowledge temperance patient laboring fighting in the promised land any features in Joshua cutting every denomination devil cut his head off run him out of the caves and everything other put my foot on them praise God hallelujah chop a kinnor ribbons that lion lusting in therefore goal in Babylonia garments they kill them and stone them may be seen it yes sir Oh hallelujah praise God laboring in fighting in the land I think is about six or seven years according to usher but the man who does that number three then Joshua divided the land by inspiration to give each tribe their positions a fitting word for Joshua it would be the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament now two things here Canaan represents the age of the overcomer see number one is dividing up the inheritance number two is setting in order the ones who overcome the overcomers I'm overcome and I'm overcoming oh now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer we know what Joshua was back there but brother Bram said the promise is the Holy Spirit Joelle 228 and it shall come to pass afterward that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions this your land of the promise praise God is still here hallelujah is now in the book of Ephesians you have received the earnest of it you didn't have the Holy Ghost but my god you're gonna receive your full inheritance your full sonship the full manifestation of sons of God hallelujah in ephesians some apostles and prophets in past events it teaches the inheritance Oh hallelujah you may be seated the promised land in the natural in Joshua but what about today today is the promise of the Holy Spirit in the book of Ephesians because in Ephesians 4 that's why I kept reading at 11 through 13 divides the inheritance some apostles in prophecy after they overcome say do the work of a pastor didn't work about of apostle go overseas and set the thing in order and bring the word don't do to do that work Emma always I know who I am I know who sent me overseas the prophet of God ordained me to go overseas I know what I'm talking about I let nobody round New York home telling me something different or what they think I don't care what you think for himself hallelujah your thoughts are not God's thoughts I hear God's thoughts from heaven come to me praise hallelujah Lori did you get it x18 after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall receive power see the Holy Ghost was the one who came down in the upper room on the day of Pentecost and set the church in order by defining up the Holy Ghost land giving each one gifts places position and their inheritance come down in the upper room Moses led them up to the land Jesus led them up to the land but Joshua crossed over and defined it the Holy Spirit took them over and you find it the land praise God hallelujah you leave here today you leave with a revelation is Ephesians another fission's okay hallelujah what is the body of Christ when you're born and then positionally born into the kingdom of God that's what I'm looking for to be positionally born then the whole equals are set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some parents are some evangelists gifts of the Spirit all kinds of miracles and signs and wonders and what is the inheritance the sonship to be a son of God like Malachi reform was like the early prime for us like Jesus was like Adam wise Oh hallelujah praise to get that inheritance back yes sir the whole creation is groaning and moaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God when it'll stop sickness praise God it'll stop cancer and stop all kinds of diseases the plan will see the cripples will walk the tear the raises up demons will be cast out it'll stop please praise God hallelujah there's your inheritance hallelujah and I don't care what anybody says I'm going to have my inheritance I've been laboring here for over 28 years I'm going to have my inheritance I'm about an old Lutheran or Baptists or whatever or you can stay if you want to praise God but I'm going on to the deep corn to the teeth hallelujah hang about you stay there pretty color okay now page 9 amen a fitting word page 9 then I got sixteen one day Fijians and we find the same thing Old Testament I think this book of Joshua fits a fitting word for it it would be the book of Ephesus a fitting word for the book of Joshua would be the book of Ephesus and the book of Joshua was the book of redemption but they was redeemed they went to the promise and when you receive the inner spiritual redeemed when you receive the Holy Ghost you're fully redeemed and then when you adopted oh my god you have wrapped in grape sprays got you in the kingdom do you see it hallelujah okay we find us the Old Testament I think this book of Joshua fits a fitting word for it would be book of Ephesus of the Old Testament the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament would be a good thing to title this book of Joshua because it's certainly fitting to this why can't you imagine that I don't hit on my preaching this maybe it was safe for this morning I couldn't get to it November 3rd because the Dead had to be raised first you go back ahead of tape you hear me saying it must be a common other seasons I was into it but I had to wait for the day so we find Joshua we're representing grace or some propitiation that it could not exist in the same time that the law was in existence amen now you got an L both books of redemption both of my books of redemption Joshua adhesions and it defined both on divine inheritance the promised land and both of them sets each man in order giving them gift places positions Ephesians 4 amen hallelujah and then when they get their positions and so forth then it said put on the whole armor of God in fusions 6 praise God to go out to this press is coming down my god you better have on the whole arm of God yes sir this got to be nice features also to this journey another Ephesians page 10 brother Branham said here and so has the church world in its land stage has come along it's played as part but there's coming a time where it must cease it must do it there's got to be an Ephesians also of this journey I don't have preached about it the message but he says it's got to be in Ephesians you know why they won't preach because in there's ministers in there and they don't want no ministers so then anyone appreciate it and those those guys who are preaching ain't got no life they go preach the second Peter one thing got no virtues they don't have no life and it's certainly not going to preach 2nd Peter 1 nor Ephesians so they were scared away from it or get over there now if they had any fight in them had any seed in them they die her rep right back this is my over big piece of steak praise God amen which I'll give you a picture then there was the okay buddy take it easy we'll take half amen oh praise God well they must come in Ephesians there has got to be in Ephesians also of this journey just as it was of other journeys there has to be come any thieves and Ephesus and Ephesians of this journey the striving is down into you now hallelujah we want to have a seventh on the revival another Ephesians is here for seven thundery vital the revival will come from Ephesians because Ephesians is the seven seals word is Jesus Shasha Jehovah Savior that took them from their wilderness into the promised land do you see a church Joshua means Jesus Jehovah Savior that took him out of the will disinter the promised land and then divide the inheritance and today Ephesians is the Holy Spirit in the fire for ministries brother Ram told him to pour the seven virtues into that Brian to the perfection of the coming of the Son of God to be all come in the unity of the faith amen one faith one Lord one baptism of the knowledge of son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in Ephesians and that was my prayer that I prayed Oh hallelujah glory to God before the debt for the dead was even raised I prayed that prayer yes sir glory to God amen and it's here I know it's there lugia power guy went down and touched brother hiss pop goddess here if now pants believe hallelujah glory to God may be seated Joshua raise up for the exodus now page 12 I'm a close I'd leave the next question for the next time cuz I know I'll be here two hours more amen page 12 okay let's nail down what my subject was here I get my subject in here then I'm alright and the subject is the seven seals of redemption is that Ephesians made manifest I'm gonna try this down here we're gonna finish Amen would go we ran out of time for today but there'll be another day when we shall continue and we in a revival Amen okay now page 12 and then Joshua raised up for the Exodus amen now we taught that's why I read in Revelation the sixth chapter and reason I did that because in Revelation 6 gives us the 6 written seals that correct then it breaks in with revelation 7 I believe and in Revelation 8 start breaking into the thunders and so forth I mean the trumpets and then it goes in Revelation no less then it hits revelation 10 and brother Brown thought that he had to bring the chumps because he said so then God says no less for Moses and Elijah so but he did get into the sixth trumpet to let us know or where we were at in this age and he named the sixth trumpet Hitler and Eichmann and staylene he named it in the 1938 killed six million Jews was the sixth trumpet praise God and we could count between 1930 something and now we between the sixth trumpet in the seventh trumpet and at the end of the voice of the archangel which becomes a voice of the resurrection I could almost see an angel standing at the last of the seven angels message crying time no longer praise God and up will come Moses and Elijah pup will come Elijah praise God in all the bride everybody else at the last Trump the Trump of God the trumpet of God shall sound but right now we are still preaching the last Commission in the voice of the Archangel Oh hallelujah praise God and that's stone of powers here now let's nail it down here now we're taught in revelation 6 chapter I believe 6th chapter of the seven seals that supposed the book is to be sealed up with seven mysteries or seven seals revelation 6 and in the last a revelation in in the seventh seal religion 6 and the last a revelation in Revelation we find out that the layout of cien last message of the last age and during the time of his prophecy that the seven seals would be open the seven mystery 7 full mysteries that had been left off to every Asian had been somebody left on the reformer didn't have time to take care of it and the day is the Luther the only justification by faith he was gone they made a church after that Wesley he preached sanctification and that was it and long come to Pentecostals but we're promised according to revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4

Louis 17:30 has got to become a feature to this there is promise it friends there must come in Ephesians that the Sevenfold misses of the word of God must be unfolded and it's in the Laodicean age that this takes place believe we are there I believe we are right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and as for Joshua just before the Ephesians raised up so did John the Baptist raise up before the next and we promised another Ephesians is predicted here in the scripture therefore I think that we're living in Ephesians again back to we are promised that what was left off doing those seven ages did you hear what he said Joshua raised up before the first Ephesians which was called the book of Joshua but that was the Holy Ghost promised land in the natural that was Jesus Christ do you understand that was the word then China pampus became before the next Ephesians who was that Jesus Christ and he was a son of man he revealed all the Misses of the Old Testament it's not given to them it's given to you to know the mysteries they received the Misses as a word of God and then took him into the Upper Room hallelujah then down come the Ephesians in the upper room and define of the inheritance that's number two now if in the last day of this journey this got to come another Ephesians and so the Son of man coming self in Malachi for revelation 1070 Oh hallelujah praise God it's got to come with other visions amen remember redemptions in two parts out of into the promised land the inheritance is defined each man in order so did John the Baptist raised up just before the next Ephesians Jesus Christ to you and we're promised another fusions it's predicting the scriptures now seven seals redemption okay here we are here's my proof it's right here seven seals redemption manifested another Ephesians ninety one ninety two so therefore he says here at page 13 now you cannot add nothing to the book or take nothing from it now the book what is the book Ephesians then you cannot take the ministry out of Ephesians which is the book the revelation of Jesus Christ hope it drops in I'll read it again now you cannot add nothing to the book or take nothing from it relish try to eighteen says so now revelation revelation is the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ that was revealed a gentleman seein all those symbols and things and so forth and he even said revelation eight one he says remember that dream I had about the little Pentecostal babies and so forth you say here it is slides right into revelation 8 1 so there was no symbol but he had the tenth vision for the symbol and he's slitting in there huh okay he said himself I hope you reading it Amen so then for take one word he's part ape from the book of life now remember we said that before oh this bible become on word huh and you are the word I think I was preaching on one of the tapes and when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost three thousand words three thousand names from the book of life heard the message then all in the New Testament is the believers from seven Church ages is the New Testament that's on souls in prison and he even called it a New Testament of my blood so if you're in the bread you are the New Testament he didn't he didn't he didn't have to write a Bible but he knew that Lutheran Wesley would come and intellectual age become they would need a Bible but Paul said I didn't need a Bible that an arrhenius and Martin that they had the Holy Ghost there no eating told it don't do that don't do this the Norwegian the conviction that was inside but when the Bible would come out would help people didn't wasn't want to have the Holy Ghost millions times millions yes so oh I better I don't know my god anyway don't know his part would take me in the book of life now we can't annotate so therefore now we know Luther could not get to it Wesley so forth reformers Fannie Calvin down they couldn't they didn't get it at all what they had was the gospel truth but now in the last days we're given the understanding by the word that we're going to understand it as for us today you are going to understand what I'm talking about today tonight we're going to understand it why because it'll come in Ephesians 2 it that's why you're going to understand you're going to see some people adopt it you're going to see the power of God you're going to see a seventh under revival and you're going to understand it because what did he tell me prove my word and by proving my word then they will understand and after they understand then they will have faith to enter into the prize promises that's what he told me September 26 praise God that you would understand nothing till another Ephesians come along here praise God then you are going to understand it hallelujah why because it's going to come another Ephesians to it and we're here and we're here and we are here hallelujah praise God yes sir hallelujah maybe see it about five more minutes amen you're going to understand it because it'll come and ephesians age to it and we're here now paradox I'll leave that hang because I just got about 10 more minutes and we're gonna get to this prayer line he said so okay and now can you believe it already so we're gonna understand it by the word secrecy God's gonna loose the seven seals seven thunder inspiration because it'll come in Ephesians a tune we hear incredible but true seven seals seven thunders becomes another Ephesians now amen okay rising of the Sun page 45 he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals then Jesus Christ who is the Ephesians is the seven seals he's the word is that in the Bible seven seals written here within it that's Jesus Christ but the devil made it so mysterious it was so simple 25 years that's right all wound up trying to figure the thunders and one brother told me brother Joe mm-hmm you know all my dirty nasty sins when the thunders come we'll be done away with and so will yours I said brother all my nest area since done awaiting the blood of Jesus Christ any man Brotherhood the man called me up and told me that 1967 when the thunders come so ever you can do what you want to do now but when the Sun has come they be done away with and he didn't know that they had a fight in the thunders for each promise who do you say this is you got a fight in labor and the Thunder promised land because the son of man hallelujah the evidence of the new land amen the son of man see what he did oh let me strike this point just freelance a little bit praise God I can't keep reading here Amy I'm trying to nail down Ephesians okay he is those seals did you know that he's seven seals and under the Seventh Seal with a gonna preach I can't email do it next time is seven thunders did you understand that he took the thunders from here and put it in Revelation 8 on just before the trumpets put in the fourth seal to utter his voices correct correct Oh amen all right he is those seals for the whole winter God I'm trying to get a groove here somewhere and it's so much to be said the whole Word of God is Christ there's a quote and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of those seals then revealing Christ's unquote so you mean at the seventh seal brother bear say here he is the one with the swept-back wings here he was he brought the seventh seal those other seals meant something to me but I prayed I went to the mountain I did this I did that but oh you don't know what does seventh seal means to me because brother Brennan knew he had prophesied it be seven thunders that's going to be put under the Seventh Seal and Jesus himself when he preached on the seals himself on your sixth seal he preached in st. Matthew and brother man went down through it correct and he only opened six seals he omitted the seventh seal then when it came to it over here with the Prophet he preached he opened six seals then opened the seventh and incense they open up to tell you what's under there one full of it seven thunders banging one two people five six seven he said now watch I hang on time to get the quotes I'll hit it again he said but it is connected to his coming it's right there I have all the pages and everything the seven thunders is connected to the Seventh Seal the coming of the Lord so going back home be nice and so forth and then I had another quote and he said here a warning in judge in 1963 I'll read that this will get me understanding do you love them paster dear I think what you will think of what we are look how far up the road we are friends just look back down the road from from way down yonder in the days of Luther Wesley and on to the ages look here where we are right here at the top of the pyramid right here where the God has proved it that the Bible through the seven seals that's written them perfectly been revealed now watch waiting only now for them seven mysteries right at last on the coming of the Lord and the rapture 1963 after the seven seals was revealed the prophecy he was waiting for the seven thunders the last mysteries the voices on the coming of the Lord what shall we do with Jesus called the Christ page 43 he said the book is open just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified to the coming of the Lord it's connected together then he waited until the shout message and then he exposed anything he said what it was he said did you get it he said the Lord Himself does all three as he descends he does the shout voice and trunk and the shout is the message going forth the bread of God to gather the Brian to bring it together but way to years before that he said that the seven thunders gathers a bride together well right at last on the coming of the Lord it comes together the thunders gathers a bride together at nineteen sixty five over here the rapture tape therefore he says Malachi fourth message is the bread gathering the people together and over here it was a mystery over here it was known and it's the same thing and a prophet himself said it himself all praise God I don't know I mean you got it huh you know praise God I don't know but let me read this to you here proving this word pay 52 or 53 I'm a cut-off do you believe we lived in the last days when the Son of Man was to be manifested there would be all the word that's gathered up through Luther Wesley Baptist and all that and the Pentecost no watch all gathered up to the revelation of what it's all been and seven thunders on the backside holds the revelation of what is all being and the third pool is to open the word by the seven thunders holding the revelation of what is all been my god no wise the seventh seal angel rather was to open what the sixth seal mystery and that's why he opened six because he's saying that's all he was supposed to do because Jesus open 6 and Jesus himself as one is a son of man so he opened six seals and let them play around for 25 years and reveal every mystery in that Elijah and that was the seventh seal Jesus Christ Christ seventh seal the age of representing with the big swept-back wings that's brother Browns message and he went through 1963 and went on through there then it went across the country and then earth the earthquake still waiting for the coming of the Lord and one day June 14th come to the unveiling Almighty God what happened on June 14 all brother sister are you catching it look don't you see there's been a veil through these ages according to what God said and it would be open up in the last days those seven seals would be broke and all and a full thing would come into the view of the people was to place all along the hour of the seven angels message all the mysteries of God should be made known in that Elijah in this last hour every mystery thunders and all Ephesians he made known in Elijah then Elijah would speak mysteries as a Word of God seven thunders on the earth in a message and they would turn it down and reject it looking for something else it has already happened hallelujah we're now ready for the prize revival what we see hallelujah should put us in action should make a church that a make a revival where something has broke out of New York City the manifestation of the seven thunders [Applause] musicians praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah all the mysteries of God should be made known in this Inn and Elijah and wonder how the crisis pull out of his church son of God how he's revealed it son of man again how that the churches would be put in order so I had to put a lien oh in order you didn't get nothing till you get it your place if not me it's gone just be nice it come here Sunday night got a bless you amen cuz the other way we'll never have nothing and then and it ones that don't want to do it I don't believe it is the real believers I cannot believe that I cannot believe a Holy Ghost person would not want to come here Sunday night for one Sunday a month I don't believe that it's got to be somebody without the hold it goes who can't even see the kingdom of God nor understand it now that's striking about me for it to pinch sick and tired its flesh that don't want to stay in a word of God hallelujah glory to God amen how the church will be put in order and everything the last day is a Cree no denominational creed just absolute a word living an individual I'll take one I'll leave one I'll take this and I'll leave that one see there's no strings no denomination no bindings are nothing it's the heart with God in him alone there you are alright the seventh angel was pulled to open six seal mystery then the seventh seal in all the mysteries would be revealed in that Elijah and under the Seventh Seal what he put on their rubbish ain't one seven thunders you know what did he say seven thunders what else could he say he already revealed the six seals already and what was he supposed to preach he is those seals hallelujah Oh quickening power or here man okay it's all gathered up in the son of man and the son of man is a seventh seal and the seventh seal and the son of man is in Elijah and he gathers all the mysteries up into him what he preached in March 63 then when he goes out he unveils God marriage and divorce and all these things see it's the word there's nothing greater than the word and people are looking for this looking for that and it's a word this promises son of man amen the evidence of the new land hallelujah and you take it my promise bite you fight for it hallow that's mine that's mine hallelujah praise God it's all gathered up into the Son of Man his fullness of time has come to the full of his word now watch to manifest the fullness of his body that's the word in now watch that's the spoken word what is the spoken word this Bible the spoken word is original seed that God spoke and don't hide bread it it'll come it'll come to pass and do what it says supposed to do yes sir this is a spoken word and brother Brown said hid the spoken word amen made manifest by the word whose the word saint-luc 17:30 is making the spoken word manifest they can only see that my gut the spoken word made manifest by the word reveal the word now this is the revealed word this is the promised land another Ephesians hallelujah praise God and how can the people go around here there's no spirit it's looking around down on the ground on somewhere oh you know who the voices are k jealous huh page 577 Revelation chapter 4 amen the voice let's pick on it boys the same voice is summoned John to come up the same voice said that John come up is the same voice as some of the church some day Amos summons the church and also the same voice is summoned John to come up it's the same voice is summoned dead Lazarus out of the grave that same voice voice of the Archangel Christ is the voice of the Archangel all see the voice of the Archangel all that trumpet voice summoned John to come up Christ is the voice at the ArcheAge was so strange about preaching the last Commission in the voice of the Archangel and another Ephesians huh now you're warned today don't you take any a word out of this Bible do come against anything in Ephesians anything no coming as any ministry or anything yes sir it's telling us all quickening power lets you see all this here this morning who is another who is no the Ephesians page 18a man there's been many men raised up okay I'll skip and then when he come on the scene to prove that he was that Ephesians made manifest gentleman announced it but Jesus was that he was the word manifested himself and then when all of our promises the inherited from the book of Ephesians is manifested who will that be Jesus Christ Ephesians I want you to get it you know and so John announced and Jesus was that he was the word manifested the seven seals Redemption is that Ephesians made manifest word manifested because the seventh seal had seven thunders under it and that was the Ephesians that's right we're here I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ made the promise there must come another and how much more has he promised patient 19 and leaving the Bible to this very age that we're living in Ephesians again of the church ages we have got seven church ages we have promised at the Laodicean Church age there would be another Ephesians that's right we are here I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ who made a promise I've been I've combed over this thing back and forth I didn't know I was going to do this a day but did you catch the revelation here Church when the seven seals seven thunders are unfolded and a layout of seeing church age it would produce another Ephesians a perfect man a perfect church and a book of Ephesians a glorious church without spot or wrinkle hallelujah that would be holy and no blemishes that's the Ephesians oh my one body one spirit hallelujah one hope one father one faith on the whole thing there where are you staying here on this third phase this morning another feedings is here for the prize seventh on revival the revelation the seven seals and the seven thunders would produce another features to bring forth the Bible the brand rather Joseph's perfection the pillow fire dwelling in the adopted sons so we're here oh praise God is one thing I wanted to end up here with you on amen praise God this is that okay I got this last quote here brother Graham says here amen he did the spoken word he spoke about Joshua Sun stand still and he said that was the Ephesians okay that's their two Sun stand still he said any Fijians is an emphasis with the gospel it was a paradox the spoken word was he fishes Jesus page 28 and he goes into the discernment and in discerning this is Ephesians discernment was decision sirens warnings America was Ephesians then he goes to here again on page 27 26 that's right now if he'll do that for you between you and I so that the audience not a show but that they might see the Ephesus is here and that this is the thing that bridges between denomination and the glory land Oh Lou you know I sing across the bridge across the bridge there's no more sorrow it's Ephesians oh my god we are here another Ephesians it's the bridge that comes from Laodicea over into glory into the resurrection on that bridge and you're on that bridge Oh hallelujah some other things I wanted to say I just all right I'll say this here finished clothes my inspiration what is faith faith is something that you don't it's not here as yet but you believe it is now what do
