[0:00] And oh my, what a promise. My
[0:04] now God trying to place his church in
[0:07] position to manifest himself. God trying
[0:10] to get New York City, Lindrove, Tucson,
[0:14] different places in position. What
[0:16] position? Our position,
[0:19] justification, sanctification, the gifts
[0:21] and the Holy Ghost. No way past there.
[0:24] the word adoption, the spoken word, the
[0:28] resurrection power in this position.
[0:32] Oh, what a what a position so that he
[0:35] can manifest himself. The word. Yes,
[0:38] sir. Getting one that he can work
[0:40] through like this. There's my spirit
[0:42] flowing freely. I can work there. Oh,
[0:45] would it be wonderful tonight that he
[0:48] could work through New York City in the
[0:49] third pool?
[0:51] He could point around this country and
[0:53] around the world. There's New York City.
[0:54] There's something about New York City.
[0:56] I'm working through there.
[0:58] Oh, I've already started already.
[1:02] Amen. See, but then some people pressed
[1:06] on in the Holy Ghost since 1906 and they
[1:09] went on over. See, but that was only the
[1:11] fruit. See, that was only a foretaste to
[1:14] earnest the down payment.
[1:16] But in 1906, my God says, Joshua, take
[1:20] over the people into the land. Amen. So
[1:23] Malachi 4 goes out with a little gift
[1:26] and here like I was saying Sunday cuz he
[1:28] had a thing on his arm here a little
[1:30] sign there and the Holy Spirit hung
[1:32] right here and says it's it's cancer
[1:34] it's a tumor it's this is that and it
[1:36] and they looked at that you know and the
[1:38] voice spoke over here see they didn't
[1:40] know what was going on and all those
[1:42] years in 1963 seven angels appeared and
[1:45] told William Brandham take the church
[1:47] over into the pillow fire land
[1:50] amen take them on over
[1:52] Joshua commission was a two-fold
[1:54] commission. Take them over and then
[1:57] divide the land, the inheritance years
[2:00] later. So William Brandham took us in,
[2:03] gave us the message, put it on tapes and
[2:05] book and God took them away and now
[2:08] we're in the land. Amen.
[2:11] And that's why there's nobody here in
[2:13] front of me. Oh, what wonderful odds.
[2:17] What odds? I looked around this entire
[2:20] country in 1965. The prophet was gone. I
[2:23] said, "Well, there's nobody tell me
[2:25] because what I can do and I'm going to
[2:27] take the land for myself,
[2:30] brother, get out of my way. You can't
[2:32] tell me." I said, "I know what it is."
[2:35] Yes, sir. He said, "Every place where
[2:37] the soul of your foot, my soul of my
[2:39] foot stepped down into virtue." He said,
[2:40] "You can have it."
[2:42] Soul of my foot stepped down into
[2:45] knowledge. He said, "You can have it."
[2:47] Yes, sir.
[2:48] The soul of my foot went down into
[2:50] temperance. You can have it
[2:52] into patience. You can have it. Amen.
[2:55] Into godness. You can have it into
[2:57] brotherly kindness. Yes, you can have
[2:59] it.
[3:00] Don't you remember down there in
[3:02] Georgia, I was hearing back the tape.
[3:04] Oh, if you hear it back, it's right on
[3:06] there. What I'm saying tonight, it's
[3:07] right there on the tape. I said, "Oh,
[3:09] church and the Holy Spirit swept in." I
[3:12] said, "Oh, Georgia, tonight." I said the
[3:16] Philistines is crying out. They saying
[3:19] don't let them get the revelation of
[3:21] brotherly kindness.
[3:23] If they ever get it, we are finished. We
[3:26] devils are finished. We can't wreck the
[3:30] church no more. If the people can only
[3:32] have a forgiven spirit.
[3:35] That's in Georgia. It's funnier in
[3:37] Georgia. And woke up the entire America.
[3:42] I hope you get it, New York. Come on.
[3:43] Wake up New York. Already happened in
[3:46] Georgia already. Come back in. Give them
[3:49] holy decency. Position them in Christ.
[3:51] Now send down a capstone.
[3:54] Brother, she's coming down in here.
[3:56] You better get ready for it.
[3:59] The Philistines
[4:01] only back up in the adoption.
[4:06] Yeah. They won't back up. All their sin
[4:09] and the unbelief won't go out. See? Yes,
[4:13] sir. Joshua was fighting those
[4:15] Philistines and whatn not there and the
[4:17] sun was going down. He needed some more
[4:19] light to to see those devils
[4:23] so he could could kill some more demons
[4:26] for the glory of the Lord.
[4:28] And I'm asking for some more light
[4:29] tonight
[4:32] to kill those devils.
[4:35] Those Philistines upon the people that's
[4:39] keeping them back from the promise of
[4:40] God.
[4:44] Yes sir.
[4:45] And you know one thing, he has sent it.
[4:49] He has sent it.
[4:50] Amen.
[4:51] Yes sir. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
