[9:18] God well welcome
[9:21] friends um I believe that probably I
[9:24] don't even have to come here amen um
[9:27] what I heard I like what I heard
[9:30] and that shows me that you brought the
[9:33] Revival with
[9:45] you we just want to welcome one and
[9:49] all from all different
[9:51] places um and I believe to me my
[9:54] personal testimony I came with great
[9:58] expectation
[10:00] and um to me I was just thinking I said
[10:04] not could it be I believe that this will
[10:07] be the manifestation of the vision that
[10:10] brother brandham
[10:11] [Applause]
[10:15] had
[10:18] amen and if you can paint the picture in
[10:20] your mind and just think
[10:23] about I say see the pro the prophet on
[10:26] the mountain hunting just as a regular
[10:28] man
[10:29] that he
[10:30] was and just probably when that struck
[10:34] him I said I can imagine
[10:36] seeing people coming from Canada people
[10:40] coming from
[10:41] Tucson people coming from
[10:43] Nigeria forgive me but I get
[10:47] [Music]
[10:50] excited my
[10:53] God in Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania New
[10:58] York
[11:05] and see the the enemy tries to block
[11:08] even the sound system and little things
[11:09] like that don't let that stop your
[11:14] fire that's that's that's physical
[11:17] that's that's mechanical
[11:19] stuff I mean we try to do the mechanics
[11:22] the best we can but only he brings the
[11:24] [Applause]
[11:27] Dynamics
[11:29] [Applause]
[11:36] I just want to read a short portion of
[11:38] scripture in Acts chapter
[11:48] 2 and when the day of Pentecost has
[11:50] fully come there were all in one Accord
[11:54] in one place and suddenly there came a
[11:57] sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty
[11:59] Wind and it fill all the house where
[12:01] they were sitting and there appear unto
[12:04] them clothing tongues like as of fire
[12:06] and it sat upon each of them and they
[12:09] were all now it it didn't say it was 118
[12:13] and the other two just look no all
[12:17] filled with the Holy Ghost they began to
[12:20] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[12:22] gave them utterance and I'm just here to
[12:25] encourage you and to tell you that it's
[12:29] always your attitude that brings the
[12:32] results cuz if you can remember I mean
[12:34] paint a picture I always think about
[12:37] Simeon I said he was a human being he
[12:40] was just in expectation he had the right
[12:43] attitude
[12:45] and God will never ever fail you if you
[12:51] have the right attitude I didn't say if
[12:54] you're in the right condition I didn't
[12:55] say that God doesn't care about your
[12:57] condition
[12:59] you can be you could be a drug addict
[13:03] you could be a prostitute and if you
[13:06] have the right attitude you will live
[13:08] change
[13:12] tonight God doesn't look on this he
[13:15] looks on your
[13:17] heart always remember that don't let the
[13:21] devil bind your mind like oh um man I'm
[13:25] really messed up I'm doing the wrong
[13:27] thing no you're not you're doing the the
[13:29] right thing cuz when you're sick you
[13:30] come to the hospital is that right so if
[13:33] you're not doing good that means that
[13:35] you got to come to
[13:37] church God didn't come for the saved
[13:40] ones God came for the unsaved
[13:46] ones I just want to read you a quick
[13:49] quote brother brandom said in the
[13:51] Supernatural I'm going to be very brief
[13:54] but listen to this but it is the
[13:57] attitude of the people that brings the
[14:00] results that's the reason at Pentecost
[14:03] they had to go to an upper room and pray
[14:06] until the Holy Ghost came cuz they got
[14:10] in one place and one Accord it's the
[14:13] atmosphere that brings the results see
[14:15] brother Brandon didn't say it's the
[14:17] condition you're in that brings the
[14:19] result it's even your attitude how you
[14:22] react even in your
[14:24] [Music]
[14:26] condition even if you don't feel like
[14:28] praying in God just respect it don't
[14:32] have like a I don't care attitude no
[14:34] just respect it and because your respect
[14:37] God will honor
[14:39] you brother Brandon keeps saying here
[14:42] you believe that he said let every man
[14:45] every woman in this building this
[14:47] morning and I say tonight boy or girl
[14:50] get everything from their minds but the
[14:53] Lord Jesus and believe that he's
[14:55] standing present right now and you will
[14:58] see something happen that will cause
[15:01] headlines in the newspaper in the next
[15:04] morning is that right he said it's the
[15:07] atmosphere so I exort you tonight come
[15:10] and rejoice With Us Praise Him
[15:13] worshiping entering and I welcome you to
[15:16] the manifestation of the vision of the
[15:19] Prophet because it's here tonight is not
[15:22] a it's not a myth people say it's a myth
[15:25] you know what people say Pentecost
[15:27] Pentecost is not a Rel religion
[15:29] Pentecost is what you believe is an
[15:31] experience it's what you want in your
[15:34] heart you want to change and that's what
[15:36] we want tonight so you know what I'll
[15:38] push it even more I dare you to try
[15:42] God I dare you to try
[15:48] God I dare you to try him even once if
[15:52] God fail you never serve him
[15:55] [Music]
[15:57] again
[15:59] I will put my life I know that God is
[16:02] going to answer you God can God is going
[16:05] to answer you he's going to change your
[16:07] life every single one of you so enter in
[16:11] and you know what when you
[16:13] sing it's like when a boxer's going into
[16:16] a
[16:16] fight you just don't walk in there just
[16:19] like that you got to warm up you got to
[16:22] lose those muscles so when the Jabs come
[16:24] in you lose so do the same thing even
[16:28] you know what maybe you don't feel
[16:30] [Music]
[16:31] 100% that's
[16:33] okay do the best you can brother
[16:35] brandham said do the best you can for
[16:37] God even if your faith is this big
[16:41] that's okay God can take that and your
[16:43] eyes looks like this but in God's eyes
[16:46] is
[16:47] mountains a tree doesn't start from a
[16:50] tree it start from a little seed like
[16:52] this and you might not see the seed
[16:54] that's in your heart but he sees it you
[16:57] might think you don't have nothing cuz
