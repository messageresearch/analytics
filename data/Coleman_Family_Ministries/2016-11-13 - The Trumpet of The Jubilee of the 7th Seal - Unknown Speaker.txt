them Hallelujah and show it was no organization there was a filling of the Holy Ghost earnest money to his church that it would not be controlled by organization and so forth it would be the earnest of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with power and the love of God Amen oh doesn't that just do something to you the the legal possessor where was it at in the hands of God and he couldn't hold it over 50 days and you read that over in Leviticus I swe I'm reading it to you now the laws there could not the original owner it had to go back into the hands of the original owner after 50 years I'm telling that to you now and this is another this is another Year of Jubilee right now going on right now I didn't say two months of Jubilee I said a year praise God we just getting started every predestinated seat of God shall be sealed Hallelujah maybe see the the kinman Redeemer he was a redeemer then what did he do he slaughtered him and the enemy did and so forth okay somewhere and that

church and God sent the Holy Ghost back run all the squatters out and then taking over the power of the Holy Ghost come down and the church reive the earnings of the Salvation now the earnings of our Salvation is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without organization amen they could not hold it for past that 50th day because it was the day of Jubilee when everything went back to original beginning and the power of God was taken back to his original the 50th day the Year of Jubilee all things went back Hallelujah glory to God since Malachi 4 left the scrats came in the message and they said this and

amen oh Hallelujah Glory all right so that you will understand may be seated now there will come another Year of Jubilee I've been hitting this for years but it struck this year and that we've had about this time you notice Pentecost been falling America about 50 years somewhere along that just about 50 years the Pentecost began to fall what's happening the churches receiving the seven seal Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals not one tenth of them can receive it now here's how you going to know know that the Year of Jubilee has started in New York City but when you begin to see the year Jubilee where we don't have to fuss families and brothers and sisters fussing arguing spewing about nothing ain't no Jubilee there but brother when each one know they're free glory to God you my sister you my brother I love you I forgive you praise God ain't no trying to make no point trying to be right well you did this to me and I didn't do that to you I did this much

God oh amen maybe seated we don't have to fuss and pull like we already secured but we already cured in Christ we already have the name of the Lord Jesus in baptism this is 61 here we have all these great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in the Seven Seals and prove to to them that it was the seals that was sealed away from the eyes of the people if God be in my helper I'll prove it to you that they couldn't see that by the Bible amen let's find out back here and see whether the trumpet sounds and you don't go pum back to Genesis to Revelation back and forth when the seal is open see these things being revealed this is all I preach they got cursed for it so all I'm preaching Jubilee and they don't understand it hallelujah oh my that's all right this day this scripture is fulfilled Hallelujah Jubilee years here Glory all right I'm going to read something to you you want to read okay Isaiah 61 I won't be along with you Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives there's your Jubilee Praise God and the opening of the prison to them that are bound there's your Jubilee Bound in prisons prisons of reasoning to Proclaim here it is the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of of our God to comfort all that mourn when you mourn then he will comfort you praise God when you go to travailing and burden down he'll come and comfort you hallelujah oh you may be seated let's let's nail it down from the prophet here page uh this day the scripture is fulfilled page seven and brother Brown read I just I just read it here this day the scripture is fulfilled how accurate is the scripture if you notice this and Isaiah 611 and2 is where our Lord was reading from but in the middle of the second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped where it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord then he stopped why the other part to bring judgment didn't apply to his first coming but his second coming see it didn't apply there how the scriptures never make a mistake they're always perfect Jesus stopped just where the scripture stopped cuz that was exactly what was to be Vindicated in his day and if you heard identified Masterpiece 1964 y my Arizona you'll find out that we are supposed to take the day of Vengeance of our God and it's got to happen very shortly so what God did he waited about 30 years about from 1963 to 1993 and release another year Jubilee Hallelujah to bring that bride right back in there again praise God so she'll be ready to take the day of Vengeance of our God oh hallelujah praise God nobody can break [Applause] that may be seated okay that's why you're being sealed up cuz you got to take the day of Vengeance you got to be identified Masterpiece God's got to Smite you Hallelujah Smite rejected and cursed Hallelujah that's the Masterpiece Glory you see why I had to lay my Foundation here huh oh amen Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph if you don't put Joseph on there and the Holy Spirit pours out ain't nothing going to happen but if Joseph is here that's the word then the word will form a body up then the head will connect to the body Hallelujah a image will be formed on the foundation Nathaniel got a revelation 88 nothing against him he was sealed and when you get a revelation today there's nothing against you David nothing against you nothing against you nothing that you can do you can't pray for it you can't preach for it you can't fast for it there's nothing against you just God's mercy when he wants to give it to you and that's when you receive it and until that time happen shouting and praising and glorifying God and going on with your life and doing way you have to do there it is that's salvation that's juile okay maybe seated the second coming he'll bring judgment upon the Earth but not then he was the preach acceptable year knows that the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the Word of Promise for that age how strange the Messiah stand up before the church and look at these precious words when he says to preach acceptable year the Lord Lord now watch the acceptable year as we all know as Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee ever since he started in the upper room and out on the day of Pentecost has been the Year of Jubilee it's been down through seven Church ages it was wiped out and lay out of seal pitched black but a Prophet come with Seven Seals and loosed it again praise God but the minister must preach it or you won't get it praise God I preached it praise God and now you got [Applause] it Hallelujah now you got the acceptable year is the Year of Jubilee you may be see that when all the slaves and prisoners as they were being taken prisoner and captured in church spirits and denominations they were taken out praise God Amen and they had to give a son to pay debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they've been in bondage or how long they're supposed to stay there when the year come of Jubilee oh God when the trumpet sounded

you want to go free today you are free he was no more you're no more a slave but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be Tak down to the temple stood by the temple post and they took an all and bore a hole through your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days if you're a Baptist Methodist or Pentecost whatever you are and you come in here today you can hear this message and go free in the Jubilee or you can go back to your dead denomination and serve it the rest of the days through the tribulation period praise God may God have mercy on your souls

who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear God's gospel trumpet sound out you are free but if you turn your back on the message and refuse to hear it notice you were bored in the air with an awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave to the system to at your end the rest of your day whether it's whiskey drugs or whatever you be a slave to that if you refuse to hear the acceptable year praise God if you refuse my God to hear the acceptable year Hallelujah and we are sounding that trumpet down glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus Glory Hallelujah now the other part of it is I said that doesn't need to be an answered this is the coming Messiah time now is when he will bring judgment I just told you Christ in you a perfect man on the Earth just around
