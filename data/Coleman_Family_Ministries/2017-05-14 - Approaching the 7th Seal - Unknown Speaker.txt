TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now want to read from the third verse in the Book of Amos the third chapter can two walk together except they be agreed Willa lion roar in the forest when he have no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare fun area where no genus for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all shall chop it be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the LORD hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth is secret unto his servants the prophets even though I am has roared who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesied first Corinthians the first chapter Paul calls to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and spoke the knees of brother but put a little gun unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus call to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord who lives in our grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ that in everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you now his liver for his layin here so that he come behind in no gift now notice here waiting for the coming of all Lord Jesus Christ and let me stop here now this means waiting for the revelation for the unveiling of the word foreign exist in degree waiting for the coming the common is the visibility of the word which was hidden by these denominations I would begin to understand in our now when this where it is unveiled reveals that this is what will happen when this happens when this variety of unveil revealed when it comes who this is the word shall also confirm you mean to strengthen you straight on to the end notice now into the end of the day of Christ I'm speaking about that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus are you beginning to fan out the revelation of the Son of Man will uncover the word then when that word is uncovered that word will come from you will strengthen you to the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ community amen in the best bill God stick it into your heart and as you got you have got to know that it's got to be in there revelation 10 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow look upon his head and his face was as it were dove son and his feet as pillars of fire this is Jesus Christ and he had his hand a little book open now notice now when Christ if mighty angel with the rainbow love him so forth when he comes now the book of hoping this was the book of redemption a man and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon earth and cried with a loud voice notice how he cries now when he comes down he cries at as when a lion roar and the rare now but then ma'am when the whole Center is smoking say the Seventh Seal Rachel Mary he comes down and he cries that lamp ride ever line right of judgment and they the guard have wrought who can put proper sign now notice and cried with a loud voice and were lion roar and when he had cried when he began to speak in judgment see seven thunders or the divorces and when a seventh I've had all of their voices this is journey for the whole thing in a vision I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and also by the way right here may Trinitarian they can't understand how can't write be upon earth and also that they don't hear voice of heaviness right here right up on there a voice from heaven amen and see you up not those things and when acidified other voices around her I'll but the right now her voice from heaven they done to me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and rights of not an angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and Aaron and the things that therein are and a thief and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer no longer a delay for everything that takes place upon the earth that's what it means now notice what in the days of the voice that the trumpet the word about the set of angel when he shall begin sound when he's about the sound when he begins his ministry that's what it means the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the front I a man made a lot of listen to the reading of his word now notice here when the seven danger when he is about to sound we want to file this morning when he sounded see therefore when he begins to sell all the mysteries in this book should be finished the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven such as a serpent seeing the Baptism and women preach it in so for all these things barely finish when he begins the sound but at the end of his message say that's no different there at the end of this very message then the mighty angel comes down eight and order of thought the seven thunders at the end of this message and we know right now we're just at the end of his ministry ready in his ministry is getting ready to go into the final third time therefore better at the end of his ministry well at the end of the seventh angels ministry a mighty angel comes Vera Alleluia and others are seven thunders and in that's the end of everything that's what we are trying to approach this morning and also last week and you just can't walk in and then - because speak about it there's so many avenues which lead into it because it is the consummation of everything now we notice that region from Amos then you speaking here God always warns the world nothing can happen unless there's a reason for it therefore there can be no judgment unless God has more the people from what they are doing and are doing right now then right everybody names the furchester there nothing can happen unless God will first warn you through his mercy and free mercy we have a prophet is that right we want to take our turn and to proved about God Lord nor of the flood we all know that right God warned Abraham and lot of the destruction of Sodom and gone and God warned Joseph of the seven years famine he also warned lows of the ten plagues he warned Jonah of Nineveh that right and then the the Old Testament from Genesis up to the book of Malachi Bill all the Jews were warned that there Christ Ian knowing that one was coming it runs from genesis 3:15 all the way through the fire literary and is the blood cord running straight through the Bible right up to Malachi therefore everybody was warned shall send my messenger before my faith you're the bestest everybody was warned now in all time and was called grace God has warned us by the same books and added the New Testament Peter and Paul James and John to warn us of the time when he's coming up on this earth as a thief in the night they're right and then he even took kept this off he took his servant John out on the Isle of Patmos and there he let's read from revelation with the first shepherdess to front of what he did did he took John in the spirit on the Lord's Day in the spirit he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and this is what happened this book of Revelation is a tremendous book the revelation this means the unveiling the uncovering of Jesus Christ to me now this was this word right here right that's what it means but when you understand this word right here unfairly revelation then the unveiling or the uncovering of Jesus which God gave unto Him God gave us him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his angel unto his servant John Dean ward now John was taking out on our campus God this whole book was written by God any man I made God Himself through John he just kept apparently in spirit therefore this whole book is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen go there right now therefore in the Greek that's what this word means there now the day of Christ is broken down into three words this word and this one and I have another one I can't pronounce it this in first so if some because here last week there is a PR PHA in ei8 which means appearing well therefore if three words associated with the day of Christ now in 1st Corinthians the seventh verse ever read to you before waiting for though this they waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus when disco the book of Revelation comes all the way to break it down to you when the book of Revelation is revealed to you see the thing that our aim here will keep you step there and continue to the end when the Christ Himself will come with a shout thank you in other words the son of man is the Word of God the book of Revelation is the Word of God and that right there for a certain time see an appointed season he would reveal the book of Revelation to his servants and and when the Sheep the bride of Jesus would see with end old six seals senator cages and all those different things in there they would know that that is the Word of God yeah there's no one be honest shouted out any denomination could not rethink that only the Sheep can receive that hey where is the word and bringing a witness to the word then therefore the book of Revelation in the unveiling is the revelation is the coming of the Lord can you an offender can only get there then everything will open up to you and you'll understand I thought of being there for this revelation this uncovering will be in a little humble manner I wrote it a way that is the word the runners come to a prophet dinner I know where there was seven mysterious seals just try to put your funding behind a curtain pull that curtain back and the mystery is solved all right well or because two years ago God pulled back the curtain on the first field it will sound that right it was unveiled and then by the word that right and the word come to a prophet amen now we can begin to understand what we see why you must approach the Seventh Seal with understanding and with reverence now they're going to be many spirits running out to Arizona wanting to attend not even knowing what that is not even know it is the end of the whole world right any of everything there pull so that cannot be stable being will be preached to by a little humble man and that is the absolute and over him can you that's why you heard brother Kirk for the what about so me I don't want to run into God's prophets face I want to get myself ready so stand in the presence of the Son of man I want to be in a snail a no siree I want the sickness God then to stop it with the word of God to reveal to reveal Jesus Christ in this hour well it who reveal it on tape I have it or he revealed because through a minister I got it well then what he came to reveal receive that as we go forward but they don't want that they want to fall after him you found it out in here and he revealed away right here who has been revealed we would not what he sent his prophet to do - you know I hear ya that word wherever that watch you out my but they cannot do that they work the father ever the front of me he did intend to do that otherwise he restore all the word the way they look there's so much royal on these tapes that you can't even receive it I'm right and you can't receive a man what is even being pre trade you can't receive that well then why keep skipping and hopping and jumping and don't even wash yourselves out by the way well the Bible says the bride has made herself ready ever seen that Africa Europe Australia where else she that she's making herself ready by the word which was uncovered unveiled by the puppet and that is the coming of the Holy Name that's the coming of the Lord in this space right here you see anything head for with this faithful that is his personal presence in the ear with a shout they no time to get ready this item because his work is before him was only blameless without on illegal but without spot or wrinkle fine this right here this here makes you without spot or wrinkle the word on anything for when he come in this form here you're already ready to go interruption hope you understand hey man well therefore it doesn't matter where you run to or what you're doing is whether you receive the word and if I wanna do a voice of God the little goddess to believe the word right and then believe a word that has been unveiled on color a mad never had amen now over here I can never get to that point every door now the Seventh Seal is the end of time is the end of the church age is the end of nature in the world enter the vowels judgments is the end of everything it osseous envy Millennial Kingdom the Seventh Seal listen when that prophet comes in that tent can you understand that that's the end of the world so don't be trying to run up there that's the end of the world how are you ready the standard of president of man are you ready that's why the Holy spirt head of hair brother Kurt he's just big of restroom telling you all these different things wonderful teachings back in the Old Testament Brotherhood charleen it gets you ready for your blood won't be on our hands when that tent comes here for every present here will know what they are supposed to do when that team strikes this earth which is the service fee of pain and we'll show you by the Word of God this morning therefore the breaking of the seal is so great if for tremendous for in a seventh seal breaks according to the book of Revelation a chapter that is silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour now we know according the way of God there is never silence in heaven for the angels of Seraphim children around the throne of God crown holy holy Lord continually Haven here what happens when this thousand hair go to Spain for the half an hour every day sure nothing is said for his soul holy and what happens is that comes down a half an hour for sure Oh a short period time that's how we'll be down here and remember it's time no longer no longer time there's no delay things happen like that therefore get ready now any of the word of God you won't have time here it could be be filthy hey be holy be holy Bridget demands a getting in you cannot change your nature when he comes upon this earth we're trying to prepare you to get ready now this is a mystery this always we've had unveiled by the coming of the Lord for a man we've had six seals riddims in a son of man when he was revealing himself he revealed 60 letter and they all are mysteries see on the back side of the book of redemption now notice and the seven thunders are not even written in the book you cannot know them only when Christ Himself comes up on earth as part of them he s for his bride no my l can hear it it has a test why right now who can receive the word in this page right here how many people are here receiving the word out of millions to dinner on amazing three right here this is your only few and also a few others receiving the word therefore was he changed them up over here and all of the seven front is still right so therefore how can they repeat a certain fungus when they can't receive what ball right now only the bride can hear it that's for therefore we know that when this mystery is to be to be made known it will be right around the time when Jesus appears on the earth for his bride now he comes there he another body his corporal body is still affair but seat on anointing comes down earth and we're going to prove it this morning the anointing the annoying one we go so I comes up on Eric yeah see he meant and hide yourself behind human always if we have the Holy Ghost in us that's gone well then God can certainly put the whole anointing into a prophet in my head has gotten death anointing in any man and there it'll be so humble that's all that's all brother friend for me is what God is now we want to approach this seventh seal with understanding and with reverence now could I want to speak about the Prophet now um now once big about the day of the Lord the day of the Lord you find in Isaiah to twelve thirteen six and eleven revelation 6:12 they envelope Merrill and explain what this is here from the cross Jesus Christ and they are Pentecost act 2:38 up to here up to here that is the seven churches you now have it broken down for the seventh circuit agent or broker report in to the morning reformers and cold out we are now in the cold out space but you can see and understand where we are put it on the board now the Reformers they started with want Anubis we all know how to means was as they were wanted back in his period of time up to us Martin Luther then came the spirit of man to the Reformers and we're living right in the spirit of man right now but the spirit of man age is lapping over and to the spirit of the eagle this is now that Eagle II ain't mad and God has calls from eagle to reveal the word amen only the Eagles can reveal the word every now and then the egos there won't be who you think that that they should be because when he sent John the Baptist who was an eagle he had awful strange clothes my age range who knows how long people black robe therefore he looking for needle don't look for him and some of these are the churches out there you won't find them there soon enough they'll be truly dedicated to the Word of God and but you will like the way sound know whether it be the Word of God now from Luther up to 1906 when the Holy Spirit was poured out into the street California hears this line right here from there up to here and I've got a little ladder right here that is what we call the layout of scene church each see you find revelation 3:14 through 22 this is also called a cloudy day last week code we went to Ezekiel to present this day God's sheep would be in the hands of ruthless of the karuma's pastors and men with the spirit of bailiff own thing I am as sheep would be in their hands but he said and it's cloudy and dark day see then even time is shall be light he'd send light the word he says them Eagles Ravens with the message and it comes and blast these men no matter what these ministers or not they've come with the word the word over just the work and they be truly dedicated to the Word of God and then they begin to call out the sheep from here and there so forth meanwhile the anointing when he comes with the full word of God now from here up there there's the layoffs new churches this period he had also called the called out period called out from what you were called out from this in there you will see virtually dead alright you will die wretched miserable poor naked anyway until a little humble problem with the Word of God came on the scene everyone admired already that probably was Malachi 4 5 & 6 st. Luke's 1730 and revelation 10 7 film that was him not fully being manifested yet see so therefore he came with a sign now he has three ministries he has the Ministry of Moses the Ministry of the methanol Aegean and the Messi of Christ now when he first came he had a sign in his wrist here a 9 left hand and take your hand and if a farmer it would be a red blush he was show up here according to a certain disease that was the Ministry of motion of profit a sign and therefore he'd pray for a name the Lord you be healed that happened between 1947 8 9 50 51 right through there then the ministry change enter the Ministry of Elijah then he began to rebuke Jezebel tank women false prophets right there right and you began to freedom in Jesus name he began to bring out all these mystery of his hidden things he was beginning to sound that there are and he began to sound he gathered up all the mysteries and made him known to God servants you and all around earth better right yeah now he still has another mystery left this is a landfill that is the Ministry of Christ the word and up on the earth we are approaching that is the seventh seal that's what we are trying to approach with reverence now when he called out we found out this summer last summer that the bride is cold there was on the tape called the masterpieces that the bride is called and a few of them are out of step well he's getting them instead she's already called bride a man and how you know it she's making herself ready right now even while all of the running around trying to understand what's going stir bride is making herself ready right now now when that happened she calls God open up the seven seals six of them were open if I put it in this gap right here so you understand now we have it as a call out there is the brightest call when she's called he opened up the seven seals see 17 open up six seals open now God sent down every day the Spirit Lord came into the room the anointing and revealed to hit the word came to his prophet every day and reveal each seal day by day and therefore that what if the Spirit of God is rayna right at war right therefore that could not have been the form of rain on the day of Pentecost for that was a teaching ring I acts 2:38 and so forth and so on but that was something different there was the lettering the listener agency that was arraigned the inspiration and also eloquence in the Greek is called that rain came down and open up everything and there from that time when it six steals open up then everybody was wondering was the blood on the seat or off the seat that is because it wasn't sure therefore here was the lamb opening up each sealed up there so you can set it down did down it down from the anointing opens it up he stopped on a Saturday at the sixth field had he opened the Seventh Seal on that Sunday it all be over I say hi he doe Belka he held it back for this space of time in here investigation judgment by the word now from the servants from the Seventh Seal in 1916 to a thing a little bit worse of Tamara you are being whether you know it or not you are being investigated by the Word of God now doing this time also a lot of our dear sisters they just can't get this the Word of God funding goes out the Holy Ghost the word I got to tell you don't have the Holy Ghost the prophet of God says don't do nothing then the son of man told you on a tape call the token don't do know that right even that he said that now the same son of man open up the seven fields also told you sisters especially don't do nothing but yet many are right now trying to teach and trying to preach now if God will draw Souls through you sure you will but is that his perfect whim or is that his permissive will see them email you are being investigated you yourself those of you because the bride makes herself ready lot of washing of the water by the word therefore up to you yourself to make yourself ready so they may know because every place they don't have ministers the people they don't have no confidence in the ministers and so forth in the message well that's according to the Word of God the Son of Man that when I return according to st. Luke 18 sharper faith upon earth needed faith in a whole body of revealed dream well a minister is in the body of truth and therefore if that's broken break1 scripture there there's no thing it's not complete so therefore but here in there he that believeth without seeing him in out II if I can find no matter who they are what they look like a way I come from if I can find one man who believes the inside my profit I'll bless them and then I didn't mean them welcome proven out and Saint John was with because comets Thomas had eternal life total of an apostle but he did not believe except I put my hand in your inner side then you believe better therefore jesus said right there blessed is he that believe it without seeing him and now we have many of his ministers who have to wait until the third close start then they'll believe we have a lot of who believe what I'll see you and as you just preach this word and then knowing is cutting and know that they're hurting people they know that because they have got to do it what has the several scriptures the line has roared and you can but prophesy right I cannot help I'm compelled to these things Peter says alright oh there's a stream thing and first within the ninth chapter now during this period the prophet of the Lord after seven seals in the statements now he said if you plant potatoes go back home and plant potatoes said right man wanna get married go back home and also get mad whatever you were doing before you came to the seven seals go home and do back don't change it Merrill but as spite of what he said they changed that and they started selling homes and so forth and going here and there running all over the place running without the message right and then Sunnah now even the mythity for a no point of time but don't tell it shall come and here last time they won't come before that time again and then when it comes only or veins consecrated vessels can receive it when it comes now therefore oh that's this time right here now this time also this time also is the time of the investigation judgment now from the seventh sealed up tomorrow the whole word is in effect okay yes other words the forward the latter II compound and reveal the revelation the book of Revelation and therefore that book of Revelation is the coming of the law and he made one phase C in the uncovering face other words his words was bound up hidden in the denomination there right a man's over there for when he comes he comes in one phase to uncover the word let the Sheep see it and I believe that from here there's a book then they come out when the word uncovered it see if any kind in it right then because they come out there on blind faith then they are persecuted and mocked and scuffin that's alright but as we read in 1st Corinthians 7 when he comes he will confirm you he was driven you he will keep you on till the end in the day of Christ and a man he'll do it himself better you do it right now now notice who's doing it the weathered yeah nothing random the word in him is doing it but the unspiritual water running after his flesh and innocent it you see now brother brown because he had a Christmas tree here about about three years ago when he preached Christianity and also Dollar Tree and a brother ships's who preached that mentor and Sonny I think it was and went to his house and saw a tree in his house when rang his Bell and called him a false prophet he said you preached against the tree and you had one in your house and you left the message they haven't about three years ago now what the word says about that now God's prophets he make them do different things one may had a merry prostitute there right and they owned their children another had to eat dome that right left one aside for because for for many days now if he told brother branham to eat down should you eat them Samina if he told him to marry of process living if he's a lay upon inside for a year are you supposed to have veto his private duty therefore is his prophet has a Christmas treats do you have to have one I never do what the word says and know what he's doing but they are missing it he's here not in this whole thing he'll make his prophet is a son and not of the science they are told by God what to do but they give you the word and you ought to do what's in the word in had and don't look at him look at the word say well therefore are going to put we find that people don't understand this here now since that time the full word is in effect amen now this means as we saw that the champ is pulling away from the complete the green alright and a prophet of God told us hold on a tape to harvest time we've preached right here different messages which you all know year that was ordained of God and it was badly pleasing he there for others can understand the smell they cannot understand that but don't judge anything well when this seventh seal breaks every man will have his praise of God you won't have to worry you want to say anything because either you will be a corner we are you will not even one of no matter what you say here right here means nothing to God when that seventh seal breaks either you have or you don't have it one of the other four therefore in a natural noun the wheat upon area is laying in the presence of that s UN son that right and then now in a summertime as son must get hotter gets hotter and hotter and it is to perfect the wheat the same son perfect diaz of the guitar all fall into weeds they all protected by the presence of the Sun there are in it I see we unfairness now even now the F oh and of man son of man when his presence is unveiled revealed we the corner wheat in his presence of the word and we are being perfected also just like in the natural matrix and why well we are laying in the presence of the fon of man and then just as a natural wheat lays in the presence of the SU in and a shine upon it that's when the sherry out tell us hey can you understand about amen I need to prove it out Genesis 1:14 you ought to get it this is 114 just now just 114 now notice on the fourth day the first thing we find that God call God separate the light from day that right on the first day now on the first day when you come to the Lord God turns you around from darkness that right and you repent turn around you are separated right there light for babe soon enough the next thing when a second day waters is covering the earth that's the type of baptism they say waters cover everything he divided the waters on the third day and only on the third day life appears on the land the third day is resurrection time there is the third day that one is here it is here from here with a spirit of man but Christ that our sin our promise therefore all flesh this was only the restoration of life coming back into the church there right man prove that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I that was a birthday now notice up in the sky was the Sun and in the moon and the star but they couldn't see it because there was vapor up on mirror that right in there but therefore only in the fourth day see the rise justification sanctification Holy Ghost were a man before right that is deliverance now and just 1:14 and God said Let there be lights in the firmament heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon their therefore in the fourth day God where is made master to give light up on their shine for the lightest company in the fourth day the day of the word of God light is the shine go ahead in the day of the Word of God can we understand as me in a now what is the word made manifest the son was the word made manifest let there be and it was therefore this description here needs no interpretation I interpretated also their argument then Meraki form when it comes it will need no interpretation for it will be the complete restoration of everything of his life and he'll just speak the word yeah there was that word for that I will manifest itself right if we have that ready enough we will manifest ourselves all right it's got to be I didn't need no interpretation for that he met their Lord we know beyond a shadow of a doubt even in the springtime when the Sun issue and shines upon earth and begins to bring him all life that right to follow from the plantain football botany land when it shines upon it all right that when a son of man when he breaks foot at the bright and morning star when he charged although the seed the Word of God leading us if the seed be planet when the air oh and sharing it breaks forth ever break Morningstar you will come right you can't do anything then you be change change from our run into a butterfly don't happen this God is the anointing you get it well it's the anointing of the Lord now we know that copies or call God that write it as a John 10 34 and 35 the prophets are called God's now why the word of the Lord comes to the prophets there right amen now Moses and the different prophets they had the words for their own age then you understand who is about to come now each prophet had a portion of the Word of God for his own time therefore they were called gods for that hour oh my man shuttle God right there you for that yes that's why if you read back in the Old Testament the old men fell down and Reavis those prophets man they were reverent they were revering God in that man and here we have these died wretched miserable Gentiles and seal is God walking up on earth and a prophet and they just say all kind of things and all this is that everyone taking that gift of so forth and so on no reverence no wonder Sarah got nothing and here and not now no difference now Christ was the forward veteran in all the ages he was the Word made flesh upon their right in it now that same word is going to be up on Eric when the seventh seal breaks not a portion but the entire work and on there and a home alone man called never and you understand seven steel is greater than all put together well be Christ on the earth Louis you have been made is eco had a portion of the word give my portion of the word I their portion without only what this prophet has the full word those are all time for everything why you can prove with this in heaven now right now we want to prove this out Jesus Christ was a man that right now notice Adam was the seed of God's Word over it God's Spirit says that they be Adam his words formed animal and it was a seed from that word therefore that seat if that seed be planted in ground it will bring forth another one just like him Abel that right yes - the Romero it was the seed of the word what Jesus Christ his word I mean his flesh was the word Saint John 1:14 the word was made flesh in it right now now we near amber brown see we have that word which was made flesh in a man which having a formal anointing we go yes very worried see what is in the form of the anointing for his corporal body the flesh is up in heaven man see but we hear that word in us in C form from the heyday see now that word is the rainfall fruit ordinary it will when he sends that anoint you he'll bring it that's right well therefore Jesus Christ was the Word made flesh now John the battle he was a prophet that were I came to John the Prophet the full word came to John all right man what he felt times him now notice Jesus Christ had the Holy Ghost there right amen he had the who he was born with the Holy Ghost yet he did not have that full anointing is that right man well we prove it by the scripture that when he stood in the water and go by the water the dog the pillar fire the anointing I believe he stood up on the earth and said the Son of Man which is in heaven what have you seen him go back up standing and go back up to heaven he was standing up on our evidence saying he was in him he told Nicodemus now notice the anointing the Dove the pill fire that's then anointing which was poured out on him without measure oh you know I ran over him see it was the whole thing that fell up on Christ to give him a ministry create anything you want to do I gone to his father's will and you walk the earth that full anointing but notice now that full anointing wasn't a work of fresh up in the pulpit he would speak quietly but his voice would just go on where is sharpening two-edged sword is cutting you just just being spoken solemnly just the word that's only what that's the word he went out he had a full anointing up on him in the temple and he sat down and pulled up the book when he read from Isaiah I think it was 61 min and says now and just close up the book the spare Lord is upon me to preach and so forth but he came to a certain verse which is the day of vengeance he stopped right there for that day of vengeance belongs to him now even Jimmy know and he's out there that was from that time up to now was the accessible from there up to now up to here was the day of the accessible here below or we've asked but from here this is vision that belongs to him now or fruits on the day of the Lord in Isaiah 13 so you understand it is not the day of Christ Isaiah 13 the day of the Lord is not the day of Christ from the six birds Howie for the day of the Lord is at hand is at hand it shall come as destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one another their faith shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh crew both of wrath and fierce anger to lay the land discipline and he shall destroy the scent of them out of it for the stars of heaven the constellations thereof shall not give that light that Sun shall be darkened and it's going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for the evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the holiness of the terrible now notice here there's a change in nature there anything that we found out from when the sixth seal breaks two prophets come on the scene the very thing that happens there happens when they come on the scene all right which is over here right here the day of the Lord stopped right here when those prophets come on the scene and the son don't give a light and so in the moon the blood that's when the day of wrath of Almighty God stopped but this time in here is the day of Christ that has passed us by already ready amen it's right one phase other the hell had almost passes by that's right have almost passed already and they don't even know it proven he said I'll come as a thief in the night amen and they didn't know it they don't know right now this here is the day of Christ this here pruned up by the scriptures from the sixth seal and eyes they're 15 and other ones of Revelation 19 is the day of the Lord the end of the world end of everything as the wrath of Almighty God is poured out without mixture upon the earth you doing these three and a half years here that's the reign of the Beast that's when these two prophets strike the earth with everything are all kind of pleased everything else and notice now these prophets appear just before this time up on there and they call out 144,000 now where are we at right now you right in here okay waiting for this here to break this well don't be run to attend so that is the end of everything you make sure that when you run at you ready make sure you're ready to stand before the Son of Man now therefore Jesus Christ at the Jordan River the anointing came down and annoying him to preach the gospel right and he was sickened to kappa there was everything else that anointing that was the power of God the full measure of the Spirit of God upon the earth there right amen now that same anointing now the seventh seal speaking about the seventh seal now Moses and Elijah they are the sixth seal of prophet only our prophet can open a seal and for Moses and Elijah open up this sixth seal here better right yeah well then you have mold analyze if you opened the sixth seal the son of man is certainly open at seven sealed sarah only our prophet can open a field I believe there were he the son of man is the prophet of God is the NICU a man hallelujah you think is it how will you know it it will be the word the anointed made manifest you will have to try and determine it it'll be right there if there's either being I just speak to win it again may Memphis being a VA right before the people that will be Malachi 4 5 & 6 to restore take everything back to the way it was here yeah he takes your faith back there see and when you see that now knowing strikes the seat is to eat if the spirit is the age of the Eagles the Word of God will be flowing like water out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water hey there right everything be flowing they can't not even up door would be able to wag of tongue not it's Vegas tail against you nothing can happen to you not now no is now martyrs reformers and called out now a lot of people are waiting for this that happened over here and they'll miss it cinnamon them they waiting for a lot of laughter's not going to be that way from Oregon be a few people anyway now there are some who are they have been ordained to shed their blood but we all know who they are but this is the call-out each when they receive the Word of God humbly die off spiritually and cross the Jordan and notice when Joshua ate a type of the Holy Ghost crossed over the Jordan who does he meet over there just uh the captain of the hope that right he meets the cap out of the hole standing out on holy ground well when n7 field break that is holy ground that is the son of man up on that Malachi 4:5 and so forth see me no human and therefore notice now after Joshua and they cross over that's when they have the word the sword in the end time and shall be no longer the time as you know it won't be no more be different tired now white anything in here friend charge you a was planing and ask God for more time sons standstill veteran same thing happiness whatever God wants the happier happen the time will be redeemed amen great as you get this hey my my a ready so therefore we find that this seven steel as we approach it is our tremendous thing now what is the Seventh Seal is God's thoughts same completely in his prophets mind let me know you becoming manifest in the word God's thought and your mind is the word spoken out in it you probably know and therefore if the full anointed christ is in his prophet then he has a mind of Christ send me now and he just speaks it in here there what legal no and it may happen beautiful you see enough then the bread will be the same way anyway if we have the mind of Christ will do nothing except we hear from heaven and nothing except our Father show us then we will have dust after all what you say will be dot there belong and where is thought where it made manifest we know also that in those seven thunders the prophets said that God's name is to be revealed to the bride now do you know what naming name means presence name means self very own self well God's very own self will be revealed to the bride for it will be in her ever personal so now I know this is by God's ladies things they preserve what can you do mm boy now this seventh seal will be Malachi for pain Luke 1730 revelation ten servants may benefit see right now we are staying with the word their market is stop enough all right but God when the time comes is going to make the word in a medicine they all will see what is in you it will come out you'll be changed from a word into a cutter five heels of the change now here's how we know now in this of seven steel also we know that there will be sold preached to that cannot be safe there must be a ministry Christ has the only ministries that can preach the soul that can't be safe it's his ministry say therefore that's a message eases Christ now to prove this how we've been through this before where as the priests here last spring your last last fall or time for reflection all right I reflect back and understand these things now when Noah preached his message mercy they spurned it then God gave time grace to bring in his family you bring it in your families now bring in the family in this time right here see bring them in lay the token on the line of prophet said so and claim your family amen in it if you have the face but therefore know what did the same thing the door was shut to the outside he brought in his son in their lives their eyes then when they come in the door to the art was shut but then are set up on the earth for seven days I let write doing the breaking of the seventh seal okay nobody could be fabled for the door was shut but Noah and his family was in the ark nice and they were up on the earth and a judgment that happened here oh well seven why the seventh seal was broken the seven days along that right amen I hope you get it if you get a say man praise God it is right now they are sitting there as a witness or testimony that the Word of God is true and yes sir God will interpret it own word and you approve it too then Jesus Christ his third pole upon the cross where it was because crucified that right there the Spirit of God with that increase two souls in prison now when Noah said in the art that was resurrection for all and judgment for the people that live up on earth and amen therefore they could not be saved and at heart preached to them as a witness against them there are then Jesus Christ went down into the he went down into or the but be Hades and so forth and preach the souls that could not be saved sometimes this will be is back in the time of nor according to first Peter 3 read write and add your name Norah's now he had two priests it O soul then he turned right around and took all the Seas from Adam on down all right all around get on the same gospel and they received at the head to the word and took them and they came up and walked around Jerusalem resurrection time doing the third pull on it therefore that's two three is the confirmation therefore when this seventh seal breaks you will be resurrected here we found less we get two things haven't happened after God came in human flesh the next thing that happened after he came in he was flesh Abraham's body was turned back resurrected amen well when God in human flesh preached this tennis he'll follow a net will be your resurrection time upon earth these are only some of the things in the 17th everything is in there but that is that is the feel of redemption that's the redemption that's why I Paul Thissen grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption telling them hey now we got you feelin this humble little servant of God will walk out there get a tent see go in there and all the people running back and forth and so forth that's alright but we have a type of that back in the or with uh becoming better because Rebecca received gold silver and Raymond alright amen for her but her mother father them they receive precious things and right here for when that tear comes they'll get healings and so forth with you to Brad you receive gold silver in a white raiment they're right here old you are therefore they're 1 megohm for that team to get on the lane whether it is that's what they'll get but you have eternal life why were you coming to mount 9 s 1 yeah you're coming to Mount Zion it'll be the melt - or even right diese it was back in the light of time it was the amount - for Kemal Carmel their mouths Transfiguration now Mount Zion and will fire in the Word of God and Mount Zion what takes place at Meltzer Amen now we found in North time that the door was shut in their faces they receive the Word of God therefore God will do nothing except he revealeth secrets to his prophet he told more that there was a flood coming no appreciate by faith inspiration though he didn't see it he moved fear to the saving of his house but right and then a man now that had received this from the fun of men he would fear to the saving of his house and he'll at night but know they walk around prouder going over here and this man and they know that sediment that I was here therefore when the son of man be revealed we ought to be moving with fear but we're not see so therefore that Ark sat down as a witness a testimony against everything Christ went down for a witness well they were this'll be innate did not receive it therefore when the seventh seal breaks giving you our type in the Old Testament if other words it is damnation and resurrection to put it bluntly their nation and resurrection Christ went down there they was damned don't let believe he took them up with it right man with the seventh seal breaks because you believe the coming of the wall right now failing theory now as in your heart then you come down up on the earth the dough the pillow fire do you annoy that one amen and it will be in a man up on earth God in a human skinny man and he will redeem his people - he told mold I am calm down the brainy pushed me down do you know the brain Busch the dog the fireball the same thing the camera the whole same thing God and you've infected all the same Jesus Christ then if he came down then why can't he come down now hey what's more strange about that the lion has roared who can but prophesy and then send the Word of God hey let me finish off here cuz I don't want because we too long I've been trying to get to this point we can hold it man you got to retain to see so when you see anybody and next month you'll just speak the word and you can L say but this is your word to me now all that's coming but you got to receive this first am coming you know it carry it will come now it's me what is this one no it's in length we all want to know it amen old hair ran down in one oh what is it all about let's turn the songs 133 we get an idea from the Word of God what is it like Taemin now we understand that this would be the third Pool C the annoying order for marriage there will be no more blood in the sanctuary to me now nobody can be saved is the end of the world here we came to say Amen and now here's what this anointing is like behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in work in unity now notice now is where God speaking here this unity say in unity now unity this unity is like the precious ointment anointing upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments now let us stop it Aaron was the type of the high priest there right yeah all right the anointing he was anointed with all and he was annoying without mission for it poured over his head and within his beard and all down his skirts his buddy there right well Christ ahead we are the body better anything now in the seventh seal breaks this anointing this ego anointed strike there see it's on the head the hip upon earth you know but it also pours out only in mind I know I know he will change you into a bottle-blonde you want to do it like every friend but that anointing is unity that is the only thing that will bring us into unity of a better perfect man that right morning Nancy Fijians for 11 through 15 now the devil has deceived many people who are supposed to be in this message for knocking out the unity no ministers and the very fire phone ministry is to bring them into the perfectional unto the statue of perfect man to unveiling the Word of God and they knock it out knock out their own selves well tonight as we take out one words in this book here you take your name up there right there for how can you believe ninety nine and a half percent and don't believe he has ministers and the prophet of God said on a tape identification with the mass appeal that they have a ministry up on the earth right now in a he said it came and it's gotta be somewhere there's a man's be somewhere is the Sun s you in a sharing up on the natural week and then the fo and son of man is shining on the we are in this present right there for this unity is like this precious ointment that just poured all over Aaron's head all down his beard all that is skirts all everywhere now this same annoying is also like to do Herman and as the do that descended upon the mountains of Zion for now knows are ads I'm well they're the LORD commanded the blessing even life forevermore and it was commanded at Zion and I was reading up in there one of the religious books here it said that at the dew on all our Herman in Zion was was very plentiful even and dry with and collision is dry out here but this anointing thing this beauty is like to do all now Herman and now and these two particular mountains that do was very wet even in dry weather all the time amen amen I have a picture that Dell wanted to read this before I find out Deuteronomy 28 no Leviticus Leviticus 25 21 god amen amen leviticus twenty one the biggest 20 no let's start at 18 wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit you shall eat your fill and dwell there and in safety and if you shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather and I nor gather now increase then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and shall bring forth fruit for three years now notice in the sixth year right now six thousand here one year is that a thousand years we're in the six thousand years God is commanding his blessing upon us then we met seven one breaks the money owed a daughter at the service field you won't so you will do anything I'll do anything myself you have to do anything into my annoying Punto and the part of man will shine down and you come to life amen three that's right I will command it in the six years and then you won't so anything for three years confirmation three God's number confirms it all the time mmm I do ramen 8:28 another scripture if you want to

blessing shall be the basket the store blessing shall be now when that dog comes in blessed shall be dog will now go without you our Joseph Joseph was blessed when he was in prison in a ditch anyway he was that he was blessed boy it was profession therefore you've got to be blessed for the age of perfection that right now the Lord shall caused our enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against it one way and flee before these seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon the endives storehouses and in all that Valve set of thy hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee the Lord shall establish the because of because of holy people unto himself and he has sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep commandment of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and notice now all the people there it shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord this scripture here if you read it from the amplified it says called by the name in the presence of the Lord that's what it says and they shall be afraid of the errand that's God's Word to us and that is perfection nobody can do nothing for God finally we'll show now I want to read here something from the amplified the scripture here in 1st Corinthians the seventh I want to nail that down to you so you'll understand that 1st Corinthians the first chapter the seventh verse again we want to Earth Day we can understand that then we can understand the unveiling of the book of Revelation the Word of God then we can also understand that when he comes with the blessings for his Saints that is the coming of the Lord in the air but now he's up on the earth revealing himself as a son of man on the earth communicating now he's on there revealing himself as a son of man that had a specified time he breaks the seventh seal the anointing comes down it runs down all over his body all over that is the capping Amos and then you have the pyramidal amen hi-oh go with Christ with that same annoying went to heaven and told his disciple I'll send it back to you there right here and in one day in the upper room it came a sound like a Russian money the purifier

and Omega this ain't going to begin I am in favor in a dream thing can you see it well then that is Malachi for being made manifest to the bride is perfection amen amen there is the change of our bodies amen it hasn't so hit a show the parts of the Archangel how do we have called up on her but before they happen is the resurrection you see a loved ones with it is right here and gather together in founders description tank well Israel was to possess the land which was their inheritance we are to possess our land our land is the redemption of our body even a mentally insane and therefore when they possess their land they gathered by families and we put this R additional bodies we gather by everybody Amen everybody do that then here the show the voice of the Archangel and he takes you in and as the proper law said you get up there ends a day of crowns of thing amen they are crowning they are color then every man have his priests hey have to worry about anything though I want to read this here then I won't finish all over seven this was reading from the amplified version but you can reach from this one here for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and his being made so that you come behind in no gift now waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ desperate to the reason this one now this is the amplifier for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and he is being made visible to all see that's what I'm speaking about here right now his being mate has been uncovered the word anything now when this word is uncovered this is what it will do who shall can also confirm you on to the end that you may be blameless and spotless and so forth in the day which is the rapture of our Lord Jesus Christ now reading from here and he the son of man will establish you to the end keep you steadfast give you strength and guarantee your vindication that is your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ on the side then there's nothing look God is doing this himself yeah if you only stop sewing trying to do your own words God can work among you we have women here who still or trying to break the Scriptures we know who they are they're still trying to break this baptism down they're still trying to teach and so forth and doing this here God it is finished the bride is called I believe you one day make up in your mind that you'll finally Lord God not my will but your will be done yeah if God wants you to say nothing do that do you know if you only do it because you'll miss it if you don't do it you'll miss it you most certainly will miss he won't yes Lucas is placing time to the main mouth this brother was placed in here brother Nina was placed in here well the fact they were placed in here at the amazing time on there but you have to wait until God places you don't try to run before he place you you sitting here now God is placing his friends of God now he took them hands there as he could fire one he can use at that time he has a job for every sister in here he will use every one it may be for a minute or maybe for 15 min I don't know but he will use every member of the body of Jesus Christ amen well he can only use you when he gives you power for service not your own human power which is your own mind what you want to do but his powerful service which is holy a male and you give us attract this mess that's wonderful but that spirit of man I mean that's finish woodsy and we end the spirit of the eagle eat a man and if you don't know anything then stop what you're doing your own work and come in and stop sewing because he has commanded a blessing upon name it'll be perfection amen now we understand this morning yeah our prayer of you understand that's the the whole thing of the seal and what it all means the time we enter right now from the set of Steel down came a terrain that right up to right now this is what is called the investigation judgment and we also prove the mass week test that has a span in his hand I healed thoroughly because purchase floor his church he's doing it right now and the champ is being bump in here and the winds of doctrine is driving the chapel way that right you see them running arrows only hands they're all over the place that I can't being home away from Wesley and in but the wheat falls down to the ground right where he sold it at right there enough where he that we're right there we fall to the ground right there here we know as we approach the Seventh Seal with reverence with understanding see brother Curt I'll tell you you don't understand brother he understand it some of you understand what God has done to that name I mean he has given us understanding I mean I don't think how did you get it save me now he has give us an understanding of what it means to see in face of prophecy because it is on a cigar he'll hold it at your hands yeah but how are we thank God that we know about your approach is probably you don't run up in his face you can turn back happen yes your mother no part of the base stand back you leave him alone mmm but we prayed us more you instead of give you understanding of what we are facing now in your midst you have those who will talk against you teeka boxes as far right that's one of them because the count of joy when you fall into divers temptations and we want to ask you to because pray much for medicine here for work and pray for one one one another we have very tired and we begin to stutter in full force of tired body and need much prayer but we want to say that there's a trial there's a tremendous spiritual battle so be important here every day as because elsewhere so other words is this here the devil is trying to stop this work and that now you got to know it you knew before either he'll send in a wolf to scatter the sheep or he'll finally because toes you know all he'll do both say now that was dust festival from God right man therefore we are holding on to what the revelation of the outer hey now in hurry all along because we are being the whole yeah do they now there'll be others who use make well you understand save enough but that's all right we have to hold on they can do what they want to do they can go anywhere they want to do it but we are holding on right here give me now you're giving up meat in due season right here blessed is the servant when it comes fire giving out meat yes but they're not some flesh but nice and then the Word of God didn't aim out in due season right now so therefore in doing this some get hurt and they go here and go that we can't help that because the very thing he said was or because church order to try these spirits by the word and for therefore no matter what anybody says we see this we can see it spiritually coming in the hospital nobody know Wilma I want to tell you one thing because most of you because you'll notice here the devil has set every known spirit in here rather under myself have been tried by Nancy you know what every spirit is and you know what has because come through here from every known spirit from sex clean on down which is what this what the enemy is doing is how all kind of filthy Devils have come through here that's from some of the spirits now any enough of all different people and we've been tried by the Word of God right here a test to hold on to this word many brother have been hurt we can't help that because Jesus Christ he very many people all right and you couldn't call them snakes and everything else that right well therefore I want to say that many people say that so that they have love now I'm speaking about a brother here this more in the car because he's supposed to love brother Bram so much down it down had more auditory because they split hands around them and didn't wanted to because take up a low awesome and brother Branson please don't because do their brother Matt's impose a you want now he loves in so much place if you love me keep my Commandments but ever here was one very low I love my brother but refused to get baptized see and refused to do everything else he says but he loves now what is love keeping the will gun yeah therefore I by this shall all men know hey any man you keep that word any now that's how you in it but ever you can talk all you want to talk when you obey the word of God I know and then the only way that God can test whether you love is that you won't as you want to choose your brother you won't sticky you won't be evil against him because God is before you in your brother and you can't love your brother whom you see how can you love driving you have never seen an remember well therefore that shows that whatever then the heart comes out against your brother and so forth and over the word stays with that word now staying with the word means this because to you sister if you're on the phone sister calls you and wants to speak about this or that you say well my dear sister that is against the Word of God and she'll get mad then let a good man that's staying with you yeah now you'll have no friends no what's your favorite for me for you women to stay with God's Way when a system want to talk carnal say my dear sister I will not and I refuse to do that why because I love the Lord more they even a mess let us bow history Almighty God we thank you their father for your word this morning and Lord we're sorry that we took so much time and also watching people the Lord we feel by the Holy Spirit Lord since we have no
