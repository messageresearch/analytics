TRANSCRIPT
========================================
would you turn with me please to the word of God St John the 11th chapter as we all feeling fine now and we settle down and to see what the Lord has for us tonight I'm going to read from St John 11 1-6 and St John the 5th chapter 59 and also ecclesiastic 31 I'm reading from from St John the 11th chapter now a certain man was sick named Lazareth of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazareth was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus love Marthur and and her sister and also Lazareth when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was in St John 5:19 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also do it the son likewise Ecclesiastes 3 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven may God a blessing to the reading of word like a TI this little thought there is a season and time to everything shall we bow our heads just in a moment of prayer loving savior we approach thee tonight God knowing that thou are our father we are thy Sons and Daughters of thy kingdom and Lord such a glorious of a privilege We Have Tonight God to approach you with faith knowing that the blood of Jesus Christ cleans and sanctifies from all sin and we come God tonight believing Lord that thou our father and that you would in no wise hold anything back from us God so as we approach you tonight father we pray that Thy Thy Holy Spirit comes down tonight Lord God and takes the word of God and send it out to these these people sitting here father the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus may we have a time of Fellowship around the word but God we have been over there Lord and we learned that the word is for every situation God for every uh distress or whatever it is Lord we can take hold of the word of God and know that you'll answer us Lord for thou has created us to be here in the end time to manifest the word of life God to this Dying World out here so now Lord Jesus may you settle down thy servant God and anoint the word of God and anoint the people anoint our ears and our hearts to hear the word my God and to understand the word we pray heavenly father that you would heal the sick oh God and also give faith and also Comfort Lord to those that are weary and tired and suffering Lord and wondering what's going on my God may you come down tonight Lord and give a little light Lord and shine upon the people father we ask that th bless Thy word for we ask it in Jesus Christ name and for his glory amen praise the lord well excuse me my voice is a little husky I preached about 2 hours it's so Sunday morning and so but I just because I kept my promise that I was supposed to preach twice and that's all I preached over there and they want to preach more but that's I said I'd preach twice see so now um reading from the scripture here and hearing how so many things are going on many are moving about and a baby's coming forth and everything is happening here well that's wonderful see and the Bible says that there's a time for everything see and there's a time and things uh because that happened that changed the whole course of our lives and and speaking about natural lives here and Solomon speaking back here he says there's a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to be sorrowful a time to mourn a time because to be joyful and so forth and and we know now that in this hour now it seems like that we just can't get to the spot where we know actually what is going on and we know that something is going on we know that God has given us these promises we know that God cannot lie that he's going to do what he said he would do amen and but yet see we got to find get in that right Channel and find the time and the season when he's going to do it and then when we can find the time in the season and know exactly his will then we got that Faith amen and then when you can get that nothing can move you from that for you know where you're going amen and so many people now they're being tossed because to and fro and also back and forth for they don't know exactly what is is now transpiring they aren't sure which age are they in so God's Prophet told us make sure of of of the age you're in not to misplace the word don't because dislocate the word see make sure that you know the promise of your season and just take a note in the Bible here checking through the seven Church ages because I I have noted that is only in the seventh age that uh uh because these eyes are are to be anointed M just in that age of because all and then I say that if the seventh age if there was to be a predestinate ordained people for their eyes to be anointed to see then God for that age must have light for that age amen and I finding in the scripture that it dob tals that God said in the evening time that there would be light and in the seventh age that there would be eyes to see the light amen and we find that it dob Tails because right together and so therefore um there's a time and and because spiritual things because with God and there's a a time and also a season that God had for us to be born again and then excuse me um when spiritual things happen to his people he has a time and a place for them to happen and just like Israel's our type we know that God has ordered our steps here in the evening time he's ordered each step that we are going to take that's but we must find out let the light shine on the step so we know where we are going because as we stand here tonight we look into this Unseen World out here the spiritual world we can't see with these eyes into it see and it's because Dangerous Waters out there so therefore there's because two forces out there Satan and also God but if we are his people then we can step forward and look into this unseen see and here's where the faith comes in at amen something in you see you mean that it cannot be impersonated something in you tells you to take the step take it don't be afraid of it should I or shouldn't do it no something must tell you to take that step and I keep standing there and figuring one and may or make mistake so you make a mistake but all things work together so what you make a mistake see but therefore when you start to halt in between because of because two of because to opinion then Satan he confuses your mind see man now so so therefore to me God has given us the authority in Christ he has the power is that right then if we have his authority to walk and he give us light and anoint our eyes to see then walk amen is that right friends and then then when you take that step you just step out into the Unseen amen but when you your foot gets there by faith he sends the power amen he sends the power and you get out there in the Unseen you can't see out there but he can in you yes for he has anointed your inner man inside to see all around he's got a SW out in this Unseen World out is that right it's the word of God and then you speak it out there is that right friends and Satan must move amen praise our God because Israel there was a time and Al a purpose because for Israel there was a time for them to be down in Egypt is that right God had them down there and they were because crying out to God then there was a time when he should send forth a a prophet with a pill of fire to bring him into the Wilderness and there there was the church and then it was a time that they should come into this Promised Land into their heritance but Joshua had to wait for the time and the season to move amen see because God said I have given you the land but when the time and the season see you must meditate day and night in the word right and even now in this hour if you're reading your the newspapers and magazines the latest Spirit going around is to meditation thinking trying to contact that one source yes they're trying every way because these hippies cuz they were the shock troopers now they have because of because of abandoned that now now it is meditation by this Indian over here therefore what are they doing they are impersonating what we are supposed to be doing we are we have this God at there seeking we have him inside but all he's trying to do is to get a people that will sit still s down in into their prayer closet and let him talk to them yes and then when they are finished meditating on the Lord he tells them what to do and they stay on the word read the word and so forth and then walk out with faith for they have been in his presence these people in because right in the natural say that when they finish meditating they feel better and they do things better well then what about us if we have the word of God God in the end time with a message to tell us what to do and why are we always worrying and falling down we have a god telling us what to do and the word of God and they don't even go by the word of God Amen see so therefore for Footprints is possession amen you must take that step you cannot Halt and think because because shall I take it but take it and when you take it then you possess it so The Souls of your feet must stand there in that promised word land there and possess it amen praise God so we have this Authority but he has the power and Christ must send the power but we must step out on faith and believe what we are talking about so now we see in friends in this last hour now as far as we can move by faith see that much we have now possessed so now we here up here we cuz here in New York we're just moving by the spirit we are waiting and we are watching each day to see what is going on and this we know that every demon power must move aside if we walk in the word for that's where he told is to go at then if anybody is there brocking they must move aside for he told you to go there amen praise God praise the Lord so now God he himself he is in charge now we must know God's season and God's time to move cuz even right now in our lives right now many are moving about and so forth as God season it's his time for you to move around he is moving you himself he knows what is down the road what's going to happen so therefore he just moves you out and always so simple praise God so now we must understand God's will in this hour now just like brother br's Ministry speaking about it tonight just wanted to because be short tonight and drive something home to you see now speaking about his ministry I was over in because Jamaica there and got a chance to to just sit down and also listen and because to some old tapes and so forth and then I picked up a old tape and it's astounding here and this is a quote those Visions you see at the the platform are merely they are really they are Visions but not the real Visions they are that's you doing that that's not me it's you you are doing it yourself you are not conscious but you are doing you can't explain God so I thought about that there the Visions at the platform because they aren't the real ones you see and then he began to speak about the gift of God excuse me which is because of Jesus Christ and then he began explaining because that all because a as all of us know that God the Father uses his gift and he allows us to use the gift is that right and all of us wondered about that what was he talking about for over Hebrews 6:4 it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of this heavenly gift one gift see and we're made partakers of the Holy Ghost so then begin to because just thinking on that and how God operates well in this very hour right now all of us are waiting for this promise to be made manifest many are wondering what is the promise what's going to happen here if we should because move from here where will I go and so forth see that hasn't got one thing to do with it God is only trying to get a people in contact with him to meditate on because on him the word he will move you about himself am not in this because of because a physical place here but where he wants to move you himself see so now just thinking over here in St John the the 11th chapter here Lazarus he was sick and just before Lazar took sick God took Jesus Christ off to the side and showed him that Lazarus had to die see now he saw that already then in St John 11 here when he was there with his because disciples and had gone past uh because according to St John 10:40 it says he had gone past the River Jordan where John had baptized first and there they were Abiding and then a messenger comes and tells him that Lazar because he was sick so from because these experts say it's about 18 miles or so from where he was at over to Jerusalem and also Bethany so therefore that would just about take a whole Day's Journey because walking and so forth that's one day when the messenger cuz when he got there and told Christ that lar was sick now Jesus Christ had been in God's presence meditating see and the Lord had showed him what he wanted him to do amen and what was supposed to come to pass amen so he knew where he was going and what he had to do so when the messenger come that because Lazar was sick Jesus Christ in himself because he could have healed him that's right but the father had already told me he had to die so he just ignored them that's right you follow me now and a lot of times when we try to contact God we don't get no answer but God already knows what he wants to do in your situation that's right is that right am so he just ignored him and the messenger because went on back and I don't know whether Jesus Christ told him this here in in in the fourth verse but Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for of of of the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now this messenger could have taken this message back to Mary and Martha I don't know see now but but that's what he said see so therefore the message because went on back and therefore Lazareth was sick and Christ could have healed him see but the father said that he had to die and by his death he would glorify God and all of us know also that when brother Brandon was killed in his car was found the same scripture is that right the sickness is not unto because corruption death see because he's not dead but sleeping that's right see now but God was going to raise up Lazarus for a greater glory amen if he had healed him because that was one Glory but how much more Glory was it for him to because resurrect him from the dead amen you see now you got to understand the way God works that's right so this little short message tonight is to get us in this season and in this time for what is getting ready to take place which I believe in my heart something is fixing to happen but we ourselves must change our way of thinking see me now and come in tune with the word that's why we ought to read the word and meditate on the word amen then we see here that because the average person would say well why did he go heal him but the father had already told him that he had to die amen we just trying to drive home the point now see so therefore uh he knew what was going to happen so therefore then the son of man he had to be glorified by his death so now then God had showed him that he was going to die now notice because he Abode there two days see now he was not neglecting his love but waiting for the right time and season to demonstrate greater love and more power amen so when we seek the Lord he is not because neglecting you he's waiting for what he has ordained for you to happen and when it happens then you'll see it more perfectly amen praise God so therefore he could have healed brother brandham if he wanted to amen are you follow me friends that's right you see I mean now but uh is a greater glory for his Prophet to come forth in the resurrection amen as a sign a signal to the bride that the res the Rapture is at hand it's a greater glory for God in the resurrection for him to do that amen so we should never question what is God doing but get the mind of God to see what how God works and he's the same yesterday today and forever he changes not so whenever we get in a little trials and so forth and get all because worked up and everything he know what he's doing he's on the way he here two days then he had to walk over there because four days the messenger come one day he stayed there because because two extra days then he had to go over there it was 4 days is that right but he was on the way is that right when Martha she says Lord even now God is able to do what he wants to do amen cuz one time it took because Daniel when because because when he had prayed to the Lord that right took the angel of the Lord 21 days to get there the king all right the the prin of Persia had because detained him but it took him 21 days to get there but in the meantime he was seeking God God was working his will through him amen amen so therefore even if you're sick because get prayed for believe it one day soon he'll pass through your neighborhood and heal you that's all amen the word has been spoken amen so therefore he sent the word is not unto death and he passed by 4 days later and therefore the word spoke raised not un death and he come by and raised Lazarus from the dead amen see praise God so therefore now we see then that if we can get the mind of God see there's a purpose a time a season for every move we make and God is trying to get us to see that there's a purpose in a time what God is doing right now he is wening his bride right now for the life that passed through the blade and detasseling the shark passed through there has come out out in the open to live the message listen the life has come out now you can see it now because before it was hit hidden power has because come out in the open now amen see so therefore he is not neglecting us though we suffer long yeah amen amen though we suffer long he is not neglecting us shall not God avenge his elect though they cry day and night and though he bear long with them I tell you he shall speedily avenge them vindicate them amen he it he know what he's doing so he got us right here right where he wants us God has ordained for us to be right here tonight we're all doing exactly what he want us to do tonight and we can so see that like Jesus Christ saw it in his Prophet saw it then God can move with that people yes sir amen praise God so we see now that we have to find God's time and his season and his purpose and then with faith do it amen for who put up on your heart if it's right with the word and so forth do it then don't ever look back nowhere just keep moving forward amen praise God yes sir so therefore excuse me uh if you have prayed so forth and because different desires believe it it's going to happen see man it's going to happen for when because the angel came down to Daniel he said here because in uh I think it's Daniel 10 there fear not Daniel for from the first day listen now from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand Amen to understand and to because chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words amen so therefore he comes for our words he hears you right now soon as you speak it out God hears you yeah oh but he's on his way he's even on his way right now behold come quickly yes but it's in his time in his season and his purpose amen praise God he hears you in all of your problems yeah there is not one problem in here tonight that is too hard for himen behold is there anything any one little thing too hard for me any big thing too hard for me I'm the God of All Flesh amen he's only trying to get a people to believe that God is going to move with him people in the season in the time but he can only get that elected group who will believe that and hang out there and make footprints in the word of God and possess this inheritance he's looking for that friends and he's going to find them he's got them now being prepared and ripen and ready for the hour when he sends down the water upon him make sure of the season and the time praise God he will pass through your neighborhood one day soon amen he's on his way he's on his he is descending he's coming down right now but he sends down a shout first amen then a voice then a trumpet amen he's on his way down friends yes sir so therefore hold to that Jesus because he AB boed there too he knew what he was doing and they was all excited and everything but he knew exactly what he was doing the father told him he wanted to make sure he was dead because 4 days and he want to show the glory of God Amen when he said that this sickness is not unto death that's when they should have sought the Lord right there what did he mean by that you follow me now and he would answer them we got believe amen see so therefore now we see uh this call come for help and if a call ever comes to him because for help he will answer that call he can be touched by the feeling of infirmities amen all right now so therefore we see then uh turn to St John because of 11 please we want to show you something here tonight and and then when you can see God season and God's time it gives you much more faith to know what God is doing amen see so therefore now he got to Mary Martha and and I wouldn't try to because preach through there for he has already preached because because Believers out this amen he has preached that already see so I'll come over here to because verse 41 and so now we see over here now speaking about cuz Jesus Christ when he came up to the uh the the grave here then he told them to take away the stone first we must do something first move back all the clouds of unbelief and watch the sunshine shine out it cuz the sunshine is there but press back all the clouds he's been there all the time he doesn't change that right he's right there all the time see amen then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou Hast sent me see now if you notice here he prayed for an example cuz he said here that I say it for these that stand by is that right see so therefore when he had prayed here and also called because called forth because Lazar because from deg grave here he did not get weak that right but yet when a woman with this because a blood issue touched him because him of His Garment he said virtue has left me so now something's wrong somewhere that right but brother Bram told us that it would a time would come in because his ministry that he would not get weak is that right so therefore the time would come when he'd pray and he wouldn't get weak so now we see here as we watch because Jesus Christ Ministry here now when God showed Christ that Lazarus because was going to die that was God using the gift there's no weakness there you see he saw it and then he just because he knew exactly what was going to happen he just went ahead to the spot and acted out the drama now I'm laying this for a purpose so you'll see the ministry of the Bride coming up See it'll be just the same way amen praise our god it won't it won't change for he's the same yesterday today and forever but if we can find it in the word then we know where it's at amen see so therefore he God showed him God used the gift by vision for St John 5:19 says verily verily I say unto thee the son can do nothing of himself see it mean now but what he seeth by Vision what he seeth the father do is that right so he saw the father call Lazarus from the grave because using him he saw that in a vision that did not make him weak at all but if somebody would touch him from out in the audience virtue would leave him cuz you are pulling on the gift that's right from the other end of it amen see okay now brother Bram gave a wonderful example on the old tape he said it's like um two people at a circus one is is a little short fellow and with because little short legs and another one is like a tall fellow and there's a wall because by the circus and in the walls a hole the tall fell is God's prophet and the little fell is all the people so the tall fell he hops up and can look through the hole the little fell say what do you see he said I see an elephant then his arms is tiring so therefore he has to because come down he goes up again he gets tired I see a because a j and so forth and because so on that's you pulling on the vision but each time he goes up to see it makes him tired and virtue goes out of him are you foll me now okay that goes on and on till he gets just war and they have to because carry them out but the ring Master comes along and picks up this little fell like this and shows him the whole thing does this little fell get tired never he's sees everything and he's in the ring Mass his arms well that's God using the gift amen amen praise be to our God is that simple the ring Master who's in charge picks up the little fell us the people and shows them all things that's just what he meant God using the gift amen see now so therefore the woman with the because because blood issue she on him and virtue went out but when God showed him anything virtue never went out it was just a natural thing and brother BR says someday it will come to that see amen okay now praise the Lord so now that's God using his own gift so now brother Bram third pull if you remember in in that tent Vision uh that we all that everybody's all talking about um excuse me this is just part of it here it says this this Angel of the Lord spoke to him said this will not be a public show mhm is it not written in the scripture of our Lord's words when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly be not like the Hypocrites that make their public show of things but go into thy into your secret closet well Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then if Christ standing there St John 5:19 that he would do nothing except he would show Jesus Christ first amen he cannot do it of himself but the father doeth all things well then the same Christ was in William Brandon could he change that no he could not do except the father would show him first where at in the closet so he said in his third pull that he wouldn't get tired no more he said I'm sure you call it with because Collins boy also because lukim and so forth amen right he called me on the phone to pray for sister Lawson yes and then he prayed and then all this time we always wondering when he going to speak the word like th sayth the Lord see but he prayed so did he pray here in St John 11 is that right father thou H has heard me already we in secret in the closet but I'm only praying with because of brother Coleman here so he might believe that you sent me yeah are you following me friends are you following me now so he slipped out in a STD pool he prayed for the people as an example he have to do that the father had already showed him already in the secret closet what he going to do out in the open he just walked out in the open he could have said come forth whatever it was but he prayed heavenly father as we stand so humble and simple he prayed spoke the word and went pass right through us and everybody stood waiting for him to because come out with a public show and thus and so and so forth and so on when he has already done in the secret walked out as an example he prayed didn't have to do it right but for thou has already heard me in secret amen for he do nothing except help the father show him so that therefore if Christ had come in a shout you follow me now he couldn't do nothing in the third pull except the father had showed him already in secret amen amen well praise be to our God so therefore could can Christ change his pattern he cannot change his pattern amen so now friends then um um in the spoken word book it just come today and this just made me feel so good and uh I thought I would just read a portion of it because I happened to because I pick up this afternoon and I saw exactly what the Lord showed me over because in Jamaica it's right here in the B because right here in the spoken word come this afternoon so now I'm going to read it to you this is the part of the prophecy which he has spoken about because all of us are familiar with it now all right now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind Genesis 111 these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be so they will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be War one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can never are because produced this they will be they will produce their Creeds and dogmas mixed with the word and brings a a hybrid product the first son was spoken seed word of God he was given a bride I'm just reviewing the spirit and I was picking up because of what I said see a bride produced a to produce himself she fell see that's what the bride was giving uh to produce himself again another Son of God but she fell by high breeding SC produced himself but she fell caused him to Die the Second Son of spoken seed word of God was given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also for she was put to a free moral agency like Adam's wife was to believe God's word and live or doubted and die and she did now then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised notice now promised for his word in the Virgin don't miss that now there was a portion of the word promised for Christ and the prophet amen are you following me now which is this age right here seeing age but there's some more word promise for Christ in the Virgin bride which is the mind are you follow me now see let us know our promise know where we going and what we are looking for amen promised for his word in the Virgin other words what was promised because for because Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 was in the prophet he had to do that in the prophet now he has certain things to do in the bride resurrection and so forth that has that word is in the bride he must come to that word in the bride and fulfill the scripture in the bride amen amen that's our promise who knows no man-made creats or dogmas the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise now now watch this the promise is resurrection so that's all that he can do is that right he must act himself by his own word as his word therefore he must come down himself as a voice and act himself by that promised word for that age amen do you believe this here amen because because Mighty quiet amen if you believe it amen by his Word of Promise he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit room now womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be unto me as thou Hast said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was a written word isaah 9:6 they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head preeminence amen preeminence he is their head see and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his notice now what Harmony Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first that's what I'm trying to drive home tonight now here's brother Brown's own words Harmony between God and Christ see and he he quotes there St John 5:19 MH so will the bride yeah and and also notice and he shows her shows her his Word of Life how by Vision he shows her his word like he showed Christ that L he was supposed to die amen he showed because William brandham and so will he show the bride the word what to do right now we walk by sin yeah and that age the Mind age you'll see different you'll see Powers Visions signs wonders God and you won't doubt it amen you cannot doubt it for it'll break before you and you'll know what's written for when he comes in the resurrection when he come in the because first resurrection he come down to those because two discip on a road to because of Mayas for 6 hours almost he quoted scripture after scripture on his first coming is that right so if he comes the second time he must quote scripture after scripture on the Judgment the vials the plagues and all these things that happen Are you standing me friend then it'll be the word the written word for the hour shown to the bride and the mind know what she's doing and that super Rapture in faith will be there for she'll see the perfect will of God through vision that's the word that's nothing and therefore the prophet just walked right out there and did it amen then don't worry am I going to do it am I going to see it because how will I know it you'll know it in that day you shall know he'll make it so plain it'll be written right in front of you amen that be that'll be Christ in you God in you God was in Christ and he Christ he reveal God then if God is in you the word Satan cannot impersonate that you just know that you know you know amen I feel good tonight when I think of what God is getting ready to do friends and then when I think I Ain anything to do with it yes I'm going stand there with faith and believing in the hour that time the season the purpose of God has made known then what is it to faar what are you worrying about keep walking in the light in this hour now don't worry if you're moving there but God say move will move there wherever it is go on Amen or whatever you going to do do it with faith whatever you do do it with faith and brother de says faith amen praise God is that right God do it by faith now I feel good now amen so where I so will the bride and he shows her his word of life I open it up and saw I like to walk the floor cuz I was already had it in the scriptures already getting ready to preach it

saith the Lord so when David went out there to Faith because Goliath I come in the name of the Lord that's right amen Israel the church was scared is that right so was because of Saul because they couldn't come in his name they hadn't been doing right in his name but the bride has received word by word she's Justified never did in the first place though Satan tell you you sin every day how can you sin when the seed of God the seven seal lay in your heart how can you sin when the Seven Seals seven Thunder mess lay in your heart you cannot sin for the seed of God's in you thank you Lord and he has already Justified you before the foundation of the world s get back Satan move aside then take that step into unseen out there and then he sends the power to stand out there now others can't go there they don't know what it is out there see they're afraid to take that step but something strikes the heart you don't know you just move you I don't know I'm just standing here hallelujah just stand there then something will unfold to you and you see the whole glory of God Amen you got to move by faith friends yes sir so then David uh because like David he come in the name of the Lord and then a last one know well how can you be so confident amen he'll wonder the same thing this time how can I be so confident he's showing me to be here showing me everything that's why I'm so confident Satan cuz the word spoken in here I am right now the father will show me everything Goliath and Goliath got the step back amen David knew it and T I'm trying to show you there's nothing to fear nothing to worry about just wor just meditate in the word of God day and day and day out that's all something fixing to happen friends I want to get ready for it amen the bride make herself ready that right that's scripture praise our God then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves his purpose other words if he tell you to do something it's Quicken made spoken word is gerz and the Holy Spirit what is that spoken word it does it follow me now you speaking out out of the heart well who's in there seven seal seven thund message speaks out to your lips yes and it D therefore it is the voice age of the Resurrection will speak out the voice speaks this because powerful Vision breaks only he's just only using your body is that right he only wants to use your body that's all he don't want your mind the mind of Christ amen just the mind of Jesus J Christ they do only his will amen because I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still because because so just prove it to you then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them watch this now continuing his word to fulfill as he did because complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet second coming now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promis end time leader to take the the church over which was William brandom mhm with because of the shout message but many men today think they are Joshua when Joshua the Le has already taken us over we're sitting in the promised word waiting for the captain of the host to come down and they think I'm Joshua and I'm so so you ain't nothing now for the prophet has already taken us over already for God gave him the Joshua commission and they don't even know it see praise our God Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua stay with the word amen God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church and so do they right now he started us all in 63 with the word is that right 65 he went off the scene 66 up this that this thing go over there this and that see but those True Believers of that word that stays with it because trials persecutions despair knocked down dragged out that's all right stay with it Just Keep On Believing the word of God stay with it see to me now for he's going to come to the word this one thing we know the Holy Spirit which is the word can only come to the word nothing else so he can't come to men's ideas of what they think the word is amen it'll be it's thus sayth the word that's all it is amen so cuz notice how God did not move Israel until his own appointed time now listen this is this is going to mean something Joshua waited for that time oh how no matter how much people might have said God gave us a land because of the promise Let's us go now and take it they might have said Joshua CU you lost your commission because y all washed up why are you not doing something amen do something do what I'm waiting on the Lord Brother Brandon waited 5 years amen five years he prayed he cried he felt convicted it was only God drawing him closer when you feel all funny and feel like you did something wrong or took candy because I'm a baby or something it's God pulling you closer and closer and closer you feel wrong he wants you to feel that way so you can get closer and closer he's drawing you into prayer into because intercession with him that's how he draws you in so therefore an enemy say something wrong with you no it's God wooing you drawing you in yes amen he only wants you to contact him that's all he's doing see man now because you lost your commission you all watched up You Used To Know thus said the Lord in a moment and what was the will of God but this wise godsent Prophet knew the promise of God but also knew to wait for that promise a clearcut decision from God for his time nothing can be more clear-cut than a power Vision break before you you'll know friends how will I you know cuz it'll have to be according to St John 5:19 he'll you'll do nothing except he show you that's right they can run up and down now but unless God show they won't do nothing amen so we'll just wait on the Lord praise God for his time these Parables now watch and when the time come God gave it to Joshua who had stayed with him by the word for he could not trust others he could trust him so will it repeat now don't ever forget that now friends and so much for that because here tonight so therefore God could trust William Brandon with the word he gave him 30 years with that word and he held to it no matter what happened his wife because children died this happened that happened but he stayed with the word we've only had to do this since' 63 MH that right that's right staying with the word our only test was that he give us the word and 66 false Christ would arise in in the message sweet humble brothers who we know had fellowship with ate with slept with but they come up not ordained to be in The Bride come up with a false teaching now now watch this Satan see God doesn't have to because to beautify his word he keeps it plain and simple but Satan when the thing sounds good that ain't God cuz God just is playing with God see me now it's a simple promise soul Temple is hid but Satan makes it sound exciting amen uh this is going to happen over there Hallelujah glory to God he must do that to because because because of track certain people and they say well glory to God that's what he going to do see but God just keeps his word plain and simple so therefore those who are now right now staying with the word just staying right with that word see he then allows false Christ and all these things to come to sh shake you off of the word yeah other words heresies must come to pass to because those because which you are approved might be made manifest that right so therefore these things must be to see who is approved of God and then they are made manifest then there is faith in the word and that hour made manifest that right Jesus Christ was the because Abraham seed that right well Abraham seed Christ because he parted himself down Through the Ages because justification sanctification because the gifts and now the message that right well the message right now is the faith seed that's right that's all it is the faith seed right now you are the faith seed right now this is the message of the hour and therefore Christ will come right because right to that amen can we say Amen do we have understanding so what is going on right now is a time and a season and a purpose for what is going on now some of us because because we're moving here there this is going on there a time and also a purpose of God for that and everything that's happened to you right now is God's purpose he he is moving his people around and put them over here and so forth and so on he's doing it himself friend so therefore let us understand God and also understand what the Lord has ino for us and I myself believe cuz it's late already I myself believe that the the we right at the glory of God we're going to see it friends he said he going to show it to you you will do nothing except you see it by vision is here right here in his prophecy right here amen he said he shows her the word oh GL I mean he CHS his bride a little humble Widow somewhere by herself she's the bride ain't she amen that'll make those men man though for him the God to show some woman

and natural she herself was going to have a seed and God has done it he has given us the bride a seed a seven seal message amen amen slipped down himself and showed us his Word of Life amen just like Mary we said be it unto me according to that word as we see it happening in this SE and age and we reach that Mar age all the powers come when now even right now all these people are opening up their
