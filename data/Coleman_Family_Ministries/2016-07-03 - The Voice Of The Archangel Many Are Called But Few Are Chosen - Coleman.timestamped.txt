[0:05] Well, since you're standing, let us read
[0:07] the word.
[0:09] Amen.
[0:11] Just a few moments. Praise God to exhort
[0:14] you along the way. Everybody's getting
[0:16] ready to go. I don't know what I'm going
[0:18] to say. I didn't have the time to study.
[0:20] I was really working on my Tulsa message
[0:22] right up to uh quarter to 7. So then I
[0:26] switched over and just jot down a few
[0:28] notes here tonight. But I'd like to
[0:29] invite your attention to to this to to
[0:31] the Gospel of St. John the 14th chapter.
[0:35] Amen. And St. Matthew 22 11-14.
[0:43] Now, New York, this means something.
[0:45] Now, this is setting
[0:48] uh just a little simple thought, but
[0:50] it's kind of setting the tone for the
[0:53] season coming in.
[1:04] Ma St. St. Matthew 22
[1:08] and 1 Thessalonians 4 St. John 14.
[1:13] Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:16] Ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:21] Jesus was telling these Jews,
[1:25] "Let not your heart be troubled. You
[1:27] believe in Elohim,
[1:29] believe also in me
[1:31] because Elohim is veiled in me."
[1:34] Praise God.
[1:36] In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:39] If it were not so, I would have told
[1:41] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:45] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:47] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:49] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[1:53] also.
[1:54] Hallelujah.
[1:56] Amen.
[1:58] and 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[2:05] and uh 16th verse. For the Lord himself
[2:09] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[2:11] with the voice of the archangel, with
[2:13] the trump of God, and dead in Christ
[2:14] shall rise first. Then we then we which
[2:18] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[2:20] together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:22] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[2:26] ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort
[2:28] one another with these words. And also u
[2:31] I just want to read for little context.
[2:34] It's in Matthew 22. Amen. And uh well
[2:39] maybe we'll just uh pray over the what
[2:42] I'm going to read. Amen. And then I'll
[2:43] let you see it. Heavenly Father,
[2:46] Lord, just talking to the church before
[2:49] we go to Tulsa and all what's going on.
[2:53] And we're looking forward to a mighty
[2:55] outpouring of the token to seal up the
[2:58] people that's not sealed. Amen. And to
[3:02] refill and heal the people and bless
[3:04] them and kind of put them in the in the
[3:07] season
[3:09] and Lord God and may it be broadcast out
[3:12] to those who don't have the token. Amen.
[3:15] But tonight,
[3:18] Father, I believe that those who don't
[3:20] have it can be sealed right here.
[3:22] [Applause]
[3:25] Amen. For brother Gabriel told me that
[3:28] the Lord did that for the people in his
[3:30] church who was who wasn't going to to
[3:33] Tulsa.
[3:34] I have some hair that's not going
[3:37] Lord tonight they can father receive a
[3:41] blessing.
[3:43] They can be sealed
[3:45] and heal or whatever.
[3:48] They don't have to wait. So, Father, may
[3:50] you anoint the word that is read and was
[3:53] read and will be read and will be
[3:56] spoken. Lord God, may you confirm it.
[4:00] Hallelujah.
[4:01] And pour out the Holy Spirit upon the
[4:04] people.
[4:05] We pray and ask and strengthen me and
[4:07] ask the blessing in Jesus' name. You may
[4:10] be seated.
[4:11] Amen.
[4:12] For context,
[4:14] the marriage feast. So, you can read it
[4:16] with me saying Matthew 22. So, let them
[4:19] want to keep you stand up too long. And
[4:21] Jesus answered and spake unto them again
[4:22] in parables and said, "The kingdom of
[4:25] heaven is like unto a certain king,
[4:26] which made a marriage for his son, and
[4:28] sent forth his servants to call them
[4:30] that are bidden to the wedding, and they
[4:32] would not come." And again, he sent
[4:34] forth other servants, saying, "Tell them
[4:36] what you are bidden. Behold, I have
[4:38] prepared my dinner, my oxen, and my
[4:40] fatlings are killed, and all things are
[4:42] ready. Come unto the marriage." But they
[4:45] made light of it and went their ways,
[4:48] one to his farm, another to his
[4:50] merchandise,
[4:52] and the remnant took his servants, and
[4:56] intreated them spitefully, and slew
[4:58] them. But when the king heard thereof,
[5:00] he was wroth, and he sent forth his
[5:03] armies, and destroyed those murderers,
[5:05] and burned up their city. Then saith he
[5:08] to the servants, The wedding is ready,
[5:10] but they which were bidden were not
[5:12] worthy. Go ye therefore into the
[5:14] highways, and as many as you shall find
[5:17] bit to the marriage. So those servants
[5:20] went out into the highways, and gathered
[5:22] together all as many as they found,
[5:26] both. Now notice, both bad and good. And
[5:30] the wedding was furnished with guests,
[5:32] bad and good. And now I want to strike
[5:35] the 11th through 14. And when the king
[5:38] came in to see the guests, he saw there
[5:41] was a man which had not on a wedding
[5:43] garment, and he saith unto him, friend,
[5:47] how canst thou hither camest thou hither
[5:50] not having a wedding garment? And he was
[5:53] speechless.
[5:55] And you begin to understand my
[5:57] preaching. I don't want you to be
[6:00] speechless before the voice.
[6:02] [Music]
[6:05] Amen.
[6:06] So my then said the king uh to the
[6:11] servants, bind him head and foot and
[6:14] take him away and cast him into out of
[6:16] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[6:18] nashing of teeth for many are called but
[6:20] few are chosen. Oh may the Holy Spirit
[6:26] take the words that was read
[6:30] and stick them into your soul.
[6:34] May it stir you up.
[6:37] Many are called, but few are chosen
[6:42] and many have the wrong attitude after
[6:45] they were called. They're busy. They got
[6:48] to do this. They got to go to their farm
[6:50] and they got to get married and all kind
[6:52] of excuses.
[6:55] And no doubt when you come to the
[6:57] message and read the Bible, you say,
[6:58] "Well, how could those people do
[7:00] something like that?" When you heard
[7:01] Malachi 4's message, but it's been about
[7:04] 20 years now. I see them doing all kind
[7:06] of things now.
[7:07] Amen. But when they were called, they
[7:09] were on fire. But where are they at now?
[7:14] Where are they at now?
[7:16] They falling right back into the word
[7:19] like these was there.
[7:21] Oh my. A little thought. The voice of
[7:25] the archangel.
[7:27] Little subject. Many are called but few
[7:30] are chosen
[7:32] and inspiration positionally placed in
[7:35] time.
[7:37] Amen.
[7:38] Amen.
[7:38] And now pray. We just come through the
[7:41] series of the token.
[7:43] And now we can say uh President Reagan,
[7:46] do you have the token?
[7:49] We can say to all the dignitaries in the
[7:51] message that knew the prophet, do you
[7:54] have the token?
[7:56] We can say to all the mighty apostles
[7:58] and evangelists that's been roaring
[8:01] across the world, do you have the token?
[8:06] Amen.
[8:08] My do you have the token? That's the
[8:11] only thing that will matter. When I see
[8:14] the blood, I'll pass over.
[8:17] Hallelujah.
[8:19] Glory.
[8:22] So the Holy Spirit sent our brother. You
[8:24] may be seated. Owen Palm here. Praise
[8:27] God. To vindicate back to you, New York,
[8:30] what's been taking place all these years
[8:32] since 1974
[8:35] and 75 and on the field and all the talk
[8:39] that was going on by what was going on
[8:42] in New York. And now you know it's
[8:45] vindicated.
[8:47] Amen.
[8:51] And now you ain't got no more questions.
[8:56] Uh hallelujah.
[8:58] Glory.
[9:00] Praise God. Amen.
[9:04] Then if you know it's vindicated, then
[9:06] you can have what has been spoken.

[9:41] and to lean to and the tower.

[10:22] in the prophet and spoke through the
[10:24] prophet and put it on tape in book form.
[10:27] That was a spirit of truth and a storm
[10:30] came up and led us through the storm all
[10:33] the way to 1985.
[10:35] And now the spirit of truth has led us
[10:39] this far. But the hour has come for
[10:42] wonderful, glorious baptism of the Holy
[10:45] Ghost.

[10:53] mountain? You better believe it.

[11:57] season, in the time
[11:59] and the hours in the hour. Praise God.

[12:26] to the guy. You took a revelation since
[12:29] 1964.
[12:31] Jacob, Grace, Joseph, perfection. Then
[12:33] you added to it in 1974 the seven
[12:36] thunders or the seven voices of the
[12:38] seven church changes.
[12:40] And then you try to hold the people with
[12:42] that revelation. Praise God. Which was
[12:44] the spirit of truth.
[12:46] Praise God. Which was bearing witness of
[12:49] what the prophet said.
[12:51] Amen. The prophet said the shout is a
[12:53] message and and the shout gathers a
[12:55] bride together and the seven thunders
[12:57] gathers a bride together. Therefore, the
[12:59] prophet already preached the seven
[13:01] thunders.
[13:06] Amen.
