[4:59] be great and you shall be the children
[5:01] of the highest for now here's the reason
[5:04] why I see this is why you're doing these
[5:05] things for he is carrying unto the

[5:44] God gets right back to you same mission
[5:47] see so you can imagine if you're given
[5:50] our love has just come right back to you
[5:52] see I'm right from him praise the Lord
[5:56] your fusion is 432 and be occurring one
[6:00] to another tender-hearted forgiving one
[6:02] another even as God for Christ's sake
[6:05] hath forgiven you they lawyer blessing
[6:08] the reading of his word
[6:10] like a title this morning's message
[6:12] forgiving for giving a little title I
[6:18] wanting to preach finish out a little
[6:20] thought a hand about 22 weeks now on the
[6:23] love of God started about two weeks ago
[6:25] and want it and i believe about about
[6:28] two years ago the lawyer given me a
[6:30] message be there for perfect explain
[6:33] about how we should be because conform
[6:35] to God's will and so now I believe then
[6:38] I wanting to preach about the Fellowship
[6:40] of his sufferings to identify ourselves
[6:44] with him
[6:45] I'd like to explain the words from the
[6:48] dictionary what a 4give means so we're
[6:51] going to have a little teaching this
[6:52] morning while believe that God would
[6:54] have us to understand and to know these
[6:56] things when you have a vision of what
[6:59] God is doing you have wisdom you have
[7:02] understanding and you have knowledge so
[7:05] when you know God you understand then
[7:08] you grow up you see you said well this
[7:10] is what the Lord wants you see and you
[7:12] do it you do it with loving service now
[7:15] now forgive to give up resentment
[7:19] against our the desire to punish
[7:23] stop being angry with pardon to give up
[7:28] all claim to punish our exact penalty
[7:33] for an offense
[7:35] over look
[7:37] this is going to get us this morning I
[7:39] can see that praise the Lord
[7:42] to cancel or remit a debt to show
[7:48] forgiveness to be inclined to forgive so
[7:52] I read the word are there to be inclined
[7:54] to forgive
[7:56] then that's what struck me for this
[7:58] morning's title see because a forgiving
[8:01] means that it means inclined to forgive
[8:06] so therefore the message would be this
[8:08] morning we can because forgive somebody
[8:11] from one thing but maybe you'd want to
[8:13] give him for the next thing but the
[8:15] message this morning is being inclined
[8:18] to forgive for everything all the time
[8:21] as you go forth in his love amen with
[8:26] his nature in you see so therefore being
[8:29] crying always no matter what happens to
[8:33] you any time of the night of the day my
[8:37] god forgive be inclined to forgive now
[8:42] we know that there was only one person
[8:43] that had that nature in him and that was
[8:45] Jesus Christ to forgive he also had the
[8:49] faculty to forget also amen and so we
[8:56] don't have that see we struggled to
[8:58] forgive
[8:59] see because always that maybe two weeks
[9:03] later you know at first I mean because I
[9:05] gave him but what did it do that they
[9:08] shouldn't have done it I can't I can't I
[9:11] can't see why they did it
[9:13] well he didn't ask you to see why they
[9:16] couldn't because why they did it he
[9:18] asked you to forget so if you have a
[9:20] nature in you to forgive which is God's
[9:23] nature you will forgive a man see praise
[9:28] the Lord I see smiling faces around
[9:32] so we know that only one person had that
[9:35] quality and that one person see came and
[9:40] put that nature in us in seed for his
[9:44] very own nature
[9:46] now Ephesians 4 32 says forgiving one
[9:50] another
[9:51] being client too because because we give
[9:53] always see now now here's the punch line
[9:56] even as God for Christ's sake
[10:01] see hath forgiven you na ah praise the
[10:05] Lord other words God in Christ coming
[10:08] down didn't have to do it hey man did
[10:12] not have to do it we were in sin and
[10:16] iniquity
[10:17] see but for Christ's sake because of
[10:21] Jesus Christ died for our sins he
[10:23] forgave us he has forgiven us and we
[10:27] have forgiveness of sins continually if
[10:29] we will be faithful and because confess
[10:32] our sins day by day every day see now
[10:35] trying to get to you now if Christ God
[10:38] has forgiven our sins and we have his
[10:41] nature in us and we must go forth
[10:44] forgiven Amy
[10:46] praise the Lord see now he had in him
[10:50] kindness and love and forgiveness that
[10:53] was God see and Jesus Christ says true
[10:58] in the Gospels he never forces you to do
[11:01] anything see he says if thou wilt if you
[11:06] can receive it say if you can do it he
[11:10] walks along sweetly and humbly never be
[11:13] carried up his voice and said well if
[11:16] you can receive it do the sums up see so
[11:19] Peter don't when you want it to get a
[11:21] higher revelation of how to be like God
[11:23] well if thou wilt this is what you do
[11:26] love your enemies bless those that
[11:30] because curse you and this is only to
[11:32] those that you don't have to do this
[11:33] this is to those who want to go up on a
[11:36] higher plane
[11:38] payment see go up higher where the
[11:41] eagles law and you can look out and see
[11:44] the whole plan of God well I was a
[11:47] Pentecostal baby down there fighting
[11:49] fussing down near lord thank you for
[11:51] taking me up on high and now I see it I
[11:55] understand let me be conform to your
[11:59] will
[12:00] amen praise the Lord see now are you see
[12:04] if you will be perfect other words be
[12:06] there for perfect that means to be
[12:09] complete and being conformed to God's
[12:12] laws see it means to be a mature
[12:16] complete full growth as men all the Lord
[12:21] expects us to do is to mature to his
[12:24] word that's why he sent the word to his
[12:26] prophet now without me you cannot do
[12:30] this
[12:31] so you settle down right now I thought I
[12:33] can't do that I know you can he does it
[12:38] through you as you let him come in he is
[12:41] the word Amen see and and as he would
[12:45] bring us to this final spot which we all
[12:48] know we have reached we have reached a
[12:50] plateau we've been climbing up their
[12:53] mountain by faith we get up here we see
[12:56] all the glories of God for the gods
[12:59] profit shoulders by the word it's there
[13:02] we can see the Millennial Kingdom over
[13:05] there amen it's right there where are we
[13:08] going to live over there
[13:10] some of you might even be right here in
[13:12] New York State you don't know
[13:15] later on see it may have you because
[13:17] your portion here but then when the the
[13:20] heavenly city comes down after then your
[13:22] DNA of course but in the 1000 years you
[13:25] own the way you're going to be here amen
[13:27] because just going to be the bride on
[13:29] there that's all that's always going to
[13:31] be at 144,000 and servants but the
[13:34] brides want it because the meek shall
[13:36] inherit this earth for 1,000 years you
[13:39] see then after that Satan's loose for
[13:41] short season and so forth God reigns
[13:43] down fine then comes down to New
[13:46] Jerusalem say a new heavens and new
[13:48] earth and all these things see but
[13:50] there's going to be a while you're going
[13:52] to be here on this earth praise the Lord
[13:54] so now see there are two kinds of
[13:58] forgiveness i
[14:00] think i just read i'll just take my time
[14:02] this one see we want to get this we want
[14:06] to know or God's will he's going to sit
[14:09] down the power now but we want to see
[14:11] what kind of people are going to have
[14:13] this power in them
[14:16] see them at the 26-28 right now in
[14:18] scripture for this is my blood of the
[14:21] New Testament which is shed for many for
[14:23] the remission of sins
[14:26] now this word are remission is found
[14:30] here acts 1043 Hebrews 9 22 what really
[14:36] is a Greek word meaning of forgiveness
[14:39] but here's called remission see now it
[14:43] means to to send off send away like that
[14:48] scapegoat back in Israel 1-disc able
[14:51] because he went away off into the
[14:52] wilderness SC and throughout all the
[14:55] scripture it is the fundamental meaning
[14:58] of forgiveness see it is to take the sin
[15:02] from the center see now there's two
[15:06] kinds this human forgiveness see human
[15:10] forgiveness means to forgive the penalty
[15:13] that's what we do see now in the old
[15:16] testament and the new way which is a
[15:17] type and fulfillment the divine
[15:21] forgiveness follows the execution of the
[15:25] penalty now that would be in leviticus
[15:28] you write it down 5 10 and Leviticus 435
[15:32] just copied one of them to show you what
[15:35] I mean
[15:37] I'll read from Leviticus lead and one
[15:39] they both saying the same thing
[15:42] I'll read from Leviticus
[15:45] 435
[15:48] 435 and he shall take away all the fat
[15:52] thereof in the fat of the lamb is taken
[15:53] away from the sacrifice of the peace
[15:55] offering and the priest shall burn them
[15:57] upon the altar according to the orphans
[15:59] made by fire to the Lord and the priest
[16:01] shall make an atonement for his sin that
[16:03] he hath committed and it shall be
[16:05] forgiven him see so the sin is done and
[16:09] then divine forgiveness he forgives that
[16:13] penalty then if you have the nature of
[16:17] God human forgiveness forgives the same
[16:21] penalty on his brother you follow me now
[16:24] other words the man has committed a sin
[16:27] he goes to the Lord is a blood atonement
[16:30] there for his sin disbeliever so then
[16:33] the Lord forgives him now you know he
[16:36] did that
[16:37] so if you have the nature of God and if
[16:40] you are inclined to be forgiving you
[16:43] will forgive it also you will send it
[16:46] far away from him
[16:48] hey man see me and you see him as your
[16:51] brother he may he make because many
[16:54] moral mistakes and so forth had many
[16:56] faults bear ye one another's burdens and
[16:59] so doing you fulfill the law of christ
[17:01] that right she let me know so now human
[17:06] forgiveness rest upon and results from
[17:09] divine forgiveness God did it I do it
[17:13] see he said why because to be caring for
[17:16] he was kind to the evil and to the good
[17:19] that right see now st. Matthew 6 that
[17:23] prayer over there the Lord's Prayer that
[17:26] was on legal ground saying we're laying
[17:30] in this ground Rick or right now so you
[17:32] understand and embody I explained to you
[17:34] could I was legal in this sense I'll
[17:38] reach 6 12 i think i have here 612 i
[17:41] read 11 give us this day our daily bread
[17:44] and forgive our debts as we
[17:48] forgive our debtors
[17:50] so this is legal see because this
[17:54] forgiveness was on a condition that if
[17:58] we forgave you then God could because we
[18:01] give us but we he says right here safe
[18:04] or forgive out this as we forgive our
[18:07] debtors
[18:08] there was that condition we had to
[18:11] forgive the other man and then God
[18:12] didn't didn't expect God to forgive me
[18:14] we didn't forgive him God would never
[18:16] because to give us is legal hey man but
[18:20] now for Christ's sake hey man see
[18:23] difference now so Paul says for Christ's
[18:26] sake forgive me one other because he
[18:28] forgave yourself what you asking
[18:31] is that reference see all the way you
[18:34] didn't even know because asked to forget
[18:36] other man says God came and found you
[18:39] and singing and forgave your saves
[18:43] himself
[18:44] amen it seemed and for that reason for
[18:48] that course forgive your brother
[18:51] no matter how vile it is no matter what
[18:55] it is because nobody could do anything
[18:57] worse than what they did to Jesus Christ
[19:00] said right and he forgave that was in
[19:03] his nature so we are supposed to have
[19:05] his nature in us so therefore we have to
[19:08] because we give also that right see now
[19:11] so now Ephesians 1 32 is under grace he
[19:15] is the grace of God that forgives our
[19:17] sins see so therefore it is done for
[19:21] Christ's sake and we are to exhort it to
[19:23] forgive
[19:25] continually daily over because you have
[19:27] the different scriptures which you all
[19:29] know the different ones divine
[19:31] forgiveness is in Leviticus in Psalms
[19:33] even this morning Matthew 6 14 fusions
[19:36] 17 so forth but human of forgiveness
[19:38] because enjoying to divine is Ephesians
[19:41] 4 32 Colossians 3 13 and different ones
[19:45] st. Matthew 18 which all are you
[19:48] unfamiliar with colleges read it then
[19:51] came 18 21 then came Peter to him and
[19:54] said Lord how oft shall my brother sin
[19:56] against me and I forgive him seven times
[19:59] seven because till seven times jesus
[20:01] said to him I say not unto thee until
[20:03] seven times but until seventy times
[20:06] seven continually you see and so now our
[20:11] fences must come
[20:13] see we're going to line it up together
[20:15] so they won't be off on one side see now
[20:18] offenses will come and you have to
[20:20] forgive because your heavenly Father
[20:22] does the same thing but I just thought
[20:25] because read the st. Luke 17 if you want
[20:27] to take it down then said he unto the
[20:30] disciples it is impossible that offenses
[20:33] will come it they've got to come see
[20:37] but woe unto him through whom they come
[20:40] now I don't want to be standing in the
[20:43] shoes of those who continually because
[20:46] offend you though you are to forgive
[20:48] them but I don't wanna be in their shoes
[20:51] for he says he it are better for him
[20:54] that a millstone were hanged about his
[20:56] neck and cast into the sea then that he
[21:00] should offend one of these little ones
[21:02] take heed to yourselves if thy brother
[21:04] trespass against thee rebuke him and if
[21:07] he repents forgive him now let's line it
[21:10] up sing it so you otherwise we just go
[21:12] off saying I forgive your brother I
[21:14] forgive you president that means that
[21:16] the brother can do anything no it
[21:17] doesn't mean that no see because um
[21:19] Peter with the fullness of God was
[21:22] because of addison you lating head right
[21:25] down Antioch yes sir safe and trying to
[21:29] make them into Jews and so forth see and
[21:31] when he himself was not living as a Jew
[21:33] keeping the law so therefore how could
[21:35] he make those were because a Christians
[21:37] there because keep the law when he was
[21:38] keeping himself
[21:39] hey man hey hey so he was down here
[21:42] because of simulating so now Paul caught
[21:45] him with an offense so Paul abonnez went
[21:49] up and rebuked him to his face that
[21:51] right see big why for the doctrine see
[21:56] we don't bother nobody outside of the
[21:58] disp over here but if somebody is coming
[22:02] down from because Jerusalem into any are
[22:05] and teaching those brothers who was set
[22:08] free by Jesus Christ who were born
[22:10] sleeves the Christ and telling it
[22:12] because they had to be circumcised and
[22:14] showing them here in the law you have
[22:16] your circumcised brother or Paul and
[22:18] Barnabas the spare loss struck them and
[22:20] brother they rebuilt them yeah see so
[22:24] that's all we do here somebody come
[22:25] around here saying well there's no Holy
[22:27] Ghost on what we have to rebuke that
[22:29] that's that's the doctrine see holy
[22:32] amen praise the Lord it's beautiful holy
[22:38] so you're holding or for just can't
[22:40] let any old spirit come in old sex beard

[25:06] want to possess it I'm going to chat
[25:09] with the world I'm going to rip ink for
[25:12] God has shown me that there's three
[25:15] stages by revelation therefore I have
[25:18] possessed that by revelation you don't
[25:21] have it wasn't revealed to you the man
[25:24] fact that you go against the message
[25:26] prove it was not revealed to you now I'm
[25:28] gonna hold forth because it was revealed
[25:30] to me then I go from a revelation to
[25:33] revelation from faith to faith I'm
[25:35] possessing the land God has put a seat
[25:38] in the third stage in the heart and the
[25:41] confirmation is coming with the love of
[25:43] God the dove is coming down the
[25:45] consummation and there which what is in
[25:48] me shall be we become afflicted out one
[25:51] I believe that in it that is he spoke
[25:54] and by revelation arm hole in the fourth
[25:57] I'm hold that ground hey I can't help
[26:00] brother if you believe that we one time

[26:11] your brother you got any cost come and
[26:14] see me like Paul did with the Peter what
[26:17] song they were wit to face the face so
[26:20] if anything enough if it's my little me
[26:22] nothing face to face go see your brother
[26:26] the property go in the back room sit
[26:28] down and slug it out back there and come
[26:30] out in love if a person can come in and
[26:33] face you with whatever he's talking
[26:35] about it only nothing it's just talk I
[26:38] don't talk you see the midnight because
[26:40] it was thus to have the Lord in the
[26:42] person would see you so many run up and
[26:44] down with all kind of crazy reports
[26:46] that's all right they immature sorry but
[26:50] if God ever SAT him down and reveal its
[26:53] will to them they would be because I
[26:54] with you sure same spirit amen praise
[26:58] the Lord well so now we see what the
[27:02] doctrine see and so we see that who are
[27:05] we to follow man's person no no man can
[27:10] stand up and take the seven churches
[27:11] book and there's a biome they could say
[27:13] anything for the Prophet came with a
[27:15] message to say all kind of things if you
[27:18] take one person you can say make it say
[27:19] anything you could take one point that
[27:22] said there's no holy ghost at all
[27:23] another force it because there is a Holy
[27:25] Ghost please a variant on line five must
[27:29] you must not dislocate the scripture
[27:32] that right because they replace the
[27:34] scripture so forth we can move it around
[27:35] anywhere pretty haven't just say it as
[27:38] it is you see so now because he fishes
[27:41] 551 you with me
[27:44] praise the Lord if he's just 50 be there
[27:48] for followers of god as their children
[27:51] walking love as Christ has also loved us
[27:53] have forgiven and have given himself for
[27:57] us as an offering and a sacrifice to God
[27:59] with a for sweet-smelling Savior so
[28:02] therefore we are to follow a man no part
[28:07] of the Lord
[28:08] because God knew that after his person
[28:11] the word in the Prophet Malachi 4 would
[28:14] come with the thoughts of God see give
[28:18] him out put him on tape in book form he
[28:20] knew that Antichrist see will come right
[28:23] out to 65 and especially in 68 and soul
[28:28] down that doctrine in 68 elders wouldn't
[28:30] because run after it 68 c and so let's
[28:34] see it and all of spirits was settled
[28:35] down and then they were waiting for the
[28:38] next year to see what's going to happen
[28:40] sees his song see so he knew that so
[28:43] therefore he said he says follow God see
[28:46] follow God for can Antichrist would come
[28:49] on all kind of crazy doctrines but now
[28:51] on the Isaiah 6 he says arise and
[28:55] sharing for that light has come now

[29:55] sure praise Allah for his glory shall be
[29:59] seen upon you and after you go through
[30:02] darkness and gross doctor to put all the
[30:05] people then God will quicken the other
[30:07] part the glory of God that you have
[30:10] resurrected up to a new life shall be
[30:13] seen upon you shall be reflected out of

[30:29] perfect now um also
[30:32] followers followers mean to be imitators
[30:35] mimic the gate speech accent manner of
[30:39] life of another it means here to imitate
[30:42] God as children do their parents as your
[30:46] sons and daughters try to imitate you
[30:48] see that's what Paul say hey we're
[30:50] children so that as a child to God the
[30:53] Father watch him see what he does amen
[30:56] seeing natural Spencer now if your
[30:59] father love in the home your children
[31:01] will see the kind of life you live in as
[31:03] a Christian they will imitate you what
[31:07] they see see and we saw God's nature
[31:11] through his prophet because so are we
[31:15] read about it but we saw it amen so now
[31:18] we buy and then he wouldn't a to do if
[31:21] he don't send a sprint to do it with so
[31:24] he sent the word to seven seals and
[31:26] write plus the feet on a seven course
[31:28] meal to give us strength to follow his
[31:31] ways his nature his acts follow him
[31:34] completely see and we can only do this
[31:36] by his spirit which must be in us in the
[31:40] third stage are you following me though
[31:42] see the spirit of gods in you in seed
[31:44] form C and out of that seed is transfer
[31:48] to see yourself is transforming power C

[31:53] end of the road meets the the
[31:55] transforming power which is is to come
[31:57] down to quicken you and make you alive
[31:59] for the resurrection it meets it it does
[32:02] something sweet amen praise the Lord see
[32:06] now now also have another scripture here
[32:09] just take my time I have it because
[32:11] about 20 minutes yet hey man acts I'm
[32:15] built up to a point here so stay with me
[32:18] please just laying groundwork to drive
[32:22] home a thought this one see acts 14 17
[32:26] Paul here and and Paul here and saw the
[32:30] brother here I can't think was named
[32:32] here was up here at the list Rhea here
[32:35] and they was and it's just lame man was
[32:38] he'll appear and if people saw it they
[32:40] thought that Paul was a Mercurius and a
[32:43] Barnabas was because Jupiter and they
[32:46] got so excited that they wanted to make
[32:48] him gods Paul and Barnabas rip off the
[32:51] clothes ran among the people and said
[32:54] this here he said insane sirs why this
[32:58] is acts 14 15 why do you do these things
[33:00] we also are men of light passion with
[33:03] you and preaching to you that you should
[33:05] turn from these vanities on to the
[33:08] Living God which made heaven and earth
[33:10] and the sea in all things that are
[33:12] therein who could not watch who in times
[33:15] past suffered all nations to walk in
[33:18] their own ways
[33:19] nevertheless he left not himself without
[33:23] witness is the witness now in that he
[33:27] did good Haman and gave us rain from the
[33:32] heaven and fruitful seasons killing our
[33:35] hearts with food and gladness and a
[33:37] heavenly father left his son shine on
[33:40] the evil and the good pours his rain on
[33:43] the just and also on the unjust
[33:45] therefore is not rightful for us to want
[33:48] to shut up something from somebody who's
[33:49] doing evil
[33:51] so if we are being conformed to the will
[33:53] of God see we do good as a witness of
[33:56] God no matter how much sinners out here
[33:58] God has the witan in that he has a good
[34:00] nature that's his nature and therefore
[34:03] we are too because imitate God and if we
[34:06] just go out with long-suffering
[34:07] gentleness and kindness and so forth out
[34:11] to this unbelieving world you farming
[34:13] our friends that's the fruit of the
[34:15] Spirit see a faint of it or because love
[34:18] joy and pieces for you inside see out to
[34:22] man because you give our long-suffering
[34:24] gentleness and goodness to God Nick
[34:27] pneus and faith and all humility to God
[34:30] amen sing but that this is a way we
[34:33] supposed to move and so therefore that
[34:36] was a witness to be kind to one another
[34:39] because to forgive one another see it is
[34:42] the law of christ see now arm this law
[34:46] is spontaneous and you have to force it
[34:49] see and you just are spontaneous with
[34:52] him well god bless your brother now like
[34:55] I said now you stay with the word of
[34:56] course don't ever forget that you just
[34:59] stay with that word see but naturally
[35:01] with love you go out to your brother and
[35:03] doing good deeds and kind and so forth
[35:05] because you're moving on see you see
[35:07] Christ law is law see Moses law demand
[35:11] it love it demanded love see what Christ
[35:16] law is love because written in the heart
[35:18] by the Holy Spirit and just come down to
[35:20] the heart the spontaneous see so now on
[35:24] this law death in our hearts makes us in
[35:27] kind to forgive our brothers that right
[35:30] praise the Lord now we got to the point
[35:34] I just want to drive this home for a
[35:36] while now on the tape of the countdown
[35:40] we wanted to play it to you but we got
[35:43] mixed up with the wrong tape the one
[35:45] from the Shreveport there are some
[35:47] things on there which I believe because
[35:49] a lot want you to know about and so I
[35:51] thought the car bring it back to you
[35:52] what a brother branham had said now we
[35:55] know that all natural things or types of
[35:58] the spiritual there right natural
[36:01] reflects the spiritual
[36:03] now water justification that's because
[36:07] courtship see courtship is God calling
[36:10] you he's calling you justify see
[36:13] courtship blood is agreements that's the
[36:16] doctrine like because you get it tonight
[36:17] the bark when that suffer got it because
[36:19] got into the bark to go out the doctrine
[36:21] seeing so forth see that's his
[36:24] agreements see and the next thing is
[36:26] your spirit that's the marriage d-union
[36:29] there's got to be a spirit because to be
[36:31] a marriage got to be because unionized
[36:33] you see by his spirit now because in his
[36:36] courtship to us God calls us he's
[36:39] calling many of us since 63 to be his
[36:42] bride see but we are to surrender to the
[36:46] doctrine and be baptized in his name and
[36:49] so forth seen and then there's to be a
[36:51] union between him and you by his Spirit
[36:54] and nobody seasons actually happened but
[36:57] if something that is in you you know
[36:59] that your wed to him you want to do his
[37:02] will your will is finish would see you
[37:06] become one with the bridegroom and now
[37:10] many people all mix up now what is going
[37:12] on right now we are now in the age of
[37:15] adoption for God's prophet told us that
[37:18] the Mosaic law there was a dispensation
[37:21] of that disposition of John of christ
[37:23] church organization then the outpouring
[37:27] of the Holy Spirit for in 1906 but when
[37:30] God's practic came in 46 he came with to
[37:33] open up the age of adoption see those
[37:37] who were born Sutton and also daughters
[37:40] of God the Prophet came with the Holy
[37:42] Spirit tutor with a message to pour it
[37:45] into the church in three poles see and
[37:48] to bring the Pentecostal church up to
[37:50] adoption for that's the place that God
[37:53] has got to have for us to me because a
[37:56] Coca life out there you see for
[37:58] therefore we must come to that place and
[38:01] that's what we're in now God has been
[38:04] adopted us and he's ready because one to
[38:08] adopt us so what does he do in the
[38:11] adoption he finds one here
[38:15] he looks all around he preaches his
[38:18] words to 19 years k hard for anybody
[38:21] see then he comes with it because his
[38:23] profit method and somebody and Holly you
[38:27] can find anybody who sell out all the
[38:29] way with love for everything of prompted
[38:32] saying you following our friends to be
[38:35] adopted it because it comes with
[38:37] sanctification holiness is in this
[38:40] adoption see the women are told they
[38:42] have a certain covenant they are do
[38:44] certain things in dressing matter and so
[38:46] forth and admit the same thing see then
[38:49] the Holy Spirit washes the whole thing
[38:50] this is right now is the age of adoption
[38:53] we're getting ready to go into the
[38:54] disposition of the fools of town where
[38:57] he gathered in the reservation all
[38:58] things in one himself but right now he's
[39:01] trying to adopt his church to place them
[39:04] positionally in the land where they
[39:06] belong you finally now other words back
[39:10] there because in joshua tear they fought
[39:13] they fought to get a certain spot but
[39:16] over end i think it was january 21 43
[39:19] and 45 they then had fought the enemies
[39:23] God saw that they was ready to possess
[39:25] the land and so therefore he gave them
[39:27] their portion Ephraim had his own land
[39:30] see God gave each tribe rest from all of
[39:35] the enemies
[39:36] Ephesians 6 13 said that with the shield
[39:40] of faith we shall quench all of the
[39:43] fiery darts of the enemy all of them
[39:45] every single last darkest Satan can hurl
[39:49] at you you will quench it amen therefore
[39:52] is a tight see if you'd also Joshua
[39:55] therefore they receive their rest from
[39:58] all of the enemy now watch God delivered
[40:03] every enemy into their hands unto them
[40:07] so what would that mean over here well a
[40:10] God's prophet is our example one more
[40:12] than 61 one afternoon he's going up to
[40:15] Chicago

[44:32] well back to of the Holy Ghost is every
[44:35] if anything I would keep on saying it
[44:37] cuz was skipping the Bible but they wait
[44:40] to the very hour when God Himself is
[44:43] about to come in judgment and then they
[44:45] begin said there's no Holy Ghost how can
[44:47] they what Spirit says that it drives me
[44:50] crazy thing how do you even say that
[44:51] would you say it what can you do see you
[44:54] have to go on anyway amen see so now um
[44:57] he puts his whole nature it could
[45:00] finally be itself and reveal the true
[45:03] nature of God when it gets all of the
[45:05] word it has to have all the words but
[45:06] all the words God's nature amen see and
[45:09] now we are into all the word now to
[45:12] express God's nature but what's he doing
[45:15] his thoughts is coming into our heart a
[45:19] bed of love see thoughts comes in when

[45:39] why he tells you these things see it's
[45:40] the thought of God coming in see and if

[45:44] the flesh must die in order to express
[45:47] God's will see now it must be made it to
[45:51] the head the love see and when the seven
[45:55] virtues is made it to number eight love
[45:58] then it's a new creation of course hey
[46:01] man scribes see because what's his name
[46:04] Samson had one faith in God and God put
[46:08] because he brought seven and seven locks
[46:10] of hair and when I got into seven locks
[46:12] of here because because including the
[46:14] love see then it had the same strength
[46:17] back amen and when this little bride
[46:19] with that seed of faith gets in those
[46:22] seven virtues because including love
[46:23] will have the same strength at the head
[46:25] on their Pentecost amen the secret of
[46:28] the power God what the seven locks will

[46:53] go for it well it just so happens that
[46:55] they have a Paula number 10 now come

[47:03] God had the science had to have seven
[47:06] and eight that's the word Christ see and
[47:08] then he got to have nine and ten mr.
[47:10] brand senia now because she had a test
[47:13] she'd been tested all around safe she
[47:15] stayed with that word doc has moved in
[47:17] growth on become thicker to cover all
[47:19] the people out here but she stayed with
[47:21] that word she was resurrected up the
[47:23] wheat she come out sitting there now and
[47:25] she's ripening right on down laying the
[47:28] presence of the Sun waiting to the right
[47:31] when the wheat is right then we don't
[47:34] know his purpose it's got to be right
[47:36] first when Peter was right on the tenth
[47:39] day up there because it helped a room
[47:41] then the Holy Spirit come down to do
[47:44] what to take a ripe and seed see to take
[47:48] that seat and preach the gospel to
[47:50] nourish and make it grow throughout the
[47:54] world what is a different purpose this
[47:56] time it come down this time to mature to
[47:58] see well since--since that this is now
[48:01] the end time God has something in store
[48:03] hitting them seven thunders that nobody
[48:06] knows anything about except one man
[48:08] because brother brand he knew what they
[48:10] were let's see what we are writing tutor
[48:12] and what they are God will redeem it to
[48:14] his bride she'll know what they are in
[48:16] that thing now we see how does it go
[48:18] forth because Apollo 10 now much to my
[48:22] amazement I happen to look into the time
[48:24] the other day
[48:25] so here and they had you know because
[48:28] all of the d3 flights there I have a
[48:31] look there too apollon I'm the testing
[48:34] mission Apollo 10 d forgiving mission
[48:37] and that's why I appreciate this message
[48:40] this morning I didn't know how to bring
[48:42] this but when I read this this was
[48:44] sunday last Sunday there it said that
[48:46] this number 10 is the forgiving mission
[48:49] are you following me friends other words
[48:52] when this tested the phenomena and bride
[48:55] is ready fine ready to go up it goes out
[48:58] forgiving
[49:00] let us think in praise the Lord now this
[49:03] is what dr. Lowe says the head man he
[49:07] says
[49:09] for these and a number of other reasons
[49:11] directors of the program are anxious to
[49:13] have one more flight before an attempt
[49:16] declared of landing mr. Lowe calls this
[49:20] flight of politan the forgiving mission
[49:23] here's why because he says it will
[49:25] forgive them for any miscalculations
[49:28] now we are not perfect in ourselves I
[49:31] hope you get it friends grow up we are
[49:34] still the same people when that power
[49:37] comes it won't be you to him you still
[49:40] the same person but for Christ's sake
[49:43] God forgive your sins he made you
[49:46] brainless that right this method is hold
[49:49] us until that day we share p blameless
[49:51] well for his very sink when you go out
[49:55] with this power don't condemn don't
[49:57] judge when he has committed judge it to
[49:59] warn the Sun st. John 5 22 and first
[50:02] grade is 45 that right he does all the
[50:05] judge but we go forth in love meekness
[50:07] goodness for giving cuz for his sake he
[50:11] forgave our sins therefore for this
[50:14] appalling to go out here's man knowing
[50:18] that they are not perfect and knowing
[50:20] that they could take a chance in May and
[50:22] go to the moon but they were held God
[50:24] held them they had to have one more
[50:27] mission for it because in case because
[50:30] they found out that the moon is like
[50:32] because I bumpy up there and they can't
[50:34] get our good because some really called
[50:37] they could orbit because who know
[50:39] whether it'll be good because I go up or
[50:41] down see so therefore they're not sure
[50:43] whether they will have enough fuel ago
[50:45] so therefore they want to go on a small
[50:47] mission and see if they can bring back a
[50:49] half a tank of fuel say because they
[50:51] can't store too much you can't have
[50:53] because because too much throw it up on
[50:55] you no weights
[50:57] hey man for their Shore player for them
[51:01] they may have made mistakes
[51:02] are you finding friends we are a and
[51:07] have false but when it goes out when
[51:10] that real nation comes in here forgiving
[51:13] you when that fire strikes your body
[51:15] when the Living God says that you are my
[51:18] son this is my beloved son when that
[51:21] revelation pause until you leap for joy
[51:23] you'll say Lord God I'm unworthy when
[51:27] you come into his presence I that's him
[51:29] a man on doing you see farming our
[51:31] friends therefore if his nature's poured
[51:34] in there he forgave he was going then
[51:37] you go out on this mission the last one
[51:39] to the Gentiles with a forgiving mission
[51:42] oh you followed it in a racecar hope you
[51:45] get it we were right at the door for
[51:47] something French and only the Almighty
[51:49] God to take these this is not me now I
[51:51] just pick it up boy strip that this
[51:53] means doesn't so and just bring right to
[51:55] your vessel see that's for you here is
[51:57] for all of us together but now I'm not
[52:00] grape seed it's just the holy spit
[52:01] because revealing his will his prophet
[52:04] said that in the the because such
[52:07] because the adoption age that the sons
[52:10] of God would because reveal the mystery
[52:12] to the church now
[52:15] he goes for forgiving see now remember
[52:19] science is typing out the spiritual see
[52:22] so therefore dr. Lowe says here
[52:24] forgiving mission because he says it
[52:26] will forgive them for any
[52:27] miscalculations a power 10 will be a
[52:30] forgiving mission because it is limited
[52:32] or because duration short powerful
[52:35] ministry a few orbits or because of the
[52:38] moon that's always gonna be see but no
[52:40] landing because a presumably will bring
[52:43] home with his tanks half full leaving a
[52:45] wide margin for error now they'll go
[52:48] forth and they have the spiritual
[52:49] understand by revelation to have a
[52:51] another mission 24 because because
[52:54] forgive their mistakes what about the
[52:56] bride whenever i'll strikes you you
[52:57] don't want you to go out here because
[52:59] condemning somebody because judging
[53:01] somebody finally our friends now here's
[53:03] the real reason why
[53:05] if you are justified then you know that
[53:09] that you never did it in the first place
[53:12] that's a revelation which because come
[53:14] to your day by day

[58:53] laws have his mind in u.s to mine i was
[58:57] in christ the early church and Paul and
[58:59] William Brennan that's the mine that I
[59:02] met my another thing a thing a stirred
[59:03] me down to my toes and brother Brent
[59:06] went better pour rentrer said because it
[59:07] in his little black book he said I will
[59:10] love my enemies he's spoken by faith you

[59:16] it's a seat
[59:18] amen well number 10 that right it goes

[59:48] the knowledge of the truth on here when
[59:49] hours in makes you pure keep you pure
[59:52] amen see so we praise God for this here
[59:55] and even we know on Christ's name when
[59:58] you were on the cross there were seven
[1:00:00] sayings over there seven voices of God
[1:00:02] on the cross and the first one he said
[1:00:05] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:00:07] what they're doing that right so
[1:00:10] therefore has a bride go four Father
[1:00:11] forgive them for they know not what
[1:00:13] you're doing because they don't have
[1:00:14] knowledge didn't add add add add down
[1:00:17] the line see but this is because it
[1:00:20] image to a person so therefore the first
[1:00:23] thing you ask for is forgiveness in love
[1:00:25] amen praise the Lord so now we go forth
[1:00:29] because we're giving or judgement
[1:00:32] belongs to the Sun so I have some other
[1:00:34] things to say here but i just wanted
[1:00:35] because they close it off the scientist
[1:00:38] also this last one Apollo 11 they call
[1:00:41] it the real thing landing they call it
[1:00:44] landing the real thing so now I thought
[1:00:47] about that I said we're in some year
[1:00:50] this year 69 what's going to be and
[1:00:52] Apollo 11 that's what other credit are
[1:00:54] we were speaking about 11 that's not
[1:00:56] because any number where God could do
[1:00:58] anything there with and we're talking
[1:01:00] about it I thought about then last money
[1:01:01] seemed like the lowest a turnover to
[1:01:03] Genesis 11 and see what happens when
[1:01:05] they because of because build a city and
[1:01:07] also at our God says go to let's go down
[1:01:09] and confound them in Genesis 11 so I
[1:01:12] don't know what if because if this
[1:01:15] Apollo 11 has to be 11 amen by the one
[1:01:19] thing and just as 11 they had built a
[1:01:21] big towel and God just watched him let
[1:01:24] him get all fired up that we're all
[1:01:27] puffed up amen o praise His wonderful
[1:01:31] name
[1:01:32] amen please God let them think they
[1:01:35] could do everything amen Oh who's liking
[1:01:39] to us Oh Nicole amick back there I
[1:01:41] loll kind of men everything see
[1:01:44] you could too wise everything safe and
[1:01:46] then God watched him so let me go puffed
[1:01:49] up spirit and then he went down and
[1:01:51] confounded them see now he has many ways
[1:01:53] because to confirm people earthquake and
[1:01:56] things like that
[1:01:56] amen you just watch the word of god c so
[1:02:00] now then we're in our tremendous year
[1:02:04] amen it's praise the Lord and I thought
[1:02:07] about Apollo 9 and 10 days 19 all God's
[1:02:12] things C it's also perfect we all
[1:02:13] understand them but have to be safe now
[1:02:15] can I have five more minutes
[1:02:17] I'll have a few more comments here to
[1:02:20] time with this no finish now I don't
[1:02:22] know what's going to be our only tell
[1:02:24] you what the Lord tell me to tell you
[1:02:25] seem to be looking for anything say to
[1:02:28] be an expectation it would be like Oh
[1:02:31] Anna back there is expecting something
[1:02:33] see and then when that with that kind of
[1:02:35] expectation God don't find it nasty amen
[1:02:38] see now what I'm saying to you now this
[1:02:41] is a this way of life means of death so
[1:02:46] you could put in the right place now so
[1:02:47] you won't go out of here leaping up for
[1:02:49] joy in all you have to die with this
[1:02:52] here talking about hey it's not flesh
[1:02:54] works this is dead yes sir see now see
[1:02:57] it is given to some it is given I said
[1:03:00] given by him to see understand see and
[1:03:04] to follow literally in his footsteps
[1:03:06] amen and it's also given to some to
[1:03:10] these to bear witness of this connection
[1:03:13] now hey man can hear you man c is given
[1:03:18] the some to see understand the will of
[1:03:21] God they have been become matured and a
[1:03:23] prophecy and only a few will identify
[1:03:25] himself with that Oh
[1:03:27] going that far only now you see why I
[1:03:31] morning it now I'm preaching to this
[1:03:32] morning there's only going to be a few
[1:03:34] from what I'm preaching to you some more
[1:03:36] you think on it now and what God's
[1:03:37] prophets say what's in this Bible the
[1:03:39] identification with the way of the cross
[1:03:41] how many in the flesh can give st. Jesus
[1:03:45] Christ when he was baptized and also
[1:03:47] because was anointed he went forth with
[1:03:49] this standard because because for our
[1:03:51] life that's standing lesson because
[1:03:53] about three years or so that was a
[1:03:55] standard in that standard he died to his
[1:03:58] loved ones to normal means of life and
[1:04:01] all of these things see that we might
[1:04:04] have life he died daily so he died daily
[1:04:07] and his white had a diet daily see so
[1:04:09] here for because he the acoustic fiction
[1:04:13] it shall reveal the true nature of God
[1:04:17] see there now is when you're dying see
[1:04:20] so therefore we couldn't write up to a
[1:04:22] point now now the capstone must come in
[1:04:24] then the nature of God comes out and
[1:04:27] when it comes out is love because
[1:04:31] forgiveness see but then when they
[1:04:33] because because the assaults come in all
[1:04:35] we had a calm sea because I want to
[1:04:37] comment on the cross yet see but then
[1:04:39] Father forgive them and the true nature
[1:04:42] of the kingdom is revealed on the energy
[1:04:44] that's the way we're gonna be over there
[1:04:45] see meek and humble that's the nature of
[1:04:48] God now this will be against man's force
[1:04:50] see me now love is on the center force
[1:04:53] it is like on the outside see me now but
[1:04:57] love because shall overcome force
[1:04:59] because force is just for seasoning salt
[1:05:02] see now when this love comes in and is
[1:05:06] revealed to you it also shows for a
[1:05:08] corresponding love for others now this
[1:05:11] life of Christ was not for himself it
[1:05:13] was for others now we can move up
[1:05:17] because of the cross we can because
[1:05:19] identify thought with this word but they
[1:05:22] come to third stage where we must die
[1:05:25] for others
[1:05:26] that means that somebody doesn't to you
[1:05:29] with love and forgiveness you die who's
[1:05:33] it for him so death works in you for him
[1:05:36] he said what I see Christ in his brother
[1:05:39] here glory to come I see now I did
[1:05:41] everything to this man here and yet he
[1:05:43] just offered me love and also because
[1:05:45] because he forgave me see it now so that
[1:05:47] man sees the life of Christ he sees God
[1:05:50] walking on the earth therefore is death
[1:05:52] to you and life to him that's what Paul
[1:05:55] preached that right that's we brother
[1:05:58] branham stood up there full of pain and
[1:06:00] everything else and brother Billy for
[1:06:02] Tony because it by the fire out there
[1:06:03] and because somebody was he'll there and
[1:06:05] he said well dad won't you speak to
[1:06:07] worry it's just not for me it's for
[1:06:09] others that's the lonely walk friend
[1:06:11] that's what Jesus you see now I mean if
[1:06:15] now if you can receive this he calls you
[1:06:18] up on her if you can give up things down
[1:06:21] here can have five more minutes what
[1:06:23] praise the Lord the counter how far to
[1:06:26] go yet see come on go as far as I can a
[1:06:29] man see so this way will reveal God's
[1:06:33] true nature to the world as it was
[1:06:37] revealed in brother branham see it
[1:06:40] didn't they'll see God the pentecostal
[1:06:42] foolish virgins and so forth whoever
[1:06:44] they are will see Christ it's well
[1:06:46] that's what the Prophet bram speak up
[1:06:49] and already got I see it I see it I
[1:06:51] believe this to lately of course you
[1:06:53] know see well the witness goes out to be
[1:06:56] a conviction of what dis messages it'll
[1:07:00] be followed by the most glorious power
[1:07:02] guy that's exact on the cross to know
[1:07:05] him in the power of his resurrection and
[1:07:08] the Fellowship of his sufferings on that
[1:07:11] cross then you'll know and understand
[1:07:12] what it's all about but do you rejoice
[1:07:14] because the father the son is being
[1:07:16] glorified again on the earth Jesus

[1:07:21] much fruit and we entered into the fruit
[1:07:23] season The Love here is my father
[1:07:25] glorified that right so we want to
[1:07:27] glorify the father when you bear much
[1:07:29] fruit and you want to see it praise God

[1:11:07] work see now that if you will do it it's
[1:11:11] voluntary death to normal advantages in
[1:11:13] the flesh
[1:11:14] comforts loved ones material
[1:11:17] advancements because in large income
[1:11:19] different things because written any
[1:11:20] pleasures leisure see if we die to these
[1:11:23] things like Jesus Christ is now there's
[1:11:25] a lawyer you know a law of a spiritual
[1:11:27] harvest hey man now if we voluntarily
[1:11:31] and it's now don't go out and do these
[1:11:34] things see wait he brings a thing to you
[1:11:36] and then test you on it then do it then
[1:11:39] you know don't run out of here now and
[1:11:41] say well I'm gonna be a big I don't want
[1:11:43] no money at all no don't do that you

[1:11:50] and you found me an expo get wisdom with
[1:11:55] your knowledge amen amen praise the Lord
[1:11:59] see now if we die when he shows us the
[1:12:04] will see then we have a right to clean
[1:12:07] the fruits of the harvest it's a
[1:12:11] spiritual Harvin's cousin because but
[1:12:13] tonight's tape I will restore is the law
[1:12:15] of God he doesn't see all right then we
[1:12:18] don't count our losses as something that
[1:12:21] we have been because of
[1:12:23] deprived of thing but we we buy d
[1:12:28] because for the
[1:12:30] the glory of God because embrace these
[1:12:31] things and also in doing because
[1:12:34] voluntary death of these things we turn
[1:12:37] all of the trial so-called child into
[1:12:40] victories amen
[1:12:43] tragedies insults and so forth turn into
[1:12:47] a victory is good is even though it's
[1:12:49] good amen is turned into a victory see
[1:12:52] well because you look for it but it was
[1:12:55] suited for you that's why it sent it
[1:12:57] amen you know what you need yes so not
[1:13:00] what you want amen same it out and he
[1:13:03] said well lord I have a clear vision I'm
[1:13:05] being conformed to you will I have
[1:13:07] wisdom I have understanding and I have
[1:13:09] knowledge so let it be amen and how'd
[1:13:12] you go see so if we speak it's with
[1:13:15] because humility
[1:13:16] tendencies of Christ if we act is with
[1:13:20] loving service amen see and if if like
[1:13:24] like I had to because toward one another
[1:13:26] is hoping all things and believing all
[1:13:29] things knowing it down at the end of the
[1:13:31] line that Christ is going to forgive the
[1:13:34] foolish virgins they have defiled
[1:13:36] himself somewhere off for one word
[1:13:38] somewhere so don't get mad at them
[1:13:40] because if it had been revealed to them
[1:13:42] believe me brother they would be right
[1:13:44] alongside you just remember that every
[1:13:47] the filter is hippie out there if God
[1:13:50] ever reveal this glorious will to him he
[1:13:52] would be sitting right here with a
[1:13:55] haircut and everything sitting right in
[1:13:57] here clean that's right see but it
[1:13:59] hasn't been revealed to him if this
[1:14:01] person in the church has always doing
[1:14:03] the wrong things being one another's
[1:14:05] burdens all the false and so forth see
[1:14:07] me now if God ever revealed that person
[1:14:10] that they shouldn't do it and that they
[1:14:12] should be because because the lega
[1:14:14] because her formally as will they
[1:14:15] wouldn't do that but because they don't
[1:14:17] know his will they do that see what you
[1:14:20] do is your test amen now talking to the
[1:14:24] Ephesian Church
[1:14:27] Lord giving because it because you
[1:14:30] believe oh well right now friends
[1:14:33] enclosing the identification with the
[1:14:35] word has been going on a fight and when

[1:14:58] have a conviction inside faith that is
[1:15:01] going to be then that by overcoming it
