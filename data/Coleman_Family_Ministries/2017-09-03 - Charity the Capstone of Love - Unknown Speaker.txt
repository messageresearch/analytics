B to the reading of the scriptures I ain't wasting no time no more amen uh Zechariah 4 you you want to find a place uh for Isaiah 28:16 and then second Peter 1 Hallelujah thought I was in the wrong place thought maybe I went into the shoe on the wrong day amen next down here on 108th Street here praise the Lord Zechariah 4 and the angel that talked with me came again and and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what see is thou and I said I have look and behold a Candlestick of gold with a bowl uh upon the top of it and his seven lamps there thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel to talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts uh who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubu Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it and Isaiah 28:16 reads on this wise therefore thus sayth the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation of stone a tried Stone of precious stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believeth shall not make haste he that believeth in 1998 shall not be haste worrying about the pope riding in the year 2000 amen shall not make make host because brother Brian preached it last week God keeps all his appointments praise God and we are appointed to go out of here and brother for a Rapture and God will keep that upon o God bless you brother Brian for that message amen praise the Lord and second Peter 1 which is what you see in front of you on the board amen fourth verse These are the promises whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises you see on that board there by these and not by uh brother Coleman I have a mind battle and I was just wondering if I could make make it no by those promises over there that's how you're going to make it by uh uh that that you might uh that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature nothing else but to be partakers of the divine nature having escaped corruption that is in the world through lust just for that alone you should have been a shout here this morning to escape this whole thing out here amen besides this giving all diligence add to your Faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may God a blessing and reading of his word praise God you may be seated well amen brother Norman I'd like to take a title out of here charity the Capstone of love amen and uh my subject the Capstone of Love is Here to seal up the Pyramid of Our Lives there's the pyramid my inspiration is a manifestation of The Headstone of the co corner so praise God so now we have one aim only one aim here and that is to see the predestinated sealed up by the Holy Ghost itself which is right in the top by those rainbows that's all that's the only thing I'm here for amen we certainly appreciate brother Joey sing that song holy of holies amen that's where you want to go the song said in the outer Court you're Justified amen out there you're walking by the sun and the the the the rain and whatever else gloomy is a dark day son you feel good then you say well God bless you if the sun is shining amen it's a gloomy day and you're gloomy that's in the outer Court in the Holy place you come in there with the candlesticks and the altar incense there and so forth in the shoe bread and you're in the message and you feel good and you're Sanctified by the message well that's wonderful everybody's in the message today amen but in the holy of holies is what the Holy Ghost itself that's where you want to go that's where you should not let nothing stop you nothing I don't care how you feel or this happen or that happened nothing should stop you and the holy of holies is the Holy Ghost itself and the Holy Ghost itself is those rainbows you see at the top there right on top of leosia is the Holy Ghost itself that's why I put it up here so you understand it that there's the mighty Presence of Jehovah and we are supposed to be a prisoner of love in there right in there amen so then you you should be sitting here everybody should been praying when they walked in here and been a rumble in here brother Paul Griffin would hit that pulpit and it exploded if you were praying to be in air so your prayer is Lord help me so you can rise in me a Capstone of love amen so we thank God for that you may be seated so now uh rise in me a Capstone of love what a great thought amen and today I it is my purpose to prove that in mechanical form that this whole pyramid is in you I'm approving to you regardless of what you feel how many times you fell down it has nothing to do with it the pyramid is in you praise God so you may be seated I've always stepped out by faith and I'm here by faith I preach by faith I live by faith I walk by faith praise God by faith I overcome by faith I'm looking for a city that has a building who and a foundation whose maker is God it's a walk of faith faith is the victory if you'll ever accomplish anything for God it'll be by faith not what you can see and feel but by faith glory to God Amen okay uh the Capstone of Love is Here to seal up the Pyramid of Our Lives brother Coleman you say it's here by faith I say it like I always I say it by faith then presently here it comes John said it by faith there's one standing among you and the next day he come but that day there's one standing among you and today the Capstone of Love is Here amen okay so now here's a little something here that the prophet did in 1962 uh when he preached those great messages that was the year of storing up the cabbages and carrots and whatever and the five plans had come together and he knew something was going on and he preached such outstanding messages greatest Bell for and all end time seed sign all through there and then uh statue of a perfect man and the guide and blasphemous names and all through there then he came down I had thank God I was there for S this the time uh December 30th then on the then we had the Lord supper on the then on then on the 31st it was the evening of uh it was what was it uh New Year's Eve that's right and took the Lord's Supper he preached the contest page8 paragraph 39 and this was a prayer that he prayed for 1963 for the people and this is the prayer that I'm praying for you from now on make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us oh Lord God with thy Mighty hand Jehovah bless these ministers here

hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock there was the Rock and had to take a crowbar or something and pride open and inside with pure white granite the campstone praise God it was hidden in there amen and them Thunders praise the Lord that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God now here it is and now keep this thought with you now cap off the pyramids of our life amen now who in the world in 1962 had that full pyramid in them he had just preached it but yet he said Camp off the Pyramid of our life Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessings be upon us all may the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us may the power of the Resurrection be manifested God how we thank you tonight we are yours we give ourselves fully to you lord well friends this is our promise from the prophet that uh I want to preach about today okay I have three questions you may be seated who is the campstone the Cornerstone the Chief Cornerstone and The Headstone and what is purpose in being here question number two how does this headstone Capstone of love come upon you what is the Revelation to bring him down upon us number three Job 38 4-7 God had been questioning in job and asking on where were you then Jo where are you when this happened and when that happened and that'll be my third question if I hope to get to it praise the lord well amen well feel like getting a little warm in here I don't know what in the world was wrong with these people in here amen praise God anyway Psalms 11822 the Holy Spirit speaking through David uh David had he said the the stone which the builders ref Jews has become The Headstone of the corner rejected amen then Jesus Christ come along himself say Matthew 2242 and other places and Jesus Christ identified as him himself as that headstone that would be refused and rejected he told the Pharisees amen and in the apostolic Alpha Church uh acts 41 after that great healing at the gate call Beautiful uh they they got stirred up as long as they gave out the books and tapes praise God they didn't bother them amen but when the lame man was healed all Jerusalem was shook up for about 33 years they haven't bother you too much you've been giving out books and tapes but brother when you let the cancers and the tumors and the cripples and the blind begin to see and then you going to see something then brother you're going to see the World Council become begin to move in but don't worry when it gets up there praise God greater than this shall you do praise God because I go to my father oh hallelujah praise God never fail amen God has a promise to be manifested for every trial of your life for every situation in this world he knew what the devil would do here and there and there and that time for his elected he has something there for them to meet the challenges of that time so there's nothing never to be discouraged about you should never look down you should never be discouraged should be always encouraged pressing on pressing on pressing on knowing that God will not fail you knowing he didn't fail the Hebrew boys in the fire he didn't fail Daniel in the lion Den praise God he'll never fail you he didn't fail Moses when he got to the Red Sea he said Moses take up that stick I brought you here stand still and see the salvation of your God God cannot fail he'll not fail you I don't care how many sins you mind down in this morning praise God he will not fail you amen the Capstone of Love is Here praise God to seal you to deliver you Hallelujah to cause a seventh under Revival what are you worrying about what are you fearing in about praise His wonderful name amen you may be seated glory to God amen amen after that great healing Peter stood out there and said this is the stone which was set at n of you Builders this Stone which is now become The Headstone of the corner what happened he said there's no other name name amen the name of the stone then was Jesus Christ he said this is the stone and there's no other name he attached your name to the stone praise God and Jesus Christ is your headstone your Capstone your Chief Cornerstone your Cornerstone Hallelujah [Applause] Christ yes sir I'm only preaching to the elected those that knew they were there Hallelujah Glory so Peter identified The Headstone Capstone in the alpha bride amen you may be seated seems like somewhere around the world Amen somebody got to step out and identify it again in the Omega bride you believe that somebody somewhere on this Earth a minister somebody has got to step out and said this is the stone that was rejected of you Builders Hallelujah there's no other name given under Heaven whereby you may be saved other than the Lord Jesus Christ son of man Amen Brother John praise God glory I know your brother John dark glances and all praise God hallelujah amen yes sir he told me come on praise the Lord Glory I'm coming brother fast as I can Glory so Peter amen Peter did that you may be seated and then brother then Apostle Paul he come along and put the thing in order at at the beginning of the church seventh Church age to Ephesians and Ephesians 2:20 and you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone he put the Cornerstone down there with faith amen you got it now but under there Peter had already identified Christ that was Christ in the apostles that was Christ in the early bride and then now we're going to have seven Church ages and then then and the and the Chief Cornerstone is the head stone is the Capstone amen but it was an oddl looking Stone and everybody didn't go for it praise God but but uh Peter uh Paul identified anyway and Paul said but as the billing begin to materialize no this is on uh dedicating ourselves rejected Cornerstone as the billing begin to materialize they realize that the hole that was left the arstone fit it to the dot that's where the spiritual bill is today today that's why the bride bilding of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom is because the builders has rejected the Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the day of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit now we already have the stones you are the stones the stones of God for ordained see and we got them all the way from Ephesus Amen to lead AIA we're only waiting for for that headstone that the billers rejected waiting for his coming the capping Stone these great Stones you are confessions now we know the confession is a stone I'm a upon the rock of this Revelation Peter you are confessing Peter confess thou art a Christ and we confess thou art a Christ and we come out of the world hallelujah we're in the bride confessions I'm Sanctified I'm not going back in the world no more a confession praise God to your family to your friends to your job confessions Stones praise God not sometimes up and sometimes down amen praise the Lord so we see now you may be seated standing in the Gap brother Brown speaking there and he's talking about the three stages there then we come down to the end the last message is supposed to straighten that all up to bring these things to One Faith one Lord one baptism and then he goes on to say but the camp on the pyramid was never put on I've been in cairu Egypt and the camp never did come because it was a Cornerstone it was a headstone for in the church it was the Cornerstone there you are that started the church in Ephesus Chief Cornerstone see in the church church it was the Cornerstone now watch in the full Church up at the top it was The Headstone there you are then rainbows is The Headstone in the full church and that's what we're coming to today and this season and on this third phase you got to know who you are and what your promises praise God may be seated so it never did come on rejected and it will come I believe when it's coming that the church WIll shaped from justification Luther sanctification Wesley and the Pentecostal message now here we are now we'll bring the church to such a minority and a ministry will be among those people it be exactly the same Ministry that Jesus did that'll bring Jesus on top love L do you see it now the rainbows will be Christ Ministry that will bring L Jesus Christ himself the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the bright and Morning Star the lily of the valley it'll be a Ministry among those people that'll be exactly the same Ministry that Jesus did that'll bring Jesus love and catch the whole thing away well who do you say this [Applause] is yes sir he may be seated so now we see Malachi 4 restored back to campstone headstone Seven Seals amen and of The campstone Headstone promise for this bride but he brought it back in in a form of promise promises he revealed every mechanic with a promise of Dynamics at the right at the appointed time to come into your mechanics then will come the Dynamics it happened to Enoch he was just going along in the mechanics one day all of a sudden the dynamic struck him I don't know what day but that's why you should always be on fire that's why you should never come in the house of God sad and down and mumbling along can't sing how do you know that the Capstone w't suddenly drop down upon you praise God that's the reason why you have S leaders to exalt you that's why the ministers exalt you cuz they know that he may come in and he don't come in no dead Place coming where you on fire oh oh fire fire fire fire fall on me as it was in the day of Pentecost fire fall on me amen all right you got it Malachi 4 restored all this back Malachi 4 actually restored The Headstone Capstone back but in there was a promise for Dynamics and you don't know when it's coming which is Charity the love of God oh give me out little clues that you're going to catch it soon amen it's laying right there okay yes sir may be seated all right Capstone headstone Cornerstone let me let me Skip Along here and read something to you here okay I'm doing pretty good I guess great commissioner Great Commission Chattanooga Tennessee 1958 God's cutting out Stones you are the stones and uh someday the master stone that rejected Stone when the church got up so far they found out that they had a freak Stone they couldn't find no place it for it to fit but they come to find out that that was the Chief Cornerstone down in Ephesians see and you think Brethren that one of these days we're now watch we're going to realize that the Chief Cornerstone is the love of God now where's love at it's up on the top amen you're going to find that out and then the great church church will be camped over and God will take it to Glory that's why the the these the pyramid is so important Church dedication Cleveland that's where you churches has got today that's 1959 you denominations you're built you're plastered you got the buildings you drywalled but you you find there's a hole there somewhere or what did they find that the stone was rejected and Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone certainly you made denominations we have it the rest of them not in it you're leaving out the love of God to brotherly kindness add what charity the love of God Amen they're leaving it out and you're leaving out the love of God the Chief Cornerstone I don't care how many miracles you can perform how many profits you uh you have how many works of Grace you do it'll never meet or never do anything because the Church of the Living God is melted together and cemented by love and they rejected that stone praise God so friends we see amen now we're talking about stones and uh excuse me Church dedication on Blasphemous names 1962 but soon brother Braham said the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and seal up the church then the church will be raptured don't worry it's coming you can look as droopy as you want to look or walyed or with unbelief but brother it's coming otherwise I wouldn't be standing up here tell you that right now tired and sick as I am praise God now don't forget these last two Wednesday night messages Grace Billy Graham power all robits presence Malachi 4 son of man you got it okay Mary's belief the church has come from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit now going into the very headstone and the presence see the presence huh Grace B Billy G power all Robbs presence Malachi 4 that's what he's saying he's prophesying way back here and now going into the very headstone and the presence of the angel of God and now uh Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost so present doing exactly the same works that he did on Earth which is bringing forth the church and the Christ to unite together just exactly what he promised now don't let your conscience be dull now and wake up Prophet said it right himself cuz I felt the dullness in here amen it's hard to preach the dullness amen people who just come to church and stare at you amen so therefore the presence of God he said amen now he said it there so now friends in St John 14 12 and all these things amen friends we left now listen friends we left lay out of seal 35

just to go on through the seven Church ages and die out you were created to be in them rainbows and manifest and stand on this Earth with full of adop spoken word eaten condition that's what God Made You For he picked you out as a special person to stand on this Earth to glorify him praise God to go after the lost with the spoken word of God to speak the word the cripples walk in the blind seea Hallelujah that's what you're here for not to come in here and sleep and can't praise the Lord one little mind battle knock you down this is the hour for you now that's why what you think I'm preaching this to you this is for now may be seated amen uh when were there ever time in history waiting the manifestation but before the atonement was made before the holy ghost ever poured out all the old Testament on down there there could not have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things have been brought is that right we we we have a message we know where we're going we know about the fourth seal for to we know what the Beast is ready to do we know about everything and we know where we who we are and we know what we're going to get and we know where we going everything has been brought coming shapen up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men you can't do it like this so I'm I'm preaching a message to you that the campstone is coming down like in the song that brother Joey sang and the holies of holies the Holy Ghost itself but somebody got to say [Applause] it yes sir may be seated the Son of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it adjin join him and his church together do you finally see it that's right and then those stones that fit up in the rainbows there around that headstone will have to be Stones that'll be so completely like that stone that it'll fit joint and everywhere the pyramid is so perfect you can't run a razor blade between them where them Stones go together such beautiful masonry some of them would weigh hundreds of tons up in air so perfectly put together glory to God the holy spirit is here to tell you that you are Stone a confession and you shall be filled you shall be filled [Applause] Glory Hallelujah yes sir my glory to God Amen I shall be filled I shall be filled that's my song make up your own praise God yes sir amen now you are the true church Daniel 70 weeks but the true church all over the world shaped down to a place that there's come a Ministry among them exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ whose Ministry was that William brandom God gave him that Ministry just like Christ in three pools what for to bring back The Headstone first pull second pull third pull they'll come angels from the West to bring down the headstone Malachai for brought it down it's here oh in a message of mechanics and Dynamics do you see what you're in how can we be sloving and walking around we're in the Capstone Revelation Capstone message oh yes sir now what they got they got the thing and condition now what's the next thing you may be seated this rejected Stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what without hand God sent it do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head is the head the Capstone and the Very one that they rejected through the Gentile age is Christ and Christ was not cut and put in here as a viker or Son of God or some great dignitary in the church he is the Holy Spirit and the camp of the pyramid will be Jes will be Christ coming so I think maybe your problem is I think there's a problem in here this is Christ The Headstone Capstone Cornerstone this also the holy spirit this also is The Headstone the Capstone the whole thing right here this is the Heavenly Jesus Christ this is the Earthly Jesus Christ does it help you now cuz I was picking it up well how can I be in both places

born of God he's coming for a church that's been re reborn Again by the spirit of God because the strength of that headstone runs all through the church like a magnet he's moving here and he's moving here just like a magnet and that's way is going to move across this earth oh praise God once the Holy Spirit comes into your soul you you'll be no more head Christians no more you'll be heart

that judgment Capstone coming down that headstone sounds like Greek or something maybe I don't know amen but it's not cuz today you're going to receive a revelation of who you are before you ever

to preach them back to you so that Christ can come upon those promises that he himself spoke through Malachi 4 if Malachi 4 said Seven Seals are open we said the same thing then Christ can come upon Seven Seals open if Malachi 4 said you got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we said the same thing then Christ can give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost Glory see the word must be in you amen he got to get to the ministry until Christ the church and Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessings in the Bible all of it is yours everything that promise of this age is yours but if we leave anything out now there's your false anointed they leave things out of the seven seal message and when the Dynamics Falls they can get nothing I hope you see it the nor stries that well he says

or woman possesses this then the Capone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost then the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of these beings and makes his complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life is in here they are in Christ and their life is dead and hidden Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 that's right you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith then virtue and these other things that added to

some out of this age some out of that age some out of that age and all together shaping like a pyramid is added to your faith then when the Capstone comes comes the Holy Spirit cements it together there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's why it's so short today Hallelujah third one ordination that night he he said this here in the beginning and remember this morning's lesson which was Blasphemous names these virtues has to be in there before the Capstone will ever come come on it oh you might shout you might sing you might speak with tongues and dance that has nothing to do with it until these things scripturally proven is Seal into you the Holy Spirit seals you in as an individual then are you a son of son and daughter of God so speaking in tongues don't mean you of God working on Miracles don't prove you of God it's the things of fruits of the spirit that proves that you are in God when you see that life sealed Away by the Holy Ghost God let that be us if we done sin may the great Heavenly Father forgive us for it well Hallelujah th the glory oh praise God well there you are Church my my my these virtues has to be in there before the cap come on it yes sir well I believe question number two is Thoroughly answered is it answered huh you know how to come upon you you're born again first but what you're waiting for is the Dynamics to come that you might be born again and then you quickly add these up it won't last long it' be a very short time and blasphemous names they got got a real blessing there that was a Saturday afternoon before the Sunday I went to see uh brother Brandon Saturday brother Hunt and I and the family there that's when we had the little interview and sister Brandon brother brand said make sure you come back for some meat cuz he had
