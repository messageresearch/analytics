[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh that's having one sister sighs though in my first service here at Azusa I witnessed two brothers sitting in their seats speaking in tongues not very so cried out oh Lord these people have something I do not have brother Seymour they made an altar call insane that if anyone would like to teach the Lord for pardon sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come and bow at the altar I went alone with many others raising my hands towards heaven a crime lord I want my inheritance the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire instantly in the spirit I saw as it were a bright star away in the distance oh I knew it was he and as he drew nearer he was in the form of a beautiful white dog in his presence I was slain upon the floor it was then that he began to work in need I had died out to all I knew and believed oh how I was shaking under the power of time in vain a stillness as quiet as death came upon me and I heard the Lord whisper clay in the Potters hand oh how I was shaking I had read that many times in the scriptures but never until now did I know its true meaning I knew now that I could receive him and then it happened the dog descended into my heart oh how can I ever praise him from what he has done [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] all the contain myself how to do my lord is there yet one more testimony brother I am a Jew and I came to the city to investigate these so-called speaking in tongues no one here knows my true name because I am here under an assumed name no one knows my occupation or anything about me I go and listen to preachers I hear their sermons and I pick them apart I used them to lecture against this Christian of religion but when I entered the room this spoke to me in my native Hebrew tongue she told me my name my first name and my last name she told me why I was in the city she told me my occupation then she called upon me to repent for the wrong she told me things that it is impossible for anyone anyone to know [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] [Music] the Angels [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] angels in heaven [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I had a vision and it has left me very troubled and I wanted to tell you about it in this vision I saw the devil and many of his demons and they were gathered at this large table and at the table they were discussing the problems they were having with the Pentecostal people and what they were planning to do about it and they're all discussing the giving suggestions and finally this one demon he stood up and said huh what if we take away the Pentecostal people's joy and peace well some of the demon saw was a good idea and they said yeah yeah sounds good but the devil the devil said no because they would still have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so those demons they went back to thinking and pondering and finally another team instead of me said huh I've got it what if we give them the baptism of the unsanctified laughs well all those demons they were born they would share they're clapping but it seemed or this vision has left me very troubled [Music] that's quite something that is quite some we just must be more careful and vigilant that the Lord may continue to work this great work through

at the same like a small group we have here 20 sometimes we have so seven days a week three times a day and sometimes the services were just so powerful they'd run right into the other one we'd be there just praising the law and the people in the building - it couldn't take no more and then they'd hang around the windows just trying to hear the word of God and see me with God amongst them to the Spirit of God not sure I could have been there uncle Seymour well I wish you good luck but you know the Lord is good the Lord is guy you know powerful service for me though we go just like you see

through all of these years all of the strife and the leavings and all the unbelief and he's just been preparing our souls yes for that city amen and I just love it when we can get together like this and encourage each other and sing and praise and our encouraging is so important because we know that when we do that every obstacle that that old devil puts in our past just it's like nothing because our faith just gets old yes but you know the Lord has been preparing us for this journey all the trials because this is not the place that we're supposed to be staying he's done prepared us for
