[0:00] now this morning I want to go straight
[0:02] to the word of God and for uh we know
[0:06] that we are here to feed upon the word
[0:08] of God praise the Lord let us turn to St
[0:12] Mark the 12th
[0:17] chapter 28th
[0:20] verse through verse
[0:28] 30 and I want to read if you're writing
[0:30] down the scriptures Micah the 6th
[0:33] chapter the 8th
[0:36] verse and Titus the 2 chapter verse
[0:44] 11-14 we reading from St Mark 12th
[0:47] chapter 28th
[0:49] verse and one of the scribes came and
[0:52] having heard them reasoning together and
[0:55] perceiving that he had answered them
[0:57] well asked him which is the first
[1:00] commandment of
[1:01] all Jesus answered to him the first of
[1:04] all the Commandments is here o Israel
[1:08] the Lord our God is one
[1:11] Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:14] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:18] and with all thy mind and with all thy
[1:20] strength this is the first
[1:23] commandment in micer the 6th chapter the
[1:26] 8th
[1:27] verse he hath showed thee Oh man
[1:30] what is good and what doth the Lord
[1:32] require of thee but to do justly and to
[1:36] love mercy and to walk humbly with thy
[1:40] God and I want to read from
[1:43] Titus to tie all of this into one
[1:47] purpose Titus
[1:50] 2 11th verse for the grace of God that
[1:54] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[1:57] men teaching us that Den dying
[2:00] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[2:03] live soberly righteously and godly in
[2:06] this present world looking for that
[2:08] blessed hope and the Glorious appearing
[2:11] of the great God and our Savior Jesus
[2:13] Christ who gave himself for us that he
[2:16] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[2:19] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[2:23] zelous of Good Works May the Lord have a
[2:26] blessing to reading of his word I like
[2:28] to title this little thought seeing God
[2:31] seeing God and I like to break it down
[2:35] into two
[2:36] subjects uh seeing God the purpose of
[2:39] God and seeing God in the face of Jesus
[2:43] Christ um we know that this uh has been
[2:48] the Church of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:51] Christ's ultimate goal this has been the
[2:55] spiritual people that are called by his
[2:58] name this is their has been their
[3:01] purpose of
[3:03] life and I was reading some little poem
[3:06] it reads like this with no author on it
[3:09] my goal is God himself not Joy nor peace
[3:14] nor even blessing but himself my God am
[3:19] so I like this s to use that you know
[3:22] and Titus tells us here about the grace
[3:26] of God that has appeared to all men
[3:28] bringing salvation
[3:31] and he says also in the 13th verse the
[3:34] 12th verse rather uh this Grace has
[3:37] trained us to reject and to renounce all
[3:41] ungodliness worldly lust and to live
[3:45] devout and holy lives in this present
[3:48] world and while we're living in this
[3:51] present world as we are right now
[3:53] awaiting and looking for the
[3:55] Fulfillment the realization of our
[3:58] blessed hope even the Glorious appearing
[4:02] of our great God and our Savior Jesus
[4:05] Christ Hallelujah the Messiah the
[4:08] anointed one seeing God in other words
[4:12] we should be of such a
[4:15] state such a uh um uh a uh I should say
[4:22] in a sphere that uh we are are H with
[4:26] God Amen we are harnessed to the work of
[4:30] God we are believing we're trusting
[4:33] we're expecting we are yearning to see
[4:37] God Amen nothing else will
[4:41] suffice even as I believe it was one of
[4:43] these disciples Thomas said uh show us
[4:47] God and that will suffice us you see me
[4:50] you see God Amen and so now um seeing
[4:55] God is the purpose of
[4:58] life think that they can gain this prize
[5:03] uh through money or fame or position or
[5:07] something here in the world or enjoy
[5:10] that pleasure or a worldly lust or
[5:13] something here if they could do these
[5:15] things here or whatever it is through
[5:17] family or friends or whatever it is that
[5:19] they could be truly satisfied but we
[5:22] cannot be truly satisfied that way
[5:24] there's only one satisfaction Jesus
[5:27] Christ is our satisfaction they all
[5:30] wrong for it was over in Psalm
[5:33] 42 where uh uh speaking about the David
[5:38] here was his heart was open to the Lord
[5:41] I believe that David here expressed what
[5:43] is on his heart as the heart paned after
[5:46] the water Brooks so panth my soul after
[5:49] thee Oh God hallelujah my soul thirsteth
[5:52] for God for the Living God When shall I
[5:55] come and appear before God my tears have
[5:59] been my meet day and night while they
[6:01] continually say unto me where is thy
[6:04] God this is the way or wish it be this
[6:08] is the state that we should be in
[6:10] continually searching after God it has
[6:14] been said that there is a God shaped
[6:18] Blank Spot in man's heart and it has
[6:22] been said that there is a man shaped
[6:25] Blank Spot in God's heart praise God and
[6:29] it it it is this uh um God shaped Blank
[6:33] Spot something that God has put in our
[6:36] hearts that makes us yearn and desire
[6:41] that that Blank Spot Of God will be
[6:43] filled amen and there's only one person
[6:45] that can fill that spot that is Jesus
[6:48] Christ of Nazareth Hallelujah he is the
[6:50] only one and in in understanding of the
[6:53] threefold mystery of God that God had
[6:57] this revelation hid way in his heart in
[7:01] his mind before the foundation of the
[7:04] world that God would have the
[7:06] preeminence in Christ and that Christ
[7:08] would have the preeminence in the bride
[7:11] to do this to restore us back to Eden
[7:14] Hallelujah to bring us back to a perfect
[7:17] state where God walked with man on the
[7:21] earth in the cool of the evening where
[7:24] God fellowship with his creation and
[7:27] where the the creation understood and
[7:31] that their very every desire their will
[7:34] was in submission to this great God
[7:36] Hallelujah in the Garden of Eden but
[7:38] that state of bliss was broken by sin
[7:42] and every and ever since because there's
[7:45] a a man shaped Blank Spot in God's heart
[7:50] ever since that happened God has been
[7:52] yearning and Desiring that man would
[7:56] would because return back to that same
[8:00] that same perfect spot where he could
[8:03] fellowship with his Creations again amen
[8:06] and therefore because God rich in Mercy
[8:09] he went out searching for those that
[8:12] that will fill that spot and thanks be
[8:15] to God we are the ones that was in his
[8:18] mind before the foundation of the world
[8:20] we are predestinated to fill that God
[8:24] that man Blank Spot in God's heart and
[8:27] God's heart is Jesus Christ he amen
[8:29] praise God Amen it is because of this
[8:32] that God yearns for us he pursues us
[8:36] when you see a man in love with a woman
[8:37] he goes after her he Woos her he cours
[8:41] her glory to God and God Is wooing Us he
[8:45] he has gone after us he's yearning for
[8:47] us he loves us he cours us any way he
[8:51] can get us back through thick and thin
[8:53] trial tribulation sorrow whatever way it
[8:56] is God will bring us back that way
[9:00] why because he loves us we are we are
[9:03] the only ones who can fill that spot
[9:06] nothing else will do it God is yearning
[9:09] Desiring our fellowship Glory praise our
[9:12] God Amen that he had with Adam in the
[9:14] Garden of Eden praise our God I believe
[9:18] it is uh Revelation 4:11 read on this
[9:24] wise Revelation
[9:27] 4:11 uh Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to
[9:30] receive glory and honor and power for
[9:33] thou H has created all things and for
[9:36] thy pleasure they are and were created
[9:39] there it is praise God we were created
[9:41] for his pleasure is that right amen just
[9:45] for his pleasure and and and and uh uh
[9:48] other words Man was created for God's
[9:50] pleasure he was intended to be the
[9:53] Delight of God am and the object of his
[9:56] affection what a love story amen between
[9:59] God and His creation between Christ and
[10:03] his wife between God and his sons and
[10:06] his daughters amen and uh Enoch had this
[10:09] testimony he walked with God he pleased
[10:12] God by faith Enoch walked with God and
[10:16] he had a testimony before he was
[10:19] translated amen before he was translated
[10:22] that he pleased God Jesus Christ had the
[10:24] same testimony I always do the things
[10:27] that please my father always do the
[10:30] things and what is God trying to do now
[10:32] through his word to get his word to us
[10:34] to know how to please him praise that's
[10:37] all he's trying to do this morning to
[10:39] bring you his word his Commandments to
[10:42] know how to please him and then in
[10:45] loving obedience not with a whip not get
[10:48] in the house of God and you got to hear
[10:50] the word of no come and running in the
[10:52] house of God come in yearning and
[10:54] burning and desire to have fellowship
[10:57] with Jesus Christ the word of God not a
[11:00] duty not all stiff and all but broken
[11:04] humble contrary Lord what is thy will
[11:07] let thy will be done in my life though
[11:10] it slay me let it be done praise our God
[11:14] that's what the Lord is trying to get
[11:15] the the people
[11:17] to this is our purpose in life to see
[11:20] God only one provided way to see God and
[11:24] what is the purpose of life is allow God
[11:27] to fill that uh BL spot in our hearts to
[11:31] know God to love God to walk with God
[11:35] this is the scripture answer loving
[11:38] obedience to every word in complete
[11:40] surrendered
[11:41] submission this is to see God Ephesus
[11:45] fell from this first love the early
[11:48] church had this love brother and the
[11:53] whole uh religious World knew it for
[11:56] when they saw this love of God burning
[11:58] in the disciple heart they took note
[12:01] that they had been with Jesus for they
[12:04] loved Jesus and they expressed Jesus to
[12:07] the religious world because around the
[12:09] bottom they had a fervent desire to
[12:12] please God a passion to know his word uh
[12:16] uh a cry for reaching out in the spirit
[12:19] to have more of God for God to fill them
[12:23] uh now you know in in the Church of
[12:25] Ephesus um the name means also a relaxed
[12:29] drifting and so therefore that's why the
[12:32] Lord had to send the messenger to rebuke
[12:35] that age to get back to the first Works
[12:39] see cuz they were you can easily or
[12:41] because drift off the Lord can come down
[12:44] here and blesses and everything is
[12:47] wonderful and then the people get a
[12:49] little relx they don't make all the
[12:51] meetings anymore and they don't do this
[12:55] if he's got church you all they want
[12:56] things done a certain way they sort of
[12:58] just let it slip like a little Lex she's
[13:00] a very smooth Spirit you don't have to
[13:03] do this uh well you don't have to do
[13:05] that you don't have to fuss around here
[13:07] where that first love at where that
[13:09] yearning burning to please him in every
[13:12] way I always do the things that please
[13:14] the father where is that love at the
[13:17] love of many sh wank Co just forming
[13:20] fashion coming and moving but John
[13:22] understood what it was to love God the
[13:25] Apostle John for in 1 John 5:3 he said
[13:28] for this is the love you don't have to
[13:29] get anything hold it uh-uh for this is
[13:31] the love of God that we keep his
[13:33] Commandments his word that is the love
[13:35] of God now you know um we can have a
[13:38] great service here and oh we can praise
[13:41] God we can sing the songs of Zion but
[13:43] then watch and see after if you go
[13:45] outside see and see if you're in that
[13:48] word see if you're walking in it living
[13:51] in it see if you're walking contrary now
[13:53] if you are walking contrary it is God's
[13:57] love to us that we would because come
[14:00] back to the first love repent he says
[14:03] and come back I believe it was we were
[14:05] speaking this morning sister Co and I
[14:07] about the the church ages there and how
[14:10] God was in God had virtue in every age
[14:14] other words in every age there he was
[14:15] dealing with the church and then because
[14:18] in there you could go there and get
[14:20] virtue but this age here is nothing
[14:23] blind wretched miserable poor naked and
[14:27] don't know it they ain't one virtue here
[14:28] all
[14:29] and that's why one had to come with the
[14:32] virtue and virtue is spiritual energy
[14:35] and spiritual energy is the word of God
[14:37] Amen and that's why this age here uh uh
[14:40] is individuals who will come here and
[14:43] see God who will yearn and burn for God
[14:47] themselves not to see here that we would
[14:49] be come here and we get ministers and
[14:52] deacons and that's wonderful that's fine
[14:54] but we have got to see God for ourselves
[14:57] not to say well brother com said this
[14:59] here and I must do that that's not
[15:01] seeing God you have to see God for a
[15:04] burning your heart in your own heart
[15:05] when you go home and read his word make
[15:08] love to him
[15:09] yourself praise God this only a ministry
[15:11] here to because teaching his ways but we
[15:14] ourselves in our homes and jobs and so
[15:16] we should be learning and burning and
[15:18] yearning for Christ there so when when
[15:21] we come here we bring a fire in here
[15:23] amen we then all of us is in love with
[15:25] Jesus here and Jesus comes down in our
[15:28] midst fills all the house amen and Moves
[15:31] In and Out makes love to each individual
[15:33] and as his word goes out whatever need
[15:35] you have he brings the word into your
[15:37] heart and in you're blessed hallelujah
[15:40] what a service that's going to be praise
[15:42] God Amen but so therefore uh we should
[15:46] be back to for to for me to live as
[15:49] Christ that's the way we should be on
[15:51] fire for God back to per we should want
[15:54] to see sin exposed cuz like anas and sa
[15:58] we should have our whole heart soul mind
[16:01] life go back to the way it was before
[16:05] and there's only one way back that is
[16:07] repentance other words we know here some
[16:10] of us here how we was on fire when this
[16:12] message come forward brother our minds
[16:15] was Sanctified our hearts was on fire to
[16:18] grab every word amen that's right and
[16:21] our walk in our jobs and so for all of a
[16:23] sudden 63 4 and 5 some begin to wne away
[16:28] what happen happen but Jesus Christ
[16:30] loves you this morning he has come down
[16:33] here this morning through his word don't
[16:35] miss it he's making love to you this
[16:37] morning by the word to get back to that
[16:39] first estate when he called you and
[16:41] yearned for you in love he called you
[16:43] and you were so on fire with him Lord
[16:46] what will thou have me to do whatever it
[16:48] was we know CU we have seen people here
[16:51] like that walking in that life but they
[16:53] Wan away they went away here they went
[16:55] away there but he's here this morning to
[16:58] call all your back to that first love
[17:01] and what is it her isra with the Lord
[17:03] thy God is one Lord amen to love the
[17:06] Lord thy God all thy heart with all thy
[17:08] soul with all thy mind with all thy
[17:11] strength that's what he's trying to get
[17:13] us to do this morning
[17:15] friends there's only one way back bring
[17:18] forth as John said bring forth fruits
[17:19] meat for repentance amen prove it by
[17:24] your life we can say it that doesn't
[17:26] mean nothing we can come in and sing do
[17:28] all kind things in here but prove it by
[17:31] your life in other words true hearts cry
[17:34] to God in sorrow then God shall restore
[17:37] and that Glory that you had one time
[17:39] shall be restored back to you again when
[17:42] you are repenting it weeps in the
[17:44] presence of God because it has grieved
[17:46] the Holy One the righteous one when a
[17:49] person when they repent they don't
[17:51] repent because it's me or this one and
[17:54] that one because they grieve God other
[17:56] words if the the word says God says do
[17:59] this here and I do something wrong and
[18:02] because I I do it to you a person well I
[18:04] don't have to go to you all stiff and
[18:06] form like well now because of forgive me
[18:08] brother see that's not nothing but you
[18:11] are repented because you grieve God not
[18:14] me see but you don't see the people who
[18:17] they could catch at they at they
[18:19] grieving God they are more interested in
[18:21] the flesh thing and saying uh because
[18:24] brother forgive me but I mean have you
[18:26] uh fell down on the floor somewhere
[18:29] and cried out and weeped and wailed
[18:31] before God because you grieved him in
[18:33] one spot that's what he's looking for
[18:36] praise God the the great God who has
[18:39] appeared as the god of our Salvation to
[18:42] restore us back to this first love the
[18:44] word friends the word of the Lord has
[18:47] come forth to bring us back this way
[18:50] what doth the lord god require of thee
[18:52] to Humble thyself and to walk with thy
[18:55] God to fear the lord to walk in his ways
[18:58] to love him
[18:59] seeing God is the purpose of life man's
[19:02] Chief end is to glorify God and enjoy
[19:05] him forever that should be our chief end
[19:08] friends and we see the love of many is
[19:10] waxing cold the Deep hunger for God is
[19:13] laxing is because lacking rather or we
[19:16] should settle for nothing less than God
[19:20] himself we shouldn't settle for any
[19:22] little blessing or whatever it is but we
[19:23] should all want to see Jesus Hallelujah
[19:27] see here's why
[19:29] now watch instead of uh stressing
[19:32] Holiness and walking in the word for
[19:35] personal life in order to to see God
[19:38] many have put the emphasis on service
[19:42] for God oh yeah pastors and ministers
[19:46] and deacons and helps and governments
[19:49] and many of these people think because
[19:51] they are Pastor or a minister or advant
[19:54] that they are really serving God this is
[19:56] the ultimate itself This Is the End is
[19:58] only a means toward an end this is not
[20:00] the end but they get deceived and and
[20:03] some even get lifted up in the offices
[20:05] that I'm really somebody and they begin
[20:08] to judge one another because by their
[20:10] success with God is having an office
[20:13] that's the wrong thing to do because he
[20:14] can have somebody who is nothing some
[20:16] old Aly rap somebody that he saves him
[20:19] and fills him with this first love and
[20:21] that person can sit here on fire for God
[20:24] a love going back and forth with Jesus
[20:27] amen and that person could be in a
[20:29] perfect state with Christ and another
[20:31] one walking around serving God and all
[20:33] puffed up see uh-uh you have to seek God
[20:36] for himself not because of service see
[20:40] now um I believe it's Proverbs 27:6 says
[20:44] faithful are the wounds of a friend but
[20:47] the kisses of an enemy are
[20:51] deceitful so Paul Illustrated the first
[20:54] part when he wounded Peter Cuz Peter was
[20:57] the blame when at this dissimulation and
[21:01] in his treatment of of Peter for Paul
[21:03] with stood Peter to the face before them
[21:05] all and told Peter to his face what he
[21:08] was doing see and so therefore a a
[21:11] proverb says faithful are the wounds of
[21:14] a friend it's good to be wounded face to
[21:17] face amen because only a friend will
[21:19] wound you with the word for the kisses
[21:22] of the enemy are deceitful and Judas he
[21:25] fulfilled that part for he kissed the
[21:27] Lord Hal Hallelujah I love you and he
[21:30] was deceitful amen amen so the Lord
[21:34] Jesus Christ May wound you this morning
[21:35] a little
[21:37] bit but it's
[21:40] faithful amen praise the Lord see so
[21:43] therefore I rather be honest with you
[21:46] and I have always tried to be I know I
[21:49] have wounded many in here praise the
[21:51] Lord but uh there's somebody to heal
[21:55] those wounds the Holy Spirit heals those
[21:58] wounds see but I'd rather tell you to
[22:00] your face from here from the tell you in
[22:04] the back or anywhere or go to you and
[22:06] tell you exactly how you're walking and
[22:09] it might take the skin off your hi amen
[22:12] but glory to God it's going to do you
[22:14] good amen praise God see rather than to
[22:17] tell you that you're all right I'll say
[22:19] something nice if you go in the back and
[22:21] I say well yes sister oh that's all
[22:23] right see something nice and smooth see
[22:26] I mean now so therefore that's a Kiss of
[22:28] the devil that's all it is see and I
[22:30] would be because allowing myself to
[22:33] prophesy something smooth to you but a
[22:35] man of God should tell you the word of
[22:36] God Amen see now um many think of of
[22:41] Christian Life as consisting in serving
[22:43] God as as fully and and efficiently as
[22:46] we can and they have all kind of
[22:48] techniques and methods and so forth they
[22:51] put more stress on that see to carry out
[22:54] the service we need power and and so
[22:56] instead of longing for God you find you
[22:59] might slip off and long for power so
[23:02] therefore make sure now the Dynamics are
[23:05] getting ready to fall and in this now
[23:07] don't be longing for power long for
[23:10] Jesus Christ Hallelujah long to see him
[23:13] he's the one see and therefore there's a
[23:16] fine line here now so I feel led to warn
[23:19] you this morning see many uh won't
[23:22] understand this now see and then there's
[23:24] others who they will seek God for some
[23:27] inner experience see and it's not so
[23:30] much for the Hunger for God but is to
[23:32] have some Joy or some happiness inside
[23:36] and if you if you get off looking for
[23:38] inner experience then you find you want
[23:40] to this meeting and you go to this
[23:42] Minister and you go over here looking
[23:44] for that something you go out to Arizona
[23:47] you go down to Indiana you go over here
[23:49] you go over there looking for that
[23:51] looking for it rather than looking for
[23:54] him looking for a certain uh experience
[23:57] to make you feel good
[23:59] but we should look for Jesus Christ amen
[24:02] see so therefore both of these ends fall
[24:05] short of our ultimate end and that is to
[24:07] see God and to enjoy him forever praise
[24:10] God so now we see then that this vision
[24:14] of of life that we are to have here is a
[24:17] god-centered uh Vision see it's the
[24:20] original relationship that uh Adam had
[24:23] with Jes with God Adam knew that he had
[24:27] been created
[24:29] um to Delight God see and his only
[24:32] concern was to respond to that Divine
[24:35] affection that's all see to live for him
[24:38] to do his will and it was Joy
[24:42] continually for Adam to submit until sin
[24:45] come in and Adam did nothing
[24:47] independently of God there lies the
[24:51] secret now as he lived in submission to
[24:53] God now watch every need in man's nature
[24:57] was satisfied
[24:59] as long as he was in submission to
[25:01] Christ God every need in his nature God
[25:06] satisfied it Hallelujah that's a
[25:09] powerful statement now I believe this
[25:11] some man I have down here CS Lewis said
[25:14] in perfect cyclic movement being power
[25:18] and joy descended from God to man in the
[25:21] form of gift Grace and return from man
[25:25] to God in the form of obedient love and
[25:27] ecstatic adoration praise God this is
[25:31] the end for the bride see we are here
[25:33] this morning to put the emphasis on on
[25:36] being being in love with Jesus instead
[25:38] of doing many want to do something for
[25:42] the Lord and God is trying to because
[25:44] get us to whole still and wait on the
[25:47] Lord Martha was doing something very
[25:51] diligent in service doing something and
[25:54] all busy and running around the table
[25:56] and Mary was being
[25:58] At His Feet worshiping her Lord I Hope
[26:02] You See It friends you see the me now
[26:04] therefore but now Martha was correct in
[26:06] service but the first thing is the
[26:10] yearning the burning desire for the Lord
[26:12] to just be with him to see him see
[26:15] praise God so now um when we can
[26:19] understand this here see uh then
[26:21] there'll come um uh what we would say an
[26:25] easing of of tension many of us are all
[26:29] tight and nervous and uh excited cuz uh
[26:34] uh did I do right today that's not no
[26:37] way because God wants to deal with you
[26:39] see you like you here he want you to
[26:42] relax and now here's why see um the
[26:45] situation will be the same situations
[26:48] but if he can get us to relax then we
[26:50] have changed see if fellowship with God
[26:54] is our first concern then we have that
[26:56] we have fellowship with God then then if
[26:59] that is our concern to fellowship with
[27:01] the word Jesus Christ then in the
[27:04] kitchen you can have joy on the job you
[27:09] can have joy and fellowship in sickness
[27:13] if it's fellowship with Christ well the
[27:15] word says in suffering you fellowship
[27:16] with him too then you can have joy and
[27:19] any kind of a trial if you're only
[27:22] designed to see God Amen you'll see him
[27:25] in everything amen then you can be
[27:28] satisfy then that portion will be yours
[27:31] and you won't be worry worrying nervous
[27:34] running up and down no more you you just
[27:36] be calm for you are happy you're
[27:38] fellowshipping with Jesus Christ amen
[27:41] praise the Lord then uh whatever comes
[27:44] across our path no matter how irksome
[27:48] how trivial it's nothing if this is the
[27:52] way my Lord wants me to fellowship with
[27:54] him I'll do it for the glory of God Amen
[27:57] praise God
[27:58] and therefore it's there to be done for
[28:01] the glory of God and then gone will be
[28:04] the striving the bondage the frustration
[28:08] the whole world is now in in frustration
[28:11] I was just reading here the other day
[28:12] here Saturday that they got in the new
[28:16] look magazine which is to to come out
[28:18] next week because I saw in the post
[28:19] office Saturday that uh a California has
[28:22] started a great Revival out there and uh
[28:26] uh thousands are coming to Jesus
[28:28] Christ the a formerly young children who
[28:32] had the drugs and so forth they're now
[28:34] turning to Christ in droves a Revival is
[28:37] on now in California and is sweeping
[28:40] East what is it and they saying
[28:43] themselves that Jesus is the answer for
[28:46] the yearning Jesus is the one for that
[28:48] Blank Spot in their hearts and they're
[28:50] coming and brother BR said that they
[28:53] would go on preaching and think they're
[28:55] being saved and then they're coming by
[28:57] the thousand
[28:58] they getting B they're doing everything
[29:01] and to think that we who are nothing
[29:04] through no goodness of our own he came
[29:06] down here in the in in the evening time
[29:09] and called us out to give us the real
[29:12] fellowship with him the word of God and
[29:15] these here are striving frustration
[29:17] everything else learning yearning for
[29:19] this here and they're not getting it
[29:21] hallu and we sitting here this morning
[29:22] getting it think on that now think about
[29:26] the people here pres next and bringing
[29:28] his Revolution here his six-point
[29:31] program I even read this morning the
[29:33] times that where he's going to go out
[29:35] and uh to four different regions all
[29:37] across this country and preach this
[29:40] Gospel of his of uh giving a power back
[29:44] to the people I mean you must know what
[29:47] that means given the the all the mighty
[29:50] power the greatest nation up on the
[29:52] earth is that right the greatest uh
[29:55] natural Nation on the earth is the power
[29:58] is in America here is that right well
[30:00] therefore Nixon wants to give that power
[30:02] out to all the little groups across the
[30:04] country give it out share the revenue
[30:07] money is their power amen what about our
[30:10] Christ he picked this nation here to
[30:13] bring forth his power his word it's
[30:15] about time for him to because share his
[30:17] power also amen the Capstone power I'm
[30:20] talking about amen and even his White
[30:23] House AIDS are to go out across this
[30:24] country starting here in February and
[30:27] preach this go goel go to the Mayors and
[30:30] the governors and so forth sit down with
[30:32] them and meetings and so forth and
[30:33] explain to them that they must get
[30:35] behind their senors to vote for these
[30:37] things and here we are what about the
[30:40] the plan of Union here with the a church
[30:42] group that they're doing the same thing
[30:44] and pretty soon you'll see this sharing
[30:46] the revenue hook up with the church
[30:48] that's right you'll see it see and now
[30:51] in the midst of all this here here is
[30:52] Jesus Christ pursuing us running us down
[30:55] some of us Amen to get us to be come
[30:58] back to him and be restored back that's
[31:00] what he's doing because he loves us cuz
[31:03] we are the apple of his eye there's a
[31:05] spot in in in in God's heart Hallelujah
[31:08] and he will not stop he is Relentless
[31:10] Hallelujah He will draw us back to him
[31:13] and no matter which way he's got to do
[31:15] it he will do it that's right so
[31:17] therefore we are that predestinated seed
[31:19] and if we will not by our own choice
[31:23] walk with him and want him he often has
[31:26] to allow sorrow suffering trials ill
[31:30] health smash plans and failure that's
[31:33] right so that in our need in our need we
[31:37] will find our need of him did you hear
[31:40] what I said
[31:41] amen our plans are all smashed up we
[31:43] going to do this something happens to it
[31:47] see then we find that Wing so
[31:50] big then we are deflated and then in
[31:53] that need we find him that's all he
[31:55] wants to do to have fellowship with he
[31:57] got do it that way you see friends you
[32:00] see what he's doing see so that in our
[32:03] need we will find our need of him such
[32:06] now such suffering is never wrathful but
[32:09] is Holy and only a restorative in his
[32:13] intention he's only trying to restore us
[32:15] back to that first state that he had
[32:18] with Adam in the Garden of Eden that
[32:21] Christ might have the preeminence in the
[32:23] bride and to restores Back to Eden amen
[32:26] praise God it is love of God humbling us
[32:30] and drawing us to the place of
[32:31] repentance and to God Christ today is
[32:35] trying to get us to a place of absolute
[32:37] dependence on him now here's why to see
[32:42] God is to apprehend him as a supply of
[32:46] our present need and believingly lay
[32:48] hold on him as such now everything has
[32:52] happened these past years is coming
[32:55] forth where we're going to we have to be
[32:57] stripped of this
[32:59] world and this message this morning is
[33:01] intended that we could raise up a little
[33:04] bit higher see and see that if we are to
[33:07] be stripped then we can't turn to nobody
[33:10] in the world amen amen we can only turn
[33:13] to
[33:14] him and that he he's our need see and
[33:18] then we can finally realize through
[33:20] sickness sorrow trial
[33:23] tribulation Lord Thou Art the one my
[33:27] Lord and my God
[33:28] when we finally reach that place you
[33:31] watch the third pull then because we
[33:34] he's going to walk with us he's going to
[33:36] talk with us he's going to feed us he's
[33:38] going to lead us right on out of here
[33:40] amen but he's got to get us to a place
[33:43] where service or or the inner experience
[33:46] or any of these things means nothing
[33:49] seeing God is the purpose of life
[33:51] Hallelujah that's what he's trying to
[33:52] get us to and I hope this morning you
[33:54] can understand it therefore the Lord
[33:57] Jesus is always seen Through The Eyes of
[34:01] need if we acknowledge that we are
[34:03] nothing and we really need him and
[34:06] confess our sins then he's ready and
[34:09] willing to forgive see but we must be
[34:12] needy people that's the way he's made
[34:14] known we're weaklands and we're Sinners
[34:18] the Holy Spirit Delights to show us the
[34:20] heart of the Lord Jesus as the supply of
[34:23] our needs if we're willing to come to
[34:26] the Lord amen
[34:28] amen then seeing Jesus as all we need as
[34:32] the soul believingly appropriates the
[34:34] word for itself and then there's no more
[34:37] striving there's no more strength we
[34:39] really see that Jesus is the one these
[34:42] are young people here they're seen it
[34:44] now and they have given up of families
[34:47] they don't care about jobs or nothing
[34:49] they ought to have a Revival now seeing
[34:52] Jesus as their need they tried dope they
[34:54] tried sex they tried everything
[34:57] conceivable
[34:58] and it did not satisfy cuz it can't amen
[35:01] only God can satisfy amen and to think
[35:04] that we are elected to fill that man
[35:08] blank space in God's heart the bride is
[35:11] think on these things friends this
[35:13] morning
[35:15] amen praise our God Hallelujah Jesus is
[35:19] all we need he's everything that's right
[35:23] we don't need anything else outside of
[35:25] Jesus Christ if we could ever for get
[35:28] that vision of Christ being our need
[35:31] God's glory 2 Corinthians 4:6 God's
[35:35] glory shines in the face of Jesus Christ
[35:38] as we look into that face there shines
[35:41] in our hearts the light of the knowledge
[35:43] of the glory of God which we can see
[35:46] nowhere else nowhere else will you see
[35:49] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[35:51] of God outside of the face of Jesus
[35:53] Christ don't look for hidden things
[35:56] don't look for secret you think that the
[35:58] Lord will only come down and tell you
[35:59] something in a great experience uhuh
[36:02] don't look for them things look for
[36:03] Jesus Christ for God himself said to
[36:06] confine yourself for he has manifested
[36:09] himself in Jesus Christ there therefore
[36:12] there's nowhere else to look in him God
[36:14] has said you'll find that I am what I
[36:17] am in him you'll find that all that you
[36:20] need what I require of you is in Christ
[36:23] amen and you go to him and you find out
[36:25] what I require and what you need is in
[36:28] Jesus Christ nowhere else neither in
[36:31] Heaven Nor in the earth can you find it
[36:33] outside of in Jesus Christ he's the
[36:36] one now what exactly is it that we see
[36:39] when we look into the face of Jesus
[36:41] Christ we see not only the light of the
[36:43] knowledge of God but also the Light of
[36:46] the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[36:48] face of Jesus Christ now watch the face
[36:50] of Christ is what makes God glorious his
[36:54] face the glory of God shines in Jesus
[36:56] Christ's face
[36:58] now watch his face then reveals the
[37:00] glory of God but it's a marred face is
[37:03] that right spat upon and disfigured by
[37:06] the malice of men think on it now it's
[37:10] getting a little deep
[37:12] now come can read the
[37:15] scripture relax friends Jesus Christ
[37:18] loves you you're very tight this
[37:22] morning as many as were astonished at
[37:25] thee his Visage was was so marred more
[37:29] than any man in his form more than the
[37:31] sons of man this Christ and I have a a
[37:35] translation here his Visage was marred
[37:38] so that it was no longer that of a man
[37:41] so great was his def
[37:43] figment can you imagine that now it was
[37:46] so marred so
[37:49] Twisted by the sons of men that it was
[37:52] it no longer looked like a
[37:54] man and this was uh the glory of God in
[37:57] his face God's glory was in the face of
[38:00] Jesus
[38:01] Christ then uh this vision of glory to
[38:05] the Natural man this is shame and
[38:07] disgrace this this is not glory for the
[38:09] natural man glory to him is to be the a
[38:12] president of of of General motives or
[38:14] something or a big shot a big man over
[38:17] people that's because to be exalted
[38:20] that's his glory that's his idea of
[38:22] Glory but that is not because Christ in
[38:24] Christ it is the a reverse now watch
[38:28] not so much in his ability to exalt
[38:31] himself and humble man but in his
[38:33] willingness to Humble himself for the
[38:36] sake of man see not so much in in a
[38:39] mighty Display of Power that would break
[38:41] in pieces those who would oppose him but
[38:44] rather in the hiding of that power and
[38:46] the showing of grace to the undeserving
[38:49] see when they turn to him in Repentance
[38:52] I got something I want to read to you
[38:55] Moses said Exodus
[38:58] 33 I read it you write it down Exodus
[39:01] 3318 and 19 Moses said and he said I
[39:05] beseech thee show me thy mercy I mean
[39:08] show me thy glory and he said I will
[39:11] make all my goodness pass before thee
[39:14] and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[39:16] before thee and will be gracious to whom
[39:19] I will be gracious and will show Mercy
[39:21] on whom I will show Mercy now catch it
[39:24] here Moses said I beseech show me thy
[39:28] glory and God said back I will make my
[39:31] goodness pass before thee so therefore
[39:33] God's glory is his goodness and goodness
[39:36] means Grace so therefore God's glory is
[39:40] his grace amen praise the Lord therefore
[39:43] he said I will not make my power nor my
[39:46] Majesty nor my Holiness pass before thee
[39:49] but I'll make my goodness pass before
[39:51] you because you're weak cuz you're
[39:53] Sinners cuz you can't help yourself
[39:55] therefore I'll pass before
[39:57] in Grace in Grace in Grace in grace are
[40:02] you catching
[40:03] friends there's his glory in showing his
[40:07] goodness his grace he was showing his
[40:09] glory Ephesians
[40:12] 1:6 let read this scripture here God
[40:15] help us to get a vision of Jesus Christ
[40:17] Hallelujah and then you'll see a people
[40:19] brother that'll set this church on fire
[40:21] for God to the praise of the glory of
[40:24] his grace wherein he hath made us except
[40:27] accepted in the Beloved to the praise of
[40:29] the glory of his grace it is this that
[40:32] makes the Angels hide their faces and
[40:34] bow down at the grace of God praise our
[40:38] God the Angels inquire to desire to look
[40:41] into this what is this all about here
[40:43] see praise God and he said over here in
[40:46] the same uh Exodus over
[40:48] here I want to talk about Jehovah and
[40:51] those seven compound names there a
[40:54] minute uh Exodus 346 and 7 the glory of
[40:58] God and the Lord and the Lord descended
[41:00] in the cloud and stood with him there
[41:02] and proclaimed the name of the Lord and
[41:04] the Lord pass by before him and proclaim
[41:06] the Lord the Lord God merciful and
[41:09] gracious longsuffering and abundant in
[41:11] goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for
[41:13] thousand of forgiven iniquity and
[41:15] transgression in sin and that will by no
[41:17] means clear the guilty visiting the
[41:19] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[41:20] children upon the children's children
[41:21] unto the third and the fourth generation
[41:24] there he was when he passed by he showed
[41:25] him Grace and that was his glory praise
[41:29] God when Jesus Christ was ready to go up
[41:32] in St John 12 he said mine hour is not
[41:35] come yet now God's glory we go from
[41:38] glory to glory we go from justification
[41:41] Glory sanctification Glory baptism of
[41:45] the Holy Ghost glory to the fullness of
[41:47] the word glory and we're sitting now in
[41:49] his glory and his grace Hallelujah for
[41:51] he has showed us this great salvation it
[41:54] is in Jesus Christ son of man being
[41:55] revealed through a prophetic message
[41:57] and here we sit in Grace this morning in
[42:00] glory Jesus Christ said mine hour is not
[42:02] come yet other words he was saying Glory
[42:07] not lifted up on the throne but on a
[42:10] cross other words he was ready to be
[42:12] glorified but not to sit on a throne to
[42:15] to be lifted up on a cross and there he
[42:18] was glorified on the
[42:20] cross praise God as a public spectacle
[42:23] of Shame for rebellious man that we
[42:26] might repent and come back to him this
[42:29] is the hour of my glory for it is the
[42:31] hour of Grace to Sinners so the grace
[42:35] was the glory upon the
[42:37] cross There Was His glory in Jesus we
[42:40] see that God's highest Glory consists in
[42:42] his of securing our deepest happiness
[42:45] and if I if I be lifted up I will reveal
[42:48] my glory my grace to thee if I be lifted
[42:51] up and die for you there's my glory for
[42:53] you there's my grace to you amen that
[42:56] you might come back there's a revelation
[42:58] of God and with that kind of Revelation
[43:01] that he was lifted up for us it should
[43:03] be so easy to walk in this door and sit
[43:06] down in here and don't get mad when the
[43:08] minister is preaching something you
[43:09] think is hard or rough or something for
[43:12] God's only trying to reveal his glory
[43:14] for the face of Jesus Christ has been
[43:16] shining here in the past eight years
[43:18] here through a message Hallelujah and
[43:21] generously hearing is love that you obey
[43:24] the Commandments of God so if you love
[43:26] God you will want to yearn and burn to
[43:30] desire to obey his Commandments amen and
[43:34] we see God in the face of Jesus Christ
[43:35] shining down upon us in love and power
[43:38] and Beauty but the world didn't see
[43:40] anything in him he's calling he's
[43:42] yearning and bring us back to at first
[43:44] love friends to restore us
[43:46] back that he might have the
[43:50] preeminence and as Micah 68 says he has
[43:53] showed the old man what is good and what
[43:55] do the Lord require the humble thyself
[43:57] to walk with God love God with all your
[43:59] heart soul and your mind friends here we
[44:02] are in this last hour here now in Jesus
[44:06] Christ um he we see him as our
[44:10] need now in the Old Testament brother
[44:13] Bram taught us he had a great experience
[44:16] 1950s that one day out squirrel hunting
[44:19] that the Lord came down and told him
[44:22] stand up and spoke to him and said that
[44:24] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[44:27] the New Testament now now let's go back
[44:31] God appeared to uh Abraham I mean Moses
[44:35] and told him I am he said what is your
[44:38] name and called him forth in the the de
[44:41] burning py he said my name is I am well
[44:44] the the people ask me what is your name
[44:46] what should I tell them tell them I am
[44:48] that I am now I am that I am is is not
[44:52] complete there's there is because No
[44:56] Object there I am I cuz I am what but
[44:59] when you get a revelation of a personal
[45:02] Jehovah as I am I am what you
[45:06] need amen then it's Jehovah I
[45:09] am the Lord thy God Is Thy
[45:13] sacrifice I am thy banner I am th
[45:16] because a comforter healer or whatever I
[45:19] am amen but until you catch the
[45:22] Revelation I am that I
[45:25] am amen
[45:28] seven compound names a Jehovah RI ni and
[45:32] so for because a Jehovah because a
[45:35] Shalom one time I think it was a Gideon
[45:38] there and when he found who he was he
[45:40] called him a Jehovah
[45:43] Shalom peace amen seven compound names
[45:47] now watch God had revealed himself to uh
[45:51] Abraham Jacob and Isaac as the almighty
[45:54] God the nourisher to give him strength
[45:56] to come down to the fourth age where he
[45:58] can reveal himself as Jehovah I am and
[46:02] Jesus Christ told those Pharisees I am
[46:06] before Abraham was I am hallelujah amen
[46:10] and except you believe that I am you'll
[46:12] die in your sins here was Jesus Christ
[46:16] Hallelujah catch me is when we have a
[46:19] need we only see God in our need and God
[46:23] because he made a covenant with
[46:26] Abraham's people people he said I will
[46:28] come down when the iniquity has come up
[46:32] and he come down cuz I hear the crying
[46:35] of my people why wasn't they had a need
[46:39] amen they were being oppressed they were
[46:41] being beaten down by because pharaoh and
[46:43] his army so that because Israel had a
[46:46] need and he had already strengthened uh
[46:49] Abraham Isaac and Jacob now was a time
[46:53] to reveal this personal God as Jehovah I
[46:57] am that I am and then when they begin to
[46:59] see this was the Jehovah of power amen
[47:03] the Jehovah of Salvation the Jehovah who
[47:07] will lead them and guide them and take
[47:09] them out that is the same Jehovah well
[47:12] therefore this Jehovah was found in the
[47:14] Old Testament when they had a need is
[47:17] that right then he had seven compound
[47:20] names all in needs righteousness and so
[47:23] forth but then when it come to Salvation
[47:25] for sinners
[47:27] amen he come in the name Jesus amen then
[47:30] Jesus is the Supreme compound name Jesus
[47:34] Christ and then is in Christ and Christ
[47:37] is I am that I am for he told William
[47:40] Bram the
[47:41] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[47:44] Jesus of the New Testament amen so then
[47:47] when we have a need he's all we need
[47:50] Jesus Christ and in him we find all that
[47:54] we need but we must get to a place where
[47:58] we are surrendered where we really need
[48:00] him then he will appear to you and tell
[48:03] you I am that I am what is your need
[48:06] amen amen this is the same Jehovah
[48:09] Jehovah they even took the J uh h o v ah
[48:14] which is a a Hebrew word and jahash is
[48:19] also a Hebrew word but the word Jesus is
[48:22] a Greek word so the same Jehovah jashua
[48:26] way is the same Jesus in Greek amen and
[48:29] they took the first part of it j e which
[48:32] means a Jehovah and the SS is salvation
[48:36] amen Jehovah is our Salvation which is
[48:39] Jesus amen so that's why looking for the
[48:42] Blessed hope the Glorious appearing of
[48:45] our great god Jehovah and our Savior
[48:48] Jesus Christ praise God which is the
[48:51] great Jehovah he is the same savior in
[48:54] Jesus Christ and if we look to him
[48:56] friends
[48:57] he is our need therefore whatever Israel
[49:01] had need of Jehovah met it with power is
[49:05] that right and he let him out amen and
[49:08] therefore Jesus Christ even told his
[49:10] disciples in St John 16 you have not ask
[49:13] anything of me because in my name but
[49:16] henceforth you shall ask in my name amen
[49:19] cuz you're going to have a need and I'm
[49:21] the same Jehovah you see me Thomas you
[49:23] see the father I am I was I am before
[49:27] Abraham was praise God Jehovah means um
[49:33] Jehovah means the uh because our
[49:35] eternity and which is present is past
[49:39] present and future is now if if you read
[49:42] a book here like say because reading the
[49:44] book and we the book is about yesterday
[49:48] and also present and what's going to
[49:49] happen in the book and if we come to
[49:51] that book we get right into it present
[49:54] tense whether the events happen yet yest
[49:56] today or whether they going to happen
[49:58] because next day but as you read the
[50:00] book you're in that book amen and as you
[50:03] see God he's present you was with him
[50:06] before and you're going to be with him
[50:09] because down the road and with him now
[50:11] but the Bible says now are we the sons
[50:14] of God right now we are and as far as as
[50:17] the great Jehovah is concerned we are
[50:19] now the sons of God amen amen so
[50:23] therefore we was with him before we're
[50:25] going to be with him over there in glory
[50:26] and we're with him now he can't lose you
[50:29] over there amen he's only waiting for us
[50:33] to come to him when we have the need do
[50:36] you have a need this
[50:37] morning well Jesus of the New Testament
[50:40] is the same Jehovah of the Old Testament
[50:43] Jehovah nii or Jehovah RFI and so forth
[50:46] the same one and when Israel God only
[50:50] revealed himself to Abraham Jacob and
[50:52] Isaac as almighty God the satisfier the
[50:56] uh because a breasted one but when it
[50:59] came time for a power and deliverance he
[51:02] revealed as Jehovah CU they would have a
[51:05] need cuz we cannot save ourselves so the
[51:08] Great Name the personal name of Jehovah
[51:10] was a peculiar because they had a
[51:12] covenant with God but the Gentiles only
[51:15] knew him as God that's all only God all
[51:18] through the Old Testament but in this
[51:21] day the great God has sent his son Jesus
[51:24] Christ the Savior For All Mankind amen
[51:27] and there's God's grace so therefore God
[51:29] has revealed himself to us as the grace
[51:30] of God the Savior Jesus Christ and this
[51:33] is the Supreme compound name Jesus
[51:37] Christ which is a Jehovah Savior Jesus
[51:40] Christ do you love him friends amen
[51:43] praise our God so then we um seeing God
[51:48] the purpose of this life seeing God in
[51:50] the face of Jesus Christ that face was
[51:53] marred and twisted but that face had the
[51:56] glory of God in it and that's why in our
[51:58] sufferings and so forth God gets the
[52:02] glory out of it amen praise the lord
[52:06] well we know that this is the way um God
[52:09] would bring us through many strange ways
[52:11] and so forth we know that something is
[52:15] fixing to happen we all know that but uh
[52:19] the Holy Spirit I believe is trying to
[52:21] get us to a place to raise
[52:24] up move up one octave High higher and
[52:28] come away from the things of the world
[52:30] there are those in here that have walked
[52:32] away and you know you have you're not
[52:34] the same as you was in' 63 and 64 and 65
[52:37] there are those who went aside but the
[52:39] Lord Jesus loves you this morning and
[52:42] love he's trying to woo you back to
[52:44] himself trying to bring you back to that
[52:47] first state that we was walking here
[52:49] with the Lord here and that's what he is
[52:52] is trying to do and the Seven compound
[52:55] names have all come in into that one
[52:57] comp Supreme compound named Jesus so
[53:01] therefore if you see God you see him as
[53:03] a need if you really know if really
[53:06] admit because you're needy then you can
[53:08] see God Amen because he reveals himself
[53:11] to those who are needy as Jehovah or
[53:14] Jesus amen amen and he's all that we
[53:18] need s somebody come and play the P
[53:22] let's turn to page
[53:25] 93 I will do you want to see
[53:28] him oh I want to see him praise our
[53:34] God when I think about the things that's
[53:38] going
[53:39] on and um I believe was brother brandham
[53:42] said on page 66 in uh seven Church ages
[53:47] as he studied the scriptures and prayed
[53:49] and waited on God before he went into
[53:52] the church ages the Lord revealed to him
[53:55] a Hebrews 13 8 that that was the
[53:58] Keystone to the Bible Jesus Christ the
[54:02] same yesterday today and forever that is
[54:06] the Keystone and I believe with all my
[54:08] heart that Jesus Christ who is the same
[54:11] yesterday today and forever is looking
[54:13] for people this morning that can really
[54:17] die out to all these things here of the
[54:20] Flesh and the world and deny these
[54:23] things here and really see God never
[54:25] mind service so much see service other
[54:27] words if you can find the answer to life
[54:32] in Christ the word you can be in the
[54:35] most obscure point of this globe and if
[54:38] you got the answer to today's problems
[54:41] the world will be the path to your door
[54:43] to find the answer that's absolutely
[54:46] right if you got it cuz the world came
[54:48] to William bram's door by telephone by
[54:52] because airplane by bus by car they be a
[54:55] path to his door cuz he had it and he
[54:58] had Christ and many times he said
[54:59] because I don't know the scriptures but
[55:01] I know the
[55:03] author amen amen I know the author see
[55:07] so therefore many take the Bible and
[55:09] like in uh because academic because
[55:12] academic way they know so many
[55:13] scriptures and they know this and they
[55:15] know that but do they know the author
[55:18] that's the thing and will and brandom
[55:19] knew the author because he uh desired to
[55:23] fellowship with God forever more God
[55:26] then this morning if as we know that the
[55:29] Dynamics is ready to come down we won't
[55:32] have in our mind that we got to have
[55:34] this great power and so forth many here
[55:37] or many throughout God's Church put more
[55:41] emphasis on Service as long as they in
[55:44] service they can treat their wife or
[55:46] their husband or their friends any kind
[55:48] of way but they're in service uh-uh
[55:51] you'll never see him like that you see
[55:53] him as him being the soul means the soul
[55:56] in so therefore there'll be many in
[55:58] service Lord I cast out Devils I did
[56:01] many wonderful Works Lord I was right in
[56:03] the bride doing all kind of thing he
[56:04] said I don't even know you you see CU
[56:06] you never sought me out so therefore I'm
[56:09] up here because up here preaching this
[56:11] is a gift see this is a because God's
[56:15] Gift up here but I got to se God for
[56:17] myself I must meet the Lord myself and
[56:20] that is my desire to meet him cuz after
[56:23] we we finished here The Works follow
[56:27] see but if you meet Jesus
[56:29] Christ as the only source then they'll
[56:32] come looking for you amen praise God so
[56:35] let us because I remember this here and
[56:38] the young children that are here there's
[56:41] only one thing out here that is Jesus
[56:43] Christ and many of them they don't know
[56:46] that see God hasn't a revealer because
[56:49] to their hearts and we understand that
[56:51] that's why father and mother are to pray
[56:54] and to have their house so Christlike
[56:58] that it'll be such an atmosphere in that
[57:00] home that that young person in there
[57:03] can't walk into any room but seeing
[57:05] Jesus in the home and then you'll see a
[57:08] difference you'll see a change but it's
[57:10] up to Mommy and Daddy that they live
[57:12] this life that they present the token
[57:14] see me now and that they uh have a
[57:17] yearning and a burning because a desire
[57:19] for Jesus Christ but what you have if
[57:22] you have if you come in here at a church
[57:23] and you serve God and here and go home
[57:25] and then uh revert back to Old worldly
[57:28] radio programs and everything else what
[57:30] is your child going to do they're
[57:32] looking at you to see Jesus Christ you
[57:34] see so therefore live friend cuz you
[57:37] can't fool nobody you can walk in here
[57:40] but how are you walking outside of here
[57:43] you see is every uh uh motive every is
[57:46] everything turned because toward Jesus
[57:48] Christ This is a weary hour We're weary
[57:52] we're tired we know that even as
[57:55] president said that the people's Spirits
[57:58] are they are tired they are frustrated
[58:01] and we know that uh uh these people here
[58:03] they are feeling the pull of the spirit
[58:05] we know that Christ is fixing to pour
[58:08] forth the anointing up on the seeds all
[58:10] of us know that see but just make sure
[58:13] that you know what you're looking for if
[58:15] you want to see him praise the
[58:17] Lord you praise His name you know
[58:20] friends when Adam and Eve sent in the
[58:22] Garden of
[58:23] Eden and then when they put on their
[58:26] their man-made thick leaves The Showdown
[58:29] came when the presence of God
[58:32] came they ran away cuz they knew that
[58:36] that couldn't bring them into God's
[58:37] presence and that and that same strain
[58:40] is in man today he knows you know this
[58:43] morning that if certain things are going
[58:46] on that you cannot bring it into God's
[58:48] presence God required blood and it was
[58:51] that Bloody dripping uh lamb skin as
[58:56] Adam began to stand before God the blood
[58:59] from that skin running down his legs
[59:02] that justified Adam to stand in God's
[59:05] presence what I'm trying to bring you
[59:07] this morning by the grace of God is that
[59:10] same presence is coming down
[59:13] again and the little foolishness is and
[59:17] putting God second put your home your
[59:20] job your mothers your fathers your
[59:22] friends you put them before the Lord
[59:24] that will not stand I don't care whether
[59:27] you're a pastor or Elder Deacon or
[59:30] Minister whoever you are that's only
[59:32] service that's service see that should
[59:34] be second but the first motive the first
[59:36] love should be a burning yearning desire
[59:39] for Jesus Christ that's the first one
[59:43] those he said he said fill those that
[59:45] sigh and cry after the Abominations of
[59:49] filthiness in the city in the Church of
[59:52] Jerusalem and therefore uh God he
[59:55] commended the saints of God there in
[59:57] Ephesus because they tried those Liars
[1:00:00] they hated that filth to be in the
[1:00:02] church so therefore those of you in here
[1:00:04] this morning that hate to see your
[1:00:07] sisters that was walking with their
[1:00:09] heart soul and mind in the Lord and all
[1:00:11] of a sudden here in the end time the
[1:00:13] last year or so the devil just take them
[1:00:15] back out in the world you should hate
[1:00:16] that and and because brothers that are
[1:00:19] walking contrary to the Lord I've seen a
[1:00:22] hair that was walking in all that the
[1:00:24] new how and maybe it was some old a
[1:00:27] carnal worldly woman outside or
[1:00:29] something somebody who's an unbeliever
[1:00:30] or something if that has pulled you away

[1:00:47] exalt you this is what I'm standing up
[1:00:49] here for trying to bring a message of

[1:00:59] Fellowship that he had with Adam there's
