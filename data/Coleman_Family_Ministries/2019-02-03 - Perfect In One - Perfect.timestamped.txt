[0:00] so this morning let us turn to st. John
[0:03] 17 and want to read the 23 verses there
[0:07] in the 17th chapter you pray for me
[0:10] and let us pray one for the other and
[0:13] let us pray for this precious brother
[0:14] here that the Holy Spirit would just
[0:17] touch that dumb spirit he is he can't
[0:21] hear that that because hearing devil
[0:23] there that has blocked up his hearing
[0:24] and and that that he could hear the Word
[0:27] of God Saint John 17 these words spake
[0:31] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[0:35] and said father the hour is come glorify
[0:38] thy son that thy son also may glorify
[0:42] thee as thou has given him power over
[0:45] all flesh that he should give eternal
[0:48] life to as many as thou has given him
[0:54] that's all and this is life eternal that
[0:58] they might know thee the only true God
[1:01] and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent and
[1:04] this God is the word I have glorified
[1:07] thee on the earth I have finished at
[1:10] work which thou has which thou gave us
[1:12] me to do and now father glorify thou me
[1:15] with thine own self with the glory which
[1:18] I had with thee before the world was I
[1:20] have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:23] which thou gave us me out of the world 9
[1:27] they were and thou gave us their mean
[1:30] and they have kept thy work that's the
[1:35] testimony there they have kept the word
[1:37] if we can only say that amen
[1:40] now they have known that all things
[1:43] whatsoever thou has given me are of thee
[1:47] for they checked it in the worst hey man
[1:49] the seventy went away though but they
[1:52] stayed with that word amen for I have
[1:55] given unto them the words they were just
[1:57] right there
[1:58] the words which thou gave us me and they
[2:01] have received them like we are doing
[2:04] right now the whole message and have
[2:07] known Shirley and the only way that we
[2:10] know is when a false Christ comes
[2:11] against it
[2:12] and it doesn't sound just right yeah
[2:15] then we know that that wasn't a words
[2:17] that God's prophet gave out it's a
[2:19] little bit different
[2:20] amen surely that I came out from thee
[2:22] and they have believed that thou did it
[2:25] send me and I pray for them I pray not
[2:30] for the world for these people out in
[2:32] the world see you me and it's world
[2:34] system out here in this world church
[2:36] system you know what I mean because the
[2:39] nominations and so forth see but for
[2:42] them which thou has given me his people
[2:45] in the system see for they are thine and
[2:49] all minor burn and dying are mine and I
[2:52] am glorified and them and now I am no
[2:56] more in the world but these are in the
[2:58] world and I come to thee Holy Father
[3:01] keep through thine own name those whom
[3:05] thou has given me that they may be one
[3:08] as we are while I was with them in the
[3:11] world I kept them in thy name those that
[3:15] thou gave us me I have kept in none of
[3:18] them is lost but the son of perdition
[3:20] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[3:22] and now come I to thee and these things
[3:26] I speak in the world that they might
[3:28] have my joy fulfill in themselves I have
[3:32] given them thy word and the world hath
[3:35] hated them excuse me
[3:38] because they are not of the world now
[3:40] you see why you have your trials you're
[3:41] not of this world here the world hates
[3:43] you
[3:44] even as I am NOT of the world I pray not
[3:47] that that thou should has taken out of
[3:49] the world but that thou sure does keep
[3:51] them from the evil they are not of the
[3:54] world even as I am NOT of the world
[3:56] sanctify them through thy truth thy Word
[3:59] is truth sanctify me to set you apart
[4:02] for God only set you apart from
[4:05] everything here and as thou has sent me
[4:08] into the world even so I also sent them
[4:13] into the world who sent us here amen he
[4:16] sent us in free zone we are not from
[4:18] here friends he sent us here and if we
[4:22] come from him we must have the Word of
[4:24] God
[4:25] man we must show the word of God amen by
[4:28] living the Word of God Danny we know
[4:30] that we come from him amen and for their
[4:33] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[4:36] might be sanctified through the truth
[4:38] Christ could have had a wife and all of
[4:41] these things but he set himself apart
[4:44] from these things that he might set
[4:46] himself apart for us then how much more
[4:49] can we set ourselves apart from this
[4:51] filthy world out here amen
[4:53] to set ourselves apart from the world
[4:55] and everything out here every ungodly
[4:57] thing on here and put ourselves right
[4:59] here on God's altar and Lord thy will be
[5:02] done
[5:03] amen and then they said that you're
[5:06] crazy because you have that oneness with
[5:09] God that that desire to be one with our
[5:13] maker Amen praise our God neither pray I
[5:18] for these alone there it is this is us
[5:21] right here but for them also which shall
[5:25] believe on me through their word Peter's
[5:28] worried Paul's word John's word we're
[5:31] here because we believed on the word
[5:33] here that they wrote and they say man
[5:36] wrote the Bible he sure did because he
[5:38] said that man would write the Bible but
[5:40] we are for those who will believe what
[5:42] these mineral and they were moved by the
[5:44] Holy Ghost amen
[5:46] he's come for us praise God that they
[5:49] all may be one as thou father art in me
[5:54] and I in thee that they also may be one
[5:57] in us that the world may believe that
[5:59] thou has sent me there's a reason and
[6:03] the glory which thou gave us me I have
[6:06] given them that they may be one even as
[6:09] we are one I am them now in me that they
[6:14] may be made perfect in one that the
[6:17] world may know that thou has sent me and
[6:19] and has loved them as thou hast loved me
[6:23] and I want to read Hebrews the tenth
[6:26] chapter the 24th and 25th verse I've
[6:34] already friends so preaching already
[6:36] and let us consider one another to
[6:40] provoke unto love and to good works not
[6:43] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[6:45] together as the manner of some is some
[6:50] who do not want to come together wear
[6:53] this for live preaching maybe just old
[6:55] dead tape amen some don't even show up
[6:59] because it was only a tape see as the
[7:02] manner of some is amen let it sink in
[7:07] there now praise God
[7:08] but exhorting one another and so much
[7:11] the more much more each day as we see
[7:15] that Day approaching
[7:17] may God a blessing to the reading of his
[7:18] word I like to take a little a thought
[7:21] here perfect in one made a lot of
[7:26] blessing the reading of his word and I
[7:29] have a little a prayer request here
[7:31] since the freedom on roll a request at
[7:35] the congregation pray that the Lord will
[7:37] strengthen her she is weak due to her
[7:40] condition she also desires fellowship
[7:43] you know and another one please pray to
[7:47] continue please continue to pray for
[7:49] brother Ted Beulah it it is condition
[7:53] his condition has has improved greatly
[7:56] however he has excessive fluid in his
[8:00] body and needs the deliverance from this
[8:03] condition so let us continue to pray for
[8:06] these precious people and also pray for
[8:08] brother Shepherd he's to see the doctor
[8:11] Monday and also next Thursday for
[8:13] another operation well friends here we
[8:17] are today and we all are wondering what
[8:21] is going on amen and we see the world's
[8:25] conditions and it's not getting any
[8:28] better they're getting worse day by day
[8:31] and yet in all of this it seems mighty
[8:34] strange it seems like the Lord is just
[8:37] not going to come see but he has a
[8:41] purpose and what he's doing
[8:43] and he is never late and he's always on
[8:47] time
[8:47] well see he has to work out of us his
[8:51] will and also his purpose and so doing
[8:56] and just like this place here God I
[8:59] believe God has not given us this place
[9:02] of worship here in vain I mean you would
[9:05] have to be stupid to understand that he
[9:08] would give you a place then let it be
[9:11] like the collide they're gonna take it
[9:13] away from you
[9:14] their countdown positively and give it
[9:16] to you again what for just to come here
[9:19] any old kind of slips a lot away or what
[9:21] or is it for or an eternal purpose of
[9:24] God that God had in his mind before the
[9:27] foundation of the world no matter
[9:30] whether nobody believed it at all it
[9:33] makes no difference for with their
[9:36] unbelief it does not make the word of
[9:38] that of none effect that is gone and we
[9:41] without God we are nothing amen it's
[9:44] just two people sitting here on God's
[9:48] crown of fellowship you know it with the
[9:51] make of heaven fellowship with God God
[9:54] will meet that person on the grounds of
[9:57] his word Amen that's right
[10:00] and we ought to so live this life it is
[10:03] to mix sinners and all who are weary out
[10:06] they Tamarians exploding on them make
[10:08] them jealous make them water because
[10:11] thirst after God but they got to see
[10:13] something from us and if you only come
[10:16] through the Word of God to being
[10:18] consecrated one with the Lord Amen so I
[10:22] believe that I believe that he has a
[10:25] purpose because for us here in New York
[10:27] City here as as individuals for he deals
[10:31] with us as individuals but also I
[10:34] believe that he has a purpose for us as
[10:37] a group also I believe that for I see
[10:41] his signs all around and he has anointed
[10:43] my eyes to see them and that black amen
[10:46] now I can see
[10:47] praise God before I was blind
[10:49] now I can see amen so therefore we see
[10:52] then that we should know what we are
[10:56] doing why we are coming here we're not
[11:01] just Connie are we just come in to come
[11:03] every Sunday to sit here and wimzie just
[11:07] full form and fashion but do we have a
[11:10] revelation
[11:11] do we have understanding or do we have
[11:21] uh some kind of a slip slide away what
[11:23] is a tape tonight well maybe this is a
[11:26] cupboard Joe he's gonna preach tonight
[11:28] or do we have something constraint is in
[11:31] our hearts to want to be with one
[11:33] another whether we just say one word and
[11:35] just go home or not if we just have
[11:38] prayer if we can just shake one
[11:41] another's hands do we have that inside
[11:43] of us what are we coming for tea amen
[11:46] praise our God yes sir
[11:48] so we see what is God doing we have to
[11:52] know what he's doing so we can be
[11:54] blessed so we can understand what he's
[11:56] doing then we when we can see the hand
[11:59] of the Lord revealed amen then we can
[12:02] shout and also praise God before we see
[12:05] it but you just can't stay up the body
[12:07] you just see it and you just can't say
[12:10] anything at all you just know that is
[12:12] something amen
[12:13] but that's at faith before he drops his
[12:16] supernatural faith into our hearts to
[12:18] let us know something is going on
[12:20] I believe therefore just what is God
[12:23] doing here I believe that he is
[12:26] preparing of people to bear his name
[12:30] his name is his person I'm Joseph
[12:34] Coleman you know by my own character and
[12:37] also by my own ways Who I am then we
[12:40] know Christ's character is laid out in
[12:42] the Bible here who is
[12:46] he has called us to this calling to bear
[12:50] his name
[12:51] Amen to speak his words to live his life
[12:56] God has called us here for that and if
[12:59] so dude he has blessed us giving us a
[13:02] place here with his anointing settles
[13:04] down in here where the word is preached
[13:06] his tapes of play whatever it is makes
[13:12] no difference still the Word of God
[13:14] therefore when we can see that why is he
[13:18] doing that he's going to hell if his -
[13:20] he's going to have a people who will
[13:22] bear his name who will be after that
[13:25] priestly order Amen sons of God who they
[13:31] are
[13:31] whoever it is standing at a man he's
[13:33] going to have that friends yes he is
[13:36] praise God he's going to have these
[13:38] people to be united with Christ to be
[13:41] perfect in one with God and Christ now
[13:45] he is perfecting right now a virgin
[13:50] church and soon as the scripture of
[13:53] first Corinthians 13 when he was just
[13:56] perfect just come that which which is in
[13:58] part shall be done away with immediately
[14:01] when the prophet left has seen the false
[14:03] Christ come he was just perfect is here
[14:06] we don't have to pray no more we don't
[14:08] have to worship no more we'll need
[14:10] because there are no more ministers will
[14:12] need no more anything when he which is
[14:15] perfect is the way to bring the whole
[14:16] word he'll deceive daddy how deceit are
[14:20] you can you imagine that the perfect way
[14:24] to God to bring the whole Bible here now
[14:26] and when it comes then some rise up and
[14:29] say that you don't need this unit and
[14:31] you don't need that there are disease
[14:33] when the word come himself to anoint
[14:36] every word anoint every word from
[14:40] Genesis clean through the Bible
[14:45] don't you take one word don't you add
[14:49] one word to what he has already spoken
[14:52] and yet they go on adding and taking
[14:55] away right before your eyes
[14:57] going out what is it the deaf angel
[15:00] coming down take it out the
[15:02] uncircumcised right before you Wow for
[15:06] there's no blood over the door they
[15:07] don't even know what the word is for
[15:09] they take away from the Word of God and
[15:11] the Death Angel comes right down and
[15:13] just takes them away and but you deal
[15:16] licked at once you keep right on going
[15:18] when the pillar of fire goes up you move
[15:21] out we are places we are make mistakes
[15:37] show me will we will keep on making
[15:38] mistakes until that perfect one that
[15:41] cell up on God's prophet tell us on you
[15:45] amen
[15:46] that's different in but right now we
[15:48] still make mistakes well as long as
[15:51] we're in God's ladder duty he will bless
[15:54] us for any others who will curse you
[15:58] he'll like Balaam to see that blood
[16:01] atonement hang in their graves outcome
[16:03] they fail to see it they say well that
[16:06] person in he ain't caught for this and
[16:08] he caught and she's this and also
[16:10] because she's that but there's a blood
[16:12] atonement hanging there for each elected
[16:15] seat of God there's a bathroom in heaven
[16:17] now if the seed of God remains and you
[16:20] cannot commit Salem amen
[16:23] any woman any man any child that has
[16:26] taken their portion of the Word of God
[16:27] though you make mistakes God will bless
[16:30] you
[16:31] you just try God I don't see if he won't
[16:33] bless you yes he will Prince he's sure
[16:36] will amen
[16:38] so what are we doing now he's a
[16:40] perfecting a bride that knows nothing of
[16:44] man thanks be to God for he gave our
[16:48] ministry he gave up the Spirit of Christ
[16:51] for the work of one ministry just one
[16:56] ministry missed
[16:56] Christ and God's prophet had that
[16:59] Ministry of Christ then there because
[17:02] there are also others who bring the word
[17:04] that word not them
[17:06] the word does perfect the breath maybe
[17:09] one here one over there but is got to be
[17:11] for a witness for this is the word age
[17:14] it must be somewhere in the world it's
[17:16] got to be somewhere in the world so we
[17:18] see then that he is perfecting a bride
[17:21] who knows nothing of man those who have
[17:24] not listened to the scribes Pharisees
[17:27] under shepherds the conniving Shepherds
[17:30] those who have not listened to their
[17:33] foolishness see because when the serpent
[17:37] beguiled Eve he gave her wisdom and
[17:41] because she went off because the serpent
[17:45] presented it that way she was deceived
[17:49] see now this church here the prophet of
[17:54] God brought the message we just listened
[17:56] to him amen
[17:58] he were not the same then here they come
[18:01] presenting it that way in that light
[18:05] then if you go to it God has God's
[18:09] probably have already spoken five things
[18:11] you must not do we misplaced aware that
[18:14] got pretty over there put over there
[18:16] that right don't do it so say Moses so
[18:19] say I that right
[18:21] it's all on tapes there then along come
[18:24] the false Christ anointing with the
[18:25] Serpent's spirit upon him and say well
[18:28] he a God has said hey brother Brennan
[18:30] means this here yeah he means this here
[18:32] so when is presenting that light that
[18:35] person hangs between death and life
[18:38] right there and if that anointing gets
[18:41] up on them then if they will yeah well
[18:43] maybe that is right that's wisdom
[18:45] there's a better way than what has
[18:47] already been laid out
[18:48] are you following friends therefore then
[18:51] they're going for a better way than what
[18:54] has already been spoken now what
[18:57] happened in spoken will always be very
[18:59] simple it would be too simple they'll
[19:02] stumble right on top of it it'll be so
[19:04] humble so simple and it was so simple to
[19:07] coverage on his own
[19:09] samples didn't know him Jesus said so
[19:11] all right
[19:12] when heaven kissed earth and Jesus took
[19:15] up the three which is up front pick up
[19:16] on the mountain up there and they saw
[19:18] Moses and also allowed you the
[19:21] resurrections living and also dead
[19:23] DiPaola God they hate him so forth
[19:27] manifested son and then there was still
[19:29] some disciples hanging there who said
[19:31] what but wait a minute resurrection is
[19:34] going on but why say it the scribes then
[19:37] he last his first got to come he's
[19:39] already come and you didn't know it see
[19:43] so therefore I am being diligent that
[19:48] what has transpired from 63 through 65
[19:51] that I will not deny it
[19:53] that's it what I've seen is it no matter
[19:56] how many Devils come against it I've
[19:58] seen God in fish he's made Malachi 4
[20:03] live already God in fishes the third
[20:07] Pole is God speaking through human lips
[20:09] I've have already seen it already seeing
[20:13] it yes I know he said when he says when
[20:16] that press comes down watch that third
[20:18] pole but who is it for he died for who
[20:21] he died for you he poured his seed in
[20:24] you but it might be because maturity
[20:27] rapping so when that press come down
[20:30] what's that bride that's that
[20:32] supernatural bride moved in with God
[20:34] speaking right through their lips right
[20:36] there
[20:36] this is his promises friend we've seen
[20:39] all of these things and yet man goes on
[20:41] and these false Christ's and so forth
[20:43] feeding these poor people or the the
[20:47] chaff of weak and conflicting because
[20:50] foolishness because of me and so
[20:53] therefore may human opinions man's ideas
[20:56] which means nothing yay let every man be
[20:59] a liar in God's Word be trophies amen
[21:03] then these perfected ones will be a
[21:07] supernatural bride designed only by the
[21:12] word that's all nothing else Moses went
[21:15] up to the Mount there right friends to
[21:18] get the pattern there was nobody else
[21:21] there
[21:23] then nobody else knew what Moses what
[21:25] God said to Moses nobody else knew what
[21:29] Moses meant but God is that right and he
[21:31] whom he shall reveal it to that's all
[21:34] then he brought that pattern down and
[21:36] it's laid out here back in old Bible
[21:39] here another prophet of God went up and
[21:41] got a sword also and come down with it
[21:43] amen and laid it out for us that right
[21:46] friends and nobody else was there but
[21:48] him and God and then nobody else knows
[21:51] what God said to him only what is on the
[21:53] tape that's all you know and then only
[21:57] what God shall reveal was on there to
[21:59] you and then when it's revealed it
[22:02] better end up with the Word of God
[22:04] it better be out of context miss yes it
[22:09] shall be the word what is it in season
[22:11] is it in season that's the thing see
[22:14] so therefore this perfected bride she
[22:18] will be a supernatural bride designed by
[22:20] God she'll have a pure spirit pure
[22:23] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[22:26] shall see God
[22:27] just pure even as we appear and all over
[22:31] impregnate with the Holy Ghost and
[22:33] there's something friends the spoken
[22:36] word church of God it must be an
[22:39] anointed church to bear the name of
[22:41] Jesus Christ must be anointed now watch
[22:45] this the election and preparation of
[22:48] this bride is to be after a secret and
[22:52] also hidden manner the Bible says so
[22:54] because when you open the Seventh Seal
[22:57] silence nothing so you won't know the
[23:00] third plane you won't know it you won't
[23:03] know what it is it won't be explained
[23:05] and God told the Prophet he says don't
[23:09] tell nobody
[23:11] now this is what he said nobody knows
[23:15] nothing about the third Pole
[23:17] take the secret of it in your bosom to
[23:21] the grave cetera
[23:23] then first I can see that nobody knows
[23:26] nothing about it only what God shall
[23:28] reveal as you keep moving day by day
[23:31] then nobody can run off nowhere with
[23:33] nothing because he hasn't terrible buddy
[23:36] nothing amen
[23:38] I mean a few scribes and also Pharisees
[23:41] who think they know what it is but they
[23:43] don't c4 is our revelation straight from
[23:47] the throne now watch what he does in the
[23:51] early stage in the secret and also
[23:53] hidden manner
[23:54] David is to type amen and David was a
[23:58] little ruddy boy God found him out on
[24:01] the desert that right with the Sheep but
[24:04] then God called him and all selected him
[24:07] and annoying him by who by the prophet
[24:10] of the Lord and God also called you
[24:13] elect a Jew and also anointed you with
[24:15] the word by whom by God's prophets amen
[24:19] and then with that once that happens you
[24:22] got to go through not come up to and say
[24:26] I don't want to go through it but go
[24:27] through fiery trials amen and then when
[24:30] we see the ferry Charles coming rejects
[24:33] for God has deliberately put it there
[24:36] for you so he can go through with you
[24:41] standing in the fire he's in there but
[24:44] take the step in there and when you go
[24:47] down up into the child the fire burns
[24:50] off the cords and you're set free amen
[24:54] not one hair on your hair even even
[24:59] smell the fire all right D clothes was
[25:02] even touched nothing on you can you lose
[25:05] how he is in every trial he's there he
[25:09] said so amen
[25:10] so then why God was doing a secret work
[25:13] a hidden work see just like David he
[25:17] does that until you're fully grown yeah
[25:20] amen then he presented David to the
[25:23] outside because a professing Church and
[25:27] he met them out there and it was afraid
[25:29] because Saul in a month did that right
[25:31] and now he come and he also met the
[25:33] church there he met because because
[25:36] Goliath and
[25:37] Philistines amen and so are we
[25:40] to meet Satan and these two hundred
[25:42] thousand thousand demons out there and
[25:44] the professing church but after God has
[25:48] done a secret and hidden work which is
[25:51] doing right now in our hearts that's
[25:53] what he's doing right now but it seemed
[25:56] like it because I guess nothing he said
[25:58] to be a strange work the restrooms are
[26:00] short quick powerful work is strange we
[26:03] won't understand code we have not been
[26:05] this way before so if we have not been
[26:08] this way before as in tape how could
[26:11] anybody run out of here that this is it
[26:13] here when we haven't been there way
[26:14] before the Bible says so amen
[26:17] so we see their friends that when the
[26:20] seventh seal was broke see there had to
[26:23] be silenced because he had to do this
[26:27] work hidden because away from all prying
[26:30] eyes to look in to see what he's doing
[26:32] yeah when because Aaron went behind that
[26:36] veil nobody went back there with him
[26:38] that all right
[26:39] see nobody see okay God is doing his
[26:43] work now he's perfecting his bride into
[26:46] his image to be one with him this is a
[26:48] total and full redemption being done by
[26:51] price it is to see total Redemption
[26:55] total blood a man not just part of the
[26:58] way I mean I feel good today and don't
[27:01] feel good tomorrow it's total it's
[27:03] already done
[27:04] hey man praise God so ever so now God
[27:08] has opened the seven seals to reveal the
[27:12] work that he did back in paul's age and
[27:14] also right on down and what he opened
[27:15] the seven see is open to seal broke that
[27:18] right and that therefore then when he
[27:21] opened don't miss it when he opened the
[27:24] sixth seal he showed what he done back
[27:26] there but the seal actually broke back
[27:29] there but he only revealed in 63 what he
[27:33] did back there so then the seal also
[27:36] broke the seventh seal broke also and he
[27:39] will reveal any day soon what he has
[27:42] been doing in sixty three four five six
[27:45] any day soon it shall reveal for we have
[27:49] this written word amen but the revealed
[27:53] words like wit Malachi for has revealed
[27:56] the word Malachi for spoke it out all
[27:59] God wanted our people to do was to
[28:01] receive my words that's all don't change
[28:06] it don't say what you think it is don't
[28:08] go over here don't do it don't say
[28:10] nothing just receive the words then make
[28:13] you sleep they have kept that word
[28:16] that's all
[28:17] then we enhance them then he can anoint
[28:19] him and reveal the word then that is the
[28:23] revelation of the word going forth like
[28:26] it was with because Malachi 4 amen then
[28:30] friends then as he began open seal by
[28:32] seal the Ark of testimony up in heaven
[28:36] sea was open up and that Ark of
[28:41] testimony up in heaven there was a
[28:43] living testimony contained in there this
[28:47] living testimony a witness come on there
[28:51] and went into Malachi 4 and said this is
[28:55] it this is Christ
[28:56] that's that living witness that living
[28:59] testimony and that could just speak the
[29:02] word out there and something happened
[29:04] amen praise our God well then that
[29:07] living testimony was a presence of the
[29:10] Almighty God
[29:12] it was the token that God's prophet said
[29:17] had to come no not in 1906 in the even
[29:22] time you slay the lamb is slain and even
[29:25] time and the token is all over the house
[29:28] the body of Christ amen
[29:30] but everybody in the house must have the
[29:33] token amen
[29:35] but see is then the other words in 1906
[29:38] you won't understand because what it is
[29:40] back there but in the evening time you
[29:43] see it it was the blood there and this
[29:45] evening time here you'll see it it was
[29:47] that living testimony that come down
[29:50] from the Ark in heaven and camp on earth
[29:52] it was humble it was meek it was Cara
[29:55] it was the Word of God amen friends
[29:57] praise our God then this token life the
[30:02] presence has unknown it the house of God
[30:06] the bride and the Bloods hanging over it
[30:08] now and the death angels come but
[30:11] because you are in the land of duty
[30:14] the Death Angel can not take you who
[30:23] says what if you fall down he'll pick
[30:26] you pick you up and we can where we can
[30:31] be so learn with Christ
[30:33] how does man his word his spirit then we
[30:36] can be in oneness with him that's what
[30:40] he wants to do friends amen
[30:42] so we see then that the bride is now
[30:45] actually being sealed by the divine
[30:48] presence the live intestine when I was
[30:50] contained in the ark up in heaven
[30:53] sealing them since 63 serum enough for
[30:58] hits the mine of Christ and I'll knock
[31:01] their bodies to do it and they'll do it
[31:04] and I'll let two hundred thousand
[31:06] thousand demons
[31:07] I'll let the put and the world come for
[31:10] all of these things because come against
[31:11] me I'll let these plagues the race rise
[31:14] and all these things be up on top of
[31:16] them but fear not little flock it is the
[31:19] Father's will to give you the kingdom
[31:21] then if it's his will of do it who can't
[31:24] stop him I'm doing it nothing can harm
[31:28] you be of good courage God shall
[31:32] preserve you
[31:33] he shall he said so thank you then just
[31:36] like Paul and them were sealed back
[31:38] there and the Prophet revealed what
[31:40] happened
[31:40] we're being sealed now by the Word of
[31:43] God every word then Jesus Christ will be
[31:47] soon be able to say father they have
[31:49] received thy works send down the voice
[31:52] of the resurrection
[31:54] no orator God senator it'll come like
[31:58] the voice of a rushing mighty wind and
[32:00] breathe upon us then the Holy Ghost
[32:04] shall be upon you and also in you like
[32:07] it is now but he said that the Holy
[32:09] Ghost went with them the Lord went with
[32:12] them that right working with them with
[32:16] them amen it seems good to the Holy
[32:19] Ghost and us see your friends we have on
[32:25] the inside of the heart he's there but
[32:27] he's gonna come down pill a fire and
[32:29] then when he goes he says go out you
[32:32] move out staying here you stand there
[32:34] you say nothing except he says it amen
[32:37] see these are God's promises are another
[32:40] true there in the Bible and God's
[32:42] prophet has revealed us and therefore we
[32:44] are to take these promises and walk into
[32:47] and cut our way in there because it's
[32:50] there gonna be some false Christ who
[32:51] says no it's not there yet God has said
[32:53] over here it a prophet sit over here see
[32:56] just keep moving love them and just keep
[32:58] walking
[32:58] it's all right brother get out of my way
[33:00] cuz I'm going to the promised land
[33:02] amen if you want to believe that go
[33:05] right ahead
[33:05] that's alright but I'm staying with the
[33:08] word Amen so the bride is being sealed
[33:12] now why to distinguish her from all the
[33:16] other Babylonian that out here that's
[33:18] all
[33:19] amen David was sealed amen bye anoint by
[33:25] God's prophet he was distinguished
[33:28] between Saul in the church amen in David
[33:31] it was a distinction there there's a
[33:33] difference there for David have what
[33:35] faith what do you have the faith has
[33:38] been restored in that doorway but always
[33:42] right and your season here now we have
[33:44] faith in what the word can speak when it
[33:48] wants to
[33:49] but right now is now speaking it right
[33:51] now but I know it can Weiss or speak
[33:54] through the Prophet so therefore brother
[33:57] I know it because I won't be here that's
[33:59] all right I can be healed in his season
[34:01] in his town I know that the word
[34:05] pull is that word to speak through lips
[34:07] human lips in season in the season I
[34:11] know that then God sent David out there
[34:15] to Goliath
[34:17] he was in the line of duty amen now
[34:20] always may show you in the line of duty
[34:22] see me now so when David walked out
[34:25] there he's a hard there you are
[34:26] circumcised Philistine a man to differ
[34:29] the living army of God how dare you I'll
[34:32] cut your head off
[34:33] amen well then you we here can say the
[34:37] same thing how dare these uncircumcised
[34:40] philistine even this place here as an
[34:43] outward place here God put us here
[34:45] there's not a one person in this whole
[34:48] world who can tear down this building or
[34:51] disrupt this world because I am
[34:53] persuaded that what we have committed to
[34:56] him is able to keep any day when any
[35:01] uncircumcised philistine comes against
[35:04] this work here for God put it here and
[35:07] he showed us things in the natural he
[35:08] showed you because you lose it did not
[35:09] give it back to you you keep on walking
[35:11] hey amen he shows you that to build up
[35:14] your faith to break up let you know
[35:16] where you're standing in we're standing
[35:18] on cops ground or this fellowship and no
[35:21] one is with Christ that's where we're
[35:23] standing at amen so with this word token
[35:28] the bride is and passed through these
[35:31] little fiery trials which is only a
[35:34] light affliction that's all it is a
[35:37] light affliction so that we could say
[35:40] yes we stayed with the word amen yes
[35:44] Father we kept we did the work that you
[35:47] Jesus he sent us here for that all right
[35:50] so we have finished the work we finished
[35:53] our work but I work is right now still
[35:55] going on what is it a testimony a
[35:58] witness whether it's a housewife or
[36:00] whoever it is it's other testimony
[36:02] that's all he wanted you to do just
[36:05] stand in that there and he'll bless you
[36:08] right in that for you in the line of
[36:09] God's work amen
[36:12] so we see then that we pass through
[36:16] these fiery trials then we whole thing
[36:18] so that which has is good prove all
[36:22] things hey man
[36:24] well see he's already giving first he
[36:26] gives us a word first they lets the
[36:28] devil come against it and the true one
[36:31] stand up with the word like Micah stood
[36:34] against a four hundred Amen see Micah
[36:38] was the true bride stand against and
[36:41] messengers went out brother Freddie
[36:44] messengers went out from because Derek I
[36:46] knew say look here Mike O'Brien you say
[36:50] what we think it is you not a minister
[36:53] messengers
[36:55] now look here brother look here brother
[36:57] Micah Zedekiah and in the four hundred
[37:00] said this right here you better do it
[37:02] he said gather my way I'll see what God
[37:04] says what you mean Micah you're not
[37:09] right you ain't a fellowship Micah yes
[37:11] I'll say what God said then right
[37:13] but Nastya when he saw all the big
[37:16] fellows excuse me hey having him said
[37:19] he's a crank he's always saying what the
[37:23] word says all the time he's mean
[37:26] so therefore he says what do you think
[37:30] Micah about us going out here to because
[37:33] because to the place out here he said
[37:35] because go ahead he knew that Micah
[37:38] didn't mean that is it how many times
[37:41] have I told you to tell me the truth you
[37:43] know you don't believe that so but tell
[37:47] me what it is so I can know what it is
[37:50] so they come with the questions the
[37:53] question is the questions amen so then
[37:56] Micah said well I had a vision seven
[37:58] sealed vision I saw the Lord High lifted
[38:01] up amen amen
[38:03] and in that seven steel vision of the
[38:05] end time he said false Christ lion spear
[38:09] shall go out and get up on a big group
[38:11] out there and just seize them amen
[38:14] and end the thing there'll be because of
[38:18] Jehoshaphat he'll be in there awesome
[38:20] but God knows how to deliver the godly
[38:23] out of a trial
[38:25] he knows how to do it perhaps they need
[38:27] some more Persian no no see me now but
[38:31] he'll get him out but the lion Devils
[38:34] has got to get the whole group out
[38:35] somewhere see me now then let those
[38:38] serious because something because come
[38:39] against it and then watch old
[38:42] Jehoshaphat finally cry out to God and
[38:54] all these things will deliver
[39:04] hey yes he will he said he will deliver
[39:06] there's got to be some kind of well
[39:08] something that looks just like the word
[39:09] ramoth-gilead it belongs to us but but
[39:12] it wasn't a season wasn't a season he
[39:15] had already passed it blind to it though
[39:19] see but then that's the way it's gotta
[39:22] be
[39:23] then just also got to be Jeremiah and
[39:26] also Hina he not a true prophet of God
[39:30] sanctified our prophet of Israel believe
[39:33] the message for Jeremiah said clear an
[39:36] apparel I he and I say Quran of Babylon
[39:39] that's the message there are what
[39:42] Jeremiah said 70 years paint I said two
[39:45] years
[39:46] one word off how can you tell who's
[39:50] right no prophets of God check the word
[39:53] all right
[39:54] check the word pour the season and the
[39:57] turn then the other one which always
[40:00] look for Balaam he's very sweet
[40:03] here he comes you got his hand stuck out
[40:06] always looking for money here he comes
[40:08] and will curse you talk about you you
[40:10] ain't no good Guardian call them people
[40:12] there so forth so they can know with him
[40:14] come out of there see fail to look at
[40:17] the blood
[40:17] God is God does not discriminate in
[40:19] essence they don't understand that they
[40:22] think that only a certain kinds over
[40:23] here and so forth that's Balaam and he
[40:26] teaches that also and says that to see
[40:28] what he's blind he cannot see the blood
[40:31] atonement hanging
[40:32] God is no respecter of persons I can't
[40:36] do anything he wanted to unto Abraham
[40:41] but Balaam goes right on so don't bother
[40:44] leave bailing right there let's get his
[40:45] money get the money it's all right
[40:47] God's gonna judge him footing anyway but
[40:50] what he did with it see just go ahead
[40:52] and if you want to get because give it
[40:53] out to him but when God says stop stop
[40:55] then when he says give it to give it to
[40:58] him say Amen those three things I look
[41:02] for day and night and then I'll stay
[41:04] with their way
[41:05] where am I see those three things that a
[41:07] great big group thing they're positively
[41:10] no intellectual there'll be no
[41:12] gatherings only an intellectual
[41:15] gathering what the mind thinks it is but
[41:18] the word has already laid it out
[41:20] Amen friends so we've seen in we hold
[41:24] fast to that which is good amen
[41:28] we pull their things no matter what
[41:30] happens see and that we have already
[41:33] received already not going to receive
[41:35] have already received see and we wait
[41:37] together in unity there's a thing in
[41:43] unity alone see you me an elephant but
[41:47] that's where the trouble comes right
[41:49] there the groups cannot wait together in
[41:51] unity of love because each one thinks it
[41:54] means this it means that but here's a
[41:56] little secret for you the disciples with
[42:00] out the Holy Ghost was on one Accord
[42:03] yeah now you tell me something all right
[42:07] they received the words from the Lord
[42:09] Jesus they didn't try to change it
[42:12] though
[42:12] no man said nothing and a Bible says in
[42:16] acts 1:14 that they were on one Accord
[42:18] and with the women also continue in
[42:22] prayer supplications then right Mary
[42:25] being there letting these Catholics know
[42:28] because she had to get the same thing
[42:29] Mary being there hey man and all the
[42:32] brethren that my friends see me now and
[42:35] acts 2:4 says and when the day of
[42:37] Pentecost was fully come they were with
[42:40] one Accord in one place
[42:43] well oh the Holy Ghost yeah see
[42:46] so here today what are they doing then
[42:49] and who has the word without the Holy
[42:53] Ghost
[42:53] here we are preaching the word the tapes
[42:56] is played do you know why we play the
[42:58] tapes we plan so you can check us out

[43:12] feel bad when you stay away cuz you
[43:14] ain't checking me on amen praise the
[43:17] Lord
[43:17] well praise our God amen so we see it in
[43:22] friends that we are to wait together in
[43:24] unity of love for that day to approach
[43:28] now there's gonna be all kind of little
[43:30] things because rise up in your myths to
[43:32] test you on your love that's all it is
[43:35] how else can you be perfected uh I'm
[43:40] right where God put you amen praise our
[43:43] God and also in the world and so forth
[43:46] see so now excuse me Paul says here and
[43:50] here in the book of Hebrews 10:24 25 let
[43:54] me read that there you saw with me
[43:56] praise our God hmm and let us consider
[44:00] one another let us consider one another
[44:04] amen not just ourselves now don't be all
[44:07] burdened down with your own self Oh Lord
[44:10] I'm in this trial if I can only
[44:12] understand this over here and then you
[44:14] come to church legacy and because then
[44:15] you go home like that then you're going
[44:16] back and forth
[44:17] oh my self see then hiring at work you
[44:21] help anybody how can you help anybody
[44:23] when you are burdened down with what
[44:25] you're doing oh hey man just didn't
[44:29] happen here that didn't happen nobody
[44:30] loves me nobody took my hand and see oh
[44:34] lord help me Lord help me Lord
[44:37] see nobody loves me God loves you sure
[44:41] he does but you don't know that because
[44:45] you never gave him a chance to love you
[44:46] through his people so he wants to love
[44:49] you then the other person because
[44:51] because he's afraid you did he saw I
[44:54] like to bring your brother but he's kind
[44:56] of strange
[45:00] but these barriers must come down see I
[45:03] mean nothing must all come down see but
[45:05] God has his ways he's so both are wrong
[45:08] the one who won't do it and so was the
[45:11] other wrong even now God said love the
[45:14] enemies love those who hate you who
[45:18] despise you love them anyway prophet did
[45:21] send him dung in a mail curse them did
[45:24] all kinds me says God bless you brother
[45:25] call prostitute sister prophet did yes

[50:17] all the signs of his coming
[50:18] amen praise God the Prophet Elisha has
[50:23] come on the scene our eyes have been
[50:25] blessed annoying to see Elijah think of
[50:28] it the mortal Elijah despair I was up on
[50:31] him was up on William Brennan yeah
[50:34] resting on God's prophet nine and
[50:36] Malachi for revelation ten seven these
[50:39] scriptures came to life that was the
[50:42] written word but that living testimony
[50:45] contained in the are come down and got
[50:48] on that written word and took that
[50:50] written word inter William branham's
[50:52] heart and made it live amen
[50:54] then there's a written word here that
[50:56] there's gonna be a bride she's gonna be
[50:59] because in the resurrection and in the
[51:00] rapture that same pilla fire will come
[51:02] down again
[51:03] and get into your heart and make this
[51:05] written word live then when it lives
[51:07] that will be the revealed word out in
[51:10] that they'll see it there is your reveal
[51:12] word out there - they'll see that there
[51:14] and we see the Pope and image sodomites
[51:17] all building into a one world system
[51:20] Amen friends
[51:22] there is going to be one moral system it
[51:26] is later than what you think of it amen
[51:30] Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and all
[51:33] of these things we see it go on we
[51:35] friends
[51:36] excuse me we see all of these people
[51:39] these poor people because pressing for
[51:41] our promise living for a little handout
[51:43] which they're never going to get and
[51:45] they got faith - Frank falling down for
[51:48] that what about us we know is true his
[51:56] word heaven and earth shall pass away
[51:58] but his word shall never pass away these
[52:02] people live it down there in mud city
[52:03] down there
[52:04] Devil's tantamount both ways tear them
[52:07] up and it's still gonna singing and also
[52:10] believe that they're going to get
[52:11] something from somebody who don't even
[52:12] know them but he loves us he died for us
[52:29] to prove it and greater love hath no man
[52:34] than to lay down his life for his
[52:37] friends and we are his friends we're his
[52:40] children
[52:41] we're his sons and daughters with his
[52:43] back we aware of his word hello this
[52:46] bone cutter this pleasure spirit of a
[52:48] spirit we amen so now therefore if there
[52:56] are a supernatural people united to the
[52:59] word to this word here see Christ
[53:02] principles history because doctrine not
[53:05] some what somebody said but with the
[53:07] word says here then the world will know
[53:09] that Christ was sent of God that's his
[53:12] purpose
[53:13] so this early church found a secret they
[53:16] kept the word there was a secret Hey
[53:18] they was already on women porn you know
[53:21] they didn't say nothing they didn't say
[53:23] well you know they said nothing
[53:25] they just kept the words and went into
[53:27] the upper room on that promise mm-hmm
[53:30] and he only told us don't misplace the
[53:32] word don't because take out a season
[53:34] those five things don't
[53:35] if you're not a called don't don't
[53:37] handle the arc all right he told this
[53:39] just don't do those things he'd be
[53:41] alright and so say Moses so say yeah but
[53:44] some got to do it see well therefore we
[53:47] just just do that what he said
[53:49] now God deliberately spoke it the way he
[53:52] spoken see me now to see if we would
[53:55] just take it just that way and wouldn't
[53:57] go for wisdom a better way and some must
[54:00] go for that what because put is better
[54:02] way so we see friends in that the world
[54:05] will know just like Malachi for was
[54:08] united with the word all right and the
[54:11] world knew that Christ was sent because
[54:13] he backed up because Jesus Christ
[54:15] therefore we here in our fellowship here
[54:18] if we are united with this word here so
[54:21] much that we are one see that's one then
[54:24] also with God we won and with our
[54:26] brethren because because we are one see
[54:29] one with our brethren with the word and
[54:32] our worship in the church here one see
[54:34] me now then the world here will know
[54:36] that Christ was sent from God
[54:37] well that's what he said and then the
[54:40] world see somebody doing it then they
[54:42] know that he died because 2,000 years
[54:45] ago and here here's a dead word here
[54:47] living amen
[54:49] by the living testimony from God you see
[54:52] guess what he wants to do now we can
[54:55] only do this because because by becoming
[54:58] one with Christ in Christ and God as
[55:01] Christ and Ava's one see now this is the
[55:04] secret of the whole thing for the early
[55:07] church they had that because here's why
[55:09] they took note that Peter had been with
[55:12] Jesus then right so amen so therefore
[55:15] when that comes they'll take note that
[55:18] you had been with those words that were
[55:20] spoken by Elijah you didn't change it
[55:23] just said what it said and stayed right
[55:25] with it amen French see and so therefore
[55:27] we know as we said before that we can be
[55:30] on one mind and one heart through the
[55:33] Word of God just do the work without
[55:35] that uniting spirit yet had even come in
[55:38] they was on one Accord the Bible says so
[55:40] amen
[55:41] okay and jesus said father they have
[55:44] received our words and they have kept
[55:46] our
[55:46] amen praise God all right friends
[55:49] because in closing why do we stress
[55:52] because this word so much we must
[55:55] receive every word of God and also hold
[55:57] on to it and into the into every word as
[55:59] a promise because of God see and so
[56:02] therefore jesus prayed that we would be
[56:04] one see and with this Union because of
[56:08] oneness then when he went when crises
[56:10] that then this prayer can be answered
[56:13] then you can come for his bride when
[56:15] that count and that's coming - well
[56:17] he'll send his spirit it'll be so it's
[56:20] going to be so a man he only sent a word
[56:22] for us to tell us what to do and we're
[56:25] doing it now told how to get ready and
[56:28] we're doing it right now see therefore
[56:30] that's the church that Jesus Christ is
[56:33] coming for then will his prayer be
[56:35] answered and how will it be answered
[56:37] it'll be revealed
[56:39] amen then Jesus written word shall be
[56:42] revealed through the bride amen and
[56:45] father they have kept the words they
[56:48] have received that word
[56:49] hey man did all that's written for the
[56:51] bride that he failed to do back there
[56:53] and also because because to his prophet
[56:55] they shall do it whatever it is I don't
[56:57] know whatever it is they shall do it and
[57:00] it won't be there it'll be his words and
[57:03] them doing it amen friends praise our
[57:07] God because see that then if we have
[57:10] this very own spirit how should we be
[57:11] here in love exhorting one another and
[57:14] so father we say we have your spirit
[57:16] amen
[57:17] get him in our friends one mister word
[57:20] kind of quiet Amen praise our god but
[57:24] God planned that we should be him by a
[57:26] union of his spirit but first it give
[57:30] his word for us to know what it's like
[57:32] and you say want to be like God and you
[57:35] ain't then why was that because Peter
[57:37] because it was the seat inside something
[57:40] in there because compelled him to do it
[57:41] saying then he sent down His Holy Ghost
[57:43] and they were just one people and then
[57:47] he come down himself
[57:48] like we say evany was and spoke what lip
[57:52] to hear amen and we're now in either
[57:55] time ready again for God to calm down is
[57:59] lip to ear purse with the word of God
[58:03] every man every woman every child see
[58:05] and know what God is about to do Lana
[58:08] just like because Joshua he had the Word
[58:12] of God they knew that God was too
[58:14] because cut down the enemy said all
[58:16] right there you know how God was going
[58:19] to do it so after they were circumcised
[58:21] and so forth the captain of the host
[58:23] come down and revealed to walk around
[58:27] jericho there the revealed word come
[58:30] down so we know what we're supposed to
[58:32] do see but we don't know how to do it
[58:34] so he'll send down the voice of the
[58:37] Resurrection and the voice the Kepler
[58:40] the holes will stand there and we and
[58:42] we're standing on holy ground in the
[58:45] back in here and here all holy ground
[58:48] horses here march around Jericho yes the
[58:52] General Orders and out and no
[58:55] explanation what no more false Christ's
[58:58] would what do you think hey ya know what
[59:00] you think the voice speaks it and it's
[59:02] done okay I think no there's no I think
[59:04] nothing about it it's that holy God fear
[59:08] and assembly in God's people
[59:10] amen no scribe can say anything then
[59:14] because Christ is in the myths himself
[59:18] hey when that happens in the line of
[59:21] duty no matter what happens Josh your
[59:24] way in the lower duty he was laying into
[59:27] me
[59:27] it was getting dark amen there right
[59:30] friends
[59:30] he said God I need some more time David
[59:33] Matas hear me that's why and he spoke
[59:37] son standstill the spoken word of God
[59:39] come out of his mouth
[59:40] and he stopped the son that right son
[59:44] standstill this breath when she's in the
[59:47] land of duty every man every limited
[59:50] child I love with the wittekop he will
[59:52] come down in the evening time and speak
[59:55] once again look to him I said my son my
[59:59] daughter do this here do that
[1:00:01] in the line of duty no matter what is
[1:00:02] this peak to worry watch the third poll
[1:00:05] man when that press comes down God is
[1:00:08] gonna move in his people friends I
[1:00:09] believe that what is he is now making us
[1:00:13] perfect in one and that's how he does it
[1:00:16] he makes us perfect in one to do it
[1:00:20] so then we say then that all the Lord
[1:00:22] want us to do is to be humble be humble
[1:00:27] be humble
[1:00:28] so yeah that's all and then when you
[1:00:30] hear a person no matter where they are I
[1:00:32] don't think I think see that mean Christ
[1:00:36] finally now friends you see a person
[1:00:38] just walking God fighting their battles
[1:00:40] God speaking for them so forth and so on
[1:00:42] sometimes here because because you hear
[1:00:45] us cry out here the reason why I'll cry
[1:00:47] out and let you know that what God is
[1:00:49] doing other than that I think I don't
[1:00:51] want to say now sometimes if if a person
[1:00:54] don't understand what God is doing I
[1:00:55] gotta tell them cuz I must tell them oh
[1:00:58] hi I can't because I cannot deny God no
[1:01:00] I mean I see what he's doing here so
[1:01:03] therefore I'll tell you look what he's
[1:01:04] doing seen well never become once
[1:01:06] anything at all see so then as we see no
[1:01:09] matter what we think what we do wife and
[1:01:13] husband and also children minister
[1:01:15] deacon and so forth the matters not God
[1:01:18] has blessed us here he's give us this

[1:05:49] right on the threshold of something just
[1:05:52] it's unspeakable
[1:05:54] as a prophet of God said you can't even
[1:05:56] talk about it it's so great as a fact
[1:05:58] that if we can comprehend his love that
[1:06:02] he died for us there's a supernatural
[1:06:03] God with what because create flesh and
[1:06:06] come down and flesh and die for us and
[1:06:08] we see the world's conditions even in
[1:06:10] reading this thing to you later than
[1:06:13] what you think and some people today
[1:06:14] they are in the world trouble and it's
[1:06:17] the mind age they're going out of their
[1:06:20] minds they don't know what's going on
[1:06:21] because this LSD and hippies and all
[1:06:23] this there's just plagues of God and how
[1:06:26] we thank God how we love him that we
[1:06:29] have the mind of Christ the word and
[1:06:32] that's what takes us through and let us
[1:06:34] pray for those that are weak for there
[1:06:36] will be those weak ones the Bible says
[1:06:38] to bear up to week that aright you see
[1:06:41] if we are strong we don't look down on
[1:06:43] the weak we stick out a hand also there
[1:06:45] mo pray for them amen
[1:06:47] see and I was endeavoring to tell you
[1:06:50] this morning that God is perfecting us
[1:06:52] and the the Brethren ministers deacons
[1:06:56] and so forth everybody in order in line
[1:06:58] with the Word of God
[1:06:59] see line up with the word and and also
[1:07:02] sisters mothers and everybody here line
[1:07:04] up the word and then you see God's
[1:07:06] blessing upon you and then when you see
[1:07:08] that he sends a sign a token that he's
[1:07:11] with you because he compass you and so
[1:07:13] forth when you see a person being
[1:07:15] blessed that's a sign that God is with
[1:07:17] that person you follow me now friends
[1:07:19] he's with that person say otherwise
[1:07:20] because the person wouldn't be blessed
[1:07:22] and then because I don't get jealous you
[1:07:24] just say Lord make me a blessing to him
[1:07:27] that
[1:07:27] bless more brother and watch God open up
[1:07:30] the floodgates upon you see me now but
[1:07:33] so much jealousy and so forth you say
[1:07:35] they want that don't want that just want
[1:07:37] what he want to give me see and then
[1:07:40] you'll be blessed also amen
[1:07:41] and then sometimes when you say certain
[1:07:45] things like last Sunday just feeling led
[1:07:47] as we wait for the Holy Spirit and right
[1:07:49] behind brother hunt now time is say
[1:07:51] asleep and then in saying that somebody
[1:07:53] say what we're talking about me what I
[1:07:54] say that day I dear friends he comes to
[1:07:58] reprove than receive it and then receive
[1:08:01] it with a meek and humble spirit if it's
[1:08:03] not you then you don't have anything to
[1:08:04] say Amen other words if something is
[1:08:07] said and it's not you
[1:08:09] you have no condemnation walking with
[1:08:12] Christ love of God in your heart
[1:08:13] but then if this is you and you say what
[1:08:16] at me and so for someone say to me now
[1:08:17] then there are also these things for
[1:08:19] understanding then there's there are
[1:08:21] those because because the one who comes
