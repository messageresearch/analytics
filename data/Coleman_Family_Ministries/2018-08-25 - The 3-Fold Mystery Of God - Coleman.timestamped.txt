[27:09] and for your glory we asked it in Jesus
[27:12] name and for his sake a man would remain
[27:15] standing for any other word I'd like to
[27:19] read from Ephesians the third chapter in
[27:23] 1st Corinthians the second chapter in
[27:26] Revelation 10 sin
[27:37] Ephesians the third chapter
[27:44] first corinthians the second chapter
[27:46] verse in Revelation 10 7
[27:59] reading from Ephesians the 3rd chapter
[28:02] for this cause I applaud the person of
[28:06] jesus christ for you gentiles if he have
[28:10] heard of the dispensation of the grace
[28:12] of god which has given me to you-ward
[28:16] how that by revelation he made known
[28:19] unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in
[28:23] few words so we see the mystery comes by
[28:27] revelation and you cannot explain it to
[28:30] anybody
[28:32] anything that you can explain is no more
[28:34] faith so faith is a revelation of what
[28:38] God said and God is free to reveal it to
[28:43] whomsoever he will so I cannot explain
[28:46] how the 7th seal is open it's a
[28:48] revelation I cannot explain the seven
[28:51] thunders is a revelation I know one
[28:54] thing I'm part of Helen heal me any man
[28:58] whereby when you read you may understand
[29:01] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[29:03] which in other ages was not made known
[29:06] unto the sons of men as it is now
[29:09] revealed unto us unto his holy apostles
[29:13] and prophets by the spirit that the
[29:17] Gentiles should be fellow ears and of
[29:19] the same body and partakers of his
[29:22] promise in Christ by the gospel where I
[29:25] was made a minister according to the
[29:27] gift of the grace of God given unto me
[29:30] by the effectual working of his power
[29:32] unto me Who am less than the least of
[29:36] All Saints is this grace given that I
[29:40] should preach among the Gentiles the
[29:42] unsearchable riches of Christ
[29:45] and to make known to make all men see
[29:48] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[29:52] which from the beginning of the world
[29:55] hath been hid in God who created all
[29:58] things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[30:02] that now unto the principalities and
[30:04] powers and heavenly places might be
[30:06] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[30:09] of God according to the eternal purpose
[30:11] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[30:14] Lord
[30:15] first Corinthians second chapter verse
[30:19] six howbeit we speak wisdom among them
[30:24] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[30:27] this world nor of the princes of this
[30:29] world that come to know it but we speak
[30:32] the wisdom of God in a mystery even a
[30:37] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[30:40] the world unto our glory
[30:43] which none of the princes of this world
[30:44] knew for had they known it they would
[30:47] not have crucified the Lord of glory and
[30:50] today if they had known that the seven
[30:52] thunders really was revealed they would
[30:54] not have said all those harde mean
[30:56] things which they have to give an
[30:57] account for because the seven thunders
[31:00] has been revealed and the seventh seal
[31:03] has been pulled back on tape after tape
[31:05] after tape revelation ten seven but in
[31:10] the days of the voice of the seventh
[31:12] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[31:16] mystery of God should be finished as he
[31:18] hath declared to his servants the
[31:21] prophets may God the blessing to read of
[31:24] his words you may be seated
[31:27] well amen we're happy to be back here
[31:30] tonight and greet all the ministers of
[31:33] one that haven't seen Lord bless you
[31:35] amen I like to take a title tonight the
[31:40] threefold mystery of God and my subject
[31:45] is the hidden wisdom of God ordained
[31:49] before the world unto our glory well we
[31:53] certainly speaking on behalf of the
[31:56] Coleman family and our sister letter we
[31:58] certainly like to thank by the twine
[32:00] Amanda Church here for making our stay
[32:03] here or very comfortable and we
[32:06] certainly enjoyed our time here thus far
[32:08] and this is my last night to be speaking
[32:11] so I just want to say officially from
[32:14] the platform we thank you and it was
[32:16] wonderful to be here to have fellowship
[32:18] with you if I don't get to shake
[32:20] everybody's hand amen we trust in the
[32:22] sea and glory praise the Lord and it's
[32:25] been wonderful being here with you thus
[32:28] far and we know
[32:30] that it will be even it'll get even
[32:32] greater as we go on in the meetings and
[32:34] all these wonderful ministers will begin
[32:37] to administer you the words of life so I
[32:40] just just given my little testimony
[32:42] about my name being in the book of life
[32:44] amen
[32:46] and so I'm so happy so may the Lord
[32:49] bless the rest the rest of the
[32:50] convention and all the other ministers
[32:52] and rejoicing what our names written
[32:55] under that seventh seal there's so much
[32:57] controversy but is the seal open the
[33:00] seal is not open and I don't know why it
[33:03] should be because I believe we can all
[33:04] read English amen he says it's open on
[33:07] so many tapes so why should there be a
[33:09] dispute about it but yet it has been and
[33:12] it's just been the enemy stirring up
[33:14] good brothers and it's got to be
[33:16] revealed by Jesus Christ and just a
[33:19] couple of quotes God hid and simplicity
[33:22] in your seal book page 59 brother Brown
[33:25] speaking says Amen see there it is see
[33:29] just way it's already past you didn't
[33:32] know it he had been previously speaking
[33:34] about he lies one day you want to hear
[33:37] that he's already come amen
[33:40] and many don't know that and don't
[33:43] understand that in his own John's own
[33:44] disciples a man his own disciples right
[33:47] didn't know he was there
[33:48] amen and so he said oh there it is just
[33:51] where it's already past you didn't know
[33:53] it see if it is if the angel of the Lord
[33:57] will break them seals to us
[34:00] seals forth to us remember his seal with
[34:04] them seven mysterious thunders now how
[34:08] in the world could we know anything
[34:09] unless this thunders open the seals
[34:12] because the whole book was sealed with
[34:14] seven thunders and the thunders here it
[34:17] says right here it had
[34:19] the mr. seven seals are sealed there was
[34:22] seal with the seven thunders now I can't
[34:25] people believe the simple simplicity of
[34:29] a humble bunch of people and the voice
[34:31] of the silence why can't they believe it
[34:34] see and there is you can believe it
[34:37] Amen but nevertheless it is open and
[34:40] maybe somebody's sitting here warned it
[34:43] in here and there still wandering around
[34:45] about the seals and we way up into hell
[34:46] ahem
[34:48] my name's weeds preach this morning
[34:51] everybody sitting nice real quiet
[34:54] hey isn't that nice hey man praise God
[34:57] my my my we in Revelation 5 the breach
[35:03] question number 4 amen question answers
[35:07] book 4 page 243 question 129 have the
[35:14] seven thunders which equals seven
[35:16] mysteries already been revealed now oh
[35:19] now mind you the Seventh Seal opened but
[35:23] not to the public and that's was
[35:25] throwing off the brothers it wasn't open
[35:29] to the public but it opened
[35:32] he took the seven funnest on the
[35:34] backside and placed it in Revelation 8 1
[35:39] because your Bible says there was
[35:41] silence nothing is there but on the
[35:44] seventh seal you can read two or three
[35:46] pages here where he says they open that
[35:49] 7 ceiling under there was seven thunders
[35:51] banging one two three four five six
[35:53] seven well who put that there
[35:56] Malachi 4 put it there one full of the
[36:01] threefold 7th seal amen and there it is
[36:05] but it was a secret amen praise God and
[36:10] he's not to be made known to the public
[36:13] but it broke but not to the public in
[36:17] 1963 March 24th but later on amen praise
[36:23] God later on on anointing once at the
[36:25] end time - can't you get it straight now
[36:27] I'm not the son of man a man for his God
[36:33] the Son of man is being revealed to the
[36:36] public
[36:38] it was closed to the public March 24
[36:41] 1963 but then it was a secret he wasn't
[36:45] supposed to tell you he's getting ready
[36:47] to go away he said that the son of man
[36:49] who is the seventh seal is being
[36:51] revealed to the public
[36:54] amen no he says the were they revealed
[36:59] in the seven seals but are yet not known
[37:02] to us as a thunders yet no they were
[37:06] revealed in the seven seals now how did
[37:10] the thunders get into seven seals unless
[37:12] the prophet put it there that's what the
[37:15] thunders was about they was to reveal
[37:19] they come to reveal the book was closed
[37:24] sealed in the seven thunders had uttered
[37:27] their voices and no one can make out
[37:29] what it was John knew what it wasn't
[37:31] John as a type of the brand so the bride
[37:34] down through the seven Church ages knew
[37:36] what it was but John did not know what
[37:39] the seven written seals was that's what
[37:43] a prophet to reveal as a message
[37:48] praise God Eman something moving in here
[37:52] somewhere
[37:53] [Music]
[37:54] I come down seven years of preaching the
[37:59] seven thunders and you come down to real
[38:02] quiet audience
[38:07] [Music]
[38:08] well that's the way it's got to be I
[38:11] suppose John knew what it was but he was
[38:14] forbidden erotic it's about the seventh
[38:17] angel in the days of his sounding the
[38:20] seven mysteries of the seven thunders
[38:22] would be revealed the mysteries of the
[38:26] thunders the mysteries of it is Jesus
[38:29] Christ the Christ is the word the word
[38:34] is a seed at the son of man so can't you
[38:39] get a straight rather an amen but the
[38:44] seventh angel in the days of his
[38:45] sounding the seven mysteries of the
[38:47] seven thunders would be revealed and the
[38:51] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[38:54] seventh church age he made sure he
[38:56] nailed that down so you can't say he got
[39:00] a comeback in some other
[39:02] sort of thunders was revealed in the
[39:05] seventh church age a man he's gone
[39:08] praise God but the thunders is here page
[39:13] 246 a question about if the natural
[39:16] birth requires water blood and spirit
[39:19] does not spiritual birth require all
[39:21] three stages of grace before the person
[39:23] is truly born again absolutely I just
[39:27] explained this morning the same on the
[39:29] same thing you got to have all stages
[39:31] you begotten of the spirit just like a
[39:33] baby is begotten in the womb of a mother
[39:35] we're not born until they receive the
[39:38] Holy Ghost that's right you're born then
[39:41] you're not converted you're in a
[39:43] procession of being converted until that
[39:46] time that's the reason that all these
[39:49] great mysteries could not be given to
[39:52] Luther could not be given to Wesley
[39:55] could not be given to the age that has
[39:57] just passed biased or Pentecostals now
[40:01] the Pentecostals could not get the
[40:02] Misses because they were babies
[40:04] why it wasn't time now watch
[40:08] they were began you mean the
[40:11] Pentecostals what the baptism the Holy
[40:13] Ghost will only be gotten
[40:16] but faith and charity hadn't even come
[40:20] yet the true baptism of the holy ghost
[40:24] it can only come on a person which is
[40:29] the thunders amen
[40:33] so I'll be gotten I got the Holy Ghost
[40:36] that's only a claiming sign you got to
[40:41] walk in the light and rot and dying
[40:42] through you got it
[40:45] I'd better get over there huh praise God
[40:48] I'm just trying to show you that the
[40:50] Pentecost age was only begotten now if a
[40:52] person himself who's he
[40:55] Gilliam seven spirits seven thunders
[40:59] illa illa illa illa Hume
[41:03] the person of Christ himself the son of
[41:06] man
[41:07] you understand revealing himself in
[41:10] human flesh it could not have come till
[41:13] now and he reveals the true baptism of
[41:16] the Holy Ghost praise God
[41:19] now Malachi 4 prophesied about the
[41:21] threefold mystery of God and connected
[41:24] it to the seven thunders in 1962 I was
[41:28] sharing with some of the administer
[41:30] brethren this quote and the quote is
[41:32] found on super sang June 24 1962
[41:37] Southgate California
[41:39] quote seven voices to be made known let
[41:44] us work Lord for we know we have a much
[41:47] more time to work we see time closing in
[41:52] soon we're looking for the angel that
[41:55] will set his foot on the land and on the
[41:58] sea and raise up his hand and swore by
[42:02] him that lives for ever and ever
[42:04] times shall be no more
[42:07] you said at that time the mystery of God
[42:10] should be finished we understand now
[42:14] father that God's three full mystery has
[42:20] been made known to us 1962 the threefold
[42:26] mystery of God had been made known amen
[42:31] and we understand and are looking now
[42:33] for those mysterious thunders that come
[42:38] out from heaven in the book of
[42:39] Revelation that were sealing up back at
[42:42] a book revealed to us O Lord the things
[42:45] that we need for the battle ahead of us
[42:48] unquote so we see Malachi 4 in 1962
[42:54] connecting together the mystery of God
[42:56] three fold mystery seven Thunder mystery
[42:58] what is the mystery of God I want to be
[43:01] on the ending beginning and ending of a
[43:06] Gentile dispensation one 1955 in the end
[43:11] this is a xerox pope's you know at that
[43:15] time Michael shall stand the great
[43:18] Prince Michael was Christ of course who
[43:21] fought to angelic wars in heaven with
[43:23] the devil Satan Michael fought together
[43:26] for against each other rather and now at
[43:30] at that time he said as many as were
[43:32] found written in the book was delivered
[43:34] and those who had done righteous watch
[43:37] it close and that in the wise mfer
[43:42] reason on the wrong page here here we
[43:45] are
[43:46] a man now without Daniel shut up the
[43:49] words and seal the book even to the time
[43:52] of the end for many shall run to and fro
[43:55] and knowledge shall increase then I
[43:58] Daniel beheld and look and behold there
[44:01] stood mother to one on this side of the
[44:04] bank of the river and the one on the
[44:06] other side of the bank of the river and
[44:07] then once said to the man clothed in
[44:09] linen the Holy Spirit which was upon the
[44:12] waters people's multitudes holy ghosts

[44:52] multitude the waters means thickness
[44:54] multitudes of people and here's one in

[45:13] on and nobody else want you to walk on
[45:15] them put them thunders on me and swear
[45:18] [Applause]
