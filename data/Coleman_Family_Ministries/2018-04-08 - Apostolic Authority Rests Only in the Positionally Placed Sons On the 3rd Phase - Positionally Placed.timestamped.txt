[5:29] raise his wonderful name
[5:34] well good morning Church New York and
[5:38] Pennsylvania
[5:40] I don't know what I'm doing here I had
[5:44] to battle over my life to get here
[5:47] I know what I was supposed to put on a
[5:50] video
[5:51] there
[5:53] give you a few words
[5:56] but the holy spirit kept telling me
[5:59] this
[6:01] I don't know I have to get anointed like
[6:03] glass he told me that you like last week
[6:06] so I'm trusting the Lord because
[6:10] about wiped out my health condition I
[6:14] I'm supposed to have a bay a biopsy a
[6:17] Wednesday after about how many doctors
[6:20] and three MRIs and next week the three
[6:24] more doctors and then the lands to
[6:29] specialists orthopedic specialist
[6:32] they departments so one of them is the
[6:36] second opinion
[6:38] I wasn't born yesterday
[6:41] so of course he's he can cut
[6:45] through here
[6:47] in there to go to the back
[6:50] and cut
[6:53] cut away the obstruction to the spinal
[6:56] cord because no fluid get hard to get
[7:00] down through there and that is affecting
[7:03] the nerves
[7:04] I have no I'm weak I have no strength in
[7:07] my arms they can't hardly pick up
[7:09] anything so they know what it was and
[7:11] then stenosis in the lower back that's
[7:14] where my legs are wobbly the nerves
[7:18] so friends I have
[7:19] [Music]
[7:23] been through but this is source I've
[7:26] ever had to go through and knowing that
[7:29] de prize is right at hand
[7:32] that's the whole thing
[7:34] [Applause]
[7:43] I'm trying to think I have and then Oh
[7:47] first doctor got dr. Capilouto and dr.
[7:51] Johnson he says what did dr. Johnson
[7:54] take I saw this that he told me what you
[7:56] told me
[8:00] so what are you kidding me with you so
[8:02] you're the same officer same suite of
[8:05] offices so then he says I said well he
[8:09] told me I needed surgery and so he says
[8:12] what I said but I have to meditate on
[8:15] any think about that because it would be
[8:18] then he says well he says I said how
[8:24] long will it be later
[8:25] well you have a collar that you have to
[8:28] wear for three months
[8:31] and they got to go in through here and I
[8:34] understand that they got to push your
[8:36] vocal cords back so they don't touch it
[8:39] and if they do and a lot of doctors do
[8:41] touch the vocal cords you can't speak
[8:43] for six months
[8:45] so this is third phase you have problems
[8:52] you got problems
[8:56] third phase
[8:59] satan's want to make you have faith and
[9:02] prove every inch of ground you're gonna
[9:04] stand on so i'm just tell you right now
[9:07] so the third face is no place for
[9:09] crybabies
[9:12] is for men
[9:14] and women of old so your Ma's will get
[9:19] used to it now
[9:21] and I'm an example right in front of you
[9:23] so he told me that I'm so my god I says
[9:27] oh he says so I think about he said no
[9:31] he said I'll tell you what I do he says
[9:33] I don't have too many openings yes so he
[9:37] says I'll put you in for July 1st that's
[9:40] the convention
[9:42] and then also I would like to go to
[9:44] Prague of him he'll in August
[9:47] that wipes it out he wipes it up so
[9:55] see what's what's going on I really have
[9:59] to have faith so I just because Egyptian
[10:04] doctor a neurologist had told me a week
[10:07] or so prior he he knows the other two
[10:11] he's in Massapequa he says what do you
[10:15] want to do to you so we're talking about
[10:17] surgery
[10:22] he told me three times don't let them do
[10:25] it
[10:27] so I filed that away so he's ad
[10:30] neurologist with the nerves
[10:32] he knows what'll happen to your nerves
[10:34] but all they want to do is cut in there
[10:37] so anyway I spoke to my good friend
[10:39] brother Musgrove I was telling him about
[10:41] it and lo and behold well he had the
[10:43] same thing done but he was in his 40s
[10:45] and that was the 1995 somebody there
[10:49] about so he told me that they went
[10:51] through there he has the scar there
[10:52] right now and he said the doctor told me
[10:55] if I miss so you won't speak for six
[10:58] months might touch your vocal cords and

[17:09] praise God brother Norman a title
[17:14] apostolic Authority rest only in the
[17:18] position he placed sons on the third
[17:20] phase
[17:27] my subject is this is my beloved Son in
[17:31] whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[17:37] the first time this was spoken Matthew
[17:39] 13 that's when the Spirit came upon
[17:41] Jesus because he was a son
[17:44] he was the son of God and those of you
[17:48] with the Holy Ghost that's what the Lord
[17:50] said when he baptize you with the Holy
[17:53] Ghost this is my beloved son or daughter
[17:56] and who armed well please amen
[18:01] that's why the enemies your friends they
[18:05] can understand once the Holy Ghost
[18:07] person God is pleased with you before
[18:09] the foundation of the world amen he
[18:12] prospers your way amen demons trying to
[18:16] stop it he don't think of what why is
[18:18] God still blessing you amen
[18:21] so but now we come down at the end of
[18:23] the age where this is to be repeated
[18:27] again this is my beloved son who I'm
[18:29] well pleased hear ye him and there's a
[18:33] difference there now
[18:34] [Applause]
[18:35] amen so what I want to say is that I got
[18:42] some something to do here and yes
[18:52] I did it no one didn't I got it here oh
[18:54] that's wonderful because the way I was
[18:57] going on what was
[19:00] amen I got it here so okay this is from
[19:07] sister pet fashion Ola concerning the
[19:10] sky the zodiac the Great Pyramid was
[19:16] built to be aligned true north with his
[19:20] entrance pointing to the North Star the
[19:24] North Star at that time was alpha J
[19:27] CONUS and notice the word alpha
[19:30] and in direct alignment it's shown
[19:33] through the descending passage 344 feet
[19:38] to the floor because stars move there
[19:42] because stars move there has not been a
[19:45] great a direct alignment in these past
[19:49] four thousand years or so
[19:51] however Polaris the current North Star
[19:55] will be in direct alignment in the year
[19:59] 2004
[20:02] next year only once before true
[20:06] alignment was way back when the pyramid
[20:09] was built you got it now
[20:16] amen and next year it'll be a lion again
[20:20] with Polaris we might also actually also
[20:28] Polaris is actually right Polaris is
[20:32] actually three stars three and one that
[20:36] appeared to us as one because of their
[20:39] great distance another interesting note
[20:42] is that inside the pyramid the entrance
[20:45] of the ascending passage to the King's
[20:47] Chamber there is wedged a three stone
[20:51] plug it is made of a rare red granite
[20:55] that is identical to the granite on
[20:58] Mount Horeb well I want to thank brother
[21:01] Reuben for putting it up here
[21:07] anyway
[21:09] so among yeah on the granite on Mount
[21:14] Horeb I find this so amazing in light of
[21:17] the new church being built with the
[21:20] pulpit to the north and at the same time
[21:23] that direct alignment is about to happen
[21:27] Amen now watch this also since God
[21:32] designed the pyramid knowing the North
[21:35] Star would only directly align again
[21:41] after thousands of years he knew that
[21:47] it'd be 2004 and not in between
[21:51] he knew that we'd be here
[21:55] now what Devils want to stop it amen
[22:03] yes sir may be seated
[22:06] also since God designed the pyramid
[22:08] knowing the North Star would only
[22:10] directly align again after thousands of
[22:13] years it is significant its significance
[22:17] must be great I can only think that it's
[22:21] time for the pyramid to finally be
[22:23] camped god bless you sister Pat I
[22:27] believe so
[22:28] I believe that's right
[22:34] so anyway brother brother Paul he had a
[22:41] dream where he reaches first the
[22:44] absolute Shreveport 1963 paragraph 69
[22:49] Christ again is like the North Star you
[22:52] know the world turns around and the star
[22:55] is really the one you see as the evening
[22:58] stars also the morning star the world
[23:00] just turns around to it but it shifts
[23:03] away from those stars all but the North
[23:07] Star and the ones up there now it's not
[23:09] really true north that's coming next
[23:12] year
[23:13] now you can't such a compass upon the
[23:17] evening star and get anywhere can you
[23:20] imagine when that North Star is aligned
[23:24] in the pyramids lineup with it I mean
[23:26] would that be their spoken word Brad
[23:28] thus saith the Lord
[23:40] amen
[23:42] I don't know but but my Bible says that
[23:47] that's what my Bible says amen like see
[23:51] him in some money
[23:54] my Bible doesn't say that grandma okay
[23:58] for his Lord the world just turns around
[24:02] it but it shifts away from those stars
[24:05] all about the North Star
[24:07] now you can't set your compass upon the
[24:10] evening star and get anywhere because
[24:13] the next morning what you're in thank
[24:15] you
[24:15] yeah and the evening star in the West
[24:18] and the next morning you in the East so
[24:21] you can't do it but you can set it on
[24:22] the North Star hold her
[24:25] dead center you'll come out
[24:28] and that's forward Brian would be tuned
[24:30] off every move
[24:33] thus saith the Lord amen
[24:39] [Applause]
[24:39] [Music]
[24:43] at the clock up there amen and that's
[24:46] what uh no watch that's what a
[24:49] christ-centered life is
[24:52] when your loss he is your North Star
[24:55] then if he is the North Star the Holy
[24:58] Spirit as you compass and the compass
[25:00] will only point to the North Star
[25:02] it won't point to accrete our
[25:04] denomination it won't point to a
[25:06] sensation or whatever it is it'll hold
[25:09] steady to the North Star
[25:11] he is you he is your North Star when you
[25:14] lost you might shift with denominations
[25:17] and things like that but then but the
[25:19] cop is the Holy Spirit will point you
[25:21] right straight to the word which is
[25:23] Christ and hold you steady tie to that
[25:28] what if there was no Northstar how would
[25:31] a man ever finds the way in the foggy
[25:32] see what if there was no holy spirit to
[25:35] to directly to the Word of God to
[25:38] manifest improve it what would we do in
[25:41] this hour the holy spirit points only to
[25:44] the word man shall not live by bread
[25:46] alone but by every word not part of the
[25:49] word but every word all of it every word
[25:51] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[25:53] that's what a man lives by he's your
[25:56] absolute in your life he also is your
[25:59] North Star
[26:11] so you are facing north to the North
[26:15] Star and the next year you'll be facing
[26:19] due north
[26:22] first time since the way back when the
[26:26] pyramid was built amen
[26:28] and actually the pyramid is being
[26:31] rebuilt again
[26:34] hey man you caught that Barry Barry
[26:39] okay may be seated brother Paul Griffin
[26:42] had just dream 6:27 a 2000 I had this
[26:48] dream early on Sunday morning June 25th
[26:51] I was in church and it was a New York
[26:53] church building this building but it was
[26:57] located at Pennsylvania c2 is one
[27:01] the church was situated so that the
[27:04] pulpit was to the north and sunlight was
[27:08] streaming from the west over there you
[27:13] were in the pulpit you were explaining
[27:14] the third phase why you were speaking
[27:19] other words we could not I could not
[27:21] really explain that until the church was
[27:24] built because it had to be turned north
[27:27] come on now pick it up
[27:31] praise God
[27:34] I'm looking for some shouts or something
[27:38] I'm trying to show you God's vindicated
[27:41] us being here
[27:42] no devil can take us out of here hey man
[27:47] so believe that believe it for your Holy
[27:50] Ghost believe it for your healing
[27:53] believe it for your family
[27:56] believe it God put you in the right
[27:58] place
[28:00] and
[28:05] and today I'm going to explain the third
[28:07] phane a man okay while you were speaking
[28:14] you were you were explaining the third
[28:16] phase while you were speaking someone
[28:18] came up to me from my left and asked me
[28:21] how this could be understood I turned to
[28:24] the person said it's not to be
[28:25] understood with your with the natural
[28:28] Martin but to be believed on from the
[28:30] heart yes that's all I remember god
[28:32] bless you brother Paul well praise the
[28:35] Lord
[28:37] soul brother Bram pointing us to the
[28:42] word and that's all only thing we can
[28:44] take on this third phase because all
[28:47] kinds of things are going to be fine all
[28:49] kind of demons and everything else so
[28:52] I'm just letting you know right now so
[28:54] you better be anchored in the word
[28:57] because I saw you've been torn here and
[29:00] on Malachor force message does that
[29:03] worry
[29:04] okay the world's falling apart again
[29:06] Shreveport 1963 page 27 we like Abraham
[29:10] Abraham received the word and we just
[29:12] see the Baberaham and anything contrary
[29:15] to the word he called it as if it wasn't
[29:18] and any Jew born child of God receives
[29:21] God's Word I don't care what anybody
[29:24] says or what system speaks against the
[29:26] word the word is true anyhow now listen
[29:29] here very important now for this third
[29:31] phase and for what you're looking for
[29:33] God's obligated to meet you on the basis
[29:37] of them promises outside of them
[29:40] promises he can't meet you because you
[29:43] don't cut yourself off from him because
[29:46] he is the word
[29:48] [Applause]
[29:53] now you understand why I say back to the
[29:55] Bible back to the word you understand
[29:59] now why I preach promises promises
[30:01] promises
[30:04] that's why hey man lore'l okay may be
[30:11] seated
[30:12] that's the reason our world is falling
[30:14] apart and closing we might say this
[30:16] anything is contrary to it it's though
[30:19] it wasn't such a man-made system we
[30:22] never look at that no sir
[30:24] being then baptized into this kingdom
[30:27] we're now sitting in heavenly places in
[30:29] Christ Jesus oh my
[30:31] with our knowing it King with us
[30:33] feasting on the kingdom promised word
[30:37] anointed and vindicated right among us
[30:40] there it is
[30:42] his kingdom promised made right before
[30:44] nothing can turn you from it well that's
[30:48] there we are
[30:52] and hips and Manas you to stay with that
[30:55] word amen on his third phase so now now
[31:02] you

[31:12] which is which is place in Christ
[31:14] Adoption time
[31:17] and as I've been reading about the
[31:19] zodiac the Holy Spirit always shows his
[31:21] signs of a spiritual happening in the
[31:24] sky as first now we know February 28
[31:27] 1963 seven angels appeared and we know
[31:32] 1965 on the rising of the Sun the Holy
[31:35] Spirit told brother Branham to turn the
[31:37] cloud to the right and there was Jesus
[31:39] Christ so we know what it was and the
[31:44] seven angels representing Christ in the
[31:47] seven churches etcetera and then it was
[31:51] published I think a May 17th issue I
[31:54] think it was May rockefeller his wife

[32:38] be identified with you in a revelation
[32:40] of the word that has been shared with us
[32:43] here in Tucson from New York City we can
[32:45] truly say like the Prophet said the
[32:47] mighty God unveil Philadelphia I'm
[32:50] identified with a group that feels the
[32:51] Spirit of God I'm identified with a
[32:53] group that knows he's unveiled that note
[32:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[32:57] forever and knows that this is not
[32:59] fanaticism it's Jesus Christ saying
[33:02] forever
[33:02] I'm identified with that group here
[33:04] tonight that was us there yet they're
[33:07] called a bunch of heretics he had a
[33:09] bunch of fanaticism on account of the
[33:11] Word of God but I'm not ashamed of the
[33:13] gospel of Jesus Christ for the power of
[33:15] God unto salvation to to them once a man
[33:19] the last message that you sent asked
[33:22] what you will part two that was played
[33:24] in Tucson suddenly April 13 2003 on the

[33:32] house in West Tucson listening to the
[33:34] next message we will be playing that was
[33:37] preach
[33:41] in Venezuela titled the seventh seal
[33:45] during the late evening time around 6 or
[33:48] 7 o'clock at this time I received a call
[33:51] from brother Ruben Ornelas that told me
[33:54] about the cloud that had appeared he
[33:57] said the form was the same as a cloud
[33:59] that appeared February 1963 he was very
[34:02] excited and told me that he had taken a
[34:04] picture of it and would to send it to me
[34:07] when it was developed it was not until
[34:09] Easter Sunday April 20th that several
[34:12] people from our church gave testimony of
[34:14] seeing the same cloud the first
[34:17] testimony was from a brother that lives
[34:20] in the Far West of Tucson brother Leo
[34:23] ornelas he lives in an area backed by
[34:27] the sacred mountains
[34:28] he said the cloud appeared over the
[34:30] horizon of the mountains approximately
[34:32] 6:45 p.m. on April 16 2003 his mother
[34:37] was in the house he told her to come
[34:39] outside quickly because in the sky that
[34:42] was totally clear the only cloud was
[34:46] this cloud that came from the West going
[34:48] East coming your way hey man

[35:08] were they were talking about Sunday
[35:10] service when brother Jeff told by the
[35:12] Chuck there's the cloud and he looked
[35:15] straight up over the church and said it
[35:17] was as though we were looking in the
[35:19] face of Christ the configuration was the
[35:23] same as it was in the cloud they have
[35:25] seen from the cloud in the picture 1963
[35:28] the cloud was still traveling east to
[35:31] the east toward the Catalina's sister
[35:34] Rhonda Barker who lives on the east side
[35:36] of Tucson said that at about 7:05 p.m.
[35:39] as the Sun was going down her daughter
[35:41] sixteen-year-old Sheila said mom look in

[35:52] clear sky with a full moon they were in
[35:55] one cloud in the sky and they recognized
[35:57] it to be the same configuration as the
[36:00] one
[36:04] as the one the Prophet identified at the
[36:08] seven angels their testimony was that
[36:11] there was such a presence that they both
[36:13] started weeping 16 years Shila said mama

[37:49] had seen a picture of that the Prophet
[37:51] identified the seven thunders of every
[37:54] one of the eight testimonies given you

[1:14:08] father me and I ánewá you and me then
[1:14:11] that's a sealed unit of the Lord God and
[1:14:14] then they are vindicated and placed
[1:14:18] positionally placed with apostolic
[1:14:21] Authority okay when that time takes
[1:14:28] place they become vindicated sons and
[1:14:30] daughters of God
[1:14:33] they uh I've see the smiles on the faces
[1:14:37] I can see some sister telling her
[1:14:39] husband I'm gonna be an aptitude
[1:14:49] amen amen sisters I got to hear you you
[1:14:53] know muttering like Sarah who me old
[1:14:57] lady I'm gonna be a doctor too
[1:15:01] amen praise the Lord okay when a man
[1:15:05] when a son is born into it it's a son
[1:15:08] then and when you born again you a son
[1:15:11] but actually you always was a son
[1:15:14] because when the time comes for you to
[1:15:16] be born again this is my beloved son who
[1:15:19] I'm well pleased
[1:15:20] that comes upon you and you can only
[1:15:23] come upon you if you already was the son
[1:15:26] in his thinking
[1:15:28] where was that way back before the
[1:15:33] foundation of the world thou was a son
[1:15:37] and that's why the Holy Spirit come upon
[1:15:41] you because you are a son amen
[1:15:46] then you go through these seven things
[1:15:49] and the charity comes upon you and then
[1:15:52] he speaks again this is my beloved Son
[1:15:55] in whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:08] amassing on the is it going in they
[1:16:11] telling me yeah amen then it's worth it
[1:16:13] worth it for me to come in here and even
[1:16:15] hey glory to God
[1:16:21] okay I got their hair pretty quick it's
[1:16:25] only a hour and five minutes or so you
[1:16:27] may be seated
[1:16:28] and if their son never to be the right
[1:16:33] if you never turn out to be the right
[1:16:34] kind of a son he never became here now
[1:16:37] this is very important it's third phase
[1:16:39] this is where you prove that you ear
[1:16:42] because you add and to prove that you
[1:16:46] are the ear and the other guys the only
[1:16:50] third phase in the message they ain't
[1:16:52] doing nothing
[1:16:52] well they don't get nothing okay you got
[1:16:56] that now and don't let that buy you see
[1:16:58] but he was the right son
[1:17:00] and the son that would obey his father
[1:17:02] then that son was adopted a place
[1:17:05] positionally he became heir of what the
[1:17:09] father had and that's what God was doing
[1:17:10] on Mount Transfiguration when he took
[1:17:13] his own son and he proven to be the
[1:17:15] right son and has stood all temptations
[1:17:18] he took him up on mountain
[1:17:19] Transfiguration overshadow him you know
[1:17:22] in the Old Testament it took a son that
[1:17:24] dressed him in a nice pretty garment set
[1:17:27] him up before the public and they had a
[1:17:28] ceremony of placing or we call adopt in
[1:17:31] Galatians I think Paul refers to this
[1:17:34] adopted and sons now
[1:17:36] ministers will understand in spiritual
[1:17:38] Bible readers the placing of the Sun now
[1:17:40] in other words this is very important
[1:17:42] because Pentecost mist is in other words
[1:17:46] the son was the son he was born there's
[1:17:49] where your Pentecostal people made their
[1:17:52] mistake being born into the family by
[1:17:55] the Holy Ghost that's right but then
[1:17:57] there must be the right kind of children
[1:17:59] to Jude by the right tutor
[1:18:01] and the tutor the Holy Spirit will be
[1:18:04] here on this third face you're facing
[1:18:06] north and you'll be looking at him and
[1:18:09] he will do to you okay
[1:18:16] page 25 so in Old Testament when that
[1:18:19] son was adopted a place into the family
[1:18:21] his name was just as good on the check
[1:18:24] as his daddy sauce you give him a ring a
[1:18:27] signet and so forth and he had his
[1:18:29] daddy's ring
[1:18:30] now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus
[1:18:33] to God God placed him positionally this
[1:18:38] is him how many understand my title
[1:18:43] apostolic authority rests only in
[1:18:46] position we placed sons you got it now
[1:18:50] [Applause]
[1:18:58] I want to thank you
[1:19:02] I want to thank you
[1:19:06] okay now when maybe season when the
[1:19:10] member is born by the Holy Ghost into
[1:19:13] the family and God has proven to have
[1:19:15] these virtues in him that God can see
[1:19:18] virtue knowledge temperate here it is a
[1:19:21] patient's brother godliness brotherly
[1:19:23] kindness in him then God seals him or
[1:19:27] places him and there that's when you see
[1:19:31] sons and daughters of God
[1:19:34] well Prius garment doing this for 30
[1:19:37] years I think it went home today yes sir
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:51] okay well musician see I not wholly
[1:19:57] alone
[1:19:57] oh yeah maybe seated
[1:20:01] okay now let's strike our subject this
[1:20:05] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:20:07] pleased hear ye him Amen hear him
[1:20:12] Phoenix Arizona in 1960 placing of a son
[1:20:15] take him out in a certain place and have
[1:20:17] a ceremony for angels place him
[1:20:20] positionally what he is in the body of
[1:20:23] Christ other words what he is
[1:20:27] maybe apostle past the Prophet teacher
[1:20:31] whatever Amen pastor whatever there also
[1:20:36] have to teach ll after teaching brothers
[1:20:40] and sisters and housewives and mechanics
[1:20:42] and whatever they are but whatever they
[1:20:45] are in now Barney they will be placed
[1:20:46] position
[1:20:48] amen that'll be God's great army
[1:20:52] marching toward the resurrection praise
[1:20:55] God amen
[1:21:00] yes sir
[1:21:02] all right see place him a s Ryan yes
[1:21:10] right what he is in the body of Christ
[1:21:12] then that person has the authority si
[1:21:18] so all these passes and apostles or
[1:21:20] whatever they've been doing a long work
[1:21:22] then on the field and doing all out
[1:21:25] there and now they've been proven now
[1:21:28] now you see your seven virtues that are
[1:21:33] in you now intellectually by revelation
[1:21:38] then when charity comes upon you and
[1:21:40] your seals are refilled then those
[1:21:44] virtues in the proving ground will begin
