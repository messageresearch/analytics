the angel of life to get the move to you the death agent begins to move to the church same time to take it out the uncircumcised take out the firstborn Pentecostals hallelujah praise you say it's a flux in a plank of spirit of class that the death ain't okay even so come Lord Jesus hallelujah Garrido Cardenas two things the pride was supposed to apply the token by space and a token is applied before this shaken comes before it actually happens the blood was applied by faith believing that it would happen you're not supposed to wait for 30 40 days Minister who you can wait for 30 40 days for the thunders the prophecy apply the blood before before by seven on the faith believe it is going to happen and then when I see the blood whose I Michael Caesar blood Michael Passover where is my in the judgment hour the token would be displayed and the Death Angel would be loosed to bring spiritual death to all outside of the torture brothers they are all that the token is to be displayed at hand the Prophet says when I see the blood I'll pass over you my god I can't read the quotes here apply the blood sailors say it stay under this heaven thunderblood do not see the token our Passover view is God's this is page 19 and 20 on the token is God's requirement the hour the evening time messages to apply the token let's stop right there what is the even time message the white horse rider of 10 what to evening time methods apply that's okay Mina tell me that's all what the message is the Prophet says on page 19 to 20 oh well I thought it was this I had to go through this minister in that minutes and just building that caretaker this dignitary and all I had to do was the head of token that's all what is temple face down and Egypt laying around anywhere just pick up a hold of a branch there and with protocol in there down in Egypt under a high school we write a missile aim and just pick it up late anywhere and God laid the seventh on the page all over the place all the books everywhere just pick it up here and pick it up there fly the blood ah so sample maybe you want the propagator to climb the Empire State Building huh and we go up there and then you see the thunders even now just believe the word [Applause] the diva time missus apply the token before the display time comes when the Death Angel is loosed to bring us shake it in the message there's no time to apply it in the Death Angel we'll be right into shape but thank god there's some seeds out there we have to go get them they are predestinated well how but because it won't have nine years or whatever it is they don't need that because Peter number 120 and they was with him for three and a half years there were three thousand that did here no tapes this did no nothing but while Peter yet spake these words of the word they were seed down in his hole Jesus Christ how would it be preached the Holy Spirit will be upon a minister he'll speak the word that saith the Lord then the same Holy Spirit will be in the elected sees heights and the Holy Spirit will believe with the ministers saying and they'll scream out men and brethren what shall we do to be saved believe the pundit so the first action adoptions protections are pretty Scott the number C of God they will apply the token in one split second because they are predestinated Oh what apparently your family what a time for your wife what a turn for your children please God don't comment it unto you and to your children to go too far off even as many the Lord our God shall call and God is still calling kick over the cheers praise God

must be there for display page 57 what God did through Malachi for he will continue to do tonight through this his display of a token of the Holy Spirit back upon the bride today are my friends unless the tokens on the door there's no spirit there is a spiritual death that's going to strike everywhere in this message you say everywhere let's see what the prophecy page 28 amen praise God that that is alright you say I believe yes I go I believe the message okay now excuse me all it should make us to make our hearts Oh quiet Church don't fail me you're not don't-don't-don't with the sunset don't

token everybody everybody and you must have a token amen do you hear random Tabernacle you must have the token displayed you mean random tatelman Apple has got to have the token displayed they got a priest seven thunders for Dobson's Joseph perfectionist habit [Music] whyis over you for your acceptance the token that gets everybody it sure does against the bream tabernacle and New York tavern a from Tucson Tabernacle all the Tavener Fort Wayne's a fanatical all of them the token must be displayed and that's the way I love it then I'm on equal footing remember you must have a talking display without it all you're believing is in vain twenty years is in vain all of your believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not in I see the blood that's the talk and the token here is that he had to see that actual chemistry but today is the life it must see the very life of Jesus Christ oh there we are church oh my tired weary I want to close out here maybe just a few more remarks Amen organist and are they over here ready okay just a few remarks now a profits a profit must prophesy and be rejected then his prophecy comes to pass then they remember his words or approach for the word a page 20 but remember the Prophet is known after his prophecy has the main benefits so if the people don't want to believe that God's evil the cheers to make this prophecy benefit and what's the prophecy when I see the token displayed our Passover that's the prophecy can after the Prophet have been rejected and his message been rejected then they will remember his words when they see the death angel come and then they will remember his words Jesus presence on a man proved this fact the first time amen st. John 2 13 through 17 amen just look back around here I'm a closeout here now I think I read this amen falou background verse 13 to give you a break may be seated and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and dole and doves and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remember that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up then answered the Jews make from the religious Jews when he's seen the Holy Spirit in this little man for the beer and here they were so high in religious and holy well who are you and then the Jews said to him then answer is used and said unto Him what sign show us now unto us seeing that thou doest these things and jesus answered said unto them destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up unto this temple of the words in three days I will raise it up but he spake of the temple of his body amen when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and then they believe the scripture in the resurrection they finally believe the word they couldn't believe the word until the resurrection and not going to believe the word amen praise God amen and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said they not only believed the Scriptures but they believed the revealed word praise God they believed the inspiration glory so what I'm saying here the answer what time see what they were saying here what sign what miracle told what Tolkien what indication can you give us as evidence that you have authority and a commission to act in this way who told you to do this here what do you think you are anyway who the profit is gone who you know calf we've been here 400 years who are you what sound do you have who saw your picture seven thunders who told your priest or the protection adoption who told you to do is
