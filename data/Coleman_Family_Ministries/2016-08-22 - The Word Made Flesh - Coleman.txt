TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we're waiting to be stimulated by the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of the Capstone Revelation all the things that we know is true we can't explain it but that Revelation that Capstone Dynamic love will sit down in the bride and all of a sudden just be open to her and she'll know all about it and all the threatening the worrying and the fighting and the all be over you rest you walk and move in the holy spirit amen quick and Made Alive we have the virtue we have the patience we have the knowledge it's growing of course we have the brotherly kindness but see uh we don't have the strength of those things yet the love is see love is the strength of these attributes that makes it live amen so we are but now we're taking on these things by faith amen by faith see you don't feel it you don't see it that's right cuz when a man wants to exercise he takes his barbells begins to exercise you don't see it the first day the muscles but you keep at it you keep at it till finally the muscles just grow out where we take the The Virtue and we begin to exercise it patience exercise you got to get into it amen you'll fail you fall down you get up but exercise it in your patience exercise in it and then one day the strength of it love of God will come down you see a living faith a living patience a living brotherly kind it'll live amen praise our god well let us turn to the word of the Lord I feel good this morning just talking about the Lord and the promise of God now I don't want to be long with you and I'm trying to I could hold down this year amen but uh but I trust that maybe some uh understand what we've been trying to do and can sit a little bit longer praise the Lord uh 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter verse 1-4 Ephesians 5:30 if you're writing them down I'm read from second Corinthians the 4th chapter therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor haing the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jes J sake for God who commanded the light to shine out the darkness hath shine in in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroy it always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we live for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest EST in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you Ephesians 5:30 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones may God the blessing and reading of his word I like to title this thought this morning the word made flesh uh just to recap from Friday afternoon got a little inspiration and was speaking about the vacant chair I was speaking about the vacant chair which is the chair of honor and Christ has not been able to sit in his own due chair of Honor among all of us as yet but he did set in his chair of Honor in the early church and there he sat in the midst of his people because he was right they allowed him to come into their hearts with no ideas no opinions no imaginations but just Jesus Christ the word of God into their hearts St Matthew 28:18 says all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me so I was speaking about Friday about his lordship he's the the lord of the Earth the Lord of Heaven but uh due to the spirit of iniquity the spirit of unbelief God's Jesus Christ's lordship is not always able to be to be made manifest in the people cuz a spirit of unbelief would work through there and won't allow the word of God to be the Lord of all in his people but God had an early church that he burned every thought out of them by the word for peter said thou alone has has the words of eternal life Hallelujah they were died out think of these people now they were they had they were already saved they were God's people already that's what we can't understand today the Gentiles had to have the spirit in them to be God's people but they were God's people by the word right therefore they were already the wheat word because already and all he had to do was to ripen them himself with his presence to form a rain and then he went and then his lordship was able God was able able to come into their hearts and sit in the vacant chair in the fullness of his holy spirit then that made it possible these people made it possible for his lordship to be effective on the Earth as it was in heaven am though he was rejected by the Pharisees and so forth yet he was reigning in Jerusalem Amen in the apostles in the saints of God there in Jerusalem and also points beyond that Christ had come into them so therefore um but some came in like ananas and saf and didn't know that he was reigning in the church sad to say they didn't they thought it was just Peter himself or James and John and the people there or Steven and so forth they didn't realize that these people were died out to the world they were one in purpose they were one in spirit amen they were one in life they were one in desire they were one with God hallelujah amen and anas and safire didn't have that Revelation because and these Saints being one with God had a revelation that they should sell all that they had by Revelation they had that and when you get it by Revelation then you give it from your heart am but an and saf didn't have a revelation therefore they could not sell all at the head they had to keep back part of the price because they didn't have a revelation amen amen but but the rest of them had a revelation Hallelujah that he was the Lord that he owned their houses he owned them he owned their minds he owned their bodies he owned their Spirits he own everything they had for they gave it to him cuz they had a revelation yes my Lord glory to God that he was the Lord on the earth for all power was in his hands and they gladly gave of their substance to him but sad to say ananas and Safar didn't have a revelation so they walked in there well Peter he's ignorant fisherman and so forth he won't know what we're doing so therefore we'll give just because a part of the price he won't know the difference they didn't know that the Christ was sitting on the throne in Peter's heart think of it the invisible God God Almighty was hid in Peter's heart and when an and fire walked up there they were looking at Peter a fisherman ignant unlearned they didn't see Jesus Christ in Peter's heart who was sitting on the throne and when he walked up Peter spoke out God speaking directly from Heaven used Peter's vocal cords say you have lied to the Holy Ghost me and here and then of course judgment fell upon Him Summary Court Marshal struck him on the spot see when Christ comes in it'll be Summary Court Marshal not to have a trial and go to jail and so forth uhuh right on the spot you're judge right on the spot see so therefore they didn't know that but nevertheless that's how he purified the early church because he was there and when they saw that and now it's been the the the time of by faith telling the people he's here some of them realizing that he really is here in New York my God and fear comes upon Him Rens comes upon him but the others oh that's brother Coman there I can lie to him cuz he doesn't know I'll call up so and so and tell him this we could tell him that that's brother Hunted they don't realize that's the word that's there therefore don't look at me look at Jesus Christ the word of God he's the one who sees you in your bed chamber on your job in your home he's the one who's looking at you his eyes go to and fro throughout the whole world he knows every secret crevice in our hearts don't have fear of me I'm a man I'm a meat man Flesh and Blood have fear of of the spirit of the God of all Spirits amen that's we we need fear again fear of God and reverence in the church see so that church had a revelation that God was sitting on the throne and therefore they turned the world upside down cuz they had a revelation what about today brother if we had the same Revelation the church would be on fire that's right but when there is a breakr the breakdown rather the ministry today and the people themselves and the ministers not allowing the authority of the lordship to occupy the Cher of Honor in our hearts and that's why we don't have the same thing but God's got a few Jesus amen oh yeah he always has a witness that have D out these past few years and they are allowing the headstone Hallelujah the lordship the Lord from glory to come into their heart by the spoken word through the pulpit agreeing with the written word hallelujah he's coming in and the Holy Spirit of them is agreeing right back with it and they're growing in spiritual maturity all the others are sitting around that's a man that's a man that's that's brother Coleman that's brother Hunt they don't catch it but see he's maturing but brother we're looking for this year any time when he will be matured oh brother better get to the hills then he will be matured and then if his word is matured then the fullness of the godhead bodily can come right in here this assembly here and sit down here in this Pulpit here and his eyes go all discernment into everybody's heart and then one thing out of place he'll call it right out Hallelujah cuz he can't stand it my God cuz he's a holy God Hall not now I'm not talking about uh uh the dress not down neatly I'm talking about in the heart I don't mean the dress or the earring I don't mean that I'm talking what's in the people's hearts is what he will call out so now this morning friends let us not fear see let us uh with uh Godly love and let us long for this here well we all want to be in the apostolic church we all say so Lord take us back to the old Landmark well here it is here's the old Landmark Hallelujah now how many want to come down to the water praise our God hallelujah 32,000 give me the water when it put him to the word test 22,000 went away and then the rest even come on down anyway Hallelujah to drink the water but some wanted to to squat down on the knees so delicately like King AAG surely the misery of death is over surely you stop preaching so hard King AAG you know what I mean now Samuel didn't think so brother Samuel say sa why didn't you kill that flesh well I thought maybe you like the best of it you know and Samuel pulled out that sword and hacked him into pieces yeah that's right the king's word so they come on down to the water he says mark them and seal those who slide into the water and lap it up like a dog praise our god do we have any dog lappers who love the word of God this morning we'll slide in now for the water is good amen praise our God that's a little type you know to get you understand what I'm talking about amen amen so now we see then that I trust that we won't have any ananas and safiras in New York City cuz I I I I'm hoping the word has been preached enough to give us all sitting here children also and understanding what had God is fixed and ready to do so there really shouldn't be any you without excuse every one of us for the word of God has been proclaimed here for eight years exactly this same Apostolic Ministry has been spoken right through here to warn us to exalt us to get us ready for the coming of the Lord friends this is not the acceptable year of the Lord that was the first coming this is the second coming the judgment and judgment must begin in his house and this is his house so he'll Purge his house out Hallelujah from the uncircumcised in heart from the Heretics and so forth the worldly ones he purge them right out amen see so now um so I trust that we won't have any ananis and saf fireing here but that's why I'm preaching the way I'm preaching so we won't have any I could uh be like some of the because under the Shepherds and the uh scribes and because Pharisees and bring you a nice sweet message and take you up into the spirit wonderful sing a song that's it but we preach in judgment the word of God Amen but I trust and pray that we'll be like Queen Esther amen Esther believe in her Destiny Hallelujah and she did what she could to save Israel amen Mori said to her and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this and who knows this morning whether we here for such a time as this here to be his bride we we are predestinated to be there somebody is hallelujah but Esther had the faith and when and when Mori the prophet told her what she was there for then cuz you weren't supposed to go into the king without him sending for you but she had to go in there she said well tell everybody to fast three days and three nights and I myself and my Maids will Fast also and so I will go into the king and what is not according to the law if I perish I perish so as we Face 1971 if we perish we perish but let us prepare to walk into his anointing his presence that's what we're here for otherwise might as well stay home amen have the attitude Lord if I perish I perish but Lord God let me come amen pray that you be counted worthy Hallelujah to stand in the presence of the son of man pray that you be counted worthy Hallelujah for his word came forth through a prophet and mercy but his presence is coming down his word is his presence hidden in invisible life that's now but the visible word made flesh in manifestation of every word of God comes out and that's his presence right there quicker than every word amen so now we SE in that for such a time as this here are we finally sold out to this world I mean the Malachi form message has been preached and put on tape prophesied and on the tape and now God has let us sit here for 5 years to see every word coming true for 5 years the message in Prophecy so he he other words it was to be in Prophecy that it had to happen after he was gone so we could see every day things happen that he sent amen he spoke about cigarettes he said it'll be a time when it'll be unlawful 1971 had come to past just month the cigarette advertisement so forth is unlawful now they have stopped it the Prophet prophesied this many years ago that's the word becoming flesh and when the bride sees that made manifest it just goes up again her faith just mounts up amen he spoke it here it is 19 January 1971 he said it would be and here it is now that's the kind of word I'm talking about not coming in here and glory to God and shouting and crying and so forth I talk see that word being made manifest amen that's what gives the bride Joy amen so now are we finally sold out to the world as we enter 1971 have we taken our Nazarite vows for 1971 amen amen see because here was to Samson was a Nazarite vow and here to a woman is a Nazarite vow also and a Nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose to and because two of a purpose and Samson was consecrated to an age that he lived in and to a purpose therefore he had long hair and a woman that's a child of God lets a hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God then the bride to show her consecration for Christ is her glory Christ is her head see she simply believes the word and lets every word to hear grow out in her heart amen every word of it to show she is consecrated to him through the word of God am and the old husband the world they can't get that this nature is your old husband and with those who play around in the world is slopping and kissing and swapping and committing fornication with the other husband do you see it amen do you understand why we belch out and cry out you're committing fornication right now as long as you desire the love of the old husband his kisses are sweeter so they love it but she's dead while she liveth the woman that lives in worldly pleasure with her old husband amen but the Bri she is consecrated to Christ the word and she proves it by living every word and he only told her the past 5 years to come out of the world that's all he didn't lay any greater burden up on us come out of the world he there's nothing going on here we got good jobs and homes and food cars and everything what else they tell us to do I don't know maybe you do amen amen just come out of the world and stop the the things of the denominational spirits and so forth see so therefore the Nazar vow show that she's vow to God so therefore she's like uh the other one there um Rebecca I will go she never saw before neither do we but a prophet brought the word to us we will go with him amen regardless amen for something in the Heart Is there amen praise God hallelujah her beautiful down of his promised word is wrapped around her now she knows that he gave it to her cuz it's his word it's his clothes she's clothed with it vindicating her with himself she is true to him in every point Thank she's a part of the word of God Amen she's vow to Christ and Christ is the word of God she doesn't even take one wink and another man the world that's right amen she doesn't you know cuz you know a woman because you women sitting here you understand if a woman would maybe like a man uh you know his presence she'll show it some kind of way drop a handkerchief or a little smile or something none of that none of that with Christ bride not even one little Indulgence in that not one that's right brother drive this thing down in here not one little you know what why the husband sitting there because right there yeah that's what they're doing I can prove it to you brother BR had the division of uh Miss Jesus name and Miss Assembly of God and Miss Assembly of God was already slick down she was all full of lipstick and everything else and because of short breast because cut here and Mr world on a a top hat and he had like it was gone and the prophet looked back and here come Miss Jesus name and she had on a long dress because high collar see and so forth because long sleeves and Mr world had her but she turned around and brother B looked at it and she was gone so therefore legalism won't do it neither is the word of God every man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that shall proceed forth from the mouth of God other words brother Brandon went down to miss jesus' name in 1963 at Hot Springs Arkansas right where he called our brother Blair right there and there was Miss that was the last group the last time in the prophet could you hear the tapes there hot springs and Arkansas I think it was in June 63 and there was brother brand cuz he had already had division already he was crying out to miss Jesus name one but she went anyway she's gone see for she wanted her denominational husband though she had a long dress and be Bel here still doesn't matter she had a wrong Spirit am amen and that's why we say when you work on righteousness talking against this one and doing that behind the backs that is the wrong spirit and your work of iniquity hiding around and then slipping in here trying to be so holy who you fooling you're not fooling the one whose eyes go to and fro throughout the whole world you may think you're fooling me you ain't fooling me either see me now so therefore but they ain't the bride she doesn't show no signs no emotions to any man the world denomination are you getting it amen the world is the old husband the world and the things of the world is the old husband amen amen amen a denominational Spirit a party Spirit a spirit in your home where you think nobody here knows if your home is all torn up husband One Way wife another way a daughter living in the world talking like the world that's a spirit that's not right in that home who are you fooling you ain't fooling nobody come in here hallelujah playing like you're holy or something you ain't fooling nobody that is the wrong spirit and you're living and slopping and swapping in the world yes sir praise God brother this is the house of God hallelujah for correction for instruction in the way of righteousness hallelujah amen but the bride all praise God for she is absolutely a bride to one bridegroom all her heart her desire her everything is to please her Lord hallelujah like the early church amen she listens only to his word his voice and if a voice comes saying there's no Holy Ghost get behind me Satan that is not my Lord's voice because he's the one that says the promise is unto me and the world everybody else amen and you going to come and tell me in 1970 that there's no Holy Ghost Satan I know you come for as an angel of Light I know that where they come down from uh Upstate somewhere and they are of the Brethren well certain Brethren came down from Jerusalem with a strange Doctrine also oh yeah and Paul had no small dissension right brother he had a strong disputation blasted their hearts and what you get all excited about why are you getting so mad about it that's the devil in your swapping and kissing with it in your homes get that leemon out of there we must come with sincerity with truth as we approach God hallelujah there's no other way amen hallu praise God the bride listens only to the word of God I see people sitting here sleeping H white eyes popping like it's all do the ears do your sleep at home friends go in the back and pray if you go if you have to go to sleep come out here and be wide awake to hear the word of the Lord the bride listens only to the word of God for she is part of the word of God she is true to him in every point I always do the things that please my father amen amen she's waiting for the wedding amen she's been a spouse to Christ she's a virgin in her thinking you get it now the Virgin Hallelujah a virgin in her thinking she thinks Christ not the world the world slips in the seed laying there another man seed the world or denominational seed is laying in her thinking and she's already committed fornication and don't know it blind and don't know it so now this but this beautiful bride she's waiting for the wedding the wedding supper God the the wedding actually the ceremony has been spoken because there was no minister to stand in the Old Testament it was your word I will go there dig ceremony right this so therefore she's waiting to go to the wedding supper up there now she she has been given and been re revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible she know it was his voice for only he alone could open the Seven Seals Hallelujah and she heard the voice of God hallelujah amen now watch she heard and then she entered into 1963 and 4 she entered into the Sean age and then in the Sean age she had to go through a testing and a trying out in the seing age light had to come forth by the word and then she would see the Folly of the deceivers so close it would deceive the very elected ones she sees it with her eyes her inside eye the Holy Ghost and she keeps walking she sees how the world will creep into your home she sees how denominational spirit will move into the church it's a horse or it's a SE and soul some some kind of party Spirit we can be in Oneness in New York we can have a New York Spirit but that spirit in Ephesians 4:3 was poured out in Jeffersonville Indiana the Ling Spirit the word of God then we Endeavor in New York to keep in tune with that Spirit the Holy Spirit if we in tune with that Spirit then God's people around the world we are in tune with them but if we got our own private Doctrine in New York City we are out of tune with that spirit amen though we feel the anoying though we are blessed in everything else that means nothing and now to dig it in it deeper though in our homes we come here and and because hear the word that's in tune with that spirit in Indiana and go to our homes and got another worldly Spirit we're Hypocrites we are impersonators absolutely right that's right cuz we don't have the spirit that said as for me in my house I'm going to serve the Lord hallelujah that's the spirit that's in tune with that Spirit en tyght I'm driving it down now amen than I know where I'm standing on a clear ground for he said break the shackles and the feathers of the people that you associate with so I know what I'm doing amen I know exactly what I'm doing so if you would think that's you talking break the shackles and the feathers of those that you associate with therefore I can't do that but he can but if I allow myself to to to yield to the thoughts of God this morning to break the shackles and Feathers around you you'll be a happy people you'll enter enter 71 with joy in your heart bring it in the sheath praise God you don't like it what can I tell you amen pray and ask God for wisdom that's all Hallelujah so the bride sees that spirit moov that would almost deceive the very elected if possible pious sweet soft and holy don't do nothing wrong you know what you know how I am I'm so humble everything you know people have always taking advantage of me and I don't say that because when I should talk I don't talk or you know you know I'm just so humble and sweet I'm like because brother brandom or whatever kind of spirit it is see you know I'm just sweet as I can be see I'm sweet sweet sweet sweet as he says you know so therefore the bride sees the two Spirits working there's a caral religious spirit from Cain that's moved all the way through the Bible and this spirit that came through the Old Testament came out into the church shouts Praises God speaks in tongues is very very moral don't smoke don't drink where's long dresses and long hair but it's from Cain oh it's from Cain now chew on that one very religious in the message got all the tapes got their books but there's unbelief somewhere sitting there when that word goes out well what he say that for there it is right there amen you want to prove it go downstairs after this message you'll find out who got unbelief go on down go downstairs right now when you finish here and now if you have the spirit of God in you then you know that the word is being spoken is agreeing with the written word and if it's not the written word come in back and tell me so am well then go downstairs now I don't think he was right there well come me back and tell me so but don't have that in your heart I don't want to be called that because was in your heart one day it'll be called out amen now I'm not trying to threaten you now trying to break the shackles and Feathers amen because that is not Christ to say anything see let your conversation be Ying and name you want to get down to the word of God amen amen so by Revelation in obedience this bride lives by faith she sees that old carnal Spirit working through the church just a working way see man now and she just dies out and goes ahead see now this uh the bride the things that that that she cannot explain she lives by faith the things that you cannot explain she accepts it by faith and many of us know we don't know what he said brother Brandon but the spirit of the Holy Ghost accepts it because you know that was the spoken word agreeing with every word written word Jesus Christ son of man coming down in the prophet and speaking the word out and putting on table amen and the brde hears it she don't understand it she don't question it she believe and in in season in time God showers down the light the Revelation comes her stimulated by the wine in the oil glory to God and her muscle grows up she's exercising herself God knows what he's doing am so she believes every word of God she's obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed to her Hallelujah she's watching for she's a part of it Malachi for is the promise the son of man in the form of a prophetic message listen now returning back in his church again in Prophecy He Slipped down in and spoke out through God's prophets mouth prophetic message that would come to pass in ' 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 through 77 their wedding supper amen the Resurrection The Rapture the wedding supper the millennial Kingdom and on into eternity a prophetic message part of it was the future home of the Bride a prophetic message amen amen and it's the word of God that we live by every day and we don't know what tomorrow holds Hallelujah but we know that somebody's holding our hand somebody can lead us on the way somebody's got a hold of us he's L us this far in New York City hallel and he'll take us the rest of the way if we only surrender ourselves Hallelujah to the Living God Amen praise God a prophetic message coming down revealing Hebrews 138 the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram sat on the tape chosen place of worship in Los Angeles because California He said Each angel that was up in the cloud each angel will be one of the the seals of the Seven Seals six Angels came down to his home in 63 each

now Christ was the mechanics and his father was the Dynamics to spark off the word of God that's what's wrong we we've been lacking the Dynamics power to press the word and make it live and here's a thought here from Brother brandom here from the same tape it's time the church should be fully grown now ready to go meet Christ with the manifestation of Every Blessing he promised in the Bible operating in that one great body where he promised to meet the people that's what he said in 65 that's what he said that we should be outside in the church here ready to meet him and he is coming forth in the resurrection and you we have to be ready to meet him when he comes forth cuz he got to sit down in his in his word and bring up the resurrection amen Ephesians 1:10 all the things in heaven he bring with him and the things in heaven is the water the spirit and the blood amen and the original cor wheat he brings it back with him and talking about an adoption talking about a manifestation when Christ was adopted and manifested he had three Heavenly Witnesses and three Earthly ones Elijah and Moses and Christ glorified was the Heavenly Witnesses and Peter James and John and as brother always said hope faith and charity and we hit the resurrection we'll have three Heavenly ones also Luther Wesley and the Pentecostals they'll be right there amen that's right and we'll have and right now we'll have three Earthly ones hope faith and charity three elements that's needed right now in the church three elements and when you see somebody step forward with faith the original Faith signs wonders and miracles Fallen it and love and a hope that know what they talking about is standing on clear ground brother you watching Set Fire to the church amen yes sir so those three elements is needed in the church and coming forward through the adoption and the manifestation of the sons of God do you love him amen are you tired amen well let's go on on and on talking about the Lord hallelu amen praise God so the bride Christ was reigning on the Earth the bride obedient waiting in love for the the prophetic message of the age all the word to be confirmed to her she's watching for she is a part of the word now while watching the message being Vindicated every day as she looks at the world condition she sees the message being Vindicated but now watch she's watching for her life to manifest the word now here has a little teaching here see you can put on your caps amen we want to know how are we his body see so therefore now she has a little germ in her going back at 63 now see she felt it out there she know something happened can nobody tell her different something happened they can have a dry baptism if they want but brother I know something happened to me so I felt it out there and I went through pente cost didn't know that because what it was I was watching and waiting for it and when Mal can for come forth there it is that's it amen all the word to add to it what I felt back there amen praise our God so now the body the bride Ephesians 5:30 members of his body bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and which he is the word is waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive now watch see nor other life will work in her no other life cuz the seed is there and it can only take cell on Cell of the word no denomination of Life won't work man's human opinion won't work go out the Tucson somewhere and do and so forth and so that's a man's opinion I didn't hear the prophet say it are you following me yes opinions ideas imagination or I just feel that this is the way it should be that's not going to work in me brother give the word that's what you feel no we don't go by feelings we go by the word of God amen amen see no other life no other cancer will live cancer is a life isn't it a perverted life so a cancer of some message somewhere a perverted message see and she can come to life any other way yet she felt it the baptism she know it's there and she knows it's going to happen and then when it happens Malachi for she's satisfied and then she makes her vow this is my husband I won't wink slap around make no emotion no this is it he's the one I love Hallelujah she makes a vow she's finished seal right there that's it isn't that wonderful if people had that Faith they not to even worry about nothing that's it h amen that's it so now crucifixion the bride died in Christ died with him in his body at Calvary she's already judged what what are you worry about you were judged in his body at [Music] Calvary the blood come out the water broke Luther the blood broke Wesley the Spirit come the Pentecostal and us but now watch one step further but we are his body this last stage the uh the uh blade was not his body it was all the time becoming like his body the tassel was not his body it was all the time becoming like his body the shook looked all almost like his body with the gifts but it was not his body all the time becoming more like his body but in our age the briad age we are his body am for this is the wheat and the wheat fell into the ground amen then if this is the wheat we are the wheat word no other life can work in it but his very own life his very own word his very own Spirit that's why she had to wait for it praise God so so then she waits she's the M she is absolutely one flesh today the bride is his body and he's the spirit now the father was the spirit in the beginning Christ was the body he changed it over and he and he sent down the Holy Spirit and we become his body amen amen so we are the mechanics and Christ is the Dynamics Christ was the mechanics and his father was the Dynamics there it is Oneness with God amen amen father and son and now husband and wife amen now God created us his own image this image was lost in the Sin of Adam was restored in the second Adam Jesus Christ 2 Corinthians 3:18 we are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord hallelujah and then if the image was lost in 325 ad and the spirit of the Lord shall rais up a standard and come forth His Image was a blade Luther and they was changed from out of Catholicism into the image the blade even as by the spirit of the Lord amen and when they when they walked out to Luther and looked in the face of the word they were changed into a blade then God called the elect Lutheran at the End of the Age out and they changed from a blade and formed a tussel amen then the elect from Wesley was changed from a tassel and actually became Shook and now the elect from the Pentecostal the shook is the shuck open up and inside was a seed amen now this seed inside 1963 or 65 really see said the mve was on for the bride see now the shark is laying all over the world we here we got the sunlight first cuz it come out of the West see and when the sunlight struck a Trinidad the Shar open up and here two sitting right here seeds here amen when it struck Africa Europe shuck open up and the Sea inside got the sunlight amen and the seed just stay right now is a little seed you know what I mean a little seed and the shuck had to stay right with it up to 1970 it's right here but the seed so about 1970 the seed invisible life the life that is hid in God fed by the word amen and this exercise itself in virtue in patience in know exercise himself inside turning from green to a golden brownj inside not made manifest yet but being formed and when they then they begin to see you're about 9 months pregnant but he ain't come out yet but the form is there the seed has turned from green to Brown hallelujah it's there amen praise God still sitting there but now Mary brought forth the manifestation of Christ in the flesh don't miss it this bride will bring forth the Manifest of Christ in spirit it'll be his Spirit but in you being made flesh and when they see you they'll see God the invisible God that was just moving around MDC and in a body was prepared Jesus the expressed image of the invisible God was made manifest through Jesus Christ amen all praise His wonderful name and now that life Christ life in the seed in you turning from green to a golden brown the invisible God word in your hearts pulsating turning aing to his FEI virtue and patience and Temperance and knowl because knowledge and godliness and brotherly kindness God the invisible God ready now matured and ready to manifest itself the express image of Jesus Christ in the bride you see it praise our God even we change even as by the spirit of the Lord and the spirit of the Lord moved down into a tsel and they changed from a blade to a tossle even as by the spirit of the Lord and in Wesley I mean Luther I mean um the Pentecostals in now and the spirit of the Lord has moved across in the latter ring to change from a shook to a seed of God and this life is hidden invisible Life The Invisible God hiding in humility in people here in New York City people all around the world just hiding and they're just walking with a seed you follow me friends trying to make it plain see they're walking with a seed and it's been formed about n years or n months or what it wants to be amen see just about time nine gifts nine fruits amen see just this the ninth year six and nine they hate that you know can't stand the devil it's Revelation amen but the bride knows what she got she's carrying Jesus and she got to be rep inated they call Mary a prostitute that's right can you imagine now Joseph was a husband but she had seed from somebody else amen and your and and she was repudiated in your old world today denomination in the world see me now they will repudiate you also Mary had to go through a whole lot from her neighbors oh yes she did all the young girls there at the water parts and so forth all the women around there she was pregnant and Joseph was not the father and those people didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't understand the promise cuz it was unto Mary and only unto Joseph by a dream yeah not Joseph now get into Mary's position and you find yours today amen amen same position and she it was the word of God though spoken by an Angel Zachariah because what's his name the angel Gabriel rather and it is the word of God today though spoken by the seventh Earthly Angel it is the word of God amen amen and we have received it and we take our vow and we say be un me according to Thy word the word that's all just the word and we are changed even as by the spirit of the Lord Into His Image into his glory just about an hour I'm going to close out now praise our God the early church was this very image of Christ on the earth Oneness of God Spirit life purpose vision and everything else and then we know it was lost in 325 ad but then about that time he began to restore back to image amen see but the fourth stage it went from a blade of tsel and Shar there's people I keep saying back cuz there are those who here who don't understand this you see but the fourth stage is the image wheat we didn't have anything to do with it we just happen to be born here at this time this is the time for the wheat we have absolutely nothing to do with being wheat amen we just happen to be predestinated to be living in the wheat age we were born in the shark age and we come into the weed age by the grace of God Amen amen and God himself has he has a decree that it should change from a shock now to a wheat that's his message and if we are the wheat only one life lives in us the word only one Spirit can come upon us the Dynamics Jesus Christ to make this seed live amen the wheat body word itself and must have his life praise God got something here I wanted to say this bride she is the Masterpiece there's many names for her she's the Masterpiece Elijah in type after he after he gave his message and he said Lord there's nobody here but me and so forth he said I got 7,000 God pulled back the seventh seal and showed Elijah 7,000 by 1964 June brother Ram looked out across the world didn't see nothing America didn't see nothing and that time God pulled back the seven seal and showed him a bride marching amen same Elijah Same Spirit had to see the same secret secret of life hid under the seal amen takes a little time you know see me now am and then she got into the word now watch it is the word that he can work through this bride and make manifest the blade tsel Shar never become seed they all the time become more like the seed but in Harvest time now the seed is back to the Bible back to Malachi 4 back to the promises back to the original is seed time is it wonderful to be living in seed [Music] time seed back to his original condition now watch they say well now we got to wait for the resurrection and so on so it's got to happen this bride cannot grow with a half a seed 3/4 of a seed won't do 99 and 910 won't do one whole seed Christ had to come and give out a prophetic message otherwise the bride could not grow is that right amen and that's what has could come forward not the gifts but the life of the gifts and like I said it was two stages invisible and visible in The Greening stage the green wheat is milky and gummy is not good for the cattle they can't eat it you cannot reproduce it for life because back in the ground amen and you can't make flour out of it what you going to do with it let it ripen amen where you going brother I got a preach this gospel sit down let it ripen Hallelujah God say I can do more in 5 minutes and you can do in 2,000 years sit down and ripen get a have a life for live among your people Minister Deacon Elder live among some people let them see your life first what you mean you got to go all over the world and everything you live among the people oh I got those I'll send them out that's that's don't worry about it but live among the people let the people see the life then you know commend yourself to their conscience amen that's right see day in and day out with the people let them see see and then you'll save yourself in them too amen so now it's only when the wheed is fully ripened that it can be tried to to be every bit of the word as it dries out we can say we flower see me now we can say that but it takes a ripen golden corn wheat that's a little bit wet laying in the 12:00 High sun to dyed right out and we have I believe we have reached that stage right now where the bride is golden brown little bit W but she must be tried in every bit of it to dry as it dries out it proves she's the word amen therefore and who is the word Christ the white horse rider he'll come to her and what's he do St John 5:19 she does nothing except he shows it to her she don't make a move un let she has thus saith the Lord hallelujah or she keeps still that's what I'm talking about oh do you see it friends do you see the where we are in 1971 now I believe that we have reached the seed is ripened and the last bit of life is just about or has left the shuck and when the last bit leaves it's still like this now and see sitting like his here but now when that golden brown seed that for a few days only just about July 1st to about July 7th it dries right out and and put in the CLE quickly there's green tears down in there shoot right up see put it in quickly there'll be a short quick power that'll sweep the land that's right it'll be short quick and Powerful brother it'll be in the power of God it'll sweep out there and gather in the corn Gather in the Sheep bring it in the Sheep amen and just about that time you'll see what happens there that uh when that wheat is golden brown the faith is restored back to it by the fullness of the Revelation that wheat and Chu is like this now say and we sit down inside that weat says I am my father one glory to God I am my father one The Works that I that I do he does also amen amen and then watch the sh pull completely away oh my god there it is you watch it right here in New York City you watch when the faith comes out of here to say I am my father one and walk out among you and prove it thus sayith the Lord you watch the Shu that's sitting there if it's there pull completely away from that there who do you think you are pull away are you spiritual this morning amen it's been spoken now you going to see it you've already seen the manifestation already here last year over 69 got all huffed up and everything blew up like a bull eating buck shot amen praise God so when that second stage the invisible is made visible is made manifest you can see it it says the faith is there I am my father one and the Shar pulls completely away all the life has left the Shar and it's time for the manifestation of Jesus Christ in Dynamics Hallelujah and he takes a quick sweep swing across the world to vindicate the message Hallelujah the larine went out the for marine he comes back in and unites with the latter ring amen and the former ring was discernment signs wonders Miracles casting out devil raising the dead was the former rain upon the Earth and that unites with the latter rain and that proves that the latter rain was the message it pro that was God's move though we had to wait 8 or n years it proves it it vindicates it confirms it amen praise our God I know where I'm standing at brother Hallelujah and it'll be he said it'll just sweep from place to place overnight and it'll be gone that's all yes sir so therefore 7even Church age book page 363 the bride church WIll mature and her ress shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word there it is I say I'm right well he must come down and make an identification with me by means of the word and who is he he is the word word amen praise God Amen I'm going cut off now Hallelujah invisible life green milky fed by the word hid in Christ taking all kind of abuse you know Mary being pregnant and so forth amen hit away see it's all right amen all your srow all your trial shall be over if you suff with me you shall reign with me Hallelujah all praise our God hallelujah brother when the man come forth Mary was Vindicated hallelujah amen that right them that sometimes s in darkness a Dayspring come from on high and shined out and we who sometimes sat in darkness here in leosa the day spring from on high came and shined out and we are walking in the light amen where he's in the light now the visible life is burning shining giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost I'm looking forward to see the invisible seed in me made visible the word made flesh before you amen amen that's right burning shining giv light proven it is Delight the same light that brother random Pro okay I'm going to close out it's hour and 10 minutes I want to finish right here turn to 2 Corinthians 4 do you love him amen I just want to drop the word in here and come back to my text um and this hit for a minute ministers and the bride it is the image of Christ that is to be restored in the ministry and the saints of God and you know the Bible says as the priest so the people youve heard to prophesy all the time you have a certain Pastor he acts a certain way people be acting the same way so as the priest as the people then then God is going to restore back the image of Christ you got to restore back in the ministry and in the people and if the ministry is there they have to bring forth the image of Jesus Christ is that right that's the Bible therefore the image must come through the ministry as it comes to the people if you have a Ministry someone some don't have a Ministry therefore deal directly see he's sing and it's a and our watch the ministry is a means as I said Friday toward an end that's all it is now is only a means toward an end it is not the in in itself as the Antichrist say I got it that's the end and the means but the true minister of God is a means to point you to the end and the end is Jesus Christ maturity in him amen I want make it straight now say so means toward an end now the bride's Earthly goal is maturity the full knowledge of the Son of God the perfect man the fullness of the statue of Jesus Christ is the bride's Earthly goal Earthly go see this is the Earthly end and Destiny of the Bride of the Living Christ now um we know that there's been what's wrong in the message there's been many Pharisee types and unders Shepherds feeding the Sheep on the chaff weak and conflicting utterances and apologetics and human opinions and what they think and all kind of crazy things but the people out across the this country and around the world need to hear the voice of the chief Shepherd the one who spoke through the prophet must come back in the voice of the Archangel which is the voice of the resurrection and speak out through his god-given ministry and set that thing on fire and we'll have acts 15 all over again brother you'll see it happen there's going to be a spiritual clash between the true Minister and the false and the truth shall be on this wise his life shall conform with the word and the the expression of reality shall come forward from him and it will be every bit with the word can you imagine the true men stand up there with this uh God that was in Peter that said why have you lied to the Holy Ghost and and face and an antichrist who said there is no Holy Ghost and face him and he come blast up against that and that Minister say the true one say if I be a Son of God let god in me choose between you and me now who's right oh brother the faith is restored back God is in the man he know knows where he's standing and God is speaking out of his vocal cords and telling the Antichrist if I be a Son of God I am a father one let God choose between you and me now who's speaking it's going to come down to that friends amen all praise His name amen that's hard I know that the M uh gical juices is working over time amen praise the Lord but that's what the word says see so now um uh The Fearless men of God will speak by the mouth of the Lord their vocal organs will be used by God I keep saying back and forth cuz I'm trying to explain to you the voice of the Resurrection is the holy spirit he's got and this is his body I just Pro it to you the word made flesh so he'll come right down in his fullness get into his body and speak out through your course because it's his body nothing unusual or stranger body it's his body He he'll use your ears and nose and everything see it's his not yours you've been bought with a price amen praise the Lord now it's the ministry yet now see the ministry therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have now I'm talking I'm typing this to the ministers and the bride now see the bride has the same ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by man watch by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God because the truth that is taught is to be commended by a life not because I'm ordained by William Brandon oh no but by a life here in the Pulpit here in New York city that is in your conscience in in the sight of God and it's got to be made manifest that ain't got one thing to do with it if I was ordained it's got to be a life so therefore the true Minister will be on this wise there will have been a life that's been lived and God Vindicated amen you'll see the ministry is supposed to be honest because the truth is taught is commanded by the life manifesting the truth to all men in the sight of God not hidden things now secret things of Shame the things men of the world do and are shame to have known think about the church ministers and people disgraceful ways I'll give you a little cornbread Now secret thoughts feelings desires underhands methods and arts that men uh hide through shame dishonestly handling the word of God brother BR said that to that bride I can handle that word oh brother he reveal them seven thund that Bri that can handle the word of God not afraid to call black black and white white but been up here they walking through dishonest trying to tell I'm sweet and all this foolishness and trying to go to the people and don't even believe the word of God and circuit writers preachers and everything else and no Holy Ghost and no ministers what do you think where they stand at and the people love to have it so is aren't they sweet just so meaning so forth we State the truth openly clearly and candidly walk into the ppet say the truth yeah if you told a lie you told a lie period amen no covant at up don't cover up nothing just tell it out tell it like it is you told a lie you told a lie a Lie Is A Lie now a little white lie or black lie or a lie is a lie and a liar has no part in the kingdom of God amen tell it out if you don't he shout it from the rooftops that's right that's right and so we commend ourselves in the sight and the presence of God to Every Man's conscience now there's a word here a manifestation now manifestation over in 1 Corinthians 12:7 writing it down the word is a Greek word of feros which means visible making visible the visible manifestations would be the visible healings visible Miracles visible tongues visible interpretations and manifested prophecies is the word made flesh and the signs the Wonders the Miracles here's because here it is here the word see and when it comes out through flesh it's made flesh you see it are you rejoice in it or you partake of it see me now and Paul he confirmed his ministry manifested the truth by signs wonders and miracles when he preached not in word only but in demonstration and the demonstration in power of the Holy Ghost you the uh 10th verse here always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh there's your promise The Life of Christ in this mortal flesh here now what he's saying here that we should be in a state of of a crucifixion for Jesus so that the resurrection and life of Jesus might be made manifest or visible in our body amen so that the signs that we do will prove the resurrection amen that's what Paul is saying here say now verse 10 Paul is saying here that that's his desire Paul's desire here in verse 10 that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in his body and that should be our desire here 1971 that his life should be made manifest in our body amen now watch verse 11 for we which live and always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh okay Paul is saying this here now God is speaking back through Paul here and telling you this don't worry my bride I shall put you into circumstances where you will get your desire praise our God thanks be to God Hall don't worry about how can I do it if I could just only I will put you in the circumstances when the Press comes down I will lead you I will feed you I will take you myself amen you I might tell you go in this corner and stand there I don't know but St John 59 will show you so there's nothing to do try to get into it you can he must come down and put you into it am amen amen so relax this morning be calm quiet your flesh and calm your spirit amen and get into a peaceful State and let the dove come down he'll lead and he'll lead you to a a a height and depth you never known Before He'll lead you to a faith that you never had before amen so he's saying don't worry my bride I shall put put you into circumstances where you will get your desire where you cannot live anything else but the life of Jesus because you are the wheat word and I will prove that you are flour in other words I'll dry you out and then the drying out will be the ripeness your ripness and when it's really ripe when she comes into the the unity of the faith of the Son of God praise God I'll give out a belch a trumpet F and the dead in Christ shall rise amen and there'll be a uniting up on Earth praise our God but this here must come for this is the word made flesh mechanics and Dynamics this is the Press coming down so therefore like Esther let us believe in our destiny for how do we know for such a time that we're sitting here this morning you believe it friends amen this is the word made flesh let us move into 1971 in full faith and realizing that believing that God will make us manifest as his bride this is not a time to get scared now no sir this is the time to be manifesting the faith that we are the bride who we know it's got to happen so this is my message 1971 to you I believe with all my heart the anointing that came down in the upper room the former rain anointing that anointing came down to nourish the seed and and make it grow throughout the world that was his purpose and Deuteronomy I think 11:14 says that the purpose of the latter ring is to gather in the corn amen so therefore the line had to go out all over the world to gather in that corn is that right and to bring the corn way down in Australia and Africa and South America somewhere the line had to strike it to mature it now she's been maturing she's just about dead right amen and now is time and then Ephesians 1:10 he'll bring all things in heaven all things up on Earth and gather them into one himself God up on the earth for about 30 days or so watch that third pool it'll create on the spot or whatever it is brother how we going to jump over St Mark 16 before we get to there first let's vindicate that we are wheat before we get there amen vindicate that we are wheat by the times fall and then you know it's weak then that is the early church that's the standard right there then they see the standard and the standard is the early church but if it's early church that means that God will be in the church in the Throne of your hearts do you love him will you really serve him is there somebody here who don't understand what's been spoken this morning you don't understand the purpose and if you have a doubt in your heart see me in the back cuz I really don't want nobody to leave here with the wrong idea maybe say or some things was hard or mean or something like this there no they were set for a purpose to break some shackles and feathers in here this morning see what I mean now there are those that's still dipping in the world and so forth we trying to pull them out the world they're sitting right here see that they don't realize it see and but a spirit a spirit covers so you got to shake them loose if you have that Authority if you know where you're standing at I mean therefore there's no fear I have no fear whatsoever I feel I'm directly in the cent of God's will absolutely praise His wonderful name I know in whom I have believed in I believe I have preached his word this morning from all my heart yes am and I love his people that's why I believe I'll go out to get them and I'll show them the word of God not for popularity CU you sure ain't going to be popular talking like this I don't want popularity I want Jesus I don't want money I don't want these ills here and these things here I want Jesus and he is the word amen am let
