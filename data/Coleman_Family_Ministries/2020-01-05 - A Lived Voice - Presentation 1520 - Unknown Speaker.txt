you mix the individually cap semen seals you with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven church ages that he's had seven mysteries it's been sad all day and they thought far to bring back and now the cat stone comes the cap off the church does the thunders mean that my brethren serves is that where we're at so you might have look at this message here your mother and your father and

wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where they will be born again and go all the way up that blood coin right into the Rainbows praise got a many what up the promise look at the smiling faces praise God hey man put you down for huh amen praise God so we salute that message here and the best way we can do it is to believe that message and now it's time for the spirit to fall upon that seed and also today January 6 1991 this is we celebrating our 28th anniversary of this church being an in existence where we started January 6 1962 this is the 28th anniversary of standing for the inspiration of Malachi 4 7 seal message 28 years a time of life God a man we've been right here what life it's always been life in New York City praise God always been a place for people to come the weary praise God and come to the oasis in the desert amen of this wilderness here so on December 30th 1962 I was there and I heard the message serves is this the time after heard that stirring prophetic message I was in all cotton know what the seven thunders was then the Holy Spirit spoke to me these words are the final words of my heart start your church January 6 1963 and so we started I believe brother hunt preached on Esther note I believe that's right I think he did on Esther and ha Kinya service put away Vashti because she wouldn't come to him when he called and so we started with Esther amen praise God and with Mordecai my like hour for telling us how to dress so we would be ready in 1991 praise God Oh hallelujah thine the glory praise God so I thought I'll just read that back on page 47 that's what I come from that's the inspiration that really had me stirred that night amen he said it might be closer than you think it is has got me scared he had me scared oh I haven't done enough where we had time shall be no more he announced that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders oh my god my god they don't even understand it and have we thank God for the inspiration to start a church under the inspiration of the seven thunders praise God and then just on the inspiration then he drops down and reveals it way in 74 1962 praise guy just speaks you believe it see and you go in that inspiration of it and then take a quiz shows of affection and look at their and they're a little bit down there right on here precept upon precept a little here a little there a man but just believe Amen see and then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders well that's very clear we got to build a pyramid such of a perfect man in the people's heart first before they can be capped by the thunders I'm oh hey man and you got a promise page three or four the fourth seal wait to them seven thunders uttered his voices well you gotta be sealed by the word first and the word is the pyramid once you seal with them promises in there then seven thundering voices can inspire you the towers closed Iraq is over there it's only a prelude to the Armageddon and the Prophet said the bride will go in a ratchet before Armageddon praise God so I thank God for that promise ain't nothing left brother amen so mean our pavers are only capped by the seven thunders you remember that pair of balls you got get a little inspiration of it to start reaching that so people this somebody will be ready to be camped is that what I did wrong because I preached for somebody in New York to be ready to be kept by the thunders and took the Statue of proof man and put them seeds in your heart like it cursed for that well I have to be cursed for it amen you remember the pyramid message it's the capstone they are what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual sealed it when we add to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith see what I mean if you don't preach it how in the world can you be kept if somebody don't preach it how can we here except we have a preacher does step out on faith and be cursin revile is safe to preach safe messages in the message for 25 years but they aren't is now there's no anointing with them they were safe amen you gotta step out be called crazy and then you're safe with Christ in the church Manaus we stand here with full faith and confidence even so come Lord Jesus knowing that nothing can touch us not a plague can come pious hallelujah oh praise God we kept adding to it until we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual he capped him in seals and what the Holy Ghost then if that be so he has got seven churches that he has had seven mysteries that has been sounded away and they fought for the ring bang if they had to fight for each mystery how much more do you have to fight for all the mysteries to get it to the people brother brands revealed every mystery we had to fight a man for 17 years Nephi soul he's got there has been sounded away in a fourth war to bring back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church though the thunders mean that my brethren serves that where we are our my inspiration for all these years here is coming from adoption by on page 8 so emphasis here settlers like Joshua positionally you know this judgement after crossing over the land taking the land and he divided the land ephraim and manasseh here just went over here gap benjamin there he divided the land and Josh were not knowing this but my inspiration the letter the Holy Spirit after being into the Promised Land give each man his promise and exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there now how that God has said in the church through labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes I remember this now it's on the tape this morning page 12 13 and 14 and then you don't understand me when the church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world breathe on the Lord Jesus that the problems the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Pentecost how the air it is labor pains how they groan and cry and their labor pains how brother Coleman had a revelation of perfection how he groaned cried travail sixty four five six seven seventies eighties groaning travailing you didn't understand him because God was using the body to groan [Applause] trying to label things but when they were born and positionally born into the kingdom of God born birth faith positionally born charity stealing your for adoption you got it into the king of God then the Holy Ghost has said in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors some evangelists then he's given to the speaker with tones interpretation knowledge wisdom gifts of healing all kinds of miracles and so definitely the healing and also brother Graham said when I'm against all gonna has religion he said what is the greater gift other than healing he said wisdom the wisdom of Revelation to put the Word of God together to show the church where the head then comes the hard case is praying for the sick when you find out where you are you may pray for the sick [Applause] men didn't know who Christ was it wasn't sure they know he was anointed but maybe was hearing my answer all promised anointed word Amen hallelujah and what's on Peter he back slid later on son this is not on brother Coleman he never said it he's got a revelation like Peter got a revelation so hear me on tape the son this is not on me the son is Jesus Christ hear me and if you pick up this tape brother the seven thunders is Jesus Christ's upon the raca this revelation I'll peel my spoken word bride and she'll help us sayeth the Lord hallelujah you may be seated not a confession him being the son of God because they knew he was a son of God Peter just said it but what it was the revelation had been revealed from heaven that's what it is and the thunders will be revealed from heaven the people sitting in here they'll get quickened and filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah that's what it is it'll change them hallelujah it'll put him in the kingdom of God without that they cannot even see the kingdom God can't even understand the kingdom of God there's a vision of a possibility that God moved one more time you believe that now seeing the prophet of God said when Sampson Amen was done praise God and the Philistines was so drunk they didn't notice that he was
