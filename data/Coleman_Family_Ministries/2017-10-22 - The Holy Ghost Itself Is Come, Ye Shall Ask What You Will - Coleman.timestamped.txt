[1:54] standing in the room I I just had a
[1:56] marvelous testimony given to me about a

[2:29] like the color of a rainbow like came
[2:33] right
[2:33] over the the head of the Lord
[2:37] Jesus and uh well she watched it for a
[2:39] few
[2:40] moments and she went and told her sister
[2:42] the way I understand the story and they
[2:45] come and Marvel at it for a long time an
[2:48] hour or something and then they called
[2:50] and a neighbor Minister which was
[2:52] brother Stricker over here to see the
[2:54] phenomenon of it and they sat and
[2:57] watched it until 5 something like like
[3:00] that and the minister was asked to pray

[3:04] or something in a little bit somebody
[3:07] give a
[3:08] message somebody had to say something
[3:10] about it and they had been given their
[3:12] interpretation of what it meant and the
[3:14] message came back through the speaker in
[3:17] uh through the speaking in the message
[3:19] and said they had misinterpreted they
[3:21] hadn't given it right I think that's
[3:23] right is the sister Bruce they hadn't
[3:26] give it right said that what the sign
[3:29] was was to show them like appreciation
[3:33] of them that they had believed the
[3:38] message they had believe the message so
[3:42] God appreciated the fact that they
[3:44] stayed
[3:46] on and gave a
[3:48] [Applause]
[3:50] sign amen because you believe the
[3:55] message amen and then somebody tried to
[3:58] get in there with the wrong
[3:58] interpretation
[4:00] praise God they had believe the message
[4:03] that's going forth here from the
[4:05] Tabernacle like that and said they were

[49:43] perfect praise God Amen and another
[49:48] Foundation scripture before I get to the
[49:50] next one was uh Hebrews
[49:53] 1132 through 40 and I'll just read uh uh
[49:56] 40 and um um verse 39 and
[50:01] 40 let me hit on Motors
[50:05] now are you
[50:08] offended oh praise God we so
[50:11] quiet
[50:14] amen amen verse 39 all and these all
[50:18] have attained a good report through
[50:19] faith they are good report through faith
[50:22] receive not the promise God have
[50:24] provided some better thing for us that
[50:25] they without us should not be made
[50:27] perfect see why these scriptures was
[50:28] down in the foundation now you get it
[50:31] these people who died in here are
[50:32] depending and waiting on us so this
[50:34] church has got to come to perfection in
[50:36] order to bring the
[50:38] resurrection Perfection to bring the
[50:41] resurrection and the under Souls under
[50:43] the altar waiting for this church this
[50:46] church here to come to its Perfection
[50:49] but when Christ does come this church
[50:51] you see is coming small in the minority
[50:53] is a whole lot sharper than that but
[50:56] like just like like I uh write that
[50:58] cross there is it's coming up to a
[51:00] needle point until the church in the
[51:02] minority is has got to get to a place
[51:06] until it's the same kind of Mery that
[51:09] just left well Christ left that little
[51:11] Holy Ghost Mery with the with the alpha
[51:13] bride and we got to go back with the
[51:16] alpha word to become the alpha
[51:18] bride with the same anointing cuz that
[51:21] was in Peter they took note that that he
[51:24] had been with Jesus amen HJ
[51:27] amen because when this headstone comes
[51:29] back it's got a pocket where he got to
[51:31] sit right in there and you know it's it
[51:33] just as a camp that sits across the top
[51:35] it's a little flange it's got to sit on
[51:37] there because it sheds the waters and
[51:38] when it comes the church has got to be
[51:41] hone and all these Restless stones of
[51:43] the pyramid are laying so perfect in
[51:46] till you can't run a razor blade between
[51:48] them weighing tons laying in there have
[51:51] uh how they got them up that uh they
[51:53] don't know but they were built and up
[51:55] here when the when the when the pyramid
[51:57] Camp does come the pyramid itself the
[51:59] body of Christ will have to be hone not
[52:01] only just to some just some Creed
[52:04] Doctrine or something you got to come
[52:06] through it will have to be so perfect
[52:07] like Christ till when he comes he and
[52:09] that ministry will fit right smack
[52:13] together then will come the Rapture and
[52:16] the going
[52:18] home so this lays in front of the New
[52:20] York assembly so we ain't got no time to
[52:22] fool around and and play
[52:25] Church praise God God page 65 so
[52:29] therefore are you contend for the faith
[52:32] that Malachi 4 has has uh
[52:35] delivered and he says add to your faith
[52:38] virtue and to your virtue knowledge and
[52:40] to your knowledge Temperance to your
[52:41] Temperance patience to your patience
[52:43] godliness to your godl brotherly
[52:44] kindness to your brotherly kindness love
[52:46] the Holy Spirit and Christ will come
[52:50] after brotherly love then the Holy
[52:52] Spirit then Christ comes because just
[52:55] beneath him the Holy Spirit up at there
[52:58] at the top SE is the spirit of Christ
[53:00] into each Age spirit of Christ into the
[53:03] church to manifest the
[53:06] virtues so you see and on page 61 some
[53:11] people don't know that the virtues was
[53:12] in the early bride it was down in there
[53:14] that's why it came up out of there you
[53:16] find on page 61 I can imagine them
[53:18] Apostles never acted like us they went
[53:20] around probably man a few words until
[53:22] they got in the Pulpit they walked in
[53:23] they did what they were supposed to do
[53:25] and they walked out that's what I'm
[53:27] going to do from here on praise God if I
[53:29] got to see you in the room I go in the
[53:30] room and see you and I'm walking out
[53:32] amen yeser they walked in they did what
[53:35] they had was supposed to do and walked
[53:36] out they didn't let nobody question them
[53:38] God told them to do it yes sir they had
[53:40] power they had virtue they had no
[53:42] argument with man they knew where they
[53:44] stood that's all they knew who they
[53:46] believe they kept on walking in the
[53:48] spirit amen just I said the other night
[53:51] one little nod that's all God had to do
[53:54] uh then nothing's going to stop them
[53:55] they didn't question study hum H weary
[53:58] like we do whether they should do this
[54:00] whether they should do that or go to the
[54:01] elders and ask the ELD what should I do
[54:03] they went ahead and did it anyhow just
[54:05] one little nod from God that did it this
[54:08] is it why how could they know it was a
[54:11] nod from God they had all these virtues
[54:14] in here all these
[54:16] qualifications way down in the ground
[54:19] the alpha
[54:21] bride and Malachi for come to restore it
[54:24] back
[54:26] so what's so strange about the Statue of
[54:28] a perfect man when the first bride had
[54:30] the same
[54:33] thing they had them all in there these
[54:35] qualifications and the first little nod
[54:37] of God compared with every bit of this
[54:38] and with this word they knew it was the
[54:40] word of God all in a way they went they
[54:43] didn't have to worry about nothing else
[54:44] when God spoke they
[54:50] went oh Hallelujah I should be finished
[54:52] by now so you add to your faith The
[54:55] Headstone is the holy ghes Christ and we
[54:57] have to be magnetized to it to be in
[54:59] Rapture oh church it's time to get an
[55:04] action GL you believe

[55:28] that people will be flying in from
[55:29] Europe to see what's taking place they
[55:31] say there's a place in Arizona called
[55:34] Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix
[55:36] allow me to say New York
[55:38] City there's something broke out there
[55:41] until the seven thunders of Revelation

[55:49] end time is

[1:00:48] with
[1:00:48] smoke and now here's here is a vision
[1:00:52] here here is cu the the effect of the

[1:00:58] undone because I'm a man of unclean Lips
[1:01:02] This is a prophet he wasn't gossiping
[1:01:05] around and telling lies now he's just a
[1:01:07] man of unclean Li associating with King

[1:01:17] people of unclean lips for mine eyes

[1:01:24] having alive cold in his hand which he
[1:01:27] had taken with the tongues from off the
[1:01:29] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:01:32] said Lo this ha touched thy lips thine
[1:01:36] iniquity is taken away and thy sin is
[1:01:39] purged also I heard the voice of Lord
[1:01:42] saying whom shall I send and who will go
