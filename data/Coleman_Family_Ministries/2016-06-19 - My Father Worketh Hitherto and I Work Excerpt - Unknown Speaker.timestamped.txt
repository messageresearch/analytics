[0:00] now subject tonight is Wil thou be made
[0:02] whole amen this was an invitation asked
[0:05] about 2,000 years ago by Jesus to the
[0:08] this lame man here as he walked upon on
[0:10] him now note the difference here in St
[0:14] John 56 he's asking a question W Thou
[0:17] made whole he's asking a question of
[0:19] Faith now he's saying do you really want
[0:21] to be made whole to this lame man now
[0:24] he's speaking about a a resurrection
[0:27] power to make him whole now there was
[0:30] potent folk laying here waiting for
[0:32] healing because because for their bodies
[0:34] and their souls they were weak and
[0:36] sickly and also helpless and they were
[0:38] blind and halt other words because lame
[0:41] had to stop and then sit down rest and
[0:43] then get up and walk again and they were
[0:45] with it paralyzed or shrunk and so forth
[0:48] and they were waiting for the moving of
[0:50] the water and God had always sent a a an
[0:54] angel down to move the water and when
[0:56] the angel dipped in and moved that water
[0:58] they could step in there and they could
[1:00] be healed and and God has done the same
[1:03] thing through the seven Church ages he
[1:06] sent angels to move the water amen
[1:09] arenus and polycarp and St Martin they
[1:11] moved the water and those who stepped in
[1:14] they were healed spiritually and also
[1:17] physically amen and God sent a seventh
[1:19] angel to a lame Hulk blind miserable
[1:23] with it paralyzed church and that
[1:25] seventh angel move the water and praise
[1:29] God uh we come down there a little lame
[1:32] amen not necessarily uh because as worse
[1:35] off as a as many people but we came
[1:38] anyway so what was it it was the
[1:39] heavenly father sending the word in
[1:42] perfect obedience to get one
[1:45] predestinated seed that's all it was and
[1:48] here he comes on down there to this
[1:50] sheep gate and so now the angel come at
[1:53] a certain season and and whosoever first
[1:56] after the water was troubled stepped in
[1:58] he was made whole you had to step into
[2:00] it now you had to get in the water see
[2:02] amen you had to get in the word not half
[2:04] out and half in get in amen see don't
[2:08] hang outside hang inside but get in the
[2:10] word praise the Lord see now um as the
[2:15] word as the word approaches the man in
[2:17] perfect Obedience of the father and the
[2:19] helpless man he says to him wil thou be
[2:22] made whole and the helpless man said I
[2:24] have no man to put me in I'm not strong
[2:27] enough always got some excuse you follow
[2:29] me now it wasn't because too much wrong
[2:32] with him brother BR said because he may
[2:33] have because he may have had a prostrate
[2:34] or something see now but God sent Jesus
[2:38] to him nevertheless he was predestinated
[2:41] he was the one amen praise God you are
[2:44] the
[2:45] ones you're the ones I don't care what
[2:47] you feel like but you're the
[2:49] ones amen it's you it's nobody else if
[2:52] if if they if it was them they would
[2:54] they would be here tonight and you'd be
[2:55] outside so therefore the fact that
[2:57] you're here you must be the one
[3:00] amen I mean God knows what he's doing
[3:02] doesn't he I mean he wouldn't get the
[3:04] wrong one he knows who you
