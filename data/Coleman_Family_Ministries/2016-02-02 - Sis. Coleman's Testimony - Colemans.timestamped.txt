[0:23] tonight as brother come and told you
[0:25] last night my cousin was here and he's a
[0:27] Jehovah Witness and I mean when we hear
[0:31] what they believe which and have no
[0:34] promises nothing they don't even believe
[0:36] in healing of the body they believe that
[0:37] the devil heals you if you're healed
[0:39] that's that's a trick of the devil and
[0:41] how today the people are so very much
[0:44] deceived that I mean I have we have a
[0:47] terrible burden for him and for all
[0:48] those people that are lost but yet in my
[0:50] soul is a praise and a great joy in my
[0:53] soul for the truth that that the Lord
[0:56] has seen fit to reveal to us his people
[0:59] that he is alive today and that he's
[1:01] healing people and that there's a a
[1:02] fountain filled with blood that flows
[1:04] from Calvary to that I know that in this

[1:21] any millionaire in the world and I'm
[1:24] going to end to that Kingdom there's no
[1:25] doubt about it nobody can come and take
[1:27] my place this morning and that's why I I

[1:56] world to know the world is invol he has
[1:59] chosen to call
[2:00] and the Lord is Blessing even last night
[2:02] an elder came here from one of the
[2:04] denominational churches and there are
[2:06] people folks that are hungry for the
[2:08] word he has heard that word and he's
[2:10] hungering for it and when I see that
[2:12] appetite in him as we looked at him and
[2:15] Oh Glory to God how we must pray for
[2:17] these people that they might be born and
[2:19] sheep how he has that taste and how when
[2:21] brother Hunt brother Coleman was giving
[2:23] out the word through the spirit of the
[2:24] Lord how he was eating that word and a
[2:26] little young man his name is Abraham was
[2:28] here I was like everyone that pray for
[2:30] them uh by the grace of God that they
[2:33] would even hunger more that God would
[2:36] put up more thirst in them for the word
[2:37] they actually admitted that they just
[2:39] don't have any word in the church
[2:40] there's nothing there and how when they
[2:42] hear this little word how how they're
[2:44] just feeding on it and how oh my brother
[2:46] Coran says how those muscles just begin
[2:49] to start to grow to God I'm happy this
[2:53] morning you can say anything you want
[2:54] about me but sister Coleman means to go

[3:06] you two three years to name but glory to
[3:09] God by the grace of God who died for me
[3:11] oh he's going to cleanse me he's going
[3:13] to make me ready to get away from this
[3:15] place oh God I can oh pray for me I want
[3:19] to make it there nothing here nothing
[3:21] just all the what he's got laid up for
[3:23] me my heart just show it's just
[3:25] overflowing with praise for him oh God I
[3:28] pray that we all will be overcome is
[3:30] that none will have to stay here in this
[3:32] this world that's void of anything cuz
[3:34] it's going to be desolate before any
[3:36] before soon I believe that so pray much
[3:39] for me that I might please the Lord I
[3:42] might be in his will in this last and
[3:44] evil day when oh God the devil goes
[3:46] around just like roaring as he's got my
[3:49] family this my cousins how he's got them
[3:51] deceived believing a lie that God is not
[3:54] alive that he doesn't heal when we we
