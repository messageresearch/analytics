[1:07:23] a disgrace some of them run out into
[1:07:25] eternal security some run out into
[1:07:27] everything but the true message of Grace
[1:07:29] Remains the Same and there is where
[1:07:31] Satan tries to knocking out from under

[1:15:52] know why because I can't go any further
[1:15:55] amen I'm I'm gone a God in Simplicity
[1:16:00] 35 now you see while it was in a simple
[1:16:02] way and everybody against him everybody
[1:16:04] was at his throat all the Ministerial
[1:16:06] Association everything else was at his
[1:16:07] throat that's true trying to get rid of
[1:16:09] him and everything else but in that
[1:16:10] Simplicity even though they had no
[1:16:13] cooperation with his campaigns and
[1:16:15] whatever more they had everybody thought
[1:16:17] he was a crank God was hiding himself
[1:16:20] but when it come time watch for that
[1:16:22] seed to get ripe that had been planted
[1:16:26] this the time for that
[1:16:29] seed huh see see when that seed to get r
[1:16:34] that been planted see God manifested
[1:16:38] himself by sending fire out of
[1:16:41] Heaven yes
[1:16:43] sir God hiding in Simplicity and then
[1:16:46] revealing himself again it pleased God
[1:16:48] to do that God hiding in Willam brandham
[1:16:52] in
[1:16:53] Simplicity and then speaking through
[1:16:55] Willam brandom the word God and then
[1:16:58] hiding that word in you and me in
[1:17:01] Simplicity but then ready to reveal when
[1:17:04] it gets
[1:17:06] rape when it gets rape sends fire out of
[1:17:09] Heaven fire baptism to burn that seed up
[1:17:13] praise
[1:17:14] God yes
[1:17:17] sir God hiding suppity and then
[1:17:19] revealing himself again it pleased God
[1:17:21] to do that he's always did in such a way
[1:17:23] now we find out that he promis these
[1:17:24] things the troubles today so many of us
[1:17:26] people we want to get so you know
[1:17:28] Seminary denominational educated minded
[1:17:30] that God can use as God can give a man
[1:17:33] to start do something give him a
[1:17:34] Ministry the first thing you know he go
[1:17:36] to catering to what others say you see
[1:17:41] so I don't do that I stay with what he
[1:17:42] tells me amen that's the Ministerial
[1:17:45] Association see what others say and the
[1:17:48] first thing you know he'll get all
[1:17:50] wrapped up in a big bunch of stuff and
[1:17:52] then God just takes his hands off him
[1:17:54] and let him alone then he'll try to find
[1:17:56] him another man somebody that will do it
[1:17:59] he's got to find something that will
[1:18:00] take his word will take the divine
[1:18:03] revelation and won't move with it but
[1:18:06] stay right there on that word that's the
[1:18:09] way he does it he's always done it that
[1:18:11] way so when a man gets so educated and
[1:18:14] smart till he tries to put his own
[1:18:16] interpretation well like they say the
[1:18:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll say oh
[1:18:20] that was for another day but if they
[1:18:22] don't well it it wasn't for another day
[1:18:23] but I'll tell you it don't come just
[1:18:25] like it did on the day of Pentecost we
[1:18:27] received the Holy Ghost when we believed
[1:18:29] and all kind of stuff like that you see
[1:18:31] and talk about the baptism in jesus'
[1:18:33] name and the Bible teaches that way they
[1:18:35] say well but the Seminary say so and so
[1:18:37] that's compromising God can't use a
[1:18:40] person like that now watch he may let a
[1:18:42] man be beat all across the country like
[1:18:44] that and a Man cast out and laughed at
[1:18:48] and made fun of and everything else like
[1:18:50] that but when that real Showdown comes
[1:18:54] amen God stands up and vindicates
[1:18:58] himself right in the same
[1:19:01] Simplicity oh who do you say this is
[1:19:04] praise God my God my God so you stay
[1:19:08] with that
[1:19:09] word though it's simple and don't seem
[1:19:12] like nothing but my God the creator of
[1:19:16] this universe of the whole thing is in
[1:19:18] you in
[1:19:19] Simplicity oh you're somebody you miss
[1:19:23] Jesus Christ oh cuz the real Showdown is

[1:19:32] today we got doctors of divinity we got
[1:19:35] great men all over the world that's

[1:19:39] now watch it takes a Simplicity of
