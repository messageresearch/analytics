TRANSCRIPT
========================================
reading from judges the seventh chapter then add ruble who is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early in pitch beside the well of hey rod so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley and the Lord said unto to Gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands lest Israel want themselves against me saying mine own hand have saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead in their return of the people twenty and two thousand and they remain ten thousand and the Lord said unto Gideon the people are yet to many bring them down onto the water and I will try them for the air and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon everyone that Lapith of the water with his tone as a dog Lapith him shall sit by himself likewise everyone that bowed down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that left putting their hand to their mouths were three hundred men but all of the rest but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their needs to drink water and the Lord said unto Gideon by the three hundred men that lamp will I save you and delivered a mini nice into thy hand and I let all the people go every man to his place so the people took victuals in their hand in their trumpets and he sent all the rest of his for every man to stamp and retain those 300 men and the wholesome medium was beneath him in the valley made a lot of a blessing to the reading of his word thank you so now I like the title this little thought the word test missus this morning lays in this thought how God prepares his people for battle and we read from these scriptures here to draw context the context of it rather as we read it many of us have ready four years and been over but I pray this morning that the Holy Spirit would glean something from here this morning praise the Lord to be a little gleaning in here somewhere and we could get a handful of barley this morning praise the Lord so now we find out this that obedience to his word he calls his people by obedience to his word he selects entrains his people by obedience to his word he separates by obedience to his word we fight the battles we can only fight by obedience to the Word of God and by obedience to his word we win the battles most important of all now judges 7 shows how God used the water which we know always types the word to test the people to be used to fight the battle now there was going to be a battle the many nurse was swarming all over and it was about their season in God he is the one who fights the battle and he had to have his people in battle ray according to his will and his word and just because you have a whole lot of people that doesn't mean anything see it's those that he has called out and trained him and tried them his way and it could be woman one can chase a thousand can you imagine what because three can do you can have a whole multitude if you have thirty thousand and twenty nine thousand don't believe everything so you still only got one so it's only in those who believe and obey obedience is better than sacrifice so now in judges seven here we know that we all are in battle see if we're being trained but the great battle to stand against Goliath is nearing and how much near is it and God has not called us out of the world and different churches just for north he's call us out for a specific reason here in the last days when we have got to know how to fight and that's why the messages to go forth all the time but now God shows in this chapter here how he calls his people regardless of what they think or what they feel or who do they think they are but this is the way he does it he hasn't changed so now he used the water to test the people to be used to fight the battle he used the water before in Noah's time if they would get into the ark to escape the water he also uses the water back in Moses time if they would go into the Red Sea according to the Word of God and escape because Egypt you also use the water right here in acts 2:38 and then it won't be baptized in the water just the Word of God see but here he used the water which we know is the type of a test now to start with there were 32,000 or Israelites these were not because unbelievers these were church people they were all supposed to be saved we are of Israel we have salvation we are of God but that was too many Oh God knows the hearts God has got to get the real believers who really believe just in a simple matter of brother Christ granddaughter bawling head and pray now how many people we're gonna do that say just believe that's all don't try to question them because I'll figure out just believe what the man of God is saying to you so now we find that there was 32,000 of them we just read here and it was this was a church now I'm typing this morning over to our day over here now notice he gave them not Gideon the Lord did he gave them the word test see to separate them and to try them now oh I want to read something to you here it's only one they don't want to read from a spoken word book this morning on page 10 god of this evil each I'm reading from a page 9 and 10 now last week page 8 9 10 mostly on page 9 last week ins in Matthew 24 it was the most deceiving age of all ages all the ages of deceit from the Garden of Eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elect it sing now just a cold formal starchy churches and so forth or man-made theology that wouldn't the elect would never pay no attention to that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do promise of the age to age see very great time Christians everywhere take heed to their hour we're living markdown and read and listen close what would God call a people out of this evil age for his name now here's the reason why are you being caught has the answer right here the reason is the reason it is is to try her his bride its to when she is made manifest been tried is proven proved to Satan and Satan's into false anointed ones trying to get her off the word but when she stands with the words she's proven to Satan who she is Annie and God just like Joel he lists Satan have his way with her he's past 9 he has to have your way with her Satan see but she won't take her because you're only proven her and all these things that happen to because come against it it'll just be tests that's all see now so um to try her when she's made manifest been tried is proven prove to Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end now as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of it but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground and the same way to see the deceit fell in the ground in Eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell to a denomination at Nicaea Rome it ends up in a super organization just as the seat of the church fell back there with the science one is in the living Christ among them it ends up in the last days under the Ministry of melikhaya for and restores back agenda original faith that was once given and may we understand what he's talking about the seed every seed that is here in the in turn was planted in the book of Genesis and then every seed of us in Genesis must be out on the earth now but deceive could only flourish and ripen in the last days when the book of Revelation would open up because that itself is the harvest and it would take a prophet William Branham Malachi 4 to open the book of Revelation and then when the book is opened up then if we are in the harvest time and then all the seeds that was planted in Genesis we with our eyes see these seats walking living breathing on the earth and that's why you people see these sodomites out here these filthy dirty low-down women with these ungodly clothes on you see them out here and these sodomite men with the hair down the neck look like perverts those would have seized that was in just as 18 down in Sodom and you saw that it is in the beginning so shall it being in and Malachi 4 come and open up the harvest book every seed it was planted back there the life of their seed would come all the way down through the times all the way through the parameter you would follow the life of Cain the life of the son of mites you see it because as you read the Bible you see it here you see it there you see it here but in the last days in holidays we'll see it live it and breathe it in moving around and it's fully ripened fully filthy and there's nothing left for it but the fiery hell of God's Word that's all his left of it as long as left forward rather and then the seed of the believer the life of that seed which was the life of the early church which was about nineteen hundred years ago what was the life it was the life of Christ in early church that church went down into the ground which serves wonders miracles and our life of Christ then that seed according to the Bible would go through a church age seven church ages and it would come up in the book of Revelation and then no no notice the seed is the original length then the life of it goes through but when he hits the book of Revelation he comes back to see time not just the life moving through as a ship because it's shocking a bleached and so forth see that's only the life moving through it but in our day the seed that was in the beginning moves through the church and comes out as the same seed again then if it's the same the same life that was in the one in the beginning before this is Sita when everything's made manifest and if he planted a seat over a holy church or glorified Church upon earth it had to pass through Luther Wesley be dependent console age there he comes back handy in this is the time when we expecting to see the same church again because it's a seat time and see turn is that you could take the same seat and planet water it planet water bring forth bring forth bring forth the sea but you couldn't do that with Luther and Wesley and the Pentecost because it was not seed time it was just life moving through it did we get that praise the Lord now we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve so God permitted the collimation of the evil age to begin about 1963 and all of us know that and all the spirits of Sodom that came up through the four Beatles over in England came out with the long hair in Elvis president he started himself really back in 1954 sold with Milton Berle become on television and that was a sex symbol of male sex symbol shaking his body and singing to rock and roll songs all acres here and how you know the stories of the young girls who just gave their clothes and ripped themselves now and run out for this six male symbol see it's a devil yeah that's the way it was in the beginning and it's gonna be a same way here in the end in that same spirit we're trying to move into the church and get up on the sisters of God and tell us sisters raise up your just a little bit make it nice and tight and also reveal early because you have to find a husband maybe well husbands not looking for sex Queen because there's many honesty there would far outstrip you out there he's looking for our daughter of God he's looking for a saved sanctified Holy Ghost a woman kneeling for sex queen so they need the way to do it the way I do is to manifest Jesus Christ phrase Oh God and then in such a daze is here the great intellectual age would move in against a ministry through popularity morning and women and try to destroy the ministry and I will tell my wife this morning are totally yes they are said Elena think we would be insane if I didn't see one man living here in the end time William Brennan if I didn't see a life and hurt a man stand on the Word of God with principle and stand for it all the days of his life in the ministry and because as a Christian I think we would have nothing there the foundation would be destroyed and there would be no hope but we saw such a one God sent him Meraki for and you know I can have confidence because he tied the people of God and he brought them under the condition of the Word of God in every man is a follow regardless of mother father sister brother affiliations of whoever they are cause no respect of persons is to bring those people on the conditions of the I should be able to you know after all because you have if you stand stand with the sword join you get so sick you see wishy-washy and china reason out well maybe this is because this maybe not there's unbelief stay on the Word of God God and spoke it so shall it be praise God we find out on this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve she is not that type of a woman and the carnot because he caught Eve and told her you'd like to be wise know how to bring life through sex and Eve tasted it was good and so is it today you knows how sex is tied into education town right together they go hand in hand the coeds know you know what's happening you know the dormitories the Soph was tied together you see now she will be tried by his word the bride as Adams bride was tried by the word and Adams bride believed every bit of the word all but confusing one promise then he's the same yesterday today and forever are you confused about Hebrews 13:8 concerning your daughter in your son that he's able to give them the holy goes to or you confuse them up it's by or you give it in so well my little daughter with my son after all let him go with the long hair and this and that are you confused on that he's the same that's a promise yesterday today and forever bring him on the condition of the word of God in your home kick out the TV the rest of it just business here here so you saw this here thrown out the house bring them under the condition of the word shoo-shoo a stance with me in my house we're gonna serve the lord or you won't see what the mouth or you can leave it in your heart this is that day praise our God now but fail on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face-to-face brother all children today face fifty terms the temptations that you faced and I faced and I'll know they do it I'll pray for my daughters and I thank God that they are moving away they are moving and we know that they are facing do you realize that that the devil out in the street in the schools where they're going they are facing the devil face to face your poor little children and inhabit you move but they you got a promise you have the promise has promised and God will perform it for it is the Word of God you've got to do it otherwise they'll be gone praise God I think our boss just a singleton sitting here we all know the story here it was it looks so terrible and black how is it now her daughter it's even gone here the baby's growing up praise our God she held on to the promise of God and I delight to look at a seer here a nice young lady praise God hold on hold on to the promise of God God knows ain't no case that's too hard for God nothing is too hard for him [Music] [Music] but you promise for about ten years now in 1863 1970 was about ten years of us amen and I'm reminded that when a larger first marry Deacon Alicia and he saw him and he threw Lula goes over him after she tasted of the baptism of the Holy Ghost rather he went betting sacrifice with his parents and he fathered a larger and allowed as that gold back into your church whatever I had to do a pave has a Lord God live and will follow you and then they say what Bob Arum say go back see go back if you saw Dana go back but brother at that after they were swept over you you can never go back you can preyus car they said well he said looking for Eddie trees until he said go back so Oscar I've got out here and get some souls that's a lie of the devil you'll get nothing out there but sin and temptation all the days of your life praise God and he lies you come on down we all pass Gilgal Beth Ellen and Jericho the sons of the Prophet they're [Music] [Music] [Music] in he had [Music] I sure was ready here I sure was right he was tried tempted tested and he was ready to receive the full of the Spirit of God but if you go there still looking like the school of the process perhaps it over on the mountain over there or he's over here but he larger one chef saw Elijah go and he knew he well then if you know if he left he said that he that believeth in me though works that I do shall he do also because he's seen him go and they Jesus Christ his disciples saw him go up and a new way is pulled to fall upon him unless you had that conviction unless you really believe nothing fall upon you well a lot of confusion and he kept his eye on the promise now he had tasted of the robe he grew into the robe he wrapped a rolled the promises of it the Holy Ghost is here he wrapped it all around him but that still wasn't enough we are wrapped in virtue in patience in umbrella kindness godliness we have wrapped ourselves in this message which is the role his message was the Holy Ghost and you wrapped in it the sentence and that's what is true enough for he was coming new water again coming down for the test can you pass over and tell her the order was a school of the prophets they was all waiting to see what the critics were down there in every picture must pass through the whole of the critics and you afraid to be criticized you're free for the person to come and show you an area of length that needs to be straightened out in your life are you afraid to be criticized by the pastor or do you run all up like a devil when the word comes and corrects and rebukes your spirit Oh amen so do you rile up and try to come back around to prove yourself up cause you won't throughout the word you want to try to it could prove the flesh out and say well see our dentist because or do you say this Lord wash me all over with the word this poor old might hit everywhere is that the way we are see when you come on down to the river what he needed he had the mechanical word with him but what he needed was a god of that mechanical word the god of Elijah and he cried all where is about of Elisha where is he he knew it was the season was a time we might cry out today where is a Dynamics the god of Elisha where's he at and he took up that he smote the waters and the critics saw the same power the same spirit upon a life shot that they saw only Elijah and they bowed down to Elisha for they saw it may God grant it to his bride in the end time praise our God now we find the ages to prove or we feel on she fell on one promise under the temptation of the enemy but fail one prominent tradition enemy face-to-face and now the people has called for his name that's us of course is his bride she is to come into contact again by the same thing not just a nomination of truth or something but every word for in the beginning of the Bible man was the Word of God to live by one word misinterpreted by a man I said one word Miss interpreted by a man now you think on that you think on one promise lately or any time now you not know think all one word misinterpreted maybe not on purpose but just to understand it but it still misinterpreted it by minister or by a man of our woman one word and you let that sperm that thinking lay in here where you at this every word word by word hair little and a little but the Word of God if you're running through the word you don't understand it don't get all excited way over here somewhere he'll give understanding it's all his laces right on through the Bible don't ever get shook up see now flow in the beginning man was given the Word of God to live by one word I misinterpreted by a man called Satan and a person of an animal called a serpent Satan and the person could talk to Eve in this person rather and misinterpreted the word to her and was lost see it must be every word in the middle the Bible Jesus came and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and when he was tempted by Satan el-din time God telling us here in the last days that the god of this world will rise up in the last days and whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it his part shall be taken from the book of life god be merciful to us let us not walk as stiff shirts chest stuck out head up know-it-all for we to one turn were in disobedience let us with grace and mercy and feeling in our hearts toward god homely come to the throne of grace brother if the people in this message could get this revelation and you wouldn't see you see God moving in our myths but they're so hard on one another you you did this and you did that that's legalism what did you do the same day the least thing that you have done is measured against the worst thing that you're the brother or sister has done and there are both cleansed by the blood now think on that and the least slow tiny thing that you can do the blood cleanses both of them now where do you get off trying to condemn somebody and also prejudge that person with a legalistic spirit and that's the spirit that's moving in this message here and that's the spirit that God can't move in just moving around in the message it takes in the message when I believe me because I'm supposed to be here in the church rather and yet he lost the whole thing then he might know who Christ praise God that's what brother Brad tell us he knew that the relational would come and we would be on top our families and the others because of Christians and different churches and whatnot we'd be stiff shirts you and a message you know all is a stiff us a stiff sharing see chest stuck out head up know everything because they got the tapes in the book see now the word tests God promised melikhaya for to come and he was to come to turn the hearts of the children from error searing unfaithfulness and lead them back into harmony with the fathers who Zaphod as the prophets and the old patriarchs lead our hearts there were over here in error with the traditions of the elders and manmade churches and whatnot and think we serving God and his people are destroyed by a lack of knowledge but Malachi 4 would come in mercy in God's love and leaders as children from error from sin from unfaithfulness and put us back in harmony with the fathers who wrote the word Amen brother basically an orchestra everything must be in harmony amen the one who's leading it every instrument the bear I mean the droves that everything gotta be in harmony they got to be in the spirit of the scoresheet there and that's what he's been trying to get us to do to get every woman man child in harmony with the word Hey now we come down to judges seven to finish off this morning's short message praise God now in judges seven here we find like I said in the beginning here and it was a word test that he was given and I like that the type of our tower day three polls and go back to his day now in judges seven three the Lord spoke to getting on and now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return in depart early from Mount Gilead and their return of the people twenty and two thousand and they remain ten thousand s thirty two thousand now when the time came for this great to revival to start in Gideon's term for the Midianites were swarming over to here the valleys and whatnot and gideon Solem and god had proved himself to getting on with the fleece and whatnot and he was ready brother he has seen the supernatural he knew that this was the same God who woke up the rich see this was the same God that took his father's through the wilderness the same God it took John Swain him into the Promised Land that same God wet that fleece and also dried that fleece out and he knew was so did he was prepared he was right and he was ready for the battle and God prepares you in the presence of God for the battle and he has prepared us and his business is his word around every temptation of the devil to strike us and by the grace of God we are still standing amen praise God praise our God so this narrow God told getting on oh you got thirty two thousand down there starch believers church will never hate battle up here amen now you going down there in the third verse and preach the word to them it's what he did he goes back here he's saying he says here who service fearful and afraid going back return back he began the pressure he brought a wonderful edifying message and they showered the praise God but his message he was let him if you're afraid God is with us and no doubt he spoke about how God was with Abraham and Moses [Music] [Music] praise God and he's 20 pounds set right there Gideon say my god I have rehearsed the promises over and over nine years then they just still sitting there same right see them you know so no doubt he would have said do only 20 the eighth verse 20 chap is a law of warfare and officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall see what man is there that is fearful and feedwater let him go and return to his home this his brothers heart faint as well as his heart know how God must get them separate [Music] from the mythical Christian Assembly you see tears of joy streaming down her cheeks amazing do you long for the sin like Ezekiel 9 nations of the rest of the world we have in us praise God but getting him here cause his priests awaited him getting on and he preached exactly Deuteronomy 28 he said all that a faint-hearted all that a frightened oh my god he says this is a sword that vesture and it fell into his hand and he watched out in 19 March 1963 praise our God and conquered every demon out here every denomination he was a Jericho and away and then he looked up he saw a vision and he was put up on the right horse and he rode West but we got a promise she'll turn at the rest she'll ride back on the white horse same white horse brother amen how the how he rehearsed how brother Graham going back in 1946 like getting on here the Midianites World War 2 was over and he had conquered everything they would lead all over the world was leave me in 1946 baron nothing God was even though because we're going to feel out there in 1946 dr. Charles price had died any simple next person had died that last thought the red hot because women preachers all that learn that comes down from way back in and because Genesis burgers have fouled up men and women preachers it's a certain line of they come down from the seed in Genesis and they come all the way out though God I understand that not speak against a woman but her her ministers some men bring out this drunken woman would bring her out of the wings you'd be drunk as a hoot owl and get her out there with her wings on in her white because beautiful dresses stand her up there and she stagger up then up in the pulpit thousands of people out there and that anointing of God will fall upon her and she would call them sinners to repent with a greatest gift out there praise God and God would bless it and they rejoiced in that they took a prophet to straighten that mess out for a saccade and they still believed in it amen thank God for the word of God now as I was typing here Gideon preached a wonderful message - and he went back to Deuteronomy 20 capita eighth verse and preached it to them and then 22,000 faint hearted they saw no part of that and they went on back there left ten thousand and how are we know how a brother branham in his first and second pull pull the sword out he said himself at first message after the ancient law because visited him God told that he would go and pray before kings and whatnot and so forth and he said but the medicines they won't believe me he says that is the reason why I'm sending you because the ministers is the ones who didn't believe your Lord the Pharisees and neither will they believe you so with that revelation that the ministers would never receive him he pulled a sword out and with that same revelation today we stay in here [Music] neither will oblivion by whose trellis painful righteousness will not believe you yes it will brother so he pushed that way he's in the message the age of the myth autumn Sh which one there's a word brother praise God that the mayor of God is to bring the people under the condition of the word your condition is you come to the word I say your heart you're tough know me I'm so you know I wasn't giddy on he told get here on the preach dead give it anything do you you fight God cuz I mean this man back here in acts he knew that was his name a chameleon somebody the Camille when they when that the the Apostles was belching out the world God is stirred up the Pharisees and whatnot over there the ministers came against because he passes to all right and they want to beat him and everything he's gonna meet hallelu wisdom he said it would be careful now there's God the fighting against God just not a god it'll come to know it be careful today if it's go ahead you fighting against gun and if it's not God here today or anywhere it'll come to North but if it is gone believe it and March with it and support it but your prayers and your faith what a little faith you got put into it amen so got a banner Paul sword out and he said the mess and I believe you see he said but if you can get the people if you can get the people to believe not even cancer will stand in your way the people to believe bypass their ministers preach the word and get to the people cuz I got some seeds out there and they want to believe so rehabs aren't didn't believe it in regards what the the whole pulpit Association said because HIPAA hernia they have really Hotel pick up like week hotel trained here you go into you know C so therefore brother branham Poulos Ord 1946 he wasn't premiered not being aware but he pulled a sword and he preached a message about David facing Goliath and that great big giant of cancer in sickness the plagues after World War two stood over the entire world the world was it was so down with sickness and death and everything else but a little profit three is God who believed that angel I was sent to him the Word of God and he pulled his sword and he went march down and began to chop at that jurian and all the little David's ministers they caught faith and they pulled their swords on and brother are here revival swept over and it's still going on now it's just the fruits of is still here from what william branham started himself back in 46 well how much more is just a pool that was his first and second pool now I notice from Gideon's first the second pool twenty ten thousand left see he pulled the word out and we had brought up reached away and his first and second pool but it was twenty two thousand giving us time how many thousands and thousands was in the Korean Braves time depending constants and nominal Christians from 46 through 63 who left while they're tired riding with the 22,000 that left getting on Perez God let's think no no all right now we come down to Gideon third pool here we are praise God oh if you ever get a revelation that song those few words it'll do wonders for you because he first loved you and I loved him so did this morning don't you love him we're just giving a little Bible study here but with Jesus he saved us we love Him we know with him he's given us his word tells what to do here now brother branham bikini on came to prepare for the battle this was God's Way now see and brother Brown came to prepare our people back in 46 for the last days you see now his first missus up because thousands pull the swords out and followed him out in healing in vials all across the world Amen see cancers blindness deaf dumb cripples the devils were careful to did was raised a message daughter a healing virus shook the world and God is still healing the sick and still raising a dead this morning I believe that God touched little law because brother Curtis little granddaughter over there this morning the same God and there we have been punished sort out probably had brought touched over here this morning like it touched this the arm in the back it touched many others in here that same God he's just same yesterday today and forever the song says he lives he lives it's not deadly man he's living this morning how much unbelief try to move here he's living for his God amen now the brother bran begin to restore faith and forty six seven into the 50s and 60s back in a promise word they saw that God had promised to cast out Devils and here the second he saw that God did it through William Branham and it caught the revelation and they did it themselves praise God now in a third Pole here we are however has a twenty two thousand left that first revival getting head on a word see so like I said some a thousand ten thousand left brother grams first second revivals polls rather now here we are at the third pole Guinea on term in his term ten thousand remain for the supreme water test if

this shall be there of moon I say unto thee this y'all go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so to bring it down to entire vernacular or brother : brother hunt whoever I say is going to be enterprise gonna be in the bread you take anything to do with it all whoever RC is nothing the brightest not on the breath it's what I'm saying is what I do and I myself do it all you have to do is become sure you now there were still too many followed a message and even there was many fallen and brother Graham Smith so the first thing they was bringing church order and many left welcome to hell amen they began to bring the fact that the son of man in heaven was on earth in him and yet he was still in heaven and you can get that one then I said what is or you God or you this son of man or son of man they all confused but the son of man which is in here but is also a mean he did the works down here he's opening the word good so then it was still too many following so he way out personally himself in January of 64 and shout across the entire country and we're on trial and they all left in deep Pentecostals just like when he gave up the two fish and five loaves of bread everything I didn't marry my revival they they gave it up twelve baskets two passes doctor and scooped it up from that 97 0 value Amen right back baskets full left praise God then he told his disciples gettable and sail out watch out just go over to the other signs don't copy Epicor here I sent you over there I'll put you in the word go over there Pentecostals myself are you going over there 1964 63 we had know what was going on but 64 January he himself went to California Texas Mississippi Alabama Florida New York all around and he himself got rid of the Pentecostals himself he appeared stood up on the platform spoke behind him spoken firm and spoke on the side of him call our people do anything and preach to worrying about fifteen to twenty minutes and they were stumbled by it and they're walking along with him they were going see the son of man revealed himself to them then he caught us in the boot around about June 64 it was dark it wasn't sure was he gone or was it a spirit for when he appeared walking on the water you know whether it was a spirit would there wasn't crying should and when you get the revelation now brother Brown is that God in you or you God who seemed he wasn't quite sure he said it is I be not afraid praise God and he commanded it his disciple Peter to get on the water and Peter famously was gone the unveiling of the mighty God Peter got up on the water and we begin to get up on the water he saw his marching in the masterpiece get him step begin to get his step up on the water the word now you're falling the word you know Peter fell amen but he raised him up we fall every day but the mercy of God raises up but he was you got her the devil Pentecostal boot and got up on the water the word when he commanded Peter come and he commented us he called us out say come on the water praise our God and then everything was alright he stilled the waves just storms and everything and we was all right he was in the boat with us in about sixty four we begin to get a revelation in you understood sin any left of course and then we had to begin to ripen and so forth right on down here to the day now and getting on here I'm finishing off now ten thousand remained for the supreme water test see in god I said there's too many following we know how a God strip them down by the word the next two years sixty three four and five he just chopped them right on down by there were a mini lift him see no he brings him down to the water test notice ah not getting on not your pastors and so for the minister see will try them for the there see and this shall be whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee and the same shall go with thee and who say I said none because they will go now it is God who was doing a separating he's the ones doing it notice ten thousand track the water the message now get this newest one ten thousand in a third poll just a moment type here saying drink the water the message ten thousand did but God's test see he had a test in there now the Gideon didn't fully understand his will but again I believe everything he said he follows structures now kiddie area you don't know what I'm doing see because I'm revealing to you day by day but you just do what I tell you to do and I will try them for the year now they all are going to drink this water the third Pole every one of them see but I'm going to define them it's gonna let the world like a dog they're gonna slide into it and take the head just forward and come to them I like a dog like that you involve a face everywhere but they're gonna get their water the other group are gonna come to the message to water and they want to bow down on their knees so holy and sweet and they want to reach down and take the water let it dribble on down to get what they want the amount you want and here praising God well haven't we all in the message but sure we are we all take a water 3rd pool but one group is left in like a dog and the other group is bowing down on his knees and Gideon was told just to watch him and we're told watch him Gideon had a gauge he had two things to us those who had left him like a dog and those who was bowing down we have one thing to watch the life so ok with a drink of water but what is the life so this wonderful that has a life and he's drinking and the other boat is there's no life when they come in here stars of the world cut in here skinny old short doesn't get made and maybe it might because put them all pool a nice dress for here and go outside then you just saw bowing down into the water you're drinking the part that you want of it in an intellectual fashion another woman might be come in here and pray it raises up and here hallelujah and all is just everything is wonderful in Heaven's coming down and so forth they go back home in red and ray up to her husband straighten him out no kind of life in the home won't Coco won't do what she's supposed to in the house and don't and we'll take care of her husband yeah in every way and so forth - because a policeman Lord and the man he could come in here and praise God they don't mean to go home he's a living devil in I was mean and cantankerous as it can be go on a job and fight or not thank you and so forth well he's taken out of the water but we only commanded to watch them how you drinking water and that's all I'll see but the waters they're me now and God said and that all 10,000 break the water but it's not it's really what I say I will choose see now or giddy I had to wait until 10,000 men drank the water could have taken seven years I don't know but he had to win to the Lance one taste of that water and we can send this year some more or lappers come in brother bill and John and Harry and brother Tony and his family no alcohol and water lapis we had their lash they land up with the Word of God see and some have also come in here and bow down and he going on a drink - water get one ooh praise the Lord so now that the separation notice throat ahead to wait until the layers hold rate the router could take you seven years I don't know but the separation notice came all they drink and not that they believe the water because they drank it but how they drank it and so does it come today on how you live in what kind of life are you living not not because you're in the mess you got the tapes in the books but what kind of life is your life measured upward so the separation came that's the way it came in order to separate them Gideon had to watch each one to fire how they drape that water head stand there it stands posed by I praise God today the shippers are watching on their pulse how are you drape the order not the fact that you drinking the water we're watching how you're drinking water and so when you come har as your spirit when we come to you with different things and so forth that's how you drink the water whether you recoil and rise up and get mad and what not or if something is spoken to you you try to come back around maybe two weeks later and throw out something we catch them all some do that take them in the back and then next thing I call you up on the phone and they still don't believe you come back around this way see well see is how you drink the water now not the fact that you're drinking to order but how are you doing it and I'll gauges delightfully now God gave them two tests gonna know who he would choose for the third poll battle Gideon didn't know cuz he the Lord had not revealed to him yet that those who happen is the ones or those was bound he didn't know which which was which God just said to watch who's bowing and watch was rapping but God never told that the leprous as the ones because you want to use let's put through it we're just gaming us out the card of the word here now amen so Gideon was a faithful servant still in his pulse my taking about nine years he's still handsome nobody look cuz god he take it in when the town comes here separate him before we can get our blessing he has to so now made go deep this morning know who he would choose for the third pool lovely beautiful bride that has been a version of the word God alone oh now it was he was to choose 300 men and put him into three companies each man was to have a trumpet in his hand each one all of all the 300 had to have a trumpet the bride everyone had the word law to trumpet to blow to the gospel trumpet out there in the left hand they had to have an empty picture they all emptied out nothing's picture at all just as clean as a whistle and then in his empty picture no self left died out ripen maturity ready he drops a lamp in there amen and the lamp is hid in the empty picture and when they surround the Midianites all those Devils over there up on the hills and so forth when the battle starts break the pictures dear because because pitches rather and the life come the light comes out the lamb it is burning bright then before it's hid like now is here right now saying but when our comes he tells you break it and when you break the pictures the lamp shines out bright and it's around the enemy praise God one more taste a thousand now there's 300 of them praise God and in the right hand the trumpet the gospel trumpet the same message that the Prophet preached amen praise God then they they came in the beginning of the middle of lunch and the Prophet said that there are three watches it because the Old Testament nine to twelve twelve to three and three to six and they came at the beginning of twelve O'Clock go out to meet the bridegroom at the midnight hour and he came out in night time they blew the trumpets the word the gospel they broke the pitchers amen in the lamp shined praise God and then they cried they shouted they cried out and he shouted the soul the Lord and all vide on the soul of the Lord and of Gideon and the Bible tells us that the Spirit of the bride says come the spirit and the bride will shout sparing the bride will have the light burning and a chump in her hand blowing out their course God saying what the prophets said same anointing same spirit the 300 blew the trumpet let the lamps and put the enemy to flight God had separated to ten thousand himself Gideon was only to notice how they drank the water I'm finished now today we shepherds ought to notice how you drink whether your left me like a dog I call it living a life whether you bow down on pick on your knees and taking what you want that's bowing down see that's no life they are seen now judges seven seven and finish and the law Siddhanta get on by the three hundred men that left there was the revelation they came in touch of seven seven by the three hundred men here and didn't know which was which it that God had to reveal to him that it was the water lepers but kion kept account see he said by the three hundred men that left will I save you and delivered the admittance into that hand and then all that all the people go every man unto his place and they were his friends so therefore God had separated them according to his word for he's the one who said it he's one that told Gideon to preach it and what to do in to watch and so forth and therefore he had to come here in the seventh verse and reveal to getting on give him the revelation of who was who according to the word who was who see it did God separate day 10,000 and of course the breakdown was in Gideon's first and second for 22,000 left his third Paul 9700 left and I left 300 there and how we can bring it over here today and see the multitudes that have left and how many do we have of the bride even among those that are drinking the water in the message now this is a hard message to bring I know that but it's got to come it is the word because even harder this was coming say and this is sent to make us all be serious and measure up our lives to the Word of God that God might bring that blessing he's gonna bring it 9700 and his third pool drank water also but the camp want to short in though they were drinking see beloved our short how are you drinking the water this morning are you lapping the water like a dog why are you bowing down on your knees remember the land for six years Joshu eight in them if they went through the land the land is the promise of the Holy Ghost a type they went through six years in the land taken parcel by parcel and on six years we've been since 6672 six years taking the land the Holy Spirit parcel by parcel add to your faith virtue add to your virtue of patience a parcel another possible another possible know the parcel parcel by parcel during those six years but around about the seventh year so what the time around in there somewhere they were given over land and told their full possession they were adopted and placed into their positions and therefore we are looking for charity to set us into opposition all of it that God has promised so therefore we want to know though see how are you drinking the water the restitution work started by larger we come forth to bring back the original faith the twelve stones together and all it was all done and fixed up because according to the Word of God the water everything all put around it and the fire fell and licked up the water and consumer sacrifice and so forth and then he brought on the latter rain that was the restoration work for the the land had laid barren and no water and whatnot in famine and so forth for about three and a half years or so he restored it all back praise God but it was finished up under Elisha and in Elisha under the double portion of the Holy Spirit typed out the bride in Christ Elijah and his bride carrying on the restitution work in the power of a glorified church the first thing he did when he come back with despair of God upon him he came to to Jericho and the sons of the Prophet they were there the land was nice the same because they were in it was nice city they had nice homes and so forth good jobs and you know and they had the tape recorders and whatnot in fine little groups and so forth said what the water is making everything barren here you see so the first thing that because Elisha did but the dull pushing the Spirit was healed the water at the spring in other words he had to bring a clearer understanding of what because the Elijah said and therefore in healing the water at the spring because they had thrown all kind of things in there what kind of funny are ideas in the message and people didn't know what they were drinking and it wasn't really ripening and maturing right because it was the GU haras all the ones that do this here to this here in water it was the same water from this way down into it because artesian well but they through all kind of muck and mire in there and you couldn't drink it so therefore the first thing you lashed it bring me a cruse some salt in it purifying and threw it in there and heal it at the spring and then they drink that was the first thing you did after he smoked divorce praise out God therefore did the water of chocolates the malecon for untappd that well it was supposed to be flowing pure and in the message they have got all messed up so he lies to come on the scene and made our a clear understanding what he had saying and who was that but divorce is a resurrection speak out what is clear no man knows little cept he interpreted himself and he's got to say what he says because through His Prophet and what's in the Bible amen and water truth with no more Aaron it's no error in the Bible at all but what we take our only because interpretation of the word makes the error see but if we take it away he said it and let God reveal it oh and we're drinking the same water amen see now it was he liked this very same spring the poor he went to this poor woman she wasn't dead a widowed woman and she had a husband he was the son of a prophet he'd have much much revelation and so forth he died out and so forth but she was a widow woman and her sons and therefore so he gave her the world war he always spoke the word because Lysa what he spoke it came to pass he told took one bought pots and so forth and bringing in there shut the doors and so forth going in begin to pray and believe God you know it had a nice little revival and therefore she was poor in spirit and she had a heavy spirit upon him just like now and he a fill up her plants with the oil of joy and then all of a sudden all the flowed and cancer all her debts all her own belief had just cancelled all out and then she stood before the Lord redeemed and pure no one belief and no doubts no debts and whatnot and scared of this kid this here because man looking for this over here so for the devil overhead because he has got you know where he hasn't got one because then against you praise God well praise our God in the family multiplied to bread the corn and he put the meal in the pot you who round down through his restoration work but it's all there and even one time his servant was with him and he was getting ready to fight and he was afraid the servant was afraid and he cried out Elisha I overcome the power of God was there he knew who he was what are you afraid of he said Lord open up his eyes to see what's up here who's with us now and the Lord opened up his servants eyes in the mountains with full of horses and chariots of fire all round about a weight and fought Goliath to make his move brother watch that third pole then praise the name of our God so therefore he was ready before the great event there was nothing to be afraid of they had gone through the water tests drank the water lapped it like a dog the only fell down in the water they got up Jesus because he forgave him but it was their attitude in the heart that's the thing you watch it's that attitude what kind of attitude are you a a critical spirit or judging this one and clamp it down here be careful take us you fall see for the same God will judge you the same way with other other words the worst have with judgment you give out you get it back the same judgment so you'd have to give to give our love you get back love same so like I think some of my brother Brown yesterday when you send up a cursing and the other man send up a blessing for you to weigh over the other country somewhere it meets up in heaven and God sends the accursed him back up on you and the blessing goes back up on the other one pray for one another praise God well praise God be ready for the great event for the great test friends because are you lapping the water have you understood the church or all these things here put them on the pastor's the elders the Deacons the trustees helps governments the people will every man finally get in his place and stay there that's a water leper or will he if you tell them a certain thing we'll hear I'll up and get funny or just a net see well we that's what we have to find out well we won't say nothing I mean unless you ask and it would give you the word we go out on preach the Word of God see me now but God alone knows who the water Lappas are and you can't fool nobody you could just tell by the life how the word comes to see or or you know the other is but I love it just the same Sidda me know but I just wish with all my heart that you would be a water leper because those the kind that shall go in praise His name shall we bow his I'll Heavenly Father bringing this message this morning God lain upon my heart last night father pray dear God that you give them understanding of what was spoken here this morning and dear God I pray that everyone in here is a Laurel Emperor maybe there might be somebody here don't understand what I'm even talking about and I want to become the size or go outside and say something maybe even next week be careful father I would say to them for the hour is short anytime you are ready to come forth you ever gave a parable that your presence would be here and one of the servants would begin to beat him and because those who would say that you have come and the others would say well you're here but you got to come over in the rest in a tent all this so that whatever it is and then showing it but they would come against those who would say it new or here now this morning and they will come against that is smite Lord God I pray that there would be no spirits like it in here and follow me you sanctify and wash it out Lord from our presence here and pray dear God that everyone in here would have the right spirit Lord and be able to take a hold of the word of God and move right on down to the end before we feel Lord that thou are ready soon to take us up on that mountain Transfiguration and adopt of people some water lepers it won't be many but they'll be there your prophet he promised it the Word of God and I pray God everyone in here will be among that number and how we try to show this morning bringing right on down trying to make it plain to the people Lord God may they pull this swords in here and rededicate their lives and purpose in their hearts and keep their eye on the promise if they don't have the baptism God may delay before you day and night and just made it they keep their spirits right Lord then your spirits and made it keep a safety finding the word because Peter them did and therefore they can do the same and so father without the Holy Ghost because Peter were on one Accord and a one man without the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost calm and if they don't have the Holy Girls this message the word it puts us on one Accord in one man I mean this revelation those who don't understand father and they they understand that getting on like just like getting on he didn't know who was who he was only told to count how many laughter water and count how many bow down so he knew then you told me which was which and which group was doing what so we only two or watch the Sheep father and we see they eating some weed or something we try to burn the world to them to restore back the Lord we know that how you kept Israel out of all the way from all the other nations from intermarry awful purpose because you're going to have a clean pure bloodstream to bring the Lord Jesus Christ room in God's you watched over that blood stream and you saw to it that that stream was kept a certain way all down through the Bible days that it would produced a messiah but he will come for naught or their blood because of your blood your own blood so followed but he would come forth with the sanctified vessels so dear God there would be something you this morning sick and don't understand weakened anemic maybe have a blood transfusion this morning by the Word of God saw that there we can worry it in the blood is so Heavenly Father may they get this revelation and and then forsake these all little funny things which we could feel in your losing or just trying to speak a few words you could feel the tightness and so tight and fear and condemnation God made it nor this supposed to be praying and laying their faces in the word as these more people are doing Lord and their old timers should be that much more further up to Road so Heavenly Father the short turn that is left give us this dedication this desire in our hearts and until that time father may we keep moving on may the Lord bless you bring we ask this in Jesus name Amen to God's unchanging God's unchanging hand [Music] your song things a turn [Music] some change in this swirl stain richest [Music] see [Music] we trade [Music] I shall never pass away everybody changing [Music] to God's unchanging [Music]
