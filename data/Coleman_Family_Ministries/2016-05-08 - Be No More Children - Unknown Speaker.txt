Harden not your heart this is the day here so if you catch what I'm saying this may be the last day for you this may be your hour and when the hour comes in the great judgment I know I'll be able to stand in the face everyone in here today did my servant speak to you of be no more children and then you're going to have to say yes he did for this is the day so may everything be done in Grace and in love speak the truth in love Romans 13 as we go to the Lord this morning if you're weary and tired and you have to go I have a message up on my heart and I don't even know what it is so you may just clip out as I wait until this burden has has left my heart you right now in the scriptures Romans 13 um verse 8- 14 and Ephesians 4 14-6 and Colossians 2 4-7 I'm reading from um Romans 13 the eth verse Oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Lord for this thou shallal not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness thou shall not covet if there and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in a chambering in in wanness lewdness and everything else see not in strife and envying but his because the admonition but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and Ephesians 4 we in Sund school this morning now that we henceforth be no more children children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slave of men and cunning craftiness whereby they liy and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ let me say it again now here's my burden right here but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him at all things every Point everything in your life may finally grow up amen which is the head even Christ and he is the word from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth see according to the effectual working in the measure of every part each each one has a measure and you supply it to the body see uh making uh uh measure of every part Mak an increase of the body until the Ed of itself in love and Colossians 2 4 and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I be absent in the flesh yet I am with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with thanks given as a memorial to William brandham the prophet of God verse 4-7 this morning is a memorial to him for he is the one that taught us amen he is the one that's not here in flesh but he's here in spirit for he sold these this message to us which is here now amen and that he might be able to withhold our joy and our steadfastness and all these things so it's a memorial to his message this morning may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Lord as we stand here Lord trembling on the spot for realizing at the hour has come the reaping season is up on us and I don't think the children understand what you sold that shall you reap be not mocked uh uh be not uh mocked and what you sow you're going to reap so father we pray that the children Lord this morning you would come in and and and and give them a a revelation understanding for it's been children for these 8 years and a half almost now but lord it's been the ripening the greens Lord the sincerity and all the pureness hasn't been there we were to ripen in the sun until we reach golden brown but father if your hour your time clock has moved from sewing to reaping we can't wait Lord we must move on for that is the season of The Reaper is a time to plant a time to sew a time to pluck up that which is planted time to weep time to live a time to die a time to mourn a a time to have joy and Lord I can see the joy of the Harvest of bringing in the Sheep coming down Lord I'm look as the song was sang the song of the reaper these words was read this morning and Lord and seen the terrible tragedy happen uh with that little baby the the mother couldn't go inside she couldn't do anything and and that baby was at the mercy of some sloving nurse in there Lord that didn't even care about that baby oh God and how you feel this morning you mothered these little Eagles Lord and the prophet is gone and he he weeped Lord as he as he couldn't be here Lord to feed them personally so he sacrificed and he weep but he had he had solded good seed Lord he know that there's going to be a crop oh God May every soul in here this morning be in that crop that Malachi for planted he didn't plant Pentecostal babies he planted Born Again God manifested men and women mature bride of Jesus Christ up on the earth now either we make him a liar either we going to go on as Pentecostal babies or we going to be that matured wheat seed that he planted oh god father help us this morning to be that matured crop may we reap this morning a matured crop that from this stay onward would mature and grow up into him in All Things even the head Lord help me oh God May there be no bitterness in my heart May there be no ranker no uh uh uh Madness Lord or or may there be no Spirit may I not be heated up in my own spirit for one time Jeremiah was ready to go you give him a commission and but he got so mad at the people he was in the heat of his own spirit and you let him sit there and wait and then when his own Spirit had cooled off then you sent him by the spirit of the Lord so Heavenly Father may my own thoughts my own ideas cool off Lord and may it be a true holy ghost anointing coming out and I know if it's the Holy Spirit anointing that then nobody will get mad they'll be glad they'll be happy Lord and we'll reap a crop this morning for this coming forth seven Thunders oh God the revelation of it if they're not they're still babies they'll never even hear it Lord and I pray that they will grow up today Lord if they can't even stop these little things of the the sins of the flesh how can they go into the Eternal C of the Loos that's wanting to come and reveal these mysterious things to bring on that Rapture and Grace oh God the hour is here I don't know about around the world but I'm only going by the barley in New York and this is pulsating in my heart and I got to say that there be no more children I believe the hour is here to reap so Heavenly Father may you give the witness drop a real reverence in our midst now Lord May that silliness disappear or that's brother Coleman may they realize this is not brother Coleman this is the word of the Lord going forth Lord may they not be fearful of me may they not look at me Father you don't want to looks into their hearts not me I can't see I'm not in their homes I go to my own home and try to take care my own business Lord may they understand not to serve me as a men pleaser but may they serve the Living God with reverence and fear he's the one that knows their thoughts are registered in heaven right now and you the one that watch them in their jobs in their homes or wherever they go at not me Lord may they finally realize that it's not brother Coleman it is the spirit of the Lord may they grow up today Father we pray and we ask this in Jesus name and his sake amen you may be seated I like the Tyler's thought be no more children and as I said here this uh terrible thing on my heart and I and then you see how I hate to see somebody taken advantage of that's the way I was born and when I was a kid I'd see gangs beat up a a little fellow that had wandered out of his neighborhood over in the uh because down in Harlem there at the old polar ground ballparking we to live around there and I see kids wandering around and and then little boys stealing things and beating them up that used to always bother me and the Army the same thing and so therefore that's in my nature I don't like to see uh somebody harmm somebody or take advantage of that person and then being called and saved and and called to the ministry from the onet I saw the devil amen and all his workings and his uh cunningness and sless to deceive God's people oh it's all right and get them all at ease in Zion and down in their sins and you can do this and you can do that always showing them what you can do see always get them license where you can do this it's all right after all when I see that spirit that looks for the things that that they can do I mean I'm looking for the spirit that want to know Lord to look in my heart and clean me out that I don't want to do not the what can I do to get away with it in the church and long as brother com don't see it's all right no long as God is looking at it I'm just here preaching the word of the Lord see so in view of the coming of the Lord um this morning's exaltation is to be no more children is to grow up in Christ and all things and we are reminded that in the The Ten Commandments um the first four as God spoke no other gods no graven images don't bow yourself down to them don't serve them don't take the name of the Lord in vain and see all the things going on today it almost kills me to hear these people say holy Christ or Jesus Christ that just tears me apart they don't even know what they're saying and you know how they just say it with cursed words and take his name in vain like it ain't nothing see and the first four of the Ten Commandments shows your attitude toward God and the last six of the Ten Commandments shows your attitude towards your neighbor so it's four to God and six to man you see that now four to God and six to man see and Jesus he condensed them into two and and he says uh uh uh in St uh Mark 12:28 and they ask him about the uh the great commandment he says uh it's the love the Lord thy God with all their heart soul and mind and to love your neighbor he made 10 into two and then he even gave a new commandment he said I give you a new command you love one another he knowing that God was going to be in him on the day of Pentecost and then the two would be one for how can you love God if you don't love your brother whom you see and you never even seen God and Paul summed it all up to love as he said over here in in Romans here to Romans 13 here he says love is the fulfilling of the Lord and so we have this new commandment here and just as it strengths me now I don't know how I got a lot of notes here but I just want the Holy Spirit to move this morning on the word word amen and I was getting a blessing in the car this morning as as we had Jo in to read this scripture in the car cuz on my heart now if you want to know what how we should be in the church today you should read Romans 12 to present your bodies amen I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice God is Not Looking for your service at all no he don't need you he wants your body he wants a sacrifice man he wants a clean holy body not join to sin fornication adultery filthiness lewdness out in the world he don't want that no sir he's a holy God he wants a sacrifice and a sacrifice meaning you going to have to to deny mother father your wife your children or whatever it is you going to have to do that and you're not going to question uh whatever God wants to do a service through you if you can't even get away from little old Petty things about this and that how in the world world can you go in service for God if you can't deny little old normal things in the flesh how can God use you for anything if you're fussing and stent thinking about this and that now he wants a sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service nothing extra reasonable service and be not conformed to this world other words be not conformed to the Fashions the Styles and the things of this world all right down here amen and in the world the Sodom is here and now he says here but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God oh church do you realize what has happened when Sodom moved in on the world here in 1960s with these Beatles and whatnot and the Hard Rock the sex those Spirits loose the long haired devils and move it all across the land and tore down our young women stripped them naked and they just give themselves over and fored forication and loose living and all kind of thing that was the devil stripping them down and through the four Beatles coming on the scene and then what we needed was a message amen from God and God sent a prophet with a message and our minds was renewed but the thinking man's filter renewed our mind out gave us God's mind for the devil had clouded our minds up with all kind of stuff and we saw it going on in the different churches or therefore we figured if the pastor and the their deacon is it must be all right if they're doing it but God brought a little humble man who stood alone the thing about your pleasure for second Timothy three declared there'll be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God who want to do Godless service worrying about their own flesh what they going to go out here we had a little picnic in here oh my it got all mixed up and brought a devil in the church here they want to go they get mad somebody face me how could you come in my office in the back and tell me that why can't you be there I said well we only trying to lay it out to help these children don't you know that the devil is trying to take these young girls here right now these young boys trying to put sex Devils up on them trying to get them in the world we're trying oh God oh God we thank you for these Brethren who will help our daughters the devil is after you you young ones he has some Slicker out in the street out there he's trying to make you think it's okay to talk to any of these filthy sodomites out there God has brought you into the house of God and cleaned you up brother don't don't you better the other way you better think this one has cute feet and this one has cute nose and nice hair and all this filthiness those are those are devils that have come from the pit and entered into these children a cursed generation a bastard race right up over here in the Bronx New York in PS22 because two men had the gumption to paddle those little heathens and lay down the thing where because where they should have laid it at right there on Finley Avenue where the god poured out for years years on Finly Amel oh when God leaves a place that's to finish and that school is the worst in New York City why God was on Finley Avenue and they rejected it they denied God on Finley Avenue now God turned that school over to the devil's there and because two men would come along two deans and straighten that school out in the school was sex going on and reers and hard drugs in a junior high school I mean in a Grade School they couldn't walk the hallways to men beat those Philistines out of the hallways and now they want to dismiss those men and send them somewhere else and finally thank God those parents got together and they're fighting for it can you that is the spirit of the devil among the people and that same spirit is in the church when a man of God will stand with the word of God and preach that word here they come you don't have to say that you preaching on me and you this is wrong what am I doing now that's that same Spirit of the devil amen but brother I'm facing that spirit this morning I'm not ashamed of the Gospel the power of God unto salvation I saw a little baby the devil took that little baby to early grave but oh if God can get something out of that death my God if some babies in here will wake up for the devil's going to poison you with something oh brother that fornication and that loose living is poison don't you trample on God God has given you a chance to come out this filthy world and you return back to your vomit you go right on back to your own filthiness don't you trample on God this morning God's giv you a chance and you walk him to a man of God's face and tell that man what you think God don't care what you think God don't even thinking about what you think he tell you to do his word you come to that word and you shut up and mind your business thank God he has revealed there truth to you in the last days oh there'll be a branch that shall escape and she'll be a beautiful Branch to the Lord if I don't care if there's one in here there's going to be somebody that's going to stand on the word of God yes sir praise God and they around here cursing you getting

that God gives you babies no be no more children this morning here amen for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly don't think you're somebody according as God has dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry brother if you ain't ready to dedicate yourself don't Minister just leave it alone see wait on it see until God comes down into your heart

subject yourselves to the ministry and so forth and one to another see and God will bless you do you know that that is the the way to resist the devil it is through subjecting yourself to one another

is to those outside recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lith in you live peacefully with all men dearly beloved avenge not

shalt Heap coals of fire on his head don't you realize that those who curse you and you bless them they burn in shame with the coals of fire that you put the that blessing as a coal of fire and you said bless your brother bless your sister and they burn with shame for you didn't do anything to them and you just Heap it up on them and they can't face they look down they walk away they they can't look at you and that's when Jesus had that power they couldn't look at him he just walked amen he blessed him see and they couldn't face him for they they know what they had in their heart against him and they can never face you if you do what's right the word of God Amen see be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good that's for your outside Sur service friends now my so we see then that Paul here in in Romans here is exalting us to be clothed upon this means this signifies to take upon one the interest of another to enter into his views and to be holy on his side imitating him in All Things amen make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof the first commandment is there's no other gods amen the command this command is not satisfied by an intellectual conv of belief in in one deity see so therefore um so many people have an intellectual conception of this message they don't understand it comes from the heart within God has spoke to you so many say well I see Malachi 4 that's right the Bible says so in the tapes and I see the the Seven Seals and the Seven Angels rather and the the sunset Mountain whatnot that ain't it that's only an intellectual conception did God do something for your heart did he change you in if you never saw the seven angels but did God call you and and tell you that you are the bride child of mine I've called you from Le amen you a new creature you never did it in the first place oh justify did he do that to you if he ever did that then you would be rejoicing in that hope you won't come in here all slowful sitting around in here no sir every Wednesday every Sunday morning you be fervent in your spirit praying inant in season out of season amen praise God and if you believe in the powers if you believe in one power or one mind other than God's mind that is idolatry oh yeah if you worshiping another God if you believe that that the devil is able to do one thing over top of God that's idolatry yes sir if there's something that you can't stop that's an idol in your heart that's an idol there it's over top of God that's right see and can it's got to be wholehearted sold out to God Amen and idolatry was absolutely forbidden in the land see and how in the world can the Catholics worshiping the Virgin Mary what in the world is that amen that's idolatry it's the false gods of the carnal mind anything that denies the presence and power of God is given place in your heart over God that's a Dollar Tree in here is God's presence in here is God's word amen if anybody come in here and thinks any other thing else is in here that's a Dollar Tree cuz if you think that you can sit here and like this here well then you saying that devil the Satan has the power over you he's greater than God and God even proven in the old test when there was nobody around and that ark fell among the Philistines and they put that Ark up next to Deon there was nobody around amen that when they come back in the morning Deon was knocked down amen they put him up again and that Ark next morning knock down well if you come believing like that what even nobody there you come in here in the house of God watch Deon be flattened this morning in your heart God will knock down every Deon in your heart yes he will if you reive yourself over to the Ark of the Covenant the word of the Lord amen praise God Amen achan is a Bible type anything which we we keep in our hearts in the place which God ought to have as an idol whether it be image of wood or stone or whatever it is see money desire for a desire for fame or love of pleasure love of pleasure that's the one that's hard to get in here amen love for pleasure over top of the God's will being done first amen love for your wife's pleasure or your children's pleasure over top of God then that's an idol that's absolutely an idol brother yes sir God must be first love the Lord thy God with what all thy what heart soul mind everything first first commandment there it is then love you one another then if you love one another it's then you'll speak the truth in love it doesn't say speak lovely the truth how are you precious sisters and brothers this morning I'm speaking the truth in love that ain't it speak the truth which is the word first and because you are my neighbor which is the second commandment I give you the truth it says love your neighbor well then because you are my neighbor therefore I love you and if I really love you I'll tell you about God and that's second commandment hey there it is see speak the truth first in love and you say it's so hard I'm only speaking the truth because you're my neighbor amen I'm only telling you to get rid of those Idols cuz those Idols is against God so they're lying and cheating and and backbiting that those are idols and because you are my neighbor I tell you about them because I love you so therefore what are you getting mad about what are you running from uh brother Coleman for then so I'm trying to show you how to get rid of Idols amen well praise the Lord see and therefore some secret sin which we will not give up then God does not really occupy the highest place in our hearts amen and a can wanted this Babylonia garment Fashions designs of the world silver and gold that's what's happening up with our young sisters here the devil want to give them a Babylonian garment see or somebody's lusting out in the world for some of these over desires lust in the heart see therefore the the Bible declares in 2 Timothy 3 that it would be this way heing high minded Lish of Ls of pleasuring things of the world over top of God despising those that are good see we have one Creed is Christ and one Lord is love amen Brotherly Love let it continue now if we have neighborly love which which is Charity therefore charity suffereth long and is kind to enemies and friends alike and charity forgives wrongs and cherishes no Revenge that's to your neighbor amen and it is the only weapon which will make the bride Mighty in the earth no other weapons see cuz brother BR said this in itself shall bring to pass a tremendous victory in the love div yes sir and Israel is cuz they are iron samples they love their friends and hated their enemies that right Israel didn't they didn't have the Revelation see but Jesus he come along and showed them the other side and showed them the Love on the other side for their neighbors amen therefore Israel had an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth and today in this message we have a quote for quote that's all we got this one is quoting the tent and this one's quoting the White Horse this one's quoting no more pastors and this one's quoting no more this this one's quoting that it's quotes quote and eye for eye and tooth for tooth but oh praise God where is that real predestinated bride that has a revelation that God is where is that bride at that's in the middle and not hitting quotes and quotes and quotes and back and forth but has the word living written Epistles in the heart R of all man oh praise God he's going to have a bride not some doctrines of some carnal mind quote against quote amen hatred between nations and peoples is not removed by conquest or by treaties or more schools and jobs and more giveaway programs no sir it'll be the love of almighty God that'll take this whole thing away as he says not by your might not by your power of this and that but by my spirit saith the Lord amen look at this education mess here look at those little Eaves out there in California because Hurst and and these girls out there who was it are they poor little girls who didn't finish school you better believe they were not they were teachers and highly educated little Eaves lusting for some wisdom and here is uh Field Marshal sinu he had the wisdom he was a serpent amen he's going to mix his wisdom with sex and he trapped those little Eaves looking lusting around for some wisdom they go to school they don't get enough wisdom even in school they want some more wisdom and God has anointed ones likee Manson and this man Phi Marshall sinq what kind of mind could he have what could he say to trap these women he had to have a powerful anointing in order to uh uh uh because uh deceive them and they were deceived look at Hitler there I saw three pictures of him there and one picture he's walking in in Birches Garden there like this here and he's talking to Eva his girlfriend and he looks like any old nice man see kind Old Gentleman then another picture I saw he was preaching and and his eyes was glassy full of devils he had the most powerful anointing upon this Earth of the devil I believe since the serpent yes sir brother and I saw his eyes was actually hazy and he preached so hard he said oh he said just give me a few minutes to speak to the people and I'll get them and he did he almost took the whole world and when he preached the people got so frenzy they scream h h h that's the same thing when the Holy Ghost Falls in here and you begin to say Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah it gets so good on the inside well the devil's anointing went into them people and that's what this field Marshal sent you and all these anointed ones out here black and white and different ones they're anointed by the devil and their words get down into those people and turn them around and they begin to scream that's right or right on and yes sir and they scream and they're ready to kill ready to lay down their bodies or anything and you know that stay in a house like that and all kind of ammunition going in there firep power and yet they fought back where's a bride where's a if they could stand for that thing there and they going to hell where is a bride who will stand for the word where's somebody who will stand up as brother Bram often told the story of Anor renwall this great swissman there when he ran forth into the army and let him throw all the spirits and RAM them into himself give me LI or give me death death and that changed the Swiss Army around they were smaller than that great Army but they defeated the enemy cuz one man had Faith had a revelation that they could not do it and I read in the Bible of a man like that there David amen here was God's people tied down with the intellect and they were TI and Saul's Ministry couldn't do it David Street Brothers couldn't do it those out on the field now can't do it and here comes David number eight walking down the road oh he had to work of the Lord but he had the power of the Resurrection behind it and Goliath faced him and amen and and those men were saying this and that and but oh if you go and fight him that he'll give you money and and women and riches and also all these because popularity David said who cares about them things there I'm here for the honor and the glory of God there it is are you here for the honor and glory of God well do you think that God is glorified and fornication and filthiness and strife and enemy is God glorified in that well then why would we want to stay in that why won't you want the word preach for the honor and glory of God why don't you want that word to scour down through the church until everybody lays out flat and confess their sins that God might have the honor don't you know that Joshua said when aan had committed this sin he said uh a my son he said give glory to God give glory to God confess your sin don't you realize that when you confess your sin that you given glory to God you're saying God is greater than the devil but if you hold on and remain silent then you're giv glory to the devil but when you confess it right away you say it God is greater amen don't you realize people what happened there there was aching hiding with the sin in his heart amen and there there was s he was from the tribe of Judah and then down come the high priest with the Yum and the Thum and and they called all Israel over a million landine out there can you imagine Aaron and cuz and the the the high priest walking down the line with the human Thum walking by Simeon and because walking by Dan and the different tribes and coming down to Judah and to Y th light up that was the Holy Spirit the word had found the tribe and then bring them house by house in that tribe didn't they come until finally the uran th found Ain and achen was taken by the urum oh praise God I remember one day on the day of Pentecost there was Peter and them standing there and in comes ananas and saf and the Yum lit up amen and you a liar Holy Spirit the Y thumb and called out ananas and safire they were taken by the same y that took Ain oh I'm persuaded that that same holy spirit is wanting to come back into his bride once small to take the aans and the ananis and the fires and take them out of the midst of God that God might be glorified oh if you sin we have a blood atonement but give glory to God and repent for it is shame and fear that holds you back therefore when the sin is is committed you don't want it's a monstrosity you don't want anything to do with it that's not you you leave it over you want to hide it and slip over here and slip over as the spirit of the devil that is fear as in other words you have no faith that God is able cover that sin you don't have faith in the blood if you have faith in the blood the moment you sin you will confess it cuz God is able to forgive you God is faithful the Bible says if you will confess your sins God is faithful to forgive you your faults now either he said it or he didn't say it and the longer you hold on to when you do them then there's a child that could be healed there a healing blocked up here a blessing is blocked is stopping over here when you have the unconfessed sin in the midst there oh my praise God so there come David walking down the road there and in the the Goliath he knew he had all Israel tied down he knew he had every group in the message tied down you follow me now so who this little uncircumcised I who this little fell little stripping here you said why you little buzz at you he says I'll take you and feed you to the fouls of the air can you mess with Goliath now look at there big because as big as he was the devil when he thinks he has the upper hand then he Roars at you and he's trying he come roaring in here this morning but he's going out of here he come still all over the place roaring he said now you go on and preach this morning could be no more children well I'm going to preach it he said you go ahead and preach and I'll feed you to the fouls of the air do you know what David said he said and I'll cut your head off he said I'll feed you to the files of and David and I'm I'm going to cut your head off I'm going to cut it off this day that you and all the rest of you Devils out here will know that there's a God in Israel and I'll cut your heads off this morning to let you and the entire world New York City know that there is a God in the earth and that God is Holy without Holiness no man shall see the Lord amen so we're going to cut his head off this morning we amen praise God yes sir be no more children that intellectual conception of the message is going out of here did Brother Coleman see me did I do this right did I do that right did you have it in your heart were you changed then you're doing it right otherwise it's intellectual conception that's all after all I'm a deacon and I should do this here or I'm a song leader whatever you are I should do it because after all I am in that position well then forget about because God don't even hear it but there's something burning in there something happen inside where you just can't wait to get to the people of God you just can't wait to get here not on Wednesday downstairs talking but up here in deceased and oh God once more Lord let the power flow in here tonight Lord You Come In Here Wy like that in the house of shake but stand downstairs and like this here ain't nothing going to happen not a thing going to happen long as you stay down there like that I'm talking about I'm talking right to you now I'm talking about on Wednesday you can't find nobody here at all Harley one of two Souls right here then in the flesh you're SE into the flesh down there run to the door fix the hat and get right and walk in holy Hallelujah sit down that's mockery that's filthiness in God's sight you got uh two days in the whole week to get in here and here about 5 hours maybe and for 5 hours it's a house of prayer and worship that's all and correction I mean you can't get 5 hours the whole entire week to the House of Prayer a few moments at the altar here that uh that somebody might be healed in here or something or delivered from the devil in here or something these people drive all the way from New Jersey and and Connecticut they come in here for something and we live here right around here why we should be on fire in here when they come in here brother they should feel the P of God in here people coming through all kind of traffic jams and everything else to get here but we that live in Queens and Brooklyn around here we the ones that are here that's right absolutely I'm telling you just like it is yes sir see so therefore um David amen praise God he believed that God is a God in Israel and he walked out there with the power of almighty God and the word of the Lord and that stone was hurled right into the heads there amen so now we see here therefore in the hour that we're living in is uh the the wrong spirits that overcome the people amen and and give them the wrong desires and and we see here science and education they've had their shank don't you read the booklet there the spoken word book as as the white horse rider went over and looked down there were signs with their test tubes that they had their Shake there'll be one more ride oh praise God may God ride through here this morning he said not only will I shake the Earth on only I Shake also the heavens and he shook in 1964 Alaska and still shaking now he shook the Earth by trimmer just warning what is going to be by a great earthquake amen and therefore California is going to shake and I'm persuaded that when the voice of God come down to Exodus 19 and shook the mountain there amen and that mountain and once the voice of God spoke once the voice of God spoke the mountain kept shaking and shaking until it was on on fire but once the voice of the Resurrection speaks and Shakes the bride it's going to shake and shake and Shake into California sink amen yes going to happen brother but that voice will come forward first amen and then California will slide into the ocean his voice is going to shake the bride he's going to keep shaking this bride until the graves Shake loose and the dead in Christ rise up and begin to walk around the earth that hour is here now we may not live tomorrow I don't know but I want to live today like this is the last day amen yes sir I don't know when the resurrection is coming I don't know when the Rapture is coming but I'm living but I know one thing if the reaping is starting this morning amen if you're going to reap some uh matured corn in here this morning then brother the resurrection ain't far that I know amen and Peter saying that knowing this in the last days scoffers shall come walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning not even realizing do you know they're ignorant of the word of God they're saying where is the promise of his coming and Malachi 4 is the promise of his coming he said I'll send you Elijah there's his promise and you and I have received the promise of his coming and then we put in education and uh going to school over top of the promise of his coming and we not and like give it up our Wednesday he all like this for some school and whatnot what kind of Promise of his coming is in your heart then what has been quickened to you to know that he's here we ain't got anything because against education God has not me I ain't got anything against it God said it's cursed you understand I didn't say he said it he said the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is cursed so there schools hospitals all Society all good sure for a season in a time but when Malachi 4 comes along and tells you the truth of it then it's all together different amen see so therefore he has given us secret food and we have this secret food now we have nourishment satisfaction refreshment do you have it now friends oh praise God and as you have therefore received Christ the lord so walk ye in him and then now we have now the hatred between the Nations and the different races and whatnot it cannot come by education nor treaties and Conquest no sir it only ANS the smoldering fire the only thing that can put it out is the love of almighty God that's all friends that's all what is needed in a government the church and the homes is a Love Of Christ This Love Of Christ is a Divine plant and Malachi FL four has planted this Divine plant and this Divine plant is now in our hearts and it's going to give fruit soon Amen in the heart of the bride and the churches are going to gather is Heavenly fruits the resurrection is coming and Malachi 4 has planted this in our hearts and is going to bring the pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen and Malachi 36-18 just want to read it here just strikes my heart just whatever God lay on my heart amen I want to say it then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another may that be this day and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name his name now and there uh there's the first four Commandments about his name no Idols but who think on his name his Holiness now and they shall be mine sayeth the Lord of host and that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not oh my we are reached that time now see where those who fear the Lord will speak often one to another those who really dying out who really believe what I'm saying is the word of the Lord or what's on them tapes rather is a is a message of God and to stop fooling around they see it and they begin to speak often one to another oh this is right oh thank God for a clean place oh I'm happy that there's no sin and filth in our midst here then God he hearkens he hearkens to your pray prayer he listens to your trials and things and he's with you then and it says that he writes a book before him a book of remembrance oh that seven seal book which is being written on the earth now is being written as a bride comes to the word amen not not not just playing about it now but actually comes to it then this book of remembrance is right on the earth before him I hope you I wish I could just say it to you right the book of remembrance is being written this morning and all those that fear the lord then they are written Epistles they are in the seventh seal book now because they fear the lord and they stop all the Isles the idolatry the fornication of filthiness and strife and contention quarreling and fooling around and they speak often to those who understand they grow up and they see oh he understand she understand and they have Fellowship one with another oh praise God and they move on moving on down to King's Highway and the babies are stay fussing and stewing and sinning and committing fornication right on but those who fear the lord those who would who would fear to speak a word of evil against a brother or sister they fear God oh they fear the lord see they wouldn't harm nobody they wouldn't do anything wrong they wouldn't want to sin they love him too much brother Bram said if he go overseas he knows that Meer would forgive him but he wouldn't do it you understand cuz he love her too much oh pray sure God will forgive you but do you really love them that you wouldn't want to do this CU these different things do you really love him with tears sewing good seed precious seed in your heart knowing that he's going to bring a crop reaping with you bringing your sheet oh where are them people at praise God oh I feel where they at those who speak often one to another those that have fear of God won't walk into your face and said that this and all kind of blasphemous things but they feir God fear in the sight of God where are they at there is somebody something we're going to reap something this morning amen therefore the hour is here to cast off the works of darkness to make sure you are written epistle in the book of remembrance there's go oh don't you know what I'm saying the Lord Jesus there he remembers that he wrote a book on the earth he said I'll ride this Trail once more to pick up my book on the earth The Book of Life is on the Earth written Epistles I mean actual words themselves you are the word written Epistles love peace Joy Holiness and it's written in it you see it you're doing it you don't talk about you do it amen you don't have to need somebody you you don't need me to tell you that you're supposed to read your Bible and you're supposed to let the you supposed to meditate there in your Bible day and night think about Joshua Moses had left left him he was nervous and scared and he was afraid and God knew he would be afraid over 2 million people and he would have to take care of those people and Moses was a mighty Prophet so therefore God right with he said be not afraid he said be of because be of because be incourage amen and God exalted him right away for nine paragraphs there that right be not discouraged be not dismayed the Lord thy God is with you oh praise God and in verse three he gave him some hidden manner he said where every place you go that was hidden that was a secret promise that he revealed to Joshua wherever you put the soul of your feet I have already given it to you oh praise God and uh I'll be with you every day of your life and there no man shall stand before you no Philistine no devil out there will stand in front of you I will be with you every day of your life but then he gave him the secret he said if you will meditate in the LA amen d and night amen and observe to do all that's written in the law there you are therefore uh God Joshua brought us the law of the book amen if we could only observe to do if you never came here amen if you never heard a tape even but if you had a revelation that he's God oh praise God and you got a Bible here You observe to do this here amen see long as you heard about it and God spoke to your heart therefore if you will observe to do what's in the Bible without brother keman telling you you have success before you even get here Wednesday or Sunday if you will meditate on my word that that tells you stop fornicating and playing around stop being a baby before you come here before you pick up the telephone before you go anywhere meditate on that and then when you meditate it means uh it's a a two-way traffic oneway traffic is reading it reading reading reading reading reading reading going on but two-way traffic you're reading it comes right back at you two ways right back at you and it larges in here then as you sit there oh God thank you for the word this morning then you begin to meditate and then holy spirit says don't do this here don't do that there do this here do that there from where the word from here right from here oh I hope you get this this morning now I'm going close out here the devil knows how to take his little thoughts and put it right in the words see and get spoken word books and line it up and show it to you you see to me now it's a spirit see and unless you are reading the word you won't know you won't know you got to hear the tapes and read the word but you must read this word otherwise you will not be able to discern the error you it'll come right to you and it'll hook you right on off you're gone see so therefore uh to my neighbors this morning I love you and I wanted to tell you the truth the lion has roared who will not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy the truth as recommended by Paul is the whole gospel back to the word which centers around Christ and builds the church into a working unit is able to throw off all the error all the waste and to sustain itself like the human body is a working mechanism you understand and the body of Christ is so much waste and error all over the body of Christ now but the day is coming and I'm praying that this is the day in New York City that this is the day is going to start see and it's going to be able to be a workable unit to throw off the era and the waste from this day on see as the body itself see and to sustain itself by the word each member sustain itself see Christ is risen and he is the head amen and so therefore we need some Davis to chop off the intellectual conception of the Bride amen do you believe that there friends and Satan always challenge you when he thinks he has the upper hand but Jesus Christ said that I am the headship I'm the control tower amen and I'll ride this Trail once more amen praise God may I ask you this morning uh what does the resurrection of Christ mean to you what does it mean to you this morning because I like to know what impact does it have on your daily life the resurrected Christ is it just a historical event that happened is it one item in your faith or what is it to you what does it mean to you or is it such that your entire life begins a new in this glorious fact did that happen to you or just some old historical thing and some vain tradition or something see what part does the Risen Christ play in your daily confrontation with the world Amen the daily confrontation see with the mounting precious experience on every hand what does Christ mean to you amen the tragedy this day is that many Christians live as if the Lord never rose from the dead you know why because they know that their sins are forgiven and they go into heaven because he died for them but he is living for you now and that's the part you can't get them to see he is living this day right now he's here this morning living right in here he's a Living Word but so many won't come to the word they're scared of the word so when the word comes to them they back away and preaching hard but that's the Rison Christ coming to you to set you free and and you close you shut down the the curtain or the shade you shut it down over your heart you won't let the word come in and you steal your stuff like that and what's he going to say now what's he going is he going to expose him over here see that's the Risen Christ trying to get in and it just about drive you up the wall cuz you can't preach hardly nowhere just just like that see so now but in the meantime they don't know he's living this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore they fac the Hopeless struggle of trying to cope with with events and circumstances that reduce them to hopeless failures how many in here is this morning is a hopeless failure cuz you hav't I'm going talk to you plain now anybody that's groping around scratching around like you hopeless failure because the Christ has been risen resurrected with barley loaves breaking them off in here every day for over 8 and 1/2 years and you is a you asham to be walking around in here in that condition and knowing that he's risen this morning you won't take him you just refuse to take him see therefore we nothing but hopeless failures the resurrection of Christ is an item present in their belief by intellect see but is absent in their behavior you say that the Lord is in me I'm saved I believe the message well then show it to me show it to me you said that the Malachi 4 gave the word and we have this message here and we're on our way to heaven and the word will overcome every devil well then overcome him then amen [Applause] that's or do you say the devil's fighting me can't make it you it's a hopeless failure I don't know what happened to me I was doing okay and so doing okay when you mean if you if you're in a battle you think that they're going to stop boy uh Field Marshal sin k out there they were firing you think the FBI is going to stop and maybe they fire back like you said I'm doing okay and I'm not I'm not doing okay well you kidding or what it's a every 24 hours a day the devil is blasting zero in on you don't you let me tell you something this morning don't you know that the seed the word is in you hidden it's a little light about the about the size of a little button and 200,000,000 demons out in in the Heavenly see those buttons around the earth in every city in every country where the message has gone is a little button of light and they zero in on top of you that's what you're feeling now you know that so don't be no children and fall down every day and let them demons bind you you know what I mean now get away from Delila Sams and the Philistines up on you my Samson the Philistines up on you you know what I mean now oh my SS the philistin is upon you get out of the thing in the first place they wouldn't be upon you what are you doing in there what are you fool around that sin for what are you messing around in there if you mess with they going to bind you amen praise God so where that light is demons are going to follow you that's right and this is for the matured ones this is the Sons and Daughters of God who going to purpose this morning well devil I know you're going to Hound me until I leave here but you're in for a fight where they at where they at this morning oh hopeless little babies grel around in the dirt yes your brother going to say something wrong to you yes your sister going to say something nasty to you but so what bless them love covers a multitude of sins now suppose you had just finished reading love covers a multitude of sin and the Lord open up to you and bless your kns up on you walk outside and somebody say them evil to you that noing is up on you sorry right so getting your blessing see what I mean that's that come from what reading the word that's where if you don't read the word how you going to get strong amen I'm still I'm still down in Puerto Rico amen amen amen see but who's going to stand for God look at David face the entire thing out there look what David saying when that devil said I'm going to I'm going to feed you to the fouls over there and can you imagine us today would look at that size 9 ft tall muscles like this here the eyes you know I me now look at you look through your eyes you look at what they say or what you feel you're going by feelings and what you see but oh my David look at the word of God he said are you crazy he said one of one of us will chase 1,000 of you Devils two will put 10,000 to rout he was on the word aren't we on the word don't you know that Jesus Christ already conquered every devil he already give us the land he's already RIS that's why these devils are howling today they know you are victorious greater is he is in you and he is in the world we are Victorious this morning we are no more children we are Sons and Daughters of God and we on our way to the promised land brother amen the devil knows it's here but he can't find nobody in the method to believe it they listen to the lar V while praise God Jonah was down in the in the belly of a whale or great fish down there and all down the midst of all those in because the intestines and what not down that fish's belly the sliming and all down in there can you imagine he was in all that clb in the fish belly and he said these are Lon vanities I don't a nothing amen he said I'm not in nothing it's ly vanities it's a devil I don't care what I see with my eye I'm looking away to God's house I'm looking to Solomon's Prayer my praise God where are those Sons and Daughters of God and no more children Walling around in the dirt God he amen praise God where they at let me give you a little illustration and because and close out this morning I feel we got some uh spiritual ones here now amen praise the Lord illustration a physical birth to a spiritual birth each person begins his physical Life as a baby and a child we understand that then uh Jesus Christ said except uh ye be except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven so we begin ours in spiritual as little children is that right amen now excuse me to uh because to receive spiritual life one must uh become as little children now a healthy newborn baby begins to grow physically and continues growing uh then through his life because he acquires all the skills of sitting crawling walking recognizing responding and speaking is that right amen I got you this morning amen as the years go by he attends school and develops more skills then uh normal growth through the stages of a child a teenager and also adult now all this is normal and this is expected is that right can we say amen amen all right then it's our spiritual life we are little children young men and fathers that right first John 2 that right little children young man and father see now sometimes s the the abnormal occurs and a child does not develop those necessary skills which lead to adult life one of the most uh pathetic sits in the world is to see an adult with the brain of a four-year-old child that right a strong of Limb and body but the brain of a little foury child and they can cope with the world see that's a terrible sight it is see and this is not normal and when it happens special measures are necessary because the life is not designed to operate on such unbalanced conditions it shouldn't be that way see now then special measures is needed more attention more nursing more provision but with no possible hope of the child accepting responsibility you follow me now okay now Hebrews 512 through 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 1-3 refer to certain Christians who were still babes in their spirit growth and Paul said my you still I have to speak to you as carnal is that right because in Corinthia and over in Hebrews he said why you have uh need of uh of you should be having meat now you should be teachers and I still have to give you milk is that right amen see then who and so therefore they needed to be fed on milk their behavior was characterized by all the limitations of babyhood they were unre they were unreliable in their responses unreasonable in their demands and unable to accept responsibility or make decisions oh yeah it's here this morning I'm going to say it that's here we are now I'm laying you out a baby here's a baby and I'm going to let you see it you see they had never grown up they were still babies there is the tragedy today in the bride the Corinthian group could not go on to Perfection because they kept misbehaving fornication contention jealousy Strife bitterness I'm because this man and that man and even this group said because we have Christ I have Christ therefore they were saying we don't want nothing to do with none of you guys you see so you had four groups there you see I mean now and you had the Hebrew group and they couldn't go on to profession because of the things that they refus to do therefore Paul said come come on Hebrew group let's go on to Perfection better things are persuaded for you and they wouldn't go and the other group kept the same thing over and over and over into sin back and forth and stripes and emulations and whatnot they couldn't go on and the Hebrew group they couldn't go on so Paul why let me go over to Ephesians oh amen be no more children tossed to and fro with every wind of dark and we are here this morning we have arrived amen the people trusted God years ago but we're still babes in Christ many of us now these kind Corinthia and and also Hebrew they are spiritual abnormalities because of their age and status you expect to see them honest matur Christians working with these young people and helping them now I'm telling about you older ones in the faith here you sisters and what not should be with these young sisters helping them and inspiring them and praying with them should be matured Christian workers not coming yourself falling down help me pray no you're strong you're young men in spiritual growth you left the little children because you know your sins are forgiven you're saved and you know the father and you're going to heaven but go on from there that's good knowledge but go on and get the knowledge of Ephesians the knowledge of the Son of God go on and get that knowledge over in second Peter 1 amen add to your faith and so forth so get that knowledge and then become a young man like Joshua was a young man he nursed the promise he had a promise now I'll be with you wherever you go at and then one day he believed that he stated in the word see like the young men do and they have three things also because of of the young men they have uh let me read it here the three things because they have here first

then and he went among the office and get our victual among get them ready get them circumcised we're going over he said he going to be with us and he went forward on faith and the Red Sea open I mean and and the Jordan open up then God told him tear down Jericho he had a promise now I'll be with you then Joshua in his human mind sat up there look down on Jericho how can I do it this man here how can I do it see then uh all of a sudden somebody was standing there amen the captain of the horses right on the scene who AR th with us or against it he says nay I'm the captain of the host a man he's here this morning he's standing right here now he said Joshua stop trying to figure out this circumstance that you're in right now stop trying to figure out your problem this that you have this

Arizona go over here go over no read the Bible in your house read it there where God is with you standing with the SW drawing every time you come he's there and You observe to do what he tell you to do he'll be right with you then God says walk around there and when I bid them people to shout when I tell them to shout then they'll shout then the walls come down and that's the way it is that's all we've done here he gave us a promise and we chopped them promises out brother ain't been nobody to help you it's just but I know he said I'll be with you said Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection and I'm not going to rest until I see that Perfection glory to God I know I sold some seed for some Perfection and he told me you may have wept for all these years but you're going to bring forth them sheaves with joy in your heart now that's what he said and I believe it and I'm looking for them sheaves this morning I'm looking for some strong young men joshu ways for you have those three things of word of God's in you he abided with you and so forth and you have over come the wicked one you have also the the two things of the young children your sins are forgiven also and you know the father but there's the fathers there's the real Christian matured Believers there's the ones in Romans 12 for service they're getting ready the fathers and then with the fathers he takes the fathers into the counil of the Loos oh my the pfy comes down and picks up some matured seeds from Ephesians takes them up into the ghost and reveals to them what the Seven Seals is all about and then reveals to them what he's getting ready to do in the seven Thunders gives them Rapture in faith but they're ready they're young men they have overcome all these things they have stopped being Corinthian babes and also Hebrew babes spiritual abnormalities and they're ready to go on do you believe that friends are you ready to go on this morning amen praise God or do you still want to be a spiritual ad normaly where many precious hours are spent caring for you and cuz you need care for nursing you don't or won't grow up and handling like small children do you still need it this morning 8 years later that that's what you want you see so little children your sins are forgiven yes it's and you know the father but go to Perfection please I mean the Malachi for sold for a bride I mean a bride like the early bride you know what I mean now that can take a hold of word of God not a h house plant need to be sprayed all the time you know what I mean amen see they are easily upset and always demand their own way and they come into you I can't understand why can't I do this here why can't I go there say oh baby then then then you have to stick a pacifying them see and see therefore they suck if they will at this cross to get mad you see they can never be trusted to take responsibility or they have something to say about respons if somebody is in charge then they going to have something to say in their heart against it after you got anything to say to your brother your sister well say it to them don't murmur and complain in your heart if I have anything to say to brother Hunt I tell it to him he knows that or brother Tony or any anyone I tell it to your face go to the person's face you got to all tell it otherwise shut up don't go to tell another person put that person in sin you know when I'm going to wait when I get a chance I'm going to really you going to do what tell to them now in love amen see don't uh put that in your heart and the Holy Spirit go away see so now they can't take responsibility they cannot produce results that will bless the church and we're looking for the real mature one that will bless this church here amen with their gifts and abilities and so forth so their little children see and they have to go on as such see but you're strong and the word of God abide now how can the word of God abide in you when you read it when you take it amen therefore that is the hour that we are here now friends do you believe that there do you believe the lord loves you now huh well then friends the promised living breathing resurrected word is here this morning with every promise and A promise is hidden food and here's here's what really kills me when you don't don't take the word that is a promise that was just for you that was just ready to almost give you nourishment see it's a revelation but if you back away then you don't get that that nourishment that would have set you free that's all I'm trying to say so when the word is preached there's going to be like this morning there's going to be nourishment but when you walked in here it was a wall you see the me now the wall is down then you can't get get the nurse you can't be set free then you remain a spiritual abnormality and God can't have that no more we're going on to a Perfection amen for the hidden promises listen when Joshua was like any other man when Moses died can you imagine but when he got there he was called for the job if God has called you he will equip you you think God going to have you face Satan you not fa because facing Satan that's him he says this is my battle I have a promise I'm going to be in your body that's all but the battle is the Lord's it's not your battle it's God's battle and David knew it was the Lord's battle so David all he had to do was to go out there and be on the scene and testify and David told him he said are you crazy he said the god that the God now that delivered me from the poor of the beer and the lion that God shall deliver me from this uncircumcised Philistine well that same God that saved you give you that revelation will deliver you from any problem that you got this morning I don't care what you say your problem is this morning God will deliver you that God will deliver you that God will deliver you this morning that God is now delivering you from whatever it is praise that was him speaking back it wasn't me amen praise the Lord naan praise God oh Church be no more children the resur rection of Christ today has released every promise the promises is hidden food amen and it's a secret the Risen Lord is the one who makes possible our complete enjoyment of the Glorious promises hidden away in the word of God do you believe that it is the enjoyment of these promises that make possible life where sin is restrained temptation is resisted and fear is neutralized and anxiety and depression lose their power through the promises amen can you imagine the fear anxiety and depression that fell upon Joshua when Moses left over 2 million people to deal with and here he was just there you see but he was the one that was in that tent with Moses in a tent a meeting in there he had been in there praying and whatnot see he'd watched the man of God move so he knew to trust in the Lord and then God spoke to him and says every place where you put your foot at that's yours don't worry about it see when they got over there to Jericho he put down his foot said take off your shoes for the soul of your feet that was the same thing he told Moses it's the same thing he tells you today amen see therefore therefore we we are here friends the generation is all anxiety infatuated with filth and whatnot but God is calling us to Holiness and the Risen Christ has made this all possible in our experience in our experience now he has released all of the promises of God to us the peace can be ours this morning that inner peace that termoil inside am I saved am I not Sav I know what goes on in a lot of your minds why did I do this I must not be in the brght that's the devil why did I make a mistake make a mistake make a mistake every day you understand now you will make a mistake every day but there's a blood atonement for you confess it right away see because you have secret food the hour is here for the message and the messenger to become one spiritual food in Du season he said all them prophets live in the spirit of God until they became one with the word then he says church do you see what I'm trying to tell you this morning the word is in the person the sick is healed with a word the cripples rise up and they walk amen the blind eyes open up the dead is raised why the message and The Messengers are one and the only way we can become one is one with the word I'm trying to tell you this morning the message the taped message and spoken word message was a revealed message which was in the Bible and it it was a message of Prophecy it prophesied about all the things happening which you couldn't really understand it here because you couldn't locate it out here but it had to be a prophet to locate it and put it here then while you see the tapes and all these things it gives you Faith cuz you read it and you see it com to pass and you hear it you it makes you have more muscles but what that all this here for is to get you back here then if what he said as come to pass won't what it says here in you come to pass that's all that's all for 10 years I've been trying to say to you if the prophet had to read the same word God is trying to get you to read this morning and what he read with a message and it came to pass all these things happen you understand and we've seen it happen for over 10 years now all these things in there is that right now this day he says be no more children you know it's right you know it works well I want to work through you this morning I want to bring to pass every promise that he had in him I want to bring it to pass in you amen but he read my word you understand he read the same Bible here Ando but he had a message but the Bible declared that we have a message also Revelation 2217 says the spirit and the bride say come but you got to be reading the word for it is a reading of the word that gives you the spiritual muscles that's that's one that give you the strength is reading other the word it gets into your heart and tells you what to do and what to say and whatnot you understand me now that's how you know so therefore uh listen the listen as we meditate on the word the word comes to Lodge in your heart in your mind amen then the word within your heart and your mind starts to speak back to you you know that the word speaks but if you don't read how can speak back to you I want to know if you don't read the word how can the word speak back to you then it begins to convict you before you come here now before you come in here it convicts you of sins of thought and deed and before you even get in the house of God I mean you are convicted cuz you're reading the word the anointing shall teach you is that right then it shows you how you ought to behave in such and such a situation it's in the word every s say nothing new Under The Sun It's All in here already happened everything that could happen happened already you understand only different people in a different setting but the things has already happened every situation has all this is brother you don't understand my trouble no I do understand has already happened if you read this it tell you how to get out of it amen see if you read this will tell you how to get out of it see and then it'll show you what your actions and reactions should be and you won't come in here all down cuz you already have read the word during the week and in prayer and you're just a strong spiritual mature Christian come in to help somebody you see a little one like you say you walk over God bless your sister how you feeling so forth so on and you've been in the word and all day then God can usually put you in service amen and speak not what your mind but the Holy Spirit say it have to be in a word now see now therefore our response to the in workking of the word of God is the measure of the success that we're going to have in God's sight our response to what we have read and what we have heard that's all he can use you understand that and then you have that success because he told Joshua meditate day and night and observe to do what's written here and you shall have success and we'll have the same thing um the world is longing to see a faith that works now a faith has been delivered to the saints of God and we are contending for that faith is that right we are contending for the faith that was once delivered and was delivered Again by Malachi 4 amen now this is only possible that the world will see it if we be no more children there's no other way they just won't see it through you cuz you'll still be walling around see now Hebrews 12 and 3:19 Revelation rather chastening is child training and it's in the lay out of sea age that God calls out some children from leosa and chastens them and rebukes them with sickness Temptations trials problems and those things is for child training so when you fuss and stew against the problems the situations then every son which cometh to God must be child trained otherwise he is not one of mine now if Christ had to go through the same thing what about you and I brother B had to go through the same thing he had a throne in his flesh Paul had Thor his flesh brother BR it was a little animal 6 in long but it would be made well so we have thorns well thank God for the thorn I've been sick in my body for years we're retired it's I got to go with it because other words I'm saying I say Lord if you will only give me some strength in my body then I I can really do something for you then I'm saying Lord I'll do it in my strength amen but if I'm perfectly weak I can't do nothing then he can show his strength in my weakness amen so when I become totally weak in in myself then God can be totally strong amen so when we have problems and situations we're weak then he comes on the scene he's strong but you got to believe he will come on the scene there where the devil Cuts you off so he's not coming but then you run his hand out of here I'll chop your head or get your hand out of here he is coming amen then then something touches you you feel something come down your shoulder Holy Spirit comes all over here the hand of the Lord moves down and you say oh then you get strong don't you oh you feel good you're ready to stand and challenge any devil let him come amen praise the Lord that's the way it does it see so now why does he do this here two things partaketh of his Holiness Hebrews 12:11 and it ye yields the Peaceable fruit of righteousness he only is chastised those who he loved that they might be holy then in sewing this holy seed then they have the fruit of righteousness then he plucks it up he takes his second ride that's all it's all about this word is thrust at you seven times in seven verses now I'm going to say something I spoke on this before a little blessing to you maybe chastening is connected to the problems around us he chastens us with these problems can you see that can you be no more babies and Waller in in the problems but be like Paul says Lord therefore will our glory in my infirmities therefore will I glory in every situation circumstance that when I am weak and I can't do nothing that you might be made strong in me are you ready to say that this morning yeah you wives I know what you're going through with your unsaved husbands and whatnot and husband unsaved wives and all kind of situations you're going through literal hell with your children maybe all messed up in the street and what not you're fighting your daughters with the sex devil trying to get up on them and your sons and whatnot it's literal hell to you those are problems but he's only chastising you see he know what he's doing and not one shall be lost oh no he ain't never lost none he ain't never lost a thatle he never will lose brother yes sir everyone is coming they'll all be there amen because some come through hard trials and some through the flood amen and so forth and some through the waters but all through the blood they'll all be there amen they'll come different ways but he'll get them praise the lord we are called upon not to despise the chasing of the lord we told that whom the Lord loveth he chasten and we are not without chastisement then we are not true Sons if we are so that's what we have to come through this morning but he carth for you he carth for you shall We Stand amen don't you love him he carth for [Applause] you through sunshine or shame car for you
