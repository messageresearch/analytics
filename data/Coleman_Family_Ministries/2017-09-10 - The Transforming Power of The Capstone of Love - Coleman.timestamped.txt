[5:37] make out of itself exactly what I wanted
[5:39] to be God has never changed it's the
[5:42] same today as he was then God is

[5:50] I say he'll do it
[5:53] yes sir Oh Cory now remember the secret
[5:57] only come forth with the power of life
[5:59] within it to transform it from a seed to
[6:03] a plan or whatever it was by his
[6:06] transforming power and God put the word
[6:09] seed in there with his potentials that
[6:11] it would be what he said it would be and
[6:13] as long as the state in the right
[6:15] category it would be exactly what God
[6:17] said it would be and each are and each
[6:21] age of those seeds has power in itself
[6:23] each one of those seeds rather aiming to
[6:26] transform itself into the species that I
[6:29] desire it to be that oh that's what I
[6:33] want
[6:34] oh that's what it must be I have given
[6:36] every seed transforming power to make
[6:39] out of itself in its potentials to make
[6:43] out of itself exactly what I want it to
[6:45] be how we thank God for this evening
[6:48] time promise of God from malacara fall
[6:51] for the end time bride oh I thank him
[6:55] and I praise them mine how are we
[6:59] transform into this image of Christ amen
[7:02] now how is it done on page 15 God's
[7:06] transforming power this is the way it's
[7:09] done but I'm so glad paragraph 110 and
[7:14] through 112 I'm so glad that God is
[7:17] mindful us again are you glad that God
[7:20] is mindful of you again
[7:23] oh I'm glad that here so Lord has my
[7:26] hand it's you're mindful of me to send
[7:28] me a prophet praise God how'd it get out
[7:31] of here how to escape I'm so glad that
[7:35] God is mindful us again that he can
[7:37] still move upon the face of the
[7:39] perdition
[7:40] you promised he would do it and call the
[7:43] little flock which would be his bride
[7:45] now what he getting sad about he
[7:48] promised to do this and he's going to do
[7:50] it yes
[7:53] notice here again now how perfect these
[7:55] churches churches type are these Eaton's
[7:58] now watch God through a seed of his word
[8:01] there's only one thing that can quick in
[8:04] a word and that is the spirit for it is
[8:07] the life giver to the word now now
[8:11] here's now here's the mystery here now
[8:13] watch when the life endure so you must
[8:17] be born again see otherwise it's a word
[8:20] seed and you will be born again but if
[8:22] you have the Holy Ghost now and you want
[8:25] to know how to climb or kiss right here
[8:26] if and he says them and when the life in
[8:30] the word that sent you down in faith
[8:34] meets the life of the Spirit of cherry
[8:38] the Holy Spirit coming down it produces
[8:41] whatever the seat is did you get it the
[8:46] life in the word amen for this age look
[8:50] at it then the Holy Spirit knows what
[8:53] the life is because the Spirit is a word
[8:55] and the word is the spirit so therefore
[8:59] the life of the Spirit can only
[9:00] transform what the life in the seed is
[9:05] that's all so they wait around here for
[9:09] all these kind of things they're not
[9:11] gonna happen
[9:11] he's gonna transform it according to the
[9:14] life in the sea when the dynamics fly
[9:18] over their brother it'll be according to
[9:20] what life is in that seed and I know
[9:22] what I put in these seas here adoption
[9:25] time signs wonders miracles then let
[9:29] those potentials will be because a
[9:32] transforming power will sweep over
[9:34] praise God and strike that life and now
[9:37] they'll come to pass and you'll see
[9:39] Jesus Oh hallelujah Malachi 4 promise or
[9:45] on Satan's eatin amen did you get that
[9:49] now the life and see you sitting there
[9:51] wonder how am I gonna get up get to the
[9:54] top
[9:54] well the holy goes up in the Rainbows
[9:56] when that life breaks in here see it's
[9:59] here now but it's gonna pour gusher then
[10:02] when that life in the rainbow strikes
[10:03] the life and faith it begins to
[10:06] transform it doing anything you're doing
[10:10] in you just fall into his footsteps and
[10:14] when he leads you that's where you go
[10:16] and he will send you trials praise God
[10:21] and don't you Welch say I did I I did it
[10:25] Lord amen praise God
[10:29] the trials are gonna come down to try
[10:32] every virtue in you oh I hope you can
[10:37] get that is gonna try to hurt you in you
[10:40] sure so don't try to back up and make
[10:43] excuses don't get self pity spirits
[10:48] you know self-pity sit back there and
[10:52] just feel sorry for itself all the time
[10:55] God can't do nothing for you
[10:57] just all-time I don't know why me and
[11:01] okay page 14 Satan's Eden's having faith
[11:05] in all of his word his seed brought an
[11:08] Eden of holiness love and eternal life
[11:12] that is what God's eating produces
[11:15] holiness and it brought an Eden of
[11:18] holiness of love understanding
[11:21] perfection and eternal life amen
[11:25] that is what God is planning now don't
[11:30] tell God that his plans are not gonna be
[11:32] complete because you did get the Holy
[11:35] Ghost yet because you didn't get here
[11:38] yet what kind of prayer are you praying
[11:42] Lord fulfilling your prayer in me
[11:45] [Music]
[11:47] [Applause]
[11:48] yes sir that is what God is planning his
[11:53] word his see that is what his church
[11:57] will be at the end it would be the same
[12:00] thing
[12:02] didn't you say that the three full
[12:04] revelation of Jesus Christ in the crisis
[12:07] missive God revealed what was a
[12:09] three-fold mystery now God have any
[12:12] preeminence in Christ
[12:15] number one number two Christ have any
[12:20] preeminence in the brand for what to
[12:23] bring her back to Eden praise God
[12:29] now here's a thought don't forget it
[12:31] I'll get it to some other time on some
[12:34] other message but you know God said let
[12:37] every seed bring forth of his kind is
[12:40] that God's commandment now what good is
[12:42] any preacher on anybody else to try and
[12:45] make that word say something else yeah
[12:50] you react it's what I'm saying now and a
[12:53] man the all these guys that raise up say
[12:55] it won't be that and it won't be this it
[12:57] won't be that he said well what good is
[12:59] it for them to do that when his word is
[13:02] a seed well why would these Falls know
[13:06] any guys rise up after the parents of
[13:08] plant I mean after the Prophet planted
[13:10] the seeds and they rise up against them
[13:13] and saying they say you don't need the
[13:14] Holy Ghost like that and it's the more
[13:16] science than ones they don't do it no
[13:17] more like that
[13:18] he's why would they do that he said
[13:21] every word is a seed then these men's
[13:24] try to change then Jesus sent this seed
[13:27] a soul a soul so if st. Mark's 16 is
[13:30] God's Word it will bring forth of his
[13:33] kind
[13:35] in this age in this church amen
[13:40] enroll allegedly ha snake the Trinidad
[13:44] man praise God praise God
[13:47] Gouri hallelujah praise God amen
[13:54] every word is a sea of God is a see
[13:57] Jesus said so the source old so in st.

[14:04] Malachi enforce God's Word it would
[14:06] bring forth of his kind and every other
[14:09] promise must bring forth of his kind you
[14:13] know what I'm saying
[14:14] where's acts 2:38 by the poem repent and
[14:18] be baptized and you what you shall you
[14:22] shall hallelujah that's there for
[14:27] eternity Reseda give her the Holy Ghost
[14:30] that will bring for them as kind in you
[14:34] ha
[14:36] praise God I felt fire on that brother
[14:40] that's a word see nobody can change it
[14:45] hey man you may be seated
[14:48] glory to God that's what God is planning
[14:51] was worded see us with His Church at the
[14:53] end it'd be the same thing
[14:55] praise God amen if st. mark 16 st. John
[15:00] 14:12 1420 it's regions for the 2nd
[15:05] Peter 1:4 through 8 Galatians 5:22 is
[15:08] God's Word then it's a sea then it'll
[15:12] bring forth after its kind we're in this
[15:15] church
[15:16] in you just as sure as Malik God's words
[15:22] see st. mark us a Malachi for st. Luke's
[15:28] 1730 revelation 10 1 through 7 that
[15:32] brought forth anther is kind will so
[15:36] will the rest of these seeds
[15:38] praise God at the Prophet penny for this
[15:40] pride in the last days hallelujah he
[15:43] applaud his spirit upon these seeds and
[15:45] you bring forth after your kind don't be
[15:49] discouraged and I be encouraged praise
[15:51] God cuz you're on the verge of the
[15:53] greatest outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[15:56] praise that at the world has seen since
[15:59] the days of the Apostles Oh hallelujah
[16:02] be encouraged to me praise God Oh glory
[16:08] in area the premise must come forth of
[16:10] his kind
[16:12] hallelujah every see at this cannot
[16:14] bring forth and then every see will come
[16:16] for that this kind may be seated and
[16:18] that's my inspiration today Malachi 4
[16:21] reveal Haman that Joseph's perfection
[16:25] was the capstone word I've been over and
[16:28] over and over through 10 as the forth
[16:30] light upon door Luther was the first
[16:33] Wesley's second Pentecost of the third
[16:35] and Joseph was the fourth light upon the
[16:39] world therefore I conclude tonight on
[16:41] his last message here this ain't mess
[16:44] before I go take a rest therefore I
[16:47] conclude that Joseph's perfection caps
[16:49] don't worry is the seed the time that
[16:52] age the word then that be sold
[16:55] let the same God that said let there be
[16:58] light let that car tonight say let show
[17:02] the perfection see come forth after its
[17:05] kind hallelujah with the potentials in
[17:10] it
[17:11] to climb that pyramid tree you may be
[17:15] seated
[17:15] what kind of a seat is Joseph's
[17:17] perfection a perfect type of Christ then
[17:21] what will come forth a perfect type of
[17:23] Christ I laid this thing down for you
[17:26] praise God for 16 years
[17:29] hallelujah is going to be every seat at
[17:32] his own kind

[19:15] God made a man in His image after his
[19:18] caring to be his word on earth he
[19:21] express it in Jesus Christ what was God
[19:24] was in Christ that's the man after his
[19:27] caring see when God which is a word I
[19:30] mean knows he's a word when the word was
[19:33] in Christ a man human man expressed
[19:36] himself through him that was God the
[19:40] word in Christ expressing himself and
[19:43] God in the beginning made man in his own
[19:46] image let us make man in our image and
[19:50] Elohim said to the logos let us make man
[19:54] our amateur theophany praise God male a
[19:59] female made he them man a woman is one
[20:04] they don't break that it's God's law

[20:29] like it wasn't beginning so inshallah
[20:31] being in hallelujah glory amen
[20:39] and gotta be gettin made man in his own
[20:42] image and that's the kind of man that
[20:44] God makes today a man the seminary in a
[20:50] cube act you know incubator of hatchery
[20:53] turns out a bunch of hybrids see the
[20:55] schools but when God calls a man he's in
[20:58] his own image the word made him alive
[21:01] into him now when God calls you out of
[21:03] lay out of seer and put you up the end
[21:05] of rainbows as the kind he makes right
[21:10] on the chart call out of lay out of seer
[21:13] brotherly kindness and put in the
[21:16] rainbows as a stone that's the kind of
[21:20] man of God makes prayers cut right in
[21:23] front of you see it open your open eyes
[21:26] phrase cut yes sir Amen the word made
[21:33] alive in him that's right there is
[21:34] that's God's man man in his own image
[21:37] and it is very likeness and Jesus said
[21:41] that he'll do the works that I do so God
[21:43] made man in his own image after his kind
[21:47] now you're not going to get the dynamics
[21:50] first
[21:53] I felt them yes sir
[21:56] you're gonna get character hey man you
[22:01] receive the Holy Ghost sure at the
[22:02] bottom but don't look for those great
[22:05] signs and wonders American before you
[22:06] form character amen because the power
[22:08] without character is satanic you don't
[22:13] want to go back to Al and all of them
[22:15] again do you want your trunk it's in
[22:17] whoremongers praise God which signs
[22:18] wonders and miracles oh we don't want
[22:20] that that's why God brought this message
[22:22] here
[22:23] they won't hand that again every c2b
[22:25] after his own kind we have a bunch of
[22:29] Pentecostal miss prays cut have a Jesus
[22:33] man God man walking his feet in 20th
[22:35] century
[22:36] praise God talking like God walking like
[22:39] God praise God looking like not doing
[22:41] like God Amen hallelujah yes
[22:49] there is God's man
[22:52] maybe situ made his own image in his
[22:55] very likeness and Jesus said that he'll
[22:57] do the works that I do so God made man
[23:00] in his own image after his kind his kind
[23:04] what is his kind he is the word then if
[23:08] a man denies God word how can he be in
[23:12] God's image just ask the question
[23:14] yourself how can you be in God's image
[23:16] and deny God's Word
[23:18] see no way you see or when the words
[23:22] expresses is Express image of himself or
[23:26] you say it doesn't mean that express
[23:27] image of God he said yes in his own
[23:30] image it's page 57 of his kind to be his
[23:35] express word on earth now Jesus was
[23:38] God's Express word do you believe that
[23:40] then what are we to be sons of God to
[23:44] with Express Word in the church carrying
[23:47] on that's the mystical body of Christ
[23:50] carrying on the same work that Jesus did
[23:53] when he was here see that's the kind
[23:56] after his kind let shows a perfection
[24:03] see come forth after his kind which is a
[24:07] Jesus man perfect type of Christ for the

[38:04] place that that the word is a seed and

[38:29] said the fourth light the word and the
[38:32] word is a seed is Joseph's perfection
[38:34] and you have revelation if that's you

[38:41] age then when you become one then the
[38:44] water falls upon you praise God not only

[38:52] this and why is God doing that and
[38:54] crying little babies oh my god

[39:02] your life until you become the word
[39:04] until you accept your temptation and
[39:06] your trial that you have tonight except
[39:10] every trial that you have tonight and
[39:13] then you own your way
[39:20] a man if I tell you if you lose one
[39:23] daughter and I come and tell you what to
[39:25] do with the second daughter you don't do
[39:26] that you lose the second daughter but
[39:29] you can change that tonight if you want
[39:30] to they already told you not to do that

[39:37] but I ain't gonna tell you that I got
[39:39] discernment I'm just gonna speak to you
[39:41] but you shouldn't no I got it therefore
[39:48] you should trust me and if you don't
[39:50] trust me you don't get nothing nothing
[39:57] no it's kind of strong but what he said
[40:02] put the prophecy it anyway spoke a word
[40:06] original seat book - is it near he says
[40:07] you can only live by the way the
[40:09] Warriors interpreted to you by the man
[40:11] and got on there okay here we are and
[40:15] that the Christian the children of God -
[40:17] the children the kingdom has become the
[40:18] seed of God then they must be the Word
[40:22] of God the Word of God manifested
[40:25] Joseph's perfection see in the age that
[40:28] they are living in for the promised seed
[40:30] of that age God gave his word at the
[40:34] beginning and each age has had a seed as
[40:37] time his promises that's why they're
[40:40] preaching that's it for all these years
[40:42] oh my you get it I want to cut it off
[40:46] here I'm tired the word is the scene
[40:49] every scene will bring forth is Karen
[40:51] now the children of the kingdom to come
[40:52] the seed of God then they must be the
[40:54] Word of God the Word of God manifested
[40:56] in the age that they are living in for
[40:59] the promised seed of that age and
[41:01] Malachi 4 said Luther Wesley
[41:03] Pentecostals and Joseph perfection and
[41:05] Luther with justification and Wesley
[41:07] with sanctification Pentecostals the
[41:09] Holy Spirit in the gifts and Joseph
[41:11] affection is what the capstone word and
[41:13] we become the capstone
[41:17] which is chose the perfection the word
[41:20] we make up to capstone do you understand
[41:23] that the Lord Himself descended with a
[41:27] shout the Brinn and the Prophet laid it
[41:30] out all the mysteries say that's the
[41:32] word and you accept all of it you become
[41:34] what the word and there's nowhere else
[41:37] to go but the capstone and the word
[41:43] comes first then the Spirit comes behind
[41:45] it then I just read it
[41:49] Joseph eventually capstone word this is
[41:52] the age of total perfection and there's
[41:54] got to be a manifestation of the seed
[41:56] where it shows of affection and each age
[41:59] has had a seed as time is promises and
[42:03] God said RH Malachi 4 saint-lo 1730
[42:06] revelation 10 st. John 14:12 then the
[42:10] brown age Oh Myka huh that right Omega
[42:13] restoration of the original Brad tree
[42:16] and the people of that age that
[42:18] manifests that promise word is the seed
[42:21] of the age so you don't have to go
[42:26] around showing off who you are and
[42:27] whatever you want to manifest it say
[42:32] nothing just flows out of you it flows
[42:36] like a river praise God I think I'm a

[52:47] God saw the light that it was good and
[52:49] God divided the light from the darkness
[52:51] and when God sends the light is
[52:52] scattered as a darkness so God illah him
[52:55] spoke through Malachi 4 and said in and
[52:58] for our day let Joseph effects you see
[53:00] come forth after his kind yes so when

[54:49] earth period now the world was without
[54:52] form and void and I said I believe every

[1:17:42] important facet of the metalworking
[1:17:45] industry a specific procedure used for a
[1:17:48] specific purpose
[1:17:49] honing is the final phase of creating an
[1:17:53] internal diameter when both size and
[1:17:58] finished quality are of utmost
[1:18:00] importance the first phase is drilling
[1:18:05] the hole removing the bulk of material
[1:18:08] quickly whereas fire

[1:18:26] and achieving a very good finish and
[1:18:28] accuracy of size on the average
[1:18:31] circumstances these two phases are good
[1:18:33] enough for commercial work sometimes a
[1:18:37] supreme finish and tight tolerances are
[1:18:41] required this is when honing is
[1:18:44] performed special stones mounted on an
[1:18:49] arbor are spun inside and the bore in
[1:18:54] the presence of special oils amen
[1:18:58] removing minut amounts of material the
[1:19:02] oil flushes out the specs the material
[1:19:05] and cleanses the pores of the stones Oh

[1:29:15] identifying see now we're gonna have two
[1:29:18] we have got a ministry coming that's
[1:29:21] just exactly like the life of Christ I
[1:29:23] wonder if it will identify the voice of

[1:29:52] holy and acceptable to God which is your
[1:29:55] reasonable service and be not conformed

[1:30:06] of God
[1:30:07] the statue of a perfect man is the only
