[Music] yes sir but now after we got our first three steps which come from God God gave the faith God gave he heals and he gives spiritual knowledge now what are we going to do with it we know he's here and and he give us these things to a special group and we got it Vindicated by the miraculous now but what are we going to do with it well here we are this morning we're going to find out now these next four things is what we do with what we got if other words now Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kinds of what we can do now they are that's what we can do in appreciation back oh my God you did this for me that Lord I I'm coming out of the world that that's it I'm going to live for you I'm going to breathe for you I'm going to walk for you talk for you amen I want to sleep and die for you amen so Lord I need some Temperance in these little family Affairs and all these things going on around here well that's what we talking about this morning now cuz Peter didn't have any Temperance he said I right go uh what do they want to do you know fussing stewing screaming holling what not no Temperance no self-control over your life or your tongue or what you're thinking or your th see it got to be self-control Temperance amen my now we understand what is self-control and we need it don't we see now it's not just a mere external restraint I don't drink no more I don't smoke no it's past that I got a long dress and I stop cutting my hair no it's past that uh-uh on the inside see that's only on the outside amen see and I fast and I pray and all past that too see way on the inside amen that's a legalist there see we a talking about any legalism now see now but we talking about the cultivation of the inward history of the Soul day by day governing ourselves keeping ourselves in order and know this here if we cannot keep ourselves in order we cannot keep anyone else in order Temperance acquire a gravity of gravity of spirit that is uh equal in every circumstance see like Christ was never upset by any trial or anything that provokes you see now Temperance is active is self-control Temperance will keep me from saying or doing a thing that will wound you there you are if I got Temperance you can say anything to me that you want to and it's not and I ain't going to fly back at you and wound you though you said [Music] it amen see you dirty ho rolling you you understand what I mean or you should you take my hand or whatever it is you see amen see if you have not Temperance you will do something that will hurt somebody else if you don't have Temperance and ask the little babies going around to church make saying wrong things and doing things to hurt one another they a't got any Temperance they would they have no self-control over their mouth they just say anything there's no there's no Governor there to where is is the governor amen see we being instructed aren't we amen now see now what about hurting Christ and speaking about hurting one another with no temper but what about hurting Christ with our self-will and doing things that we shouldn't do we hurting him amen see and Peter said I go off fishing that was what he wanted to do see did you pray about it first see now this is Service uh without Christ and so many in in in the message running up and down with all kind of uh ideas of what they supposed to do for the Lord but if brother Bram told a brother he I want to go brother Bram to LP land somewhere and he says well that's fine Brother go ahead the Lord be with you no he said when I get to thinking about my wife and children he said well now if you want to wait on the Lord God will do more with you in 5 minutes than what you can do in a lifetime now we're speaking to those people who are willing from this day on to wait on the [Music] Lord he showed you already Sunday what he can do in 5 minutes he shows you he Save Somebody and heal a in 5 minutes and we didn't have anything to do with that at all he did it himself but we have the joy that the word goes out in New York City this was done so we stand there praise the Lord amen there we are see he give us the credit for doing it amen see that's that's Christ directed service that's what we're trying to separate today this this is of what you want to do and what he wants to wait to do that he do through you God wants to do a work through Sanctified vessel he wants to do it himself see and then turn around and give you a reward for what he did but if you only wait but they can't wait all these years since' 65 they the men had to run out couldn't wait and now God is moving amen see now what was Christ doing in St John 21 he he was uh uh um um here he was in P John 20 faith and virtue knowledge and now he's bringing in Temperance now praise God now what do you do for God with the first three virtues see now right now he wants us to die out to our self will or we stop going fishing what because we're asking him first about it or we stop doing what you want to do before praying about it that's what we're talking about this morning see now this is the message of the hour do you believe us friend
