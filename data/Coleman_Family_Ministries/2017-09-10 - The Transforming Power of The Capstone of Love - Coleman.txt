hallelujah it's all good I'll just rest each one of those sees has power in itself to see God knows God knows after the Prophet left who the predestinated seeds and he know that they have power within themselves so when he says the dynamics he already knows what's going to happen he's going to have this he knows that so why worry be happy' why worry [Applause] huh [Applause] Laurita got be happy while worried hallelujah even the man in the world said that praise God you may be seated Christian is unhappy yes I'll rest each one knows he has power in itself the Transformers itself into the species that I desire to be not what they want you to be but what he wants you to be I'm not gonna be what you want me to be I'm not gonna preach the way you want me to preach no I'm not gonna say the thing that you want me to say I want to say what I'm what he want me to say and when I say it I will deliver you and you and your family if you accept it in the beloved hallelujah you may be seated praise God a me that's what I desire to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in his potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I wanted to be God has never changed it's the same today as he was then God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing's gonna stop him he'll do it and I say he'll do it yes sir Oh Cory now remember the secret only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plan or whatever it was by his transforming power and God put the word seed in there with his potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as the state in the right category it would be exactly what God said it would be and each are and each age of those seeds has power in itself each one of those seeds rather aiming to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that oh that's what I want oh that's what it must be I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be how we thank God for this evening time promise of God from malacara fall for the end time bride oh I thank him and I praise them mine how are we transform into this image of Christ amen now how is it done on page 15 God's transforming power this is the way it's done but I'm so glad paragraph 110 and through 112 I'm so glad that God is mindful us again are you glad that God is mindful of you again oh I'm glad that here so Lord has my hand it's you're mindful of me to send me a prophet praise God how'd it get out of here how to escape I'm so glad that God is mindful us again that he can still move upon the face of the perdition you promised he would do it and call the little flock which would be his bride now what he getting sad about he promised to do this and he's going to do it yes notice here again now how perfect these churches churches type are these Eaton's now watch God through a seed of his word there's only one thing that can quick in a word and that is the spirit for it is the life giver to the word now now here's now here's the mystery here now watch when the life endure so you must be born again see otherwise it's a word seed and you will be born again but if you have the Holy Ghost now and you want to know how to climb or kiss right here if and he says them and when the life in the word that sent you down in faith meets the life of the Spirit of cherry the Holy Spirit coming down it produces whatever the seat is did you get it the life in the word amen for this age look at it then the Holy Spirit knows what the life is because the Spirit is a word and the word is the spirit so therefore the life of the Spirit can only transform what the life in the seed is that's all so they wait around here for all these kind of things they're not gonna happen he's gonna transform it according to the life in the sea when the dynamics fly over their brother it'll be according to what life is in that seed and I know what I put in these seas here adoption time signs wonders miracles then let those potentials will be because a transforming power will sweep over praise God and strike that life and now they'll come to pass and you'll see Jesus Oh hallelujah Malachi 4 promise or on Satan's eatin amen did you get that now the life and see you sitting there wonder how am I gonna get up get to the top well the holy goes up in the Rainbows when that life breaks in here see it's here now but it's gonna pour gusher then when that life in the rainbow strikes the life and faith it begins to transform it doing anything you're doing in you just fall into his footsteps and when he leads you that's where you go and he will send you trials praise God and don't you Welch say I did I I did it Lord amen praise God the trials are gonna come down to try every virtue in you oh I hope you can get that is gonna try to hurt you in you sure so don't try to back up and make excuses don't get self pity spirits you know self-pity sit back there and just feel sorry for itself all the time God can't do nothing for you just all-time I don't know why me and okay page 14 Satan's Eden's having faith in all of his word his seed brought an Eden of holiness love and eternal life that is what God's eating produces holiness and it brought an Eden of holiness of love understanding perfection and eternal life amen that is what God is planning now don't tell God that his plans are not gonna be complete because you did get the Holy Ghost yet because you didn't get here yet what kind of prayer are you praying Lord fulfilling your prayer in me [Music] [Applause] yes sir that is what God is planning his word his see that is what his church will be at the end it would be the same thing didn't you say that the three full revelation of Jesus Christ in the crisis missive God revealed what was a three-fold mystery now God have any preeminence in Christ number one number two Christ have any preeminence in the brand for what to bring her back to Eden praise God now here's a thought don't forget it I'll get it to some other time on some other message but you know God said let every seed bring forth of his kind is that God's commandment now what good is any preacher on anybody else to try and make that word say something else yeah you react it's what I'm saying now and a man the all these guys that raise up say it won't be that and it won't be this it won't be that he said well what good is it for them to do that when his word is a seed well why would these Falls know any guys rise up after the parents of plant I mean after the Prophet planted the seeds and they rise up against them and saying they say you don't need the Holy Ghost like that and it's the more science than ones they don't do it no more like that he's why would they do that he said every word is a seed then these men's try to change then Jesus sent this seed a soul a soul so if st. Mark's 16 is God's Word it will bring forth of his kind in this age in this church amen enroll allegedly ha snake the Trinidad man praise God praise God Gouri hallelujah praise God amen every word is a sea of God is a see Jesus said so the source old so in st. mark 16 is God's Word it will bring forth of its kind is Malachi enforce God's Word it would bring forth of his kind and every other promise must bring forth of his kind you know what I'm saying where's acts 2:38 by the poem repent and be baptized and you what you shall you shall hallelujah that's there for eternity Reseda give her the Holy Ghost that will bring for them as kind in you ha praise God I felt fire on that brother that's a word see nobody can change it hey man you may be seated glory to God that's what God is planning was worded see us with His Church at the end it'd be the same thing praise God amen if st. mark 16 st. John 14:12 1420 it's regions for the 2nd Peter 1:4 through 8 Galatians 5:22 is God's Word then it's a sea then it'll bring forth after its kind we're in this church in you just as sure as Malik God's words see st. mark us a Malachi for st. Luke's 1730 revelation 10 1 through 7 that brought forth anther is kind will so will the rest of these seeds praise God at the Prophet penny for this pride in the last days hallelujah he applaud his spirit upon these seeds and you bring forth after your kind don't be discouraged and I be encouraged praise God cuz you're on the verge of the greatest outpouring of the Holy Spirit praise that at the world has seen since the days of the Apostles Oh hallelujah be encouraged to me praise God Oh glory in area the premise must come forth of his kind hallelujah every see at this cannot bring forth and then every see will come for that this kind may be seated and that's my inspiration today Malachi 4 reveal Haman that Joseph's perfection was the capstone word I've been over and over and over through 10 as the forth light upon door Luther was the first Wesley's second Pentecost of the third and Joseph was the fourth light upon the world therefore I conclude tonight on his last message here this ain't mess before I go take a rest therefore I conclude that Joseph's perfection caps don't worry is the seed the time that age the word then that be sold let the same God that said let there be light let that car tonight say let show the perfection see come forth after its kind hallelujah with the potentials in it to climb that pyramid tree you may be seated what kind of a seat is Joseph's perfection a perfect type of Christ then what will come forth a perfect type of Christ I laid this thing down for you praise God for 16 years hallelujah is going to be every seat at his own kind yes sir glory amen [Applause] spoke words original seed part 1 by M 3 page 44 yes siree are you with me amen are you in the word already now put it down in your mind now put down pull down the umbrellas and shake the rain off and open up your heart just a minute and listen remember the Bible said in Genesis the first chant that we read to base our thoughts for the day so that I is very is every see that this own kind of nail is down you it will have to bring forth after its kind that's right every see will have to bring remember the earth is full of seeds and that the rain makes it bring forth after its kind oh my god I tell you I wish you could have some faith and to bleed that amen but the Holy Ghost will break out all over the place in here but see condemnation breaks in there and that's what holds down the seed yes siree just get that thing off you praise be free for once in your life praise God no matter what your daughter did what your son or whatever forget about it praise God between you and God anyway say Mazel Mazel be free we coming here [Music] amen page 56 amen glory to God all right every seat must come forth at this kind God made a man in His image after his caring to be his word on earth he express it in Jesus Christ what was God was in Christ that's the man after his caring see when God which is a word I mean knows he's a word when the word was in Christ a man human man expressed himself through him that was God the word in Christ expressing himself and God in the beginning made man in his own image let us make man in our image and Elohim said to the logos let us make man our amateur theophany praise God male a female made he them man a woman is one they don't break that it's God's law race car don't break it let no man come between husband and wife no man no man no woman [Applause] no man got a judge that filthy thing like it wasn't beginning so inshallah being in hallelujah glory amen and gotta be gettin made man in his own image and that's the kind of man that God makes today a man the seminary in a cube act you know incubator of hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids see the schools but when God calls a man he's in his own image the word made him alive into him now when God calls you out of lay out of seer and put you up the end of rainbows as the kind he makes right on the chart call out of lay out of seer brotherly kindness and put in the rainbows as a stone that's the kind of man of God makes prayers cut right in front of you see it open your open eyes phrase cut yes sir Amen the word made alive in him that's right there is that's God's man man in his own image and it is very likeness and Jesus said that he'll do the works that I do so God made man in his own image after his kind now you're not going to get the dynamics first I felt them yes sir you're gonna get character hey man you receive the Holy Ghost sure at the bottom but don't look for those great signs and wonders American before you form character amen because the power without character is satanic you don't want to go back to Al and all of them again do you want your trunk it's in whoremongers praise God which signs wonders and miracles oh we don't want that that's why God brought this message here they won't hand that again every c2b after his own kind we have a bunch of Pentecostal miss prays cut have a Jesus man God man walking his feet in 20th century praise God talking like God walking like God praise God looking like not doing like God Amen hallelujah yes there is God's man maybe situ made his own image in his very likeness and Jesus said that he'll do the works that I do so God made man in his own image after his kind his kind what is his kind he is the word then if a man denies God word how can he be in God's image just ask the question yourself how can you be in God's image and deny God's Word see no way you see or when the words expresses is Express image of himself or you say it doesn't mean that express image of God he said yes in his own image it's page 57 of his kind to be his express word on earth now Jesus was God's Express word do you believe that then what are we to be sons of God to with Express Word in the church carrying on that's the mystical body of Christ carrying on the same work that Jesus did when he was here see that's the kind after his kind let shows a perfection see come forth after his kind

gonna fall brother a man who can be a church here I don't care what the unbelievers saying hallelujah I can rest now I know I can rest now because I got to Joseph the picture on the top of that platform there amen page five and he said the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain place that that the word is a seed and every see will bring forth of his caring now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God see we'll try to tell you when you hit that chosen profession what do you become the seed of God yeah I mean you come up through the mess you got a revelation that brother Brent said the fourth light the word and the word is a seed is Joseph's perfection and you have revelation if that's you then you become a seed the word for this age then when you become one then the water falls upon you praise God not only this whimpering and why is God doing this and why is God doing that and crying little babies oh my god forget about God ain't do nothing in your life until you become the word until you accept your temptation and your trial that you have tonight except every trial that you have tonight and then you own your way a man if I tell you if you lose one daughter and I come and tell you what to do with the second daughter you don't do that you lose the second daughter but you can change that tonight if you want to they already told you not to do that cuz I'm by discernment telling it to you but I ain't gonna tell you that I got discernment I'm just gonna speak to you but you shouldn't no I got it therefore you should trust me and if you don't trust me you don't get nothing nothing no it's kind of strong but what he said put the prophecy it anyway spoke a word original seat book - is it near he says you can only live by the way the Warriors interpreted to you by the man and got on there okay here we are and that the Christian the children of God - the children the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested Joseph's perfection see in the age that they are living in for the promised seed of that age God gave his word at the beginning and each age has had a seed as time his promises that's why they're preaching that's it for all these years oh my you get it I want to cut it off here I'm tired the word is the scene every scene will bring forth is Karen now the children of the kingdom to come the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they are living in for the promised seed of that age and Malachi 4 said Luther Wesley Pentecostals and Joseph perfection and Luther with justification and Wesley with sanctification Pentecostals the Holy Spirit in the gifts and Joseph affection is what the capstone word and we become the capstone which is chose the perfection the word we make up to capstone do you understand that the Lord Himself descended with a shout the Brinn and the Prophet laid it out all the mysteries say that's the word and you accept all of it you become what the word and there's nowhere else to go but the capstone and the word comes first then the Spirit comes behind it then I just read it Joseph eventually capstone word this is the age of total perfection and there's got to be a manifestation of the seed where it shows of affection and each age has had a seed as time is promises and God said RH Malachi 4 saint-lo 1730 revelation 10 st. John 14:12 then the brown age Oh Myka huh that right Omega restoration of the original Brad tree and the people of that age that manifests that promise word is the seed of the age so you don't have to go around showing off who you are and whatever you want to manifest it say nothing just flows out of you it flows like a river praise God I think I'm a baritone or something you don't mean my god hallelujah praise God yes am I getting your choir brother Paul amen praise God amen the seated age that every seat come for that his own kind they are the children of the kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost itself operating through his children is those seat of the king at age so it don't matter brother Lashley how many in Trinidad say they're in a message it's when the holy ghost itself pick some seeds in Trinidad and pull them out and begin a new signs and wonders and miracles through that is that children of the kingdom in Trinidad [Applause] in America in Canada in Africa South Africa world that's the seed of God not what they say praise God hallelujah so I never cared what they said praise God having a revelation at the end what was coming forth

and the life is in the seed and my God does the life of the Spirit coming into you connects and transforms that see up to the next step see how it's done but don't forget now charity will be here the skies in this church has virtue powerful service the same kind of virtue that went out of Jesus hallelujah that and then he reached for his coat and virtue flowed out that was the Holy Ghost that's the life example seed that would be in the church and they won't know what's going on they'll be climbing climbing climbing climbing climbing Jacob's Ladder hallelujah getting near that boycott

see that's the real see did it that real Holy Ghost them rainbows amen it really goes gets into the real see the word down in faith Oh hallelujah praise God it just won't take part of it see because the devil uses have oh the devil uses ninety nine and nine-tenths of this message you got to take the whole thing yes siree amen you've got to take it all see every word of because he's not half God he's all God and that's what takes place oh praise God we become town it'll transform you it's not a real seat born-again of the word then then if that real Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost itself guessing that a real seat born-again of the word it'll transform you be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind let your imagination be renewed your your conscious your reason your affection the whole your whole spirit renewed this change a man gone evil thoughts gone laurahenne see but must be a real seat in the right age in the right time amen that's and that's why I say let Joseph infectious seed come forth after its kind after his kind by the transforming power of the capstone of love thereby conforming ourselves to the image of Christ every CF his own kind with the potentials and a power in it to be what God wants it to be how do we conform ourselves to the image of Jesus Christ and where does the transforming power come from in these last days praise God question how will the bride be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ with all this darkness and unbelief and demon powers upon the earth in Malachi 4 says God will restore all things back by the same transforming power yes he will that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it a beautiful bride by God's transforming power we find out how it's done so on the Statue of a perfect man is that's how it's done right to praise God now in this last great step of Joseph's perfection must come into perfection and that holy sprit has to live in that church right there see so perfectly it'll make the head and the body unite together what will that produce again on God's provided the place of worship in California page 25 the church will come through justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the Pentecostals and gonna watch and go right on into the perfection of the Son of Man which I just recently preached on that when husband and wife will be the same self persons and God would be so manifested see into his bride his church till they will both be the same and that would be the seed of the age the children of the kingdom she will be married she will have on the wedding diamond let us be glad and rejoice we be called to the wedding supper hallelujah call to the resurrection she'll have on a rainbow coat hallelujah glory both be the same now see we're yet the promise that see where you ant amen see church is the word made fresh again now I made flesh when the word becomes flesh it becomes manifested I like take the word and put it in the right position the right kind of ground it'll bring forth the seat will bring forth after its kind and the word brought into the right kind of a heart it'll manifest itself it'll bring forth the light it'll break forth upon it and you bring it to the right ground see if Joseph perfection light don't break forth upon you praise God oh my God said let there be light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and when God sends the light is scattered as a darkness so God illah him spoke through Malachi 4 and said in and for our day let Joseph effects you see come forth after his kind yes so when that light breaks out here in this message Perez watch it all darkness scatter to the other side signs wonders and miracles Jesus in that prior to the children of the kingdom manifested for that age to see it at age in the message praise God how come against that praise God manifested and a manifestation of tools of affection will certainly scatter the darkness as light did in the beginning in Genesis once again after Malachi 4 planet of seats in the brown Oh hallelujah catch me now catch me Malachi 4 plan and his seeds in the bride and everything seems to be without form without seemed to be fine nothing is nothing praise God in darkness is upon the earth and gross darkness is

long ago he was trying to discuss to me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that God created the heavens and earth in six days I said that's what the Bible said he said well we got evidence can prove that the world is millions of years old I said that didn't have nothing to do with it in Genesis 1:1 it said in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth period now the world was without form

everything come up hallelujah the mists rolled away hallelujah right now this misty all over you and chaos and void without form and praise God the same voice of the Archangel it's gonna speak and the Misses gonna roll the way in hallelujah oh god don't come to trees everything else then the same you may be seated the same thing with the human being it's a time when all the misses moved away and reveal truth to that real seed laying there still German tears and the light of the gospel can strike it but you a vindication of the word it'll live it's got life in it outside of that it can't live it's got no life in it them names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world will come forth yes as certain as anything that's why Jesus sits right there and waits with his mediatorial work until that last seed he'll know exactly when the strike he knows in here when the strength you may be on your knees praise God and feel nothing around you but your praying Lord I

the Holy Ghost comes upon you and a true baptism of the Holy Ghost all these virtues sealing you then God lives in the tap and I could call a billon living Tabernacle of living in God's dwelling place amen praise God when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him did you get it when a man has faith in an and in virtue and knowledge and tempers and patience and gods brother kind then he says here then the Holy Ghost which is between the capstone and brotherly kindness then the Holy Ghost comes upon him hallelujah did you get it oh yeah a lot of tiring to do huh all the little weeping over nothing around here praise God Jean you and God no matter you might speak with tongues you might have personally ain't get that God's God you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real troop a foundation of faith and when these virtues grow in and you've added that to that then you are living monument there's a monument pray there's a masterpiece that set on top tier three and Joseph is the top of the foundation and put the monument right on top of the top of the foundation hallelujah um masterpiece praise God you can't break it

releases the Living God in the church the Holy Ghost itself you get it then you can you have power to add these things they have powered a little how to overcome who yourself [Music] the IAEA is good not in management prostrate yourself before living gotta live in virtue of living knowledge living or live in patience of living God is a living power coming by the Living God Holy Ghost itself makes a living man a living image the Statue of God the SMC conform to Express image of Jesus Christ Saint no fantasy this is your promise for today get up out of there print it's your promise aim glory to God hallelujah that's a statue of God you may be seated what's he doing the same thing that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing and no hope and soul this reality proves it see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials typed in with the church messenger with the church ages now one of these days we want to take each one of these words and study them out and show that it proves this it all goes together see he never he didn't live past a time to do that but maybe some of these man can pick these things up and make more sense to it amen praise God ensure it approves it it all goes together see sure how wonderful that is to sit to to see what it does now that is the house that God dwells in not with a big Bell on top of it and a high steeple but our body has now prepared to present your body a living sacrifice which is only your reasonable service you ain't doing no big deal you ain't doing no big deal coming in here because you didn't fornicate or something that you did a smoke and drink what big deal are you doing praise God amen ain't no big deal because you live in after all I'm doing awful are you doing nothing for the Lord praise God God called you in here praise God what are you doing for him he is doing it in you you been thanked guy he letting you uh uh uh you using it he is using your body to do his work we doing nothing but surrendering amen we no big shots oh body as I prepared me a party that God can't well him God can walk him God can see in God can talk him God can work in amen live an instrumentality of God God walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteousness audit of the Lord God walking in you for your written epistles read of all man and if the light that's in Christ being you you will bear the life that Christ bore praise God thank you Jesus [Applause] man praise God aim there's a perfect man of God musicians when he possesses these things now remember Jesus purpose in descending in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is shalt voice and Trump to set himself at the head of the church number 2 that's how he does it that's no more put at the head of the church and then put all these things into you transform you into a perfect man number 2 what for then he will resurrect his own church being his own body and that's the purpose Hebrews 11 39 we pick it up on page 53 and these heaven all these all having obtained a good report through faith here good report all the ones in Hebrews they're receiving not to promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect Amen see now you get it these people who died in here or depending and waiting on us so this church age has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection do you understand what you live in here for not just existing but you live there for purpose to be a perfect man on this earth to bring that resurrection up pray that's what you're here for don't let nothing deter you nothing stop you praise Scott amen to bring resurrection they under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection but when Christ does come in this church you see it's coming small in the minority is a whole lot sharper than that but just like a right that cross DC is coming up to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into a place can't you see that the capstone cannot set even on brotherly carry news you see it there because it be something left on the end so he had to take it up a little bit further and drop the whole to go sent near seven rainbows to make a perfect fit it won't set on Wesley it's too wide do you see him it would only set on them rainbows it won't even set on brotherly kindness Laodicea what he wants it on everything for put your church in the blind wretched miserable poor ain't sittin on there he's pulling out a capstone brah yes sir Gloria you may be seated you see it but when Christ does come in this church you see it coming small of the minority it's coming to a needle point until the church a minority has got to get to a place until it's the same kind of a ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back it's got a pocket here where it's gonna sit right in there or like on a regular pyramid it just isn't a camp that sits across the top there's a little fringe it's got to sit on there because it sheds the waters and when it comes this church has got to be home and there's your holding I'm seven rainbows as home right in there then thunders is gonna home you in there praise God and brother Andrew picked that up when I was saying home home home and he he's a machinist and he wrote this here he says reference to the honing out of the Bryant home honing is a very important facet of the metalworking industry a specific procedure used for a specific purpose honing is the final phase of creating an internal diameter when both size and finished quality are of utmost importance the first phase is drilling the hole removing the bulk of material quickly whereas fire go write it down into your soul getting all that loose junk out of there Prince guy quickly pray it's got baptized with fire yes get all the filth and chunk out of there aiming it right in the hole amen and removing only a tiny amount of material and achieving a very good finish and accuracy of size on the average circumstances these two phases are good enough for commercial work sometimes a supreme finish and tight tolerances are required this is when honing is performed special stones mounted on an arbor are spun inside and the bore in the presence of special oils amen removing minut amounts of material the oil flushes out the specs the material and cleanses the pores of the stones Oh hallelujah send the oil or send the honing my god what a morning huh glory Mara finishes you can look like an indented Emeritus word mirror finishes and sizes within the millionth of an inch can be obtained yes sir now he said something about that on yes he did here over on adoption yes sir page 104 believe it was yes siree now he's speaking about the manifestation waiting for the time growing for the town and manifestation well before the tongue never made before the hold of those have a porn out before all old testement on down there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait to this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to a manifestation of the sons of God coming back in the Spirit of God coming into these man so perfectly a million a--the amen until the ministry would be so close like Christ till it was joining him in his church together and there's the Rainbows is his ministry and then that unites with him the understand finally the ministry of christ identified on the earth to unite with the headstone that's what joins together you can't join with brotherly kindness as a joint with the Rainbows amen page 106 Amy you know the pair of never was kept was it never had a capsule put on it they never couldn't even find it they don't know whatever happened to it why why wasn't the capsule put on the headstone the top of it because it was rejected when he come he wasn't rejected stone that's right but what but it but but it will be cam that's right and then those stones listen that fit around that headstone will have to be stones that'll be so completely like that stone you got to be home Oh huh that fit around let's pull out of brotherly kindness and fitted fit it's toned and Ephesians fit it perfectly right into the headstone well Jim you may be the last one to be fitted right in there praise God you came back for purpose brother yes God don't make no mistakes and then when you wanna sing for me soon praise God glory hey man brother Jimmy is a singer brother yes sir amen oh the singing Griffin Boyce amen yes siree Amen here 20 stones and there and then those stones that fit around that headstone would have to be stones that be so complete like that stone it'll fit in joint everywhere the pyramid is so perfect you can't run a razor blade between them where them stones go together such beautiful masonry some of them would weigh hundreds of tons up in the air and so perfectly set together and keep matching the bride in here so full of love we just write together and can't nobody can break us the devil can't fall upon you say brother Coleman did this and brother song so did that said Jones did this here know right together you fit it right to like this here Oh hallelujah no more gossip no more filth you're more fornication no more touching no more nothing praise God hallelujah oh I'm making it right on the right on the button here I want to get out under here about two hours and finishes off page 107 now noticed in the coming of the Lord now wasn't coming to Lord 1 Thessalonians 4:16 right become a Lord Jesus is so close to at hand until this no don't try to get all this now because I'm bringing his back just receive I mean your head is waterlogged trying to hold his head Amen see it's so close by I got it put it on the tape hey man I see and at the hand until the spirit from way down in here just barely justification sanctification Baptist the Holy Spirit and now see right into the time of the coming of the headstone they are again the church has got to be so perfectly perfectly like Christ until Christ in the in how the world could you know what Christ is like that's the prophet brought the word to tell you what his life you couldn't know from Pentecost yea I say unto thee this sister here she has a lot of money to put in the church and she's like Jesus Christ praise God what kind of nonsense is that

a little barrel with a little bit of meal in it and all cruise for a little bit all and then I heard the voice of the Prophet the Thunder other voices the Prophet thus sayeth the Lord and do you know what church here tonight I told me yesterday I'm still eating meal from the barrel I'm still getting oil from the cruise because I heard hallelujah in the same car that 1/4 Malachi 4 will bring forth Joseph's perfection by the transforming power of the love of God and you will be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ eat and you pee after that carrying that walk to earth or any praise God god be praised hallelujah praise his wonderful name Laurie since you're standing stand up for a while praise God I'm finished the church is good not to be so perfect like crisis took crisis of the church key unite together the same spirit and there is the same spirit not a breath but the Holy Ghost itself the same spirit and the Spirit of Christ in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the life of Christ do the works of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also jesus said that now we going to have we got a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of Christ there it is you see it as Marisa coming it's just exactly like the life of Christ what does that ministry identify the coming of the Lord well if Malachi 4 identified the shell what will you identify in the coming of the Lord you're going to jump ahead and identify the Trump or you stay in your position where you belong where the points of the Archangels end well praise God I guess a few caught that one well too many amen praise God and when this when it comes that this church has got to be honed and these an arrestee stone wounds in the pyramid are laying so perfect and you can't run a race between them nothing in between them nothing come between you and I had no more in the word agency because we know what to do from Hebrews and so forth that was still spirits that doesn't get in between us all the Tatler's and busybodies and the sisters who call another sisters did a call in the ministry busted praise God that second centers Falls a call the minute no sister you call them in say I'm not a minister praise God see but fresh life should be glorified sometime oh yes I understand the men are hard yeah I know what they put you down all that kind of stuff for you mm-hmm praise God yes sir hallelujah know Jesus said I'm supposed to be your ruler it's what God said anyway amen hallelujah well how'd it get there huh my my my my it's got to sit down because it shares the walls and when it comes the church got to be home and the rest of you stole that's right okay and how they got him up there I don't know but they were built and up here when the pyramid does camp does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed see again not only just some Creed doctrine how could brother Andrew bring it in here now saying I'm finished so perfectly like Christ when he comes he in that ministry see there is again will fit right smack together then will come the rapture in the going home Oh friends were here give us a key for I love him I love him do you love him

Brian tree praise God will the bride identify the voice of the Archangel and that's one destined for sixteen to come to the Lord I don't know just a question but I'll say to you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is a good acceptable perfect will of God the statue of a perfect man is the only thing that God will accept in this rapture own so we are transformed changed by the transforming power the capsule of love thereby conforming ourselves to be the Express image of Jesus Christ remember how it's done 2nd Peter 1:4 through 8 the statue of a perfect man page 65 hits a last port add to your faith virtue add to
