TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] God bless your church greetings to New York and Pa and all our all our friends that are tuned in uh I greet you this morning uh let's us bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Lord we thank you Lord to be alive this morning and to have activity in our limbs Lord and a promise in our heart Lord that we are going out of here father we thank you for all the mighty Revelations that you have poured out and may you uh bless the reading of the word bless it back to the to the believer's hearts and bless all our friends that are tuned in now may strengthen my body to say a few words to the people for this last service before the the great uh convention we pray almighty God and ask the blessing in Jesus name his sake amen would you open your Bibles to uh I'll just read it quickly because it's only one scripture uh Genesis 18:14 is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son may God add a bless in the reading of his word you may be seated Well church uh I want to quickly speak to you this has been a very trying uh uh week from more than a week actually and I was expecting to be healed or looking to be healed and if it's God's Will and then uh I thought maybe I would uh climax all that has been going on since April the 4th or really uh March 21st when we started playing the tapes but but uh doesn't seem to be God's will and I had mind battles all week to know what to do and how to do it and so forth but anyway uh God is good so I just I just have to stay with it and uh so this is the last service before pen Harris and I just pray that um everybody here would be prepared and to uh a group will come out of this barley Revelation and be ready to be wheat in the hot July sun in July so and we know that March April May June uh because of life from the promises of the original uh early bride has come back to us in the form of Revelation from the from the elm series and as you know as I read to you before because the wheat life I before how a wheat comes up in the fall a stand comes up and um then it stands there all through the winter it lays it is dormant nothing can happen that's why because the farmer does not go out and look at the wheat field in the winter time neither does he do it in the springtime he doesn't do it than either but then in the spring comes the latter rain and the cat rain doctrines coming back to you as rain uh where was thou job and who God is and who you are and who Satan is That's All Out of Rain and the latter of rain is supposed to come into the wheat in March April May June and they call it the food value and all of it should be in by June and then the wheat is uh matured she's ready but uh she's now ready of 1 Corinthians 26 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect amen meaning mature no more babies amen and all of the uh promises are in in the bride and then the wheat is still moist and um it's still moist and as we know um July is the time for the hot sun of July and um also we understand about about February 28th when the seven angels come and then as they faded away it turned into into Christ and made the head hman head of Christ and then it stayed after the prophet 7even SE 7 Thunder message uh the cloud stayed sunlit for 28 uh minutes after so we understand what that is that's the Dynamics to your mechanics so I ask a question could that sunlit could that be also the hot July Sun ask your question so if it is then it'll be elim returning in power in the time of life life as as Dynamics to the mechanics so brother Norman you can put this down so I do want to greet everyone uh down in Puerto Rico and Fort Wayne and all around in our church here massachusett Upstate New York and all around so today's tape uh is from December 6 1981 to know him from the beginning now um on page seven I don't know how even doing what I'm doing now I just had a chance to put a few notes down page 7 1 2 3 uh fourth paragraph and so to know him from the beginning September 12 1981 the Lord spoke to my heart the following three messages I had no context in the beginning was the word but from the beginning was not so he told me that he told me that that one would be for the church and so it was for the church and then to know him from the beginning and he told me that this one would identify the adoption season so today we want to get in the last bit of food value for June amen now you know um the three phases that the lord gave me in May 1974 and he identified the second fa a part of it which was Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and he identified that in 74 in June down in Georgia also then the other second part he identified it in September through November uh with the revelation of the seven thund Revelation and that was the Holy decency which is the blood amen and the Holy Spirit followed the blood named word see in every age to make sure it come forth the same holy spirit is going to follow the blood today the seventh Thunder blood which is your name which is your life you're going to follow that and that's what the third phase is all about amen so amen yes so you may be seated so the third phase is place in Christ adoption time Joseph Perfection now brotherly love that was a working of the Holy Spirit holy Dey has been a working of the Holy Spirit and this is the 30th year year now notice the three phases and I in 1992 I believe yeah uh May 6 uh he spoke to me again and told me that my third phase would automatically when we hit it the third phase it automatically hook Connect into the prophet's thirdd pull the opening of the word the mystery is revealed amen so these first two Revelations working of the Holy Spirit on the third phase it will prove whether this is of God or not because it'll Connect into the prophet's third pole which is plac in Christ and and because the Vindication will be there now remember when something is revealed is Al is already is also Vindicated and you find that quote on Fourth seal so brother brandom he revealed the Seven Seals the mystery there and what was under the seventh seal uh three phases there and seven Thunders banging close together there but it wasn't time cuz it was connected to the coming of the Lord so therefore then he went out with seven uh seals revealed and that was his vindication so therefore when the word is revealed that is the Vindication well if the seven thund is revealed that's the Vindication if Elohim is revealed that's the Vindication so I feel that we have to come back to brotherly kind may be seated brotherly kind and forgiveness to understand our requirement for the age then we can pick up pastri for in the fourth seal and brother bramma world falling AP sh Port he said just as every age met their requirement am Faith virtue knowledge and so forth Temperance patience so will this age hit their requirement we going to hit it amen so may be seated so I feel that we have to come back to brotherly kindness forgiveness and that's why the Holy Spirit left AE I should say uh and of someh have compassion and forgiveness in 1974 and we didn't pick it up until last year brother Norman found it it was hid in a box of South African tapes so the Lord HD it back for this season cuz we have to pick it up you got it now so now so to understand our requirement for the age then we can pick up page 304 fourth seal wait till the seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can hand the word there notice then the quote goes in to the third phase because third phase adoption time SP spoken word bride quote it'll slice when you can hand the word Elohim and so forth am it'll slice and cut they can close the heavens they can do this or do whatever they want to so therefore that is the third pull friends so but we need a revelation of Brotherly kindness and forgiveness and able to hook in and for them Thunders to because their voices to you and then you're going to be in a Revival so I like to take you I'd like to take you down to Georgia again we did it I think Wednesday but everybody wasn't here so I want the whole church to know what this is all about so there be no excuses so brother Norman would you take us down to Georgia and they can hear the excerpts again brother Norman see and you'll see the Sheep of God come screaming forth praising to God men down on those intellectual powers and whatnot their interpretations manmade ideas when the real David takes a stone of that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ when that David stands out with that confession of what the seven seal is when did that happen here is when God come down from heaven and thundered out the revelation [Applause] down in Georgia holy spirit is playing back for you this morning every promise belongs to the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight for Jesus died for every blood redeemed promise and is for you the Bride of Jesus Christ therefore we have a charge minister to preach the word in season out of season oh what a charge to preach the word praise God I believe this is the season when the people will stop running from the word and they'll fall upon the sword and you put it in with love speak the truth in love not speak loveely the truth hallelujah just speak the truth in love amen praise the Lord you know the Ten Commandments the first four is our attitude toward God and the next six is our attitude toward our neighbor amen amen if you love your neighbor you will tell your neighbor about God first amen and as a me if I love my neighbor that's you I'll tell you that God don't want no Idols before him amen because I love you I speak the truth about him first but I speak it in love for you so you know that amen praise God so now we are exalting one another to good works and provoking unto love and I'm here to exalt you praise God the people to enjoy their Blood Washed redeemed rights unto love and unity of the faith but now watch here there are many weak ones and those who don't understand God's Will and so therefore there's a scripture here and of some have compassion oh what a revelation brother there are weak ones there ignorant ones who don't don't have the same Revelation that you have and here is now we in the word now back to the word every word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth for from the mouth of God therefore I'm not interested in what that brother believes do he believe in Malachi 4 that's the the beginning there does he believe that well it may be all uh this way and that way that's all right see uh Temperance amen Longs suffering long suffering stretch your way out amen praise God see and I'm persuaded God able to take care of his own now see therefore the I feel that there's coming forth a true Revelation on brotherly kindness that'll just sweep sweep over us something will happen to us brother Brown said on the throne of mercy and judgment oh what jville Indiana needs tonight what the world needs tonight is thousands of lived voices did you hear what I said a live voice then the voice of God come down through Malachi for as a shout and we were we just supposed to walk around Jericho as it was he and he said when I B you to shout shout yes maybe tonight we can begin to shout amen the Holy Spirit anoint our miles to shout the real message out not from interpretation but what he saiding shout it out but it takes a live voice first you must live the word first and and and and and and oh my and the devil's getting matter and matter as you am and when you hit that brotherly kindness oh brother I see him going out the door tonight he said don't let them add that please Philistines please demons don't let them add brotherly kinds for we are gone we are finished if they ever get the Revelation to forgive their brothers we are [Applause] finished [Applause] PR oh they they getting close they getting tools they lay word word word word they going to find the secret is lay in forgiveness that's a condition that men sins are forgiven on forgiveness of man praise God When you stand friend before you can receive the spoken word promises forgive you brother oh my if you don't forgive him if you have an art you got agree if you right he come to you you forgive him otherwise your heavenly father cannot forgive you in the bright age in the word age and the devil want to keep that away from you now so you w't that because nobody preach that now screw all around it but I feel maybe tonight the secret is out you talking about healing the faith bank will sweep all over this place here it'll blow off the camp up there amen praise God what a revelation and of some have compassion but you don't understand brother he did the terriblest thing to me talked about me in a dirty way told lies on me and of some have compassion but you understand I mean he uh did this he did that shi kicked dirt on David should I cut that dog's head off let him alone God has B him to do it amen what about David he had fall de right twice down there had his sword the word upon could have chopped him in peace he was God's anointed but here was another man that was God's anointed also he didn't have the same Revelation therefore David had him brother what a Pentecostal bait I got a witness to chop your head off devil but David had compassion touch not God's anointed do his propit no praise God oh I feel good tonight amen praise the Lord wow I'm persuaded that God has sent forth that Revelation like a thunder there was Thunder all down through brother then it'll take a live voice that's the Thunder that shakes the devil can you imagine brothers seven thunders in the bride living the word [Applause] it long on your minds now praise the Lord amen it s down I knew nothing about it I don't remember even saying those words didn't even hear the tape again like that until January I heard it going up to Canada and just heard it just to hear it but I never knew it and then he revealed it to me on September the 20th and said the seven THS of the seven voices of the seven Church agents still didn't hear it again yet until I was getting ready to go go to buman here to take when I heard he says now you shouldn't be afraid to go to buman you already preached [Music] it praise God you talk about a faith going down to bont brother I knew exactly where I was standing had already preached it God so I'm trying to explain to you now do you understand what I'm trying to say it'll be so humble and simple you'll be trying to figure out like a great anointing say the Lord all it'll be walking right by you it'll be the word the same word through Malachi 4 walk through us for 3 years if you don't have the token there to examine it it pass through you won't know it and so will it pass right through us again we'll be gone out of here shortly it's the word revealed to whomsoever he will greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world how do you think I feel this morning knowing that God revealed like a thunder and there it was right there and you talk about healings the healings is ready they're here now they had to come so why you saw sister a all them things happening they have got to follow the thunder it's the same life back on the Earth again is here greater is he that is in you and he is in the world brother we here what a revelation oh my yes sir I'm persuaded God has sent forth that Revelation like a thunder my just thund all down throughs has been happening to us ever since well church he [Applause] are do you understand it did you catch what it said forgiveness first then revelation of seven Thunders amen I'll say it again forgiveness brotherly kindness first other words brotherly kindness and forgiveness is the seventh age requirement God will give you nothing unless you hit that requirement are you getting it now so you can shout you can do anything you want to do but you don't get nothing amen until you live that word first okay so through forgiveness and of someh have compassion you will enter into page 304 wait to the seven funds UT their voices to that group who can hand the word there well you handing the word you you able to hand handle uh brotherly kindness and forgiveness okay so it takes a little voice first and the word and we back to the word now see and then uh because because brother brotherly kindness opens the door to charity amen see but you must live the word first so before you ever be adopted by charity you got to live Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godly brotherly kindness so you can't get around it and it's Ellen with the seven spirits kind of slow there hey you're kind of dull I'm going to tell you flat out you are dull period after all this Revelation and you sit there numb I guess that's why I'm sick you may be seated my God you must live the word first add add add add okay um now you know how to bind the devil cuz the Elohim Revelation has exposed that religious spirit that religious spirit would tell you look what they did to you and I ain't going to do nothing after all they got to repent there's a religious spirit yeah but now you know better don't [Applause] you so you got to do what what they did to you what the sister did to you what the brother did to you what do you do you for you may be seated you forgive him you forgive her otherwise your heavenly father cannot forgive you in the bride word [Music] age you'll never hear [Applause] thunder so we come to the junction of time the seventh Junction so the third phase adoption uh time brotherly Joseph Perfection a bride age and uh is here and so now you know how to bind Satan and CU he gets in here with his demons and get everybody hateful and everything don't want to forgive but you know what to do now so what does that do that takes a death to know that you are right and the person's wrong and you forgive them anyway that's a death amen well when you begin to do that then you understand what God wanted you to do uh after job 38-4 too he want you to come down not now catch this here cuz you as a group you haven't really caught it yet job 38-42 I hate myself and repent in dust and Ashes what is that that's a abhorrence of good self not bad self because you're supposed to be a Christian you're not even supposed to have bad self so what self are we talking about talking about you you may be seated so friends you got to come to the realization that we are nothing and the elim inspiration 1981 82 tapes to let you know who God is and you nothing beside God we are to know who we are and to know who Satan is he's given us the secret Revelation how to get our good self out of the way brother come I still don't get that yet yeah I know you don't CU you think I'm talking about the bad self and I'm not I'm talking about you I'm talking about you who pay times you who shout you who worship I'm talking about you Minister you Deacon Usher Elder song leader sound man musician I'm talking about you I'm talking about you that don't bother nobody don't even spit on the sidewalk I'm talking to you I'm not talking about fornication I'm not talking talking about adultery I'm not talking about smoking drinking smoking pot I'm not talking about that that is not even a Christian but I'm talking about you good Christians you have to die now maybe you're getting a revelation of what I'm talking about you may be seated did you get that talking about ministers elders deacons everybody pay your ti offerings do all kind of good deeds and I'm talking to [Applause] you you know um like Daniel his good self his comeliness Daniel when he met the Lord it was corruption are you understanding this and all that you do good is corruption that's what I'm talking about you're [Applause] nothing now we're talking about the third phase aren't we you can't go in there with good self you may be seated so you will say sure my bad self needs to be put away I don't smoke and drink and all like that I don't do that fornicating adultery no ungodliness no but if I'm doing that I'll get rid of him no no no no you get rid of good self that's what you're going to get rid of so God is trying to kill good self that we might die out and when we do then God can pour in the fire baptism God is a consuming fire and he's going to burn out good self Paul said it's not I who live but Christ in [Music] me we are not God is not interested in you parading around with good self I is Holy I pay my ti forget it we're not talking about that we

nothing left of us it will be Christ in US bride fully manifested then you will come from a young man to the father's on the third hallelujah oh I'm beginning to feel good now Glory Hallelujah Glory I finally feel like something's getting in there hey and then you you be able to go to the fathers you may be seated for adoption time to know him from the beginning may be seated so true brotherly kindness forgiveness and then kill good self then you'll be getting into bride material then you begin to add to your faith and so forth amen if you do these things then surely Elohim will return in power unto you in the time of life in [Applause] [Music] July you hear what I said as as Dynamics to your mechanics so now um that seventh seal we know is the Seal of life and our Masterpiece I'm just going to watch my to I don't want to take up too much time here are you understand what I'm talking about here now okay Masterpiece 1964 page 27 notice hear the life that was in the star tsel all now ends up in the seed the life came right through and went into seed the life and that life is being put into you March April May June by a promise and that's what I'm doing this morning the life that come out of the Original Seed day of Pentecost that got to come back B and that's what what we've been doing with these promises here and uh the Original Seed come up through different processes three different processes now watch the prophet here and then turns back till its original condition hallelujah it's the prophet oh my I am the happiest person in the world that God would let me see this this was a thunder this was a hidden Mystery and that's what's being given to you not to a church member the prophet is thanking God that God let him see that Revelation may be seated how Paul arenus Martin Columbo they had the seed and they were coming on to adoption amen the seed with kept falling in the ground falling in the ground and finally went in the ground with uh Rome and with gther and came up a tsel I mean a blade benas Wesley of course shuck Pentecost and the life went right through there you see so you know I tell you a little story may this might strike you talking to a couple of ministers and so we having lunch no we having breakfast and I said well brother I said the seed is green and the shuck is green I said and you know this I said the poor seed don't know no better is all because it's dormant in the winter and ain't nothing happening so and everybody thinks they are in the message so the shuck is just appear nasty and mean and evil and then the then the seed didn't know no better amen so therefore they would be the same way they would retaliate back back in the message I'm talking about so then I told a brother I said well brother I says uh I explained this to him I said but one day that uh Green Seed is going to turn golden brown and that green shook the greenness is the life that was in it and one day all around 2001 2 3 4 that that green life will leave that Shu all right and about that time brotherly kindness and death the good self will strike amen praise [Applause] God she may be seated so the brother says uh brother Joe I have an appointment at 1:00 p.m. God bless you he he was gone so I ran him away on purpose I wanted to enjoy my breakfast amen okay so the prophet so happy that God let him see this I wonder if you happy too okay notice the line that was in the husk in the stalk in the tsel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the St one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of Holy Ghost Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost those who have it now uh made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection and back to the word again amen yeah to manifest itself you got it now so that's where we are so then he speaks about it'll Stand Alone the bridegroom rejected of men despised rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his Masterpiece see it's the word that he can work through make manifest rejected it'll always be rejected so that the uh tsel and husk never become SE no but are all the time becoming more like the seed now at the Harvest time now the seed is back to his original life back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought that way now you understand why I said back to the Bible back to the word now here's why must uh must have all to be this way it must have all of the word and we had to get the original Life coming being packed in here through the Revelation Elohim in order to be mature amen now now what did he say in Revelation 10 that would take place why was the trip to Tucson to open to the church and the days of the messenger of the 7eventh Angel the seventh angel message the whole world the the whole word of God would be he made manifest now watch the seal which is the seventh that what all the stalk has left off and why and all about it would be made manifest in this time see what the message is now what they left off and why they left it off hallu and uh in this time is that what the word said then we see it then where are we at see where are we at there's only one thing to Harvest is here she's dead right she's ready now for the coming notice that never at the Harvest Time here we are right now as we getting ready to go down here to pen Harris in July the Harvest Time at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all of the word in order to be the seed and that's what's going on now all of the words being packed into you in order for you to be deceived you may be seated now you cannot have half of seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed now watch it's got to not manifest and say I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking in tongues and I'll just add this I believe in seven Thunders Hallelujah uh-uh the whole word that's that's just part of the seed but now there's added to that now watch to that Hallelujah the life not the gifts the life of the gifts see what I mean we at the end time Brethren there you are we talking about life Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness Galatians 5 life forgiveness blly kindness worship praise God [Music] life not some dead church member sitting there clapping their hands and won't say nothing you've been created to worship God Amen page 33 may be seated the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in St Luke 17 Malachi 4 see right and then uh he said also on that page he says uh the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second last is the same I was in Alpha he said I was in Alpha then he said I I am in Omega he's in Omega now right now he's hearing the word and when he can move through here and get some people to catch belly kindness and forgiveness and then you'll see him manifested there'll be a day won't be cold day and night but evening time it shall be late Alpha and Omega is become the first and the last oh my we can spend hours on that well church I just I want to cut off here I'm very tired I'm just trying to get this over to you if anything got home to you I hope something did amen praise God because you cannot get anything unless you hit that requirement that's that's my burden this morning okay uh spok Original Seed book one page 48 brother R speaking about because the elected one and the word stand with the elected one Abraham and kind of work did he do and then he's speaking about how Abraham his name was Abraham not Abram and then he speaks there but I'm trying to get here to save time said where the angel said where is Sarah not Sarai Sarah where is thy wife Sarah like he didn't know said she's in the tent behind you he said I'm going to to visit you I personal pronoun I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you're going to have that baby that you waited on the ladder rain is fixing to fall so he tied the L rain into the s in the tent you got it now watch you have hold hold that seed in there long enough now on believing and you held it long enough On Believing now it's got to be manifested and you're looking for a coming son and he's coming that's the real church today the elected seed you've been looking for him and I'm going to send him to you who said that the word may be seated well let me let me get to this Harvest here I think I'll cut it off there there's a man I can turn on the light uh page uh 29 paragraph 151 he speaking about the son and how the same son get stronger and strong what you know uh the Sun comes today gets a little stronger each day now it'll get a little stronger as from you know from January to February to March and a little strong until finally the wheat that's laying there it'll go to taking life after a while the it been through the winter there nothing all around March it'll go to taking life in in March 21st this is my beloved Son who well pleas to dwell you start taking life amen and to go to taking life the life will come up then a little stronger a little stronger March April May June July she's in the [Applause] Harvest you see the same sun shining today in January December that's up there bathing that snow and melted down on that grain bringing it water it's the same Sun but what uh but that wheat could not live in that same sunlight in June can't do it the Sun comes a little stronger each day and the green should be a little more matured to receive the sunlight in other words after March April May and June the grain should be a little more matured to receive the sunlight of the hot sunlight of July so um Cod uh seven Church AG uh page 965 paragraph 204 like the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it I caught it right there it's on the tape I'll probably hear from it when I was talking about the seven trumpets I said there was seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal Feast from the Pentecostal Feast until the until the trumpets there was seventh Sabbath so don't try to understand this here seventh Sabbath was between the Feast of pass over to Pentecost you see which made the 50 days but I was referring to being that I said that means the seven Church ages now did you understand that I don't think so just listen to what he's saying here so now brother Bram is correcting this cuz he cuz he said something here but he applied it over there you see on that tape if you haven't if you happen to get it or or anything on that tapable it should be that the seventh month after that brought in the Feast of the trumpets which meant the seven Church ages seven months not seven sabbaths seven uh I did explain it on there I said there seven sabbaths like that but then I carried that same thought on over when it's the seventh month after the Feast of the Passover or after the Feast of Pentecost then come the feast after the sheath was brought in Wade you see remember there now the sheath turns into a loaf of bread after that time one sheath then all goes into one loaf it's a old it's a great teaching there I didn't touch the edge of it now watch but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's 7 months after that count off seven months January February March April May June July it would be July 7even months which represents the the full seven Church ages some Minister might pick that up and then you would have it do you have it are you looking for July looking for pen Harris are you ready to shout well praise God Amen so now do you understand what I've been saying may be seated more other words the winter nothing since 1966 nothing winter why would the farmer come out 1966 through uh 2000 there's nothing near cold winter brother Bram said it Christ reveal his own word you have a dreadful time to go through dismal that's right it's the winter and the seed is in the ground but come March April May June July Elohim you got it now so the same God that put you in March April May and June to put the food value into you that same God will put you into ju line and put the hot sun there [Music] amen so you may be seated so therefore the farmer does not go out even in March April man June he he still don't go out and I was down there I was blessed to be at your brother Tommy dillan's house 1970 and I saw actual Harvest and I watched him around July 1st he came out he began to go here then he went over there over there just plucking you see looking for a ripe seed so I was fascinated I watch them every day I didn't move from there I had to see that so then finally around June 6 July 6 or 7 he came out oh he went over there he went over there quickly he s for the Reapers amen yes sir so I saw that and I asked brother Bill Keifer he's passed on I said brother Bill why did they start at 2:00 p.m. and they would finish at 12:00 at night why they have to D like that finished he said because down in there is false anointed is weeds and when the hot July Sun hits it with signs and wonders those weeds to shoot right up thus sayeth the Lord ah but got to have something ready for them Michael will be here Christ amen okay you got it now you understand now you may be seated and he told me I said well how come some the fields are weak he says well he says uh and some are strong he says uh it you know he said because the uh strong wheat feels he says well the word is preached in there and it keeps those weeds out of [Music] there oh you're so mean no I'm keeping the weed out of here I ain't mean but you got a revelation now that I'm not mean cuz you didn't know what was even going on but now you have to get rid of your own demons I ain't got no more time to do that I have to preach to the [Applause] bride I a got no time to take care of your demons you pull your sword out and you go after your own personal Philistines you go in your own closet you go in your own basement I'm not going down there you do it when a sister call you on the phone starts gossiping you tell her shut up not me [Applause] you ahuh that's your own demons well praise God well amen praise God well friends uh you understand something today okay well now God's provided a place of worship Luther Wesley Pentecost may be seated they had the Dynamics and mechanics together for their day and brother Brown said what about our day the church should be prayed up ready to go out to meet God with every blessing for the bride in her and then he said page 25 he said here the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and grow right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we at amen now who's going to do this friends well here's where we at uh 1 Thessalonians 4:16 of course you know what it is Jesus does all three that was the thunder on that Rapture tape so the shout of course was Elohim because revealing the word taking us back to the word and all the Hidden Mysteries and now we're at the voice of the Archangel last night's tape uh charity I put it there because charity is is Michael the voice of the Archangel charity is Christ so Christ reveal his own word here's your promise page 19 and 20 see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then they come up through the feet Luther come back through Wesley Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth do you understand it now prophetic eyes Malachi 4 shout first phase of the three-fold uh uh seventh seal you got it now he bringing the message the shout of the king that's I is prophetic and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself it's BEC coming to a place and he's governing the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that will take out of his side like Adam did at the beginning and there we are now you understand that now Malachi for was the eye time there's nothing left but the intelligence and that's the middle part okay God stretched his tent Jesus Christ to the [Music] [Applause] Earth okay page 39 here is it is is in here twice and this is a thunder here cuz nobody knew this amen uh you it's a hidden Mystery you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see what the ears yet it can hear you can't see what the nose it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks that was the Pentecost age but now is in the eye time the sin Malachi 4 now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye is that right the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself here we are who controls the whole body no moving beyond that everything else has moved so he will be here to control this church he will be veiled in the fire for Ministry speaking the truth in love telling you be no more babies be no more children oh well we're here amen so now Christy intelligence may be seated the voice of the Archangel charity adopts you then it becomes charity the voice of the Archangel and you will understand today's message because now you will understand today's message I'm getting ready I'm finished uh be you will become a young man and stop being a child little children and in in your place of trying 2 Peter 1: 14-7 pressing on to know him then adopted as a father and set out into in the Kingdom as a manifested son so starting today with a revelation to kill good self and manifest brotherly kindness and forgiveness then you can press on and you're pressing on on on Amen you can press on to do what to know him from
