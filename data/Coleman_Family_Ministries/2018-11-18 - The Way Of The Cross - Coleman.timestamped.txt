[0:00] so now we know that we've gone through
[0:03] trials and tribulations and adversities
[0:08] but by the help of God we want to show
[0:10] you that these are actually good but we
[0:14] got doing the word amen praise the Lord
[0:17] now the message is in found in
[0:19] Philippians the third chapter the
[0:22] seventh verse through the fifteenth
[0:24] verse and Hebrews the twelfth chapter
[0:29] verses one and two
[0:39] reading from Philippians first the third
[0:47] chapter seventh verse
[0:50] well what things were gain to me those I
[0:55] counted loss for Christ ei doubtless and
[0:58] I count all things but loss for the
[1:01] excellency C of the knowledge of Jesus
[1:04] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:09] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:12] count them but dung that I may win
[1:14] Christ and be found in him not having
[1:17] mine own righteousness which is of the
[1:20] law but that which is through the faith
[1:22] of Christ see the righteousness which is
[1:27] of God by faith that I made know him
[1:32] this is one thing that the one strength
[1:35] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:37] the Fellowship of his sufferings being
[1:41] made conformable unto his death if by
[1:43] any means I might attain unto the
[1:45] resurrection of the dead we understand
[1:48] this to beam out from the dead in the
[1:50] first resurrection the bride not as
[1:53] though I have all I had already attained
[1:55] either we're already perfect but I
[1:57] follow after if that I may apprehend
[2:00] that for which also I am apprehended of
[2:03] Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself
[2:06] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[2:09] do forgetting those things which are
[2:11] behind and reaching forth unto those
[2:13] things which are before I press toward
[2:18] the mark for the prize of the high
[2:20] calling of God in Christ Jesus let us
[2:24] therefore as many as be perfect this
[2:27] means as many as be mature grown-up
[2:30] full-grown be the smyrna and have this
[2:33] mind saying and if in anything you be
[2:36] otherwise minded god shall reveal even
[2:38] this unto you if you have any other
[2:41] purpose for following jesus christ and
[2:43] not the purpose of being perfected god
[2:45] he revealed to you that this is the
[2:47] message wherefore seeing we also are
[2:51] compassed
[2:52] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[2:55] those going on before us let us lay
[2:58] aside every weight and the sin which
[3:01] doth so easily beset us and let us run
[3:03] with patience the race that is set
[3:05] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[3:08] and finisher of our faith who for the
[3:11] joy that was set before him endured the
[3:14] cross despising the shame and is set
[3:17] down at the right hand of the throne of
[3:19] God may God a blessing the reading of
[3:22] his word I like the title list the way
[3:27] of the Cross and it may be in two parts
[3:31] I don't know I have some things that the
[3:33] Lord saying this morning will just be
[3:34] one to me I like to give another part of
[3:37] this Fellowship of his sufferings but
[3:40] you can't say everything at once see so
[3:42] I want to show is my purpose this
[3:45] morning to show you what you're doing
[3:47] now see and then let you know what
[3:50] you're getting ready to do see and then
[3:52] when you know the will of God then you
[3:53] got faith in what you're doing but
[3:55] you're all tangled up then you know
[3:57] where you're going then you add His
[3:58] mercy
[3:59] Satan's mercy then he got you saying
[4:01] yeah and he saw the buffing around it
[4:03] see but we want to know the Word of God
[4:05] now the message the way of the Cross now
[4:14] Paul is seen here in in the book of
[4:16] Hebrews your little breakwater thank you
[4:26] he says looking unto Jesus yeah that's
[4:31] the starting point
[4:32] excuse me right there looking unto Jesus
[4:35] one of the message that their brother
[4:38] Brandon preached when he was about to go
[4:39] away in 63 look away to Jesus
[4:42] make sure of what you're looking for
[4:45] what is your aim in life what is your
[4:47] desire is it Jesus
[4:50] or is it mixed part of the world and
[4:54] part of Jesus see do you want to live at
[4:57] the source of all things see because
[5:00] things that are made was made by that
[5:03] which is unseen which is the word so
[5:06] some people can only live a Christians
[5:08] out on the UH circumference where they
[5:11] can see things but the real source is at
[5:15] the core other words if you have gold
[5:18] out here see well you don't have to go
[5:21] out there Bigfoot out there go to the
[5:23] source where I come from because he made
[5:26] it there right and he's able to make
[5:29] anything else amen
[5:31] so then when you can get to the core
[5:33] from where it come from
[5:35] see then you can live my faith and ask
[5:39] God by faith now for therefore we are
[5:42] looking unto Jesus he is the author and
[5:46] the finisher
[5:47] he is the perfecter of our faith
[5:51] he is the author being he is the leader
[5:54] in the source of our faith it is only by
[6:00] him given the first incentive amen for
[6:05] our belief if he don't come and put it
[6:08] there you can't believe he must put it
[6:11] there and so he begins with a little
[6:14] seed and that little seed comes into
[6:16] light light strikes it it comes alive
[6:19] unto God Amen but he is also the
[6:23] finisher he's the one nobody else that
[6:28] can bring that seed of faith and to
[6:31] maturity and to perfection see now
[6:36] Christ has already conquered
[6:40] and he lives in us as a conqueror so we
[6:46] could put it straight we want Satan to
[6:48] know that we know this amen
[6:50] so we know where he's standing at now
[6:53] Christ lives in us and works by his
[6:58] promises for us get it now he lives in
[7:03] us see then when he goes to work he
[7:07] can't go through our flesh works he can
[7:10] only go through the prompted Leon the
[7:11] Bible then if we can believe these
[7:13] promises see like in prayer you come
[7:17] together in prayer you begin to meditate
[7:19] and find the will of God and then you a
[7:23] check out what you're asking for deceive
[7:25] us in the Bible to see if your situation
[7:27] happened to somebody back there in the
[7:29] Bible it's four types examples when you
[7:32] see your child because it's in the Bible
[7:35] you say well Lord God is there
[7:37] amen now I come in prayer for it and I
[7:41] ask in faith because it's there in the
[7:43] Bible amen see it's a Bible prayer and
[7:47] you ask for it he'll do it it's in the
[7:50] word amen praise the Lord so now God's
[7:53] purpose today God is trying to find
[7:57] someone and individual anybody that he
[8:01] can confirm himself through see that
[8:05] others might see that he lives the
[8:10] resurrected corn of wheat is living
[8:13] somewhere see and he can only live by
[8:17] resurrection power for in weakness
[8:20] because he was crucified see and then
[8:24] Christ now think of it it is only living
[8:27] by the power of God see the only way he
[8:32] can live to exist to think Jesus Christ
[8:34] is to live by God's power see and that's
[8:37] the power that he wants to pull through
[8:40] you but it can't come in until you die
[8:44] that's the law of the spiritual harvest
[8:46] something must die for you to live see
[8:49] it's got to be that way so you got to
[8:52] die to yourself
[8:53] then you can live by the power of his
[8:56] resurrection that is the only way so now
[9:01] the trouble today that there's a lack of
[9:04] authority faith you're the lack of God's
[9:07] people to step up fully and say Christ
[9:11] is in me get back Satan they're afraid
[9:15] to say that some reason they believe
[9:17] that they are joined by one spirit
[9:20] they say souls in the Bible are God's
[9:23] prophet has come and preached
[9:25] almighty message spiritual union of the
[9:27] bride and yet they still don't
[9:29] because appropriate there for themselves
[9:31] see hey man because the devil has told
[9:36] them that by a strong illusion that you
[9:39] are separated from him in a state of
[9:42] separation
[9:42] yes are you are in heavenly places
[9:45] sometime in church or maybe when you get
[9:49] a spirit of Prayer see them in there oh
[9:51] he tells you I'm sure you don't have the
[9:53] place is there but not when you I saw
[9:55] walking I've done because in the carnal
[9:56] you're not there no more he separate
[9:58] he's alive for Christ is in you Paul say
[10:03] it is not i but Christ liveth in me so
[10:06] does he stop living when you go out in
[10:08] the world for why does he go away
[10:11] somewhere no he abides right there
[10:14] amen see God has away he worse he don't
[10:18] change the father thinks two thoughts
[10:21] the son speaks the thoughts by faith and
[10:25] the Holy Spirit brings it to pass hey
[10:28] men Jesus Christ could walk the father
[10:32] thought it and whatever was blindness or
[10:35] death or whatever was the son know is
[10:38] got to be done so he gives thanks to the
[10:40] Father I thank you Heavenly Father then
[10:43] he speaks the word barfy amen that same
[10:47] Jesus Christ is abiding in you right now
[10:51] he is the one Joshua hey men that that
[10:56] steps forward that's the face when you
[10:59] see a person moving forward is not is
[11:00] Joshua in him moving forward
[11:04] amen because the Sun is the one who
[11:06] speaks to worry he said let there be the
[11:10] Sun says let there be amen Holy Spirit
[11:13] bring it to pass
[11:14] so therefore we see them that our
[11:17] spiritual vitality is cept at the roots
[11:21] through failure to boldly grafts this
[11:25] fact this truth Christ is in you win now
[11:29] we live back to his atoning work we said
[11:32] well yes because we were saved the 19
[11:34] song song song see and we know
[11:37] I'll be caught up to meet him that's at
[11:39] the end but what is he doing now well
[11:44] right now you just fall down in what you
[11:46] got
[11:46] faint enough to look back and say to
[11:49] look forward but what about right now
[11:51] see he won't know are you the sons of
[11:55] God not going to be but now now possess
[12:00] the positions in the lane do it now
[12:03] right now he has a spiritual law your
[12:07] feet must stand on the spot the soles of
[12:10] your feet must stand there well then you
[12:13] got to do something not your own words
[12:15] but he must be leading he is the one who
[12:18] leads to victory that right now he's
[12:21] here there joshua number there and when
[12:24] they were getting ready to move forward
[12:26] there was somebody stand-in there that
[12:28] one seen captain head right over the
[12:29] holes they are you for us or against us
[12:33] nay I'm the captain of the host I'm
[12:36] right here with you but you won't see me
[12:38] amen it's the Holy Spirit he's right
[12:40] there he's here now but for this time is
[12:43] season where you must have faith you
[12:46] don't see him right now
[12:47] but he's doing something mighty powerful
[12:49] he is discern now the Prophet says don't
[12:52] lay in the Sun if we've got to be here
[12:55] he's here amen
[12:57] so now our spiritual vitality is set at
[13:01] the root see through failure to grasp
[13:05] that he's in us now amen now we drive
[13:08] that home saying we have this spiritual
[13:12] union now see because it was snapped way
[13:16] back there
[13:17] because through Adam see because Adam
[13:20] died in the spirit to God see and then
[13:24] he was resurrected in the flesh to Satan
[13:26] that right
[13:28] somebody had has got to come forth and
[13:30] he did Christ to die in the flesh and
[13:33] Satan and be resurrected back to God
[13:35] amen and we do the same thing
[13:38] praise the Lord see now watch now here
[13:42] is the era de Carrera Satan makes it
[13:47] appear by a strong delusion that we are
[13:52] separated right now so we say we are
[13:55] sitting in heavenly places up there
[13:57] alright see but he keeps us in a state
[14:00] of separation from Christ here on earth
[14:03] but if we up there he's also down here
[14:06] he's in us right now
[14:07] amen see therefore if we listen to Satan
[14:11] we are at Satan's mercy Amen see then
[14:16] when a crises come we're weak because we
[14:18] think he's up there but he's in You amen
[14:21] and it never got he smiles then he got
[14:25] you running around because I'll to pray
[14:27] for me help me Oh see he's right in you
[14:29] mm see calling upon the name of the Lord
[14:34] I'm a help a present help at a time of
[14:37] need look to there from which cometh
[14:39] your skirt he's in you crisis in you so
[14:43] when a decision is to be made you waver
[14:45] because we waver see but not realize but
[14:50] see is through knowledge that we get to
[14:53] know him hidden we know where we're
[14:55] standing here that's why the word had to
[14:57] come the Pentecostals all shook up when
[15:00] a prophet brought that word and brought
[15:03] paint down to us we know what we're
[15:05] standing up now amen
[15:06] see so we see our weaknesses and we cry
[15:10] see we ask from help from the outside
[15:14] now he says he is the author on the
[15:17] inside outside he's on the inside
[15:22] and outside oh the power that he has is
[15:25] hidden you now yeah he says that's right
[15:29] oh the parent God's troll is in you now
[15:32] right now but all you have to do is to
[15:36] realize that see you mean though so now
[15:39] so therefore we can't aside our faith we
[15:43] listen to Satan's or suggestions see he
[15:46] said well you don't see and strong
[15:48] delusions it will because look how you
[15:50] feel you say well yeah that's right big
[15:51] I don't feel good
[15:52] ty yeah see that's right see and he tell
[15:56] you all these things and then you look
[15:58] at the flesh you look at because your
[16:00] own carnal state see so therefore in a
[16:03] time like this when you strongly you
[16:05] move in we are to draw the sort of
[16:08] spirit and step out boldly and possess
[16:12] our positions see the word is here the
[16:16] promise and we come into it but once we
[16:20] get in there
[16:21] you gotta move forward and take every
[16:25] promise by faith Joshua in the tape had
[16:29] to take every belt that you will fail
[16:31] because they fail in tight you fall down
[16:35] Satan he will assault you a thousand
[16:38] times yes sir yes just remember that now
[16:42] brother he's gonna come against you
[16:44] he's not gonna bleed okay he know
[16:46] because you don't believe it yet so you
[16:49] don't Bluff you hey man I'll make you
[16:51] proud every every it's a grin you stand
[16:53] all you wanted to prove it yes sir
[16:55] praise God
[16:56] see so then when we could catch the
[16:59] revelation we could say we are one with
[17:01] God he is the vine I'm the branch
[17:04] his life is flowing through me and I'm
[17:07] strong by faith because he has given me
[17:09] his strength virtue amen
[17:12] he's giving me knowledge and through
[17:14] knowledge state now I know where yet now
[17:15] the prophet has taught me amen through
[17:18] knowledge I know where I'm standing at
[17:20] Satan I know that God has carved me has
[17:24] elected me
[17:26] come to that place to get the Wreckers
[17:29] tan there and know that God is going to
[17:33] add to my faith
[17:34] hurt you in knowledge and temperance and
[17:37] patience and kindness and brotherly
[17:39] kindness and then the love of God God
[17:42] let's all say he's gonna do it but Steve
[17:46] said well you don't feel a thing now
[17:47] that's all right I also have noticed
[17:50] that the faith is to grow
[17:52] amen amen praise God
[17:55] it's all right Satan live where I'm
[17:57] strong by faith and said I lies because
[18:01] I had his wisdom amen I'm redeemed I had
[18:05] his Redemption I'm sanctified I have
[18:08] this sanctification get back Satan you
[18:12] see them back up I have love I have
[18:16] peace I have joy I have meekness
[18:19] humility the seat is in me Satan I have
[18:24] it now all i gotta do seconds to go
[18:26] forward and put this sort of the spirit
[18:29] out there as right now having now and
[18:33] possessing now amen
[18:35] is that right brain yes sir amen then
[18:39] when we do that right now now see in the
[18:43] faith works in the spiritual realm
[18:45] so when faith Christ in you said let
[18:49] there be see you me now in the spiritual
[18:52] realm it begins to happen people are
[18:54] doing it keep on doing it keep on doing
[18:56] it pretty soon it begins to manifest
[18:59] itself out here in the census praise God
[19:03] pretty soon love begins to take all the
[19:06] emotion take over fection
[19:09] praise God faith begins to take over
[19:12] reason amen
[19:14] the characters of God take over your own
[19:17] character takes it completely over
[19:19] brings every heart every high thought
[19:23] that exalted gifts caught bring it to
[19:25] captivity
[19:26] the word bring all those crazy doctors
[19:29] bring into the Word of God ever powers
[19:31] their children today
[19:32] Amen praise God that's right can't dare
[19:36] our imagination to the word who does it
[19:41] Christ the author the finisher of our
[19:43] faith praise God
[19:45] whether it be power love joy knowledge
[19:49] we possess it we say I got it now Amen
[19:53] see then when we begin to act on it
[19:57] Christ ahead becomes manifest in and
[20:00] through the body then you see him living
[20:03] I didn't say solder people have come
[20:06] here and said so I hope you got there
[20:09] you maybe you don't see it they see it
[20:12] and the Lord knows that you don't see it
[20:14] here
[20:15] but he sent a witness amen praise the
[20:19] Lord amen Satan is a liar and the powder
[20:25] of it amen
[20:27] Christ has conquered for he said he is
[20:31] the author and the finisher of the faith
[20:33] but faith must possess its positions my
[20:38] positions is to be loved peace and joy
[20:42] and all these thing about I have to
[20:43] possess it see now he says a strong
[20:46] illusion through unbelief he says that
[20:49] we are carnal right now he said your
[20:51] carnal see it says so now either I can
[20:55] believe through unbelief in the power of
[20:59] evil or I can believe by faith in the
[21:03] power of God see the power evil that
[21:08] he's strong it in Christ because Christ
[21:10] is a strong man it's for coming to the
[21:12] house and buying him up so which pile is
[21:15] working which which had the strength
[21:17] excuse me so thus saint seiya carnal
[21:21] thus in actual experience we feel and we
[21:26] see carnality until we turn our unbelief

[24:19] all believers say God is Almighty God
[24:25] can do this God can do that God can do
[24:28] so so but how many say god is almighty
[24:32] and me haha how many say God can do so
[24:38] or so God could do this God could do
[24:40] that in me
[24:41] how many can say that how many can say
[24:44] such as I have I'll give unto the you
[24:45] rise up in the name of Jesus Christ how
[24:48] many of you say it see Amen see their
[24:52] lives the essence of Moses controversy
[24:57] with God at the burning bush God was
[25:00] saying come now I will send you down to
[25:03] deliver my people see Moses was replying
[25:07] I believe that you can and that you will
[25:11] do it for me I can't do that amen
[25:15] that was molten see now God's power was
[25:19] not in question for Moses knew that God
[25:22] could do it but what wasn't question was
[25:26] where the guy would do it through him
[25:29] amen
[25:30] soy is a day what is in question we know
[25:33] that God can do because he did it he was
[25:35] prophet hey man we've seen him do it to
[25:39] his prophet
[25:41] he believed it he had the faith to
[25:44] believe that you know many people say
[25:46] what brother Prem has vision so for that
[25:47] may had more faith and all to put
[25:49] together do you realize in 1962 there he
[25:53] had the goat and tell everybody that he
[25:54] was gonna open to seven singles that's
[25:57] exactly right
[25:58] didn't even have that vision yet because
[25:59] in December by faith he said that I'm
[26:03] going to preach one of seven seals way
[26:05] 62n right by faith he said so then in
[26:08] December he had that great visitation to
[26:11] go out west but by faith he said that
[26:13] there's deer the Cochino by faith Amen
[26:17] see now it was Moses appropriation and
[26:22] his obedience see on faith that hung in
[26:26] the balance so it is today obedience and
[26:29] whether we will because appropriate what
[26:32] God has sent see amen
[26:36] now when Moses did go forth amen
[26:40] the scripture says his obituary by faith
[26:42] Moses cross the Red Sea amen he did it
[26:46] by faith by faith
[26:47] Rahab by faith law everybody did it by
[26:51] faith then we must do it by faith
[26:55] because if they would write a little bit
[26:57] longer longer then it would say you
[26:59] what's faith by faith you recognize
[27:05] Christ in His Prophet by faith you move
[27:09] that sixty three or four back there
[27:12] because the Prophet spoke it you said
[27:14] that is the will of God I don't know how
[27:16] it won't be authority
[27:17] that have a spoke many things you by
[27:20] faith believe it
[27:22] amen by faith you moved under that
[27:25] anointed that annoying stuff to see you
[27:28] see that I understand it but I'll stand
[27:31] with him being on the Mia coordinate our
[27:34] Lord amen you have already moved out
[27:37] don't even know it an anointing come
[27:39] down pulled you out of there just come
[27:43] on come along with me I'm the unseen
[27:45] captain you just moved along all
[27:47] confidence haven't you moving along
[27:48] anyway hey by faith if they were to add
[27:52] to be brutal living it would say the
[27:54] bride in the end time fine
[27:56] hey in the Word of God to live it to the
[27:59] prime mover Hey
[28:02] received a man like because Rebecca back
[28:05] you didn't even know the man but they
[28:07] heard his words amen and they said I
[28:10] will go without even question it told a
[28:14] pastor and a church Bigley banning them
[28:17] see I will go that right that's what she
[28:20] did by faith she did it see Amy
[28:23] so Moses by faith went all down Israel
[28:27] he was baptized into the burning bush
[28:30] first of course and he met the Word of
[28:32] God amen
[28:34] praise the Lord so therefore most had
[28:37] all the qualities in him and then God
[28:40] annoyed those qualities at the burning
[28:42] bush he knew he was supposed to do it
[28:44] you know he tried to do it before in the
[28:47] flesh we've done many flesh works I'm
[28:51] trying to do it Lord
[28:52] that's alright so go ahead I'm trying
[28:54] too hard go ahead and say but one day
[28:57] that anointing strikes it then it just
[29:00] falls back hey man it knows who it is I
[29:04] was back there when the sons of God
[29:06] shouted for joy praise God
[29:08] it's being how it's being revealed to
[29:10] you wisdom comes to you see and wisdom
[29:13] brings understanding amen see
[29:15] understanding brings your knowledge and
[29:17] then because first they come to your
[29:20] faith is rate to strength the next one
[29:22] is knowledge see then through knowledge
[29:24] you say well all this is for me
[29:26] you call me God see he says yeah
[29:29] and you say well for the joy amen
[29:33] that's it before me it's the promise
[29:35] that just the future home of the Brian -
[29:37] Brian all this joy it's it right before
[29:40] you Amen by vision amen it gives you
[29:43] understanding then no matter what
[29:46] happens to you
[29:47] saffron's child persecutions for the joy
[29:50] that was set before me by the seven
[29:53] seals I got a vision get back Satan get
[29:56] back amen you get the breaststroke
[29:58] amen hey hey you have to swim this
[30:02] Bristol for look for are we floating
[30:04] right now amen
[30:06] he will quicken the pace soon and you
[30:08] begin to swim there move on out amen
[30:10] that's now here's a knowledge your eyes
[30:14] eyes is the faith of the unknown
[30:16] understand I said it's a heart all right
[30:19] when he brings you through all of these
[30:21] trials like Shadrach and Emma Daniel the
[30:24] first thing you get is wisdom
[30:25] understanding that right see gives you
[30:28] wisdom first wisdom is a revelation of
[30:30] God and Paul said how big I'll speak
[30:32] wisdom on to mature people all right not
[30:36] to babes mature people because babes
[30:39] take the wisdom and get no hard and get
[30:40] all puffed up amen but mature people sit
[30:43] right there and see or read a car just
[30:47] drink it in a man they're growing
[30:49] they're adding you add by knowledge
[30:51] that's why Paul said that I made know
[30:53] him yet to know him as eternal life st.
[30:58] John 17:3 to know him is eternal amen
[31:03] and then when you know him you begin to
[31:05] know his you begin to partake of his
[31:08] divine nature so st. Peter and right now
[31:11] by adding him in he's the word coming in
[31:14] now so you don't see it but Mary didn't
[31:17] see nobody standing either play it was
[31:18] growing hey man
[31:19] so therefore from the time by faith
[31:23] Moses spoke nowhere to got with
[31:26] Authority and was uncomfortable couldn't
[31:28] conquer him he knew
[31:30] amen so therefore Mary did the same
[31:32] thing and what about the bride today we
[31:35] say bye hey we do it see now remember I
[31:39] want to hurry up I won't keep it too
[31:41] long I want to drive that thought home
[31:43] to you
[31:43] now remember fate so you understand
[31:47] right now see faith begins by being a
[31:50] laborer and we get the scripture for
[31:52] that
[31:52] Hebrews 4:11 I want to give you the word
[31:56] for that let us labor therefore to enter
[32:00] into that rest lest any man fall after
[32:03] the same example of unbelief
[32:06] so now labor let us be eager to know
[32:10] this rest to know him see he is the rest
[32:13] see let us make every effort to enter in
[32:17] excuse me let us be stillness and exert
[32:20] ourselves to strive see to me now it's
[32:23] also it's also called a fight sing of
[32:28] first Timothy 6:12 he calls it a fight
[32:31] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[32:35] put your hands on it
[32:37] hey man it's substance you know lay hold
[32:40] on it see you got a whole other thing
[32:42] lay hold on eternal life we're into the
[32:46] our call and has professed a good
[32:48] profession before many witnesses so now
[32:51] our faith the author Christ begins seed
[32:54] form as a laborer as a faint now
[32:58] everybody in there any Old Testament
[33:00] they fought and never receive the
[33:02] promise well think of you oh you have
[33:07] been ordained to fight and receive the
[33:10] promise in the flesh in the last days
[33:14] the sons of God shall be made manifest
[33:17] he shall reveal unto the sons of God the
[33:20] glories of God now that's our charge we
[33:24] call for that that's right you you're
[33:26] fighting now right now you're leaving
[33:29] now but you're coming into something
[33:31] like capstone you would see stem c4 so
[33:37] therefore you'll be happy when it
[33:39] actually happens you said thank God
[33:41] labor our fourth through sixty two three
[33:44] four five I was assaulted by the enemy
[33:48] but I cut up a press for I persisted
[33:51] like we are the heroes back there in the
[33:55] Bible they
[33:56] pour it on berrak and all the make it
[33:58] because getting on all of samson all of
[34:00] them amen
[34:01] they never received the promise it's for
[34:04] the end time for you the bride and
[34:06] there's something frames for take on it
[34:08] now and it is consummated in a rest
[34:13] philippians 2 16 praise our God hey
[34:19] the word of life that I may rejoice when
[34:22] in the day and hey capstone day in the
[34:26] day of Christ that I have not run in
[34:27] vain neither labored in vain amen
[34:32] see and now watch then this is to say
[34:35] that off I'll call it the first stage
[34:37] from say 63 up to now is the first stage
[34:40] of your faith see there's a finish also
[34:43] this because because beginning and a
[34:45] finish and you won't partake of both of
[34:48] them Amen that's right
[34:50] these signs shall follow them that
[34:52] believe the Jawa of the harvest shall be
[34:55] with you oh yeah that's coming that's
[34:57] the power of God it's coming the fruit
[34:59] ripens in the top of the tree it's gonna
[35:01] be in you praise God
[35:03] see now the faith the first stage of
[35:05] your faith is always the battle so Beryl
[35:09] all the way through your Bibles of
[35:11] valency of taking hold by the will by
[35:14] the heart in the knowledge of God's
[35:17] promise now brother Branham brought us
[35:19] knowledge of the promises of God and we
[35:22] see it first a wisdom because comes down
[35:25] because revelation wisdom wisdom strikes
[35:29] the heart and gets understanding the
[35:31] wise shall know their God that's what's
[35:33] called the wise virgins the wise shall
[35:36] know know that God he's the word a hey
[35:40] man and do mighty exploits when they
[35:42] know who he is first but they want to do
[35:45] that exploit they can without knowing
[35:46] him first
[35:47] you gotta know his will hi he works
[35:49] first see now so the battle is taking
[35:53] hold now see of God's promises right now
[35:56] now watch see which is not listen to
[36:00] these very words the the promise is not
[36:03] real to you now in experience it's not
[36:06] real that's the whole idea
[36:08] and that's
[36:09] where satan captcha where he's away you
[36:11] don't have this love now you heard that
[36:13] before right right around here you ain't
[36:16] got it
[36:16] where's your power you ain't got none
[36:19] even know the will of God they don't
[36:21] even know that they are to apprehend
[36:23] this see that they are to move on and
[36:26] show this fight this faith first not
[36:28] expect God soon as the prophet go off
[36:31] the seemed to be in the flesh and pour
[36:32] out his Holy Spirit upon top of it
[36:33] no sir you could had a fight he didn't
[36:36] say that there he's to him that endure
[36:38] to the end better write him to press us
[36:41] on so a lot of people didn't want to
[36:42] press on they ain't got nothin ain't
[36:44] nobody got enough there's that
[36:45] unbelieving devil right there get away
[36:47] from me Satan I don't want to even see
[36:49] him nowhere because God has given us
[36:52] faith to pass on he's give us an
[36:55] understanding heart to know the
[36:58] knowledge of God to know who we are and
[37:00] what we're doing they don't know what
[37:02] they're doing
[37:03] therefore they want power to do how to
[37:05] do your glory of God no sir
[37:07] powers in you see it's a sea is growing
[37:10] they don't know that see but we move on
[37:13] anyway now okay so therefore just it
[37:17] this truth promise is not real to us now
[37:19] in experienced sea but we declare it to
[37:23] be ours in spite of all our appearances
[37:27] then right all right the farmer farmer
[37:30] says that he's got a wheat field he sees
[37:34] a bleed he said I don't care what you
[37:35] say I have a wheat field in spite of all
[37:38] appearances he's got a wheat field all
[37:41] right next thing you know he's got a
[37:44] little tussle he said in spite of all
[37:45] all appearances in spite of this Carlos
[37:49] state I have a wheat field I hit coming
[37:52] up amen didn't the shuck comps he said
[37:55] that's not it there it's on the inside
[37:57] damn it it's still coming then when it
[38:00] finally gets to that stage after the
[38:01] latter report on top of it gets green
[38:04] yeah yeah it's milky needs to be dried
[38:07] out but in spite of that green
[38:10] appearance in 65 and so forth 56 in
[38:14] spite of that green appearance being
[38:17] sticky and milky see that was still a
[38:20] weak field
[38:21] God says touch not mine
[38:22] do my prophets no longer my anointed
[38:24] ones the little ones out there that is
[38:27] my week they're all right and anybody
[38:29] comes against it there'll be like
[38:31] touching because ten million volts
[38:32] that's right that's his wheat his little
[38:36] wart see so now the author of the faith
[38:39] by faith plant a seed in your hearts for
[38:42] the foundation of work he knows where
[38:46] they are he throws the water upon it and
[38:48] he's gonna bring that seed to maturity
[38:50] at the end so it grows right on down see
[38:54] a lot is growing is going through
[38:56] something experiences it has many
[39:00] adventures let's calm because adventures
[39:03] alright
[39:04] adventures that's what it has plenty of
[39:07] experiences and so forth now so
[39:10] therefore we do not appear to be dead
[39:13] but see but and because we come unto sin
[39:17] and live unto God but we are because we
[39:20] appear but we are told to believe it the
[39:22] Prophet said believe it he said in order
[39:26] for you to get the D talking you it must
[39:29] be told because obedience to every word
[39:32] in all of you to receive a token now
[39:35] so therefore when we dare to believe it
[39:38] and you got to because of declaring like
[39:40] Mary did she said be done to me you
[39:43] gotta say it
[39:43] see they think you're nuts like right
[39:46] now I hope you got there right now we
[39:50] have the audacity to declare that we
[39:52] have the Holy Ghost in us and all around
[39:56] us they said you have got nothing
[39:57] Amy do you hope you see it now you see
[40:01] it unbelieving devil that rather bleed
[40:03] at you have a guy then then believe
[40:04] because you have it now where's the
[40:07] faith that see what you're facing now
[40:08] that's unbelief that comes into your
[40:10] midst ain't nobody got to save became
[40:12] about I got this over here says unbelief
[40:14] when he has come and quicken every word
[40:16] through the Bible life he's pours Brun
[40:19] into every word and you break one word
[40:22] you don't see it then what you did while
[40:25] you liver
[40:26] yeah because you'll be judged later on
[40:29] but you already did you have judgy homes
[40:31] all right thing for you broke one word
[40:34] your books are prophets message see them
[40:38] in them you break it there nothing
[40:40] happens to you go on you get blessed in
[40:42] his permissive will sure because you
[40:45] feel the holy fish sure it's all right
[40:46] but when that seed that does believe it
[40:49] comes out into maturity then when you
[40:52] begin to look for that over there yes
[40:54] judgment over there see it believe it
[40:56] now amen see praise the Lord so
[40:59] therefore Slayton like he's doing now
[41:02] will assault you oh he'll sort your
[41:05] faith and sometimes you fall down good
[41:08] Joshua did see because because akin
[41:11] unbelief in the camp don't believe it
[41:14] don't believe the promises of God God
[41:16] said it it belongs to me they don't
[41:18] believe it they got to see with their
[41:20] eyes they got to be in a holdout of
[41:23] hallelujah and got to feel it and see it
[41:25] when they're not realizing that it is by
[41:28] faith you get it because Hebrews 11 by
[41:31] faith because you apprehend it because
[41:34] of probated to yourself you're staying
[41:35] on that ground each piece of ground you
[41:37] my face they don't understand that now
[41:39] see it's another spirit spirit of Church
[41:42] Eve spirit looking for new life see no
[41:46] unbelief will say it is not so and
[41:50] belief will say shut up unbelief it is
[41:52] so and do not they'll get mad at you oh
[41:57] they will actually get mad at you for
[41:59] saying because it is so because they
[42:02] don't believe it is so and then they
[42:04] will exert employ every effort to go and
[42:07] prove to your people that isn't that so
[42:08] and then you come right back and employ
[42:11] and exert and strive every effort to
[42:13] prove it is all amen praise God by the
[42:17] sword of the Spirit amen
[42:19] do you see you in a death struggle see
[42:21] right now spiritual wickedness right
[42:25] here on earth here see amen
[42:27] so therefore Joshua in Israel they got
[42:30] up he says don't pray Josh we get up sit
[42:33] in the camp get up from there
[42:35] Oh pray models top right and get the
[42:38] center
[42:38] see when you get the sin out then you
[42:40] see something happened then see now as
[42:43] we follow in the footsteps of those who
[42:47] by faith and patience waited because to
[42:50] inherit the promised see something
[42:52] begins to happen within you don't see
[42:55] you see but it begins to happen with him
[42:58] now right now the son his presence is
[43:01] doing something within horses in what
[43:04] then is outlet I hope you can see baby
[43:07] grows in the mother you don't see but
[43:10] see the form of it that's what the
[43:12] prophets son and wife sees the form of
[43:15] it inside I hope you got there posted
[43:19] our labour and travail then Christ be
[43:22] formed in you
[43:23] our prophet brings on labor pains he
[43:27] Labor's travails with the bracket to
[43:30] edit until crisis form and when a seed
[43:33] is taken whole practicals off the scene
[43:36] and let that seed begin to fight the
[43:38] good fight of faith begin to labor hey
[43:41] men labor to bring forth that job Jesus
[43:44] Christ I hope you get it fresh
[43:46] is he getting through to you amen praise
[43:49] God see there for the spirit will
[43:53] cooperate he's waiting to do it the son
[43:56] said it is so and down he comes a
[43:59] refreshing breeze comes down a man and
[44:02] begins to cooperate with the word the
[44:04] word said it the holy spread brings it
[44:06] to pass his presence is doing it right
[44:09] now
[44:09] shaping and molding a bride through
[44:12] trials and also adversities and because
[44:15] persecutions see now then to our faith
[44:18] is added because assurance blessed
[44:21] assurance and assurance is when you head
[44:23] it and then you it begins to add to your
[44:26] faith and uh because knowledge and so
[44:28] for all this added seeing now then as
[44:32] it's being added as you're laboring as
[44:34] you're fighting in the first stage of
[44:36] your faith see as you're doing these
[44:39] things here it comes on you
[44:40] unconsciously it's an unconscious growth
[44:43] you're just going everyday but you're
[44:46] fighting the good fight of faith and
[44:47] your labor in the good fight of faith
[44:48] see and your labor and fighting every
[44:50] day see now
[44:51] then before you know it the
[44:53] constellation comes the capstone before
[44:55] you even know it the consummation to
[44:58] finish her he's the author and the
[45:00] finisher the Perfector a man he comes
[45:02] down I'm a prove it to you because by
[45:05] apolinaria he comes down see and comes
[45:08] in love and says here is the finished
[45:11] product and it out it goes see but first
[45:15] he did a work on the inside that nobody
[45:17] else knew what he was doing
[45:18] amen see then the consummation of faith
[45:22] has been reached
[45:24] this summit does the thing because
[45:27] you're because looking for you can't do
[45:29] it left I'm on top the mountain and the
[45:31] Prophet said when you climb up their
[45:32] mountain and get to the top by faith
[45:34] then you're break-in to powers visions
[45:37] glories of God up at the top of the
[45:39] mountain you up on the top 10 amen
[45:42] but you you know you got up there by
[45:44] experience now when he's there with you
[45:46] the whole brother Satan has got to get
[45:48] back mountain be thou removed go into
[45:51] the sea like Adam go over there go over
[45:53] there self for spoken word of God see
[45:55] but when you get there you'll know that
[45:58] you stayed with that word no matter how
[46:01] many Devils said that it is not so you
[46:02] say it is so amen
[46:04] see then the law of the capstone is the
[46:06] finish that he comes down now then what
[46:09] once sixty three four five six and seven
[46:12] eight and there it was a effort to
[46:14] maintain also labor for now comes easy
[46:19] as breathing just walking the Prophet
[46:21] says so there goes the statue of a
[46:24] perfect man loves inner faith joy is all
[46:28] in him yes follow what would you have me
[46:31] to do go on a corner with stand over at
[46:33] the foot thus saith the Lord if he goes
[46:34] stands right there he's big of it
[46:36] because obedience and there he stands he
[46:39] has all of the faith the wrapped in
[46:42] faith it is just in him now all I need
[46:44] is a trumpet blasts because it's the
[46:47] word pay man he hears that deadly crash
[46:50] raised up and so forth and in and
[46:52] whatever has to be happens and away you
[46:54] go
[46:54] but the thing is he's got to have
[46:56] perfect love and love as the capstone
[46:58] amen
[46:59] so therefore that is
[47:02] the law see if there's a faith there's a
[47:04] law of faith it's got to be fought
[47:06] Leoben out then finished off and then
[47:11] the finishing touch is Jesus Christ
[47:14] himself the love of God is the finishing
[47:16] touch then he shows you their product
[47:18] their dresses it all up nice here it is
[47:21] see and it is what it says it is to not
[47:25] in a false box you know that me see all
[47:27] just will be currently outside of me see
[47:29] now all the equalities is in the second
[47:33] stage right now and they must be in
[47:35] there
[47:36] see when he anoints it now quickly the
[47:39] way of the Cross this because three
[47:41] aspects of the way of the Cross did the
[47:44] atoning work which we had to which we
[47:46] all been through the identification with
[47:48] Jesus Christ the word which is right now
[47:50] see it died on the cross we are now
[47:53] identifying ourselves with the word he
[47:55] has come and said here's my word and we
[47:57] said that's the word and we do it see
[47:59] and in doing so we're dying on the cross
[48:02] on the cross see okay go quickly then
[48:06] when we realize through knowledge that
[48:08] we are because crucified with him then
[48:11] you could start to add something to that
[48:12] then the token is added then when you go
[48:15] on the cross and die daily see and then
[48:18] the token is add the life of Christ
[48:19] comes in as you die and because I can
[48:21] your own life in his life comes here see
[48:24] now there's an another stage see the
[48:27] dying of the old man this is the same
[48:30] second stage and the rising by power of
[48:33] god of the new man is an actual permit
[48:37] and with experience that you never
[48:39] forget because God did it see me now
[48:43] it's gotta be done on the inside first
[48:45] because the third stage C is more trials
[48:49] but that's for the outside and the third
[48:52] stage is to die out for others that was
[48:56] Jesus Christ that was the early church
[48:58] the okona wheat that was Paul that was
[49:00] william branham he told his son Paul
[49:02] it's not for me it's for you it ever
[49:06] season it because Paul said that death
[49:09] worketh in me but life for you I die in
[49:12] this body every day we
[49:14] if Paul died then the people could feed
[49:18] on the resurrected life of Christ in
[49:20] pause amen
[49:22] see we fit on the resurrected life in
[49:25] brother Branham as he died daily well
[49:28] God has ordained a few a bride to come
[49:32] forth soon and to die daily and to go
[49:36] out and that life might be seen out
[49:38] there
[49:38] the life of Jesus Christ therefore that
[49:41] is what we are believing here and that
[49:44] is what we are coming to now that's why
[49:46] Paul says as many as are perfect mature
[49:49] and have this understanding let us walk
[49:51] by the same rule here see amen
[49:54] see me now so now because in closing the
[49:58] first and second stage is for us as
[50:01] individuals the third stage is for
[50:04] others see he's preparing you for
[50:07] something he's going to show himself
[50:09] through you but right now in the second
[50:11] stage now we identify yourself with
[50:13] every word then every word can come down
[50:15] and identify itself with you and we're
[50:17] practically amen see which is the
[50:21] anointing see no oh well I'll skip this
[50:25] here maybe I can because pick it up
[50:26] later I want to get to something here
[50:29] now yes now we want to all overcome are
[50:35] you tired
[50:36] well 10 minutes more amen
[50:39] come want to strike this here I see
[50:41] something getting tired there so now
[50:43] watch to overcome we all want to
[50:45] overcome but we've got to have knowledge
[50:47] Paul said to know him see therefore dear
[50:51] disciples before they even become a
[50:53] sieve the Holy Ghost he opened the
[50:55] scriptures to them that right and st.
[50:58] Luke 24 45 he opened up the entire word
[51:01] to them he spoke things pertaining to
[51:03] the kingdom of God to them all the need
[51:06] now was annoying a striking song see so
[51:08] Christ has slipped down now and open the
[51:12] scriptures to us through the seven seals
[51:14] that right and we ant we are we
[51:17] appropriate that's been cut to ourselves
[51:18] see me now now we have to have the
[51:23] Murnau's in Christ
[51:24] see the early disciples had it
[51:26] I had a brother branham had it because
[51:28] many others had it see now we want the
[51:30] same I see now watch well that mine we
[51:33] read count of joy when you fall into
[51:36] divers temptations what can we do it
[51:38] see rejoice in your tribulation because
[51:41] can we do it see but they did we said
[51:45] well how could they rejoice is a
[51:47] revelation it's a revelation now you got
[51:51] to have revelation when the early church
[51:53] got a revelation to sell their goods get
[51:57] now somebody else didn't get that
[51:59] revelation
[52:00] therefore they only so part of it
[52:01] because I handed pot the money but those
[52:04] who sold it turn all the money in the
[52:06] revelation hey man pick up a nasa
[52:10] sapphire so what they did imitate it is
[52:13] what will because we'll keep back part
[52:15] of it
[52:15] no no revelation trying to do it see and
[52:19] what have the holy spirit out i hope you
[52:22] read me hey man prays along please a
[52:25] revelation
[52:25] so can enjoy and these things is a
[52:28] revelation
[52:29] they had this revelation and that's what
[52:33] god is bringing us up to now you right
[52:35] here he's bringing to a revelation that
[52:38] you counted joy to fall into divers
[52:41] temptations for we assure you because by
[52:43] the word this morning now see we want to
[52:46] know him and the power of his
[52:48] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[52:51] suffering now do you want to know those
[52:52] things and if you really want to know
[52:54] there's a joyful thing to know because
[52:56] it's a joy amen the Fellowship of his
[53:00] sufferings it's a joke that's exactly
[53:03] right
[53:03] see but we got to come to that our minds
[53:06] got understand out there we have to get
[53:08] over these little petty things here a
[53:09] man thing so now we got to know the true
[53:13] method of facing handling me and using
[53:17] for good see all forms of it adversity
[53:22] that's thinking we've got to know the
[53:26] truth method how to handle how to face
[53:28] and how to use every evil thing hey hope

[53:44] higher but God said you want to come up
[53:47] there do the Word of God he will show it
[53:50] to you see what I'm saying we gotta know
[53:53] the true method of facing handling and
[53:57] using for good now it says on the word
[54:00] Romans 8:28 all things that write evil
[54:05] or good works together for good to them
[54:09] that love God amen on the try see if you
[54:12] get it say Amen praise the Lord see now
[54:15] okay all experiences of what we call
[54:19] evil like you know shocks suffering
[54:24] difficulty disaster unjust because
[54:28] treatments if you were to get a shock at
[54:30] the service this morning say man now you
[54:32] would know if your spiritual that it
[54:34] works together for good
[54:35] it's my was the shock e with some bad
[54:37] news or something like that you said
[54:39] well praise God just heard the because
[54:41] preachers say that it works together for
[54:42] good so they don't happen to you this
[54:45] morning they say Amen now the key see
[54:49] our evils watch this now our evils are
[54:53] never happenings happenings in
[54:56] themselves see but the effect that we
[55:01] allowed them to have on us there is the
[55:05] trouble the thing it is subacute harm
[55:08] you but their fear that we get against
[55:11] them it tears you to pieces can't sleep
[55:14] can't eat can't praise god can't sing
[55:17] can't sit down I can't read the Bible
[55:18] can't pray their back Tonya of evil amen
[55:26] take it in now I'm driving home now so
[55:29] you get died there you see me now I like
[55:31] when you start out we have unity here
[55:33] you to yourself is the lubricated
[55:36] because of the machine the machine was
[55:38] the Word of God you gotta have that
[55:40] because to begin with and you want to
[55:42] become lubricates it and in having unity
[55:44] you got to die people have all kind of
[55:47] odd habits strange behaviors
[55:50] you know things like that there and
[55:52] because of Georgia in the beginning see
[55:56] but you got to look and what little
[55:58] statue of Christ is in them and say well
[56:01] praise God for that little bit I see
[56:03] there and don't look at the remote that
[56:06] is a be manana you got to think that
[56:09] Christ and His love takes care of yours
[56:12] more waiter come
[56:14] so therefore the Lord let me love you
[56:18] like you love me see see me now no
[56:22] matter how flesh he looks no matter if
[56:25] it it was old or whatever it is do you
[56:27] mean now no matter what it is he brings
[56:29] us all together different tongues and
[56:30] dialects and so forth different strange
[56:32] mannerisms I myself used to be a person
[56:35] used to watch every little thing because
[56:36] you do before I would say I had I
[56:38] couldn't stand certain things see them
[56:40] in now so there God had to beat all it
[56:42] out of me
[56:42] I'll watch everything I because I have
[56:44] it with me I got to see what's in there
[56:46] what's over there what's over there i
[56:47] watch everything but now he uses that
[56:49] praise the Lord see well that's we are
[56:52] wise you guys are driving my poor wife
[56:54] crazy what's this here what's this over
[56:56] there so forth on see see see
[56:58] but now see but see God used that as
[57:00] that's in the nature Amen see but then
[57:03] you begin to overcome no matter what he
[57:05] does or what he does what about what I'm
[57:07] doing this because up because up because
[57:10] that because an office also what God in
[57:14] His love takes away mind it is old time
[57:17] a man in his own time see when he wants
[57:21] to
[57:21] so we guys say well Lord God let thy
[57:24] will be done
[57:25] see so therefore in a place like that
[57:28] there you begin to mold you together and
[57:31] he said but this so how can you
[57:33] understand this person keep on doing
[57:34] this thing great sin grace does more
[57:37] about we said so whole I don't believe
[57:42] in here there's more grace than race car
[57:45] it'll take care of it it'll mold it and
[57:48] shape it into a unit lubricated by unity
[57:51] and they'll come and see it
[57:53] amen there still be those who are raised
[57:56] up sorry I love them I can't do nothing
[58:00] because it's established
[58:02] and God has set the thing there he put
[58:05] the oil in there the lubricating on the
[58:08] unity it's moving on through every part
[58:09] of machine every part of worried amen
[58:12] praise the Lord
[58:14] see so now therefore see we allowed the
[58:19] effect to tear the pieces this person
[58:22] speaks this way or as a fleshie behavior
[58:25] whatever it is see because it kills you
[58:27] see me now that's for purpose it is to
[58:30] kill you
[58:31] the die on the cross swears for amen see
[58:35] squares for and then thereafter why it
[58:39] keep all coming to keep all coming well
[58:40] it stopped doing they want to stop
[58:42] saying that there see he will keep
[58:44] sitting it until you say Lord I love my
[58:48] brother and my sister he'll keep order
[58:51] do you say that keep on doing I love you
[58:53] priest guy it's all right then he does
[58:57] it you even see it all you see Jesus on
[59:00] the cross
[59:02] amen now you're being perfected now are
[59:06] you growing up Christ all kind of things
[59:08] bother him brother branham what did he
[59:11] see brother see but he went on hey man
[59:16] praise the Lord see now see the evil in
[59:21] itself because the happenings that's not
[59:23] the trouble is what we allow it to
[59:25] because the effect on us see now every
[59:29] experience is good or evil see that's
[59:32] right
[59:32] see now fear and doubt makes it evil but
[59:38] trusts such as good pitch trusting God
[59:41] it's alright because Romain 8:28 says so
[59:44] it'll work together for me am I good
[59:46] therefore if it's evil it's gonna be for
[59:48] my good hey man hey hey man all right
[59:52] one example Calvary let's take him there
[59:58] was Jesus Christ as Savior he faced the
[1:00:01] most evil thing that could be done there
[1:00:04] right it was an outward experience that
[1:00:07] right it was Satan's scheme it was an
[1:00:10] evil thing what Christ did he waver do
[1:00:13] see he had a in what
[1:00:16] attitude of faith amen praise God see
[1:00:20] which declared that that evil was good
[1:00:24] see he rejected the temptation to call
[1:00:28] that evil evil said it's good he said
[1:00:32] because he said is not my will is his
[1:00:34] will then if it's God's book everything
[1:00:36] God does is good then right for us so
[1:00:41] therefore now watch Christ didn't it
[1:00:45] when if you read through st. John 12 13
[1:00:47] 14 all through there
[1:00:48] you don't even mention Satan Harley and
[1:00:51] st. John 14:30 he says the prince of
[1:00:54] this world cometh hath nothing there me
[1:00:56] a man oh praise God he has no claim on
[1:01:02] me no power over me
[1:01:04] all right he has nothing to do with me
[1:01:07] nothing in me the prince of this world
[1:01:12] cometh here so he spoke to his disciples
[1:01:14] with joy with love and told all these
[1:01:17] wonderful promises
[1:01:18] all right and knowing he's gonna face
[1:01:21] this evil but he turned the evil around
[1:01:25] for good who's good out good for save
[1:01:27] this hello say that evil was good
[1:01:32] because it brought us salvation so that
[1:01:36] trial suffering for Christ adversity was
[1:01:41] to our good that evil hope you get it
[1:01:43] the other star friends say Amen praise
[1:01:46] God
[1:01:47] well then there's no evil that God can't
[1:01:50] turn around make it good then rent Satan
[1:01:55] made a fierce attack on his body outside
[1:01:57] see but faith his faith make it
[1:02:01] impossible for Satan to touch inside
[1:02:04] God was in there hey the body had to go
[1:02:07] through those things there see Peter
[1:02:09] come along and said that it was God's
[1:02:10] determinate counsel
[1:02:12] beforehand his foreknowledge that this
[1:02:14] had to be she let me know now
[1:02:17] adversities and sufferings see our
[1:02:21] instruments of Satan but now watch today
[1:02:25] right now we are we understand that but
[1:02:28] if my faith
[1:02:29] we can turn it around hey men turn into
[1:02:34] blessings amen
[1:02:36] I'm trying to show you the early church
[1:02:38] I'm trying to show you brother brother
[1:02:40] and we I believe come to that point now
[1:02:45] we're facing something and we're gonna
[1:02:48] have to end that what is that's that's
[1:02:50] what it means to be fully matured and
[1:02:52] grown up to have the mind of Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ to know him to know that nothing
[1:02:58] because God said it was good everything
[1:03:02] is good see
[1:03:03] so therefore because God because God
[1:03:05] create evil to turn it back around to
[1:03:08] work for you that's his way so when you
[1:03:10] know him through knowledge didn't you
[1:03:12] understand then you don't have any
[1:03:13] qualms then see you know you understand
[1:03:16] God because you know him right now then
[1:03:20] we see that we turn it around is
[1:03:22] something to be used in in faith to turn
[1:03:26] it against Satan see now then if we have
[1:03:31] the understanding then this revelation
[1:03:34] that evil is good because of our benefit
[1:03:37] then we count a joy to pour into divers
[1:03:41] temptations we rejoice in our
[1:03:43] tribulations amen
[1:03:45] this show Gaby revelation praise the
[1:03:49] Lord Amen we use them as special
[1:03:53] opportunities to see the manifestation
[1:03:57] of God's power is only when you can
[1:04:00] become weak that he's strong it's only
[1:04:04] but you have to you have to become weak
[1:04:06] Christ had to become weak
[1:04:08] then the strength come the power of God
[1:04:10] so when we become in our we can
[1:04:12] condition can't do nothing then he shows
[1:04:14] forth his power amen
[1:04:16] and his disciples and went out trials
[1:04:19] adversities the power of God rested upon
[1:04:22] them amen see we are facing that now see
[1:04:25] now so therefore if we understand this
[1:04:28] here we face it not to merely it because
[1:04:32] endure it as a judgment or trial then
[1:04:35] it's like weary heart another
[1:04:37] trial all the help me Lord pray for my
[1:04:41] brother going through I'm going through
[1:04:44] I'm going through see me now another one
[1:04:49] the early church what it says hey God we
[1:04:53] were beaten this is the word now you
[1:04:56] want the word they read just because
[1:04:59] they was whipped
[1:05:01] they were bullwhipped amen and think of
[1:05:05] it we just in being beaten for the Lord
[1:05:08] telling it worthy I'm trying to show you
[1:05:11] that our Dane elected few who walks on
[1:05:14] that third stage oh yeah
[1:05:17] many say I am identified with you on the
[1:05:19] cross Lord then the next day something
[1:05:21] happened in the next day I'm identified
[1:05:23] you lacrosse Lord but this stage diet
[1:05:25] daily every day I live in your diet the
[1:05:30] brother brand died every day Paul every
[1:05:33] day don't early disciples you know why
[1:05:35] there's a reason for there there's a
[1:05:38] spiritual law of harvest a corner wheat
[1:05:41] must die and it brings forth 100 folk
[1:05:44] fruit that's why cinnamon now the early
[1:05:48] church which was a corner wheat had to
[1:05:50] die to bring forth us if we you see it
[1:05:52] not they had to die every day
[1:05:54] and people outside saw the life of
[1:05:56] Christ and they come to Christ see it
[1:05:59] now see so therefore that's what is
[1:06:01] going on now now their knowledge the
[1:06:04] truth will change a weak spot in our
[1:06:08] armor our fare to face trials and
[1:06:11] sufferings when the truth comes you know
[1:06:13] turn that around and you say wait a
[1:06:15] minute you mean that to know him
[1:06:18] this is the mind of Christ and this is
[1:06:20] the will of God now with the sister yes
[1:06:22] yes this is the will of God you said
[1:06:24] well wait a minute back Satan
[1:06:26] hey I'll rejoice in every trial I'll
[1:06:29] rejoice it because every judgment every
[1:06:31] test from this day on because I received
[1:06:34] the knowledge of God this morning that I
