oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he had redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south [Music] where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare of highest understanding who has laid the measures thereof if thou knowest o who has stretched the line upon it whereupon of the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy [Music] oh I've got a beautiful picture in my mind now if you could take a little trip with me and think now let's go back hundred million years before there ever was a star I mean or anything in the world now there was a time that there was nothing here just all forever eternity and all of ever and eternity Rose God he was there beginning now let's watch you're made to the Spanish er to look over and see these things happen now an old man has seen the father at any time now there's nothing and just faced in no life there's no dark there's enough it just seems nothing but in there is the great supernatural be Jehovah God who covered all those faiths of all the places at all friends he was from everlasting from everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's God can't see nothing tango nothing not a move of an atom in the air not nothing not aware no nothing but yet God was there that was gone now let's watch for a few minutes Angela nobody has seen that now that's the father that God the Father now in order then after a while I begin to see a little sacred life begin to form like a little halo or something you can only step up spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the Holy Church now we're standing on a very big fan if you're watching what God's doing now the next thing we begin to see by as of supernatural looking we see a little white lie forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers logan's are the anointed s or the anointing RV there's a little to say the the heart of God begin to develop into something so human beings as some type of an idea what it was it's a little low a little life-ruining we've ever the Word of God now God gave himself to the son which left before there was even an enemy in it to be our heir to make an end that was see Jesus at glory by me father with a girli that we had before the foundation of the in st. John when he said in the beginning was the word when the first earned the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god unfolding himself down to a human being now what I did it Jenna back to Aaron one little halo comes out we can't see nothing yet but this on as a just supernatural we see a halo saying I that's the Son of God the logos now I can see play around a child before the father's all our eternity and I then in his imaginary makeup he begin to think of what things would be like in your face left better be life [Music] [Applause] [Applause] they want to do that it added bursted in the Sun Jamie Gries listen she'll boil up hundreds of millions of years Barney twinkers burning Barney right beneath today there's Bernie Goodwin Hannah boiling like that millions of miles with these big planes of billions of Fahrenheit a key to go back soon now what hit them beautiful now he made the Sun then a first thing a little big Tweaker fell off of it weighed about just about like this earth men deployed offshore now the Son of God is watching him he likes it - like what a million years be stopped Jerry millions on us all who had sexual power for millions of years then stop now we're standing watch you come into existence now he's got something you mean siren and what's he doing he's ridin with first-timer the first Bible that many will approve of the stars the zodiac it's a perfect just the ability of this Bible here it starts also puts the zodiac is the version that runs the length of those overreacting that's the first coming of Jesus he came to a purchase of second to Tundras allow the tribe of juda right all out the Kasserine ever they down to now we thought that all in this town you place it down all these meters teaches the birds are started hanging out here now notice all these missiles hanging out there waiting outside boy how PDF what's expected and first thing it won't begin with the iceberg now that was his earth 4350 it's a big old piece of tender to all tire down beneath it now says better turning burning volcano completely erupting sucker boy Bobby knees in the beginning God created the heaven and the [Music] and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over all of it right what God did he put him in full control they could speak to the winds and it was cease to blow they would speak to the tree and it would move from here to there the lion and the wolf fed together and the lamb laid down with them there was no evil it was perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection and when God had it under his control and it noticed he had his yet his world yet all in operation he had everything coming everything eaten vegetations nothing to die nothing to be ruined nothing to be spoiled nothing it was just perfect and over it all he placed his beloved children his son and his daughter a husband and wife to control it [Music] [Music] now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and a woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God had said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die [Music] and when he went to take a little rest his enemy stepped in with the seat and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children when he put trust in his own child think he put trust in his son that he would not do anything wrong and would keep every word that he said but the enemy spit then the slip in the enemy of God slip in and misinterpreted the word to Eve now Eva this fall it has took over and processed the Garden of Eden himself something's lost burner is groaning it's trying to get back to be back to its original condition would you imagine someone falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and the struggling climbing tolling they must are some means get out of this pit they're not in the original state and frantically there's screaming they've torn the walls making a noise or there's some way there they're going the closet they want to get back to their original estate that's what a person struck with disease aches and pains one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're crawling and trying to get back to where there was where they had help and when nature and people's as the Bible said are groaning this shows our something that they're not either ought to be conditioning they are falling from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that policy but of course we know it was eternal life their fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and of all nature under them today [Music] a tree never died before then an animal would die before edit there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep firm blind we have to have eternal life in us that these sons and daughters of God but when we died as I said in the message this morning to sin we sold all her birth rights and cross this chasm now we're beyond the reach of God on this other side of the cabin the day you eat thereof that day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely supreme control of the earth he was a God of the area God's a God of the universe they were but his son had this earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say good stop nature he could do anything you want to do see but when he did that he lost his inheritance now Adam could say yeah let this mountain here being moved over there they were do it Adam Cassetti let this tree here be plucked up and plant over here it would do it for he had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our Father because he was a son of God Adam lost years inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand do the lot he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasonings there for his eternal life is right to the Tree of Life is right to the earth wrong to him and he borrowed it ever dip to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been the return that has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's your now they're polluting it your God will destroy them but the meek will inherit the earth and has been purified now Oman now the confident title deed is now in the hands of the rich owner oh my god the title deed to the earth and if you eternal life when Adam Barford it then Satan's doing hands cannot take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're gonna find it just a myth there he steps on the throne with it in his hand probably the coyote [Music] coyote eternal life with as positive for wisdom instead of faith this went back to the hands of the owner oh my god what a great scene all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of God waiting for redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption actually found he losted he had sanding it separated himself from God is on this side of Kasim so he could not redeem he just couldn't do it cuz he what you needed Redemption itself so he could not do it but the world required a kinsman redeemer the law of God required a kinsman redeemer the oil market down kinsman redeemer fine at Leviticus 25 God's law received a substitute now what if God had not offered to take a substitute but love constrained him to know it that man was an alphabet and there's no way for me to get back he was bald but the grace of God this is when redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ love required grace match requirements now notes require a kinsman redeemer and the Redeemer kinsman redeemer must be born all the human race where that leaves us only in will let me sound the trumpet Ian the virgin birth produced the product the bacon breath produced our Kuzmin not other but the all-mighty God because he manual [Music] you see how God makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then no steps in and all shadows that well it produces a part but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth [Music] when God makes a covenant with man man will break it every time he always did but God there made a coming in yourself ever said if you will a summer I will flip enmity promise new Savior between her Stephen is Satan's seed in ours look four thousand years is past and all the time a shadow of the blood through the offering of sheeps and goats and so forth which could not take away sin but just covered it up now we have bound 4000 years later let's turn our camera on this way to 4000 years later let's pull up
