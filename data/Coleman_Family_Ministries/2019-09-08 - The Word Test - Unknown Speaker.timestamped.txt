[0:00] reading from judges the seventh chapter
[0:03] then add ruble who is Gideon and all the
[0:08] people that were with him rose up early
[0:11] in pitch beside the well of hey rod so
[0:15] that the host of the Midianites were on
[0:17] the north side of them by the hill of
[0:20] Moreh in the valley and the Lord said
[0:24] unto to Gideon the people that are with
[0:26] thee are too many for me to give the
[0:29] Midianites into their hands lest Israel
[0:32] want themselves against me saying mine
[0:36] own hand have saved me now therefore go
[0:41] to proclaim in the ears of the people
[0:44] saying whoever is fearful and afraid let
[0:48] him return and depart early from Mount
[0:50] Gilead in their return of the people
[0:53] twenty and two thousand and they remain
[0:56] ten thousand and the Lord said unto
[1:00] Gideon the people are yet to many bring
[1:02] them down onto the water and I will try
[1:07] them for the air and it shall be that of
[1:11] whom I say unto thee this shall go with
[1:14] thee the same shall go with thee and of
[1:17] whomsoever I say unto thee this shall
[1:19] not go with thee the same shall not go
[1:22] so he brought down the people unto the
[1:25] water and the Lord said unto Gideon
[1:27] everyone that Lapith of the water with
[1:30] his tone as a dog Lapith him shall sit
[1:34] by himself likewise everyone that bowed
[1:38] down upon his knees to drink and the
[1:40] number of them that left putting their
[1:42] hand to their mouths were three hundred
[1:44] men but all of the rest but all the rest
[1:47] of the people bowed down upon their
[1:49] needs to drink water and the Lord said
[1:51] unto Gideon by the three hundred men
[1:53] that lamp will I save you and delivered
[1:56] a mini nice into thy hand and I let all
[1:59] the people go every man to his place so
[2:02] the people took victuals in their hand
[2:06] in their trumpets and he sent all the
[2:09] rest of his for every man to stamp and
[2:11] retain those 300 men and the wholesome
[2:14] medium was beneath him in the valley
[2:16] made a lot of a blessing to the reading
[2:19] of his word thank you so now I like the
[2:32] title this little thought the word test
[2:41] missus this morning lays in this thought
[2:45] how God prepares his people for battle
[2:50] and we read from these scriptures here
[2:56] to draw context the context of it rather
[2:59] as we read it many of us have ready four
[3:02] years and been over but I pray this
[3:05] morning that the Holy Spirit would glean
[3:08] something from here this morning praise
[3:10] the Lord to be a little gleaning in here
[3:11] somewhere and we could get a handful of
[3:13] barley this morning praise the Lord
[3:16] so now we find out this that obedience
[3:21] to his word he calls his people by
[3:25] obedience to his word he selects
[3:27] entrains his people by obedience to his
[3:30] word he separates by obedience to his
[3:33] word we fight the battles we can only
[3:35] fight by obedience to the Word of God
[3:37] and by obedience to his word we win the
[3:41] battles most important of all now judges
[3:46] 7 shows how God used the water which we
[3:52] know always types the word to test the
[3:56] people to be used to fight the battle
[3:59] now there was going to be a battle the
[4:02] many nurse was swarming all over and it
[4:05] was about their season in God he is the
[4:09] one who fights the battle
[4:10] and he had to have his people in battle
[4:13] ray according to his will and his word
[4:16] and just because you have a whole lot of
[4:18] people that doesn't mean anything see
[4:20] it's those that he has called out and
[4:22] trained him and tried them his way and
[4:25] it could be woman one can chase a
[4:29] thousand
[4:30] can you imagine what because three can
[4:32] do you can have a whole multitude if you
[4:34] have thirty thousand and twenty nine
[4:36] thousand don't believe everything so you
[4:39] still only got one so it's only in those
[4:41] who believe and obey obedience is better
[4:44] than sacrifice so now in judges seven
[4:48] here we know that we all are in battle
[4:51] see if we're being trained but the great
[4:53] battle to stand against Goliath is
[4:56] nearing and how much near is it and God
[5:00] has not called us out of the world and
[5:02] different churches just for north
[5:05] he's call us out for a specific reason
[5:09] here in the last days when we have got
[5:12] to know how to fight and that's why the
[5:15] messages to go forth all the time but
[5:18] now God shows in this chapter here how
[5:21] he calls his people regardless of what
[5:24] they think or what they feel or who do
[5:27] they think they are but this is the way
[5:30] he does it he hasn't changed so now he
[5:33] used the water to test the people to be
[5:37] used to fight the battle he used the
[5:39] water before in Noah's time if they
[5:42] would get into the ark to escape the
[5:43] water he also uses the water back in
[5:45] Moses time if they would go into the Red
[5:48] Sea according to the Word of God and
[5:50] escape because Egypt you also use the
[5:52] water right here in acts 2:38 and then
[5:55] it won't be baptized in the water just
[5:57] the Word of God
[5:57] see but here he used the water which we
[6:00] know is the type of a test now to start
[6:03] with there were 32,000 or Israelites
[6:08] these were not because unbelievers these
[6:12] were church people they were all
[6:14] supposed to be saved we are of Israel we
[6:17] have salvation we are of God but that
[6:21] was too many Oh
[6:23] God knows the hearts God has got to get
[6:26] the real believers who really believe
[6:28] just in a simple matter of brother
[6:30] Christ granddaughter bawling head and
[6:32] pray now how many people we're gonna do
[6:34] that say just believe that's all
[6:36] don't try to question them because I'll
[6:37] figure out just believe what the man of
[6:40] God is saying to you so now we find that
[6:43] there was 32,000 of them we just read
[6:46] here and it was this was a church now
[6:49] I'm typing this morning over to our day
[6:52] over here now notice he gave them not
[6:56] Gideon the Lord did he gave them the
[6:59] word test see to separate them and to
[7:03] try them now oh I want to read something
[7:06] to you here it's only one they don't
[7:09] want to read from a spoken word book
[7:10] this morning on page 10 god of this evil
[7:13] each I'm reading from a page 9 and 10
[7:18] now last week page 8 9 10 mostly on page
[7:25] 9 last week ins in Matthew 24 it was the
[7:27] most deceiving age of all ages all the
[7:30] ages of deceit from the Garden of Eden
[7:32] all the way down there's never been an
[7:34] age so deceptive as this age false
[7:38] prophets will rise and show signs and
[7:41] wonders if possible to deceive the very
[7:43] elect it sing now just a cold formal
[7:49] starchy churches and so forth or
[7:52] man-made theology that wouldn't the
[7:55] elect would never pay no attention to
[7:57] that but it's up there almost like the
[8:01] real thing just leaving out one word is
[8:05] all you have to do promise of the age to
[8:09] age see very great time Christians
[8:13] everywhere
[8:14] take heed to their hour we're living
[8:17] markdown and read and listen close what
[8:21] would God call a people out of this evil
[8:25] age for his name now here's the reason
[8:28] why are you being caught has the answer
[8:30] right here the reason is the reason it
[8:34] is is to
[8:35] try her his bride its to when she is
[8:40] made manifest been tried is proven
[8:45] proved to Satan and Satan's into false
[8:49] anointed ones trying to get her off the
[8:51] word but when she stands with the words
[8:54] she's proven to Satan who she is Annie
[8:57] and God just like Joel he lists Satan
[9:00] have his way with her
[9:01] he's past 9 he has to have your way with
[9:03] her Satan see but she won't take her
[9:06] because you're only proven her and all
[9:09] these things that happen to because come
[9:12] against it it'll just be tests that's
[9:13] all see now so um to try her when she's
[9:20] made manifest been tried is proven prove
[9:23] to Satan like it was at the beginning so
[9:26] shall it be at the end now as a seed
[9:28] starts in the ground it comes up through
[9:30] carriers the life of it but it ends up
[9:33] the same seed that it was when it went
[9:36] in the ground and the same way to see
[9:39] the deceit fell in the ground in Eden is
[9:42] the same way it ends up in the last days
[9:44] just as the gospel was when it fell to a
[9:47] denomination at Nicaea Rome it ends up
[9:50] in a super organization just as the seat
[9:52] of the church fell back there with the
[9:54] science one is in the living Christ
[9:55] among them it ends up in the last days
[9:58] under the Ministry of melikhaya for and
[10:00] restores back agenda original faith that
[10:03] was once given and may we understand
[10:05] what he's talking about the seed every
[10:09] seed that is here in the in turn was
[10:13] planted in the book of Genesis and then
[10:17] every seed of us in Genesis must be out
[10:19] on the earth now but deceive could only
[10:23] flourish and ripen in the last days when
[10:27] the book of Revelation would open up
[10:29] because that itself is the harvest and
[10:31] it would take a prophet William Branham
[10:34] Malachi 4 to open the book of Revelation
[10:36] and then when the book is opened up then
[10:38] if we are in the harvest time and then
[10:41] all the seeds that was planted in
[10:44] Genesis we with our eyes
[10:46] see these seats walking living breathing
[10:49] on the earth and that's why you people
[10:53] see these sodomites out here these
[10:55] filthy dirty low-down women with these
[10:58] ungodly clothes on you see them out here
[11:01] and these sodomite men with the hair
[11:04] down the neck look like perverts those
[11:06] would have seized that was in just as 18
[11:09] down in Sodom and you saw that it is in
[11:12] the beginning so shall it being in and
[11:15] Malachi 4 come and open up the harvest
[11:17] book every seed it was planted back
[11:21] there the life of their seed would come
[11:24] all the way down through the times all
[11:26] the way through the parameter you would
[11:28] follow the life of Cain the life of the
[11:31] son of mites you see it because as you
[11:33] read the Bible you see it here you see
[11:35] it there you see it here but in the last
[11:37] days in holidays
[11:39] we'll see it live it and breathe it in
[11:41] moving around and it's fully ripened
[11:44] fully filthy and there's nothing left
[11:46] for it but the fiery hell of God's Word
[11:49] that's all his left of it as long as
[11:51] left forward rather and then the seed of
[11:55] the believer the life of that seed which
[11:59] was the life of the early church which
[12:01] was about nineteen hundred years ago
[12:04] what was the life it was the life of
[12:07] Christ in early church that church went
[12:09] down into the ground which serves
[12:11] wonders miracles and our life of Christ
[12:14] then that seed according to the Bible
[12:16] would go through a church age seven
[12:19] church ages and it would come up in the
[12:21] book of Revelation and then no no notice
[12:24] the seed is the original length then the
[12:29] life of it goes through but when he hits
[12:32] the book of Revelation he comes back to
[12:34] see time not just the life moving
[12:38] through as a ship because it's shocking
[12:40] a bleached and so forth see that's only
[12:43] the life moving through it but in our
[12:46] day the seed that was in the beginning
[12:48] moves through the church and comes out
[12:51] as the same seed again then if it's the
[12:54] same
[12:55] the same life that was in the one in the
[12:56] beginning before this is Sita when
[13:00] everything's made manifest and if he
[13:03] planted a seat over a holy church or
[13:08] glorified Church upon earth it had to
[13:10] pass through Luther Wesley be dependent
[13:13] console age there he comes back handy in
[13:16] this is the time when we expecting to
[13:19] see the same church again because it's a
[13:21] seat time and see turn is that you could
[13:23] take the same seat and planet water it
[13:25] planet water bring forth bring forth
[13:28] bring forth the sea but you couldn't do
[13:30] that with Luther and Wesley and the
[13:32] Pentecost because it was not seed time
[13:33] it was just life moving through it did
[13:36] we get that
[13:37] praise the Lord now we find now this
[13:41] evil age is to prove to Satan she's not
[13:44] like Eve so God permitted the
[13:48] collimation of the evil age to begin
[13:51] about 1963 and all of us know that and
[13:54] all the spirits of Sodom that came up
[13:58] through the four Beatles over in England
[13:59] came out with the long hair in Elvis
[14:02] president he started himself really back
[14:04] in 1954 sold with Milton Berle become on
[14:08] television and that was a sex symbol of
[14:10] male sex symbol shaking his body and
[14:14] singing to rock and roll songs all acres
[14:16] here and how you know the stories of the
[14:18] young girls who just gave their clothes
[14:20] and ripped themselves now and run out
[14:22] for this six male symbol see it's a
[14:24] devil yeah that's the way it was in the
[14:27] beginning and it's gonna be a same way
[14:29] here in the end in that same spirit
[14:31] we're trying to move into the church and
[14:34] get up on the sisters of God and tell us
[14:38] sisters raise up your just a little bit
[14:39] make it nice and tight and also reveal
[14:42] early because you have to find a husband
[14:43] maybe
[14:43] well husbands not looking for sex Queen
[14:45] because there's many honesty there would
[14:47] far outstrip you out there he's looking
[14:50] for our daughter of God
[14:52] he's looking for a saved sanctified Holy
[14:54] Ghost a woman kneeling for sex queen so
[14:58] they need the way to do it the way I do
[15:00] is to manifest Jesus Christ phrase Oh
[15:03] God and then in such a daze is here the
[15:06] great intellectual age would move in
[15:09] against a ministry through popularity
[15:11] morning and women and try to destroy the
[15:15] ministry and I will tell my wife this
[15:18] morning are totally yes they are said
[15:20] Elena
[15:21] think we would be insane if I didn't see
[15:24] one man living here in the end time
[15:26] William Brennan if I didn't see a life
[15:28] and hurt a man stand on the Word of God
[15:32] with principle and stand for it all the
[15:36] days of his life in the ministry and
[15:38] because as a Christian I think we would
[15:41] have nothing there the foundation would
[15:42] be destroyed and there would be no hope
[15:45] but we saw such a one God sent him
[15:50] Meraki for and you know I can have
[15:53] confidence because he tied the people of
[15:57] God and he brought them under the
[16:00] condition of the Word of God in every
[16:03] man is a follow regardless of mother
[16:05] father sister brother affiliations of
[16:08] whoever they are cause no respect of
[16:10] persons is to bring those people on the
[16:13] conditions of the I should be able to
[16:31] you know after all because you have if
[16:53] you stand stand with the sword join you
[17:22] get so sick you see wishy-washy and
[17:25] china reason out well maybe this is
[17:27] because this maybe not there's unbelief
[17:29] stay on the Word of God God and spoke it
[17:32] so shall it be praise God we find out on
[17:37] this evil age is to prove to Satan she's
[17:40] not like Eve she is not that type of a
[17:43] woman and the carnot because he caught
[17:47] Eve and told her you'd like to be wise
[17:49] know how to bring life through sex and
[17:53] Eve tasted it was good and so is it
[17:56] today you knows how sex is tied into
[17:58] education town right together they go
[18:01] hand in hand the coeds know you know
[18:03] what's happening you know the
[18:04] dormitories the Soph was tied together
[18:06] you see now she will be tried by his

[21:09] [Music]
[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] but you promise for about ten years now
[21:37] in 1863 1970 was about ten years of us
[21:40] amen and I'm reminded that when a larger
[21:44] first marry Deacon Alicia and he saw him
[21:47] and he threw Lula goes over him after
[21:53] she tasted of the baptism of the Holy
[21:56] Ghost rather he went betting sacrifice
[21:59] with his parents and he fathered a
[22:00] larger and allowed as that gold back
[22:02] into your church whatever I had to do a
[22:05] pave has a Lord God live and will follow
[22:07] you and then they say what Bob Arum say
[22:09] go back see go back if you saw Dana go
[22:13] back but brother at that after they were
[22:15] swept over you you can never go back you
[22:17] can
[22:19] preyus car they said well he said
[22:21] looking for Eddie trees until he said go
[22:23] back so Oscar I've got out here and get
[22:25] some souls that's a lie of the devil
[22:28] you'll get nothing out there but sin and
[22:31] temptation all the days of your life
[22:33] praise God and he lies you come on down
[22:36] we all pass Gilgal Beth Ellen and
[22:39] Jericho the sons of the Prophet they're
[22:43] [Music]
[22:54] [Music]
[23:11] [Music]
[23:18] in
[23:23] he had
[23:35] [Music]
[23:45] I sure was ready here I sure was right
[23:49] he was tried tempted tested and he was
[23:54] ready to receive the full of the Spirit
[24:03] of God but if you go there still looking
[24:39] like the school of the process perhaps
[24:42] it over on the mountain over there or
[24:43] he's over here but he larger one chef
[24:46] saw Elijah go and he knew he well then
[24:49] if you know if he left he said that he
[24:51] that believeth in me though works that I
[24:54] do shall he do also because he's seen
[24:57] him go
[24:57] and they Jesus Christ his disciples saw
[25:00] him go up and a new way is pulled to
[25:02] fall upon him unless you had that
[25:05] conviction unless you really believe
[25:07] nothing fall upon you well a lot of
[25:10] confusion and he kept his eye on the
[25:12] promise now he had tasted of the robe he
[25:17] grew into the robe he wrapped a rolled
[25:20] the promises of it the Holy Ghost is
[25:23] here he wrapped it all around him but
[25:25] that still wasn't enough
[25:26] we are wrapped in virtue in patience in
[25:31] umbrella kindness godliness
[25:34] we have wrapped ourselves in this
[25:35] message which is the role his message
[25:38] was the Holy Ghost and you wrapped in it
[25:41] the sentence and that's what is true
[25:42] enough for he was coming
[25:45] new water again coming down for the test
[25:49] can you pass over and tell her the order
[25:51] was a school of the prophets they was
[25:54] all waiting to see what the critics were
[25:57] down there in every picture must pass
[26:01] through the whole of the critics and you
[26:04] afraid to be criticized you're free for
[26:07] the person to come and show you an area
[26:09] of length that needs to be straightened
[26:11] out in your life are you afraid to be
[26:13] criticized by the pastor or do you run
[26:16] all up like a devil when the word comes
[26:19] and corrects and rebukes your spirit Oh
[26:22] amen so do you rile up and try to come
[26:26] back around to prove yourself up cause
[26:28] you won't throughout the word you want
[26:29] to try to it could prove the flesh out
[26:31] and say well see our dentist because or
[26:34] do you say this Lord wash me all over
[26:37] with the word this poor old might hit
[26:39] everywhere is that the way we are see
[26:42] when you come on down to the river what
[26:46] he needed
[26:46] he had the mechanical word with him but
[26:52] what he needed was a god of that
[26:54] mechanical word the god of Elijah and he
[26:58] cried all where is about of Elisha where
[27:01] is he he knew it was the season was a
[27:03] time we might cry out today where is a
[27:05] Dynamics the god of Elisha where's he at
[27:08] and he took up that he smote the waters
[27:11] and the critics saw the same power the
[27:16] same spirit upon a life shot that they
[27:18] saw only Elijah and they bowed down to
[27:21] Elisha for they saw it may God grant it
[27:25] to his bride in the end time
[27:26] praise our God now we find the ages to
[27:30] prove or we feel on she fell on one
[27:33] promise under the temptation of the
[27:34] enemy but fail one prominent tradition
[27:37] enemy face-to-face and now the people
[27:39] has called for his name that's us
[27:41] of course is his bride she is to come
[27:44] into contact again by the same thing not
[27:47] just a nomination of truth or something
[27:49] but every word for in the beginning of
[27:53] the Bible man was
[27:55] the Word of God to live by one word
[27:58] misinterpreted by a man I said one word
[28:03] Miss interpreted by a man now you think
[28:07] on that you think on one promise lately
[28:12] or any time now you not know think all
[28:18] one word misinterpreted maybe not on
[28:22] purpose but just to understand it but it
[28:25] still misinterpreted it by minister or
[28:28] by a man of our woman one word and you
[28:32] let that sperm that thinking lay in here
[28:35] where you at this every word word by
[28:40] word hair little and a little but the
[28:42] Word of God if you're running through
[28:44] the word you don't understand it don't
[28:46] get all excited way over here somewhere
[28:48] he'll give understanding it's all his
[28:51] laces right on through the Bible
[28:52] don't ever get shook up see now flow in
[28:56] the beginning man was given the Word of
[28:57] God to live by one word I misinterpreted
[29:00] by a man called Satan and a person of an
[29:03] animal called a serpent Satan and the
[29:05] person could talk to Eve in this person
[29:09] rather and misinterpreted the word to
[29:11] her and was lost see it must be every
[29:13] word in the middle the Bible Jesus came
[29:16] and said man shall not live by bread
[29:17] alone but by every word and when he was
[29:19] tempted by Satan el-din time God telling
[29:23] us here in the last days that the god of
[29:26] this world will rise up in the last days
[29:28] and whosoever shall add one word to it
[29:30] or take one word from it
[29:31] his part shall be taken from the book of
[29:34] life god be merciful to us let us not
[29:36] walk as stiff shirts chest stuck out
[29:39] head up know-it-all for we to one turn
[29:43] were in disobedience
[29:44] let us with grace and mercy and feeling
[29:47] in our hearts toward god homely come to
[29:49] the throne of grace brother if the
[29:51] people in this message could get this
[29:54] revelation and you wouldn't see you see
[29:57] God moving in our myths but they're so
[29:59] hard on one another you
[30:01] you did this and you did that that's
[30:03] legalism what did you do the same day
[30:06] the least thing that you have done is
[30:10] measured against the worst thing that
[30:12] you're the brother or sister has done
[30:14] and there are both cleansed by the blood
[30:16] now think on that and the least slow
[30:22] tiny thing that you can do the blood
[30:24] cleanses both of them now where do you
[30:26] get off trying to condemn somebody and
[30:29] also prejudge that person with a
[30:31] legalistic spirit and that's the spirit
[30:35] that's moving in this message here
[30:37] and that's the spirit that God can't
[30:39] move in just moving around in the
[30:41] message it takes in the message when I
[30:53] believe me because I'm supposed to be
[31:16] here in the church rather and yet he
[31:42] lost the whole thing then he might know
[31:45] who Christ praise God that's what
[31:48] brother Brad tell us he knew that the
[31:49] relational would come and we would be on
[31:52] top our families and the others because
[31:55] of Christians and different churches and
[31:57] whatnot we'd be stiff shirts you and a
[31:58] message you know all is a stiff us a
[32:02] stiff sharing see chest stuck out head
[32:05] up know everything because they got the
[32:07] tapes in the book see now the word tests
[32:10] God
[32:11] promised melikhaya for to come and he
[32:15] was to come to turn the hearts of the
[32:17] children from error searing
[32:20] unfaithfulness and lead them back into
[32:23] harmony with the fathers who Zaphod as
[32:26] the prophets and the old patriarchs lead
[32:29] our hearts there were over here in error
[32:32] with the traditions of the elders and
[32:34] manmade churches and whatnot and think
[32:37] we serving God and his people are
[32:40] destroyed by a lack of knowledge but
[32:43] Malachi 4 would come in mercy in God's
[32:46] love and leaders as children from error
[32:49] from sin from unfaithfulness and put us
[32:53] back in harmony with the fathers who
[32:57] wrote the word Amen brother basically an
[33:00] orchestra everything must be in harmony
[33:02] amen the one who's leading it every
[33:06] instrument the bear I mean the droves
[33:08] that everything gotta be in harmony they
[33:10] got to be in the spirit of the
[33:12] scoresheet there and that's what he's
[33:14] been trying to get us to do to get every
[33:16] woman man child in harmony with the word

[34:26] supernatural he knew that this was the
[34:28] same God who woke up the rich see this

[34:32] through the wilderness the same God it

[35:42] going back return back he began the
[35:44] pressure he brought a wonderful edifying
[35:46] message and they showered the praise God
[35:49] but his message he was let him if you're
[35:52] afraid God is with us and no doubt he
[35:55] spoke about how God was with Abraham and
[35:57] Moses
[36:01] [Music]
[36:19] [Music]
[36:29] praise God and he's 20 pounds set right
[36:34] there
[36:36] Gideon say my god I have rehearsed the
[36:39] promises over and over nine years then
[36:41] they just still sitting there same right
[36:43] see them you know so no doubt he would
[36:46] have said do only 20 the eighth verse 20
[36:50] chap is a law of warfare and officers
[36:54] shall speak further unto the people and
[36:56] they shall see what man is there that is
[36:59] fearful and feedwater let him go and
[37:01] return to his home this his brothers
[37:03] heart faint as well as his heart know
[37:07] how God must get them separate
[37:15] [Music]
[37:26] from the mythical Christian Assembly you
[37:34] see tears of joy streaming down her
[37:36] cheeks amazing do you long for the sin
[37:45] like Ezekiel 9 nations of the rest of
[37:56] the world we have in us praise God but
[38:01] getting him here
[38:02] cause his priests awaited him getting on
[38:04] and he preached exactly Deuteronomy 28
[38:07] he said all that a faint-hearted all
[38:10] that a frightened oh my god he says this
[38:18] is a sword that vesture and it fell into
[38:25] his hand and he watched out in 19 March
[38:28] 1963 praise our God and conquered every
[38:32] demon out here every denomination he was
[38:35] a Jericho and away and then he looked up
[38:42] he saw a vision and he was put up on the
[38:44] right horse and he rode West but we got
[38:47] a promise she'll turn at the rest she'll
[38:50] ride back on the white horse same white
[38:52] horse brother amen how the how he
[38:56] rehearsed how brother Graham going back
[38:58] in 1946 like getting on here the
[39:02] Midianites World War 2 was over and he
[39:05] had conquered everything they would lead
[39:06] all over the world was leave me in 1946
[39:09] baron nothing God was even though
[39:12] because we're going to feel out there in
[39:13] 1946 dr. Charles price had died any
[39:17] simple next person had died that last
[39:19] thought the red hot because women
[39:21] preachers all that learn that comes down
[39:23] from way back in and because Genesis
[39:26] burgers have fouled up men and women
[39:28] preachers it's a certain line of
[39:30] they come down from the seed in Genesis
[39:33] and they come all the way out though God
[39:35] I understand that not speak against a
[39:37] woman but her her ministers some men
[39:40] bring out this drunken woman would bring
[39:42] her out of the wings you'd be drunk as a
[39:44] hoot owl and get her out there with her
[39:46] wings on in her white because beautiful
[39:48] dresses stand her up there and she
[39:49] stagger up then up in the pulpit
[39:51] thousands of people out there and that
[39:53] anointing of God will fall upon her and
[39:55] she would call them sinners to repent
[39:58] with a greatest gift out there praise
[40:00] God and God would bless it and they
[40:03] rejoiced in that they took a prophet to
[40:05] straighten that mess out for a saccade
[40:07] and they still believed in it
[40:08] amen thank God for the word of God now
[40:13] as I was typing here Gideon preached a
[40:16] wonderful message - and he went back to
[40:19] Deuteronomy 20 capita eighth verse and
[40:22] preached it to them and then 22,000
[40:25] faint hearted they saw no part of that
[40:29] and they went on back there left ten
[40:31] thousand and how are we know how a
[40:33] brother branham in his first and second
[40:36] pull pull the sword out he said himself
[40:38] at first message after the ancient law
[40:40] because visited him God told that he
[40:42] would go and pray before kings and
[40:44] whatnot and so forth and he said but the
[40:46] medicines they won't believe me he says
[40:49] that is the reason why I'm sending you
[40:51] because the ministers is the ones who
[40:54] didn't believe your Lord the Pharisees
[40:56] and neither will they believe you
[40:59] so with that revelation that the
[41:02] ministers would never receive him he
[41:05] pulled a sword out and with that same
[41:08] revelation today we stay in here
[41:10] [Music]
[41:16] neither will oblivion by whose trellis
[41:19] painful righteousness will not believe
[41:30] you yes it will brother so he pushed
[41:32] that way he's in the message the age of
[41:35] the myth autumn Sh which one there's a
[41:38] word brother praise God that the mayor
[41:41] of God is to bring the people under the
[41:42] condition of the word your condition is
[41:50] you come to the word I say your heart
[41:53] you're tough know me I'm so you know I
[41:57] wasn't giddy on he told get here on the
[41:59] preach dead give it anything do you you
[42:05] fight God cuz I mean this man back here
[42:08] in acts he knew that was his name a
[42:11] chameleon somebody the Camille when they
[42:14] when that the the Apostles was belching
[42:16] out the world God is stirred up the
[42:18] Pharisees and whatnot over there
[42:19] the ministers came against because he
[42:21] passes to all right and they want to
[42:23] beat him and everything he's gonna meet
[42:26] hallelu wisdom he said it would be
[42:28] careful now there's God the fighting
[42:31] against God just not a god it'll come to
[42:34] know it
[42:35] be careful today if it's go ahead you
[42:38] fighting against gun and if it's not God
[42:41] here today or anywhere it'll come to
[42:43] North but if it is gone believe it and
[42:47] March with it and support it but your
[42:50] prayers and your faith what a little
[42:53] faith you got put into it amen
[42:56] so got a banner Paul sword out and he
[42:59] said the mess and I believe you see he
[43:03] said but if you can get the people if
[43:04] you can get the people to believe not
[43:06] even cancer will stand in your way
[43:08] the people to believe bypass their
[43:10] ministers preach the word and get to the
[43:13] people cuz I got some seeds out there
[43:15] and they want to believe so rehabs
[43:17] aren't didn't believe it
[43:18] in regards what the the whole pulpit
[43:21] Association said because HIPAA hernia
[43:22] they have really Hotel pick up like week
[43:25] hotel trained here you go into you know
[43:29] C so therefore brother branham Poulos
[43:32] Ord 1946 he wasn't premiered not being
[43:36] aware but he pulled a sword and he
[43:38] preached a message about David facing
[43:40] Goliath and that great big giant of
[43:44] cancer in sickness the plagues after
[43:47] World War two stood over the entire
[43:49] world the world was it was so down with
[43:52] sickness and death and everything else
[43:54] but a little profit three is God who
[43:57] believed that angel I was sent to him
[43:59] the Word of God and he pulled his sword
[44:03] and he went march down and began to chop
[44:06] at that jurian and all the little
[44:10] David's ministers they caught faith and
[44:13] they pulled their swords on and brother
[44:15] are here revival swept over and it's
[44:18] still going on now
[44:19] it's just the fruits of is still here
[44:22] from what william branham started
[44:23] himself back in 46 well how much more is
[44:28] just a pool that was his first and
[44:30] second pool now I notice from Gideon's
[44:33] first the second pool twenty ten
[44:35] thousand left see he pulled the word out
[44:39] and we had brought up reached away and
[44:41] his first and second pool but it was
[44:44] twenty two thousand giving us time how
[44:46] many thousands and thousands was in the
[44:49] Korean Braves time depending constants
[44:51] and nominal Christians from 46 through
[44:55] 63 who left while they're tired riding
[44:58] with the 22,000 that left getting on
[45:02] Perez God let's think no no all right
[45:05] now we come down to Gideon third pool
[45:08] here we are
[45:10] praise God

[46:32] still raising a dead this morning I
[46:33] believe that God touched little law

[49:29] now there were still too many followed a
[49:32] message and even there was many fallen

[49:37] thing they was bringing church order and
[49:39] many left
[49:40] welcome to hell amen they began to bring
[49:44] the fact that the son of man in heaven
[49:46] was on earth in him and yet he was still
[49:49] in heaven and you can get that one then
[49:52] I said what is or you God or you this
[49:55] son of man or son of man they all
[49:57] confused but the son of man which is in
[49:59] here but is also a mean he did the works

[50:23] of bread everything I didn't marry my
[50:27] revival they they gave it up twelve
[50:28] baskets two passes doctor and scooped it

[55:32] we're told watch him
[55:34] Gideon had a gauge he had two things to
[55:37] us those who had left him like a dog and
[55:40] those who was bowing down we have one
[55:42] thing to watch the life so ok with a
[55:47] drink of water but what is the life

[56:59] out of the water but we only commanded
[57:08] to watch them how you drinking water and
[57:11] that's all I'll see but the waters
[57:14] they're me now and God said and
[57:18] that all 10,000 break the water but it's
[57:20] not it's really what I say I will choose
[57:24] see now or giddy I had to wait until
[57:29] 10,000 men drank the water could have
[57:33] taken seven years I don't know but he
[57:37] had to win to the Lance one taste of
[57:40] that water and we can send this year

[58:11] ahead to wait until the layers hold rate
[58:13] the router could take you seven years I
[58:16] don't know but the separation notice
[58:19] came all they drink
[58:23] and not that they believe the water
[58:25] because they drank it but how they drank
[58:28] it and so does it come today on how you
[58:31] live in what kind of life are you living
[58:33] not not because you're in the mess you
[58:35] got the tapes in the books but what kind
[58:37] of life is your life measured upward so
[58:43] the separation came that's the way it
[58:45] came in order to separate them Gideon
[58:47] had to watch each one to fire how they
[58:51] drape that water head stand there it
[58:54] stands posed by I praise God
[58:59] today the shippers are watching on their
[59:02] pulse
[59:03] how are you drape the order not the fact
[59:06] that you drinking the water we're
[59:09] watching how you're drinking water and
[59:11] so when you come har as your spirit when
[59:13] we come to you with different things and
[59:15] so forth that's how you drink the water
[59:16] whether you recoil and rise up and get
[59:19] mad and what not or if something is
[59:21] spoken to you you try to come back
[59:23] around maybe two weeks later and throw
[59:26] out something we catch them all some do
[59:29] that take them in the back and then next
[59:31] thing I call you up on the phone and
[59:32] they still don't believe you come back
[59:34] around this way see
[59:35] well see is how you drink the water now
[59:38] not the fact that you're drinking to
[59:40] order but how are you doing it and I'll
[59:43] gauges delightfully now God gave them
[59:47] two tests gonna know who he would choose
[59:51] for the third poll battle Gideon didn't
[59:55] know cuz he the Lord had not revealed to
[59:57] him yet that those who happen is the
[1:00:00] ones or those was bound he didn't know
[1:00:02] which which was which God just said to
[1:00:05] watch who's bowing and watch was rapping
[1:00:08] but God never told that the leprous as
[1:00:11] the ones because you want to use
[1:00:16] let's put through it we're just gaming
[1:00:18] us out the card of the word here now
[1:00:19] amen so Gideon was a faithful servant
[1:00:22] still in his pulse my taking about nine
[1:00:25] years he's still handsome nobody look
[1:00:33] cuz god he take it in when the town
[1:00:35] comes here separate him before we can
[1:00:37] get our blessing he has to so now made
[1:00:42] go deep this morning know who he would
[1:00:47] choose for the third pool lovely
[1:00:49] beautiful bride that has been a version
[1:00:52] of the word God alone oh now it was he
[1:00:59] was to choose 300 men and put him into
[1:01:02] three companies each man was to have a
[1:01:05] trumpet in his hand each one all of all
[1:01:09] the 300 had to have a trumpet the bride
[1:01:12] everyone had the word law to trumpet to
[1:01:14] blow to the gospel trumpet out there in
[1:01:17] the left hand they had to have an empty
[1:01:19] picture they all emptied out nothing's
[1:01:23] picture at all just as clean as a
[1:01:25] whistle and then in his empty picture no
[1:01:30] self left died out ripen maturity ready
[1:01:33] he drops a lamp in there amen and the
[1:01:38] lamp is hid in the empty picture and
[1:01:40] when they surround the Midianites all
[1:01:42] those Devils over there up on the hills
[1:01:43] and so forth when the battle starts
[1:01:45] break the pictures dear because because
[1:01:49] pitches rather and the life come the
[1:01:51] light comes out the lamb it is burning
[1:01:53] bright then before it's hid like now is
[1:01:56] here right now saying but when our comes
[1:01:59] he tells you break it and when you break
[1:02:02] the pictures the lamp shines out bright
[1:02:04] and it's around the enemy praise God
[1:02:08] one more taste a thousand now there's
[1:02:10] 300 of them praise God and in the right
[1:02:15] hand the trumpet the gospel trumpet the
[1:02:18] same message that the Prophet preached
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:21] praise God
[1:02:22] then they they came in the beginning of
[1:02:24] the middle of lunch and the Prophet said
[1:02:26] that there are three watches it because
[1:02:28] the Old Testament nine to twelve twelve
[1:02:30] to three and three to six and they came
[1:02:32] at the beginning of twelve O'Clock go
[1:02:34] out to meet the bridegroom at the
[1:02:37] midnight hour and he came out in night
[1:02:39] time they blew the trumpets the word the
[1:02:42] gospel they broke the pitchers amen in
[1:02:47] the lamp shined praise God
[1:02:49] and then they cried they shouted they
[1:02:54] cried out and he shouted the soul the
[1:02:57] Lord and all vide on the soul of the
[1:03:01] Lord and of Gideon and the Bible tells
[1:03:04] us that the Spirit of the bride says
[1:03:05] come the spirit and the bride will shout
[1:03:08] sparing the bride will have the light
[1:03:10] burning and a chump in her hand
[1:03:12] blowing out their course God saying what
[1:03:15] the prophets said same anointing same
[1:03:18] spirit the 300 blew the trumpet let the
[1:03:22] lamps and put the enemy to flight God
[1:03:24] had separated to ten thousand himself
[1:03:27] Gideon was only to notice how they drank
[1:03:31] the water I'm finished now
[1:03:33] today we shepherds ought to notice how
[1:03:35] you drink whether your left me like a
[1:03:37] dog I call it living a life whether you
[1:03:41] bow down on pick on your knees and
[1:03:44] taking what you want
[1:03:45] that's bowing down see that's no life
[1:03:47] they are seen now judges seven seven and
[1:03:50] finish and the law Siddhanta get on by
[1:03:54] the three hundred men that left there
[1:03:57] was the revelation they came in touch of
[1:03:59] seven seven by the three hundred men
[1:04:01] here and didn't know which was which it
[1:04:04] that God had to reveal to him that it
[1:04:07] was the water lepers
[1:04:08] but kion kept account see he said by the
[1:04:13] three hundred men that left will I save
[1:04:15] you and delivered the admittance into
[1:04:17] that hand and then all that all the
[1:04:19] people go every man unto his place and
[1:04:22] they were his friends
[1:04:23] so therefore God had separated them
[1:04:27] according to his word for he's the one
[1:04:29] who said it he's one that told Gideon to
[1:04:32] preach it
[1:04:33] and what to do in to watch and so forth
[1:04:35] and therefore he had to come here in the
[1:04:38] seventh verse and reveal to getting on
[1:04:40] give him the revelation of who was who
[1:04:45] according to the word who was who see it
[1:04:50] did God separate day 10,000 and of
[1:04:53] course the breakdown was in Gideon's
[1:04:55] first and second for 22,000 left his
[1:04:57] third Paul 9700 left and I left 300
[1:05:01] there and how we can bring it over here
[1:05:03] today and see the multitudes that have
[1:05:06] left and how many do we have of the
[1:05:08] bride even among those that are drinking
[1:05:11] the water in the message now this is a
[1:05:14] hard message to bring I know that but
[1:05:16] it's got to come it is the word because
[1:05:19] even harder this was coming say and this
[1:05:22] is sent to make us all be serious and
[1:05:25] measure up our lives to the Word of God
[1:05:26] that God might bring that blessing he's
[1:05:29] gonna bring it
[1:05:32] 9700 and his third pool drank water also
[1:05:35] but the camp want to short in though
[1:05:38] they were drinking see beloved our short
[1:05:42] how are you drinking the water this
[1:05:45] morning are you lapping the water like a
[1:05:47] dog why are you bowing down on your
[1:05:50] knees remember the land for six years
[1:05:54] Joshu eight in them if they went through
[1:05:56] the land the land is the promise of the
[1:05:59] Holy Ghost a type they went through six
[1:06:01] years in the land taken parcel by parcel
[1:06:06] and on six years we've been since 6672
[1:06:10] six years taking the land the Holy
[1:06:13] Spirit parcel by parcel add to your
[1:06:16] faith virtue add to your virtue of
[1:06:18] patience a parcel another possible
[1:06:20] another possible know the parcel parcel
[1:06:22] by parcel during those six years but
[1:06:25] around about the seventh year so what
[1:06:27] the time around in there somewhere
[1:06:30] they were given over land and told their
[1:06:34] full possession they were adopted and
[1:06:36] placed into their positions and
[1:06:38] therefore we are looking for charity to
[1:06:41] set us into opposition all of it that
[1:06:44] God has promised
[1:06:45] so therefore we want to know though see
[1:06:47] how are you drinking the water the
[1:06:51] restitution work started by larger we
[1:06:55] come forth to bring back the original
[1:06:58] faith the twelve stones together and all
[1:07:02] it was all done and fixed up because
[1:07:04] according to the Word of God the water
[1:07:06] everything all put around it and the
[1:07:08] fire fell and licked up the water and
[1:07:09] consumer sacrifice and so forth and then
[1:07:11] he brought on the latter rain that was
[1:07:13] the restoration work for the the land
[1:07:15] had laid barren and no water and whatnot
[1:07:17] in famine and so forth for about three
[1:07:19] and a half years or so he restored it
[1:07:21] all back praise God but it was finished
[1:07:24] up under Elisha and in Elisha under the
[1:07:29] double portion of the Holy Spirit typed
[1:07:31] out the bride in Christ Elijah and his
[1:07:33] bride carrying on the restitution work
[1:07:36] in the power of a glorified church the
[1:07:40] first thing he did when he come back
[1:07:41] with despair of God upon him he came to
[1:07:44] to Jericho and the sons of the Prophet
[1:07:47] they were there the land was nice the
[1:07:51] same because they were in it was nice
[1:07:53] city they had nice homes and so forth
[1:07:55] good jobs and you know and they had the
[1:07:58] tape recorders and whatnot in fine
[1:08:00] little groups and so forth said what the
[1:08:03] water is making everything barren here
[1:08:05] you see so the first thing that because
[1:08:09] Elisha did but the dull pushing the
[1:08:10] Spirit was healed the water at the
[1:08:13] spring in other words he had to bring a
[1:08:16] clearer understanding of what because
[1:08:20] the Elijah said and therefore in healing
[1:08:23] the water at the spring because they had
[1:08:25] thrown all kind of things in there what
[1:08:27] kind of funny are ideas in the message
[1:08:28] and people didn't know what they were
[1:08:30] drinking and it wasn't really ripening
[1:08:33] and maturing right because it was the GU
[1:08:35] haras all the ones that do this here to
[1:08:37] this here in water it was the same water
[1:08:39] from this way down into it because
[1:08:42] artesian well but they through all kind
[1:08:44] of muck and mire in there and you
[1:08:45] couldn't drink it so therefore the first
[1:08:48] thing you lashed it bring me a cruse
[1:08:49] some salt in it purifying
[1:08:52] and threw it in there and heal it at the
[1:08:55] spring and then they drink that was the
[1:08:57] first thing you did after he smoked
[1:08:59] divorce praise out God therefore did the
[1:09:03] water of chocolates the malecon for
[1:09:05] untappd that well it was supposed to be
[1:09:07] flowing pure and in the message they
[1:09:10] have got all messed up so he lies to
[1:09:12] come on the scene and made our a clear
[1:09:15] understanding what he had saying and who
[1:09:18] was that but divorce is a resurrection
[1:09:19] speak out what is clear no man knows
[1:09:22] little cept he interpreted himself and
[1:09:24] he's got to say what he says because
[1:09:26] through His Prophet and what's in the
[1:09:27] Bible amen and water truth with no more
[1:09:31] Aaron it's no error in the Bible at all
[1:09:33] but what we take our only because
[1:09:35] interpretation of the word makes the
[1:09:36] error see but if we take it away he said
[1:09:39] it and let God reveal it oh and we're
[1:09:41] drinking the same water amen see now it
[1:09:44] was he liked this very same spring the
[1:09:47] poor he went to this poor woman she
[1:09:49] wasn't dead a widowed woman and she had
[1:09:52] a husband he was the son of a prophet
[1:09:53] he'd have much much revelation and so
[1:09:55] forth he died out and so forth but she
[1:09:58] was a widow woman and her sons and
[1:10:00] therefore so he gave her the world war
[1:10:01] he always spoke the word because Lysa
[1:10:03] what he spoke it came to pass
[1:10:06] he told took one bought pots and so
[1:10:09] forth and bringing in there shut the
[1:10:11] doors and so forth going in begin to
[1:10:13] pray and believe God you know it had a
[1:10:15] nice little revival and therefore she
[1:10:18] was poor in spirit and she had a heavy
[1:10:20] spirit upon him just like now and he a
[1:10:23] fill up her plants with the oil of joy
[1:10:26] and then all of a sudden all the flowed
[1:10:29] and cancer all her debts all her own
[1:10:32] belief had just cancelled all out and
[1:10:35] then she stood before the Lord redeemed
[1:10:36] and pure no one belief and no doubts no
[1:10:40] debts and whatnot and scared of this kid
[1:10:42] this here because man looking for this
[1:10:44] over here so for the devil overhead
[1:10:45] because he has got you know where he
[1:10:47] hasn't got one because then against you
[1:10:50] praise God
[1:10:53] well praise our God in the family
[1:10:56] multiplied to bread the corn and he put
[1:11:00] the meal in the pot you who round down
[1:11:02] through his restoration work but it's
[1:11:04] all there and even one time his servant
[1:11:07] was with him and he was getting ready to
[1:11:09] fight and he was afraid the servant was
[1:11:11] afraid and he cried out Elisha I
[1:11:15] overcome the power of God was there he
[1:11:17] knew who he was what are you afraid of
[1:11:19] he said Lord open up his eyes to see
[1:11:22] what's up here who's with us now and the
[1:11:24] Lord opened up his servants eyes in the
[1:11:26] mountains with full of horses and
[1:11:28] chariots of fire all round about a
[1:11:31] weight and fought Goliath to make his
[1:11:33] move brother watch that third pole then
[1:11:37] praise the name of our God so therefore
[1:11:40] he was ready before the great event
[1:11:43] there was nothing to be afraid of they
[1:11:45] had gone through the water tests drank
[1:11:47] the water lapped it like a dog the only
[1:11:50] fell down in the water they got up Jesus
[1:11:52] because he forgave him but it was their
[1:11:53] attitude in the heart that's the thing
[1:11:56] you watch it's that attitude what kind
[1:11:58] of attitude are you a a critical spirit
[1:12:02] or judging this one and clamp it down
[1:12:04] here be careful take us you fall see for
[1:12:08] the same God will judge you the same way
[1:12:09] with other other words the worst have
[1:12:11] with judgment you give out you get it
[1:12:14] back the same judgment so you'd have to
[1:12:16] give to give our love you get back love
[1:12:18] same so like I think some of my brother
[1:12:21] Brown yesterday when you send up a
[1:12:22] cursing and the other man send up a
[1:12:24] blessing for you to weigh over the other
[1:12:26] country somewhere it meets up in heaven
[1:12:29] and God sends the accursed him back up
[1:12:32] on you and the blessing goes back up on
[1:12:33] the other one pray for one another
[1:12:38] praise God well praise God be ready for
[1:12:45] the great event for the great test
[1:12:48] friends because are you lapping the

[1:13:51] Heavenly Father bringing this message
[1:13:53] this morning God
[1:13:55] lain upon my heart last night father
[1:13:59] pray dear God that you give them
[1:14:03] understanding of what was spoken here
[1:14:05] this morning and dear God I pray that
[1:14:10] everyone in here is a Laurel Emperor
[1:14:12] maybe there might be somebody here don't
[1:14:14] understand what I'm even talking about
[1:14:16] and I want to become the size or go
[1:14:19] outside and say something maybe even
[1:14:20] next week
[1:14:21] be careful father I would say to them
[1:14:23] for the hour is short anytime
[1:14:26] you are ready to come forth you ever
[1:14:29] gave a parable that your presence would
[1:14:32] be here and one of the servants would
[1:14:35] begin to beat him and because those who
[1:14:38] would say that you have come and the
[1:14:40] others would say well you're here but
[1:14:42] you got to come over in the rest in a
[1:14:43] tent all this so that whatever it is and
[1:14:45] then showing it but they would come
[1:14:47] against those who would say it new or
[1:14:49] here now this morning and they will come
[1:14:52] against that is smite Lord God I pray
[1:14:55] that there would be no spirits like it
[1:14:57] in here and follow me you sanctify and
[1:15:00] wash it out Lord from our presence here
[1:15:03] and pray dear God that everyone in here
[1:15:06] would have the right spirit Lord and be
[1:15:10] able to take a hold of the word of God
[1:15:12] and move right on down to the end before
[1:15:15] we feel Lord that thou are ready soon to
[1:15:18] take us up on that mountain
[1:15:19] Transfiguration and adopt of people some
[1:15:22] water lepers it won't be many but
[1:15:24] they'll be there your prophet he
[1:15:26] promised it the Word of God and I pray
[1:15:29] God everyone in here will be among that
[1:15:31] number and how we try to show this
[1:15:34] morning bringing right on down trying to
[1:15:35] make it plain to the people Lord God may
[1:15:38] they pull this swords in here and
[1:15:39] rededicate their lives and purpose in
[1:15:41] their hearts and keep their eye on the
[1:15:43] promise if they don't have the baptism
[1:15:45] God may delay before you day and night
[1:15:47] and just made it they keep their spirits
[1:15:49] right Lord then your spirits and made it
[1:15:52] keep a safety finding the word because
[1:15:54] Peter them did and therefore they can do
[1:15:56] the same and so father without the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost
[1:15:59] because Peter were on one Accord and a
[1:16:03] one man without the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] then the Holy Ghost calm and if they
[1:16:07] don't have the Holy Girls this message
[1:16:09] the word it puts us on one Accord in one
[1:16:11] man I mean this revelation
[1:16:14] those who don't understand father and
[1:16:17] they they understand that getting on
[1:16:19] like just like getting on he didn't know
[1:16:21] who was who he was only told to count
[1:16:25] how many laughter water and count how
[1:16:27] many bow down so he knew then you told
[1:16:30] me which was which and which group was
[1:16:31] doing what so we only two or watch the
[1:16:34] Sheep father and we see they eating some
[1:16:36] weed or something we try to burn the
[1:16:39] world to them to restore back the Lord
[1:16:42] we know that how you kept Israel out of
[1:16:46] all the way from all the other nations
[1:16:49] from intermarry awful purpose because
[1:16:51] you're going to have a clean pure
[1:16:54] bloodstream to bring the Lord Jesus
[1:16:56] Christ room in God's you watched over
[1:16:59] that blood stream and you saw to it that
[1:17:00] that stream was kept a certain way all
[1:17:03] down through the Bible days that it
[1:17:05] would produced a messiah but he will
[1:17:07] come for naught or their blood because
[1:17:09] of your blood your own blood
[1:17:11] so followed but he would come forth with
[1:17:13] the sanctified vessels so dear God there
[1:17:16] would be something you this morning sick
[1:17:18] and don't understand weakened anemic
[1:17:20] maybe have a blood transfusion this
[1:17:23] morning by the Word of God saw that
[1:17:26] there we can worry it in the blood is so
[1:17:34] Heavenly Father may they get this
[1:17:36] revelation and and then forsake these
[1:17:39] all little funny things which we could
[1:17:41] feel in your losing or just trying to
[1:17:44] speak a few words you could feel the
[1:17:46] tightness and so tight and fear and
[1:17:49] condemnation God made it nor this
[1:17:52] supposed to be praying and laying their
[1:17:54] faces in the word as these more people
[1:17:57] are doing Lord and their old timers
[1:17:59] should be that much more further up to
[1:18:00] Road so Heavenly Father the short turn
[1:18:04] that is left give us this dedication
[1:18:06] this desire in our hearts and until that
[1:18:08] time father may we keep moving on
[1:18:11] may the Lord bless you bring we ask this
[1:18:13] in Jesus name Amen
[1:18:16] to God's unchanging God's unchanging
[1:18:27] hand

[1:18:33] your song things a turn
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:43] some change in this swirl stain richest
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:10] see

[1:19:15] we trade
[1:19:16] [Music]
