[5:35] God i' like to take a text out of here
[5:38] Gates of

[5:44] Lord and straight is the
[5:47] gate amen praise our God and God you
[5:52] can't Worship in just any
[5:55] gate any Baptist Church Methodist Church

[6:51] here he says uh uh uh I will praise thee
[6:54] for thou H has heard me and art become

[7:08] saying open up this Temple unto me and
[7:12] there's 12 different Gates there and all
[7:14] of them is the Gate of the Lord 12

[11:23] looking for
[11:24] character he doesn't want same in the
[11:27] natural if a man is looking for physical
[11:30] Beauty and things of the world where he

[32:35] amen but I want to bring out four
[32:37] attributes of God that bring Salvation
[32:39] to those who fear God
[32:43] see and uh and the these attributes of
[32:46] God have been at work down through all
[32:49] the ages bringing people to
[32:51] Salvation which is excuse me um Psalm 85
[32:55] you can open to it because I'm going to
[32:57] speak out of there right now the Lord
[33:00] willing Psalm 85 which is Mercy and
[33:06] Truth righteousness and peace these four
[33:10] attributes have been working down
[33:12] through the ages to bring people to
[33:14] Salvation to those who fear Him fear Him
[33:16] means to really believe this word nowen
[33:18] that there is a God then you fear Him
[33:21] see so now but what I want to say this
[33:24] morning God has been doing a special
[33:28] since
[33:30] 1963 with these same four
[33:32] attributes mercy and truth and
[33:35] righteousness and peace it's been over
[33:38] the long age other words over the
[33:40] overall picture has always been this air
[33:43] because coming to people to bring them
[33:45] to salvation but this age is the bride
[33:49] age the call out age and this has been
[33:51] present
[33:52] tense the fullness of Mercy the fullness
[33:55] of Truth the fullness of righteousness
[33:58] and the fullness of peace now down
[34:00] Through the Ages uh people have uh
[34:03] tasted of this here are you follow me my
[34:05] friends but look at our glorious age
[34:08] where God himself has come down and
[34:10] become our righteousness Our Truth our
[34:13] peace and our Mercy right in our age
[34:15] here now you understand it what I'm
[34:17] talking about right now amen now watch
[34:19] because let us hit this here because for
[34:21] about 5 minutes or so truth now the
[34:23] first one is truth truth is sent forth
[34:26] to make known the revealed word will of
[34:30] God now notice what I said the revealed
[34:34] word will of God truth had to come
[34:38] forward because in the Pentecostal age
[34:40] Le out of seia everybody did what was
[34:43] right in their own mind as to what they
[34:47] thought was the will of God Amen see it
[34:50] now so therefore God said well that's
[34:54] all right the blood is going around the
[34:55] world see but now I'll come down myself
[34:59] and I'll make known my reveal will
[35:03] though they'll read the Bible and swear
[35:05] that's right but I bringing forth in
[35:07] season it'll be contrary to their
[35:09] thinking always is amen see so therefore
[35:14] now like
[35:16] balam there'll be many who because who
[35:19] anointed see and they
[35:22] preach prophesy gifts and so forth see
[35:26] now I will give of that type in 63 and
[35:29] through 65 my perfect
[35:34] will amen see now I told balam don't
[35:40] go see but balam's own heart desire his
[35:45] heart what he wanted to do he had a Lust
[35:49] For
[35:49] Gold and popularity and so forth that
[35:53] was in his heart and God knew
[35:55] it so God told him what to do and he
[35:58] didn't want to do he want to do what he
[35:59] wanted to do so God blessed him and let
[36:03] him
[36:05] go now now you think amen external
[36:09] blessings manifestations right
[36:13] now see but the revealed will of God has
[36:16] been made known the true word Goes Forth
[36:20] first then after
[36:23] that lust desires from their own heart
[36:26] they shall heal to themselves
[36:29] teachers for what they want for what
[36:31] they think it should be are you
[36:34] following me but the perfect will of God
[36:38] then the perfect will of God gives way
[36:40] to the permissive will of God and many
[36:43] are walking in God's permissive will
[36:46] right now and don't know it see and God
[36:48] actually said go
[36:51] ahead yeah ministers they want to preach
[36:55] go ahead he anoint anybody and let him
[36:56] preach if you got an honest heart show
[36:58] go ahead that's wonderful do work for
[37:00] the Lord wonderful go all over the world
[37:03] well that doesn't mean
[37:05] nothing don't mean a
[37:07] thing but if God could find a a vessel
[37:10] somewhere that will hold steady
[37:12] according to the word wait on the LA
[37:14] that's a little different now now when
[37:17] then when the season comes well how do
[37:19] you know what God's going to
[37:21] do they've been laying still whole and
[37:24] still amen laying being overshadow by
[37:27] the presence of God waiting on the Lord
[37:30] many have a running up and down the
[37:32] country all around the world and the
[37:33] Lord sent me here and there and all kind
[37:35] of ideas but they've been laying still
[37:38] God has got a portion here brother just
[37:41] about this much here for this age right
[37:43] here just before 73 he's got something
[37:46] hang hanging hanging right in there but
[37:48] only intelligence wisdom knows what it
[37:51] is amen amen it's got to come by
[37:54] Revelation but he only Wars you to
[37:57] believe that and then when he comes
[37:59] forward you'll see you'll see what he's
[38:03] got HD HD right in here for the bride
[38:05] he's got a certain portion which he did
[38:07] not fulfill on the Earth but he laid it
[38:09] here for this age in the bride and he's
[38:12] going to bring that word through a
[38:14] virgin womb the one that believes all
[38:16] that word and he'll bring it to pass
[38:19] amen praise our God so now abam had his
[38:23] oldal design what he wanted so God gave
[38:27] him of time for it to come
[38:30] out and yet while the time for it to

[42:58] minutes it won't be many that will be in

[43:05] short
[43:06] time cuz there not many only be a few
[43:09] amen amen see so now
[43:12] anyway now it says here in Psalms here
[43:15] 85 praise our God come be hurry now the
[43:19] message got home now the 10th
[43:24] verse praise the Lord amen a mercy and
[43:27] Truth are met
[43:30] together righteousness and peace have
[43:33] kissed each other isn't that beautiful
[43:36] amen now
[43:38] watch truth comes forward to make known
[43:42] the reveal will word of God see now
[43:48] righteousness demands obedience to this
[43:53] truth oh yeah see the righteousness of
[43:56] God spoke out through the prophet every
[43:59] word amen oh Eve take every word
[44:04] demanding it only in this age now did
[44:07] you get it now righteousness the Holy
[44:09] Ghost Christ in the form of the shout
[44:11] come down and
[44:13] demanded obedience to every word to the
[44:16] truth you follow it now
[44:20] see and see so now now righteousness is
[44:24] the character of quality of being right
[44:29] or just see now I have a little note
[44:33] here it was formerly spelled right
[44:37] wiseness they spell that years ago you
[44:39] know right
[44:42] wiseness righteousness other words you
[44:44] was wise see and you was right and you
[44:47] was always wise but they changed the
[44:49] word over to righteousness amen amen
[44:53] praise the Lord so now um the right
[44:57] rightousness of God means essentially
[45:00] the same as his faithfulness or his
[45:05] truthfulness other words that which is
[45:08] constant with his
[45:10] nature and his promises that's why he's
[45:14] the same yesterday today and forever am
[45:16] amen so therefore when his righteousness
[45:18] you say that righteousness that you have
[45:20] that that must be constantly the same
[45:24] with his own nature if you got it and

[1:00:42] sitting there watching it but he must
[1:00:44] pour out his Spirit upon you the spirit
[1:00:47] that rested on the apostles on the day
[1:00:50] of Pentecost that set up on them the
[1:00:52] spirit that could call take the
