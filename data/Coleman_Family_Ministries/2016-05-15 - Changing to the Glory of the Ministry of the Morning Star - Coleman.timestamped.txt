[42:32] knee down to my ankle disc contined for
[42:34] a couple of hours after he prayed and
[42:36] then it suddenly left and I immediately
[42:38] felt a great relief the pain and
[42:40] numbness were gone however when I woke

[1:38:00] out and when he did a white horse rider
[1:38:03] started out it and it still was a
[1:38:09] symbol so when you read Revelation
[1:38:11] you're reading the symbol but thank God
[1:38:12] we can read it we have understanding
[1:38:14] when we hear the tapes and so
[1:38:18] forth now watch he said it would be
[1:38:20] known the last day but when it comes
[1:38:22] forth in church symbol do you understand
[1:38:25] Church it comes forth in a symbol of a
[1:38:29] church as they know there is a seal if
[1:38:33] you don't put it in there as a symbol
[1:38:35] you we wouldn't know anything about any
[1:38:37] Thunders or SEALS or nothing but he had
[1:38:39] to put in there only as a
[1:38:42] symbol so we would know that there's
[1:38:44] something there somewhere there's a God
[1:38:47] somewhere to take me out of
[1:38:50] leosa leosa this is not God God blind
[1:38:54] wretched miserable poor naked this ain't
[1:38:58] God there's got to be an angel come
[1:39:01] forth It's got to reveal these symbols
[1:39:04] and things
[1:39:06] amen or may be
[1:39:08] seated come forth in a symbol as a
[1:39:10] church they know is a seal but just what
[1:39:12] it is they don't know because it's a
[1:39:14] white horse rider and it's only to be
[1:39:16] revealed at the last day when this
[1:39:18] actual seal is broken broken to who not
[1:39:21] to uh not to Christ but to the church oh
[1:39:25] my that just makes me tremble I hope
[1:39:27] that church I hope the church truly
[1:39:29] understands see what I mean I'm going to
[1:39:31] call you bride you understand the voice
[1:39:34] is a

[1:39:43] thing thundering
[1:39:46] out
[1:39:48] okay come from the father's Throne I can
[1:39:51] skip here I think you get the
[1:39:52] understanding now by the symbol okay I'm
[1:39:54] going to skip down for here the four
[1:39:56] horse riders each one of them the Beast
[1:39:59] Matthew Mark Luke he explains all that
[1:40:01] there trying to hurry and one of the
[1:40:03] Beast said come see he heard the noise
[1:40:05] of a thunder one of the Beast said come
[1:40:07] see in other words here stands the lamb
[1:40:10] and John is standing out there watching
[1:40:12] happen and the lamb come up from the
[1:40:14] throne like he had been slain blood all
[1:40:16] over him he was the one that was found
[1:40:18] worthy when he reached over and took the
[1:40:20] book then everything began to shout
[1:40:23] screaming and carrying on when they see
[1:40:24] him took the book you see because they
[1:40:27] knew Redemption was paid
[1:40:30] for people in the message don't even
[1:40:32] know that I don't know what's wrong with
[1:40:34] him okay now he comes to claim his own
[1:40:38] so he takes the book stands out there
[1:40:40] before John he pulls it back breaks the
[1:40:43] seal pulls the seal down when he pulls
[1:40:46] the seal down a thunder clap through the
[1:40:49] place a thunder and when a thunder CLA
[1:40:52] No Doubt John might have jumped up in
[1:40:54] the air what's wrong with jumping praise
[1:40:57] God hallelujah when it thunders brother
[1:41:00] you jump when you had a natural
[1:41:02] thunder lightning thundering praise God
[1:41:07] Amen when a thunder roar may be seated
[1:41:10] in one of the four beasts said now come
[1:41:12] and see what it is what is revealed
[1:41:14] beneath there oh my John right what you
[1:41:16] see so John goes to look and see what it
[1:41:18] was John goes to see what the Thunder
[1:41:21] said it is then
[1:41:23] that this creature told John come and
[1:41:25] see what the mystery is under the first
[1:41:26] seal the Thunder the voice of the
[1:41:29] creator has uttered it now he ought to
[1:41:32] know what what's there but now but think
[1:41:36] when he wrote this and when he started
[1:41:38] to write those uh other seven right
[1:41:41] those other seven Thunders said don't
[1:41:43] write it so he only wrote the six and he
[1:41:47] put it in simple form and it put the
[1:41:49] seventh one in Revelation 81 nothing
[1:41:51] silence and and now John don't write
[1:41:54] what you what you heard what was spoken
[1:41:57] that's in the scriptures I got a prophet
[1:42:00] he's going to do that so don't tell
[1:42:03] them cuz the whole thing will be all
[1:42:05] messed up down Through the Ages don't
[1:42:08] say what them Thunders
[1:42:10] are amen don't write that that that's a
[1:42:13] quote on Mighty exploits of
[1:42:15] faith I have it somewhere here amen
[1:42:18] don't write it he's been now he's been
[1:42:20] commissioned to write everything he seen
[1:42:22] But when these seven th Revelation 10
[1:42:23] other don't rate they are Mysteries we
[1:42:25] don't know what they are but my opinion
[1:42:28] they will be be real right away and when
[1:42:30] they do it they'll give faith for that
[1:42:32] Rapture and Grace for that
[1:42:36] church yes sir we just move through
