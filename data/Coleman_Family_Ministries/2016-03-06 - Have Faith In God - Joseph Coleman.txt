TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so uh would you turn with me to the word of God St John 5 the 5th chapter I want to read from there and um don't even have all my scriptures together we've been rushing all day we were to have some of the Kentucky Colonel's chicken today but he closed up on us the only one in New York and we got all thrown off there but we finally found a delicatess to go to and rush back so you pray for us tonight uh I'm want to read from St Mark 11th chapter the 22nd verse and the 23rd verse I'm reading from St John the 5th chapter after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue basa having five porches in these lay a great multitude of importent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 3 and8 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the important man answered him sir I have no man when the waters trouble to put me into the pool but while I'm coming another steth down before me Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and now St Mark 11th chapter 22 and Jesus answered and saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith may God a blessing to the reading of his word I take a thought from here a a title here I'd like to take a little subtitle here um have faith in God uh let us uh go to the author of the book for a word of prayer our heavenly father we truly thank you dear God to be found alive in Jesus Christ tonight Hallelujah and God as we feel the moving of the water sprinkling up over us tonight Lord we want to thank you God for the blessings for the word of the Lord and father we thank you for eternal life God we thank you for the blood that we know we can come here tonight Lord and we can be washed clean of our sins Lord what a confidence to have in this hour to know that there is one that loves us hallelujah God there's one that will take care of us that that knows us all about us just like this lame man here was laying at the pool that knew all about him you knew all about him Lord all those 38 years he laid there and God you know every one of us here tonight father you knew us from the foundation of the world you made us Lord thusly as we are now Heavenly Father tonight we pray that you'd bless the reading of the word bless the hearing of it and God uh bring us to a Faith Lord that we could accept everything written in this word as it is our word for you said if we say Lord that that thought keeps striking my heart if ye say God we would pray that you would make the word in us as one one thought one Mind One Faith and God by your grace and your mercy you could bring us to that place that we know we must stand at yes that position and and then we'll see the Fire Fall Heavenly Father we are looking for it God we desire it in our hearts so we pray that you bless this little message tonight I don't know what to say Lord I ask for Grace to give me strength Lord and may the Holy Spirit my God come down tonight and pour out his Spirit upon the people well we pray and we ask it in jesus' name and for his sake amen well um the little thought I have tonight have faith in God um I believe all of us here take off my coat a little warm are are looking for Apostolic times moving Among Us can we say amen amen amen amen we're not dead no we are alive Amen in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and we are moving now the holy spirit is moving through US Amen to Quicken us to the word of God his promises and but we know how that perfect faith has to bring it see because like we said the the uh we have to be in position to have that Faith see now his disciples they they had the power but not the faith see just perfect faith I'm speaking about Jesus gave them power and sent them out see the word gave them the power cast out Devils heal the sick rais the dead see and the same word right here this written word right here written form has given us power in this day raise the Dead cast out devils and also heal the sick and so forth these signs shall follow them that believe see but it takes that perfect Faith to move the power in the word see and so therefore we are growing into that excuse me and we know that the prophet of God has taught us away from that all that emotion I got it and you don't have it that's only emotion you think you got it cuz he's taught us well he's taught us that real faith is substance and when you see a man with real Faith you know that he knows he's got it for he stands there and the thing happens amen well that's what we want that's that real faith and then to me and and us looking for that faith we actually have faith coming into us for the thing that God is wanting us to do we're doing it while looking at that perfect Faith you follow me now so uh therefore that's what the Lord that's why the word is to be preached that's why you are to be exalted for the promise of God and and is to bring you to a place for that and meanwhile the little simple things they begin to take care of themselves because Without You realizing it you begin to move in the spirit amen and then in looking for this perfect thing you know the things that easily beset you amen you begin to lay them aside just by something inward that little seed of God that's in there that's pushing up like that little Lily amen it's just pushing up it sees that perfect Faith up there and begin to push for it push forward and pretty soon unconsciously it pushes right on out of the shell amen right on through the mud right through all those dirty Waters amen glory to God it gets out in the sun in the sunshine amen then it blossoms out and it begins to reflect Jesus Christ that's exactly what God has been doing with his people here these past years so now we know that they could not cast out that epileptic devil because of the lack of faith and so now we know that um Jesus said whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you have it and you shall have it so therefore that is his way see and it's it's it's always been his way not to force it on you just to if thou Wilt wil thou be made whole see is this that you have to uh yourself have a desire to want that see and so some want to have a desire to camp on lesser ground see but the real Overcomer the real elected one they have a desire to Camp up on the mountain amen up on the top of the mountain where the sun is shining up there where the Eagles go in amen see so therefore but desire must be there see uh just like um Joshua there he had God's will he knew exactly what God told him you're going to inherit this land he had been on probation because 40 years and he knew God's promise he knew his mind and then when he was given the word go there he went and he was in the line of duty and he didn't even have have to pray he just he knew he had need of it and he just said Son stand still Moon you go to hang over there see he was right in the line of duty he had reached that position amen he had reached that place that he was predestinated to be at in the right time for God had said where the souls of your feet stand that that is your land is that right I will be with you don't turn the left or the right look straight ahead and that's exactly he looked the way to Jesus and he just called and spoke the word see so therefore now Jesus was the word amen and Jesus had faith in what he said would happen see now how did he do it Jesus said I can do nothing in myself the father he doeth The Works see me now so he relied on what he was and he was the word now well he had Faith then in knowing that he himself was the word amen see and he had faith in knowing that God had made him the word so therefore therefore then he by faith he understood that he was the word and that's exactly where God is trying to get this bride to that place where she positively after coming through that's why he had us add to our faith the word M that's why so when you get to that spot when that press comes down see if you just laid around in 63 4 and five waiting you know for the Holy Spirit to fall upon you and never taking the word itself never having trials and tests and so forth never going through these things here when the Press come down you would know what the word was because there's a spirit out here that would deceive the very elected if possible therefore how could you know see but when you know at the word works at this power of God works in me amen and the power of God has worked in your life day in day out you've seen the allmighty power of God working in your life you seen God moving in here moving in there healing in here doing this over here doing that over there you know it works by experience is that right and then all the time God is moving you to that place amen see so therefore Jesus Christ knew because the scriptures said that he was the word he knew that he had perfect faith in the word amen well therefore the Paul said that we are written Epistles we are the scriptures and God has ordained for this age a certain things to happen see and therefore then we should rely on what God said we are as Believers and if he can only get a few Overcomers to really believe it see to really know that that's what I am just like Joseph until his word came true see he was tested and tried and we are tested and tried but that word is going to come true Jesus said it is written of me see so therefore God's trying to get us to a place where we'll say he said if ye say and then one day you'll just hit that spot amen you'll strike that position where then you'll just say it yourself and it'll be so and and the thing about it God is wanting to do that amen he's waiting wanting for somebody to come on and get to that spot there his prophet got there he showed us the way amen and we saw it we know it works amen we know it's true amen praise the Lord see now if we truly believe then the signs will automatically follow for they have got to follow see now you become the word as you receive the word if he abide in me and I abide in you then ask what you will see now we have got to recognize our position as the bride see as he recognized the position his position as the Savior the Redeemer as the word of God as God himself he recognized his position see and the only way you can do that is to walk in the spirit to walk with this word see and therefore and that is our test today before uh uh this is is the way of the Cross and many church people with uh great swelling natural words try to steer you off the course that your father has laid out for you why it'll seem so right in the natural it'll just be so fine and close see but something that seed that Jean amen down inside said that ain't right yeah see I mean now you just know as we say you know that you know that you know amen praise the Lord see me now so therefore you say well that ain't right then somehow You' be burdened down and then maybe you might pick up a tape or you read the word somewhere there it is see and you walking in the spirit then you know you're right and all around you think you're wrong but you know you're right then you see Faith being expressed and that's then God is pleased for them that come to God must believe that he is see to me now friends so therefore this Faith Works by love because you love this word so much the word of God Jesus Christ you want to do all that he is commanding us to do until you can get to the spot like Elijah got to a place to a position I have done all these Commandments at Thy word amen see when the bride comes to that spot she can say that with no condemnation at all she has added all these things according to his word hallelujah you follow me friends see so therefore we are being built now up to a perfect faith and by the perfect word of God to bring on the perfect Jesus Christ who is perfect Faith amen see now uh therefore this is God's challenge to us see now watch I want to say a few things here see what is God doing he's trying to get the Overcomers see to be focused in on the word he's trying to get the Overcomers to come right to that spot and seem like the the holy spirit is just laying in my heart see to uh keep saying this that we've got to focus in on the word I call A A Min brother the other day excuse me and he began to give me a rundown on Tucson and this place and that place when you hear those things you want it if you ain't crazy or something because it sound like you're wrong and all that's right see talk about now so that's when the Holy Spirit spoke me with this thought never mind that what is that to thee follow thou me amen focus in on this word see and when you do you become a Mystic they think you're a nut that right Y is that right odd boy amen see me now but nevertheless you know that the word is the anointing oh my God that's the anointing the word see now and then when you abide in this word you are in the anointing and then you are anointed Jesus's walking around the word that's what you are you abiding right in it see me now and then when that just gets like one then you can ask what you will see that me now friends now because you and him have become the same thing see me now and you can only become that by taking this word see it is Christ in you and you in Christ see and now and the mind that was in Christ that same mind is working in you through this anointed word You Follow Me Now other words Paul said over in Romans 12 he he said be not uh I besee you therefore Brethren not to be conformed to this world but be ye watch that he's speaking about persons who already were they had the holy spirit in the soul that right so he was tell them how to be because transformed by the renewing of what the mind the spirit that right by bringing in the word and have their Spirits renewed that's exactly what we're doing now our spirit is being renewed being transfigured because transformed see me now so therefore the mind that was in Christ see was to fulfill the father's word that was the mind that was in Jesus Christ see he was the word then when you us and the word can get focused together see talking about now see the Holy Spirit himself he is this great anointing here now the sun right in the sea well the Holy Spirit see he takes that word and we sitting here and he takes the word and brings it into our focus and we begin to Blink a little bit see me now and then he you like you go blurry like you here see and then all of a sudden boom there it is he got to bring it there yeah you say oh I see that see me Bo that's him bringing it in there like that see because your ey is a camera and the Holy Spirit just brings that word and what's supposed to be right to its spot he focus it in for you when you see it then your eyes is washed with PTI amen See Me Now other words just like a camera you have a camera you take the camera and you take your little finder on there the site finder there and you begin to focus in your picture you want to get the picture sent it right and so forth and you know because balance off just right if if you're doing because it's a photography see so therefore before you snap the picture you want to have a perfect picture is that right therefore you must focus it in so therefore by taking the sight of your camera see and bring it to the place to where you can just see that all things is possible you follow me now if you could take the camera of the word of God and bring it to what what these because Apostles saw you follow me now Look through this camera and see the same picture that they saw look through the camera and see the same gospel that they preached see me it will produce the same results are you follow me friends see therefore if you take the camera the word and focus it in on that word see it will hit the target amen that's right now no matter what the church critics say now you got the camera the church critics don't see what you're seeing because the Holy Spirit has focused in for you and they're trying to look and see what you're see and you looking right at it and you seeing that these signs shall follow them that believe and how do you know it already hit the target already 2,000 years ago you know it's right it's right here then you seem to same God come down and confirm it and do it all over again amen and then your eyes is focused in on that the church because critics they don't see that well only one supposed to do that there and this is supposed to happen over here and that's supposed to happen over there you say shut up I got the because I have it focused I see I know what I'm talking about I was blind and now I see I can see now amen praise the Lord see and it is exactly in focus with the word I know it will work cuz they had already hit the target amen praise the Lord see then if we see the vision that they saw see same thing then you will cast out Devils you will heal the sick you will raise the dead for it already hit the same Target amen praise the Lord see now it will bring forth a glorious Church see now if we take our camera and focus it off and get a little blurred up we see man's Z day over here that ain't right so just because keep f away from there ideas over here opinions over there what he said over there that ain't right but get it focused right on that word you follow me now no matter I don't care who says what Focus your camera of your eyes on the word and you're going to hear you're hearing now all kind of things all kind of critics that right they don't know the word but if they would ever by his grace have their eyes washed away with PTI amen and then they would see what you see but they don't see it see so therefore you just go right knowing what's in their heart brotherly kindness just keep moving amen see so now um if we look at Jesus see he will send the fire to hit the target just like it hit back there amen praise the Lord therefore then Jesus Christ watch what he did now here's this little bride and here in Lea he come again the Holy Spirit came down and begin to focus one here he him over there one over there Focus their thoughts their ideas you follow me away from leosia he begin to get it focused right lined up with the word is that right see me now then they begin to wash away from their own opinions wash away from their own ideas because they begin to focus in with the word and line up just right are you follow me friends amen see then begin to line up with one purpose one achievement one desire see me now one Lord one faith one baptism one one word one God see them in now not three four and five see them in now just one see therefore if we will let him do it he the holy spirit will focus this word Focus this word right to that place it'll bring you right to that place amen praise the Lord see and when you get to that place it will prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the Lord see now we can only get our lives line up focused into this word here see into the word then our lives and the word become one cuz it's Focus dead on it amen see now um therefore see but we got to know what is the Father's will now see for the father's will is for the bride to be the Living Word of God now that's his will see so therefore his will then by the mind of Christ bringing it in every day tape and also the Bible and sermons preach the will of God the will of God to be the bride to be the bride pretty soon you get to focus right on that and everything else passes away PR soon that word begin to live in you I'm a bride of Jesus Christ amen then you begin to act like one then you begin to walk like one then you get it focus on it hits the target and you know that it work back there for them you know it's going to work right here this time for you amen praise the Lord see then the holy spirit will focus our thoughts see right to the father's will and when it comes right to the father's will then he can begin to do a work in our hearts amen praise the Lord see and then when the word and the bride becomes one it becomes the same mind the same Faith same thoughts same desire it's the same so much so until the fire will strike it and then you see something happen amen praise the Lord see so now we must focus our eyes in on the word see now okay we take our camera and we use have an object and we begin to could play around we trying to get it Center just right that right before we snap the picture that right now God is going to snap this picture here in the end time that right but before we snap it before this negative is developed get it sent it right amen amen get the picture send it just right now when you sending the picture you see a sister maybe a brother you follow me now now she ain't just just right dressed just right something's wrong in that picture there according to the word on the word is that right friends if it's a minister or a d whatever it is see each person in the picture uh must be focus in on that word and when everyone is focused in on that word see me now then you will see something happen see and then a hand will snap it his hand will snap it and then you'll see a perfect picture developed is that right am see the picture is now now being developed what's it going to be amen see so now tonight if we can Center our thoughts our mind our aspirations our hope everything on that one on that word as God's Prophet did you'll see something happen here here tonight that right friends yes sir see now when you are develop that negative amen see it will produce a positive picture of Jesus Christ now if every object every woman in in the picture every man every minister is centered zeroed in on Jesus Christ in the picture here in the evening time that right and when the hand snaps it you have a positive picture of a bride a living bride everyone dressed just right everyone looking just right everyone in their place each one come to that spot and then God can snap the picture and show it out here and you see a bride amen so therefore I believe that God is trying to line up a picture here in New York you believe that friends I believe he's trying to line on one down in lingrove a picture see cuz he already has one picture here already of the apos church already but he got to have two because the bride passed in reviewed twice so he's got to get a living picture here I can look at it sure but I want it to be here right now living amen I want the same Holy Spirit to walk in here live in here in people amen amen these signs shall follow them that believe and all of these things happening right here now I want that picture that's my desire I want to see a picture right here in New York do you want to see the same thing well let's get zeroed in on the word and you'll see it happen amen praise be to God Amen see so therefore now watch but when you are snapping your picture you got to focus out all doubt all unbelief Abraham did that right God gave him a picture there he got the picture just right and his picture was all Faith that's right no and when it got a little blur it was doubt over there and he scooted in around like his said and got it just right amen Focus out all unbelief Focus out all doubt all sin amen am just focus in zero in on faith and it'll strike the target every time praise be to God see me now and now when you're really focused in on the target you'll know your position and the Winds of Doctrine can't bother you you won't even worry about the goats you find that goats will come and say you know is sure nice over there shut your mouth keep moving you f the prophet said so shut your mouth what he said didn't he amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord see so therefore you know why because you have an original picture that right I mean it's not like you didn't see the picture you see it right here and it's made so plainly on the tapes and you saw it living so therefore when the Holy Spirit Focus your eyes on that picture you say that's what I want you follow me now and then you know how they live then Focus your life into their life how they walked because how they lived what they did and you begin to do the same thing then the Holy Spirit Will snap that picture of you doing that amen praise the Lord see then you'll see the same life hitting that same Target see so therefore then you won't care what anybody says see now only the Holy Spirit can take the camera of your eyes see and let you see listen to to what I'm going to say now only the Holy Spirit can take the camera of your own natural eyes and let you see what is his purpose and what he is amen right amen and when you once see what he is and what his purpose is what he did back there when you see it he is the same yesterday today and forever only he can do that now and watch see me now you see because Moses let the Holy Spirit take the camera his eyes one day and look out to see his purpose and God's purpose was that Israel was a covenant people is that right so Moses looked out there and got it and got it focused just right and here was Israel beat down slave that right he said no let me Focus out the slave part focus in promised people part amen when he got that picture just right now Pharaoh looked without the holy spirit amen he saw slaves mud doers amen is that right so therefore therefore he had doubt so therefore he focusing all the doubt out there and said because there ain't nothing out there let's kill him and so forth see but therefore Moses he looked and he saw God's people out there and then he got his eyes focused just right and he saw who he was and he knew who he was and then the supernatural God began to move see so there therefore let us have faith in God see and look to his promise now now I want to say something here notice this now striking statement Faith about five more minutes see faith is designed to see what God wills and wants is it sing in now Faith is designed to see what God Wills what God wills and what God wants now watch there is no human knowledge wisdom scientific nothing F out that can do that I let it s see faith is designed to see what God wills and what God wants there's no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed by God to give to the human race to find out what the will of God is MH get it only Faith therefore without faith it is impossible to please God now if your faith doesn't focus with the word but leave it alone today I'm speaking about now many I say I got faith I got faith I got faith but if a with that word you better get away from it I don't care what they're doing in the flesh making a great show in the that don't mean nothing there but if it's not on that word you better leave it alone see therefore faith is designed to see what God wants because how do you see it through the camera of his promised word that's how you see it see me now through the camera of his promised word see this word here is the full revelation of God see now all it needs is a little fire to set it off see now um when you focusing on the word you don't care what happens see you don't care what they say you just keep walking and this hour now see why see you're looking at the Target you saw the target through the cam of your eyes and the target was this early church that right and God struck the tget once before and he promised to do it again you know that positively you know he is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same today therefore God watch is wanting us tonight I'm talking about to watch for the supernatural moving see me now see God backs up his word with signs it right he vindicates his word he Vindicated his Prophet with signs wonders Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost and we are his bride so I'm trying to get to show you we're coming to a spot but we got to be watching and looking and waiting for it are you follow me friends come on now amen see like this lame man here wil thou be made whole the man had laid in this condition because for about 38 years and when Christ come ask him this little question there see he said I have no man to put me in there and that's the trouble tonight there are people the minister the minister the minister see they they can't get that out of their mind for 38 years he got no man to do it see don't wait on man right see because God has called he that overcome it individuals God is making it that each one of you are having experiences your own selves God has made it that we even pulled away not by choice by the will of God in 65 the Holy Spirit say pull away from them let them have their own experiences so we pulled away and some didn't like it some didn't understand it see talking about now but had to go on anyway you have got to have an experience with God or you'll never know God you'll never know him for yourself and you have got to know God for yourself in this hour or you cannot stand you perish you must know God you follow me friends amen each individual must know God and this man here he met God he said I have no man to put me in the water and the Lord Jesus stand and the Lord Jesus knew all about him just like he knows about you and I see and so what happened here the situation here it was God's will they knew God's will you know and they was watching for it see it was God's will to have a supernatural sign at a certain time of a season the water would be troubled the water would because begin to move is that right friends therefore they waited and they watched and they looked for that Supernatural sign and when they saw it they all tried to get in there and this fell here because he wasn't the worst there but it was the father's will to heal that man it was God's Will and the word went right to him I was just listening now watch Jesus Christ walked by let's say a whole Hospital full of people laying there is that right m and yet today we here oh we got to clean out the hospitals glory to God I'll walk into the hospital and I'll clean them out I just heard a tape this week brother BR said let me drop something to you my Pentecostal Brothers he said I know what you're thinking you're thinking you're waiting for some men to rise up on the earth that's going to go in the hospitals and because clean them out he said that is a lie he said Jesus Christ moved by the spirit he moved to one man here wil thou be made whole left the rest in a worse condition and what that that man could get up over there could get up over there lame see him in now but he left them there halt laying blind laying down there and walk right by them it was the father's will led by the spirit of God to go to one person so you thinking this bride's going to go into and clean out the hospital you got another thing coming the prophet said that is a lie and yet there are those that day who believe that believe they got all kind of great ministry to go into hospitals could clean them out the prophy that is a lie this bride she'll move and walk in the spirit of the Living God hallelujah she'll say nothing except her father show it to her he'll show her his word and she's obedient to the to her husband and she walks right at whatever it is but when she gets there perfect Faith whatever it is it happens just like that see mean now so therefore these PE uh they move with faith therefore have faith in God for I believe right at this very hour we are now in the time of life right in here now this in the spring and so forth through here this season in here where everybody expecting something to happen is that right they all looking for something to happen there but therefore we pointed you to the word pointed you to the word each message is coming down if you if you've been noticing all day if you say you got to ask for it you follow me that your words see in now your word is coming it's the Holy Spirit doing that friend it's not me see me now it's pointing you to bring your faith up to a where you could just say uh speak you follow me now see me now because it's got to be that way for God to move in other words it's got to be under expectation looking for Anna was looking to see because the Messiah and so was Simeon and right the Holy Spirit had said that they would see it and they was expecting under expectation and when it happened then the thing went see now wilt thou be because made whole now to me today in this hour in closing the seventh angel has troubled the water it's the supernatural sign that we was waiting for the seventh angel troubled the water amen the water that was still laid still in the Book of Revelation for 2,000 years yeah amen that water began to move in ' 63 amen and therefore we didn't say uh no man can put me in here brother away we went amen went 10 down Indiana not waiting for a man take me down no son amen see you caught the moving of the water you saw the supernatural sign amen Therefore your faith in that Supernatural sign it moves you you saw it s me now you saw the angel trouble of water there all right then therefore tonight keep on stepping into that water now watch are you looking for the supernatural sign of God see then uh therefore this sign of God moved in a certain season now God vindicates his word right now Noah had preached 120 years Noah that right he preached and he watched and he waited finally the ark was built but Noah was still after preaching looking for a supernatural sign the rains and the Reigns come and then he knew that was a confirmation the evidence the answer to his prayer amen amen amen see it come see God shows it to you then when he saw the rain he knew he was all right amen see me now he saw the PCT he knew he was all right he was in his ark he was safe there was a sign because answered prayer and he was all Let The Rains come now you follow me now friends praise the Lord all right then we are not dead sitting around here watching see come on now we alive see and therefore we we've been watching for the supernatural sign he said I'll ride the trail one more time amen now that's Supernatural and he's going to do it and I'm watching and I'm waiting for it are you waiting for it I'm looking for it yes sir now watch because in closing because Elijah looked for rain to bring help to the people now it was about the fourth year that Elijah walked out there see after shutting up the Heavens could could neither do or rain then in the third year God said go on down and show yourself the word showed itself because in the third year you know last year everything come up last year you understand that right sold de seed and so forth Elijah walked out there and we all know the story because about because because how he challenged those false prophets and so forth the fire come down but the thing I'm trying to strike here is the last part of the 18th chapter there now watch he told his servant uh uh he told because servant the servant had looked one time for rain he didn't see nothing come back all disgusted I didn't see nothing so me now you know like like some people like uh something going to happen Easter you know and you preach and you sing and so forth I didn't see nothing follow me now see and down goes the faith nobody told anybody that you follow me now so you stay with the word amen amen amen praise the Lord see so Elijah said no no no no he said go back and look seven times MH is that right so therefore when he looked the seventh time in the fourth year thing happened amen see therefore now watch though see Elijah had already heard by faith before he said look after the fire fa I hear the sound of the abundance of rain Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God is that right he heard the sound of the abundance of rain first he heard then it settled there he knew it was going to happen now so now he just go pray for it ask if you say so he told him go look for it it's going to happen cuz he already heard the sound of the abundance of rain it's got to happen now because see when he his faith caught hold in the word of God God say it's going to happen your word going to bring it and then by faith he heard it coming so then by faith he spoke it say I hear it amen the servant didn't hear that he heard it is that right are you follow me friends amen amen see so in the seventh time it come in the fourth year now a little Cloud out of the sea resurrected up amen praise the Lord like a man's hand see all right that was a supernatural sign that right Supernatural see he saw the sign and said get thee down see that the rain stop thee not so he told a man to go ahead before the he started raining right look at the steps there first he he coming by hearing amen then what he's looking for happened Supernatural sign happened is that right it happened and when he saw it watch I'm saying because all for reason because I Prophet did the same thing you follow me now he saw it and he says get thee now and because the reain stop you not now watch see he spoke by faith see and the man's hand was the supernatural moving of God Amen see now because Elijah after he heard Faith come by hearing like we hearing now see he kept praying it was the seventh time when it come is that right praise the Lord see now he was looking for the supernatural he knew only the hand of God could do it amen he didn't worry like we right now we we a worrying that well once you do the Miracles where the signs at we know only the hand of God can do it we know only the Dynamics must strike the mechanic that is the only way other than that we pray we go back we look we pray we look we pray looking for that seventh time it's coming cuz we already heard the sound of the bundles of rain amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God is that right friends praise the Lord amen see see he was looking for it amen that he knew only the hand of God could do it then when he saw the hand of God there was j e s u s f a i t h he saw it right there amen so therefore but he had accepted the first move when he heard have you accepted the first move Faith cometh by hearing see now therefore he heard the sound of the bundles of rain our Prophet that right go out to a Tucson stand North out there sit in now you meet seven angels so brother Brandon went under the unction of God looking for what a supernatural sign seven angels coming from Heaven a blast with go off that right he was looking for it is that right and then when the supernatural sign appeared see he was looking for it already now see when it appeared then it was the evidence of his answered prayer that he had prayed watched and waited for for 30 years that's right see and then there then just like Elijah told his servant get thee down and run at the rain oia he turned right around says Billy Paul sent out the because cards we're going to preach the Seven Seals mhm the sign told him so right the sign he knew the seven angel that God was with him and he knew by the supernatural sign that it was answered prayer and he knew exactly what he was supposed to do see it was the moving of the water the supernatural sign and here we the bride we know that we ourselves we can't do nothing without him is that right but he said have faith in God ye of little faith you hear the sound of the abundance of rain you hear it by the words coming into every day any right and and just building up therefore don't be like the servant the first time just run look I don't see nothing go back seven times amen keep going back Elijah would had his face down to the ground hand down between his knees that right praying he know it's going to happen so God is trying to get us in here to a position to a place we are focused in on that word we so much so we know it's going to happen these three Hebrew boys after they had a little test of 10 days of pulse and also water water is the spirit and pulse is the seed you understand that that's all they had their confidence looked better and God gave them wisdom and also knowledge and understanding and all these matters is that right but then they came to a big press down see mean now but they already had Through The Eyes of the camera of the word they had seen the picture they were praying up they were on the word they had wisdom they had knowledge they understood the will of God they understood that God had given them Faith to know what the will of God is then when they presented the fire when they saw watch it when they saw them heat the fire seven times hotter then they knew that God was in the fire amen for it was seven times hotter the seven times only magnified God they said well glory to God here we go and Into the Fire they went and when that fire was heated seven times then number four appear one like the Son of God walking around in the fire a four and a Heaven God was revealed in the fire amen praise be to our God our God know what he's doing well friends in the evening time let me cut off here cuz getting too late here it's the evening time the water has moved the canceran water has move God has revealed himself I sincerely believe that uh uh uh he just he's trying to bring us to we can just believe that word just let that word just strike in there just the word is hang in there let it get so good to just scream out that's glory to God is the word of God they used to have a services like that I used to see just get up and walk up and down just walk God so good that's right just walk when 62 back in the tab back in there because you heard on the tape scream and shout and jump up and down it was the word I mean I knew what it was it it was something Supernatural I mean it was life amen you follow me friends it I mean it was all that I'm living for see and so therefore those Hebrew boys see I'm trying to get you to show you that they knew exactly where they were standing at they got a sign and God has given us signs he told us that the word the Hebrews 4:12 will know the intents of the heart these signs shall follow them that believe one day it's going to happen and when it happens you're going to know that your prayers are answered and then when you see it happen just if ye say be Thou made whole according to my word it'll be done friends because you see the both things DED but first of all you know that your word fed and spirit fill first first is that right you know
