TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now this morning I want to go straight to the word of God and for uh we know that we are here to feed upon the word of God praise the Lord let us turn to St Mark the 12th chapter 28th verse through verse 30 and I want to read if you're writing down the scriptures Micah the 6th chapter the 8th verse and Titus the 2 chapter verse 11-14 we reading from St Mark 12th chapter 28th verse and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all Jesus answered to him the first of all the Commandments is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment in micer the 6th chapter the 8th verse he hath showed thee Oh man what is good and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God and I want to read from Titus to tie all of this into one purpose Titus 2 11th verse for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that Den dying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zelous of Good Works May the Lord have a blessing to reading of his word I like to title this little thought seeing God seeing God and I like to break it down into two subjects uh seeing God the purpose of God and seeing God in the face of Jesus Christ um we know that this uh has been the Church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's ultimate goal this has been the spiritual people that are called by his name this is their has been their purpose of life and I was reading some little poem it reads like this with no author on it my goal is God himself not Joy nor peace nor even blessing but himself my God am so I like this s to use that you know and Titus tells us here about the grace of God that has appeared to all men bringing salvation and he says also in the 13th verse the 12th verse rather uh this Grace has trained us to reject and to renounce all ungodliness worldly lust and to live devout and holy lives in this present world and while we're living in this present world as we are right now awaiting and looking for the Fulfillment the realization of our blessed hope even the Glorious appearing of our great God and our Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Messiah the anointed one seeing God in other words we should be of such a state such a uh um uh a uh I should say in a sphere that uh we are are H with God Amen we are harnessed to the work of God we are believing we're trusting we're expecting we are yearning to see God Amen nothing else will suffice even as I believe it was one of these disciples Thomas said uh show us God and that will suffice us you see me you see God Amen and so now um seeing God is the purpose of life think that they can gain this prize uh through money or fame or position or something here in the world or enjoy that pleasure or a worldly lust or something here if they could do these things here or whatever it is through family or friends or whatever it is that they could be truly satisfied but we cannot be truly satisfied that way there's only one satisfaction Jesus Christ is our satisfaction they all wrong for it was over in Psalm 42 where uh uh speaking about the David here was his heart was open to the Lord I believe that David here expressed what is on his heart as the heart paned after the water Brooks so panth my soul after thee Oh God hallelujah my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meet day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God this is the way or wish it be this is the state that we should be in continually searching after God it has been said that there is a God shaped Blank Spot in man's heart and it has been said that there is a man shaped Blank Spot in God's heart praise God and it it it is this uh um God shaped Blank Spot something that God has put in our hearts that makes us yearn and desire that that Blank Spot Of God will be filled amen and there's only one person that can fill that spot that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth Hallelujah he is the only one and in in understanding of the threefold mystery of God that God had this revelation hid way in his heart in his mind before the foundation of the world that God would have the preeminence in Christ and that Christ would have the preeminence in the bride to do this to restore us back to Eden Hallelujah to bring us back to a perfect state where God walked with man on the earth in the cool of the evening where God fellowship with his creation and where the the creation understood and that their very every desire their will was in submission to this great God Hallelujah in the Garden of Eden but that state of bliss was broken by sin and every and ever since because there's a a man shaped Blank Spot in God's heart ever since that happened God has been yearning and Desiring that man would would because return back to that same that same perfect spot where he could fellowship with his Creations again amen and therefore because God rich in Mercy he went out searching for those that that will fill that spot and thanks be to God we are the ones that was in his mind before the foundation of the world we are predestinated to fill that God that man Blank Spot in God's heart and God's heart is Jesus Christ he amen praise God Amen it is because of this that God yearns for us he pursues us when you see a man in love with a woman he goes after her he Woos her he cours her glory to God and God Is wooing Us he he has gone after us he's yearning for us he loves us he cours us any way he can get us back through thick and thin trial tribulation sorrow whatever way it is God will bring us back that way why because he loves us we are we are the only ones who can fill that spot nothing else will do it God is yearning Desiring our fellowship Glory praise our God Amen that he had with Adam in the Garden of Eden praise our God I believe it is uh Revelation 4:11 read on this wise Revelation 4:11 uh Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created there it is praise God we were created for his pleasure is that right amen just for his pleasure and and and and uh uh other words Man was created for God's pleasure he was intended to be the Delight of God am and the object of his affection what a love story amen between God and His creation between Christ and his wife between God and his sons and his daughters amen and uh Enoch had this testimony he walked with God he pleased God by faith Enoch walked with God and he had a testimony before he was translated amen before he was translated that he pleased God Jesus Christ had the same testimony I always do the things that please my father always do the things and what is God trying to do now through his word to get his word to us to know how to please him praise that's all he's trying to do this morning to bring you his word his Commandments to know how to please him and then in loving obedience not with a whip not get in the house of God and you got to hear the word of no come and running in the house of God come in yearning and burning and desire to have fellowship with Jesus Christ the word of God not a duty not all stiff and all but broken humble contrary Lord what is thy will let thy will be done in my life though it slay me let it be done praise our God that's what the Lord is trying to get the the people to this is our purpose in life to see God only one provided way to see God and what is the purpose of life is allow God to fill that uh BL spot in our hearts to know God to love God to walk with God this is the scripture answer loving obedience to every word in complete surrendered submission this is to see God Ephesus fell from this first love the early church had this love brother and the whole uh religious World knew it for when they saw this love of God burning in the disciple heart they took note that they had been with Jesus for they loved Jesus and they expressed Jesus to the religious world because around the bottom they had a fervent desire to please God a passion to know his word uh uh a cry for reaching out in the spirit to have more of God for God to fill them uh now you know in in the Church of Ephesus um the name means also a relaxed drifting and so therefore that's why the Lord had to send the messenger to rebuke that age to get back to the first Works see cuz they were you can easily or because drift off the Lord can come down here and blesses and everything is wonderful and then the people get a little relx they don't make all the meetings anymore and they don't do this if he's got church you all they want things done a certain way they sort of just let it slip like a little Lex she's a very smooth Spirit you don't have to do this uh well you don't have to do that you don't have to fuss around here where that first love at where that yearning burning to please him in every way I always do the things that please the father where is that love at the love of many sh wank Co just forming fashion coming and moving but John understood what it was to love God the Apostle John for in 1 John 5:3 he said for this is the love you don't have to get anything hold it uh-uh for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word that is the love of God now you know um we can have a great service here and oh we can praise God we can sing the songs of Zion but then watch and see after if you go outside see and see if you're in that word see if you're walking in it living in it see if you're walking contrary now if you are walking contrary it is God's love to us that we would because come back to the first love repent he says and come back I believe it was we were speaking this morning sister Co and I about the the church ages there and how God was in God had virtue in every age other words in every age there he was dealing with the church and then because in there you could go there and get virtue but this age here is nothing blind wretched miserable poor naked and don't know it they ain't one virtue here all and that's why one had to come with the virtue and virtue is spiritual energy and spiritual energy is the word of God Amen and that's why this age here uh uh is individuals who will come here and see God who will yearn and burn for God themselves not to see here that we would be come here and we get ministers and deacons and that's wonderful that's fine but we have got to see God for ourselves not to say well brother com said this here and I must do that that's not seeing God you have to see God for a burning your heart in your own heart when you go home and read his word make love to him yourself praise God this only a ministry here to because teaching his ways but we ourselves in our homes and jobs and so we should be learning and burning and yearning for Christ there so when when we come here we bring a fire in here amen we then all of us is in love with Jesus here and Jesus comes down in our midst fills all the house amen and Moves In and Out makes love to each individual and as his word goes out whatever need you have he brings the word into your heart and in you're blessed hallelujah what a service that's going to be praise God Amen but so therefore uh we should be back to for to for me to live as Christ that's the way we should be on fire for God back to per we should want to see sin exposed cuz like anas and sa we should have our whole heart soul mind life go back to the way it was before and there's only one way back that is repentance other words we know here some of us here how we was on fire when this message come forward brother our minds was Sanctified our hearts was on fire to grab every word amen that's right and our walk in our jobs and so for all of a sudden 63 4 and 5 some begin to wne away what happen happen but Jesus Christ loves you this morning he has come down here this morning through his word don't miss it he's making love to you this morning by the word to get back to that first estate when he called you and yearned for you in love he called you and you were so on fire with him Lord what will thou have me to do whatever it was we know CU we have seen people here like that walking in that life but they Wan away they went away here they went away there but he's here this morning to call all your back to that first love and what is it her isra with the Lord thy God is one Lord amen to love the Lord thy God all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength that's what he's trying to get us to do this morning friends there's only one way back bring forth as John said bring forth fruits meat for repentance amen prove it by your life we can say it that doesn't mean nothing we can come in and sing do all kind things in here but prove it by your life in other words true hearts cry to God in sorrow then God shall restore and that Glory that you had one time shall be restored back to you again when you are repenting it weeps in the presence of God because it has grieved the Holy One the righteous one when a person when they repent they don't repent because it's me or this one and that one because they grieve God other words if the the word says God says do this here and I do something wrong and because I I do it to you a person well I don't have to go to you all stiff and form like well now because of forgive me brother see that's not nothing but you are repented because you grieve God not me see but you don't see the people who they could catch at they at they grieving God they are more interested in the flesh thing and saying uh because brother forgive me but I mean have you uh fell down on the floor somewhere and cried out and weeped and wailed before God because you grieved him in one spot that's what he's looking for praise God the the great God who has appeared as the god of our Salvation to restore us back to this first love the word friends the word of the Lord has come forth to bring us back this way what doth the lord god require of thee to Humble thyself and to walk with thy God to fear the lord to walk in his ways to love him seeing God is the purpose of life man's Chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever that should be our chief end friends and we see the love of many is waxing cold the Deep hunger for God is laxing is because lacking rather or we should settle for nothing less than God himself we shouldn't settle for any little blessing or whatever it is but we should all want to see Jesus Hallelujah see here's why now watch instead of uh stressing Holiness and walking in the word for personal life in order to to see God many have put the emphasis on service for God oh yeah pastors and ministers and deacons and helps and governments and many of these people think because they are Pastor or a minister or advant that they are really serving God this is the ultimate itself This Is the End is only a means toward an end this is not the end but they get deceived and and some even get lifted up in the offices that I'm really somebody and they begin to judge one another because by their success with God is having an office that's the wrong thing to do because he can have somebody who is nothing some old Aly rap somebody that he saves him and fills him with this first love and that person can sit here on fire for God a love going back and forth with Jesus amen and that person could be in a perfect state with Christ and another one walking around serving God and all puffed up see uh-uh you have to seek God for himself not because of service see now um I believe it's Proverbs 27:6 says faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful so Paul Illustrated the first part when he wounded Peter Cuz Peter was the blame when at this dissimulation and in his treatment of of Peter for Paul with stood Peter to the face before them all and told Peter to his face what he was doing see and so therefore a a proverb says faithful are the wounds of a friend it's good to be wounded face to face amen because only a friend will wound you with the word for the kisses of the enemy are deceitful and Judas he fulfilled that part for he kissed the Lord Hal Hallelujah I love you and he was deceitful amen amen so the Lord Jesus Christ May wound you this morning a little bit but it's faithful amen praise the Lord see so therefore I rather be honest with you and I have always tried to be I know I have wounded many in here praise the Lord but uh there's somebody to heal those wounds the Holy Spirit heals those wounds see but I'd rather tell you to your face from here from the tell you in the back or anywhere or go to you and tell you exactly how you're walking and it might take the skin off your hi amen but glory to God it's going to do you good amen praise God see rather than to tell you that you're all right I'll say something nice if you go in the back and I say well yes sister oh that's all right see something nice and smooth see I mean now so therefore that's a Kiss of the devil that's all it is see and I would be because allowing myself to prophesy something smooth to you but a man of God should tell you the word of God Amen see now um many think of of Christian Life as consisting in serving God as as fully and and efficiently as we can and they have all kind of techniques and methods and so forth they put more stress on that see to carry out the service we need power and and so instead of longing for God you find you might slip off and long for power so therefore make sure now the Dynamics are getting ready to fall and in this now don't be longing for power long for Jesus Christ Hallelujah long to see him he's the one see and therefore there's a fine line here now so I feel led to warn you this morning see many uh won't understand this now see and then there's others who they will seek God for some inner experience see and it's not so much for the Hunger for God but is to have some Joy or some happiness inside and if you if you get off looking for inner experience then you find you want to this meeting and you go to this Minister and you go over here looking for that something you go out to Arizona you go down to Indiana you go over here you go over there looking for that looking for it rather than looking for him looking for a certain uh experience to make you feel good but we should look for Jesus Christ amen see so therefore both of these ends fall short of our ultimate end and that is to see God and to enjoy him forever praise God so now we see then that this vision of of life that we are to have here is a god-centered uh Vision see it's the original relationship that uh Adam had with Jes with God Adam knew that he had been created um to Delight God see and his only concern was to respond to that Divine affection that's all see to live for him to do his will and it was Joy continually for Adam to submit until sin come in and Adam did nothing independently of God there lies the secret now as he lived in submission to God now watch every need in man's nature was satisfied as long as he was in submission to Christ God every need in his nature God satisfied it Hallelujah that's a powerful statement now I believe this some man I have down here CS Lewis said in perfect cyclic movement being power and joy descended from God to man in the form of gift Grace and return from man to God in the form of obedient love and ecstatic adoration praise God this is the end for the bride see we are here this morning to put the emphasis on on being being in love with Jesus instead of doing many want to do something for the Lord and God is trying to because get us to whole still and wait on the Lord Martha was doing something very diligent in service doing something and all busy and running around the table and Mary was being At His Feet worshiping her Lord I Hope You See It friends you see the me now therefore but now Martha was correct in service but the first thing is the yearning the burning desire for the Lord to just be with him to see him see praise God so now um when we can understand this here see uh then there'll come um uh what we would say an easing of of tension many of us are all tight and nervous and uh excited cuz uh uh did I do right today that's not no way because God wants to deal with you see you like you here he want you to relax and now here's why see um the situation will be the same situations but if he can get us to relax then we have changed see if fellowship with God is our first concern then we have that we have fellowship with God then then if that is our concern to fellowship with the word Jesus Christ then in the kitchen you can have joy on the job you can have joy and fellowship in sickness if it's fellowship with Christ well the word says in suffering you fellowship with him too then you can have joy and any kind of a trial if you're only designed to see God Amen you'll see him in everything amen then you can be satisfy then that portion will be yours and you won't be worry worrying nervous running up and down no more you you just be calm for you are happy you're fellowshipping with Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord then uh whatever comes across our path no matter how irksome how trivial it's nothing if this is the way my Lord wants me to fellowship with him I'll do it for the glory of God Amen praise God and therefore it's there to be done for the glory of God and then gone will be the striving the bondage the frustration the whole world is now in in frustration I was just reading here the other day here Saturday that they got in the new look magazine which is to to come out next week because I saw in the post office Saturday that uh a California has started a great Revival out there and uh uh thousands are coming to Jesus Christ the a formerly young children who had the drugs and so forth they're now turning to Christ in droves a Revival is on now in California and is sweeping East what is it and they saying themselves that Jesus is the answer for the yearning Jesus is the one for that Blank Spot in their hearts and they're coming and brother BR said that they would go on preaching and think they're being saved and then they're coming by the thousand they getting B they're doing everything and to think that we who are nothing through no goodness of our own he came down here in the in in the evening time and called us out to give us the real fellowship with him the word of God and these here are striving frustration everything else learning yearning for this here and they're not getting it hallu and we sitting here this morning getting it think on that now think about the people here pres next and bringing his Revolution here his six-point program I even read this morning the times that where he's going to go out and uh to four different regions all across this country and preach this Gospel of his of uh giving a power back to the people I mean you must know what that means given the the all the mighty power the greatest nation up on the earth is that right the greatest uh natural Nation on the earth is the power is in America here is that right well therefore Nixon wants to give that power out to all the little groups across the country give it out share the revenue money is their power amen what about our Christ he picked this nation here to bring forth his power his word it's about time for him to because share his power also amen the Capstone power I'm talking about amen and even his White House AIDS are to go out across this country starting here in February and preach this go goel go to the Mayors and the governors and so forth sit down with them and meetings and so forth and explain to them that they must get behind their senors to vote for these things and here we are what about the the plan of Union here with the a church group that they're doing the same thing and pretty soon you'll see this sharing the revenue hook up with the church that's right you'll see it see and now in the midst of all this here here is Jesus Christ pursuing us running us down some of us Amen to get us to be come back to him and be restored back that's what he's doing because he loves us cuz we are the apple of his eye there's a spot in in in in God's heart Hallelujah and he will not stop he is Relentless Hallelujah He will draw us back to him and no matter which way he's got to do it he will do it that's right so therefore we are that predestinated seed and if we will not by our own choice walk with him and want him he often has to allow sorrow suffering trials ill health smash plans and failure that's right so that in our need in our need we will find our need of him did you hear what I said amen our plans are all smashed up we going to do this something happens to it see then we find that Wing so big then we are deflated and then in that need we find him that's all he wants to do to have fellowship with he got do it that way you see friends you see what he's doing see so that in our need we will find our need of him such now such suffering is never wrathful but is Holy and only a restorative in his intention he's only trying to restore us back to that first state that he had with Adam in the Garden of Eden that Christ might have the preeminence in the bride and to restores Back to Eden amen praise God it is love of God humbling us and drawing us to the place of repentance and to God Christ today is trying to get us to a place of absolute dependence on him now here's why to see God is to apprehend him as a supply of our present need and believingly lay hold on him as such now everything has happened these past years is coming forth where we're going to we have to be stripped of this world and this message this morning is intended that we could raise up a little bit higher see and see that if we are to be stripped then we can't turn to nobody in the world amen amen we can only turn to him and that he he's our need see and then we can finally realize through sickness sorrow trial tribulation Lord Thou Art the one my Lord and my God when we finally reach that place you watch the third pull then because we he's going to walk with us he's going to talk with us he's going to feed us he's going to lead us right on out of here amen but he's got to get us to a place where service or or the inner experience or any of these things means nothing seeing God is the purpose of life Hallelujah that's what he's trying to get us to and I hope this morning you can understand it therefore the Lord Jesus is always seen Through The Eyes of need if we acknowledge that we are nothing and we really need him and confess our sins then he's ready and willing to forgive see but we must be needy people that's the way he's made known we're weaklands and we're Sinners the Holy Spirit Delights to show us the heart of the Lord Jesus as the supply of our needs if we're willing to come to the Lord amen amen then seeing Jesus as all we need as the soul believingly appropriates the word for itself and then there's no more striving there's no more strength we really see that Jesus is the one these are young people here they're seen it now and they have given up of families they don't care about jobs or nothing they ought to have a Revival now seeing Jesus as their need they tried dope they tried sex they tried everything conceivable and it did not satisfy cuz it can't amen only God can satisfy amen and to think that we are elected to fill that man blank space in God's heart the bride is think on these things friends this morning amen praise our God Hallelujah Jesus is all we need he's everything that's right we don't need anything else outside of Jesus Christ if we could ever for get that vision of Christ being our need God's glory 2 Corinthians 4:6 God's glory shines in the face of Jesus Christ as we look into that face there shines in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God which we can see nowhere else nowhere else will you see the light of the knowledge of the glory of God outside of the face of Jesus Christ don't look for hidden things don't look for secret you think that the Lord will only come down and tell you something in a great experience uhuh don't look for them things look for Jesus Christ for God himself said to confine yourself for he has manifested himself in Jesus Christ there therefore there's nowhere else to look in him God has said you'll find that I am what I am in him you'll find that all that you need what I require of you is in Christ amen and you go to him and you find out what I require and what you need is in Jesus Christ nowhere else neither in Heaven Nor in the earth can you find it outside of in Jesus Christ he's the one now what exactly is it that we see when we look into the face of Jesus Christ we see not only the light of the knowledge of God but also the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ now watch the face of Christ is what makes God glorious his face the glory of God shines in Jesus Christ's face now watch his face then reveals the glory of God but it's a marred face is that right spat upon and disfigured by the malice of men think on it now it's getting a little deep now come can read the scripture relax friends Jesus Christ loves you you're very tight this morning as many as were astonished at thee his Visage was was so marred more than any man in his form more than the sons of man this Christ and I have a a translation here his Visage was marred so that it was no longer that of a man so great was his def figment can you imagine that now it was so marred so Twisted by the sons of men that it was it no longer looked like a man and this was uh the glory of God in his face God's glory was in the face of Jesus Christ then uh this vision of glory to the Natural man this is shame and disgrace this this is not glory for the natural man glory to him is to be the a president of of of General motives or something or a big shot a big man over people that's because to be exalted that's his glory that's his idea of Glory but that is not because Christ in Christ it is the a reverse now watch not so much in his ability to exalt himself and humble man but in his willingness to Humble himself for the sake of man see not so much in in a mighty Display of Power that would break in pieces those who would oppose him but rather in the hiding of that power and the showing of grace to the undeserving see when they turn to him in Repentance I got something I want to read to you Moses said Exodus 33 I read it you write it down Exodus 3318 and 19 Moses said and he said I beseech thee show me thy mercy I mean show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy now catch it here Moses said I beseech show me thy glory and God said back I will make my goodness pass before thee so therefore God's glory is his goodness and goodness means Grace so therefore God's glory is his grace amen praise the Lord therefore he said I will not make my power nor my Majesty nor my Holiness pass before thee but I'll make my goodness pass before you because you're weak cuz you're Sinners cuz you can't help yourself therefore I'll pass before in Grace in Grace in Grace in grace are you catching friends there's his glory in showing his goodness his grace he was showing his glory Ephesians 1:6 let read this scripture here God help us to get a vision of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then you'll see a people brother that'll set this church on fire for God to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us except accepted in the Beloved to the praise of the glory of his grace it is this that makes the Angels hide their faces and bow down at the grace of God praise our God the Angels inquire to desire to look into this what is this all about here see praise God and he said over here in the same uh Exodus over here I want to talk about Jehovah and those seven compound names there a minute uh Exodus 346 and 7 the glory of God and the Lord and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord pass by before him and proclaim the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousand of forgiven iniquity and transgression in sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the children's children unto the third and the fourth generation there he was when he passed by he showed him Grace and that was his glory praise God when Jesus Christ was ready to go up in St John 12 he said mine hour is not come yet now God's glory we go from glory to glory we go from justification Glory sanctification Glory baptism of the Holy Ghost glory to the fullness of the word glory and we're sitting now in his glory and his grace Hallelujah for he has showed us this great salvation it is in Jesus Christ son of man being revealed through a prophetic message and here we sit in Grace this morning in glory Jesus Christ said mine hour is not come yet other words he was saying Glory not lifted up on the throne but on a cross other words he was ready to be glorified but not to sit on a throne to to be lifted up on a cross and there he was glorified on the cross praise God as a public spectacle of Shame for rebellious man that we might repent and come back to him this is the hour of my glory for it is the hour of Grace to Sinners so the grace was the glory upon the cross There Was His glory in Jesus we see that God's highest Glory consists in his of securing our deepest happiness and if I if I be lifted up I will reveal my glory my grace to thee if I be lifted up and die for you there's my glory for you there's my grace to you amen that you might come back there's a revelation of God and with that kind of Revelation that he was lifted up for us it should be so easy to walk in this door and sit down in here and don't get mad when the minister is preaching something you think is hard or rough or something for God's only trying to reveal his glory for the face of Jesus Christ has been shining here in the past eight years here through a message Hallelujah and generously hearing is love that you obey the Commandments of God so if you love God you will want to yearn and burn to desire to obey his Commandments amen and we see God in the face of Jesus Christ shining down upon us in love and power and Beauty but the world didn't see anything in him he's calling he's yearning and bring us back to at first love friends to restore us back that he might have the preeminence and as Micah 68 says he has showed the old man what is good and what do the Lord require the humble thyself to walk with God love God with all your heart soul and your mind friends here we are in this last hour here now in Jesus Christ um he we see him as our need now in the Old Testament brother Bram taught us he had a great experience 1950s that one day out squirrel hunting that the Lord came down and told him stand up and spoke to him and said that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament now now let's go back God appeared to uh Abraham I mean Moses and told him I am he said what is your name and called him forth in the the de burning py he said my name is I am well the the people ask me what is your name what should I tell them tell them I am that I am now I am that I am is is not complete there's there is because No Object there I am I cuz I am what but when you get a revelation of a personal Jehovah as I am I am what you need amen then it's Jehovah I am the Lord thy God Is Thy sacrifice I am thy banner I am th because a comforter healer or whatever I am amen but until you catch the Revelation I am that I am amen seven compound names a Jehovah RI ni and so for because a Jehovah because a Shalom one time I think it was a Gideon there and when he found who he was he called him a Jehovah Shalom peace amen seven compound names now watch God had revealed himself to uh Abraham Jacob and Isaac as the almighty God the nourisher to give him strength to come down to the fourth age where he can reveal himself as Jehovah I am and Jesus Christ told those Pharisees I am before Abraham was I am hallelujah amen and except you believe that I am you'll die in your sins here was Jesus Christ Hallelujah catch me is when we have a need we only see God in our need and God because he made a covenant with Abraham's people people he said I will come down when the iniquity has come up and he come down cuz I hear the crying of my people why wasn't they had a need amen they were being oppressed they were being beaten down by because pharaoh and his army so that because Israel had a need and he had already strengthened uh Abraham Isaac and Jacob now was a time to reveal this personal God as Jehovah I am that I am and then when they begin to see this was the Jehovah of power amen the Jehovah of Salvation the Jehovah who will lead them and guide them and take them out that is the same Jehovah well therefore this Jehovah was found in the Old Testament when they had a need is that right then he had seven compound names all in needs righteousness and so forth but then when it come to Salvation for sinners amen he come in the name Jesus amen then Jesus is the Supreme compound name Jesus Christ and then is in Christ and Christ is I am that I am for he told William Bram the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament amen so then when we have a need he's all we need Jesus Christ and in him we find all that we need but we must get to a place where we are surrendered where we really need him then he will appear to you and tell you I am that I am what is your need amen amen this is the same Jehovah Jehovah they even took the J uh h o v ah which is a a Hebrew word and jahash is also a Hebrew word but the word Jesus is a Greek word so the same Jehovah jashua way is the same Jesus in Greek amen and they took the first part of it j e which means a Jehovah and the SS is salvation amen Jehovah is our Salvation which is Jesus amen so that's why looking for the Blessed hope the Glorious appearing of our great god Jehovah and our Savior Jesus Christ praise God which is the great Jehovah he is the same savior in Jesus Christ and if we look to him friends he is our need therefore whatever Israel had need of Jehovah met it with power is that right and he let him out amen and therefore Jesus Christ even told his disciples in St John 16 you have not ask anything of me because in my name but henceforth you shall ask in my name amen cuz you're going to have a need and I'm the same Jehovah you see me Thomas you see the father I am I was I am before Abraham was praise God Jehovah means um Jehovah means the uh because our eternity and which is present is past present and future is now if if you read a book here like say because reading the book and we the book is about yesterday and also present and what's going to happen in the book and if we come to that book we get right into it present tense whether the events happen yet yest today or whether they going to happen because next day but as you read the book you're in that book amen and as you see God he's present you was with him before and you're going to be with him because down the road and with him now but the Bible says now are we the sons of God right now we are and as far as as the great Jehovah is concerned we are now the sons of God amen amen so therefore we was with him before we're going to be with him over there in glory and we're with him now he can't lose you over there amen he's only waiting for us to come to him when we have the need do you have a need this morning well Jesus of the New Testament is the same Jehovah of the Old Testament Jehovah nii or Jehovah RFI and so forth the same one and when Israel God only revealed himself to Abraham Jacob and Isaac as almighty God the satisfier the uh because a breasted one but when it came time for a power and deliverance he revealed as Jehovah CU they would have a need cuz we cannot save ourselves so the Great Name the personal name of Jehovah was a peculiar because they had a covenant with God but the Gentiles only knew him as God that's all only God all through the Old Testament but in this day the great God has sent his son Jesus Christ the Savior For All Mankind amen and there's God's grace so therefore God has revealed himself to us as the grace of God the Savior Jesus Christ and this is the Supreme compound name Jesus Christ which is a Jehovah Savior Jesus Christ do you love him friends amen praise our God so then we um seeing God the purpose of this life seeing God in the face of Jesus Christ that face was marred and twisted but that face had the glory of God in it and that's why in our sufferings and so forth God gets the glory out of it amen praise the lord well we know that this is the way um God would bring us through many strange ways and so forth we know that something is fixing to happen we all know that but uh the Holy Spirit I believe is trying to get us to a place to raise up move up one octave High higher and come away from the things of the world there are those in here that have walked away and you know you have you're not the same as you was in' 63 and 64 and 65 there are those who went aside but the Lord Jesus loves you this morning and love he's trying to woo you back to himself trying to bring you back to that first state that we was walking here with the Lord here and that's what he is is trying to do and the Seven compound names have all come in into that one comp Supreme compound named Jesus so therefore if you see God you see him as a need if you really know if really admit because you're needy then you can see God Amen because he reveals himself to those who are needy as Jehovah or Jesus amen amen and he's all that we need s somebody come and play the P let's turn to page 93 I will do you want to see him oh I want to see him praise our God when I think about the things that's going on and um I believe was brother brandham said on page 66 in uh seven Church ages as he studied the scriptures and prayed and waited on God before he went into the church ages the Lord revealed to him a Hebrews 13 8 that that was the Keystone to the Bible Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that is the Keystone and I believe with all my heart that Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever is looking for people this morning that can really die out to all these things here of the Flesh and the world and deny these things here and really see God never mind service so much see service other words if you can find the answer to life in Christ the word you can be in the most obscure point of this globe and if you got the answer to today's problems the world will be the path to your door to find the answer that's absolutely right if you got it cuz the world came to William bram's door by telephone by because airplane by bus by car they be a path to his door cuz he had it and he had Christ and many times he said because I don't know the scriptures but I know the author amen amen I know the author see so therefore many take the Bible and like in uh because academic because academic way they know so many scriptures and they know this and they know that but do they know the author that's the thing and will and brandom knew the author because he uh desired to fellowship with God forever more God then this morning if as we know that the Dynamics is ready to come down we won't have in our mind that we got to have this great power and so forth many here or many throughout God's Church put more emphasis on Service as long as they in service they can treat their wife or their husband or their friends any kind of way but they're in service uh-uh you'll never see him like that you see him as him being the soul means the soul in so therefore there'll be many in service Lord I cast out Devils I did many wonderful Works Lord I was right in the bride doing all kind of thing he said I don't even know you you see CU you never sought me out so therefore I'm up here because up here preaching this is a gift see this is a because God's Gift up here but I got to se God for myself I must meet the Lord myself and that is my desire to meet him cuz after we we finished here The Works follow see but if you meet Jesus Christ as the only source then they'll come looking for you amen praise God so let us because I remember this here and the young children that are here there's only one thing out here that is Jesus Christ and many of them they don't know that see God hasn't a revealer because to their hearts and we understand that that's why father and mother are to pray and to have their house so Christlike that it'll be such an atmosphere in that home that that young person in there can't walk into any room but seeing Jesus in the home and then you'll see a difference you'll see a change but it's up to Mommy and Daddy that they live this life that they present the token see me now and that they uh have a yearning and a burning because a desire for Jesus Christ but what you have if you have if you come in here at a church and you serve God and here and go home and then uh revert back to Old worldly radio programs and everything else what is your child going to do they're looking at you to see Jesus Christ you see so therefore live friend cuz you can't fool nobody you can walk in here but how are you walking outside of here you see is every uh uh motive every is everything turned because toward Jesus Christ This is a weary hour We're weary we're tired we know that even as president said that the people's Spirits are they are tired they are frustrated and we know that uh uh these people here they are feeling the pull of the spirit we know that Christ is fixing to pour forth the anointing up on the seeds all of us know that see but just make sure that you know what you're looking for if you want to see him praise the Lord you praise His name you know friends when Adam and Eve sent in the Garden of Eden and then when they put on their their man-made thick leaves The Showdown came when the presence of God came they ran away cuz they knew that that couldn't bring them into God's presence and that and that same strain is in man today he knows you know this morning that if certain things are going on that you cannot bring it into God's presence God required blood and it was that Bloody dripping uh lamb skin as Adam began to stand before God the blood from that skin running down his legs that justified Adam to stand in God's presence what I'm trying to bring you this morning by the grace of God is that same presence is coming down again and the little foolishness is and putting God second put your home your job your mothers your fathers your friends you put them before the Lord that will not stand I don't care whether you're a pastor or Elder Deacon or Minister whoever you are that's only service that's service see that should be second but the first motive the first love should be a burning yearning desire for Jesus Christ that's the first one those he said he said fill those that sigh and cry after the Abominations of filthiness in the city in the Church of Jerusalem and therefore uh God he commended the saints of God there in Ephesus because they tried those Liars they hated that filth to be in the church so therefore those of you in here this morning that hate to see your sisters that was walking with their heart soul and mind in the Lord and all of a sudden here in the end time the last year or so the devil just take them back out in the world you should hate that and and because brothers that are walking contrary to the Lord I've seen a hair that was walking in all that the new how and maybe it was some old a carnal worldly woman outside or something somebody who's an unbeliever or something if that has pulled you away brother come back to God and repent for he's here this morning sister brother whoever you are that here this morning my heart got a burden on this morning to tell you to come back to God you cannot bring these things before his presence he's here this morning to warn you to exalt you this is what I'm standing up here for trying to bring a message of Love of Jesus Christ that this is his glory this is his Gra this is his way to restore you back to that unbroken Fellowship that he had with Adam there's no other way all these little little because of petty things you may be a deacon in here a minister or Pastor whoever you are that won't take you to heaven no sir it is your attitude in your love for God that's why we even had to rebuke and different ones may stand around we have a tape out here we should all be here because trying to hear from God there are some who would because walk around up and down think well maybe because they can hear at home or something like this here we come come here to be one one mind one Accord to hear from God see that is why because we are here we all know that something is fixing to happen we all know that this all around this this country around this world here many have fallen but the grace of almighty God has been here in New York City to keep us from falling Hallelujah the only wise God the only true God the only one who could Jesus Christ the word has kept us from falling here amen that is the only word that I have to give to you I cannot Pat flesh I must wound you I have to wound you I'm your friend I call yourself call you my friend Hallelujah and I'll bring the word I wound you deep with the word but that same sword will cut and heal coming out Hallelujah so friends I cry out and be you this morning return back to your first loveall Jesus Christ the way he filled your minds back in 63 4 and 5 through there and your hearts and your souls and some have gone astray the World slipped in and maybe you in service and so and so and you're doing this you're doing that I don't care whether it's tapes or books or whatever it is that means nothing to God get on fire for God Amen and brother you'll see a church uh it'll turn New York City upside down here if he can get each one in here the families in your homes and praying and seeking God you'll see your children turn around to God and you and also because of your family's there clean out your house get the filing out of your house and so forth and make and make Make Way for prepare the way for the coming of the Lord for he's coming forth friends that's my burden this morning to tell you and though he has to bring someone in sickness and trials and whatever it is you know what God's doing here now he's revealing things to you because he loves you he don't have to tell us nothing he don't have to to reveal one sin to us hallelujah he can let us go on blind just walk on blind blind leading the blind but because he loves us Jesus Christ the Supreme Jehovah of the Old Testament the Jesus of the New Testament here he stands do you have a need this morning Jesus can meet every need you have Hallelujah he is all of the seven compound of Jehovah's in one Jesus he's the great God Our Savior Jesus Christ and he'll meet every need and he's going to meet every need for this world is going to squeeze us out of here we're going to be squeezed out of the world that's right you see it so therefore the hour is short friends let us be zelous for God and come back to
