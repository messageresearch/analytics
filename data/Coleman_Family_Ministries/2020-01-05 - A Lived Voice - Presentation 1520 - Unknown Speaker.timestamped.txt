[1:42] when we add it to our faith
[1:44] righteousness and godliness and faith
[1:47] and so forth he kept adding to it till
[1:49] we got seven things and the seventh in
[1:51] was love which is God that's how you mix
[1:54] the individually cap semen seals you
[1:55] with the Holy Spirit then if that be so

[2:04] now the cat stone comes the cap off the
[2:08] church does the thunders mean that my
[2:12] brethren serves is that where we're at
[2:26] so you might have look at this message

[3:37] you soon brother branham praise God
[3:39] because your message Amen has kept

[3:45] and they're holding to your promise of
[3:48] dynamics today mechanics
[3:50] praise God we're a wonderful glorious
[3:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost where they

[3:58] that blood coin right into the Rainbows
[4:01] praise got a many what up the promise
[4:04] look at the smiling faces praise God
[4:07] hey man put you down for huh amen praise
[4:13] God
[4:14] so we salute that message here and the
[4:17] best way we can do it is to believe that
[4:19] message and now it's time for the spirit
[4:22] to fall upon that seed and also today
[4:25] January 6 1991 this is we celebrating
[4:29] our 28th anniversary of this church
[4:32] being an in existence where we started
[4:35] January 6 1962 this is the 28th
[4:39] anniversary
[4:39] of standing for the inspiration of
[4:42] Malachi 4 7 seal message 28 years a time
[4:46] of life God a man we've been right here
[4:50] what life it's always been life in New
[4:52] York City praise God always been a place
[4:55] for people to come the weary praise God
[4:58] and come to the oasis in the desert amen
[5:00] of this wilderness here so on December
[5:03] 30th 1962 I was there and I heard the
[5:07] message serves is this the time after
[5:10] heard that stirring prophetic message I
[5:12] was in all cotton know what the seven
[5:15] thunders was then the Holy Spirit spoke
[5:18] to me these words are the final words of
[5:21] my heart start your church January 6
[5:24] 1963 and so we started I believe brother
[5:29] hunt preached on Esther note I believe
[5:32] that's right I think he did on Esther
[5:34] and ha Kinya service put away Vashti
[5:37] because she wouldn't come to him when he
[5:38] called and so we started with Esther
[5:41] amen praise God and with Mordecai my
[5:45] like hour for telling us how to dress so
[5:47] we would be ready in 1991 praise God
[5:50] Oh hallelujah thine the glory praise God
[5:56] so I thought I'll just read that back on
[5:58] page 47 that's what I come from that's
[6:00] the inspiration that really had me
[6:02] stirred that night amen
[6:04] he said it might be closer than you
[6:06] think it is has got me scared he had me
[6:08] scared
[6:09] oh I haven't done enough where we had
[6:12] time shall be no more he announced that
[6:15] time is over what happens what happens
[6:17] could that be so now brethren seriously
[6:19] think if it is then the pyramid is
[6:22] capped by the seven thunders oh my god
[6:25] my god they don't even understand it and
[6:29] have we thank God for the inspiration to
[6:32] start a church under the inspiration of
[6:34] the seven thunders praise God and then
[6:39] just on the inspiration then he drops
[6:42] down and reveals it way in 74 1962
[6:46] praise guy just speaks you believe it
[6:48] see and you go in that inspiration of it
[6:50] and then take a quiz shows of affection
[6:52] and
[6:53] look at their and they're a little bit
[6:54] down there right on here precept upon
[6:56] precept a little here a little there a
[6:57] man but just believe Amen see and then
[7:02] the pyramid is capped by the seven
[7:04] thunders well that's very clear we got
[7:07] to build a pyramid such of a perfect man
[7:09] in the people's heart first before they
[7:11] can be capped by the thunders I'm oh hey
[7:15] man and you got a promise page three or
[7:17] four the fourth seal wait to them seven
[7:20] thunders uttered his voices well you
[7:22] gotta be sealed by the word first and
[7:23] the word is the pyramid once you seal
[7:27] with them promises in there then seven
[7:29] thundering voices can inspire you the
[7:36] towers closed Iraq is over there it's
[7:39] only a prelude to the Armageddon and the
[7:42] Prophet said the bride will go in a
[7:45] ratchet before Armageddon praise God so
[7:50] I thank God for that promise ain't
[7:52] nothing left brother amen so mean our
[7:57] pavers are only capped by the seven
[7:59] thunders you remember that pair of balls
[8:00] you got get a little inspiration of it
[8:02] to start reaching that so people this
[8:04] somebody will be ready to be camped is
[8:07] that what I did wrong because I preached
[8:11] for somebody in New York to be ready to
[8:13] be kept by the thunders and took the
[8:16] Statue of proof man and put them seeds
[8:18] in your heart like it cursed for that
[8:20] well I have to be cursed for it amen you
[8:23] remember the pyramid message it's the
[8:25] capstone they are what did it do the
[8:29] Holy Spirit capped off the individual
[8:31] sealed it when we add to our faith
[8:33] righteousness and godliness and faith
[8:35] see what I mean if you don't preach it
[8:37] how in the world can you be kept if
[8:40] somebody don't preach it how can we here
[8:43] except we have a preacher
[8:47] does step out on faith and be cursin
[8:50] revile is safe to preach safe messages
[8:54] in the message for 25 years but they
[8:56] aren't is now there's no anointing with
[8:58] them they were safe amen
[9:02] you gotta step out be called crazy and
[9:06] then you're safe with Christ in the
[9:10] church Manaus we stand here with full
[9:13] faith and confidence even so come Lord
[9:15] Jesus knowing that nothing can touch us
[9:19] not a plague can come pious
[9:23] hallelujah oh praise God we kept adding
[9:28] to it until we got seven things and the
[9:30] seventh one was love which is God that's
[9:33] how he makes the individual he capped
[9:35] him in seals and what the Holy Ghost
[9:37] then if that be so he has got seven
[9:41] churches that he has had seven mysteries
[9:43] that has been sounded away and they
[9:45] fought for the ring bang if they had to
[9:47] fight for each mystery how much more do
[9:49] you have to fight for all the mysteries
[9:51] to get it to the people
[9:54] brother brands revealed every mystery we
[9:57] had to fight a man for 17 years Nephi
[10:01] soul he's got there has been sounded
[10:04] away in a fourth war to bring back and
[10:06] now the headstone comes to cap off the
[10:09] church though the thunders mean that my
[10:11] brethren serves that where we are our
[10:22] my inspiration for all these years here
[10:25] is coming from adoption by on page 8
[10:29] so emphasis here settlers like Joshua
[10:33] positionally you know this judgement
[10:36] after crossing over the land taking the
[10:38] land and he divided the land ephraim and
[10:40] manasseh here just went over here gap
[10:43] benjamin there he divided the land and
[10:45] Josh were not knowing this but my
[10:47] inspiration the letter the Holy Spirit
[10:49] after being into the Promised Land give
[10:51] each man his promise and exactly what
[10:54] the Holy Spirit promised through the
[10:55] birth back there now how that God has
[11:00] said in the church through labor pains
[11:02] oh they get tremendous sometimes I
[11:04] remember this now it's on the tape this
[11:06] morning page 12 13 and 14 and then you
[11:09] don't understand me when the church is
[11:12] groaning under the persecution of the
[11:14] outside world breathe on the Lord Jesus
[11:17] that the problems the Holy Ghost is just
[11:19] as real to us as it was the Pentecost
[11:21] how the air it is labor pains how they
[11:24] groan and cry and their labor pains how
[11:29] brother Coleman had a revelation of
[11:30] perfection how he groaned
[11:33] cried travail sixty four five six seven
[11:39] seventies eighties groaning travailing
[11:42] you didn't understand him because God
[11:45] was using the body to groan
[11:49] [Applause]
[11:53] trying to label things but when they
[11:55] were born and positionally born into the
[11:58] kingdom of God born birth faith
[12:01] positionally born charity stealing your
[12:04] for adoption
[12:05] you got it into the king of God then the
[12:09] Holy Ghost has said in the church some
[12:11] apostles prophets teachers pastors some
[12:14] evangelists then he's given to the
[12:16] speaker with tones interpretation
[12:19] knowledge wisdom gifts of healing all
[12:21] kinds of miracles and so definitely the
[12:24] healing and also brother Graham said
[12:26] when I'm against all gonna has religion
[12:27] he said what is the greater gift
[12:30] other than healing he said wisdom the
[12:33] wisdom of Revelation to put the Word of
[12:35] God together to show the church where
[12:36] the head then comes the hard case is
[12:40] praying for the sick when you find out
[12:42] where you are you may pray for the sick
[12:46] [Applause]
[12:55] men didn't know who Christ was it wasn't
[12:58] sure they know he was anointed but maybe
[13:01] was hearing my answer all promised
[13:03] anointed word Amen hallelujah and what's
[13:09] on Peter he back slid later on son this
[13:13] is not on brother Coleman he never said
[13:15] it he's got a revelation like Peter got
[13:18] a revelation so hear me on tape the son
[13:23] this is not on me the son is Jesus
[13:26] Christ hear me and if you pick up this
[13:31] tape brother the seven thunders is Jesus
[13:33] Christ's upon the raca this revelation
[13:37] I'll peel my spoken word bride and
[13:42] she'll help us sayeth the Lord
[13:45] hallelujah
[13:47] you may be seated not a confession him
[13:51] being the son of God because they knew
[13:53] he was a son of God Peter just said it
[13:55] but what it was the revelation had been
[14:00] revealed from heaven that's what it is
[14:05] and the thunders will be revealed from
[14:07] heaven the people sitting in here
[14:12] they'll get quickened and filled with
[14:14] the Holy Ghost hallelujah that's what it
[14:19] is it'll change them hallelujah it'll

[14:26] that they cannot even see the kingdom
