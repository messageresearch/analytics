26th Thank You Benigno and go up there and told me to take the same message and break it down which I did the word pride prisoners of love unto the Lord and lo here is seed for you and ye shall sold the land and the devil tried to stomp it out of here and I had to come back and play the tape twice because if the church missed it set to him a second in September 9th with the other things going on

like and then you start getting the word so the devil will see to it that this happened and that happened and this happened is that happened to deaf devil's business the pile displaced up with all kind of junk amen Laura head he told me he told me to continue with the inspiration from July 8 and 2 he told me to take two more messages out of there and preach one October 7th and possibly the 21st any man that's what he told me so less from endeavoring to do today from the same inspiration amen but this he was a dream here brother Paloma I was looking through my cell my affection and this just fell out the other day here and it's 1974 right after that the seventh under revival we had in New York City and on Tuesday December 31st dream brother Coleman was teaching the entire church was before him there were two feels exactly like the same science exactly the same science one on his right and one on his left he was speaking by planting seeds pointing to the feet on the right he said you see the seeds were planted here but the conditions just were not just right and everyone looked on that field they've seen to be surprised because it was totally barren then brother Coleman turn in pointing to the other field to his left he said the seed was planted here in all conditions was perfect always a good ground give it see everything was done just right and everyone turned to look they were amazed to see huge crops it stood very tall and they occupied every part of that land so that you couldn't even see the dirt anymore it seemed this crop was mature now listen seconds message and almost ready for his harvest so may God make you almost ready for the harness praise God thank you brother Bellomo I held on to that that's exactly what I did from the seventh under inspiration I caught it and I got the seeds and I planted them seeds from the seventh under inspiration Malachi fourth message that's all what I've been doing if you had read the same books you know what I was doing see the word is the word sees the Prophet says I come as for his riches sita and elijah comes he will plant the seed of the entire Bible from Genesis through revelation then if he goes into the Bible and pulls messages out that is the spoken word this Bible has a spoken word that right in Malachi and for the Son of man in him we'll pull the spoken word and then speak it through Malachi for smile then the spoken word revealed by the word in the prophet yes I'm saying the spoken word from James the revelation is revealed by the Son of Man in the Prophet for the spoken word reveal by the word reveals the word then this is a reveal word then this is now our word see and these ought to see that are planted and these seeds were to bring you down to a certain day when you were supposed to go back to the Bible other words no fall hitting women you understand back to the Bible other words you're hanging over hell by one word back to the Bible but this brings you back you get so oriented with this that's all you can think of as this then I that's a that's a feel that I plan on the left they're the ones on the left-hand side for the Bellomo a huge crop praise God they almost ready they were right but see when June you may be seated in June 30 you become your right but you're still wet so you're not ready for the harvest just yet the garner so it needs a hot July Sun to come down and fake you out think I want all the lust for money the lust for the world the love for business the lust for this the lust for that take it out of you from today on Oh hallelujah glory to God hallelujah a man may be seated so that's what I did for the day I'm trying to endeavor to preach one of those lands to messages amen see this is my little seventh on the CD vinyl amen I believe it's C time Brad time and the seat is right for the harvest but it's still a little wet seize up a few days in July from about you I first saw you I told you many times the farmer does not listen the Lord of the harvest the Holy Ghost does not even come out into the fields because it's green why would he walk out there the Holy Ghost itself when he know that's his seed the wheat is a seed and he prescribed before the Sun in the world that they had to go through certain stages so while you wanna look for the dynamics way back when you couldn't even take it you wouldn't you neither well yet you want dynamics you haven't given your heart over to the Lord yet every part of you your heart soul mind body everything you don't want no dynamics you want some sanctification Bray's about you Harper's got the brother man say you don't know the power of God you just know the blessings of God when Augustine comes in there praise God you left knees praise God will you visit by an angel okay but you're laid out there praise God you may be seated praise God amen so you got it now but then when the sea begins to get it right I pictured this whole world and somewhere and then some feels a little bit here the other fields and some fields have a whole lot of tears in it because the the pastors didn't get rid of tears you can't drink them out you got a priest work hard enough where they won't grow in it you said don't pull them out so you don't pull them out you piece of word haul enough to make a run out so you keep your field full of wheat maybe us then why preach there huh I don't want no tears around here praise God I don't want to empty gloom heads Oh holla get over there heading guys listen friend I have even got started yet and even hit this hit praise God amen glory amen okay now you got it now doing the big field lay across the we're all the way to New Zealand Australia this is heal and don't worry brother Kelvin put your shoulders back stick your chest out lift your head up you made it thank you brother praise God amen the seven thunders here in New Zealand praise God well praise God so the farmer the the husband man comes down into the field when the seat is right see I'm gonna give you a quote for that see when it's right then he begins to pluck see he's looking for you know all the wet ways the little wetness is little in the seed and it needs the hot Sun to dry hot and needs to be a shirtless from them amen it needs to be stripped like Moses was like Paul was like Joseph was trip before you become a love slave and have power before you do that by adding to your pain virtue and knowledge in the world goes out of the lust goes out and you coming up the ladder now you're being skipped you all praise God either keep it my commandment I shall manifest myself to him at that day you shall know that my father's a mean I am the father you and me and I on you what day this day praise God hallelujah glory to come amen Amy may be seated don't you want the husband man to come down here today begin to pluck you it like this head huh maybe he's here glory now that's the season I've posted a little short Brad time week time see time harvest time low short period which is plucking plucking a man we weighed pants by the neck way up the road I'll show you on there well we had you are stones to be pulled out of this mess your stones to be fitted to the capstone praise God hallelujah may be seated when the seat is right for the harvest but it's still little win and now we need to powerful hot Sun of July to thoroughly dry out the seed and get it ready for the corner cemetery pages page 363 the bride church will mature and her right Ness now I'll have to say a word you're right miss I'll have to go to your house I'll have to get on the phone I would look at you you're right this shall be an identification her identification with her Lord by means of a word you say I'm right by the colon were wonderful then therefore but the word will tell

and then don't wanna make you leap over walls and huh plus take everything when you see it duck tail like that appreciate by faith back until I ain't you didn't get it today didn't get it go up to Canada may be seated and I'll kind of picture out my brother Gabriel and he said uh since they had a dream up there you were singing across the bridge he was in the pulpit in the pulpit brother Frank and brother brother Luke was there as a meetin a man and then the both choirs up they had on white wings he said there's your sign you judgement should now go back and judge the church on August 28th

and I knew where I was at Malachi for said before you can come into a full power and be a love slave Amen see where my hand that's right oh the bride as well as talking about here the right church will mature that's what it is and her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the war in other words from here on out to prove you all right it'll be by the word I will come to you can you take the word if I say repent I'll make it right when you say what you see because this happened because this is that well you're not taking a word you're going around the word make excuses you have come back to the Bible that's what I mean you're fooling with you unless you want to repent I'll forgive and if you don't forget but God didn't forgive you you became young since that's the word I don't know it well they get it in I hit see glory may be seated now you got it now you're not here for me now other words you're I didn't have a case with your Lord to prove you all right we'll be by the word how you identify with the word this is the word season Paul the prisoner Malachi foretold that God is looking for prisons of law that's why appreciate the first one to be harness to the word by the Holy Spirit and pull Malachi awesome message in the presence of the Gentiles do you want to pull his message in the message we're all kind of false interpretations in the message but do you want to be one of those love slaves that's right we're really going to prove what Malachi for mess is all about amen you said before you become into full power may be seated and be a love slave you have to be shaved off then present it you're ready to be shaved I'll meet your sisters now it's what you hear you pee ball hitter than Amen but you already have everything shaved off you so praise God Paul Moller examples Malachi 4 gave Malachi 4 also gave Joseph as an example being shaved off fresh and didn't give him power or full authority and on so I saved these quotes for I said he said whole Joseph Bank for later on so I didn't read it on August 25th about Joseph he said that's for another message amen so I'll go back to it amen Paula prisoner page the 17th to quicken

November 10 1964 the top foundation inspiration was revealed Jacob Riis Joseph perfection and I knew what was around me this ain't it pray has got all this mess around here uh-huh so he gave me a vision I couldn't stop all that stuff around here all that mud down there with the lily bread he's got it that ain't it I'm getting out of here praise God little Joseph perfection coming praise God and so that was a at the top of the foundation inspiration then on September 20 1974 the bodywork inspiration the seven four seven thunders the cemetery change that was a bodywork inspiration then on December 25th 1988 the top of the foundation revelation come again and he's smoking on 23rd he said as luffa released justification as Wesley relief sanctification as the Pentecostal released the Holy Ghost so we'll Joseph perpetual released the Holy Ghost himself and I waited to see what happened total perfection headstone capstone releases the Holy Ghost itself upon the bride the dynamics to the mechanics all praise come do you get it now amen got one testimony for you here I want steal steal it away here may be seated praise got what happened to brother Nathaniel coy Cole on December 28th what happened on December 25th when I preach Amen changing to the glory of Joseph's profession from Jacob grace now there you caught that and I couldn't figure out why was he the only one that was baptized as hello it should be more because doula perfection releases the Holy Ghost itself I couldn't figure out why was he the only one and just Thursday here the Lord told me he coming to phone him and I said what I put on the tape with that on January 1st where I heard a read Frank McIntyre and him and Philip Gomez the testimony brother Paul and brother Paul caught in his testimonies the Lord we thank you he said that the Joseph's affection releases the Holy Ghost itself brother Paul Griffin courting a man that's what happened so therefore I said but Nathaniel I asked him Friday I said now you got to tell me two things here I said you didn't say anything when you testimony about what what you got out of the jaws of affection message he said oh yeah okay so that's it right right now for me okay their pastor : god bless you I'll write this letter to express my thanks to the Lord for the message that he gave you Christmas Day December 25th 1988 changing to the glory of Joseph perfection from the Gloria Jacob grace I would like to give you a little background on what was going on and how the Lord was dealing with me before your message was spoken when the Lord saved me on October 23rd when the Holy Spirit poured out in 88 I was so overwhelmed with the fact that God loved me enough to save me that joy would just bubble up inside and I could hardly contain myself and it still happens to this day every time I think about it but through all that joy I did not know what my goal on this earth was for so he said why he says I was on WoW otherwise why was I want his earning all the purpose for being on this earth sure I still had all the joy the person could ever have but when I sat in the psychology class and the teacher the students would be pondering on the theme why are we on this earth so they're trying to take it out they'll never figure it out so and brother Nathanael said therefore when he heard the message he caught the revelation of Joseph's perception why he was put here and he grabbed it and he was anointed he realized that he was put here to be perfect my God praise God thank you I realize I was put here to be perfect in other words I caught the inspiration of Jacob enjoy the perfection then three days later December 28th Wednesday night may be seated the message was a the bridegroom cometh to him and brother Paul Menton lobby right there and he would steal away God baptized me with the Holy Ghost brother Coleman talked about joy my joy increased 100 fold over he had joy to be saved on October 23rd but now you got the Holy Ghost a hundredfold the joy to know that God loved me so much in spite of all what I had said he said a lot of awful things and done that he even considered that he even considered and thought of me as his bride why me I don't know but I am sure thankful that he chose me so in closing that was the background on what was going on and how the Lord was dealing with me up to the time of your December 25th message I'll tell you am I alone I knew that it has got to be more people so what there's something wrong and I've never asked him then he didn't say it so I know the Lord just hid it away until I asked him the other day here at this men's came forth now I had a thought the true confession of the Seventh Seal and I put descriptions everything down and I went and starting it and pimps on the right and went the whole thing with this way but in the beginning to leave two pages in the front you might need them I thought might need them then I've got to the end I thought I had to tear that page over there and put down where my scriptures was and so forth so it's different set of scriptures but the whole thing came by inspiration just sitting down right now they call Nathaniel he has four like home and I want to let you know that you have a friend well thank you for that oh man God may God richly bless you and may you receive a healing your brother in Christ Italian quick oh well praise God amen amen what's he catch chose the perfection and aim and the revelation what about you today Church maybe seize it I'm finished now praise God amen finally made it what about you Church do you believe that you are finally here ah change it to the glorious total perfection from take up grace and you are fitted into that slot call the Holy Spirit then souls of perfection releases the whole ethos itself to you today if you believe that because this is the blending time in that Holy Spirit slot ok I have to give you a quote for that a man this is now remember remember this is a blending time now ok you got that praise God alright now you know that we oughta head slaps I can skip that amen on this a Manticore turn on the light amen on page 36 am an eternal light oh when a man in the foundry is making a bell got a certain tone he has to put in it when he set in his mold and pouring his on his iron he puts in so much brass so I steal so much copper why he knows just exactly how much to put in to make to give it the right tone don't don't don't it was the right tone amen praise God and and that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had to put in so much Luther so much Methodist so much pent Arian so much Pentecost into it but what does he come out with his own reflection why is it just like the pyramid message you see is heaping right up to his coming to the minority for the headstone the minister Jesus Christ on earth has been the same as a men see he had or he can't come to it see just like the head to defeat the head defeats it not the head but the head packs the feet or makes the feet tell the way to go you get it beautifully it's the light of the our justification served his time and justification on the Luther that then it had to become sanctification through Wesley plaintiff occasion had service turn White's to come to the baptism the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has served his time you hear I'm saying now it's already service time until see until the Holy Spirit which is only one God lens into the church so that little slot is blending in time you will actually begin to blend into eternity Oh God you're gonna blend into God and God's gonna blend into you and some of you from become like God do you get it the blending in town and the festive the hallways perhaps service time to the Holy Spirit is only one God blends into the church or the church into Christ that makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what he promised hand the Bible might now watch you might not believe it I can't make you do that I'm more responsible for the word see you might not believe what I'm saying I can't make you believe it I'm more responsible to preach it maybe some of you don't aspire to be that high don't know why don't I believe it hallelujah see because this is a blending time in the Holy Spirit slunt until the Holy Spirit listen to the church oh my you said here but the watch revival but this policeman he tipped his hand to sir they said Whizzer what you violent serves the well she Bibles hell in here in his heart that's it he was the well survive old God if we can only only understanding we are the reflection of Jesus Christ His Word made manifest you are the reflection of his words see where the Russian viable what buildings it in he said sirs in the heart he was the Welsh reviled that's right and what about a Joseph's perfection revival where will it be at in the heart glory and today the church ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon the earth because I live you live also and my life will be in you the work that I do you do also see the church has got to get into that place and he promised it would do it and it will it's got to come to that way so you see that's what takes place we got to be that way there you are Church amen do all the reflection of the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen praise cannot believe today as we stand on our feet I pleaded lucemon release justification and Wesley release sanctification many councilmen release the better the whole egos in the gift and we we have finally here at the top of the foundation where Joseph perfection a capstone word pulls out by our revelation a bride stone are the layouts here to be fitted to be a fitted stone to the capstone and the Holy Ghost itself is released upon her and comes right down in perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself and she strips herself of everything hanging on her and she adds to a faith seven virtues then charity the power comes upon her and makes her a word pride prison of love unto the zone to be harness to the word by the Holy Ghost itself and she manifests the message Jesus Christ to pull the gospel Joseph's perfection releases the holy goes itself to make to the profession a word see manifested in good ground to be the reflection of Jesus Christ here on this earth the reflection is a perfection God amen amen now I'll tell you some praise God a man a revelation all the way up and right down to brother Nathanael and nothing happened in a cos of what this guy I don't understand and then he told me that was nourishment I said oh brother Nathanael was a sign that Joseph of fecha releases the Holy Ghost itself because the psychology was trying to clap trying to figure it out what are we here for how do we get here amen and then he come in here and it pondering it is Joseph's perfection perfect perfection perfect male on the area like like Adam wasn't beginning oh praise God but in the sang had to get a revelation God prepared him with a question in his heart from school and God answered it here on Christmas that was a big turkey for him amen a big dinner but now if you believe what has just been spoken I don't know I don't know how to say this you don't need no more signs are you getting it other words just as Luther preached justification everybody was in justification then the elected seat was in that atmosphere and they receive justification and same thing when Wesley and the Pentecostal couldn't help it if they were elected four blocks from Azusa Street they get off the streetcar and a power God knock him down why cuz it was in the atmosphere of Jacob grace or whatever now are we in Joseph's perfection but in you don't have to stress them all you are predestinated to be sealed Oh hallelujah praise not praise cut into your natural faith will come a spiritual baptism and now we'll come in there furth you and now it will be given to you and you will climb that pyramid all the way up to the top all the world will be gone all the left will be going praise God you'll be skipped up everything in this world then charity will come up come upon you and you'll be like Jesus to be like Jesus Oh hallelujah to be like Jesus much won't be like Jesus and they won't be like Jesus praise cuff buzzer we just think you understand how we're here question is but you don't have to get a question she's already is this is here otherwise I'm trying to tell you as you're singing you can be sealed in the basket in the basement in the mother's room is here the whole eagle himself and can write down imperfection and back to the Bible again to manifest itself may God bless you [Music] oh I [Applause] you be lucky go jump to be like [Music] Oh [Music] I Oh [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] Oh just to be liked hariya
