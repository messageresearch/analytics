faith heavenly father bless thy people tonight and may you confirm the message with signs wonders and miracles we pray and we ask it in Jesus name and his sake amen amen you may be seated oh we're certainly happy tonight to be gathered here in the house of the Lord under this uh pyramid villing amen looks like a a pyramid to me I think it's fitting in this hour to be sitting in the pyramid praise the Lord amen and so we're certainly happy to be here tonight and we certainly thank brother L for those gracious words for um as brother B always said praise the Lord rather receive a bouquet now than a wreath on Your Grave so we thank you Lord for every kind word that is spoken for the prophet of God did exhort us to say something nice and say something good amen so we try to say something nice and good to one another and you know what that does it brings the spirit of the Lord on the scene and all the old doubt and funny Spirits move away because they don't like anything nice and good Jesus loves it amen praise the Lord so we thank God for that and now I wanted to say that I feel that we're looking at ES tonight the bride that was called out of Lea because aashi uh in type and Esther or the lean Church she refused the headship see and therefore he had to put her away and he called Esther amen Esther's sitting here tonight praise the Lord and the unic they're sitting behind me and they've been feeding Esther praise God for them amen and now we realize that when Esther was called that a ha guy he was a chamber in I believe and what the Bible said says that Esther listened to everything that Hagi told her to wear and to use that would please the king for Hagi a feels a type of the Holy Ghost and he knew just what the king wanted so Esther listened to Hagi and then the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit has revealed to us just what the king loves and that is the word to be in obedience to the word of God and then uh when Esther went out the king just loved her and he put the the crown up on her head and then she received a headship the word that uh vashi turned down and but a Time came uh I believe it was in Exodus uh exod 4 the fourth chapter where um uh hmon was a foot and he was getting ready to move against uh God's people and there was one who was trained and called for the job to be ready to go out and stand against a hmon and the world Cel in them and that was Esther praise the Lord and then but Esther was safe in the Kingdom there she knew knew she was the bride but morai he exalted her that there's yet other people there and that's the way we feel going after the loss amen and then Esther was told to go into the king and it was death to go in unless the king called you in there see and to come into His presence but thank God that God has made a way for us to walk into his presence through this bloody message of Malachi 4 praise God as the blood Aton has laid out the way we and Esther had courage to go in here for she said for such a time this how do you know that you aren't called tonight for such a time as this do you believe friend that you were called for such a time as this this very hour to be able to walk into the king's presence and when you she walked in there she put on her royal apparel and the crown on the head she walked into his presence he was so moved when he saw how beautiful she was dressed in her gown in the headship the word all over her that he he just loved the way she looked and he put out the scepter The Authority said whatever you want Esther whatever you want just anything you want you want to be healed you want the Holy Ghost uh you want your loved one to be saved you can ask anything you want even to half of my kingdom you can have it oh I see that scepter stretched out here tonight don't you see it friends it's hanging all over the place it is the authority of Jesus Christ that he wants to hand the bride oh I feel it can happen tonight praise God and now I wanted to say I certainly enjoyed the messages this morning brother yonir and brother roseni was here and brother roseni he gave us cornbread and beans we certainly thank the Lord for the doctrine going forth brother Young from Belgium came along gave us ice cream and cake praise the Lord he certainly happy for that we like we got to have the cornbread and beans we got and we like the ice cream and cake also so it was wonderful this afternoon and uh uh we're trusting that uh the Lord will give us something tonight and I'm trusting and praying that the sick will be healed with a word tonight you know and um thinking about that there I have something here um this note was given to me by Brother Jack Palmer two years ago and Jeff and I don't think he knows anything about it because he may have forgotten about it and he gave me this year and I've kept it in my Bible for 2 years and never uh thinking that I would be here with brother Jack palmer but this is what he gave me uh a message then Jesus came jonville Indiana 4757 quote I was just inspired to speak them words and say that some glorious day at all of the gifts that is in the church would would just be set aside on the mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit himself would just take the church in such a control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk with without being hands laid on them it'll be just one great Unity well praise God Brother Tech may he didn't know it but may that come to pass tonight I'm hoping that God cap this off tonight for he's the one that had the faith and the burden to get God's people together here in spite of understandings and this one and that one he didn't care he had a he had something in his heart burning to get God's people together and so therefore I as Minister I don't feel worthy to even be standing here so many fign brothers here and such a fign spirit here that any Minister could stand up here and speak tonight I heard brother Jack Bell last year Speaking In This Very spot on healing and it was a tremendous message so therefore just a night of healing but I just want to see uh the Lord bless brother Jack for his faith and his church and what they did to bring us together I think we should really uh pray for him and and also because appreciate him for what he's done praise God for brother Jack and now um tonight is healing and so now we know that uh we can have uh um healing even without hands laid Upon Us St Mark 11:23 whatever you want whatever you believe in your heart and you say it it shall come to pass or we can have hands late on also St Mark 16 is still the word but it's up to you whatever you want amen I just want to give you a little testimony in my own church December the 2nd last year 73 I believe it was brother n i was have to be up and he was there and a sister in our church was there and she had uh what had happened I had came into the church a little late and she had missed her prayer request and she had a tremendous boil up underneath of her arm and that morning I was reading uh the message end time seed signs brother Sparks Edition and there brother Brandon was reiterating how he was teaching his church in Indiana on the greatest belly of a fort how there a woman on the stretcher a young lady laying on the stretcher and he just looked at her and went ahead and preached the word and when he finished preaching that message the greatest battle ever fought the woman got up off the stretcher and walked out amen so I was reading that over and that morning I was inspired to reading that there and came into the church and they handed me the note I walk into the pulpit and with that up my heart I prayed that when the word while the word yet went forth whether she be in the basement or the balcony cuz the word can find you you know I don't care where you go at that a word go on and find her sitting in her seat and brother Ned will can give witness to it he was there and that afternoon she called back to my wife and said that before the message was over she felt something trickling down her sleeve and had busted open by the word of God I believe God can burst open cancers tonight I believe he can bust open anything tonight amen the word can paralyze the world praise God that's the way I feel tonight friends so I feel that those who need healing you can be healed while you're sitting in your seat for we have witnesses in this church to prove that it happened in New York City the prophet taught it we just come right back to what he said you know what he was talking about amen see we in the word Age We a high way up amen we just say it amen cuz see it's God's mind these are is not our words this is not our mind this is God's mind for this [Music] age God's for this age that we should just say it and it would come to pass oh my what a message praise God we're not even worthy to handle this here pray we can just keep that in mind that we're not worthy amen and the way the prophet kept it that way I know that's anything can happen here tonight do you believe that friends praise our God now um I want to by way of a text I want to read from um I want to read from number numbers um numbers the 20th chapter verse [Music] 7-1 if you're write down the scriptures um Hebrews 10 [Music] 19-2 and Jude the 22nd chapter through the 25th verses inclusive reading from numbers the 20th chapter this is a healing night and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water the rock it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so that thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto the unto them here ye Rebels must we fetch your water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand with his Rod he smok The Rock twice and the water came out of abundantly and the congregation drank and the Beast also and also Hebrews 10th chapter 19th verse having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he ha consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to to provoke unto love and to good works and Jud 22 and of some have compassion making a difference and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spoted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy may God add a blessing to the reading of his word can you imagine that God is able to present Us faultless Praise just that one thought alone is enough to sit down for a million years and think about it the grace of almighty God faultless blameless spotless praise God that's the way he sees us right here tonight i' like to take a a photo out of here and of some have compassion that's my burden tonight you know and um many people uh think that you have to hear a lot of strange doctrines to know what's going on no uh you should learn the truth first then you can discern what's going on Amen see we don't have to hear a lot of funny things we just want to hear the truth and then when the funny things come along we know what it is and we have peace because that's the way like in the natural in the uh Banks they train their Bank tellers on the real dollar bills not the eait ones and they learn how to count the money with the real bills they get the feel of the real dollar bills and then when a phony is presented they they got it right away they got it I don't care what spirit moves around you got it amen and you have enough time to get composed and well Lord bless your brother how are you but you got to Spirit already see cuz you learn how to count with the real dollar bills and I feel that God has given us the real dollar bill bill brandom that is praise the Lord do you believe that friends amen therefore I know all the counterfeit Bill Brams cuz I've seen the real one amen and the dollar bill that he gave me I know it'll take me into the resurrection I know that the bank teller shall receive it I know I can cash in on the real dollar Bell cuz it's the same one from the foundation of the world oh praise God what promises what faith what hope we have tonight in this message that we have received from the King amen it's Vindicated already don't need anything added to that's why I was rejoicing last night the wave sheath and then when I get low I'm wondering that this is going on the devil say I says the wave sheath and it sweeps over me amen praise God and I'm did I'm all right then see I know that was already waved and presented and the blood dripped all over me ain't nothing I can do nothing I can't figure it out I'm going to make a mistake tomorrow I'm make one Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday but the wave sheet was already presented for my justification I'm already accepted I was there before the foundation of the world and so were you as brother young care brought out this morning before God made we were there amen before he made the Sun the moon the stars we was there we shouted for Joy amen we sang together with the morning Stars when we saw the camp coming up on the pyramid we praise God for it amen so now and brother Bram taught us that when Jesus cursed the Fig Tree uh that it was already moving away see so therefore Malachi for has come on the scene and and curse every fig tree as it was anything that had to be moved God hasn't cursed it already is moving out of the way amen our sies our whatever it is is already cursed praise God we have the victory already now what happened here what was God doing here God was showing them his power first to know that it was possible and that's why God used brother brand to show us those five manifestation and all those signs wonders and miracles that was to show us that it could be done first and all we have to do is to believe that it could be done and we have seen it done we know it has been done all we have to do is to believe it tonight it has all been done the sickness in your body is already cursed already praise God so God first proves it himself then you ask for it so let's ask for it tonight amen praise God now it said that a helpless Sparrow can drift With the Wind see but it takes an eagle to fly against the storms of Dallas and unbelief and see through the storms and see the promises of God on the other side oh I can see the eagles with their wings spread out tonight amen ready to fly with every promise of God let the current the Holy Spirit just sweep you up you go places you've never been before I believe that amen but all we have to do now is take both the Old and the New Testament I believe that God can take any portion of this Bible and interpret through you wherever I don't care whether it's it the book of ecclesiastics or the Book of Esther that can be interpreted through you yes sir I believe that tonight excuse me now tonight my message is dedicated uh to the Statue of a perfect man but somehow I feel that that message is a key message for the bride and so much so that um brother brandom uh this was part of the stor of food and I even believe that brother Billy Paul even had a dream about this here hope he don't mind me saying it but he did have a dream because he made it public so I suppose it's okay to say it and had a dream of I think it was 19 tapes and so forth like that and brother BR was saying in the dream to him before Paul you can come to me or I can come to you there's a condition and these tapes and it's 19 and they must have these 19 and I never forgot that you know and it stuck to me and then um he said well because how would I know what it how would it be he said it would be like a statue of a perfect man and that was the only tape that he named in that dream so brother I've been searching this book for a long time amen for the prophet gave it to his son in a dream there's got to be something in here somewhere for he named this book right here the only one so therefore let us go back to this book it maybe something is in here praise God and so therefore it was beautiful and I began to chase Billy Paul for I saw something in the word and having a dream like that I saw his dream in the Bible for it's in the Bible in Leviticus 2 and Deuteronomy 288 for God commands a blessing on the storehouses Amen on everybody's Storehouse there's a commanded blessing which is a different blessing from an ordinary blessing a commanded one from Heaven upon the storehouse praise God and so therefore brother Billy Paul move under this commanded blessing and open up the storehouse and we've been going there all these years and so I saw that in 68 I wanted to tell them about it I never got a chance to tell them but tell him tonight amen but anyway in cuz back in there in in Leviticus 25th chapter verse 1 through uh six it says sold the seed for six years but guys want to strike the 20th verse here and if you shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not swow nor gather because in our increas then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years you shall s the eight year and eat yet of the old fruit that's the old Storehouse tapes until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store oh I saw his head this these tapes would be right here to the Harvest amen the old fruit would be right here and then I saw from' 66 through 1971 was 6 years of sewing I saw the ministry here sewing that seed I saw in their places there I saw brother Billy Paul doing he was supposed to do playing those tapes in that Storehouse I said how wonderful this is everybody's in their own order doing what they want doing what they're supposed to do by led by God and we have got to come to a spot in the ninth year somewhere in there where's going to be a unity in there somewhere amen it's got to be I feel it it lays in here somewhere praise the Lord so when I saw that there and then we had a little uh typ for this in our own church for brother Hunt labored for 66 through 71 and in October 1971 two hippie types beards and boots and all Jesus people walked into our church in October and we was preaching there and then the Holy Spirit was all around them and we didn't quite understand it this was in our sixth year and we didn't get it and then after the service I threw everything with the kitchen sink at them trying to understand it the beards and whatnot and trying to figure out what it meant and they just ate it up praise God next thing I know they were baptized they were from New Jersey and then not even known in the sixth year there was a commanded blessing for for New York City and then in the seventh Year brother hunai was laboring we were tired and weary from just pounding away sowing that seed sowing it Faithfully staying at the post and the seventh Year God gave brother H rest for these two brothers begin to bring them in from New Jersey and brother they begin to come into our church from January 72 all the way around and we begin to eat in the seventh year we didn't have to do nothing we just baptized them and our own people they ate as they saw the new souls coming in what a rest what a refreshing it was that was God taking the portion of the word in Leviticus and interpret it in New York City in this day I know what I'm talking about for I've seen God vindicate just this right here in our own time in 1972 and then in the eighth year he says sold that seed and last year we sold the seed from Faith all the way up to brotherly kindness to adoption praise God to Rapture in Grace rapturing Faith Divine love amen the Resurrection The Rapture the wedding supper the whole bit last year the church was sold down the old times is with these new people coming in in 1972 71 everybody was sold down together with the original seed and New York cities here I they're waiting and looking with their with their cups empty amen looking up for God to pour it down I know you're here also for the same thing and then this being the last year was the eighth year and says keep eating from the old fruit the storehouse the tapes until the ninth year until her crops come in am oh my this is the ninth year friends 8 and 1/2 years already and I feel that the sewing time is over I feel that there's got to come forth an end Gathering what a beautiful month to have end Gathering of the wheat in June right down here in Georgia praise the Lord my I'm looking for end gathering tonight all the wheat the finest of the wheat has been gathered here in Georgia tonight amen and I believe we are right I believe we are mature I believe we are ready to manifest the Brotherly Love That is supposed to be our virtue in the top of the pyramid and then when Jesus can look down tonight and see faith and virtue and patience and godliness and knowledge and brotherly kindness the honey stuck in the rock box fith then he'll seal it up praise God and we'll see a statue of a perfect man oh my you brother believe it all in the back over here brother I'm looking for it and that's what he said anyway I just want to read to you about five minutes of so from page six here statue of a perfect man want to read something to you page six now we approaching the Seven Seals we just finished the seven Church ages and this is a message on teaching that ties a man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in that church Age The Eternal Church age at the end of the seals that's the one that that I want to be in and now brother Bram took his church in ' 62 and he stood him up and he made him pledge and he said these words words on page 65 add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge Temperance to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godliness brotherly love to your brotherly love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come because just beneath him the holy spirit is the spirit of Christ into the church to manifest those virtues I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I'll seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old statue of mine till I can be a manifestation of the living Christ for he became sin like me that I might become righteousness of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his now because that's the purpose he died for I love him I pledge it Lord this church pledges it the full stature of Jesus Christ amen my I said might has got to be something laying in there somewhere and I sure am looking for that Living Image for brother BR said then you'll see Sons and Daughters of God living monuments images of Jesus Christ that's what he died for that's what he's coming back for and I feel that something can happen before these Services is over to start us to push us off toward what we're talking about here in this book right here page 52 isn't that wonderful and then God through that has brought also seven Church agents to show those seven steps that he brought building his individual Into His Image he has built a complete Church in His image at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it is a bride so that cuts in every age every age comes and he goes on reading here in Hebrews 11 and he reads on this wise and speaking about those who wanded about in deserts mountains and dens and and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith here a good report through faith not receive not the promise God having provide some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection my what a calling we have what a vocation you and mere mortal human beings and even brother Billy Paul in the dream there he said Paul before you can come to me and I can come to you there's something here has got to be made here praise God I want this somewhere in here somewhere and this was the tape that he named and here these people over here cannot come to us and we can't go to them until this church here comes to Perfection the prophet's own words in here I know it's got to mean something but I'm looking for something like this to happen here friends aren't you looking for the same thing amen I know I am well in second Peter this very message here says that by these promises the word we might be made partakers of his divine nature so then we we realize that it is through God's nature uh through these promises rather that we will be made partaker of his nature now the token is the life which is the word he allowed this life seed to grow in him like I spoke last night for 30 years by the promises brother Brandon of the Holy Spirit of nature of God came into brother brandom through the promises and it's got to come to us by the promises a much short of time but it's still got to come by the promises and brother brandom hacked the promises out for himself against the entire world Amen and then the anointing come down and brought the out the life of the word and we have the promised word in us God like we were saying last night he compressed the Holy Spirit like an accordion and slipped it into our hearts for 8 and 1/2 years and sold a seed now he's getting ready to expand our borders amen amen oh my when he expands our borders the full of the Holy Spirit just comes around us the canopy of Life D Drops over us and we Under The Canopy of life and we become living monuments then the charity comes down and then we see a living faith a living knowledge a living Temperance a living uh uh uh virtue a living patience a living brotherly kindness when the charity does it the anointing of God and we're all waiting for that I know we are amen but we had to go through heartaches and testings and trials and temptations to literally die out to ourselves but but he showed us the way and it can be done he also provided the way he said this will bring to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine so I'm looking for the love divine to mate with the word and the two become one and the token I feel was his keynote message in 63 but he said that was my greatest message by inspiration outside of the Seven Seals those were a direct commission but he said uh that was uh uh by inspiration so something inspiration I feel that God wants to reveal to the bride how to get out of the way oh if he would do it tonight reveal to us to get ourselves out of the way that we might see Jesus the Greeks said we would see Jesus amen the world is wanting to see Jesus they want to hear about they want to see them amen this is a see and age they want to see it and we have have the calling to produce Jesus Christ to be a reproduction of Jesus Christ through the seed sperm word that's already in us already every promise in there already all we need to do for God to come down and bring it out so I feel that the Seed of Abraham Christ is in the bride and the bride like Malachi 4 adds The Life of Christ by the promises and the promises must be sold must be preached by the ministry or if you don't have a minister you hear the tapes and so forth you have a minister to hear the tapes and hear them preach also and read the books as long as this so this message is solded in there long as you know it's a Bible promise praise God if a donkey speak it long it's a Bible promise amen amen God can use donkeys anything he want to do to speak the word of God we ain't nobody amen praise God if he use a donkey he ain't got no mind of his own anyway amen see so therefore oh God make me a donkey tonight amen every promise is quickened by the word of God enabling us to add the life to the seed now brotherly kindness is a is a forgiveness it's the virtue our feel of the hour that's burning in my heart uh it must be displayed it must be ripe it must be seen and and the uh the Perfection the seed is the seed of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming in and then now we're looking for fruit though this is the hour of the fruit way up in the top of the tree and the fruit is the Harvest of of the seed in the heart and that's charity that's the full word added to the seed now I feel tonight that the rightness is brotherly kindness forgiveness honey uh The Rock Box confession and I feel that charity seals a man up for service uh this is to take place as brother Bram said on so many tapes um uh the adoption and tapes and all what the Holy Ghost is given for and all so many of them Blasphemous names desperation we we know them all but he said that there he said that there will come forth a power of the Resurrection I think it's page five and what of the question answers on the Holy Ghost he said when the power of this church Rises the power of that church Rises to bring its Brethren when the power of the church in Georgia Rises the church in Jeff and Tucson and Alabama all around Rises the power of the Holy o moves in charity sweeps in you'll be caught up into charity into Rapture and Grace it'll bring you praise God it'll pick you up and reap you like a sheath coming up in the reaping season and you'll know who you are you'll know your son and a daughter of the Living God a living Monument praise God ready to work for the master or you have thust sayith the Lord you keep still you have the mind of God Zoe eternal life moving through your members praise God move here go there say this here it something's going to happen now friends cuz it's dust sayith the Lord or you keep still and you then oh God is wanting to put us into a position St John 5:19 a position in the word where he can show us anything in the word he can bring it to pass cuz Jesus Christ was in that position St John 5:19 I do nothing except the father show me revealed to me how to do and what to say and I do that oh if we can get that position tonight where we won't back up from any part of the word no matter it doesn't cope with our Doctrine or or our idea or not Lord God get my idea out of the way we all we've all found out all these years whenever God actually comes on the scene is always different from the way we thought it was I believe everybody can say Amen to that it's always been different from the way we actually had to figure it out in our own minds oh my amen brothers so therefore let us get our own minds out of the way what a tremendous calling we have tonight what a responsibility that we have we have a wonderful exaltation here tonight here in the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter here and um so we realize that through these promises of Charity we will be like him but it got to be a Bible promise and this is a Bible promise of add to your faith and so forth and the last thing is Charity now here every believer is a priest and is exhorted to enter into the holiest and to enjoy his full rights in Christ Christians today should exalt one another to faithfulness more and more amen as they see the day of Christ draws near come on brother help that brother help that sister come on come on now come on praise God I always believe this here brother Bram said to minent brother you're walking up to Mount Zion now and on the side is serpents hissing this way and that way don't fight them don't even look at him amen keep on walking up those bloody footprints on up to mount Z praise God keep moving on brother I don't care what those serpents are hissing about it don't mean anything anyway amen cuz he already spoke what means something is only one thing that

about the bride and Rapture and Faith therefore God won't do that for me excuse me I said no brother I said a it's a revelation well because I can't have a revelation yes you can I said because Jesus Christ he lived by Revelation say John 5:19 you see so therefore he can give you Revelation also that very night he received a Dream from God backslid in 10 years and his dream was that he was there was a whole group of people down in the valley and they were wondering could they be saved could they be saved fearful people he looked up and he saw me coming down a mountain there just in the dream

handed it to him it was a circle like a clock and the hand was sticking straight it said 70 then it had times time time times 7 70 * 7 God gave him a revelation 10 years backslid through a dream that he could be saved and forgiven 7 70 * 7 you talk that God ain't real tonight you tell me that when I I know what happened that Sunday morning and bringing this out a little bit and thinking about

backsliding he went after him amen excuse me and that's Sunday morning there there a God come down there and fire swept down through that Puerto Rican Church there and what happened there I said oh praise God this very hour God is able to bring in the Bootleggers the drunken the wios the drug addicts even those with minis skirts on even those with pants on I said I tell you what when I see the power of God in my church I'll tell my ushers and my deacons to throw them doors open and let whoo ever will comes through the door for the Waters of eternal life is waiting for whosoever will brother

never lose your confidence don't let Satan tell you evil about me cuz there's much but you can keep that confidence cuz if you don't it won't happen don't look at me as a man I'm a man I'm full of mistakes but look to what I'm saying about him it's him he's the one let's Look to Him amen now I want to read something to you brother brandom's Vision here excuse me he had a vision way back and this is what changed my my heart June the 6th first I wanted to to read about the middle of the road here in Divine Healing this is a book a brother down in Texas sent me and I read I read it to you Divine Healing I believe in grace but on the other hand I also believe in Holiness Isaiah said that there is a Highway the way of Holiness and any correctly built road is higher in the center than it is on the side so that the trash can wash off now when a man is Born Into the kingdom of God God he's put right straight in the middle of the road looking toward Christ the Savior and if he doesn't watch he'll gradually move over to one side where he gets so cold and starchy or he'll get into fanaticism but right in the middle of the road is a true San path of those who would obey the true Gospel of Jesus Christ it is a gospel that you don't have to be ashamed of it is the power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit isn't that wonderful amen we are not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit like we all they need to do is to look to their Advocate that's all God will bring them back to Grace may God help to keep us balanced praise the Lord thank you thank you now we've always tried to stay in the middle of the road and not to get off to one side and that's a rough spot there in the middle cuz you have a cuz you have a pull from both sides amen and um as a minister of sewing sewing in heaven I believe a revelation by the grace of God of the true Holiness of God and what brother Bram stood for and we in New York wanted to walk that same middle of the road see wanted holding us everything right pure and church or whatever he said do it I mean the man was a prophet everything he said was for my church because his church was the bride and we was in The Bride but that's his church he said this is for my church well every marriage and divorce is for his church also so his church so everything else but if a brother ask me do you believe in I said well because you don't have to believe that see it's okay with you because I believe it see excuse me and then um think along those lines and like people don't understand you and you get and you get kind of weary and tired and then you see those who weaken they seem to be doing the same thing over and over and it just sort of give you maybe a complex and maybe you don't want to like preach no more to them see and you get into a corner and then June the 6th that morning there I was sitting there tired and weary and thinking about Georgia and wondering there like Jericho maybe what's going happen down there amen excuse me and then this come to me and I want to read it to you brother br's Vision the one because he had back here a few years ago a thrilling story of how a soul Was Won to Christ by Reverend William brandham and the name of it is and of some have compassion and that's when it struck me and I hope it strike you tonight the way it struck me friends there are so many things that we can say about Perfection it is so easy to try to gouge the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves appear just a little holier than they but if we can only see the true picture it is only by God's grace that we are what we are praise God oh this is God speaking here amen some time ago in in Ohio where I was having a meeting I learned a lesson the hard way we had been eating at a little dunet restaurant where they had such lovely little ladylike waitresses decently dressed and and clean as it could be it was a real treat to eat in such a pleasant Place their kitchen was stick and span on Sunday they closed up and went to their church I was going to preach that Sunday afternoon and feeling a little hungry I went over to what looked like an ordinary Little American restaurant as I walked in the door what did I hear about a jukebox going full blast I looked toward the back of the building there was a bunch of teenage boys and girls playing those little rock and roll records on the machine a young woman about 18 years of age was standing there her dress hanging low in front let one of the boys act indecently towards her they were all smoking and drinking I thought oh God how can you see all this and stand it hearing somewhere make a big groan I looked over to my right and there sat an elderly woman probably 60 or 70 years of age she had on those little skinny vcal clothes her poor old wrinkled flesh was just as flabby as it could be makeup cover to face her hair was cut real short curled up and dyed blue her fingernails were painted of Deep Purple the little open shoes she wore showed purple painted toenails I looked at her and two drunk men who sat across her table it was summertime but there was one sat with a big old army Overcoat on and a gray scarf wrapped around his neck long whisk were all over his face belching and his friend excused himself themselves from her and staggered to the restroom standing there I asked God why don't he destroy such ungodliness why he didn't just sink it beneath the earth I wondered if my little Sarah and Rebecca would have to grow up amid such stuff I said God how can you in your great Holiness ever stand to look at such a thing as that and not send an earthquake and sink it as I stood there condemning a woman I felt the spirit of God I stepped behind the door and a vision came to me I saw the world turning around and around with a Scarlet streak around it it came close until I saw myself son as a little boy doing things that I ought not to have done maybe cuz they weren't bad like I just saw but they were sin every time I did anything wrong I saw a great black shadow go toward towards heaven God would have had to slay me for that sin then I saw standing between God and Me Jesus Christ that perfect sacrifice amen oh I saw him standing there with the thorns on his head spit hanging on his face every time my sins was St toward God he would reach out and catch him like the bumper on a car he was protecting me from Death every time I would do anything wrong God's holiness required death for me certainly his Law requires but every time I would do anything wrong the blood of Jesus Christ acted like a bumper the Scarlet streak meant that the blood was availing for me I got a little closer to him and I could hear him say father forgive him he does not know what he's doing looking down I saw a book and a recording Angel there by his side he was recording my sins in the book which had my name on it I realized that someday that blood streak would be lifted and I would have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life I saw that his Mercy was holding off my judgment humbly I went to him I knelt and said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am unworthy to come into your presence but will you please forgive me for what for what I have just done he touched his side with his hand and took the old book and wrote pardon on it threw it behind him my sins were gone then he looked at he looked me straight in the eyes as he said now I have forgiven you but you want to condemn her I saw then what it all meant and that's when I saw June the 6th this year what it all meant to me then he spoke to my heart and said on and of some have compassion and oh praise God I don't care what anybody say about me I I don't care what ought I would have against a minister brother anybody else I forgive him amen I don't care what it doesn't matter what it is William brandham had that Revelation they sent him dung in the mail they cursed me did all kind of things to him he went and prayed for him amen yes sir and the more he humbled himself the more he prayed for them I don't care if it's doubters and odd doctrines and funny Spirits I forgive them yes sir makes no difference brother that's then you come into real mat Authority then you begin to get real right you begin to grow up into the things of God you begin to be like your father going about forgiving doing good doing kind no matter what they do to you when they revile you you're in the word now you're in the sermon on the mountain now brother you moving with reality when they they revive you you bless them oh praise God if God can get a bride like that that's back to the word there's the real back to the word not legalism and chopping down and Grace Grace but Walking Down The Highway of Holiness brother with hands stretched out to both sides the legalist and the grace gracest and trying to pull them on up to your road don't go down there now just pull them up brother and keep moving on down the King's Highway that's why I believe that yes sir so therefore I I feel Brothers excuse me and then W let June 9th and while had just finished preaching this message here and then all of a sudden I turned around the Holy Spirit spoke to me and brother Hunt sitting right over there I said brother Hunt brother Tony he's over here somewhere brother Kirk brother dilot please forgive me and then all a sudden something swept through our I said church God bless you please forgive me and the spirit of forgiveness swept down through the New York assembly I didn't even know what I was even doing it wasn't until 4 days later the holy spirit said read St Mark 11:24 252 6 if you have art forgive brother Hunt rushed back he said you didn't do anything to me and the other you could do anything to me I said I know it but I don't understand it then the Holy Spirit begin to speak he says this this this happened to me now I me I don't know what happened to you excuse me but he said that there's a lost coin there's brotherly kindness it must be shown it must be displayed it must be revealed I'm fixing to come down and bless my people if they can only get the Revelation that they are nothing and I am everything oh that ye are the branch and I am the Vine I forgave you your sins like my Prophet showed you and when William brandom that really came to him brother I know it changed him he believed it all the time and and that's all the things happening to him is the one he can even because remain s the things that happened to him and we have a few little things to overcome just a few little trials and temptations that's all we have in all all the glory of God is waiting for us there if we can just overcome about 8 or n years that's all it is and we almost at the end don't let no brother upset you or sister upset you with some funny Spirit forgive them if you're right forgive him anyway amen yes sir confess your faults You' be healed we're in the word now praise God Amen so therefore that begin to come real to me and the Holy Spirit begin to say forgive forgive then it came back to me this is a dream that Lloyd had back in Puerto Rico and then the Holy Spirit when you stand praying if you have anything against anyone forgive him Let It Drop leave it Let It Go forget about it in order that your heavenly father who is in heaven Also may forgive you your failings your shortcomings think of it now he lets our mistakes drop he don't bring it up he don't keep harping on it we ask him to forgive us and he does amen but here's a brother we keep bringing it up bringing it up bringing it up Let It Drop Let It Go forget about it throw it behind you to see it forget for it oh praise God if we ever get that Revelation and the devil is fighting fighting fighting he don't want you to get it he knows when you reach that Plateau you you have made the Mark you are ready for anything the father wants you to do oh praise God you're ready you mature minister or Christian worker you're ready you're no more in swalling clothes you don't need that pacifier no more the milk bottle comes out brother you ready for strong meat yes sir you're ready praise God just forgive

that right excuse me he had walked in the right he was tempted job 19 he even had seen he said I know my redeemer liveth listen he knew that he was would be in the resurrection he knew that and yet he he had not matured yet and Job 38 the Whirlwind struck him and then he went through that Whirlwind experience and then he came to these noble words I have heard it by the hearing of the ear but now my eyes see and I Repent I abhor myself I hate myself and I Repent in dozen ashes he had a revelation he knew he was nothing oh praise God what about Jacob he had the promise amen he was on his way back to the promised land there for the promise and he met up with the angel of the Lord there is that right excuse me and he began to wrestle with him he was wrestling to keep the word in his soul all

God says now I can bless you God he had finally admitted though God had blessed them and been with them and everything else but still I don't care how much God has blessed us in the ministry or whatever we're doing am we have got to come to that place sometime where we are nothing the a minister be whoever we are every Bible prophet and character come to that place Malachi 4 come to that place I just read it to you he said then I saw what it meant and he stopped condemning her oh praise God Amen what about Isaiah a prophet of God went into the house of God and there he looked up and saw the Lord high lift up in his trains filled the temple the syapin was frying to and fro holy holy Lord God Almighty his holy presence moved the post and Isaiah looked up in that vision and he said whoo is me I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among people of unclean lips what a vision he had what about Daniel his virtues his good things his comeliness was turned into corruption when he met the Lord and we have had seven Visions manifested to us Seven Seals what is our condition tonight who are we tonight can we say that we are nothing have we reached that time have we been matured excuse me are we ready for the third pool to be made manifest in our lives have we come to that spot friends do we understand the grace of God for you and for me the same Grace for your brother is for you also same Grace is for him if we do then let us forgive one another in our hearts confessing our faults one to another amen and then praying one another we may be healed we can have it tonight friends now of course the enemy he don't want it right here right now you know oh no he move throughout here with the negative thoughts we don't have to do that the Bible says so friends yes sir amen but I tell you one thing Malachi 4 has showed us this channel of communication he said I have a secret I know how to get out of the way he showed us a secret he gave us the word we become perfectly weak and we are nothing and the last thing that makes us perfectly weak is brotherly kindness forgiveness and we Absolut abolutely totally surrender to the word oh the word says brotherly kindness the word says forgive the word says honey are you going to surrender tonight or are you going to stiffly fight it or you going to yield surrender to the Holy Spirit you can do it right now oh yes sir praise God if we do we have a perfect Channel of communication to meet God and oh he's waiting to get into the battle he's got his sleeves roll up tonight he wants to come right down in here tonight and heal everyone in the building here tonight oh yes sir praise God Hebrews 10:19 having therefore brethen boldness to enter into the holies by the brother Jesus to a New and Living Way over the house of God he's the high priest here amen and God has provided a smitten Rock if you read back in numbers there the first exod 17 rather when when he first smoked the rock it was only the elders out there there was no people there and we was not there when that rock was smitten at Calvary either we didn't have to be there but we can accept it tonight yes sir but the next time he told him to speak to the Rock but notice when he spoke to the rock it was when Israel was complaining and murmuring and unbelief and sin and one the stone Moses is when the sin at his greatest height that's when God loves to show his grace yes sir that's when we have that promise we can speak to the Rock Amen that's when uhh he says speak to the Rock don't Smite it but just speak to the Rock obedience is better than sacrifice no matter what we think and here we have the rock the second time as the high priest and that's what he is here tonight he's our high priest here tonight notice it was the people's sins what led to what which led to the smiting of the Rock Amen and out of the rock comes rivers of Living Water yes sir and Israel had Grace and they had a smitten rock and a brass serpent a prophet of God and a pill of fire they had all these things here and we have them here in this end time now just to to hurry along Aaron was the high priest and therefore uh Aaron has a rod of life and Moses had a ride of power amen and here we are tonight and we have have Aaron's Rod the word eternal life we have that tonight friends the Aaron's Rod but it and brought forth Buds and Blossom blossoms and yielded almonds in the fourth time it yielded almonds fruit oh I know that Aaron's Rod will yield fruit tonight all we have to do is bring into the presence of God it'll yield almonds all we have to do is speak to the Rock the hour is here for us our s to speak to the Rock friends it's time for this tonight do you believe that their friends tonight do you know who we who we talking about we're talking about I am I am is that rock I am that I am we talking about that clown like a man's hand that Malachi forsaw we talk about those five manifestations that he saw that spoken word of Resurrection to squirrels and salvation the power amen and the healing praise our God and who was that person that did these things for you and me it was none other than Jehovah of the Old Testament came back to Malachi 4 and manifested himself as Jesus of the New Testament he come back for a Third Exodus he come back to get you and I and he gave Malachi for to give us everything for the journey we are on our way to the resurrection do you believe that there yes sir St John 8:58 before Abraham was I was but he says before Abraham was I am he could have said I was but he said I am amen present tense friends without any doubt he was taking us back to that day when Moses bowed before the burning bush we got to know who I I am is tonight amen asking God in what name he should go that that God should give him that was sending him and when he was going down to Egypt and God says I am that I am that's who I am I am who I am and what I am and I will be what I will be amen that's that's what I am you go on down and you tell those Israelites I am have sent you yes sir and Jesus told those Jews if you believe not that I am he shall die in your sins yes sir friends therefore the meaning of that great name we know is Jehovah and all this there and Jesus claimed the same name and reveal it to Malachi for one day out there squ hunting he says I am Jehovah he said Jehovah the old test is Jesus of the new I think about 196 or 61 somewhere there of time there now now watch now we moving up and forth a a healing line now now watch it's too full now he is the everpresent one who stands outside A Time To whom there is no past nor future he's now right here right now oh yeah but to whom everything is present that's why he could say before Abraham was I am I am am right here right now this of course means eternity it's another realm all together where everything is one glorious present we are there tonight amen by illustration here now by relation of a reader to the event in a book as you read a book the story in the book there is a sequence of time as the pages are turned certain incidents go into the past and others come into the present and yet others remain in the future and

present right now we are free of our sins right now tonight our yesterdays as well as our tomorrows all now to him he loves us right now he's not going to love us more when you get to heaven he love you right now tonight he wants to bless you tonight he loves you right here T now he's a now God right now here tonight amen as he reads us tonight tonight we are written Epistles no sin at all that's where we stand tonight now Jehovah with a special revelation of the grace of God to Israel I am as a unfinished sentence I because it has no object I am what amen we discovered he was saying to Moses

Pentecostal who stood out there on the Great persecution and so was Malachi 4 amen but to me you know it's a little story about a oyster just want to tell it to you before we pray for the sick first there is in the Oyster first then there into the oyster shell is introduced a substance which becomes a source of great irritation and suffering a small stone or some foreign body and once this irrit is in the Oyster is there for good it's a real thorn in the flesh for the oyster but the creature has to live with him amen yet God has provided the oyster with a wonderful way of handling the source of sufferings the creature is able to manufacture a wondrously smooth material with which it covers the irritation oh my we have something in US Sweet Holy Spirit smooth and sweet and it covers every irritation is that wonderful friends this protective covering is what makes the actual Pearl as the years go by the oyster continues to cover the problem whatever problem you have the Holy Spirit can cover that problem tonight amen with more Pearl material so that in God's good time does this thing which came in originally as an irritant or a thorn becomes transformed amen so we learn that a precious Pearl really is a problem covered with the the provision of God the word Heroes of f of Faith learned this life without the the provision of Christ is often just a string of Sorrows and tragedies and sufferings but praise be to the Living God tonight when our problems are covered with what he has provided the string of problems become a String of Pearls amen so all our problems and sufferings and trials and temptations every anything El happened to you all things work together for good well I'm tired Lord hold still the great physician has written out the prescription he he said
