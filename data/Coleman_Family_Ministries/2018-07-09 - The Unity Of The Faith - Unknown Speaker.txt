TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let us stand in respect to the reading of the word of the Lord I don't really want to hold you too long this morning we didn't want to get you out and I haven't settled down since I've been home then going the whole week have you had a chance to do anything but I'm trusting on the grace of God this morning let us turn to Philippians the 3rd chapter and reading from the first verse finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not Grievous but for you it is safe the way of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concession the Tomatis Jews now and the dogs speaking about there because a carrot there or could conduct an evil workers is their character see in the dogs in the Old Testament wasn't even supposed to come into the house of God and that's why we were called dogs Gentile dogs but here Paul is he is here reversing it and calling ISA a Jewish legalizes also trust in their flesh and what they can do and I pray and I did so and so he calls your dog that's what he's saying here so let's get the word of the Lord here hey men just Gentile dogs again has he called him Jewish dogs here see and so therefore his same because you're unclean and a dog was unclean in the Old Testament couldn't come into the house of God that's why they called dogs Gentile dogs and Paul just turned the table over and : these Jews dogs who are trusting and what I'm getting ready to read to you for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit we are the circumcision those who in Christ is the real circumcision aim and nothing of the flesh now which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh that's what I was just telling our little sister Ellen don't have no confidence anything in your mind anything no confidence though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh I more Paul said I'm more than all of you see circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him here it is not having my own righteousness brother nothing that we can do see Amen which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by its by faith is what he gives us and we go from what he gives us to what he gives us from faith to faith amen it gave me some this morning you go with that today give some tonight go with that until Wednesday hey man you just keep going when he gives you and so oh praise the Lord thank you Lord I got that and he'll go with you that I may now here it is that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto this resurrection of the dead not as though I had already attained see very humble here neither were already perfect but I far after it that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do and may it be what the one thing we do from this time on forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before our press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything you be otherwise minded I shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mine the same thing and first Corinthians the ninth chapter 24th verse no you're not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible alright therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the ear but I keep my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway may guard a blessing to ring novice word i like it take a little thought I hear unity of the faith may we just breathe a word of Prayer father we pray this morning that these are wonderful scriptures God may you open them to us this morning or open the children's bread and feed the Lambs and reveal something to us which is faith and may they go with this faith today and rejoice in it bless your word and bless the people and father may the holy spirit come down to convict souls and bring them to Christ and heal the sick and may many signs wonders and miracles be done father we pray and we asked it in Jesus name and his sake amen they'll all best you may be seated like it take a little tile out of here the unity of the faith and so now we have the Lord's Supper tonight and remember the the the order in the house of God downstairs tonight at all times now the the appeal this morning here in Philippians the third chapter the 15 16th verse is for unity unity of purpose unity of desire unity in now merica for our prophet of God to this generation has restored back to faith amen we know that and as in the book of acts the second chapter the first verse and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord one mind in one place brother if we can only get on one Accord in here as Paul is exhorting us there for as many as be perfect as many as be grown-up as many as be mature as many as be turned from a green to a golden brown amen as many are they have reached that spot perhaps this morning after eight years of ripening from green to brown if you we can finally reach one Accord this morning praise God we have another penny constant here this morning if every person within contact of my voice could they'll finally say Lord God this morning for I want to forget about the world I don't want to know nothing back here I just want my eyes on Jesus what a mind what attitude brother the Holy Spirit would so zero in on you and and fill you with this presence this morning and I always got to come whether it be one two three four is going to be somebody is gonna meet and when brother Branson when you can get ten people to agree there'll be a rapture well praise gotta let the ten be in here amen when you can get tend to agree zero in on a purpose and the only thing I know that we can agree on being different people nationalities and spirits and and backgrounds and everything else we can agree on the word amen we can all agree on a word of God so therefore we preach the word not our minds what we think but the Word of God so we here have one object this morning that is to be mature in Christ in other religions it means that they are designated they're fully instructed as as opposed to the novices and therefore we have come to a point now where they are those who have been fully instructed for the past eight years they've heard the tapes and they've got the books that got the Bible and the Lord has even blessed you with an extra portion of understanding and revelation well there's got to come a day sometime when we're gonna leave the swelling close amen and be thus minded the way Paul was the way that the diffusions church was not the way the the Corinthians were what sentence doing and this man in that man or the Hebrew church not wanting to go on to perfection Hebrews six Paul said forget about it go on let us go on forget about laying again in the Baptism and things in old God what I do back here the blood has cleansed it forget about it happened two years ago yesterday forget about it go on to perfection Amen let's go on brother I've got to go my wife and I made up our minds we're going on and the family come on let's go together I'm going amen I don't know we can't stay here no longer something has happened we have turned a corner amen praise the Lord when I left here went out to a Tucson I spoke to brother Harold Mike on there I said brother Harold when I come out I said only one thing is pulsating in my heart and that everything I do or say is directed into the unity of the faith whether I would see I'm here to restore bring together amen and then there's Sunday morning if you heard the testimony Wednesday that was on my heart and God poured it out to them I said don't say at this foremost the harvest I believe I said assay night is four months to harvest the fields already two harvests amen praise the Lord he's here he got a secret food that you know not other so finish the work Amen so he wanted to finish he's already turned you from green knows that knows how speaking positive he has done it amen and I was preaching out there and sister Mary Norma's father Jean Norman he fall along with God's prophet and he was there when the seven angels came and the whirlwind the rock and he was there all the time and he told me he says brother Coleman I didn't hear you preach one thing negative you preach how adjuster you better believe it he's supposed to preach negative for an hour told me I know but I know then one phrase coded all over to say about his seed I know that I know but I know I said you better believe it I know what I'm talking about why I met him I met him before I even come to the message I was baptized in the Holy Ghost and brother cannot leave me that's before me right now it's pulsating burning in my soul praise the Lord when I started out I had a zeal without knowledge but thank God he gave me some nourish now still there are zeal but brother here so nervous to it through a message of a prophet of God so I still got that same zeal my face is set right flip to ward Jerusalem the New Jerusalem and I'm going to finish the course amen praise the Lord so therefore are a few less be just mine it this morning in Paul was saying here all his past success as a mighty prophet of God right in the Bible Paul says forgetting all of them can you imagine he has something to fall upon revelation after revelation and our angel to the church age posted forgetting that can you imagine that answered this morning he was saying as he as he was writing this here he said that that doesn't pass but this but right now want to press on toward the more toward the goal I can't because drawback on there that's already past its what I'm doing present tense Jehovah is here in brother right I will say one time like you're reading a book if I get a novel I look in the novel and the novel could be about somebody back in 792 somewhere AD but when I'm reading it I'm there with that person in the book is that right it's passes over there then you might read a novel and it goes beyond you where you're at right now it might go to because the 1985 but you there over 1985 and you're also here or what about a man when you read the word you're there and you hear a Mary he's here this morning on the scene the same gotta to rebel in the Bible or back over there is here now he's the same when she want to be with praise God in the wedding supper in the Millennial Kingdom that same God is holidays there he's here jehova shamma present tense he's here this morning he's here i am i when i am whatever you need I'm here this morning to give it to you that's the guys when I told about the I know what I'm talking about he's here with us now amen praise the Lord so Paul says the pair success does not remove the necessity for future striving can you imagine with him what about us and we saw the same desire same motive in william branham he kept pressing on that right he even said that I'm the least of all you he said if the Lord came right now the guy wouldn't even go you would go before me and he was a prophet about the spoken word well where do we where do we get off being all puffed up and have attained and all we gotta do is go in the tent and what now what kind of spirit is that my you see what he is rebuking that spirit we don't need no more ministers we don't need no more nothing we're already perfect what a devil what a deceiving spirit Amen see but not so in New York City no he made a seat hunt for a long time we got hot seats in here don't sit down here like that brother no brother mm yes sir you don't come in here sit down with that attitude no sir remember young sister coming over here last summer asked several people here what is brother coming getting it what is he trying to extract perfection can't help but try to get it out that's what's in my heart I'm looking for perfection because he's looking for some message of the hour perfection so that don't be it there's nobody at ease and sighing in here no praise the Lord nobody at ease in here everybody on your mark on your toes Amen Dickens excuse everybody be on your toes in the house of God praise the Lord now if you're otherwise minded or if you're not quite convinced as to this point of view or that it should be applied this seal to every area of your life well don't worry about it God will reveal it to you see so it might be 15 in here they have this desire maybe another 40 don't have it but take it easy got a revealer tear from faith to faith and then you see another one they don't have it don't get all mad at you and you know get all exasperated with the person God will reveal it to that person Amen praise the Lord see so just just let God do it and we'll be all right praise God so now but let those of us who are spiritually mature and full-grown have this man hold these convictions and if any respect you got a different attitude your brother or your sister pray for them and God and make it clear to them for he must reveal it to them and we can't do it see so now a Paul is saying here and those of us here in a 16 verse only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walking or our lives or by that lets not deviate from nothing so therefore I feel with all my heart we have attained something we have added an add and add and we come to a certain spot we were green and golden brown when we started out but now you're seasoned Christians so we have come to this let us hold this amen and go on to perfection I want to read something to you from statute of a a perfect man page six this is what I I was trying to read out there and preach out there was very hard to reach from the spoken word books you got a preach you put your head down Nestea in so you don't put your head down you you keep your head up you see page six now we are approaching the seven seals we just finished the seven churches and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's going to be in that church age that eternal church age at the end of the seals now we know that we have seven trumpets seven plagues the files and so forth that we get into as we go along but we're waiting for more room so the people can be seated and also on page eight now he's speaking here after reading the scripture a second Peter one five through seven see the world he says why are we descriptive whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises mmm I'll tell you Wednesday that the the Christ has been resurrected back here through Malachi four and fulfill every prophecy concerning a prophet to our age and release promises through Malachi 4 that right now here I'm reading right here where by and he's releasing announcing he is going to release he because he already has actually in 62 or 63 he's going to release a virtue in patience each one's a promise to see and as he comes to you see now we're by are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust it's now beautiful and they say well why do I have to hear the word though the word is the divine nature of God and then a prophet come with a message and tells us how to get that divine nature by adding to your faith and then you take on his nature by the promise is a promise you must hack it out for yourself amen and don't let the enemy deceive you all for one promise if it's for healing or comfort or whatever it is for a peace of mind that passes all understanding hold to that promise of God amen hold - I don't care what the enemy says I am a Christian this morning it's a promise as worried people taking the word amen praise the Lord see the world we escaped that now he is addressing this to the church that's why we here this morning is a find out what is the way what is God's requirements there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ is that right now it's laid out here every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably oldest in the building but if I'd asked them what is your heart's desire it would be closer to God when you learn of Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him amen praise the Lord excuse this expression I told my wife here not long ago both getting old I said to her do you love me like he used to and she said I certainly do and I said you know I love you so much til I would like to take you and pull you inside of me so we could just really be one now that multiply that by a hundred million and then you find out how that the believer who falls in love with Christ praise the Lord wants to get into him because it's a love and here he's going to show us my my he's going to show us how that through these promises we might be partakers of Christ's divine nature is that beautiful and he already done it through this message that we have we have actually partaken of god's nature can you imagine he says here these mortal bodies how that we can be partakers through us a word in simplicity praise the Lord don't ever come in here on Wednesday and sunny and feel down the devil justice even you come in here to get a promise to be a partaker of this nature don't let your flesh get you down beat that flesh make it black and blue yeah beat it it's virtually beated amen the flesh is trying to get your soul to be a slave to its desires and dictates and I refuse old flesh you're gonna be a slave to my soul and my soul is the Word of God every time my soul hits you flesh you're gonna be black and blue got it amen and it's a fight and I'll beat that body to bring it I don't care what it wants it's gonna be a slave to the Word of God it's gonna be you by the Holy Spirit toe to the word amen amen brother hey man that's wonderful amen now here's brother bream on page 65 this is a dedication here add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godliness brotherly love do you brotherly love the Holy Spirit that's who I'm talking about is the dynamics the intelligence the capstone the wedding garment amen praise God divine love love design that's the one I'm wantin that's what I'm looking for this more that's what I'm searching and striving and pressing for divine love amen to come down and saturate me all over me close out my imagination memory of fiction and conscience no more chapter Velo me and Isaac is in the field praise the Lord and Christ will come because just beneath him the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ which is now into the church to manifest those virtues and he sings I love but here's what I want to say to you here brother Brown speaking I pledge this morning to him with all my heart that by his help and by his grace I pray that I'll seek daily without ceasing until I feel every one of these requirements flowing in this little old statue of mine till I can be a manifestation of the Living Christ for he became sin like me that I might become a righteousness of God like him he took my place Lord let me take his Nell because that's the purpose he died for I love him I pledge it Lord how many will pledge that same thing by the grace of God with our heads bowed narrow and hands up I love him I pledge it Lord this church pleasures it the full statue of Jesus Christ because He first loved me and purchased my salvation on Calvary's tree brother that's what I preached this morning how many have placed at this morning to come to the unity of the faith a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ then if now there's something don't know this morning you know this is spiritual people talkin el no more greenness amen see it's golden brown and it's making a pledge this morning we'll go said Rebecca she said so then she said she didn't feel anything she'd even know what it look like but she had a pledge he pledged to go regardless amen loving him and not even haven't even seen him she loved them anyway praise our God so back up your pledge now as we preach here for another half an hour let's back it up you're ready for the word amen praise the Lord so now we are we are pledged to unity of the faith in the the perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ I remember my own own little personal testimony how when I was a young man and growing up I could understand my own self I was awed did like to be with a big crowd of people like to just be alone love to play ball and running things like that I could express myself but just to be around I just was kind of strange I didn't know what it was it was something in here and everything that was off it I look wrong I just what I wasn't satisfied with it I didn't have any satisfaction Amen I went here I went there no satisfaction but when I met him satisfaction praise God satisfaction and even thinking about my own birth in our memoir my mother told me a few years ago when she was six months uh because pregnant with me my angel appeared to her and said when the child is born name him Joseph and how she testified in the Pentecostal church here Bishop Lawson and then when the child was born it was a boy and she named him Joseph and that nature is in my heart and that means God shall add prosper so I can't get away from that it's something that I haven't done if something is in here and may don't understand you you think you're nuts or something where is about a turn the prophet of gossip for some nuts to be linked to some books a man I'm praying one of those nuts they meant to be bolted to Jesus Christ so how can I help but have been thus minded like Paul I have got to go on to profession for that very thing is lean in my nature I can't help it it is cut to add and then when I come forth in this generation here is a prophet with a message and your faith how can I get away from it there's a very message to life for me to add to and you if you want it praise the Lord so now I hope you understand me now you wanna know what do you what am i digging at you know I was born that way so I got to dig the way I'm born amen praise Allah hurt so if I can't be satisfied here like chickens I gotta fly I can't stare out on the old telephone wires clucking around over some dead revelation but I got a soar into the spirit and get for myself blessed be the name of the Lord I mean going out to Tucson praise God knowing that God shall prosper God shall add that's for you he's added do ever think what am I gonna do support was supposed what God shall head you're in the very time of the eagle God adds yes what's happening here small he's adding if you want it you can have it praise the Lord so we see it in that as I told brother makanda and then at the next Monday after I was out there and you heard that the testimony Wednesday uh-huh said them God put up on my heart to speak about Psalm 133 but the precious ointment that's what I want that oh the ointment that came down Aaron's beard amen floor all over his skirts don't you want that point that's what I want praise Allah feel it here this morning a man is Fitness all together every joint has this ointment on it sticks to one another anointing to anointing an eagle - eagle praise the Lord so now now we feel this way but Paul says in the seventeenth verse now brethren be followers together of me and more of him which walks so as you have us for an example now he's saying now a brethren together follow my example and I observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you so then those in here that will follow william Bram's example and paul's here in the bible mark dos brother they're on their way to heaven so it's all here Z go here Markham Amen and to get together with them Eagles that's on the way they are mature they're not they are the swaddling clothes putting on the wedding garment blessed be the name of the world right they know what they're doin see they're putting on their own wedding gown then like a little baby's got to get my bottle amen and wipe the noses know they're on their way to heaven praise the Lord so narrow mark go see other words don't compromise for the sake of unity and I ain't gonna compromise with nobody for the sake of unity I'm gonna be caring and in brotherly kindness and forgiving and loving but I'm not going to compromise with anybody or anything but the word of the Lord and lay it down word by word light upon line and precept upon precept here a little in there a little amen praise God so now I'm thinking about that but that there and the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart and said now the fire for ministry it'll be an anointing I was just meditating on a word I told him why I says Holy Spirit was showing when when when when brother Brennan went out in the field he had and anointing up on him that would bring them he'd say Baptist Methodist for square to square and so forth Jesus name let's all we are brothers that remember all your tapes we are brother it was an anointing of unity it's in the very age of unity everything is being a unified that's the anointing of the hour is to be unified you understand now and that's there so therefore here here we are with the faith restored but the people in the message don't seem to be in unity so when a fire for mercy goes forth the law is showing me that they will have an anointing of love to bring a unity of the faith then you'll know who is the fire for man so you know for it being anointing upon those individuals to bring the church into our unity of the faith to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ your to worry you know it amen you know he won't have to say I'm the thigh full ministry know you'll know it brother and it'd be science fall on it and the love of God will be there with him so if what Paul is saying the same thing here the unity of the faith the faith itself is one body of truth and as we hold to this one body here this morning now see we are in turn uniting it to one another that's what I was saying Markham each one that's holding to the whole body of truth and you catch one here I saw several out there in Tucson that was holding to the body and all I did it was come with this anointing now for unity out there for the first message being the unity of the faith and then going through fire messages and winding up where there is a river that's what I preached out that there is a river and told me it's fall all over city and it's flowing and but it comes as your scripture hath said and laid it down they didn't know what was going on see I know what I was doing hey man I said it ain't nothing won't happen except Saint John 7:37 30 as just scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water there is a river and that was laid down and all how many of us rejoiced in here the word of the Lord and so now Paul was saying here if we hold to this faith itself this body of truth and we see this one in that when we begin to come together in unity we believe the whole body of revealed truth for the Lord Himself said when the Son of man returned it shall he find faith in the whole body of what Malachi 4 revealed amen shall he find it and knowing that on the false no NAT tape he said if you're following the line of it he said here is Willie find it well Willie after these false northing ones go out will he find the faith he got it now so he returns back to find the faith and the the undie faithful and wise servant is tested not to ability but tested a corn to faithfulness faithfulness are you faithful and giving up the spiritual reveal food or did you change to some strange interpretation it's not your ability now but it is are you faithful that's why see what your little spoonful or are you faithful to the one spoonful not your ability now you may not be able to sing like this one in and beat like that one but are you faithful to what he give you then he'll bless you for that if you held on to tooth the seeds hold on to it a monkey and and be right Joe hold your ground the devil couldn't move Jobe he presented his little faithful sacrifice his burnt offering and he held his ground and he wouldn't move amen the church members come precious brothers sisters come talking against you what not amen but he held his ground he didn't care what they said those old church members praise the Lord even his wife spoke to him and cursed God and so for told like a foolish woman he held his ground if your husband says this hold your ground your wife says that hold your ground what they say God has revealed to you something hold it pull the cops unchanging hand if God has revealed he's going to heal hold to God's unchanging hand if God has with you today you are a member of the bride I don't care what they say and what happens in your life hold to what he has revealed to you you all might a channel of God I am your we'll hold to that amen that's it see an don't worry about the other man praise God Paul is saying here I pressed to ward in the fourteenth verse I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Paul is saying I press toward the goal to win the supreme and heavenly prize to which God and Christ Jesus calling us upward merica for call is out and this morning God is calling us up praise God is a voice of the resurrection calling us up hither this morning sees everything has had happened in the last ten and eight years forget about it this morning you've already placed heaven here to the Statue of a perfect man well he's calling up or heavenly calling this morning as has gone forth this morning praise God so Paul says not that he are already attained see he's Paul's looking here for he said if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead any L or Minister anybody know that this means resurrection out from the dead see there's two resurrection at Malachi 4 revealed to us and so therefore he said that he had not attained he hadn't reached that perfect state that glorified state that a resurrection yet so therefore he said if by any means I might attain being been very humble America for said they're almost the same words if I might be there that right see yeah and look what both of them had then who are we to run around here with and taking these a spoken word books in because I trusted them all up there anything say I already got it already when two prophets they said if by any means they might attain to the resurrection out from the dead did you hear what I said a resurrection out from the dead Church what a prize now let's get it what a prize to have a chance to hear a message from a messenger to have a chance for the price you get it now church members don't have a chance for the prize foolish virgins wise virgins get a chance for the prize to be resurrected in the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection wow what a prize that is so Paul sit for that revelation I press forward toward the mark of this high calling God calling from up on high God sending down a revelation to the messenger and it comes from high down here and the message went out to eat elected ones hurry this guy in the dead church members sitting here Baptist Methodist Presbyterian and they don't hear nothing but you here for you heard from your theophanies your theophanies is calling you this morning hipper praise cup brother I know what I'm talking about I'm gonna add the Holy Spirit by the grace of Almighty God want to add glorified glorification and we hit that resurrection praise God the word we'll look the the body will materialize around the word it'll spin so many revolutions around this word in you and it'll be transformed from old dead carcass into a glorified body this calling me must be Anthony is calling me yet the Anthony is calling Eunice more to come praise God talking to brother borders yesterday he was telling me how man was dying he was a Christian didn't live too good you know because kind of a worldly Christian he was still a child of God he passed beyond the curtain but the board has told me and brother when he came back he began to preach to his family sitting at his bedside he said oh I come from a place where it is perfect pure perfect divine love he preached to the doctors to the nurses to everybody within earshot he preached to them about heaven and he went there and tasted it came back and God let him come back to preach for a season and then took him and he had a testimonial it is perfect whatever you do go there whatever you do don't go downstairs go upstairs till your heavenly called this morning and you we got the Osteen that's calling us up on high this morning they were wanting to be you learning with us after your knees praise the Lord my so Paul is saying here that God in Christ Jesus is calling us up which let's forget about down here brother these things they're gonna stay here amen list but we have a heavenly calling this morning we have a prize now the out resurrection sea is separated from the general resurrection and that's the bride and each age it's now beautiful perfection to make a full in and in complete and glorified state praise God Paul discounted all personal achievements the righteousness Paul said forget about it left it all behind them genuine righteousness which comes from faith in Christ is all that he wanted once the Holy Spirit apprehended him on the road to Damascus God had a purpose and apprehending him so then he when he realized that God's purpose in his life was that he should be perfect and sit down and his strong with him then Paul was effort to apprehend Christ you got it Christ apprehended him for a purpose then Paul realize it he was mature then he was out after Christ's but at all course he was going to apprehend him therefore what about us this morning God in a brat age on our road errand to Damascus called as an apprehended us knock us off our high horses and he's got a purpose for every one of us there's a place in the kingdom for everybody sitting here this morning brother he's got a huge portion of heaven awaiting you my god he got our Paris a mansion in heaven don't you know it is something laying on things that ought to be our sword years ago I preached it but I guess it went over the top of your heads but brother Bram said as we take the word here we are building our body there every word that we take here things ought to be we are building we're sending up Timbers for our bodies they're our glorified bodies we're building it right now this morning by receiving every word of God so therefore didn't win then if you reject one word then do not look for a glorified body in the resurrection from the dead praise Karl what a message a prophet of God has brought us or message where we are self thank you we ourselves have a chance to build our own glorified bodies by the Word of God and I can never preached it out there you know that amen praise the Lord but here spiritual things are spiritual people praise the Lord praise God so now Paul is saying here how change are my ambitions all I care for is to know Christ and to experience the power of his resurrection and they're here in his sufferings all the hardships that I have to go through here retain even nothing all your little things your faucet in and sniffing about it crying about this happened and that happened don't you even dare put on the same scale it won't even wear don't even try to put your little stinking trials on our own what God has for you my god pray you so long and this happened I can't wear this here and this is happening over here forget about it forget about that garbage don't eat garbage a minerals praise allah hook praise the Lord but the chili took the bread amen we don't know Gentile dogs we're children of the most high praise God and these sisters crying I bust the most skin down we know dresses and wanting to snip to hear how are you gonna wait at with what God's got for you over in glory over there trail some old fashion of this world cuckoo looking clothes and whatnot passing away to be burnt up but brother God's got our gown here for us beautiful white and gorgeous praise God and fit your right to you right to your size don't care whether you're fat skinny tall short God's got a same beautiful white Carmen for you praise amen that's it don't make any difference blessed be the name Allah I know where I'm going this morning brother praise God so Paul said that all too knows Paul st. here if by any means I can know him and Fellowship of his sufferings and know that here to taste it that I could do something here praise the Lord but I could be baptized with his baptism of sufferings as the early church was they forgot about everything else they had to wedding going on they were on the way to heaven praise the Lord they didn't care how they look you think brother bran worried about the styles when he had on the wedding garment he had a big texan head this way and a flowered tie and austere are looking suit it wasn't even thinking about it because levy i used to have to be could tell him how to dress what he care about this fashion of this world here brother here too they aged a lot all over top of him sighs or wonders he had to go on what he care about the fashion of the world praise the Lord amen but he wanted to know him is to experience a power that flows from a union praise God with the resurrected Jesus Christ and that's why I say if you don't have the Holy Ghost press into this Union for God has given you a promise and God cannot lie he's going to baptize you and it was only one thing you had to do brother man said walk into this baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's yours by full obedience to every word si just obey every word he only tested you see if you believe the word and he gives you the Holy Ghost to Pruit you didn't believe for the word and you do believe the word so into into a Fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death don't you rest day or night until you experience this desire and remember brother brands vision of heaven he said just be there oh he's remember the vision of heaven the the heavenly vision he said be there just beat it it's just beautiful and these things here forget about him see so therefore now see Church I believe the hours here when the green seed has matured and turning to this keeps coming to my heart the green seed has turned from a golden brown drying out brother here now here we are Philippians I'm a closeout here 45 minutes now flip is a three here I mean to let you go out of here this morning amen Philippians 3 it's one a drive with Karina homestretch now now here's the home stretch right here see Philippians 3:12 not as though I had already attained either were we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend therefore which also I am apprehended of Christ and may I say at this morning don't look at me because I'm reading this right here so don't think that I have anything more than you not that I have attained brother new rule I follow after see I follow after so don't look at me and feel short maybe some of you might and if I go here if I go here I mean God is here he's paid present future here in the local Christian Assembly and got nothing to do with me going out of here just you pray for me where I'm going but he's here with you right here don't ever forget that see we're going nowhere we'll be there together praise the Lord Amen see don't get nervous now Amen brethren I count not myself to have apprehended you saying again here but this one thing I do sing here forgetting those things which are behind I can't reach back on anything that I've done now that be I'll make it righteousness mine own you see the me now it's been the grace of Almighty God I can't take one thing and he's done through me all by me I can't say well I knew the Lord say so I we all of the same boat this morning that's all going up to his glory you got it narrow sorry just say you know I'm driving this down because you don't what's going to happen see and you might be looking at me look at me you look at Christ Sica I need this at just as well as you need it yes sir praise the Lord forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus now what Paul is doing here he's saying less he leave because the impression of having already arrived Paul carefully indicated he was still very much involved in the race of life and may I say by the grace of God unless you got any impression that I've got some kind of secret no uh-uh I am brother I am very much involved in the race of life I'm running for my life yes sir I'm running away from Satan for my life but I'm in a race and I got a goal I'm about your goal I know I gotta go sit him in and I'm looking for prize I'm not just in this race just water I being become saved no I'm in this for the prize this one prize first place I want it it's gold yes sir praise the Lord so now Paul here is cautioning against misinterpretations here I see but by there was in his Asia was those who were spreading around a little gospel that they were already perfect and whatnot and don't we had that same today soon as brother brown says malachi falls come here which is perfect is come everything is perfect that's all I heard there's someone because acknowledging and it they've been through that for is the Lord see and we've been through fighting it for ten years that we already perfect just wait for the tenth and all these things here no we don't want that in this church here brother we want some people here thus mind like Paul was pressing on toward the mark of the high calling Amen praise the Lord so we don't want that at ease in Zion spirit here you know we just want to have some hot coals in it in them seats there Amen see so narrow believe the message and all everything is fine forget about it see now that which Paul had not already attained was the experience of a complete and final knowledge of the Lord that's that perfect state that we all want to come to see and he said that I may know him don't ever stop don't keep on keeping on as we would say Amen see I have not attained myself I'm just a green seed trusting that I'll be got that I'm golden brown this morning that's the same as you are Amen but I feel with all my heart is jumping off a few things here I feel that we are right in the homestretch for Paul he was in the homestretch here Paul said but I press on strenuously if somehow I may overtake in lay hold of that which which I was taken captive by Christ Jesus on the deep the Damascus Road so now um God has a purpose and in your conversion and he wants you to press on for this prize amen see and that is the purpose is for you to be in his bride he had asked why this thing in you is beating out if you have a self style in Zion you would even worry about it you see well I'll be up dumb say Eve and so forth no but this pressing you and God put that deep in here searching and reaching and scratching and biting out there for something and he's got it hey man you know satisfy see praise the Lord now this nut yet state of Christian perfection see it destroys complacency you know everything is alright everything fine the lowest business here in New York no pets they come back and shake them up don't know and a feel all fine because so-and-so ain't got it out there maybe but shake them up and keep them on the toes that's what the Holy Spirit's doing right now you know keep you on your toes see and it demands a strenuous pursuit half of the price Amen see now Paul gives an illustration here in the 13th verse this one thing I do I press on this is like a foot race here see now he said the one thing here is singleness of purpose and concentration of effort that everything would be internet now not legalism now so yeah when you're preaching like people understand talk about no legalism see I mean just giving your heart to God and sweetness and nothing we can do in saying God all I can do is have the right attitude that's all I meant that's all he's asking it the right attitude that you don't want the things of the world but then he'll perfects you and take it away from you but don't you try to do it in yourself and think brother Coleman our brother Coleman said now we should be pressing and you pressing sweating now I talk about that no I'm just oppressing you just walk at ease and the Lord bless you and go on what you pressing you see the man now that's what I'm talking about I'm sorry I'm scar I mean what I do yesterday no that's not pressing that's a legalism say forget about that I don't mean it at all it's just a comon on here and at a funeral service drop this off because to your sisters there's a spirit that the women have to be if they serve their husband they serving God which is true and a lot of them fall back on and that's it and she's sitting here and this this brother was speaking about this sister who had just died she was a real precious sister and this poor sister was writing down everything he was saying she's I've done that I've done this I've done that then he got to certain things she said but she didn't do that and she was say it right there and here my wife sitting right there and wanting to tell of course Christ did that there for you already she couldn't say nothing you understand now we've seen that and my wife sat right next to this sister to a big man out there and she was wanting to please her husband as just man was saying that this sister had done and she was right and everything you see you write down what's in here you automatically please him most of all him hey if you do what's written down in here put on your ears and your eyes and everywhere what's here so yes that's legalism now that's trying to do this here that's a that's a call impersonation just let God come in and do it amen see and so Paul here is it struck me this morning it's a beautiful thing in me is next to me cuz I understand it see so Paul here is showing a runner who coming into the home stretch and coming on at last turn you got about 50 yards left and there is the gold and there's the prize and brother when you come off that Bank turn like down in Madison Square Garden and they all bank and bunched together well through tremendous training and hard training and severe training you train yourself to where there is something left in you for the home stretch and brother my I believe that the local Christian Assembly has got something left for the home stretch amen our number and Randall's Island running for cameras High School against Diva Clinton rivalry for years and Johnny Johnny Terrell the flying scudd the because city champion in the 440 yard because race there and the d2 20-yard dash champion he could be everybody but I believed that he could beat me hey no no sir he gotta beat me first so they're running the da Calais and I was ahead of him and he couldn't catch me everybody more but he couldn't get me and on the last Terios I got him I'm gonna show them the day you know submit me just a push push protection anything I'm do I got to win it crazy I'm not here fool around here beaten here I'm out here I'm going under the for prize I'm not just as fine himself style to be in the reservation I want to be it from the dead resurrection I want to be in the first resurrection and I'm coming around at home stretching their layout me about 50 yards I got it made and brother when you come to the home stretch that extra training that you got any coach will tell you begin to pump your arms and raise up your knees and begin to pump and stretch out amen that's it and it looks straight ahead and I began to float that I floated that turn and came off and I began to pump those legs and move those arms and Joey here see the coach said he says slow down because then and and by when he broke my stride and I let no interpretation break my stride he broke my stride and I look at him for one moment I should have had my eyes on the goal I looked at him because he distracted me I looked over him and he broke my stride and Johnny Taylor passed me and he beat me about a yard or so and my school was furious the everybody thought about 10,000 people saw him do that to me and they first at him and everything he said Joe I'm sorry he said because I felt that he could beat you he was the city champ okay who he is trained for that race to wear so don't you ever take your eyes off the goal don't let no interpretation no husband or wife or mother father no buy a diss track you from the prize get the prize I know what I had and that that thing changed my life right there when I win the arm even no matter where was that out to win praise the Lord for the prize amen so thinking about that there is that extra strength that you have coming down the homestretch and running a circle we call it a kick y'all know about a kick the man's got something left and he begins to kick and he just goes right on by the rest of them leaves him right there flat well brother God has got something for the bride to have a cake Holy Ghost kick coming down the homestretch such a power gonna come upon the bread she's gonna out and leave him like this sitting still my priests got run on into the resurrection into the rapture no wedding supper what a kick can you imagine we weary and tired come on at last turn but brother the power of God gonna fall for you and all of us so you're going to get a pump those arms and kick those knees up and come down the homestretch and you know right at the goal is Hebrews 12 all the heroes of faith say come on for the Ministry of Christ has been given you to raise the pit amen you believe him praise the Lord then don't faint God has a kick for you left for the home stretch and we are right in the homestretch so press toward the mark of the high calling of God which is in Christ Jesus the prize belongs to those who respond wholeheartedly to God's upward call away from self and toward new heights of spiritual attainment in Christ Jesus are you ready for that this morning you want new heights won't leave all this old foolishness down here well then let us therefore who are thus minded with like Paul and we Imbrium in the breath let us go on to the unity of the faith but now notice they had to if it's a 440 race we had to run 300 yards and actually get weary and tired before the kick came in the last 40 or 50 yards so if you say you're tired the kick is coming in the last 40 50 your hearts but you actually if you if you're not tired you have been in a race amen so if you're wearing to hell you must have been in a race and don't worry about it he's got a kick coming for you praise God so press toward tomorrow let's it be the name of the Lord first Corinthians 9:24 27 here well it speaks for itself I just wanted to four things here says be as earnest to win the prize crown in heaven as men are to win a race that's what he's talking about over here in 1st Corinthians be tempered in all things this refers to your hard training before a contests of boxing or wrestling because whatever it is and fight with absolute confidence in victory keep the body on and bring it into subjection praise God now Paul claims over here to be running the race to win and fight fight in the fight for the knockout blow in other words he said don't beat the air this is not shadow boxing now this is actually fighting amen see and therefore don't come out like this here that hit devil ass you push you away then ain't doing nothing you're fighting can you beat in the air look at my oh wow hey makeup from way back around here somewhere swinging it like that amen you beating the air Adele will just move aside and knock you out officer I had you understand but let's fight like Paul for it and train well Trey as brother Bram told us on the great Bell of a fourth hardest because our gunboats me that somebody would hit him it is good but it train him good they're right you remember praise the Lord so then we fight the dealt with combinations x2 38 st. mark 16 BAM the Hebrews 13:8 pound what a combination nuts them on every time see John 14:12 amen hey hey marvel m23 we have met that pal there you go praise the Lord it hits the mark every well well swing somewhere interpretation the devil just sidestep it and knock you out praise Scylla Hari do you love him amen praise God if these men trained for a corruptible crown that would just fade away what about a Christian that God has trainers for incorruptible crown how much more should we be ready to run the race I read a story about a little later learning to ride a bicycle he proudly told his sister I'm moving I'm really moving she calmly said to him as she was observing his wobbly progress she said you are moving but you're not going amen see so don't shadowboxing air fight the fight to win the match run to win the race notice now all are in the race of life but only one wins the prize so this morning we all in the race to the resurrection sure we all saved but Paul Tom are out from the general resurrection to the first resurrection that's surprised oh my just think we're going back to the beginning back to acts 2:38 one Lord one faith one baptism of the Holy Ghost one God who's in all that's where we are friends are you in a church triumphant or you know save his bride and God wouldn't have a word message if he didn't have a power God to back it up don't worry that extra kick is coming down the homestretch it's gonna take us the last 30 or 40 yards oh don't you love him praise his name Amen well thank the Lord isn't wonderful to know look this way we're gonna be in the sweet bye and bye amen praise God remember to keep your body under and Paul didn't want his body his soul to become a slave to his body so he had a personal sacrifice of walking with God sacrifice of things not necessary evil but which prevent the full devotion of the soul to God such as pleasures and worldly pursuits excuse me this is the age of luxury and the words have a real significance in our time this things that maybe not smoking and drinking like that but the other things that will keep you away from full devotion so Paul realizing these things here he fought and he brought his body under I'm thinking about a dream that brother brother down here in a tabernacle had but a ram spoke to him in a dream this brother Boris was telling me and he says you're worrying about all the ministers falling away stop worrying about him falling away he says anointed people would all and pray for the sick there may yet be a little time left and we fellowship with him and I just struck my heart revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come so I didn't say a word but there was brother Bremen a dream telling the the pastors and it have Knakal the anointing with oil and pray for to sing don't you know what that is friends that's get in order we've done that here amen Bible order and God I just read it to you it's such a time as a senior than a barn member December 30 we we spoke on it she put it in order he has a dream too who brother Collins there he said don't worry about the minister what they're doing you stand faithfully what a vindication that is to brother honey and myself here we did what here comes a dream the prophet of God tell him brother colors in the tabernacle forget about the ministers falling away and what they think and what they say on knowing and what all and pray for the sick there may yet be a little time left you know what that means don't you pray for the sick just signs when as the mirrors are gonna follow it praise God amen then there's brother heard the brothers was telling me two different variations of what he said - brother Sam currently out west here and he said that he asked brother Branham at the fire for ministry burns did not know more than that meanings in the fire for ministry another brother just told me that he said he sat down at they'd be five minutes let's go in the rapture no I don't I didn't I didn't speak to the man but boy is sure shaking I don't know what he meant by that but I'm believing the word I'm pressing on towards a mohawk myself I'm lining up myself with 2nd Corinthians 4 11 and 12 death to me and life to you I'm lining up myself with first Timothy 4:12 be an example before the flock an example in indeed and peered in charity and spirit you see what I'm talking about here so no doubt is something I always believe there's going to be few and everyone's in the race so let us run this race praise God for the prize now remember this morning there's nothing that we can do and Paul says here he did these thing to ministry now he did his things he says he says over here and first Corinthians 9 just want to drop this off to you that you know it's a tremendous responsibility here friends but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway he doesn't lose the salvation you tell my a crown here saying not salvation but i'm on a crown so now he's speaking here at the the when if you run track you sit around and you wait under the stands in the stands and a hero calls your race all those who are going to running in the 40 for the 440 - go to the mark see somebody calls that out and go to the market get ready for the next race well that same word has to do what a preacher in the greek so a preacher calls you to the race of life the gospel by the gospel then after the preacher calls you to the race of life all the same here himself that but he keeps under his body lest he should be a castaway disproved you understand so brother that's where we stand this more in the ministry I just just repeated that about brother Sam County I don't be caught in here that I don't know what that's all about but I'm just saying it really keeps me on the mark that's what I'm saying if to myself for so therefore Paul's saying here he's summoned many to the race of Christian life through the gospel you did it not to become a castaway that after the word means disapproved so he didn't want to be that scene and but clearly the Prophet here apostle was concerned let C be B because b we are rejected by the umpire for the prize so I'm doing my surprise Amen sing it's the goal of the pricee he had no fear of the hero barring him from the race for he said all run the race you got it now so we all in the race so everybody's in the race but what he was talking about a fear of this prize asked the thing saying but all not all received a prize and Paul wanted to receive the prize what prize you're talking about brother Coleman the one in the sweet by and by shall we stand in sweet hi we shell me [Music] for sure in the sweet by we show me on that you G for sure
