[0:46] the Lord test you to stretch
[0:49] out amen so I know
[0:55] amen so praise the Lord Revelation 1
[1:00] first verse the revelation of Jesus
[1:03] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[1:06] unto his servants things which must
[1:08] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:11] signified by his Angel unto his servant
[1:14] John who bear record of the word of God
[1:17] and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[1:20] of all things that he saw blessed is he
[1:23] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:26] words of this prophecy just to read it

[22:41] Pentecostal age trying to be sweet for
[22:44] them
[22:46] TI they was in Noah's time they was in
[22:49] every time put out of their churches
[22:52] because they believe in Jesus anybody
[22:54] listened to him had to be excommunicated
[22:56] from their Church see but he had that
[22:58] dispensation that was his time the son's
[23:02] dispensation now you know if God didn't
[23:05] start this church in my home and they
[23:08] had brought me in I've been put out a
[23:09] long time
[23:10] [Applause]

[23:41] we are you may be seated now we find
[23:43] also that the great Holy Spirit
[23:45] prophesied of that you want to put some
[23:47] of these scriptures down Matthew 24 and
[23:50] then put 2 Timothy 3:1 the Holy Spirit
[23:53] speaks of a great intellectual age at
[23:56] the end time did you know that why is it
[23:59] do youall finally understand what I'm
[24:01] talking about this age was prophesied to
[24:04] be here in
[24:06] [Music]
[24:08] [Applause]
[24:10] 1946 they would be waiting for God
[24:13] judged Pentecost but World War II and
[24:16] these leftover Pentecostal Spirits would
[24:18] be here in
[24:20] 1946 then God would send the seed that's
[24:23] hid in the Shu the Seven Seals
[24:28] then that seed would have three
[24:32] pulls healing then that second pull I'm
[24:35] identified with the prophet my second
[24:38] pull is identified with his second pull
[24:41] for he blasted pain to face
[24:43] Jezebel's he blasted bullheaded women he
[24:46] blasted lazy preachers he blasted filth
[24:49] and Bunko Gams and card parties and TVs
[24:53] and
[24:54] ungodliness fornication adulterers he
[24:57] bless and so did I ask him I'm
[24:59] identified praise God therefore that's
[25:02] the anointing that's the
[25:04] spirit Hallelujah that's my spirit I
[25:08] hate

[45:52] nobody ordains theine for Ministry God
[45:54] does
[45:57] so nobody can put their hand on the

[46:01] nine spiritual
[46:03] gifts that come from the people that
[46:06] come among the people that is knowledge
[46:08] and wisdom and Gifts of healing and
[46:09] working on Miracles and speaking with
[46:11] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[46:12] and all these things go in each local
[46:14] church and every person in the church
[46:16] has an individual Ministry and that
[46:18] individual Ministry goes together with
[46:20] the rest of the ministry to edify the

[47:06] Messiah and God places in the pride of
[47:09] five-fold ministry to keep that

[47:15] straight now the Messiah is here the
[47:19] prophet revealed
[47:23] Messiah the prophet left and left
[47:25] Messiah here
