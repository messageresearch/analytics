[1:01:07] but then we must be the right kind of
[1:01:09] children tutored by the right
[1:01:13] tutor how could the Pentecostal 1906 be
[1:01:16] in adoption when they had
[1:01:18] gifts amen so they had to wait till the
[1:01:21] prophet brought the Holy Spirit the

[1:02:27] Behavior amen
[1:02:29] sanctification set out to
[1:02:34] adoption amen see obedience to the word
[1:02:38] see now when Jesus had been obedient
[1:02:41] Jesus to God God plac him positionally
[1:02:43] this is
[1:02:44] him he was born he's my son born in the
[1:02:47] kingdom of God Amen brother BR was born
[1:02:51] into the kingdom of God a minister 1946
[1:02:54] God positionally placed him but he but
[1:02:57] he's higher than us so he went out into
[1:02:59] in 1946 along with all robbers and the
[1:03:02] rest of them he was the only one that
[1:03:03] was adopted all the rest of them fail
[1:03:06] but then he had to go one step higher he
[1:03:08] had to bring God
[1:03:11] down his first pole second pole was
[1:03:13] doing his work in the Kingdom but the
[1:03:15] third pole was God himself coming
[1:03:18] down oh see his ministry is higher
[1:03:22] amen now when members born by here it is
[1:03:26] by the Holy Ghost into the family of God
[1:03:29] and has proven to have these virtues in

[1:08:00] world war he had the volumes on it and
[1:08:03] Kaiser wilham said he never issued any
[1:08:06] orders to stop the war nobody knew how
[1:08:09] to war stopped but God stopped the war
[1:08:13] because Revelation 7 says he that there
[1:08:15] come an angel from the East to seal
[1:08:18] 144,000 and the Four Angels had to hold
[1:08:21] back the winds the war and strife until
[1:08:24] Israel be sealed but in there also was
[1:08:27] some Gentiles you and I that had to be
[1:08:29] sealed also amen since 194 so God
[1:08:33] stopped the war
[1:08:34] himself right when the Holy Spirit fell
[1:08:37] in 1906 there was a plague in there
[1:08:40] influenza that right and it killed over
[1:08:42] 20 million people I believe it was and
