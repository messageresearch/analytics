[0:56] words to the people for this last
[0:59] service before the the great uh
[1:01] convention we pray almighty God and ask
[1:03] the blessing in Jesus name his sake amen
[1:06] would you open your Bibles to uh I'll
[1:08] just read it quickly because it's only
[1:10] one scripture uh Genesis
[1:13] 18:14 is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:16] at the time appointed I will return unto
[1:18] thee according to the time of life and
[1:21] Sarah shall have a son may God add a
[1:24] bless in the reading of his word you may
[1:26] be
[1:28] seated
[1:30] Well church uh I want to quickly speak
[1:33] to you this has been a very
[1:35] trying uh uh week from more than a week
[1:40] actually and I was expecting to be
[1:42] healed or looking to be healed and if
[1:45] it's God's Will and then uh I thought
[1:48] maybe I would uh
[1:51] climax all that has been going on since
[1:53] April the 4th or really uh March 21st
[1:57] when we started playing the tapes but
[1:59] but uh doesn't seem to be God's will and
[2:03] I had mind battles all week to know what
[2:05] to do and how to do it and so forth but
[2:09] anyway uh God is
[2:12] good
[2:15] so I
[2:17] just I just have to stay with it and uh
[2:20] so this is the last service before pen
[2:24] Harris and I just pray that um everybody
[2:28] here would be prepared and to uh a group
[2:31] will come out of this barley
[2:34] Revelation and be ready to be wheat in
[2:37] the hot July sun in
[2:43] July
[2:45] so and we know that March April May
[2:48] June uh because of life from the
[2:52] promises of the original uh early bride
[2:56] has come back to us in the form of
[2:58] Revelation from the from the elm series
[3:02] and as you know as I read to you before
[3:04] because the wheat life I before how a
[3:09] wheat comes up in the fall a stand comes
[3:12] up and um then it stands there all
[3:16] through the winter it lays it is dormant
[3:19] nothing can happen that's why because
[3:22] the farmer does not go out and look at
[3:23] the wheat field in the winter time
[3:26] neither does he do it in the
[3:28] springtime he doesn't do it than either
[3:30] but then in the spring comes the latter
[3:33] rain and the cat rain doctrines coming
[3:37] back to you as
[3:43] rain uh where was thou
[3:46] job and who God is and who you are and
[3:50] who Satan is That's All Out of
[3:58] Rain
[4:00] and the latter of rain is supposed to
[4:03] come into the wheat in March April May
[4:07] June and they call it the food value and
[4:11] all of it should be in by
[4:14] June and then the wheat is uh matured
[4:19] she's ready but uh she's now ready of 1
[4:23] Corinthians 26 how be it we speak wisdom
[4:26] among them that are perfect amen meaning
[4:29] mature
[4:30] no more
[4:35] babies
[4:37] amen and all of the uh promises are in
[4:41] in the bride and then the wheat is still
[4:45] moist and um it's still moist and as we
[4:49] know um July is the time for the hot sun
[4:54] of July and um
[4:57] also we understand about about February
[5:00] 28th when the seven angels come and then
[5:04] as they faded away it turned into into
[5:07] Christ and made the head hman head of
[5:10] Christ and then it stayed after the
[5:13] prophet 7even SE 7 Thunder
[5:17] message uh the cloud stayed
[5:19] sunlit for 28 uh minutes
[5:23] after so we understand what that is
[5:26] that's the Dynamics to your mechanics
[5:34] so I ask a
[5:36] question could that sunlit could that be
[5:42] also the hot July
[5:48] Sun ask your
[5:51] question so if it is then it'll be elim
[5:56] returning in power in the time of life
[5:59] life as as Dynamics to the
[6:04] mechanics so brother Norman you can put
[6:06] this down so I do want to greet everyone
[6:10] uh down in Puerto Rico and Fort Wayne
[6:12] and all around in our church here
[6:14] massachusett Upstate New York and all
[6:16] around so today's tape uh is from
[6:20] December 6
[6:21] 1981 to know him from the
[6:25] beginning now um on page seven
[6:30] I don't know how even doing what I'm
[6:33] doing now I just had a chance to put a
[6:36] few notes down page 7 1 2 3 uh fourth
[6:41] paragraph and so to know him from the
[6:43] beginning September 12 1981 the Lord
[6:46] spoke to my heart the following three
[6:48] messages I had no context in the
[6:51] beginning was the word but from the
[6:53] beginning was not so he told me that he
[6:57] told me that that one would be for the
[6:59] church and so it was for the church and
[7:03] then to know him from the beginning and
[7:07] he told me that this one would identify
[7:10] the adoption
[7:12] season so today we want to get in the
[7:14] last bit of food
[7:17] value for
[7:20] June
[7:21] amen now you know
[7:25] um the three phases that the lord gave
[7:28] me in May
[7:31] 1974 and he identified the second fa a
[7:34] part of it which was Brotherly Love
[7:36] brotherly kindness and he identified
[7:38] that in 74 in June down in Georgia also
[7:42] then the other second part he identified
[7:44] it in September through November uh with
[7:48] the revelation of the seven thund
[7:49] Revelation and that was the Holy decency
[7:52] which is the blood amen and the Holy
[7:55] Spirit followed the blood named word see
[8:00] in every
[8:03] age to make sure it come
[8:08] forth the same holy spirit is going to
[8:11] follow the blood
[8:14] today the seventh Thunder blood which is
[8:18] your name which is your life you're
[8:21] going to follow
[8:22] that and that's what the third phase is
[8:25] all
[8:27] about amen
[8:32] so
[8:37] amen
[8:39] yes so you may be seated so the third
[8:43] phase is place in Christ adoption time
[8:47] Joseph Perfection now brotherly love
[8:51] that was a working of the Holy Spirit
[8:54] holy Dey has been a working of the Holy
[8:57] Spirit and this is the 30th year year
[9:00] now notice the three phases and I in
[9:05] 1992 I believe yeah uh May
[9:08] 6 uh he spoke to me again and told me
[9:11] that my third phase would automatically
[9:15] when we hit it the third phase it
[9:18] automatically hook Connect into the
[9:21] prophet's thirdd pull the opening of the
[9:24] word the mystery is
[9:27] revealed amen
[9:31] so these first two Revelations working
[9:35] of the Holy Spirit on the third phase it
[9:38] will prove whether this is of God or
[9:43] not because it'll Connect into the
[9:45] prophet's third
[9:47] pole which is plac in Christ and and
[9:50] because the Vindication will be there
[9:53] now remember when something is revealed
[9:56] is Al is already is also Vindicated
[10:00] and you find that quote on Fourth
[10:02] seal so brother brandom he revealed the
[10:05] Seven Seals the mystery there and what
[10:09] was under the seventh seal uh three
[10:11] phases there and seven Thunders banging
[10:14] close together there but it wasn't time
[10:16] cuz it was connected to the coming of
[10:18] the Lord so therefore then he went out
[10:21] with seven uh seals revealed and that
[10:25] was his
[10:28] vindication so therefore when the word
[10:31] is revealed that is the
[10:33] Vindication well if the seven thund is
[10:35] revealed that's the
[10:40] Vindication if Elohim is revealed that's
[10:44] the
[10:47] Vindication so I feel that we have to
[10:51] come back to brotherly kind may be
[10:53] seated brotherly kind and forgiveness to
[10:57] understand our requirement for the age
[11:00] then we can pick up pastri for in the
[11:03] fourth
[11:04] seal and brother bramma world falling AP
[11:07] sh Port he said just as every age met
[11:12] their
[11:13] requirement am Faith virtue knowledge
[11:16] and so forth Temperance patience so will
[11:20] this age hit their
[11:24] requirement we going to hit
[11:27] it amen
[11:32] so may be seated so I feel that we have
[11:37] to come back to brotherly kindness
[11:39] forgiveness and that's why the Holy
[11:40] Spirit left AE I should say uh and of
[11:46] someh have compassion and forgiveness in
[11:49] 1974 and we didn't pick it up until last
[11:51] year brother Norman found it it was hid
[11:54] in a box of South African tapes so the
[11:57] Lord HD it back for this season cuz we
[12:00] have to pick it
[12:02] up you got it
[12:04] now so now so to understand our
[12:08] requirement for the age then we can pick
[12:11] up page 304 fourth seal wait till the
[12:14] seven Thunders utter their voices to
[12:18] that group who can hand the word there
[12:21] notice then the quote goes in to the
[12:25] third phase because third phase adoption
[12:28] time SP spoken word bride quote it'll
[12:32] slice when you can hand the word Elohim
[12:35] and so forth am it'll slice and cut they
[12:38] can close the heavens they can do this
[12:41] or do whatever they want to so therefore
[12:44] that is the third pull
[12:46] friends so but we need a revelation of
[12:50] Brotherly kindness and forgiveness and
[12:53] able to hook in and for them Thunders to
[12:58] because
[12:59] their voices to
[13:01] you and then you're going to be in a
[13:04] Revival so I like to take you I'd like
[13:09] to take you down to Georgia again we did
[13:11] it I think Wednesday but everybody
[13:13] wasn't here so I want the whole church
[13:16] to know what this is all about so there
[13:19] be no excuses so brother Norman would
[13:22] you take us down to Georgia and they can
[13:24] hear the excerpts again brother
[13:27] Norman see and you'll see the Sheep of
[13:30] God come screaming forth praising to God
[13:33] men down on those intellectual powers
[13:36] and whatnot their interpretations
[13:39] manmade
[13:40] ideas when the real David takes a stone
[13:43] of that rock of the revelation of Jesus
[13:45] Christ when that David stands out with
[13:47] that confession of what the seven seal
[13:49] is when did that happen here is when God
[13:55] come down from heaven and thundered out
[13:58] the revelation
[13:59] [Applause]
[14:03] down in Georgia holy spirit is playing
[14:06] back for you this morning every
[14:08] promise belongs to the Bride of Jesus
[14:11] Christ tonight for Jesus died for every
[14:14] blood redeemed promise and is for you
[14:18] the Bride of Jesus
[14:19] Christ therefore we have a charge
[14:21] minister to preach the word in season
[14:24] out of season oh what a charge to preach
[14:27] the word praise God I believe this is
[14:30] the season when the people will stop
[14:31] running from the word and they'll fall
[14:33] upon the sword and you put it in with
[14:35] love speak the truth in love not speak
[14:39] loveely the truth hallelujah just speak
[14:42] the truth in love amen praise the Lord
[14:46] you know the Ten Commandments the first
[14:47] four is our attitude toward God and the
[14:50] next six is our attitude toward our
[14:52] neighbor amen amen if you love your
[14:54] neighbor you will tell your neighbor
[14:56] about God first amen and as a me if I
[14:59] love my neighbor that's you I'll tell
[15:00] you that God don't want no Idols before
[15:02] him amen because I love you I speak the
[15:06] truth about him first but I speak it in
[15:09] love for you so you know that amen
[15:12] praise God so now we are exalting one
[15:15] another to good works and provoking unto
[15:18] love and I'm here to exalt you praise
[15:21] God the people to enjoy their Blood
[15:24] Washed redeemed rights unto love and
[15:27] unity of the faith but now watch here
[15:29] there are many weak ones and those who
[15:31] don't understand God's Will and so
[15:33] therefore there's a scripture here and
[15:36] of some have
[15:38] compassion oh what a revelation brother
[15:42] there are weak ones there ignorant ones
[15:44] who don't don't have the same Revelation
[15:46] that you have and here is now we in the
[15:49] word now back to the word every word man
[15:53] shall not live by bread alone but by
[15:55] every word that proceedeth for from the
[15:56] mouth of God therefore I'm not
[15:59] interested in what that brother believes
[16:01] do he believe in Malachi 4 that's the
[16:03] the beginning there does he believe that
[16:05] well it may be all uh this way and that
[16:07] way that's all right see uh Temperance
[16:10] amen Longs suffering long suffering
[16:15] stretch your way out amen praise God see
[16:19] and I'm persuaded God able to take care
[16:21] of his own now see therefore the I feel
[16:24] that there's coming forth a true
[16:26] Revelation on brotherly kindness that'll
[16:29] just sweep sweep over us something will
[16:31] happen to us brother Brown said on the
[16:33] throne of mercy and judgment oh what
[16:35] jville Indiana needs tonight what the
[16:38] world needs tonight is thousands of
[16:40] lived
[16:42] voices did you hear what I said a live
[16:45] voice then the voice of God come down
[16:48] through Malachi for as a
[16:50] shout and we were we just supposed to
[16:53] walk around Jericho as it was he and he
[16:56] said when I B you to shout shout
[17:00] yes maybe tonight we can begin to
[17:04] shout amen the Holy Spirit anoint our
[17:07] miles to shout the real message out not
[17:10] from interpretation but what he saiding
[17:12] shout it out but it takes a live voice
[17:15] first you must live the word first and
[17:18] and and and and and oh my and the
[17:21] devil's getting matter and matter as you
[17:23] am and when you hit that brotherly
[17:26] kindness oh brother I see him going out
[17:28] the door tonight he said don't let them
[17:31] add that please Philistines please
[17:33] demons don't let them add brotherly
[17:36] kinds for we are
[17:38] gone we are finished if they ever get
[17:41] the Revelation to forgive their brothers
[17:46] we are
[17:48] [Applause]
[17:51] finished
[17:52] [Applause]
[17:54] PR oh they they getting close they
[17:58] getting tools they lay word word word
[18:00] word they going to find the secret is
[18:02] lay in
[18:04] forgiveness that's a condition that men
[18:07] sins are forgiven on forgiveness of
[18:10] man praise God When you stand friend
[18:14] before you can receive the spoken word
[18:17] promises forgive you
[18:20] brother oh my if you don't forgive him
[18:24] if you have an art you got agree if you
[18:27] right he come to you you forgive
[18:31] him otherwise your heavenly father
[18:34] cannot forgive you in the bright age in
[18:36] the word
[18:37] age and the devil want to keep that away
[18:40] from you now so you w't that because
[18:42] nobody preach that now screw all around
[18:44] it but I feel maybe tonight the secret
[18:47] is
[18:51] out you talking about healing the faith
[18:54] bank will sweep all over this place here
[18:56] it'll blow off the camp up there

[19:38] peace he was God's anointed but here was
[19:40] another man that was God's anointed also

[22:26] is in you and he is in the world
[22:28] brother we here what a revelation oh my
[22:31] yes sir I'm persuaded God has sent forth
[22:34] that Revelation like a thunder my just
[22:36] thund all down throughs has been
[22:38] happening to us ever
[22:40] since well church he
[22:44] [Applause]
[22:46] are do you understand
[22:48] it did you catch what it
[22:51] said forgiveness
[22:53] first then revelation of seven Thunders
[22:57] amen
[22:59] I'll say it
[23:01] again forgiveness brotherly kindness
[23:05] first other words brotherly kindness and
[23:09] forgiveness is the seventh age
[23:12] requirement God will give you nothing
[23:15] unless you hit that
[23:19] requirement are you getting it
[23:22] now so you can shout you can do anything
[23:26] you want to do but you don't get nothing
[23:28] amen until you live that word

[35:31] Mystery and that's what's being given to
[35:37] you not to a church
[35:43] member the prophet is thanking God that
[35:46] God let him see that Revelation may be
[35:48] seated how Paul arenus Martin Columbo
[35:52] they had the seed and they were coming
[35:54] on to adoption amen the seed with kept

[38:30] tsel in the husk all gathers in the
[38:33] seed and the life that was in the St one
[38:36] went to make the other justification
[38:38] made a way for sanctification
[38:40] sanctification made a way for the
[38:42] baptism of Holy Ghost Pentecost the
[38:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost those who have
[38:46] it now uh made a way for the Holy Ghost
[38:50] itself to come right down in Perfection

[39:13] his Masterpiece see it's the word that
[39:15] he can work through make manifest

[46:25] wheat that's laying there it'll go to
[46:28] taking
[46:29] life after a while the it been through

[47:07] Harvest you see the same sun shining
[47:10] today in January December that's up
[47:13] there bathing that snow and melted down
[47:15] on that grain bringing it water it's the
[47:17] same Sun but what uh but that wheat
[47:20] could not live in that same sunlight in
[47:23] June can't do it the Sun comes a little
[47:26] stronger each day and the green should
[47:28] be a little more matured to receive the
[47:31] sunlight in other words after March
[47:34] April May and June the grain should be a
[47:37] little more matured to receive the
[47:40] sunlight of the hot sunlight of
[47:50] July so um Cod uh seven Church AG
[47:57] uh page 965 paragraph 204 like the other
[48:02] day I got something mixed up I happen to
[48:04] hear it I caught it right there it's on
[48:07] the tape I'll probably hear from it when
[48:09] I was talking about the seven trumpets I
[48:12] said there was seven trumpets I was
[48:14] referring to the Pentecostal Feast from
[48:16] the Pentecostal Feast until the until
[48:18] the trumpets there was seventh Sabbath
[48:21] so don't try to understand this here
[48:23] seventh Sabbath was between the Feast of
[48:25] pass over to Pentecost you see which
[48:27] made the 50 days but I was referring to
[48:30] being that I said that means the seven
[48:32] Church ages now did you understand that
[48:35] I don't think
[48:37] so just listen to what he's saying here
[48:40] so now brother Bram is correcting this
[48:43] cuz he cuz he said something here but he
[48:45] applied it over there you see on that
[48:48] tape if you haven't if you happen to get
[48:51] it or or anything on that tapable it
[48:54] should be that the seventh month after
[48:57] that brought in the Feast of the
[48:59] trumpets which meant the seven Church
[49:01] ages seven months not seven sabbaths
[49:04] seven uh I did explain it on there I
[49:06] said there seven sabbaths like that but
[49:09] then I carried that same thought on over
[49:12] when it's the seventh month after the
[49:15] Feast of the Passover or after the Feast
[49:18] of Pentecost then come the feast after
[49:21] the sheath was brought in Wade you see
[49:24] remember there now the sheath turns into
[49:28] a loaf of bread after that
[49:30] time one sheath then all goes into one
[49:33] loaf it's a old it's a great teaching
[49:37] there I didn't touch the edge of it now
[49:40] watch but if you happen to catch that on
[49:43] your tape remember look in the Bible you
[49:46] see it's 7 months after that count off
[49:50] seven months January February March
[49:52] April May June July it would be July
[49:57] 7even months which represents the the
[50:00] full seven Church ages some Minister
[50:04] might pick that up and then you would
[50:06] have
[50:10] it do you have
[50:13] it are you looking for
[50:15] July looking for pen
[50:18] Harris are you ready to
[50:24] shout
[50:27] well praise
[50:37] God Amen so now do you understand what
[50:41] I've been saying may be seated more
[50:43] other words the winter nothing since
[50:46] 1966 nothing winter why would the farmer

[55:07] Luther Wesley Pentecost may be seated
[55:09] they had the Dynamics and mechanics
[55:11] together for their day and brother Brown
[55:14] said what about our day the church
[55:16] should be prayed up ready to go out to
[55:18] meet God with every blessing for the
[55:22] bride in her and then he said page 25 he
[55:26] said here the church will come through
[55:29] justification through Luther through
[55:31] sanctification through Wesley through
[55:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[55:35] Pentecostals and grow right on into the
[55:38] Perfection of the son of man that when
[55:41] husband and wife will be the same self
[55:43] persons God will be so manifested into
[55:47] his bride his church till they will both
[55:51] be the
[55:52] same they are one now you see where we
[55:55] at amen now who's going to do this
[55:58] friends well here's where we at uh 1
[56:02] Thessalonians 4:16 of course you know
[56:04] what it is Jesus does all three that was
[56:07] the thunder on that Rapture tape so the
[56:11] shout of course was Elohim because
[56:13] revealing the word taking us back to the
[56:15] word and all the Hidden Mysteries and
[56:17] now we're at the voice of the
[56:19] Archangel last night's tape uh charity I
[56:23] put it there because charity is is
[56:26] Michael the voice of the
[56:28] Archangel charity is
[56:30] Christ so Christ reveal his own word
[56:33] here's your promise page 19 and 20 see
[56:37] down through the age we started off from
[56:38] the
[56:40] foundation from the first church age
[56:43] when the seed went in the ground the
[56:45] complete seed then they come up through
[56:48] the feet Luther come back through Wesley
[56:52] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now
[56:54] in the eyes
[56:55] prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth do
[56:58] you understand it now prophetic eyes
[57:00] Malachi 4 shout first phase of the
[57:04] three-fold uh uh seventh seal you got it
[57:08] now he bringing the message the shout of
[57:11] the king that's I is
[57:14] prophetic and now there's nothing else
[57:17] left for it to come but him himself to
[57:23] step into that because that's the last
[57:26] thing there is the next is the
[57:30] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[57:32] of our own it's his we have no sight of
[57:35] our own how can a man foresee these
[57:37] things he can't do it it's God himself
[57:40] it's BEC coming to a place and he's
[57:42] governing the body all the way through
[57:44] then the complete body of Christ is
[57:46] revealed in the form of a bride that
[57:48] will take out of his side like Adam did
[57:50] at the beginning and there we are now
[57:53] you understand that now Malachi for was
[57:55] the eye time there's nothing left but
[57:58] the
[57:59] intelligence and that's the middle
[58:04] part
[58:06] okay God stretched his tent Jesus Christ
[58:10] to the
[58:11] [Music]
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:15] Earth
[58:16] okay page 39 here is it is is in here
[58:19] twice and this is a thunder here cuz
[58:22] nobody knew this amen uh you it's a
[58:24] hidden Mystery you can't see with your
[58:27] hands yet it's part of the body you
[58:29] can't see what the ears yet it can hear
[58:31] you can't see what the nose it smells
[58:33] you can't see with the lips though it
[58:35] speaks that was the Pentecost age but
[58:38] now is in the eye time the sin Malachi 4
[58:42] now there isn't one moving faculty
[58:44] beyond the eye is that right the next is
[58:47] the intelligence which is Christ itself
[58:51] here we are who controls the whole body
[58:54] no moving beyond that everything else
[58:57] has moved so he will be here to control
[59:00] this
[59:01] church he will be veiled in the fire for
[59:05] Ministry speaking the truth in
[59:08] love telling you be no more babies be no
[59:11] more
[59:13] children oh well we're
[59:16] here
[59:18] amen so
[59:21] now Christy intelligence may be seated
[59:25] the voice of the Archangel charity
[59:27] adopts you then it becomes charity the
[59:30] voice of the Archangel and you will
[59:32] understand today's message because now
[59:35] you will understand today's message I'm
[59:36] getting ready I'm finished uh be you
[59:39] will become a young man and stop being a
[59:40] child little children and in in your
[59:44] place of trying 2 Peter 1: 14-7 pressing
[59:48] on to know him then adopted as a father
[59:52] and set out into in the Kingdom as a

[1:00:59] hidden behind all the dust and dirt not
[1:01:03] just one coin but seven or eight gold
[1:01:06] coins on the wall was a calendar that
[1:01:10] was turned to the
[1:01:13] 1970s but I can't remember which year
