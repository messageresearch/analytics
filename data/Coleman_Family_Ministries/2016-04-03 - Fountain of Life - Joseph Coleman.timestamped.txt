[0:00] Well, praise the Lord. So, we want to
[0:02] turn to the word of God now. Um, let us
[0:06] turn to p um St. John the 1 chapter.
[0:10] I want to read from St. John the 1st
[0:12] chapter uh verse 1-13.
[0:17] And Psalms 36:9.
[0:22] Well, it certainly feels fine to be here
[0:24] this morning. Amen. and to fellowship
[0:28] around the word of God
[0:30] and knowing that we're in this
[0:32] tremendous time
[0:34] of looking for something to happen. It's
[0:38] going to happen because it has been
[0:40] spoken.
[0:40] Amen.
[0:41] And this is the season. The Lord has
[0:44] shown us all different things and we're
[0:47] certainly happy that he has anointed our
[0:50] eyes to see and to understand these
[0:52] things.
[0:55] St. John the first chapter.
[0:58] In the beginning was the word
[1:02] and the word was with God and the word
[1:06] was God.
[1:08] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:12] All things were made by him and without
[1:15] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:19] In him was life and the life was the
[1:22] light of man. and the light shineth in
[1:25] darkness, and the dark darkness
[1:27] comprehended not.
[1:30] There was a man sent from God, whose
[1:32] name was John. The same came for a
[1:35] witness to bear witness of the light,
[1:38] that all men through him might believe.
[1:41] He was not that light, but was sent to
[1:44] bear witness of that light.
[1:48] That was the true light which lightth
[1:50] every man that cometh into the world. He
[1:54] was in the world, and the world was made
[1:56] by him, and the world knew him not. He
[2:00] came unto his own, and his own received
[2:02] him not.
[2:04] But as many as received him, to them
[2:07] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[2:10] even to them that believe on his name,
[2:14] which were born not of blood, nor of the
[2:17] will of flesh, nor of the will of man,
[2:20] but of God.
[2:22] Psalm
[2:24] 36
[2:28] 9
[2:36] for with thee is the fountain of life.
[2:40] In thy light shall we see light. May
[2:43] your Lord blessing through the reading
[2:45] of his word. Father give us a title. I
[2:48] like to title it fountain of life.
[2:52] For we see plainly that the word of God
[2:54] tells us here in Psalm 36
[2:57] that the psalmist is saying that for
[3:01] with thee is the fountain of life.
[3:06] In thy light shall we see light.
[3:10] Then light life and light go together.
[3:14] [Music]
[3:15] Life is light
[3:18] and death is darkness.
[3:21] Here we learn that God is the source of
[3:25] all life and light.
[3:29] There are no exceptions to the rule for
[3:33] God is the source. I don't care what man
[3:36] says. He's trying to be the source
[3:37] himself. And with these artificial heart
[3:40] transplants and so forth, trying to
[3:42] bring out the a gene, the seeds to bring
[3:46] life. But God is the source of all life
[3:49] because he only perverts it. And Genesis
[3:52] 1 says, "In the beginning, God created
[3:54] the heaven and the earth, and the earth
[3:56] was without form and void, and darkness
[3:59] was upon the face of the deep, and the
[4:02] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[4:04] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[4:06] light." And there was light. And so we
[4:09] see then that God is light and he is
[4:12] life.
[4:15] And all of existence, see, owes his
[4:19] origin to God.
[4:21] Amen.
[4:21] That's what he said here. See, he says
[4:23] right here, all things were made by him,
[4:26] and without him was not anything made
[4:28] that was made.
[4:30] Amen.
[4:31] In him was life, and the life, the life
[4:34] was the light of men.
[4:37] Now, John the Baptist was a light,
[4:41] but he was not that light,
[4:44] for he only came to bear witness of the
[4:47] great light.
[4:49] Amen. So, and right on down, all his
[4:52] prophets, messengers, sons and daughters
[4:55] of God, we are all the rest of of God's
[4:59] children. We're not that great light,
[5:02] but we are here to bear witness
[5:06] of the light for our age, this age here.
[5:10] Amen.
[5:12] Now, we were speaking last Sunday about
[5:14] faith and dropped in a little thing
[5:16] about faith. Faith is designed to see
[5:19] what God wills and wants. There is no
[5:23] knowledge that can do that.
[5:26] Faith alone is designed to give to the
[5:28] human race to find out what the will of
[5:31] God is.
[5:32] God himself designed faith in such a way
[5:35] that he would give faith to the sons and
[5:37] daughters of God.
[5:39] See, and and with this faith, they would
[5:41] know his will.
[5:42] They would know what he want. They would
[5:43] know his purpose. They would know who
[5:45] they are and what they're supposed to
[5:46] do.
[5:47] Now, this faith is a seed. And the seed
[5:51] is the word of God. See, then the seed
[5:54] is the word. The word is life and life
[5:58] is light.
[5:58] Amen.
[5:59] Amen. Just simple. See, and and in the
[6:02] restored back faith that Malachi 4
[6:07] restored back was life. Amen.
[6:11] And that life is light.
[6:13] See? And and and then therefore we who
[6:16] were in darkness in Leosa
[6:19] are great light. The same one that was
[6:22] in human skin up on the earth.
[6:24] Amen.
[6:24] That same light moved in another portion
[6:29] of earth called William Brandham.
[6:31] It was hid there.
[6:33] It was life logos,
[6:35] the the great anointing.
[6:37] Oh yeah.
[6:38] And when it it it it it opened up the
[6:41] word of God for the age. See, it opened
[6:43] all the word. And it opened all the
[6:46] word. The seven seals with the seven
[6:47] thunders. It didn't add anything. It
[6:51] pointed back to the great light that
[6:55] walked on the earth before.
[6:57] It pointed right straight back.
[6:58] And it pointed right straight back. It
[7:00] was restoring back the great light that
[7:03] walked this earth and flesh here. See?
[7:05] Point us right back. And then our eyes
[7:08] was anointed with pies.
[7:11] Amen.
[7:12] Amen.
[7:12] To see, to comprehend, to understand.
[7:16] And when soon as it happened, the
[7:19] apostolic faith poured into our hearts
[7:23] to quicken us to us in this age that we
[7:26] are part of that life.
[7:28] Amen.
[7:28] Part of that light, part of that word.
[7:31] So you mean it must be quickened now.
[7:33] See, and and and that we were sent here
[7:37] to confirm that part of the word to live
[7:40] in this age. We're here for that
[7:43] purpose. See, now watch. God has nobody
[7:48] else to use in this end time other than
[7:52] those that are predestinated to be here.
[7:54] Amen.
[7:55] He hasn't got He can't use nobody else
[7:56] cuz he had already committed himself.
[7:59] He's committed himself to you. He's
[8:02] given his message to you.
[8:04] There's nobody else to use here. That's
[8:05] his word. See? So therefore, um,
[8:08] hallelujah.
[8:09] We are his thoughts. We know before he
[8:12] was before he formed himself into the
[8:15] word uh uh because a theophony word body
[8:19] he was just attributes thoughts.
[8:21] Amen.
[8:22] Thoughts is desire.
[8:24] Is that right?
[8:25] Then in his desires he desired to have
[8:27] fellowship
[8:28] with you and me.
[8:30] Amen. That was his desire to have
[8:32] fellowship. and and his desire was that
[8:34] he himself would form himself down to
[8:38] the word, the logos, the spirit that
[8:40] moved across the great earth that was
[8:43] void in darkness.
[8:45] And then coming on down, he would form
[8:47] himself into flesh called Jesus Christ.
[8:50] See amen now.
[8:51] But in the beginning when he spoke the
[8:53] first word, that was the word
[8:55] that was in the beginning. In the
[8:57] beginning, in the beginning, God. See?
[8:59] So therefore his thoughts they are are
[9:02] because eternal immortal
[9:05] then if his thoughts are immortal
[9:07] eternal we are part of his thoughts we
[9:10] are eternal we are because immortal
[9:13] amen.
[9:14] Amen.
[9:14] Praise the Lord.
[9:16] See we was there with him then when in
[9:19] the beginning.
[9:20] Amen.
[9:20] Before there was a beginning. And as a
[9:22] matter of fact, we was there. Then while
[9:24] he was just there, God, his thoughts,
[9:28] desires came into his mind uh his
[9:32] people.
[9:33] Then he be in his thought began to put
[9:35] him into a book of life, the lamb's book
[9:38] of life.
[9:39] That was all life in his mind.
[9:42] Then when he spoke that life, it went
[9:44] into the word, the logos. And then all
[9:47] of that life that would be expressed
[9:50] here was in that word the logos.
[9:52] And all that word had to do was to lay
[9:55] out a portion here, here, and here,
[9:57] right? Each age, they all come from that
[9:59] one logos.
[10:01] Paul, that one word.
[10:03] There's an attribute in your heart, a
[10:04] seed. Amen.
[10:06] Praise the Lord. See, then the book of
[10:09] life came into view in his mind. He saw
[10:12] the whole thing. God, he saw the whole
[10:14] picture. He saw Jesus Christ walking the
[10:18] earth, born in the manger and so forth,
[10:20] walking the earth. He saw Jesus Christ
[10:22] die on the cross
[10:23] before he even spoke.
[10:25] That's right.
[10:25] He saw Christ die.
[10:27] Amen.
[10:27] He saw his people each age washed in his
[10:31] blood.
[10:33] He saw his people redeemed.
[10:36] He saw us call whatever we were doing in
[10:38] sin one day.
[10:40] Whatever it was, he saw us
[10:42] when he called the first time. Yes.
[10:45] He saw us sanctified,
[10:47] justified.
[10:49] Holy Ghost burning out every desire of
[10:51] the world.
[10:53] Amen. And he saw us glorified
[10:57] all in his mind. Before he did anything,
[10:59] he saw that picture.
[11:00] Amen.
[11:01] Amen. Praise the Lord. Then uh these are
[11:06] the thoughts of the logos. You come into
[11:08] the word.
[11:10] Now the word got to express it out here.
[11:11] You and I. Amen. See? Then then that
[11:15] then that it was in God's mind that we
[11:18] should live in this worst of all ages,
[11:22] this age here. We should have to live
[11:24] here.
[11:25] And we should have to live in this city
[11:27] here in New York City.
[11:28] Amen.
[11:29] We are his family, his sons and
[11:32] daughters living in this filthy place.
[11:35] And his grace is with you.
[11:37] Amen.
[11:37] Because he put you here. You could have
[11:39] been born in Arizona somewhere, anywhere
[11:41] in this world, but you had to be here at
[11:43] this time.
[11:44] See, now he has nobody else to do
[11:47] nothing here for him but his sons and
[11:50] daughters because Isaiah 9:6 says the
[11:53] government is upon his shoulders.
[11:56] See, and the shoulders is his earthly
[11:58] strength.
[12:00] Is that right?
[12:01] That his earthly strength is his body.
[12:04] See? And God's earth is his body is his
[12:06] words. The logos made flesh in his body
[12:10] here on earth. See now then bring it to
[12:14] pass. Then God had to use a physical
[12:17] body to pour the word into and anoint
[12:20] that body to bring to pass the light for
[12:23] this age which is life. It's like God
[12:27] dwelling place was in the heavens and
[12:30] the hour to come he stretched his tent
[12:33] down to the earth.
[12:34] Amen.
[12:35] He stretched his dwelling place. His
[12:37] tent a pavilion
[12:38] tabernacle stretched it down here to the
[12:41] earth. And in that tent is perfection,
[12:44] love,
[12:46] holiness,
[12:47] understanding.
[12:48] Oh yeah.
[12:49] Are you following me? Spoken word. It's
[12:51] all in there.
[12:53] And and when he stretches down with the
[12:55] fullness is here on the earth. Now
[12:57] there's God walking in there. That's his
[12:59] dwelling place there. His people, his
[13:01] earthly strength here, his body. See?
[13:03] Now, so therefore, um we finding that
[13:08] this word is a lamb. The nature of it is
[13:12] a lamb. See, lamblike, meek, and humble.
[13:17] And then when he sends his spirit upon
[13:19] it is love. And then this love meets
[13:23] this humble nature, this lamb, that's
[13:26] his people. See? So what is it? God in
[13:29] the last days anointing his body with
[13:32] love, the dove. See, now we know like we
[13:36] said first it was a spirit. See, and
[13:39] that was thoughts, attributes,
[13:42] the great turn on. Then he fall himself
[13:45] into a theophony. See now uh this
[13:49] theophony Abraham met him mazesc
[13:53] God and Morphe chain yourself into that.
[13:55] See Abraham met him after the battle.
[13:59] Amen. You got to have the battle first.
[14:01] Abraham who was separated and called out
[14:04] Lot who who was his brother who had
[14:07] already made up his own mind that he
[14:09] couldn't overcome went back into the
[14:11] world. Abraham come down with servants
[14:15] of his house and freed Lot and he had
[14:19] tremendous battle when after the battle
[14:21] Melzdc gave of himself. When the
[14:24] battle's over,
[14:26] we partake of Melzdc's being
[14:29] when the battle's over.
[14:30] We shall wear a crown.
[14:32] Amen.
[14:33] It's a battle, friends.
[14:35] this same uh theophony. Moses had seen
[14:38] the burning bush and Moses wanted to see
[14:42] God. We want to see him. We want to see
[14:44] his face.
[14:44] Amen.
[14:45] And and he took Moses up in the mouth
[14:47] and the glory of God covered Moses.
[14:50] Amen.
[14:50] And then God took his hand away from
[14:52] Moses' eye and let him see his back. It
[14:55] was the back of a man, a Theophony.
[14:57] A man.
[14:58] This man is a person. And this person
[15:01] was the word and knew all things.
[15:04] Amen. Amen.
[15:04] But then it it come into flesh Jesus
[15:06] Christ. It then it was the express image
[15:11] of God
[15:12] for the word is God
[15:14] in the beginning was the word and put
[15:15] that word into flesh called Jesus Christ
[15:18] and there he expressed God. Now we
[15:21] couldn't do that. See though we were
[15:22] because of the attribute we had to
[15:24] bypass that mchzdic type worried body
[15:28] and come here in the flesh
[15:30] and be tempted and be tested
[15:33] and to be a light to be to produce life
[15:38] in the age that we're living in that we
[15:40] are to confirm his word at the is of God
[15:43] that we come from God and we go back to
[15:45] God
[15:46] and then though we was not all the word
[15:49] cuz we bypassed that word body where you
[15:51] know all things. He in the last days
[15:55] said he would reveal all the word
[15:57] to the sons of God.
[15:59] Amen.
[15:59] That they might know his will
[16:02] that he might pour out all of this
[16:04] apostolic faith into us.
[16:06] For the the mysteries are to be revealed
[16:09] to the sons of God
[16:11] in the last days that they might know
[16:13] their God,
[16:15] that they might do mighty exploits.
[16:17] For they know who God is.
[16:19] Amen.
[16:19] They'll know God. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[16:22] So Jesus Christ was the word before he
[16:26] was flesh. Then in the flesh he died and
[16:29] turned back into that theophony and went
[16:32] down and preached to souls in prison
[16:34] down there. That right? Then he also
[16:36] went knocked on the door of paradise.
[16:39] Amen. There was Abraham and Jacob and
[16:43] Isaac and Isaiah and Enoch and Noah. All
[16:46] of them were in there waiting. They had
[16:48] offered the sacrifice. Job had told him
[16:51] there no doubt that he he stood firm.
[16:54] Though he was tried, though he was
[16:56] tested, he knew in his flesh he would
[16:58] see God.
[16:59] And there was God down there in
[17:01] theophony body saying, "Come on up. I
[17:04] got the keys now to death and hell."
[17:06] Amen. No, he has the keys of death and
[17:08] hell. And he gave the keys of this
[17:10] kingdom to Peter.
[17:11] Amen.
[17:12] But he got the other keys. Can no man
[17:13] put you in hell?
[17:14] That's right. Can't no man put you in
[17:16] heaven
[17:17] with his doctrine.
[17:18] Amen.
[17:19] For he got the way right here. It's laid
[17:21] out here.
[17:22] Amen. And he told me, "Let's go on up.
[17:25] Let you walk around Jerusalem a little
[17:26] bit."
[17:27] Amen. And the council appeared to those
[17:29] there, the bride. Amen. And then going
[17:31] on up. So therefore, we know that that
[17:33] happened. See, but what God did instead
[17:37] of put us in this word body first. See,
[17:41] he let us come here to be tested.
[17:43] Yeah. first. See, that's his plan. And
[17:47] this seed attribute word in us is
[17:50] quickened, made alive, then his body is
[17:53] subject to his word spirit.
[17:55] Yeah.
[17:56] Romans 8:11. Amen.
[17:57] If the spirit of Christ of Christ dwell
[17:59] in you, the spirit that raised up Jesus
[18:02] Christ from there shall quicken your
[18:03] mortal bodies.
[18:04] Amen.
[18:05] And then we then you want to know, do I
[18:06] have the Holy Ghost? Well, it'll be
[18:08] subject to every word.
[18:09] Amen.
[18:10] Found me now. Amen.
[18:11] And so therefore then in this flesh
[18:14] body, we didn't become the word first.
[18:17] We bypassed that. But now we are to be
[18:19] conformed to the image of the word.
[18:22] Amen.
[18:22] Through this partaking of the word and
[18:25] eating the word of God. Amen. So then we
[18:28] are to be formed unto his image. See,
[18:31] now we become the word by faith in his
[18:35] word as we take on the word of God. See,
[18:38] and the word now, the message is turning
[18:41] the seed word into a golden brown. And
[18:45] many don't understand the power of the
[18:46] word. Therefore, second Timothy 4, they
[18:49] deny the power of the word. That's it.
[18:51] They don't understand it. That's the
[18:52] Pentecostal group.
[18:54] They don't they don't know what you're
[18:56] doing now.
[18:57] They don't they don't feel the Holy
[18:58] Spirit. Glory to God. See, therefore
[19:00] they deny the power of the word that
[19:04] made all the worlds
[19:06] that could create and paralyze this
[19:08] world right here.
[19:09] They deny that power that's in this
[19:11] word. When in the beginning, it was the
[19:12] word.
[19:14] And that's the word that's pouring into
[19:16] this bride now.
[19:18] Cuz when the dynamics come, he can only
[19:20] work by that word.
[19:22] Amen. So if you are receiving that you
[19:24] will be in the resurrection
[19:27] that you go in the rapture that you go
[19:29] to the wedding supper when the dynamics
[19:31] fall it'll bring it to pass.
[19:33] Amen.
[19:33] Amen.
[19:34] But receive it first.
[19:36] Cuz that's the power that the fire can
[19:38] find that gunpowder
[19:40] which is the word of God.
[19:41] Amen.
[19:41] Amen.
[19:42] Amen.
[19:43] So we see then that um we are eagles
[19:46] holding on to the word of God. See, and
[19:49] then if you know that somehow you want
[19:52] to leave this world, you don't care
[19:54] nothing about the things here.
[19:56] You have heard from God.
[19:59] You have heard from your theophony over
[20:01] there.
[20:01] Amen.
[20:02] From your word body. Therefore, you are
[20:05] groaning. You're in birth pains.
[20:07] You want to get there.
[20:08] Is that right?
[20:10] Romans 8 says it because we are groaning
[20:11] to get there. The sons of God, the whole
[20:14] cre the whole creation is groaning and
[20:16] moaning, waiting for the manifestation
[20:18] of the sons of God. See, now we know
[20:21] that all this was made possible when the
[20:24] seven seals open up and reveal this to
[20:26] us, the word image. And therefore, now
[20:29] watch. See, we are his earthly strength.
[20:33] See, we're trying to get the people to
[20:35] see. Some people are scared. They come
[20:39] in here and they serve God because
[20:40] they're afraid maybe because they have
[20:41] to go to hell. That ain't the idea.
[20:44] I'm trying to show you this morning. See
[20:46] that we are absolutely part of God.
[20:49] Amen.
[20:50] You follow me now. That's all I'm trying
[20:52] to show you this morning. See,
[20:53] see our lives are bound. See, in his
[20:58] bundle of life.
[20:59] That's scripture, you know.
[21:01] Yes, it is. See, which is the fountain
[21:02] of life. If you don't believe me, turn
[21:04] over. Second uh 1 Samuel 25. the 28th
[21:09] verse,
[21:11] we see uh
[21:13] maybe a little question marks running
[21:16] across the audience this morning. 1
[21:18] Samuel um 25:28.
[21:21] This is Abigail,
[21:24] uh precious sister in the Lord,
[21:28] great prophet, a preacher here, a
[21:29] brother, and a man was after him, Saul.
[21:34] Now, some preachers today wouldn't
[21:36] listen to Abigail, but this was a humble
[21:38] brother.
[21:39] Amen.
[21:39] Amen.
[21:41] So, the spirit of the Lord fell upon
[21:43] Abigail. See, and she said, "I pray
[21:47] thee, forgive the trespass of thine
[21:49] handmmaid, for the Lord will certainly
[21:51] make my Lord a sure house, because my
[21:53] Lord fightth the battles of the Lord,
[21:55] and evil hath not been found in thee all
[21:58] thy ways days. Yet a man is risen to
[22:02] pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, but
[22:06] the soul of my Lord shall be bound in
[22:09] the bundle of life with the Lord thy
[22:11] God. And the souls of thine enemy uh
[22:14] them shall he sling out as out of the
[22:16] middle of a sling. So we see then that
[22:19] our souls
[22:21] is this attribute, you follow me, his
[22:23] thought that is in that logos word,
[22:27] that logos word is a bundle of life.
[22:30] Amen.
[22:30] Is a fountain of life
[22:32] and your soul is bound in there.
[22:36] And so therefore, God has so bound
[22:39] himself in his people, his people in him
[22:42] that they are one.
[22:44] There's no way to get out. He has tithed
[22:47] not for eternity.
[22:49] See, praise the Lord. See now uh uh
[22:52] because in the natural like uh uh um
[22:55] Jacob and Benjamin, you know the story
[22:56] down in Genesis down there when they
[22:58] went down to Joseph and he was trying to
[23:00] get him come because to come back down
[23:02] and so forth and he wanted to send down
[23:04] Benjamin, Jacob would have died because
[23:07] his soul was bound up in Benjamin's
[23:08] soul. His life was in there. See, that's
[23:11] only natural. Well, how much more if God
[23:14] has bound our souls in this word locals,
[23:19] this bundle of life?
[23:21] There's no way to get out.
[23:22] Oh,
[23:23] I hope you see that, friends. See,
[23:26] and so therefore, you see your calling.
[23:28] He said, "Oh, because in Colossians,
[23:30] Christ who is our life when he appears,
[23:32] see, we shall appear with him in glory."
[23:36] That's it.
[23:36] Amen.
[23:37] Are you following me, friends?
[23:39] God.
[23:39] Well, he has appeared. Well, how do you
[23:42] know? He's not a blade.
[23:45] He I mean he's I mean he's not a tassel.
[23:47] I hope you see it.
[23:49] He's not a shark.
[23:50] He's a corner wheat.
[23:52] Well, Christ has appeared.
[23:55] And because we are so our souls are
[23:58] bound in the bundle of life.
[24:00] In this fountain of life, we are right
[24:02] this morning appearing with him in
[24:05] glory.
[24:06] For this seed is one glory of the Lord.
[24:09] The shuck is another. But this is the
[24:12] same kind of body he has.
[24:14] Amen. This is the same word that he's
[24:18] pouring into you
[24:19] that's pointing back to the apostolic
[24:21] one.
[24:22] You follow me, friends?
[24:23] And and you're going to have the same
[24:25] body.
[24:26] Amen. See, and you're going to do the
[24:27] same signs. You're going to have the
[24:29] same spoken word for his voice is coming
[24:33] down into the bride.
[24:34] Amen.
[24:35] And when she just comes like that, it's
[24:37] just him. It's just it's the head with
[24:39] the shoulders, the earthly strength
[24:41] coming together.
[24:42] Amen.
[24:44] Listen, God can do nothing without you.
[24:47] Amen.
[24:48] So release your son and stop being
[24:50] scared.
[24:51] Went through the wrong. No, he is with
[24:54] you.
[24:55] He has bound your soul.
[24:58] Stop being afraid every day to take a
[25:00] step.
[25:01] God says, "Walk by faith. I'm with you.
[25:05] I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[25:07] you, but just keep walking. You know I
[25:10] called you. You know I washed you in my
[25:13] blood. What's wrong with you? Release
[25:15] yourself and walk on with God.
[25:18] Never mind yesterday.
[25:19] Don't look back in the mud like the
[25:21] Louis there.
[25:22] Amen. Look on with God cuz God has
[25:25] brought this is a glory of God sitting
[25:27] here.
[25:28] The outsiders eyes is blinded to it.
[25:31] They don't see the glory of God. God
[25:33] does
[25:34] so much so that he's protecting it.
[25:36] He's nourishing it. He's bringing along.
[25:39] He's ripening it and maturing it.
[25:41] Praise be to God. Amen.
[25:44] Praise God.
[25:46] Amen.
[25:47] Wonderful. Wonderful.
[25:48] It's going on now. He not a sher.
[25:51] Praise God.
[25:52] You believe that, friends?
[25:54] Believe us that.
[25:56] Amen.
[25:57] We are his body,
[26:00] his earthly strength. Amen.
[26:02] Amen. Notice now
[26:04] Christ has so bound us eternally with
[26:06] him.
[26:07] Now look, no if a man is speaking about
[26:10] he wouldn't say because my hand is near
[26:12] or far.
[26:14] My hand is part of me.
[26:16] That's right.
[26:16] Is that right? Well, he not way up
[26:18] there. He's right here.
[26:20] His body here. You on the earth. He's
[26:22] not near or far. It's him
[26:25] himself.
[26:26] Amen. Praise God.
[26:28] You see it, friends.
[26:29] Amen.
[26:29] Amen. See,
[26:31] it cannot be otherwise. For we are his
[26:33] body.
[26:34] People are scared. Will I make it?
[26:37] Will I just get there?
[26:38] See me now. No.
[26:40] Your soul like Abigail like she told
[26:42] David. See me now. God saw you before
[26:45] the foundation world David and he found
[26:48] no evil in you.
[26:50] Now we know all the mistakes he made.
[26:53] But he want to see it that believe that
[26:55] word.
[26:56] Amen. No matter how many Pentecostal
[26:58] Sauls ran after him.
[27:00] You follow me now? That was anointed
[27:02] with an evil spirit from the Lord.
[27:04] So don't curse that.
[27:06] Let because Shimai alone. Let him kick
[27:07] dirt up on you.
[27:08] Amen.
[27:08] God has bid him to do it.
[27:10] For God is uses Shimai and Saul to mold
[27:13] you. Amen.
[27:14] To shape you
[27:15] into the sons of and daughter of the
[27:17] living God.
[27:18] All things work together for good to
[27:21] them that love God.
[27:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. Our souls are
[27:25] bound. Bound. Paul said he was bound in
[27:29] the spirit to go to Jerusalem.
[27:31] Is that right?
[27:32] Paul always desire everything was to
[27:35] please God. When God can get a group
[27:37] like that here down here,
[27:38] that who really believes that
[27:40] brother, you watch those dynamics pour
[27:42] down through there.
[27:44] Yes sir. Is grafted in
[27:47] wild olive branch grafted in
[27:49] one, not two, one.
[27:51] Amen. See,
[27:53] we had to appear as corns of wheat to
[27:56] live out what he predestinated for this
[27:59] age here. We are bone of his bone.
[28:01] Hallelujah.
[28:02] Amen. Flesh of his flesh. Is that right?
[28:05] Body of his body.
[28:07] Just thinking about uh what's his name
[28:08] over there? Ezekiel. I thought I'd just
[28:10] read that there.
[28:11] Ezekiel 37 just to put some more upon
[28:14] it.
[28:15] Amen. Praise the Lord. Ezekiel 37:4.
[28:19] Again, he said unto me, "Prophesy upon
[28:21] these bones, and say unto them, oh ye
[28:23] dry bones." Now, he just said, "We are
[28:25] bone of his bone, didn't he?"
[28:26] Amen.
[28:27] Flesh of his flesh. Is that right? Amen.
[28:30] And say unto them, "Oh ye dry bones,
[28:31] hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayeth
[28:34] the Lord God unto these bones, behold, I
[28:36] will cause breath to enter into you, and
[28:38] ye shall live. And I will lace a new
[28:41] upon you, and will bring flesh upon you,
[28:43] and cover you with skin, and put breath
[28:46] in you, and you shall live. and ye shall
[28:48] know that I am the Lord.
[28:51] So I prophesied and I was commanded and
[28:54] as I prophesied there was a noise and
[28:57] behold a shaking and the bones come
[28:59] together bone to his bones and when I
[29:02] beheld lo the senior in the flesh came
[29:04] upon him and the skin covered them and
[29:07] there was no breath in them therefore it
[29:10] couldn't happen to this day friends this
[29:11] is Israel because we understand that but
[29:13] hi away is the bride a prophet had to
[29:17] come and prophesy
[29:19] to these bones here. His bone laying
[29:21] down here on the earth here. Can these
[29:23] bones live? And this word over here in
[29:25] the thing is where it says noise, it
[29:28] says thundering.
[29:29] Amen.
[29:30] A thundering or shaking. And it had to
[29:31] be go. It's going on right now. And God
[29:34] is doing that. But then notice now,
[29:36] first he had to speak the word first.
[29:38] The mechanics.
[29:40] Is that right?
[29:41] The mechanics had to add the skin on.
[29:44] Had to put it on and make it, you know,
[29:46] put everything back in place. Then can
[29:48] the bones live?
[29:50] prophesy. He did. He said that the
[29:53] dynamics, Amen, shall come into you
[29:56] and this bride shall stand up
[29:58] shall be a mighty great exceeding army
[30:01] and she's going to march. She going to
[30:02] move out one day. Right now, she's
[30:04] receiving strength through the word of
[30:06] God
[30:07] to stand up one day and move out for the
[30:09] Lord. Amen.
[30:10] Amen.
[30:11] So, we see that the dynamics will come
[30:13] to make this body live. See only a
[30:16] prophet could bring the word to make
[30:19] this come to pass. So then we see then
[30:21] that it is uh that it is only through
[30:26] resurrection power that this can come.
[30:30] See me now watch.
[30:34] I don't want to be too long with you.
[30:35] See I want to break through to know who
[30:37] you are. The enemy trying to tell you
[30:40] because you that's not so but it is so.
[30:42] See
[30:43] it's uh now this resurrection power
[30:46] watch lived in the first church. See
[30:50] now I'm speaking about the resurrection
[30:53] power that is to be restored back now
[30:56] not the gift. See that's part of it. See
[30:59] amen now but the full resurrection power
[31:01] that was the word itself in maturity. If
[31:04] you were here Wednesday night you heard
[31:06] him say the the Holy Ghost is powerful
[31:08] service to mature Christians. Finally
[31:11] out they have been raised up adopted and
[31:13] move on up to age and ready to go out
[31:17] for because matured right
[31:19] then now for our type or we use Abraham
[31:23] now Abraham's natural life had to come
[31:26] from God's fountain of life is that
[31:28] right
[31:29] cuz he is the author of natural and
[31:31] spiritual life
[31:32] so therefore here was Abraham 75 years
[31:36] old starting out his wife Sarah 65
[31:40] is that right starting out we know the
[31:43] story Genesis 12 as he come along
[31:45] justification sanctification because
[31:48] from Lot and so forth and to move right
[31:50] on down is still holding on to this
[31:52] promise see and just like Pentecost 1906
[31:57] then in Genesis 17 God appeared to him
[32:01] and told him that I am almighty God
[32:04] walk thou before me and be thou perfect
[32:07] amen
[32:08] now that word almighty God means El
[32:10] Shadai
[32:11] and which means the strengthener to give
[32:14] strength the breast because in the
[32:15] Hebrew then God was telling Abraham who
[32:19] was 99 see and Sarah who was 89 at that
[32:24] time that now you held on to the word
[32:27] now I'm going to pour strength in you
[32:29] nurse from my breast
[32:32] and grow up and be strong and be
[32:34] fruitful and in that God purges what's
[32:37] the same thing that happened here to the
[32:39] Pentecost apostle church here 1946
[32:42] almighty God appeared to his prophet
[32:45] is that right
[32:46] to go out with this gift amen the first
[32:49] pull
[32:49] and and and nurse those Pentecostal
[32:52] babies on the word
[32:54] amen give them the milk word first with
[32:56] a gift nurse them along bring them up to
[32:59] the second pool and then give them the
[33:02] meat
[33:03] see amen now but the thing was can they
[33:05] nurse
[33:07] and they couldn't nurse
[33:09] from El Shadai,
[33:10] the breasted one.
[33:12] Amen.
[33:12] Amen.
[33:13] Don't get scared now. See,
[33:15] praise the Lord.
[33:16] Praise the Lord. See,
[33:18] but notice the things that happened. It
[33:20] was at that time when uh he uh was uh uh
[33:23] a circumcision and he was told to walk
[33:26] before the Lord and be perfect. Never
[33:28] told him that back in justification,
[33:30] sanctification, only when he had the
[33:32] type of the Holy Ghost said, "Now walk
[33:35] before me. Now be perfect up now in your
[33:39] perfect faith. You follow me now? And
[33:41] then from that time then shortly Abraham
[33:45] his name was changed. Then Sarah's name
[33:47] was changed and so forth. And then right
[33:50] after that God appeared in human skin.
[33:52] Amen.
[33:53] And said surely I'm going to visit you
[33:55] at the time of life. Well, do you know
[33:57] all those things happened within one
[33:58] year.
[33:59] That's right.
[34:00] Within one year cuz Abraham was 100
[34:02] years old when the baby was born. See,
[34:05] now watch. In Abraham's body was his
[34:10] natural seed. Is that right?
[34:12] But that seed was dead.
[34:14] Amen.
[34:14] You see what I mean? Now
[34:15] the seed in him was dead. Yet he had the
[34:18] type of the baptism, circumcision.
[34:21] Is that right? He was sanctified. He was
[34:23] justified.
[34:24] And he had faith. For he had walked all
[34:27] those years with faith. About 24 years
[34:29] with faith. But yet that seed was dead
[34:32] inside. Yes.
[34:34] The seed to have to to restore back to
[34:36] that full young natural life.
[34:38] I hope you get this now.
[34:40] Amen. Now,
[34:41] though he had faith,
[34:43] though he had walked and staying not,
[34:45] though his flesh was circumcised, type
[34:48] of the Holy Ghost,
[34:49] still the seed
[34:51] was dead.
[34:51] Amen.
[34:52] In his body.
[34:53] Amen.
[34:54] I'm trying to show you. Amen.
[34:55] So therefore, the Pentecostal church,
[34:57] the body of Christ, the seed inside, the
[35:01] prophet told you way back in the shock
[35:03] was a little tiny bulb. Amen.
[35:04] Just lay in there. Can't do anything
[35:06] yet. And though it had gifts, though it
[35:09] went in the spirit, done all kind of
[35:11] things. See, but the seed was in there.
[35:13] Seed need something else now.
[35:14] Amen.
[35:15] It needed something to strengthen it.
[35:17] Amen. Amen.
[35:18] So Abraham then God turned his body back
[35:23] by resurrection power.
[35:26] Amen.
[35:27] Resurrected his old natural body back to
[35:30] a young life.
[35:32] The bloodstream begin to move again.
[35:35] Amen.
[35:35] You follow me now? See then this bride
[35:39] was she could only though she prophesied
[35:42] though she spake in tongues though she
[35:44] screamed and shouted and all these
[35:45] things that little tiny bulb seed could
[35:49] not grow yet until resurrection
[35:52] power of the word the son of man himself
[35:56] had to come and anoint that seed
[35:59] amen
[36:00] I hope you see that friend
[36:01] and while and that's going on right now
[36:04] and while that seed now and has taken on
[36:07] life is anointed right through right
[36:09] now. See, it's the same power that was
[36:13] here on the day of Pentecost that walked
[36:14] that earth. The power of this word here
[36:17] is now pouring down into that seed. All
[36:20] right. Jesus Christ, he walked the earth
[36:22] healing and so forth, doing good. And
[36:24] there he was. And there was a woman. She
[36:26] had a blood issue for 12 years. That
[36:29] right? But she had an attribute inside.
[36:32] And that attribute said if I can only
[36:34] touch the hem of his garment.
[36:37] Is that right? Something inside her was
[36:39] leading her to touch the hem of that
[36:41] garment.
[36:42] So uh because she had a blood issue, she
[36:44] couldn't do anything because her body
[36:46] was weak. See? So by faith she touched
[36:49] the hymn of the garment and immediately
[36:52] virtue went out and her body was
[36:54] strengthened. All right. Today here we
[36:56] have the Leosian church and here uh so
[37:01] to speak a blood issue. Is that right?
[37:03] In the church couldn't bring nothing.
[37:05] See amen now. And yet uh they saw Jesus
[37:08] Christ since 46 the hymn of his garment
[37:11] the word his gifts walking all over the
[37:13] earth seven times around.
[37:15] Amen. And still nothing happened yet.
[37:17] But then in 1963 that word became flesh
[37:22] and some predestinated
[37:24] Amen. Women saw by faith. They knew they
[37:28] could only touch the hymn of that word.
[37:30] Amen.
[37:31] Just touch it. Then their faith could
[37:34] touch that. Then the first thing
[37:36] happened when you touch the hymn of his
[37:38] garment, virtue
[37:40] was added to faith.
[37:41] Amen.
[37:42] Is that right?
[37:42] Amen.
[37:43] The first thing to pour through is his
[37:45] virtue going into your body
[37:47] to strengthen you, to make you whole.
[37:49] Then virtue come pouring into you. Then
[37:52] that resurrection power of the word, the
[37:56] seed word begin to come and then that
[37:58] begin to take on knowledge and patience
[38:01] and temperance and begin to add. And
[38:03] while all time is adding now, many they
[38:05] don't know what's going on. They're
[38:06] watching and looking and waiting and
[38:07] seeing. But it's going on right now.
[38:09] See?
[38:10] So therefore, our bodies are being
[38:13] changed right now, friends. It's going
[38:15] on spiritually speaking now. Of course,
[38:17] spiritually speaking. See, because our
[38:19] natural bodies have to be changed to
[38:22] receive Isaac in the air, Jesus Christ,
[38:24] of course. See, so therefore, now
[38:28] we look at the spiritual thing here.
[38:30] There it was just about this hour there.
[38:33] There was Abraham in one year all of
[38:35] these things happened.
[38:37] And now we see then that this bundle of
[38:40] life appeared again, the fountain of
[38:43] life. And he had some souls that was
[38:45] bound up in that word.
[38:48] you and I here. Amen.
[38:50] And now uh we know that no matter how
[38:53] many spiritual charges out here, see
[38:57] and there's 200 million million see now
[39:01] they're out here. But yet he had a type
[39:05] a church. He that's in the church here
[39:07] that would be made whole
[39:09] and touch the hem of the garment
[39:12] and she's whole now.
[39:14] And her body is changing to a golden
[39:16] brown. It's all spiritual. Seemen.
[39:18] Amen. See. And therefore Jesus said,
[39:21] "Who touched me?" The bride says, "I
[39:23] touched you."
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] And but she's but this bride is still
[39:27] holding
[39:28] onto that garment.
[39:30] Just like Jacob.
[39:31] Amen. on. He said, "Until you bless me."
[39:35] Amen. Are you holding on, friends?
[39:37] Well, you hold on until he blessed you.
[39:40] Till he changed your name.
[39:42] Your name is changed to Miss Jesus
[39:44] Christ.
[39:45] Amen. Praise the Lord. See, and so
[39:47] therefore, virtue immediately went out.
[39:50] Now, we know that there are 200,000,000
[39:55] spiritual charges here. And I was
[39:57] reading the other day something here and
[39:59] it just struck me. So, I thought I'd
[40:01] just pass it on to you.
[40:04] Um, page 28, he's speaking about this
[40:07] loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit.
[40:10] Now, to for you to understand, he said
[40:12] that the feast of the trumpets that he
[40:14] wasn't going to preach it because it
[40:15] didn't pertain to us here because it
[40:17] pertained to the the Jews. But I notice
[40:20] in that you what he did in there, he
[40:23] went back and told us the revelation of
[40:25] two trumpets. He gave us the revelation
[40:28] of the sixth trumpet and told exactly
[40:31] when it started. See, and gave us the
[40:33] revelation of the fifth trumpet. And
[40:35] that started way back cuz the revelation
[40:37] of the fifth trumpet had a king of
[40:39] Apolon and come out of hell. That was
[40:41] the popes. It took it way back. And the
[40:44] revelation of the sixth trumpet was at
[40:46] 200,000,000 spiritual charges.
[40:49] Watch listen was the pagan spirits that
[40:54] was bound by Rome's uh traditions of
[40:59] Christianity.
[41:00] Now see a a Rome would have loosed upon
[41:04] the world this pagan spirit but when the
[41:06] popes came on the scene it bound that up
[41:09] and then it bound up the church and the
[41:11] pagan spirit because it had its own
[41:13] doctrine.
[41:14] You follow me now? So those 200,000,000
[41:17] pagan demons was bound and while the
[41:20] pope just ruled the earth there. See?
[41:22] All right. 1933 it was time for those
[41:26] pagan spirits to be loosed. And certain
[41:29] dictators had to serve one hour with the
[41:32] beast. Certain dictators, Hitler,
[41:35] Mussolina, Stalin and so forth. And then
[41:37] those pagan spirits, the ones that
[41:40] burned those Jews, did all kind of
[41:43] things to those Jews. over these
[41:45] 200,000,000
[41:47] spiritual charges that got up on those
[41:49] Germans and the ties and so forth and
[41:50] did all of those things.
[41:52] So therefore, God's prophet, he was
[41:53] showing us that the sixth trumpet was
[41:56] loosed around about 1933 there. Are you
[41:58] following me now?
[41:59] Amen.
[41:59] So therefore, he says between the sixth
[42:01] trumpet and the seventh trumpet, Elijah
[42:04] is the pair and so is Moses and Elijah.
[42:06] Now on a book called ashamed, he calls
[42:09] the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal
[42:11] the coming of the Lord. So where are you
[42:14] at right now? Are you following me? So
[42:16] now these supernatural charges, brother
[42:19] Bram said that they are to be loosed on
[42:22] the bride.
[42:23] Mhm.
[42:24] But they won't take her. See, it's just
[42:26] to because come against her
[42:28] because see these charges have a certain
[42:30] nature.
[42:32] And only way you can know that a person
[42:33] got a charge up on them. See
[42:37] is to find out their nature.
[42:40] And on page 29,
[42:43] it says here, notice what that group is
[42:46] ariding, making themselves ready to
[42:48] stomp out everything that won't that
[42:50] won't agree with them.
[42:51] Amen. Mhm.
[42:52] Now you can now you can pick up that
[42:54] spirit. There's a spirit a religious
[42:55] spirit. Now
[42:56] that because changed over in 63 when
[43:00] Pope Paul opened up that spirit come out
[43:02] and changed from pagan to ecclesiastical
[43:06] and before it could rise and stop
[43:09] everything the seals was open that the
[43:12] bride might know by the word what that
[43:14] is.
[43:16] Amen.
[43:16] You see God see how it's got to be time.
[43:18] The pope actually came in 63 in June. Is
[43:21] that right?
[43:22] Just look how close that was. Two or
[43:25] three months just before that. Amen.
[43:27] The seals was open that we might know he
[43:30] was coming.
[43:31] God is with his people because he has
[43:33] bound you
[43:34] your souls. Amen. In a bundle of life
[43:38] and can't no demon, nobody, no nothing
[43:42] deter you from the course that he's laid
[43:45] out here for you.
[43:46] Nothing can take you away, friend. I
[43:48] mean, you are bound. He's bound to it.
[43:51] He sees. He knows you're here.
[43:52] His love is with you. He's washing in
[43:55] his blood. He's sending his word. He's
[43:56] giving you everything that you need.
[43:58] This word here
[43:59] cuz you can only defeat the enemy by
[44:01] that word. That's all.
[44:02] Amen.
[44:03] Now he said even he said there because
[44:04] Jesus because he had his temptations
[44:06] there.
[44:06] Mhm.
[44:07] And he says uh Satan said because cast
[44:09] yourself down. Will you because will you
[44:12] tempt God? Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[44:13] thy God. Other words here going out
[44:16] across the country with big campaign so
[44:18] forth. Would you tempt God to go out
[44:20] there over to because Jeremy on the
[44:22] aisle over here I am be the message
[44:24] now God come down here tempting God. See
[44:27] cast yourself out. No sir waiting right
[44:29] with that word.
[44:30] Staying right there. I hope you see that
[44:31] friend.
[44:32] Just stay right with it. See amen now.
[44:34] It's going to it's going to be just the
[44:35] way he said. See now. So what happened
[44:37] here? That pagan spirit was loosed
[44:40] through these dictators and it it was
[44:43] all working in God's purpose. Now those
[44:46] spirits, the demon charges drove Israel
[44:50] back to Israel. I mean because drove
[44:52] these because Jews back to Israel. And
[44:54] therefore God allowed this um or
[44:58] ecclesiastical spirit to be loosed
[45:01] against the bride to drive her to the
[45:02] word.
[45:04] Amen.
[45:05] See now to drive her straight to the new
[45:07] Jerusalem, the word of God.
[45:09] Amen.
[45:10] Try these spirits by the word.
[45:12] You follow me now? So he allowed them to
[45:14] be loose against the bride, but he let
[45:16] her see their nature. For they come with
[45:20] a certain nature. See amen now. Now he
[45:22] said here, he said, "Now, now there she
[45:24] is. Now she's loose to call, watch these
[45:27] words here to call all these little
[45:30] loose ends." Now he's saying that these
[45:34] supernatural charges is loose to call
[45:38] loose ends around the bride. Now watch.
[45:42] He says, "Oh, well, it don't make any
[45:44] difference anyhow." A loose end.
[45:47] That's what Satan said to Eve.
[45:50] Don't make any different. It's all
[45:51] right. Surely, God's a good God. He
[45:54] loves us all. He doesn't. Brother
[45:56] Brandham says
[45:57] he's a God of justice.
[45:59] Did you pick up what I said?
[46:00] Amen.
[46:01] Here we are in the message. The demons,
[46:03] the charges are loose. And they have a
[46:05] certain nature, certain spirit to drive
[46:07] at at their brothers. Chop them down.
[46:09] Chop them down. chap with a certain
[46:11] doctrine. Are you following me, friends?
[46:14] And if you don't agree with what they
[46:15] say, they'll stomp you out.
[46:18] Are you following me?
[46:19] Amen.
[46:19] They will stomp out all that is called
[46:22] God. If they don't agree with what they
[46:25] say.
[46:25] Now, some people say, "Now, what are you
[46:27] talking about, Brother Coleman? I'm
[46:28] preaching the word of God."
[46:30] Some people think maybe you're talking
[46:31] about this or that. No, I am standing
[46:34] here, I'll show you why, and preaching
[46:36] the word to his bride here. For that's
[46:38] what he said.
[46:40] You follow me now? So now
[46:42] these loose ends like, "Oh, that's all
[46:44] right, Eve. You can live in the world
[46:46] and be worldly and have worldly clothes
[46:49] and all like it's here and live like
[46:50] it's here. You could do it. That's a
[46:52] loose end."
[46:52] That's right.
[46:53] All All you got to do is to go over here
[46:55] and there's going to be a great big
[46:56] thing. That's a loose end.
[46:58] No more ministers. That's a loose end.
[47:00] No more no more Holy Ghost. We in a
[47:03] loose end. All you got to do is just
[47:05] read the book. Loose end. Yes. Yes.
[47:07] Brother, you got to live this word of
[47:09] God. Got to do more than read it.
[47:11] You got to live it.
[47:13] You can read the whole book if you don't
[47:14] have love.
[47:16] If you don't love because your brother,
[47:18] are you following me now?
[47:20] If you ain't riding up and down trying
[47:21] to stomp out your brother, you see now
[47:24] what spirit is that? A spiritual charger
[47:27] up on a brother. Ride, ride, ride, ride.
[47:30] See, it's driving. The Holy Spirit is
[47:32] first of all peaceable,
[47:34] easy to be entreated,
[47:37] full of love,
[47:38] mercy, compassion,
[47:41] beareth all things,
[47:43] does not never born itself.
[47:45] It's not called to do a certain thing.
[47:47] It says humble.
[47:48] Thank you, Lord.
[47:49] You felt that's the Holy Spirit.
[47:51] But this other spirit, Matthew 24:24, up
[47:54] on these people driving, you got to do
[47:58] it this way. You got to do this way
[47:59] here. driving is is is a demon charger
[48:01] you
[48:03] I hope you understand this friend
[48:04] we here to this is God's house of
[48:06] correction and some will come here sit
[48:08] here looking just like the world and
[48:10] want to question you what are you
[48:12] talking about up there I'm talking about
[48:13] the word of God that's what I'm talking
[48:15] about there is God's sheep that are put
[48:17] here in New York City here and we are to
[48:19] preach the word to them and we because
[48:22] we are here loose and float through here
[48:25] we chop that thing into pieces and what
[48:28] are you insinuating about what are you
[48:29] talking I'm talking about that loose end
[48:31] flying through there.
[48:33] See, I got a beat on it. I'm cutting the
[48:35] thing down. Oh, we all believe. No, we
[48:37] don't neither.
[48:38] No, sir. There's only an elected group
[48:41] that has heard from their theophony.
[48:44] They come from God and they go back to
[48:45] God.
[48:46] They are bound in his word.
[48:49] They They are sweating tears.
[48:51] They're sighing and crying against these
[48:54] filthy loose ends.
[48:55] They're they're holding the fort.
[48:57] They're holding on. They know what the
[48:59] word God given the word to ser message
[49:01] and they're holding just what it said.
[49:03] It says ministers. It says the Holy
[49:04] Ghost. It says everything in there. Is
[49:07] that right? And they're holding right to
[49:08] it. And when they are loose and
[49:10] confronting charging through in the
[49:12] wrong spirit
[49:13] cuz the Bible says except you go forth
[49:16] forgiving and brotherly kind. You have
[49:17] the wrong spirit of this age.
[49:19] Therefore, if I have done something
[49:21] wrong of you, it doesn't wrong. The
[49:22] brother won't forgive you but want to
[49:23] stomp you out and swear you're wrong.
[49:26] What kind of spirit is that?
[49:28] Are you following me, friends?
[49:29] Amen.
[49:30] Hope you get it, brother. See?
[49:31] So therefore,
[49:33] these this ecclesiastical loose in
[49:36] spirit was loosed 200,000,000 of them to
[49:39] catch the bride somewhere. But they
[49:41] care. She's holding her for it.
[49:43] She met God. She was there. Amen.
[49:45] She was in his thoughts.
[49:46] Amen. And she's expressed here not that
[49:49] she will. She has stumbled off. He said,
[49:51] "You will be conformed to my image."
[49:54] Why? cuz you're already justified,
[49:57] already sanctified, already glorified
[49:59] and you will do it.
[50:00] But you just just stand here and show
[50:03] light. Then if you're showing light
[50:05] here, their deeds is done in darkness.
[50:08] You follow other words, if you think a
[50:10] person is wrong, bring it to the light.
[50:13] What that's done in dark is all around
[50:15] slipping behind, slipping over here,
[50:16] slipping over there, silly women, it
[50:18] picks them up and tells them all this
[50:19] garbage. See me now. And then that
[50:21] spirit, that demon charge is afraid to
[50:23] come to the light. the word.
[50:25] Here's the light. Bring it right here.
[50:27] If for say here, if we wrong here, come
[50:30] down to the light. Down where the do
[50:32] drops of mercy are.
[50:33] Amen.
[50:34] Let's sit on down in the back.
[50:36] Fellowship.
[50:37] Amen.
[50:38] Amen. Hug one another.
[50:40] Well, God bless you, brother. I'm wrong.
[50:41] Show it to me.
[50:43] No. Charging around the outskirts. See
[50:45] the men now picking up silly women
[50:47] who are led away by divers lust. What's
[50:50] over here? What's over there? See eyes
[50:52] buckwide and everything. things. See,
[50:53] they been looking for something else.
[50:54] You sure get it because he got it.
[50:57] She sure got it, too.
[50:58] And then what are they talking about
[51:00] down there? Not even know don't you fear
[51:02] God?
[51:03] You see me now? No. So, no fear of God
[51:05] at all. Just saying any old blasphemy
[51:07] because come out of their mouth. Speak
[51:09] against a deacon, the minister, anybody.
[51:10] They don't care. Brother s they don't
[51:12] say anything. Therefore, that spirit has
[51:14] been turned over already, a charger upon
[51:17] them. See, but if it's the Holy Spirit
[51:19] is peaceable,
[51:21] easy to be entreated. Oh yeah.
[51:23] Full of mercy,
[51:24] compassion. Well, God bless you,
[51:26] brother. I'm sure. Sorry. See, sister
[51:29] there praying one for the other. No,
[51:31] these spirits just moving around. That's
[51:33] right, sister. Praise the Lord. See,
[51:35] they don't they don't understand that
[51:36] they want to just talk evil against you
[51:38] all the time. I'm trying to show you
[51:40] friends. God is bringing up to a certain
[51:42] plane. See, don't be don't let that
[51:46] those demon charges upon people. I hope
[51:49] you understand what I'm talking about. I
[51:51] ain't talking against nobody. I'm
[51:53] preaching about this loose end. These
[51:54] loose ends. I'm trying to let you know
[51:56] that God has want you on this plane
[51:58] here. Don't camp down here with all that
[52:01] old talking foolishness down here. If
[52:03] you get up here, moving, quiet in the
[52:05] spirit, praying in the Holy Ghost,
[52:07] loving your brother, that's up here. Say
[52:09] now, knowing that soon something is
[52:11] fixing to happen. You see Apollo 11
[52:13] going up here. You follow me now? You
[52:15] know God's prophet said that they won't
[52:17] get there. What season are you in? Where
[52:19] you at? you know about all about because
[52:21] cancer and and what month it moves and
[52:24] all these things and the harvest and all
[52:25] you know these things it's been preached
[52:26] to you and you watching you wait you
[52:28] don't want to hear nothing like that
[52:29] there against nobody
[52:31] you get away from that kind of stuff
[52:32] there see now but they don't know you
[52:34] got to pray for them they don't know see
[52:36] but nevertheless if they don't know they
[52:38] got to be told the word yes sir you got
[52:40] to stand on the word of God amen see so
[52:43] now he says that um they're trying that
[52:46] they're writing to stomp out this
[52:49] message. You know why? No faith,
[52:52] no revelation. So therefore, since they
[52:55] they turn around, what should I preach?
[52:57] I don't know what what to say. Well, um
[53:00] maybe we should just read the books.
[53:02] Everybody just read just what it says
[53:04] here. No revelation. Now suppose you
[53:06] just read the books. You follow me now?
[53:10] And never knew what he was talking
[53:11] about.
[53:13] I mean, the world reads the books out
[53:14] there.
[53:16] They sure do. Amen.
[53:17] And they preach on it, too. Right.
[53:18] Amen.
[53:19] But is that the bride? See me now. All
[53:22] right. The six uh seals. The message
[53:25] went out in 63. Everybody got that. But
[53:29] he hid something in there. The mystery
[53:30] of his coming. The seventh seal. That
[53:32] was the coming of the Lord. Now, that
[53:34] was every word. See, and the whole
[53:36] thing, every word, of course. See, but
[53:37] that was coming right to a bride who
[53:39] knew who she was. Who would touch the
[53:41] hymn of his garment to be made whole
[53:43] virtue coming in. And then she knew the
[53:46] first thing comes in from Christ
[53:48] is love.
[53:50] The love of God. That's his nature.
[53:52] And then she knows that. And then she's
[53:54] just in love with God. She's and she
[53:56] cannot be in love with God without being
[53:57] in love with her brother and sister.
[54:00] Is that right?
[54:01] She's never seen God.
[54:02] You follow me now? So therefore, only
[54:04] way she can see God is God in you, one
[54:06] another. And the first thing that life
[54:08] is trying to pull through there, which
[54:10] is love. And and when you see a life,
[54:13] you see light. And there you see the
[54:15] bride walking. There you see the bride
[54:17] changing into a golden brown. Just
[54:20] humble and walking on with God. Amen.
[54:23] Amen.
[54:23] Praise. Do you understand what I'm
[54:24] saying now?
[54:26] We ain't talking against no person,
[54:28] nobody, but we are holding the fort.
[54:31] There's people here who don't know these
[54:33] things. So therefore, we are obligated
[54:36] as a minister, pastor here to stand up
[54:38] here and preach these things to you. See
[54:40] you now. So now we know the spirits that
[54:42] are moving around and how I mean they
[54:44] would take away your very life if you
[54:47] let him.
[54:48] That's right.
[54:48] Exactly right. And you got to stand so
[54:50] strong all the time. See
[54:52] it's but see that's all right. You're
[54:53] going to have you're going to eat the
[54:55] bread and the wine. You're going to eat
[54:56] the bread and drink the wine with him at
[54:58] the end when you have that communion
[55:00] again. Amen. At the end of the battle.
[55:02] It's a great battle. Sure it is. See, he
[55:04] knows that. But they all went through
[55:05] the same battle.
[55:07] Yes, sir. See, and this one is far
[55:09] greater spiritually because it's so
[55:11] deceptive. You don't know who's who. So
[55:14] therefore, the only way to get through
[55:16] this life here right now is to love
[55:18] everybody.
[55:20] Then you don't have no fear.
[55:22] That's right. That's the only way. See
[55:23] me now. It's just to the enemy. Love
[55:26] your enemy. Make a mistake. Love your
[55:28] enemy. Follow me now. Love your brother.
[55:30] Love your sister. Then you then you have
[55:32] peace.
[55:33] You don't worry. You don't tense up with
[55:35] the skill of the spirit. See now it
[55:37] makes you nervous of course. Sure. And
[55:38] when the person leaves gone you
[55:42] see me now. But nevertheless you got
[55:44] that's your test
[55:45] cuz they're anointed
[55:47] and they'll say anything to you at all.
[55:49] They have no fear at all. They'll say
[55:51] anything at all. They don't they they do
[55:53] not care. So now um but they'll tell you
[55:57] why you ain't saved. You can't listen
[56:00] because and so now Jesus Christ said
[56:02] here St. John 1 because in closing he
[56:05] came unto his own his own received him
[56:06] not but as many as received him to them
[56:09] he gave power to become the sons of God.
[56:13] I'm so glad that God had the power for
[56:16] me to become a son of God.
[56:18] And not the people run up and down here
[56:20] who don't want me to have this here.
[56:22] They say I can't have that. You follow
[56:23] me? That's right. Say amen now. And you
[56:25] too see but God said if I receive him
[56:30] he see will give me the power to become
[56:33] his son.
[56:34] Praise the Lord. For he said here as
[56:37] many as receive them. See me now. Now
[56:39] now I don't care how many supernatural
[56:42] demons run up down the land. Doesn't
[56:44] bother me at all because he going to
[56:45] give me the power to become the son of
[56:47] God. See me now.
[56:49] So therefore I don't care how many is is
[56:51] pursuing your life like Saul after
[56:53] David. Yeah.
[56:54] Amen. But your soul is bound in the
[56:58] bundle of life.
[56:59] Can nothing happen to it?
[57:01] Can all these things all happen for a
[57:03] purpose? See now, I don't care how many
[57:05] come today with a crazy loose doctrines
[57:08] trying to tell you it's all right you
[57:10] get there, but just believe it this way.
[57:12] Here's why, friends. When the prophet
[57:14] has preached and you're here to tell, I
[57:15] got the books. We have it here every
[57:17] Sunday night. That right?
[57:18] What do you need somebody to come and
[57:20] tell you that this is what he talking
[57:21] about here?
[57:23] That's ridiculous right there because
[57:24] you have the tape. You know what you're
[57:26] talking about. You hear it. Faith coming
[57:27] by hearing the word from the prophet.
[57:30] You got it. You don't need somebody to
[57:32] run a charge up and down the street and
[57:34] he catch you out in the dark somewhere.
[57:35] Look here, brother. He meant this over
[57:37] here. No, sir. He meant what he said in
[57:38] the Bible there.
[57:39] Amen.
[57:39] Amen. So now we see now he says, uh,
[57:44] Amen. See,
[57:46] he says here, as many as received, gave
[57:48] him power to become sons of God which
[57:50] were born. see are not of blood, nor the
[57:54] will of the flesh, nor of the will of
[57:56] man. See, now as I receive his word, as
[57:59] we receive his word, see, he gives us
[58:03] power. Authority
[58:05] Mhm.
[58:05] to become a son of God.
[58:07] Authority to testify for him.
[58:10] Authority to live this life here. Power
[58:12] to live this life here. That right? He
[58:14] gives us the authority by this word to
[58:16] challenge Satan
[58:18] like I'm doing this morning.
[58:19] Amen.
[58:20] You follow me now? Amen.
[58:21] He gives us the authority to preach his
[58:23] word, not certain people, whoever he
[58:26] calls.
[58:27] Amen.
[58:27] So therefore, I have his authority to
[58:29] stay here this morning and to preach the
[58:31] word.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:32] Not read out of the book, but preach it.
[58:34] Amen.
[58:35] You follow me now?
[58:36] By his authority. But there are those
[58:38] who are writing, see now, charges tell
[58:41] you that you can't preach no more.
[58:43] But he said, "Because I could."
[58:46] Now, who should I believe? a
[58:48] supernatural spiritual charger
[58:51] that's riding around in the dark
[58:52] grabbing silly women that can let us all
[58:54] kind of crazy
[58:56] or should I believe the the Lord God
[58:58] Almighty
[59:00] as for me in my house I'm going to serve
[59:02] the Lord
[59:03] see me now now therefore he says you're
[59:07] not you're born again not of blood now
[59:10] watch not by right of a natural descent
[59:14] from man
[59:15] no you're not born again by that way see
[59:17] me Not because you're a Gentile
[59:20] or you're Jew
[59:22] or you are what else you are, Samaritan
[59:24] or something. No sir, they got nothing
[59:25] to do with it. Paul said all of these
[59:27] endless genealogies,
[59:29] where you come from, who you think you
[59:32] are,
[59:33] see that that was not an attribute in
[59:35] his mind.
[59:35] Amen. Amen.
[59:36] Only those that was an attribute of
[59:38] thought in his mind,
[59:40] that's all that he wants here now. So no
[59:43] matter where you come out of European
[59:44] stock or African stock or Chinese stock,
[59:47] it matters not to God whatsoever. It's
[59:49] whether you where you were a thought
[59:52] in his mind.
[59:53] And those who were, they know that they
[59:55] are and they're here standing by
[59:57] authority, witnessing and testifying and
[1:00:01] being witness of that light and
[1:00:02] challenging the devil at every point.
[1:00:05] You follow me now? So therefore because
[1:00:08] their attributes see nor of the will of
[1:00:10] flesh not by the this flesh maybe well
[1:00:12] maybe because I go to hell therefore I
[1:00:14] should serve no sir because you love God
[1:00:19] of of the will of man. See other words
[1:00:21] by man's right man's theories his
[1:00:24] religions his doctrines his idea of what
[1:00:28] brother Brandham said I'm not born again
[1:00:30] by that I'm born again by God
[1:00:33] who came here and died for me and for
[1:00:35] you. Amen.
[1:00:36] See now and that he's so bound us by his
[1:00:39] love. He's so and because integral part
[1:00:42] of us and we of him we're one.
[1:00:45] You see amen now.
[1:00:46] And no matter uh how many supernatural
[1:00:50] spiritual charges
[1:00:52] that as the prophet of God said now I
[1:00:54] say it in love friends. I hope you
[1:00:56] understand that.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] Love is correction.
[1:00:58] And you see people they just don't
[1:01:00] understand and no matter what they'll go
[1:01:02] right outside and they just don't
[1:01:03] understand. Say amen. Now uh people say
[1:01:05] well a person will say I have the wrong
[1:01:07] thoughts. How do I know? Well check that
[1:01:12] thought with the word. You find that
[1:01:14] thought in the word it's not from God.
[1:01:17] If you can't find the word it's not from
[1:01:18] God. Then it's from the enemy.
[1:01:20] You have your own natural thoughts. Then
[1:01:22] if a thought comes into into you that
[1:01:25] well uh this brother is wrong. See me
[1:01:28] now. And this one got to do so and so
[1:01:30] and this is that and so forth and so on.
[1:01:32] That's from the devil.
[1:01:33] Amen. Because the thought of God is that
[1:01:35] you are to love your brother.
[1:01:37] That's a different thought. That's from
[1:01:38] God. See, is peaceable easily to be
[1:01:41] entreated. You don't have to force
[1:01:43] nothing. The Holy Spirit stands up here
[1:01:44] and reveals
[1:01:46] whomsoever will let him come. See, now
[1:01:48] people will say, "Well, what are you
[1:01:50] talking about, brother? You're always
[1:01:51] talking like you're talking about
[1:01:52] somebody." No. See, uh, Brother Bram
[1:01:55] said that Jesus Christ spoke in
[1:01:57] parables.
[1:01:59] Now, I hope that sinks home. We don't
[1:02:01] stand up here and talk about nobody here
[1:02:03] in the east or west or nowhere. We we're
[1:02:05] talking in parables to the bride.
[1:02:07] So you're talking about now and others
[1:02:08] they they don't get they get the wrong
[1:02:10] understand. Think you're talking about
[1:02:11] somebody and why you say this is over
[1:02:13] here. Why don't you just bring this
[1:02:15] thing out so I can understand it. See no
[1:02:17] see it's to the bride parables. Brother
[1:02:19] said on the the unveiling of of the
[1:02:21] mighty God. He said I say some things to
[1:02:24] thin you down.
[1:02:25] That's exactly right. I say these things
[1:02:29] to thin you down so you won't understand
[1:02:32] because the god of this world has
[1:02:33] blinded you.
[1:02:35] How? By supernatural charging. You find
[1:02:38] if somebody run up to you and show you,
[1:02:40] well, brother so and so did so and so
[1:02:42] and so back there. Well, we all was back
[1:02:44] in the mud back there.
[1:02:46] What is brother so and so doing now as a
[1:02:48] lily of the valley or sister so and so.
[1:02:50] Amen.
[1:02:50] So therefore, you know, it's a wrong
[1:02:52] spirit right away pointing you back to
[1:02:53] what somebody did back there. That's a
[1:02:55] wrong spirit.
[1:02:56] Amen. I hope you understand this here.
[1:02:57] If somebody run up to you and said this
[1:02:59] sister or that brother because three
[1:03:02] years ago, four years ago, that's under
[1:03:03] the blood.
[1:03:05] Amen.
[1:03:05] How dare you go back there and pull that
[1:03:07] out.
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:09] Charging around pulling because pull
[1:03:10] those things back out of there.
[1:03:12] You live day by day.
[1:03:15] You follow me now, friends?
[1:03:16] I'm saying these things now because many
[1:03:18] of you go through these little things.
[1:03:20] You have people in and out of here
[1:03:21] coming and going, coming and going.
[1:03:22] Okay? All we know is who's sitting here
[1:03:24] today. That's all I know. See,
[1:03:25] therefore, we don't have any numbers
[1:03:26] here because don't numbers people. See?
[1:03:29] So, I walk out here, I see who's here.
[1:03:31] Well, this is this is the bride. That's
[1:03:32] all I know. Preach right to them. See a
[1:03:34] minute now? And therefore, there's then
[1:03:36] there's those who come in and go out and
[1:03:37] come in and go over here. See what's
[1:03:38] over there. Itching ears, you know, back
[1:03:40] and forth. They can go where anywhere
[1:03:42] they want to go at. See amen now. But
[1:03:43] nevertheless, let us assemble ourselves
[1:03:45] together. Say where the word is going
[1:03:47] forth. Now, all of us believe the
[1:03:49] message. See, amen. We all believe the
[1:03:51] message
[1:03:51] and we we say a little different. You
[1:03:53] see amen now? That's all right. Say
[1:03:55] along as you believe the message.
[1:03:58] All right.
[1:03:59] See, man. Sure. Brother Ram said, "So,
[1:04:01] because Junior Jackson and them, they
[1:04:03] wanted to have uh the people be out on
[1:04:05] the floor speak in tongues, run up and
[1:04:06] down the floor." Brother Brand said,
[1:04:08] "That's all right. Sure. Can we believe
[1:04:09] the message?" He if he wants to eat
[1:04:12] cherry pie, I want to eat apple pie. We
[1:04:14] still eating pie.
[1:04:15] Amen.
[1:04:16] See, talking about now, so if somebody
[1:04:18] wants to believe that nobody got the
[1:04:19] Holy Ghost, that's all right. We all
[1:04:21] eating pie. Thank you.
[1:04:23] See now if somebody wants to believe
[1:04:24] that well can't nobody preach. You got
[1:04:27] to read every word in here and and then
[1:04:29] sit down. That's all right because
[1:04:30] you're still reading the word. See what
[1:04:32] I mean now? But he said in here man
[1:04:34] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:04:36] every word.
[1:04:38] Now now watch. So the enemy comes around
[1:04:41] pulls out a loose end. God said you
[1:04:43] would die. You shall not surely die
[1:04:45] because
[1:04:46] there he is.
[1:04:48] See, they come and tell you, "Well, see,
[1:04:50] I know that Brother Bram said that, but
[1:04:52] here's the reason why you got to do it
[1:04:53] this way and got you right away."
[1:04:56] Somebody said, "Well, see, cuz I know we
[1:04:58] used to get the Holy Ghost, but here's
[1:05:00] what happened now." Because because
[1:05:01] there's no signs and wonders, nobody's
[1:05:03] got it,
[1:05:04] but they got you, right?
[1:05:07] So, you see, that's a loose end pulling
[1:05:09] you out. You say, "Well, that's right."
[1:05:11] Cuz I see I've been down there. I don't
[1:05:12] see anything going on there or nowhere.
[1:05:15] See a minute now. Man shall not live by
[1:05:17] bread alone, but by every word, every
[1:05:20] mechanical word. Not the dynamics alone,
[1:05:22] but but the word of God. I'm trying to
[1:05:24] say this to you friends that the subject
[1:05:27] would be final. See me now because we've
[1:05:31] been hitting and hitting and chopping
[1:05:34] and chopping and long as we see see a
[1:05:36] loose end running and charging, we're
[1:05:39] going to chop and we're going to chop.
[1:05:41] Amen.
[1:05:41] And that spirit is riding and it's
[1:05:43] riding and we standing and holding for
[1:05:45] it. Amen.
[1:05:46] I hope you get it.
[1:05:47] She talking about now. So I said plain
[1:05:49] this morning. As long as we here
[1:05:51] floating through here about nobody needs
[1:05:53] the Holy Ghost, ain't nobody got it.
[1:05:54] See, that's a loose end because the
[1:05:57] prophet said that before he could come
[1:05:59] down, he had to send fire to burn out
[1:06:02] that he might dwell in there.
[1:06:04] So I don't know what you're talking
[1:06:05] about there. This is a gentile age. In
[1:06:08] the gentile age, the gentile, they were
[1:06:10] filthy. They had to come by the spirit.
[1:06:13] another age.
[1:06:14] She talking about now the Jews was
[1:06:15] already sanctified.
[1:06:17] They was already in the house of God.
[1:06:19] Disciples and woman had to come there.
[1:06:20] He called a dog.
[1:06:22] Amen.
[1:06:22] This is the house of Israel here.
[1:06:24] You have nothing to do with this hair.
[1:06:26] You got to wait until the son of God
[1:06:27] pulled out the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:28] Amen.
[1:06:29] And then you come into the kingdom by
[1:06:31] the spirit of God. Then all of a sudden
[1:06:33] the last days when all the word come,
[1:06:34] you going to take out the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:36] Well, how can I come in?
[1:06:39] How much how can I get the locos in
[1:06:41] there? All right.
[1:06:43] When the seed is in the body, the seed
[1:06:46] is in the body.
[1:06:47] Do you understand it, friends?
[1:06:50] Do you hear the bells are ringing?
[1:06:52] Huh?
[1:06:53] Do you hear the angel singing?
[1:06:55] I do.
[1:06:56] Amen.
[1:06:57] I've heard from God.
[1:06:59] I heard from my theophony.
[1:07:01] It's over there.
[1:07:03] And the more I take in of the word of
[1:07:04] God from the fountain of life,
[1:07:07] the water is in me. A fountain is in
[1:07:10] you. Amen.
[1:07:11] You follow me now?
[1:07:12] We're in the season now. I I'm trying I
[1:07:15] don't know how to explain it to you.
[1:07:16] The enemy is riding just before the
[1:07:20] resurrection power falls on the bride
[1:07:22] and dynamics
[1:07:25] what's his name? Uh uh Judas
[1:07:27] comes up at the very last second
[1:07:32] with a loose end. Do you understand
[1:07:35] that?
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:36] Somebody is standing and holding that
[1:07:39] word. They ordained and they have
[1:07:40] authority to do so. That is he and she
[1:07:43] the bride. She's has the authority.
[1:07:45] Every woman, you have the authority with
[1:07:47] this word. Every man, you have authority
[1:07:49] to hold the fort. He gave you the fort
[1:07:51] and told you like Eve the church. Good
[1:07:53] people sincere people but anointed with
[1:07:57] the wrong teaching.
[1:07:58] That's right. See, and with the Holy
[1:08:00] Spirit falling upon them, they'd come
[1:08:02] riding in. See, now here's how their
[1:08:04] nature is. If it's the Holy Spirit,
[1:08:06] they'll come in and sit down. That's it.
[1:08:09] The Holy Spirit come right here and sit
[1:08:10] down and go up to your brother have an
[1:08:12] od against you. Oh, sure. Come on back.
[1:08:14] See what is it? See me now. But if it's
[1:08:16] not the Holy Spirit, it'll never It
[1:08:18] won't come in here, but it stand outside
[1:08:19] and chop chop around. Stomp stomp stomp
[1:08:21] outside. It won't come in here. See, but
[1:08:23] it try to catch a silly woman out there
[1:08:25] somewhere. I'm talking about man and
[1:08:26] woman now. See, woman's churchmen.
[1:08:29] I just sisters now. Man and woman is
[1:08:32] church.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:33] And ministers also.
[1:08:35] You see what I'm talking about now? So
[1:08:36] therefore you have brothers uh because
[1:08:39] raising up not even called for nothing
[1:08:42] but going around talking against you.
[1:08:44] See right now troublemakers busy bodies
[1:08:47] running to and fro. See I'm saying all
[1:08:49] these things this morning so you could
[1:08:50] get it cuz some people say well you
[1:08:51] never because make it plain. Make it
[1:08:53] plain this morning. See man now. So you
[1:08:55] get it. See now we don't want to call
[1:08:56] down fire on nobody. No sir. No. We
[1:08:59] don't call a goat. No. But we just say
[1:09:02] that well if this is a loose end. So
[1:09:04] watch those loose ends.
[1:09:05] Amen. and pray for that soul. Let that
[1:09:07] spirit get up off the person. See amen
[1:09:09] now. And when you'll know when they have
[1:09:11] the right spirit, they'll come in here.
[1:09:13] Sit down.
[1:09:15] Then you'll know if if it won't
[1:09:17] something wrong with that spirit. Other
[1:09:19] words to me is this way. The thing that
[1:09:22] I would hate to do the most if I have
[1:09:24] God in me, Lord, let me do that.
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:27] So somebody hates you here so much. If
[1:09:30] they have God in them, this is where
[1:09:31] they'll come where they left God.
[1:09:34] Amen. See, and when they when God is
[1:09:36] with them and they baron up and loose
[1:09:38] them, oh, they'll see different there.
[1:09:41] But until that time, they're covered.
[1:09:43] And if they're covered, they don't even
[1:09:45] know that they are covered.
[1:09:47] Nevertheless, what can you have to
[1:09:49] preach the word? And therefore, to those
[1:09:52] who don't understand, there are those
[1:09:54] who do understand. He says, "This is the
[1:09:56] day he'll make up his jewels." He's
[1:09:57] bound to it. Those who do understand.
[1:10:00] So, I pray and trust that you
[1:10:01] understand. Separate yourself from all
[1:10:03] unbelief. Turn to page 305. Do you love
[1:10:07] them?
[1:10:09] You see that you're bound, your nature,
[1:10:10] your soul is bound in the bundle of
[1:10:12] life.
[1:10:13] Amen.
[1:10:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. We know that we
[1:10:16] have all of these great and exceeding
[1:10:18] promises whereby we become partakers of
[1:10:20] his nature through the word of God. And
[1:10:23] we see all the prophet of God has
[1:10:25] exalted us. We know that there's a land
[1:10:27] beyond the river.
[1:10:29] We know friends, we are right there. I'm
[1:10:31] only trying to tell you to warn you with
[1:10:33] tears in my heart. There are sincere
[1:10:36] people who don't know that they're
[1:10:38] anointed with the wrong spirit because
[1:10:40] it is not the spirit of Christ which is
[1:10:42] easy to be entreated bear. Well, no, if
[1:10:45] the person is wrong, if somebody did
[1:10:47] something to you, what does Peter say?
[1:10:50] See that if you if you get buffeted
[1:10:52] about for your own faults, that ain't
[1:10:54] nothing with God.
[1:10:55] But if you buff it about and so forth,
[1:10:57] so on and then that's thank worthy. See
[1:10:59] me? Now that's with God. That's what he
[1:11:01] blesses there. So if somebody doing
[1:11:02] something wrong to you, that person will
[1:11:04] still humble themselves and still have
[1:11:06] the spirit of Christ and wait until God
[1:11:08] make the thing right. They won't go
[1:11:09] around riding up and down stomping out
[1:11:11] their things like is there in the wrong
[1:11:12] spirit. You see me now and tell you what
[1:11:15] some kind of because a crazy loose end
[1:11:17] that well nobody need the whole I mean
[1:11:19] see I say that I hope some people say
[1:11:20] what is he talking all the time about
[1:11:22] that for? Don't you understand that
[1:11:24] there's a pit of hell there
[1:11:26] and you have to break one word? Oh, it's
[1:11:30] all I hear him in the message. Well,
[1:11:31] that don't mean nothing. Brother so and
[1:11:33] so used to teach down here just recently
[1:11:36] that uh you don't take the Lord's supper
[1:11:38] no more. The rapture's already come. And
[1:11:41] then this brother saw that brother and
[1:11:43] asked about it. He said, "Well, you
[1:11:45] know, so then I asked him." He said,
[1:11:46] "Well, it's all right." I said, "All
[1:11:47] right." I said, "But now, how many
[1:11:49] people did he pollute their souls with
[1:11:50] that with?"
[1:11:51] Right. and you say it's all right. I
[1:11:53] can't see that friend. I'll never see
[1:11:55] that. I never will see that.
[1:11:57] How a minister or a brother or somebody
[1:12:00] or sister can run around with the wrong
[1:12:02] thing, pollute somebody, and then they
[1:12:04] go around and then somebody tell them
[1:12:05] different, they say, "Oh, that's right."
[1:12:06] But what about the others
[1:12:08] that they did that to?
[1:12:11] So that's why there, as long as I hear
[1:12:12] about there's no Holy Ghost, I'm going
[1:12:14] to blast that loosening out.
[1:12:16] Now, I hope that's plain to you. So you
[1:12:18] understand that and you won't be
[1:12:20] wondering what am I doing up here. I'm
[1:12:21] holding a fort.
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:23] Or do you understand? I hope that's
[1:12:25] playing to you.
[1:12:26] Say, I'm standing here. I am for
[1:12:28] holiness.
[1:12:29] I am for love.
[1:12:32] I am for perfection.
[1:12:33] Amen.
[1:12:34] And I'm against that filthy spirit that
[1:12:36] will talk against his brother
[1:12:38] that will hate. I'm against that because
[1:12:40] God is against it.
[1:12:41] Amen.
[1:12:42] Now, I hope that's plain. You won't have
[1:12:43] to go out here and ask nobody what is
[1:12:46] brother Coleman talking about cuz that's
[1:12:48] what I mean.
[1:12:49] And we are not the same with any group
[1:12:51] that's saying there's no Holy Ghost.
[1:12:53] We are not the same with any group who's
[1:12:55] telling you all you got to do is just
[1:12:56] read the every word. No siren. We are
[1:12:58] not the same. So I'm telling you this
[1:13:00] morning
[1:13:01] by the authority of Jesus Christ. We are
[1:13:02] not the same because the prophet said
[1:13:04] you take one word out of there. Many
[1:13:07] false annoyons would ride in ' 66, 67,
[1:13:11] 68, and 69 just before the resurrection
[1:13:14] power falls upon you. Judas is
[1:13:16] perverting the word of God.
[1:13:19] Don't you hear? The bells are ringing.
[1:13:21] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:23] I know there's a land beyond the river.
[1:13:26] I know there's somebody in here
[1:13:28] that know they come from God.
[1:13:31] Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] And asked Elijah for a double portion.
[1:13:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:37] And then say, "Where is the Lord God of
[1:13:38] Elijah?"
[1:13:40] And then by faith smite the water and
[1:13:42] goes back and then they walk over that
[1:13:43] land over there.
[1:13:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:47] To me, uh, it's like we've just left the
[1:13:50] city and walking out over the hills
[1:13:53] and the father's house is a way off and
[1:13:56] the bells are ringing.
[1:13:57] Come on in. It's evening time. Amen.
[1:14:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:01] The angels, the messengers was run up
[1:14:03] and down and singing it.
[1:14:04] Amen. They heard the people heard from
[1:14:06] their theophonies.
[1:14:08] And this morning's message I pray you
[1:14:10] understand what I was talking about. For
[1:14:12] in many things we offend all we all
[1:14:15] offend in many things. See if any man
[1:14:18] offend not in word the same as a perfect
[1:14:20] man and able to bridle the whole body.
[1:14:23] So I'm trying to show you friends that
[1:14:25] the anointing of God through the word
[1:14:27] trying to bring this body into
[1:14:29] subjection to the word of God. And so
[1:14:32] through correction, the house of
[1:14:33] correction, we say this in love because
[1:14:35] we know those of you who who are here
[1:14:37] the first time, we know where we're
[1:14:39] standing at. We know this is the last
[1:14:41] seconds. There's something fixing to
[1:14:43] happen. I was just thinking about Sarah
[1:14:45] starting out at 65 and ending up her
[1:14:48] cycle as 90 years old, 69.
[1:14:51] And uh God has witnesses all through the
[1:14:53] Bible and how those things happen there
[1:14:55] and how we're not blind. We know uh we
[1:14:58] saw God's prophet walk. We saw Jesus
[1:15:01] Christ. So we know we're wrong if we run
[1:15:03] up and down the street and somebody's
[1:15:04] trying to chop somebody down and talking
[1:15:06] about the English and they can't preach
[1:15:08] and this is wrong and that's wrong.
[1:15:09] Seemen now. We know if somebody walks up
[1:15:11] to you and says a a thoughtless word
[1:15:14] that that cuz that is not Christ. That's
[1:15:16] the tongue. See? And you should bridle
[1:15:18] that. Seemen now. And so people they get
[1:15:20] mad. That's all right. See now because
[1:15:22] they get mad at Jesus Christ. You see?
[1:15:24] And so therefore we're only trying to
[1:15:26] show you the a more perfect way. You
[1:15:29] see, which is the way we know that the
[1:15:31] anointing, the dove, say, in the full
[1:15:33] anointing, it's going to land upon that
[1:15:35] lamb one of these days soon. It's going
[1:15:37] to be, it's very, very, very close. And
[1:15:41] we know um many things that are to
[1:15:44] happen right here. It's all for purpose.
[1:15:47] It's been the purpose of God that
[1:15:49] everything that's happened to this hour
[1:15:52] has been God's purpose that I know that
[1:15:54] I can uh stake my life on. See amen now.
[1:15:58] But all I'm trying to show those if you
[1:16:00] understand friend what I'm trying to say
[1:16:01] to you there are those sitting here they
[1:16:03] don't quite understand there are those
[1:16:04] who just come into the message so to
[1:16:06] speak haven't been here when we started
[1:16:08] out and in this message and they come in
[1:16:11] with a sort of a intellectual idea about
[1:16:13] it see and think it's like the other
[1:16:15] church where you just go ahead no you
[1:16:17] don't do this by the spirit of God it's
[1:16:19] revealed and if the Holy Spirit has come
[1:16:22] into a brother or a sister here if it's
[1:16:23] a sister she ceases to dress like the
[1:16:26] world or to look like the world. She
[1:16:28] takes a stand against her husband and so
[1:16:30] forth on certain things of God. See man
[1:16:33] now she does that if there's a brother
[1:16:34] he because he likewise and so forth.
[1:16:37] Everybody lines up with the word of God
[1:16:39] and they are washed by the water of the
[1:16:41] word and the first thing we learn is
[1:16:43] correction and so forth and what how we
[1:16:45] are to be as a adult Christian. There's
[1:16:48] many babies you see but we're talking to
[1:16:50] the adult. It's all right if you want to
[1:16:51] run up and down and talk that's all
[1:16:52] right because they'll be there too. See,
[1:16:54] but I'm talking about in the city,
[1:16:56] that's a different place. You follow me
[1:16:58] now? There's many, say, who won't die
[1:17:00] out to the tongue and these things here.
[1:17:02] Now, see, because the word of God has
[1:17:04] come forth in judgment, in mercy through
[1:17:08] a prophet's message.
[1:17:10] So, heed the call this morning and and
[1:17:12] and don't one day you can walk in here
[1:17:14] just coming from somewhere else and
[1:17:16] still talking and and so forth and it'll
[1:17:19] be there. So, I just trying to warn you.
[1:17:21] That's all. See, you'll just walk in one
[1:17:23] day. It that'll be the time. That'll be
[1:17:26] the day. And then he'll just call it
[1:17:27] right out. See, now there are those
[1:17:29] sitting here who don't believe that
[1:17:30] because if they did, they wouldn't
[1:17:32] continually go on the way they are going
[1:17:34] on. See a minute now. So, we know that
[1:17:36] they don't believe it. Nothing we can do
[1:17:38] because uh because according to your
[1:17:40] faith be it unto you. See, but if you
[1:17:42] have heard a sister or brother from your
[1:17:44] theophony, you heard from God, then you
[1:17:46] see them their body come in subjection
[1:17:48] to the word of God. You see the life
[1:17:51] that was in God in that person, then
[1:17:53] you'll see love one another and so
[1:17:55] forth. See, you see that. And then if
[1:17:57] you see the wrong spirit trying to stomp
[1:18:00] you out, I just told you where it come
[1:18:01] from. You see a spirit moving in with a
[1:18:04] loose end trying to show you, show you,
[1:18:05] show you, show you when God has showed
[1:18:07] you all along himself. He showed you
[1:18:09] himself. He don't need somebody outside
[1:18:11] to run in and show you here a little
[1:18:12] scripture here. Say, "No, he'll he show
[1:18:14] you the whole thing." He said, "Not not
[1:18:16] not just one little part in there, the
[1:18:18] whole word of God. There's not a one
[1:18:20] little part and many of them have come
[1:18:22] up this this last time here all across
[1:18:24] the country with little scriptures and
[1:18:26] things one little part out of the
[1:18:28] message. See, and you know that's wrong.
[1:18:30] So I pray that you understand what I'm
[1:18:32] trying to explain to you. I try to
[1:18:33] explain in love. We love the brethren,
[1:18:35] sisters, and so forth. But there's a
[1:18:37] stand we have to take. You see, and we
[1:18:39] have the authority from God to take that
[1:18:42] stand here because we ordained to do so.
[1:18:44] See, and many have run up against that.
[1:18:48] See, many have run up against that door
[1:18:50] in the stand. See, broken in pieces
[1:18:52] because it's not us here, it's him. See,
[1:18:55] look, this is God's work. A man who
[1:18:57] wasn't even said saved said one time
[1:19:00] because about Peter and them. He said,
[1:19:02] "Because careful." He said, "Because if
[1:19:04] it's God's work, you're fighting against
[1:19:05] God.
[1:19:07] But if it's just man, as you say, cuz
[1:19:09] they don't read the books and this thus
[1:19:11] and so it'll come to north." So if you
[1:19:13] have the spirit of Christ, don't fight
[1:19:14] it. Is that right? Other words, if you
[1:19:17] have the spirit of Christ in you, what
[1:19:18] would you run up and down because New
[1:19:20] York for telling that this church is
[1:19:22] wrong? Because if it's man like you say
[1:19:24] a spirit of man, it will come to north.
[1:19:28] You can believe that that I know if the
[1:19:31] spirit of man was up in this pulpit here
[1:19:33] these many years, it wouldn't be one
[1:19:35] person sitting there.
[1:19:36] Not a one. Now, all of you know that.
[1:19:39] I'm talking plain to you this morning.
[1:19:40] Amen. Then if it's not the spirit of man
[1:19:43] and you know it's Christ proved it
[1:19:47] through the down through the years what
[1:19:49] are you fighting for then?
[1:19:51] You see what I'm talking about now? Join
[1:19:53] hands together in love and prayer
[1:19:54] wherever you are here and there and
[1:19:56] there and be one.
[1:19:57] That's the spirit of Christ. But then if
[1:19:59] if the the person there in authority
[1:20:01] there sees a a certain spirit coming
[1:20:04] stomping and be chomping down, they've
[1:20:06] got to wander up in the tower. Amen.
[1:20:09] They see those charges charging across
[1:20:12] the plane, the smoke and fury of them.
[1:20:14] No one snorting and everything else,
[1:20:17] foaming at the mouth all excited cuz
[1:20:19] they saw the Holy Spirit coming. They
[1:20:21] see like Abraham saw coming down the
[1:20:23] plane. See
[1:20:24] God himself.
[1:20:25] Amen. Just quiet like and humble. They
[1:20:28] see, whoa, praise the Lord. Here comes
[1:20:29] the Lord. Amen. But somebody charging
[1:20:32] like this here out in the dark out
[1:20:34] there. What if it's of God? Bring it to
[1:20:36] the light.
[1:20:38] Don't grab a sister outside and she just
[1:20:40] come recently in the mess. Don't even
[1:20:41] know what's even going on. Say, "Well,
[1:20:43] it's all the same thing." No, it's not
[1:20:44] neither. So therefore, if you don't know
[1:20:47] what you're talking about, don't say
[1:20:48] nothing. You shouldn't say nothing,
[1:20:49] sister. See, or brother, I hope that's
[1:20:51] plain. There are sisters in here who
[1:20:53] don't understand what's going on here.
[1:20:55] They just come here and they say, "Well,
[1:20:57] this group, that group, what's all this
[1:20:59] about anyway?" See, that's the wrong
[1:21:01] spirit. Cuz if Christ was in that
[1:21:03] person, they would be so humble. They
[1:21:05] thank God that God open up their eyes to
[1:21:07] come out of this this because filthy
[1:21:09] world out here and find a place of light
[1:21:11] and also holiness and also purity where
[1:21:14] the word of God goes forth. Say amen
[1:21:16] now. So like I say if this if you think
[1:21:19] it's not of God don't fight it because
[1:21:22] you be fighting at the wrong time
[1:21:23] because Saul fought David. David he just
[1:21:26] sidestepped that s but he God was with
[1:21:28] him. He was in line of duty. She shm
[1:21:30] because kicked dirt up. That's all
[1:21:32] right. See, but there comes a day. I
[1:21:34] don't want to see nobody here now. You
[1:21:36] see that now? There comes a day. I don't
[1:21:37] want nobody to be with nobody who's
[1:21:39] going to be standing in that spot. And
[1:21:41] there are those who will be. See, but we
[1:21:43] pray to God there's nobody here. See,
[1:21:45] now I can only You said, "Well, who told
[1:21:47] you that?" He did. That's what I'm here
[1:21:50] for. See now as a as one of the pastors
[1:21:53] here to warn you and tell you things.
[1:21:55] Now, I feel led to do that this morning.
[1:21:57] That's to tell you just talk from my
[1:21:58] heart cuz some of you don't know. You
[1:22:00] just come recently. Therefore, you
[1:22:02] should sit down a while and pray before
[1:22:03] you say anything. Well, what happened
[1:22:06] with brother Coleman back in ' 64 and so
[1:22:08] and so? What happened back in ' 62? If
[1:22:10] you wasn't there, don't say nothing.
[1:22:13] Now, I hope I hope that gets home to
[1:22:14] you. If you don't know what Brother
[1:22:16] Coleman and the person did in ' 61 or '
[1:22:19] 62 or 63, four or five, if you was not
[1:22:22] there, just come now. Don't say one word
[1:22:26] because you only heard one side of the
[1:22:28] story.
[1:22:29] You got to hear two sides. Then if you
[1:22:30] really want to know will come to brother
[1:22:32] Coleman
[1:22:33] and he'll certainly tell you he'll
[1:22:35] notice it abroad
[1:22:36] cuz it's all have come through here all
[1:22:39] because already everybody here knows
[1:22:40] about it nothing here you follow me now
[1:22:43] see so I hope that gets home to somebody
[1:22:45] if you are confused about something this
[1:22:47] morning I pray to God I hope you hear
[1:22:50] the bells are ringing I hope you hear
[1:22:53] the angels the messengers singing that
[1:22:55] message like the shepherds did you
[1:22:58] follow me now see and and also those who
[1:23:01] are spiritual, the elders and so forth,
[1:23:03] the deacons, everybody in here. And I
[1:23:06] know it's hard for you. Certain ones
[1:23:07] will run up to you as soon as you go
[1:23:08] downstairs there some outside the word.
[1:23:10] See, and you got to see and go on.
[1:23:13] That's your test. Keep moving anyway.
[1:23:14] But keep your heart pure and clean and
[1:23:17] don't get anything funny in there. See,
[1:23:19] just keep your hearts cuz clear, pure,
[1:23:21] and clean. See? And then you just wait
[1:23:24] on the Lord and you're going to see
[1:23:25] something take place. Shall we stand?
[1:23:27] There's a land beyond the river
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:35] that we call the sweet forever.
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:43] And we only reap that short by faith
[1:23:49] decree.
[1:23:53] One by one we'll gain a portal
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] there to dwell
[1:24:04] with him.
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:09] When they ring the golden
[1:24:14] bell
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:19] and
[1:24:22] [Music]
