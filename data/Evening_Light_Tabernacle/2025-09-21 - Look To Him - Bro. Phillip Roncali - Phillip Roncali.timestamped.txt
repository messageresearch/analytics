[0:01] [Music]
[0:05] And I know
[0:07] the Bible says
[0:11] when you've done all that you can to
[0:14] stand,
[0:16] just stand.
[0:18] [Music]
[0:21] Oh, and I know
[0:23] that it's hard sometimes
[0:27] to look through these tear stained eyes
[0:32] and still see
[0:34] the scars in
[0:37] those hands.
[0:42] [Music]
[0:43] But just you
[0:46] keep this in mind
[0:49] when hope seems
[0:52] so hard to find
[0:55] that surely
[0:58] you've not reached the end.
[1:04] [Music]
[1:06] And when the whole world
[1:09] has let you down,
[1:13] Jesus,
[1:14] you know, he can still be found.
[1:18] And when you've tried
[1:21] it all,
[1:23] just look to him.
[1:26] [Music]
[1:27] Oh, look to him.
[1:32] for him. Only
[1:35] when sorrow
[1:38] makes lonely
[1:41] all the days
[1:43] when the night closes
[1:47] in.
[1:49] [Music]
[1:51] And he can vanish
[1:55] all your midnight.
[1:58] And he can call back
[2:01] the sunlight.
[2:02] [Music]
[2:04] So how
[2:06] will it
[2:09] look to him?
[2:14] [Music]
[2:15] Now I know
[2:18] that questions can't
[2:22] Lord. They can get so hard to
[2:24] understand.
[2:26] a thing.
[2:32] But I know someone.
[2:35] Oh, he knows it all.
[2:38] And his eyes see even that little
[2:41] sparrow fall.
[2:43] Yet he can hold back
[2:46] the sea
[2:48] with just one hand.
[2:51] [Music]
[2:53] He's
[2:55] so big you ride
[2:57] on the breeze that blows.
[3:00] Yet in your heart, the only one that
[3:04] knows
[3:06] the heartache
[3:08] and all the trouble you're in.
[3:15] Oh, and when life sings
[3:20] everything but good,
[3:22] [Music]
[3:24] remember him cuz he the only one that
[3:27] could.
[3:29] And if you don't
[3:32] dare,
[3:34] just look to him.
[3:38] Oh,
[3:40] and look to him
[3:43] for he only
[3:46] with sorrow
[3:49] makes lonely
[3:51] all the days.
[3:54] When the night close
[3:58] in
[4:00] [Music]
[4:02] and he can banish
[4:06] all your midnight
[4:08] and he can call back
[4:11] the sunlight.
[4:15] So how
[4:17] will it
[4:19] and look to hear?
[4:23] Oh
[4:26] to him
[4:28] for he only
[4:31] when sorrow
[4:34] makes lonely
[4:37] all the days
[4:40] when the night close
[4:43] in.
[4:46] Oh, and he can banish
[4:51] your midnight
[4:53] and he can call back
[4:57] to sunlight.
[5:00] So how
[5:02] will it
[5:05] look to him?
[5:07] [Music]
[5:10] [Applause]
